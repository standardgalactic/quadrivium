DC Motors and Generators 
Motors obey the left hand rule and generators the right hand rule, (the gener - righter rule).  
 
  
 
 
Back emf in DC machine E = 2p ZS Φ rps where E is volts, 2p is number of poles, ZS is number of 
conductors in series, Φ is in Wb and rps is speed in rev/sec 
Power W = 2p ZS Φ Ia rps where W is watts, Ia is the armature current in amps 
Torque Torque = 2p ZS Φ Ia / (2  ) Newton metres = E Ia / (2  rps ) Newton metres  
In Imperial units Torque= 0.117 x 2p ZS Φ Ia lb ft = 0.117 E Ia / ( rps) lb ft ) 
 
Shunt motor n = n0 – m T where n is speed, n0 is no load speed, m is approximately constant and 
T is Torque. n0 = V/(2p Φ ZS ) and m = 2  Ra / ( 2p Φ ZS )2 
 
  
 
 
Series motor T = T0 / (1 +  n)2 where T0 and  are approximately constant 
T0 = 2p K ZS V2 / (2  R2 ) and  = 2p K ZS / R2 and K = Φ / I = 4  N x 10–7 / Σ(L /  A)  
 
 
 
 
 
Compound motor has shunt and series windings. This can increase the starting torque for a shunt motor. 
If wound in opposition, the motor speed can be made nearly constant. 
 
Armature reaction causes a magnetizing force centred between the poles distorting the field and slightly 
reducing it. Compensating windings between the main poles cancel the armature reaction. 
Interpoles are small poles carrying armature current between the main poles to improve commutation. 
Armature windings can be lap or wave wound.

vectors. The diagram shows the Vector representation of current and voltage where the current lags the 
voltage This diagram shows the vectors as the peak values. However the rms values are 0.707 times the

Automatic Voltage Regulator adjusts the excitation so that at the system design power factor, the voltage 
is correct whatever the current. If however it adjusts the excitation to give the correct voltage at other 
power factors, then two machines will not run in parallel. One can supply a huge leading current and the 
other a huge lagging current. A “droop” is needed to give a lower voltage if the power factor lags by more 
than the system design. This is achieved by the compounding. Faulty Compounding causes unstable 
sharing of kVAr which can be quite violent.  
 
System Faults. When a fault occurs, initially dc currents are induced in the damping winding and main 
field circuit opposing the demagnetizing effect of the low power factor fault current. These currents die 
away exponentially causing the fault current to fall. In extreme cases it can fall below the full load value. 
 
Induction motor Power = 3 V2 (1 – Σ) Rr Σ / (Rr
2 + X2 Σ2 ) watts where the slip Σ = (n0 – n ) / n0 
Power = 2  T (1 –Σ) n0 watts where T is the torque in Newton metres and n0 is the synch speed 
Torque = 3 V2 Rr Σ / [ 2  n0 (Rr
2 + X2 Σ2 ) ] Torque is a maximum when Σ = Rr / X 
Put Σ = 1, Starting Torque = 3 V2 Rr / [ 2  n0 (Rr
2 + X2 )]  
If Rr = X, the maximum torque occurs when the speed is zero but the motor would be very inefficient. 
However large motors sometimes have slip rings allowing an external resistance to be added for starting. 
 
The Induction motor speed torque curve. Sometimes there is a kink in the curve at a speed below the 
speed for maximum torque due to harmonics in the supply. In such cases, the motor may get stuck at this 
speed , called “crawling”.

Summary
 
 
Transformers 
Power transformers are usually delta primary and star secondary. The primary is supplied through three 
conductors.  
Flux Φmax = [4  μ A N I max / L] x 10–7 weber 
EMF Erms = 4.44 N Φmax f volts 
 
Delta Star Transformation 
Three phase load, primary current equals 
secondary current times voltage ratio. 
 
 
 
A single phase load on the secondary results 
in a current on two lines in the primary 
governed by the turns ratio, not the voltage ratio. 
 
Third harmonic voltages are the same at each end of each primary winding. Therefore no third harmonic 
current flows in the primary and no third harmonic voltage appears in the secondary.

Unit Pole 
The pole of a magnet, whose strength is one unit pole, placed in a vacuum one cm from an identical pole 
repels it with a force of one dyne. At a distance r cm, they repel with a force of 1/r2 dynes. 
 
Magnetic Field 
The magnetic field at any point is the force on a unit North pole placed at that point, provided it does not 
disturb the magnetic field. The symbol used for magnetic field is B. It is a vector quantity. The cgs unit is 
dynes/unit pole or gauss (G). The Engineering unit is the tesla (T) = 104 gauss.  
(value in tesla) = 10 – 4  (value in gauss).  
Iron filings sprinkled on a card placed over the magnet align into lines from the North to the South pole and 
show the direction of the magnetic field. 
 
Magnetic Flux 
The magnetic flux crossing an area normal to a magnetic field is the product of the magnetic field and the 
area. The symbol used for magnetic flux is The cgs unit is the maxwell (previously lines) = gauss cm2. 
The Engineering unit is the weber (Wb) = tesla m2.  
1 weber = 108 maxwells. 
(value in weber) = 10 – 8  (value in maxwells). 
Flux 
 = ∫ B dA 
where B is in Tesla and A is m2 
 
Magnetic Field due to an Electrical Current 
Faraday was carrying out experiments in his laboratory with an electrical cell. There happened to be a 
magnetic compass on his table. He noticed that the compass needle was deflected whenever he switched 
on the electrical current. He investigated further and found that the current caused a magnetic field in a 
circular path round the wire. The direction of the magnetic field is in the clockwise direction when viewed 
in the direction of the current which flows from the positive to the negative terminal of the cell. 
This is the Corkscrew Rule. As the corkscrew is wound forward in the direction of the current, it rotates in 
the direction of the magnetic field. 
 
 
 
Magnetizing Force  
The current produces a magnetizing force which is proportional to the current and inversely proportional 
to the square of its distance from the wire. The symbol for magnetizing force is H and the emu unit is the 
oersted (Oe). In a vacuum, a magnetizing force of one Oe produces a magnetic field of one G. 
In a medium with permeability μ, one Oe produces a magnetic field of μ G. 
The value of μ in a vacuum is 1 and in air is very close to 1. 
For small values of H, μ for iron is approximately constant with a value in the order of 1000 or more. 
B = μ  H provided H is small.

Electromagnetism and Electrostatics
However the relation between B and H in iron is not linear. Above about 1.5 tesla, the gradient falls 
dramatically. Thus magnetic circuits are often designed for a maximum B of about 1.5 tesla. 
 
 
 
Furthermore, iron retains some magnetism when the magnetizing force is switched off. The magnetic field 
B therefore depends on both H and what has gone before. 
 
Electromagnetic unit of current, Ampère’s or La Places’ Rule  
Electrical current, strength one electromagnetic unit (1 emu), flowing through an arc of wire one cm long 
and one cm radius produces a magnetizing force of one oersted at the centre. 
 
 
 
The symbol for current is I 
The Engineering unit is the ampère or amp. 
1 amp = 1/10 em unit of current.  
(value in amps) = 10  (value in emu) 
 
Quantity of Electricity 
The emu for quantity of electricity is the quantity of electricity that crosses a cross section of the wire 
carrying 1 emu of current for 1 second. 
The symbol for quantity of electricity is q and the Engineering unit is the coulomb. 
1 coulomb = 1 amp second = 1/10 emu of quantity. 
 
I = dq/dt where I is in amps, q is in coulombs and t is in seconds 
 
Magnetizing force due to an element 
The magnetizing force at P due to I emu of current through the element δs is; 
 
δH = I  δs  Sin θ / r2  
where H is in oersted, I is in emu, δs and r are in cm.

Mechanical Force on a conductor in a magnetic field 
Place two unit poles P and Q a distance r cm apart in air (μ = 1). 
Pole P exerts a force of 1/r2 dynes on pole Q in the direction shown. 
By the definition of magnetic field, the field at Q due to P is 1/r2 gauss. 
 
 
 
Replace pole Q by a length of wire s long at an angle θ to the direction of P. The magnetic field at Q due 
to pole P remains at 1/r2 gauss. 
 
Pass a current of I emu through the wire and it will cause a magnetic field of I  δs  Sin θ / r2 gauss at P 
By the definition of magnetic field, the element of wire exerts a force of I  δs  Sin θ / r2 dynes on pole P. 
By the corkscrew law the direction of the force is into the paper. 
 
Action and reaction are equal and opposite, therefore the magnetic field of 1/r2 gauss due to pole P exerts 
a force of I  δs  Sin θ / r2 dynes on the element of wire.  
 
Therefore a field of B gauss would exert a force of B  I  δs  Sin θ dynes on the element of wire, the force 
being in a direction out of the paper.

Magneto Motive Force 
The current in a coil is said to produce a Magneto Motive Force (mmf) of 
(4  /10) x (Ampere Turns) Gilberts. Thus one Gilbert / cm produces a Magnetizing Force of one oersted. 
The symbol for mmf is F. 
F = (4  /10) x (Ampere Turns) where F is in Gilberts

where B is in gauss, I is in amps and L is in cms 
1.26μ I (N/L) 10–6 tesla 
where B is in tesla, I is in amps and L in metres 
 
Magnetic Circuit 
If the solenoid is wound on a ring, the magnetic circuit is complete within the ring. 
The mmf F = (4  N I Gilberts 
This causes flux Φ = (μ F A / L) 10–6 weber 
Where F is in Gilberts, A in m2 and L in metres 
 
 
 
If the magnetic circuit consists of different materials, eg a ring with an air gap or the field circuit of a 
motor, then the total mmf to produce the flux is the sum of the mmfs to produce the flux in each part. 
F = F1 + F2 + F3 + etc 
Where F1 = ΦL1 / (μ1 A1 ) 106 etc 
Φ = (4  N I x 10–6 / Σ(L1/μ1A1) 
Where Φ is in weber, I in amps, A in m2 and L in metres 
 
Example 
An iron ring, mean diameter 20 cms, with an air gap of 5 mm is wound with 680 turns. 
It takes 5 amps to give a flux density of 0.8 tesla. Find μ for the iron. 
Length of iron =  x 20 / 100 = 0.628 metres

0.8 = (4  x 3400 x 10–6 / [0.628/ μ + 5/1000]

This occurs at a negative AT of 44 and a flux density of 0.621 tesla 
The mmf for the air gap is provided partly by the residual magnetism and partly by the ampere turns.  
 
Magnetic Flux from a unit pole  
The magnetic field 1 cm from a unit pole is by definition 1 oersted. 
But the surface area of the sphere radius 1 cm is 4 cm2 
Thus the total magnetic flux leaving a unit pole is 4 maxwells. 
In Engineering units, the total flux leaving a unit pole is 4x 10–8 weber. 
 
Electrostatics 
Electrostatic units (esu) 
If an insulating particle becomes charged, it sticks to another insulated body.  Particles of polystyrene 
stick to the window.  A nylon shirt pulled over your hair charges up the nylon and it can discharge with 
visible sparks.  This introduces a new set of units.  A unit electrostatic charge placed one cm away from a 
similar unit charge experiences a force of one dyne.  The work done in taking an esu unit of charge 
through an esu unit of voltage is one erg.  Many textbooks state that this set of esu units  is related to emu 
units by the velocity of light.  
 
Force on electrostatic charge 
A charge q1  distant d cms from another charge q2 in dielectric constant k experiences a force 
F = q1 q2 / (k d2  ) 
 
Electrostatic field 
The electrostatic field at any point is the force exerted on a unit charge. 
 
f = q /  (k d2  ) 
 
Electrostatic flux 
Electrostatic field at the perimeter of a sphere radius  d  cm in air (k = 1) with a charge  q  at the centre 
Electrostatic field     f = q /  (1 x  d2  ) = q / d2 
Electrostatic flux = electrostatic field times area 
Surface area of sphere radius d cm = 4 d2 
Therefore the total electrostatic flux leaving a charge q  = q 4  
 
Gauss’s Theorem 
Using es units, consider a unit charge q in a vacuum.  
The electric induction at P = q/r2 
Consider an elemental area δA of the boundary 
Electric induction through δA = (q/r2)  Cos θ δA 
          = q δω     
where δω is the solid angle subtended by δA 
Adding over the whole surface, total normal electric inductance = q  4π 
 
If φ is the electric induction at a pont P, 
then electric force at P is F = φ / k where k is the relative permitivity (or dielectric constant)

Induced EMF 
 
Potential Difference (pd) 
The potential difference between two points is one volt if one watt of power is produced when one amp 
flows from one point to the other. The symbol for pd is V and the Engineering unit is the volt. One joule 
of work is done when one coulomb of electricity flows through a pd of one volt. 
 
W = V I where W is in watts, V is in volts and I is in amps  
 
joule is 107 ergs and amp is 1/10 em unit 
 
therefore the volt is joules / sec / amp = 108 emu 
 
Electro Motive Force (emf) 
An emf is generated when the magnetic flux linking with a coil is changed. It is measured in volts. The 
generated emf is one volt when one amp generates one watt of power. 
 
Faraday’s Law 
Consider two parallel conductors L metres apart with a third lying across them which carries a current of I 
amps. Apply a uniform magnetic field B tesla perpendicular to the plane of the conductors 
Move the top conductor at a constant velocity v metres/sec against the force on the conductor.

Induced EMF
 
 
 
Mechanical power supplied to move the conductor = B  I  L  v watts 
This power is used to generate an emf E in the conductor generating power at the rate E  I watts. 
Hence E = B  L  v 
Where E is in volts, B is in tesla , L in metres and v in metres/sec 
 
But B  L  v = rate at which the top conductor cuts the magnetic flux = dФ / dt. 
If there are N turns of a coil linking the flux, then 
 
E = – N  dФ / dt where E is in volts and dФ/dt is in Wb/sec 
This is the fundamental equation connecting emf and magnetic flux.  
 
 
 
Lenz’s law states that the generated emf E opposes the change. Therefore the polarity of E is usually 
chosen so that it is negative when the flux linked with the circuit is increasing. 
 
Experiment shows that if a conductor is moved in the direction of the right hand thumb in a field in the 
direction of the right hand first finger then an emf will be generated causing a current to flow in the 
direction of the second finger. 
This is the right hand rule, the “gener-right-or” rule. 
 
Resistance (Ohm’s law) 
At constant temperature, the current in a wire is proportional to the pd between the ends. 
The ratio Volts / Amps is called the resistance in Ohms. The symbol for Ohms is Ω. 
 
R = V/I where R is in ohms, V is in volts and I is in amps  
Legal Ohm is the resistance of a column of mercury 106.3 cms long and 1 sq cm cross section at 00 C 
 
Resistance is proportional to the length of the wire and inversely proportional to the cross section. 
 
R = (ρ L / A) where R is in μΩ, ρ is the resistivity in μΩ per metre cube, L is the length in  
metres and A is the cross sectional area of the wire in metres2.

Resistance Temperature Coefficient of conductors  
Resistance increases with temperature, the increase being approximately linear. 
 
R = R0 (1 + αT) where R0 is the resistance at 00 Celsius, T is the temperature in Celsius and α is 
the temperature coefficient 
 
 
 
Typical values of ρ and α at 150C 
Copper   
ρ = 1.7 μΩ per cm cube    
α = 0.004 
Alumimium  
ρ = 2.9 μΩ per cm cube    
α = 0.004 
Silver  
ρ = 1.6 μΩ per cm cube  
α = 0.004 
Iron 
 
ρ = 10-160 μΩ per cm cube  
α = 0.002 – 0.006 
 
Absolute zero temperature is – 273 0C. At a temperature near absolute zero, R for some materials becomes 
zero. The material is said to be supercooled and can carry a huge current with no energy loss. This 
property is used in some large electro-magnets. 
 
Temperature coefficient of insulation materials 
Increase in temperature reduces the insulation resistance and the effect is logarithmic. An increase in 
temperature of 65 0 C reduces the insulation resistance by a factor of 10. The insulation resistance is also 
dependent on how dry it is. Records of insulation resistance should give the temperature at which the 
measurement was taken. 
 
Work done in taking a unit pole round a closed path through a coil of N turns carrying a current of I amps  
The total flux leaving the pole links with the coil. 
Thus the total flux linkage is 4N x 10–8 weber 
Thus the emf generated by moving the pole is;  
E = 4N x 10–8 / t where t is the time taken. 
Power generated = E I watts = 4N I x 10–8 / t for t secs 
Work done = 4N I x 10–8 joules

Induced EMF
Self Inductance 
The current in a coil causes a magnetic field that links with the coil. Therefore any change in the current 
will induce an emf in the coil. The coil is said to have self inductance. The symbol for self inductance is L 
and the Engineering unit is the henry. A coil is said to have an inductance of one henry if a rate of change 
in current of one amp per second induces an emf of one volt. 
 
E = – L  dI/dt where E is in volts, L is in henries, I is in amps and t is in seconds. The minus sign signifies 
that the emf opposes the change.  
 
Self Inductance of a coil  
A coil is wound with N turns on a ring D metres mean diameter and cross sectional area A square metres 
and permeability μ.  
Let the current be I amps 
Magnetising force, H = 4 π N I /( π D) x 10–7  
Φ = μ H A Weber 
Φ = 4 π μ N I A /( π D) x 10–7 Wb. 
emf due to change in I is given by; 
E = – N dΦ/dt = - N 4 π μ N A /( π D) x 10–7 dI/dt volts 
    = – (4 N2 μ A /D) x 10-7 dI/dt volts 
But E = – L dI/dt 
Therefore 
L = (4 N2 μ A / D) x 10–7 henries 
For a magnetic circuit length S metres 
 
 
L = 1.26 N2 μ A / S x 10–6 henries 
 
 
 
Example 
A coil of 500 turns is wound on a wooden ring 20 cms diameter 
The cross section of the ring is 4 cms diameter. Estimate the self inductance 
 
L = (4π/10) x 5002 x [π x (2/100)2 ] x 10–6 / (π x 0.2) = 2π x 10–4 henries

But there is also flux linkage within conductor A 
Flux linkage in element within conductor A  =( 2 I x / a2 ) 10–7  Lx Weber 
But this links with only ( x2  /  a2  ) of the conductor 
Total flux linkage within conductor A  =( 2 I x3 / a4 ) 10–7  Lx Weber 
Total flux linkage within the conductor  =  (2 I L / a4 ) 10–7  ∫ x3 dx from 0 to a 
 
 
 
 
= (2 I L / a4 ) 10–7  (a4 / 4)  = ( I L / 2 ) 10–7   
Hence the total linkage due to I amps in A  =  [2 I L ln(d/a) + I L / 2 ] 10–7   
Total linkage due to I amps in conductors A and B  = I L [1 + 4 ln(d/a) ] 10–7   
Self Inductance per metre length = [1 + 4 ln(d/a) ] 10–7   Henries 
 
Energy stored in an inductance 
An inductance L henries carries a current I amps. 
Let the inductance be disconnected from the supply but allowed to discharge through a resistor. The power 
supplied by the inductance; 
w = e i watts 
where w, e and i are the values of power, emf and current at any instant during the discharge. 
 
e = –L di/dt 
w = – L i di/dt 
Energy released during the discharge 
= ∫ w dt = ∫– L i di/dt dt 
= ∫– L i di from i = I to i = 0 
 
= – (1/2) L i2 from i = I to i = 0 
 
= (1/2) L I2 joules 
 
Discharge Resistor  
When the current in an inductor is suddenly switched off, di/dt has a very high negative value. In practice 
this means that attempting to switch the current off results in severe arcing at the switch contacts.  
Thus the switch for a large inductor is usually double pole which connects the inductor to a discharge 
resistor before the connection to the supply is broken.

Inductance discharged through a resistance 
When an inductance L henries is discharged through a resistance R ohms, the current decays exponentially 
with a time constant T 
 
Let I0 be the current at t = 0 
E = – L di/dt and E = iR 
(L/i)di = R dt 
∫(1/i) di from I0 to i = – (R/L) ∫dt from 0 to t  
ln(i/I0) = – (R/L)t  
 
i = I0 e –(R/L) t 
But 
i = I0 e –( t/T)  for exponential decay with time constant T 
Hence the current decays exponentially with a time constant T = L/R 
 
Inductance charged through a resistance from constant  volt supply 
When t = 0, the current is zero 
At time t, V = L di/dt + iR 
Multiply by integrating factor eR/L t 
V eR/L t = L eR/L t di/dt + R i eR/L t 
            = L d/dt [ i eR/L t  ] 
Integrating 
(L/R) V eR/L t = L[ i eR/L t ] + Const 
When t = 0, i = 0 therefore Constant = (L/R)V 
i = V/R – V/R e–R/L t = (V/R) (1 – e–R/L t) 
The current rises exponentially with a time constant T = L/R towards I = V/R

Power to inductance charged through a resistance 
Power to inductance W = v i = i Ldi/dt 
W = [(V/R) (1 – e-R/L t)] [ L (V/R) (R/L) e–R/L t] 
W = (V2/R) (e–R/L t) (1 – e–R/L t) 
Put x = (e-R/L t) W = (V2/R) (x – x2) 
 
 
dW/dx = (V2/R) (1 – 2x) 
 
 
dW/dx = 0 when x = ½ 
 
 
d2W/dx2 = (V2/R) (– 2) which is negative 
Therefore W is a maximum when x = ½ 
 
 
WMAX  =  (V2/R) [ ½  – ( ½)2]

Electrostatic field inside a conducting sphere 
Let the density of charge on the surface of a hollow conducting sphere 
be   per unit area. 
Point P experiences a force due to area 1 of 
F = 1  Cos (1 ) /( k r1
2 )  –   2  Cos (2 ) /(k r2

1  Cos (1 ) / r1
2   and   2  Cos (2 ) / r2
2  are equal solid angles 
The charge  on the surface of the sphere exerts no Force on a charge at P 
Hence there is no electrostatic field inside the sphere. 
 
Electrostatic field external to the sphere 
Force on a unit charge external to the sphere =  q / k x2  
where x is the distance of the unit charge from the centre of the sphere 
 
In any set of units, the voltage difference between two points is the work done in taking a unit charge from 
one point to the other.  The electrostatic unit of voltage on the sphere is the work done in ergs when an 
electrostatic unit of charge is brought from infinity to the surface of the sphere.

Capacitor 
A capacitor stores a quantity of electricity. The storage is proportional to the voltage and capacitance. 
The symbol for capacitance is C 
The SI unit is the farad = coulombs/volt but this is too large for practical use. The Engineering unit is the 
microfarad (μF) = 10–6 farad. 
 
q = C  V where C, q and V are in the same units 
 
Conversion of esu units to mks units 
1 esu of quantity = 1 / (3 x 1010) emu of quantity = 1/(3 x 109) coulomb 
where 3 x 1010 cm/sec is the speed of light (actually 2.998 x 1010) 
1 esu of pd = 3 x 1010 emu of pd = 3 x 1010 x 10– 8 volts = 3 x 102 volts 
thus 1 esu of capacitance = (1 esu of quantity) / (1 esu of pd) 
 
= [1/(3 x 109) coulomb] / [3 x 102 volts] 
 
= [1/(9 x 1011)] coulombs / volt 
 
= [1.11 x 10–12] coulombs / volt or farads 
 
= [1.11 x 10–12  106 ] μF 
 
= [1.11 x 10– 6 ] μF 
hence (value of C in μF) = 1.11 x 10– 6 x (value of C in es units) 
The quantity of electricity stored by an isolated sphere  q = k a V 
Therefore the capacitance of the sphere  C = k a  in electrostatic units  
 
Isolated sphere 
C = k a in es units 
C = 1.11  10-6  k a    μF  where  a  is in cm 
Voltage gradient = V a / x2  Volts / cm  
Where V is the potential of the sphere in Volts,  a  cm  is the radius of the sphere  and  x  cm is the 
distance from the sphere centre 
 
Concentric spheres 
Smaller sphere  radius  a cm, larger sphere radius  b cm 
Apply a charge  q  to sphere radius  a  and a charge –q to sphere radius  b. 
Voltage on inner sphere V = q / (k a) due to its own charge

Induced EMF
V = 4π σ a / ka + 4π σ b / kb  
Capacitance per unit area = σ / V = 1/[4π(a / ka + b / kb) es units 
C = 1.11 x 10-6 /[4π(a / ka + b / kb) μF per square cm 
 
 
 
Co-axial cylinders radius a and b, length L  
Let charge per unit length = σ 
Gauss’s theorem φ 2π r L = 4π σ L 
 
φ = 2 σ / r 
 
F = φ / k = 2 σ / (r k) 
 
V = ∫ F dr from a to b  
    = (2 σ / k) ln (b / a) 
Capacitance C = σ / V = k / [2 ln (b / a) ] in es units 
C = 1.11 x k x 10-6 / [2 ln (b / a) ] μF per cm 
 
 
Example 1 
Calculate the capacitance per kilometer of a lead covered cable where a = 2.5 mm and insulation is 2 mm 
thick and k = 4. Therefore b = 4.5 mm. 
 
Capacitance / cm = 1.11 x 4 x 10–6 / [2 ln (4.5 / 2.5) ] μF 
Capacitance / kilometer = 1.11 x 4 x 10–6 / [2 ln (4.5 / 2.5) ] x 100 x 1000 = 0.38 μF 
 
Example 2 
Calculate the capacitance if the outer 1 mm of the insulation has k = 2 
φ = 2 σ / r throughout the cable. 
For inner 1 mm, F1 = φ /4 = 2 σ /(4 r) 
For outer 1 mm, F2 = φ /2 = 2 σ /(2 r) 
V = ∫ F1 dr from .25 to .35 + ∫ F2 dr from .35 to .45 
    = 2 σ [(1/4) ln(.35/.25) + (1/2)ln(.45/.35)] 
Hence σ / V = 2.37 esu / cm = 2.37 x 105 esu / km 
Capacitance = 1.1 x 10–6 x 2.37 x 105 μF per km = 0.26 μF per km

Induced EMF
Parallel conductors 
The field  at x  from a sphere is  f = q / (k x2) since the area covered by each line of flux is 
proportional to x2 
 
The field at  x  from a long cylinder is f = q / (k L x) since the area covered by each line of 
flux is proportional to x not x2 
 
This is true if the cylinder is isolated and half the electrostatic flux leaves on the opposite side of the 
conductor.  The presence of a second conductor with opposite charge means that all the flux leaves on the 
same side in effect doubling the flield and therefore  f = 2 q / (k L x)  
 
Conductors  A  and  B  are each radius  r  with distance  d  between centres 
Let charge per unit length on A = σ.  Therefore  q = L σ  
And charge per unit length on B = – σ 
Electrostatic field at P in due to A  = 2 σ L / x L k 
Electrostatic field at P in due to B  =  2 σ L / [ L (d – x)] in the same direction 
Therefore  V = ∫ 2 σ L [ 1/x + 1/(d – x) ] dx from r to d – r 
       = 2 σ L [ ln(x) – ln(d – x) ] from r to d – r 
       = 4 σ L [  ln{(d – r) / r }] 
Capacitance  C = σ / V = k / [4  ln {(d – r)/r } ]  in es units per unit length 
C = 1.11  10-6  k / [4 ln {(d – r) / r ]   μF  per cm 
Voltage gradient at distance  x  cm from one of the conductors  
= V d / [x (d – x) ln {(d – r) / r} ] volts/cm 
Where V is difference in potential of the conductors in Volts,  d cm is the distance between the conductor 
centres and r cm is the radius of each conductor  
 
Energy stored in a capacitor 
Work done in increasing the charge by δq = V δq 
But 
q = C V 
 
δq = C δV 
Work done = CV δV 
Energy stored ∫ CV dV from V = 0 to V = V 
Energy stored = (1/2) C V2 where energy is in joules, C is in farads and V is in volts 
 
Capacitor discharged through a resistance 
At time t, q = Cv and v = iR and i = dq/dt 
q = CR dq/dt 
Integrate from q0 to q, CR ln(q/q0 ) = – t 
q = CR i, therefore      CR ln( i/i0 ) = – t hence i = i0 e– (1/CR) t  
The current decays exponentially with a time constant T = CR

Capacitor charged through a resistance from a supply at constant voltage V 
When t = 0, q = 0 
At time t, q = Cv and V = iR + q/C and i = dq/dt 
q/CR + dq/dt = V/R 
Multiply by the integrating factor e(1/CR)  t 
d/dt[ q e(1/CR)  t ] = (V/R) e(1/CR)  t 
 
Integrating 
q e(1/CR)  t = (V/R) (CR) e(1/CR)  t  + constant = (CV) e(1/CR)  t   + constant 
When t = 0, q = 0 therefore constant = – CV 
q = CV [ 1 – e– (1/CR)  t ]  
The charge rises exponentially with a time constant T = CR towards Q = CV

Internal resistance of a cell  
The current I in a circuit of resistance R connected to a cell of voltage E and internal resistance r is  
I = E/(R + r) 
If V is the voltage across R 
then V = IR 
hence r = (E – V)/I 
E is the voltage on open circuit and can be measured with a potentiometer 
hence r can be found. 
 
 
 
Alternatively; 
If I1 is the current with Resistance R1 and I2 is the current with Resistance R2 
Then  I1 ( R1 + r) = E = I2 (R2 + r) 
Thus 
r = (I2 R2 – I1 R1) / (I1 – I2) 
 
Resistances in series 
V1 = I R1 
V2 = I R2         
V = I R  
 
V = V1 + V2  
I R = I R1 + I R2  
Hence R = R1 + R2  
 
 
 
Resistances in parallel  
V = I1 R1 
V = I2 R2 
V = I R  
I1 = V / R1 
I2 = V / R2 
I1 + I2 = I =V / R 
V / R = V / R + V / R2 
R = 1 / [ (1 / R1) + ( 1 / R2)]

Kirchoff’s first law 
The total current leaving any portion of a network is equal to the total current entering that portion. 
 
Kirchoff’s second law 
The algebraic sum of all the “IR” drops around any circuit is equal to the total emf applied in that circuit.  
 
Example 1 
In the diagram, 
E1 – I 1r1 = V = I2 R 
E2 – (I2 – I1) r2 = V = I2 R 
 
 
 
Hence I 1 = (E1 – I2 R) / r1 
E2 +I1 r2 = I2 (R + r2) 
E2 +(E1 – I2 R) r2 /r1 = I2 (R + r2) 
E1 r2 + E2 r1= I2 (R r1 +R r2 + r1r2 ) 
I2 = (E1 r2 + E2 r1)/( R r1 +R r2 + r1r2 ) 
 
Example 2 
Each edge of a tetrahedron is resistance R 
Find the resistance between adjacent corners. 
 
By symmetry, four bars carry I1 , one bar carries zero and 
the sixth carries I – 2I1  
V = I1R + I1R therefore I1 = V / (2R) 
V = (I – 2 I1)R = IR – V 
2V = IR 
Resistance between adjacent corners = V/I = R/2

Thevenin’s Theorem 
To find the current in a resistance r, a branch of a network, remove the branch and find the voltage E 
across the ends of the branch. Short circuit all sources of emf and find the resistance R of the network 
between the ends of the branch with the branch removed. The current in the branch is E / (R + r). 
 
Example 
Find the current in branch QS 
All values are in ohms. 
 
 
 
4 ohm resistor in parallel with 1 and 2  
equals 1/(1/4 + 1/3) = 12/7 
Remove QS and  
voltage between Q and S = E (5 + 12/7) / (8 + 12/7) = 0.691 E 
Resistance between Q and S = 1/[1/3 +1/(5 + 12/7)] = 2.074 
Current in QS = 0.691 E / (2.074 + 2) = 0.170 E

Wheatstone Bridge 
A Wheatstone Bridge consists of four resistances connected as shown. D is a galvanometer to detect any 
current. 
 
If the galvanometer cannot detect any current, then P/Q = R/S.  
 
For example, P, Q and R are resistances that can be switched to any value within a range. An unknown 
resistance S is connected and P, Q and R adjusted till the galvanometer shows the bridge to be balanced. 
Hence the value of S can be found. 
 
 
 
Potentiometer  
A voltage V connected internally through a high resistance cannot be measured by a meter. As soon as the 
meter takes current, the voltage drops. 
A potentiometer allows the voltage to be measured without taking any current. A dc supply and voltmeter 
E are connected across a uniformly wound rheostat 
The slider is connected to the unknown voltage through a galvanometer D. The slider is adjusted till the 
galvanometer shows no current. 
 
V = E L1 / (L1 + L2) 
As no current is flowing from V, there is no volt drop in its resistance. 
 
The output from a thermocouple which measures temperature is usually connected to a potentiometer. The 
voltage is small (in the order of millivolts) and any resistance drop would introduce a significant error.

Alternating Current (AC)
Alternating Current (AC)
 
Generating an AC voltage 
The coil, area A, is rotated in a uniform magnetic field B at constant angular velocity  
the flux linking the coil is Ф = BA Cos θ  
hence Фmax = BA and Ф = Фmax Cos θ 
The coil is rotated at constant speed , thus θ = t 
emf  e = – N d(Фmax Cos t )/dt  
 
           = N Фmax  Sin t 
 
           = Ep Sin t 
where Ep is the maximum value of e  
 
 
 
when this emf is applied to a circuit, the current flows in one direction for half a cycle then flows in the 
reverse direction for the next half cycle. This is called Alternating Current. Throughout the world, mains 
electricity is normally AC. 
 
 
 
 
Average value 
The average value for a full cycle is zero 
 
Integrate over a half cycle to obtain the average value for half a cycle 
 
Emean  =  ∫ Ep  Sin  d  from 0 to   =  Ep  [– Cos from 0 to 

2 (1– Cos 2 d from 0 to 2

2 [– Sin 2from 0 to 2 
 
= ½ Ep
2 ( 2 – 0 – 0 + 0) =  Ep
2 
 
Hence average value of e2 = ½ Ep
2 
Take the square root to obtain the rms value 
 
Erms = Ep / / 2 = 0.707 Ep 
The power of an electrical circuit is proportional to e2 hence the use of the Erms value Unless stated 
otherwise, the value given for an AC voltage or current is the rms value. A DC voltage is equivalent to an 
AC voltage with the same rms value. 
 
Peak factor and Form factor 
Peak factor = (peak value) / ( rms value) 
Form factor = (rms value) / (av value for ½ cycle) 
 
Sine wave form factor = (0.707) / ( 0.636 Ep) = 1.11 
 
Triangular wave form E = Ep θ/ ( π /2) between 0 and π /2 
Eav =  0.5 Ep 
 
Erms = Ep  √[ ∫ {θ2 / ( π /2) 2 } d θ / ( π /2)] 
with the integral from 0 to π /2 
 
Erms = Ep  / ( π /2) 3/2   √[ ∫ θ2 d θ ] 
Erms = Ep  / ( π /2) 3/2   √[  θ3 /3 d θ ] from 0 to π /2 
Erms = Ep  / ( π /2) 3/2   √[ (π /2)3 /3]  = Ep /√3 = 0.577 Ep  
Triangular wave Form factor = 0.577 Ep / 0.5 Ep = 1.15 
 
Square wave Eav = Ep and Erms = Ep 
Square wave form factor = Ep/Ep 1 
 
Summarising 
Sine wave form factor = 1.11 
 
peak factor = √2 = 1.41 
Square wave form factor = 1 
 
peak factor = 1 
Triangular wave form factor = 1.15 
peak factor = √3 = 1.73 
Thus the form factor is a measure of how peaky the wave is.

Average value for ½ cycle = 2 x 200/3 = 133 volts 
 
rms value = √[{2 x ∫2002 (t/T)2dt + 2002xT}/π] where the integral is from 0 to T 
 
   = √[2002 x { 2 t3 /( 3T 2) + T}]/π where the integral is from 0 to T 
 
   = √[2002 x { 2T3 /( 3T 2) + T}]/π = 200 x √ [ 5T/3]/π  where T = π/3 
 
   = √[2002 x {5π / 9}/π] = √2002 x [ 5 / 9] 
 
   = 200 x √5 / 3 = 149 volts 
Form factor = rms value /average value = 149 / 133 = 1.12 
 
Frequency 
The number of complete cycles per second is the frequency in Hertz (Hz) 
Mains electricity is at a frequency of 50 Hz in Europe and 60 Hz in America. 
 
e = Ep Sin t so the time taken for N cycles is given by T = 2 N 
 
Therefore T = 2 N /  But the time taken for N cycles = N / f  
Hence N / f = 2 N /  thus  = 2 f 
 
AC voltage E = Ep Sin 2ft)

Alternating Current (AC)
Vector representation of AC 
 
 
 
Let the vector Vp rotate anti-clockwise at a speed of ω radians/sec. 
The projection of Vp on a vertical is sinusoidal with respect to time. 
 
Let another vector Ip at an angle of  with Vp also rotate anti-clockwise at  
the same speed of ω radians/sec. 
The projection of Ip on the vertical is sinusoidal displaced  behind of Vp. 
 
 
 
The vectors Vp and Ip represent the two sinusoidal quantities.  
Thus alternating currents and voltages can be represented by vectors. 
 
Addition of two AC voltages or two AC currents 
Let V1 and V2 be two AC voltages at the same frequency but of different magnitude and phase angle.  
V1 = Vp1 Sin (ωt + θ1) and V2 = Vp2 Sin (ωt + θ2) 
V1+V2=Vp1[Sin ωt Cosθ1 + Cos ωt Sinθ1] + Vp2[Sin ωt Cosθ2 + Cos ωt Sinθ2] 
= Sin ωt [Vp1 Cosθ1 + Vp2 Cosθ2] + Cos ωt [Vp1 Sinθ1 + Vp2 Sinθ2] 
Put V1+V2=Vp3[Sin ωt Cosθ3] 
 
     = Sin ωt (Vp3 Cosθ3)  + Cos ωt (Vp3 Sinθ3) 
Thus [Vp1 Cosθ1 + Vp2 Cosθ2] = Vp3 Cosθ3 
And  [Vp1 Sinθ1 + Vp2 Sinθ2] = Vp3 Sinθ3 
 
Inspection of the vector diagram of the two voltages shows that this result could have been obtained 
directly from the vector diagram.

tan θ3 = Vp3 Sinθ3 / (Vp3 Cosθ3)  
  = [Vp1 Sinθ1 + Vp2 Sinθ2] / [Vp1 Cosθ1 + Vp2Cosθ2] 
 
and Vp3  = √[(Vp3 Sinθ3)2  +  (Vp3 Cosθ3)2] 
  = √[(Vp1 Sinθ1 + Vp2 Sinθ2)2  + (Vp1 Cosθ1 + Vp2 Cosθ2) 2] 
 
If two AC voltages V1 and V2 (at the same frequency but different phase) are added together, the result is 
another AC voltage whose magnitude is the vector addition V1 + V2. 
 
Similarly if two AC currents I1 and I2 (at the same frequency but different phase) are added together, the 
result is another AC current whose magnitude is the vector addition I1 + I2. 
 
The vectors have been shown as the peak value of the vector. However the rms value of a sine wave is 
always 1/√2 times the peak value. Thus the vector diagram of the rms values is exactly the same to a 
different scale as the vector diagram for the peak values. 
 
The vector diagrams of voltage and current are therefore the rms values unless otherwise stated. 
 
Power in a single phase AC circuit 
The power in an AC circuit is the product of Volts and Amps. 
Let the phase angle between voltage and current be φ. 
 
Let v = Vp Sin x  and  i  = Ip  Sin (x + φ ) 
w = Vp Ip Sin x Sin (x + φ ) 
    = Vp Ip Sin x (Sin x Cos φ + Cos x Sin φ ) 
    = Vp Ip [Sin2 x Cos φ + (1/2) Sin 2x Sin φ] 
The mean value of Sin 2x over a complete cycle is zero, 
w = Vp Ip Cos φ Sin2 x  
The mean value of  Sin2 x = (1/2π ) ∫Sin2 x dx from 0 to 2π 
 
 
                = (1/2π ) ∫[1 – Cos 2x)/2] dx from 0 to 2π 
 
 
                = (1/4π ) [x – Sin 2x] from 0 to 2π 
                = (1/4π ) [2π – 0 – 0 + 0] = ½ 
But Vp Ip = 2Vrms Irms  
Hence W = Vrms Irms Cos φ 
Using the rms values W = V I Cos φ  
 
 
 
This can be written by the vector equation W = V ●I 
Cos φ is called the power factor (or pf).

Three phase system 
If the generator has three coils at 1200 spacing, three voltages will be produced with a phase angle of 1200 
between them. 
 
 
 
If each voltage is connected to a circuit with the same power factor and the three currents return along the 
same conductor, then the vector sum of the three return currents is zero. Thus instead of three full sized 
return cables, only one of smaller size is needed. If none of the load is single phase, then the neutral is not 
needed at all. High voltage supplies are nearly always three phase without a neutral conductor. There is a 
great economy in distribution costs if the electricity can be supplied in three phases.  
 
The vector diagram shows the common return point, called the Neutral point, at N and a three phase 
supply with voltages VA, VB and VC. 
 
These are called the phase voltages or Vph.

Alternating Current (AC)
The voltages V1, V2 and V3 are called the line voltages or Vline. 
 
It can be seen by the 300 and 600 triangles that the magnitude of the line voltage is √3 times the magnitude 
of the phase voltage. 
 
The voltage of a three phase supply is defined by the line voltage. 
 
Thus a 415 volt three phase supply can provide three separate 240 volt single phase domestic supplies . 
 
If all three phases have currents of the same magnitude and power factor, then the total power  
W = 3 Vph I Cos φ = √3 Vline I Cos φ 
W = √3 Vline I Cos φ 
 
Power to a balanced three phase system is constant 
Ea Ia = E Sin (ωt) x I Sin (ωt – φ) 
Eb Ib = E Sin (ωt + 1200) x I Sin (ωt + 1200 – φ) 
Ec Ic = E Sin (ωt – 1200) x I Sin (ωt – 1200 – φ) 
 
Sin A Sin B = ½[Cos(A – B) – Cos(A + B)] 
Ea Ia = ½E I[Cos(φ) – Cos(2ωt – φ)] 
Eb Ib = ½E I[Cos(φ) – Cos(2ωt + 2400 – φ)] 
Ec Ic = ½E I[Cos(φ) – Cos(2ωt - 2400 – φ)] 
W = Ea Ia + Eb Ib + Ec Ic 
= ½E I[3 Cos(φ) – Cos(2ωt – φ) – [Cos(2ωt + 2400 – φ) + Cos(2ωt - 2400 – φ)]] 
CosA + Cos B = 2 Cos{(A + B)/2} Cos{(A – B)/2} 
W = ½E I[3 Cos(φ) – Cos(2ωt – φ) – 2{Cos(2ωt – φ) Cos (4800)} 
Cos (4800) = – 1/2 
Hence W = ½ EI 3 Cos(φ) where E and I are peak values per phase 
E = √2 Erms   and I = √2 Irms   
W = 3 Erms Irms Cos(φ) where Erms  is the phase voltage 
W = √3 Erms Irms Cos(φ) where Erms  is the line voltage

Alternating Current (AC)
W1 reads the vector dot product (Va – Vb)●Ia 
 
W1 = (Va – Vb)●Ia 
W2 = (Vc – Vb)●Ic 
W1 + W2 = Va●Ia –Vb●(Ia + Ic) + Vc●Ic 
For a three wire system, Ia + Ib + Ic = 0 
W1 + W2 = Va●Ia + Vb●Ib + Vc●Ic = total power in the three phases 
The sum of two wattmeter readings gives the power in a three phase three wire system. The phases do not 
need to carry the same current or have the same power factor. 
 
If the load is an electric motor, the voltages are usually balanced 
 
Power Factor measurement by two wattmeters. 
Three phase system with the currents and power factors the same on each phase. In this case, the power 
factor can be obtained from the two wattmeter readings. 
 
 
 
W1 = Va Ia Cos φ – Vb Ia Cos(1200 - φ )  
W2 = Vc Ic Cos φ – Vb Ic Cos(1200 + φ ) 
Vc Ic Cos φ = (W1 + W2)/3 
Vb Ic Cos(1200 + φ ) 
= V I [Cos1200 Cos φ -Sin1200 Sin φ ] 
  
= V I Cos φ [(–1/2) – (√3/2) Tan φ ] 
  
= [(W1 + W2)/3] [(-1/2) ) – (√3/2) Tan φ ] 
hence 
W2 = [(W1 + W2)/3] [(3/2) ) + (√3/2) Tan φ ] 
2 W2 = (W1 + W2) + (1/√3) (W1 + W2) Tan φ  
W2 - W1 = (1/√3) (W1 + W2) Tan φ 
 
Tan φ = √3 (W2 – W1) / (W1 + W2) 
Power factor = Cos φ = 1/ √[ 1 + Tan 2 φ ]

Machine Rating 
Generators, Motors and Transformers are rated in kVA or MVA.  
 
Suppose two machines are identical except that one machine operates on twice the voltage of the other. 
The higher voltage machine has twice the number of turns on the winding. The machines are the same size 
so the volume of the windings is the same on both machines. The higher voltage machine therefore has 
each coil approximately twice the length and half the cross sectional area of the other machine. The 
resistance of the higher voltage winding is therefore about four times the resistance of the lower voltage 
machine. For the same I2R heat loss, the higher voltage machine has half the current. 
 
Therefore the higher voltage machine is rated for twice the voltage and half the current. Thus both 
machines are the same kVA rating. Thus the kVA or MVA rating is a guide to the physical size of the 
machine and does not depend on the actual voltage or current rating. 
 
For a three phase machine kVA = √3 x (rated kV) x (rated amps) 
Rated power in kW = (rated kVA) x (Cos φ) where Cos φ is the design power factor 
 
Harmonics 
Power from an AC generators often contains harmonics, eg due to fluctuations caused by the slots in the 
generator rotor and stator. Any harmonics are usually odd harmonics since a wave that is symmetrical 
about π/2 can contain odd harmonics but not even harmonics.  
 
The third harmonic is in phase in all three phases thus third harmonic returns through the neutral do not 
cancel, they add together. Problems in a neutral are often due to third harmonics. 
 
If however a supply containing the third harmonic is connected to the delta winding of a transformer, the 
third harmonic voltages are in phase at each end of each delta winding. No third harmonic currents flow in 
the primary delta winding and none appear in the secondary.

AC Current through a Resistance 
When an AC voltage is applied to a pure resistance, 
at any instant, v = iR 
 
 
 
Vrms = IrmsR 
where Vrms is in volts, Irms is in amps and R is in ohms 
I is in phase with V 
 
However the Resistance is higher on AC than on DC. This is due to eddy currents causing a power loss. 
I2R = copper loss + eddy current loss.

Resistance, Inductance and Capacitance on AC
Eddy Currents in a conductor  
A conductor, radius a metres carries a current I Sin(pt) amps 
H outside the conductor is (2I/r) Sin (pt) 10-7 
where r is the distance in metres from the centre of the conductor 
 
 
 
At the surface of the conductor 
 
H = (2I/a) Sin (pt) 10-7 
At the centre of the conductor, H = 0 
Thus inside the conductor 
 
H = (2I r/a2 ) Sin (pt) 10-7 
 
Let σ be the eddy current in amps/m2 at radius r metres 
and σ0 be the current in amps/m2 at the centre of the conductor 
 
(σ + σ0 ) ρ = ─ ∂Φ / ∂t  
 
 
    = ─ ∫ [ ∂H / ∂t] dr  from r = 0 to r = r 
 
 
    = ─ ∫ [ (2 p I / a2 ) Cos (pt) ] 10–7 r dr   from r = 0 to r = r 
 
 
    =  (p I r2 / a2 ) Cos (pt) 10–7 
hence  σ =  p I r2 / (ρ a2 ) Cos (pt) 10–7 ─ σ0 
 
But 
2π ∫ σ r dr = 0 from r = 0 to r = a 
 
2π ∫ [p I r2 / (ρ a2 ) Cos (pt) 10–7 ─ σ0 ] r dr = 0    from r = 0 to r = a 
 
2π [p I r4 / (4 ρ a2 ) Cos (pt) 10–7 ─ σ0 r2/2]  = 0   from r = 0 to r = a 
 
p I a2 / (4 ρ ) Cos (pt) 10–7  ─ σ0 a2/2]  = 0 
 
σ0 = p I / (2 ρ ) Cos (pt) 10–7 
 
hence σ =  (p I / ρ ) Cos (pt) [r2 / a2  ─ ½]10–7    and σ = 0 when r = a/√2 
Total current density   i = σ + [ I Sin (pt) ] / (π a2 ) 
Put  [ I Sin (pt) ] / (π a2 ) = C 
 
 
       i2 = σ2  + 2σC + C2 
Energy loss  = 2π ∫ i2  ρ r dr    from r = 0 to r = a 
 
 = 2π ∫ [σ2  + 2σC + C2 ] ρ r dr    from r = 0 to r = a 
But as before,      2π ∫ σ r dr = 0 from r = 0 to r = a 
Therefore  2π ∫ 2 σC ρ r dr = 0 from r = 0 to r = a 
 
Energy loss = 2π ∫ [σ2 + C2 ] ρ r dr from r = 0 to r = a

2π ∫ σ2 ρ r dr = 2π (p2 I2 / ρ ) Cos2 (pt) 10–14 ∫ [r5/a4 ─ r3/a2 +r/4] dr

2 R0 [ 1 + π2p2a4 /(12 ρ2) 10–14 ] 
where a is in metres and ρ is in ohms per metre cube 
hence Rf / R0 = 1 + π2p2a4 /(12 ρ2) 10–14 
but p = 2πf 
 
Rf / R0 = 1 + 100π4f2a4 /(3 ρ2) 
where f is in Hz, a is in metres and ρ is in μΩ per cm cube 
 
Example 
Conductor 1.29 cm radius, 50 Hz, ρ = 1.65 μΩ per cm cube 
   
Rf / R0 = 1 +100 x 3.144 x 502 x (1.29/100)4 /(3 x 1.652 ) 
            =  1.08 
 
AC Current through an Inductor 
Let the inductance be L henries 
 
L di/dt = back emf 
            = applied voltage v 
            =Vp Sin 2f t 
Integrating, 
L i = Vp(1 / 2f ) Cos 2f t + Const 
The constant is a DC current (usually zero) 
 
i = ─ [Vp / (2f L)] Cos 2f t 
 
Irms = Vrms / (2f L) 
 
 
 
But 
Vrms = Irms XL 
 where XL is the reactance of the inductor 
Thus 
XL = 2f L 
At 50 Hz  XL = 314 L 
where XL is in ohms and L is in henries 
The current lags the voltage by 1/4 cycle

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Resistance, Inductance and Capacitance on AC
There is another effect. If the rms current through an iron cored reactor is increased, the reactance falls 
sharply as the iron saturates. If the current is increased in stages from zero and the voltage drop across the 
reactor is measured, the graph will have a kink as shown. This means that applying a fixed voltage Vc to 
the reactor, the current can take any one of three values. One of these values, I2 in the diagram, is unstable 
but the other two are stable. So applying a voltage within the range can lead to either value of current and 
any transient can make the current flip to the other value. 
 
 
 
 
 
AC Current through a Capacitance (or Condenser)  
Let the capacitance be C farads 
Thus the charge q = C v 
where dq/dt = i  amps 
Put 
v =Vp Sin 2f t 
Hence q = C Vp Sin 2f t 
 
 
 
Differentiating wrt t 
i = C Vp 2f Cos 2f t 
Hence Ip = = 2f C Vp  
Irms = Ip / /2 and Vrms = Vp / /2 
Hence Irms = 2f CVrms  
But 
Vrms = Irms XC 
where XC is the reactance of the capacitor in ohms (ie volts/amps) 
Thus 
XC = 1 / (2  f C)  
With C in F then XC = 106 / (2  f C) 
At 50 Hz XC = 3183 / C 
where XC is in ohms and C is in F

The current is established over several cycles, 
but it then lags by 3/4 cycle.

(ii)

(i) X = 314 x 0.12 = 37.7 ohms    I = V/X = 6.37 amps 
(ii) X = 3183/40 = 79.6 ohms       I = V/X = 3.02 amps

Series and Parallel Circuits 
 
Resistance, Inductance and Capacitance in series 
Let a circuit consist of a Resistor, Inductor and a Capacitor is series all carrying an AC current I 
 
 
 
VR is in phase with I, VC lags I by 900 and VL leads I by 900 
VR = IR and VL = j IXL  and VC = – j IXC  
where XL and XC are the reactances of L and C 
 
 
 
These voltages can be represented by vectors 
on the same diagram as I 
It can be seen from the vector diag that 
V2 = VR
2 + (VC – VL)2 
And the current leads the voltage by 
arc tan [(VC – VL)/ VR] = arc tan [(XC – XL)/R] 
 
Where a circuit contains reactance and resistance, the combination is called impedance. The symbol for 
impedance is Z and the units are ohms. 
 
V = I Z 
 
IZ = IR + j IXL – j IXC 
Thus  Z I = [R + j XL – j XC] I 
ie Z can be considered an operator Z = [R + j XL – j XC]  
 
Magnitude of Z =√ [R2 + (XL – XC)2 ] by pythagoras, see the vector diagram.

Z has a minimum whem j 2πf L = j /(2πf C) and this minimum value of Z is R 
This occurs at the Resonant Frequency 
f0 = 1 /[ 2π √( LC) ] 
 
The reactance of the coil at resonance = 2π f0 L = √( L / C) 
 
If a variable frequency supply at a constant voltage is applied to the circuit, a plot of current against f will 
be of the form shown.  
 
The exact shape depends on the relative values of R and L, ie on the Q factor of the coil where 
Q factor = reactance at resonance / R = [ √( L/C) ]/R  
 
 
 
At a frequency (f0 + δf ) near resonance, 
Z =  R + j 2π(f0 +  δf ) L – j /[2π(f0 +  δf ) C] 
    =  R + j 2πf0 L + j 2πδf  L – j /[2πf0 C(1 +  δf/ f0 )] 
    =  R + j 2πf0 L + j 2πδf  L – [j /(2πf0 C)](1 –  δf/ f0 ) 
    =  R  + j 2πδf  L + [j /(2πf0 C)]( δf/ f0 ) 
    =  R  + j 2πδf  L + [j 2πf0 L)]( δf/ f0 ) 
    =  R  + j 4πδf  L 
Hence near resonance, I = V /( R + j 4πLδf ) 
Phase angle changes rapidly from positive to negative as resonance is passed. 
 
Resistances, Inductances and Capacitances in series on an AC supply 
 
 
 
Let the circuit be equivalent to a single resistance R and a single reactance X 
 
By inspection of the vector diagram of voltages, it can be seen that  
R = R1 + R2  
and  
X = XL1 – XC1 + XL2 – XC2  
If X is positive then X is an inductance 
If X is negative then X is a capacitance.

Thus in a circuit containing resistances and reactances in series,

And

Hence (R1 + j X1) / (R3 + jX3) = (R2 + j X2) / (R4 + jX4)

B – H Curves 
 
 
 
The graph shows typical B-H curves for some common magnetic materials. 
 
The gradient near the origin is a measure of the permeability μ. 
 
For many materials 
H = α B1.6 in the range 0.5 to 1.2 tesla 
 
μ = B / H 
where B is in tesla and H = 1.26 x (NI/m)] x 10-6 
 
Hence  
μ = [B / {1.26 x (Ampere Turns/cm)} ] x 104 
Thus for Dynamo Cast Steel, μ is about [ 1 / (1.26 x 5) ] x 104 = 1600

Magnetic Properties of Materials
Hysteresis 
 
 
 
When a magnetic material is magnetized, it retains some magnetism when the magnetizing force is 
switched off. If H is raised from zero to a positive value then reduced to the same value negative and again 
to the positive, the magnetic field B lags behind the magnetising force. This is called the hysteresis loop. 
The area of the loop is a measure of work done in magnetizing the iron through this cycle. 
 
The graph shows the hysteresis loops for Dynamo Cast Steel and for Silicon Iron (Stalloy). The Stalloy is 
the inner loop. As the area is a measure of the energy loss per cycle, the Stalloy has less energy loss per 
cycle than the Dynamo Cast Steel. 
 
Flux Temperature relation 
With a constant Magnetizing Force, the Flux rises slightly with Temperature till about  
600 0C and then falls rapidly to zero at the Curie point. 
 
 
 
Energy spent in Hysteresis 
Consider a laminated ring of the material, cross sectional area A cm2 and circumference of the ring L cms. 
The ring has a coil of N turns taking a current i emu at time t. 
 
H = 4π N i / L  
 
(H in oersted, i in emu and L in cm) 
Power taken = copper loss + loss in field 
Loss in field = ei

But 
e = – N dΦ / dt = – N A dB / dt 
Energy put into the field in time δt 
= e i δt ergs

Energy put into the field in element of time = (1/4π)  H  L  A  δB ergs 
Energy put into the field in finite time = (1/4π)  L  A  ∫H δB ergs 
L  A = volume of the core material in cc 
∫H δB over one cycle = area of the hysteresis loop 
 
Hence Energy loss due to hysteresis = (1/4π) (area of hysteresis loop) ergs / cycle / cc 
where the hysteresis loop is in oersteds/cm and gauss 
 
Let AT be the ampere turns / metre 
AT / 100 is the ampere turns / cm 
AT / 1000 is the emu of current turns / cm 
H in oersted = 4π AT / 1000 
Let F be the flux density in tesla 
Flux density in gauss = 104 F 
Area of the hysteresis loop in oersted and gauss = 4π AT F x 10 
Hence Energy loss due to hysteresis 
 
= (1/4π) (4π AT F x 10) ergs / cycle / cc 
 
= AT F x 10 x 106 ergs / cycle / cubic metre 
 
= AT F joules / cycle / m3 
At frequency f cycles/sec 
Power loss = f x (area of hysteresis loop) watts/ cubic metre 
where the hysteresis loop is in tesla and ampere turns / metre 
 
Example 
Steel used for an armature has a B-H curve of area 4 sq ins for the relevant cycle. Bmax = 1 tesla. Scales 1” 
= 2 oersted, 1” = 0.5 tesla 
Find the approx hysteresis loss if stampings weigh 200 lb 
Machine has 4 poles and runs at 600 rpm. 
 
H = (4π/10) NI/cm = [(4π/1000) (AmpTurns/metre)] oersted 
 
Area of hysteresis loop = 4 x 2 x 0.5 = 4 oersted x tesla 
 
 
 
= 4 x 1000 /(4π) (Amp Turns/metre) x tesla 
 
 
 
= 318.3 joules / cu metre 
 
Volume of steel = 200 x 453.6/7.7 cubic cms = 0.01176 cu metres 
Cycles per sec = 2 x 600 / 60 = 20 cycles / sec 
 
Hysteresis loss = 318.3 x 0.01176 x 20 joules/sec = 74.9 watts

Empirical formula 
Iron loss = eddy current loss + hysteresis loss 
 
 = K1 f2 B2 + K2 f B1.6 
where K1 and K2 are constants, f is the number of cycles / sec (or rps) and B is the flux density in the 
range 0.5 to 1.2 tesla. 
K2 depends on the material and is typically in range 500 – 5000 watts/cu metre 
 
Electromagnet  
Let A = total area of pole faces in contact in m2, assume North and South faces are equal. 
 B = Flux density in the gap in tesla 
 z = air gap in metres 
 
 
 
Let the gap be widened by δz metres and the current in the coil increased by δI to keep the flux density 
constant in the air gap. 
 
There is no change in the flux turns linked with the winding. 
Therefore no emf set up in the winding 
Therefore no power change in the winding except for the I2R loss.  
 
In the non magnetic air gap, 
energy stored = B2 x 107 / (8 π ) joules per cubic metre. 
 
Increase in energy stored in the air gap = (A δx) B2 x 107 / (8 π ) 
This must have come from mechanical work done = P δx joules 
 
 
Hence Pull P = B2 x 107 / (8 π ) newtons per m2  
 
where B is in tesla 
 
Example 
The total loss in a cylindrical core of steel stampings running at 400 rpm in a given field is 300 watts. At 
600 rpm in the same field, loss is 525 watts. Estimate how much of loss at 400 rpm is due to hysteresis. 
Let W1 be hysteresis loss and W2 be eddy current loss at 400 rpm 
Then W1 + W2 = 300 
At 600 rpm, W1 x 600/400 + W2 x [600/400]2 = 525 
 
W1 x 400/600 + W2 = 525 x [400/600]2 = 233 
 
W1 x 1/3 = 300 – 233 
 
W1 = 200 and W2 = 100 watts 
A new core is made of stampings 1.5 times the thickness, other dimensions unchanged. Estimate the iron 
loss in a flux density 20% higher and at 500 rpm. 
 
New hysteresis loss = 200 x (120/100)1.6 x (500/400) = 335 watts

New eddy current loss = 100 x (120/100)2 x (500/400)2 x (1.5)2 = 506 
 
Total loss = 840 watts 
 
Example 
At flux density B, the iron loss for Stalloy sheet 0.014” thick 
at 50 Hz is 0.89 watts/lb and at 100 Hz is 2.17 watts/lb 
Estimate the hysteresis loss at 50 hz and the total loss at 100 hz of 0.02” sheet 
Let W1 be hysteresis loss and W2 be the eddy current loss at 50 hz 
W1 + W2 = 0.89 watts/lb 
W1 x (100/50) + W2 x (100/50)2 = 2.17 watts/lb 
W2 = (2.17 – 2 x 0.89)/2 = 0.195 and W1 = 0.89 – 0.195 = 0.695 
 
New hysteresis loss = 0.695 x (100/50) = 1.39 watts/lb  
New eddy current loss = 0.195 x (100/50) 2 x (0.02/0.014)2 = 1.59 watts/lb 
Total loss = 2.98 watts/lb

DC Motors and Generators 
 
DC machines 
DC Machines are usually built with the field magnetic circuit in the stator, through the Yoke, Pole Body 
and Pole Shoe. Field windings are round the pole body. 
 
 
 
The rotor is made up of stampings, ie laminations of low hysteresis steel. Dynamo sheet steel is often used. 
 
The armature windings are on the rotor and are put in slots on the laminated core and held in place by 
strips of insulating material. Each slot usually contains two layers, half a coil in each layer. The coil may 
be anything from a single conductor to a multitude of turns. The whole assembly is then impregnated with 
varnish to remove air and prevent any movement. 
 
 
 
The rotor windings are connected to the commutator. The commutator is made with copper strips that 
have a wedge shaped cross section. These are stacked together with insulation between the strips. The 
assembly is clamped together onto the shaft between two discs each having a tapered flange. Each 
segment has a strip of copper or steel soldered in a slot in the segment to connect the segment to the 
windings. 
 
 
 
The connection to the commutator is by the “brushes”. These are carbon or graphite blocks spring loaded 
to rub against the commutator.

Back emf distribution 
As one conductor moves past the pole face, an emf is induced in this conductor proportional to the flux 
density.  
 
The armature contains many conductors in series spaced round the armature. The emf in each follows the 
same pattern. The total due to all the conductors in series is the mean value times the number of 
conductors.  
 
 
    
 
 
Total back emf. 
In one revolution, each conductor on the rotor cuts the magnetic flux of each pole once. Poles are always 
in pairs, a North and a South pole. 
Let there be p pairs of poles each with a magnetic flux Φ weber. 
Therefore each conductor cuts 2pΦ of magnetic flux in one revolution. 
Assume that the conductor is connected to the commutator so that the emf generated is the same polarity 
under a North pole as under a South pole. 
In one second, each conductor cuts a flux of 2pΦ x (revolutions per second). 
Emf generated in one conductor = webers cut per second = 2pΦ (rps) 
Let there be ZS conductors connected in series 
Back emf = 2p Φ ZS (rps) volts 
Power in a DC machine 
 
Power = (back emf) x (Armature Current) 
 
Power = E Ia watts 
 
            = 2p Φ ZS Ia (rps) watts 
 
Torque of a DC machine 
But Power in watts = (Torque in newton metres) x (2π rps) 
 
Torque = 2p Φ ZS Ia / (2π )  newton metres 
 
             = E Ia /[2π x (rps )]  newton metres 
 
             = 0.117 x 2p Φ ZS Ia  lb ft 
 
             = 0.117 E Ia  / (rps) lb ft

DC Motor Shunt Connected 
  
 
 
DC Shunt Motors have a field winding of many turns switched directly to the supply. The flux Φ is the 
flux due to the field current If where If = V/Rf . 
V/Rf is constant, hence the flux Φ is constant. 
In the armature circuit V = E + Ia Ra  
hence the armature current is given by Ia = (V - E) / Ra 
Substitute for E, 
Ia = (V - 2p Φ Zs n ) / Ra where n is the speed in rps 
T = 2p Φ Zs Ia / (2π ) where T is the Torque in newton metres 
 
Thus (Output torque + torque due to losses) is proportional to Ia and Φ 
Substitute for Ia,  
T = 2p Φ Zs (V – 2p Φ Zs n ) / (2π Ra ) 
[(2π Ra ) / (2p Φ Zs)]T = V – 2p Φ Zs n  
n = [V / (2p Φ Zs )] – [(2π Ra ) / (2p Φ Zs)2 ] T 
n = n0 – m T  
where n is the speed in rps and T is the input torque in newton metres 
ie Torque = output torque + torque loss due to eddy currents, hysteresis, bearing friction, windage and 
brush friction. 
and n0 = [V / (2p Φ Zs )] is the speed in rps when T = 0 
and m = [(2π Ra ) / (2p Φ Zs)2 ] is the gradient of the n - T curve 
 
 
Ra is small, hence DC shunt motors run at nearly constant speed whatever the torque. They are used where 
a constant speed is required, eg to drive rolling mills, pit winding gear, machine tools etc.

DC Motors and Generators
This is a hyperbola of [1 + Q n ]2 against T 
The starting torque (n = 0) is T = 2p K Zs V2 /(2πR2 ) 
 
On light load, (ie T nearly zero) n is very high. 
 
DC Series Motors have a high torque at low speed which makes them suitable for traction motors or 
starter motors for petrol and diesel engines.. They are not suitable for applications where they may be run 
without load as they may overspeed. 
 
DC Compound Connected 
A combination of Series and Shunt fields can give an alternative Speed/Torque relationship. For example, 
a shunt motor with a few turns on the field series connected in opposition to the shunt field can give a 
truly constant speed whatever the torque. 
 
Armature Reaction 
The current in the armature of a DC machine causes a magnetising force in a direction between the pole 
faces. This increases the magnetising force on part of the pole and reduces the magnetising force on the 
other part by the same amount. Due to saturation of the field magnetic circuit, the increase in flux in part 
of the pole is less than the decrease in the other part of the pole. Thus the effect of armature reaction is to 
give an overall reduction in flux. The magnetic field across the pole face is distorted and the neutral point 
is moved. 
 
 
 
The effect can be reduced by; 
(i) Compensating windings on the stator connected in series with the armature. These are connected 
to give a field in opposition to the armature reaction. They can be installed on the pole face close 
to the armature conductors to almost completely eliminate armature reaction. 
(ii) A deep slot in the pole face that puts an air gap in the field due to armature reaction but not in the 
main field. 
(iii)Increased air gap on pole face. 
 
Compensating Winding 
Compensating windings are additional windings on the field that are connected in series with the armature 
and exactly oppose the armature reaction. 
 
Interpoles 
The current reversal is impeded by the self inductance of the winding. Lenz’s law means that the change is 
opposed. Large DC Motors often have Interpoles. These are small poles, connected in series with the 
armature, sited between the main poles. Their purpose is to induce a voltage in the winding when the 
current reversal occurs. This voltage is arranged to oppose the self induced emf and assist the current 
reversal.

The brush short circuits each coil as the commutator passes the brush. Without the interpole, the current 
decays exponentially.  
 
  
 
 
The interpole increases the decay and induces a current in the opposite direction. If L henries is the self 
inductance of the coil and T seconds is the time it is short circuited, then the interpole  
must induce an emf of 2IL/T volts. 
 
For good commutation, the interpole winding is connected in series with the armature and has a large air 
gap to reduce the effect of saturation. 
 
The self inductance of the coils can be reduced at the design stage by more commutator bars and more 
slots and fewer turns. Higher resistance brushes help as do wider brushes which increase the overlap. 
Without interpoles, moving the brush position so the coil picks up some of the main field can reduce 
sparking but a different position is needed for a different load. 
 
If the voltage induced by the interpoles is too high, moving the brush position will reduce it. Altering the 
interpole air gap by packing behind the pole or by machining the face will increase or reduce the induced 
voltage 
 
The effect of an interpole is not dependent on speed or load or on whether the machine is acting as a motor 
or generator.  
 
The interpole windings oppose armature reaction, but the interpole introduces a magnetic path for the 
armature reaction mmf. Thus the interpole does not eliminate armature reaction and may even increase it.

A DC Generator has coils with estimated self inductance L = 8E-6 henries and resistance 0.001 ohms. 
From the speed of rotation and brush and commutator dimensions, it is calculated that the coil is short 
circuited for 0.001 secs. Armature current = 180 amps. 
 
I = 180 e-R/L t = 180 e-(1/8) = 0.882 x 180 = 159

Average volts required = L di/dt = 8E-6 x 2 x 180/ 0.001 = 2.88 volts 
Introduce 2.88 volts by interpoles, then – Ldi/dt – e = iR 
-8E-6 di/dt – 2.88 = 0.001 i 
Solving, i = 180 at t = 0 and i = -172 at t = 0.001  
 
Example 
A 4 pole lap wound generator has 516 conductors and the length of the interpole air gap is 0.4 cms. The 
maximum flux density under the interpole is to be 0.2 tesla when the armature current is 30 amps. 
Estimate the turns on each interpole. 
 
Number of conductors under one main pole is 516/4 = 129 
Number of armature paths number of poles = 4 
Current in each armature conductor = 30/4 = 7.5 
 
∫H dl = (2000 x 0.4) x 2 poles + 0 
 
         = (4π/10) { N x 30 x 2 – (516/4) x ( 30/4) 
60 N = 1273 + 968 
N = 37 
ie 16 turns to combat armature reaction + 21 turns to give required mmf

Example 
6 pole 200 kW 500 volt generator 550 rpm, armature winding 75 cms diameter, active length 20 cms, 
simple lap winding of full pitch and 880 conductors, 2 turns / commutator bar (ie 220 segments). 
Calculated reactance volts at full load = 4.5 volts. Find mean flux density under an interpoleat full load 
(assume uniform). Interpole air gap is 0.5 cms. Find turns required on each interpole. 
 
Output amps = 200 x 1000 / 500 = 400 amps 
4.5 volts is to be generated in 2 x (4 conductors of short circuit coil) 
But emf = (short circuit turns) x (swept area/sec) x (flux density)  
 
E = 4 x (π D x L x rps) x B 
 
   = 4 x (π 75 x 20 x 550/60)/104 x B 
 
B = 0.26 tesla 
 
 
∫H dl =2600 x 0.5 x 2 
 
         = (4π/10) [amps x N x 2 –  (number of cond/pole) x (amps/path)] 
 
         = (4π/10) [ 400 x N x 2 –  (880/6) x (400/6)] 
 
800N = 880x400/36 + 2600 x (10/4π) 
 
N = 12.2 + 2.6 =15 
(12.2 turns to balance armature reaction + 2.6 turns to give voltage)

Armature windings can be Lap Wound or Wave Wound.

Other typs of winding 
i)
Gramme Ring 
The armature for this type of winding is a tube with spokes to the shaft. The winding is wound 
round and through the tube by hand secured in shallow slots. One end of the winding is bare 
and the brushes bear directly on the winding. 
ii) Singly re-entrant winding 
iii) Doubly re-entrant 
iv) Duplex winding 
 
Example 
8 pole dynamo has Φ = 0.04 weber and is to generate 220 volt at 250 rpm 
Find a suitable number of conductors for a wave winding 
Emf equation  E = (2p)  Φ ZS x (rps) 
       220 = 8 x 0.04 x ZS x 250/60 
 
         ZS = 165 
Wave winding, therefore number of conductors = 2 x ZS = 330 conductors 
 
If the coil sides are numbered as usual and pitches (measured in coil sides) are a1 and a2 , both a1 and a2 
must be odd numbers and (a1 + a2) must be even. 
Hence with 8 poles,  
4 (a1 + a2) = ZS ± 2 
 
ZS = (a multiple of 8) ± 2 
Nearest value for ZS = 170 
Hence total number of conductors = 340

DC Motors and Generators
Bearings 
The bearings for small motors are in the end covers. Large motors usually have separate pedestal bearings. 
The motor end covers are then in two halves bolted together. This allows the windings to be inspected 
without disturbing the rotor.  
 
  
 
 
Starter for a DC motor 
A DC motor will take a very large current if switched directly onto the supply. A series resistance is 
nearly always required to limit the current until the motor is spinning fast enough to generate back emf. 
 
 
 
The diagram shows a typical spring loaded starter. The handle is moved manually against the spring over 
contacts sequentially cutting out the resistance. Finally when all resistance has been cut out, the handle 
comes up against a solenoid carrying field current. If the supply to the field fails, the handle is released 
and swings back to switch off the armature current. 
 
The maximum current during starting is typically 150% full load current but for large motors may be as 
low as 110%. The starting resistors are only in use for a short time during starting and only need to be 
rated for this short time. Repeated attempts to start can overheat and damage the resistors. 
 
The resistors typically consist of a stack of iron castings of a zig-zag shape as shown.

Example 
Find the number and value of starting resistors for a DC shunt motor rated for 440 volts 100 amps full 
load. The armature resistance is 0.14 ohms and the current is to be limited to 150 amps during starting. 
The initial total resistance of the armature circuit is 440/150 = 2.93 ohms 
When the current falls to 100 amps, the volt drop across the resistance of the armature circuit falls to 100 x 
2.93 = 293 volts 
As the next stage is switched in, the back emf remains the same so the voltage applied to the armature 
resistance remains at 293 volts 
Total resistance at the next stage = 293 volts / 150 amps = 1.95 ohms.  
When the current falls to 100 amps, the IR drop falls to 195 volts 
Total resistance at next stage = 195 / 150 = 1.30 ohms 
Similarly, the total resistance of the following stages are 0.87 ohms, 0.58 ohms, 0.39 ohms, 0.26 ohms, 
0.17 ohms and 0.11 ohms. 
The armature resistance is 0.14 ohms, therefore no added resistance is needed for the last stage. 
Subtracting the armature resistance, the starter resistance at each stage becomes 2.79 ohms, 1.81 ohms, 
1.16 ohms, 0.73 ohms, 0.44 ohms, 0.25 ohms, 0.12 ohms, 0.03 ohms and finally zero. 
 
 
 
R1 = 0.98 
R2 = 0.65 
R3 = 0.43 
R4 = 0.29 
R5 = 0.19 
R6 = 0.13 
R7 = .09 
R8 = 0.03 
 
Speed control of DC shunt motors. 
i. Field control 
 
 
 
Speed control of a DC shunt motor is usually achieved by a variable resistance in the field circuit. The 
resistance increases the motor speed and cannot be used to give a low speed.

ii. Armature Resistance control 
 
 
 
A resistor in the armature circuit reduces the speed but is very wasteful of energy. 
 
iii. Armature shunt control 
 
 
 
This is better and gives more stable speed control but is equally wasteful.

DC Motors and Generators
iv. Ward Leonard set 
The motor generator set rotates at constant speed but the generator excitation can be varied. The final 
motor can have a fixed field but the voltage to the armature is variable. Speed control over a 25:1 ratio is 
possible. 
 
 
 
Ship propulsion systems often have a diesel electric drive. The diesel drives a generator directly connected 
to DC electric propulsion motor. This avoids the need for a gearbox or mechanical reverse gear and allows 
the diesel to be installed in the most suitable place on the ship. 
 
Rolling Mill motors are usually Ward Leonard sets. The generator has a very large flywheel which stores 
up energy till the ingot reaches the rollers. Thus very high power is available for the short period of time 
that the ingot passes through without taking a high intermittent power from the electricity supply. 
Furthermore a severe overload can be tripped by circuit breaker before damage is done to the drive 
mechanism. 
 
Speed control of a DC series motor 
i. Series resistor 
The speed of a DC series motor can be controlled by switching additional resistance in series. This in 
effect operates the motor on a reduced voltage. 
 
 
 
ii. Diverter resistor 
 
 
 
A diverter resistor allows higher speeds but is wasteful of energy.

iii. Series / parallel 
 
 
 
If two or more SC series motors are in use, then they can be switched between series and parallel 
connection giving two modes of operation. 
 
Drum Controller 
Electric trams usually have series motors which are controlled by a drum type controller. As a handle on 
top of the drum is rotated, a wiper moves across the contacts cutting out the series resistance in steps 
giving speed control. The controller usually incorporates a blow out coil. This coil carries the motor 
current giving a powerful magnetic field that acts on any arcing at the contacts drawing out the length of 
the arc and helping to extinguish it.  
 
More sophisticated systems use two motors. At low speeds, the motors are connected in series then at a 
higher speed, they are switched into parallel operation. 
 
Speed control resistances must be continuously rated and consume a lot of power when they carry 
armature current.  
 
 
 
Forward/Reverse Control of a small series motor 
Forward and reverse control of a conventional series or shunt motor requires a changeover switch to 
change both connections to the field in addition to the start/stop control. 
 
If however the field winding is made twice the size with the centre connected to the armature, a single 
switch to either end starts the motor in forward or reverse. This is a popular arrangement for small motors 
such as the motor controlling the set point of a mechanical governor.

DC Shunt generator on no load  
The output voltage of a DC shunt generator depends on the field strength. This depends on the output 
voltage and field resistance. If the field is supplied from another DC source, the voltage will follow the 
saturation curve for the magnetic circuit since V is proportional to the flux. 
 
 
 
 
 
Thus if the field resistance is R1 in the diagram, then the voltage will be only that due to the residual flux, 
ie nearly zero. If the resistance is reduced to R2, the voltage will rise suddenly to V2 . Further reduction in 
field resistance to R3 will cause the voltage to rise to V3 . 
 
Thus R2 is the critical resistance, any resistance above this and the output voltage will be zero.

DC Shunt generator on load 
Neglecting armature reaction and brush drop 
V = E – Ia Ra  = If Rf 
E = If Rf + Ia Ra  
Thus for given Ia , the relation between E and If is linear. 
 
 
 
A shunt generator will fail to excite if; 
 
The field resistance is above the critical value 
 
The speed is too low 
 
There is no residual magnetism 
 
The field connections or rotation are reversed 
 
If the machine is run up with load resistance too low 
 
DC Series generator  
 
 
 
 
 
If R is the resistance of the armature plus field and RL is the load resistance 
Then E = I (R + RL) This can be plotted by reducing RL from above the critical value. 
 
The generator will not excite if; 
The total resistance is above the critical value 
The speed is too low 
There is no residual magnetism 
The field connections or rotation are reversed

Close the armature switch and increase the field current to put the set on load. Reduce the field on the first 
set as the field is increased on the second keeping the voltage at the correct value. Repeat step by step till 
the armature currents are balanced. 
 
 
 
The load can be balanced between the generators either by adjusting the field resistors or by adjusting the 
speed of the prime movers. 
 
DC Series Generators in parallel 
DC series generators will not run in parallel unless there is an equalising connection between the fields. 
The equalising connection must be of low resistance for stable operation. 
DC Compound Generators in parallel 
An equalising bar of lower resistance than the series winding is required for stable operation. With No 1 
machine on load, run up No 2 set to speed and adjust the voltage by the shunt regulator. Close No 2 
machine armature switch and the equalising bar switch. Balance the loads by the shunt regulators keeping 
the voltage constant.  
 
 
 
Example 
The field of two DC shunt generators are adjusted to give a voltage of 520 volts on no load. The voltage of 
one generator on its own falls to 500 volts at 400 amps load. The voltage on the other generator falls to 
490 volts on 400 amp load. Find the voltage with the generators in parallel and a total load of 500 amps. 
At a current I1 on machine 1, voltage V1 = 520 – 20 x I1/400 
At a current I2 on machine 2, voltage V2 = 520 – 30 x I2/400  
When the machines are in parallel, V1 = V2 
520 – 20 x I1/400 = 520 – 30 x I2/400 
20 I1 =30 x I2  
I1 + I2 = 500 amps

The armature and field resistances Ra and Rf are measured with the motor at rest. 
The motor is started and run up to the design speed on no load. 
The Voltage, If and Ia are measured. 
On no load, the losses equal the input 
The total input power, V (Ia + If) watts. 
 
The friction, windage and iron loss = V Ia – Ia
2 Ra watts 
 
The field loss = V If watts 
 
The armature copper loss = Ia
2 Ra watts 
Let W = the sum of the friction, windage, iron and field loss 
 
= V Ia – Ia
2 Ra + V If watts 
 
For a given speed, W is assumed to be constant as load is applied. (This is not exactly true since, at 
constant field, the speed falls slightly with load.) 
 
 
 
At any other armature current Ia , the loss = W + Ia
2 Ra watts 
The power input  = V (Ia + If) watts 
The power output = power input – losses 
 
 
 = V (Ia + If) – W – Ia
2 Ra watts 
Efficiency = (power output) / (power input) 
Thus the efficiency can be plotted against power output for this speed. 
 
The no load test can be repeated at other speeds to obtain a family of curves of efficiency against power 
output at various speeds. 
 
Swinburne’s test allows the efficiency to be calculated without having to measure the mechanical output. 
The efficiency is plotted against output at given speeds.

It is not exact as the speed and field cannot both be kept constant as the load is applied but is accurate 
enough for most practical purposes. 
 
Swinburne’s test does not test the motor or generator for other possible faults eg inadequate cooling, 
inadequate mechanical strength. 
 
Hopkinson-Kapp test 
When a batch of identical DC shunt motors are made, their performance can be found by the Hopkinson 
test. Two machines are coupled together on a common bedplate so that one machine drives the other 
which acts as a generator.  
 
 
 
The generator output is fed back into the motor so the only power taken from the supply is to cover the 
losses. 
 
The armature resistance Rm and Rg of the motor and generator are measured at standstill. 
Choose a selection of speeds throughout the range. Start the motor through its starter and run up to each 
chosen speed with switches SA and SF open. 
 
Tabulate A1 and A3 and W1 = V x A1 for each speed. 
W1 is the friction and windage loss of both machines plus the iron loss of the motor. 
 
Close switch SF. 
At each speed, adjust the generator field till V1 is zero and tabulate A1, A3, A4 and W2 = A1 x V. 
W2 is the friction and windage loss of both machines plus the iron loss of both machines. Hence at each 
speed the iron loss for one machine is (W2 – W1) and the friction and windage loss of each machine is 
½(2 W1 – W2). 
 
The brush friction loss of the generator can be found by measuring the power loss with the brushes in 
place and repeating the measurement with the generator brushes lifted but all other conditions identical. 
Choose a selection of armature currents between zero and full load rating. 
At each speed, adjust the generator field till V1 is zero and close switch SA. 
Adjust the generator field to give the selected armature current. 
Tabulate the speed, V, A1, A2, A3, A4, Vx A3 (the field loss of the motor), VA x 4 (the field loss of the 
generator), V x A1 (the total friction, windage, iron and armature loss of the two machines), (A1 + A2)2 
Rm (the armature copper loss of the motor) and (A2)2 Rg (the armature copper loss of the generator).

Let W3 be any loss unaccounted for ( two machines) 
W3 = total – friction & windage loss (2 machines) – iron loss (2 machines) 
 
 
- copper loss motor – copper loss generator 
W3 = V x A1 - (2 W1 – W2) - 2(W2 – W1) - (A1 + A2)2 Rm - (A2)2 Rg 
Motor input = V x (A1 + A2 + A3) 
Let total motor loss be W4 
 = field loss + friction & windage loss + iron loss + motor copper loss + ½ W3 
W4 = (V x A3) + ½ (2W1 – W2) + (W2 – W1) + (A1 + A2)2 Rm + ½ W3 
 
Motor output = motor input – motor loss = V x (A1 + A2 + A3) – W4 
Efficiency = motor output / motor input  
 
Hence a family of curves of efficiency, input and each of the losses can be drawn against output for each 
speed.

The motor and generator operate up to full load while taking a fraction of this power from the supply. 
Thus the machines can be tested and run for extended periods on full load in a location where the supply is 
inadequate to provide full load power, eg to measure the rise in the winding and bearing temperatures. 
 
Decceleration tests 
In this test, the weight and dimensions of a heavy flywheel are measured and the moment of inertia is 
calculated. The flywheel is fitted on the output shaft of a motor and the motor run up to speed. The motor 
is switched off and the speed is plotted against time as the motor slows down. 
The test is repeated with a different flywheel. 
 
At a given speed, the slope dω/dt of each curve is measured. 
(flywheel inertia + motor inertia) x (- dω/dt) = torque due to losses  
 
( I1 + motor inertia) x (- dω1/dt) = ( I1 + motor inertia) x (- dω1/dt) 
motor inertia = [I1 x (dω1/dt) – I2 x (dω2/dt) ] / [ (dω1/dt) – (dω2/dt)] 
 
Loss in watts = (Torque in newton metres) x 2π x rps  
Hence the friction and windage loss can be plotted against speed. 
The test is repeated with the field energised during decceleration. The additional loss is the iron loss due to 
eddy currents and hysteresis.  
 
Example 
A torque of 2 ft lb will just keep the armature of a motor turning. With the field fully excited, the power 
required to keep the motor spinning at 600 rpm is 250 watts. The time taken to stop from 600 rpm is 30 
sec with the field fully excited and armature open circuited. 
 
Show the moment of inertia of armature is 38 lb ft2 
 
At 600 rpm, power = 250 watts 
Torque = power / speed = (250 x 550) / (746 x 20 π) = 2.93 ft lb 
T = α + βω where α= 2 ft lb and β = 0.93/(20 π) 
K dω/dt = ─ g (α + βω) 
 
∫[ K / (α + βω)] dω from 20 π to 0 = ─ g ∫dt from 0 to t 
K / β [ ln(α + βω) ] from 20 π to 0 = ─ g t 
 
K = β g t / [ ln { (α + 20 π β) / α }] = 37.5 lb ft2 
[This assumes all the iron loss is hysteresis loss. What about eddy current loss which is proportional to ω2 ]

Brush Drop  
There is a voltage drop across the brushes, which is slightly different at the positive and negative brushes. 
 
 
 
At current densities of 40 amps/sq in or more, the Carbon to Copper drop is about one volt and the Copper 
to Carbon drop is a little less. At lower current density, the drop is lower, almost zero at a small current. 
The drop depends on the type of brush, the state of the commutator and on the brush pressure and to a less 
extent on speed. 
 
Brush position 
The voltage of a DC generator follows a sine wave as the brush angle in moved through the position for 
the maximum. Thus the exact setting is difficult to find due to the flat response near the maximum. If 
however an AC voltage is applied to the field, the AC output at the brushes passes through zero as the 
brush angle is changed. This allows the neutral position to be set more accurately. In practice, rather than 
AC, a DC current is used and the kick of a voltmeter noted when the current is switched off. This is called 
the “kick test”. The best position for the brushes may be to one side of this neutral position due to self 
inductance of the armature which delays the current reversal. 
 
Example 
A 4 pole 75 kW, 525 volt, 750 rpm DC Generator is to be designed. 
Flux per pole 0.0422 weber.

Equalising Connections 
The air gaps at the pole faces may change with time, eg due to wear in the bearings. A Lap Wound 
machine has the same number of brushes as poles. All brushes of the same polarity are connected together 
on the stator. If the air gaps of the poles are not all the same, then some brushes will carry more current 
than others. This can be avoided if the commutator segments at the same voltage on the rotor are 
connected together.

Example 
A 6 pole dynamo has a field circuit resistance of 120 ohms and there are 2000 turns/pole. For currents less 
than 2 amps, the flux/pole is nearly proportional to field current at 0.02 weber/amp. A constant pd of 480 
volts is applied, find how long the current takes to reach 2 amps and the energy then stored in the field. 
When the current is i amps, Φ = 0.02 i weber/pole 
back emf due to self inductance of 6 coils 
 
L di/dt  = 6 x N x d Φ/dt volts 
             = 6 x 2000 x 0.02 di/dt = 240 di/dt volts  
 
 
V = L di/dt + R i 
Hence 480 = 240 di/dt + 120 i 
 
4 = 2 di/dt + i 
 
4 e0.5t = 2 e0.5t di/dt + e0.5t i = 2 d(i e0.5t )/dt 
Integrate 8 e0.5t = 2 (i e0.5t ) + constant 
 
4 = i + K e─0.5t  
i = 0 when t = 0, therefore K = 4 
 
i = 4 x (1 – e─0.5t ) 
when i = 2, t = 1.38 secs

Example 
A 55 kW 4 pole shunt machine is 440 volt, 125 amp full load Ia , 600 rpm. 
E – If saturation curve, linear from origin to E=150 at If = 0.3  
and linear from E=400 at If = 1.5 to E=480 at If = 3.5 
R a = 0.14 ohms Brush drop = 2 volt except at small loads when = 0 
Shunt turns = 2000 turns/pole. Neglect armature reaction. 
i) Find R f to give E = 440 volts at no load and 600 rpm 
 
Brush drop and Ia Ra are negligible, hence from saturation curve, If = 2.5 amps 
Therefore R f = V/ If = 440/2.5 = 176 ohms 
 
ii) Find the output voltage as a generator on full load at R f = 176 ohms. 
Resistance drop in armature = Ia Ra = 125 x 0.14 = 17.5 volts 
Brush drop = 2 volts       Total drop = 19.5 in armature circuit. 
E = V + 19.5 = 176 If + 19.5  
But from the saturation curve, E = 400 + (480-400) x (If  – 1.5)/(3.5 – 1.5) 
176 If + 19.5 = E = 400 + 40 If – 60  
If = 320.5/136 = 2.36 
V = If Rf = 2.36 x 176 = 415 volts 
 
iii) Find R f to generate 440 volts on full load 
E = 440 + 19.5 = 459.5 volts 
From saturation curve, If = (459.5 – 340)/40 = 2.99 amps 
If Rf = 440 volts therefore Rf = 440/2.99 = 147 ohms a reduction of 29 ohms. 
 
iv) With Rf = 176 ohms, find the speed to generate V = 440 volts on full load. 
E = 440 + 19.5 = 459.5 volts 
If = 440/176 = 2.5 
From the saturation curve, If = 2.5 gives E = 440 volts at 600 rpm 
Speed to give E = 459.5, N = 600 x 459.5/440 = 627 rpm 
 
v) Find the minimum speed for self excitation at Rf = 176 ohms 
The initial slope of the saturation curve at 600 rpm is 150/0.3 = 500 ohms 
Minimum speed for self excitation = 600 X 176/500 = 211 rpm 
 
vi) A series coil is wound on each pole, 
total resistance of all series coils = 0.1 ohm 
Find the turns/pole for the machine to generate V = 440 at no load and full load. 
On no load, from (i) above, Rf = 176 ohms. 
On full load, E = 440 + 125 x (0.1 + 0.14) + 2 = 472 volts 
Hence from saturation curve at 600 rpm, 
amp turns = 2000 x (1.5 + 2 x 72/80) = 6600 
shunt field amp turns = 2000 x V/Rf = 2000 x 440/176 = 5000 
series field amp turns = 6600 – 5000 = 1600 
series turns/pole = 1600/Ia = 1600/125 = 12.8

DC Motors and Generators
This must be an integer, therefore series turns/pole = 13  
vii) Find series turns/pole to give 450 volts on full load, all other values as (vi) 
Full load E = 450 + 125 x (0.1 + 0.14) + 2 = 482 volts 
 
amp turns = 2000 x (1.5 + 2 x 82/80) = 7100 
 
shunt amp turns = 2000 x 450/176 = 5114 
 
series amp turns/pole = 7100 – 5114 = 1986 
 
series turns/pole = 1986/125 = 15.9 
 
nearest integer = 16 turns/pole  
 
viii) The machine is run as a motor. Find the speed on 440 volts with armature load 125 amps and Rf = 
176 ohms. 
 
E = 440 – 125 x 0.14 –2 = 420.5 volts 
 
If = 440/176 = 2.5 therefore E = 440 volts at 600 rpm 
 
Speed = (420.5/440) x 600 = 573 rpm 
 
ix) What value of Rf is required for the machine to run as a motor on full load at 600 rpm on 440 volt 
supply. 
 
E = 420.5 volts as (viii) 
 
From the saturation curve, If = 1.5 + (20.5/40)x 1 = 2.01 amps 
 
Rf = 440/20.1 = 219 ohms 
 
x) Find Rf to run as a motor on full load at 550 rpm on 440 volt supply 
 
As before E = 420.5 volts 
 
The field gives E = 420.5 volt at 550 rpm. 
Therefore field would give 420.5 x 600/550 at 600 rpm = 459 volts  
 
From saturation curve, for E = 459 volts, If = 1.5 + 2 x 59/80 = 2.98 
 
Rf = 440/2.98 = 148 ohms 
 
xi) Find series turns/pole for the machine to run as a motor at 600 rpm on no load and on full load. 
Assume series winding is 0.04 ohms. 
 
On no load, Rf = 176 ohms as before 
 
On full load, E = 440 − 125 x (0.14 + 0.04) − 2 = 415.5 volts 
 
From saturation curve, If = 1.5 + (15.5/40) x 1 = 1.89 amps 
 
Amp turns/pole = 2000 x 1.89 = 3780 
 
Shunt field provides 2000 x 440/176 = 5000 amp turns 
 
Series field must provide 5000 – 3780 = 1220 amp turns 
Series field carries 125 amps therefore 1220/125 = 9.8 turns 
Number of turns must be an integer, therefore 10 series turns/pole 
The series field is in opposition to the shunt field

xii) Find the number of turns for the machine to run as a motor at 550 rpm on full load,  
otherwise as (xi). 
 
E = 415.5 volts as above. This is obtained at 550 rpm 
 
E at 600 rpm would be 415.5 x 600/550 = 453 volts 
 
From saturation curve, If = 1.5 + (53/80) x 2 = 2.83 amps 
 
Amp turns required = 2000 x 2.83 = 5650 
 
Shunt field provides 5000 amp turns as (xi) 
 
Series field is to provide 650 amp turns with current 125 amps 
 
Series turns = 650/125 = 5 turns to nearest integer 
 
These series amp turns are cumulative to the shunt amp turns.

AC Synchronous Machines 
 
AC Machines 
AC Generators have slip rings instead of the commutator. These are solid copper or brass rings insulated 
from the shaft. Spring loaded carbon brushes rub against the rings to make the connection. The generator 
speed is determined by the supply frequency and the number of magnetic poles. A two pole machine on a 
50 cycle/sec system rotates at 3000 rpm. (50 cycles/sec times 60 sec/minute). A four pole machine rotates 
at 1500 rpm. Brushless generators do not need slip rings. The exciter is on the same shaft and the exciter 
rotor supplies the ac generator field through silicon diode rectifiers. 
 
Back emf on AC machine 
Flux linking a coil on the machine is BA Sin θ 
The coil rotates at an angular velocity ω 
θ = ωt = 2π f t / p  
where p is pairs of poles 
dθ/dt = ω = 2π f / p 
Back emf 
e = – N p d Φ/dt where N is turns / pairs of poles 
 
   = – N p d[ BA Sin(2π f t / p)] / dt 
   = –  N BA 2π f  Cos (2π f t / p) 
But BA = Φmax 
Erms =( 1 / √2) N 2π f Φmax = 4.44 N f Φmax 
 
 
 
This emf equation is for a single coil rotating in a uniform magnetic field. A practical generator has 
windings distributed round the machine. 
 
Large generators have the field winding on the rotor and three phase armature windings on the stator. 
 
Three phase generation 
Advantages are 
 
Generation and transmission costs are less 
 
Motors have a rotating field, which makes starting easy 
 
The power and torque are constant, unlike single phase 
 
Star/Delta transformation gives a choice of voltage 
 
Voltage and Frequency 
Most machines in the UK generate at 11 kV and in the USA at 13.8 kV. The frequency in the UK is 50 
hertz and in the USA is 60 hertz.

Peripheral speed 
The peripheral speed of a 34 inch diameter 2 pole rotor is nearly 300 mph. 
 
Damping windings 
Damping windings are heavy copper conductors set in the pole face and brazed at the ends to heavy 
copper strips to short circuit the winding. They help to reduce oscillations or sudden changes in the 
magnetic flux. They play an essential part in the event of a fault on the system connected to the generator. 
 
 
 
Hydrogen cooling 
Hydrogen cooling reduces the windage loss by 90%, eg from 400 kW to 40 kW and the rating could be 
increased by 20%. First used in the USA in 1930 where the 60 hz system means higher windage loss than 
a 50 hz systam. Used in the UK in the 1950s but the additional cost was enormous. The machine had to be 
in an explosion proof gas tight enclosure with complicated seals on the shaft. Further costs included 
expensive gas detection alarms, oil contamination, CO2 fire protection etc. 
 
Electrical and physical angles 
The angle between adjacent pole centres is 1800 electrical degrees whereas the physical angle is 1800 / 
(number of pairs of poles). 
 
Span of coils  
The span of the coils may be less than 1800 electrical degrees. 
Let the coil span be 2λ electrical radians 
This reduces the emf by a factor kp

Where kp = ∫ Sinθ dθ from π/2–λ to π/2+λ 
 
     ∫ Sinθ dθ from π/2–π/2 to π/2+π/2 
hence kp =  [– Cosθ ] from π/2–λ to π/2+λ 
 
    [– Cosθ ] from 0 to π 
           kp =  – [Cos (π/2+λ) – Cos(π/2-λ)] 
 
       – [Cos (π) – Cos (0)] 
 
kp = (2 Sin λ )/ 2 = Sin λ 
Erms = 4.44 kp N f Φtotal   where kp = Sin λ is the pitch factor  
 
 
 
The reduction in coil pitch causes a much larger reduction in the harmonic content. The pitch factor for the 
n th harmonic is Sin[π/2 – n (π/2 – λ) ]. 
 
For n th harmonic where n = 2m + 1, pitch factor knp = (–1)m Sin(n λ ) 
Thus for the 3rd harmonic the pitch factor 
k3p = – Sin(3 λ) 
 
       5th harmonic 
 
 
k5p =   Sin (5 λ) 
 
       7th harmonic 
 
 
k7p = – Sin (7 λ) 
 
Example 
6 slots / pole pitch and 5 slots / coil pitch 
2λ = (5/6) π 
Pitch Factor kp = Sin λ = Sin (750 ) = 0.966 
Hence the smaller coils cause a reduction in emf of only 3.4%  
 
λ = 750 thus the pitch factor for the 3rd harmonic is –Sin(2250 ) = 0.707 
and for the 5th harmonic the pitch factor is 0.259.  
 
Factor due to phase difference in conductor emfs 
With the conductors evenly distributed round the machine, the voltages induced in each conductor are not 
in phase. The conductors of a single phase machine generate voltages whose vectors follow the 
circumference of a circle. The vector sum is proportional to D while the scalar sum is proportional to πD/2. 
Thus the voltage generated with a large number of conductors is D/( πD/2) of the possible maximum, ie 
64%.

If the conductors are divided into three phases, the vector sum for one coil is D/2 and the maximum 
possible is πD/6. 
 
 
 
The generated voltage is 3/π = 95% of the maximum. 
 
The windings of the three phases are spaced 120 electrical degrees apart. 
The diagram shows a typical winding with two conductors in each slot and the coil pitch one slot less 
 than π. 
 
 
 
The completed winding for a 2 pole machine would be like this.

In this example, the coil pitch is (8/9)π 
Hence the pitch factor kp = Sin (80 0) = 0.985 
 
But the voltages in each conductor are not in phase. It can be seen that the voltage in each of the three 
conductors is 2 r Sin (100 ) where r is their vector sum. 
 
 
 
The distribution factor kd = (vector sum) / (scalar sum) 
kd = 2 Sin (θ/2) /[2 c Sin{ θ /(2c)}] 
where θc = π/number of phases and c = slots/phase/pole  
If the number of phases = 3, then 2 Sin (θ/2) = 1 
and kd = 1 /[2 c Sin{π /(6c)}c] or kd = 1 /[2 c Sin (300 /c)] 
If c = 1, kd = 1 
If c is very large kd = 1 /[2c π/(6c)] = 3/π = 0.955 
 
 
 
In this example, phases = 3 and c = 3 
kd = 1 /[6 Sin (100 )] = 0.960 
Total factor = kp kd = 0.985 x 0.960 = 0.946 
  
For the nth harmonic  
knp = Sin (nλ) 
knd = Sin (nθ/2) /[ c Sin{ nθ /2c}] 
 
For the 5th harmonic 
 
k5p = Sin (4000) = 0.642 
k5d = Sin (1500) /[ 3 Sin{ 3000 /6}] = 0.5 / (3 Sin 500 ) = 0.218 
Total factor = k5p k5d = 0.642 x 0.218 = 0.140 
 
The factor for the 5th harmonic is only 15% of the fundamental factor. 
 
In the example, suppose there are 30 turns per phase, ie 10 conductors in each layer in each slot 
The generated emf would be

If the maximum flux density is 1.2 tesla and the generated emf is 240 volts per phase, the area of the pole 
face is 317 cm2. 
 
Fractional Slots per pole per phase 
In the above example. There were 3 slots per pole per phase. 
It is possible to have fractional slots per pole per phase. 
The following arrangement has 3 ½ slots per pole per phase. 
 
 
 
Fractional slots have a number of advantages. 
 
The same laminations can be used for a different number of poles 
 
There is greater flexibility in the make up of the winding 
 
Certain harmonics are killed

3rd harmonics are in phase in each winding and cancel out in the line voltage and in the secondaries of 
delta star transformers. 
5th harmonic pitch factor = Sin (5λ) 
 
Sin (5 λ ) = Sin (3600) = 0  Hence 5th harmonic is zero 
7th harmonic pitch factor = - Sin (5040) = - Sin(1440) = - 0.588 
 
k7d = Sin (7 x θ/2) /[ c Sin{ 7 x θ /(2c)}] 
      = Sin (2100) / [15 Sin (140 )] = 0.138 
Total factor for the 7th harmonic = k7p k7d = 0.081 
 
In fact there is a further reduction as the 7th harmonic is not generated at the same level as the fundamental 
before this factor is applied, the fundamental is generated by the main flux whereas the harmonics are only 
generated by irregularities in the flux. 
 
Effect of harmonics on the rms value of the generated voltage 
Let E = E1 Cos (φ1+ ωt) + E3 Cos (φ3 + 3ωt) + E5 Cos (φ5+ 5ωt) + ... 
E2 = E1
2 Cos2 (φ1+ ωt) + E3
2 Cos2 (φ3 + 3ωt) + E5
2 Cos2 (φ5+ 5ωt) + ... 
        + E1 E3 Cos (φ1+ ωt) Cos (φ3 + 3ωt) + ... 
 
Average value of Eq
2 Cos2 (φq + qωt) = Eq
2/2 
Average value of Eq Er Cos (φq+ qωt) Cos (φr + rωt) = 0 
 
Hence E2 = ½ [E1
2 + E3
2 + E5
2+ E7
2 + ... 
Hence Erms = 1/√2 [√{E1
2 + E3
2 + E5
2+ E7
2 + ... }] 
 
      = E1/√2 [√{1 + (E3
2/E1
2 ) + (E5
2/E1
2 ) + (E7
2/E1
2 ) + ... }] 
 
Suppose 3rd harmonic = 15%, 5th = 7% and 7th = 5% of fundamental 
Erms = E1/√2 [√(1 + 0.0225 + 0.0049 + 0.0025 )] = 1.015 E1/√2 
 
Harmonics are reduced by winding factors and have little effect on Erms 
 
The effect of slot ripple on the generated voltage. 
Suppose the slots exactly line up with the pole face. When the rotor moves ½ slot width, the flux is altered 
because one tooth is replaced by one air gap. 
 
The flux pulsates with one complete cycle for every time a slot passes. 
The fundamental frequency is f = (rps) x p where p is the pairs of poles. 
There are c slots/phase/pole 
Therefore in one revolution, c x (3 phases) x 2p slots pass any one point 
The flux pulsates at a frequency of 6 c p x(rps) = 6c f 
 
Φ = Φ0 [ 1 + A Sin ( 6c 2πf t)] 
 
e = Emax [1 + A Sin ( 6c 2πf t)] Sin (2πf t) 
e = Emax Sin (2πf t) + ½EmaxA[Cos(6c-1)2πf t] – ½Emax A[Cos(6c+1)2πf t

Slot ripple causes harmonics of a high order that interferes with communication equipment. There is no 
easy way to eliminate these harmonics, but they can be reduced by; 
 
Using fractional slot windings 
 
Axial skewing of slots (on the stator or rotor) by one pole pitch. 
 
Axial skewing of poles 
 
Rounding off corners of pole shoes 
 
Use of better ratio of tooth width to slot width 
 
Offsetting of damper bars  
 
EMF  with the winding in slots 
In actual machines there are two sets of coils for each phase.  Each set 
for each phase of a three phase machine covers  /3 of the 
circumference. The diagram shows a typical arrangement with three 
slots for each phase.  Each slot contains the lower half of one coil and 
the upper half of another, ie half of each coil is in the lower part of 
one group of slots and half in the upper part of another group of slots.  
The diagram shows one coil in full with a coil span of 2 λ. 
 
Let E1 be the emf in the upper conductors of one set of 
coils.  The emf in the lower conductors of the same coils is 
the same shaped wave but at an angle of (π – 2λ) later.  It 
is shown as E2. The total emf in one set of coils is  E1 + 
E2.  The emf in the other set of coils is the same  E1 + E2. 
 
The E1+E2  voltage curve for a half cycle is symmetrical 
about  /2.  With a large number of slots, the steps become 
blurred into slopes. 
 
Generated harmonics. 
The shape of the generated emf E can be plotted out and 
then analysed by Fourier Analysis.   
 
This can easily be done by computer. 
 
Let the generated emf be represented by 
 
E = A1 Cos (2π ft) + A3 Cos (6π ft) + A5 Cos (10π ft) + A7 Cos (14π ft) + ……. 
 
 
+ B1 Sin (2π ft) + B3 Sin (6π ft) + B5 Sin (10π ft) + B7 Sin (14π ft) +……. 
 
The value of the n th harmonic is; 
An  =  (1/ π ) ∫ E Cos (n x) dx from 0 to 2 π         (all zero with a symmetrical wave form). 
 
Bn  =  (1/ π ) ∫ E Sin (n x) dx from 0 to 2 π 
With  x  in degrees, the value of the n th harmonic is; 
An  =  (1/ 180 ) ∫ E Cos {n x(3.14159/180)} dx from 0 to 360 
 
Bn  =  (1/ 180 ) ∫ E Sin {n x(3.14159/180)}  dx from 0 to 360

Example 
Pole angle   = 600 ,  coil pitch angle  = 800, large number of slots. 
Find the relative values of the fundamental and the harmonics  
 
Consider one phase.  At any angle of the rotor, the emf is proportional to the 
number of conductors under a pole face.  This is proportional to the total angle 
of conductors under the pole face. 
 
In the position shown, the emf is zero as the conductors under each pole are two halves of the same coil.  
Plot the total angle of conductors under a pole face as the rotor is rotated clockwise in steps of 100

Capacitive loading 
For resistive or inductive loading, harmonics content is usually small. 
However for capacitive loading (eg a long high voltage line with no load), the harmonics will be 
magnified and can be troublesome. 
 
Equivalent Circuit for a synchronous machine 
The emf and output voltage are related by the vector equation 
e = v + i  R +j(i  X) 
X is the leakage reactance and R is the resistance. In a practical machine, R is negligible compared to X. 
The effect of R can be ignored in the impedance but R is required for calculations of copper loss. 
 
 
 
 
 
Leakage reactance and Armature reaction  
The effect of mmf due to armature currents in producing flux linking with the main flux is called the 
armature reaction.

AC Synchronous Machines
The effect of mmf due to armature currents in producing flux linking with the armature windings only is 
called the leakage reactance effect. 
 
Leakage Reactance 
Leakage reactance is due to flux paths round the conductors in the slots, at the ends of the conductors 
outside the core and zigzag flux between the armature windings and the pole face.  
 
 
 
 
 
All the effects of leakage flux are summed up by XLeakage and can be determined from the dimensions of 
the machine. In most machines the value is about right, but in turbo-alternators it must be increased, eg by 
not filling the slots with winding so the slot leakage is increased. 
 
On short circuit, the initial current is E / Xd” where E is the emf and Xd” is the subtransient reactance. 
The leakage reactance is the main limiting factor in the initial value of the short circuit current. Thus Xd” 
is usually taken as the leakage reactance.  
 
Percentage Reactance 
 
Xd” = (Reactance in ohms) x Iph x 100 % / Vph 
 
Armature Reaction 
The armature reaction has a big effect on the magnetising force. The unity power factor component 
distorts the field which has the effect of rotating the field and slightly reducing its magnitude. The zero 
power factor inductive component directly opposes the exciter magnetising force and greatly reduces the 
magnitude of the field.

This effect is quantified as the synchronous reactance. It is measured by the open circuit and short circuit 
tests. 
 
However the mmf due the wattles component of the current is centred on the pole axis. Zero power factor 
lagging currents are directly demagnetizing while zero power factor leading currents boost the field.  
 
 
 
The armature reaction due to the unity power factor component rotates the axis of the field while the zero 
power factor component alters its value.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Open Circuit Test 
With the generator disconnected and running at rated speed, the field current is slowly raised. The 
generator voltage is plotted against the field current. The result is a curve following the magnetisation 
curve of the iron.  
 
 
 
It can be represented approximately by four straight lines, slopes M1, M2, M3 and M4 with intercepts U2, 
U3 and U4 which meet at points (F1,E1), (F2,E2) and (F3,E3). 
 
Short Circuit Test 
For the short circuit test, the generator terminals are connected together on short circuit. The generator is 
run up to rated speed and the field current slowly raised. The field current is plotted against generator 
output current. The result is a straight line.

The reason that the short circuit curve is a straight line is because the leakage reactance is very much 
greater than the resistance. Therefore the output current lags the emf by 90 degrees and the ampere turns 
of the output current directly oppose the field ampere turns. The field ampere turns therefore equal the 
ampere turns of the output current plus the ampere turns to provide the emf. As the emf is small, the 
excitation is near the origin where the relation between field and emf is linear.  
 
Vector diagram for the short circuit test 
 
 
 
The emf E is produced by the ampere turns due to the field current minus the ampere turns due to 
armature reaction. This drives the armature current Ia against the leakage reactance Xd”. 
 
Hence  E = M1 (I f – I aN a /Nf  )  and  E = Ia  Xd” 
 
Thus   Ia  ( Xd” + M1  Na  /  Nf  ) = M1  If 
But     Ia   = S  If 
Therefore  ( Xd” + M1  Na  /  Nf  ) = M1  / S 
 
Synchronous Reactance Xd 
The Synchronous Reactance Xd is defined as the ratio of the slope of the open circuit characteristic near 
the origin to the slope of the short circuit characteristic. This ratio has the dimensions of emf / current so is 
called reactance. 
 
Thus Xd = M1 / S 
Therefore  Na / Nf  =( Xd – Xd”) / M1

     = U + M  (If – Id  ( Xd – Xd”) / M1 ) 
Where U and M have the appropriate values for the emf 
 
On the Quadrature Axis (the axis between the poles) the air gap is larger and the magnetism is 
approximately proportional to the mmf. 
 
Let Xq” be the leakage reactance to the quadrature component of the load current.and Xq be the 
quadrature synchronous reactance.

If θ = 600 then Xad/Xaq = 2.4 
Experience shows that this figure is not correct due to fringing flux which cannot be analysed. A better 
result is obtained by comparing areas. 
 
Xad is proportional to   2∫ Sinx dx     from π/2 – θ to π/2  = Sin θ 
Xaq is proportional to   2∫ Cosx dx    from π/2 – θ to π/2  = 1 – Cos θ 
Xad / Xaq =[ Sin θ] / [1 – Cos θ] = 1/ Tan (θ/23) 
If  θ = 600  then  Xad/Xaq = 1.73 which is a reasonable figure.

as calculated for no slots and infinite permeability. Leakage reactance per phase is 10% of synchronous 
reactance. 
 
Show phases are balanced and calculate the synchronous reactance. 
 
There are 14 slots/phase so there are 2 conductors in each layer in each slot and 56 conductors in series in

quadrature axis which is shown on the diagram as EqL 
EL = U + M  [If  N f – IdL  Na ] / N f  
and Na / Nf = ( Xd – Xd”) / M1  
Therefore EL = U + M  [If - IdL  ( Xd – Xd”) / M1 ] 
 
Hence If can be evaluated 
If = (EL – U) / M + IdL  ( Xd – Xd”) / M1 
Where U and M have values applicable to the emf EL 
 
Parallel operation of AC generators 
Suppose two AC generators are switched into parallel operation and No 2 generator slows behind No 1. 
The voltages are no longer in phase and a current I will circulate driven by the vector voltage V1 – V2. 
The circuit is highly inductive so the current lags this voltage by almost 900.  
It can be seen that V1 ● I is positive and V2 ● (−I) is negative. 
Therefore load on Generator No 1 increases and it slows down. The load on Generator No 2 is reduced 
and it speeds up bringing the generators back into synchronism.

Thus AC generators will operate in parallel in synchronism. As they are in synchronism, they must run at 
the same speed. 
 
The governor of the engine driving the generator controls the power output as a function of the speed. 
Therefore when two AC generators are running in synchronism, the power sharing of sets is controlled by 
the governor set points.  
 
Altering the voltage on either of the sets has no effect on the power sharing.  
 
For satisfactory power sharing, the governors must have a droop so that as the set is loaded up, the speed 
falls. Typically the change in speed between no load and full load is about 5%. The governor has a manual 
control that adjusts the set point, ie the position of the speed control relative to the synchronous speed.  
 
 
 
For unattended operation the manual control is replaced by a slow acting automatic control eg by a DC 
motor driving through a slow acting worm gear drive. Speed control is through the fast acting governor 
but the slow acting control in effect moves the governor set point. An even longer term control is also 
required so that any electric clocks on the system continue to read the correct time. When the clocks read 
fast or slow, the speed is reduced or increased a fraction respectively. A manned power station would have 
an electric and a crystal clock side by side on the control panel.

AC Synchronous Machines
Synchronising an AC generator 
Before switching an AC generator into parallel operation; 
i)
The voltages must be the same 
ii) The speeds must be the same 
iii) The peak value of the voltages must occur at the same instant 
 
This is achieved by adjusting the field resistance so that the voltages are the same and connecting a 
synchroscope. One coil of the synchroscope is connected to the “running volts” and the other to the 
“incoming volts”. The synchroscope rotates as the voltages come into and out of synchronism, the speed 
of rotation depending on the difference in speeds. The speed of the incoming set is adjusted till the 
synchroscope is rotating slowly in the clockwise direction and the circuit breaker is closed at the instant 
when the synchroscope needle is in the 12 o’clock position. The sets are now locked in synchronism. The 
governor of the incoming set is immediately manually raised to load up the incoming set.  
 
Voltage Control of AC generators by the AVR 
 
An AVR, (the Automatic Voltage Regulator), is required to keep the output voltage constant. A lagging 
current heavily reduces the field mmf while a leading current increases the field mmf. Hence an automatic 
voltage regulator controlling the field current is required to keep the output voltage constant. 
 
If two machines are locked in synchronism, the power output of each depends on the governor setting (ie 
the set point of the governor). Any change in field strength will not change the power output but will 
change the reactive component (ie the kVAr). Suppose two machines run in parallel both with perfect 
AVRs, ie AVRs that ensure the output voltage is correct whatever the current or power factor. 
 
If one machine supplies a low power factor lagging current I1, an AVR with no compounding will raise 
the field mmf to counteract. The other machine will supply a leading current I2 such that the vector sum of 
the two machine currents equals the load current I. The AVR of each machine adjusts the field mmf to 
keep the total mmf in the field constant for the set point voltage. A change in the reactive component in 
either machine can avalanche as the AVRs try to correct. 
 
 
 
One of two things will happen; 
 
(1) The lagging reactive current in one set will rise balanced by a rise in the leading reactive current in the 
other set. The current in both machines will steadily rise till the ammeters go off the scale and the 
machines trip on overload. 
 
Or (2) the lagging reactive component will swing violently from one set to the other till again the 
machines trip on overload. One or other of these is a common fault when commissioning a new alternator 
set and indicates reversed or incorrectly set compounding.

To prevent this happening, a “droop” is introduced in the AVR circuit. A lagging current must slightly 
reduce the excitation. Thus a lagging current must slightly increase the voltage seen by the AVR which 
will then reduce the excitation. Conversely a leading current slightly reduces the voltage seen by the AVR 
which then increases the excitation. 
 
Somewhere between these two extremes of power factor, there is a power factor where the current does 
not change the voltage. The circuitry is arranged so that this occurs at the design system power factor, ie 
the expected power factor of the load to be connected to the generator. At this design system power factor, 
the voltage is correct whatever the current. 
 
If the expected system power factor is close to 0.87 (ie Cos 300 ), then the reference voltage for the AVR 
could be the vector relation; 
VAVR = Vyellow + I red x R  
At a power factor of Cos 300 lagging, the current vector I red (and hence compounding voltage I red R) is at 
right angles to the voltage vector Vyellow. 
At a power factor of zero lagging, VAVR is greater than Vyellow , hence the AVR reduces the field giving the 
droop. 
 
The I red x R term is called the compounding. 
 
 
 
Compounding for any other expected system power factor can be arranged by using an AVR that accepts a 
DC reference voltage. The compounding voltage is added to the reference voltage by vector addition with 
a 900phase shift, (eg blue to yellow phase volts added to a compounding voltage proportional to red phase 
current. This modified reference voltage is then rectified. An adjustable rectified voltage proportional to 
the compounding voltage is then subtracted from the reference voltage (ie a vector addition followed by a 
scalar subtraction) so that at the design system power factor, the reference voltage is the same whatever 
the current. 
 
For the very best voltage control system, the reference voltage for the AVR is the DC sum of the three 
phase or line voltages, each with the appropriate compounding. This has the advantage that the alternator 
response is the same with unbalanced load or single phase fault regardless of which phase carries the 
heavy current. 
 
Over and under excitation 
If the alternator supplies a lagging load, the excitation must be increased to partly overcome the 
demagnetizing effect of the load current but not enough to completely overcome it.. The machine is said to 
be overexcited and the emf is greater than the voltage.

If the machine supplies a leading current, the machine is said to be underexcited and the emf is less than 
the voltage. 
 
Stability 
The stability depends on the angle between E and V

IX / Sinθ = E / Sin(90 + φ) 
I = E Sinθ / X Cosφ

Salient Pole Alternator

Vsinθ = IqXq 
P = (EV/Xd) Sinθ + [V2 (Xd – Xq) Sin2θ] / [2XdXq) 
 
 
 
The distortion of the curve is due to the second harmonic term. Maximum power occurs much earlier and 
the angle between E and V is considerably reduced. 
 
A turbo cannot produce any power by excitation of the armature only. A salient pole machine can produce 
10% of full power without excitation. Flux in the air gap is normal to the pole face but fringe flux at the 
edge of the pole can produce the torque. 
 
 
 
Transient Stability 
If the machine is operating in the stable region and an additional load is applied, the equilibrium condition 
may move closer to the unstable region. If this load is applied suddenly, the machine may overshoot into 
the unstable region and will then cease to operate.  
 
  
 
 
Synchronous Motor 
With a synchronous motor, the currents are the opposite direction.  
 
V = E + IX 
 
If the emf exceeds the voltage, the current leads the voltage. If the emf is less than the voltage, then the 
current lags the voltage. This is the opposite of the alternator so it is confusing to refer to the currents only 
as leading or lagging.

AC Synchronous Machines
The power factor of an industrial plant which has many induction motors can be improved by installing 
one or more synchronous motors. 
 
Synchronous Condenser. 
The synchronous condenser is neither a generator nor a motor. The current is zero power factor. If the 
machine is over-excited, it can be considered as an alternator generating a lagging current. Equally it can 
be considered a motor taking a leading current. If the machine is under-excited, it can be considered as an 
alternator generating a leading current. Equally it can be considered a motor taking a lagging current. 
 
A synchronous condenser is used to improve the power factor of an industrial plant. It is described as over 
or under excited, not as taking a leading or lagging current.

Thus the mmf rotates at a frequency f with a magnitude Fmax = (3/2)(N Imax) ampere turns 
 
The mmf due to the three phase winding resolved in one direction is F = (3/2) N Imax Sin(ωt + ) where 
ω =2πf/p and  is a constant that depends on the direction of the mmf when t = 0. 
 
Fmax = ½ c Z √2 I Ampere Turns/pole/phase 
where c= slots/pole/phase, I is the rms value and Z = conductors/slot  
 
If a three phase winding rotates between pole faces, the mmf follows the pattern shown 
 
 
 
When ωt = 900 
Ir = Ip  
Iy = Ip Sin(-30) = – Ip/2 
Ib = Ip Sin(-150) = – Ip/2

AC Induction Motors 
 
Small AC commutator motors 
Small AC motors (eg for hand tools) are usually commutator machines with the field connected in series. 
There is a transformer effect between the field and armature which prevents the motor having a shunt 
connected field. 
 
Three phase Induction Motors  
The majority of AC motors are three phase induction motors. The stator is wound with three coils spaced 
equally round the stator. When these coils are connected to a three phase supply, they create a magnetising 
force that rotates at synchronous speed in the rotor. The synchronous speed is the supply frequency 
divided by the number of pairs of magnetic poles. Thus the synchronous speed for a 4 pole machine is 
1500 rpm on a 50 cps supply.  
The rotors consist of a cage of bars solidly connected together at each end. Hence a common name for the 
rotor is “squirrel cage”. 
 
Swapping any two phases causes the rotating field to reverse direction. Hence to change the direction of 
rotation, swap any two phases.

The rotating field induces an emf in the rotor at “slip” frequency, (ie at a frequency equal to the 
synchronous speed minus the rotor speed). 
 
Slip Σ = (n0 – n)/n0 
where n0 is the synchronous speed and n is the actual speed. 
 
The emf induced in the rotor is proportional to the slip frequency. 
E = ΣE0 where E0 is the emf at slip = 1 
 
 
 
Let the Rotor resistance and reactance be Rr and Xr at supply frequency. 
Hence the rotor resistance and reactance at slip frequency are Rr and ΣXr 
 
The rotor current is I shown on the vector diag where; 
θ =Arc Sin ( I Xr / E ) 
Suppose a resistance ρ is added to the rotor resistance and the load adjusted (if necessary) to maintain the 
current at I. The motor will run more slowly. 
With added resistance ρ the slip becomes Σ‘. 
 
 
 
The vector diag becomes as shown. 
The phase angle of the current is unchanged 
 at θ =Arc Sin ( I Xr / E ) 
 
With I and θ unchanged, the magnetic force on each conductor is unchanged, and therefore the torque is 
unchanged. 
 
Furthermore, since the rotor current magnitude and phase angle are unchanged, the stator current is 
unchanged in magnitude and phase angle. 
 
Hence by adding resistance to the rotor, nothing is changed except the slip and the speed. 
Equating values for Cos θ, 
  
I Rr / ΣE = I (Rr + ρ ) / Σ‘E 
Hence Σ‘/ Σ = (Rr + ρ ) / Rr 
Thus Slip is proportional to rotor resistance.

As more resistance is added, the slip increases. We can add resistance till the slip = 1, ie the motor comes 
to a standstill. Let the resistance for standstill be ρ’ 
 
Putting Σ‘ = 1 in the value of Cos θ gives 
 
1/ Σ = (Rr + ρ ) / Rr 
 
 ρ’ = Rr (1 – Σ)/ Σ  
where Σ is the slip under normal running conditions. 
 
Rr + ρ’ = Rr / Σ  
 
The only difference between the condition at standstill and at full load is that in one case there is 
mechanical power output and in the other this same amount of power is consumed by I2ρ’. Thus Iρ’ is 
equal to the back emf at full load and I2ρ’ is equivalent to the output power per phase. There are three 
phases so the total power output is 3 I2ρ’ watts where ρ’ = Rr (1 – Σ)/ Σ and Σ is the slip at full load. 
Power output = 3 I2 Rr (1 – Σ)/ Σ 
 
The motor at standstill has become a transformer. The rotor and stator resistances and reactances can be 
lumped together as a single resistance and reactance with the appropriate turns ratio. Current is required to 
magnetise the field and this is added vectorially. 
 
Let R be the total equivalent resistance of the stator and magnetising circuit and X be the total equivalent 
reactance of the rotor, stator and magnetising circuit. Then  
I = V / Z = V /√ [(R + Rr + ρ’ )2 + X2 ] 
 
I = V /√ [(R + Rr / Σ)2 + X2 ] 
But Σ is small, therefore Rr / Σ is large compared to R 
 
I ≈ V /√ [( Rr / Σ)2 + X2 ] 
 
Power output 
P ≈ 3 V2 / [( Rr / Σ)2 + X2 ] Rr (1 – Σ)/ Σ 
 
P ≈ 3 V2 (1 – Σ) Rr Σ / [ Rr 2 + X2 Σ2 ] watts 
Let the output torque be T newton metres 
 
P = 2π T (1 – Σ) n0  watts 
 
T ≈ 3 V2 Rr Σ / [2π n0 (Rr 2 + X2 Σ2)]  
 
 
 
Plotting T against Σ gives the speed torque curve for an induction motor.  
 
The Speed for maximum torque is given by 
dT/dΣ = 0 
T = AΣ/[ Rr 2 + X2 Σ2]  
where A = 3 V2 Rr Σ / [2π n0]

dT/dΣ = A[ Rr 2 + X2 Σ2]-1 
           + AΣ[ Rr 2 + X2 Σ2]-2(-1)(2 X2 Σ ) 
= A[ Rr 2 + X2 Σ2]-2[Rr 2 + X2 Σ2 - 2 X2 Σ2] 
= A[ Rr 2 + X2 Σ2]-2[Rr 2 - X2 Σ2] 
dT/dΣ = 0 when Rr 2 = X2 Σ2 
ie when Σ = R/X 
d2T/dΣ2 = (-2) A[ Rr 2 + X2 Σ2]-3[Rr 2 - X2 Σ2] 
 
+ A[ Rr 2 + X2 Σ2]-2[- 2X2 Σ] 
when Rr 2 = X2 Σ2, d2T/dΣ2 is negative 
 
 
 
Therefore T is a maximum when Σ = Rr/X 
 
If Rr = X the torque is a maximum when the speed is zero. This makes the motor inefficient at full load, 
but a wound rotor with slip rings and a variable external resistance are sometimes used where a high 
starting torque is required.

AC Induction Motors
Induction motors are usually started direct on line, ie the starter switches the supply directly to the 
winding. Small motors typically take about six times full load current for five or six seconds. Large 
motors take four or five times full load current for as long as fifteen seconds. 
 
However the starting current is low power factor until the motor is almost up to speed so the current taken 
from the supply is more likely to be a problem than power taken from the supply. Motors are normally 
kept on light load till up to speed. 
 
Single phase induction motors 
Single phase induction motors start on two phases from a single phase supply. One of the phases has an 
impedance in series to change its phase. This is often a large capacitance connected through a centrifugal 
switch which cuts out the capacitance when the motor is up to speed. 
 
Some small motors use a short circuited coil permanently flux linked with one winding. This changes the 
phase angle of this winding enough for the motor to start and run. 
 
Power Factor Improvement 
AC Induction motors have inductive coils connected to the supply. The power factor is poor, typically in 
the range 0.7 to 0.9, usually the lower end. This means that the power loss in the supply to the motor is 
relatively high. The power factor can be improved by the installation of a bank of capacitors in parallel 
with the motor. Ideally, the capacitive reactance should be the same as the inductive reactance which 
would bring the power factor up to unity. 
 
A synchronous motor is an alternative to a bank of capacitors. The synchronous motor can be over excited 
to take a leading current and can either be used as a motor or run light purely for power factor 
improvement.. The downside is that synchronous motors are more difficult to start and in the event of a 
system fault may lose synchronism further adding to the disruption.  
 
Speed control of ac motors 
Speed control of ac motors is possible by thyristor control of the current or voltage. Another method is to 
rectify the ac into dc and use the dc to power an inverter to give a variable frequency ac supply. This is the 
subject of another e-book.

Insulation
Insulation
 
Insulation for electrical machines. 
Insulating materials for electrical machines are grouped into several classes. 
Class A is organic, eg cotton, linen etc 
Class B is inorganic, eg mica, glass, asbestos etc, and is usually impregnated with varnish. 
 
The permitted temperature rise depends on the Class 
 
Class Y 
Class A

Electrical machines are designed such that the hottest spot in the machine is within the permitted 
temperature for the Class of insulation when operating on full load in an ambient of 400 C. 
 
It follows that at higher ambient temperatures, the rating of the machine is reduced, while at lower 
ambient temperatures the machine may be operated on a higher load without overheating. At given 
voltage, power output is approximately proportional to current while copper loss is proportional to the 
square of the current. Total loss is proportional to the temperature difference between the insulation and 
ambient temperatures.  
 
Let T1 be the permitted temperature for the Class of insulation and T2 the ambient temperature. Let Q be 
the ratio of the friction, windage and iron loss to the copper loss at full load. 
Thus Q = (Watts input on no load)/(I2 R loss on full load)
 
Power Output at ambient temp T2  
= Rated Output x √[Q (40 – T2 )/(T1 – 40) + (T1 – T2 )/ (T1 – 40 )] 
 
The average winding temperature can be measured by the resistance of the winding. The hot spot 
temperature will be about 10% higher. If the machine is operated above the permitted temperature, the life 
of the insulation will be shortened. The effect is logarithmic. For a long life, the machine should be 
operated well below the permitted temperature.

Insulation Resistance depends on the temperature and the relation is logarithmic. Typically an increase of 
65 degrees C causes the insulation resistance to be reduced to one tenth in value.

Power transformers in electricity supply systems 
Transformers are widely used in electrical power supplies. The power loss in the electrical power supply is 
I2 R, but the power transmitted is √3 V I Cos φ. Thus for a given conductor size, the loss is inversely 
proportional to V2. 
 
Electrical power transmission is therefore at high voltage eg 400 kV or 230 kV. The voltage is then 
reduced to a more manageable value typically 11kV, 33 kV or 66 kV. Finally it is reduced again to about 
415 volts to give single phase supplies of about 240 volts.  
 
Construction of power transformers 
Power transformers are usually oil filled with cooling fins or tubes. The windings are usually wound on a 
winding machine from strip copper wrapped with paper insulation. The winding on each limb is 
completed as a number of discs. The core consists of steel laminations, each of which has an insulating 
material baked on one side. The laminations are assembled with overlapping joints and the top left open.  
 
 
 
The winding discs are placed on each limb of the core and the top laminations of the core are then fitted 
with interleaving joints. The connections between the winding discs are made and the windings 
compressed rigid. The top of the transformer tank is then fitted to the core and any bushings connected to 
the windings. The assembly is then lowered into the tank and connections made to any cable boxes. The 
tank top cover is bolted to the tank with an oil tight gasket. When complete, the transformer internals hang 
from the tank top. The complete transformer is often baked in an oven to thoroughly dry out the paper 
insulation before filling with oil. The conservator, an oil filled header tank, allows for the expansion and 
contraction of the oil with a vent to atmosphere through silica gel.

Core Arrangements 
3 Phase Power Transformers usually have the Primary connected in Delta and the Secondary connected in 
Star on a 3 Limb Core. If both windings are connected in Star, then the Core may be 5 Limb. 
 
Single Phase Power Transformers are usually Shell type. 
 
 
Flux 
The flux Φmax = [4 π μ A Imax N / L] x 10–7 weber. 
where μ is the permeability of the core, A is the cross sectional area of the core in m2, Imax is the peak 
value of the magnetizing current in amps, N is the number of turns and L is the length of the magnetic 
path in the core in metres. 
 
Back emf 
The AC supply causes a sinusoidal magnetising force which in turn causes a flux in the iron core. 
Let the flux be Φ = Φmax Cos (2π f t) 
The back emf on a winding of N turns linked with this flux is; 
 
E = - N d Φ / dt 
 
E  = N  Φmax 2π f Sin (2π f t) 
Hence Erms  = (1/ √2) N Φmax 2π f  
 
Erms = 4.44 N Φmax f  
where Φmax is in webers, f is in Hz and Erms is in volts 
 
Delta / Star transformation 
The primary winding is usually connected in delta and the secondary in star with the secondary neutral 
brought out to a terminal. The secondary current times turns on each limb of the transformer is balanced 
by an equal number of current times turns on the primary. The primary also carries a low power factor 
lagging current to provide the magnetising force. 
 
There are two possible connections. In one the secondary voltage leads the primary by 300 and in the other 
the secondary voltage lags the primary by 300.

Star / Star transformation 
Very high voltage primaries are sometimes connected in star as all the high voltage connections are then at 
the top of the transformer. The three phase primary supply does not normally have the neutral connected. 
This means that there is no circuit on the primary to balance a single phase load on the secondary. A third 
delta connected winding is usually fitted on a star/star transformer, ie the transformer is star/delta/star. 
Current circulating in the delta winding allows the transformer to supply a single phase or unbalanced 
secondary load.

Transformers
Measurement of losses and efficiency of a power transformer. 
The rated primary AC voltage is applied to the primary with the secondary open circuit. A voltmeter, 
ammeter and wattmeter are fitted to measure the primary input. The instruments measure the magnetising 
current and iron loss, ie hysteresis and eddy current loss at full volts, as the copper loss is negligible. 
These give the magnitude and power factor of the magnetising current. 
The DC resistance of the primary and secondary windings are measured in another test. 
 
A variable AC voltage is then applied to the primary with the secondary short circuited or alternatively the 
voltage is applied to the secondary with the primary short circuited. Either way, the current is raised to the 
rated value. The input voltage, current and power loss are measured. The voltage and current give the 
impedance and the wattmeter gives the total copper loss as iron loss is negligible. The voltage is the Full 
Load Impedance Voltage. 
 
The total copper loss is proportioned to the primary and secondary in the ratio of their DC resistances to 
obtain the primary and secondary copper loss. Hence the primary and secondary AC Resistances can be 
obtained., each is R  = W/ I2. 
 
The open circuit test establishes the magnitude and power factor of the magnetising current. On full load, 
the primary winding carries the vector sum of the load current and the magnetising current while the 
secondary winding carries only the load current. Thus the copper loss in the primary and secondary at full 
load can be calculated. The total loss = total copper loss plus iron loss.  
 
If the transformer is three phase, the Output Power = √ 3 V I Cos . 
If single phase. The Output Power is V I Cos . 
 
The efficiency at rated current and rated power factor can now be obtained. The efficiency = Output 
Power / (Output Power + Total Loss) 
 
The Impedance Volts % = (Full Load Impedance Volts x 100) / (Rated Volts) 
 
If required, the efficiency at part load and/or different power factors can be obtained by the same method. 
 
If required, the magnetising current magnitude and power factor can be obtained at lower voltage by the 
open circuit test carried out at the lower voltage. The curve of AC voltage against current follows roughly 
the pattern of the B – H curve for the core.  
 
Transformers are often installed as a duplicate pair each with tap changers. In this case, the transformers 
can be tested at full load current and voltage by operating them in parallel on different tap settings.

Transformers
Inrush of the magnetising current 
When the transformer is switched on, the magnetic flux builds up through the hysteresis loops. If the 
transformer has been recently switched off, there may be very significant residual magnetism in the core. 
If the transformer is switched on at the instant when the magnetising force is exactly out of phase with the 
residual magnetism, the core may become very oversaturated. In this case the self inductance of the 
winding becomes very low and the magnetising current very high. An initial magnetising current 
exceeding full load current can occur but will subside to normal within a second. I have seen the ammeter 
needle bent by the inrush of the magnetising current as the needle hit the stops. 
 
Unbalanced loads 
If the load is not balanced three phase, the primary current is related to the secondary by the turns ratio, 
not by the voltage ratio. Consider each limb of the transformer and convert the secondary current to 
primary for that limb. Add the primary current on all limbs connected to each phase to get the primary 
current in that phase.  
 
Example 
 
 
 
The diagram shows the size of the stampings for a transformer core. The dimensions 
are in cms and the core 
is 2.5 cms thick. 
 
Stacking factor 0.9 
Peak B = 1 Tesla 
 
Space factor for the copper = 0.45 
 
Current density in copper = 2 A/mm2  
 
Input voltage = 230 volts Output voltage = 6.3 volts 
Calculate the maximum rating and the sizes of wire. 
 
Cross Sectional Area of the flux path = 2.5  2.5  0.9 = 5.62 cm2 
Peak flux max = 5.62 E-4 weber 
E = 4.44 N max f = 4.44  5.62  50  N / 10000 = 0.125 N 
Thus the coils have 8 turns/volt

The 230 volt winding has 1840 turns 
The 6.3 volt winding has 50.4 turns, say 51 
 
Allow 1.5 mm all round the window. 
The window area for the windings is 6.0  2.2 = 13.2 cm2 
Net cross section of the copper is 13.2  0.45 = 5.94 cm2 
Cross section for each winding is 297 mm2 
Max current in the 230 volt winding is 2  297 / 1840 = 0.32 amps 
Hence the rating of the transformer = 230  0.32 = 74 VA 
Wire for the 230 volt winding is 297/1840 = 0.16 mm2 = 26 SWG 
Wire for the 6.3 volt winding is 297 / 51 = 5.82 mm2  
or 4 coils in parallel of 17 SWG enamelled wire

Rectifiers 
High power rectifiers  
High power rectifiers provide a high power DC supply, eg for charging a large bank of batteries, for DC 
traction motors, electric furnaces and similar applications.  
 
 
 
Rectifiers are usually semi conductor devices which are now replacing the old mercury arc rectifiers, see 
the book on Power Electronics. 
 
The six anodes are connected to the six terminals of a dedicated transformer with two windings on each 
limb. 
 
Alternatively the rectifier can be supplied from an interconnected star transformer. Let the turns ratio of 
the transformer be 1:N 
 
V1 = N(VA – VB) 
V2 = N(VA – VC) 
V3 = N(VB – VC) 
V4 = N(VB – VA) 
V5 = N(VC – VA) 
V6 = N(VC – VB)

Capacitance in the DC circuit 
 
 
 
A capacitance in the DC circuit can raise the DC voltage to the maximum (ie peak) value of the 
AC voltage.  
 
A current limiting device (eg a resistor) is usually fitted between the rectifier and the capacitance 
otherwise the high initial charging current of the capacitance can damage the rectifier. If there is no DC 
load, the voltage across the capacitance rises till it reaches the peak value of the supply.  
 
With a DC load, the current flows from the supply only when its voltage exceeds the capacitance voltage. 
Thus when there is a DC load, the voltage across the capacitance falls to allow current to flow from the 
supply. The resistor increases the voltage drop even more.

In the diagram, V is the voltage across the capacitance. 
Assume the capacitance is large enough for V to be considered constant. 
The current flowing from the supply between θ1 and θ2 is 
 
i = [Vp Sin θ – V] / R 
The total quantity of electricity flowing from the supply in one cycle is proportional to the shaded area.  
Q = ∫[Vp Sin θ – V] / R dθ 
But this is the same as the total quantity of electricity flowing in the load in one complete cycle  
    = IDC 2π  where  IDC is the DC load current. 
 
IDC 2 π =   [ – Vp Cos θ – V θ ] / R  from θ1 to θ2 
          =  2 [– Vp Cos θ – V θ ] / R  from θ1 to  π / 2 
 
          =  2 [– Vp Cos (π / 2) – V (π / 2) + Vp Cos θ1 + V θ1 ] / R 
 
          =  2 [– V(π / 2 – θ1) + Vp Cos θ1] / R 
But Vp Sin θ1= V  
Vp Cos θ1 – Vp Sin θ1 (π / 2 – θ1) = πRIDC  
Hence θ1 can be evaluated and hence V = Vp Sin θ1 
 
Capacitance in DC output from a multi phase rectifier 
Let the supply have Z phases 
Then in one cycle, current input = Z times current input of each phase 
Other parameters being equal, DC current per phase= IDC / Z 
where IDC is the total DC current. 
 
Hence Vp Cos θ1 – Vp Sin θ1 (π / 2 – θ1) = πR IDC /Z 
Evaluate θ1 and put V = Vp Sin θ1 
 
For example 
CLS

Harmonics due to rectifiers 
The dc output from a rectifier is often smoothed by a series inductance.  The rectifier then draws a square 
wave from the supply.  The square wave will contain harmonics.  If the rectifier is high power or the load 
contains many rectifiers, eg computer terminals, the harmonics can cause problems in the system..  
However the load can be analysed by Fourier analysis to obtain the magnitude of each harmonic as the 
example on generator harmonics, as shown in the example on page 108.

Power Lines
Power Lines 
 
Transmission lines 
Transmission lines are usually on lattice towers and in the UK operate at a voltage of 110 kV, 230 kV or 
400 kV three phase. Insulators are nearly always pendant type (ie string insulators). Power lines at these 
voltages are usually double circuit (ie two independent three phase systems, a total of six power lines and 
one earth wire).  
 
High Tension Distribution Lines 
HT Distribution lines are usually on poles which can be lattice galvanized steel, tubular steel, creosoted 
wood or reinforced concrete. In the UK, high tension distribution lines operate typically at 11 kV, 33 kV 
or 66 kV. Lower voltages of 3.3 kV or 6.6 kV have been used but these have no advantage over 11 kV and 
the power loss is higher.  
 
 
 
At voltages up to about 11 kV, line insulators are usually pin type. Above about 11 kV, the insulators are 
usually suspension type. At the end of the lines and at section poles suspension insulators are used to 
apply the tension. Section poles and angle poles (where the line deviates from a straight line) are often 
stronger than intermediate poles. The section and angle poles usually have stay wires to a ground anchor 
so that the pole can withstand a horizontal force at the top of the pole. 
 
Power line conductors are traditionally hard drawn copper but higher voltage lines now usually use 
aluminium conductors round a steel central core.  
 
Power lines often have a steel earth wire which is usually above the power lines. This to some extent 
shields the power line from lightening strikes and prevents a pole becoming “live” in the event of an 
insulator failure. An earth wire has other advantages but is by no means universal. 
 
Surge diverters 
When a power line is struck by lightening, transformers or other equipment connected to the line can be 
damaged. The risk is reduced by “arcing horns” to provide a spark gap across every insulator and surge 
diverters at the ends of the line. 
 
Surge diverters (Metrosil or equivalent) are non-linear resistors connected between the lines and earth 
through a spark gap. The non-linear resistors have a high resistance at low current but the resistance falls 
by orders of magnitude when the voltage exceeds the rated voltage. A lightening strike is thus short 
circuited to earth. After the lightening strike, the current falls to a value that should extinguish the arc at 
the spark gap. The surge diverter will save the switchgear and transformers but may be destroyed by the 
lightening strike. Doubling the voltage across a surge diverter typically increases the current by a factor of 
twenty.

Power Lines
 
Impedance and capacitance 
The impedance of power lines is relatively high compared to cables as the self inductance is proportional 
to ln(d/r).  Capacitance however is inversely proportional to ln(d/r) so the capacitance is relatively low 
compared to cables.  Power lines often have a high proportion of steel in their cross section so have a 
relatively high resistance.  Furthermore power lines can have a lower cross section than cables due to the 
greater cooling of the bare wire in air.   
 
High Tension Underground cables 
HT cables are now usually cross linked poly-ethylene (XPLE).  These replace the traditional paper 
insulated cables (PILCSWA&S) ie paper insulated, lead covered, steel wire or steel tape armoured and 
served. 
 
Buried cable joints are enclosed in a metal box in two halves.   When the cable cores have been soldered 
together and insulated with tape, the box halves are united and filled with epoxy resin, or in the case of 
paper cables, filled with bitumen.  XPLE cable joints in air are made watertight by heat shrunk plastic 
covers.  It is prudent to keep a record of the exact location of buried joints. 
 
Cable cores are traditionally copper but aluminium is sometimes used. 
 
Medium Voltage lines and cables 
MV cables in the UK operate at about 420 volts three phase four wire or about 240 volt single phase two 
wire. MV overhead lines are now only used for low cost supplies in rural areas, cables being more normal 
in urban areas.  
 
MV cables are now usually PVCSWAPVC (ie pvc insulated, steel wire armored and pvc sheathed. 
Conductors are copper or aluminium. Copper is easier to solder and terminate but aluminium is cheaper. 
 
Large sizes of three or four core cables are difficult to install. A popular arrangement for high current 
applications is ten single core cables, three each phase and one for the neutral. A single core cable induces 
a magnetic field. Single core cables therefore can be sheathed in lead but cannot have a magnetic 
armouring. They are often laid in trefoil, ie in groups of three, one each phase, strapped together to 
withstand the bursting force of the current. Any magnetic material near a single core cable can be subject 
to induction heating. Particular care is needed where single core cables pass through a steel bulkhead. If 
three cables on the same phase pass through a steel bulkhead in line then the impedance of the centre cable 
is less than the impedance of the cables at each end due to eddy current loss. Thus the middle cable will 
carry most of the load. 
 
Single core PVC cables to cathodic protection ground beds do not last. The chlorine released at the ground 
bed destroys the PVC. High density polyethelyne cables resist the chlorine.

Neutral Earthing
Neutral Earthing
 
Power System Earth connection 
The neutral point of generators and transformer secondaries is connected to earth to hold the voltage of 
each phase constant relative to earth. Failure to do so can result in dangerously high voltages building up 
relative to earth. All cables on the system have capacitance to earth so an earth fault anywhere on an 
unearthed AC system will result in current flowing through the fault which may be too small to be 
detected by the protection system while being large enough to be fatal to humans or animals. 
 
To avoid third harmonic currents circulating between generators, it is usual to earth only one of the 
neutrals of high voltage generators running in parallel;. This is usually done through an earthing resistor to 
limit the earth fault current to full load. Earthing only one generator neutral can cause problems if there is 
an earth fault on the system that is cleared at the generator. It leaves the other generators feeding the fault 
by capacitive current. 
 
Some power stations operate with a reactance in the neutral of each set. However this can resonate with 
the system capacitance at third harmonic frequency. The problem can suddenly appear when a new feeder 
is added to the system. If the reactor is iron cored then it can resonate at high current but not at low 
current. In such cases, the system can be unstable and resonate suddenly without warning. If this happens, 
there will be a loud 150 hz buzz on all the telephones. 
 
The problem is solved if each generator has a unit transformer, ie each generator is directly connected to a 
delta/star transformer with the generator switching done on the secondary of the unit transformer. Each 
generator can have its own neutral connection that is separate from the other generators. The generator 
third harmonic voltage appears at each end of the transformer delta winding. There is no third harmonic 
current in the transformer primary so there is no third harmonic voltage on the transformer secondary. The 
transformer secondaries can all be connected to the same neutral point, either with or without a neutral 
earthing resistor.  
 
Earth Electrodes 
The earth electrodes for a power station or substation are typically steel or copper pipes set vertically in 
the ground and extending down to the water table. The earth points are usually in pairs with links so that 
either can be disconnected and tested without disconnecting the station earth. In arid areas, water well 
drilling equipment may be used to drill and case a pipe down to the water table for use as an earthing 
electrode. 
 
For safety reasons, the conductors in multicore cables are enclosed in earthed steel armouring. High 
current single core AC cables may be unarmoured to avoid a magnetic path round the conductor but in 
that case will have an earthed non-magnetic conducting sheath. Such cables are usually laid in trefoil ie in 
groups of three cables, one cable of each phase. The cables are clamped together and the clamps must be 
strong enough to withstand the forces between the cables in the event of a through fault. The armouring or 
sheath provides a relatively low impedance connection back to the system neutral.

Neutral Earthing
Power lines often but not always have a separate earth wire above the conductors. This provides a path for 
earth faults back to the system earth and prevents a pole becoming live. It also provides a measure of 
protection against a lightening strike, although a lightening strike is likely to break the earth wire while 
saving more expensive equipment. 
 
Earthing Resistors 
Single phase to earth fault currents can exceed the value of any other fault. Therefore to limit the damage 
done during a fault, a resistor is often installed between the neutral point of high voltage generators and 
transformers and the system earth. Earthing resistors are usually cast iron in an earthed metal vented 
enclosure similar to starting resistors for DC motors. Earthing resistors are usually sized to limit the earth 
fault current to the full load of one generator or transformer. In such an event, the voltage to earth of the 
faulty phase falls to zero while the other phases rise to line voltage to earth. Earthing resistors are usually 
rated to carry the full current for 30 seconds only. Protection must be fitted to switch off the faulty circuit 
within this period. 
 
Neutral earthing of medium voltage power stations 
A problem arises with the neutral earthing of medium voltage power stations. If the neutrals of all running 
generators are earthed, large third harmonic currents will circulate between the generators. The third 
harmonic voltages on all three phases are in phase. Any difference in the voltage between two generators 
results in a current of three times the phase current through the neutral. When a set is first synchronized, 
the emf is much lower on the incoming set than the emf on the running sets. The third harmonic current 
can prevent the set being synchronized unless the neutral isolator on the incoming set is open until the set 
is loaded up. This complicates the operating procedure and there is always the risk that the third harmonic 
current on running sets could overload the sets.  
 
The problem is overcome in some power stations by only earthing one generator neutral, but this risks the 
much higher danger of losing the neutral connection for the system if this generator trips. In such an event, 
a consumer’s voltage could suddenly rise without warning from 240 volts to 400 volts. 
 
A better arrangement is to have dedicated earthing transformers solidly connected to each section of the 
busbars. The transformer winding is connected in star and the star point solidly connected to the neutral 
busbar and to the power station earth. The transformer also has a delta winding. Current circulating 
through this winding allows a single phase to earth current to flow in the star connected primary winding. 
 
Earthing connectios 
Earthing connections within a power station or substation are usually made by copper strip with joints 
riveted and soldered. Generators, transformers and large motors have their metal enclosures connected by 
copper strip to the station earth. In hazardous areas, the earthing connections may be made by single core 
insulated cable to prevent the risk of sparking across to adjacent plant.

Switchgear 
Breaking a high power electric current 
When the contacts of a switch open, due to the inductance in the circuit, an arc occurs as the current 
continues to flow. The arc ionises the air and ionised air is a conductor. Thus as the contacts move further 
apart, the arc is drawn longer and longer causing intense heating. The contacts are quickly destroyed 
unless there is some mechanism to extinguish the arc. The MVA rupturing capacity of a switchboard is the 
maximum current that it can safely interrupt expressed in MVA as a three phase current at the rated 
voltage.
Air break switchgear 
A typical method of extinguishing the arc is the use of an arc chute. The contacts are fitted with horns 
above the main contacts. The horns are situated in a heat resistant box open at the top and bottom. The 
heat from the arc causes the air to rise. This draws the arc up along the horns and into the heat resistant 
box and draws in air that has not been ionized. This box is fitted with vertical partitions greatly extending 
the path of the arc and ultimately extinguishing it. 
Oil break switchgear 
The contacts in oil break switchgear are enclosed in a tank filled with oil. The contacts are enclosed in a 
heat resistant box with passages such that as the oil vaporises the passages direct a blast of oil across the 
contacts which extinguishes the arc.

Switchgear
Air blast switchgear 
The interrupter in air blast switchgear consists of a ball in contact with the end of a tube. When the switch 
opens, the tube is connected to an air receiver at high pressure. As the ball leaves the end of the tube, the 
high pressure air is released causing a blast across the contacts of air that is not ionised. This interrupts the 
current long enough for a separate off load isolator to open. Air blast switchgear is particularly suited to 
outdoor installations. 
 
Vacuum Breakers 
The contacts are in a vacuum. There is therefore no air to ionise. 
 
SF6 swithchgear 
The contacts are in Sulphur Hexaflouride, SF6. 
 
Closing and tripping mechanism 
Air break and oil break switchgear is usually closed by a powerful solenoid. The closing mechanism 
contains a strut in compression with a knee which can collapse. Normally the knee is “over centre”, the 
strut remains straight and operates in compression. When the circuit breaker is closed, it latches 
mechanically through this strut. A separate trip coil bends the knee. If the trip coil is energised, the knee 
bends releasing the circuit breaker. The circuit breaker trips whether or not the closing solenoid is 
energised.  
 
Busbars 
Circuit breakers connect the circuit to the busbars. The busbars are heavy section copper strips extending 
the full length of the switchboard. There is one busbar for each phase and for 4 pole circuit breakers a 
fourth busbar for the neutral. The switchboard is often in two or more sections with a circuit breaker 
between each section connecting the busbars. Major switchboards often have duplicate busbars ie a main 
and a standby busbar for each circuit breaker. In this case a further circuit breaker is required in each 
section to parallel the busbars. Each circuit breaker then has an off load isolator to select the busbar. This 
isolator is “make before break” and must be interlocked by a foolproof interlock so that it can only be 
operated when the appropriate busbar connecting circuit breaker is closed. Overriding this interlock would 
cause an explosion.  
 
Plugging type switchboards 
Major switchboards are plugging type. Each circuit breaker is plugged into the busbars and circuit. There 
are two common types, vertical and horizontal plugging. Vertical plugging circuit breakers are on wheels, 
ie truck type. These are pushed into the switchboard under the busbar and circuit “spouts”. The circuit 
breaker is then jacked up along guides and plugged into the busbar and circuit chamber spouts.

Switchgear
 
 
Vertical Plugging, metalclad oil break switchboard 
 
When maintenance work is to be done on the circuit, the circuit breaker is lowered and removed and locks 
fitted to shutters that close over the busbar and circuit spouts and preventing the circuit breaker being 
plugged in. The shutter locks play an essential part in the permit to work system. 
 
Horizontal plugging switchgear is racked in or out by a ratchet lever with the circuit breaker running on 
rails. Again there is provision for locks to be fitted to the busbar and circuit shutters. 
 
Contactors 
Medium volt motors are usually switched by contactors. These differ from switchgear in that the contactor 
is held closed by the contactor coil. If the supply fails, the contactor opens. This is unlike switchgear 
which latches closed and remains firmly closed until opened by the trip coil. Contactors suffer if the 
supply voltage falls below a minimum value as the contactor may partially open at the very time that the 
motor takes a higher current. This can destroy the contacts or in some cases weld them closed. 
 
Instrument Transformers 
 
Current Transformer (or CT) 
It is inconvenient to connect Ammeters directly in high voltage high current circuits. 
 
 
 
Instead a Current Transformer is installed in the circuit. These usually have a single bar of copper as the 
Primary winding. The secondary is wound so that at the design rating, the secondary  
ampere turns almost exactly match the primary ampere turns in  
both magnitude and phase angle. The net magnetising force is small.

Electrical Power
153 
Switchgear
The secondary is usually wound for 5 amps at the rated full load but may be other values (eg 1 amp). 
 
The CT is a relatively small device perhaps a 6 inch cube and weighs a few pounds. In metal clad 
switchgear, they are installed in the CT chamber, a metal box at ground potential through which the high 
voltage conductors pass. 
 
If the secondary is open circuited while the primary is on load, the full primary current becomes the 
magnetising current. This can cause a lethal voltage exceeding 1000 volts on the secondary and can 
permanently damage the current transformer.  
 
Voltage Transformers (or VT or PT) 
Voltage (or Potential) Transformers are connected directly to the high voltage circuit. The VT primary 
winding is connected across the full circuit voltage. It is usually metal clad with spouts or bushings to 
connect to the high voltage conductors. The secondary low voltage connection is by plug and socket. The 
VT can weigh anything from 50 kg to several tons, and its removal from the switchgear usually requires a 
crane.

The primary of a VT can be connected to the three phases in star or in delta. The secondary is also in star 
or delta to match the primary. However one of the secondary phases, usually the yellow phase, is earthed. 
The red and blue phases of the secondary are usually at 110 volts to earth at full design primary volts. 
Thus the secondary red to earth is proportional to the red to yellow primary volts in both magnitude and 
direction. Similarly the secondary blue to earth volts is proportional to the primary blue to yellow volts in 
magnitude and direction. Similarly, the secondary red to blue volts is proportional to the primary red to 
blue volts in magnitude and direction.  
 
Some installations use an “open delta” secondary connection. Here the red to blue winding of the 
secondary is not connected to the other windings. The three connections to the red-yellow and yellow-blue 
windings are connected to the red, earth and blue circuits in the normal way, but the red-blue winding is 
connected to two more secondary terminals allowing this winding to be used for a separated designated 
purpose, eg a generator automatic voltage regulator. 
 
Control And Indication 
 
Circuit breaker close and trip circuits 
 
 
 
 
 
Circuit Breakers are usually closed by a solenoid operated by a contactor and tripped directly by a trip coil. 
The trip coil and closing contactor operate on DC from a battery but the solenoid may operate on DC from 
a battery, or on AC or rectified AC. Alternatively, the closing mechanism may be operated by a 
precharged powerful spring that is released by the closing contactor.  
 
During closing, the auxiliary switch in the trip circuit closes before the main contacts make. During 
tripping, the auxiliary switch in the tripping circuit opens after the main contacts have opened. 
 
The circuit breaker must not close unless the trip fuses are intact so the closing contactor circuit is always 
routed through the trip fuses. There is a slight danger that the closing contactor may be faulty allowing the 
circuit breaker to close but blowing the trip fuses. Some manufacturers therefore have trip fuses rated 
about 15 amps and additional 4 amp fuses for the closing contactor supplied through the trip fuses. 
 
Circuit breaker indication circuits 
The circuit breaker usually has green, red and amber indicator lamps to show if the circuit breaker is open, 
closed or has tripped on fault.

Current Transformer circuits 
The over current and earth fault protection relays and the ammeter are supplied from current transformers 
on the main circuit conductors. The CT secondary current is proportional to and in phase with the CT 
primary current. 
 
 
 
Voltage Transformer circuits 
Voltage transformers are usually fitted to incoming circuit breakers.  
They can be star connected. 
 
 
 
Or they can be delta connected. 
 
 
 
With either connection, the secondary r – y and r – b voltages are proportional to and in phase with the 
primary R – Y and B – Y voltages. 
 
Incoming circuit breakers usually have a voltage transformer connected to a voltmeter and the voltage 
coils of a directional over current relay. 
 
When fitted, a kilowatt meter, a reactive kVA (ie kVAr) meter, a kilowatthour meter, a power factor 
indicator and a frequency meter each require a supply from the voltage transformer.

A directional earth fault relay requires a special voltage transformer.  
 
 
 
The primary is star connected in the normal way but the secondary winding is connected in open delta. 
Under normal conditions, there is no output voltage on the open ends of this winding. Under fault 
conditions, one or more of the primary voltages is reduced giving a voltage on the open delta winding. 
The phase relation of this voltage depends on the phase or phases suffering the fault as does the phase 
relation of the fault current. 
 
Alternator circuit breaker circuits 
The alternator circuit breaker must not be closed unless (i) the voltage is the same as the system voltage 
and (ii) the frequency is the same as the system frequency and (iii) the voltage is in phase with the system 
voltage. 
 
Condition (i) above is met by adjacent voltmeters showing the two voltages. 
Conditions (ii) and (iii) are met by a synchroscope.

When the start button is pressed, the contactor closes and remains closed through an auxiliary contact on 
the contactor. 
 
The contactor is opened either by the stop button or by any normally closed contact in series. The overload 
is usually thermal (eg bi-metal strips heated by the load current, often with single phase protection). 
Sometimes there are additional trips (eg earth fault protection). If there is no single phase protection, then 
a blown fuse may result in the motor burning out. 
 
In the event of power failure, the contactor opens. When power is resumed, the contactor remains open 
until manually restarted. 
 
When the contactor closes, there is initially a large current through the coil limited mainly by the coil 
resistance. This gives a strong closing force. When the contactor is closed, the air gap in the magnetic 
circuit is reduced, the self inductance of the coil is increased and the coil current is reduced to an 
economical level.

Instruments 
 
Moving Coil Meters 
Moving coil instruments measure DC volts and amps or rectified AC volts or amps. They are accurate but 
are moderately expensive. The scale is linear. 
 
 
 
The moving coil is mounted on needle point bearings. It swings between the poles of a permanent magnet 
and round a cylindrical soft iron core. 
 
The connections to the coil are through spiral springs at the front and back of the spindle which also 
provide the restraining torque. 
 
The coil is wound with fine wire to give full scale deflection (fsd) with a current which is typically 
between 50 μA and 1mA and at a voltage typically 75mV. 
 
When used as a voltmeter, it is connected in series with a high resistance. 
 
 
 
When used as an ammeter to measure a high DC current, a shunt resistor is connected in the circuit and 
the meter measures the voltage across the shunt. The connections to the meter are on the shunt between 
the main connections. 
 
A moving coil meter can be used to measure AC volts or amps when connected to a rectifier, usually a full 
wave rectifier. The meter measures the average value for a half wave (0.636 of peak value) but is 
calibrated to display the rms value (0.707 of the peak value). Thus different resistances are needed for 
readings of DC and AC. The AC reading depends on the form factor of the wave and to some extent on 
the frequency 
 
A moving coil instrument cannot be used to measure watts.

Moving iron meters  
Moving iron instruments contain a fixed and a moving iron element in a fixed coil. The moving iron is 
restrained by a spring. 
 
Current in the coil magnetises both iron elements similarly and they repel each other.  
 
 
 
Moving iron instruments measure DC or AC volts and amps. When calibrated on DC, the meter will read 
the rms value of low frequency. AC current but due to the inductance of the coil should be calibrated on 
AC for reading AC volts. The deflection is approximately proportional to the square of the current. On AC 
the reading depends on the frequency but is not so dependant on form factor. 
 
Moving iron instruments are cheap but not very accurate, typically 5%. Errors arise due to residual 
magnetism in the moving iron or stray magnetic fields. 
 
Solenoid type moving iron meter 
If the coil is a solenoid pulling the moving iron against a spring, without a fixed iron element, the 
deflection is more linear. The moving iron can be shaped to give any desired response. 
 
 
 
Permanent magnet moving iron meter 
If the moving iron is a permanent magnet outside the coil, and the coil has a fixed iron core, then the 
moving iron meter is proportional to the current in the coil and the pointer deflection shows the direction 
of the current.

Dynamometer instruments 
Dynamometer instruments are used for high accuracy measurement of DC or AC volts, amps or watts. 
The instrument has a fixed coil and a moving coil suspended on a filament. The fixed coil is often in two 
parts each side of the moving coil. It is intended for laboratory use but can be used with care in the field. 
Laboratory “sub-standard” voltmeters, ammeters and wattmeters are usually dynamometer type. The 
moving coil of a dynamometer ammeter is shunted by a low resistance. 
 
For DC or AC voltage measurements, both the fixed and the moving coil are connected in series and in 
series with a resistance. For accurate measurements of AC volts, the instrument should be calibrated on 
AC at the same frequency. 
 
For DC or AC current measurements, both coils are connected in series and the instrument measures the 
volt drop across a shunt. For use on AC, the instrument should be calibrated at the same frequency. 
 
A dynamometer instrument can be used to measure watts. One coil is connected through a series 
resistance to the voltage and the other coil is connected to a shunt or current transformer in the current 
circuit. For accurate AC measurements, the instrument should be calibrated on AC at the same frequency. 
However the self inductance of the coil means that the current in the voltage coil is not in phase with the 
voltage. There is therefore an unavoidable error in the phase angle between the current in the voltage coil 
and the current in the current coil unless the instrument has been calibrated at the same power factor. 
 
 
 
 
 
When used as a wattmeter, the voltage connection can be upstream or downstream of the current coil. If V 
is small and I is large, the voltage connection should be nearest to the load so that the voltage does not 
include the drop across the current coil. Conversely, if the voltage is large and the current is low, connect 
the voltage upstream of the current coil so that the current coil does not include the current in the voltage 
coil. 
A 1st grade voltmeter has an accuracy of 1% of fsd, ammeter 1½ % and a wattmeter 2½% 
 
Hot wire instruments  
Hot wire can measure DC or AC with no frequency or wave form error but have a low overload capacity. 
They are cheap and not very accurate.

A hot wire instrument contains a resistance wire that is heated by the current. The expansion of the wire is 
used to deflect the pointer. The long term accuracy is poor and the instrument is easily damaged by 
overload. There is a delay in the reading as the wire heats up. 
 
However the instrument can be calibrated on DC and will then read correctly on AC at any frequency or 
form factor provided the self inductance is negligible. 
 
Electrostatic Voltmeter 
High voltages can be measured by the electrostatic force between two plates. In the simplest form, the 
force can be measured by a balance but this is hardly practicable outside a laboratory.  
 
 
 
Practical electrostatic voltmeters have a fixed and a moving vane that overlap. The moving vane is 
restrained by a spring.  
 
 
 
When a high voltage, typically tens of kV, is applied between the vanes, they try to increase the overlap. 
 
The voltmeter for a high voltage test set is often electrostatic. On a 0 to 1000 volt scale, the markings will 
not be shown below 500 volt due to insensitivity at low deflections. Electrostatic meters take no current  
on DC. 
 
DC Ampere Hour or Coulomb meter 
DC quantity of electricity can be measured by electrolysis. A typical meter is shown. A glass container is 
filled with mercury and a liquid mercury salt solution. When current flows, mercury is transferred to the 
hopper in proportion to the ampere hours. When the tube fills, it siphons out so the quantity in the base is 
an integral number of the volume in the U tube.

Induction meter  
Consider a cylindrical drum of thin metal which is subjected to two AC fluxes Φ1 and Φ2 both in the same 
phase. These induce currents I1 and I2 in the drum. By Lens’ law, these oppose the ampere turns of the 
magnetising forces. But due to leakage flux the currents lag the fluxes that induce them.

It can be seen that Φ1 and I2 exert an anti-clockwise torque on the drum while Φ2 and Φ1 exert a clockwise 
torque. The drum does not rotate when Φ1 and Φ2 are in phase. 
The torque due to I1 is proportional to I1 rms Φ2 rms Cos α where 
α is the phase angle between I1 and Φ2 due to the leakage flux. 
 
Consider now if Φ1 and Φ2 are not in phase. Let Φ1 lead Φ2 by β. 
 
The torques are proportional to 
Φ1 rms I2 rms Cos (α + β)  
and Φ2 rms I1 rms Cos (β - α) and are no longer equal.  
 
 
 
The magnetising forces exert a torque on the drum proportional to  
  
Φ2 rms I1 rms Cos (β - α) - Φ1 rms I2 rms Cos (α + β) 
 
If Φ1 rms = Φ2 rms then I1 rms = I2 rms and 
Torque  = K Φrms Irms [Cos (β - α) - Cos (α + β)] 
              = K Φrms Irms Sin α Sin β 
 
Disc Induction Meter  
If the drum is rolled out flat, it becomes a disc. The disc will rotate if subjected to the interlinking flux of 
two coils carrying AC currents which are not in phase. 
 
 
 
The two coils can be supplied from the same source if one is supplied through a resistance or capacitance. 
Alternatively, one of the poles could be a “shaded pole”, ie be fitted with a thick copper band.

Watt Hour Induction Meter 
The Watt Hour meter has one coil connected to the voltage  
and the current in this coil lags the voltage by 900. The other  
coil is connected to carry the current. 
 
Thus β = 900– φ and Sin β = Cos φ 
The torque is proportional to V I Cos φ = watts  
 
 
 
A permanent magnet is fitted round the disc. This causes an eddy current loss proportional to (speed) 2. 
 
This loss exerts a braking torque 
The braking torque x speed = loss 
braking torque = K (speed) 2/(speed 
  
            = K speed. 
But the driving torque = braking torque 
Thus  speed is proportional to watts 
 
Hence the number of rotations is proportional to watt hours 
 
Example 
An induction meter has a copper disc. The disc is changed to an aluminium disc of the same size. The 
speed is to be increased by 50% for the same torque. Find the change in restraining magnet strength. 
Specific resistance of aluminium = 1.7 x specific resistance of copper

Fluxmeter 
A DC fluxmeter is a moving coil meter without a spring connected to a search coil. When the flux through 
the coil is changed, a current flows through the meter which is restrained only by its own back emf e. 
Meter coil has n turns, area A, flux density B and carries a current i 
Search coil has N turns and the flux is Φ, circuit resistance R and inductance L 
 
Torque on meter coil T = i n A B 
 
Back emf e = n A B dθ /dt where θ is the deflection.

Let moment of inertia of meter coil be J 
 
T = J d2θ/dt2  = J dω/dt 
Eliminate T,  i n A B = J dω/dt 
hence i = (J/nAB) dω/dt 
 
Emf in search coil = N dΦ/dt = L di/dt + R i + e 
Substitute for e and i 
N dΦ/dt – nAB dθ/dt = L di/dt + (RJ/nAB) dω/dt 
 
Integrate wrt t from 1 to 2 
N (Φ2 - Φ1 ) – nAB (θ2 - θ1 ) = L (i2 – i1 ) + (RJ/nAB) (ω2 – ω1 ) 
 
At start and finish, i = 0 and ω = 0 
Thus 
N (Φ2 – Φ1 ) – nAB (θ2 – θ1 ) 
ie the deflection of the meter is proportional to the change in flux 
 
Example 
The voltage coil of a wattmeter has inductance 4 mH and is in series with a 2 kΩ resistance. The meter has 
been calibrated on DC. 
The meter reads 50 watts at a load current of 1 amp at 160 volts and 1 kHz. Find the % error. 
Reactance of coil = 2πfL = 25.13 ohms 
Phase angle of current in voltage coil = arc tan (25.13/2000) = 0.7199 degrees 
Cos φ = W/(VI) = 50/(160  1) therefore φ = 71.790 degrees 
True watts = 160  1  Cos (71.790 + 0.720) = 48.09 Hence Error = 4%

Protection
Protection
 
Electrical Protection 
Electrical Protection operates in conjunction with switchgear to automatically switch off faulty equipment. 
A fault on duplicate feeders is detected by the protection which trips the switches at both ends of the faulty 
equipment. The supply to consumers is not affected as the other feeder remains in service. 
 
Over Current and Earth Fault 
Over current and earth fault protection trips the switch if the current in any phase exceeds the design or if 
the current in any phase returns through earth. The earth fault current is detected by residual connection of 
the current transformers. Current in any phase that does not return through another phase or the neutral 
activates the protection. One method is to route all three phases and the neutral through one current 
transformer. The secondary then carries the vector sum of these currents. 
 
Many three wire systems use a resistance in the neutral to limit the earth fault current to no more than full 
load. In this case sensitive earth fault protection is mandatory, usually operating if an earth fault of 10% 
full load is detected. 
 
Over current and earth fault protection is usually time lagged so that the switches trip in sequence till the 
fault is cleared. The most common type is Inverse Definite Minimum Time Lagged (IDMTL O/C & E/F) 
protection. The relay is induction type and the angle of rotation gives the time lag. The time lag is 
inversely proportional to the current up to about 20 times the setting. Above this, the time lag is constant 
and typically can be set at any value between 0.1 and 2 seconds. 
 
In many cases, time lagged over current and earth fault protection on its own is unsatisfactory. Switches 
closest to the power station trip last. Thus faults near the power station, which are the heaviest faults take 
longest to clear. 
 
HRC Fuses 
Medium Voltage Feeders are often protected only by High Rupturing Capacity Fuses. These clear the fault 
in a fraction of a cycle, before it has risen to its first peak value. Thus faults with a prospective high fault 
level can be safely cleared.  
 
Instantaneous Over Current and earth fault protection 
If the equipment has relatively high impedance (eg a transformer), then over current and earth fault 
protection, which is set to operate above the maximum through fault value, can be instantaneous. 
 
Circulating Current Protection 
This protection compares the current flowing into the protected equipment with the current leaving. If they 
are not the same, the protection operates.

Protection
Restricted Earth Fault Protection 
Restricted Earth Fault protection is a form of circulating current protection. Current transformers are fitted 
to each phase and the neutral and the vector sum is measured. Any current leaving a phase that does not 
return through another phase or the neutral trips the protection. Restricted Earth Fault Protection only 
detects earth faults within the protected zone. 
 
Distance Protection 
This protection measures both current and voltage. The voltage divided by the current gives the 
impedance to the fault. The time lag of the protection is related to the impedance. If the impedance is low, 
the protection clears quickly. If the impedance is high, the time delay is longer. Thus switches nearest the 
fault clear the fault first. 
 
Generator Protection 
AC generators are usually provided with circulating current or restricted earth fault protection. Circulating 
current protection applied to each winding protects against all faults on the winding except inter turn faults 
on the same winding. This protection has current transformers in the neutral pit and in the main output 
circuit breaker. The protection operates if current entering a winding from the neutral does not leave 
through the main circuit breaker. 
 
If the star point of the generator is within the windings, then circulating current protection must be of 
restricted earth fault type. Restricted earth fault protection does not protect against faults between 
windings. However inter turn faults and faults between windings will quickly develop into earth faults.  
 
If the current transformers are not exactly balanced, a high value through fault may operate the circulating 
current protection incorrectly. To avoid this, some relays have a “bias” restraining coil of a few turns 
which carries the through current. Alternatively, a series resistance of the right value in the relay circuit 
can be used and the protection is then called Unbiased Circulating Current Protection. 
 
Simple time lagged overcurrent protection is unsatisfactory for generators. Over current protection without 
voltage restraint may not operate due to the demagnetizing effect of a heavy low power factor current. The 
over current protection must be time lagged to allow feeders to clear the fault before the power station is 
shut down. By this time, the fault current may have fallen below the overload setting of a relay that does 
not have voltage restraint. Generators are therefore usually provided with voltage restrained time lagged 
overcurrent protection. At full voltage, the current setting is above full load, but at lower voltage, the 
current setting is lower. 
 
Reverse power protection is often provided. If the generator prime mover shuts down, the generator may 
act as a motor and keep the machine rotating. Reverse power protection prevents this. 
 
Negative Phase Sequence protection is sometimes provided for large generators. This operates if the 
currents in each phase are so different that the uneven heating in the generator will damage the generator. 
 
Over and Under Voltage Protection is sometimes provided to shut down the machine if the AVR has 
become faulty causing the voltage to go out of range. 
However this may not operate if several generators are running in parallel.

Cables and Power Lines 
Cables and Distribution lines are usually provided with IDMT Over current and Earth Fault protection. 
Transmission lines use more sophisticated protection eg Distance Protection. 
 
Circulating current protection can be applied to cables or power lines but then a pilot cable or carrier wave 
is needed to transmit the information to the far end for comparison. One pilot cable system converts the 
three phase current to a single phase voltage with different conversion factors for each phase. The 
protection system at each end compares the two voltages and trips the local circuit breaker if they are not 
the same. Transmission lines often use a high frequency carrier wave on the power line to transmit the 
information and also for telecommunication between the substations. 
 
Directional overcurrent and earth fault protection is usually fitted at the receiving end of duplicate power 
lines or cables unless circulating current protection is fitted. This is to prevent a feed back to the fault. It is 
usually time lagged to trip before the overcurrent on the healthy feeder. 
 
Transformer Protection 
Instantaneous earth fault protection with a low current setting can be provided on the primary side of a 
delta/star transformer. An earth fault on the secondary side is seen by the primary as a phase to phase fault. 
Instantaneous over current protection can be fitted on the primary provided it is set at a current above the 
through fault value. The Protection should trip both the HV and LV circuit breakers

Protection
Time lagged over current protection is required on the primary to protect against overload and through 
faults that are not cleared elsewhere. This should be on all three phases. The traditional two over current 
and earth fault relay is unsatisfactory as phase to phase faults on the secondary of a delta/star transformer 
are seen as one high current and two lower currents on the primary. Thus fault clearance times would 
depend on which phases the fault occurs. A three phase overcurrent relay and a separate earth fault relay 
are preferable.  
 
Directional overcurrent and earth fault protection is usually provided on the secondary side of duplicate 
transformers to prevent the secondary feeding back to a fault on the primary side. As this current may be 
nearly zero power factor, appropriate phase displacement of the voltage connection is needed.  
 
The secondary windings of a transformer are usually protected by Restricted Earth Fault Protection. This 
protection operates if the vector sum of the three phases and the neutral on the secondary is above the 
setting, typically 10% full load. The setting is low to protect against faults near the star point. 
 
Circulating current protection can be used with appropriate current transformer ratios. For a delta/star 
transformer, the CTs are connected in star on the primary and delta on the secondary. The protection must 
be time lagged to allow the magnetizing current to stabilize. The magnetizing current is seen as an in zone 
fault and this current can exceed full load current for several cycles when the transformer is switched on. 
Furthermore, many transformers have a tap changer to allow the turns ratio to be changed. The current 
setting of circulating current protection must be high enough to prevent spurious operation with an out of 
zone through fault on any tap setting. 
 
Buchholtz Protection 
Buchholtz Protection detects faults in oil filled transformers. It consists of a chamber in the oil pipe 
between the transformer and its expansion tank. It contains a float switch which sounds an alarm if air or 
vapour collects in the chamber. This is often an indication that there is a fault between turns in the 
winding or a fault between laminations in the core and provides early warning that maintenance is needed. 
 
A separate trip switch is operated by a flap in the Buchholtz chamber. In the event of a more severe fault, 
there is a rush of oil or vapour through the Buchholtz chamber which operates this flap tripping the 
switches on the primary and secondary of the transformer. 
 
Large transformers are often fitted with an oil temperature trip and a “hot spot” temperature trip. This is a 
temperature trip in the oil with a self contained heater carrying a current proportional to the load current. 
 
Motor Protection 
Overload Protection and Single Phase Protection is normally provided for large motors. The overload 
protection is usually thermal, ie operated by bi-metal strips. The single phase protection operates if the 
thermal response of each phase is not the same on all phases.

Protection
Instantaneous over current and earth fault protection is also usually provided. The instantaneous over 
current protection is set above the starting current value. Current can only exceed this value when there is 
a fault so operation can be instantaneous. The earth fault protection is usually set at about 10% full load. If 
the motor is star connected, a fault near the star point may not be detected until it has developed into a 
more serious fault. 
 
Time delayed Under Voltage protection is usually provided for large motors. If the supply fails all motors 
stop. If the supply is then restored, all motors try to start simultaneously overloading the supply which will 
then trip again. Time lagged under voltage protection trips the motor when the supply fails and the motors 
can be started in sequence manually when power is restored. 
 
Small motors are usually provided with thermal overload and single phasing protection. High Rupturing 
Capacity Fuses, HRC Fuses, give protection for short circuits. Small motors are usually supplied through 
contactors which trip in the event of a temporary power failure allowing them to be started in sequence.

2) Busbars 
Circulating Current protection is sometimes fitted to each  
side of the power station busbars. The total net current flowing into each phase of the 
busbars is measured and if not nearly zero all circuit breakers on the bus section and the 
bus section circuit breaker are tripped after a short time lag. 
 
Provision is provided to switch off the protection to allow injection tests on any circuit 
breaker. 
 
3) Bus Section Circuit Breaker 
Over current and Earth Fault Protection set at 100% and 10% 0.9 sec. This is not required 
if there is busbar circulating current protection. Even without Circulating Current 
protection, it is often not fitted. Busbar faults are very rare and when they do occur, 
usually result in total shutdown of the generating station.  
 
4) Feeder 
Over current and Earth Fault Protection set at 100% 0.5 sec

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can

Over current and Earth Fault Protection set at 100%, 0.5 sec 
 
2) Incomers 
Directional Overcurrent protection set at 50% 0.1 sec and  
Directional Earth Fault protection set at 10% 0.1 sec. This provides fault protection  
for the incoming cable and also prevents feedback via the ring main if the bus section  
switch in the main substation is opened. 
 
3) Inter Connectors 
 
 
Circulating Current protection on the inter connector cable set at 10% 0.1 sec.  
This requires a pilot wire cable to be laid with the main power cable.

A fault on any cable is cleared without interrupting the supply to any consumer. Any number of 
substations can be added to the ring main without increasing the fault clearance times. But the system 
requires pilot wire cables to be laid with the interconnector cables and this adds to the cost.

This system uses Ring Main Units each containing one circuit breaker and two isolators. The system is 
operated with one of the isolators open. 
 
If a fault occurs on any cable, then all consumers on the same part of the ring main loose their supply. 
However the faulty cable can be quickly isolated and power restored to all consumers by opening or 
closing the appropriate isolators. 
 
The transformer in each substation is protected by the circuit breaker. Some ring main units use the system 
current to trip the circuit breaker. The circuit breaker has three or four trip coils each connected directly to 
a current transformer. A fuse is fitted across each trip coil. When the current exceeds the rated value, the 
fuse blows and the circuit breaker is tripped. Earth fault protection is obtained from a “core balance” 
current transformer, ie the CT primary contains all three phases. Thus no tripping battery or charger is 
required.

Generator Response to System Faults
GENERATOR RESPONSE TO SYSTEM FAULTS
Armature reaction.
A three phase current in the generator armature causes a rotating magnetic flux of constant value equal
to 1.5 times the peak flux due to one phase.
The magnitude of the rotating mmf due to the armature current is therefore Ia N ampere turns.
where Ia is the rms value of the armature current and N = 1.5 √2 times the “equivalent number of turns 
per phase of the armature winding”. As the winding is actually conductors in slots, the “equivalent
number of turns per phase” has the value of number of turns in a coil to give the same ampere turns as
the armature with the same current.
On a full size generator, the leakage reactance per phase is two orders of magnitude larger than the
winding resistance per phase. Therefore, if there is a short circuit on the generator output, the current is
at near zero power factor. Therefore the short circuit current directly demagnetises the magnetic flux.
However, the main field coil and the damper winding are both linked with the magnetic circuit. By
Lenz’s law, the magnetic flux cannot not suddenly change. Currents are induced in these windings to
initially prevent the change in flux. As the flux does not initially change, the emf does not initially
change.
The currents in the main field coil and damping winding decay exponentially. As these currents decay,
the flux and ac emf decay with the same time constants.
A heavy fault current is low power factor so the final steady state current (if it were allowed to persist)
can fall below the full load value. Even with maximum excitation, the current can fall below full load
current due to the large demagnetization of the low power factor fault current.
Works short circuit test
The manufacturers carry out tests on their generators.
The generator is run at full speed and full
voltage open circuit. The generator is then switched onto a zero impedance short circuit. The current
is recorded and analyzed.
The initial value of the fault current is determined by “the emf due to the flux crossing the air gap”
acting on the leakage reactance of the generator. The magnetization, the emf and the armature current
all decay with the same two time constants.
The current recording of one phase of a short circuit test would be typically of this form;

The current is zero when the switch is closed. Therefore the ac current is displaced above or below the
zero to bring the initial value to zero. This causes a dc component which decays in a few cycles. The
magnitude of the dc component on each phase depends on when, in the ac cycle of that phase, the
switch is closed. The diagram shows it with the maximum value. The ac current combined with the dc
component is called the asymmetric value.
If there is risk of damage due to the mechanical forces of the fault current, then the dc component must
be considered. The maximum asymmetric peak value of the fault current is often taken as 1.8 times the
calculated peak ac value. The figure of 1.8 is the theoretical two times reduced by the approximate
decay over a quarter cycle.
Ignoring the dc component, the rms value of the fault current can be measured from the recording and
will be found to be of this form;

The initial value of the ac current, Isubtr, is called the subtransient value.
Extrapolating back along the transient curve gives the transient current Itr
The final steady state current, Isync, is called the synchronous value.
The recorded current can be analysed to evaluate the subtransient current Isubtr, transient current Itr
and synchronous current Isync. The subtransient and transient direct axis short circuit time constants
Tds” and Tds’ respectively can also be evaluated from the recording.
On a full size machine, the resistance is negligible compared to the reactance. The subtransient
reactance Xd”, the transient reactance Xd’ and the synchronous reactance Xd are defined as;
Xd” = E0 / Isubtr
Xd’ = E0 / Itr
Xd = E0 / Isync
where E0 is the open circuit phase voltage.
The initial subtransient voltage E0 is the emf before the short circuit. Thus Xd” is approximately the
leakage reactance.
The armature leakage reactance can be measured
with the rotor locked in one position.
On a
salient pole machine, the reactance depends on
the rotor position. When the field poles are under
the winding, the armature leakage reactance is
the
subtransient
quadrature
reactance
Xq”.
Between poles, the reactance is the subtransient
direct axis reactance Xd”.
The effect of iron saturation on the leakage
reactances.
The values of Xd” and Xq” are higher at low
magnetic flux than at high magnetic flux. The
values at the magnetic flux for full volts open
circuit are quoted as “saturated reactances”.
The values at zero magnetic flux are quoted as
“unsaturated reactances”.
The initial value of the short circuit current is at full field. Therefore Xd” is the saturated value and the
initial current is E0 / Xd”sat where Xd”sat is the saturated value of the leakage reactance.
The final value of the fault current is at near zero field as the fault current has demagnetised the field.
The leakage reactances in the final synchronous state approach the unsaturated values.

The short circuit characteristic
Evaluation of the short circuit armature currents and the armature reaction constant N
Consider a generator with negligible resistance on full volts open circuit switched onto a zero
impedance short circuit.
A full size machine has negligible resistance.
Let I” be the part of the current that decays with the time constant Td” and I’ be the part that decays
with the time constant Td’. The armature current it at time t seconds after closing the switch is given
by;
it = I” exp (–t / Td”) + I’ exp (–t / Td’) + I sync
Where
I” = Isubtr – Itr = E0 / Xd” – E0 / Xd’
And
I’ = Itr – Isync = E0 / Xd’ – E0 / Xd)
And
I” + I’ = E0 / Xd” – E0 / Xd
Thus
I” = ( I’ + I”) (1/Xd” – 1/Xd’) / (1/Xd” – 1/Xd).
And
I’ = ( I’ + I”) (1/Xd’ – 1/Xd) / (1/Xd” – 1/Xd).
Where Xd” is the saturated value.
Consider the initial subtransient current.
With negligible resistance, the initial value of the current is;
Isubtr = E0 / Xd”sat where Xd”sat is the saturated value of Xd”.
Consider the final current after the decay. This is the short circuit characteristic test.
The field before the short circuit is 1 per unit of the field for open circuit full voltage.
The final current is S amps, where S is the slope of the short circuit test.
The reduction in field due to armature reaction is proportional to id the direct axis component of
armature current. With negligible resistance, the final current S is all direct axis current.
The reduction in field due to armature reaction = N S
where N is 1.5 √3 times the equivalent number of turns per phase of the armature winding 
The final net field is therefore (1 – N S)
Let Esync be the value of E in the final synchronous state when demagnetisation is complete.
Esync is small and is near the origin on the open circuit characteristic where the slope is M0.
Esync = M0 (net field current) = M0 (1 – N S)
But armature current S = Esync / Xd”unsat
where Xd”unsat is the value of the direct axis leakage reactance with the flux to give emf Esync.
M0 (1 – N S) = S Xd”unsat
N = (1/S) − Xd”unsat / M0
One definition of Xd is the ratio of the slope of the oc curve near the origin to the slope of the sc curve
Xd = M0 / S
With this definition of Xd,
N = (Xd – Xd”unsat) / M0
This equation is only valid if there is negligible resistance in the armature winding.
Similarly, on the quadrature axis, the quadrature emf in steady state conditions can be considered as;
Eq = Iq (Xq – Xq”)

Consider now the short circuit current for a generator with armature resistance R ohms/phase.
The generator is run at full volts open circuit and switched onto a zero impedance short circuit.
If the generator is laboratory size, the resistance is not negligible. The short circuit is not zero power
factor. The volt drop due to id, the direct axis component of the armature current is id Xd”. The volt
drop due to iq, the quadrature component of current, is iq Xq”.
When the switch is closed, the flux does not immediately change. Currents induced in the damper
winding and main field winding prevent the change. The emf is proportional to the flux. Therefore the
emfs do not immediately change when the switch is closed. Thereafter, the flux and emfs fall as the
induced currents decay.
Evaluate the initial (subtransient) short circuit current Isubt.
The subtransient current Isubt can be found in terms of the open circuit voltage, the reactances Xd”
and Xq” and the resistance R.
The vector diagram of voltages is shown in the diagram.
On open circuit, E0 leads the pole axis by 90 degrees.
In the subtransient state, the reactances are the saturated values.
iq Xq”sat = id R
E0 = iq R + id Xd”sat = id ( R2 / Xq”sat + Xd”sat)
where E0 is the phase emf at full volt open circuit voltage leading
the pole axis by 90 electrical degrees.
id = E0 / ( R2 / Xq”sat + Xd”sat)
iq = id R / Xq”sat
Isubtr = √(id2 + iq2)

Consider the final (synchronous) short circuit current.
The final current is S amps where S is the current at per unit field on the short circuit characteristic.
Let Idsync and Iqsync be the components of S on the direct and quadrature axes.
Let Xd”unsat and Xq”unsat be the unsaturated values of Xd” and Xq”.
Eq = Iqsync (Xq – Xq”unsat) is the emf due to armature reaction on the quadrature axis.
where Xq is a measure of the armature reaction on the quadrature axis.
Iqsync Xq = Idsync R
S = √(Idsync2 + Iqsync2) = Idsync √(1  +  R2 / Xq2)
Therefore;
Idsync = S / √(1  +  R2 / Xq2)
Iqsync = Idsync R / Xq
Ed = Iqsync R + Idsync Xd”unsat
Eq = Iqsync (Xq – Xq”unsat)
E = √(Ed2 + Eq2)
N Idsync is the reduction in field due to armature reaction.
N = (Field amps – field amps to give Ed) / Idsync
Now consider the armature current when the generator on full volts open circuit is switched onto
an external impedance resistance Re and reactance Xe.
Evaluate the subtransient short circuit current.
By Lenz’s law, the initial value of the emf is unchanged.
Currents are induced in the coils linking with the flux
opposing the change. E0 is the full volt open circuit voltage
leading the pole axis by 90 electrical degrees.
Let id and iq be the direct and quadrature axis components of the subtransient current Isubt.
The vector diagram of the voltages is shown in the diagram.
iq (Xq”sat + Xe) = id (R + Re)
E0 = iq (R + Re) + id (Xd”sat + Xe)
= id [ (R+ Re)2 /( Xq”sat + Xe) + Xd”sat + Xe]
Therefore id = E0 / [ (R+ Re)2 /( Xq”sat + Xe) + Xd”sat + Xe]
And
iq = id (R + Re) / (Xq”sat + Xe)
Use the suffix subtr;
Idsubtr = id, Iqsubtr = iq and Isubtr = √(Idsubtr2 + Iqsubtr2)
Evaluate the synchronous short circuit current.
Let id and iq be the direct and quadrature axis components of the synchronous current.
Xd”unsat and Xq”unsat are the unsaturated values.
iq (Xq + Xe) = id (R + Re)
Ed = id (Xd”unsat + Xe) + iq (R + Re)
= id (Xd”unsat + Xe) + id (R + Re) 2 / (Xq + Xe)
Ed is the o.c. voltage at field of (field current – N id)
where N has the value obtained in the short circuit

id = Ed / [(Xd”unsat + Xe) + (R + Re) 2 / (Xq + Xe)]

Consider now a generator on full load experiencing a short circuit with a fault resistance RF and

Let the load be represented by a resistance RL and reactance XL per phase.
Let full load current be IL, full load be W watts
busbar voltage be V and full load power factor be Cos 
3 IL2 RL = W
RL = W / (3 IL2 )
XL = RL Tan 

The vector diagram shows the voltages on full load.
Tan = RL / (Xq + XL)
IdL = IL Cos 
IqL = IL Sin 
The condition is steady state EqL = IqL (Xq – Xq”)
EdL = IdL (RL + Xd”) + IqL RL
Xd” and Xq” are the saturated values.
Evaluate the subtransient current and busbar voltage with combined resistance R and reactance X.
When the fault occurs, EdL and EqL are initially unchanged.
Give the parameters the suffix 0 immediately after the fault occurs (ie at time t = 0).
The quadrature axis emf is no longer Iq (Xq – Xq”). Iq changes immediately but, due to induced
currents on the quadrature axis, the quadrature axis emf is initially unchanged at EqL.
The fault impedance RF and XF is in parallel with the load RL and XL.
The fault impedance ZF = √(RF2 + XF 2)
The load impedance ZL = √(RL2 + XL 2)
Let R and X be the equivalent resistance and reactance of the load impedance in parallel with the fault
impedance.
Put A = RL/ZL2 + RF/ZF2
and B =XL/ZL2 + XF/ZF2
Then R = A / (A2 + B 2)
and X = B / (A2 + B 2)
The vector diagram shows the subtransient voltages.
Iq0 (Xq” + X) = Id0 R ─ EqL 
Iq0 = (Id0 R – EqL) / (Xq” + X)
EdL = Iq0 R + Id0 (Xd” + X)
EdL = (Id0 R2 – EqL R) / (Xq” + X) + Id0 (Xd” + X)
Thereforethe subtransient parameters can be evaluated
Id0 = [EdL + EqL R / (Xq” + X)] / [R2 / (Xq” + X) + Xd” + X]
Iq0 = (Id0 R – EqL) / (Xq” + X)

The final synchronous state is the same as has been

the equivalent impedance of the fault impedance

The condition is steady state,
Eq = Iq (Xq – Xq”unsat)
Give the parameters the suffix “sync” for the final (synchronous) state.
Iqsync (Xq + X) = Idsync R / (Xq + X)
Idsync = Edsync / [X + Xd” + R2 / (Xq + X)]

Edsync = U + m (FeL – Idsync N)
Where U and m have values

Therefore;
Idsync = [U + m (FeL – Idsync N)] / [X + Xd” + R2 / (Xq + X)]
Idsync = [U + m FeL] / [X + Xd” + R2 / (Xq + X) + m N]
This evaluates Idsync
Iqsync = Idsync R / (Xq + X)
Isync = √(idsync2 + Iqsync2 )
Current at time t seconds after the switch is closed with constant excitation
The direct axis current id changes from the subtransient to the synchronous value with two time
constants Td” and Td’. The quadrature current iq changes from the subtransient to the synchronous
value with the time constant Tq”.
Let the transient value of the current be Itr with component Idtr on the direct axis.
Let the current at time t be (it) with components idt and iqt on the direct and quadrature axes.
idt = Idsync + (Idtr – Idsync) exp (–t/Td’) + (Idsubtr – Idtr) exp (–t/Td”)
iqt = (Iqsubtr – Iqsync) exp (–t/Tq”)
it = √(idt2 + iqt2)
These equations give the short circuit current at any time t with the excitation kept constant provided
we can evaluate the transient current Itr.
Theoretical evaluation of transient current Itr.
Theory (1).
Assume the subtransient component is due to the current induced in the damper winding and the
transient component is due to the current induced in the field winding. The current in the damping
winding decays quickly. As it decays, some of its ampere turns are transferred to the field coil due to
their flux linkage. Both coils are linked with the same rate of change in flux. Therefore the initial
value of the currents induced in the damper winding and field coil are always in the same ratio. Their
relative values depend on their number of turns and their impedances which are constant.

decayed to zero, the fault current is
on the transient path
The
figure
shows
how the
fault
current decays during the subtransient
period. The current initially induced in the field is proportional to (It0 – Isync) and the current initially
induced in the damper coil is proportional to (Isubtr – It0).
Let (It0 – Isync) = C1 (Isubtr – It0).
The current in the damper coil decays quickly to zero. Some of the ampere turns of the damper coil are
transferred to the field coil, the amount is proportional to (Isubtr – It0).
Let (Itr – It0) = C2 (Isubtr – It0)
Therefore Itr – Isync = [(C1 + C2) / (1 – C2)] (Isubtr – Itr)
C1 and C2 have the same values for all magnitude of fault.
Put Factorsubtr = (Isubtr – Itr) / (Isubtr – Isync)
And Factortr = (Itr – Isync) / (Isubtr – Isync)
Factorsubtr and Factortr have the same values for all magnitudes of fault.
When Xe = 0 and Re = 0, Factortr = Xd”sat (Xd −Xd’) / [Xd’  (Xd −Xd”sat)]

Therefore for all values of Xe and Re;
Itr = Isync + Factortr (Isubtr – Isync)
By this theory;
Itr = Isync + (Isubtr – Isync) Xd”sat  (Xd −Xd’ / [Xd’  (Xd −Xd”sat)] 
Theory (2)
If however C2 = 1, then all the ampere turns of the damper winding are transferred to the field coil.
The machine behaves as though there is no damper winding. (Isubtr – Itr) = 0. The current decays
with the single time constant of the field coil. However as the emf falls, the circuit reactance changes
from (Xd”sat + Xe) to (Xd”unsat + Xe) where Xd”sat is the saturated value and Xd”unsat is the
unsaturated value. The current begins on the decay curve value applicable to the saturated values and
changes to the decay curve applicable to the unsaturated values.
The subtransient current can be
calculated using the saturated values. The current ends up on the decay curve from an initial value
calculated on the unsaturated values.
With zero impedance short circuit, Itr = E / Xd’
where Xd’ = unsaturated value of Xd”
Itr and component Idtr can be calculated exactly as for Isubt and Idsubt but with Xd” replaced by Xd’.
Theory (2) is used by definitive texts on the subject including IEEE STD-551.
This theory means that Xd’ = Xd”unsat.
With external impedance, the circuit impedance = Xd’ + external impedance.
Both methods give a result of sufficient accuracy for practical purposes.
The Time Constants
When the fault occurs, there is a sudden change in the armature current. The change in mmf due to the
armature current is exactly balanced by the mmf due to currents induced in the damping winding and
main field winding. Thereafter, the dc currents in the damping winding and main field winding decay
with two time constants. Their mmfs decay with the same two time constants and hence the direct axis
flux and ac emf also decay with the same two time constants.
If the armature current remained constant during the fault, the currents in the damping winding and
main field winding would decay with time constants that are the same whatever the initial value of the
fault current. If the fault impedance is very high, the fault current is low and the change in armature
current is negligible. These time constants are quoted as Tdo” and Tdo’, the open circuit time constants.
Therefore these would be the time constants for all faults if the armature current remained constant
during the fault.
But the armature current does not remain constant during the fault. It decays as the flux and ac emf
decay. This acts like a positive feedback hastening the decay of the dc currents in the damping and
main field windings. The time constants are reduced by an amount that depends on the initial value of
the fault current.
Equations for the time constants were derived many decades ago.
Td” =
Tdo” (Xd” + X) / (Xd’ + X)
Td’ =
Tdo’ (Xd’ + X) / (Xd + X)]
Tq” =
Tqo” (Xq” + X) / (Xq + X)
Where;
Td” is the subtransient time constant with fault impedance X external to the generator.
Tdo” is the subtransient time constant on open circuit.
Xd” is the subtransient reactance of the generator.
Td’, Tdo’ and Xd’ are the transient values of these parameters.
Xd is the synchronous reactance of the generator.
Tq”, Tqo”, Xq” and Xq are the corresponding parameters on the quadrature axis.
Putting X = 0 in these equations gives the short circuit time constants,
Tds” =
Tdo” Xd” / Xd’
Tds’ =
Tdo’ Xd’ / Xd
Tqs” =
Tqo” Xq” / Xq

Generator Response to System Faults
However all these parameters can be measured and the measured values do not satisfy these
relationships, perhaps due to saturation. Moreover any resistance in the fault path must have some
effect on the time constants.
According to these equations, resistance in the fault path has no effect on
the time constants.
Time constants calculated by these equations can lead to significant errors if X is small.
Consider the case of a generator on no load with a single coil (the damping winding) linking the flux as
shown in the Figure.
At time t seconds after the fault occurs, let the current in the damping winding be ik and the direct axis
component of the ac fault current be id. Let the flux before the fault be o. Let be the additional
flux due to armature winding and damper winding. Thus the flux at time t is + o. The ampere
turns of (Na id) due to armature reaction act to reduce the flux and induce a current ik in the linked coil.
The ampere turns (Nk ik) increase the flux.
Φ = M2 (Nk  ik ─ Na id ) 
where M2 is the slope of the magnetisation curve at open circuit full volts (flux against ampere turns)
Let the armature ac emf at time t be E = E2 times the flux = E2 (Φo + Φ) 
The direct axis component of the armature current at time t is
id = E2 (Φo + Φ) Cos / (Z + Xd” )
where Cos is the angle between the armature current and pole axis.
Substitute for id and differentiate, assume Cos remains unchanged
dΦ/dt = P d(ik) /dt 
where P = M2 Nk / [1 + M2 Na E2 Cos / (Z + Xd” )]
Let the emf induced in the damping winding be M3 times dΦ/dt.  A falling flux creates a positive ik 
– M3 dΦ/dt = Rk ik + Lk d( ik) /dt 
where Rk and Lk are the resistance and leakage reactance of the damping winding.
ik = Ik0 exp(- t / T)
where Ik0 = initial induced current in the damper winding and T = (M3 P + Lk) / Rk
Put T = T1 + T2
where T1 = Lk / Rk and T2 = M3 P / Rk
T2 = (M3 / Rk) M Nk /[1 + M2 Na E2 Cos / (Z + Xd” )]
T1 is the time constant of the coil due to resistance and leakage reactance.
T2 is the time constant of the coil due to resistance and flux linkage with the field magnetic circuit.
Thus T2 is very much larger than T1, as a first approximation, T1 can be ignored.
Put
= M3 M2 Nk / Rk
And
= M2 Na E2 / Xd”
And
k1 = Xd” Cos / (Z + Xd”)
T2 = / (1 + k1)
When Z is very large (ie open circuit), k1 = 0, T2 = Tdo, = Tdo
When Z = 0, (ie short circuit), k1 = 1, T2 = Tds
Tds = Tdo / (1 + ), = (Tdo – Tds) / Tds
For other values of Z, T2 = Td
Td = Tdo Tds / [Tds + (Tdo – Tds) k1]
where k1 = Xd” Cos / (Z + Xd”)

The subtransient time constant is therefore
Td” = Tdo” Tds” / [Tds” + (Tdo” – Tds”) k1]
where k1 = Xd” Cos / (Z + Xd”) and = angle between armature current and pole axis.
If equation Tds” = Tdo” Xd” / Xd’ is satisfied, then both methods give the same result.
Applying the same principle to the other time constants.
Td’ = Tdo’ Tds’ / [Tds’ + (Tdo’ – Tds’) k2]
where k2 = Xd’ Cos / (Z + Xd’) and = angle between armature current and pole axis.
Tq” = Tqo” x Tqs” / [Tqs” + (Tqo” – Tqs”) x k3]
where k3 = Xq” Sin / (Z + Xq”) and = angle between armature current and pole axis.
The response of the automatic voltage regulator and governor.
These equations have been derived to give the short circuit current through an impedance with the
excitation kept constant. However the excitation is not kept constant when a fault occurs on a power
system. The excitation rises exponentially under the control of the automatic voltage regulator.
When the terminal voltage is below the system voltage, the automatic voltage regulator boosts the field
due to the exciter. The voltage rises towards the maximum with a time constant dictated by the exciter
field circuit and the main field coil. The time constant for the exciter is quoted as Te.
The exciter
voltage rises with this time constant but acts on a circuit with a time constant Td’. The target voltage
for the automatic voltage regulator is influenced by the compounding circuit. At a lagging armature
current, the target voltage is reduced to reduce the response. This is required for parallel operation of
the generator. Without the compounding, the generators running in parallel can become unstable with
the wattles current swinging wildly from one machine to the other. Fault currents can be large at very
low power factor lagging. This can significantly reduce the target voltage of the automatic voltage
regulator.

The reduction in target voltage is proportional to armature current and the sine of the phase angle with
a zero value at the system design power factor.
The target voltage vavr with fault current (it) is therefore;
vavr = 1 – it / (full load current) [(X/ √(R2 + X2) – sin ] Compounding% / 100
where (cos is the design system power factor.
And (Compounding%) is the compounding voltage as per cent full volts with full load current.
The voltage rises exponentially to vavr.
Fault calculations on a power system.
The impedance of the fault path is calculated. The subtransient, transient and synchronous values of
the armature current are calculated.
The time constants are calculated and hence the value of the
armature current at any time t after fault incidence can be calculated.
The manufacturer can usually provide figures for the machine reactances Xd”sat, Xd”unsat, Xq”sat,
Xq”unsat, Xd’, Xd, Xq, the negative sequence reactance X1 and the zero sequence reactance X0.
Similarly, the manufacturer can usually provide figures for the time constants Tdo”, Tdo’, Tds”, Tds’
and Te.
If these figures are not available, practical tests on the machine may enable approximate
values to be obtained.
The response of the exciter and pilot exciter must also be considered together with the compounding
and response of the automatic voltage regulator. The change in speed of the generator can also be
considered. Fault currents are usually low power factor. The reduction in voltage reduces the resistive
load. Therefore the generators usually speed up during a heavy fault. If however most of the power
station load is induction motors, these motors can contribute to the fault. It is widely assumed that
induction motors will contribute a current equal to their starting current during a heavy fault. It is true
that induction motors can generate if the frequency falls below the motor slip frequency. However this
is most unlikely to occur with a low power factor system fault as the generators may speed up during
the fault. If the fault is near the power station busbars, then the voltage at the power station busbars
can fall to zero. In this case any induction motors on the system may generate but at slip frequency. In
this case, the total fault current can rise and fall as the generated voltage goes into and out of
synchronism with the motor generated current.
Example
Tests were carried out on a laboratory sized generator with significant armature resistance. The
machine was given artificially increased armature reaction.
A voltage proportional to the armature
current was input to a three channel amplifier, one phase to each channel.
The output from each
channel was rectified. The sum of the three outputs was connected into the field circuit to reduce the
net field by an amount proportional to the armature current. The machine then behaved like a full size
generator.

Short circuit test
The field current was set at
2.80 amps and the armature
current on a short circuit was
recorded.
The subtransient current was calculated.
Isubt, the initial value of fault current, is with saturated reactances.
id = E0 / ( R2 / Xqs” + Xds”) = 12.3 / ( 0.10162 / 0.229 + 0.162) = 59.4 amps
iq = id R / Xqs” = 59.4 ( 0.1016 /0.229) = 26.3 amps
Isubtr = √(id2 + iq2) = 65.0 amps
The synchronous current was calculated
Isync, the value of fault current, is with unsaturated reactances.
id = S / √(1  +  R2 / Xq2) = 13.3 / √(1  +  0.10162 / 0.762) =13.2 amps
iq = id R / Xq = 13.2 (0.1016 / 0.76) = 1.8amps
Isync = √(13.22 + 1.82 ) = 13.3 amps
Ed = iq R + id Xd” = 1.8 x 0.1016 + 13.2 x 0.230 = 3.2 volts
Xd”unsat = 0.230 ohms/phase at 3.2 volts.
Xq”unsat = 0.313 ohms/phase at 3.2 volts
Eq = iq (Xq – Xq”) = 1.8 (0.76 – 0.313) = 0.8 volts
E = √(Ed2 + Eq2) = 3.3 volts
Field for 3.3 volts is 0.40 amps
Armature reaction is equivalent to 2.80 – 0.40 = 2.40 field amps
Let armature reaction be equivalent to k id field amps
The direct axis armature reaction is proportional to the direct axis current id.
However the artificial armature reaction is proportional to ia not id
N = 2.40 / 13.3 = 0.180
The recorded current was analysed from 3rd half cycle
Isubtr = 65.0 and Isync = 13.3 amps;
Armature current = 13.3 + 18.2 exp(–n / 17) + 33.4 exp(–n / 1.0) amps
Tds’ = 17 and Tds” = 1.0 where n is the number of half cycles
Transient current = 13.3 + 18.2 = 31.5 amps
Transient impedance = Eo / transient current = 12.3 / 31.5 = 0.390 ohms/phase
Resistance = 0.1016 ohms/phase

Calculate the fault current when switched onto an impedance with field current 2.80 amps.
The external impedance consisted of reactance Xe = 0.5620 and resistance Re = 0.1596 ohms/phase
The subtransient current was calculated.
Eo = 12.3 volts
id = Eo / [(R + Re)2/(Xqs” + Xe)2 + Xds” + Xe ]
= 12.3 / [ (0.1016 + 0.1596)2 / (0.229 + 0.5620) + 0.162 + 0.5620] = 15.2 amps

The synchronous current was calculated
Try Isync = 9.8 amps
From the short circuit test, N = 0.180.
Armature reaction = N id = 0.180 x 9.8 = 1.76 amps reduction in field
Net field = 2.80 ─ 1.76 = 1.04 field amps 
Ed = 7.6 + (0.04/0.5)(10.1 – 7.6) = 7.80 volts
At 1.04 amps field current, Xd” = 0.192 – (.04/.5)(0.192 – 0.185) = 0.191
and Xq” = 0.312 – (.05/.5)(0.312 – 0.283) = 0.310 ohms/phase
iq = (R + Re) / Xq + Xe) id = (0.1016 + 0.1596) / (0.76 + 0.5620) = 0.198 id
Ed = iq (R + Re) + id (Xd” + Xe) = id [ 0.198 (0.1016 + 0.1596) + 0.191 + 0.5620] = 0.805 id
id = 7.80 / 0.805 = 9.69 amps
iq = 0.198 id = 1.92 amps
Isync = √(id2 + iq2) = 9.88 amps
Therefore Isync is between 9.8 and 9.88 amps
Put Isync = 9.8 amps
Isubt = 16.0 and Isync = 9.8
Theory (1) The decay in the armature current is due to the decay in currents in the damper and field
windings;
Transient element = 18.2 / (18.2 + 33.4) (Isubtr – Isync) = 2.2 amps
Subtransient element = 33.4 / (18.2 + 33.4) (Isubtr – Isync) = 4.0 amps
Fault current = 9.8 + 2.2 exp(–t / T’) + 4.0 exp (–t / T”) amps
Theory (2) The two time constants are due to the change from saturated to unsaturated leakage
reactance;
Armature resistance = 0.1016 ohms/phase
Transient reactance = 0.377 ohms/phase
Circuit resistance = 0.1016 + 0.1596 = 0.261 ohms/phase
Circuit transient reactance = 0.377 + 0.5620 = 0.939 ohms/phase
Circuit transient impedance = 0.975 ohms/phase
Transient current = 12.3 / 0.975 = 12.6 amps
Armature current = 9.8 + (12.6 – 9.8) exp(–t / T’) + (16.0 – 12.6) exp(–t / T”) amps
Armature current = 9.8 + 2.8 exp(–t / T’) + 3.4 exp(–t / T”) amps
Note however that the transient reactance Xd’ = 0.377 ohms/phase is significantly different from the
unsaturated direct axis reactance Xd” = 0.191 ohms/phase.
Calculate the time constants by the traditional equations;
Td” =
Tdo” (Xd” + X) / (Xd’ + X)
Td’ =
Tdo’ (Xd’ + X) / (Xd + X)]
When X = 0, The time constants were measured at Tds’ = 17 and Tds” = 1.0
Td” is while saturated, Xd” = 0.162 ohms/phase
Td’ is while Xd” is unsaturated, Xd” = 0.191 ohms/phase
Xd’ = 0.377 and Xd = 1.60 ohms/phase
Tdo” = Tds” Xd’ / Xd” = 1.0 x 0.377 / 0.191 = 2.0
Tdo’ = Tds’ Xd / Xd’ = 17 x 1.6 / 0.377 = 72
With X = 0.5620;
Td” = Tdo” (Xd” + X) / (Xd’ + X) = 2.0 (0.162 + 0.5620) / (0.377 + 0.5620) = 1.6
Td’ = Tdo’ (Xd’ + X) / (Xd + X) = 72 (0.377 + 0.5620) / (1.60 + 0.5620) = 31
Calculate the time constants by the equations developed in this text;
Td” = Tdo” Tds” / [Tds” + (Tdo” – Tds”) k1]
where k1 = (id with X = Xe) / (id with X = 0) initial values
Tdo” = 2.0 and Tds” = 1.0
Td” = 2.0 x 1.0 / [1.0 +(2.0 – 1.0) (16.0 amps)/(65.0 amps)] = 1.6

Td’ = Tdo’ Tds’ / [Tds’ + (Tdo’ – Tds’) k1]
where k1 = (id with X = Xe) / (id with X = 0) final values
Td’ = 72 x 17 / [17 + (72 – 17) x (9.8 / 13.3)] = 21
The traditional equations give Td” = 1.6 and Td’ = 31 half cycles
The equations developed in this text give Td” = 1.6 and Td’ = 21 half cycles.
Measured result
Isync was measured at 9.7 amps with 2.80 field current
The current through the impedance was recorded and is shown below.
The recording was printed out and the peak to peak value of each half cycle was measured.
1293
Isync = 9.7 amps. This gives the scale of the recording.
Analysis of the trace from 3rd peak to peak gives;
Short circuit current = 45.8+ 23.0 exp(–n / 22) + 6.0 exp(–n / 2.9) mm
where n is the number of half cycles.
Isync =45.8 mm = 9.8 amps
Isubtr = 9.8 (45.8 + 23.0 + 6.0) / 45.8 = 16.0 amps
Itr = 45.8 + 23.0 mm = 68.8 mm = 9.8 (68.8 / 45.8) = 14.7 amps
Armature current = 9.8 + 4.9 exp(–n / 22) + 1.3 exp(–tn/ 2.9) amps
Summary
Method (1) Fault current = 9.8 + 2.2 exp(–n / 21) + 4.0 exp (–n / 1.6) amps
Method (2) Fault current = 9.8 + 2.8 exp(–n / 31) + 3.4 exp(–n / 1.6) amps
Measured Fault current = 9.8 + 4.9 exp(–n / 22) + 1.3 exp(–n / 2.9) amps
where n is the number of half cycles.
Both methods give similar results within the limits of experimental error but differ from the measured
result.
For practical purposes, the margin of error is acceptable. There is little if any error in the
subtransient and synchronous values. The time constant Td’ calculated by the method suggested by
this text gives a better result.

The subtransient currents were calculated.
At 1.56 field, the emf E0= 10.3 volts from the open circuit characteristic.
Initially the reactances are partly saturated.
Xd” = 0.182 ohms/phase at 1.56 amps field current.
Xq” = 0.280 ohms/phase at 1.56 amps field current.
R = 0.1016 ohms / phase.
The emf does not change immediately when the short circuit is
applied.
iq Xq” = id R
iq = 0.1016 / 0.280 id = 0.363 id
E0 = iq R + id Xd”
10.3 = (0.363 x 0.1016 + 0.182) id = 0.219 id
id = 10.3 / 0.219 = 47.0 amps
iq = 0.363 x 47.0 = 17.1 amps
Subtransient current  = √(id2 + iq2) = 50.0 amps
Z = 10.3 / 50.0 = 0.206 ohms per phas
The synchronous current
The reactances are unsaturated at approx 1.8 volts
Xd” = 0.222 ohms/phase
Xq” = 0.313 ohms/phase
R = 0.1016 ohms / phase.
Field current = 1.56 amps.
id = S(1.56/2.8)/√(1 + R2 / Xq2 ) = 13.3 x 1.56/2.8 /√(1 + 0.10162 / 0.762 ) = 7.34
iq = id R/Xq =(0.1016 / 0.76) id = 0.134 id = 0.98 amps
ia = √(id2 + iq2) = 7.41 amps
Ed = iq R + id Xd” = 0.98 x 0.1016 + 7.34 x 0.222 = 1.73 volts
Eq = iq (Xq – Xq”) = 0.43 volts
E = √(Ed2 + Eq2) = 1.8 volts
Field for 1.8 volts = 0.19 field amps
Armature reaction is equivalent to 1.56 – 0.19 = 1.37 field amps
Let armature reaction = N ia
N = 1.37 / 7.41 = 0.185
This agrees with the previous figure 0.180 within the limits of experimental error
The recorded trace 5097was analysed.
Synchronous current = 7.41 amps
Subtransient current = 50.0 amps
The recording of the current was not established till the second half cycle. The trace was analysed
from the 2nd to 60th half cycles and can be represented by;
I = 7.4 + 27.6 exp(−n / 10) + 15.0 exp(−n / 0.7)  amps 
Where n is the number of half cycles
Tds” = 0.7 and Tds’ = 10
Subtransient current = 7.4 + 27.6 +15.0 = 50.0 amps
Transient current = 7.4 + 27.6 = 35.0 amps
Synchronous current = 7.4 amps.
Transient impedance = 10.3/35.0 = 0.294 ohms / phase
Transient reactance = √(0.2942 – 0.10162 ) = 0.276 ohms / phase
Calculate the fault current with field 1.56 amps when switched onto the impedance.
The impedance consisted of reactance Xe = 0.092 and resistance Re = 0.050 ohms/phase

The emf does not change immediately when the short circuit is applied.
E0 = 10.3 volts
iq (Xq11 + Xe) = id (R + Re)
iq = id (0.1016 + 0.050) / (0.280 + 0.092) = 0.4075 id
E0 = iq R + id Xd11
10.3 =id [0.4075 (0.1016 + 0.050) + 0.182 + 0.092]
= 0.336 id
id = 30.7 amps
iq = 12.45amps
Subtransient current  = √(id2 + iq2) = 33.1amps
Z = 10.3 / 33.1 = 0.311 ohms per phase
The synchronous current was calculated
Try Isync = 7.1 amps
N = 0.182.
Armature reaction = N id = 0.182 x 7.1
= 1.29 amps reduction in field
Net field = 1.56 ─ 1.29 = 0.27 field amps 
Ed = 0.4 + (0.27/0.5)(4.0 – 0.4) = 2.34 volts
At 0.27 amps field current,
Xd” = 0.235 – (0.27/0.5)(0.235 – 0.208) = 0.220 ohms/phase
Xq” = 0.313 ohms/phase
iq = (R + Re) / Xq + Xe) id = (0.1016 + 0.050) / (0.76 + 0.092) id = 0.178 id
Ed = iq (R + Re) + id (Xd” + Xe) = id [ 0.178 (0.1016 + 0.050) + 0.220 + 0.092] = 0.339 id
id = 2.34 / 0.339 = 6.90 amps
iq = 0.178 id = 1.23 amps
Isync = √(id2 + iq2) = 7.01 amps
Therefore Isync is between 7.01 and 7.1 amps
Put Isync = 7.1 amps
Isubtr = 33.1 and Isync = 7.1
By theory (1)
Transient element = 27.6 / (27.6 + 15.0) (Isubtr – Isync) = 16.8 amps
Subtransient element = 15.0 / (27.6 + 15.0) (Isubtr – Isync) = 9.2 amps
Current = 7.1 + 16.8 exp(–t / T’) + 9.2 exp (–t / T”) amps
By theory (2)
Armature resistance = 0.1016 ohms/phase
Transient reactance = 0.276 ohms/phase
Circuit resistance = 0.1016 + 0.050 = 0.1516 ohms/phase
Circuit transient reactance = 0.276 + 0.092 = 0.368 ohms/phase
Circuit transient impedance = 0.398 ohms/phase
Transient current = 10.3 / 0.398 = 25.9 amps
Armature current = 7.1 + (25.9 – 7.1) exp(–t / T’) + (33.1 – 25.9) exp(–t / T”) amps
Armature current = 7.1 + 18.8 exp(–t / T’) + 7.2 exp(–t / T”) amps
Calculate the time constants.
Using the traditional equations;
Td” =
Tdo” (Xd” + X) / (Xd’ + X)
Td’ =
Tdo’ (Xd’ + X) / (Xd + X)]
When X = 0, The time constants were measured at Tds’ = 10 and Tds” = 0.7
Td” is while saturated, Xd” = 0.182 ohms/phase
Td’ is while Xd” is unsaturated, Xd” = 0.220 ohms/phase
Xd’ = 0.276 and Xd = 1.60 ohms/phase
Tdo” = Tds” Xd’/Xd” = 0.7 x 0.276 / 0.182 = 1.1

With X = 0.092;
Td” = Tdo” (Xd” + X) / (Xd’ + X) = 1.1 (0.182 + 0.092) / (0.276 + 0.092) = 0.8
Td’ = Tdo’ (Xd’ + X) / (Xd + X)] = 58 (0.276 + 0.092) / (1.60 + 0.092) = 13
Using the equations suggested by this text;
Td” = Tdo” Tds” / [Tds” + (Tdo” – Tds”) k1]
where k1 = (id with X = Xe) / (id with X = 0) initial values
Tdo” = 1.1 and Tds” = 0.7
Td” = 1.1 x 0.7 / [0.7 +(1.1 – 0.7) (33.1 amps)/(50.0 amps)] = 0.8
Td’ = Tdo’ Tds’ / [Tds’ + (Tdo’ – Tds’) k1]
where k1 = (id with X = Xe) / (id with X = 0) final values
Td’ = 58 x 10 / [10 + (58 – 10) x (33.1 / 50.0)] = 14
Measured result
Isync was measured at 7.1 amps with 1.56 field current
The current through the impedance was recorded and is shown below.
The recording was printed out and the peak to peak value of each half cycle was measured.

Isync = 7.1 amps. This gives the scale of the recording.
Analysis of the trace from 2nd peak to peak gives;
Armature current = 7.1 + 15.6 exp(–n / 12) + 10.4 exp(–n / 0.9) amps
where n is the number of half cycles.
Itr = 7.1 + 15.6 = 22.7 amps
Isubtr = 7.1 + 15.6 + 10.4 = 33.1 amps
Summary
Using values for Td” and Td’ calculated above;
Method (1) Current = 7.1 + 16.8 exp(–n / 14) + 9.2 exp (–n / 0.8) amps
Method (2) Current = 7.1 + 18.8 exp(–n / 13) + 7.2 exp(–n / 0.8) amps
Measured
Current = 7.1 + 15.6 exp(–n / 12) + 10.4 exp(–n / 0.9) amps
where n is the number of half cycles

Generator Reactances and Time Constants 
The works short circuit test can be analysed to obtain Tds", Tds', Xd" and Xd'. 
If the machine is also switched onto a low resistance, then values can be obtained for Xq" and Tqs".  
 
Short circuit and open circuit characteristics 
The generator is usually dried out as part of the commissioning procedure. A short circuit of heavy section 
copper bar is bolted to the generator circuit breaker terminals. The short circuit characteristic is obtained 
during the dry out and it can be followed by the open circuit characteristic. 
 
Off load tests 
With the machine running off load, the effect of a sudden change in excitation can be analysed to obtain 
values for Tdo" and Tdo'. It may be possible to do this on load to obtain a value for Tqo". 
 
On load records 
With the machine on load, the excitation current can be recorded for various loads and power factors to 
confirm Xd and obtain a value for Xq.

Calculation of Fault Currents
Note. Any oscilliographs taken of transient conditions should be recorded on an oscillioscope supplied 
from a different power supply, battery and invertor or a small generator. If the oscillioscope is supplied 
from the same supply, the trace will disappear off screen due to the system voltage fluctuations that occur 
in transient conditions. 
Machine Inertia
The inertia, H, is measured in kW seconds of kinetic energy at full rated speed per kVA. This can be 
estimated by plotting the curve of speed against time during a normal start. As the speed approaches full 
speed, the prime mover power increases till the governor kicks in. Draw the tangent to the curve at the 
speed corresponding to full load governor droop  
Extend this tangent to the full speed line at the top and the axis at the bottom. The value T seconds is the 
approximate time to gain full speed kinetic energy if the prime mover supplied rated full load power 
throughout this period. Thus the kinetic energy is approximately T  MW megawatt seconds where MW is 
the rated full load in megawatts. Hence an approximate value of H can be obtained 
 
H  =  T  MW/MVA 
 
     =  T  pf 
 
Impedance external to the power station
The impedance of the power system between the power station and the fault largely determines the 
magnitude of the fault. Power lines and cables have resistance and inductive reactance. Transformers have 
inductive reactance but negligible resistance.

Calculation of Fault Currents
Positive, Negative and Zero sequence Impedances 
The measured or quoted impedances per phase for non rotating plant can be used for both the positive and 
the negative sequence impedances. The negative phase sequence impedance is usually quoted by the 
manufacturer for generators. In the absence of manufacturer’s figures, the positive sequence impedance 
could be used but this could lead to significant errors in the calculated fault current. 
 
Zero Sequence Impedances 
The zero sequence impedance may be lower or more usually higher by a factor of two or three. It is best to 
measure the value by a practical test. Power lines with no earth line or a steel earth line have a higher zero 
sequence impedance. If the impedance of a power line is significant, always measure the zero sequence 
resistance and reactance on site. 
 
To measure the zero sequence impedance of the generators and other plant, short circuit all three phases 
each side of the plant. The short circuit at the remote end is then connected to earth. The impedance is 
then measured between the near end short circuit and earth. This can be done by using a 20 amp Variac 
transformer, a Voltmeter, an Ammeter and a Wattmeter. The Variac will need to be supplied from a 
mobile generator or alternatively through an isolating transformer. If it is connected directly to the mains, 
the neutral connection to earth will negate the readings.

Calculation of Fault Currents
The Zero sequence impedance/phase Z0 is then 3 x Volts / Current. 
The Zero sequence resistance R0 is 3 x Watts/(Current)2 
The Zero sequence reactance is X0 is √(Z0

It may be necessary to correct for the voltage drop across the ammeter and wattmeter current coil or for 
the current through the voltmeter and wattmeter voltage coil. 
 
 
 
Calculation of Fault Currents 
Where a power system contains transformers, impedances in series at different voltages cannot be simply 
added. They must all be converted to the equivalent at the same voltage. 
 
A convenient way to do this is to evaluate each impedance as the per cent volt drop when carrying a “base 
load”. The base load can be any value but it is common to use 10 MVA. 
 
Impedances to a base 10 MVA 
The impedance Z to base 10 MVA is given by; 
 
 
Z = (% Plant Impedance)  10 / (Plant MVA) 
 
 
Z = 1000  (Impedance in ohms per phase) / (line kV)2  
 
Impedances in series and at different voltages each expressed to a common base 10 MVA can be a added 
numerically, ie R = R1 + R2 and X = X1 + X2. 
 
Fault MVA 
Fault MVA = [1000 /(total % impedance including the generator subtransient  
         reactance to base 10 MVA)]  MVA 
 
Short Circuit heating 
Temp rise in degrees C = [Aps/mm2]2 x (time in seconds) / (material factor) 
where the material factor is about 700 for copper and about 300 for aluminium. 
For the permissable short circuit heating, see BS7671 para 434.5.2.

Calculation of Fault Currents
Thus the minimum size of 11kV XPLE cable to carry 250MVA for 2 seconds is about 150mm2 
 
Force between conductors 
Mean Force = 2 E–4 x I2 / S Newtons/metre run, where S is the conductor spacing in mm 
 
Peak Force = (1.8 x √2 x I)2 x 2 E–4 / S  
      = 1.30 E–3 x I2 / S Newtons/metre run 
 
Motor Contribution 
Add induction motor starting currents to the fault current. This is normal practice, and some standards 
require it. However, in a fault, the voltage falls and the frequency usually rises. Both cause the motor to 
take more current rather than generate. In a heavy fault causing near zero voltage, induction motors are 
likely to generate at slip frequency due to residual magnetism in the rotor. This will ”beat” with the fault 
current and there will be times when the currents are in anti phase.

Symetrical Components
Symetrical Components 
 
Symmetrical Components 
The method of expressing unbalanced currents by symmetrical components is well documented and 
covered in many textbooks. The following is a summary of what is published elsewhere. 
 
Evaluating Symmetrical Components 
The currents in a three phase system can be represented by the sum of three symmetrical three phase 
currents. The Figure shows the symmetrical components of three very unbalanced currents IA, IB and IC. 
I1 , I2 and I0 are the positive, negative and zero sequence components. h is the operator that rotates the 
vector by 120 degrees. 
 
 
 
 
 
Symmetrical Components 
 
The vector equations are true; 
 
Ia = I0 + I1 + I2 
 
Ib = I0 + h2 I1 + h I2 
 
Ic = I0 + h I1 + h2 I2 
h is the operator that rotates the vector by 120 degrees. 
 
h = – 1/2 + j 83 /2 
 
h2 = – 1/2 – j 83 /2 
 
h3 = 1 
 
Also 
1 + h +h2 = 0 
 
Adding Ia + Ib + Ic = 3 x I0
 
 
Ia + h  Ib + h2  Ic = 3  I1 
 
Ia + h2  Ib + h  Ic = 3  I2 
These equations show that there is always one but only one set of symmetrical components for any given 
three currents 
 
Impedance drop 
Let Z1 , Z2 and Z0 be the impedances per phase of the circuit to the positive, negative and zero sequence 
components of the current.

Symetrical Components
Generator emfs are; 
Ea = E 
Eb = h 2  E 
Ec = h  E 
 
Va = E – Ia  Z  
      = E – (I1  Z1 +  I2  Z2 + I0  Z0) 
Vb = h 2  E – (h 2  I1  Z1 + h  I2  Z2 + I0  Z0) 
Vc = h  E – (h  I1  Z1 + h2  I2  Z2 + I0  Z0) 
 
Three phase fault (LLL) 
Ia = Ifault 
Ia + Ib + Ic = 0 
Va = Vb = Vc = Vfault 
 
Substituting in the above equations and simplifying; 
Vfault = 0,  I1 = Ifault,     I2 = 0 and  I0 = 0 
Ifault  = E /Z1 
 
For fault calculations, put XF and RF equal to the sum of all positive sequence reactances and resistances 
respectively between the generators and the fault. 
 
Single phase to ground (LG) 
Ia = Ifault 
Va = Ib = Ic = 0 
Substituting and simplifying; 
I1 = I2 = I0 = Ifault / 3 
Ifault = 3  E / (Z1 + Z2 + Z0) 
 
For fault calculations put XF equal to the sum of all positive and negative and zero sequence reactances 
between the generators and the fault. Similarly put RF equal to all the positive and negative and zero 
resistances. The fault current is then three times the value calculated for E / Z. 
 
Line to line (LL) 
Ia =0 
Ib = - Ic = Ifault 
Vb = Vc 
Substituting and simplifying; 
I0 = 0 
I1 = – I2 = (h - h 2)  If/3 
If = E  83 / (Z1 + Z2) 
 
For fault calculations put XF equal to the sum of all positive and negative sequence reactances and RF 
equal to the sum of positive and negative sequence resistances between the generators and the fault. The 
fault current is then 83 times the value calculated for E / Z.

Symetrical Components
 
Line to line and ground fault (LLG) 
Ia = 0,    Vb = Vc = 0 
 
Substituting and simplifying; 
I1 = E /( Z1 + Z0  Z2 /(Z0 + Z2)) 
I2 = – I1  Z0 /( Z0 + Z2) 
I0 = – I1  Z2 /( Z0 + Z2) 
Ib = I0 + h2 I1 + h I2 
Ic = I0 + h I1 + h2 I2 
Current to ground = 3  I0 
 
For fault calculations, it is best to calculate the symmetrical components and then add them vectorally to 
obtain Ib and Ic. The current to ground, which will be needed if there is earth fault protection, is three 
times the zero sequence component.  
 
Using these values for the fault calculations, the positive sequence current and the positive sequence 
busbar voltage are obtained. 
 
Power in terms of symmetrical components 
Power due to I1 is the sum of the vector dot products; 
W = E I1 + h 2 E  h2 I1 + h E  h I1 
    = E  I1  Cos( 1) +E  I1  Cos( 1) + E  I1  Cos( 1) 
    = 83  (line kV)  I1  Cos( 1) 
Power due to I2 is the sum of the vector dot products; 
W = E  I2 +  h 2 E  h I2 + h E  h 2  I2 
    = E  I2  Cos( 2) + E  I2  Cos (2x/3 + 2) + E  I2  Cos (2/3 - 2) 
    = E  I2  [ Cos( 2) – (1/2)  Cos( 2) – (83/2 )  Sin( 2) – (1/2)  Cos( 2) + (83/2)  Sin( 2) ] 
    = 0 
Power due to I0 is the sum of the vector dot products; 
W = E  I0+ h 2 E  I0+ h E  I0 = 0 
 
Thus the total power due to the symmetrical components is; 
W = 83  (line kV)  I1  Cos( 1) 
where W is in MW, I1 is in kiloamps and  1 is the phase angle of I1

Symetrical Components
Use the turns ratio, not the line voltage ratio to calculate the currents on the primaries of Delta / Star 
Transformers. 
 
A single line to ground fault of I in one phase of the secondary of the transformer gives rise to a current of 
I  kv0/(/3  kv1) in two phases of the primary. 
 
A further delta star transformer has a current of I  kv0/(3  kv2) in two phases of its primary and a current 
of 2  I  kv0/(3  kv2) in the third phase. 
 
A Star / Star transformer with a third Delta winding, ie Star / Delta / Star has a current of (I / 3)  kv0/kv1 
in two phases of the Star primary and a current of (2  I / 3)  kv0/kv1 in the third phase. 
 
 
 
A Line to Line Fault of I at kv0 on the secondary side of a delta / star transformer appears as a current of  
I  kv0/(/3  kv1) on two phases of the primary. The third phase has a current of 2  I  kv0/(/3  kv1). 
 
A further delta / star transformer has a current of I  kv0 / kv2 in two phases. 
 
A Star / Delta / Star transformation gives a current of I  kv0 / kv1 in two phases of the primary.

Double Line to ground fault involves the vector sum and difference between the currents on each phase. 
Thus it is best to keep the fault currents in terms of the symmetrical components until final evaluation. 
 
Combination of Fault current and Load current 
LLL and LLLG Faults 
The Fault current and Load current are both positive phase sequence only 
Hence Total Current = vector sum of Fault current ifault and Load current iL 
= /[{ifault  cos (F) + iL  cos (L)}2 + {ifault  sin (F) + iL  sin (L)}2 ] 
where F = arctan( XF/RF) and L = arctan (XL/RL) 
 
LG Fault 
The Positive, Negative and Zero phase sequence currents are all in phase on the line with the fault. The 
Fault current ifault is the sum of these currents. 
Hence on the phase with the fault, 
Total current = vector sum of ifault and iL 
Hence Total Current 
= /[ {ifault  cos (F) + iL  cos (L)}2 + {ifault  sin (F) + iL  sin (L)}2 ] 
where F = arctan( XF/RF) and L = arctan (XL/RL) 
On the other two phases, the fault current is zero. 
 
LL Fault 
Zero sequence component = 0 
Assume the fault is between phases B and C 
 
On phase A, the Fault current is zero. 
On phase A, the Negative sequence component is equal and opposite to the Positive sequence component.

Symetrical Components
On phase B, 
Fault current = h2  Positive seq component + h  Negative seq component 
 
        = (h2 - h)  Positive seq component 
Fault current = /3 x Positive sequence component of the Fault current 
This current lags the voltage Eb by (F - /6) 
On phase C, 
Fault current is equal and opposite to the Fault current on phase B 
It lags the voltage Ec by (F + /6) 
 
Hence the Total current 
= /[ {ifault  cos (T) + iL  cos (L)}2 + {ifault  sin (T) + iL  sin (L)}2 ] 
where F = arctan(XF/RF) and L = arctan (XL/RL) 
On phase B 
(T) = ( F –  /6) 
On phase C 
(T) = (F +  /6) 
 
LLG Faults 
The positive sequence component of the Fault Current can be obtained directly by putting; 
XF = X1 + (R0 
2  X2 + R2
2  X0 + X0  X2  (X0 + X2 )) 
 
 
 
 
 
/((R0 + R2)2 + (X0 + X2)2) 
RF = R1 + (R0  R2  (R0 + R2) + R2  X0
2 + R0  X2

Symetrical Components
This impedance can be combined with the Load Impedance to obtain the equivalent impedance R + jX 
This enables the Total Positive sequence component to be obtained which can then be separated into the 
Load Current and Positive Sequence Component of the Fault Current. 
 
 
 
The Negative and Zero components of the Fault Current can then be obtained. 
 
Let Positive Seq Component be Ipos at phase angle Pos 
Pos = arctan(XF/RF) 
 
Let Negative Seq Component be Ineg at phase angle Neg on phase A 
Put R3 = R0 + R2 and X3 = X0 + X2 
Ineg = - Ipos  (R0 + j X0 ) / (R3 + j X3) 
        = - Ipos  [ (R0  R3 + X0  X3 ) + j(R3 x X0 - R0  X3)] / (R3
2 + X3
2 ) 
Hence magnitude of  Ineg  is given by 
Ineg = - Ipos  /[(R0  R3 + X0  X3 )2 + (R3  X0 - R0  X3)2 ] / (R3
2 + X3
2 ) 
Neg = F + arctan[ (R3  X0 - R0  X3) / (R0  R3 + X0  X3 ) ] 
 
Interchange suffix 2 and 0 to get; 
Magnitude of Izero is given by 
Izero = - Ipos  /[(R2  R3 + X2  X3 )2 + (R3  X2 - R2  X3)2 ] / (R3
2 + X3
2 ) 
Zero = F + arctan[ (R3  X2 - R2  X3) / (R2  R3 + X2  X3 ) ] 
 
Thus the current in all phases with and without Load Current can be obtained by the vector addition of the 
relevant currents. 
Currents in phase B 
 
Fault Current in phase B = 
/[{Ipos  Cos(Pos) + Ineg  Cos(Neg – /3) + Izero  Cos(Zero +/ 3)}2 
 +{Ipos  Sin(Pos) + Ineg  Sin(Neg – /3) + Izero  Sin(Zero +/3)}2 ] 
Similarly, Fault Current in phase C = 
/[{Ipos  Cos(Pos) + Ineg  Cos(Neg + /3) + Izero  Cos(Zero -/3)}2 
 +{Ipos  Sin(Pos) + Ineg  Sin(Neg + /3) + Izero  Sin(Zero -/3)}2 ] 
 
Current to ground = 3  Izero 
 
For parts of the network carrying both Load Current and Fault Current, 
put Ipos = ifault but keeping Ineg and Izero unchanged as these currents do not flow in the load circuit.

Works tests 
Manufacturers usually carry out tests on their standard range of products.  The direct and quadrature axes 
subtransient, transient reactances and time constants of generators are measured by a short circuit test on a 
running machine.  The exciter characteristics are also measured.   Pressure tests and impulse tests may be 
specified for individual machines in the contract of purchase.  Impulse tests are artificial lightning strikes.  
A bank of capacitors are charged up in parallel then switched into series to give a voltage impulse of up to 
3 million volts rising to full value in one microsecond then decaying to 50% value in a further 50 
microseconds.  The current behaves like a high frequency current and will not go easily round corners.  A 
lightning strike can blast a hole through a masonery abutment rather than follow round it via a lightning 
conductor of large section copper.  The capacitances in the high voltage bushings of a transformer or 
switchgear play an important part in protecting the equipment in an impulse test.  These tests are factory 
tests and cannot normally be done on site.  
 
To Commission new Electrical Plant, the following tests need to be carried out. 
 
1.) Dry out 
2.) Operation tests 
3.) Primary Injection 
4.) Secondary Injection 
5.) Pressure tests 
6.) Phase polarity test 
 
Dry Out 
All new plant with insulation that can absorb moisture must be dried out before any voltage tests are 
carried out. Motors can be dried out by applying a low voltage three phase ac supply to the machine. Use a 
voltage that is too low to rotate the machine but high enough to give a current somewhat lower than full 
load current. The cooling fan is not supplying cooling air, so the current should not reach the full load 
value. 
 
At regular intervals of time, the current is switched off and the insulation resistance is measured. As the 
temperature rises, the insulation resistance falls until a steady temperature is reached. The insulation 
resistance then rises as the machine dries out. When the machine is dry, the insulation resistance again 
levels off. Record both the insulation resistance and the temperature. The winding resistance gives a figure 
for the temperature.

Generators can be dried out by applying a short circuit to earth on all phases and the machine run on hand 
excitation control. The short circuit connection must be rated for continuous full load current. The normal 
switchgear earthing gear must on no account be used as it is usually rated for only 30 seconds. A failure of 
this connection will lead to a catastrophe, the machine voltage will rise rapidly. As the connection melts, a 
high power fault close to the power station busbars will develop leading to a power station busbar fault. 
 
Some operators remove the generator trip fuses during the dry out. If the machine circuit breaker trips 
inadvertently, the voltage could rise above the machine rating before the insulation is fully dry and 
permanently damage the machine. 
 
Dry out may not be possible if the machine is of the brushless excitation design. These machines have an 
ac exciter on the same shaft as the generator. The exciter field is the stator. The exciter rotor generates ac 
which is converted to dc by silicon rectifiers at the generator field on the generator rotor. The generator 
stator is the generator armature. The voltage regulator controls the exciter field and hand control of the 
exciter may not be possible.  
 
Short circuit and open circuit characteristics can be plotted during and after the dry out if required. 
 
Operation tests 
With the switchgear in the racked out position, attach the secondary jump leads. Operate all the closing 
and tripping controls and trip the switch by all the protection relays. 
 
Primary Injection 
Apply a short circuit on the plant and connect a high current low voltage ac supply from a Primary 
Injection set. Apply the full rated ac current and measure the current in all the CT secondary circuits. Use 
a milliammeter to display the residual current in earth fault circuits. With all phases short circuited on one 
side of the plant, apply the primary injection on the other side. Apply the current between the red and 
yellow phases, repeat between the yellow and blue phases and repeat again between the blue and red 
phases. Finally apply the injection current between one phase and earth. Record the current in all CT 
secondary circuits and the CT residual current on each test and check the results are as expected. 
Many relays use a metal plug to set the current rating. A useful device is a split plug to fit these relays 
with a lead to an ammeter connected to each side of the split plug.

Secondary Injection 
Apply a low power single phase ac current from secondary injection set to each CT secondary circuit and 
check the operation of all protection relays and the instrumentation. Time the operation of time lagged 
relays. 
 
Voltage transformer secondary circuits are also tested at this time. Remove the voltage transformer fuses 
to prevent any feedback that might make the voltage transformer primary live at full voltage. If a new 
power station is being commissioned, the synchronising panel will also need to be tested. 
 
Pressure Tests. 
The main electrical circuit is tested with a high voltage dc test set. If the neutral is earthed through an 
impedance, test the red phase with the yellow phase against the blue phase and earth. Repeat the test with 
the yellow phase and blue phase against the red phase and earth. The test voltages are at prescribed levels, 
eg use a 30 kV dc test voltage on an 11kV rms line voltage system. BEWARE A NON LETHAL HIGH 
VOLTAGE DC TEST SET CHARGES UP THE CAPACITANCE IN HIGH VOLTAGE CABLES TO A 
LETHAL VALUE. Discharge the cables after the test, wait a few minutes and discharge them again. 
Repeat again and again till fully discharged. It can take many minutes to discharge a long cable. Keep the 
cables earthed while making the connections for the next test. 
 
If the neutral is solidly earthed, the operating voltage to earth is 1/√3 times the voltage between lines and 
the pressure tests should take account of this lower voltage. 
 
Phase polarity test 
When all the above tests have been successfully done, the plant may be energised for the first time. 
However if the plant is part of a duplicate supply, the phase connection must be checked before switching 
the plant into parallel operation. Energise the plant from one end and check the polarity of the voltage 
transformer secondary with another voltage transformer secondary. Switch off the new plant and energise 
from the other end and check the voltage transformer polarities again. 
 
If there is no suitable voltage transformer, then a high voltage voltmeter is required to check the polarity 
of high tension equipment. 
 
Check the direction of rotation of three phase motors. 
 
Automatic Voltage Regulator compounding 
When commissioning a generator, the AVR compounding will need to be checked. Incorrect 
compounding is a common fault on new machines. There is always an earth connection in CT secondary 
circuits and an earth connection on voltage transformer secondary circuits. The AVR compounding 
connects a current transformer circuit to a voltage transformer circuit and if these both have an earth 
connection they may short out the compounding. When the generator supplies a lagging current, the 
machine reactance lowers the voltage. The AVR compounding must not eliminate this voltage drop or the 
machines will not run in parallel.

Fault Finding 
 
High impedance faults 
A high impedance fault on one phase of a long underground cable or overhead power line can be located 
by a high voltage bridge. 
 
 
 
Connect the remote end of the faulty core to a healthy core. Connect the high voltage bridge to this 
healthy core and the faulty core. Supply the bridge from a high voltage test set and balance the bridge on 
the slider. Note the readings R1 and R2. 
 
Although the fault resistance may be several thousand ohms and the cable core only a few ohms, the ratio 
[L1 + (L1 - L2)]/L2 is equal to R1/R2 
 
Thus L2/L1 = 2 R2/(R1 + R2) 
 
It is prudent to keep a record of the exact location of all cable joints on a long underground cable. The 
fault is usually at a joint unless there is obvious damage above ground.
