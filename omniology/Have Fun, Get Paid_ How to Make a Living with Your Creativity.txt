Introduction
I’ve been a creative creature my entire life. It’s not something I chose. It’s just 
the way I’m wired, factory defects notwithstanding. I suspect it’s the same 
for you. We don’t create because we woke up one morning and thought 
it would be an interesting way to spend the day. We bring our art to life 
because we’re compelled to do so. I could no more make my creative urges 
disappear than I could stop my heart from beating. 
Self-expression can be great fun, and it gets even better when there’s an 
enthusiastic audience. What it’s not so great at is paying the bills. Everyone’s 
familiar with the term starving artist, and for good reason. The world is full 
of incredibly talented people who work at a job they hate because they 
can’t make enough money with their art. 
It’s a common tale. If you’ve ever found yourself in that situation, you also 
know that it’s a painful experience. What you may not realize is that most 
of that pain is self-inflicted. You’re not nearly as far from your dreams as 
you think.
I can’t make you rich and famous. Anyone who tells you he can is more 
interested in lining his own pockets than yours. Besides, I’m not scandalously 
wealthy myself. I don’t travel in my own Learjet and when I come home, it’s 
not to a huge mansion. If I promised that I could show you the path to fame, 
fortune, and your own fleet of private jets, I’d bloody well better have all 
that stuff myself. Otherwise, it’s nothing but hot air.
On the other hand, most of the creative people I’ve known in my life don’t 
require millions of dollars to be happy. What they really want is to make 
a living with their artistic talents. I doubt you’d be opposed to getting rich. 
However, if you can make ends meet doing what you love and have a little 
left over for fun and toys, life’s pretty good. 
Don’t get me wrong; I haven’t given up on private planes and the occasional 
Ferrari. By the standards I just outlined, though, I consider my career thus far 
to be a success. The spoils are modest, but I’m happy and having a great time. 
Instead of a mansion, I have a nice little custom-built house in the country, 
north of Atlanta. The lower level has a high-tech recording studio that I can 
walk into day or night should the muse strike. I’ve never driven a Ferrari, 
but my little red Corvette is perfectly capable of getting me into trouble

whenever I like. When the bills are paid each month, there’s enough left 
over to keep me entertained. Life is good. 
The most important reason it’s good is that every dollar I make comes 
from one of my creative pursuits. I’m a musician, a writer, a speaker, a 
software developer, a director, and probably a few other things that don’t 
immediately come to mind. At any given moment, some of these things are 
helping me pay the bills and live life on my own terms. It’s been a long, long 
time since I worked in factories in order to pay the rent. 
This book isn’t intended to be a master class. It’s a beginning, filled with 
all the practical, down-to-earth things you need to know in order to build 
a successful, long-term career with your creativity. Some of what you’ll 
find throughout these pages will be of the nuts-and-bolts variety. However, 
more than anything else, I want to teach you how to think and act like a 
professional. That’s the heart and soul of any successful career. It’s also the 
missing ingredient whose absence creates starving artists.
You’re more than just a talented person. You’re actually a small business. 
Like any start-up, in order to achieve your goals you have to understand 
the rules of the game so that you can play to win. Most creatives shy away 
from the world of commerce and marketing, often handing those tasks off 
to anyone who says they’ll take care of them. Just as often, the artist gets 
screwed sooner or later. 
It doesn’t have to be that way. You’re perfectly capable of managing every 
aspect of your career, and it’s not nearly as scary or distasteful as you might 
think. In fact, like most things, when you get good at it you’ll find it’s quite a 
bit of fun. Success always is.
Since we’ve already established that I don’t have mansions and yachts myself, 
I can’t tell you how to acquire them. What I do have is a very satisfying life 
paying the bills with my creativity, and that’s something I can show you how 
to achieve. You don’t need any special skills beyond your artistic talents, and 
you don’t have to spend money in order to make it work. If you’re not afraid 
of a little hard work and have some commonsense, you’ll be surprised at 
how straightforward career building can be. 
There’s no magic. Success comes from using your head and putting 
consistent effort into managing the business side of your art. This stuff 
doesn’t just work for me. I learned it by watching and listening to countless 
others. These were regular, working-class creative creatures who made a 
decent living doing what they love. 
Maybe you’ll win the artistic lottery and become rich and famous one day.  
I truly hope you do. In the meantime, you still need to pay the bills and eat on  
a regular basis. That’s what we’re going to explore. If I’ve done my job right, 
when we’re through you’ll be standing on your own two feet and will be

ready and able to take it from there. There’s always more to learn, but you’ll 
have a firm foundation in the basics, those things that matter most.
You can absolutely achieve success in the arts, but you’re going to have 
to work for it. Part of that work begins here. The principles I cover are 
common to all the arts, and of course there are a lot of different art forms. 
I’ll mix it up as we go, using a musician in one example, a painter in the next, 
and then maybe a software developer followed by a dancer. The concepts 
will be clear and easy to follow, but it’s up to you to translate them into 
your own world. In so doing, you’ll often gain additional insights that you 
wouldn’t have encountered had you merely read a sentence without doing 
your own thinking.
There are two major divisions in the arts. The performing arts include 
singers, dancers, actors, and other strange creatures of the night. On the 
other side of the fence are those who create a lasting product, whether 
it’s a painting, software program, sculpture, drawing, photograph, book, or 
anything else that lives longer than the act of creating it. I’ve done my best 
to touch on as many forms of creativity as possible in my examples. 
Even so, they’re not distributed with mathematical precision, and that really 
doesn’t matter. There is a common thread that runs through all the arts, 
and equally common are concepts that apply to making a living with your 
passion. Not only will it be easy for you to see how the chapters apply to 
your own field; you’ll begin to see how your art form connects to all others. 
If you think that’s a great opportunity to make new friends, you’re right on 
the money.
So, get something nice to drink, prop up your feet, and enjoy the ride. It’s 
far easier than you think to make a good living in the creative arts. You 
already know how to have fun. It’s time to get paid.

The Creative 
Mindset
Creativity is a force as old as humanity itself. From the high-tech marvels 
of modern society to the humble paintings that adorned the walls of 
bohemian cave dwellers, many of us are driven to dream, visualize, and 
express ourselves. The method of that expression varies with the artist 
and frequently within the art itself, but the urge will not be denied. It is 
primal.
From the time you were a small child, you probably exhibited such cre-
ative tendencies, much like previews of coming attractions at your favorite 
theater. Maybe you walked around the house singing and dancing. Perhaps 
you told stories or made clay statues. You might have even been moved 
to draw big red hearts on the living room wall with red crayons when 
Valentine’s Day rolled around. I wouldn’t recommend the last one unless 
you enjoy having close encounters of a parental kind. Don’t ask me how 
I know.
You are not a creative creature because you chose to be. Much like the 
color of your hair and the shape of your nose, you’re stuck with it. You can 
no more make it go away than you can force your heart to stop beating by 
clicking your heels together. That’s a good thing, too, for the result in either 
case would be disastrous. For most of us who feel these urges, they are a core 
part of our being.
You can, of course, change the color of your hair if you like, but sooner 
or later the real thing will reassert itself with the tenacity of an underfed 
bulldog. Many creative people, often referred to simply as creatives in the 
high-dollar advertising world of Madison Avenue, will try to deny this part

of their nature. Sometimes they’re frustrated with the difficulties of trying 
to make a living doing what they love. Other times they just want to fit in 
and have a normal life. However, try as you might to avoid it, sooner or later 
your true colors will fly.
You can’t hide or ignore your artistic flair. Passion will always find a way out. The sooner you give 
in, the sooner you can figure out how to make a living doing what you love.
To some extent, creative skills can be learned. You can read a book, watch 
a video, go to school, or just spend time with someone who’s further 
down the road than you. These mechanics are necessary to express your-
self well but they are not the art. They are merely the tools you use to 
bring forth the desired results.
You can teach a chimpanzee to paint, but that doesn’t make it a painter 
any more than flipping switches in a tin can makes one an astronaut. Neil 
Armstrong’s dramatic last-minute piloting of the Apollo 11 lunar module 
saved the day and made a successful moon landing possible. Our small 
furry friend could have wiggled the same joystick but the result would 
have been less joyful.
Passion and inspiration distinguish the true creative. They are the source 
from which all creative endeavors flow. Without a doubt, you must also 
have the technical skills to bring that dream to life or you’re just a passion-
ate primate. Nonetheless, this rocket fuel of the soul is what makes soft-
ware developers spend days working without sight of a bed in pursuit of 
their vision. It’s the reason musicians are willing to sleep on floors as long 
as they can make it to the next gig. As a creative, you know what it’s like 
to come to the point where you weigh the benefits of spending that last 
dollar on food or something that will further your art. Food rarely wins.
The life of a drug addict is nothing compared to that of a creative crea-
ture. With the possible exception of love, there is no greater addiction or 
dependency on the planet than the never-ending pull of artistic urges. In 
fact, the history of people both great and ordinary is replete with examples 
of love coming in a distant and winded second to the passion of someone’s 
creative pursuits. To say that our artistic compulsion can be disruptive to a 
normal and healthy personal life is an exercise in understatement.
And yet, we persist. We spend time and money we don’t have to enable 
our addiction. I was going to call it a “hobby,” but that simply doesn’t do 
it justice. If you asked the average creative if he’d rather have a long and 
healthy life or create a brilliant masterpiece, he’d have to think about it. 
We’re not always the most logical of beings.

All Roads Lead to Home
If home is where the heart is, then it’s no secret where we live. There are, 
however, a great many ways to get there. In each generation, there will be 
a lively discussion surrounding what does and does not qualify as art. For 
the most part, these conversations serve no purpose beyond entertaining 
or infuriating a roomful of artistic types. The one thing that doesn’t change 
is the fact that throughout the human race, creativity has been expressed in 
wondrous variety.
That’s not to say that the limit is one form of expression per customer. 
On the contrary, it’s not at all uncommon to find someone who expresses 
herself in many different ways. An actor may also be a screenwriter. A 
sculptor might find gratification in painting. Software developers are often 
musicians. These are, of course, just a few examples.
In my own life, the creative urge that started out as a passion for music 
has spread to a number of disciplines. In addition to writing songs, I found 
that I also enjoyed writing stories, columns, and books. Jumping up and 
down on stage led me to explore, for a very brief period, modern jazz 
dance. The combination of books and my stage experience led to public 
speaking. When personal computers became common, I stumbled into 
software development. In a similar fashion, I began to expand my record-
ing studio to include video production, writing, and directing a comedy 
Web series. Movies aren’t far behind.
In the game of life, I’ve barely reached the halfway point, so as time goes 
on I’ll probably find even more ways to express myself. This doesn’t mean 
that I’m particularly gifted or special. As my friends would be quick to 
point out, it more likely indicates that I have the attention span of an 
overcaffeinated squirrel. Be that as it may, it does serve to illustrate the 
diversity pursued by a great many of us in the creative arts. It may not 
make us rich and famous, but it certainly keeps boredom at bay.
All of which begs the question, What is a creative creature? Even if I hadn’t 
experienced such a delightful variety of opportunities in my own life, it’s 
not hard to realize that any definition must be broad and expansive. Since 
my purpose is to help kindred spirits make a better living pursuing the 
things they love, it might be worth taking a moment to touch on some of 
the arts that we’ll be visiting in our travels together.
One of the first things that comes to mind when we think of creativity is 
the performing arts. Live performance in theaters had been with us since 
long before the days of the ancient Greeks, although the venues may not 
have been as grand. We tend to think of just the actors on stage as being 
involved in a performance, but of course there are countless related dis-
ciplines required to bring it all together. A stage would be a dreary place

indeed without a good set designer, and appropriate wardrobe is recom-
mended for all but the most risqué of productions.
Plays are often performed on the same stages used by dance companies, 
another art that was doubtless with us even in our caveman days. Of 
course, what’s a good dance without music? Singers and instrumentalists 
abound throughout the history of the arts. The performance of poetry 
is another time-honored craft, a heritage to which modern rap owes 
allegiance.
When you take any or all of these elements and point a camera at it, you 
have yet another method of expression, from the great cinematic master-
pieces of movies to the modest entertainment of cat videos. Of course, if 
you have a video of a kitten that can perform a rap version of Shakespeare 
while dancing to a lively tune, you’ve probably pushed the boundaries of 
cross-disciplinary expression or, at the very least, good taste.
While implicit in many of the disciplines discussed thus far, writing is also a 
world unto its own. From theater and poetry to short stories and books, 
as long as there’s a way to embed words in a permanent medium, there 
will be someone who has something to say. Fortunately, rumors about 
large quantities of chimpanzees and Shakespeare notwithstanding, there 
are no documented instances of the feline community encroaching on this 
territory.
Although the term “starving artist” has been appropriated by pretty much 
anyone who attempts to make a living with their musings, in some cases 
that starving creative is, in fact, an artist. Whether it’s in the form of 
drawing, painting, or computer graphics, the visual arts have been one of 
the most enduring accomplishments of humanity. Perhaps they danced 
by firelight outside of their ancient caves, but what we remember is the 
decorations on their walls.
Technology also affords us with variations on the theme. Once limited to 
a single image, visual artists can now string them together to present ani-
mated movies, from the blockbuster CGI creations of today’s box-office 
hits to the delightful hand-drawn adventures of Bugs Bunny and his friends 
in the 1930s and 40s. Cameras, of course, also started life by producing a 
single-frame experience, giving rise to the art of photography.
Our high-tech computerized tools give us a number of other ways to 
express ourselves as well. Software development and Web design, while 
often funded by boring business types, are nonetheless highly creative 
endeavors. Along with animation and graphic design, many creatives also 
work in three dimensions when they use CAD software capable of design-
ing anything from pepper shakers to robots capable of looking for salt on 
the surface of Mars.

This list does not encompass all of the creative arts by any stretch of the 
imagination. It does, however, offer a setting in which we can consider the 
many things we have in common, chief among them a desire to pay the 
bills by doing what we love.
It’s not practical to discuss concepts and then offer specific examples for 
each and every art form known to man unless you happen to be writ-
ing an encyclopedia with an unlimited amount of pages at your disposal. 
What we’ll be doing instead is looking at the challenges we face in our 
careers and presenting solutions in a manner that will allow us to map 
them to our own reality.
This is not nearly as difficult as you might think. Regardless of the man-
ner in which you create, you are a part of a larger community of kindred 
spirits who share a great many things in common.
Common Ground
As we’ve already considered to a degree, the one thing I think we can all 
relate to is the desire to express what we feel inside or see in our mind’s 
eye. (I was going to say the voices in our heads, but as that tends to end 
badly we’ll just skip it for the moment.)
To do this, we need an audience. This compulsion we feel to share with 
others that which we bring into being is not only at the very heart of 
the creative community; it’s our bond with the rest of the human race. 
Without someone to enjoy what we’ve done, there’s little joy or purpose 
in the endeavor.
While it’s true that the best art is often created for the artist herself, it’s of 
little value if others can’t share in the experience. The adrenaline we feel 
when the crowd delights in our presentation is equal only to the depths 
of despair that we experience when it goes over like a lead zeppelin. 
Without people we are nothing.
While you may want to create art for no other reason than to satisfy your soul, it’s a lot more fun 
if you share the experience. It also pays better.
I’m not an art critic by any definition and neither do I consider myself 
an authority on the matter. I have, however, observed that there are two 
fundamental approaches to what we would call art. They are distinguished 
not so much by what is created but rather by the mindset of the person 
doing the creating.

Chapter 1 | The Creative Mindset

Emotional art is something that touches a wide range of people, as every-
one has feelings. This can be something as simple as a country song about 
how bad it feels to lose your wife, your pickup truck, and your dog all on 
the same day. Most of us have experienced heartbreak, so it’s easy for an 
emotional song to resonate with us. We may not own pickup trucks, but 
the feeling is the same even if what we lost was just a four-door Chevy.
Personal experiences, however, are not the only way an art form can be 
emotional in nature. A painter may work from a place of deep melancholy 
and with canvas and oils produce a scene that makes us want to cry just 
by looking at it. When a creative starts with emotion and pours that into 
her work with the primary motivation being to express what she feels, it’s 
what I would consider emotional art regardless of the techniques used 
to convey it.
This is not the only way that people approach the creative arts, of course. 
There is another school of thought, typically employed by those who are 
well educated in their craft, that prizes analysis.
While it can be argued that there are no rules in art other than that you 
should be true to your inner artist, there are without a doubt a great 
many rules in most of the disciplines. Many of them are subject to lively 
debate. Even so, they exist because, at least in some cases, they’ve been 
demonstrated to have value. For example, there are colors that tend to 
go well together just as some notes produce better harmony when placed 
next to each other than others. In many disciplines, these rules can be 
both deep and complex as, for instance, in the writing of a science fiction 
novel.
People who are passionate about a particular art form, or perhaps a genre 
of the art, such as a science fiction novel, may study that specific subject at 
universities or many other venues. In their education, they may be walked 
through the history of the art and the different directions it’s taken as the 
result of various movements. The nuts and bolts of technical execution 
may also be addressed. In a purely intellectual approach to art, it’s com-
mon to dismiss how it makes the audience feel, focusing instead on how 
well it was crafted based on the set of rules and precedents at hand.
As you might imagine, these approaches can produce very different sets of 
opinions about what’s good and what’s bad. I’ve seen some heated argu-
ments that I thought would come to blows when a work was discussed by 
those of the differing philosophies. And yet, in the arts, there is no right or 
wrong. An intellectual approach to creation is just as valid as an emotional 
one. You can even mix the two in whatever proportions you like. All that 
matters is that you create what you’re compelled to express.
For most artists, getting the acceptance of their respective audience is 
a critical matter. An intellectual may care about the pronouncements of 

Have Fun, Get Paid
7
highly respected critics. To an emotional performer, the response of the 
crowd may be the only validation that is needed. Either way, we stand on 
the widest patch of common ground. We create, and how our creation 
is received affects us deeply.
However, all of that pales in comparison to our greatest common bond. 
For those who dream of doing nothing but pursuing their passions and 
being able to eat on a regular basis, the challenge of actually pulling it off 
is something we can all relate to.
As we explore the perils and pitfalls of paying the bills in notoriously 
fickle creative industries, we’ll find that while our methods of creation 
may differ greatly, the roadblocks look very much the same. In an ever 
more connected world, that’s actually a good thing. We can now learn 
not only from our own domain but also through the experiences of those 
in related fields. Though it’s unlikely that we’ll ever unite all creative crea-
tures in a single harmonious community, our goals, dreams, and desires 
bring us ever closer together to the benefit of all.
We Are Legion
As we’ve seen, defining creativity is a tricky proposition even on a good 
day. It gets even more complicated when you factor in all the new oppor-
tunities that our high-tech society provides.
Once upon a time, if you wanted an orchestra, you had to hire a room-
ful of musicians, each playing a different instrument. Today, a composer in 
the recording studio can fire up software and write an entire symphony, 
assign the instruments to some very realistic-sounding libraries, and hit 
play. Poof. Instant orchestra.
The composer of this symphony didn’t actually play the French horn, the 
clarinet, or any of the other parts. So, did she really create the perfor-
mance of the symphonic recording you’re listening to? Some instrumen-
talists might call it fake or otherwise invalid. However, the music sounds 
real enough to me, so she gets my vote for being the creator.
It gets fuzzier still when you listen to contemporary music. In the rap and 
hip-hop genre, it’s common for people to take a sample of someone else’s 
recording and use it as an instrument in its own right. Hit the drum here, 
play the piano there, kick off the selected sample next, and then back to 
the piano. You can stretch that further and have a song consisting entirely 
of samples from the work of others. Who did the creating? It’s a question 
that doesn’t lend itself to a simple answer.
If you’re a dancer, you may think you’re immune to this until you see that 
videos of several of your performances have been spliced together, placed 

Chapter 1 | The Creative Mindset
8
over some music with graphics added, and presented as a creative work 
of their own. If the video tells a story in its own way, using your dance as 
an artist might use a paintbrush, who did the creating? You did the dancing 
but someone else wrote the music and composed the graphics, not to 
mention coming up with the concept of the video itself.
These are all very simplistic examples of what will, I suspect, become an 
ever more complex environment for the creative arts. Computers and 
a global information network have empowered us as never before, not 
just in terms of reaching an audience but in how we’re able to combine 
sometimes-disparate elements into something new and notable in its own 
right. While there are certainly moral implications in terms of respecting 
the intellectual property rights of others, it is also a very exciting time to 
be a creative creature.
An additional consequence of our environment is the rise of the common 
man as a creative force. If it can be expressed digitally—and much of our 
creativity can—the barriers to entry are dropping so fast that it’s hard to 
keep up with it all.
Once upon a time, if you wanted to write a book, produce a movie, or 
record an album, you had to go through the gatekeepers of that industry. 
There was little choice in the matter due to the economics of creating the 
work. Creating an album required a recording studio with very expensive 
equipment costing hundreds of thousands of dollars or more. Some mix-
ing consoles cost almost a million dollars alone.
Imagine the plight of some guitar player barely making enough to eat by 
playing bars. Such a studio would typically charge more per hour than he 
made the entire weekend. It was simply out of reach. Publishing books 
required a similar infrastructure for printing. Both of these endeavors 
were trivial in cost compared to making a movie.
Even if you happened to have a printing press in your backyard, there were 
still barriers. Merchants only dealt with certain distributors, who only 
dealt with the major publishing companies. It matters little what you could 
create if no one would ever see it.
Fast forward to five minutes ago and you’ll see a very different world for 
those of us who seek to transform dreams into something more tangible. 
The cost of physical tools for digital content creation has plummeted while 
their quality has increased to professional grade. Million-dollar recording 
consoles are no longer required to make high-quality recordings, and the 
same is true for video. Additionally, with the advent of eBooks and print 
on demand (POD) technology, authors no longer need to own a printing 
press.

On the distribution side of things, Amazon, YouTube, and many other such 
sites have given us the power to get our product directly to our audience 
without the need for a middleman. All of this has significant implications 
for the working-class creative, both good and bad.
Having this affordable and accessible power at our fingertips means that 
there are more creative people vying for attention than ever before. So 
much so that it’s a greater challenge cutting through the noise and reach-
ing an audience than it is creating the work in the first place. That’s a lot 
of competition for ears, eyeballs, and money.
With this lower barrier also comes a loss of quality control. There are 
some absolutely brilliant people out there who have, for one reason or 
another, never landed a traditional contract. Unfortunately, they’re lost in 
a massive sea of very unprofessional, amateur-grade content that is in no 
way comparable to the work people would pay for.
It’s not my intent to belittle those who aren’t yet creating at a professional 
level. For some, it’s just a hobby and they don’t want to spend a lot of time 
on perfecting the art. Others may shake the world in a few years and are 
just at the beginning of their careers for the moment. We all start at the 
bottom. And of course, there are chimpanzees that bang on the keyboard 
whether they understand the Bard or not.
None of these considerations matter when you’re trying to reach your 
audience. In the democratized world of the Internet, there is no quality 
control. Anyone can share whatever they like. A potential fan has to wade 
through it all, including the good, the bad, and the artistically challenged, in 
order to find you. Often, they’ll never complete that journey.
Modern technology makes creativity easier than ever, but it also generates millions of 
competitors. You can work with a gatekeeper, find partners, or do the marketing yourself. Have 
a plan, or be ignored.
Gatekeepers are the institutions that we love to hate. Big media com-
panies are evil, greedy, and heartless. Power to the people! That’s all well 
and good when you’re having a spirited discussion with your fellow out-
of-work creatives, and sometimes it’s even true. However, many people 
overlook the value that gatekeepers bring to the party. They are quality-
control specialists. That doesn’t mean everything that gets past them is 
good. It does, however, increase the odds of that being the case.

I’ve been on both sides of the street. The book you’re reading was pro-
duced through a traditional publisher. I’ve worked with them before and 
always had a great experience. I also like the people I work with, which 
is far more important than you may realize. This particular subject was a 
good fit for them and we had a preexisting relationship, so I went through 
a gatekeeper.
I’ve also spent many nights playing guitar in rock and roll bars of dubious 
reputation. Like many such musicians in the days before the Internet laid 
waste to the recording industry, I dreamt of getting a record contract 
and becoming a rich rock star. While I did have the opportunity to sign 
a record deal when living in New York, it wasn’t a particularly good one 
(we’ll touch on the importance of being able to read a contract later on), 
and thus I declined.
My lack of stardom probably has more to do with the fact that I’m an aver-
age musician than the narrow filter employed by gatekeepers. Nonetheless, 
if I wanted to pay the bills by playing music, it was either lots of gigs in 
sometimes-dicey establishments or nothing at all. No gold records. No 
limousines. We’ll leave conversations about groupies for another day.
In today’s world, this limitation no longer applies. Were I still in the mood 
to get a record contract, it would be a fool’s errand for a different reason. 
The industry is in meltdown. Why on earth would I run into a burning 
building? When I had my current house built, I designed a recording studio 
on the lower level that now handles audio and video. If I wanted to sell 
recordings, I’d go directly to the people. No more lopsided record con-
tracts. No more fine print.
As you can see, we have a wealth of options available to us today but with 
them come a new set of challenges. I personally enjoy the fact that it’s not 
an exclusive choice. I can work with a traditional media company in the 
morning, go directly to the people at lunch, and at dinner work with a dif-
ferent media company. Having options is great.
What most people tend to gloss over is the fact that with power comes 
responsibility. Yes, I can go directly to the people and in some cases I’ll do 
exactly that. When I do, the responsibility for moving the merchandise is 
all on me. No one is going to cut through the noise for me, use preexist-
ing relationships to better position my work, or provide me their years of 
expertise in marketing and promotion.
In my case, I spent a decade teaching sales in a previous lifetime, so I’m 
comfortable with doing it on my own. Many creatives don’t have such a 
background and that means a learning curve along with the additional 
effort. You can do it, and it’s great to be empowered. Nonetheless, it’s 
always wise to know your environment. You have tremendous opportu-
nity at your feet, but you’re standing in a very crowded room.

Creatives Just Wanna Have Fun
Problems of quality and building an audience can be solved. All it takes 
is effort and education, and you’re certainly capable of that. Regardless 
of what you wish to learn, there are countless tutorials on the Web. Of 
course, as we just considered, some of it is very high quality, some not so 
much. Nonetheless, you have all the tools you need to figure this stuff out 
and make a good living as an artistic individual.
In fact, since I happen to know that you read books on the topic to improve 
your skills, I can safely tell you that you have several distinct advantages 
over your less motivated brethren. The first and foremost is that you’re 
actually thinking beyond your art.
The problem with most creative creatures is that all we want to do is play. 
If you’re a graphic artist, you want to spend all day drawing. If you’re an 
actor, you just want to stand in front of the camera. Musicians just want 
to make music. Okay, there may also be some drinking and chasing of the 
opposite sex involved, but you get the picture. We just wanna have fun.
Lack of motivation is the single most debilitating affliction that you can 
have if you truly want to pay the bills with your art and not work a day job. 
It is also the most prevalent thing we have in common across all artistic 
disciplines. If you think because I’ve written a book about this sort of thing 
that I’m immune, I’ll be happy to have a serious conversion on the topic. 
But you know, right now I think I just want to go work on my next film, 
and then maybe grab my guitar for a while. Maybe later, okay?
There are moments in the creative process when most of us want to find 
the tallest building we can leap from. Having a vision and bringing it to life 
in the way we want is often frustrating. This is especially true if your art 
form is group oriented and you have to deal with all those pesky humans 
who tend to have their own way of looking at things and are willing to 
argue with you about it. Even so, that’s the fun stuff. We’re following the 
muse, even if she leads us off a cliff.
The moment you mention business or marketing to the average creative 
person, you’ll be lucky to finish the last syllable before they’ve exited the 
building. The dust will settle before your words have the chance to echo 
off the nearest wall.
This is a problem of two parts. The first is sheer terror. We tend to fear 
anything that we don’t understand. If you went to school for your art, 
chances are good they didn’t teach you a lot of business. If they did, there’s 
an equally good chance you cut that class to party with your friends. The 
second difficulty is that it’s boring. Actually, once you’re immersed in the 
noncreative aspects of your career, you’ll find that the business end is 

Chapter 1 | The Creative Mindset

anything but dull. However, to most artists, if it’s not directly related to 
the creation of their art, their eyes glaze over. Right before they bolt for 
the door.
The business side of creativity can actually be a lot of fun once you get the hang of it. The 
first and most important step is accepting the fact that you and you alone are responsible for 
promoting your work. No one else will care about it as much as you do.
Being a creative is not just an activity. It’s a lifestyle, and that’s all the 
life that most creatives want. There’s also an attitude of entitlement that 
you’ll find in most of the business adverse. The general thinking is that we 
should create. That’s our part of the deal. Selling this stuff and bringing in 
the money? That’s someone else’s responsibility. Any time you point out 
that the real world doesn’t work that way, you’ll get a long lecture on how 
unfair it is. Of course, the last time I checked, the real world wasn’t fair.
Among the many problems with this attitude is the fact that it renders the 
creative completely powerless. Any time you hand over responsibilities 
to someone else, you also give up control. The end result is not only that 
you don’t have to do any of that scary business and marketing work, you 
also don’t make any money.
It’s easy to spot the artistic person at the local bar. He’s the one who will 
bend your ear for hours on end about how unfair his particular creative 
industry is and how he’s tired of always being broke. Of course, he’ll also 
ask you to pay for the drinks.
It’s sheer foolishness to tilt at windmills, insisting that the world be other 
than it is. If you have the power to change the world, that’s another mat-
ter. Creative people do have the ability to change their world. However, 
expecting most of them to do so will result in nothing but broken lances 
and smug windmills.
When I was talking to my editor about the market for this book, I told him 
it would apply to a wide range of creative arts. I immediately followed that 
with a caution that this was not nearly as big a market as one might think. 
I would be surprised if even 10 percent of creatives were willing to pull 
themselves up by the bootstraps, educate themselves, and do the work 
required to take control of their careers. Nonetheless, it’s that small sliver 
of motivated people whom I greatly admire, and it is therefore to people 
like you that I dedicate my efforts.

What does all of this mean to you? In the parlance of military strategy, 
it represents a massive tactical advantage. No matter what art form you 
work in, you’re going to have competition. As we’ve discovered, with the 
lower barrier to entry today, that competition is greater than ever. And 
yet, most of your competition will simply sit there doing nothing and wait-
ing for the world to be delivered to them on a silver platter. This reduces 
the number of people with whom you have to compete to a fairly small 
and manageable amount.
Yes, I really just want to immerse myself in creative endeavors and enjoy 
myself. However, what I want more than that is to be successful in reach-
ing an audience. Without readers for my books, listeners for my music, 
and viewers for my films, I’m nothing but a guy with some gear in his 
house. So, I embraced the business side of things. As a result, I discovered 
that I actually enjoyed a lot of it. More importantly, I’ve been making a 
living doing the creative things I love for many, many years. When I was 
first getting started, I worked in factories, dug ditches, and even cleaned 
toilets. Let me assure you, doing creative work is much more fun, even if 
also involves the business side of things.
Artistic Idealism
Another problem that many people struggle with is their sense of artistic 
idealism. It’s great to be passionate about your art and admirable to want 
to hold yourself to the highest standards. Personally, I also think it’s great 
to eat on a regular basis, but perhaps I’m just shallow. Nonetheless, to 
many in our line of work, art should be completely pure and untainted by 
such corrupting influences as money.
You’ll hear a lot of talk about selling out in these conversations, usually 
defined as getting paid for your work. Those who are particularly snobby 
about their craft may hold the opinion that anything commercial must by 
definition appeal to the masses and thus be unworthy of consideration as 
true art.
Personally, I don’t subscribe to the belief that art is only pure if no one is 
willing to pay for it. I think that appealing to the masses is not only accept-
able but also provides a much needed service to society.
Appealing to the masses is not only acceptable but also serves society. You can remain true 
to your art no matter how large your audience. Having a lot of fans also makes it easier to 
eat on a regular basis.

Maybe I only see it that way because I’ve never traveled in the lofty circles 
of the elite. I’m one of the common people. I know what it’s like to sweat 
the bills, to work jobs I hate, to lose in love, and to experience all the 
dilemmas we can encounter in life. If your creativity can lift my spirits, 
give me hope, or just let me escape my troubles for a few hours, I think 
they should erect a statue in your honor. At the very least, they should 
pay you.
Another thing that makes people uncomfortable when merging creativity 
and commerce is the fact that they’re the product that’s being marketed. 
I’ve experienced this one myself and, even though I’m a battle-scarred 
veteran of many sales and marketing adventures, I had a really tough time 
with it.
My Web site naturally has information on the various projects I’m involved 
in as well as any products or services that I might offer at the moment. I’ve 
been running my current company for twelve years. It's a small business 
by conscious intent—just me and my work—due to my desire to keep it 
simple. I do speaking gigs, commercial copywriting, consulting and coach-
ing, a little audio/video work, promote my books, and offer other things 
of that nature.
I’m perfectly comfortable with all of that. I give my best effort to my 
clients, am honest about what I do and don’t cover, and turn away work 
when I don’t feel qualified in a given area. That’s not the problem. The dif-
ficulty arises when it’s time to do the marketing.
All of the offerings I just listed have one thing in common. They’re all about 
me. I write books. I speak at conferences. I do copywriting. Me, me, me. 
Writing in the first person, as I prefer to do, can be very relaxed and per-
sonable. For books and articles, this point of view is fine. Once you start 
hawking your wares, it’s just plain weird. As I wrote promotional materi-
als, I felt like a huge, obnoxious egomaniac who was telling the world how 
great he was. That doesn’t make me feel special. It makes me want to turn 
off the computer, go take a hot shower, and wash all the marketing sleaze 
off of me.
Meanwhile, back in the real world, products and services don’t get sold 
unless you promote them. You don’t have to be a snake oil salesman and 
it actually works against you in the long run if you’re dishonest, but you 
have to sell them. It’s your job to tell people how your offerings solve 
their problems and why they should, therefore, give you their money. It’s 
the nature of commerce and it hasn’t changed in thousands of years, no 
matter how many hot showers I want to take.

A hard-nosed businessperson might laugh at such discomfort, but creative 
people tend to be sensitive about these things. I had a dilemma. I needed to 
effectively promote my work, but I had to do it in a way that didn’t make me 
feel embarrassed. In truth, I’m not sure there really is a solution that com-
pletely answers both concerns. Sometimes, you just have to suck it up and do 
what needs to be done. I did, however, find a compromise that allowed me to 
accomplish my objectives without therapy. I wrote in the third person, and  
I used my full name.
Everyone knows me as Chris. Nobody ever calls me Christopher unless 
I’ve been bad. In fact, I once asked my mother why she bothered giving 
me this long name since no one used it. She just smiled, patted me on 
the head as mothers tend to do and said, “In case you ever need to be 
important, dear.”
Needless to say, I don’t really relate to Christopher. As it turned out, that 
was perfect. On my Web site and anywhere else I needed to talk up my work,  
I spoke as the unseen announcer would on a radio commercial.
“Christopher speaks on a variety of career and leadership topics, always 
ensuring that your audience has a good time in the process.” Okay, still 
pretty weird but I can live with it and not completely kill the payments 
for my hot water heater. I don’t know who this Christopher guy is but he 
seems to know what he’s talking about, and the services he’s selling are 
straightforward enough. Yeah, I guess I can write about this guy.
Does that seem silly to you? Perhaps it is, but it worked for me and got me 
past a debilitating problem regarding my marketing. This may or may not 
be a worthwhile approach for you but that’s not really the point. What’s 
important is the realization that as idealistic creatures, we’re going to 
run into problems like this that more traditional businesses would never 
encounter.
Recently, I revamped my Web site and finally shifted it back to first person. 
It’s more down to earth and personable, and it’s also just the way I write.  
I was only able to do so because I’ve been around long enough that I no 
longer twitch about such things. Besides, I was probably the only one 
who thought it was weird in the first place. We’re always our own worst 
critic.
Nonetheless, whether it’s the notion that art should be pure, the twitch factor 
that comes from having to sell yourself like a can of green beans, or any number  
of other such things, you have to face it head on. Understand yourself for 
who you really are, take another moment to see the world as it truly is, 
and find the path that allows you to live in the real world, not the fantasy 
creation of the idealistic mind. You’ll eat much better.

Patron Saints
The creative world was not always this commercial. In times past, the 
role of the artistic class served different functions and often different 
audiences. While there was probably always someone who would grab 
an instrument and sing a song at the local tavern, music was often just a 
method of passing along information. Traveling minstrels went from town 
to town playing ballads that were written about the events of the times. 
Songs were also used as a way of teaching and retaining the history of a 
people.
Hundreds or thousands of years ago, we didn’t have anywhere near the 
amount of luxury time that modern society offers. Whether you were a 
farmer or tradesman, you put in long, hard days, working until the task was 
done. The idea of a nine-to-five job with its after hours and weekend lei-
sure would have been as alien a concept as an electric guitar. Both would 
probably get you burned at the stake.
In such an environment, people had little time for lofty and frivolous pur-
suits like dance, poetry, or the fine arts in general. There would be the 
occasional festival or two, but making weekend plans to catch dinner and 
a show simply wasn’t a reality of the day. Well, for the working class, any-
way. The ruling elite, on the other hand, lived by an entirely different set 
of considerations.
If you’re smart about it, you can have your cake and eat it too: You can create art for the 
masses and enjoy the benefits of commissioned works for your patron. The two aren’t mutually 
exclusive.
To begin with, rulers tended to have a lot more money than the com-
mon man. It’s why they got into the business of being a ruler in the first 
place. Among the many things that money could buy, leisure time and the 
diversions to fill it were high on the list. This led to the practice of offer-
ing patronage to the notable creatives of the day. The arrangement was 
simple and straightforward. The artist did his thing; the rich patron paid 
the bills. It was a great gig and everyone was happy with the benefits.
Obviously, only a small amount of artists were able to be supported in 
such a manner. Fortunately for the creative communities of the day, there 
were a lot less of them to go around, so the relative percentage of those 
who found patronage was much higher than it would be in today’s flooded 
environment.

17
Of course, the other thing that’s different today is that patronage now 
appears in other forms. Particularly in America, there aren’t a lot of kings 
to go around. My history teacher would be quick to point out that we 
planned it that way, but that’s of little consolation to the out-of-work art-
ists with no palace to lounge in. This doesn’t mean that patrons no longer 
exist. You just have to know where to look for them and understand how 
the rules have changed.
Nowhere is patronage more alive or better disguised than in the real-life 
world of Mad Men, slang for the high-earning Madison Avenue advertising 
executives. To those who have never worked in advertising, it’s easy to 
assume that a display ad or TV commercial exists to sell a product. In the-
ory it does, but it’s often not carried out in the way you would expect.
If I wanted to sell you a Whack-o-Matic for $19.95 so that you could rid 
yourself of all those pesky moles in the backyard, I might give you a hard-
sell list of benefits, add a little urgency so that you felt pressure to buy 
right now, and then ask for the purchase. In fact, if you’ve ever watched 
late-night TV, a great many commercials do exactly that. Were you to 
spend a lot of time throughout the day paying attention to other adver-
tisements, however, you might be surprised to find that this is the minority 
of cases.
There is another concept in advertising that’s known as brand awareness. 
The thinking is that if you’re continually exposed to a product’s logo and 
packaging, then the next time you’re out shopping, you’re going to gravi-
tate toward that brand out of instinctive familiarity.
These guys spend a lot of money on this research, and they wouldn’t take 
this approach were there not proven results. The data, however, tends to 
be statistical in nature. This is in distinct contrast to the direct cause-and-
effect relationship you can see in a late-night commercial and the number 
of calls the center gets.
A company might know that they ran an ad one thousand times in August 
and that sales increased by 11 percent. The problem is, businesses rarely 
do just one thing. There will be a number of other ways that the product 
has gotten mentioned as well. It’s more difficult to tie cause to effect. 
The old joke in the ad business is, “Half of my advertising doesn’t work. 
I just don’t know which half.”
If you’re wondering how we went from tales of kings and patrons to the 
world of slick automobile ads and animated product mascots, let’s con-
nect the dots. Simply put, most of the ads you see use way more creative 
horsepower than is needed to sell a product. You’ll see clever skits, sexy 
actors, cutting-edge graphics, and more special effects than a Hollywood 
blockbuster movie. What does all this have to do with moving the mer-
chandise? I’ll let you in on a little industry secret: nothing at all.

Chapter 1 | The Creative Mindset

Advertising agencies put out the most polished, creative, and sensational 
ads that they can convince their clients to pay for. The most notable ads 
win advertising-industry awards. And, of course, award-winning firms can 
charge higher rates. The glitzy ads the agency produces for this purpose 
are sold to the client under the banner of brand awareness. After all, 
it would be a much more difficult sale to tell you that they want to do 
some really cool stuff so that they can win an award and charge you more 
money.
So, the agency will create a really cool cutting-edge commercial. Viewers 
will be impressed with how creative and entertaining it is and might even 
talk about it in its own right. The Super Bowl commercials are the reason 
for parties as often as the game itself. And even if all people are talk-
ing about is the animated sheep bouncing up and down on a CGI pogo 
stick, they’ll see your brand on the sheep’s posterior; thus increasing your 
brand awareness. Or so the sales pitch goes.
Rather than draw up a simple and straightforward campaign to sell your 
company’s widgets, these companies put together a project that is a 
smaller-scale version of a Hollywood big-budget movie. In fact, they often 
use the same graphics and animation vendors as their motion picture 
counterparts do.
Now, think like a graphic artist, if you don’t happen to be one yourself. 
You want to play with all the latest tools, do cool new things, and get paid 
for it. Problem is, there aren’t always practical applications for that sort of 
thing. It’s difficult finding someone to pay you to just play around. Where 
do you go? Madison Avenue or its equivalent, wherever you can find it. In 
many ways, these are the modern-day patrons of the arts. Not what you’d 
expect, is it?
Of course, this isn’t the only place where patronage can be found. In many 
ways, the large media companies also serve in this capacity. Returning to 
our musician friends, let’s say you want to make a few records. Studio time 
is expensive. You can easily spend from $500,000 to $1,000,000 producing 
a record. Then, there’s the obligatory music video, which can be just as 
large and expense. Of course, you need to make a living while recording 
your timeless classic, so the record company gives you an advance (the 
industry term for an interest-free loan).
Add it all up and there’s a lot of money being invested in your record. 
Clearly, you will need to sell a heck of a lot of units just to recoup the 
expenses. The musician’s attitude? That’s someone else’s problem. The 
band gets paid and goes on tour. Maybe the record company makes a 
profit. Maybe they lose a ton of money. Either way, the creative people got 
what they wanted—a patron to pay them so they could play.

19
Most of us are familiar with stories of how media companies screw per-
forming artists, and much of that is true. As you can see, there’s also 
another side to the story. If the record sells and there’s lots of money 
coming in, maybe the label and the band will both make out. Maybe the 
band gets screwed. However, if the record doesn’t sell, the band got the 
patronage and the label got the shaft. The modern-day patron system is 
complicated and full of risk on both sides. Maybe those kings weren’t such 
a bad lot after all.
Charting a Course
Another type of opportunity that our modern society has enabled can 
be thought of as a form of micropatronage. Thanks to the power of the 
Internet and digital technologies, we can now make our case directly by 
asking our audience for their financial support.
Let’s say you’ve written a delightful play about a boy and his cybernetic 
dog and want to take it on the road. Instead of dealing with the larger 
apparatus of promoters and industry infrastructure, you can arrange the 
venues and dates yourself. To make money, you can promote your show 
directly to potential fans using the Web, e-mail, and the occasional free-
lance owl.
It’s not the same as getting a big recording contract and a gazillion-dollar 
advance from a record label with deep pockets. Instead, you have to make 
lots of little sales in the hopes that they add up to the larger number that 
you need in order to keep you, your cast, and crew on a high-quality pea-
nut butter and jelly diet. This can be exciting and may also be just what you 
need to provide creative freedom and financial stability.
In fact, there are many other business models that will allow you to make 
a living doing what you love. Some involve steady but less glamorous gigs. 
Others allow you to build a business. There are also ways to generate 
multiple streams of income from different sources. We live in a time of 
incredible opportunity for those who wish to live the creative life.
This is a time of incredible opportunity for creative people. Put in the effort to take care of 
business, and you can make a living doing what you love.
There’s only one problem. Creative creatures, by and large, don’t want to 
do anything but play with their toys and be the artist. As we’ve seen, this 
doesn’t apply to just one artistic discipline. It’s a mindset that is common 
to the entire artistic community, and probably always has been.

Chapter 1 | The Creative Mindset

Fortunately, the problem is one of attitude and effort, and these are dif-
ficulties that can be overcome by those with sufficient motivation. If there 
were simply no way for us to pay the bills beyond working for the local 
factory, life would be bleak indeed. Instead, opportunity abounds for the 
aspiring artist who isn’t afraid to stretch beyond her comfort zone and 
put in a little extra effort.
If you want to make a living doing what you love, success is within your 
reach. This is only possible, however, if you’re willing to embrace a new 
phase of your career, one in which you take responsibility for your own 
needs and chart your own course. It won’t always be easy, but the view is 
infinitely better when you’re the captain of your own ship.

This Is Business
There’s nothing like the thrill of getting paid for doing what you love. 
While most with artistic talent care first and foremost about what 
they’re creating, for many the ability to make a living or at least supple-
ment their income by doing the work they love runs a close second. And 
why shouldn’t you be paid? If your creations bring beauty and entertain-
ment into someone’s life, you’ve provided value. In fact, that’s one of the 
most fundamental principles of business. One person provides something 
worthwhile; the other person pays for it. When you look at it that way, 
the creative community is no less deserving of compensation than any 
other trade is.
You can’t create great art without understanding the basics of your 
discipline. If you tried to put on a concert before learning to play your 
instrument, you’d only succeed in looking foolish. The same rules apply 
to making a living. In order to turn your creative passion into a reliable 
source of income, it’s important to become acquainted with the world of 
business. With that in mind, let’s turn our thoughts for a moment to mar-
keting, partnerships, people skills, and yes, even taxes. We’ll leave death for 
another day. The Grim Reaper can find his own gigs.
With the exception of the purists, those altruistic and occasionally arro-
gant souls who believe that commerce somehow cheapens the art, most 
of us would agree that we have a right to be paid for our work. However, 
lest we slip into a sense of entitlement, believing that the world owes 
us something, let’s look a little more closely at the mechanics of making 
money.
No matter what your views on the relationship between artist and mer-
chant, the reality of the matter is quite simple. If money changes hands, it’s 
business. Therefore, if you want to get paid, you are by definition entering 
the business world. That doesn’t mean you have to rush right out and buy 
a three-piece suit. You just need to pull your head out of the sand, look

beyond the borders of the bohemian lifestyle, and embrace the real world. 
If you stand on the railroad tracks and close your eyes, the train will flat-
ten you just the same.
If you want to get paid for your ponderings, you are by definition going into business. Embrace 
that fact and you can build a larger audience than you ever imagined possible.
One of the first harsh truths with which you must become comfortable 
is the fact that in the business world, no one gives a rat’s rear end about 
your art. Those who can help you make money don’t care whether it’s 
innovative and cutting edge or populist and accessible. Even more shock-
ing, they don’t care if it’s critically acclaimed or absolute rubbish. What 
they do care about is how these and other aspects of your work translate 
into a paying audience. The critics can flame you and your peers may dis-
own you, but as long as someone is able to move the merchandise, you’ll 
have a friend in the world of commerce.
Fortunately, unless you’re doing really bizarre and obscure things in the 
name of art, you’ll find that, as with any other industry, quality sells. When 
dozens of your friends tell you that a movie sucks, chances are good you’ll 
give it a miss. In the same spirit, when everyone you know is raving about 
the performance of a dance troupe that’s in town this week, you’ll beg, 
borrow, or bribe your way into that show if it’s the last thing you do. In 
other words, no matter what the elitist snobs may say to the contrary, you 
don’t have to crank out garbage to make a buck. Do great work. That’s 
step one.
No matter how much blood, sweat, and tears you pour into your creativ-
ity, step one is by far the easy part. This makes your work no less impor-
tant, but we all know that talent and quality do not guarantee revenue. 
Step two is understanding enough about the business of your art form 
to translate that quality into cold, hard cash. That sort of thing tends to 
come in handy when the rent is due.
There is no magical secret that will guarantee you wealth and fame. On 
the other hand, if you’re willing to bypass magic and live with high prob-
abilities rather than guarantees, I can offer you the next best thing. It’s not 
exactly a closely guarded secret, but that doesn’t diminish its effectiveness. 
If you want a core concept around which you can build many streams of 
income, all you have to do is help other people make money. I know that 
sounds terribly simplistic, but you’ll find that many of the world’s great 
truths are equally as plain once you’ve stripped them of their glamour.

Of course, you can’t just walk randomly into the streets helping every 
stranger you meet. Actually, you can and they’ll love you for it, but it 
won’t necessarily improve your own chances of making money. For it to 
be profitable, you need to connect with the right people. They’re not 
hard to spot. In every corner of the creative world, there are promoters, 
merchants, agents, media companies, tech start-ups, and a host of others 
who make their living off of creative people like you and me.
The people who need to be helped that I just described often have a bad 
name among artists. There are countless tales of actors, dancers, painters, 
and every other species in our little universe being taken advantage of by 
the shrewd, manipulative, and unethical. In fact, this reputation for com-
panies and individuals who take advantage of the talent is often enough 
to discourage people like you from even thinking about the business side 
of things. After all, what’s the point of doing something new if you’re just 
going to get screwed anyway, right?
With that in mind, allow me to digress for just a moment. Everyone’s 
familiar with how the animal kingdom revolves around survival of the fit-
test. This principle tells us that in the world of bunnies, only the very best 
should live long enough to make future bunnies, thus ensuring a strong 
and vibrant community of fluffy, long-eared mammals. However, when a 
hungry tiger happens by and spots one, he couldn’t possibly care less 
about who should survive and who shouldn’t. He’s only interested in din-
ner. Perpetuation of the bunny clan is not his problem, nor should it be. 
He has his own species to think about.
In such a scenario, there are only two kinds of bunnies—the aware and 
the dearly departed. The responsibility for choosing a category falls to 
the individual. If you’re preoccupied with a particularly interesting little 
flower or you don’t consider tigers to be all that dangerous, there’s not 
much mystery about your fate. The bunnies that live to nibble another 
day are the ones who see danger coming and are out of town before it 
gets there.
The moral to this story—and of course any tale including bunnies and 
tigers should have a moral—is that there’s nothing wrong with being a 
tiger, only a stupid bunny. If you’re about to chastise me for overlooking 
the behavior of the unethical, I can assure you it will be a waste of time. 
I’m not in the business of passing judgment or seeking vengeance on those 
who do bad things, and neither are you. The world is neither safe nor fair 
and all the protests in the world will not change that. Let tigers be tigers 
and tend to your own little patch of clover.

It falls to you and you alone to determine who is a predator and who is 
not. If you avoid every class of creature who could make money with you 
because one of them might be a tiger, you won’t have to worry about 
being someone else’s dinner. You’ll starve to death first.
With that in mind, go back and read that last paragraph again and this time 
make note of the fact that I didn’t speak of someone making money off 
of you. I referred instead to those who could make money with you. To 
the self-aware bunny, this is a crucial consideration. When you find the 
businesspeople who populate your little slice of the arts and weed out the 
ones who seem overly predatory, what you’re left with is a collection of 
potential business partners. This is a very valuable group of people.
Don’t think of promoters, agents, distributors, and others who will help you sell your art as 
people who make money off you. Think of them as people who make money for you.
Because it’s one of the easiest situations to understand, let’s use a book-
ing agent as an example. These people work on commission. When they 
book a gig for you, they get a cut. If they don’t bring you any jobs, they 
make nothing. Percentages vary according to industry as well as how suc-
cessful an agency is, but let’s ballpark their commission at 20 percent. The 
math on this is pretty simple. Every time they bring you a job, you only 
get 80 percent of what the client paid. By the same token, each time you 
have no work because you chose not to do business with an agency, you 
get 100 percent of nothing.
The agent needs to pay her bills just like you do. If she brings you no 
work, she doesn’t eat. Among the many things that we have in common 
with agents is our love of dining on a regular basis. This is someone who 
is motivated. She’s also someone who sees you as a potential source of 
revenue.
That doesn’t make her a tigress. It makes her a potential ally. When you 
approach such a person with a value-based suggestion, you’ll get her 
immediate attention. The proposition is very simple. You need work, and 
you’ll be delighted to pay her every time she provides it. In other words, 
you’ve just introduced yourself as someone who can help her make 
money. That’s usually the beginning of a good conversation.
You also have to demonstrate that you’re a product that can be sold. If 
she wastes her time on the talentless, she’ll go hungry. You want her to 
invest her time and energy to find you work, and you don’t have to pay 
her anything up front for her efforts. With that in mind, it’s not at all unfair 
that she would want to see some tangible assurances that you’re a good 

Have Fun, Get Paid
25
investment of her time. Demonstrate that, and you’ll become fast friends 
and both of you will make money in the process.
Of course, self-preservation is always important. How do you know if 
she’s a predator or not? The easiest way is to look at how she’s treated 
people in the past. For better or worse, whatever she did to others, she’ll 
do to you. As we all know, tigers rarely change their stripes.
With that in mind, you should be on the lookout for the types of busi-
nesses and individuals who can profit by helping you make money. For 
each of these types, the next step is to perform due diligence to assure 
yourself as much as is possible that you’re not dealing with someone 
who’s going to leave you twisting in the breeze.
Having narrowed down your candidates to the most promising, you then 
have to look at things from the agent’s point of view and be prepared to 
demonstrate how a relationship with you will make him money. Following 
these steps won’t guarantee that you’ll become a wealthy and widely cel-
ebrated entertainer. It will, however, put you on the path to making a 
decent and steady living with your art.
You’ll find more on agents and other representatives in chapter 10, “Paying the Bills.”
Death and Taxes
As we’ve already seen, if money changes hands, you’re doing business. I 
live in America and can’t speak to the details of other nations, but I can, 
without a doubt, guarantee you that where there’s a government, there’s 
taxation. If you’re engaged in commerce, then sooner or later, the tax man 
cometh.
I can assure you that in matters of taxes more than any other, aversion 
will not be an effective strategy. If you think it’s a hassle having less money 
because you had to give up a percentage of it to the authorities, that 
discomfort pales in comparison to the joys you’ll experience if you try 
to avoid, through negligence or outright deceit, the filing or payment of 
what’s due.
You have two, and only two, choices. Encounter a little discomfort today 
by taking care of business or experience a great deal of unpleasantness 
later when the long arm of the law wraps its bony little fingers around 
your bank account, with interest and penalties far exceeding the original 
amount.

Chapter 2 | This Is Business

I’m hoping this entire conversation makes you twitch. I truly want to press 
home the importance of being responsible in this area. If the road to 
fame and fortune is littered with broken dreams, many of those wounds 
are self-inflected. That’s both unfortunate and avoidable. If you’re smart 
enough to read, you’re smart enough to avoid such unnecessary complica-
tions in your otherwise idyllic life.
When you work for someone as an employee, at least in my country, the 
taxes are withheld from your paycheck. If that’s the way you make your 
living, life is pretty easy. Do the paperwork at the end of the year and you 
might even get a refund. Making a living in the creative arts, however, is 
often an entrepreneurial adventure. Whether you’re running a company 
such as a graphic design firm or simply doing freelance work on a gig-
to-gig basis as an actor might, you have no such luxury. You get paid the 
entire amount, and it’s up to you to stash money away for paying taxes at 
the end of the year.
If you’re a self-employed artist of any kind, no one is withholding taxes from your paychecks 
(except in certain rare circumstances). Plan to put aside money every month to ensure you have 
enough to pay estimated taxes quarterly or the full amount at the end of the year.
In terms of financial disasters, not putting away money is probably the 
most common trap that you can fall into. Life in the arts is often a hand-
to-mouth existence. Your focus, therefore, tends to be on paying the rent 
each month, not what you’ll do about your taxes eleven months from 
now. If things are tight, it will be very tempting to spend everything you 
receive. From a perfectly logical point of view, if you’re that tight for the 
money to pay one month’s rent today, what do you think the chances are 
that money will fall from the heavens to pay an entire year’s worth of 
taxes when they come due?
While it’s not technically correct and varies based on your income, depen-
dents, legitimate business expenses, and so forth, one easy way to keep track 
of things is to memorize the following phrase: “Every dollar is fifty cents.” 
That’s all you get to spend today and not a penny more. The other half goes 
into a savings account wired to ten thousand volts of electrical current that 
will fry you in a heartbeat if you try to access it before tax time.
When the end of the year rolls around and you do the required paper-
work, you’ll probably find that the money you saved exceeds the taxes 
you owe. At this point, you can open a second savings account for the 
excess. That’s your emergency fund. You’re going to need one in this line 
of work, so this provides you with a method of building one and covering 
your posterior with the government at the same time.

27
Most of us have to look at our expenses and the realistic potential for 
income and decide whether or not our pursuits will be a full-time or 
part-time venture. When you make this assessment and are calculating 
how much money you can bring in this year, remember, every dollar is 
fifty cents. Plan based on that and you’ll be on solid footing both for the 
monthly bills and the annual governmental gala.
All of this requires discipline, a personality trait not commonly associated 
with people such as ourselves. However, no matter what type of talent 
you possess, you had to put in a lot of hours to get good enough at it for 
others to enjoy. This means you actually do possess a fair degree of self-
discipline when it’s important enough to you.
If you’re just starting out in your field, you’re going to have to trust me on 
this or talk to others who have been down the road before you. Money 
management and taking care of your financial obligations is something that 
is very, very important to you. Should you not be willing to take anyone’s 
word on this I can assure you that you’ll learn it the hard way. Given that I 
learned most of what I know from the school of hard knocks, I have a row 
of battle scars that attest to this fact.
Marketing Mischief
One of the cornerstones of any business, and a term sure to strike fear 
in the hearts of creative creatures everywhere, is marketing. This practice 
has a reputation for being sleazy, scary, difficult, or all of the above. It is 
without a doubt the single most dreaded task that any artistic person 
has to face. In fact, many will go to great lengths to avoid coming nose to 
nose with it. Of course, these are the very same people who wonder why 
they’re having a difficult time paying the bills with their art.
No matter what your product or service, and regardless how great you 
think it is, when you’re trying to make a living, nothing happens until a 
sale is made. That sale can be someone telling you that you passed the 
audition or a fan of your show buying a t-shirt online. Either way, before 
money can change hands, your customer has to be sold.
When most people think of sales, what comes to mind is those terribly 
obnoxious late-night TV commercials that scream at you and seem to be 
permanently bonded to the price of $19.95. Running a very close second 
is the local used-car salesman, with his cheesy dialogue, plaid jacket, and 
all. If that’s what it took to make a sale, I’d hide under a rock and never go 
near the entrepreneurial realm again. Fortunately, that’s not the case.

Chapter 2 | This Is Business
28
Sales happen all the time in much more benevolent climates. Think about 
your favorite restaurant, the one you go to when you have a few extra bucks 
and really want to treat yourself. The food isn’t free. When it’s all said and 
done and the last crumpled napkin is laid on the table, your server walks 
over and hands you the check. Not only do you pay, you may well hum a 
happy, contented little tune while doing so. And yet, a sale was made.
As another example. Let’s say that a new book comes out by your favor-
ite author. Perhaps it’s a light-hearted romp through the woods with a 
herd of vampires, two zombies, and the occasional chainsaw. It’s unlikely 
that the writer paid for a late-night commercial to beat you into sub-
mission. Far more likely are the chances that you read a previous book, 
enjoyed it, and have been following that author on the Web waiting for 
the announcement of a new title. No one pressured you to buy the book. 
Chainsaws were indeed involved, but none of them were aimed at you. 
You were probably not only happy to spend the money, but you’d also 
been anxiously awaiting the opportunity to part with your hard-earned 
cash. And yet, a sale was made.
Zombies, napkins, and the occasional gas-powered hedge trimmer aside, 
these two examples share a very important common thread. Before the 
sale could be made in either of these enterprises, you had to know about 
what was being offered. That’s the short definition of marketing. Doesn’t 
sound nearly so scary now, does it?
If you’re going to get paid for your work, someone, somehow, has to make 
the sale. If you’re a sculptor, you may sell a piece directly to a customer. If 
you’re a fashion designer, there may be a chain of purchases and sales that 
happen between the time of your idea, the manufacturer, the wholesale 
distributor, the retailer, and the ultimate consumer. However it works, 
somewhere down the line, a person coughs up some money and some or 
all of it makes its way into your pocket.
Either you make the sale or someone makes it for you. The choice of sce-
narios may be dictated in part by how your particular art works. As often 
as not, it also has a great deal to do with how comfortable you are taking 
the reins and handling the process personally. As with everything else in 
business, there is no one right answer. In the end, it’s all about trade-offs 
and which are best for you.
Let’s say you don’t want to have anything to do with sales and market-
ing. You just want to do your thing and have someone hand you a check. 
Nice work if you can get it. However, while you’ve relieved yourself of 
the burden that is marketing, you’ve paid for that luxury by giving up con-
trol. When you trust someone else, particularly where money is involved, 
you’re vulnerable.

Have Fun, Get Paid
29
Is the person to whom you’ve entrusted your marketing honest and ethi-
cal in their dealings? Even if she is, how dependable is she? If you put 
someone in charge of booking your band but she never gets around to 
visiting the local bars, you don’t eat. It’s also common knowledge that 
money can alter someone’s behavior. A person whom you once trusted 
with a key to your house now suddenly avoids your phone calls when 
you’re trying to get paid for that last gig she collected on.
The world is full of good, hard-working, dependable people. All rumors 
to the contrary, a great many of them work in marketing. You may very 
well find someone you can trust who will be diligent in bringing home the 
bacon and putting it in your pocket. Nonetheless, if this is the path you 
choose, it’s important to be aware of your vulnerabilities so that you can 
keep an eye on things and pull the plug early if it all goes south on you.
When you hand over the marketing of your art to another person, you give up control. This 
leaves you completely dependent on the integrity, work ethic, and goodwill of somebody else, 
who will, even under the best of circumstances, focus on her own self-interest. Know the risk 
before taking the leap.
The other option is to handle the marketing yourself. This can be as 
simple as reading the trade publications and going out to auditions for any 
dance company you think you have a shot at. It will be up to you to keep 
tabs on the appropriate notices, ask around and network with friends, and 
do everything else necessary to keep your ear to the ground. When you 
see an opportunity, you will need to make the contact and arrange the 
audition. That’s marketing.
You can also be more proactive about it. In addition to waiting for the 
right kind of company to post auditions, let’s say that you’ve been a dancer 
for quite some time and have even done a bit of teaching. Having expertise 
to share in your particular style, you can start writing a regular blog and 
even do some video tutorials. You’ll need to be active on social media and 
when contacted by people with questions, you should always take time to 
help them as best you can.
Over time, your reputation will grow and a great many people will know 
of you. When the day comes that your favorite company has an opening, 
rather than hold auditions, they’ll first pick up the phone and call you to 
see if you’re interested because they’ve heard so much about you. After 
a pleasant conversation and dropping by to spend some time with them, 
you will ultimately get the gig. You didn’t cold call people or make an 
annoyance of yourself in any way. Quite the contrary, you established 

Chapter 2 | This Is Business
30
yourself as someone who possesses not only talent but a pleasing disposi-
tion. That’s marketing.
We’ll be delving into the world of sales and marketing in greater detail 
a little later on, but these illustrations give you an idea of your options. 
No matter which approach you choose, you’ll get results. All that’s left is  
to consider the benefits and trade-offs and determine what works best 
for you.
People Skills
I intentionally covered sales and marketing first to get the uncomfort-
able stuff out of the way. People expect to see those words in a business 
book. They also tend to have preconceived notions about how good or 
evil these areas are. To a very large degree, though, there is a common 
umbrella that they fall under that is much more comfortable for the artis-
tic mindset. When you get right down to it, getting noticed and turning 
that attention into a transaction isn’t about sales or marketing. Your abil-
ity to make money and further your career is all about people.
One group of people you encounter is the collection of kindred spirits 
you collaborate with when creating your art. A novelist may work in soli-
tude while cranking out the first draft, but ultimately she’ll interact with 
editors, copy editors, illustrators, indexers, compositors, and perhaps a 
few others. Together, they’ll transform the author’s words into a polished, 
finished product that can be sold, sometimes known as a book.
If you play in a band, this collection of coconspirators is a familiar sight, 
including not just the other singers and instrumentalists but also the crew 
who set up the stage, mix the sound, and run the lights. Whether it’s sepa-
rate people for each job or a few people wearing multiple hats, before the 
show can go on, these are people you need.
No matter what kind of work you create, you want to get people talking 
about you, preferably with nice things to say. This can start from your fans 
and general word of mouth and go all the way up to hosts of network 
TV shows and other such celebrities. Whether it’s the Web, major media 
outlets, or just word on the street, before anyone will show up to see 
what you do, you need such a group behind you.
If all goes well and you’ve managed to get your act together without 
throwing the drummer out the back of a moving van, word will spread and 
people will come to your show. This is an extremely important group of 
people to establish, as one might imagine. Even if you sell pottery at flea 
markets, the people who come by your table are the reason you went to 

Have Fun, Get Paid
31
all the effort of creating something in the first place. They are the con-
sumers of your craft, those people you hope to turn into devoted fans.
That might seem like the end of the story, and in some cases, such as that 
of our master of clay, it could very well be. There is, however, one more 
group without whom you will not be able to pay the light bill. These are 
the people who can actually make you money.
In the case of an artisan selling his wares at festivals and outdoor markets, 
the consumers of the work are also the people who can make you money. 
In this case, we’ll allow them to wear two hats, mostly because it looks 
really cool in the group photo. They are not the only kinds of people you 
will need in order to prosper, however, even in the case of the potter.
There are lots of open-air markets that take place anytime the sun is 
willing to peek out from behind the clouds. If you exhibit at one and have 
quality art, you’ll probably make some money. Because of that, the sup-
ply of artists often far exceeds the space available. Even you live in some 
transdimensional galaxy where the normal laws of physics don’t apply, you 
still typically need someone’s permission to attend. That person is also 
one who can make you money.
In some arts, the money comes from more abstract places, such as a 
concert promoter who pays the band a fixed fee, sells the tickets, and 
then prays that he brings in more than he spent. The famous Woodstock 
festival of the 1960s was actually supposed to be a paid concert. However, 
when half a million stoned hippies crashed the gates in an ever so peaceful 
manner, eventually they had to just bow to the inevitable and call it a 
cultural event. What you might also call it is a promoter losing his shorts 
on the deal.
Regardless of how it works out for the promoter, he’s a person who can 
make you money. An agent also fits this description. Even though she only 
booked you at the bar and the club owner is the one who will pay you, it’s 
the agent who made that payment possible. Independent filmmakers also 
deal with such abstractions and typically work with producers, financiers, 
and other sources of revenue, hopefully with enough left over to get paid 
once the cost of the film has finished depleting the bank account. Should 
that payday actually arrive, all of these people were necessary since they 
were the ones who brought in the money.
You now have a roomful of people, each performing a vital function to 
your career and none of whom you can safely do without. Previously, we 
were considering the topic of sales and marketing. To many, those are skill 
sets that seem alien or at the very least uncomfortable. After reviewing 
our four critical groups, however, you may be seeing how this all comes 
together. Hopefully, you’re also beginning to realize that you don’t have to 

Chapter 2 | This Is Business
32
have a mercenary mindset to make a buck. In fact, over the long haul, that 
sort of attitude hurts you. People remember, and people talk.
The book I wrote before this one, Unite the Tribes, explores the princi-
ples necessary for building a successful organization. One of the chapters 
speaks directly to promoting your personal agenda, whether that involves 
getting the lead role in a play or selling out a fifty thousand seat stadium. 
It’s simply titled “Persuasion,” but it’s the subtitle that’s particularly rel-
evant to our current discussion: “Never Forget That You’re Dealing with 
People.”
This brings us to a central point when it comes to making a living with 
your art. As you can see, your success depends on people. It’s not a 
matter of which group you need. You need them all. But then, so does 
everyone else, including your competitors. Of course, if you’re a singer in a 
Broadway production, you might not think about the other shows as com-
petition, but that’s exactly what they are. Your audience has only so much 
disposable income. Who they choose to spend it with is up for grabs.
In all aspects of your career and business, never forget you are dealing with people who need 
to be educated, persuaded, influenced, and cajoled in varying degrees. Good people skills can 
turn others into your biggest boosters and take your business to new heights.
As I detailed in the chapter on persuasion in Unite the Tribes, the key to 
success is understanding human nature and possessing good people skills. 
If you want to abuse people and beat them over the head until you get 
what you want, you’ll succeed in a tiny percentage of cases, only to guar-
antee that the vast majority will want nothing to do with you. I didn’t call 
the chapter “Manipulation” or even “How to Lie, Cheat, and Steal.” Both 
of these accurately describe the sales tactics of the ethically challenged, 
but morality aside, that’s simply not good long-term thinking. You’ll be 
creative for the rest of your life, so it’s good to think about the future.
When you want people to do something for you, you ask. If they’re not inclined 
to say yes and you feel you’ve made a reasonable request, you make your case 
as eloquently as possible. That’s persuasion. They may still say no in the end.  
A certain percentage always will. What’s important is how you go about it.  
If you understand people, believe in treating them well, and can articulate 
both what you want and why it would be in their interest to do so, people 
will respond. You’ll gain the support of the four groups you need and you’ll 
generate no ill will in the process. In fact, you’ll end up making friends. 
Doesn’t that sound a lot more pleasant than sales and marketing?

Opportunities
The topics of marketing and finding the work are both pivotal to your abil-
ity to make a living as a creative creature, so I’ve devoted an entire chapter 
to each a little further on. However, as a preview of coming attractions, 
and more importantly to round out our overview of the business aspects 
of your art, let’s take a brief tour of the types of opportunities that are 
most common. As with everything we cover, some of these will relate 
directly to your art and others may serve as examples that you can map 
to your own world.
Being Discovered
If you’ve ever seen a movie about someone who dreamed of being a star, 
chances are good that much of the hopes and dreams of our hero rested 
on being discovered. While the specifics of that phrase vary a bit from 
industry to industry, what it generally implies is good fortune falling in 
your lap by way of someone seeing your talent and hooking you up with 
someone else who can give you a lucrative contract.
If that sounds like a fantasy worthy of a good movie, you’re not far from 
the truth. Yes, there is such a thing as a talent scout. In the music business, 
they’re known as A&R people (artist & repertoire). Regardless of your art, 
you have about as good a chance of being hit by a piece of space debris 
that reentered Earth’s atmosphere and managed to avoid being burnt to a 
crisp as you have of being plucked out of that dive bar you’re playing and 
swept away in a limousine.
The chances of this magic happening are further diminished by the ever-
­contracting fortunes of those industries most likely to be searching for 
talent in this way. The Internet has wreaked havoc with the recording, 
movie, and publishing industries. There may be talent scouts roaming the 
country, but they’re probably spending most of their time scavenging for 
fire extinguishers to douse the ashes of a once-thriving industry.
Discouraging? Sorry. I realize it’s unpopular to dash someone’s hopes and 
dreams, but I’d much rather see you take a path that has a realistic chance 
of keeping you fed.
Venues
While the digital media industry is busy searching antique bookstores 
for any ancient reference on how a firebird actually rose from the ashes, 
another form has survived admirably. If you’re a member of the perform-
ing arts, physical venues could be your bread and butter.

Chapter 2 | This Is Business
34
Your audience can hold up a cell phone and record your entire perfor-
mance, and there’s really not much you can do about it. Nor can you keep 
them from posting it on every Web site on the planet. Even so, it just 
doesn’t matter.
There is simply no substitute for being there in person, in the moment, 
part of the crowd who experiences a once-in-a-lifetime event. No two 
performances are ever identical, and the group energy, for lack of a more 
scientific term, cannot be replicated by a computer.
Across the world, there are countless theaters, bars, symphony halls, festi-
vals, conferences, and coffeehouses. That doesn’t even scratch the surface 
of the venues available and the creative promoter can probably come up 
with a few more on the fly.
This is obviously a solid opportunity for the performing artist, but it is in no 
way limited to that art form. As an author, I do my work through a word 
processor. However, I also speak at conferences and other venues, includ-
ing modest meeting rooms and the auditoriums of major corporations. 
Programmers, graphic artists, and Web designers do the same thing. Poets 
do readings at coffeehouses. Novelists sign books at stores. Sculptors give 
seminars and filmmakers speak at universities. The versatility of the physi-
cal venue is impressive indeed.
Merchants and Merchandising
When we think of merchants, it brings to mind colorful local markets in 
Third World countries or massive supermarkets selling everything from 
ant farms to zebra pillows. For the physical artisan, selling their wares may 
very well take place in such a context. As with venues, however, it only 
scratches the surface of the potential.
Similar to stores, galleries and exhibits also provide opportunities for paint-
ers, sculptors, and other such creative professions. They can range from 
the glamorous to the humble, but at either end of the spectrum you’re 
exposing your work to an appreciative audience. They may purchase one 
of your pieces or even commission you to do something just for them. 
As a networking opportunity, this could extend even further, such as a 
chance to handle all interior design and art for a national chain of upscale 
restaurants.
If you happen to be in a more digital world, you’ll be looking for additional 
streams of revenue. More and more, people seem resistant to the idea of 
paying for intellectual property. As an example, filmmakers have depended 
a great deal on the sale of DVDs since the chances of getting shown in 
a large number of cinemas is only slightly better than a singer being dis-
covered in a biker bar somewhere south of Peoria, Illinois. With piracy

rampant and paying consumers moving toward digital streaming, those 
who make movies need to find other ways to bring in revenue.
The sale of licensed merchandise is one such way to generate more money, 
which works not just for movies but also for bands, dance troupes, and 
pretty much any creative who can build a following. T-shirts, ball caps, 
directors’ chairs, beer coolers, you name it. If it can be branded with your 
group or creation, you can make money selling it.
It’s typically difficult to get your product on the shelves of the large retail 
outlets. On the other hand, flea markets, festivals, software user groups, 
and many other such places provide a lower barrier to entry. There’s also 
the time-honored tradition of selling your merchandise at your perform-
ing venue.
Of course, the same digital technology that’s caused so much financial 
heartache to the entertainment industry is also exceptionally empower-
ing to the common man. In an age when people are accustomed to buying 
things online, you can get by with something as simple as a Web site and 
a credit-card processing account. There are also large online retailers as 
well as another breed of useful creatures who will allow you to design 
products and then print them up one at a time, as the order comes in.
The world of merchandise is another of the great hopes for the average 
artist. It’s also a growth area, so the opportunities we see today will only 
improve over time.
Selling branded items, from hats to coolers, is a great way to bring in extra dollars. It also 
increases awareness for your band, theater group, or other creative ventures. Businesses 
pay advertising agencies millions of dollars annually to create branding campaigns because 
it works.
Advertising
As mentioned earlier, the advertising community offers artists, animators, 
musicians, and many other audio/visual creatives a way to make a regular 
paycheck and receive such unheard of benefits as health coverage and 
paid time off. For some, this stability will be very appealing, but it’s cer-
tainly not the only way to use advertising for fun and profit.
A variation on the theme is to work as a freelance creative who does con-
tract work for agencies. Alternatively, you can set up shop, find clients, and 
do the work and billing yourself. It’s higher risk than a nine-to-five job, but it 
offers more creative freedom as well as the chance to make better money.

36
You can also reverse the equation and put advertising to work for you. 
For producers of movies, TV shows, and Web series, it’s becoming more 
common for the content to be posted online with embedded ads as a 
means of support. The advertising rates on the Web are a tiny fraction of 
what the cable and TV industry pays, but money is money.
For software developers, mobile apps are another area where advertis-
ing support is commonplace. Many apps offer two versions, one that’s 
ad supported but free to download, and the other a paid version that, at 
minimum, offers an ad-free experience. So, even in their absence, ads are 
trying hard to help you make a buck.
The merchandise we previously discussed can also benefit from advertis-
ing. This can range from traditional display or video ads to something as 
simple as an ad-words campaign on an Internet search engine.
For movie and television series producers, product placement is another 
form of advertising revenue. Imagine a scene where people are drinking 
beer, eating potato chips, and watching a ball game. If you wrapped the 
beer and chips in plain-white wrappers to avoid trademark infringement, 
you’d miss out on all that legal fun, but you’d also have a very unrealistic 
looking TV show.
Many manufacturers will pay a fee and give you permission to use their 
wares on your show. It gets the product in front of the audience in a 
subtle and real-world manner and as such is appealing to many with an 
advertising budget.
You can also get backing for a performance, gallery showing, or other such 
affair by having a corporation sponsor your event. This is commonplace 
and typically involves hanging the company’s banners and doing other 
things to make them visible. It’s a way for companies to support the arts, 
generate some goodwill, and do a little advertising all at the same time. 
Everybody wins.
Corporate Gigs
Speaking of corporations, ad agencies aren’t the only ones who offer you 
a shot at a normal life while allowing you to pursue your art. Corporate 
gigs are also a major source of work for the tech industry. Software devel-
opers who don’t want to take the risk of developing and marketing their 
own products can get steady, good paying gigs working for companies as 
a regular employee. In fact, this is probably the most common source of 
employment for programmers.

Have Fun, Get Paid
37
An alternative approach is working through recruiting companies. These 
organizations scout out the gigs by sending reps out to potential clients 
and then filling those positions at an hourly rate, much like an employment 
agency. The client pays the recruiting company and the recruiters pay the 
developers, taking a cut off the top for their efforts in the same way that 
a booking agent works on commission.
A third option is straight-up freelance work, similar to what we’ve cov-
ered already. This involves doing your own marketing and billing, offers 
less security but of course more freedom, and allows you to earn 100 
percent of the revenue. Well, you know, after giving a cut to your favorite 
tax man.
A popular source of revenue for programmers, corporate gigs also exist 
for many of the other arts. Graphic designers, animators, special-effects 
gurus, video producers, and many other such talents are needed on a 
regular basis in the corporate world. While a company may farm out 
its advertising creative work to an agency, there are still a great deal of 
sales and marketing materials to be produced. There’s also a demand for 
internal-training materials and a host of other multimedia needs for the 
modern-day company.
Writers can get in on the action as well. In a programming shop, there’s 
often a need for technical documentation. Tech writers work both as 
employees and on a freelance basis, either individually or through the 
same recruiters that programmers enjoy.
If the structure and detail of tech writing isn’t gratifying to you, you can 
also pursue a gig within the corporate communications department. 
This can entail everything from writing mind-numbing HR statements to 
engaging newsletters, marketing materials, press releases, and other such 
propaganda.
Teaching
An opportunity that applies to every single art form, teaching is a well-
­established way to generate primary or secondary income. The joke 
among working-class musicians who frequent smoky bars and tend to 
turn equipment up to eleven is that you don’t go to college to learn how 
to play guitar. You go so that you can get a teaching gig when the work 
is slow.
Academia has the most stringent entry requirements, whether you’re 
teaching grade school or at a university. The pay is less than other options, 
but the benefits are excellent, and with universities, the chance to get a 
tenured position and its implied job security are of great value to many.

38
On the other end of the spectrum is the individual instructor or tutor. A 
good example of this type of work is the person who gives your daughter 
piano lessons or teaches your son how to improve his trumpet playing. 
Sometimes you’ll go to the student’s home. Other times you’ll partner 
with a local music store, typically the kind who sells band instruments, and 
hold lessons on the premises.
Private lessons are not limited to the musically inclined, of course. Dance 
instructors join the ranks of painters, potters, sculptors, drama coaches, 
and a host of other disciplines. If you’re an artist, there’s always room to 
improve. One of the best ways is by getting one-on-one instruction from 
someone who’s been down the road before you.
Sometimes teaching blossoms into a business enterprise all its own. There 
are probably very few cities in America that don’t have at least one dance 
school. There are also small businesses that teach drawing and painting 
and pretty much every other art. It takes someone with both creative and 
entrepreneurial skills, and the risk is much higher. So, too, of course, is the 
potential for reward.
You want to make a living doing what you love? Consider teaching. It pays the bills, and gives 
you the freedom to pursue your art on your own terms. It also offers its own special joys. There’s 
nothing quite so rewarding as passing along your love of an art form to another person.
Somewhere in between the private tutor and the small businessperson 
lies the arena of seminars. If you can put together a high-value learning 
experience that you can deliver in a day or two, people will pay you for 
the privilege of sitting in. It is another high-risk, high-reward scenario. One 
of the ongoing challenges of this type of teaching is finding an appropriate 
venue to conduct them in. Hotel ballrooms are common but expensive 
choices.
Alternatively, you can partner with a dance school or its equivalent in 
your discipline. It provides the venue, and often is an excellent source of 
attendees. You deliver the seminar and split the revenue between you. 
The risk is slightly lower in this type of arrangement because the school 
has the venue whether it’s filled or not, whereas the hotel requires pay-
ment whether one or a hundred people show up.
Speaking
A variation on this theme is public speaking. If you can deliver a talk that 
educates your audience, you can land gigs at conferences and corporate 
events.

Have Fun, Get Paid
39
You can also find work as a straight-up entertainer doing the after-dinner 
circuit. In this case, your audience need not be artists at all, let alone in the 
same discipline as you. If you can tell entertaining, uplifting, or motivating 
stories that keep the audience engaged, your particular expertise serves 
only as a launching point for your stories.
Of course, if you’re able to offer the best of both worlds, it naturally deliv-
ers the highest value to your audience and makes you more in demand 
as a speaker. I’ve seen plenty of people recite facts and figures that were 
completely accurate but, well, less than inspiring. On the other hand, if 
entertainment is all you do, you’ll find that it’s very hard to be funny on 
demand, as those who do stand-up comedy can readily attest to.
Like many others, I’ve spent years on stage entertaining the crowd, in my 
case singing in bands and dodging the occasional airborne tequila bottle. 
Consequently, I like to combine information and entertainment, so my 
personal approach is to deliver down-to-earth ideas that the audience can 
use coupled with a degree of lighthearted fun.
In either case, the most important thing when choosing a path for speak-
ing is to go with what comes naturally to you. As with any other perform-
ing art, a forced presentation is always apparent while the person who’s at 
ease in her environment will naturally connect with the crowd.
Perspective
For all the ground we’ve covered, perhaps the single most important con-
sideration is how you look at your career. If you want to get paid for doing 
the things you enjoy in life, you have to rise above the mindset of the 
artist. To make money, you have to understand that this is business and 
embrace that concept with unbridled enthusiasm.
It would be great if you could just sit in the corner and do your thing. 
That’s an option you may in fact choose to pursue, but it usually involves 
marrying someone willing to support you and let you play. While such 
relationships certainly exist, when the kids arrive life gets more compli-
cated and the carefree days of the patronized artist dwindle. More impor-
tantly, if you’re just using someone to get a free ride, society has some 
rather unflattering words for you.
Short of finding a convenient king or half-drunk millionaire to serve as 
your patron and provide you a lavish and carefree existence, if you want 
to make a career of your art instead of slinging burgers during the day and 
searching for gigs on the weekends, you’re going to have to work for it. 
The good news is that regardless of the artistic discipline, there is a wealth 
of opportunity available to all who are willing to put forth the effort. And 
that’s a really good thing when dinnertime rolls around. A person can take 
only so many cheeseburgers.

Becoming  
Self-Sufficient
For those who immerse themselves in the creative arts with hopes of 
doing it for a living, life can be full of twists and turns. If you happened to 
notice that signpost up ahead, you also know that the real world can often 
be surreal. It’s certainly not always fair. Even so, we dream, we create, and 
we look for ways to keep the wolves at bay without losing sight of the 
muse. It is not a journey for the faint of heart.
Then, there’s that moment in the spotlight. After hours on the road, bad 
diners, worse motels, and hangovers the size of Texas, you stumble onto 
the stage, blink twice and suddenly come alive. Everything else falls away 
as you remember why you chose this path. Whether your stage is real or 
figurative, it makes the journey worthwhile.
Eventually, however, you step out of the limelight and back into your 
everyday life, already in progress. There’s food to buy, bills to pay, and 
the knowledge that even if you work on the road, you’re eventually going 
to want a roof over your head when you get home. All of this requires 
money.
In a perfect world, you would present your work, the people who enjoy 
such things would show up, and adequate funds would magically appear 
in your checking account. It doesn’t take an MBA to see the holes in this 
scenario. There are many levers to pull between the creation of your art 
and a check clearing the bank. That means countless opportunities for 
things to go wrong, leaving nothing but insufficient funds and unpopular 
excuses when the rent comes due.

C H A P T E R 

Chapter 3 | Becoming Self-Sufficient 
42
One of the most fundamental issues you will face throughout your career 
revolves around who pulls those levers. There are certainly plenty of 
people in your particular industry who are less than competent in that 
regard. Some of them might even come through on a regular basis. That 
doesn’t change the fact that more than any other business, the perform-
ing arts suffers from a high degree of flakiness and deceit. You can either 
see this coming ahead of time and be prepared for it or learn it the hard 
way. Because I have a fairly large collection of battle scars just below the 
waterline, I heartily suggest the former.
Although it’s rarely possible to do every single thing yourself, you can to a 
very large degree become self-sufficient if you’re willing to face some hard 
truths and put forth the effort. The reward is a career path that you can 
count on rather than trusting your fate to the winds. And trust me, in this 
line of work you’re going to meet a lot of blowhards.
Choose Your Discomfort
Since a perfect world doesn’t appear to be forthcoming anytime soon, 
what it really comes down to is which particular batch of uncomfortable 
experiences you’re most willing to tolerate. I read a quote attributed to 
Napoleon once saying that the first quality of a soldier was not to fight 
but to endure. That’s certainly something that those of us in the world of 
creativity can relate to. Suffering for one’s art is a concept as old as art 
itself. Consequently, we’re perfectly capable of choosing a direction and 
dealing with the difficulties that may arise.
There’s a myth that circulates among the more conservative types sug-
gesting that those of the artistic persuasion are lazy. I can see how they 
might acquire that misconception since most of us bolt for the exits when 
someone wants us to work a day job. However, that doesn’t mean we’re 
unwilling to put forth concerted effort. It’s more about what causes we 
feel are worth our time and toil. Slogging through the days of a nine-to-
five factory job isn’t going to bring out our best. On the other hand, how 
many times have you gone one or two days without sleep because you 
were immersed in one of your projects?
Earlier, I mentioned hard truths. Chief among these is the fact that the 
most successful artists are those who are willing and able to take care 
of business, whether they enjoy it or not. In fact, in a world that often 
rewards mediocre talent over creative brilliance, it’s often the deciding 
factor. If you have both talent and tenacity, you’re extremely well posi-
tioned in your field. Learning what to do is easy. Making yourself do it is 
the hard part, and that’s where a great many otherwise gifted people fail. 
So, you have to ask yourself a very blunt question and expect an equally 
unvarnished reply: how badly do you want to achieve your goals?

Have Fun, Get Paid
43
The truly successful artists know how to take care of business, even if they’re not wild about that 
aspect of the career. Do you want to achieve your goals? Then become involved, intimately, with 
the nuts and bolts of creating and sustaining a business.
With that in mind, let’s take a look at the two major paths of career man-
agement, acknowledging the good and the bad of each. From there, you 
can make your own choice based on the relative merits.
Our first contestant is the road most travelled. This type really just wants 
to sit back and do fun stuff and would prefer not to have to deal with any 
of that yucky business stuff. This is a perfectly acceptable choice as long 
as you know what you’re getting into. On the plus side, you can dedicate 
your entire being to the pursuits that you so love. You can be nothing but 
an artist and will never have to work outside your comfort zone.
The most effective way to employ this path is to have a regular job that 
pays your bills and allows you not to depend on your art for money. 
When you work and get paid, it’s a bonus and you can use it for fun since 
your daily needs are already met. That’s another plus, because having a day 
gig removes the stress and financial pressure from your creative endeav-
ors. You’ll enjoy creating more, the income will be purely recreational, and 
you won’t have to do anything you don’t want to do.
The trade-offs for this choice begin with having to work a traditional job 
in order to pay your bills. If you seek to work full time as an artist, that 
would be a nonstarter. However, you don’t have to have a day gig. You can 
trust your income to others, such as agents and promoters, and build up 
to full-time income in that manner. Handing off the responsibility of finding 
work to someone else can be appealing, but you also relinquish control 
over your career and introduce a greater degree of financial instability 
into your life.
That last bit might seem counterintuitive and thus deserves an explana-
tion. After all, if you don’t feel comfortable booking gigs and instead give 
the task over to an agent, why would doing so add up to more instability 
instead of less? The problem lies in motivation.
An agent, no matter how smooth talking he may be, has one and only one 
loyalty—his bank account. If you look like a good opportunity for income, 
you’ll get a lot of attention. If others in the stable look more promising, 
you could get pushed to the back of the room and receive little to no 
attention at all.
Furthermore—and this is something that many new people don’t think 
about when dealing with them—agencies usually want an exclusive con-
tract. That means that for the duration of the contract, however many 

Chapter 3 | Becoming Self-Sufficient 
44
years that may be, you’re stuck. If your agent books no gigs for you at all, 
you don’t work because you’re not allowed to hire someone else to find 
them for you either. You do have the option of booking them yourself, but 
you’ll have to pay him a commission on every job you acquire even though 
the agent did nothing. It’s just the nature of the business. The irony in this 
scenario is the fact that you chose this route because you didn’t want to 
do the booking in the first place.
If you’re not in the performing arts, you may not need an agent, but this 
serves to illustrate the first and most important problem. No one cares 
as much about getting you work as you do. Therefore, it’s difficult to 
find people that you can truly count on. You make an arrangement and 
duties are assigned, but frequently the person you hired just doesn’t fol-
low through. This is true of humanity in general, but in the “I’d rather 
party than work” atmosphere of the arts, it’s even more pronounced.
The other problem that you have with this path is trust. The only way you 
can be guaranteed that you’ll be paid for work is if you collect the money 
yourself. Those who have had the pleasure know that even then it’s not 
assured, as the promoter may give you excuses instead of cash at the end 
of the evening. When there is a chain of people between the client who 
pays for the service and the artist who should be paid, the potential for 
dishonesty and fraud is extremely high.
If you’ve ever read about people in the arts, probably one of the most 
common stories you’ve encountered is that a talented person gets a man-
ager who sees great potential and the manager goes out to book lots of 
gigs and makes the artist a star. Fast forward a few years and the artist is 
living in a cardboard box eating leftover cat food from discarded tins in 
the dumpster because the manager embezzled all the funds and left the 
country. Usually with the artist’s significant other. And the cat.
This is another of the hard truths you must face. No matter how much 
you wish it were otherwise, there are a great many people you simply can’t 
trust. When money is involved, the odds of meeting them skyrockets.
I do appreciate the fact that this sounds jaded and cynical. I can assure 
you it’s not my preferred perspective. It’s one that I’ve learned both from 
personal experience and from being close enough to the train wreck of 
someone else’s career to get my jeans singed. I like people and I believe 
there are a lot of truly wonderful, trustworthy folks out there. I also 
believe in giving people a chance. That said, I always sleep with one eye 
open. If you want me to trust you, you’re going to have to demonstrate 
that trustworthiness through consistent behavior over a respectable 
period of time.

Have Fun, Get Paid
45
As an aside, it’s worth mentioning that I hold myself to that standard as 
well. In all of my dealings, be they business, creative, or personal, I don’t 
expect people to take me on faith. That even applies to the books I write. 
If what I say is true, you should be able to go out into the streets and see 
it demonstrated in a fairly consistent manner (nothing in life works 100 
percent of the time). If it doesn’t turn out to be the case, I’m not worthy 
of your trust.
I apply that attitude to all of my dealings with people and it has an added 
value beyond just living true to what I personally believe. By working to 
earn people’s trust, I tend to have a lot of positive interactions. That’s 
not terribly surprising since this attitude demonstrates respect for the 
other party. When you treat people well, that tends to create good 
relationships.
I’m not a perfect person by any stretch of the imagination and I may very 
well screw up more than the next guy. Nonetheless, I sincerely try to be a 
good guy and do the right thing. The problem with blindly trusting people 
to manage your affairs is that there are just too many people out there 
who don’t care about such things, and that makes you terribly vulnerable. 
You can relinquish power over your career to someone else, and the 
benefit is being free of uncomfortable tasks. The risk is getting screwed, 
over and over again.
The other path isn’t a walk in the park, either. You simply have a different 
set of problems to consider. If you decide to become actively involved 
in the business details of your career, you gain much more control and 
greatly reduce your vulnerabilities. Note that I didn’t say eliminate. Even 
when you’re the person collecting the money, you can still get stiffed, and 
there are countless other ways that things can go wrong for you. That’s 
just life in the big city. Still, better odds mean less chances of encountering 
such unpleasantness.
You’ll also be more exposed to the highs and lows of everyday transac-
tions. When you have a manager handling your affairs, you’re buffered 
from the rejection inherent in running your business.
Consider this. In many sales jobs, if you get two sales after pitching ten 
people, you’re a rock star. That means you have a rejection rate of 80 per-
cent. That’s a lot of people saying no to you, and even if you can develop 
the thicker skin required of such work, it still gets old after a while. A 
manager typically tells you just the success stories. Should you fail to get 
a particular job and the bad news has to be delivered to you, she’ll soften 
the blow in conversation. You have no such luxury when you’re doing it 
yourself.

Chapter 3 | Becoming Self-Sufficient 
46
As with any respectable coin, there are of course two sides. There’s a feel-
ing of empowerment that goes along with charting your own course. In a 
previous lifetime, before I ran my own sales-consulting company, I started 
out as a salesman. When you’re moving the merchandise for a living, com-
pensation varies from job to job and it’s usually a trade-off. More guaran-
teed income with a lower percentage of the sale or higher points coupled 
with less financial security. I always chose the latter. Risky? Yes. However, it 
also meant that rather than depending on someone else, I could write my 
own paycheck. Got some extra bills this month? Need more money? No 
problem. Work harder, make more money.
When you’re captain of your own ship, this feeling of power courses 
through your veins. Every success is an excuse for cartwheels. When 
times are tough, you don’t have to sit by the phone wondering if your 
agent is even trying. You just get out there, pound the pavement, and 
make it happen. Just don’t bring the ship along. It’s a little rough on the 
asphalt.
I’m obviously an advocate of handling your own affairs wherever possible. 
Honestly, I’d rather just sit back, do my thing, and let others take care of all 
the noncreative stuff. In fact, early in my creative career I did exactly that. 
The aforementioned row of battle scars and the insights I’ve shared are a 
direct result of those experiences.
Still, I realize that we’re all individuals, so you have to go with what works 
for you. If you choose to let others manage your affairs, I will at the very 
least recommend that you stay in the loop as much as possible, be edu-
cated about the work they’re doing, learn to read contracts, and under-
stand where every penny goes. In other words, if you’re asking yourself 
if having a manager gets you off the hook in terms of your workload, the 
answer is no, not if you want to minimize your vulnerability to the great-
est extent possible.
As you can see, no matter which path you choose, there’s going to be 
some work and discomfort involved. That said, there is a third path that’s 
a variation on the first. You can ask others to do the work for you, offer 
blind trust, and hope that it all works out for the best.
Do I really need to connect the dots for you on this one?
Hire an Expert
No matter which path you choose as an overall strategy, wouldn’t it be 
great if you could retain the services of a consultant to advise you on the 
many choices you’ll face along the way? Someone who was an established 
expert in the very things that are important to you? While I rarely take 

Have Fun, Get Paid
47
on career-coaching clients these days (most people expect magic answers 
and are shocked to discover that I give them homework), I actually have a 
much more qualified person to recommend than myself. You.
You’re going to be doing this for a long time. You’re going to grow in your 
art, and your interests and goals will change along the way. Your industry 
will also undergo change, and you’ll see different opportunities and other 
interests that weren’t previously possible. There will never be another 
person on this planet who will know what you want to accomplish better 
than you. When it comes to your personal career, you are the undisputed 
expert in your field. I recommend that you take full advantage of this valu-
able resource.
A good consultant will work with you and help you review and under-
stand all of your options for a given scenario. Even our rocket-piloting 
chimpanzee friend can spread those options out on the table for you. It 
doesn’t take much expertise to look around at what’s possible, make a 
list, and scribble it on your whiteboard. Okay, perhaps you have to be tall 
enough to reach the markers, but that’s a modest constraint.
What requires true expertise is looking at those options and weighing the 
pros and cons of each against your personal desires, discomforts, work 
ethic, and the degree of risk you’re willing to accept. That’s a lot of calcula-
tions that have to take place. Of course, anyone with a pocket calculator, 
otherwise known as a cell phone, can do the math on the positives and 
negatives, but only if they have the X factor. The only person who under-
stands this magic variable, the intimate knowledge of how you feel and 
what you’re willing to do, is you.
Eventually, you will discover that you are your own best advisor, consultant, and guardian. Once 
you do, you’ll gain the confidence you need to knock on doors, make inroads, persist, take 
chances, and all the other ingredients of a stellar career in the arts.
You’ll also never find another soul who is more dedicated to the cause 
than you. Our art is a highly personal affair and no one truly appreciates 
the connection we have with it. It’s a part of our very being. Additionally, 
no one really cares about your financial situation or what color of card-
board box you live in more than you. Sure, your friends love you, so 
naturally they’re concerned about your health and well-being, but not as 
much as you. They’re also who you turn to when you need someone 
to talk to about your dreams and desires. Maybe they get it, maybe they 
don’t, but regardless of how close the two of you are, they’ll never feel it 
as intensely as you.

Chapter 3 | Becoming Self-Sufficient 
48
In addition to having a career consultant you can count on to consis-
tently provide a reliable perspective, you could use another person on 
your team. Think of the position as that of a career bodyguard. As we’ve 
already seen, there are countless opportunities for you to get screwed, 
and not just for money. Petty politics among the circle of people you work 
with could leave you holding the least desirable opportunity. People who 
promise favors or introductions suddenly give their loyalty to another. 
Some employ character assassination to eliminate you as competition for 
creative positions or paying gigs. The list is a long one. It’s a rough universe 
out there. Who’s going to watch your back?
Once again, the fiercest and most loyal defender you will find is you. 
When you get jerked around, no one else feels the pain. When you get 
stories instead of payment, no one else is eating yesterday’s pet food. 
When opportunities arise, the only person you can count on to tell you 
about them is you.
I’ve played lots of rock-and-roll gigs where the crowd shows up on a 
Harley and blood on the floor isn’t entirely out of the question. When 
you mix alcohol, loud music, and the opposite sex, you’re standing in a 
room full of gas just praying nobody wants to light a cigarette. In the real 
world, things can go wrong. No matter how big, bad, and scary looking 
you might be (and I’m not), there’s always someone scarier. Having a body-
guard is not a guarantee of safety. On the other hand, when pool cues and 
skulls collide, they’re darned handy to have around.
If you accept such a position in defense of your own career, you will 
without a doubt have to duck the proverbial cue ball flying through the 
air. That’s part of the gig. You’ll see things going wrong, or about to go 
wrong, and as your own personal career bodyguard, it falls to you to 
get your client out of harm’s way. Having personal experience in a wide 
variety of rather exciting situations, proverbial and otherwise, I have one 
very encouraging thing to offer. In almost all cases, the highest form of 
self-defense, be it personal safety or career security, is the ability to see 
trouble coming and be somewhere else before it arrives.
I was playing a gig once on the wrong side of the tracks and during a 
break was sitting at the far end of the bar away from the door. Suddenly, 
I heard six distinct pops outside. Naturally, everyone rushed to the 
door, and as one of them passed he asked if I was interested in what 
was going on. I told him I knew exactly what was going on. The sounds 
coming my way told me that it was a snub-nosed 38, six shots had been 
fired, the shooter was currently reloading, and judging by the crowd 
gathered at the door, he already had sufficient targets. I was perfectly 
content to stay seated on my stool behind a very big chunk of wood. 
The trouble was outside. I chose to be elsewhere.

Knowing what’s going on is important. As your own private secret ser-
vice agent, you find yourself constantly gathering intelligence, checking the 
horizon, verifying information, and in general checking to make sure your 
perimeter is secure. When it looks like there’s a chance for someone to 
screw you out of money, you see it coming and alter the arrangement 
to prevent the possibility from even existing. If there’s a hint of malicious 
rumor, you’re able to nip it in the bud. When others are after your gig, 
you’re aware enough to reduce your vulnerabilities either through bet-
ter performance, a stronger relationship with the person providing the 
gig, or other such preemptive measures. In other words, unlike so many 
others, you avoid being a professional target.
With just a personal coach and your very own career bodyguard, you’ve 
made a huge difference in your chances of long-term, consistent success. 
You sleep better at night because you know without a shadow of a doubt 
that you can trust the people who are on watch. And none of this cost 
you a dime. If you’re going to invest in your career, this is without a doubt 
the best value on the planet.
Reality Check
I’ve been a creative creature all my life and in that time the most enduring, 
if not endearing, advice I’ve heard is to be realistic. This is usually offered 
by noncreatives who are trying to convince me that I should give up my 
evil ways and get a real job. In other words, go to school and become a 
doctor, a lawyer, or perhaps embrace other such respectable occupations. 
My responses and level of patience with this line of reasoning have gener-
ally been moderated by how much I cared about the relationship, meaning 
I would at best nod and politely smile. At worst, it was unlikely that I’d be 
invited back to that particular party. Probably best for all concerned.
In fairness, I do see such advice for what it is. If you live in a small world, 
anything beyond the known borders represents the edge of the earth, 
where dragons lie. Seen through their eyes, this is advice meant to save 
me from certain doom. How can you not appreciate such an effort? I also 
know that there is another translation, which is the part I really object to: 
Dreams are dangerous. Be safe. Don’t dream. Many of these people had 
their own fantasies but gave them up without even trying, or perhaps after 
the first cold, hard bump into reality.
The world is full of people who are quick to tell you what can’t be done, 
either because they failed at the attempt or were discouraged by the 
mere thought of dragons and thus never even tried. I don’t need naysay-
ers in my life. It’s hard enough to leap the hurdles I encounter without 
the weight of all that negativity dragging me down. I’m a typical creative 

Chapter 3 | Becoming Self-Sufficient 
50
creature, meaning I have enough nagging insecurities, self-doubt, and bad 
experiences to overcome as it is. I need people to encourage me, to lift 
my spirits when I’m down, to kick me in the pants when I’m being lazy.
Somewhere down the line, though, I realized I needed something else. 
Rather than the self-defeating futility of those who fear the open sea, I 
needed the seasoned sailor who had seen the edge of the earth, had a 
drink with the dragon, and lived to tell the tale. Someone who under-
stood what the sky looked like right before the weather lost its mind and 
the ocean turned upside down. A guide who could have warned me that 
walking into that particular tavern was a very bad idea.
Bulletproof idealism is the birthright of the young and the treasured pos-
session of the young at heart. It’s also the equivalent of painting three red 
concentric circles on your posterior so that life has a convenient target to 
shoot at. I was making far too many mistakes. I don’t mind that so much, 
as it’s nature’s little way of helping me learn. What I do mind is making 
stupid, avoidable mistakes that a more practical perspective would have 
never allowed. I needed to start seeing the world as it truly was, not as I 
wished that it could be.
I can’t put my finger on exactly when or where it happened, but I found 
myself using such phrases as “practical” and yes, heaven help me, “realis-
tic.” However, in my own defense, I have a completely different use for 
that word than my dragon-fearing friends of old. It has nothing to do 
with clinging to security or giving up dreams. It’s all about commonsense, 
which I realize is not exactly a frequent flyer in the world of the artisti-
cally enabled.
Include words like “practical” and “realistic” in your vocabulary. Doing so will train you to think 
and act in a results-oriented manner.
If you’re playing a gig with a hundred Harleys parked outside, you don’t 
walk in wearing a Honda T-shirt. You may like Hondas, and I’m sure they’re 
very nice motorcycles. I’m equally sure that this is going to end badly, 
as such bikers take a rather dim view of brands not made here in the 
good old US of A. You don’t have to agree with that perspective. You 
should, however, know what you’re getting into before you walk through 
the doors. Like knowing where the safest place to be is when someone’s 
testing out his brand new snub-nosed 38 in the parking lot, that’s just 
commonsense.
On matters closer to home, many of us hold views on our art that are 
at odds with reality. One example of this is the conviction I’ve seen in 
many different art forms that if your work is good enough you’ll succeed 

Have Fun, Get Paid
51
because people appreciate quality. I agree that the cornerstone of your 
career should be top-notch talent. However, if you think that’s all there is 
to it, you’re in for a bit of a letdown.
I encountered a similar attitude in my years teaching sales. I had numerous 
applicants tell me in interviews that if the product was good, it would sell 
itself. In my own defense, in the many times I heard that, I only laughed out 
loud once. If good products sell themselves, would someone please tell 
me why I’m paying a commission to salespeople? I love cars and for years 
have driven Corvettes. You might have different preferences and I’ll be 
happy to arm wrestle over which is best, but at the very least, most people 
will agree that a ’Vette is a quality product. Ever see a Chevy dealership 
without salespeople?
Another deeply cherished belief is that artistic people shouldn’t have to 
know about all that business and marketing stuff. That’s not their job. 
It’s for someone else to do. That’s not only cocky and arrogant (at least 
that’s how it came out back when I used to say it), it’s simply not realistic. 
There’s nothing wrong with having someone with a proven track record 
book your jobs or sell your products, but you better understand every 
stitch of what she’s doing or you have no way of knowing if you’re getting 
the shaft or not.
My personal favorite of all the dumb beliefs I used to cling to is that if you 
have a good act, you’ll be discovered. In very rare instances this does hap-
pen, but putting every penny you possess on “17 Red” and spinning the 
roulette wheel is not an effective way to plan your long-term career. For 
the record, it’s not that bright of an idea in Vegas either. Make sure you 
keep cab fare tucked into your wallet for the ride back to the airport.
A better approach would be to map out a series of incremental successes 
you’d like to see happen, one step after another. They should be based on 
actual gigs and opportunities that ultimately conclude at the top of the 
heap. If you happen to hit 17 Red before then, you’ve lost nothing. If your 
fortunes are no different than the average Vegas attendee, you’re still well 
on your way to the top.
It’s also a good idea to see the world as it really is, by taking some chances 
when you see an opportunity but having a contingency plan should things 
go awry. Ask any combat veteran and he’ll tell you that no battle plan ever 
survives first contact with the enemy. Being bold and daring can be an 
excellent way of improving your station in life. Maybe it works this time, 
maybe it doesn’t, but if you don’t have an exit strategy, you don’t live to 
fight another day. And who knows, that next time around could be the 
one that puts you over the top.
Being realistic isn’t about giving up dreams. It’s about taking a cold, hard 
practical look at the world around you and seeing it for what it is, warts 

Chapter 3 | Becoming Self-Sufficient 
52
and all. This gives you power. By understanding that the laws of physics 
do in fact apply and knowing how to pull the levers, you can accomplish 
some amazing things. If, instead, you base your plans on wishful thinking, 
you’re just going to ding up the paint job. Be bold. Be brilliant. And be 
smart about it.
Managing Expectations
We can extend this concept to expectations, both yours and that of oth-
ers. Part of being realistic is seeing people for who they really are. Some 
are able to understand the nature of others through natural-born instinct, 
but even if that’s not on your resume, it’s a skill that can be learned. It’s 
also a very important one to have.
The ultimate in self-sufficiency is being able to do everything yourself. 
Naturally, that’s not something that everyone can accomplish, nor is it 
always practical. When you need to bring someone else into your circle 
to perform a particular task, there are a number of different ways it can 
work out. You can get lucky and find that she’s everything she said she 
was. Things get done, no problem. At the opposite extreme is someone 
who wasn’t as capable, motivated, or trustworthy as advertised. You usu-
ally find that out the hard way at the end of the exercise when it all comes 
crashing down on you. In the latter case, you then have to dust yourself 
off, clear away the debris of the disaster, and start over with another per-
son, at which point you either get lucky or you don’t.
If that doesn’t sound like a particularly efficient approach, you do have 
alternatives. If you can hone your ability to see people for who they really 
are, you’re in a position to size them up before ever agreeing to work with 
them. If they have catastrophe written all over them, it’s hugs and kisses 
all around, but you move on to the next candidate. Few of us are infallible 
in our judgment even when we work very hard at our assessment skills, 
but if the dial goes from zero to one hundred, I want the needle as high 
as I can get it.
Perceiving a person’s character and capabilities intuitively is something 
that many can do, but it’s not easily taught. A method that’s easier to 
reproduce involves research rather than using the Force, even if the latter 
does give you an excuse to buy that nifty looking light saber you’ve always 
wanted. The concept is easy enough to grasp. How a person treats others 
is good indication of how he’ll treat you. The trick to this is to observe a 
large enough sample size.
Let’s take the owner of a dance company who is a tightfisted and miserly 
guy and cheats his dancers whenever possible. Enter a new ballerina 
who is highly attractive and willing to entertain his advances. Since he 

Have Fun, Get Paid
53
has romantic desires and wants to win her over, he might give her gifts, 
preferential treatment, better pay, bonuses, and the like. Everyone else still 
gets treated like dirt.
If the only time you see him is when he’s out and about, doting on the 
object of his affection and treating her like gold, you might come to the 
conclusion that this is a great guy and you really want to work for him. 
Should you choose to work for him, however, your life would be as miser-
able as everyone else’s. And yet, you judged him based on his actions. The 
problem is, you had a sample size of one. Had you done enough research 
to see how he treated, say, twenty people, you would have quickly come 
to the conclusion that his treatment of the new prima ballerina was out 
of character and drawn a more realistic conclusion.
You’ll rarely have all possible information, but in general if you perform 
due diligence, you’re going to have a pretty good idea of who you’re deal-
ing with. It’s also important to consider the source when doing your 
research. Let’s reverse the previous example and use a guy who treats 
his dancers like family. A new face comes into the crowd, and after a time 
he does his best to completely ignore her whenever possible. You talk 
to people who turn out to be close friends of hers and hear story after 
story of how terrible he is. You then talk to various industry people who 
know him professionally but aren’t among his circle of friends. They say 
just the opposite.
It turns out that he hired her because she’s a big box-office draw. He then 
discovered that she’s also a drunk, a thief, a liar, and has a violent temper. 
Beyond the bounds of getting the job done, he wants nothing to do with 
her and can’t wait for her contract to expire. You have received equal 
amounts of opposing information. In one case, you spoke with those who 
were loyal to the troublemaker and had an axe to grind. The other group 
were people who were informed but didn’t have a stake in the matter 
one way or the other. Suddenly, you don’t have two equally weighted sets 
of data and are able to come to a realistic conclusion about what he’d be 
like to work with.
Having insight into the ethics and skills of another person requires some effort. It is easy to get 
the wrong impression when you listen to one or two people who may have axes to grind or debts 
to pay. Before you enter into an important business relationship with someone—be it a gallery 
owner, troupe leader, agent, or what have you—talk to as many people as you can about their 
experiences so that biases can be averaged out.

Chapter 3 | Becoming Self-Sufficient 
54
In addition to knowing how capable, dependable, and trustworthy people 
are along with the nature of their ethics, it’s also important to under-
stand a bit about their own dreams and ambitions. All other things being 
equal, this can be a very good indicator of how they’ll behave in a given 
situation.
If they’re morally ambiguous and an opportunity comes along that would 
require dishonesty on their part, maybe they go for it, maybe they don’t. 
Having a good sense of just how far they’ll go has a lot to do with know-
ing how appealing that particular carrot is. You’re never going to have a 
roomful of people who are all as pure as the driven snow. Everyone has 
their weaknesses. Those of us in the arts have even more.
A fundamental part of crime prevention has less to do with punishing 
people than it does with helping them to avoid temptation. Don’t put 
people in an unsupervised room with huge stacks of money in unmarked 
bills. They may be perfectly reliable in 99 percent of situations. Why set 
them up for failure when you could instead arrange for success?
Another benefit of knowing people’s dreams is the ability it gives you to 
motivate them. This is not only very effective, done properly it’s a posi-
tive experience for all involved. Let’s say you need someone to book your 
band. Two of your candidates are agents and do this very thing. They’re 
qualified and have a good reputation, but ultimately you’d be just another 
commission to them.
The third person has an equally impressive track record but is also a 
longtime fan and supporter of your band. She only works part time as an 
agent and has no desire to do it full time. What she really wants is to man-
age your band and be a part of the family, helping you grow and succeed. 
All three are capable of booking you and if you looked at nothing but 
their track record, it might be a tough call. However, by knowing that the 
two agencies desire to grow their companies by bringing on more bands 
and the part-time agent dreams of seeing you succeed, the decision gets 
easier. Who do you think will work the hardest for you?
Another consideration when dealing with people is understanding how 
easily they’re influenced and who does the influencing. Sometimes the 
person you’re talking to isn’t the person you think. Using the same band, 
let’s say that you’re locked, loaded, and on your way to the big time. The 
music is good, the gigs are improving, the players get along, and every-
thing’s going your way. Everyone also seems equally committed to the 
effort. In any collaborative art, dedication to the cause is a critical con-
sideration. Success takes time, and that means you need people who are 
going to stick around and occasionally sacrifice for the good of the group 
objectives.

55
With the information at hand, it looks like you’re ready to make the jump 
from part time to full time. This involves everyone quitting their day job 
and going on the road. In meetings, your people are highly enthusiastic 
about this, so you give your new manager the go-ahead and she books 
six months of work for you, scheduled to begin a few weeks from now. A 
week before you’re ready to hit the road, the bass player is suddenly skit-
tish and balks at the idea of quitting his job. With only a few days before 
your first gig, you don’t have enough time to bring in a new player. You’re 
suddenly in a very bad spot.
As it happens, the bassist in question is a good player, a great guy but a 
weak personality. He also has a girlfriend who has a very specific vision 
including marriage, kids, and a house in the suburbs. Of course, this also 
includes a husband who is home and has a steady source of income. She 
is a quiet person and not conspicuously manipulative, but she is clearly 
the power behind the throne. All the time that you were talking to the 
bass player, you thought you were talking to the decision maker. To your 
dismay, you discover at the last moment that he’s not the one who had to 
sign off on the road trip. She was.
In this particular situation, understanding who the influencer was would 
have allowed you to give your bass player a hug and a beer and begin 
auditions for a replacement before you started booking jobs. Regardless 
of the art you’re involved in, if it’s a group effort such relationship difficul-
ties are common and familiar, but the concept is the same whether you’re 
dealing with bass players, actors, club owners, distributors, or any other 
human being.
It’s also important to set appropriate expectations for anyone you interact 
with. No matter what their contribution to your effort, people have vary-
ing degrees of talent and skill. Some will be masters of their craft while 
others will just be average producers, always consistent but never setting 
the world on fire. There’s a place for all of them. The trick is matching 
the right person to the right task so that it’s an opportunity for them to 
succeed rather than fail.
In my years of training salespeople and managing client organizations, I 
saw an endless parade of people. It’s a transient workforce by nature, and 
there are also many who want to give sales a try but end up having no 
capacity for it. In every company, there were always a couple of superstars. 
What they did in a day was sometimes as much as the rest of the group 
combined.
You would think that the goal would be to fill your sales force with such 
people, but that’s actually not where the money is. Top producers are 
finicky, high maintenance, and difficult to manage. They’re also somewhat 
unstable. For a month or two, they’re setting the world on fire. Then, inex-

Chapter 3 | Becoming Self-Sufficient 
56
plicably, they go into a slump and can’t give stuff away, let alone make any 
money. Meanwhile, the steady, consistent, average producers keep deliver-
ing the same predictable business they always do.
There is an honored place in the world for the average and dependable. 
If you have expectations that they will grow and eventually do what your 
rock stars do, you’re setting both of you up for failure. If, on the other 
hand, you leave them room to improve but plan your growth on realistic 
expectations, they’ll serve you well until the end of time and you’ll all be 
happy with the experience.
As with people, you put yourself in the best position when you under-
stand the reality of a situation, knowing what the possible outcomes are 
and the probability of each happening. This allows you to plan effectively 
and be happy with the way things work out.
Let’s say that you’re a painter. There’s a gallery down the road that caters 
to famous, high-end artists, and there’s much glory associated with having a 
show there. You’re good at what you do and your work is of high-enough 
quality to be appropriate for the venue. As you might expect, there’s also 
an unruly horde of very talented artists vying for the few open slots.
There’s a smaller gallery downtown. It has a good reputation and work-
ing with it would be a profitable experience. Showing your work there 
wouldn’t make you rich and famous, but it would keep you eating on a 
regular basis for a while and continue to further your career. Because of 
your talent and experience, your work is a couple of notches above what 
they usually show. You’d be real catch for the manager of the gallery and 
you know he’d love to work with you.
There’s no reason you can’t do both. The trick is understanding the profit 
and percentages for each scenario and planning your life accordingly. The 
rock star gig is a long shot. If you were to get it, you could live for a year 
off of what you would make and could therefore concentrate on painting 
instead of trying to scare up work on a regular basis. The downtown gig 
would only keep you fed for two months, so you couldn’t really slack off 
on looking for new opportunities even if you did get it. Knowing that it’s 
unlikely you’ll land the major job any time soon and that the smaller one 
seems more realistic, you work toward both but assume you’ll have to 
keep chasing opportunities.
Most situations aren’t “either/or.” Instead, think in terms of “both/and.” Surprisingly often in life, 
you can have your cake and eat it too.

Have Fun, Get Paid
57
If you only get the lower-paying gig, you haven’t stopped looking for other 
things so you’ll be in a good position. The show will probably go well, you’ll 
make some money, people will make a fuss over you, and your career will 
have moved forward a notch without you missing any meals. If you happen 
to get the other gig as well, you can both enjoy your success and count 
yourself among the fortunate. Either way, because your plans were based 
on realistic expectations, you had opportunity combined with minimal 
risk. That’s the best of both worlds.
The Long Game
In order to gain control over your career, and by extension your personal 
life, you’re going to need to apply consistent effort over an extended 
period of time. Whether it’s improving your craft, marketing, or even that 
New Year’s resolution to lose a few pounds, the most common mistake 
people make would look like a very sharp spike if you saw it on a graph.
When you’re excited about making something happen, it’s easy to gener-
ate that initial burst of activity. Your mind is full of ideas, the possibilities 
seem endless, and you dive right in. For a week, maybe even a month, 
you live on cheap pasta, bad coffee, and no sleep while you slave away to 
accomplish your goals. And then, nothing.
Month two finds you doing very little in comparison to the previous 
period. Maybe you spend a few hours here and there, but it feels more 
and more like drudgery. Gone is the excitement and the adrenaline that 
accompanied it. With little effort, there are likely few results, so you don’t 
have that to keep you fired up, either. By month three, the goal’s pushed 
to the back burner, that time-honored place on the stove for projects 
that we’re hoping the cat will make off with in the dead of the night so 
that we no longer have to look at them.
Not only is this approach less than productive, it can also be a drain on 
morale, a critical consideration. When you try and don’t succeed, it takes 
some of the wind out of your sails. The next time you have a bright idea, 
part of you will be excited but in the back of your mind you’ll remember 
all that work you did for nothing and it will dampen your enthusiasm. 
Fortunately, there is a better way.
The definition of hard work isn’t a Herculean burst of effort over a short 
period of time that almost kills you. Hard work is chipping away at the 
stone just a little each day, and repeating that process with consistency. 
Let’s say you’re a sculptor who wants to carve an elephant out of a huge 
block of granite. As any good artist knows, the proper procedure is to 
start with your stone and then simply remove everything that doesn’t 
look like an elephant.

Chapter 3 | Becoming Self-Sufficient 
58
You’re creating a life-sized replica, so there’s going to be a whole lot of 
chipping going on. Granite is also known for its resistance to change. Since 
you’re intimately familiar with stubborn stones and the sweat required, 
you dive right into it and work seven days straight around the clock, paus-
ing only for an hour’s nap here and there when you’re ready to collapse.
At the end of a week’s time, there’s still a lot about your project that 
doesn’t look like an elephant. Unfortunately, you’ve neglected your body 
and get sick. After another week in bed, and low energy for days after-
ward, you just don’t feel much like romancing the stone and give up on 
the project. The elephant you left stranded inside a huge block of granite 
is not amused.
Seeing that you’re not going to do anything with this big chunk of rock in 
your backyard and wanting to get a little extra practice in, your appren-
tice decides to spend her spare time seeing if she can free the pachyderm 
from its predicament. She can only spend a couple of hours after work 
on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but she figures every little bit helps. You don’t 
give it another thought, as you’ve moved on to other projects and don’t 
spend much time outdoors anyway.
The following year, you happen to walk into your backyard. and glanc-
ing up, you see a magnificent, polished elephant glaring down on you in 
mock disapproval. An elephant never forgets. People, however, do and 
having long since forgotten about this project, you’re stunned by the sight. 
Furthermore, it’s actually a very nice piece of work, exhibiting tremen-
dous attention to detail.
You call some of your sculptor friends over for a party. Everyone admires 
the elephant. A review gets published in an important magazine and 
before you know it, your backyard is the talk of the town. Of course, 
your apprentice is getting the much deserved attention for her work and 
soon finds herself considering a number of lucrative opportunities. The 
elephant couldn’t be more pleased.
You worked a hundred times more intensely in that week than she was 
capable of, and you also possess a high degree of skill that exceeds that of 
an apprentice. You also only put in seven days of work. Your apprentice, 
on the other hand, just kept patiently chipping away at the stone, week 
after week, month after month. The chunk of granite became an elephant-
shaped lump, and then a crude rendition of a large, leathery mammal. 
From there it progressed into a decent statue but with continual effort, 
tweaking, and attention, it eventually became a magnificent, highly refined 
work of art, even though it was just at the hands of an apprentice.

When you have goals in mind, it’s usually because you need or want some-
thing. Because we humans can be an impatient lot, we often want it right 
away, because our need is now. If, for instance, what you’re trying to gener-
ate is money, having more of it today would be really nice. What we tend 
to forget, however, is that this time next year we’re still going to need it.
Building a career requires long-term strategy, not short-term thinking. 
You’re going to want better opportunities, more money, and greater pres-
tige this year to be sure. The same can be said a year from now, and 
though it’s so far away it might seem like another planet, you’re even going 
to want it twenty years from now. Take care of business to address today’s 
demands, but play the long-term game. That’s what really gets you down 
the road, and that’s where time management can be incredibly valuable.
Know Thyself
The first rule of effective time management is actually a pretty good start-
ing point for any venture. Know thyself. If you plan with your enthusi-
asm rather than your brain, you’re just going to end up with an unsightly 
chunk of stone in your backyard, and the neighbors will talk. The first step, 
then, is to look in the mirror and see your strengths and weaknesses as 
they truly are. No good, no bad, no judgment; just an honest and realistic 
assessment of what you have to work with.
Are you hyperorganized in your life with a penchant for control and a 
phobia of anything being three millimeters out of place? Should you fol-
low the advice of one of your friends who suggests that you be more 
spontaneous and just make it up as you go along, your life would probably 
become a complete disaster. If you’ve ever waded out into the ocean and 
tried to swim against a very strong current, you know that fighting with 
more powerful forces makes you very tired. Sure, it can be done. The 
question you should ask is whether or not that’s the most efficient use of 
your resources.
Many artistic types are more abstract in nature. Structure, schedules, and 
timetables etched in stone make them break out in a cold sweat. If you try 
to force yourself to perform a specific task at 6:35 each evening, your initia-
tive won’t even last a week. You’re swimming against the current and you’re 
going to look very foolish when the lifeguard has to come fish you out.
What we’re looking for is consistent effort over an extended period of 
time. This might be applied to booking gigs, improving your skills, expand-
ing your audience, or any number of objectives. Whatever the goal, if it’s 
something that’s going to take a large number of hours or is repetitive by 
nature, like getting jobs, you need a plan to ensure that you actually spend 
the time it takes.

Chapter 3 | Becoming Self-Sufficient 
60
The first part of the plan involves looking at your life on a typical week. 
You probably spend a certain amount of time working jobs, a chunk of 
hours honing your craft, and a very necessary block of time just goofing 
off and enjoying life. If you look at your life over a longer stretch of time, 
say a few months, and you’re honest with yourself, patterns will emerge. 
You’ll be able to see that on any given week, you could come up with  
five hours without making unrealistic demands on the time required by 
other needs.
If you’re highly ambitious and a real go-getter, that may not seem like 
much time. Resist the temptation to declare a larger amount of hours 
because you think you can beat yourself into submission through sheer 
force of will. You’ll burn out in a week and be left with an unsightly chunk 
of granite on your back lawn. If five hours is comfortable and consistently 
realistic, go with it. As our long-nosed friend would be quick to point out, 
it all adds up.
Next, apply that time to what you’ve discovered about your tendencies. 
If you’re structured by nature, you can simply plot out which day or days 
you’ll perform the tasks each week, and off you go.
Should you be more of the abstract variety of human, that’s not going 
to work, but you still need to apply consistent effort over an extended 
period of time. The way you do that is by using larger blocks of time 
instead of the fine granularity a structured person would employ. Some 
people will be able to commit to five hours on a weekly basis and specify 
the days and times this will happen. A more relaxed approach might be to 
say that at the end of the week, by the time you go to bed each Sunday 
night, you will have found your five hours.
Five hours a week: that’s all the time you need to move a mountain over the course of a year.
Others might twitch at even that harsh of a schedule, so perhaps it would 
be better for them do ten hours every two weeks. Just don’t get too far 
into extremes or you have no plan. Telling yourself that your plan will 
come out to 260 hours by the end of December may be technically cor-
rect but it’s functionally useless. Make the chunk as small as you’re capable 
of by nature, but no smaller.
For all personality types, the critical consideration is keeping the promises 
you make to yourself. That’s something that no one can teach you to do. 
You just have to reach down, find some inner strength to draw on, and 
show a little backbone. That said, the easiest way to find that power is by 
focusing on what it is you wanted in the first place. If you find you’re having 

Have Fun, Get Paid
61
trouble keeping your own promises, there’s a very good chance that you 
don’t care about the goal as much as you thought you did. Find a goal that 
motivates you. You’ll find the conviction to stick to your plan.
You might have noticed in passing that five hours a week is 260 hours a 
year. That’s the equivalent of six and a half forty-hour weeks of working 
full time, nonstop toward your goal. If you could spare a month and a half 
to do nothing but work on a specific goal, imagine how much you could 
accomplish.
You might say in January of this year that it’s hard to get excited about 
something you won’t achieve until Christmas. What you have to remem-
ber is that this time next January, you’re still going to be alive and kicking, 
sitting in the same chair, and having the same desire to move your career 
forward. However, what you’ll have sitting in the chair next to you are 
the fruits of your labors, those benefits you earned by finding five hours 
a week the year before. It can be very rewarding indeed and you can get 
there putting forth very little effort each week.
When you first start working on long-term goals, time management, and 
self-discipline, chances are good you’re going to fall flat on your face—and 
more than once. You’ll have false starts, encounter distractions, get frus-
trated, deal with unexpected life situations, and in general screw up in an 
impressive variety of ways. If you’re like most people, you’ll be tempted to 
come down hard on yourself for failing. It doesn’t take much imagination 
to realize that this doesn’t help you. Furthermore, you don’t deserve to 
be criticized. You’re trying something new. What, you thought you’d be 
perfect on the first try?
It’s going to take you a few tries to get the kinks out of the system and find 
the groove that works for you personally. It doesn’t matter if your best 
friend does it one way with great results. You have to find the approach 
that’s comfortable for you. No one else’s style matters.
You also need to become good at rebooting. You’re going to get knocked 
off track over and over again. Life is an unpredictable adventure and there’s 
not a thing you can do about it. Your only recourse, then, is to gradually 
get better and better at starting over. There are a couple of things that will 
help with this.
First, leave your self-recrimination at the door. It may feel like you’re doing 
something constructive by criticizing yourself, but all you’re really doing is 
letting the air out of your tires. That tends to be a little hard on the rims. 
You won’t even realize you’ve fallen out of your routine for quite some 
time. Then, one day, it will hit you. The correct response at that point is 
to find your notebook, get something nice to drink, and review whatever 
step one was. No big deal.

Chapter 3 | Becoming Self-Sufficient 
62
The second portion is related to the first. You not only need to avoid 
getting angry with yourself; you need to acquire the ability to let go of the 
entire thing. A month has gone by and you did nothing? No worries. That 
was last month. This is now. Shake it off, think about this week instead of 
last month, take another sip of whatever it is you’re drinking, and be happy. 
Life knocked you for a loop, but you just put yourself back on track. That’s 
something to feel good about, which is precisely what you should do. 
Happy people do the best work and have the greatest endurance. They 
also make some pretty cool looking statues.
The end result is that eventually, and it may be a year or two, you’ll get 
good at this. You’ll know what your personal flow is and how to get in 
harmony with it so that you can be your most productive. You’ll employ 
long-term thinking and become practiced at creating and executing plans, 
and one step at a time you’ll be moving yourself down the road. That’s a 
pretty good feeling.
Get Smart 
Another thing that feels good is continually educating yourself. As with 
planning and time management, we each have our own style of things 
that work for us. Today, more than ever, there’s something out there for 
everyone.
If you have a little money to spend on classes, books, seminars, or other 
such learning tools, that’s great. If you don’t, the Internet is a huge free 
resource for those with the patience and commonsense to use it prop-
erly. Whatever your passion, there will be others who share it and many 
of them enjoy passing along what they’ve learned.
Rather than paying with money, you’ll pay for this type of education with 
time and effort. First, you have to use such things as search engines, refer-
rals from friends, and Web links on one site connecting you to another to 
find relevant sources of knowledge.
Next, you have to validate that knowledge. My neighbor’s cat can put up a 
Web site in about ten minutes, and that’s if she’s not busy making videos 
of herself. There will be a lot of good stuff out there, but it will often be 
buried amid a bunch of content that’s either inaccurate, unprofessional, or 
just plain hard to follow. This is research. If you take your time and put in 
consistent effort, you’ll be rewarded.
You’ll also find that you’re drawn more to some methods of learning than 
others. A friend might prefer video tutorials while you like to read a good 
book. Someone else might really need a classroom environment with an 
instructor who can answer questions. There is no right or wrong. Once 

Have Fun, Get Paid
63
again, it’s all about finding what works for you personally. If you do, you’ll 
be rewarded.
It’s also worth noting that the way you like to learn may be different 
depending on the time of day or circumstances. When I get up in the 
morning, I read the news feeds I’m subscribed to for current events, artis-
tic interests, entertainment, and anything else of interest. I’m bleary-eyed, 
clutching desperately to a hot cup of coffee, and am in no mood for sud-
den moves or jarring noises. If I see a link to a video, I bookmark it and 
run fast in the direction of the nearest article.
Later in the day, when I need a break from intense concentration, a video 
may be just the thing I’m in the mood for. It helps me relax and there are 
some things that lend themselves better to that type of presentation. 
Watching it at the right time of day or when my mood best suits it, a video 
can bring me much value. You may find that your preferences are a bit 
fluid as well. If they are, just go with it.
You might also maintain a list of areas where you’d like to improve. 
Personally, I never seem to run out of such possibilities, but that doesn’t 
mean I’m always at the right place in my day or in my life to work on them. 
Keeping them stashed away somewhere allows me to come back to them 
when the moment is right, find the one I feel comfortable working on, and 
continue to move myself forward.
Your list can also be a good springboard for learning resources. As you’re 
looking for a good resource for one area of your career or life, you may 
bump into something for another. Using computers, notepads, or even 
cocktail napkins (I kid you not), in line with what works for you person-
ally, you can keep your goals and your methods organized so that they’re 
handy when you need them. Just don’t use the napkin to support an actual 
drink. Ink tends to get rather snippy about that sort of thing.
Becoming self-sufficient is a lifetime adventure. Don’t try to get there 
overnight and don’t let the effort become a source of stress for you. As 
you’ve doubtless discovered in many other areas of your life, getting bet-
ter at something feels pretty good. So relax and allow yourself to have a 
little fun with it. Celebrate the successes, don’t sweat the mistakes, and 
before you know it, you’ll have a very impressive looking elephant in your 
backyard.

What Do You 
Want?
Before you can get what you want, you have to know what it is that you 
want. If that sounds redundant and obvious, it is. That doesn’t make it any 
less of a potential roadblock on the path to creative success.
You might think that everyone on the planet has a clear picture of their 
desires. It may therefore surprise you to learn that it’s very common to 
find that we often have at best a fuzzy picture of our dreams. To further 
complicate matters, our ambitions change as the years go by. Sometimes 
this is due to shifting circumstances or exposure to new ideas. Other 
times it’s a sign of success. Having climbed that rather impressive looking 
mountain, we eventually become bored with the view and seek out new 
conquests.
We take for granted that we know what we want. Perhaps some people 
do. Even so, it’s well worth the exercise to take a moment and examine 
your passions. Before you can reach the summit, it helps to know which 
mountain to climb. If you don’t, the Sherpas you hired as guides will just 
laugh at you.
What Is Success?
If you whip out your cell phone to get directions to a particular destina-
tion, it will immediately ask you where you want to go. Sure, you can say 
you’d like to go to New York City and the app will be happy to oblige you. 
Once you hit the city limits, however, you’re going to be stopping strang-
ers on the street to ask where that famous pizza joint is that you wanted 
to visit. That always goes over well in New York.

Chapter 4 | What Do You Want?

Perhaps you’re a bit more familiar with the area and consequently tell 
your phone that you’d like directions to Ray’s Pizza, a legendary source of 
all things cheesy. To your utter dismay, your phone will promptly ask you 
which one. There are a lot of Ray’s pizzerias in the city. Which one is the 
original location or the most authentic has been a topic of lively debate 
since long before your cell phone was born.
My personal favorite was The Famous Ray’s Pizza at the corner of Sixth 
and Eleventh in Greenwich Village. If you’re on foot, or are foolish enough 
to drive a car and dodge the psychotic yellow cabs in the area, that infor-
mation’s going to be enough to get you to your destination. Your cell 
phone, however, could not possibly be less impressed. It will patiently ask 
you for a street address. It is a very stupid device. It probably doesn’t even 
know that you have to sit on the sidewalk outside and lean against the 
building to eat your slices.
We tend to think of technology and all things computerized as being 
smart. The truth of the matter is that a computer isn’t blessed with an 
abundance of commonsense. In fact, it’s a very simple-minded creature. 
You program it to do extremely specific things and it will do exactly that. 
Nothing more.
The fact that a modern processor can do this with extreme speed, switch-
ing back and forth among a large set of specific instructions, makes it seem 
more intelligent than it really is. I spent a lot of years as a software developer, 
and I can say with authority that the light switch on your wall is smarter than 
the fundamental components that do the work in an integrated circuit. At 
least it has a dimmer as opposed to the simple true-or-false mentality of 
computer logic.
With that in mind, unless you tell your cell phone the exact street address 
or GPS coordinates you have in mind, it will give you vague results at best. 
What most people don’t realize is that our lives behave in very much the 
same manner.
If you say that you’d like to make a living as a professional dancer, you may 
think that you have a very clear and specific goal. You do not. With no-
more information than this, you could end up working the midnight shift 
as a pole dancer at the Pink Pussycat. Not what you had in mind? Your 
career trajectory, being no smarter than a cell phone, doesn’t know the 
difference between that and the Bolshoi Ballet. You told it you wanted to 
be a dancer. Both are dance. There’s just no convenient place for the 
audience at the Bolshoi to put your tips.
Additionally, in your illustrious career as a stripper, you may find yourself 
living in a rat-infested fleabag of an apartment with barely enough money 
to eat. Once again, your simplistic career path would suggest that it’s met 
your requirements: You’re not working a day job and the only thing you’re 
w

Have Fun, Get Paid
67
doing for money is dancing. You may not be eating prime rib, but you’re 
eating. You’re also still alive. Therefore, you’re making a living as a dancer.
If you develop software for a living, you’ll often find yourself talking to 
your creations using less than family friendly language when an unwanted 
result appears on your screen. The response from the app is always the 
same. It will just roll its eyes and say, “Hey man, I did exactly what you 
asked me to do. The complaint department is down the hall.” You’ll find 
that your career will often speak to you in the exact same manner. Unless 
you know precisely, and I do mean in mind-numbing detail, what you want, 
you’re not going to like the results.
It’s worth noting that clear and unambiguous goals do not guarantee suc-
cess. They are, however, one of the requirements. With that in mind, take 
some time to spend in reflection and self-evaluation on a regular basis. 
Ask yourself what you really want and record the answer in as much 
detail as you can.
I use the rather low-tech method of scribbling my answers down on a 
legal pad. That’s what works for me. You might want to talk into your 
Web cam, record audio on your cell phone, write out documents on your 
pad, or utilize any other such method. Only two things matter about your 
chosen medium. First, it has to be something capable of capturing very 
specific and fine-grained detail. Second, it has to be something that feels 
natural and comfortable to you, or you simply won’t do it at all.
Once you’ve made it through your list of goals, go back to the top and 
challenge each one. This is a great time to get in touch with your inner 
six year old. All you have to do is ask simple questions such as, “Why?” 
Another phrase you might employ is, “What, specifically, does this mean?” 
As you work your way through the list, looking for any hint of vagueness 
and forcing yourself to dig deeper, you’ll quickly discover that knowing 
exactly what you want is a lot harder than you thought. It may give you 
newfound respect for your cell phone.
Repeat this cycle of writing down your goals, challenging them, and then 
refining the answers until you simply can’t think of anything else to add. 
Then go through your responses and reword them into clear, concise, and 
detailed statements that leave no ambiguity about your desires.
It’s worth noting that less supportive people, and even friends or family 
with good intentions, might look at your results and tell you that you’re 
being very unrealistic. If you truly dream of working full time as a prima 
ballerina with the Bolshoi Ballet, don’t water down your dreams because 
those of less ambition think it’s too hard. The most important part of this 
entire process is honesty. You, and only you, know your heart’s desire. If 
you merely parrot what other people think you should want, you’re never 
going to be happy.

Chapter 4 | What Do You Want?
68
There is one last aspect to this practice. In addition to spelling out what 
you want, you should also be specific about the timeline. If you just gradu-
ated high school and want to dance with the Bolshoi Ballet by Christmas, 
a lot of things are going to have to come together before you can succeed, 
but at least you’ll know what you’re shooting for. On the other hand, if you 
want to achieve this goal by the time you’re twenty-three years old, the 
extra time will allow for a different set of interim steps.
Either way, you have to know how much time it’s going to take to transi-
tion from where you are to where you want to be in order to plot an 
effective course. Without a hard-and-fast date of completion, there’s a 
very good chance that you’ll spend your entire life drifting. Dreams are vague. 
Goals have deadlines.
 Dreams are vague. Goals have deadlines.
Understanding Your Need for Validation
There’s actually another deeper level of introspection required if you’re 
to find true happiness with your art. We are creative creatures because 
we’re driven to bring our vision to life. We also seek validation for what 
we do. Many talented people would immediately become defensive were 
we to discuss this last point.
I’ve had numerous songwriters tell me that they wrote what they felt and 
didn’t need anyone’s approval. These same minstrels will move heaven and 
earth to get a gig at the local bar so that they have an audience for their 
musings. I don’t bother to point out the obvious to them. If they really 
didn’t need validation, they would just sit in their living room.
Whether we’re designing that hot new Web site or a fall line of clothing, 
we need an audience. Their attention, their applause, and their patronage 
fill one of our fundamental needs. Of course, for all but the most narcis-
sistic among us, that’s not the only motivation. To deny that those things 
exist, however, is to build little more than castles made of sand. Success 
can only be built on the foundation of honesty.
With that in mind, it’s important to understand exactly what validation you 
require. This may not be the most comfortable of exercises. It requires 
you to look deep into your soul and express your innermost wants and 
needs. To do so is to enter a moment of great vulnerability. We tend 
to put up thick and insurmountable walls between our true desires and 
the interaction we have with others. When you remove these defenses, 
it’s very easy to be hurt. When you’re wide open, even the most casual 
remark from someone else can be devastating.

Have Fun, Get Paid
69
Guys will often have an even harder time with this than girls. They’re 
equally as vulnerable, but in many environments male culture requires a 
sense of machismo to maintain respect. It’s socially acceptable for a woman 
to get in touch with her feelings. If a man does it, he’s a sissy. Anyone with 
a brain knows that this is complete nonsense, but it doesn’t matter. If you 
open up and people make fun of you, it’s going to hurt whether the attack 
was right, wrong, or completely unintentional.
The good news is that regardless of gender, there is no risk involved with 
evaluating your need for validation. It’s a conversation that takes place 
only in your own mind. It’s not important that you write it down or in any 
way share it with the world. All that matters is that you’re truthful with 
yourself and come out the other end of this exercise with an accurate 
understanding of your emotional needs.
The difficulty comes when your inner dialogue is not a product of your 
personal convictions but rather what’s been pounded into your brain by 
friends, family, and society. As you open up to yourself, you may flinch, 
expecting to hear someone making fun of you for a particular need. It’s a 
conditioned reflex, and it may take some effort to work past it, but in time 
you can do exactly that. It may take you weeks or months to do so but 
that doesn’t matter. You’re going to be alive for a very long time, and the 
insights you gain will serve you for all of those years.
It’s critical to understand the type of validation you seek as a result of 
your creative endeavors. Without this knowledge, you may never feel 
satisfied, no matter how large your audience or bank account. What we’re 
considering at the moment is actually a two-part exercise. The first part 
is deeply personal and emotional, involving the need for love, acceptance, 
status, and a great many other such things. That creates the setting. From 
there, we move to the specific. By knowing what little corners of our soul 
we need filled, we can then look at our creative future and ask relevant, 
practical questions that will help us chart a course.
We each create for different reasons and thus require different results 
in order to be gratified. There is, of course, an almost endless supply of 
considerations. Some want to make a living at what they do while others 
just need an audience. Regardless of money, it’s also worth noting that 
audiences come in different shapes and sizes. If you’re a performer of 
some sort, you can stand in a roomful of people or reach your following 
through TV, movies, the Internet, magazines, books, or other such venues 
that are more virtual than physical.
Recognition is also a frequent flier in the skies of career ambition. To 
some, it doesn’t matter that they have millions of screaming fans if they 
don’t have the respect of their peers. Another form of recognition is 
obtained through what we call gatekeepers. The Internet allows us to 

Chapter 4 | What Do You Want?
70
take our art directly to the people without anyone’s permission. You’d 
think that would be a good thing, but there’s a flip side to the coin.
For example, this book you’re reading was released through a traditional 
publisher. To some, that’s a means of validation. A publishing company can 
put out only so many books per year. There are a great many authors in 
the world, but they picked me. The status that comes with being selected 
by a gatekeeper is based in part on a sense of exclusivity. They chose 
me. They didn’t choose someone else. Therefore, in the minds of some,  
I must be special. Of course, my friends will be quick to tell you that 
there’s nothing even remotely special about me, but that’s a conversation 
for another day.
Be that as it may, the sense of validation that comes through gatekeepers 
is important to a great many people on both sides of the printed page, 
or any other such medium. To the creator, making it through the gate 
fills that internal need for validation by saying that she’s good enough to 
be chosen. That may sound dumb to you, but there are some incredibly 
gifted people in the world don’t believe they have any talent whatsoever. 
Being selected is important to them, even if it’s not to the rest of us.
Many in the audience care about the status of being selected as well. You 
can find a wealth of blindingly brilliant people on the Internet, but in the 
eyes of many, if you weren’t chosen by a gatekeeper in your particular 
industry, you’re just an amateur. That’s not true, of course, but in many 
areas of life perception becomes a truth of its own. Over the years, I’ve 
discovered that ignoring that reality tends to leave some rather interesting 
scars just below the waterline.
As an example of how this effect works, I enjoy public speaking. I’m an 
entertainer by nature, I love the feedback that I get from a live audience, 
and helping people is something that I get excited about. Because my 
books are released through a traditional publishing house, I’m assumed to 
have a degree of credibility. That makes it easier to get speaking gigs. Had 
I self-published this book, which was certainly among my options, would I 
still be credible? Personally, I don’t think it should matter. However, when 
you’re considering the intersection of your career and the real world, it’s 
important to see things as they are, not how you believe they should be.
As an aside, if you want the inside story on why I went through this pub-
lisher, the answer is less glamorous than you might think. They’re in New 
York and I needed a good pizza connection.
Regardless of what the real you deep inside needs, whether it’s the adula-
tion of the masses or just a decent paycheck, the path to success begins 
with the same first step. Know thyself.

71
Working for a Living
While not the only form of validation, money is one that provides a num-
ber of benefits. If you can make a living purely through your creative pas-
sion, it buys you freedom. Even if you just want to do it part time, it’ll 
certainly buy you a pizza. Many creatives are happy with nothing more 
than an audience, and that’s hard enough to obtain as it is. If you want to 
enter the world of commerce, it involves additional considerations. As 
you might expect, the first and foremost is the definition of your desires.
Do you want to be rich and famous, a member of that tiny elite who has 
more money than a Third World nation, and a face that appears on every 
media outlet on the planet? It might surprise you that not everyone does. 
Don’t get me wrong, I like a good mansion as much as the next guy, but 
that’s way too many rooms for me to clean. Before robots came along,  
I had a hard time just keeping the living room vacuumed.
If, like me, you’re content to make a living doing the things that you love, 
your career path will have a distinctly different set of steps than those 
who are driven to appear on the world stage. Whether you want to be an 
international superstar or just an everyday creative creature, the choice is 
good as long as you’re being honest with yourself. The important thing is 
to know what you want so that you can plan effectively.
If your heart’s desire is to be a megastar who makes blockbuster movies, 
it’s wise to assume that you may not get there in one single step. How 
long it takes depends on talent, planning, and a healthy dose of sheer dumb 
luck. With that in mind, you should give thought to what life will be like 
between point A and point B. In other words, once you’re involved in a 
major motion picture, your financial situation should be in good shape. Until 
that time, however, how are you going to pay the bills?
If you’re not practical about this, you stand a good chance of being mis-
erable for however many years it takes to reach stardom. I see no need 
for you to endure that. The key to avoiding such unpleasantness lies in 
incremental goals. If you’re a broke waitress dreaming of the big time and 
thinking of nothing else, you may be slinging hash for many years before 
you get your big break. As someone who’s flipped his fair share of cheese-
burgers, I can assure you that this isn’t a particularly gratifying place to 
wait for fame and fortune.
Even though for a time I wanted to be a rich and famous rock star, I found 
over the years that I really enjoyed playing bars for a living. Sure, it has 
its less-than-glamorous moments, but I get to be in a room making music 
with my friends, surrounded by a lot of people who enjoy the experience. 
When I walk off stage, I get to hang out with the crowd and make even 
more friends.

Chapter 4 | What Do You Want?
72
Back when I was pursuing music as a career path, I wasn’t on the cover 
of Rolling Stone and I didn’t sell a million albums. However, I was paying 
the bills without working a day job, and it was a lot more fun than flipping 
cheeseburgers.
There are just as many opportunities for our hardworking waitress. 
There are local theater shows, commercials, voice-over gigs, and many 
other opportunities that will not make you rich and famous but will keep 
you out of the local diner until your big break comes. Could you find 
happiness in such an interim scenario, or some variation on the theme? 
It’s well worth considering. If your spirit doesn’t require an all-or-nothing 
approach to life, there’s no reason you should have a bad time on the road 
trip to glory.
How Much Is Enough?
Whether you’re biding your time or you’re just happy doing a few gigs here 
and there, one of the things to include in your considerations is an evalu-
ation of your baseline monetary requirements. In other words, how much 
is enough?
My best friend was a working-class musician all his life. He preferred jazz 
but played every type of music, and his gigs included bars, weddings, coun-
try clubs, and more than a few Holiday Inns. These were not glamorous 
events. I know. I played many a job with him. He always lived in modest apart-
ments or houses, and we both gave our share of blood in order to eat. For 
many, this would be a dismal life that would feel like complete failure. For 
him, it was success. As long as he could make music and pay the bills, he 
was happy.
When I lived in New York, I rented a guy’s bedroom. There was a shared 
bathroom and my kitchen was a hotplate that sat on my dresser. Two cots 
were lashed together to make something that resembled a full-sized bed. 
I was playing six nights a week in a band that was booked into the biggest 
rock rooms on Long Island. I wasn’t making a lot of money, but I had an 
absolute blast.
What about you? Where’s your threshold? You need to know whether 
you require a particular standard of living to enjoy the experience or can 
be just as happy with a bohemian lifestyle. Once again, there is no right or 
wrong answer. All that matters is that it’s a truthful one.

 What do you want out of your creative career? Luxurious digs and raving fans; the ability to 
do what you want at any moment in the day; or simply to have food, a bed, and an audience? 
It’s your choice, but it’s important to know what you want so that you’ll know when you’ve 
succeeded.
Up to now, we’ve been speaking in terms of full-time employment, but 
that’s not the only path to fulfilling creative work. The world is full of 
artistic souls who want the stability of a steady job, good insurance, and a 
nice house in the suburbs where they can raise a family.
You don’t have to choose between working for a major corporation and 
pursuing your creativity. In fact, one of my oldest friends is an excellent 
example. A talented musician, when I met him he was working full time at 
IBM. On the weekends, he played keyboards for one of the hottest soul 
bands in town. He got paid for both.
These days, he’s a project manager for a software company and is a happily 
married family man, something that he’d always wanted. He also travels 
the world as a freelance photographer, has written a book on gorillas and 
society in Central Africa, and just got back from New Guinea, where he 
was doing missionary work. No matter what your creative desires, trust 
me, you have options.
If you’re looking for part-time work, you have a different set of things to 
consider than do those who depend on their gigs to pay the bills. You’ll 
have much more flexibility in terms of income. Your creative revenue can 
be a supplement to increase your overall standard of living, or, if you’re 
already doing okay in your day job, it can be an extra bonus that you can 
spend on pure fun.
Life is ever the exercise in trade-offs, and part-time work is no exception. 
Even if you do not require top dollar or a minimum number of jobs per 
month, you will have to juggle a more complicated schedule. Right off the 
bat, if already you work a nine-to-five job, you’re limited in the additional 
days and hours that will available for taking on creative gigs. Whether 
you’re living with the love of your life, raising kids, or are just in the middle 
of a budding relationship, you’ll also find that people require time and 
attention. As you consider pursuing your creative fulfillment, you’ll also 
need to factor in how much of those things you’ll have time for.
Full or part time, it’s also worth doing a quick reality check on how much 
work is actually out there. If you’re an actor who wants to do nothing but 
the works of Shakespeare, you’ll doubtless find opportunities in a local 
theater no matter where you live. That might be enough to satisfy you if 
you’re only seeking part-time work. If you’re set on full-time employment, 

Chapter 4 | What Do You Want?
74
however, you may need to do extensive travel in order to work on a 
regular basis. If you’re not single, you have additional considerations. Some 
relationships can handle extended absence on a regular basis and remain 
strong. Others, not so much.
All of these factors contribute to the overall picture of your lifestyle. 
Once you have a firm grasp of what will make you happy, you’ll be in 
a position to consider the practical details of how to bring that dream 
to life. Knowing what you want out of life in terms of comfort, stability, 
travel, relationships, money, and all those other little details of the human 
experience gives you power. When you have a detailed understanding of 
your desires and their implications, the steps you need to take in order to 
achieve them become much clearer.
By the way, these are all things that I still think about on a regular basis. 
I’ve been fortunate enough to do a lot of creative things. However, as I 
mentioned earlier, there’s always that next mountain to climb, and so my 
self-examination never ends. Sometimes, in the midst of all this naval gaz-
ing, I experience a bit of blank-page syndrome.
I’ve found it helpful at such times to simply look at the world around me. 
From the scandalously wealthy to the part-time pole dancer, whatever 
you want to do, someone else has probably done it. Consequently, I draw 
inspiration from the lives of others. I may not take the exact same path, 
but there’s nothing like a real-world example to get you back on track.
The Perfect Gig
As you delve deeper into what you want, the questions become both 
more specific and easier to answer. Whether you’re looking for full- or 
part-time work, once you have a strong sense of what you want out of the 
experience, you can begin painting the picture.
If you’re a graphic artist, there are a wealth of opportunities for employ-
ment. Consequently, asking yourself whether you want to work as an 
employee or be self-employed is a sensible question. Other forms of cre-
ativity have a fuzzier picture when it comes to finding work.
If you’re a drummer who likes to play country and bluegrass, the thought 
of being an employee might seem inappropriate. Musicians tend to think 
of being an employee as sitting in rush-hour traffic en route to a day job. 
Nonetheless, if you play in a band, someone is responsible for paying you, 
even if it’s you.
A band can be a collaborative effort, which is much like a company with 
several partners. It can also be a sole proprietorship where one person 
who is in charge, books the gigs, and pays the players. Do you want to be 

Have Fun, Get Paid
75
a business partner, a sole proprietor, or an employee? We’re each suited 
for different roles. You won’t be happy unless you choose the one that’s 
right for you.
Once your position is clarified in your mind, it makes finding work that 
much easier, because you have a smaller and more well-defined set of 
considerations to manage. If you don’t want the responsibilities of being 
in charge, you can narrow your search to working with bands that have 
a strong leader, that are in need of a drummer, and that play the style of 
music you prefer. If you don’t like being a passenger but also don’t want 
the pressure of being the only guy to scare up the money, you can seek 
out a more collaborative experience. If you’re an alpha personality, you 
put the word out for players and start your own band.
No matter which option you choose, you’re now looking for the kind of 
work that will be gratifying for you. Because you know exactly what you’re 
looking for, it will also be much easier to find. At this point, we’ll circle 
back to the beginning of the thought process and once again ask, What is 
success?
Now that you have more details about what you want, you’re in a position 
to start visualizing the perfect scenario. While many of the principles we 
have considered are common to all artistic endeavors, at this point in the 
process the details will be very closely related to your specific art.
There is a very long list of creative disciplines. Some, like software devel-
opment or graphic design, seem so close to the business world as to 
appear at first glance to be more job than art. That’s an illusion, of course, 
as they’re first and foremost a way of expressing creativity and only mon-
etized as an additional consideration. Other arts have the exact opposite 
problem. If you love writing poetry, few would question its artistic merit 
but many would have difficulty seeing it as commercially viable.
In reality, they’re all art and they all have monetary potential. It’s worth 
reiterating that commercial enterprise is not the enemy of art, nor does 
it diminish its legitimacy. It’s simply a phrase that means you get paid for 
what you love to do. If you want money for your creation, that’s com-
merce. Those who pay the bills in such a manner will be quick to point 
out that when the rent comes due, commerce is indeed your friend.
Now that you know the type of work you want to do, how much income 
you need, and the lifestyle adjustments you’re willing to make, you can 
start thinking about the types of gigs you would like to do at this point in 
your career.
If you’re a graphic artist, you may be able to work in the digital domain, 
the physical, or both. Chances are good that you’ll have some prefer-
ences. Some will pursue work on comic books and graphic novels. Others 

Chapter 4 | What Do You Want?
76
will sell their creations as an entrepreneur. Another group will interact 
with the corporate world, designing graphics for software and the Web as 
either a full-time employee or a freelance artist.
These are just a few of the options, but it gives you an idea of how to look 
at your own situation. Artistic people seem to come factory equipped 
with blinders preinstalled. If I love this, everything else must therefore 
suck. I’ve fallen prey to this thinking myself in earlier years, but over time 
I found that it was limiting.
It’s a very helpful thing to take a couple of steps back and view your entire 
artistic discipline, not just the subset of it that you’re currently obsessed 
with, and give each little subsection a closer look. If you can do so with 
an open mind, you might be surprised to find additional areas of interest 
and opportunity that will expand both your artistic expression and your 
bank account.
I’m a hippie musician who came of age in the 1970s and ’80s. We’re 
all heavily influenced by the cultural tides that are prevalent when we’re 
young adults. The 1970s was a period of spiritual seeking. In the 1980s, we 
just wanted to have fun. In that decade, I also spent time teaching sales and 
found a love of helping people improve their lives as a result. Just before 
the 1990s showed up, I discovered software development. I found that 
creative process to be very similar to tales I’d heard of heroin addiction. 
It also allowed me to sneak into the corporate world through the side 
door. All of these experiences have left an indelible mark on who I am as 
a creative creature.
In addition to my love of rock-and-roll, I’m also a writer. When I first 
started putting pen to paper, my head was still wrapped up in spiritual 
seeking, the quest for the meaning of life. Consequently, that was the only 
kind of writing I wanted to do. It didn’t matter if I possessed talent for 
any other form. I simply wasn’t interested. Had you asked me to write a 
business book, I would have run screaming out of the room covering my 
ears.
When the dial flipped to the year 2000, I’d been paying the bills for quite 
some time in the world of software. It was fun, but I was looking for addi-
tional things to do, so I thought I’d try writing books. As a working-class 
programmer, I had some street cred in that area. However, most software 
books are essentially geek manuals that teach you the bits and bytes of 
how to use a particular technology. Yuck. That might be fun for some, but 
it sounded like factory work to me.
About that time, one of my geek friends was running a very popular Web 
site for programmers and asked me to write a column, not about the 
bits and bytes but about the business, the people, and the real-world 
aspects of managing a career. He also said he would be paying for me 

Have Fun, Get Paid
77
to be the wise ass that he knew me to be. Who could refuse? Writing 
those columns led to writing my first book, The Career Programmer, which 
addressed those very things along with occasional references to the night 
watchman’s attack Chihuahua.
A couple of years later, I wrote the first edition of Unite the Tribes, which is 
a book on leadership and thus spoke to the corporate world. Both Career 
Programmer and Unite the Tribes came after my experiences of teaching 
sales, working in software development, witnessing the mind-numbing stu-
pidity of many corporations, and other such adventures.
In the 1970s and ’80s, I would not have enjoyed writing a book that taught 
geeks how to survive their career or leaders how to bring out the best 
in their people. I wanted to write about spiritual seeking. All you need is 
love, yeah, yeah, yeah. I still had the mindset that what I wanted to do was 
good, and therefore everything else sucked. As the years went by, I began 
to see life through a wide-angle lens and because of that, I’ve had some fun 
creative experiences. I’d still love to know the meaning of life, and it would 
be great if all we needed was love, but I’m no longer constrained to that 
perspective. Today, I enjoy the practical side of life as much as the artistic, 
and I have a much wider range of opportunities that I enjoy as a result.
 View life through a wide-angle lens that brings in other views and perspectives. New opportunities 
are bound to come your way as your interests evolve.
It’s very likely that your interests will evolve and expand as you go through 
life. Because of this, it’s worth taking a step back and reaching for the 
wide-angle lens. The things you weren’t interested in a decade ago may 
now have newfound appeal. With every new aspect of your art form that 
you embrace comes new opportunity. That means a wider range of gigs 
to choose from.
You also have more flexibility. Today you can spend time in the studio as 
a painter. Tomorrow you can design a logo for a big corporation. On the 
weekend you can work on graphic novels. You don’t have to be just one 
thing, and neither do your gigs. All that truly matters is that you know 
which types of jobs you enjoy. From there, the opportunities become 
much more obvious.
How Badly Do You Want It?
Although we’ve been considering what you want, that’s not the whole 
story. It doesn’t matter what type of creativity you’re drawn to. You’re 

Chapter 4 | What Do You Want?
78
going to have lots of competition. The room was crowded enough before 
the days of a global computer network. Now, thanks to the Internet, you 
compete for work with every other person on the planet. Regardless of 
how you define success, it’s not going to just fall in your lap. You’re not 
only going to have to work for it, you’re going to have to work very, very 
hard. This is not an arena for the faint of heart.
If you want to get paid, you’re going to have to step outside of your com-
fort zone. It’s not enough for you to sit back, do the fun artistic things, 
and expect someone else to make the work magically appear. You have to 
actively engage, or that work will go to someone who does. This brings 
up an entirely new set of things for you to consider as you contemplate 
your naval.
If you found considering the topic of validation uncomfortable, you may 
also find our next foray into self-examination difficult. They’re deceptively 
easy to answer until you dig deep and commit yourself to total honesty. 
They fall into another one of those areas where parroting what you think 
is expected of you won’t be of much use. That’s because you won’t just be 
answering questions. You’ll also be making commitments.
Building a career of any description requires effort above and beyond 
improving your creative skills. How many hours a week are you willing to 
work at it? For most of us, doing all that businesslike stuff of beating the 
bushes and looking for work is unappealing to say the least. Without that 
effort, however, you simply won’t get any results. No pain, no gain.
You need to be honest with yourself about how hard, and how consis-
tently, you’re willing to work on the noncreative side of things. Only then 
can you put together a plan of action based on reality, which is the only 
kind that ever succeeds. If you tell yourself that you’ll spend four hours a 
night, five days a week, to address the career aspects of your art and base 
your strategy on that, what happens when you find that you can barely 
force yourself to spend two hours once a week?
It’s not just the total amount of hours that will be affected. In planning, 
things often depend on the step that was taken before. Remove those 
steps and your world becomes chaos. A plan based on two hours a week, 
consistently executed, is far more effective than ambitions of twenty 
hours' worth of work that never gets done.
In addition to the amount of effort, you need to think about your capac-
ity for enduring rejection. When you’re out there trying to make things 
happen, you’re going to hear no nine times for every one yes that you get. 
Rule number one of sales is developing the ability to build a wall around 
your emotions that you can erect at will. If you can’t do this, each and 
every no is going to hurt.

Have Fun, Get Paid
79
We’re all capable of building this barrier. Even so, some defenses will be 
stronger than others. Consequently, you need to have a realistic under-
standing of how much work you’re willing to put into building a thick skin 
and how effective it will be. This will then tell you how much rejection you 
can endure without being damaged. Plans based on a realistic evaluation 
of this will subject you to no more than you can handle, and thus you’ll be 
able to execute them consistently over the long haul.
You’ll also have to endure other discomforts and sacrifices. While I’ve 
slept on more than a few floors in my life, I’m not a big fan of suffering for 
my art. I don’t believe that it’s a requirement. However, if I want something 
bad enough, I’ll put up with some inconveniences, up to a point. That said, 
I have my limits. Do you know what yours are? You may have to live on 
less money, sleep in less-than-optimal surroundings, and give up time with 
family and friends. That’s just the short list, of course. The pursuit of cre-
ativity comes with no shortage of potential discomforts.
As with your capacity for rejection, you need to have a firm and honest 
understanding of exactly what you’re willing to endure for the sake of 
your dreams. It doesn’t matter if the guy down the street gets all macho 
and belittles you because your efforts aren’t as Herculean as his. You are 
two different people. What works for him may be a disaster for you. On 
the other hand, if you each approach your career in harmony with your 
nature, you’ll each make solid and consistent progress.
As you evaluate your capabilities and boundaries, you’ll also need to weigh 
the trade-offs. Paying jobs mean expectations. The person paying you gets 
to call the shots. Sometimes you’ll both be on the same page. Other 
times you’ll have to make artistic compromises in order to secure the 
work. Where you draw that line is an individual matter. Greater freedom 
of expression often means less opportunity for income. It doesn’t matter 
whether freedom or expression is more important to you, only that you 
know where the line is so that you can be happy with the work you get.
Job security is a closely related consideration. It’s difficult to verbally 
describe a cartoon, but I think this one is worth it. In the very early years 
of the cartoon strip, Garfield appears in an animal shelter as the masked 
avenger, there to rescue the poor, captive animals. As he throws the cage 
doors open, he proclaims, “You’re free! You’re free!” The animals all cling 
to the inside of their cages in terror. He then observes that they must 
not be terribly into freedom these days and proceeds to slam all the cage 
doors shut, reassuring them, “You’re secure! You’re secure!” One person’s 
castle is another’s cage. Do you know which yours is?
We touched on relationships in the context of travel a bit earlier, but 
romance occupies an entire area all its own. Having a husband, wife, boy-
friend, or girlfriend is challenging enough as it is. Were that not the case, 

Chapter 4 | What Do You Want?
80
everyone on the planet would be living happily ever after even as we 
speak. If you’re passionate about your creativity, you’re going to dedicate 
a significant portion of your life to its pursuit. That can leave the person 
you love feeling a little left out.
 Because the pursuit of art often creates conflict with loved ones, many creatives avoid both 
serious relationships and raising children. You don’t have to sacrifice one for the other, but know 
that a balanced life requires hard work. Be prepared to put in your fair share.
I’m the poster child for this particular mistake. I’ve been deeply immersed 
in my creative projects my entire adult life. While there was a brief period 
in the early rock-and-roll days when I lived with promiscuous abandon, 
I’m really a one girl kinda guy. And I’ve had serious, long-term relation-
ships with some really great girls at that. Lots of them. In other words, I’m 
apparently not very good at balancing the creative drive with the needs 
of another real, live human being. Whatever value they might find in me, 
there’s very little of it if I’m not around.
If you think meeting the needs of one person is a challenge, you can imag-
ine what happens if you’re raising a family. That takes things to an entirely 
new level. The person you fell in love with might understand. The kids 
won’t, nor should they. They are completely dependent on their parents, 
both physically and emotionally.
As with creative compromise, there is a line to be drawn in terms of 
relationships. Whether it’s closer to the creativity or to the romance 
is a personal matter, but you’d better know where that line is or you’ll 
experience one emotional disaster after another. Of course, for the mar-
ried-with-children crowd, decisions regarding the raising of small human 
creatures transcend the domain of preference and enter the realm of 
responsibility.
Knowing my nature, I made a decision very early in life to not have chil-
dren. When I was young, people just assumed that I’d grow out of it, but 
I was quite serious. As a middle-aged man, I still feel the same way and 
know that it was the correct decision for me. That said, if you think such 
a choice limits your opportunities for interaction with the females of the 
species, you’re not far from the truth.
We all learn, evolve, and grow as the years go by. There are also aspects of 
our nature that are likely to remain constant. I know who I am, and being 
a creative creature isn’t something I can turn on and off at the flick of a 
switch. Would I like to find true love and artistic gratification all rolled into 

Have Fun, Get Paid
81
one? You bet. And I’m not dead yet, so I haven’t given up on that dream. 
As I plan on ways to do that, however, I remain unflinchingly honest with 
myself about my art, my nature, and the consequences for relationships. 
Only when you’re truthful with yourself in these matters can you chart a 
course that won’t put you at the bottom of the ocean.
If you’re driven by a creative urge that won’t be denied, you’re going to 
have to work hard to have a successful career at it, whether you’re a 
weekend warrior or a full-time artist. It’s going to require a great many 
compromises and hard decisions, forcing you to take a close look at your 
priorities and to plan based on reality rather than wishful thinking. I’ve had 
a great time with life thus far, and it only looks to be getting better. You 
can, too, but only if you’re willing to do the hard stuff.
You Gotta Believe
Some of the things I’ve pointed out might sound a bit discouraging. At the 
very least, I’ve advocated a lot of hard work and urged you to delve into 
areas that may well be outside of your comfort zone. There are people 
who create because it’s a passing interest, and there are those who are 
simply wired that way, unable to be anything but the creative creatures 
that they are. If you fall into the former camp, all this truth-and-conse-
quences talk may scare the pants off of you. If that’s the case, there’s no 
need for you to stop doing the expressive things that you love, but you 
should definitely stay out of the career end of the pool. It gets deep in a 
hurry, and there are no lifeguards on duty.
On the other hand, if your DNA is indelibly stamped with the mark of the 
artist, leaving you no happiness in life without the pursuit of your dreams, 
you’re in luck. You don’t need a lifeguard. Swimming really isn’t that hard 
to learn.
Of all the things we’ve evaluated thus far, the one thing I haven’t men-
tioned is belief. It’s a word that gets interpreted in many ways. Some 
consider it to be akin to faith, accepting a precept in the absence of proof. 
Others view it as a matter of self-confidence. I would imagine there are 
a number of other perspectives as well. If you’re trying to work in your 
chosen field, I think they all apply.
Without a doubt, you have to believe in yourself. Those who lack your 
talent will often try to tear you down, driven by their own insecurities and 
inadequacies. Others will tell you to give up on your dreams and pursue 
a nice, safe, predictable life where the bar is set much lower. They’ll do it 
out of love and concern for your future, but it’s a limitation just the same. 

Chapter 4 | What Do You Want?
82
You’ll have competing talents in addition to the person holding any pay-
ing work telling you that you’re not good enough. You may also have the 
landlord telling you that you’re out at the end of the month unless you 
cough up the rent. Without self-confidence, these forces will grind you 
into a very fine powder.
Perhaps that’s where faith comes in. Whatever your belief system, from 
the pragmatic scientist who looks out the window and sees billions of 
galaxies to the spiritual person who bonds with forces yet unseen, some-
times you just have to have a little faith that things will somehow work 
out for the best.
 Assume things will work out. The more you believe they will, the more effort you’ll put into 
bringing your dreams to life. Optimism and practicality are an unstoppable combination.
I don’t pretend to understand the mysteries of life. The closest I’m likely 
to get to explaining the larger forces that surround us is by quoting Yoda. 
All I know is that there have been many times in my life when the only 
thing that kept me going was the irrational belief that I was going to 
somehow land on my feet. The fact that I did can be attributed to many 
factors, but one thing is certain. Without a little faith, I would have just 
given up, thus guaranteeing failure. If a Jedi master would like to drop by 
and explain why it all worked, I’ll have the tea kettle waiting. In the mean-
time, I’m just going to keep the faith. When things get crazy, it’s the only 
thing that keeps me sane.
Being a creative creature is a wonderful experience. You’ll also be delighted 
to know that the overwhelming majority of your competitors out there 
don’t want to know anything at all about this pesky business and career 
stuff. That means you’re in a much stronger position than you realize. It is 
absolutely possible to build a solid and gratifying career doing what you 
love. You just have to know what you want. And you gotta believe.

Think Like  
a Start-Up
You are not a ballerina. You are not a programmer. You are not a poet. You are 
a start-up company. If you want money, that pesky little substance required 
by all who wish to pay the bills, you have to think like a business.
There is no word in the English language that generates fear and loathing 
in the hearts of creative creatures the way business does. For some, it is 
the antithesis of everything they believe in artistically. For such deluded 
(and typically broke) souls, the domain of commerce is devoid of passion 
and meaning. In it, they see nothing but cold, hard cash and the transac-
tions that generate it, a world lacking both beauty and art.
In defense of the artistically pure, it’s true that the titans of industry are 
concerned first and foremost with profitability, not art. That said, if you 
can’t bring yourself to deal with the realities of the business world, then 
you will forever be a hobbyist, someone whose creativity is an expense 
rather than a source of revenue.
There is nothing wrong with having a creative hobby. Personally, I think 
the world would be a better place if every man, woman, and child on the 
planet had one. However, my audience is not the hobbyist but rather the 
creative person who wishes to pay all or some of her bills through her 
expressive talents. You simply can’t do that without intersecting with the 
business world.
While I’m defending things here, I’d also like to point out, as I have earlier, 
that money is not evil. True, some people do evil things to acquire it and 
others use it to achieve unethical results. There are also people who do 
terrible things with hammers.

C H A P T E R 

Chapter 5 | Think Like a Start-Up 
84
I once knew a construction worker who was a bit on the rowdy side and 
prone to getting in bar fights. When he went drinking, he’d wear his tool 
belt, which included a hammer hanging from a convenient loop. If you 
think that the common hammer can’t be employed with devastating effect, 
I’d like to remind you that it was Thor’s weapon of choice.
If you do bad things with construction tools, they’re going to put you 
in jail. I will nonetheless be an ardent supporter of hammers everywhere. 
People used them to build my house. In a similar fashion, money can be the 
cause or the tool of evil. If you do bad things with it, or to obtain it, they 
will lock you up. That’s not going to stop me from utilizing it as a beneficial 
resource. Simply put, if you have hang-ups about money or business, get 
over it or get used to being broke. You have no other options.
Fortunately, if you can manage to get past the twitch factor of interact-
ing with the business world, the rest is fairly straightforward. In fact, once 
you’ve realigned your perspective, you’ll find that the pursuit of business 
is a creative art in its own right. All of those products and services that 
you enjoy didn’t just spontaneously appear in a puff of smoke, although I’m 
sure the marketing department would be delighted were that the case.
What you’re holding in your hands right now started out as an idea. I’m 
not talking about my words but rather the physical medium you’re expe-
riencing them through. Perhaps it’s a printed book, but it could just as 
easily be a desktop computer, a dedicated e-Reader, a pad, a music player, 
or even your cell phone. Products start with imagination, but the creative 
process continues until it’s something tangible.
When you want to build an audience for something, whether it’s a new 
product or a dance recital, you have to find a way of getting people’s atten-
tion. A huge amount of creativity goes into that. Why do you think the 
people on Wall Street spend billions of dollars annually to hire creative 
entities like the Madison Avenue advertising agencies? Devising a strategy 
to build your audience, secure more gigs, and advance your career is great 
fun in its own right once you see it for the blank canvas that it is.
As long as all you think about is art, all you’ll get is art. If you want money, 
you have to think like a business. The two are not mutually exclusive. You 
can, and should, do both. Whether you’re just getting started or have been 
in the game for a while, the best mindset you can adopt is that of the start-
up company. They always have the most innovative thinkers because they 
have to elbow their way into a crowded landscape and convince people that 
they’re worth considering.

Start-ups are also an excellent source of inspiration. Apple is one of the 
richest companies in the world. It started out as a couple of guys in a 
garage. The industry-dominating player it was up against was IBM.  Think 
about that the next time you complain about having a hard time getting 
work because the competition is too tough.
You Are the Product
Apple started out selling computers. That was its product, and that’s the 
way most businesses are run. The product or service is separate from 
the people who run the company, unless of course you happen to be a 
hooker.
For most of the creative arts, the abstraction between product and pur-
veyor doesn’t exist. If you’re a performing artist, you are the product. Even 
if you’re a graphic artist or fashion designer, there’s a deep emotional 
connection between you and the product. In a very real sense, it’s an 
extension of you.
This is why so many talented people freeze like Bambi in the glare of a 
freight train’s headlamp when the topic of business comes up. In the previ-
ous chapter, we talked a bit about the individual need for validation and 
how fragile that area of the personality can be. It’s very similar to what it 
feels like to sell yourself as a product. Our lively and confident ladies of the 
evening have made peace with this, but for the rest of us it can be an awk-
ward and uncomfortable experience.
The artistic world is no stranger to huge egos and arrogance powerful 
enough to launch a probe to Mars. As often as not, these qualities are 
usually attached to those who merit them the least, and we tend to view 
those people as shallow, phony blowhards. Most of us are more sparing 
with self-praise. In fact, because so many of the egotistical come across as 
fools, the last thing we want is to look like them.
Even if that weren’t an issue, we must each do battle with our personal 
demons and dragons, who most often appear as a less-than-accurate 
self-image. It doesn’t matter how many times you stand on stage and hear 
the crowd roar. If you don’t believe you’re really all that talented, the 
audience isn’t going to convince you otherwise.
In the world of business, you start with a product and then proceed to 
promote it. This means that we, as creative creatures, must in effect stand 
on a platform and tell people why we’re great. For most of us, myself 
included, that can be an uncomfortable experience.

If the audience approves of what I do and applauds, that’s appreciated. If 
they tell their friends the next day that they heard me speak and it was 
great, I’m okay with that. If someone writes a review and says they enjoyed 
a book I wrote, I’m grateful.
These are all forms of promotion in their own way. The only difference 
is who’s doing it. If you say something nice about my art, I can graciously 
accept it. If I say it about my own work, I sound like a pompous jackass. At 
least that’s what it feels like to me, and I know I’m not the only person who 
experiences this.
 Your art, whatever it is, won’t sell unless you promote it. It’s as simple as that. So suck it up and 
get on with it. As you get better at it, you’ll start to make money doing what you love, at which 
point you’ll enjoy the marketing more as well. Success is always fun.
Nonetheless, if I play in a band, I’m expected to spread the word. If I’m 
speaking at an event, part of my job is to bring in a larger audience. If I 
write a book, it’s my responsibility to do interviews, sign books, and anything 
else that would help both me and my publisher succeed. I am the prod-
uct. Waving my own banner feels egotistical. On the other hand, a very 
fundamental rule of business is that products do not sell without promo-
tion. Therefore, if I want to make money with my art, I have to suck it 
up and do my part with the hopes that people will see what I’m doing as 
spreading the word about something I believe in rather than an exercise 
in self-aggrandizement.
Tech Start-Ups Are a Great Example
Once you’ve done enough naval gazing to get over the twitch factor that 
inevitably comes with self-promotion, it’s time to start thinking like a 
start-up. I have a natural bias toward the tech industry since I’ve spent 
so many years in that world. These days, though, you don’t need to be a 
professional techie to be included in that sphere of influence.
Most of us spend at least a little time on the Internet and with our com-
puters and mobile devices. We’ve heard of the dot-com boom and bust, 
where fortunes were made and lost in the gold-rush atmosphere of the 
early Internet craze. Because of this, the notion of a tech start-up is more 
familiar to us than the inner workings of IBM would have been to the 
average creative person fifty years ago.

Even though Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak started Apple in a garage, 
they’re not the best example of a modern start-up for our purposes. 
They were in the hardware business. The geeks who launched a thousand 
Web sites, on the other hand, were in the software business. Both are 
technical and have their challenges, but software in many ways is a much 
easier business to launch.
I can sit at home in my bunny slippers and create a Web site with nothing 
more than my computer and a text editor. In fact, I have done so on many 
occasions. Were I to have hardware ambitions, I would be faced with not 
only the design but also the expense of supplies and manufacturing, the 
logistics of shipping and order fulfillment, and a great many other compli-
cations. If there were a design flaw, I wouldn’t be able to just push a new 
version of the product to the Internet. I’d have to throw away physical 
products and pay to build them again.
Of the two, software development is much closer to the nontechnical arts 
such as music or dance. You have an idea. You do it. You build an audi-
ence. You get rich and retire to an island in the Caribbean.
In fact, that’s the desired career trajectory of those who launch a tech 
start-up. The goal is to get rich through their artistic talents. They start 
with a vision and bring together the creative creatures they need to bring 
it to life. More importantly, they understand that their audience isn’t going 
to create itself.
The successful entrepreneur knows that a business venture like this is a 
team sport. It requires software developers, graphic artists and design-
ers, writers, testers, and others to build the product. It then requires an 
equally diverse and talented group of people to market and promote that 
product so that customers will be willing to spend money on it.
Once sales are happening and money is rolling in, there is also a need for 
accountants, administrative personnel, customer service reps, and others 
to support the infrastructure. Put it all together and you have a business 
with a good shot at growth.
Depending on your artistic discipline, you likely won’t have even a tiny 
fraction of this staff at your disposal. Instead, you’ll be wearing many of 
these hats yourself and delegating the others to people you contract with 
for the task.
For example, I don’t employ a marketing rep or hire a PR firm. I teach 
myself how to do those things. On the other hand, no way am I going to 
do my own taxes each year. If it was just me working a salaried job and 
filling out a 1040, I’d be fine with it. Since I run a small business, I have 
both corporate and personal tax returns to file. I don’t want to become 
an expert in corporate tax law, but I do want to stay straight with the IRS. 

Chapter 5 | Think Like a Start-Up 
88
Consequently, each year I call my accountant, give him the appropriate 
paperwork, and pay him to do the job for me so that I know it’s right the 
first time.
Like any successful entrepreneur, you’ll need to assess the various jobs 
that need to be done and then put some thought into how to accomplish 
the work. Since artists are rarely flush with spare cash, it’s in your best 
interest to make use of the many educational resources at your disposal 
and learn to do everything you can yourself. If you hit a wall and simply 
don’t have the skills to do a job, allocate a portion of the money you make 
to hiring someone qualified who can. Think of it as just the cost of doing 
business.
Tech Start-Ups Are a Terrible Example
Everything I’ve just said about the world of geek enterprise is true, at least 
for some companies. Tech start-ups are also the worst possible examples 
you can follow. In order to truly appreciate the folly of their business 
practices, let me give you a quick overview of the landscape and a little 
background.
There are a great many reasons that the dot-com crash happened at the 
turn of the century, but there was a central theme to it, which, surpris-
ingly, lives on even today. Even though the Internet, being nothing more 
than a global computer network, had been around for decades, it was only 
in the 1990s that it hit the public consciousness. When it did, everyone 
proclaimed it to be the way of the future and countless people rushed off, 
mining tools in hand, to make their fortune on this new frontier.
Because it looked like there was serious money to be made, venture capi-
talists were investing wildly in anything that even smelled like a Web site. 
For those who don’t know, a venture capitalist is someone who invests 
money in your start-up in return for partial, though often massive, ownership 
in your company. From a business point of view, it’s legalized gambling.
If you look up venture capitalist in the dictionary, you’ll see a picture of a 
shark. They are often involved in highly predatory operations. However, 
in a rather karmic turn of events, the shark, in this case, ended up being 
the prey.
The model for a Web site start-up, both in the midst of the dot-com craze 
and today, is simple. A developer has an idea for a cool site. It’s new. It’s 
shiny. It sounds like something people would want to use. However, devel-
opers need to pay the rent, so they go in search of someone to invest in 
this great idea. That’s where our fin-wearing friends come in.

89
The idea might be a social-media site, a new way to share pictures, a blog-
ging platform, or anything else that sounds popular. Everyone agrees that 
yes, this is very exciting. The masses will love it. Invariably, the plan is to 
launch as a free service to build an audience. The investors invest. The 
developers develop. Ultimately, the product is launched.
I know it’s impolite to give spoilers, but I’m going to tell you how the 
story ends. The audience grows. The developers burn through the cash. 
There’s still more to do, so the investors pony up more money. This goes 
on for as many cycles as the money men are stupid enough to tolerate. 
Eventually, someone wakes up and discovers that there’s no clear path to 
monetization. That’s business speak for, “Whoops, we forgot to figure out 
how to make money with this.” The company goes out of business. The 
developers move on to the next sucker. The venture capitalists write the 
loss off on their tax returns. The audience they built is left out in the cold. 
Rinse and repeat.
In simpler terms, these people have decided to create something that’s 
very cool from an artistic point of view. They immerse themselves in the 
process of bringing it to life. Finally, they come up for air, proud of what 
they’ve created, only to face the harsh reality that no one has the slightest 
idea of how to make money with it. This is very much like putting a polka 
band together, rehearsing for a year, and then realizing that there’s not a 
bar in town that wants to hear a polka.
 Before you plunk down your hard-earned money to launch a business, be absolutely certain 
there is a market for your offering. Even really smart money lenders forget this part.
You should take the best from the world of tech start-ups, but there’s 
also great value to learning from their worst. If I walk down the same unlit 
street each night, it would be useful to know where the potholes are. If 
I break my ankle by stumbling into one, I gain this information the hard 
way. If I see the guy in front of me break his, I learn the same thing, but 
without the pain. With apologies to my now-limping friend, better him 
than me. Experience is the best teacher. That doesn’t mean it has to be 
your experience.
Business Plans
If you reach a point where your career is doing well and you really want 
to take it to the next level, there is no end to the educational resources 
at your disposal to help you become a better businessperson. To get you 

Chapter 5 | Think Like a Start-Up

started, however, let’s take a tour of the basics. This won’t earn you an 
MBA, but it will get you thinking about the various career options you 
have and how best to approach them.
A business plan sounds very official, and in fact gets tossed around quite 
a bit by the MBA crowd, usually over expensive martinis. (The people 
eavesdropping from the next table are probably venture capitalists.) In 
reality, a business plan is exactly what it sounds like—a plan for running a 
business. From that perspective, it’s not really that intimidating, is it?
Since you are your own business, you need a plan. To start with, you need 
to know what path you’re taking. There are three basic options. As an 
employee, you work for a company and are provided with a fixed salary. 
Depending on the kind of company, you may also receive benefits such as 
health insurance. Taxes are withheld by the employer, and at the end of 
the year the money is applied to the taxes you owe Uncle Sam. You may 
break even or pay a little extra, or you could get a refund.
The next option is working as an independent contractor. You do a job, 
you’re paid for the job and you’re done. Maybe they hire you again, maybe 
not. It’s up to you to find gigs and set your prices so that it’s a profitable 
experience. Any expenses you incur are yours to bear, so what you get 
paid isn’t necessarily what you take home. Additionally, while you’re still 
responsible for taxes each year, no one manages that for you. It’s your 
responsibility to put a portion of each dollar earned into savings so you 
can pay the tax man when the bill comes due. The IRS doesn’t want to 
hear that the dog ate your checkbook.
A more fully realized version of the independent contractor is running a 
full-on business. You may do this as a sole proprietor or with partners. 
The number of employees you have is also a variable. While there may 
be a few more moving parts, conceptually this is just an extension of con-
tracting. You offer products and services, you pay your expenses, you pay 
your taxes, and you keep the profits.
Technically, working for someone as an employee isn’t a business. I’ve 
listed it among three possible business plans because at a higher level 
we’re looking at the three major categories of making a living. Each of 
these has benefits and challenges. What’s important is choosing the one 
that’s the best fit for you. A high-paying job that sucks is still a job that 
sucks. A lesser-paying job that’s a joy to do makes for a happy life. I’m 
going to make a stretch here and assume we’re going for happiness. With 
that in mind, let’s take a more detailed look at your options.

In many arts, this is the most stable and safe approach. You get up each 
day, go to work, go home after it’s time to clock out, and get paid on 
a regular basis. Managing your finances is greatly simplified because you 
know how much money you can count on each month. If you get benefits 
like health insurance, they’ll typically cost you a great deal less than they 
would were you to pay for them yourself. Best of all in the minds of many 
is the fact that you don’t have to do any marketing. You just show up and 
do your thing. Keeping the business profitable is someone else’s problem.
There are also trade-offs. The same sense of security that gives you peace 
of mind can feel like a prison to some. You’re told when to be at work, 
when you can leave, how much time you can take for lunch, and even how 
you should dress. If that’s not enough to make you twitch, you’ll also have 
much less artistic freedom in the work you do. You’re working for some-
one else and consequently it’s their vision, not yours, that takes precedent. 
If you choose a company that’s in line with your own vision, there may 
be very little conflict in this area. Choose poorly and it can be extremely 
frustrating.
It’s also worth mentioning that job security is an illusion. In the mid-1900s, 
it was common to go to work for a company, spend your entire career 
there, get a gold watch when you retired, and then live out the rest of 
your life with a decent pension provided for you.
Today’s world is much more volatile. Companies are constantly going out 
of business or buying each other, with many people losing their jobs in 
either scenario. Even in a business that’s relatively stable, it’s not at all 
uncommon to see corporate reorganizations or other such sleazy tricks 
designed to get rid of people before a pension has to be paid out. The 
days of the gold watch are largely behind us.
Expensive wrist jewelry notwithstanding, life as a salaried employee can 
be a good gig as long as you keep your eye on the weather and make sure 
you’ve already secured a new job before the storm hits your old one. 
Commonsense is your friend no matter what career path you choose.
Employment opportunities are more common for some creative arts than 
they are others. If you’re a dancer or musician, you’ll be looking for media 
and entertainment oriented companies, and there are not as many of 
those around as there are businesses selling widgets.
Graphic artists and software developers have a wealth of opportunities, 
not just in the tech sector but in the corporate world at large. Most 
companies need marketing materials and other image-building artwork. A 
great many also have internal software systems, even if software isn’t the 
business they’re in.

Chapter 5 | Think Like a Start-Up 
92
There are also openings for creative arts that you might not normally con-
sider business oriented. For example, if you’re a poet, you might assume 
that you’re destined to spend your life in hip coffeehouses working for 
tips. What you don’t realize is that every marketing department in the 
world depends on the cleverly written word.
It’s also worth noting that should you choose the employee path, it’s not a 
decision you’re locked into for life. You can change careers as many times 
as you like. There are no rules.
 Taking a job with an organization doesn’t have to be “Prison with pay.” You can get out whenever 
you’d like and do something else, with more money in your pocket for the experience. Four walls 
can also be enjoyable if they surround a good vibe.
Hired Guns
In the corporate world, they refer to temp workers as contractors. 
Another common term for this sort of work is freelancing. Either way, it 
means the same thing. It’s your responsibility to find the work, and you’re 
the one who negotiates the compensation.
This is a life of much greater freedom than the salaried employee. As you 
would expect, this means a life of less security, at least in terms of a guar-
antee. When a client hires you to do a job, you have a source of revenue 
for just that gig. The life of a successful freelancer is built on reputation 
and relationships. Do a good job and you’re the very first call that the cli-
ent will make when there’s more work. Generate positive word-of-mouth 
and that same client will also tell her friends to hire you. You can’t pre-
dict how much money you’ll make each month like you can as a salaried 
employee, but when you do it right, the pay is every bit as steady.
As a freelancer, you also have the ability to build a large client base. An 
employee has to put all his eggs in one basket. As a rule, people only work 
one full-time job and most companies take a dim view of you skipping 
work a few days a week so that you can make money with someone else. 
A contractor, on the other hand, is expected to have multiple clients. In 
fact, the more you have, the higher your perceived value as long as you’re 
giving each one the attention he deserves. After all, if that many people 
are hiring you, you must be good at what you do.
Another benefit of working as a mercenary is freedom from petty office 
politics. You’ll find that most of this gossip and currying of favor is driven 
by individual ambition. Since you’re not trying to climb the corporate lad-
der, you don’t have a dog in that fight. This allows you to quietly opt out 

Have Fun, Get Paid
93
of much of the negativity and backstabbing that you encounter. A word of 
warning, though. It’s wise to sleep with one eye open whether you have a 
stake in the politics or not. You’re just as dead from collateral damage as 
you are from an intentional strike.
Of course, along with these benefits comes the responsibility for putting 
food on the table. You’re the one who has to look for work. While you 
may get a referral from clients here and there, those who do well with 
this approach aren’t passive about it. Rather than sitting back and waiting 
for the work to roll in, they’re actively engaging their clients, asking if they 
have any friends, whether or not they’ve heard of new projects, and in 
general doing all they can to generate the referral.
The efforts required to market your services can run the gamut. At one 
extreme, you’ll find yourself doing everything the average small business 
does, including such things as advertising, generating media coverage, per-
forming search engine optimization to drive more traffic to your Web site, 
and a host of other such tasks.
Depending on your skill set, you may have additional marketing options. 
Many industries have a healthy pool of recruiting agencies whose sole 
purpose in life is matching up contractors with the companies who need 
them. Generally speaking, they bill the company, receive the payment, and 
then pay you after taking a cut for their efforts. Sometimes they’ll work 
for a percentage that’s discussed up-front. In other cases, such as gigs that 
are paid by the hour, they’ll negotiate your hourly rate, bill the company a 
higher rate, and make their money on the margin.
If the fixed-percentage scenario sounds a lot like a booking agent, you’re 
right on target. Either of these can be a good source of work for you. If 
you go with this approach, it’s important to look at things with the proper 
perspective. I’ve known a great many people who get snippy about the cut 
their agency is taking. Unless you’re flat out getting screwed, which is very 
rarely the case, this attitude is both unprofessional and stupid.
The rules of engagement were well defined when you signed up. Whining 
about it afterward makes you look like an irresponsible amateur. As for 
stupidity, chances are good you’re going to want a gig when the current 
one is complete. Do you really think they’re going to work with you again 
if all you did the last time was behave in a petulant and resentful manner? 
These folks need to make a living just like you, and they provide a valuable 
service. They’ve earned their money.
Personally, I love paying commissions. If someone’s charging me 20 per-
cent, the remaining 80 percent is money that fell into my lap. I didn’t have 
to chase it. The gig came to me. Don’t like the cut they want? Everything 

Chapter 5 | Think Like a Start-Up 
94
in life is negotiable. If you left money on the table because you haven’t 
bothered to refine your skills, that’s your fault, not theirs. If you don’t like 
the offer, don’t say yes. If you agree to the arrangement, take it and be 
happy. Should you find out later that you could’ve made more, don’t be 
negative about it. Be grateful for both the job and the education, and next 
time bargain a little harder. It’s allowed.
In addition to marketing, you’re also on the hook for any other paperwork 
that’s required to keep your contracting business in a legitimate state. 
You might want to set up a simple business entity so that you can keep 
your company and personal checking accounts separate and more easily 
manage your funds. It will also be easier to manage legitimate businesses 
expenses by paying through the company and keeping those receipts sep-
arate from your personal purchases.
 If you go the solo route, it might be wise to set up a simple business entity. (Talk to an accountant 
or advisor about which might be best in your situation.) Then, open a checking account for the 
business. Pay all bills and deposit all receipts into this account. A little work up-front will save 
you hours down the road when it’s time to do your taxes. You’ll also appear more professional 
to the outside world.
It’s also wise to keep a separate business savings account and deposit the 
appropriate portion of every dollar you make into that bucket for the 
purposes of paying your taxes at the end of the year. Being disciplined 
about this means no panic at tax time. You fill out the forms (or hire an 
accountant to do so for you), pay the money you owe out of the savings 
account, and life goes on without a ripple. You even earn interest on the 
money throughout the year.
The list of opportunities for contracting will look very much like those 
for employees. However, this approach is also practical for work beyond 
the corporate and small business clientele. Actors, dancers, and musicians 
are just a few of the artists who regularly get work through a booking or 
talent agency. Though you may never have thought of yourself in this man-
ner, you are in fact an independent contractor. You’re getting your work 
through an agency who charges you a commission. Painters and sculptors 
may find representatives to help them sell their wares, again on a com-
mission basis. In general, if you have something to offer that’s worthwhile, 
there’s a good chance that an industry exists to help you both make a 
buck off of it.

Small Business
You might not think that life as an artist is compatible with the notion of 
running a business. In fact, it’s not only a very viable opportunity; it’s one 
that can really save your bacon as your career evolves. Let’s address the 
pork first.
Many art forms are very youth oriented. This is especially true in the per-
formance arts. Musical trends change about once a decade. The previous 
generation’s music is thrown out as tragically unhip stuff played by tired 
old people, and the industry ushers in a new sound devoted to, and played 
by, the next herd of young people. In this world, old doesn’t mean some 
ninety-year-old guy hobbling around on a cane. It’s a label you acquire 
when you turn thirty.
Actors are hired based on physical appearance as well as theatrical talent. 
Often, the former is the most important factor. If you want to see institu-
tionalized sexism, you’ll find that this rule applies much more to women 
than men. With the passing of years, a guy gets more distinguished look-
ing. A girl just gets old. This, of course, is the perception embraced and 
promoted by Hollywood and based on the fact that male audiences are 
attracted to beautiful young women.
The world of dance is harsher still. Sexism isn’t the enemy that accom-
panies age in this industry. The antagonist is none other than the human 
body. The world of dance is extremely demanding from a physical perspec-
tive. When you think of Bob Fosse, it’s more common to recall his work 
as a choreographer. If you’ve ever seen him dance, however, it’s poetry in 
motion. Unfortunately, male or female, age diminishes the body’s physical 
capabilities. As with the world of professional sports, there comes a time 
when they get rid of aging dancers and bring in the young. Of course, aging 
is defined as someone in their thirties.
Chances are good that you’re not planning on dying on your thirtieth 
birthday and will likely be a creative creature until you really are that 
wobbly ninety-year-old with a cane. What are you supposed to do for the 
next sixty years in an industry where you’re no longer wanted? In a word, 
teach. That’s where the small business comes into play.
Fosse transitioned from dancer to choreographer and enjoyed huge suc-
cess. In a sense, he was following the path of a freelancer more than that 
of a small business. If you’re a dancer, however, you’ll be hard-pressed to 
live in a town where there’s not at least one school teaching dance. In a 
major metropolis, it can seem like there’s one on every street corner.

Chapter 5 | Think Like a Start-Up 
96
Furthermore, it’s not a one-size-fits-all proposition. Some will teach tap, oth-
ers modern jazz. There are ballet schools, clogging schools, square-dancing 
schools. There are even those schools that throw tradition out the window 
and teach their own style. The one thing they all have in common is that 
they’re functioning as a small business.
To run a school, you need to rent space, hire instructors, advertise to 
bring in customers, find suppliers of merchandise whose wares you can 
sell at a profit, and take care of the paperwork. If you’re successful, you can 
open additional locations. This means hiring and training branch managers 
as well as doing more paperwork.
 Teaching is a time-honored method artists use to continue their work in the business, have fun, 
and get paid.
Though you many not appreciate the comparison from an aesthetic point 
of view, a successful dance franchise is exactly like McDonalds from a busi-
ness perspective. That’s not a bad thing. It’s an American success story.
Actors, musicians, and other strange creatures of the night also have these 
opportunities. If you’ve made a living in the arts, it’s because you were 
good at both your craft and managing your career. These are things that 
the next generation needs, and they’ll pay you for it. Another very reliable 
source of revenue is from parents of young children. Going to dance class 
or an acting coach is fun and a good part of a child’s upbringing if they 
have the interest. It doesn’t matter if your daughter is planning on being a 
billionaire CEO when she gets out of college. When she’s a kid, she might 
enjoy dancing for no other reason than the fun of it.
Teaching isn’t the only path to the land of small business. The world is also 
full of music stores, typically run by musicians. It’s another way of staying 
in touch with their passion and paying the bills. Theater companies are 
rarely run by career accountants. Instead, you’ll find seasoned actors at 
the helm.
The considerations for running a small business are essentially those of 
a contractor on steroids. You’re the leader and manager. You’re the mar-
keting-and-promotions guru. Depending on how many people you can 
afford to hire, you may also be the clerical staff and janitor. The deeper 
you get into the world of business, the more you’ll want to dig into those 
resources that businesses of every industry study, including sales, finance, 
and all that other official-sounding stuff. By the time you’re to that point, 
you’re already a well established business owner, so your path will be clear 
to you.

There’s no rule that says running a small business has to be the second or 
third generation of your career. For many, it’s a natural evolution. However, 
you can also jump right into the deep end. There’s a lot of money to be 
made in the advertising industry, and many graphic artists are quick to 
launch their own agencies. As we’ve discussed, the software world often 
seems like little more than a breeding ground for tech start-ups, and these 
are just a couple of examples. In short, this is America. If you have some-
thing of value, you have an opportunity.
Master Your Mindset
Thus far, we’ve been talking about practical, nuts-and-bolts issues. It doesn’t 
matter how much you think about something; nothing happens until you 
get up off the couch and take action. There is, of course, another part of 
this equation. If you want to be successful, it all begins with attitude and 
the proper mindset.
The world owes you nothing. Your dreams aren’t going to show up on a 
silver platter just because you have talent. It may shock you to discover 
that in a country populated by several-hundred-million people—and a 
planet with over seven billion—there’s quite a bit of talent to be found. 
If you want to live life on your own terms, you’re going to have to work 
very hard for it.
Successful start-ups know this and conduct themselves accordingly, taking 
nothing for granted and pursuing every opportunity they can find. On the 
other hand, the ostrich is the patron saint of creative creatures every-
where. One mention of business and most of them immediately stick their 
heads in the sand. Aversion and wishful thinking are rarely the beginnings 
of an effective strategy.
Your first and quite possibly most difficult challenge on the road to career 
freedom resides between your ears and in the pit of your stomach. It’s 
always a bit scary doing something new. It’s even more uncomfortable 
when it’s something you’d rather not be doing in the first place. Like most 
challenges, however, the first hurdle is the hardest. Once you clear it, you’ll 
realize it’s not nearly as bad as you thought. You’ll also enjoy newly found 
confidence. There’s nothing like the feeling of controlling your own des-
tiny instead of your career being at the mercy of others.
Without a doubt, you’re going to make a lot of mistakes in the beginning. 
A friend of mine teaches the classical Japanese martial arts. He once told 
me that it was pretty much a given that you were going to be cut in a knife 
fight. The key to success, he said, was the willingness to take a cut to a

nonfatal area in order to prevail. That may sound a bit grim, but it’s really 
no different than diving into the business aspect of the arts. You’re going to 
screw up. It’s a given. However, as long as your mistakes aren’t fatal, you’ll 
keep improving over time and ultimately, your success will be assured.
While we’re speaking of martial subjects, you may not be aware of the fact 
that many businesses study classic books about military strategy in order 
to be more effective in the marketplace. Most of us in the creative world 
would doubtless prefer to avoid the world of violence, and yet there’s 
a lesson for us here. Just as businesspeople study The Art of War, so too 
should we study the art of commerce.

No matter what creative arts you pursue, there are constants that span all 
disciplines. Chief among them is the power of your image. Your creativity 
will not be judged in a vacuum with its aesthetic quality the only consid-
eration. The perception of your audience will be colored in part by how 
they see you, the artist. If you produce serious, high-caliber results but are 
considered by most to be a buffoon, your art will never be seen in its best 
light regardless of how deserving it may be.
In a similar fashion, when you’re looking for paying work, your persona 
speaks much louder than your art. The people in a position to hand you 
money are in business, and nothing improves your chances of landing a 
gig like professionalism. As is the case with many of the things we’ve been 
considering, perception is reality. The best way to be treated, and com-
pensated, as a professional is to act like one.
Your First Hurdle Is You
There are a number of reasons why we don’t put as much effort into 
managing our image as we should. Some of us get caught up in the illu-
sion that the quality of our work is all that should matter. From this lofty 
perch, high atop the ivory tower of unrealism, we convince ourselves that 
an emphasis on image indicates a meaningless and shallow creator.
It’s not hard to look at the world of commercial products and see mar-
keting that’s run amok, producing products of terrible quality and selling 
them hand over fist through the use of hype and sensationalism. I can 
use a screwdriver to pound in a nail, but that doesn’t make it a hammer. 
Misuse of a tool doesn’t invalidate its purpose in life.
If cheesy self-promotion is the only way you can peddle your wares 
because they’re simply not very good, there’s a case to be made that you 
should consider a different line of work. On the other hand, an excellent

painting looks even nicer in an elegant frame. Don’t disregard a useful tool 
just because some don’t know how to wield it properly.
An even greater challenge for many is the demons and dragons that lurk 
just beneath the surface of the average creative person. There are artists 
in the world who are supremely confident and believe that their efforts are 
the greatest thing since sliced bread. Some are modest. Some are not. For 
many of us, however, self-doubt and insecurity are not strangers. Regardless 
of how many people fawn over our latest creation, we cringe inwardly and 
fear that someone may discover us for the fraud we truly are.
Since people come in all shapes and sizes, not everyone experiences this 
to these extremes. Demons are versatile little creatures and can grow or 
shrink to suit the nature of their victims. In my own case, I don’t grapple 
with the intensity of feeling like I’m a phony who might be uncovered at 
any moment, but I’ve known many who truly did. They were wonderful 
people who did great work. Unfortunately, they were never able to see 
this with their own eyes despite many admirers who could.
For me, the vehicle for self-doubt is not a Harley but rather a penchant 
for merciless critique. As an example, I just finished writing the second 
edition of Unite the Tribes, a leadership book I penned a decade ago. The 
core material was still relevant, and the only update I needed to make to 
focus it specifically on the needs of the technology sector. The plan was 
simple. I’d write a few new chapters to set things up and then just make a 
light editing pass through the remainder.
When it was all said and done, I’d completely rewritten the entire book. 
The only thing that remained was the chapter titles and headings. A friend 
asked me why I shoved the first edition into a shredder and rewrote it 
from the ground up. I told her that the writing was so bad I just couldn’t 
live with it. She gave me the same look that our true friends offer when 
they’re trying to decide if you’re on drugs or just fell and hit your head 
really hard.
She told me that she still has her copy of the first edition and had really 
liked the way I wrote it. She’s smart, a friend of countless years, and I trust 
her, so when she told me it wasn’t the crap I perceived it to be, I knew 
she was telling me the truth. My personal demons, however, weren’t even 
remotely interested in what she was saying. I think they were too busy 
sipping martinis to be bothered with anything as trivial as reality.
I share this rather embarrassing story of my own for a functional reason. 
One of the common aspects of housing demons and dragons is the sense 
that you’re alone in your struggle. For some it can be a paralyzing expe-
rience. In milder cases like my own, it only causes a lot of extra effort, 
along with the teeth marks that come inevitably from gnawing on your  
own ankle.

 Many creative people harbor secret fears that they lack skill and will soon be discovered as 
frauds. Just tell the gremlins inside to just shut up when the din gets too loud. Over time, your 
anxieties will diminish and your art will flourish.
Either way, it’s easy to feel like we’re screwed up and stupid for having 
internal issues while other, decidedly more normal, artists are immune 
to this affliction. In reality, I’ve met very few creatives who didn’t have at 
least some degree of self-doubt. And I’ve certainly never met one who 
was normal.
By realizing that you’re not alone and that those late-night, martini-swilling 
parties going on inside of you are not at all uncommon, it can make it at 
least a little easier for you to shout down the stairwell and tell them to 
shut up and turn the loud music off. There is strength in numbers, and the 
creative world is a pretty big crowd.
Of course, in my case the harsh critique was turned inward. It doesn’t take 
much imagination to realize that there are plenty of people out there who 
are quick to offer a searing criticism of your work rather than focusing 
on their own. If you’re a little tender on the inside to begin with, this can 
sting quite a bit. It will certainly fuel any feelings of inadequacy that you 
may already harbor.
The first step in building a positive and professional self-image that will 
get your work taken more seriously and make it easier to get a gig is 
believing in yourself. This isn’t exactly a novel suggestion, but sometimes 
it’s worth trotting out life’s little truisms for no other reason than the fact 
that they’re true.
It’s very likely that the single greatest obstacle between you and the image 
you deserve is currently deep down inside of you, doubtless making another 
martini. There are plenty of great resources out there to help you work 
through these feelings, and it’s important that you do. You can’t consider 
the second obstacle in the race until you’ve cleared the first hurdle.
Avoid the Cult of Ego
Another practice that’s harmful to your personal brand lies at the exact 
opposite pole. It’s still driven by personal demons, only this time they 
don’t swill martinis. It’s more likely that they shoot tequila, since that 
has a tendency to make you feel ten feet tall and bulletproof. It’s hard 
to imagine a world of creativity that doesn’t contain those boorish and 
overbearing souls who believe that they’re the most spectacular talent in 
the known universe.

Some people are truly this deluded. It’s worth noting that a self-aggrandiz-
ing nature may well accompany a gifted person. Nonetheless, egomania is 
always a delusion, regardless of the quality of your work. None of us are 
superior enough to look down on our fellow humans. More importantly, 
to do so makes you look like a jerk. That’s never good for business.
A raging ego isn’t always indicative of an exaggerated sense of worth 
either. Occasionally it’s exactly the opposite. Personally, I deal with my 
demons by opening the basement door and dousing them with a fire hose. 
It probably doesn’t change much, but at least it screws up their martinis. 
We take our little victories where we can find them. Others, however, will 
turn self-doubt on its head and cope with it by convincing themselves that 
they’re superstars and then acting the part. On the outside, it looks pretty 
much the same as massive overconfidence and has an identical effect on 
your career.
It’s actually not that hard to fall into the cult of ego when you live the cre-
ative life. After all, we exist to have an audience and, if we’re any good at 
what we do, we’re going to have at least a few people telling us that we’re 
great. If looking into the basement is uncomfortable, it’s far more appeal-
ing to embrace the praise you receive and immerse yourself in that.
A variation on the egomaniac is the aloof artist with an often subtle but 
no less irritating sense of superiority. This is the hipster who has to sit 
at the cool kids’ table rather than hanging out with us lesser mortals. He 
doesn’t connect with his audience so much as he endures them, those 
little people who just don’t understand the purity of his art. It’s not dif-
ficult to see the problems this can create for you. Being unapproachable 
makes you exactly that. Those with gigs to offer will simply approach 
someone else.
It’s important that you develop a sense of confidence. Without it, you’ll 
never get very far. However, there is a balancing act between confidence 
and arrogance. It can feel like living life on the high wire without a net, 
but it’s crucial to find that center point, believing in yourself without being 
obnoxious about it.
Up there on the wire to keep you company are humility and self-doubt, 
an equally precarious combination. To believe in yourself without becom-
ing a jerk, you need humility and perspective. Go too far in that direction, 
and you’re in the basement. Watch your step in all that water. I haven’t 
mopped the floors in a while.
It can be tricky maintaining your balance, to be sure. For what it’s worth, 
I’ve been actively fighting these battles my entire life. As you might imag-
ine, I see more road ahead of me than I do in the rearview mirror. Even 
so, I’ve learned that it’s well worth the effort. Everything about my life, and  

Have Fun, Get Paid
103
certainly my creative career, is far better today than it would be if I didn’t put 
forth the effort in areas that are uncomfortable for me, although I do have to 
admit that the fire hose is fun. Keep at it. You’ll get better as you go.
Rejection Is Part of the Game
Another thing that’s a little hard on the self-image is the experience of being 
rejected. It doesn’t take a postgraduate degree in clinical psychology to 
know that this can be painful. Very few of us go through life without some-
one pushing us away, but nowhere is it more common than in the arts.
For most of us, the entire point of creating is to share with others. While 
some may have difficulty accepting that they have a need for validation 
from their audience, look deeply enough and you’ll find that it’s present. 
You may have to wade through some water and step over a couple of 
empty tequila bottles to find it, but it’s there.
To create is to expose a very important part of our soul to a crowd of 
complete strangers, trusting that they’ll understand how vulnerable we 
are in that moment. Such trust is often misplaced. Mathematically speak-
ing, the larger the audience that you draw, the greater the likelihood that 
some will criticize your work. When it happens, you’re not going to care 
much for the experience.
The potential for rejection has always been a part of the artist’s life, but 
the Internet takes it to new extremes. Above and beyond the sheer num-
ber of people who can interact with you is the fact that a significant por-
tion of them will be trolls, those malevolent miscreants who enjoy making 
fun of others. It’s almost impossible to imagine a comments section on the 
average Web site without them. Moderating their musings can become a 
full-time job in and of itself. It matters little that these mean-spirited posts 
are coming from disembodied voices associated with fake names. It hurts 
just the same.
Of course, trolls aside there will be others who simply don’t like your 
work. They can be regular people who are a part of your audience or 
industry figures who give you a bad review. Getting panned by a critic is no 
fun because they’re supposed to be an authority on the matter. Therefore, 
if they say you suck, your inner demons will raise a glass and heartily sug-
gest that you agree.
 Pay no attention to the trolls on the Internet or in other parts of your reality. There’s a reason 
they hide behind fake names and false bravado. Keep putting one foot in front of another and 
those disembodied voices will eventually be drowned out by the applause of your fans.

In truth, critics reflect not only their own personal taste but a very spe-
cific vision of what they feel does and does not qualify as art. While 
they’re busy judging you based on the ivory tower criteria of the art 
school they graduated from, thousands of screaming fans are loving what 
you do. That’s often a loud enough noise to make demons and dragons 
run for cover.
There’s another kind of review that’s commonplace these days and in many 
ways much more relevant. It’s rare that I buy something from Amazon 
without first glancing at the reviews for that particular product. This is the 
voice of the people, your true audience. They’re the ones who just ponied 
up the money for your latest work and thus have the right to an opinion.
I know that there are some creative people who are totally immersed 
in what they do and are driven by the art itself, not the response of the 
consumers. Such creators can be immune to the opinions of others. As 
for myself, regardless of the medium I work in, I’m just not one of those 
legendary Michelangelo-type figures who grace the planet every few-hun-
dred years with important work. While it’s true that I create based on 
what I feel rather than what I think people want to hear, ultimately I’m a 
big fan of my audience. Without them, there’s not much reason for me to 
be creative at all.
While I respect the opinions of critics and others who are educated well 
beyond my meager pedigree, the voice I care about is the voice of the 
people, the audience who takes the time to consume what I produce. 
Naturally, it makes the Amazon reviews a bit more relevant when it’s my 
own work under scrutiny. However, even though they’re supposed to be 
the opinions of those who actually read the book or consumed whatever 
else it is I have out there, it is still the Internet and some fundamental 
rules apply. If you keep them in mind, it can help you maintain the proper 
perspective.
It’s common in sporting competitions to have a panel of judges who 
throw out the highest and lowest scores and then average what remains. 
It’s a fairly reasonable approach to eliminating bias in either direction. 
This is useful when considering reviews as well. Some people will love 
you no matter what you do. Even if you have a bad moment and put out 
something truly beneath your normal standards, they’ll give you five stars. 
Trolls exist in reviews as well, and they will be a good source of single-star 
reviews.
It’s also worth noting that business is business, and it’s neither fair nor 
nice. Some of your competitors will trash your work to make their own 
appear more appealing. The unethical will pay for positive reviews to 

Have Fun, Get Paid
105
pump up their status. As if this wasn’t enough, there’s also good old-fash-
ioned human nature to consider. If you have dozens of five-star reviews, 
someone’s going to ding you just because they think you need to be taken 
down a notch.
I’ve also noted that with noncreative products, there’s the idiot factor to 
consider. This is produced by the people who buy a toaster and then give 
it a one-star review because it didn’t heat up when it wasn’t plugged in. I’d 
love to think that every person on the planet is intelligent, perceptive, and 
has a valuable opinion. Reality dictates otherwise.
Of course, I’m just using Amazon as a working example. These principles 
apply across the board, from online retailers to brick-and-mortar stores 
and from the vaunted words of critics to the mass of enthusiastic bodies 
at your latest performance. There’s no way you can be a creative person 
without exposing yourself to rejection. However, if you can learn to see it 
for what it is and take it with a grain of salt, it’ll be much easier to survive 
the experience with your self-image intact.
Be Who You Want to Be
Up to this point, I’ve spent a fair amount of time talking about the difficul-
ties of maintaining a positive self-image in a world that’s often hostile to 
the concept. You can’t build anything lasting on a shaky foundation, so to 
be seen as who you want to be it has to start from the inside and work its 
way out. You can wear all the right clothes and hang out at the trendiest 
spots, but if you don’t believe you’re cool, no one else will. They may not 
even know why. It’s just one of those things we sense.
Now that we’ve mopped up all the excess water and walked the empty 
tequila bottles to the recycle bin, it’s time to turn our vision outward. To 
be successful as a creative creature, regardless of what your interpreta-
tion of success may be, you have to know what the end result looks like. 
It goes along with knowing what you want from life and so requires the 
same amount of effort.
Too often we imagine ourselves standing in the bright spotlight and noth-
ing more. You have to see things more clearly than this. Look down and 
see the duct tape and stains on the well-worn carpet of the stage. Peer 
into the first row and see the faces of the people in the audience. Look in 
the mirror and see what they see. You have to paint a completely realistic 
picture in your mind of what you’re creating before you can create it. That 
goes for more than just your art. It applies to your career as well.

Chapter 6 | Image Building
106
 It’s hard, but do your best to see yourself as others see you. Image is an important aspect of 
your artistic career. Face it—people don’t want to see their favorite hip-hop artist in a three-
piece suit sans jewelry. Adapting to the expectations isn’t easy, but it can be fun if you approach 
it as yet another creative endeavor in your life.
If you’re the philosophical sort, you’ll probably consider the deeper mean-
ing inherent in visualizing your goals in great detail. I’ll leave advice on such 
matters to more qualified people. For our purposes, we’re going to focus 
on the practical aspects that accompany this approach. Simply put, you 
can’t hit the target if you don’t know what you’re aiming at.
Since a great deal of success is influenced by your image, both in the eyes 
of the professional community and that of your fans, you have to become 
active in creating what you want them to see. This isn’t a matter of being 
phony or deceptive. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. If the world is to per-
ceive you as a talented and successful artist, you need to stand up and be 
exactly that.
I’m a blue jeans and sneakers kinda guy. It’s not uncommon to find a fair 
degree of wear and tear on both. For what I do, that works fine. If I’m 
playing guitar in some smoky bar, it’s reasonable attire. If I’m doing a speak-
ing gig, I’ll wear nicer jeans, put on a pair of biker boots that are actually 
polished. I might even throw a sports coat on over my T-shirt. This is also 
appropriate, as it takes it up a notch in terms of professionalism without 
losing sight of my image. I’m not a conservative businessman who works 
at an investment firm, and those aren’t the people in my audience. If I 
showed up wearing a tie, they’d probably hang me with it.
Now imagine how this would work out if I were a fashion designer, trying 
to get my line of extremely elegant clothing taken seriously by the lead-
ing voices of the industry. I could hire the best models for the runway, 
but what would people think when I showed up to the party afterward 
looking like I’d just stumbled out of Joe’s Bar and Grille? No matter how 
trendsetting my designs, and regardless of the professional allure of the 
models who displayed them, every serious industry professional in the 
room would immediately consider me a buffoon with no taste.
As in our earlier examples, people often form these opinions at a sub-
conscious level without ever thinking about it. From an idealistic point of 
view, all that should matter is the quality of my designs. I have good stuff 
and I presented it in the proper light. How I personally dress should be 
irrelevant. I’m not a runway model.
o

Have Fun, Get Paid
107
All of these points are true. None of these things should matter. But every-
one at the party will leave with the sense that something’s just not right 
with this picture. After all, if I have no sense of fashion in my own attire, 
how serious a player could I be in the world of international design?
If I were invited to speak at a black-tie affair, I wouldn’t show up in blue 
jeans and a T-shirt. I would either decline the gig if I thought I wasn’t a 
good fit for the audience or I’d hit the nearest tuxedo-rental store. Back 
when I played music full time, I often had to take whatever work I could 
get. This included country clubs, weddings, and other such decidedly non–
rock-and-roll affairs. I needed the work and took the gigs, so I showed up 
looking like what they expected to see. The jeans were in the car, ready 
for a quick getaway, but for the job I presented the appropriate image.
These days I’m in a better position to pick the kinds of creative work I 
take. As a result, I have the freedom to be who I want to be and build 
on that. I write and direct video projects and film. I play guitar in a 
band. I develop software. I do public speaking and also take on the rare 
consulting client when I think he’s worth the effort. Many of these creative 
outlets could play to a variety of audiences, so I cultivate the ones that I 
want.
Nobody cares what the director looks like on a movie set. The computer 
is equally apathetic about my attire when I’m programming, but some of 
my clients have dress policies. If I’m working on-site instead of remotely 
from home, I dress accordingly. Because of this, I’ve been known to decline 
gigs if they wanted me to show up in a suit and tie. When I’m speaking, I 
direct my efforts to those events in which the people will enjoy me for who 
I am. If I happen to be singing and playing guitar, my apparel depends on the 
gig. I don’t mind putting on shiny clothes for a fancy rock-and-roll show. On 
the other hand, if I’m playing blues at Billy Bob’s Biker Bar, the grungier the 
jeans, the better.
In each of these cases, I’m able to make the right call because I understand 
the image I’m trying to present as well as what the reality of the situation 
dictates. Having a firm grasp of such information is the key to your success 
in this area.
It’s well worth taking time on a regular basis to consider all of your cre-
ative dreams and break them down, as I have above. For each of them, 
who do you want to be and how would you like others to perceive you? 
In addition to your desires, you also have to know what the situation 
requires. I’ll emphasize that you should be aware of how things really are, 
not how you think they should be. Once you’re a big star, perhaps you can 
set new trends. For now, know what it takes to get the gig.

Chapter 6 | Image Building
108
 It’s essential to know what it takes to “get the gig.” That means different things in different cir-
cumstances. Though you’d always like to dress “like an artist”—as you do at gallery openings—
can you tone it down a bit to get a teaching job? The chameleon has great power.
This thought exercise should extend beyond just making a list of attri-
butes. You’re a creative person. This will work best as an exercise in 
connecting with that nebulous, indefinable thing that runs through all our 
artistic endeavors and comes out as inspiration. Allow yourself to day-
dream, fantasize, and become immersed in the world you wish to enjoy. 
That’s always fun. Just keep your notepad at hand so that you can keep 
track of what you learn in as much detail as possible. See the vision of 
who you want to be, then paint the picture.
Learn the Language
When I was a beginner in the world of professional musicians, my best 
friend and mentor was a guy who was twelve years my senior. As genera-
tion gaps require, we had different tastes in music and culture, but that 
didn’t stop a bond from forming. It also didn’t stop me from learning a 
great deal from him. All that was required was an open mind and the will-
ingness to occasionally translate concepts from his world into my own.
One of the very first things he taught me is something that seems obvi-
ous today but was anything but at the time. If you want to be treated as a 
professional, you have to be perceived as a professional.
I was a long-haired rock-and-roll singer who spent a lot of time playing 
in garage bands. For those of you who aren’t of the musical persuasion, 
a garage band isn’t a description of where your rehearsals take place. It 
means a band who does nothing but play in garages because they can’t get 
any paying gigs. My friend, on the other hand, worked most nights of the 
week and paid the bills with that money. In short, he was a professional. I 
was not.
As a reminder, the term commercial does not mean selling out. It has to 
do with commerce, the act of getting paid for your art. In a similar vein, 
professionals are people who pursue their art as their profession. It’s how 
they make a living. I didn’t come to these conclusions on my own. They 
were patiently explained to me by a friend who wanted me to understand 
that if I wanted to be a professional musician, I should probably understand 
what the phrase meant.

As I warmed up to the idea, I began to see that there are certain manner-
isms that serve as cues to show the working musicians who’s a pro and 
who’s not. Much of this has to do with attitude, although that turned out 
to be a different kind of attitude than I was expecting. I was all wrapped 
up in the countercultural statements of youth, rebellion, and the part 
rock-and-roll played in it all. As it turns out, when you’re looking for 
paying work, the people who are in a position to hire you aren’t terribly 
impressed with this sort of thing.
There’s a common language among working-class musicians regardless of 
genre. In fact, much of this language transcends artistic boundaries alto-
gether and is understood by the painter, the dancer, and the actor with 
ease. The first thing I learned was the effectiveness of subtlety. As any 
who know me can attest, this is not something that comes naturally.
As it turns out, one of the quickest ways to spot the amateur in the crowd 
is to note who’s making the biggest claims in the loudest voice, those hav-
ing strong opinions in areas of little experience. The guy who’s making a 
fuss is generally trying to puff himself up artificially because he has nothing 
in his background to do it for him. The person who’s working six nights a 
week playing the bar down the road has a completely different demeanor. 
Sure, there are egos aplenty in this business, but the working-class musi-
cian isn’t bragging about how he’s a star. It’s more likely that he’s trying to 
get a cute girl to buy him a drink.
The world of the working artist is focused less on being a superstar and 
more on being able to eat this week. You’ll see that reflected in their con-
versations. Instead of the garage band mentality of discussing grand and 
glorious visions, the singer looking for a gig will simply ask you how often 
your band is working and how much it pays.
The power of such questions is shockingly deceptive. Simple and innocu-
ous, they nonetheless communicate that you’re a pro with professional 
concerns on your mind and you’re wondering if the band you’re talking to 
is in the same league. If they’re not working, you politely excuse yourself 
and move on to the next opportunity. If they are, you’ve accomplished two 
things. You’ve validated this as a solid lead for work, and you’ve given them 
a subtle cue that you’re the real thing, not some starry-eyed wannabe.
When I moved to New York, it was at the invitation of a girl I’d met while 
she was visiting Florida to pursue a relationship that we both wanted to 
explore. As we all tend to do from time to time, I didn’t really over-
think the matter. I just packed up and hit the road. Of course, this meant 
that my first order of business upon arrival was looking for a gig.
At that time, most cities had local papers for the creative arts, and that’s 
usually where musicians would advertise that they were looking for play-
ers or bands. With one of these papers as a resource, I remember one 

Chapter 6 | Image Building

night making a number of phone calls while my girlfriend looked on. Most 
of these conversations were polite but brief. We’d exchange a couple of 
pleasantries, and then I’d ask the person how often the band was working 
and how much the gigs usually paid. The response was typically zero on 
both accounts.
After a number of such conversations, my girlfriend looked at me and 
patiently explained that I was being completely unrealistic. You don’t, she 
told me, just show up in town and immediately step on stage with a gig-
ging band. You have to pay your dues, which means spending a lot of time 
rehearsing in someone’s garage for no pay. Eventually, you’ll get lucky and 
get a chance to play live, usually for free, but in time you’ll start to get 
paying work.
It’s worth mentioning that she was a great person and very intelligent. She 
was also not a musician and had no experience whatsoever in this world. 
The conventional wisdom she passed along was learned through associa-
tion with friends who played in garage bands.
My little universe has always had a decent sense of humor, which is why 
the very next phone call I made after her explanation went differently. I 
asked how many nights the band was working and the answer was five, 
sometimes six. There was also a quick and straightforward answer on how 
much the jobs paid.
After determining that we knew a lot of the same songs, he invited me 
to the club the band was playing the next night so that I could sit in and 
sing a few songs for an audition. I did exactly that and was hired on the 
spot. I worked with them for quite some time and it was a great gig. Of 
course, my girlfriend had heard the entire conversation. When I hung up 
the phone, I certainly didn’t point out to her that I’d just showed up in 
town and would immediately step on stage with a gigging band. I’m not 
an idiot.
While this example is in the realm of music, you’ll find that it holds true 
for every paying art form. As you spend time with the working class, pay 
attention to the phrases they use and how they talk about their trade. 
Some of the topics will be creative in nature but others will be about 
business.
 Hang out with artists who get paid for their work. You’ll learn way more than you would spending 
time with entitled wannabes expecting the world to discover them. The professionalism of the 
working-class creative will seep into your psyche over time, eventually turning you into a paid 
artist as well.

Have Fun, Get Paid

When you’re in conversation with your more gainfully employed friends, 
don’t overdo it or try to be something you’re not. Just learn the subtle 
language of those who get paid for what they do and adopt it in your 
own mannerisms. If you’ve never worked a paying job in your life, be 
honest about it. Credibility is important. However, even without practical 
experience, the fact that you have a professional attitude about things will 
encourage others to give you a chance. If you have talent and are easy to 
work with, that’s all you need.
Understanding Touch Points
Presenting yourself as a professional extends to more than just conversa-
tion. It happens at every level, any place where there’s a chance for inter-
action. It also involves more than just your peers. Success requires not just 
business sense but interaction with people who are willing to shell out 
their hard-earned cash for what you create. How they perceive you has a 
lot to do with whether or not they feel the transaction is worth it.
In order to build an image as a professional, perhaps even one well on her 
way to stardom, it’s important to reflect the proper image at every step 
of the way. You do this by paying close attention to the quality of your 
touch points. These are the places where you, the creative creature, come 
in contact with someone else. They include the realm of personal interac-
tion as well as things like promotional materials, conversations with the 
media, and other such things.
A great example is your Web site. In today’s connected world, fans and 
potential employers alike will expect to be able to find you on the Web. 
There are many ways to accomplish this. Because one of my creative pur-
suits is technology, I have an advantage in this area because I actually get 
paid to do Web site development for clients. This means I can handle my 
own site with ease.
Of course, most people aren’t professional geeks. Because of this, they 
often rely on a social media site or some art-specific venture to produce 
a few Web pages for them. A graphic artist might post work and have a 
profile on a site devoted to that type of creativity. A musician may post 
songs on a similar site devoted to bands. At best, doing this will allow you 
to have a presence on a public site that’s at least on topic. At worst, you 
rely on a generic social media site. Either way, your visitors aren’t coming 
to a site that’s dedicated to You, Inc. They’re visiting the pages of a tech-
nology company. You’re merely a squatter.
What kind of image do you think this conveys? Think of your favorite 
superstars, the people in your field whom you most want to emulate. 
Chances are good that they’ve paid someone to set up their own site, one 

Chapter 6 | Image Building
112
that’s about their work and nothing else. They’re not borrowing some 
dusty corner of a tech company’s offerings. They’re professionals, and they 
look the part.
You don’t have to spend a lot of money on this. You can register a Web 
site domain name (mine is ChristopherDuncan.com) for less than twenty 
dollars a year. There are countless companies out there who will host 
your site for ten bucks a month. If you don’t have any geek friends, you can 
find a great many free resources out there that will give you prefabricated 
templates for your site layout. All of which means that for a little effort 
and for less than the cost of a cheeseburger and fries each month, you can 
have a professional looking presence on the Web. In business terms, that’s 
called a competitive edge.
Your Web site is only one example, of course, but it’s a good one. Some 
people you do business with will want to use e-mail. Nobody’s going to 
take you seriously with an AOL.com address. When they reply to one 
that ends in YourWebsiteDomainName.com, you look more credible, like 
someone who takes their profession seriously.
Your business cards, letterhead, pictures, brochures, and other such bits 
of physical paraphernalia are subject to the same rules. If you’re a sculp-
tor and you just photocopied some grainy snapshots of your work, how 
impressed do you think the gallery down the road is going to be?
 Everything connected to you—your image, your Web site, your business card—reaches a 
potential paying customer or fan. Make sure it reflects your skill and professionalism.
The same can be said of other such demo tools. If you’re a dancer, they 
help to show people how well you dance. If you give people a link to 
a video of you prancing around in your living room, it doesn’t exactly 
scream prima ballerina.
You can get surprisingly good quality from a cell phone camera if you pay 
attention to lighting. Find a background that looks appropriate. Beg your 
way onto a high school stage on a weekend, or get some creative friends 
to throw together a reasonable looking backdrop for you. You’re not try-
ing to sell some clumsy attempt at deception, hoping viewers will believe 
you’re on stage at Madison Square Garden. You merely need to show that 
you have a sense of professionalism.
Technology is cheap and ever present in our lives today, and you don’t have 
to be a working-class geek to use it. Find the resources you need, look at 
the results the pros get, and emulate that in your demo materials. You’ll 
be surprised at how much this makes you stand out from the herd.

The best starting point is to take stock of all your touch points. How 
many different ways does your creativity and personal image intersect with 
the professional world as well as that of your potential fans? Catalogue 
each and every one of the ways, and then set out to insure that no matter 
where people encounter you, the experience is first class.
Emulate Success
One of the mistakes that many people make when building their image 
is operating on their own preconceived notions rather than tuning in to 
what the pros are doing. When immersed in your art, you should be true 
to yourself. When you’re building an image and looking for work, it’s equally 
important to be true to your environment.
I’m not a big fan of the color brown. I’m sure it’s a fine shade and has many 
respectable qualities, but it just doesn’t excite me. That said, if I were to 
look for creative work in an industry that was dripping with shades of 
brown, I would completely disregard my love of blue and make sure that 
my promotional materials had every bit as much brown as those of the 
most successful people in the field. In other words, one of the easiest ways 
to look professional is to observe what the pros do and emulate them.
If the artistic purist in you cringes over what you may consider to be a 
copycat performance, take heart. This isn’t an exercise in pretension. It’s 
all about understanding boundaries.
When I’m working on a book, I have my preferred approach to writing. I’m 
casual and speak in a conversational voice, much as I would were I talking 
to someone in person. I can get away with this provided I don’t stray too 
far from the accepted norms.
When I’m writing for a business audience, as I did with Unite the Tribes, 
I can be casual but only to a point. If I stray too far into slang, profanity, 
or examples that are far removed from the world of tech start-ups, read-
ers will stop taking me seriously and I’ll lose them. Because I read business 
books and pay attention to what respected authors do, I’m familiar with the 
norm. It tells me where I can push the envelope a bit and where I need to 
paint within the lines.
If you find such considerations to be artistically unacceptable, you’re going 
to be a garage band creative for the rest of your life. If you want to get 
paid, regardless of the discipline, there are rules. Some can be bent and oth-
ers fractured. Some are completely inflexible. As the old saying goes, you 
can’t break the rules until you know what they are. A corollary to this is 
the fact that you can’t play the game if you don’t know the rules. This isn’t 
about conforming. It’s about being someone who fits into the business 
model of your art form and is thus a candidate for being paid.

Chapter 6 | Image Building
114
 Want to get paid for your work? Know the rules before you break them. There’s a business 
model that exists to make it easier for consumers of your art to find you, buy your wares, and 
come back for more. Know that model intimately.
With that in mind, you should spend a great deal of time studying those 
who are making a living at what you want to do. However—and this is 
where people tend to make the next big mistake—don’t look at the rock 
stars exclusively, or even predominantly. Your best role models are the 
people who are doing the average day-to-day gigs. They’re not rich and 
famous. They may even struggle to pay the rent when they hit a bump in 
the road. They are, however, working on a regular basis.
Superstars make lots of money, so they can afford all sorts of wardrobe, 
PR departments, and managers to keep them looking like stars. Try that 
on your macaroni and cheese budget and you’re not going to get very far. 
Furthermore, if you try to emulate that as best you can at your own level, 
you won’t look like a superstar. You’ll just look pretentious.
This concept applies to your search for jobs as well. If you’re an actor 
looking for steady work, take a look at what’s in your area. Sure, go ahead 
and audition for that Hollywood blockbuster with the famous director. 
You can’t win if you don’t play. When you’re done, go look for something 
that will buy you dinner tonight. Make note of all the theater companies 
in your area. Find out how much work there is for commercials. See if 
there’s a good indie film community where you live. Look for every pos-
sible paying gig you can find that doesn’t require you to be a superstar in 
order to be considered.
Once you have a notion of where the work is, start paying attention to 
the people who get it. How do they dress? What do their promotional 
materials look like? What auditions do they go on? Look at their Web sites 
and other PR materials.
Perhaps they work through an agency. Since securing a good agent is often 
harder than getting an actual paying gig, find out what work they’ve landed 
without the guiding hand of a manager.
These people are paying the bills by doing what you want to do. Find out 
how they conduct themselves and how they’re represented in each of 
their touch points and you’ll learn the secret of their success.
In addition to emulating those who are going somewhere, it’s also worth 
reviewing those who aren’t. Another of my many pursuits involves a cam-
era. When I first started out with video, one of my interests was in how 
things came together in postproduction, where elements both real and 

Have Fun, Get Paid
115
imagined are stitched together to create a believable scene. With the 
same bar band mentality I just described, I didn’t focus on blockbusters 
who spent millions on graphic artists. I watched B movies as well as a lot 
of things on the Web. Often, I wasn’t looking for the really cool shot. I was 
looking for the disaster, the scene so phony and unrealistic you wonder 
how it ever made the cut.
I remember watching an action adventure that had a bit of sci fi in it. 
There was a fair amount of green-screen work, scenes where actors are 
shot against a solid green fabric so that they can be replaced later with 
a background shot somewhere else. In this movie, the composited back-
grounds never really worked. Instead of looking like they were in a lush 
forest, the actors more closely resembled a ransom note, where scraps 
of a magazine are cut out and pasted onto a white piece of paper. The 
actors looked fine. The forest looked fine. In no way did they look like 
they belonged together.
By analyzing these scenes, I started to home in on the problem areas. In 
one case, it was the edges of the actors’ bodies. They were sharp and 
clean-cut in contrast to the background. I then learned about a technique 
called light wrap, which is based on the fact that the lighting of our envi-
ronment bounces off the edges of our bodies in a way that brings the two 
together. By learning how to emulate this effect, I got better with my own 
green-screen work. The benefit didn’t come from looking at completely 
perfect Hollywood movies. I improved my skill by looking at the mistakes 
others made and learning how to avoid them.
In your creative circles, there will be plenty of people whom no one takes 
seriously. They don’t get hired because they’re obvious amateurs. If you 
study how they present themselves and compare that to how the work-
ing class go about their business, you’ll begin to see many glaring mistakes. 
By focusing on them and learning to avoid doing the same yourself, you’ll 
continually polish the stone of your own image, making it look ever more 
like the gem of professionalism.
While this can be an extremely productive exercise, there’s one caution-
ary note. As you do this, it will be very easy to develop a sense of supe-
riority, looking down on the people making mistakes and eventually falling 
into a pattern of ridiculing them. Remember, everyone has to start some-
where. A few years from now, these same people might be quite success-
ful after learning the hard way those same lessons that you can glean from 
observation. More importantly, however, is this: No one wants to work 
with a jerk who looks down on others. Don’t let yourself fall into this way 
of thinking or you’ll seriously impair your chances for success.

Fake It ’Til You Make It
If you act like a professional for long enough, eventually you’ll become one. 
When you’re first starting out, you might feel like you’re just pretending. 
You are. However, when done properly, it’s okay. Think of it not as being 
phony but rather as rehearsing your part to perfection. The people who 
are working act professionally. Those who don’t have difficulty staying 
employed. You want to study and emulate the pros so closely that anyone 
you meet will feel confident in hiring you, knowing that you’re not just 
talented but are someone they can depend on to produce quality results.
Believe it or not, part of the path to success is actually avoiding certain 
gigs. If you want to play in a garage band for the pure fun of it, there’s 
absolutely nothing wrong with that. There have been periods in my life 
when I was focusing on other areas of my creative career and didn’t have 
time to play with a steadily working band. However, I was still a musician. 
My solution was to find some friends, open a beer, and crank up the guitar 
on a Saturday night for no other reason than the joy of making music. A 
garage band was fine in this scenario. It would have been a waste of time 
when I was trying to pay the bills with my music.
If you’re striving for full-time employment through your creativity, you’re 
going to follow up on a lot of opportunities in search of the ones that pay. 
In the process, you’ll encounter more than a few that are the equivalent of 
garage bands in your own art form. If you’re talking to people with whom 
you would collaborate, and your first questions beyond the courtesies are 
professional in nature, they’re going to immediately blow you off if they’re 
not ready to work. In other words, by acting professional you will have 
immediately taken yourself out of consideration for the gig. That’s exactly 
what you want to do. The more time you spend with people who can’t 
get paying work, the less you have to find those who can.
You’ll also need a bit of a thick skin from time to time. Those who haven’t 
yet made the transition from idealism to the working class are often inse-
cure and sensitive about the fact that they haven’t yet been accepted into 
the world of paid gigs. Such rejection is frustrating, and they’ll often take 
those feelings out on you, berating you for being callous and commercial 
instead of believing in their pure artistic vision. In effect, by framing the 
conversation in a professional manner, you’ll be implicitly rejecting them. 
That never feels good.
If you keep that in mind when you get the occasional negative response 
from people, it’ll take a little of the sting out of their reactions. It’s also 
worth it to develop a high degree of diplomacy and graciousness in the 
way you deal with people. There’s never any benefit to making others feel 
bad. There are also practical considerations. You’re going to be in this 
business a long time. The amateur you have a conversation with today 

Have Fun, Get Paid
117
might be a superstar ten years from now. Maybe chance will bring you 
together again in the future. Maybe it won’t. Either way, people remember 
how they were treated and people talk.
There’s power in repetition. The old street slang “Fake it ’til you make it” 
is based on this principle. It’s not about being phony. It’s about repeti-
tion. A professional athlete performs rigorous exercise on a daily basis in 
a regimen designed to improve her skills. A dancer will execute the same 
difficult move over and over again until he can do it flawlessly without 
thinking.
In a similar fashion, if you continually act as though you’re a professional 
even before you are, it will become habit. No matter what situation you 
find yourself in or how spontaneous the opportunity, you’ll instinctively 
conduct yourself as a pro. The image that others have in their mind of you 
will reflect this. When there are a dozen qualified candidates, everyone 
will immediately point to you as the one they want to hire because it’s 
clear that you operate at a higher level.
In the arts, image is a powerful tool. Give this area constant attention in 
your career and you’ll gain more than just a respectable appearance. You’ll 
have transformed yourself into the professional that you want to be.

Spreading the 
Word
As we’ve already discussed, nothing strikes terror into the hearts of cre-
ative creatures like marketing. Performing artists who shine onstage shrink 
into a corner when confronted with the need for self-promotion. Visual 
artists capable of creating the most compelling promotional materials run 
screaming in the opposite direction of these most basic business needs.
Across the board, those who pursue a life of creativity find the world of 
sales and marketing to be distasteful at best. These are the same people, 
by the way, who complain the loudest about always being broke. No one 
ever said the artistic mindset was logical.
In the highly competitive world of artistic endeavor, no one is going to give 
you a break. There’s only so much attention to go around, and everyone 
is competing for it. To make matters worse, technology and the Internet 
are empowering every man, woman, and child, and more than a few house 
cats, to become creative creatures in their own right. It’s a very crowded 
room. If you stand quietly in the corner, no one is going to notice you. 
From a  financial perspective, it’s hard to get paying work when no one 
knows you exist.
There are probably more marketing books in the world than you can 
read in one lifetime. This isn’t one of them. If you’re having trouble get-
ting the word out about what you do, the problem probably isn’t a lack of 
educational resources. It’s your unwillingness to utilize them. With that in 
mind, my goal is not to give you a comprehensive education in marketing 
but rather to take the teeth out of the beast and show you that he’s not 
as scary as you originally thought. If you can take that one small step, your 
chances for a giant leap are boundless.

The Attention Business
The most common thing that comes to mind when people think of sales 
and marketing is our friend, the obnoxious used-car salesman dressed in 
an equally tacky plaid sports coat, hammering on you with a high-pressure 
sales pitch for a low-quality automobile. We don’t hold such people in 
high regard.
In fairness, I spent a chunk of my life teaching these salespeople how to 
pay the bills. Some of them were every bit the caricature that comes to 
mind. For the most part, however, they were just regular people. One of 
the things they shared in common with the creative crowd is that neither 
of them want to work a real job.
The world of marketing is like that of any other profession. Over the 
years, people have discovered what works and what doesn’t through the 
process of trial and error. In other words, there are certain rules and 
principles that you can count on for predictable results. No matter what 
you’re selling, you can break it down into a few basic concepts.
If the thought of promotion makes you cringe, it’s helpful to look at it from 
a different perspective. One of the first and most important concepts of 
marketing is that you can’t make a sale unless potential customers are 
aware that your product exists. Consequently, once you’ve established a 
professional image, this awareness is what you need the most. In and of 
itself, it won’t guarantee you paying work, but it’s the largest contributing 
factor in achieving that goal.
No one will buy your product or attend your performance unless they know it exists. The need 
to publicize your work is therefore fundamental and unavoidable—that is, assuming that you’d 
like to get paid to have fun doing what you love.
If you want to build a better career, you don’t have to become a used-car 
salesman. You just need to do what you’re already good at. You create in 
order to share your inspiration with your audience. In other words, you 
want people to notice and enjoy your work. From that perspective, one 
could say that you’re in the attention business. That’s also how I would 
describe the world of marketing and PR. It’s really no more complicated 
than that. You’re simply trying to get the attention of your audience.
Once you look at it in this way, the thought of spreading the word about 
your art becomes much more natural. When you do something cool, you 
have no problem telling your friends about it. If you’ve built a following, 
you’re equally comfortable telling your fans that you have something new 

Have Fun, Get Paid
121
to share. Taking your career to the next level and expanding your audience 
through the basics of promotion is no different than what you’re already 
doing. It simply occurs on a larger scale and with better organization.
The Internet Is Not Life
If you’ve dipped your toes into the waters of marketing, chances are good 
that the first thing you did was spend some time searching for resources 
on the Internet. For many of us, the first thing we reach for when we’re 
­researching something is a Web browser. It’s immediate, and it’s free. It’s 
also a mixed blessing.
When you talk to people about marketing, the first words you’ll hear will 
be ones like “social media” and “search engine optimization” (SEO). The 
latter is the art of making your Web site show up at the top of the search 
results. Without a doubt, the Web can be a very useful marketing tool. 
There’s just one catch. Shocking though it may be, not everyone spends 
large chunks of their day on the Internet. In fact, it might surprise you 
to learn how many people there are in the world who aren’t wild about 
technology in general.
When you’re building an audience, do you want to limit yourself to that 
subset of the population that is technically savvy or do you just want a 
large ­following? There is more to life than the Internet. A great many of 
your potential fans are out there living it.
I mention this not to discourage you from employing every technical 
advantage you can find but rather to keep you from limiting yourself. 
There are a great many ways to spread the word about what you’re doing 
that don’t require a computer or cell phone. Were this not the case, no 
company would ever have made a sale before the silicon revolution of the 
1980s and ’90s. This means that Internet-based promotion should be only 
one aspect of your efforts.
It’s also worth noting that while much of what you can do on the Internet 
is free, it’s also a very crowded space for that very reason. If you want to 
optimize your Web site so that it shows up on the first page of search 
results, you can probably do it, but it won’t be easy. There are countless 
competitors trying to do the same thing. Some of them are even paying 
marketing firms to better their chances.
All of this adds up to one inescapable conclusion: Use the ­technical 
resources you can find whenever possible, especially the free ones. 
However, don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Your best approach is a 
balanced one that combines as many different elements as you can pull 
together.

I remember reading an interview with a big rock act that was touring in 
support of their latest album. They had a single that was at the top of the 
charts, which meant you couldn’t twist the dial on your radio without 
hearing it every five minutes. It was a big hit, so naturally people wanted 
to hear it live. Having attended their show, the person conducting the 
interview found it curious that they opened the show with this song, and 
I thought the band’s response was brilliant.
The singer pointed out the obvious, that everyone wanted to hear the 
radio song. Because of that, the people in the audience weren’t going to 
notice anything that was played before it. They were too preoccupied, 
impatiently waiting to hear that one popular tune. Since the band wanted 
to share an entire evening’s worth of their music, they played the hit song 
as the very first number. The crowd went nuts because the band gave 
them what they wanted. Having been satisfied, fans were then open to 
hearing other things.
You can’t talk about marketing without encountering the inevitable obses-
sion with the Internet. It’s what everyone expects you to talk about. 
Consequently, I got it out of the way first so that we could focus on mat-
ters that are actually more important. People who want to promote their 
work rush to the Web, do a few simple things they read about on a blog, 
and then sit back to wait for the bucks to roll in. Not surprisingly, they’re 
frequently disappointed, and for good reason.
You can’t do effective promotion until you have an intimate understanding 
of your product and its market. Just as you can’t play even the most simple 
three-chord rock song until you know a few basic guitar techniques, so 
too is a marketing initiative a complete waste of time until you first con-
sider the fundamentals.
Before you can make money, you have to know how to monetize your 
business. This means jotting down the components and making sure you 
have a detailed understanding of each. You’ll be tempted to gloss over 
some of these steps because they seem obvious, but in this particular 
case, accepting the way things appear on the surface doesn’t offer much 
benefit. It’s worth digging deep even if you don’t always come up with 
anything new. The times that you do will make it worthwhile and expand 
your capabilities.
You’ll start by defining your product or service. This is, of course, the 
easiest place to roll your eyes and assume that you already know the 
definition. Because I’m often the poster child for the stupid and presump-
tuous creative creature, I’ll go first. Since I engage in a number of artistic 
endeavors, I’ll just pick writing as an example.

The first time I did this exercise, I thought, “Yeah, yeah, I write books.” 
Done. However, when I dragged myself back to the drawing board to take 
a deeper look, I saw more. “Yes, I write books. However, because of my 
background in marketing, I also have some skill with commercial copywrit-
ing, doing things like marketing brochures, Web site copy, and so on.” That 
opened up another stream of revenue.
As it turns out, before you can produce a film, TV show, or other such 
video production, someone has to write a script. I’m a writer, so I did 
what I always do. I jumped head first into the world of video production, 
writing a script and then bringing the show to life. It didn’t make me any 
money, but that particular show wasn’t meant to be a source of income, 
merely an educational experience. When I was through, I saw that it was 
something I had a knack for. This opened doors to everything from a 
feature film that’s currently on the drawing board to commercials and 
other client video work. These are all marketable services that expand 
my income potential.
Because I write books and have a long history as a professional enter-
tainer, speaking engagements are yet another source of revenue. I also 
have a high-tech audio and video recording studio that I designed into the 
lower level when I had my current house built. This means that I have the 
ability to create a series of audio and video training materials to sell from 
my Web site, at the back of the room after speaking gigs, and anywhere 
else the opportunity presents itself. While I haven’t pursued that project 
thus far, it is nonetheless another set of potential products that could 
bring in more income.
In the minds of many, if you’ve published books you must be an authority 
on the subject. While I don’t consider myself the ultimate guru in much of 
anything, we once again find that perception is reality. People are at least 
willing to entertain the notion that I know what I’m talking about since  
I write books. Because of this, I also have the option of taking on consult-
ing clients, something I’ve done from time to time. This is, of course, yet-
another source of revenue.
Define what you do in great detail. A writer who writes books or articles, for example, may also 
write screenplays, marketing copy, audio scripts, and so forth. There are usually dozens of ways 
you can monetize your skill.
I could probably dig deeper and come up with even more products and 
­services, but this list should be sufficient for the purpose of illustration. 
When I sat down to do this exercise for the first time, I almost glossed 
over it because I was sure that I already knew all that there was to know 

Chapter 7 | Spreading the Word
124
about my products and services in the area of writing. I write books. Duh. 
What’s the point of digging deeper?
As you can see, once I forced myself to sit down, shut up, and give it a 
chance, I discovered a wealth of opportunities, many of which I’d never 
have given much thought to beforehand. What about you? Think of your 
creative talents, especially the obvious ones, as the trunk of a tree, then 
explore the possibilities as each branch buds out into a few branches of 
its own.
In my case, I’m not pursuing each and every opportunity that I have at the 
moment, but that doesn’t mean I won’t in the future. It’s nice to know that 
they’re there. It’s the same for your situation. You’re in the safest place in 
your artistic career when you have as many options as possible. Whether 
or not you want to pursue them at any given moment is a separate con-
sideration. What’s important is that you know they exist.
Once you have an in-depth understanding of the products and services 
you have to offer, you’ll be able to consider another important question: 
Who is your customer? If, like me, you end up with a long list of things 
you could offer, and you probably will, you won’t have just one definition 
of your customers. The potential buyer for each of your products or ser-
vices will have her own unique characteristics.
Another important question to consider is why money should change 
hands. It doesn’t matter how cool your offerings are. People will only part 
with their money when there’s a perceived value in doing so. In other 
words, if you want someone to give you their cash, you have to ask your-
self what you’re doing for them in return. As with our in-depth explora-
tion of products and ­services, you’ll find that just beneath the obvious 
answer will be a wealth of less ­conspicuous ones.
Understand Your Business Model
If you start a conventional enterprise, you need to know your business 
model. In other words, you need to be fully aware of what you’re selling, 
who will buy it, and how the transaction will occur. Without these very 
basic bits of information, you simply can’t do business.
If you have decided to open a clothing store that specializes in custom-
tailored creations, you’d probably want to have a physical storefront. If 
you’re creating custom stage clothes, for instance, you’d want to meet 
the performer in person so that you could measure her body, consider 
her contours, and interact with her to arrive at the perfect result. You 
couldn’t do this exclusively on a Web site. This means that as part of your 
business model, you would need to specify that you need a traditional 
brick-and-mortar store.

Have Fun, Get Paid
125
Because you’re	  meeting in person, you would be able to accept not 
just credit cards but also cash and checks. That’s another aspect of your 
model. When and under what conditions you would require payment is 
another consideration. Do you get a deposit up-front before beginning 
the process? You might charge an initial fee for sitting with your client 
and discussing her desires. You would also need to have a policy on when 
final payment is due as well as any money-back guarantees you might offer 
should the client be dissatisfied with the result. All of these things are a 
part of your business model and are highly dependent on the specifics of 
your industry.
If you are a graphic artist, you might have decided that you want to get 
into the T-shirt business, selling your custom creations. In this scenario, 
you could design the shirts and sell them exclusively on the Web.
You might choose to order a large quantity of a particular T-shirt as a way 
of getting lower prices. Alternatively, you could use a print-on-demand 
service that allows you to order one shirt at a time when you make a 
sale. In this case, your profit would be lower and delivery time might be 
a bit longer. There are pros and cons to each approach. You will need to 
decide which choice you would go with, which will then become a part of 
your business model.
Ordering with an on-demand model would also give you more storefront 
options. You could rent space in a local mall or sell the T-shirts exclusively 
on a Web site. In the latter case, your payment options would probably be 
limited to just credit cards, as checks are less convenient in that scenario. 
For online sales, you’d need a way to fulfill and ship the product, so those 
considerations would also be a part of the model.
All this talk of order fulfillment and business models might sound a bit too 
conservative for some members of the artistic crowd, but it’s a part of 
our world nonetheless. We just don’t think of it that way. It’s one thing to 
sell T-shirts. If you’re a performing artist, however, you might have difficulty 
making the connection. It’s really no different though. It simply requires 
looking a little deeper in order to understand the components.
Let’s say that you play in a band. This means that you’re in the entertain-
ment business, offering a service that involves the live performance of 
music. Your primary customers are probably nightclubs, and you want 
them to hire you. Your potential clients make money by selling food 
and drinks. The more ­people in the house, the more money they make. 
Therefore, the benefit you offer is the ability to draw in a larger clientele 
through your entertainment services and keep them there longer. Payment 
is negotiated in advance and paid in full upon completion of the job.
If you sell T-shirts, CDs, or downloads of your songs, you also have prod-
ucts. In this case, your customer is the person in the crowd watching you 

Chapter 7 | Spreading the Word
126
perform. Your merchandise could be sold directly to people at the gig as 
well as from your Web site. In the club, you would accept cash only. On 
the Web site, you would only accept credit cards.
In addition to securing your own work, you might contract with a rep-
resentative to get more gigs. You pay him something like 20 percent for 
each job he procures. The nightclub pays your rep, who in turn pays you 
after deducting his commission. In the music business, such people are 
known as booking agents, but this model also exists in a great many other 
industries.
All of these things combined define your business model. It’s really not 
that complicated once you break it down. As you can see, before you can 
mount an effective marketing effort, it’s important to understand how 
your business works. A global, Internet-based promotion wouldn’t be 
very useful to a business that operates out of a single storefront in one 
city and caters exclusively to walk-in traffic. Therefore, first know your 
business, then figure out how to spread the word.
Know Yourself
Because your creativity is the asset that is being marketed, in a very real 
sense you are the product. If you spend much time in the world of promo-
tion, you’ll also find frequent reference to the concept of personal brand-
ing. It’s a sensible notion in our case.
If you were going to sell a box of cereal, you’d invest in a design firm to 
come up with a snazzy-looking logo and box to make it sell better. If all 
that mattered was the quality of your cornflakes, where the best-tasting 
cereal was the one consumers consistently choose, the entire supermar-
ket would be filled with nothing but plain white boxes.
It costs a lot of money to come up with these marketing materials. 
Corporations never spend a dime unless they think they can get fifteen 
cents in return, so you can be sure that colorful packaging has a proven 
effect on product sales. With that in mind, it’s important for you to have 
a well-defined brand of your own, one that’s both appropriate and easy 
to represent.
Your artistic skill is, essentially, your product. That makes it important to think of yourself as a 
brand. What will make a consumer choose your creativity over that of another artist? When you 
can answer this question, you’ll be adept at marketing. It’s really that simple.

Have Fun, Get Paid
127
I know many creative people who think that the quality of their art is all 
that matters. Remember, regardless of how cool you think your creativity 
is, presentation is a crucial consideration. Your local grocery store has 
very few plain white boxes. If it ruffles your artistic feathers to think of 
your lofty offerings being on par with a box of cornflakes, get over it or 
get used to being broke. The laws of physics do not bend because you 
wish them to be otherwise, and neither do the laws of commerce.
With that in mind, it’s time to consider what your brand should be. You’ll 
be delighted to know that it’s all about who you truly are as an artist. 
We’re not going to stuff you into a colorful box and put you on a shelf 
next to the frosted sugar bombs when you’re really more of a granola 
kinda guy. In fact, it’s imperative that your brand match your image, some-
thing we’ve put a fair amount of effort into defining. Your image, in turn, 
is driven by what you offer, and that comes down to your inner workings 
as a creative creature. In other words, relax. This won’t hurt a bit. Here, 
have a magazine.
Knowing who you are as a brand is a combination of defining your cre-
ative work, identifying the image that arises from it, and understanding the 
marketplace that’s receptive to your wares. However, it also has to do 
with your personality. In order to spread the word, you have to be willing 
to get up off the couch and take action. You can come up with the most 
sensible branding and strategies in the world, but if they don’t mesh with 
who you are on the inside, you’ll be uncomfortable with them. Unless it’s 
at gunpoint, we rarely do the things we’re not comfortable with.
This means that you don’t have to force yourself to be someone you’re 
not. In fact, it’s imperative that your branding be in sync with what you feel 
good about. The combination of those two aspects will create an effective 
campaign that you’ll eagerly embrace. Take a stroll over to the nearest 
mirror and think about who you see.
If marketing and promotion is something that feels alien to you, take heart. Your brand only 
works and sways others if it’s who you truly are, so amplify that. If you do it right, you’ll be 
entirely comfortable with the image you project.
Are you shy and introverted? If so, creating a brand that’s lively and out-
going would be a disaster. You’d be much better off emphasizing your 
subtlety and the intimacy of your art. If you’re wild and crazy at heart, 
presenting yourself as a conservative businessperson who shows up in 
a suit and tie would make you miserable. Your customers would also be 
dismayed to find that they didn’t get what they thought they were ­paying 
for. By taking the time to know who you are, you’ll be able to build a 

Chapter 7 | Spreading the Word
128
brand that’s in harmony with both your work and your spirit. That’s the 
path to both financial success and an ­enjoyable life.
Now look past the spotlight and into the crowd, performing the same 
­exercise with them. Who are the people, your fans, your patrons, and the 
collection of humans, who enjoy your offerings? What’s their ­collective 
personality? You need to understand their spirit just as intimately as you  
know your own. When you do, you’ll see where the two intersect,  
and that’s where the magic happens. The key to your brand is finding  
that common ground that makes people want to be a part of the muse 
within you.
Almost all art falls into genres, styles, or categories. This means that 
your audience also enjoys the work of many others, not just your own. 
Unfortunately, they have only so much disposable income. How do they 
choose where to spend it? When it comes down to you and several oth-
ers who all work in a similar style, it’s important to know how to be the 
one who’s most appealing when it’s time for your customer to make a 
decision.
In the business world, a marketing term that gets kicked around a lot 
is the unique selling proposition, or USP. It addresses this exact need of 
distinguishing yourself by conveying what’s special about your offerings. In 
other words, what can your customers get from you that they can’t get 
from your competitors? If you can define this and make it a part of your 
personal brand, you have a reason for people to patronize you rather than 
someone else. It’s a competitive advantage.
Creative people tend to think simplistically about these things. If you’re a 
painter, you might think that your USP is obvious. You’re the only person 
who produces your paintings. If you let yourself think in those terms, you 
quickly become a generic commodity, which is never an advantageous 
place to be in the business world. From such a perspective, your business 
is just another bunch of paintings. Big deal. The world is full of paintings. 
Yours are red, but the other guy has red paintings, too. While it’s true that 
only yours have that carefully crafted signature on the bottom, that’s not 
much of a distinguishing factor.
I don’t know much about the visual arts, so I can’t have an intelligent dis-
cussion about the techniques or influences used by the various ­artists. I’m 
just a consumer. However, as the old saying goes, “I know what I like.” If you 
visit my home, you’ll find several prints from Frank Frazetta, a ­legendary 
fantasy artist who was known in the 1960s and ’70s for images of wild-eyed 
barbarians, battle scenes, and the occasional voluptuous women. Among 
other things, he painted covers for books like Conan the Barbarian.
When I see his work, I find it emotionally stirring. It evokes feelings of 
ancient times, real or imagined, and fiery, passionate experiences. I have no 

Have Fun, Get Paid
129
interest in being a collector, and neither do I care to be seen as an art afi-
cionado. I have Frazetta prints on my walls because of the way they make 
me feel. Lots of people paint barbarian warriors. None of them have this 
impact on me. That emotional reaction was Frank Frazetta’s USP, not the 
fact that he was the only person who could create a Frazetta painting.
Move beyond the thing that you create, be it a product or a performance. 
Look deeper and discover what it is that your audience experiences as a 
result. Find that place inside them that only you can touch in a certain way. 
That’s what makes you unique.
Your “unique selling proposition” isn’t the product of your creativity per se. Other people offer 
work that’s similar to your own. Your USP defines that special something unique to your art and 
presents it as a value that your audience can only get from you.
Know Your Customers
We tend to think of our audience and our customers as one and the 
same, but very often this is not the case, at least not exclusively. If you’re 
an actor, you perform to a theater full of people who paid for the privi-
lege. Are they your customers? An easy way to answer that question is 
to look at your  paycheck and note the signature. I suspect it will be the 
name of the production  company, not the guy sitting in the middle of row 
fourteen.
As a businessperson, the client is the one who puts money in your bank 
account. As a creative creature, you also have an audience, those peo-
ple you entertain or enthrall through your artistic endeavors. If you sell 
T-shirts out of the back of your van after the show, your audience then 
becomes your customers as well. The important thing is to know the 
distinction between the two so that you’re addressing the right people 
when you’re seeking income.
Just as we walked through the exercise of defining your products and 
services, you must also perform the task of determining where the work 
is for each source of revenue in your line. Dancers and actors will most 
often be paid by production companies of one sort or another, be they in 
theater, film, or commercials. Musicians will be paid by venue owners and 
promoters, but they can also book gigs with individuals who are throw-
ing parties or getting married. A graphic artist might find a gig with an 
advertising agency while creating graphic novels on the side. Both of those 
creative endeavors derive income from companies. However, our artist 
also has the option of creating and selling prints directly to fans.

130
These are just a few examples, of course, and the answers will be ­different 
for each person. In fact, as you go through the various products and 
­services at your disposal, your answers will probably be different for  
each one.
Once you know where the work is, it’s equally important to understand 
who the authorized buyer is. In sales parlance, this is the person who has 
the final authority to make the purchase. Getting to the heart of this mat-
ter is not always a straightforward proposition.
If you attempt to book your band at a local bar, you may be told that the 
manager handles all entertainment. You might even meet with him and be 
told that he’s the one who makes the decisions. After several frustrating 
weeks of vague responses from him, you eventually discover that he does 
all the grunt work of auditioning acts but only makes recommendations 
to the owner of the club. In this case, the owner is the authorized buyer 
because only she has the power to hire you. If you make your case to her 
and she likes you, you’re in. If you waste time with the manager, the owner 
may never even know you exist.
Perhaps you create jewelry. Your work is highly regarded, elegant, and 
expensive. It’s also exclusively for men. If a well-to-do married couple 
shows up at one of your shows admiring your work, you might give the 
husband a lot of attention since he’s the one who would be wearing your 
work. However, if the wife is the one who manages the household finances, 
including discretionary purchases, you’re not going to make a sale unless 
she’s on board. In this case, while the husband is the audience, the wife is 
the authorized buyer because she controls the checkbook.
You’ll find this to be an important consideration no matter what you’re 
selling. If you spend your time courting someone who doesn’t have the 
authority to make the purchase, you’re wasting your time. Whether you’re 
looking for gigs or selling your wares, the marketing you do must address 
the appropriate people or you simply won’t make any money.
Once you know who your potential customer is, whether it’s a tech 
­company, an advertising agency, a production company, or just the owner 
and patrons of Joe’s Bar and Grille, you’re ready for the next step. In order 
to spread the word about your products and services, you need to let 
your prospects know that you exist and why you’re worth doing business 
with. Of course, you can’t do this unless you know how to get in front  
of them.
For each type of customer that you have, you need to do your homework 
and learn everything you can about them. In simple terms, you can think 
of this as finding out who they are, where they hang out, and how you can 
get in front of them. Each answer helps with the next question.

131
If you create arts and crafts that you sell exclusively to the consumer, your 
first step is to make a profile of your average customer. This can include 
marital status, whether or not she has kids, how much money she makes 
each year, and what hobbies and other interests she has. If you can get a 
clear enough picture, you’ll also know what magazines she reads, which 
Web sites she frequents, and the social hot spots around town where 
she’s most likely to congregate. Armed with that information, you now 
know who she is and where she hangs out. This in turn tells you how to 
get in front of her.
Understand that the consumer of your art isn’t always who pays you. The main customers of 
a large book publisher, for example, are the bookstore chains and online retailers that it must 
please first. The customer for your dance troupe might be whoever controls scheduling in the 
local dance venues. He, in turn, serves the people who sit in their seats and clap for you. To get 
gigs of any kind, know who your customers are and then show them how they will benefit when 
they do business with you.
Equally important is the value that you provide. This goes hand in hand 
with your USP but extends it into an important area. It’s not enough to 
say what’s special about your work. You have to show your customers 
why they will benefit from doing business with you. If you’re an established 
actor with a good following, the benefit that you bring to your audition is 
the fact that your already-sizeable audience will make a significant contri-
bution to ticket sales should you get the gig.
By digging deep and gaining an understanding of who your customers are, 
where they hang out, how to get in front of them, and what they’ll care 
about when you do, you’re in a good position to increase your income. 
You’ll also be well ahead of your competitors, as most of them won’t put in 
this level of effort.
As I mentioned in the beginning, my intent is not to give you a comprehen-
sive education in the area of marketing and promotion but rather to show 
you the various pieces of the puzzle and how they all come together. If 
you’re willing to get serious about this, then self-examination is important, 
but it will take you only part of the way down the road.
There are countless books, blogs, Web sites, and other resources that will 
teach you about branding, promotion, and marketing. Don’t limit yourself 
to the ones that address the creative arts. Marketing is marketing. While 
the techniques will vary based on the specifics of your situation, the basics 
never change. If you learn them, they’ll serve you well no matter what 
your products and services may be.

The Buddy System
I’m well aware of the fact that I don’t have the average creative back-
ground. While I’ve slept on floors and given blood in order to supple-
ment my meager existence as a working-class musician, I’ve also been a 
serial ­entrepreneur, ­running a number of small businesses over the years. 
Additionally, one of those ventures was a consulting company that taught 
sales and marketing. Because of this, I’m much more comfortable with 
promotion than most ­creative creatures.
Make no mistake, I’ve met some brilliant promotional minds who were as 
artsy as they come. In terms of sheer numbers, however, they have always 
been the tiny minority. Most artistic people just want to do their thing and 
hope that making a living will magically follow. Promotion and marketing is 
not something that comes easily to them. If you find yourself in a similar 
frame of mind, you can still do a great deal to help yourself.
It’s common for people in the arts to congregate, not just with those of 
the same discipline but with the artistic community as a whole. In this 
melting pot of diverse talents, there is great opportunity.
As you’ve seen thus far, building an image, defining your brand, under-
standing your marketplace, and following up to promote your art is a lot 
of work. It also requires a great many skills. Some will come naturally to 
you. Others you’ll have to work harder at. This is where your friends and 
acquaintances in the arts come into play. You’ll find that most of them are 
in the same predicament.
A graphic artist may be a natural at designing a Web site but have no knack 
with words. As a writer, you may not be of much use when artwork is 
required but certainly know how to craft an eloquent phrase. Why not 
pool your efforts?
This one simple example can be replicated countless times for all the 
needs you have in your promotional campaigns. Share the talents you have 
with others who need them and can fill in your gaps with their skills. This 
will expand your capabilities immensely, allowing you to do high-quality 
marketing without spending money or trying to acquire skills in areas that 
aren’t natural for you. As an added bonus, you’ll be helping others where 
they’re weak. Generating goodwill is always a good promotional effort.
This doesn’t get you off the hook, of course. Most of the work we’ve dis-
cussed thus far has to do with deep thinking and truly understanding your 
art, your market, and what you present as a result. No one can do that but 
you, and it’s an effort you must complete before you approach someone 
for help in the implementation of your promotional campaign.

Have Fun, Get Paid
133
In fact, I’d heartily recommend not even mentioning collaboration to oth-
ers until you’ve done your homework, only because it’s too easy to let 
yourself get caught up in brainstorming with friends in order to avoid 
doing the harder work that you really don’t want to do. Show a little self-
discipline and take care of the internal matters first. Doing that not only 
ensures that the work will get done; it also demonstrates to others that 
you have your act together when you approach them for a joint effort. 
There’s a lot of empty talk in this business, so people are always hesitant 
to engage in what could be a complete waste of their time should the 
other party turn out to be flaky.
I’ll offer one final note on working with others, and it may seem a bit 
harsh—but reality is often an unforgiving soul. You’re going to be tempted 
to lean heavily on others when it comes to things you don’t like doing. 
With the right people, this can be a great arrangement. However, people 
aren’t always dependable. If this is true in life, it’s even more accurate in 
the flighty world of the artistically minded.
Building a mutually beneficial arrangement is a great idea when it works, 
but you have to be prepared to go the entire road alone, doing every 
task as best you can. Only then are you truly in control of your own 
career. When working with others, keep an eye on how consistent and 
dependable they are. If you see early indications that they’re more prone 
to delivering excuses than their fair share of results, pull the plug quickly 
and politely. It’s far better to salvage a good friendship than maintain a bad 
business relationship, and trust me, if they’re not taking care of business, 
bad feelings will arise.
No matter how many friends and supporters you have, when it’s all said 
and done you are the only person responsible for your career. Take that 
responsibility seriously and you’ll be greatly rewarded.

Going the 
Distance
One of the most effective networking techniques you can employ has 
nothing to do with attending meet ups, honing your elevator pitch, or 
trying to impress a roomful of complete strangers. Not only is it easy 
to do; it’s something that even the most marketing averse can comfort-
ably embrace. The best way to enhance your image and spread the word 
about your art is by helping others in your field.
Reputation is a volume business with a long-term payoff that continues to 
grow over time. When you lend a hand to others, don’t expect an imme-
diate payoff. In fact, don’t expect a benefit at all. Doing so will diminish the 
value of your actions in the eyes of others, and thus the effort will do little 
to help you. Rather than being seen as a really cool person who takes the 
time to help others, people will see you as a crass and calculating manipu-
lator who’s just using them for your own benefit. They’ll be correct.
By now, you might be wondering why you should bother helping others, at 
least from a marketing point of view, if you’re not going to get anything in 
return. After all, the time and effort you spend showing another artist how 
to improve her career could be more productively spent on your own. 
The value of this approach is more clearly evident if you once again reach 
for your wide-angle lens and look at your career from beginning to end.
Life Is Long
No one knows how many years they have to live. Some don’t survive for 
long, particularly in the arts. However, if you look at the total number of 
creative people and average out the lifespan, you’ll find that very few die

in their ­twenties. With the continual advances in science and medicine, 
we’re living longer than ever before. We’re also much healthier as we age 
and thus able to live life to its fullest well into old age. People living into 
their nineties is nothing unusual these days.
Stan Lee, the legendary creative force of Marvel Comics, was born in 1922. 
I watched the Hollywood blockbuster movie The Avengers in 2013. As is 
often the case with superhero movies, he had a brief cameo. That same 
year, he was involved in a host of creative projects including a YouTube 
series and personal appearances. If you have your pocket calculator handy, 
you’ll note that this was all done when he was ninety-years-old.
The fact that he’s successful and famous doesn’t make longevity any less 
­relevant for the rest of us. We don’t suddenly lose all creative urges when 
we turn thirty. I mention this particular age because the creative arts, from 
music to software development and all points in between, are very youth 
oriented in nature.
When you don’t have much life experience behind you, it’s easy to get 
caught up in the perspective that comes from living in a bubble. In their 
song “My Generation,” The Who famously wrote, “Hope I die before I get 
old.” That’s the view from a young person who sees old age and creativity 
as mutually exclusive. I saw The Who perform at the Super Bowl halftime 
show a few years ago. They’d changed the line to, “Don’t want to die.  
I want to get old.”
I grew up in the shadow of the Vietnam  War with a possible future involving  
M-16s and dangerous jungles lurking just over the horizon. I was lucky 
enough to graduate high school the year they were airlifting the last 
Americans off the Saigon embassy rooftop, so up to that point, I can 
assure you, getting old was something that was very appealing to me. It 
seems The Who reached this same conclusion, even if it took them longer 
to figure it out.
If you start your creative career at the age of twenty and then find your-
self, like Stan Lee, still very much active at ninety, that’s seventy years of 
making a living in the arts. For the geeks among you, that’s 25,550 days, the 
occasional leap year notwithstanding. The amount of time you spend in 
your twenties is trivial by comparison. As you’ve probably already figured 
out at this point, that’s excellent news and paints a very bright picture for 
your future. It gives you a very long time to figure things out and build a 
solid, reliable career.
You can have a long artistic career, so don’t assume the fun ends at thirty. Picasso, Dali, and 
Monet worked well into their eighties. And the good news for middle-agers: you have plenty of 
time to make a name for yourself.

Fresh out of high school and entering the working world for the first 
time, you probably thought fifty was old. In fact, mathematically speaking, if 
you live to one hundred, it’s the literal definition of midlife. At that point, 
you’re only halfway through the game. Unlike a few centuries ago, we’re no 
longer cane-wielding men and little old ladies at that age. We’re out play-
ing racquetball, riding motorcycles, and producing some of the best work 
of our creative lives thus far.
All of these age-related considerations are important to your career. One 
area where the implications come into play is reputation building. Suddenly, 
getting an instant return on your investment of time and effort is less 
important. If you do some work today that won’t produce any benefit this 
week, that’s okay as long as it will at some point down the line. Today, you 
want fame and fortune, or at least enough money to eat something besides 
noodles. Three decades from now, you’re still going to enjoy fame and for-
tune as well as the occasional meal that doesn’t include cheap pasta.
Consequently, sometimes you work for today; other times you invest in 
the future. Building a reputation among your peers by being the one who’s 
always ready to help them out is therefore no different than putting your 
money into a long-term savings account. The investment keeps getting 
more valuable with each passing year.
Lend a Hand
The mechanics of how you can help others are as varied as the arts. In 
general, they’re easy enough to understand by looking at your own career. 
You’ll find many areas where you’re confident and competent. It’s likely 
that you’ll also find a number of things that you struggle with, whether it’s 
due to a lack of the requisite skill or just an aversion to doing stuff that 
you don’t enjoy. Either way, things still need to get done and you’ve prob-
ably wished that a guardian angel would show up, wield a magic wand, and 
solve all these problems.
If you look around and see the careers of your friends, you’ll notice that 
they also have areas of weakness. The more extroverted of them may 
actually reach out for help, asking you or others to help them accomplish 
something that they’re having trouble with. Others may not directly ask 
for your involvement but will certainly share their frustrations with you.
Unless you’re omnipotent, you won’t be able to help everyone. Some will 
struggle with the exact same shortcomings that plague your own career. 
Others will have needs that exceed the amount of time you’re able to 
give at the moment. In the midst of all of this, however, will be a subset 
of people who are weak where you are strong and whose need doesn’t 
exceed the time you’re able to give.

Chapter 8 | Going the Distance
138
When you see opportunities, don’t wait for an engraved invitation. Wait 
for the opportune moment and then raise the subject. I encourage you 
to consider your timing for a simple but important reason. People can be 
proud—and those in the arts doubly so. If you walk up to someone while 
they’re in the middle of a conversation with their fans and raise a topic 
they’re struggling with, they may feel that it makes them look stupid in 
front of others. It doesn’t matter if this is true or not, only that the person 
feels this way. It will make them uncomfortable and defensive, accomplish-
ing nothing for either of you.
If you wait until it’s just the two of you and then suggest that you might 
be able to help them, you’ll get a completely different reaction. We’re 
rarely opposed to someone giving us a hand if we think the reasons are 
sincere.
What sort of things should you offer to do for others? That will naturally 
vary with both you and those you reach out to, but they fall into two basic 
categories. You can help them grow as an artist and you can offer assis-
tance with the mechanics of their career. You can break those down into 
further subdivisions, but these are the two main branches of the tree.
As with the timing and surroundings of offering help, it’s also worth not-
ing that talking to someone about improving their art can often be seen 
as an offensive gesture. That’s not surprising when you consider that our 
creative efforts come from deep inside us and thus we’re emotionally 
attached to them.
One of my artistic endeavors is playing guitar. I’ve been doing it for a 
while now, and though I’m an average player, I still might have worthwhile 
insights that would help someone who just started playing a couple of 
years ago. Were I to offer this advice unsolicited, it could be translated 
as my saying that the person’s playing was inadequate. Nobody’s going to 
respond well to that.
If I saw a guy having trouble with a technique that I was comfortable with, 
I could mention that it was a tough lick to figure out. If his reply indicated 
that he was open to help, I could offer that I’d been through the same 
struggle and ask if he’d be interested in what I came up with. If it was clear 
that he wanted no interference, the moment would pass and no harm 
done.
Business and marketing topics, on the other hand, are much easier to broach. 
It’s an area most creatives don’t want to deal with in the first place. If you’re 
talking to someone who has difficulty keeping her accounting straight, you’ll 
find a receptive audience should numbers be your thing. If she also struggles 
with putting promotional material together and you know some things that 
would make her life easier, it’s unlikely that she’ll be offended by your offer 
of assistance.

139
These are just a couple of examples, of course, but they open up an entire 
world for you in terms of building a reputation as someone who’s a great 
person to know. Seeking out opportunities to help others is time well 
spent. You shouldn’t do so much of it that you don’t take care of business 
in your own life, but it’s a rare person who can’t find at least a little time 
for others.
See the Entire Show
The value of this approach becomes even more evident as you look at 
your entire career. Like a play, your life consists of multiple acts, hopefully 
more than three. Naturally, your reality is quite different in each decade 
of your life. At twenty, you may spend a lot of time hanging out in bars 
and howling at the moon. At thirty, you may find yourself married with 
children, listening to howling of another sort. At forty, you could be ush-
ering your kids off to college or careers of their own, leaving you more 
free time for creativity. At fifty, it’s likely that your kids are the ones who 
are married with children and your role as a grandparent leaves you vast 
amounts of time for your art.
As it turns out, your audience isn’t planning on dying anytime soon, either. 
They may spend a lot of their time going to work, raising a family, and doing 
all those other things that normal people do, but they still need entertain-
ment. In fact, if you’ve ever had the experience of working a job or raising 
a family, you’ll know that pleasant diversions are most welcome.
The implications for both you and your audience are encouraging. What 
you have to say as an artist will change over time, as will the needs and 
taste of your audience. Leaving your twenties behind doesn’t mean the 
end of creativity. It merely changes how you create, usually for the ­better. 
The experienced journeyman does much better work than the new 
apprentice.
In some cases, your initial audience will follow you throughout the 
decades, since the cultural perspective you have as you age will often stay 
in sync with that of your fans. However, they’re not your only following. 
Increasingly, doubtless due to the way the Internet has of exposing us to 
so many slices of life, younger generations are more open-minded than 
ever before.
I remember one night when I was shooting scenes for a Web series I was 
directing. I walked into the main studio and heard one of the twenty-year-
old interns singing a Kansas song. This was a band that was popular in the 
1970s, before he was even born. I’d seen a lot of age-related prejudice in 
my youth and had a fair dose of it myself. Music created by the young was 
good. The work of older people was bad, even embarrassing. So I asked 

Chapter 8 | Going the Distance
140
him why he was singing something that came from old-timers. He looked 
at me as if he didn’t understand the question, shrugged his shoulders, and 
simply said that good music was good music.
As you age, don’t fall into the trap of assuming that younger people won’t 
like what you do. The new generations are smarter and more accepting 
than ever before. Create something cool and you’ll find them to be some 
of your greatest supporters.
Kids today are far more open to art created by people much older than themselves than the 
youth of the 1960s or ’70s were. You may find them among your most enthusiastic supporters.
Just as your art and audience evolve over the decades, so too do your oppor-
tunities to help others. Your twenties will be a time of much  discovery. 
Your creative abilities will expand in leaps and bounds. You’ll also learn a 
great deal about the business of your art, much of it the hard way.
Given that you’re still looking at over half a century of living, growing, and 
learning yet to come, you might think that you don’t have a lot to offer 
your peers at this point. However, that’s not an accurate outlook. You 
don’t have to be the wise, old master on the mountain to be of value to 
others. All you need is one thing that you can do better than the next guy, 
and a willingness to share it.
Once you cross the decade boundary into your thirties, you will gain not 
only the benefit of experience but also the street cred of being an elder. 
It doesn’t matter that thirty is far from old, only that—to those in their 
twenties—you’re no longer one of them. While being in an older age 
group is sometimes met with prejudice, when it’s time to extend a hand it 
translates instead into gravitas. Whereas it might seem presumptuous for 
a twenty year old to offer to mentor another twenty year old, if you make 
that offer at thirty-five, it seems sensible and generous.
As you work your way through each decade of your life, you’re going to 
have an increasingly effective arsenal at your disposal to combat the dif-
ficulties of life as a creative creature. Your perspective will be different at 
each stage, as will be those of your contemporaries. You’ll also see the 
potholes in the road behind you more clearly, making you all the more 
valuable to those about to break an ankle.
Additionally, you’ll be accumulating more wealth, at least in terms of your 
 reputation. If you helped someone out last week, it was a nice gesture. If 
you’ve been doing it for three decades, you’re a respected figure in your 
art. Even if you live and work in a single city your entire life, others travel 
and word gets around.

In the movie Rock Star, a singer in local a metal tribute band gets his big 
break by being asked to join the rock group he idolizes. The introduction 
comes by way of two female fans of his tribute band.
Rather than treating them in a dismissive manner, like groupies who merit 
no respect, he interacts with the girls as friends. They end up going back-
stage at a concert and getting to know the famous band and thus make 
the introduction. Connections are made in ways that you can never pre-
dict. People talk. What will they say about you?
Avoiding Displacement
Age is a double-edged sword. As it increases, we gain experience, wis-
dom, and expertise. In the youth-oriented culture of the creative arts, 
however, it’s also a liability. Industry moguls are often looking for the next 
new thing. They assume that this can only come from the young and thus 
dismiss anyone who isn’t that. Advantage: youth.
That’s not the end of the story, however. Ask any young person who’s 
just starting out about the difficulties that they encounter and you’ll hear 
a common refrain. The room is always crowded, filled with the existing 
players who have established themselves and thus get all the really good-
gigs. The young have no track record, no connections, and more often 
than not, no street smarts when it comes to how things work. You’ll 
hear constant grumbling about how tough it is to break into the business. 
They’re being pushed aside by the older players who have learned how to 
protect their turf. Advantage: age.
As you can see, it’s not a completely unbalanced game. Nonetheless, you 
will one day elbow your way into the room, which will result in someone 
else being pushed out. When you’re just starting out, this is good news. 
You made it into the room. However, as the decades go by, you’ll become 
increasingly aware of the younger elbows that come perilously close to 
your personal space.
In fact, there’s a common curve to the career of a creative creature. It 
starts at zero, where you have no connections and no gigs, only talent and 
desire. As you learn the ropes, things progress in a skyward direction. 
Whether you hit the big time or plateau at the local scene, you may hang 
around there for quite some time. Eventually, however, it’s common for 
the curve to trend downward as you continue to age. You can very easily 
end up back at zero even though you have many more decades of artistic 
work still in you. In short, you’ve been displaced by others.
The most amazing thing about this scenario is that we tend to get bet-
ter and better at what we do the longer we do it. You would therefore 
assume that the curve would instead be a straight line that always went 

Chapter 8 | Going the Distance
142
up, to match your ever-increasing abilities. Instead, what we find is that 
a songwriter is brilliant this year. Two decades later, even though she’s 
that much better, she’s nowhere to be found. The industry has swept her 
aside, the implication being that her music is no longer good enough to 
sell. Logically, it makes no sense. Unfortunately, reality is rather apathetic 
to the pleas of logic.
The average career curve is common, but it’s not an immutable law. 
The Rolling Stones began life as twenty-something kids immersed in the 
­rebellious, youth-oriented culture of 1960s rock-and-roll. They’re still 
working today. Mick Jagger is seventy. To those who believe that rock is a 
young man’s game, the thought of someone’s grandfather prancing about 
onstage will elicit an unsurprisingly prejudiced response—“Ew, gross.” 
Those are the battles and preconceived notions you’ll face in later years 
as you attempt to work in a genre that has a bias toward youth.
Obviously, it’s a fight you can win, or the Stones would have long since 
faded into obscurity. Most of their contemporaries from the 1960s did 
exactly that. Being rich and famous is no guarantee of longevity. There 
were a lot of bands from that era who were at the top of the charts and 
sold lots of records. Today, they’re nowhere to be found.
There is no single explanation for the success achieved by Stan Lee, the 
Rolling Stones, or any other such survivor. It’s often a combination of influ-
ences. There are, however, things that tilt the scales in your favor. If we 
come down out of the clouds, leaving behind the world of rock stars, and 
look at the local scene, we can filter out some of the factors that might 
obscure our vision. Without fame, fortune, and millions of fans, we’re left 
to consider the simple day-to-day things that can help us eat next week.
When you reach the top of the curve and are looking at a potential 
downward trend, how will you protect yourself? Much of this depends 
on what you did along the way. An old adage known to all in the artistic 
community aptly observes that the same people you meet on your way 
up are the ones you’ll see on your way down.
If you’ve been a completely self-centered, egotistical jerk during your rise 
to the top of the heap, what sort of help do you think you’re going to get 
when the gigs become slim? Not only will there be few willing to do you 
any favors, many will enjoy watching you crash back to earth with a sense 
that you’re finally getting what you deserve.
Now consider what life looks like when you’ve spent decades going out of 
your way to help people, asking for nothing in return other than the fun 
of seeing others learn, grow, and do well. It’s likely that the people who 
­benefitted from your actions and advice are on the curve behind you, still 
on their way up. Additionally, if you’re still living the way you always have, 
you’re reaching as far behind you as possible to give someone else a leg up.

If your art suddenly falls out of favor and jobs become scarce, what sort 
of reaction do you think your friends will have?
People aren’t perfect and not everyone is a noble spirit. There will be 
plenty of times in your life where you’ll do something nice only to find 
down the line that a recipient of your efforts won’t even take your phone 
call. We’ll write off this predictable percentage as nothing more than the 
cost of doing business. Everyone else is going to see that you’re having dif-
ficulties and be inclined to do what they can. Introductions will be made 
and opportunities will be offered.
Sometimes you’ll do valuable things for people that ultimately go unappreciated. Don’t take 
it personally. Consider it a cost of doing business. That’s all the more reason to help others 
without the expectation of return. When you give from the heart, you’ll never be disappointed.
In some cases, the people you helped will have no power to return the 
favor. That won’t stop them from talking about you, and word gets around. 
A gig that came about through the friend of a friend of a friend is a gig 
nonetheless.
People Power
It’s not what you know, it’s who you know. We’ve all heard that time and 
again, probably because it’s so true. You can be tremendously talented and 
watch the work go to lesser souls. The business world isn’t fair, and that 
doesn’t change just because we’re talking about creative pursuits.
It’s worth reiterating from time to time that this is business. People don’t 
give you money out of the kindness of their hearts. They pay you because 
they receive something of value in return. In the case of a bar, theater 
company, advertising agency, or any other such commercial enterprise 
who hires you, they do it because they’re expecting to make a profit in 
return. Therefore, you must first and foremost be a resource that will 
benefit those who have the money. Without that, all bets are off.
However, even if you have sufficient qualities to be a marketable commod-
ity, your success is far from assured. You’ll encounter plenty of instances 
where you would have been just as good a choice, or perhaps even better, 
but someone else got the gig. How can this be? The answer lies with our 
old friend, human nature.
A business exists to make a profit. However, businesses are run by people. 
As humans, we’re not always logical about how we go about things. Our 
­emotions are involved and we each have our own agenda as well. These 

Chapter 8 | Going the Distance
144
are but two factors relating to the complexities of the human species. The 
complete list is long enough to keep the psychiatric profession occupied 
for many years to come.
When deciding who gets the gig and who doesn’t, it often comes down 
to whom we feel the most comfortable with. There are a great many 
talented people in the world, so it’s usually not difficult to find someone 
who can meet the current needs. That leaves us with the X factor, those 
considerations beyond someone’s talent that help us make the final hiring 
decision.
You could be the nicest person in the world—and even a damn fine artist—but if promoters, 
gallery owners, or agents can’t find an audience for you, they won’t return your calls. After all, 
they’re in business to make a profit. Take an active approach to your career. If you can show 
them how to make money by working with you, they’ll have your number on speed dial.
Should you find yourself in a position where you’re considering three 
equally qualified candidates but one of them is a friend, who are you going 
to hire? If all other things are equal, you can’t be accused of favoritism. 
After all, your friend was just as qualified as everyone else. The fact that 
she knew the right person is just the way it goes.
Of course, not everyone is concerned with matters of ethics, so you’ll 
also find plenty of cases where the other candidates were in fact more 
qualified but the gig went to the friend just the same. How can someone 
get away with that? People get away with unethical things all the time. 
That’s life.
Assuming you possess enough talent to make you a good choice for 
whatever work you seek, the person with the work is going to need 
a tiebreaker. That’s where relationships come in, and there’s absolutely 
nothing wrong with that. If you’ve spent your entire career making friends 
and creating bonds because you have gone out of your way to help others, 
there’s actually a certain amount of justice in you landing the gig. After 
all, if you built bridges while others were content to simply walk on them, 
why shouldn’t you get special consideration?
Once again we find that reputation is a volume business. Sure, you can 
make one friend and ultimately end up catching a break because of it. 
However, you’re going to be in this business for a long time. Therefore, 
the more friends you have, the better your overall odds in good times 
and bad.

The Benefits of Benevolence
I have mixed emotions on many philosophical matters. It’s true that I came 
of age at a time when social trends embraced spirituality, peace, and love. 
I’m a fan of all those things, and it would be great to live in a world where 
we could all just hold hands and be nice to each other. I’m also a fan of 
practicality. For me, it’s not enough for a concept to sound appealing. It has 
to actually work out here in the real world, where life isn’t fair and people 
are less than perfect, or it quickly loses me. Perhaps that’s a character flaw. 
Heaven knows I have enough of them.
I mention this because I’ve heard lots of advice over the years that was 
noble in spirit but unwise in practice. If you spend a lot of time thinking 
positive thoughts, you’re going to have a positive attitude. That’s a practi-
cal benefit. However, if you sit in your living room doing nothing but think-
ing, it’s likely that nothing is exactly what’s going to happen in your career. 
You have to get out on the streets and take action.
Even so, advising you to go out and be nice to other people might also 
sound like a bit of a “Don’t worry, be happy” philosophy. As you can see, 
however, there are practical benefits to benevolence when done in the 
proper spirit. That said, I’m aware of the fact that this requires a leap of 
faith for some. I’m suggesting that you go out of your way to help other 
people without requiring, or even expecting, something in return, all with 
the promise that it’ll work in your favor over the course of time. When 
put that way, it’s almost enough to make me question the effectiveness of 
this approach myself.
Fortunately for my own sanity, there is indeed an X factor to assure me 
that I’m not just selling snake oil. The magic ingredient is experience. I’ve 
been around for a few years and have a fair amount of road behind me. 
What I lean on when I question my own thinking is empirical evidence.
I’ve seen cause and effect, in my life as well as that of others, enough times 
to know that the long-term payoff to benevolent living really does exist. 
I’ve landed plenty of gigs because a friend I’d helped out in the past called 
up to do something nice for me. I’ve watched others encounter what to 
all the world looked like a lucky break when I knew that it was simply the 
payoff of a good reputation. Consequently, I’m willing to live with my inner 
demons whistling “Don’t worry, be happy,” even when they’re not in tune.
If, like me, you find value in a long-term approach to career building, you 
might be tempted to reach for the nearest social media outlet and limit 
your activities to that domain. While you should use every tool at your 
disposal, it’s important to recognize that a significant amount of network-
ing that takes place in such scenarios is really little more than a meaning-
less computer game.

No, you really don’t have 243,817 friends. That’s just the number of peo-
ple that pushed a button on a Web site. You probably have had very 
few intimate, or even significant, interpersonal interactions with most of 
them. There’s nothing wrong with using the Internet to expand and con-
nect with your audience as long as you don’t mistake the practice for 
something that it’s not. Anonymous interaction with thumbnail images 
on a computer screen is not an adequate substitute for connecting with 
people in the real world.
Social media isn’t as social as you may think. Nothing takes the place of human interaction in 
the real world. That’s where you can do, and receive, favors that will boost your artistic career in 
many ways. There’s nothing like hanging out with real people to brighten your day.
In a similar fashion, those extroverted souls who go to all the networking 
events aren’t much closer to the mark. Yes, there’s absolutely a benefit 
to increasing the number of contacts that you make in life, as long as you 
don’t confuse it with making real connections. As with Internet-based 
experiences, there’s no rule that you can’t do both. It’s only important that 
you know the difference.
While there’s value in both physical and computerized networking activi-
ties, reaching out even this much is difficult for many artistic people. That’s 
where making a personal connection with people you actually know turns 
out to be a powerful tool that’s also easy to employ.
A guy who’s self-conscious about walking around the room and introduc-
ing himself to a bunch of strangers has no trouble tossing back a couple 
of beers with a few friends. The girl who has no desire to spend time on 
a computer still has a good time having dinner with the people she sees 
on a regular basis. In both cases, it’s easy because there’s no pretension, no 
sales involved. You’re not forcing yourself on someone else. You’re talking 
to people you know. Consequently, it’s easy to do. The things that are easy 
get done. We tend to avoid those that aren’t.
Helping someone you know is also more powerful than having anonymous 
interactions. There’s a personal connection, and that’s the sort of thing 
people remember. Posting an inspirational message on your Facebook 
page isn’t quite the same.
Now I’m going to completely contradict myself, or so it may initially seem. 
There’s great value in building relationships with people over the Internet. 
If you think I just spent the last few paragraphs saying exactly the opposite, 
go back and read them again. Or, if you’re as impatient as I usually am, I’ll 
give you the shortcut. The keyword here is relationship.

is spreading the word, but it’s not building relationships. They’re two dif-
ferent things, each with their own value. Of the two, the latter is far more 
powerful. It’s also something you can do while sitting at a computer.
Like many people, I hang out on a few Web sites dedicated to my inter-
ests, usually participating in forums. People often come to such places with 
questions. I usually don’t have the answers, but when I do, I enjoy sharing. 
However, it often goes beyond throwing out an answer and then diving 
back into the tall grass. Conversations take place, I get to know people, and 
on many occasions we’ll get together via e-mail to continue our friendship 
in a more direct manner.
Even though I’ve never met some of these people in person, I nonetheless 
consider them friends. In many cases, I give them the same kind of help 
that I would were they sitting on my living room couch having a beer with 
me. They do the same for me, as is the case among friends.
The key distinction here is getting to know people on a personal level. 
It’s possible to do this on a social media site, in a crowded roomful of 
networking strangers, on a topic-specific forum, at a gig, or at most any 
other such venue. A hit-and-run approach that leaves behind nothing but 
your elevator pitch and business card won’t build a friendship. Getting to 
know people, understanding the difficulties they have in their careers, and 
helping where you can will build relationships that last.
If you put time and effort into connecting with others, you’ll benefit in 
a variety of ways. You’ll certainly generate good karma. I wouldn’t even 
attempt to quantify that nor could I readily explain it, but I’ve seen enough 
instances of good things coming out of the clear blue sky to acknowledge 
that something more than sheer dumb luck is at play.
A benefit that I can certainly explain, and have explained at length, is an 
enhanced reputation. The more that people know you as a good spirit 
who takes the time to help others build their careers, the more status 
you earn. With that comes the goodwill of others, often when you need 
it most.
There’s an additional perk to this kind of living that’s specific to the ­creative 
crowd. Like good karma, it’s a bit difficult to explain. When you practice 
benevolent living on a regular basis, it becomes a habit and your life reso-
nates with it. Inspiration often comes from an indefinable source, but I’ve 
found that the more I’m helping others, the more that part of me opens 
up. I get new ideas, greater motivation, and a stronger creative urge.
Perhaps more scientific minds could elaborate on the mechanics in a 
­nuts-and-bolts fashion, but when it comes to the muse, I don’t require an 
explanation. All I know is that when I help people I feel good, and when 

Chapter 8 | Going the Distance
148
I feel good, I’m at my most creative. Simplistic, perhaps, but I’m a simple 
creature. Sometimes all that matters to me is that things work.
Don’t wait for someone to ask. Actively look for opportunities to make 
someone else’s life better. You’ll gradually gain a good reputation, along 
with much love and respect in your field. This is a volume business, and 
one that takes time to yield results. Even so, people talk. When opportu-
nity arises, who do you think they’re going to share it with?

The Power 
Behind the 
Throne
Anyone who’s been around understands that it’s the assistants who rule 
the world. They decide what calls get through. They have countless con-
tacts. They handle all the daily details. Simply put, if you want to get some-
thing done, chances are good that at some point in the process you’ll have 
to go through an assistant.
Many people dream of being discovered, that magical event that will trans-
port them to a life of fame and fortune. Others have a dream that’s less 
unrealistic, if only by a small degree. Rather than waiting passively for 
some important person to walk through the door, notice their work, and 
sign them to a ­gazillion-dollar deal, they go big-game hunting.
Promotional materials and demos in hand, they make the rounds trying to 
get in front of top executives in their industry. As you might suspect, they 
meet with very few high-level players. They do, however, encounter a lot 
of assistants. If you’ve ever heard any of these tales from your friends, the 
people at the front desk are rarely referred to as anything but an obstruc-
tion, a roadblock to success that they were unable to pass.
While it’s doubtless a frustration to pin your hopes on meeting some-
one powerful enough to grant your wishes only to be denied, the people 
between you and this exalted figure get an unfairly bad rap. They’re not the 
enemy. In fact, they’re some of the best friends you could possibly have.

“Gatekeeper” is usually used as an insult. In truth, the person standing at the gate can be a boon 
to your career, swinging the gate open at just the right time. But only if you’re nice.
The Pyramid Effect
To give you an idea of how these people fit into the grand scheme of 
things, it’s useful to take a field trip to the corporate world, where we can 
see some of their relatives in their native habitat. Don’t stick your fingers 
inside the cages, please. They’re not as tame as they appear.
We’ll start by looking at a map. In the business world, that’s the org chart, 
corporate slang for the collection of boxes and lines that document who 
reports to whom. It looks very much like a pyramid, even if it doesn’t have 
a snazzy-looking sphinx guarding it.
At the top, you typically have a position like president or CEO. The few 
boxes just under that are senior staff, which continues onto the parade 
of C-level executives, such as the CFO, CIO, and COO. They’re the chief-
financial,  information, and operations officers, and they’re at the top of 
their own little pyramids for their respective departments. They don’t 
have a sphinx, either.
From there, it expands out in a similar fashion, with vice presidents, direc-
tors, managers, and so on, each reporting to someone above and having 
a few people who directly report to them of their own. Not represented 
on the typical org chart are the working class, the people who do the 
actual work of the business. In a manufacturing facility, those who design 
the products and work the assembly lines to create them don’t get their 
own little boxes. Instead, they’re represented merely by the box of their 
manager.
Representation and man-headed lions aside, this accurately sums up the 
way most industries work. At the highest level, you have the ultimate 
 decision maker. Responsible for the entire organization, the CEO doesn’t 
have time to get into the details of each and every issue. Instead, she 
depends on those who report to her for a summary of that information.
Travelling down to each successive level of the chart, the story is very 
much the same. However, with each level you go down, more detail work 
is required by the person in the box and the decision-making power is 
more limited. When you get to the very bottom of the pyramid, that 
invisible level not represented on paper, you have the working-class stiffs 
whose jobs entail zero decision making and all detail. In other words, they 
do the work and have no say in the matter.

Assistants don’t live on the lowest level. Instead, they occupy a position 
of virtual authority that’s part illusion, part reality. For example, the CEO 
doesn’t answer her own phone nor does she type up her correspon-
dences. For these details and many others, she relies on her executive 
assistant, often referred to as an EA.
Virtual Power
Naturally, it would be most inconvenient to have a CEO with an office in 
the penthouse suite while the EA has a desk in the basement of the build-
ing. That’s why you’ll find the assistant right up there with the CEO. The 
desk won’t be as fancy, and it might even be in a cubicle. It will, however, 
be up there in the penthouse.
While it’s not how the world really works, for a moment let’s imagine a 
­skyscraper filled with workers. From the basement to the penthouse, each 
floor makes a little more money and has a bit more status than the floor 
below. When viewed from this perspective, you have an EA whose actual 
pay scale would be in the lowest third of the building. And yet, his office 
is in the penthouse because that facilitates easy communication between 
him and his boss.
Then there’s power. While officially, the assistant has no more authority 
than his salary would indicate, there are different types of power. Middle 
managers many floors above him make much more money and have abso-
lute power over the people they employ. They’re certainly higher up on 
the food chain than our assistant. He merely answers the phone and does 
the paperwork for an executive.
Therefore, on paper the assistant is much less powerful than the middle 
managers. In reality, however, it would be a very foolish mistake to act on 
this assumption. I know. I spent a lot of years in the corporate world and 
watched many step on this landmine without realizing how stupid it was.
If you’re a big, hotshot manager with an ego to match, you may not feel the 
need to show respect for someone’s hired typist. In fact, you may consider 
him quite beneath you and treat him accordingly. Technically, there’s noth-
ing the EA can do, as he has no authority over you. Meanwhile, back in the 
real world, he spends all day, every day, interacting with the CEO, who is 
the most powerful person in the company.
We’re all accustomed to the idea that if you want to see an important 
­person, you make an appointment with her assistant. This also applies 
to the ­passing of information. Rather than leaving voice mail, people will 
instead explain the issue to the EA with the expectation that it will be sum-
marized and ­compressed into a message that fits the executive’s busy life.

Chapter 9 | The Power Behind the Throne
152
In short, these administrative workers, who are often treated as lowly 
clerks, do a great deal of filtering, interpreting, and other subtle tasks that 
have a ­significant effect on what you’re trying to accomplish. The power is 
implied, not explicit, but it exists just the same.
As an example, imagine that there are three managers who are all com-
peting for control of a project. The CEO will ultimately make the decision, 
and each of them are eager to make their case and impress the boss. One 
of them also treats the EA with consistent disrespect.
Through long association, the EA knows that by the end of the day the 
CEO is tired, a bit frazzled, and often very impatient. We all have our little 
quirks. When the time comes to schedule meetings for the managers’ big 
presentations, the two who are nice to the EA will get early-morning slots, 
when her boss is fresh and in the most receptive mood. The jerk will get 
a time slot wedged in at the very latest point in the day.
If all three managers were equal in every way, which one is now at the 
­greatest disadvantage? The guy with the late appointment will have to 
work much harder to impress, and may well fail no matter how good the 
presentation.
In short, he got screwed. In fairness, he brought it on himself. While  
I advocate treating all people with respect just because it’s a nice way to 
live, I certainly advise against being rude to the people who stand between 
you and what you want. It’s just bad strategy.
Worker Bees
I hope you all enjoyed your brief tour of the corporate world. Please be 
sure to deposit your empty popcorn bags in the recycling bins located 
conveniently near the exit.
While some creative careers do in fact intersect with the traditional 
world of business, most of us aren’t going to be talking to the EA of a 
major executive. If we get anywhere near the penthouse suite, it’s a pretty 
good bet that ­security will be involved. This doesn’t imply that we don’t 
deal with the assistant class. It just means that they have different titles 
and perform duties beyond the clerical. Beyond that, the same rules apply. 
Ignore them at your peril.
Whether it’s a Fortune 500 company or your local art gallery, the pyramid 
effect is always present. One aspect of this is the top-down organization 
of decision making. Another part of the picture involves the knowledge 
and capability required to perform low-level tasks. In fact, you might say 
that the degree of hands-on expertise is inversely proportionate to the 
position of authority.

The pyramid power structure is most visible in the corporate world. But it operates in  
scaled-down form in nearly any organization you can think of. With a little practice, you’ll see 
who stands behind the throne whispering in the queen’s ear.
The higher up you go, the less likely you are to find someone who knows 
how to pop the hood of a Corvette and rebuild the engine. Instead, they 
know how to manage people who have these skills. Both have an impor-
tant role to play in the grand scheme of things, but if I want to beef up the 
engine of my ’Vette, I’m not calling the manager unless it’s to get the num-
ber of the mechanic. I want the guy who knows how to turn wrenches.
While it’s true that some people rise to the top by working their way 
through the ranks, it’s not a requirement. Additionally, spend enough time 
in the upper levels and you can lose touch with the day-to-day details that 
your people are handling for you.
In the world of film and video, production assistants, commonly known as 
PAs, perform a wide variety of tasks. In fact, on lower-budget productions 
that can’t afford to have an official person in every slot, a decent chunk of 
the details are done by PAs, making it a bit of a catch-all job title.
Need coffee? An assistant will grab you a cup. She may also be the person 
who snaps the slate in front of the camera before each shot and then 
quickly sets it aside to grab the script and feed the actor his lines. When 
the lighting director needs gels or a fixture moved, it may be the PA who 
does the work. Can’t afford a boom-pole operator? No problem. You just 
teach the PA how to hold one.
Long before your production was ready for shooting, it may have been the 
PA who performed the script breakdown, the tedious and detail-oriented 
task of cataloging all the production elements implied by the script. In a 
hundred-page movie script, you need to know how many locations there 
are, what equipment needs to be rented, and many other such details. All 
of these things need to be first identified and then later managed.
In this case, I’m talking about the world of video, but you can see this 
played out in every industry. There will always be detail-oriented tasks to 
be ­performed. Sometimes, you can afford to hire a person dedicated to 
each job. Many times, you can’t. In the latter case, it’s always the assistants 
who pick up the slack. This means that these helpers will frequently have 
a lot more expertise than their title implies. Need to get something done 
and don’t know how? Ask an assistant.
Even if they don’t know how to perform a task personally, they have 
another virtue that comes with the territory. When the director needs 
set designers, electricians, recording engineers, and several other groups 

Chapter 9 | The Power Behind the Throne
154
of people to perform specific tasks, he doesn’t spend an evening on the 
phone. He gives his needs to the assistant, who does the research, places 
the calls, and either hands out the job or gives the recommendations back 
to the boss for final approval.
If you’re getting the idea that these people make a lot of contacts, you’re 
beginning to see another example of their power and utility. Need to get 
something done and even your assistant doesn’t know how to do it? No 
problem. She knows someone who does.
Another example of what this class of people can do for you was illus-
trated in the long-running TV sitcom M*A*S*H. The de facto adminis-
trative assistant was corporal Radar O’Reilly, who did the paperwork, 
handled the phone calls, and dealt with other such mundane work.
He was also a power broker by virtue of his bartering network. Since 
­supplies were often hard to come by through official channels, he would 
get on the phone to the assistants in other camps, telling them what he 
needed and ­finding out what he could trade in return. If you wanted to get 
something done, you didn’t call a general. You called Radar, who would call 
the assistant to the general and work out a deal.
This is exactly what happens in the creative world. Those who populate 
these supporting positions have their finger on the pulse of the industry. 
The phone calls and correspondences go through them. They hear their 
bosses talking about the high-level problems. They know who’s getting 
what work and why. While their bosses work with each other across 
the country and spanning the globe, the assistants do the same, building 
relationships with people in numerous industries. They are the Radars of 
the creative world, and every bit as powerful.
Those who seem the most powerful on paper—the director, the CEO, the music mogul—would 
be lost without the assistants who know how to get things done. A CEO might issue an order, 
but it’s the well-connected assistant who makes it happen.
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
We’re accustomed to treating powerful people with respect. Surprisingly, 
for all the influence that they subtly wield, the assistants of the world get 
very little of it. They do a great deal of the work, are paid on the lower 
end of the scale, and have the least status. They’re treated dismissively by 
those who go through them to get to their superiors, and often by their 
bosses themselves.

Much of our behavior in life is learned by watching others. You might think 
that a wolf howls at the moon because it’s natural to do so. However, just 
the other day I saw a delightful picture of a wolf, surrounded by small pups, 
­throwing its head back and howling. The pups, emulating the parent, did 
the same. It was captioned, “Howling practice.”
If wolves teach their young how to howl, it’s not surprising that we pick up 
our cues on social behavior by watching others. While this is often ben-
eficial, it can occasionally result in acquiring bad habits. If you see people 
treating assistants with casual contempt, or, at the very least, mild disre-
spect, you may find yourself emulating that behavior without even thinking 
about it. Other times, we act the same as others because we want to fit in. 
Either way, when you give up the right to do your own thinking, you also 
relinquish your ability to control a small portion of your life.
These seemingly unimportant people who schedule the meetings, take the 
calls, and act as your interface to someone more important are not to be 
taken lightly. As we’ve seen, they possess a wealth of information and are 
also well connected. Another thing that people often forget about is the 
mobility factor.
Yes, this guy is an assistant today. He’s also twenty. Where will he be in his 
career at forty? If he’s good at what he does, he may well rise to become 
an important person in his own right, capable of granting your wishes and 
­keeping you working. You can gamble on his not remembering how you 
treated him early in his career if you like. It’s a bad bet.
Excellent assistants get promoted, over and over again. The twenty-five-year-old you dissed in 
1994 now runs the show, and you can be sure that you won’t be a part of it. However, it works 
both ways. We remember those who treat us with kindness and respect. If this is the kind of 
reputation you have, that same person will open doors for you that you scarcely knew existed.
So far, we’ve talked a lot about assistants and not much at all about you, so 
let’s turn the tables for a moment. If you understand that these people are 
far more influential than is apparent at first glance, how can you benefit 
from this knowledge?
This goes back to what we were considering in the previous chapter: 
Building relationships is one of the most powerful, long-term strategies 
you can adopt to improve your career. When it comes to assistants, you’ll 
often see positive results in the short term as well.
In their position, it’s common to be treated as unimportant. That means 
when someone like you comes along and shows respect, they notice.  
It makes you stand out from the crowd. As is always the case, sincerity is 

Chapter 9 | The Power Behind the Throne
156
paramount. It’s not a matter of treating them with shallow flattery. That 
sort of thing is transparent and obvious to everyone but the person offer-
ing it. If, instead, you’re actually nice to them and treat them with the same 
respect you’d show your friends, it comes across as intended and never 
fails to make an impression.
I once worked for a major corporation in a fancy-looking office building. 
Several times a day, I’d take the elevator down to the lobby level and get 
a cup of coffee from the shop there. The same woman worked there 
all throughout the week. When things weren’t busy, I’d take the time 
to hang out for a few minutes, hear about her day, and just enjoy a little 
conversation.
Often I’d step to the side as some important-looking person rushed in to 
place an order. They were invariably impatient and brusque with whoever 
was at the counter, treating them as little more than flesh-colored robots 
requiring no courtesy whatsoever. They’d get their coffee and just as quickly 
blow back out the door. More than once, I’d ask my friend how she put up 
with this all day. She’d simply shrug her shoulders. That’s just the way it is, 
what are you gonna do?
One day I came to get my coffee, and she reached over the counter to 
hand me a yellow T-shirt. She was a graphic artist and had been to a trade 
show over the weekend. She snagged a few giveaways and thought I’d like 
the shirt, so she brought it for me.
There was no romance, and we didn’t socialize outside of our daily coffee 
encounters. Neither did I treat her with friendship and respect because  
I wanted something in exchange. It’s just the way I am, and she was a nice 
­person who was fun to talk with. I was surprised by the gesture, and while 
neither of us made a fuss about it, I valued the gift greatly. While I never 
saw her again after my job at that building ended, I still have the T-shirt to 
this day.
To everyone else who came through the door, she was just some anony-
mous part of a business transaction. I treated her like a regular person, 
with friendship and respect, and she made a gesture to show me that 
friendship goes both ways.
How you treat people doesn’t go unnoticed, especially when they’re in 
a position that’s accorded little value in the eyes of many. Take the time 
to make someone’s world a little brighter, even if it’s nothing more than 
offering patience, a smile, or a little casual conversation to distract her 
from an otherwise-hectic day.
Doing so improves your reputation and establishes you as someone 
worth knowing. When opportunities are being considered, you’ll often be 
mentioned because you fit the bill and you’re a really nice guy. Sometimes 
g

157
they’ll pass along a tip that can help you out. They may tell you that they 
don’t have any work right now but will offer the number of a friend, or 
perhaps someone a friend works for, who does.
There are many ways you can benefit by treating the working class with 
respect. It’s also one of those things you can do to improve your career 
that has no downside. You’re never going to be at a disadvantage because 
you treated someone with kindness.
Motivation Matters
How you approach your interactions with others is important, so this 
bears emphasizing again. Being kind to others isn’t a transaction, and if you 
approach it as such, it’s going to do you more harm than good. This, of 
course, after I just said there’s no disadvantage to being nice. When you’re 
just yanking someone around because you think you can flatter them into 
helping you out, that’s not kindness. It’s manipulation, and it will justifiably 
make you look bad.
If you’re a shallow, callous, and insensitive person who has no desire to be 
otherwise, none of this is going to help you. People will think you’re a jerk, 
and they’ll be correct. You can try to hide it, but every time you talk with 
another human being, your true nature will come out and there won’t be 
much you can do to disguise it.
Fortunately, it’s a pretty safe bet that this description doesn’t fit you. 
Professional jerks aren’t terribly interested in reading materials such as 
this and wouldn’t have made it past the first chapter. You’re here because 
you want to improve your career and you’d like to enjoy yourself, and the 
­company of others, in the process.
The admonition to keep an eye on your motivations and how they affect 
your approach is valid nonetheless. If you’re sincere about building a bet-
ter livelihood through your creative talents, you’re going to work hard and 
do your best to put these things into practice. It’s perfectly understand-
able if you therefore approach others with a voice in the back of your 
head reminding you to show respect, value the person you’re talking to, 
and so on. Since your motivations are doubtless sincere, a word to the 
wise should be sufficient.
What you’re really doing is becoming more adept at making friends. 
They’re nice to have regardless of the career benefits that may arise. At 
the very least, every time you’re standing in your booking agent’s office 
talking to the receptionist, it’s going to make passing the time an enjoyable 
experience rather than a tedious wait. If it turns out that making friends 
also improves your livelihood, you get the best of both worlds.

Chapter 9 | The Power Behind the Throne
158
When you get right down to it, this is very easy to do. It doesn’t involve 
public-speaking skills, dollars spent on a Dale Carnegie course, or any 
other type of formal and rigorous training. It all comes down to very 
simple actions. Be nice. Be real. You’ll make friends.
Get a Grip
Assistants aren’t the only power behind the throne. In fact, the working 
class of every industry is full of people who can be helpful to your career. 
Most of them you may never have even noticed.
On a Hollywood movie set, grips (the show-biz term for people who 
do manual labor) are often treated as the lowliest of creatures. After all, 
they’re just a bunch of guys swinging hammers, building sets, carting equip-
ment across the parking lot, and other such glamorous chores. And yet, 
they know an enormous amount about production.
When the lighting director decides to set up a particular type of fixture in 
a certain location, it’s often the grip who drags it across the room, braces 
the stand with sandbags, attaches the appropriate gel, and manages the 
focus. On some productions, there are lighting technicians dedicated to 
these tasks, but when the budget is low or there aren’t enough people to 
go around, you can be sure that someone will ask the grip for a hand.
Sure, it was the lighting director who made the decision and gave the direc-
tions. Even so, how many years of paying attention, following instructions, 
and performing the tasks does it take to constitute a formal education? 
The ­lighting guys get the credit. The grips learn how to do the work.
“Grips”—or laborers—exist in all arts-related organizations. These people know a lot about 
making movies, books, software, and more. After all, they’ve been doing these things for years. 
Therefore, don’t hesitate to ask how to do something, like set up stage lights or use a rarely 
employed feature in Photoshop. Not only will they be happy to help; they’ll remember you as 
someone who treated them with respect.
There are countless examples such as this where the guy who shows 
up on the set for the purpose of doing labor ends up acquiring a lot of 
valuable skills. How do I know this? One of my friends is a grip, of course. 
Recently retired, he spent his career working in New York on high-profile 
productions ranging from blockbuster movies to long-running TV and 
cable series.

I met him through conversations in a video-related forum when I was 
directing a sitcom I’d written. This was a garage band project, something 
I did for the pure fun of it and released on the Web with no intention of 
making money. Above and beyond the enjoyment, it was also a learning 
project for me. Making movies was yet another creative art form I wanted 
to pursue, and I learn best by doing.
Because I never worked in the Hollywood or New York movie scene,  
I didn’t care about the social pecking order. To me, this guy was just a friend 
who was very generous about sharing what he’d learned with a rookie 
director. Each week, I’d tell him about this challenge or that ­problem that 
I was having ­difficulty overcoming. Not only did I lack years of experience, 
this project was being funded out of my back pocket. I didn’t have a lot of 
money to throw at solutions the way a major studio could.
Time after time, he’d tell me how he’d seen problems overcome on the 
job. It surprised me to learn that very often it had nothing to do with 
money. Instead, it was the result of a bunch of guys who were on location 
and had to get creative in order to get the job done.
He told me more than once that even in his world of professional film-
makers, nobody was impressed by the fancy gear that you showed up 
with. All that mattered was getting the shot. If that meant standing on top 
of an apple box balancing a street sign on your nose so that the camera-
man could shoot a wiggling stop sign, that’s what you did.
I found lighting particularly daunting at first. Much of my education came 
from his tales of what he learned by dragging lights at the direction of 
others. There were other surprises as well. One day, UPS knocked on my 
front door bearing several six-foot cardboard tubes. I had no idea what 
they were.
Turns out they were filled with partial rolls of lighting gel. On big sets, it’s 
the labor cost that’s the most expensive, so rather than trying to keep up 
with leftover supplies, they just chuck them into the dumpster. My friend 
had collected a lot of this discarded material since it was still perfectly 
usable. Knowing I was just getting started, he bought some shipping tubes, 
packed them up, and sent them to me without saying a word.
While you may not get unexpected deliveries, if you get to know the 
people who are doing the everyday work of your art, you’ll be amazed at 
how much you learn. Stage hands, roadies, art supply dealers, and even the 
guy who sweeps the floors at the local dance school are all embedded in 
the daily ­reality of their art form. All it takes to benefit from their years of 
experience is a pair of ears and a desire to make new friends.

When we were finishing up my sitcom, I listed my friend as a technical 
consultant in the credits. Pretty silly, of course, when you consider the 
multimillion-dollar projects that his name is on, but it was just my way of 
saying thanks. I mention this because there’s one other thing that’s impor-
tant when you learn from the working class—gratitude.
Never pass up an opportunity to express your gratitude.
They’re Everywhere
Speaking of monster movies, our administrative and other working-class 
friends could star in one of their own—They Live Among Us. As with 
Godzilla, they’re not the villain at all, just underappreciated for who they 
truly are.
They’re not that hard to spot, no matter what little corner of creativity 
you call your own. If you’re in the performing arts, you’ll find them in every 
venue. They’re the people who work at bars to the stage hands of your 
local theater company. They’ve also been known to hide away in the back 
office doing computer work, paying bills, and ordering supplies.
Speaking of supplies, as I’ve mentioned before you’ll often find that the 
people who sell you paint, canvas, guitar strings, or dancing shoes are 
 creatives in their own right. Even when you visit a coffee shop, you may 
discover that the person handing you a latte turns out to be a graphic 
 artist. However, many times the people who work for suppliers aren’t 
artistic at all. They’re just regular people who have a job at the store you 
patronize. That doesn’t stop them from being a wealth of information, 
resources, and referrals, at least for their friends.
First contact isn’t just a term used in science fiction movies. It also 
describes the person who greets you when you walk into the office of 
talent agencies, publishers, and other such enterprises. From the recep-
tionist to the executive assistant, these are often people who have the ear 
of the king. They’re also well informed on the things that you care about 
since they’re plugged into the industry.
The working class is an incredibly rich source of technical knowledge. 
They’re also not the sort of people who end up in the spotlight, at least as 
long as they’re working in their current capacity. Not only are they among 
the best educational resources out there; they’re usually a lot of fun to 
hang out with. Free from the pretense and ego that can accompany the 
rock stars, they’re just regular people making a living in an art form that 
they enjoy. You know, just like the rest of us.

Learn to recognize them wherever you go and take the time to get to 
know them. By cultivating relationships, you’ll build a powerful network of 
secret allies, not to mention a formidable knowledge base. It’s also worth 
remembering that people rise through the ranks. Today’s assistant may be 
running the farm and doing the hiring tomorrow.

Paying the Bills
Each field has its own opportunities for making money. Even so, they tend 
to fall into common categories. Whether you’re looking for full-time or 
part-time work, your options are much the same, as are the rules of the 
game. Naturally, not all of the opportunities we cover here will apply to 
you, but even those that don’t may serve as inspiration for other jobs that 
you might pursue.
It’s also good to cultivate multiple streams of revenue whenever possible. 
This might be based on a combination of performing, selling merchandise, 
getting a teaching gig in addition to your main job, or even cultivating cor-
porate clients along with selling directly to your fans, just to name a few.
Most creative types are surprised to learn that the quality of their art is 
only a small part of the equation when it comes to who gets the work. 
As with all things where people are a factor, the secret to success lies in 
developing an understanding of what’s important to the person doing the 
hiring. It’s often not what you think.
With that in mind, let’s take a walking tour of the various sources of 
income available to the average creative creature. I’d recommend a com-
fortable pair of sneakers, but I suspect you’re already wearing them.
Being Discovered
In the entertainment business, the most common approach for those who 
seek fame and fortune is to hone their craft and then hope that they’re 
discovered by some scouting agent. As stereotypes go, the magical person 
they’re waiting for will see the artist’s work, recognize his star potential, 
and then whisk him and his mates away in a long black limousine to a life 
of fabulous prosperity.

Even in the days before most of the creative industries suffered an 
Internet-induced meltdown, this was fantasy of the highest order. The 
fact that the scenario I just illustrated actually happened on rare occasion 
is a terrible thing, as it encouraged people to embrace a career strategy 
that was on par with spending all their money on the lottery each day in 
hopes of striking it rich.
It’s okay to hope that you’ll meet an influential stranger who can forever 
change your life. However, if hoping is all you do, you’re screwed. It is the 
height of folly to sit back and do nothing, taking a passive approach to 
your career while waiting for the good fairy to show up and tap you on 
the head with a magic wand. On second thought, maybe a tap on the head 
is just what the doctor ordered. It might just knock some sense into you.
Am I a mean person for attempting to shatter your hopes and dreams? 
Absolutely not. If you believe in this path to success, I’m merely doing my 
best to watch your back for you, since you’re not doing much of it your-
self. It’s a tough universe out there. Nobody’s going to hand you fame and 
fortune on a silver platter. If you want the goodies, you’re going to have to 
work for them. That may not be a popular thing to say, but truth is often 
an unwelcome guest until it works in your favor.
As I mentioned, there’s nothing wrong with hoping you catch a break. 
I’ve certainly experienced good luck on occasion, and I’m a big fan of it. 
However, you have to manage your life, and your career, with the assump-
tion that you won’t encounter any magical transformations.
If you adopt my recommended line of reasoning, you’ll get out there and 
do all the hard work of creating your own opportunities and good things 
will continually come your way as a result of your efforts. Should some-
one step out of a black limousine and change your life, that’s a nice bonus. 
However, if it never happens, you can still eat on a regular basis. I’m also 
a big fan of eating.
In other words, rather than taking a high-risk all-or-nothing approach to 
success, you’re better off hedging your bets. The everyday work you put 
into moving your career forward will continually yield benefits. You’ll also 
do the work of making sure the limo knows where to find you. That’s the 
hidden part of the Cinderella story that no one ever hears about.
For musicians, the holy grail has always been to land a record contract. 
I have an older cousin in Chicago who’s a much better guitarist than  
I am. He spent a lot of years making a living playing in bars. In addition to 
being talented, he also happens to be a good guy. People just like hanging 
out with him. He kept playing bar gigs but also continually expanded his 
network of people who at one time or another had a good experience 
working with him.

Have Fun, Get Paid
165
One day, he heard from a singer he’d worked with in the past. She’d landed 
a record deal and wasn’t interested in auditioning guitarists. The gig was 
his if he wanted it. He went on to make records with her. He hadn’t sat 
on his tail waiting for the good fairy to show up. He had kept working, 
meeting more people, and building a reputation both as a musician and, 
even more importantly, as someone who was a good guy to hang out with. 
Even if he hadn’t caught a break, he would have kept working and paying 
the bills. This was not a passive career strategy. He worked hard at it.
In the world of writing, many dream of landing a book deal. As with music, 
there’s often the hope that they’ll be discovered, and it’s an equally bad 
bet. The fact that I’ve written books has some good luck attached to it, 
but that good fortune was enabled by commonsense and focusing my 
efforts on the right things.
In the beginning, I knew I was no one from nowhere. As an author, I had 
no resume to speak of. I’d written a column for a new age publication, but 
that wasn’t the sort of thing that was going to get me career and business 
book deals. Consequently, I wrote a column for a popular tech Web site, 
which not only raised my visibility but also made me some money and a 
few more contacts.
The chances of you being “discovered” and living thereafter as a rock star—no matter how great 
your talent—are about the same as buying a winning lottery ticket. You’re better off using the 
money you’d spend on tickets to buy a cheeseburger. Work to create your own opportunities.
From there, I made it known to my friends that I wanted to start writing 
books. One of them introduced me to a friend of his, who in turn intro-
duced me to my publisher. My first book was career advice to program-
mers. One of the industry rock stars, who I got to know because he was 
writing a column for the same Web site as I was, ended up penning the 
foreword to the book.
In my case as well as my cousin’s, there were no spontaneous limousines. 
We considered what actions we could take to move our respective careers 
forward, did the work, and to a large degree created our own luck. There 
are a lot of guys out there who play guitar better than he does, and there 
are certainly writers who are more eloquent than I. We didn’t get these 
gigs because we’re superstars. We got them because we put one foot in 
front of the other, while many with superstar talent chose instead to sit 
on the porch looking for long black automobiles. Dream big, and dream 
often. Then get off your tail and do the work.

Venues
Having dispensed with the quick and easy path to riches, let’s turn our 
attention to the less glamorous but far more exciting topic of paying the 
bills by doing what you love. If you’re a performing artist, much of your 
work will be related to venues. If you’re an actor, the theater itself may not 
pay you. Instead, your paycheck may come from a production company or 
some other such entity that happens to rent the theater. If you’re a dancer, 
you may be paid by the company that you work for, which, once again, 
interacts with the venue itself.
However, this is not a constant. Dinner theater is closer to its seedy 
cousin from the wrong side of the tracks, the nightclub. Both may pay the 
performers directly. In fact, this relationship is common to bands, who 
only start dealing with intermediaries such as promoters when they’ve 
escaped the bars and have moved up to the concert level. Much like musi-
cians, a stand-up comic will probably be working the local comedy clubs, 
dealing with the aspects of larger theaters and halls only when she hits 
the big time.
In its simplest form, a venue is merely a place where people congregate in 
order to see your work. If you read poetry or play acoustic guitar, you may 
also find opportunities far from the glamour of the lighted stage, setting 
up shop in the corner of your local coffeehouse. Like bars and dinner  
theaters, you’ll typically be paid by the establishment itself. However, you 
may also work for tips.
Whether you’re working an upscale nightclub or Joe’s Cup o’ Joe (no 
relation to the Bar and Grille), the venue may also have a cover charge 
that patrons pay upon arrival. How this money gets split up between 
the owner and the entertainment varies greatly. Sometimes, it’s the only 
money you’ll see, a practice known as playing for the door. Other times, 
you’ll get a fixed amount for the night’s work as well as a percentage of 
the door. Unless you have a very dependable following, working for the 
door is pretty much a crapshoot.
 “Playing for the door” means you get a percentage of the cover charge the venue collects from 
patrons. If you have a solid base of fans, this can be lucrative. Otherwise, it’s a bad gamble.
Up to this point, we’ve been focusing on four walls and a ceiling. However, 
many venues are a bit more gypsy in nature. You might find work at 
an annual outdoor festival, whose performance area will run the gamut 
from a professionally built and well-lit stage to a couple of flatbed trail-
ers parked together. The money can come directly from the festival or 
through intermediaries such as promoters.

Have Fun, Get Paid
167
Conferences are similar in nature, albeit with a conspicuous lack of flatbed 
trailers. They’re more akin to theaters and concert halls in that the event 
will rent the location, and the producers of the event therefore contract 
with the entertainment.
Agents and Unions 
So far in this chapter, we’ve been considering scenarios where the money 
comes from the paying entity and goes directly to you. There is yet another 
middleman who often appears in these opportunities and has a part in the 
transaction. They go by different names depending on your art, but you’ll 
recognize them as talent agencies, booking agents, management companies, 
and other such intermediaries. These are great people to have in your corner  
because they exist to find you work. The reputable ones only make money 
when you do, typically as a percentage or agreed-upon flat fee per gig.
When you get a job through an agency, it’s common for the agent to 
negotiate the payment for the gig and also to collect it. After removing 
the appropriate fee for their services, they then pay you.
There are tradeoffs with this arrangement. It’s great to have someone 
hunt down the work for you, and personally I never have a problem with 
paying them for their efforts. They earn their money. However, because 
you’re not dealing directly with the venue, there can be an additional delay 
involved in getting paid. First, the venue has to mail the check to the agent, 
after which the agency gets the money to you. Depending on how each 
agency runs their business, this can be fast or slow.
Anytime you put someone between you and the money, there’s also a 
chance for you to get screwed. This happens so often in the creative 
world that no one is even surprised when they hear yet another tale of 
an artist being ripped off. To a certain degree, if you have an intermediary 
involved in the transaction, and there are a lot of good reasons to do just 
that, you’re at risk.
The best thing you can do is to perform due diligence before taking the 
gig or entering into an arrangement. Do the research and see if there 
are complaints of others being cheated or their money being delayed. 
If so, no matter how shiny the opportunities seem, walk away. It’s your 
only defense.
For those who think that a lawyer will get you out of such a jam, you’ll find 
that attorneys are the only people who ever really win in such disputes. 
The law is a very tricky thing, and even winning the case doesn’t guarantee 
payment. Your lawyer, however, gets paid either way. Do your homework  
up-front, and if the deal seems shady, avoid it. That’s your best protection.

Chapter 10 | Paying the Bills
168
Another way of covering your posterior is actually mandatory in some 
cases. Unions exist for actors, musicians, and many other creative arts.  
In cities where there are major creative industries like New York and 
Los Angeles, you’ll find many gigs that hire only union members. That doesn’t 
mean you can’t get work as a nonunion creative, but before you spend 
time and effort chasing the work, know what the requirements are.
Is being in a union worth it? That’s a question that simply doesn’t have an 
absolute answer. The benefits vary depending on how many gigs you will or 
won’t get in your area as well as the going rate for such work. In general, 
union rates are much higher than nonunion, but that’s not always the case. 
If your services are in demand and you know how to negotiate, or have 
hired someone who does, the money you can earn is limited only by what 
the market will bear.
Unions also offer benefits that creatives don’t always have access to, such 
as health and equipment insurance. In return for what they offer, you’ll be 
paying dues for your membership. The cost-benefit analysis once again 
varies greatly by industry and region. One of the things you’re supposed 
to get by being a union worker is protection. If a venue tries to screw you 
out of your money, they don’t have just you to contend with but your 
union as well. These can be powerful entities.
Even so, there are no guarantees. A friend of mine was a union musician all 
his life. One day he got screwed out of two weeks’ pay from a venue that 
just figured they could get away with it. He reported it to the union who 
did little more than stare at their shoes. Nothing was ever done about it, 
my friend wasn’t compensated by the union in any way, and the venue got 
away with it.
You’ll hear strong claims from people on both sides of the union issue. 
Take them both with a grain of salt, as you would when listening to any-
one who has an agenda to promote. Instead, take your time, do your 
homework, and then make the best decision for your particular situation. 
Sometimes, there’s just no substitute for doing a little research and using 
your brain.
Merchants and Merchandising
Another class of revenue can be lumped under the general heading of 
merchants. As with all the opportunities we’re considering, merchandising 
manifests in a number of ways and also varies with the art form.
We’ve been concentrating on the performing arts thus far, but there are 
of course many who create physical objects as their form of creative 
expression. Drawings and paintings can be put into a frame and hung on a 

Have Fun, Get Paid
169
wall. Sculptures can sit on a coffee table, assuming they’re smaller than an 
elephant. In fact, once you open the door to what we think of as arts and 
crafts, there are an endless number of things that can be created and sold. 
Who does the selling, and how they do it, is the primary consideration 
when it’s time to think about your bank account.
We don’t want to leave our performing friends behind, however. Selling 
merchandise before, during, or after a gig is a time-honored way of supple-
menting the performing artist’s income. It can occasionally pay better than 
the gig itself.
There’s yet another kind of product we can sell as well, providing we don’t 
require it to be physical in nature. Software developers and even graphic 
artists often produce creations that are virtual in nature. If this is your 
field, you might offer apps for cell phones or a set of fancy graphics for 
PC backgrounds.
Alternatively, if you’re of the camera-wielding variety, you could market 
your work to film production companies that need stock footage, either 
in the form of stills or video, since they often don’t have time to do the 
shooting themselves. Audio falls in this category as well. While the pur-
chase might take the physical form of a CD, it’s common these days to sell 
it as a download.
As you can see, from paintings, to T-shirts, and all the way into the virtual 
world of the bits and bytes, there are many ways to make money selling 
merchandise. As for the transaction itself, there can be a lot of players, but 
they tend to fall into a few basic categories.
The first form of merchant is exactly what you would think, someone 
who runs a store. They’ll typically buy your products wholesale, mark 
them up to turn a profit, and then sell them to the consumer. Sometimes 
this takes place in a physical building, where customers walk in and pay 
in person. However, the model works just as well on the Internet. Stock 
audio and video companies often do a lot of business on the Web. It’s also 
not uncommon for the artist to sell directly to the consumer through her 
own Web site.
Selling merchandise at gigs is typically done by the artist himself, or the 
people who work for the group, at least at the bar and small-venue level. 
Once you’re a rock star or can fill a theater for your performances, it’s 
often more profitable in terms of time and effort to outsource sales to a 
middleman who buys wholesale and handles sales at their own booths at 
your show. You make less this way, but it’s much easier money since you 
don’t have to handle the transactions or manage the people.

Chapter 10 | Paying the Bills
170
Another grassroots method of moving merchandise can be found at  
flea markets and other special-interest gatherings across the country. 
This follows a split model, with artists running their own booths next to 
retailers who buy and sell products rather than creating them personally.
If you’re a performing artist, what you sell should be more than just 
a rendition of your what you do live. Musicians can sell CDs of their 
music and dancers can sell DVDs of their performance, but those only 
scratch the surface. If you’ve built up an enthusiastic fan base, much of 
what you can sell is more along the lines of souvenirs, mementos that 
allow the audience to remember the event or just show their passion 
for your work. The forms these can take are almost limitless, from the 
time-honored T-shirt to coffee mugs, beer coolers, posters, and pretty 
much anything else you can slap your branding on.
 Sell more than just the music or art you create—think in terms of creating a souvenir for your 
fans. That opens up the possibilities to T-shirts, mugs, calendars, and any other related product 
that displays your brand.
There is a risk associated with selling your own merchandise. If you buy a 
thousand T-shirts to get the best price, you have thousands of dollars tied 
up in inventory. If they’re not selling quickly, that money can be unavailable 
to you for a long time.
One solution to this is to work with print-on-demand services that create 
and ship products one at a time as they’re ordered. You don’t make as 
much money per unit, but you have no risk since you’re not gambling on 
how much you can sell, as you must when you buy inventory. This model 
works well online.
If you’re not interested in e-commerce and shipping orders, opting instead 
to sell merchandise in person at shows or flea markets, you can take a 
similar approach. Rather than focusing on getting the lowest price, you 
buy only the quantities you’re confident you can sell. You’ll make less 
money per sale but once again have less risk.
Advertising
If producing film or video is any part of your work, monetization is no 
simple matter. The traditional path for films has been to get your work 
into a festival and hope you snag a distribution deal. However, more and 
more people are finding that even if they succeed in accomplishing this, 
and your odds of doing so are only slightly better than seeing a black 

Have Fun, Get Paid
171
limousine parked outside of your house, they don’t make enough off the 
distribution to offset the costs of creating the movie, let alone turn a 
profit. Sometimes this is due to treachery on the part of the distribu-
tors, but more often it’s just the result of an audience who is less and 
less inclined to pay for the media it consumes.
The next most common source of revenue for film and video is the 
advertising that appears alongside them when they are shown on the 
Internet. This is far less profitable than what a successful film makes in a 
theater run. On the Web there are really just two business models that 
have proven consistently profitable. One is the virtual mail-order catalog, 
best illustrated by companies like Amazon that sell and ship physical 
products. The other is selling advertising.
You Tube is a very recognizable example. You post your work, attach ads, 
and get paid based on the number of times the ad is viewed. You’re not 
working with millions of dollars in this world. Transactions are often spelled 
out in fractions of cents. In this scenario, YouTube is a middleman, since it 
sells the ads to businesses looking to get in front of more eyeballs.
Due to a combination of the huge volume of ads on the Web and the low 
return on investment that the advertiser receives compared to what they 
were used to back in the days of print media, the rates paid by advertisers 
are very low and the payoff to creatives lower still.
Alternatively, you could sell your own ads. Trust me, this is not something 
you want to do. I spent many years teaching professionals how to sell a 
variety of products and services, and I was good at it. In all that time, the 
single most difficult thing to sell was advertising. The reason for this is 
simple. If you’re a business and you buy a box of pencils, it’s very easy to 
see the value you received for the money spent. Not so with ads.
 Trying to sell your own ads on the Internet is a losing proposition. Even if you have years of 
sales training, you’ll bust your tail for hardly any revenue. Hire a professional. The percentage 
you pay them for their efforts is worth it.
The purpose of advertising is to generate more business. The problem is 
that it’s notoriously difficult to know which ads directly result in the sale. 
You might encounter ads for a soft drink on TV, in magazines, on the radio, 
and on billboards, as well as on the Web. One day, you walk into a store 
and buy a bottle. Which ad, and therefore what advertising expense, was 
responsible for this sale? The joke in the business world is that half of the 
ads they pay for don’t work. They just don’t know which half.

Chapter 10 | Paying the Bills
172
Selling a T-shirt is easy. Selling ads is not something you want to attempt. 
If you’re going to use advertising as a stream of revenue, use a third-party 
provider like YouTube and don’t count on huge profits.
There is another form of advertising available to all creatives that’s a bit of 
a long shot but pays off better than YouTube. Much like what you see on 
a day at the stock-car races, you can find a sponsor or two and integrate 
their branding into the presentation of your work. From an artistic point 
of view, this might be seen as diluting the purity of your creativity. On the 
other hand, it can improve the effectiveness of your bank account. There 
are no set rules for such sponsorship. If you’re good with negotiating, it’s 
only limited by what the market will bear.
Coming back to the world of film, TV, and video, a related form of spon-
sorship is known as product placement. In this scenario, you charge the 
client for prominently displaying its product and branding in your show. 
This doesn’t have to be cheesy. If a character in your movie is sipping a 
soft drink, it will look very natural if you insert a can of your client’s prod-
uct. It’s what the real world looks like. Placement can also be handled in a 
clumsy or heavy-handed manner that looks bad, but that’s an artistic issue 
more than a business consideration. Bear in mind that product placement 
is still a form of advertising and thus not an easy sale.
The last form of advertising revenue is not the kind you sell but the kind 
you create for others. It is perhaps the most profitable and least offensive 
to artistic sensibilities. You can produce the actual ads that your clients 
then display in other places. If you’re into film and video, you can create 
commercials for network TV and cable. Audio skills translate nicely to the 
production of radio ads. Graphic artists will be adept at creating what are 
known as display ads, those colorful boxes of propaganda that we see on 
Web sites, in magazines, and even on billboards. You can do this freelance, 
or, as we’ll cover momentarily, you can get a corporate gig with ad agencies 
and other such media-oriented businesses.
Teaching
Another way to make full-time or supplemental income is by teaching 
those who are interested in learning your particular art form. A college 
degree certainly has no influence on booking a nightclub job. However, 
depending on where you’re trying to get work, a degree in the arts can be 
quite valuable in terms of landing a teaching gig. If you’re looking for work 
teaching in a university or grade school, you’ll absolutely need a degree. 
Corporations who hire trainers will also respect a good sheepskin.

Have Fun, Get Paid
173
On the other hand, for many of the teaching opportunities you encoun-
ter, a degree will be irrelevant or, at best, of marginal influence. A good 
example of this is the person who gives music lessons. She could teach 
piano by visiting the homes of her students. Alternatively, she could enter 
into an arrangement with a music store and hold her classes there. In this 
case, whether or not the store gets a cut of the lesson fee is a matter of 
negotiation. Often, the store benefits by selling the sheet music that the 
teacher requires for the lesson, so it’s a mutually profitable relationship.
Depending on your experience and credentials, be they from a university 
or the body of work you’ve done over your career, you can also teach 
seminars or do speaking gigs.
Seminars offer two types of opportunities. National seminar companies 
often hire independent contractors to teach for them. This approach offers 
a simpler life in return for more structure and oversight. Alternatively, you 
can fly solo, creating and marketing your own seminars.
If you go the entrepreneurial route, you’ll be expected to create a struc-
tured course, including the appropriate handouts and other educational 
materials. Additionally, like a concert promoter, you’ll be selling your own 
tickets and speculating on the chances of making a profit. The expense of 
the venue, typically a meeting room at a hotel, is something you’ll have to 
pay no matter how many tickets you sell. The cost of refreshments is also 
on your nickel, as is the cost of any advertising you do to sell the tickets.
This can be a very profitable experience but it comes with significant risk. 
If you’re on the hook for thousands in expenses and sell only three tickets, 
you just lost a lot of money. On the other hand, if you price the seminars 
with a healthy margin and pack the house, you could make a lot of money 
on each event.
The other side of this coin is straight-up public speaking. You’ll find oppor-
tunities at conferences specific to your art and often at corporate meetings 
and other such gatherings where they’re looking for an after-dinner speaker. 
I personally prefer this to the world of creating and promoting seminars, as 
I enjoy speaking and have spent most of my life talking to people from the 
stage. After playing rowdy biker bars, there’s nothing even remotely scary 
about a conference or corporate gigs. I don’t even need chicken wire.
There’s another opportunity for the people who want to pass along what 
they’ve learned, but it’s only for those who are capable of running a busi-
ness. Instead of selling lessons as a solo endeavor, you can open a school. 
Dance schools are everywhere, and there are opportunities for most of 
the other arts as well. For most people, your best source of income is 
teaching children. You can make a good living running a school for the 
arts, but you’d better be 100 percent businessperson or it’s a disaster in 
the making. Do it properly or not at all.

Chapter 10 | Paying the Bills
174
 Opening a school is not for the faint of heart, but it can be a great way to make a living in the 
art you love. You’ll need solid business skills and the ability to sell, persuade, and influence, but 
these are things that you can learn if you’re willing to put in the effort.
Corporate Opportunities
We touched on this briefly when considering advertising. Depending on 
your art, there can be a wealth of opportunity in the corporate world. You can 
work as a software developer and make pretty decent money, with stability 
of income thrown in for good measure. Graphic artists and videographers 
can find a great deal of work with advertising agencies, as can writers.
These same skills are also in demand by many corporations. One of my 
friends, for example, worked at an investment company that had a large 
sales force. He was constantly shooting video and mixing audio for the 
educational and motivational materials they used to train the sales force.
If you like bringing your art to life in both a physical and functional manner, 
you might enjoy the world of architecture. We think first of artists who 
draft pictures of buildings, but I once knew a guy who made a steady living 
building models for such firms. It’s far more effective to pitch a client with 
a high quality three-dimensional representation of the new business park 
you’re proposing than by merely showing her a picture.
All mid- to large-sized companies also have a corporate communications 
department, which is a great place for writers and artists to find work. 
From marketing materials to internal company newsletters, a business 
needs to speak eloquently and present a visually appealing image. If you 
have the talent to contribute to this, they’ll pay you well for it.
We won’t spend a lot of time in the business world because frankly, 
to most creative people, this feels more like a day job than an artistic 
endeavor. Whether or not you enjoy this sort of work and the perks it 
brings is a highly individual affair. Nonetheless, if you want to get paid for 
your creativity, these companies pay well.
Business Considerations
We’ve covered quite the hodgepodge of opportunities, so while you 
should see a great many possibilities for income in your future, it’s quite 
a varied collection. Even so, there are some common considerations that 
cross most boundaries. It’s worth stepping back to get the big picture 
when considering your options, as it will make you much more effective 
no matter which you choose.

Much as you would when running any business—and it’s important to 
remember that you are in fact your own cottage industry—you need to 
ask yourself fundamental questions about the nature of your enterprise. 
Among the things you should consider are the basics for any business. 
What are the products and services that you’re offering, and what is the 
cost of making and fulfilling a sale? That expense can be merchandise cost 
as well as advertising, shipping, fixed overhead such as rent and utilities, 
and anything else that costs money in the process of delivering the goods 
to your customer.
You should also consider how wide a range of products you’ll have as 
well as how easy it is to create new offerings. Time to market, that period 
between when the idea is created and when it’s ready for sale, will also be 
a factor in your decisions. If you’re selling merchandise, you need to know 
your supply sources, their dependability, and what kind of up-front invest-
ment you’ll have to make in order to work with them.
Turning your gaze outward, you need to consider who your primary 
market is as well as to investigate the secondary or less obvious markets. 
In all cases, you need to know who the authorized buyer is as well as 
how much and how often he can afford to pay you. Who performs the 
transaction is another important piece of the puzzle. It can vary from 
your soundman selling CDs from behind the mixing board to hiring firms 
that manage sales for you. Before you can make that choice, you must 
first decide if you’re selling retail or wholesale.
As you might imagine, depending on what you’re selling, this can involve a 
lot of effort and no small amount of paperwork. Done properly, however, 
it can be a very profitable endeavor. There’s no feeling like making your 
living with your creativity.
 Embrace business skills. There’s no better feeling than having someone hand over cash for a 
ticket to your show, your CD or video, a commissioned work of art, or any other product of your 
creativity. It also comes in handy when it’s time to pay the rent.
Mix and Match
Just as there is no single approach that’s best for everyone, so too are you 
free to choose the buffet rather than ordering off the menu. It’s important 
to remember that everything looks good on paper. Because of this, it’s 
easy to get excited about a particular approach to making money, only to 
find that it’s not as successful as you’d hoped.

Chapter 10 | Paying the Bills
176
The safest and most profitable bet is to mix and match, using every 
approach that you’re comfortable with to create multiple streams of 
revenue. If you have five things going and one of them doesn’t pan out, 
you’re still making money with the other four.
You’re also free to change the rules as you go. Your art, and your life, will 
change as the years go by. The world won’t stand still, either. Pick the 
options that work for you today and put your best effort into making 
them a success. Additionally, make it a habit to review what you’re doing a 
few times a year. Based on market conditions, the direction in which your 
art is headed, and the success or failure of your various ventures, you can 
always make corrections in the course you’re taking.
It’s never been easy making a living as a creative creature. This is due 
in part to supply and demand. When there are a lot of people creating, 
you’re working in a very crowded room. However, many people have 
difficulty paying the bills not because it can’t be done but simply because 
they never took the business of their art seriously. When you do, you’ll 
see a world of opportunity. You’ll also find that once you weed out the 
people who aren’t willing to approach the business side of art, the room 
isn’t nearly as crowded as you were expecting it to be.

Taking Care  
of Business
No matter how you make your money, certain realities apply. There are 
taxes to be paid, books to be kept, and occasionally even lawyers to be 
retained. Depending on your type of income, you may need to create a 
business entity such as an subchapter S corporation or limited liability 
company (LLC). There will also be a bit of red tape to navigate, such as 
business licenses and other governmental adventures.
Addressing the day-to-day details of running a business can be tedious for 
anyone. It’s especially difficult for those of the artistic mindset, who would 
prefer to be daydreaming about their latest creations. However, make no 
mistake: the effort you put into keeping your affairs in order will pay for 
itself many times over when you find yourself living an uncomplicated, 
well-managed, and relatively stress-free life.
The mark of a true professional is someone who takes care of business 
and keeps his house in order. You probably already know that the business 
world views creative people as flaky, irresponsible, and undependable. 
When your affairs are orderly and well managed, you get more than the 
peace of mind that comes from having your life under control. You’re 
seen by the industry as a serious player, someone who’s both talented and 
worth doing business with.
When you’re making a living with your art, having a solid reputation will 
get you work. In a very real sense, it’s currency you can spend.

Protect Your Future
One of the most annoying habits that tomorrow has is its tendency to 
become today. No matter how hard you try to wish it away, the future will 
not simply vanish over the horizon, never to be seen again. Instead, it will 
knock impatiently on your door, wondering why you’re not ready.
Doing paperwork, paying taxes, and managing all those other tedious details 
that come with running a business is not even remotely enjoyable. Because of 
this, creatives have the practice of aversion down to a science. The philosophy 
is quite simple. If it’s not fun, ignore it. Maybe it will go away. Unfortunately, 
unpleasant details are a lot like food. Sure, you can push that half-empty box 
of pizza into the corner because you don’t feel like cleaning the living room. 
In fact, you can ignore it for weeks. That is, if you can stand the smell.
Left to its own devices, over time a half-eaten pizza at room temperature  
will transform into something very unpleasant. As it turns out, that’s exactly 
what happens with all those business matters you’ve been avoiding. It’s 
easy to come up with an excuse to avoid doing the things that you don’t 
enjoy. However, there are no actions without consequences, even when 
the action is doing nothing at all.
If you don’t balance your checking account, you’ll find out that you made 
an accounting error the hard way. That discovery usually shows up in the 
form of bounced checks or a declined purchase with your ATM card. 
By some perverse universal law, these things will always happen at the 
most inconvenient moment possible.
An even better example is everyone’s personal favorite, the Internal 
Revenue Service. All year long, you made money and you never put a 
penny into savings for your taxes. When tax time rolls around and you 
discover you owe the government $10,000, you have nothing to offer but 
excuses. Government officials aren’t particularly receptive to such things. 
They also don’t care that the dog ate your tax return. In fact, they’ll probably 
consider the dog an undeclared asset and tax you for it.
If you’ve never become entangled with the IRS, ask around. It’s likely that 
someone you know has. Regardless of the specifics, what you’ll generally 
hear are details of a most unpleasant situation. In a way, this could be a 
very productive conversation, as it will give you the ability to compare a 
couple of bad experiences.
On one side, you have all that tedious paperwork to do, those expenses 
to track, and the receipts to organize. There’s also the irritation of putting 
half the money you make each week into savings instead of being able to 
spend it. Thanks to your less fortunate friends, you now have the opposite 
extreme to compare it with. This can include garnishment of wages and a 
host of other less-than-appealing scenarios.

Do you really need a pocket calculator to do the math? You can deal with 
some mildly tedious things today and keep yourself straight, or you can 
pretend the situation doesn’t exist and have financial and perhaps even 
legal hassles for years to come. Which would you prefer?
If you want to be treated like a professional, it’s important to act like one. 
That means being responsible, getting paperwork filed on time, and doing 
anything else you need to do in order to keep your business in order.
 Set aside the time now to take care of business matters such as bookkeeping, taxes, and the like. 
Staying on the straight and narrow can keep you out of serious trouble, which sometimes takes 
years to untangle. That sort of thing will most certainly interfere with your ability to create good 
art. The stress it can cause is also none too good for your health, both mental and physical.
You’ll also get another bonus. Once you bite the bullet and train yourself 
to take care of legal and financial matters as quickly as possible, you’ll most 
likely realize that there used to be a small knot in your stomach, which 
is now gone. It was caused by a constant low-level stress. You knew that 
you were ignoring things that would come back to bite you, whether you 
consciously acknowledged it or not. Once you get in the habit of good 
housekeeping, that tension will disappear, making one less thing to worry 
about in the often uncertain life of a creative creature.
A dancer stretches every day, even when it’s uncomfortable. A guitarist 
endures muscle pain in the hands from hours of playing. Neither of them 
give it a second thought. It’s just something they have to deal with in order 
to do what they love. Taking care of business is no different.
Boring Business Stuff
Because you are in fact your own business, certain rules apply. One of the 
first things to consider is the type of business entity you require. As you 
may know, if you do business as an individual and anything goes wrong, all 
your personal assets are at risk. You could lose your car, your house, and 
anything else of value. They might even take the dog.
This is why people form companies that limit liability. You can think of a busi-
ness entity as a kind of virtual person or group that’s separate from you and 
your personal belongings. It’s a paper creation that can buy and sell things, 
deposit checks, and even own other companies. If something goes wrong and 
lawyers go after your company, they can take what the company owns if they 
win. They can’t, however, take what you personally own because they’re not 
suing you, the individual. They’re attacking a stack of paper.

Chapter 11 | Taking Care of Business 
180
Sure, if you had money in your company account and had even bought a 
few pieces of equipment with it, the loss would suck. However, it wouldn’t 
be nearly as bad as someone coming to the front door of your house and 
for all intents and purposes stripping you bare. Having a company puts a 
layer of protection between you and bad things.
There are a number of different types of companies, some common 
across the country and some that vary state by state. Generally speaking, 
the simplest form is a sole proprietorship, often referred to as a d/b/a, or 
doing business as. It’s a lot like you personally doing things but just using 
another name (e.g., “Joe Smith d/b/a Joe’s Bar and Grille.”) It lets you 
cash checks made out to that name but doesn’t really put much distance 
between you and the business. It affords you very little protection.
It’s safer to employ one of several forms of incorporation. A corporation 
is in fact the virtual entity I referred to earlier and does create something 
separate from you, the individual.
There are different types of corporations, reflecting increasing levels of 
complexities. The C corporation is a full-on corporation and is the type 
that the real estate company or manufacturing facility down the road might 
use. It has shareholders but is otherwise not related to an individual. 
A simpler form is the S corporation. Like a C corp, this type of corporation 
still has to file its own tax returns, but its bottom line profit or loss is then 
entered on a single line on the individual’s personal tax return. It gives 
you protection with less complexity. An even simpler form is the LLC, 
or limited liability corporation, which is also designed to protect your 
personal assets while minimizing the paperwork.
These are very crude summaries of the various entities that you might 
create to represent the business of you, the creative creature. I am not a 
lawyer, accountant, or MBA, so my purpose is merely to make you aware 
of the types of options you have at your disposal. Which one should you 
choose? That brings us to our next consideration.
If you play in a band, you probably didn’t think twice about spending a 
few thousand dollars on instruments and amplifiers. You can’t play a gig 
without the gear, so it’s just the cost of doing business. However, most 
musicians resist spending even a hundred dollars for a consultation with an 
accountant or lawyer, even though it’s an even more critical consideration 
than the brand of guitar you play.
 You pay hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars a year in supplies and equipment to ply your craft 
or art. Be smart and spend another couple hundred on a good accountant or lawyer to set up 
your company. You’ll sleep much easier as a result.

Should you set up your own company to make it easier to manage your 
business and protect your personal assets? Absolutely. Which form? Don’t 
ask me. Ask a professional. That’s what I do when I need advice on these 
matters. You need to build a solid, long-term relationship with an accoun-
tant, and this is a great place to start.
Some will charge a fee while others might even offer a free initial consul-
tation, and they’re who you want to discuss your incorporation options 
with. They’ll ask you about the type of work you do, your expenses, and 
other relevant questions and then make recommendations on the type of 
business that makes most sense for you.
An accountant will also do the paperwork of setting up your company for 
you. The cost will go up or down a few hundred bucks depending on the 
type and where you live. It’s not as much fun spending money on starting 
one as it is spending it on a new dance outfit, but it’s very much worth it 
in the long run. The pain of an unexciting expenditure fades quickly. The 
peace of mind it buys lives on, year after year.
Once you’ve formed your business, your accountant will also let you 
know what sort of records you should keep. You should have frank and 
honest conversations with her about what is and isn’t a legitimate busi-
ness expense, how much money you should put into savings for taxes, and 
other such practical, day-to-day matters.
Speaking of expenses, that’s another thing this boring paperwork will buy 
you. Depending on the specifics of your art, there will be things you pur-
chase that you can legitimately deduct from your taxes. This can include 
supplies, equipment, and other such things. If you have space in your house 
that’s dedicated to nothing but business use, you may also be able to 
write off a percentage of your rent and utility bills. These are just a cou-
ple of examples. Your accountant will let you know what is and is not 
acceptable.
I urge you to get recommendations from friends when choosing a lawyer 
and an accountant. These professionals will advise you and you should 
follow their instructions. Consequently, you need to make sure that 
they’re respected by others so that you can be sure the advice is solid.
I wouldn’t trade my accountant for a pot of gold. He knows what’s 
important to me and advises me accordingly. While I like saving money 
on taxes as much as the next guy, my highest priority is to keep things on 
the straight and narrow. Therefore, he never points me in the direction 
of questionable deductions or grey areas of the tax code. When in doubt, 
I pay the extra taxes. That’s the way I want it, and he makes sure that we 
color within the lines.

Chapter 11 | Taking Care of Business 
182
As an illustration of what you have to watch out for, let me tell you about 
my previous accountant. I hired him to set up a corporation for me. He 
showed up with a book that he wanted me to have. The title was some-
thing to the effect of sneaky secrets that the IRS didn’t want you to know. 
That told me everything I needed to know about how he would advise me 
and manage my affairs. I paid him for the consultation, thanked him for his 
time, and never called him again.
You don’t play games with the federal government. That’s just trouble 
waiting to happen. When you go shopping for professional services, you 
want someone who’s going to help you manage your business in an hon-
est and legitimate manner. Sometimes you’ll pay a little more in taxes, fees, 
and the like. Other times you’ll save money. When you do, you can sleep 
well at night, knowing that you’re playing it straight and aren’t generating 
unpleasant consequences by cheating the government. All in all, it makes 
for a much more stress-free existence. By the way, lack of stress is also 
good for your art.
Your Home Office
Now that your business is set up and you’re officially You, Inc., it’s time 
to create an environment that makes it easy for you to keep up with the 
details. The first thing you should do is schedule time on a regular basis 
to perform any administrative duties. I usually do this once a month unless 
something comes up that demands my immediate attention. However, 
that’s what works for me. You’ll need to consider the amount of details 
you have to keep up with, what your daily reality is like, and where your 
free time lies and come up with a schedule that works for you.
If you’re a photographer who goes out on shoots and bills clients for the 
work, you’ll probably want to plan for a shorter cycle than every month. 
Your clients aren’t going to pay your invoice until they receive it, so if you 
screw around for a month after the job before you finally send it, you’re 
delaying your payment unnecessarily.
In this case, it would be worthwhile to sit down once a week at the very 
least and send out the invoices for the work you did. Of course, there will 
also be incoming checks to deposit, receipts to file, and other such chores. 
Because you stay on top of them, they won’t stack up on you.
 Set aside time each day, week, or month—whatever makes sense given your business—to take 
care of paperwork, invoice customers, pay estimated taxes, make entries in your bookkeeping 
software, and so forth. If you attend to such things haphazardly, your business will suffer, 
sputter, and die.

If you’ve opened a dance school that holds classes five days a week, sells 
clothing, and other supplies and charges students monthly, you’ll probably 
want to sit down at the end of each day and catch up on paperwork so 
that it doesn’t swamp you. If you expand the school to the point where 
you have people working for you, give some of this paperwork to your 
employees.
As you can see, there’s a wide variety in the amount of administrative 
duties as well as scheduling that might be needed by your company. It’s 
not important what kind of schedule you keep, only that it’s regular and it 
works for you. If you haven’t already discovered this, plans and schedules 
that run counter to your nature or exceed your capacity for self-discipline 
quickly fall by the wayside, so be realistic in your self-assessment.
If you’re not running a storefront operation but are instead just a girl 
who sings in a local band, your schedule and office needs will be simple 
and straightforward. If you’re more than the singer and in fact run the 
band, along with a healthy merchandising operation, you can still run 
the business out of a home office, but your schedule will have greater 
requirements.
In my case, I have a fairly decent variety of creative activities, but I keep my 
operation simple. I have a bedroom in my house that I use as an office. It’s 
dedicated exclusively to this purpose and not just for the sake of taxes—
talk to your accountant about the home-office deduction—but for the 
ability to walk out of it at the end of the day, close the door behind me, 
and be done with it. Regardless of your creative pursuits, it’s important 
that you develop the ability to walk away and leave your business at the 
office while you go out and spend time with friends and family. It will keep 
you sane.
Since my office doesn’t have to serve multiple purposes, it’s filled with 
predictable furniture and equipment, such as a desk, filing cabinets, a copy 
machine, a printer, phone, computer, and all the other things you'd expect 
a business office to contain. In terms of software, I have the standard office 
tools like a word processor, spreadsheet, and e-mail. I also have accounting 
software that’s powerful enough to capture the information my accoun-
tant says I need to track but simple enough to use easily. I have no desire 
to become a CPA.
There are bulletin and whiteboards on the walls, various trays to keep 
track of paperwork, and a shredder for the inevitable credit card offers 
and other mail that comes in with my personal information preprinted 
on it. In other words, nothing fancy, just the things I need in order to take 
care of business.

Chapter 11 | Taking Care of Business 
184
When setting up your office, if at all possible, carve out a dedicated space 
for it, even if it’s just a desk in the corner of a room. It will help you keep 
everything in one location and also allow you to click in and out of busi-
ness mode. Need to take care of paperwork? Go to your office space 
and be a businessperson for an hour. All done? Walk away. You’re now a 
creative creature again.
 Having dedicated office space offers you psychological distance: it allows you to put on your 
business hat for an hour or two, then leave, shut the proverbial door, and become the carefree 
artist you want to be for the rest of the day.
Being able to mentally partition these things makes it easier for you to 
keep your office in its own little space, away from your creative self. It also 
allows you to enter that space to work efficiently without tripping over 
a lot of clutter, be it physical or mental, meaning you get in and out in the 
shortest amount of time possible. You keep your affairs in order with the 
minimum impact on the hours in your day.
Trust No One
There’s another aspect of running your business that might be unpleasant 
to consider, but it’s too important to leave unsaid. At the end of the day, 
the only person responsible for your money and legal obligations is you.  
If things don’t get handled properly because someone else didn’t take 
care of business, tough. It’s still you who takes the heat. This means you 
need to accept that responsibility and adopt an attitude of accountability 
as well as an unwillingness to pass the buck.
The single most common cause of arguments in a marriage is money. 
People have different spending habits or money-management philosophies. 
One person wants to buy something and the other has done something 
that prevents that from happening. Bang, instant argument. It doesn’t mat-
ter if the cause of the occurrence was unintentional, you had no responsi-
bility for it, or the it was the result of a comet crashing in your bedroom 
and breaking the piggy bank. You now have a conflict.
There are plenty of couples who never fight and have no quarrels over 
how the finances are managed, and that’s great. However, it doesn’t change 
the fact that money is a flashpoint. Now consider this: If money can cause 
problems between two people who are in love, how much of a mess do 
you think it can create in your creative business?

When money is involved, people get weird. The larger the amount, the 
greater the capacity for bad behavior. The stories are common in the arts. 
Your booking agent was supposed to be depositing all the checks but was 
instead skimming off the top and reporting bogus figures. The accountant 
was supposed to send in the check for your taxes but bought a new boat 
and sailed to the Bahamas instead. The IRS doesn’t go after him. They 
come after you, since you’re the one who owes the taxes. You’ve had 
a great year and made a ton of money. You come home from the road 
only to find your bank account empty and your manager long gone. The 
scenarios are endless.
The list doesn’t end with professional relationships. Fathers and mothers, 
sisters and brothers, all show up in the tabloid accounts of those who 
decided to take the money and run. While there’s no justification for such 
treachery, it’s not that difficult to understand.
Like electricity, money is simply a form of raw power. If you have a circuit 
board operating at low voltage, you may never detect a flaw that exists. 
Crank a large amount of juice through it, however, and suddenly that flaw 
is going to light up like a fireworks display.
The same thing happens with people. We all have our weaknesses and 
character flaws. Most of them are never a problem because we’re never 
put to the test in those areas. Crank a large amount of money through 
our lives, however, and what used to be a minor weakness may become 
huge and dangerous as a result. In other words, bad things happen with 
people who were once our friends.
 Sad but true: Place blind trust in no one but yourself when dealing with money. Partners, 
spouses, professional advisors, best friends—they can all siphon money from your accounts 
and sometimes feel no guilt or shame about doing it. Keep a close eye on your money and double 
check all financial advice offered. That doesn’t make you a bad person. It makes you a smart one.
If people get weird, you risk losing money. If you get weird about their 
behavior, you risk losing relationships. The way to avoid losing either is 
simple. Become self-sufficient wherever possible. That part’s easy. Also, 
trust no one. That’s pretty harsh, and deserves an explanation.
Life would be unbearable without friends and family to count on. We 
need people we can confide in and whom we can trust to take care of 
things when there’s more to do than we can personally handle. And yet, 
that very trust, the handing over of your responsibilities to someone else, 
is a powder keg waiting to go off. If it does, you lose money or friends, 
maybe both. The culprit in this case is not trust. It’s blind trust. There’s a 
big difference between the two.

I mentioned having an accountant that I value greatly. In fact, over the 
years I’ve come to consider him a friend, and I trust both his work and his 
advice. Nonetheless, I live by the motto of “Trust, but verify.” I look over 
his work carefully, and his recommendations get equal scrutiny. If anything 
were to smell even a little fishy, I would dig very deep in short order. If it 
turned out there was something bad going on, I’d drop him in a heartbeat. 
If it was illegal, I’d prosecute without hesitation.
At first glance, that probably sounds ruthless. However, there’s another 
side to the story. I trust no one. Not blind trust, anyway. In all the years 
I’ve known him, and it’s been over a decade, everything he’s done has 
consistently demonstrated to me that he’s got my back. I recommend him 
to others every chance I get, and as I mentioned earlier, I wouldn’t trade 
him for a pot of gold. If I didn’t sleep with one eye open, I wouldn’t be so 
confident in what he does for me. Eternal vigilance doesn’t just protect 
you from bad things. It also shows you who the good guys are.
I don’t believe in blind trust. I am, however, a big fan of trust that’s earned. 
If he fell and hit his head, waking up the next day as a radically changed 
person who was out to screw me, he’d get a little of my money. However, 
because I keep an eye on things, he wouldn’t get a lot. That’s not just a 
matter of watching the other guy. It’s also about knowing who’s ultimately 
responsible for my fortunes, and that’s me.
Bad things happen to creatives all the time, and the cause is more than just 
the power of money. It’s far too common for an artist to let someone else 
take care of all that boring business stuff because she really doesn’t want 
to deal with it. When you give away your responsibilities like that, you’re 
leaving yourself wide open and you have no one but yourself to blame for 
whatever happens next.
The alternative is to stay active and involved in your business affairs, even 
the ones you farm out to others. Keep your finger on the pulse of what’s 
happening, review paperwork and figures frequently, and make sure you 
understand what’s going on. If you don’t, ask questions. If you don’t feel 
comfortable with the answers, immediately transfer that power to some-
one else, even if you’re taking it away from someone who you consider 
a friend. Especially if it’s a friend. Better to have a week of awkwardness 
than to leave someone in a position that will ultimately result in you losing 
him forever.
It’s your business. It’s your responsibility. Take it seriously and your risk of 
things going south on you will diminish significantly. You’ll also enjoy the 
feeling of being well informed and in control of your own life.

As with our earlier considerations of marketing, my intent here is not to 
give you a complete mastery of business matters but rather to get you 
thinking about the various pieces of the puzzle. Once you know the areas 
that need attention, there are a wealth of resources you can find that will 
help you take it to the next level.
Of course, the Internet will be of use to you in many of these areas. 
However, when it comes to law, accounting, and similar areas of critical 
importance, remember that there’s a great deal of bad advice on the Web, 
no matter how loudly it’s offered. When you need legal advice, talk to a 
real lawyer. When you have questions about accounting and money man-
agement, hire an accountant. Sure, they cost money. However, there are 
times when it’s crucial to get advice you can count on.
In addition to professional services, there’s another set of resources that 
I highly recommend. Find people in your field who clearly have their act 
together and buy them lunch. Not only will you get referrals for the 
professional services you need; you’ll get a lot of practical, down-to-earth 
advice from people who have lived to tell the tale. You’ll benefit just as 
much from the horror stories they tell as from the organizational tips and 
tricks that they pass along.
Taking care of business is something that many people avoid because it 
sounds tedious and unpleasant. I’ll let you in on a little secret. In the 
beginning, sometimes it is. However, like anything else in life, we enjoy 
the things that we’re good at. As you continually learn and grow as a 
businessperson, you’re going to gain skill and insights. Eventually, these 
things will become second nature to you. When that happens, you’ll 
no longer dread running your business. Instead, it will be a source of 
immense satisfaction. There’s really no substitute for being the master 
of your ship.

Your Personal 
Style
We’ve covered a lot of topics that will help you build a solid and stable 
career as a creative person. It would be great if I could give you a simple 
numbered list, like those articles you see all the time on the Web, telling 
you exactly what to do in order to achieve stardom, or at least be able to 
pay the bills with ease. Unfortunately, such a list does not exist.
Each person is different, a complex combination of aspirations and fears, 
talents and turmoil, that simply cannot be stuffed into a single, one-size-
fits-all box. We could just as well be snowflakes, although that might be a 
bit inconvenient when standing beneath a bank of blistering stage lights.
The specifics that apply to you won’t work for the guy standing next to 
you. He has a unique personality and his own strengths and weaknesses, 
and he possesses a collection of skills and talents that vary either a little 
or a lot from your own. An approach that’s successful for you might be an 
absolute disaster for him.
What we’re left with, then, are proven concepts rather than explicit, 
step-by-step instructions. In other words, having considered the examples 
and done your best to grasp all the things we’ve covered, you still have 
one more task to complete. You have to become a translator, mapping 
the concepts and techniques into a specific plan of action that’s realistic 
for your life, your personality, and your career. What, you thought there 
wouldn’t be any homework?

Tell Them What They Want to Hear
There’s a common practice in writing that you’ll see in TV commercials, 
books, articles, and all points in between. It’s consistently effective even 
though it’s not terribly ethical, but those looking to get rich quick are 
rarely concerned with the latter. Among this crowd, the approach is 
simple—tell the people what they want to hear. It doesn’t matter if it’s 
true or not. If you follow this rule, you’ll always have an audience.
People filled with hopes and dreams aren’t necessarily rational in their 
outlook. Many are also lazy. It’s not difficult to see how this plays out.  
Every form of media on the planet will have a little corner where unrealistic 
but appealing scenarios are offered. Want to lose weight fast but not 
interested in changing your diet or exercise habits? No problem. Here’s 
how to lose thirty pounds in one week eating nothing but cheese pizza!
You may scoff and feel that you’re too smart to fall for something that 
stupid, but it keeps showing up because it works. It’s also rarely that bla-
tant. Read the blogs and Web sites of your art long enough and you’ll see 
plenty of variations. They’ll be more subtle, but you’ll click the link and 
read the article because you hope it’s really that easy. They win, because 
the page view was all they were after.
Truth is rarely a welcome guest. We love to hold onto our unrealistic 
dreams because on the off chance that they actually come true, we get 
something for nothing: Weight loss without lifestyle change. Fame and for-
tune without hard work. When you tell people that the real world doesn’t 
work this way, they’ll usually ignore you and go read another numbered-list 
article on how to get what they want without putting forth any effort.
When I first got the idea for this book, I had mixed emotions about it. The 
title conveys exactly what I wanted to say. However, down in the base-
ment, my inner demons gleefully poured another batch of martinis when 
I realized that I was also telling people exactly what they wanted to hear. 
Have Fun. Get Paid. Make a living with your creativity. Yep, that’s exactly 
the sort of thing that tends to be followed by a numbered list of empty 
promises.
Fortunately, I have a fire hose, and I’m not afraid to use it. There’s an extra 
ingredient in all that I’ve said and it’s powerful enough to knock those 
martini-swilling troublemakers right off their padded barstools. You can 
absolutely have fun and make a living doing the things that you love. I’ve 
been doing it all my life, and I’ve known countless others who have done 
the same. However, you have to work at it, and you have to work hard.
That one little addendum is what separates the success stories from the 
wannabes: hard work. It’s the differentiating factor that matters far more 
than raw talent or good looks. If I leave out the part about the effort 

Have Fun, Get Paid
191
required on your part, I’m just cheating you, offering no more than empty 
platitudes that tell you what you want to hear. I could do that, and maybe 
I’d have an even larger audience if I did, but it’s just not how I’m wired. 
I want to see my friends succeed. There are few things as rewarding to 
me as hearing from someone who learned a couple of things from me and 
achieved great results with them.
I can’t accomplish that by pandering to the something-for-nothing crowd. 
I know how to con them if I want to. It’s really not that hard to do. I also 
know that they’ll walk away empty-handed. This sort of reader will never 
succeed no matter how many get rich quick articles she consumes because 
she’s unwilling to employ the magic ingredient of hard work. The fact that 
you’ve made it this far is solid proof that you live outside this circle of 
wishful thinkers. That gives you a tremendous advantage not just in your 
field but in all aspects of your life.
 If you’ve made it this far in the book and are willing to put forth the effort, you’re among the rare 
few who really will get paid for doing what they love. You know by now that it takes hard work to 
succeed, and that there are no shortcuts. However, there’s always luck, which, as ever, favors 
the prepared. That’s you.
I’ve been honest and straightforward at every turn about the fact that 
elbow grease is required in order for you to achieve the results you’re 
looking for, whether it’s part time or full time work you desire. You’ve 
hung in there, so you’re obviously up for the adventure. What remains, 
then, is one last round of tweaking so that you have a plan of action that 
will stand the test of time.
It’s common knowledge that people make ambitious resolutions on 
New Year’s Eve only to discard their effort by March. It says a lot about 
them that they wanted to improve their lives in the first place, since so 
much of the human race prefers to sit on its collective hands and whine. 
Unfortunately, by the Ides of March, the resolve of January has vanished 
along with the potential for positive change. The problem wasn’t making 
a resolution. It was laying out a plan of action that wasn’t in harmony with 
their true nature.
You’ve just read pages and pages of things that you can do to improve 
your career. However, if you make bold resolutions that require you to 
change who you are in order to succeed, you’ll find yourself an honored 
guest at the annual Ides of March party, wondering what happened to your 
ambition and plans.

Chapter 12 | Your Personal Style
192
Fortunately, it doesn’t have to go this way. Don’t worry; there are plenty 
of other parties you can still attend, but they’ll be full of people who 
achieved their goals and moved that much closer to their dreams. All you 
have to do to keep yourself on track is to create a plan that’s realistic for 
your personal nature. It’s really that simple.
Level Management
Entire books have been written on self-discovery, and it might be worth 
the trip to your local bookstore to browse a few. However, since we don’t 
have that kind of time, let’s focus on the aspects of your personality that 
have an effect on your career efforts.
To get the greatest benefit, take the time to make another pass through 
this book, skimming rather than reading word for word. By now you 
already know the concepts and techniques that caught your attention in 
each chapter. As you flip back through the pages, make a list of the things 
that you felt would be helpful when you first read them.
Some of them will have resonated with you, leaving you with the feeling 
that they’re great ideas. You are excited about diving into them. That will 
be level one. There will be a second level of things, which are those that 
you very much want to do but know they are going to take self-discipline 
to accomplish. These are both groups of things that will come easily to you.
The third level will be things you feel that you should do. Even though 
you’re not excited about them, they make sense to you logically and so 
you feel obligated to pursue them. The fourth level will be things that 
don’t really apply to your specific art form. For example, if you’re working 
as a software developer, the paragraph about booking a gig at Joe’s Bar and 
Grille probably didn’t have a direct application to you, so you passed it by.
Of the four, it’s the level-three issues that most often trip us up. Feeling 
like we should do something has very little motivational value. It’s an intel-
lectual consideration that may well be valid, but the intellect doesn’t drive 
us to act. Emotions and passion do. Even so, we often clutter our to-do 
lists with these well-intentioned tasks even though they do little more 
than take up space on the page.
For example, anyone who can read knows that smoking cigarettes is bad for 
you. That knowledge has very little impact on a smoker’s behavior. I smoked 
for many years, even though I was perfectly capable of reading the little label 
that said it wasn’t something my body was terribly fond of. Many of us who 
smoked knew that we should make a change, but we didn’t. That’s because 
the desire to quit smoking was a level-three goal, something we felt like we 
were obligated to do. That kind of motivation never works.

Have Fun, Get Paid
193
No one ever quits smoking because they think they should. They try but 
start back up a week or a month later. Don’t ask me how I know. People 
only succeed in quitting when they want to. That seems like a subtle dis-
tinction, but it moves the action from level three to level one, and that 
makes all the difference in the world.
In my twenties, I suffered a minor collapsed lung. Not once. Three times. 
Bizarre though it may seem, I kept smoking. I never said I was the bright-
est bulb in the box. However, it was not only an unpleasant experience; 
it was interfering with my ability to sing. The third time it happened, 
I got fed up and said screw it. I pulled half a carton of smokes off the top 
of the refrigerator, gave them to a friend, and I was done with it.
There were no nicotine withdrawal devices available then or any other 
such nonsense that people want to sell you products for. However, despite 
the fact that I’d been smoking three packs a day, it wasn’t at all difficult to 
do. I knew I was used to having a cigarette in my mouth and playing with it 
between my fingers, so I did something about it. I bought boxes of wooden 
matchsticks and toothpicks and kept them in my pocket for a couple of 
weeks. I chewed on them and twirled them between my fingers instead of 
reaching for a smoke.
I never succeeded in quitting when I thought it was something that  
I should do. I quit in a heartbeat when it was something I wanted to 
do. If you attempt to accomplish your list only out of a sense of obliga-
tion, it’s very likely that you won’t accomplish the goals in level three 
because you'll have no fire in the belly (unless you swallow the cigarette, 
of course). Sure, you can force yourself to try for a few weeks, but even-
tually your true nature will prevail and you’ll quit.
 When you change the “should dos” to “want to dos,” your professional life as an artist will 
change dramatically. You’ll start attending to the parts of the your career that lead to new and 
better opportunities.
That doesn’t mean there’s nothing you can do with your level-three goals. 
It merely indicates that you have to know your nature and approach them 
accordingly. When I wanted to quit smoking, it moved from level three 
to level one, but that alone wasn’t enough. I knew my nature. By buying  
matchsticks and toothpicks, I took the appropriate steps to preempt 
trouble before it happened. This is what you’ll need to do if you’re to 
move a goal up a couple of levels.

Chapter 12 | Your Personal Style
194
I’ll offer an embarrassing little story of my own as an example of how this 
can work. I made a joke in an earlier chapter about having had a hard time 
keeping the living room vacuumed before robots came along. It wasn’t a 
joke. Living in Atlanta, allergies are a reality for a lot of people, and I’m not 
immune to such little inconveniences. One of the basic things you should 
do, of course, is dust and vacuum on a regular basis so that there’s less 
stuff floating around in the air to annoy you.
I’m a single guy living alone, and while I keep the place clean in general, 
housekeeping isn’t something I’m highly motivated to do. This means the 
floors don’t get vacuumed with clockwork precision. From a level-three 
point of view, it’s something I know I’m supposed to do consistently.  
As someone who spends a fair amount of time in self-examination, I also 
know that since it’s a tedious and time-consuming task, I’m always going to 
find an excuse to procrastinate in favor of doing more interesting things.
The way I moved vacuuming from level three to level one was to buy a 
Roomba, one of those little round robots that vacuum a room automati-
cally without any need for supervision. This solution was in harmony with 
my nature in a couple of ways. To start with, I’m not just a creative crea-
ture; I’m also a geek. Robots are fun. Additionally, they require very little 
time and effort, so they destroy the procrastination barrier. The floors 
now get vacuumed with stunning regularity. I’m still looking for a droid 
that can handle the dusting.
This particular example involved spending money, but that isn’t the point 
and will rarely be the case. What it illustrates is that I understood my 
weaknesses and looked at the problem from different angles until I found 
a solution that I wouldn’t abandon. Sure, I could have just said this is some-
thing I need to do and expected self-discipline to get me to the finish line. 
Were that the case, you’d see me having drinks at the Ides of March party.
I’ve advocated self-discipline at several points along the way, and yet at this 
point I’m quickly throwing it out the window. That will seem like a bit of 
a mixed message and thus deserves clarification.
I’m not wild about paying my bills. I have the money in the bank, so there’s 
no financial stress involved. It’s just a tedious and time-consuming chore 
that I don’t particularly enjoy. You know, like running a vacuum cleaner.
Nonetheless, every month I sit down, fire up the checking software, go 
through all the bills, make the payments, and clean up all the empty enve-
lopes when I’m done. It’s a task I don’t want to do, but I’m able to employ 
self-discipline to accomplish the goal anyway. Why is this different?
The secret lies in consequences, which can be a powerful motivation.  
If I don’t vacuum the floor for a few weeks, it’s not a crisis, so I can get 
away with procrastination. If I don’t pay my electricity bill, they turn off my 

Have Fun, Get Paid
195
power. That’s not a consequence I’m willing to live with, so I show a little 
backbone and get the bills paid. Understand your nature, be honest with 
yourself about what you want to do versus those level-three obligations, 
and review the consequences. Combined, these things will help you either 
move something to level one or realize that it’s okay to leave it where it 
is and spend your time on other tasks.
We don’t want the fourth level to feel completely left out, so let’s give it a 
quick look. While the items on this list aren’t high priority for you today, 
some of them may have value to you in a future effort. When you have 
the important stuff under control and your career is rocking along, you 
might make another sweep through the chapters to find ways to take your 
career up a notch.
If you’re a software developer, you’re probably not going to get a gig at 
Joe’s Bar and Grille where you sit on stage with your laptop and ignore the 
crowd while you write a program. On the other hand, Joe is always looking 
for ways to take his business to the next level too, and most of his crowd 
shows up with a cell phone in their pockets. Is there an app you could write 
for Joe that would make the experience better for his customers and in 
turn make him more money? That’s how you get some mileage out of a 
level-four goal. Look at it sideways and see what reflects off the paint job.
As you go back through the book skimming the chapters for things to do, 
you’ll learn a lot about yourself by examining your gut reaction to each 
task. By being honest with yourself and placing each activity at the right 
level, you’ll be able to build a plan of action that is realistic for your per-
sonality. That means you can skip the Ides of March party. You’ll be too 
busy accomplishing your goals to attend it.
Track It
In the world of million-dollar Madison Avenue marketing campaigns, they 
don’t just kick out a couple of ads and hope they do the client some good. 
There’s an entire industry built on tracking and measuring the response 
to an advertising campaign. Ad agencies create campaigns based in part 
on the data they’ve gathered and analyzed from previous attempts. They 
track what works and what doesn’t, and apply what they learn to create 
ever more effective ads for their customers.
As an example, if you live anywhere near the software business, you’ll hear 
people kicking around phrases like “A/B testing.” This type of test might be 
something as simple as deploying two Web pages that have identical content 
but different design elements, such as varying color combinations, the use of 
buttons rather than links, and so on. The analysts will then track which page 
performs best in terms of the action they want the visitor to take.

Chapter 12 | Your Personal Style
196
While you probably have little desire to become a professional data ana-
lyst, there’s a lesson to be learned here. If you embark on a new initiative 
to improve your career, how are you going to know which aspects of your 
plan worked and which underperformed?
Without that knowledge, you can easily waste a lot of time on something 
that’s not going to give you an adequate return on your investment. You’ll 
have some vague notions of things improving or staying the same, but you 
won’t know why. Without information, it will be difficult for you to make 
corrections in our course to improve the situation. However, if you’re well 
informed, you’ll be able to isolate a part of your plan that isn’t delivering 
the way you’d like and tweak it until it either works or can be written off 
as not worth the trouble.
 Test and analyze your efforts. When you find something that works (advertising, business 
development, a promotional event, etc.), stomp your foot on the gas pedal. You’ve just 
discovered something important. Likewise, lay off efforts—as soon as possible—that result in 
meager gains. The point is to look for the things that will move your career as an artist to the 
next level, and to document the steps you took to achieve that particular success so that you 
can reproduce it in the future.
We’ve been talking about staying true to your nature, and there is 
another area where it is important to keep this in mind. If you buy a 
bunch of software to track and analyze data along with making ambi-
tious plans to log each and every event that happens in mind-numbing 
detail, your efforts will only succeed if you’re really into that sort of 
thing. If balancing your checkbook is tedious beyond belief, there’s no 
way you’re going to use all that fancy software. It’ll just sit and gather 
dust. If it helps, I know where you can get a really cool robot, but you’ll 
have to put the CDs on the floor.
Fortunately, there’s more than one way to keep track of your career. At a 
high level, all you’re really looking to accomplish is maintaining a record 
of how your efforts go so that you can refer to them later. With that in 
mind, you have a lot of options.
I use a surprisingly low-tech method to keep up with the events of my life 
and career. I keep a journal, which sounds far more formal than it really is. 
Tucked away in the corner of my reading room is a stack of cheap spiral 
notebooks, the kind you can buy for a couple of bucks in the school-
supplies section of your local grocery store. I invested another few dollars 
in a clipboard.

Have Fun, Get Paid
197
That’s it. That’s my journal. All I need is a pen. I don’t have to worry about 
rebooting it, or a hard drive becoming corrupted. It works in bright sun-
light or a candlelit room. Just as important for my own preferences, I don’t 
have to worry about it becoming obsolete. I have notebooks going back 
to the early 1980s. They still work.
For the most part, I merge all my creative endeavors and life’s little lessons 
together in these books. I often sit down with a pen and legal pad to scrib-
ble out notes for some project I’m working on, but if it’s something I want 
to remember thirty years from now, I make note of it in the journal.
Anyone who knows me will attest to the fact that I’m not averse to tech-
nology. I’ve paid the bills writing software; I have state-of-the-art audio and 
video production facilities; and there are computers, pads, and cell phones 
littering my house. I even have maintenance droids to vacuum and mop 
my floors. Even so, there are times when it’s just more comfortable for 
me to sit down with a legal pad on a clipboard and scribble things with 
a pen. There’s also the longevity factor that paper offers. So, this is what 
works for me.
You may find pen and paper clumsy and prefer a completely different 
scenario. There are a lot of good ones to choose from. Some prefer 
to use a camera, whether in their laptop, pad, or cell phone, and record 
events vlogger style (that’s slang for video logging for those not up on 
such things). It’s simple and easy to do. Press Record, talk, and press Stop 
when you’re done. If you like, you can employ a similar approach using a 
microphone, doing an audio-only version.
You can also use your computer and write documents with your favorite 
word processor or text editor. Maybe you print them for posterity, maybe 
you don’t. Your notes can be a series of paragraphs or a highly structured 
outline. All that matters is that it be a method of communication that 
feels natural to you and is easy to comprehend when you come back later 
to ponder your musings.
You’ll find a lot of Web-based services as well. Today, it’s trendy to refer 
to this as “Putting things in the cloud.” Five years from now, there will 
be a different buzzword. The only caution I would offer regarding this 
approach is that the service you’re using is probably free or very cheap. 
There’s no guarantee the company will be around five years from now and 
if they die, they’ll take your notes with them.
If the cloud works for you, it’s what you should use. Just make sure you 
have backups so you don’t lose anything. We keep notes because we don’t 
have a clear recollection of what we did on the 2nd of August ten years 
ago. You won’t be able to reconstruct your notes from memory if you 
lose them.

Chapter 12 | Your Personal Style
198
This is not an exhaustive list of your options, but it should give you a good 
idea of what’s available. The next question is simple: what should you 
record in your notes?
Track What?
There are several benefits that you can derive from this practice, so that’s 
what should drive your actions. The first one we’ve already touched on. 
If you’re taking steps to improve your career, you’ll want to make note of 
what you did, when you did it, and how.
There’s nothing more frustrating than doing something, seeing positive 
results, and then coming back in the future to do it again but not remem-
bering all the steps you took. In today’s increasingly technological society, 
things can be complex. There’s no shame in having a cheat sheet to walk 
your future self through the steps.
Timing is often important as well. If you did a promotion to help sell your 
band’s CDs and it was a huge success, you’ll want to repeat that plan 
when you record something new. However, to your dismay, you find that 
this time around, it doesn’t bring you the same results. How could this be? 
Does your music suddenly suck?
While audiences are notoriously fickle and the creative output of a band 
is far from constant, in this case you did your first promotion in October, 
just in time for the holiday shopping season. The second promotion was 
done in April, right before tax time. Far from being in a shopping mood, 
your fans were more concerned about paying the IRS. You lose.
With this information, you might try again when the holidays roll around 
and enjoy the same success as your previous release. The timing might 
have escaped your attention and you might have simply given up on your 
latest CD. Instead, it becomes yet another big seller.
In addition to tracking efforts to help with making necessary changes, 
there’s another benefit to keeping notes. As you put more and more 
effort into building your business, you’ll be doing things that are hard 
work and occasionally outside of your comfort zone. When it comes 
time to doing yet another difficult thing, motivation is important.
 Keeping careful notes on what you did and how things turned out is important for another 
reason: The practice is hard at first, but the results show you that yes, indeed, it is possible to 
leave your comfort zone. They also remind you that good things happen when you do. That’s 
motivation that will carry your career forward.

Have Fun, Get Paid
199
As you sit there staring at that item on your to-do list and trying to gear 
up for the effort, sometimes it helps to look back at your previous efforts, 
particularly the ones that were difficult. If you’re keeping track of things 
in an organized manner—in other words in the organizational style that 
works for you—you’ll be able to review that time period when you were 
doing the hard work and then check your notes further down the road 
to see the kinds of results you got. When I’m making entries about things 
going well, I make it a point to mention the effort that was responsible so 
that I can easily relate cause and effect.
Armed with this information, you can see that you did some hard work. 
However, with the results logged in addition to the effort, it reminds you 
that it was all very much worth it. Nothing fires us up like getting results. 
That makes it easier to get up off the couch and do that next batch of 
hard work.
When Apollo 13 had a blowout in the middle of nowhere, NASA got the 
crippled spaceship home again with all the astronauts alive. They referred 
to the mission as a successful failure. Yes, the mission had to be aborted 
and thus was a failure. On the other hand, they succeeded in coping with 
the crisis and saving the crew. It could very easily have gone the other way. 
From that perspective, the failure was a success.
Sometimes you’ll put heart, body, and soul into a plan and it simply won’t 
pan out. In the simplest terms, the effort was a failure. When this happens, 
and it will, you’ll want to analyze what went wrong. The insights you gain 
on why your plan didn’t work may very well show you how to do it right 
the next time, as in our previous example of timing and holiday shopping. 
In short, you want all your failures to be successful failures. Keeping track 
of things allows you to do exactly that.
Your notes don’t have to be all about you, by the way. There are a lot of 
people out there engaged in the same form of creativity as you. Some are 
rock stars, but a lot are working at your level. They are your peers, and 
they’re just as interested in moving their careers forward as you are with 
your own. If you pay attention to how they do things, you can learn a lot.
Sometimes they’ll give a performance that’s absolutely brilliant and their 
audience will respond in kind. They might have similar success with an 
approach to booking gigs or selling merchandise. Whatever it is, you can 
learn from it. Obviously there are boundaries regarding emulation, par-
ticularly in the expression of the art itself. That said, you can always learn 
from others, and it’s a pretty good bet that your expression will be your 
own so there’s little risk of being a copycat.
Your peers will also show you where the potholes are so that you don’t 
have to break an ankle finding out about them the hard way. If a local band 
ends the show by firing a bunch of confetti cannons into the audience at 

Chapter 12 | Your Personal Style
200
the end of the show, the crowd may love it. It might therefore surprise you 
that management will not book them back into that venue anymore.
When the show’s over and the crowd goes home, the people who work 
in the bar have to clean up the mess. If they get tired of all the extra work 
the band is causing, they may complain enough to get the band bounced off 
of the booking list. As you hear the tale from a waitress friend who works 
there, you make a mental note. Confetti cannons, bad. Very bad. Check.
Ebb and Flow
There is nothing normal about being a creative creature, including the 
flow of our lives. Just like regular people, we have ups and downs in our 
relationships, our health, and every other aspect of life. Careers will be a 
roller coaster as well. Sometimes the best thing you can do is just wave 
your hands in the air and go with it.
It’s common when embracing a particular area of self-improvement to 
have a period of inspiration and go great guns for a while, giving it every-
thing you’ve got. This is inevitably followed by the effort coming to a 
complete halt, possibly forever. Naturally, in a life that may well last a 
hundred years, this doesn’t get you very far in pursuit of your dreams.
True success comes from long-term, steady effort, not short bursts of 
effort followed by prolonged periods of inactivity. It’s actually easier to put 
out a high-intensity effort for a brief period than it is to sustain a lower-
level effort for a long time. That’s because the bright flash of activity is 
typically triggered by something that excites us, and the energy we feel 
from it is what powers our Herculean push. Of course, it doesn’t last, but 
it’s fun while it does. Putting one foot after another, day after day, often 
doesn’t feel like high-voltage electricity coursing through our veins. It feels 
like work.
Regardless of the sensation, the math is easy enough to do. If you spend 
nights and weekends putting in 40 hours of effort every week, you might 
be able to stick with it for a couple of months before you burn out. Then 
you never attempt it again. Eight weeks of this gives you a grand total of 
320 hours of effort.
Now let’s look at a different level of effort, where you spend only  
10 hours a week. Because it’s not so overwhelming, you have no trouble 
keeping it up. At the end of one year, you’ll have put in 520 hours. 
In five years, you’ve racked up 2,600 hours. You’re going to wake up 
five years from now one way or the other. Would you rather have a 
couple thousand hours of effort behind you or a few hundred? That’s 
the power of a sustained initiative.

Have Fun, Get Paid

Even if you go the slow-and-steady route, there will be times when you 
get knocked off track. Count on it. Other things will happen in your life to 
distract you. When you return to your art, you’ll realize that you haven’t 
done anything for weeks. It’s not uncommon for people to never get back 
on track at this point, letting their efforts fall by the wayside.
Anyone who’s spent a little time trying to meditate will be familiar with 
this cycle, which happens in a much shorter time frame when you sit to 
clear your mind. You’re trying to think of nothing, and that ain’t easy to 
begin with. You managed to clear your head for the briefest of moments 
and the next thing you know, you’re thinking about the fact that you need 
to do the laundry.
 In the classic tale of the tortoise and the hare, the turtle won the race by consistently putting 
one foot in front of the other. The rabbit used up all his energy early on and had to take a nap. 
Unless you’re running the hundred-meter dash, slow and steady wins the race.
Frustrated that you can’t stay focused, you now have two problems. 
Not only is your mind not clear; now you’re thinking about the fact 
that you’re frustrated, at which point you become impatient with your-
self for your frustration, which feeds back on itself in an endless loop. 
Naturally, your mind isn’t getting any clearer.
I heard a story about a guy who used to meditate in his backyard. 
Every now and then, a jet would pass noisily above him. At first, this 
was a distraction. Eventually, however, he just started meditating on 
the airplane. When the airplane was out of earshot, he’d transition 
back to where he was before.
A little too cosmic for you? The moral of our little diversion into the land 
of lotus blossoms isn’t difficult to grasp. Life will knock you off track. When 
it does, instead of indulging in self-recrimination for your inconsistencies,  
just let it go. Getting angry with yourself doesn’t move you forward. 
Dive right back in, and before you know it you’ll be happily immersed in  
productivity again.
And what of those times when you’re on track but life tugs insistently at 
your sleeve? Meditate on the airplane. If life needs your attention, it’s not 
going to give up. Instead of fighting it, just roll with it. Deal with life, do 
what you gotta do, and after the airplane passes return to what you were 
doing. It’s actually not hard at all.
One thing that will help you return to your regularly scheduled efforts 
when you get bounced off track a bit is to have a few baby steps that you 
can take. If you’re trying to put together a promotion plan, part of the 

Chapter 12 | Your Personal Style
202
work might be something simple and mindless like searching the Web to 
build a list of bloggers you want to contact. That’s something that you can 
always use, and it’s easier than the other things on your list.
If you wake up and it’s been a few weeks since you were following your 
plan, don’t try to dive back in with all four paws if that seems over-
whelming. Instead, let yourself do some light work for a few days, like 
building your list. Doing so will get your head back into the game, and 
before you know it, you’ll return to full power.
You’re in this for the long haul, so you’re going to experience high tides 
as well as low over the course of your life. Instead of fighting the current, 
learn how to go with the flow. You’ll get wet either way, but at least your 
arms won’t be as tired.
You Can Do It
Creatives are empowered today as never before. We don’t have to spend 
hundreds of thousands of dollars to gain access to professional audio 
or video resources. We can take our art directly to the people via the 
Internet. The management tools on the average home computer offer the 
kind of power once reserved for major international corporations. It’s a 
great time to be alive.
It’s never been easy to succeed in the arts, but today most of the road-
blocks are gone. While you do have to possess talent, that used to be just 
a small part of the equation. In the past, there were many other qualifica-
tions that were beyond the reach of the average artist, who had to make 
it past gatekeepers or come up with a huge budget in order to create. 
Today, all that’s required to make a decent living is consistent effort and a 
bit of commonsense.
Even though the possibilities are now opening up to us more with each 
passing day, most of the creative people you know won’t succeed. Some 
may be more talented than you, and their audience may love them. 
However, without that secret ingredient of hard work, it just doesn’t mat-
ter. There is no quick and easy path to fame and fortune, and there is 
certainly no reward without effort. Nonetheless, if you’re willing to roll 
up your sleeves and put your back into it, you’ll be amazed at what you 
can accomplish.
As you’re advancing your career, don’t forget how important it is to 
build sincere and lasting relationships. It’s the glue that will hold your life 
together, and you have a long life ahead of you. Don’t wait for friendship 
to show up on a silver platter. No matter how little you think you know, 
you’re a few steps ahead of someone else. Seek those people out and be 

Have Fun, Get Paid
203
a mentor. If you can’t be a mentor, be a helper in some area of their own 
plan where their skills are weak.
While there’s value in building a good reputation, there’s another reason 
that’s just as valid. Helping others feels good. As it turns out, we do some 
of our best work when we’re happy.
In fact, that’s why I write books. Unless you have a Harry Potter on your 
hands, this sort of thing doesn’t really make you fabulously wealthy. I do it 
because for me, helping people is fun. It’s one of the reasons I exist. Well, 
that and the tequila.
If you had a good time and picked up a few ideas that will help your career, 
I’d be grateful if you’d tell your friends about this book, along with posting 
a review to tell others what it can do for them. Like any creative creature, 
I want to reach as many people as possible with what I do. To me, the only 
recommendations that really matter are the ones that come from people 
like you who have read my work.
I’d also love to hear your success stories. Getting to know people and 
hearing about the brilliant things they do with their careers is the high 
point of my day. You can always find me at www.ChristopherDuncan.com.
You wouldn’t start out as a weight lifter by trying to bench press a dump 
truck. Chances are good you’d strain a muscle. You might even ding the 
paint job on the truck when you dropped it.
In a similar fashion, some of the things we’ve talked about will take some 
practice. Don’t try to get there overnight. Start out slow, find the things 
that are in harmony with who you are, and work your way into a consistent 
routine. You’ll get better with each passing month, and your career will most 
certainly improve the longer you do it. If you keep it up, not only will you 
have fun, you’ll get paid.
Thanks for spending some time with me. See you out there!

own right. I learned these things the hard way.  
I hope this makes your path smoother.

About the Author
Christopher Duncan is a creative creature whose work includes 
writing, speaking, consulting, music, video, and the occasional encounter 
with technology. 
In previous lifetimes, he made a living playing guitar in smoky bars of dubious 
integrity and also paid the bills as a software developer. A reformed serial 
entrepreneur, he went on to run a sales and marketing company and bears 
the battle scars of several dot-com adventures.

Acknowledgments
Everyone cringes at the awards ceremony when someone walks up to 
the podium holding a scroll that would have been the envy of ancient 
Egyptian scribes. Surely there are few things as tedious as listening to an 
endless stream of names, no matter how heartfelt the gesture. Even so, 
rarely does a creative project see the light of day without the help and 
support of others. To leave the stage without at least tipping your hat 
would be impolite at best.
In this day and age, when it’s easy to self-publish and the Internet allows 
you to speak directly to your audience, there’s an ongoing debate about 
the value of publishers. By the time you’ve turned the last page, you’ll 
understand the importance that I place on people and relationships. 
Nowhere is there a better example of this value than in the process of 
writing a book. It’s easy to sit at the computer and write. I’m perfectly 
comfortable with that. Delivering a quality product is another thing 
entirely. For that, I need a little help from my friends.
My editor, confidant, and at this point a good friend is Jeff Olson. His were 
the first set of eyes that saw a new chapter. His perspective and notes 
helped me see things I’d missed and allowed me to look at the familiar 
in new ways. The fact that he’s as much of a wise guy as I am made the 
entire process a lot of fun. That’s important when you’re creating.
Jana Weinstein had an even harder job. As my copy editor, she had the 
unenviable job of keeping me from looking stupid in public. Don’t get me 
wrong, I was awake for at least half of my high school grammar classes, 
but without her help you would doubtless suffer from my dubious grasp 
of the English language.
Behind the scenes, someone has to keep the train on the tracks or it 
doesn’t matter how many talented people I have on my team. Fortunately, 
my coordinating editor Rita Fernando managed to keep this project 
running quietly and smoothly even though I happen to know she has a 
workload that would send most of us scampering for cover.
Without everyone’s effort, I would have been hard-pressed to deliver 
something worth reading.  The fact that they work for the business division 
of Apress and have to play border collie to an author who’s about as far 
from formal as you can get makes my appreciation all the greater. 

Acknowledgments
xii
While I’m grateful for the patience of all my friends, who seem to think 
it’s quite normal for me to disappear for months at a time on yet another 
creative venture, some have been at it far longer than most.
Rarely do I delve into an artistic endeavor without countless hours 
of cappuccino and conversation with my old friend Deirdre Smathers. 
Deirdre has endured endless stories of my various escapades and 
occasionally even succeeded in talking sense into me. More often than 
not, though, she does what good friends always do, keeping my spirits up 
and my sanity within bounds throughout all the twists and turns of the 
creative life. 
While I mentioned my niece Katy in the dedication, her mom has the 
longest history of all when it comes to my somewhat surreal existence. 
That’s because she’s my sister, Dana Stites. Before I learned how to 
have fun and get paid, I was the perpetually broke musician while she, 
my younger sibling, was the designated adult. As is often the case, my 
artistic lifestyle hasn’t always been looked upon favorably by family and 
acquaintances. However, from my earliest days of playing guitar to the 
gypsy life I’ve lead, no one has ever given me the complete, unconditional, 
and unfailing support that I get from Dana. Thanks, sis. Next time I’m in 
town, the tequila’s on me.
Perhaps this is a scroll not even worthy of a midsized pyramid, but when 
the last word is typed, these are the folks who immediately come to 
mind. No matter what kind of creative creature you may be, you’ll never 
get far without people who are supportive of the work you do. I’ve been 
fortunate to have a great many in my life.
