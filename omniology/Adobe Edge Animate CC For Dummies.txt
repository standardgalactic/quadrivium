Dedication
This book is dedicated to my family. Much gratitude goes out to my parents; 
without them, I probably would have never earned my technical writing 
stripes. And to my wife and kids who sacrificed evenings and more than one 
weekend to allow me the time to write, rewrite, take screenshots, retake 
screenshots, and drone on and on over writing this book, which took a year 
to complete. To their credit, they encourage me to keep on writing. I love 
you all.

Author’s Acknowledgments
This book would not have been possible without the encouragement, recom­
mendations, and guidance that I received from many people across several 
different organizations. It all began with Brad Jones, currently of QuinStreet, 
who referred me to Wiley when I asked him how to get started writing books. 
Brad introduced me to Mary Bednarek, who then introduced me to Katie 
Feltman, who became my Acquisitions Editor. Later, I connected with Pat 
O’Brien, whose editing skills turned the book into what you see today. I want 
to thank them all for taking a chance on me as a first-time book author.
I also want to thank the good folks at Adobe, in particular Josh Hatwich, who 
invited me to join the Customer Advisory Board for Adobe Edge Animate. My 
participation on the board provided much of the content that I wrote for this 
book. In addition, I want to acknowledge Corrinna Rainwater of Adobe for 
providing her technical edits. Her contributions provided the extra details 
that helped me look like I knew what I was doing.

Introduction
M

y interest in Edge Animate started when my editor at HTMLgoodies.
com sent me an e-mail asking if I was interested in covering a couple 
of new software titles that Adobe was working on. The first title was Adobe 
Muse, a website creation tool aimed primarily at designers. The other title 
was Adobe Edge, which was later renamed as Adobe Edge Animate CC. As 
a person who prides himself on always wanting to learn new things, I took 
up my editor’s offer, and I downloaded a free preview of Edge. From there, I 
wrote several articles for HTMLgoodies on how to use Edge and what it could 
do. My interest became so deep that I wanted to pursue writing a book on the 
topic. Now, more than a year later, you’re holding that book in your hands.
I was lucky enough to be involved with the Adobe developers who created 
Edge Animate. I attended the Customer Advisory Board meetings online and 
took careful notes for each new preview release. I had to keep my mouth shut 
under terms of an NDA, and it was tough to not start writing articles right 
away on new features that were about to be announced. It was very exciting 
watching the software develop over the months. I saw new features added, 
then removed, then implemented back in. I provided some of my own input 
on what features I would like to see added and how the tool could be used. 
Hopefully, through this book, I can convey everything I learned over the past 
year to you in a simple, easy-to-understand format that even the most inexpe­
rienced designer, animator, developer, or hobbyist can learn from and appre­
ciate. It is my sincere wish that you learn how to use Adobe Edge Animate CC 
so that you can use it effectively in your day-to-day work. You can find me 
on both Facebook (www.facebook.com/AdobeEdgeAnimateForDummies) 
and Twitter (https://twitter.com/AnimateDummies).
Foolish Assumptions
I assumed absolutely nothing when I wrote this book. Except for maybe that 
you are a die-hard web content creator who yearns to learn the most advanced 
web techniques on the planet, which of course, this book provides for you. On 
the other hand, you really don’t even have to be all that die-hard about wanting 
to find out how to make animations using HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS without 
even knowing how to code. All I ask for is at least a mild curiosity on what 
Adobe has built with Edge Animate and what it can do for you.

Adobe Edge Animate CC For Dummies 
If you picked up this book looking for a replacement for Adobe Flash, then you 
may want to keep searching. Although it may be true that Edge Animate may 
eventually replace Flash, that isn’t going to happen now or in the next year 
or two. I wrote this book assuming that you’ve never worked in Flash or even 
know the first thing about Flash. In fact, just forget about Flash altogether. You 
will never read a sentence that begins with, “Just like in Flash, you can. . . .” 
Adobe Edge Animate CC For Dummies is focused on the future, and there is very 
little discussion on the past.
How This Book Is Organized
This book was painstakingly organized, then torn apart, then put together 
again. The end result is a highly polished, extremely well put together book 
that will have you jumping from one chapter to the next. The editors did an 
excellent job of trying to make me, as the author, look good. Here’s what we 
wound up with.
Part I: Getting Started with Edge Animate
In the first part of this book, I walk you through the background of the Edge 
suite of tools that Adobe has put together as a means for web developers 
to help create the web. I also discuss browser concerns and compatibility, 
which, I hope, becomes an obsolete chapter in the coming years.
I also go into detail on how you can design interactive and adaptive presen­
tations using Edge Animate. This includes the ability to reuse symbols for 
multiple projects, incorporating a responsive web design, figuring out the 
multi-featured publishing options, and more.
Also included in the first part is a process for creating an animation project 
with ideas on how to present your project online. After all, what good is an 
animation that lives only on your desktop — put it online and let the world 
see your creation!
The first part concludes with you actually using Edge Animate by drawing 
and editing elements. Hopefully, you find the entire book is filled with func­
tional and effective instruction that you can use in your everyday work 
(or fun).

 Introduction
Part II: Adopting Tools and Techniques
The second part of this book dives in to a discussion on the tools and fea­
tures of Adobe Edge Animate CC. I go into detail on using the Timeline, work­
ing with keyframes, and understanding how the Stage works.
I also start discussions on working with triggers, actions, labels, and adding 
attributes to cursors. All these features enable you to make animations that 
your audience can interact with.
Part II finishes with details on using the workspace and customizing it as you 
prefer. You can manipulate all of the frames and panels to appear to your 
liking. What’s more, you can save your own custom layout for use with future 
projects.
Part III: Formatting and Animating
The third part of this book is all about the formatting and animating. At this 
point, you really get to the meat of the Edge Animate software. I go into detail 
on the Transform tool, setting visibility, positioning, and sizing. In addition, 
there are whole chapters on animating color, borders, corners, shadows, and 
more. This includes animating and formatting text boxes.
This part concludes with chapters on using the Elements panel, the Library 
panel, and even more on fonts. There’s a ton you can do with Edge Animate, 
and these chapters are geared to make it all the more user-friendly.
Part IV: Putting Your Animation to Use
All the formatting and animating in the world would be pointless if you couldn’t 
put your animation to use. That’s where Part IV comes into play. I devote 
pages of text to explaining about the Edge Animate project structure and the 
files that Edge Animate generates, including files for use with Apple iBooks 
and Adobe’s InDesign.
Getting your animation ready for publication goes beyond just clicking Save. 
You can set up several different types of publishing options depending on how 
and where you want to use your project. If you want to put your animation 
online, this part has you covered with discussions on putting your project 
into an existing web page, into a Joomla! or WordPress site, or on putting it 
online as a stand-alone page.

Adobe Edge Animate CC For Dummies 
Part V: Creating Sample Projects 
Part V was my favorite to write. This is where I could put to practical use 
everything taught in all of the proceeding chapters. While writing these sec­
tions, I tried to go as step-by-step as possible, but I also assumed that you 
took the time to become familiar with the basics. After all, you have to crawl 
before you can walk, and you have to walk before you can run.
After you start running through this part, you will be creating slideshows, 
interactive tutorials, and even animated children’s books. You also find out 
how to synchronize elements and how to use easing and rotating effectively. 
In addition, I present examples on how to create navigation for one-page sites 
such as infographics or even a restaurant site. I even include how to incorpo­
rate your slideshow as a symbol into another site. I found it very cool to tie 
so many different aspects together for a cohesive project.
The last chapter in this part may prove the most beneficial in terms of dis­
covering some very cutting-edge web techniques in terms of developing a 
responsive web design. Creating animations that can respond to screen size 
is a growing trend in web development, and the very first version of Adobe 
Edge Animate CC has you covered.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
The “Part of Tens” rounds this book out with a couple of top-ten lists. What 
For Dummies book would be complete without this section? Here, I present 
one list of the top ten users of Adobe Edge Animate CC and follow that up 
with a list of resources that are sprinkled throughout this book.
Icons Used in This Book
I use several icons throughout this book as a way to draw your attention to 
special information. Depending on the icon, this information is the type of 
stuff you can skip right over or give a quick glance, or in some really special 
cases, it’s the type of information that you may want to study closely.
	
The Technical Stuff icon mainly refers to code that developers may like. These 
are the icons that many of you may want to glance over briefly, whereas 
others of you, perhaps the Cliff Clavens out there, might relish.

5
 Introduction
	
This entire book is full of Tip icons, ranging from special shortcut keys to per­
forming tasks a different way than presented in the main text. Some tips con­
tain useful information that doesn’t quite fit with the other text but that I still 
want to get across to you.
	
Ahhh, the dreaded Warning icon. This icon lets you know when pirates are 
about to attack. Whoops. Nope, that was for my other For Dummies book 
about sailing the high seas (that book doesn’t exist, at least, not yet). The 
Warning icon mostly denotes when things may not work or when you could be 
in danger of losing your project. I recommend reading the warnings.
	
The Remember icon presents information that’s useful keep in mind for other 
times. You own the book, so you don’t actually need to remember most of the 
stuff that’s in it. Just open the book and follow the instructions when you 
need to.
Where to Go From Here
This book works a couple of ways. If you want to comprehend the capabili­
ties of Edge Animate and make projects with it, simply start at the beginning 
and follow through, page by page, until you reach the Index at the back. It’s 
worth the trip.
If you have a question about a feature, find it in the Index and jump straight 
to that page.
Occasionally, we have updates to our technology books. If this book does 
have technical updates, they’ll be posted at www.dummies.com/go/
edgenaimatefdupdates.
I can’t promise that every word will have you riveted to your seat with hands 
trembling in anticipation as you turn the page, but I can sincerely tell you 
that I wrote this book to show you, in the best possible way that I could, how 
to use Adobe Edge Animate CC.
If you’re ready to see all about Adobe Edge Animate CC, turn the page. It’s 
time to start!

▶	Cruising the Adobe Creative Cloud and where Edge Animate fits in
▶	Using Edge Animate compatibly with Adobe software, tools, and services
▶	Spotting where Edge Animate projects work and don’t work and how Adobe addresses 
those concerns
▶	Introducing the Edge Animate animation process

I

n this chapter, I show you the Adobe Creative Cloud and all the tools, 
services, apps, and software titles available; this includes Adobe Edge 
Animate CC. Adobe has fully embraced the cloud; now you can get the latest 
updates and features without having to wait for the next full version. A sub­
scription to the Creative Cloud means access to all the latest developments.
What’s even better is that Edge Animate is fully compatible with many of the 
titles in the Creative Cloud — with more features added regularly.
Edge Animate uses HTML5, which (even now) not all browsers support. 
Fortunately, Adobe provides features that help you when your audience 
isn’t using modern browsers. Most likely you’ll find there’s more support for 
HTML5 these days than for Flash; the jury is still out on what this means for 
the future of Flash.
But onward: This chapter also provides an overview of creating a project in 
Edge Animate. You may recognize this process as being the same you use 
for many other different types of projects. It’s all about the organization and 
planning.

Part I: Getting Started with Adobe Edge Animate 
Adobe Wants You to Create the Web
As part of introducing Edge Animate, Adobe also announced
	
✓	Edge Suite: An entire set of tools to help you create your part of the web.
	
✓	Creative Cloud: Everything you need to use Edge Animate is in the cloud.
	
✓	Design and development features: Edge Animate is great for both 
designers and developers.
	
✓	Compatibility: Edge Animate works with many different software tools.
	
✓	Web-friendly animation features: Adobe Edge Animate CC comes with a 
long list of features for creating modern web animations.
Introducing the Edge suite
In late September 2012, at the Create the Web event in downtown San 
Francisco, Adobe announced its entire suite of Edge tools and software. 
Through this event, Adobe reaffirmed its commitment to providing the best 
services for creative artists, web designers, and animators. It also cranked up 
support for HTML5 as the future of the World Wide Web. Flash animation is 
fading into the history books.
The Adobe Edge Suite is one part of the Creative Cloud that Adobe 
announced (as shown in Figure 1-1 and featured in its own sidebar later in the 
chapter) consists of these tools:
	
✓	Edge Animate: The main tool for turning static graphics and text into 
modern web animations.
	
✓	Reflow (planned for release after the publication of this book): Geared 
toward helping designers to create a responsive web design.
	
✓	Code: You can use Code to preview CSS, edit code, and integrate other 
code for design work.
	
✓	Inspect: An excellent app that allows you to synch your desktop to your 
mobile device so you can install updates as they happen.
	
✓	Web Fonts: Free fonts that you can use with Edge Animate.
	
✓	Typekit: Another source of fonts that you can use with Edge Animate.
	
✓	PhoneGap Build: A tool for creating mobile apps with HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript.

Your tools are in the cloud
All these tools and services are available through Adobe’s Creative Cloud — a 
one-stop shop for the majority of Adobe’s creative software (including Photoshop, 
After Effects, InDesign, Illustrator, Fireworks, Muse, and Dreamweaver). Most 
tools for most of these software products are compatible with Edge Animate.
You can get started with the Creative Cloud with a free membership for 30 
days that includes 2GB of cloud storage and limited access to services. You 
can find more about the Creative Cloud online at http://html.adobe.com.
Creating animated web content
Adobe Edge Animate CC is a brand new software tool that allows everyone 
from beginners to expert web designers to create animated web content. 
What separates Edge Animate from other animation tools is that it uses the 
most advanced standards and methodology in its code. This rampant moder­
nity includes the use of HTML5 and JavaScript — in particular, jQuery.
Adobe is providing the best of both worlds to accommodate all types of 
animators:
	
✓	If working with jQuery sounds scary, even if that’s a good kind of scary, 
it shouldn’t. Edge Animate does all the coding for you. All you have to 
do is conjure up the creative aspects of your design.
	
✓	On the other hand, if you do know how to code with jQuery and you like 
to dive in to the brackets, then Edge Animate provides a very functional 
code panel from which you can work.

Part I: Getting Started with Adobe Edge Animate 
Collaborating with other publishing tools
While Edge Animate is a terrific tool for creating online content, it doesn’t 
actually publish your animation online. Fortunately, Edge Animate is compat­
ible with several publishing tools, applications, and platforms. Here’s a quick 
look at each tool and application.
iBook Files
If you weren’t already aware, iBooks is one of the most popular and most 
downloaded apps for Apple devices, including iPhones and iPads.
By using Edge Animate to create your compositions, you can feel confident 
that your audience will see your animation play flawlessly on some of the 
most popular phones and tablets around. Even better, you can export your 
Edge Animate composition in formats that are compatible for use with 
Apple’s iBook Author.
Adobe InDesign
InDesign is desktop publishing software that is also made by Adobe. It allows 
you to create pages for print, tablets, and other platforms and devices. 
InDesign is also part of Adobe’s Creative Cloud and works well with Edge 
Animate. Exporting files from Edge Animate is a matter of clicking a few menu 
items and then it’s only a matter of placing the files into InDesign.
InDesign outputs ePUB documents that work on the Apple iPad. The iBook 
app for the iPad uses the ePUB format. Through these tools, you are provided 
another way to incorporate your animation compositions into iBooks.
Adobe Dreamweaver
Adobe Dreamweaver has been helping budding web developers create websites 
since 2005, which is when Adobe acquired Dreamweaver from Macromedia. 
Using Dreamweaver, a web designer can whip up HTML websites and mobile 
apps with cross-platform compatibility, loads of features, and multiscreen 
previews. Now, with the release of Edge Animate 1.0, Adobe has updated 
Dreamweaver to include support for your animation projects: You can con­
tinue building websites in Dreamweaver and import your projects from Edge 
Animate.
Adobe Fireworks
Adobe Fireworks is another former Macromedia software product that you 
can use to create bitmap and vector graphics. Web designers use it in com­
bination with Dreamweaver, and now Edge Animate, to create interfaces, 
onscreen designs, and interactive content for tablets and phones.

13
 Chapter 1: Introducing Adobe Edge Animate CC
Adobe Muse
Adobe Muse is another tool for the website builder, aimed directly at design 
artists with little or no coding skill. Muse is brand new; a preview was 
released in 2012.
If you’re a designer who’s comfortable with creating print layouts, then work­
ing with Muse should come naturally. Plus, if you want your design site to 
feature a composition made in Edge Animate, such projects are easy to add 
to your Muse site.
Adobe Inspect
Adobe Shadow was renamed Inspect in late 2012.
Presently, Flash won’t work on several types of devices — but Edge Animate 
will — and you’ll want to preview your work on as many different screen sizes 
as you can. That’s where Inspect comes into play. This tool allows you to view 
updates that you make to your animation on a variety of devices instantly.
Highlighting the Critical Features
Adobe Edge Animate CC is about more than just web animation. Some 
advanced web designers have already created entire sites using Edge Animate; 
don’t be surprised if Edge Animate replaces Flash in the near future. The rea­
son’s a no-brainer: Because Edge Animate uses HTML5 and JavaScript, this 
expands your potential audience by making your content available to view on 
modern browsers and a wider range of devices — even those that block Flash.
The Edge Animate features that are most vital to web development include 
links, loops, interactivity, and a responsive web design. The limits on what 
you can do with Edge Animate rest mainly within the confines of your imagi­
nation. With Edge Animate, you’ll create slide shows, logos, and sites; animated 
or not, with or without links, all text, all images, or a combination of text and 
images.
If you have a passion, or just have a passing interest in creating web anima­
tion, then you at the very least owe it to yourself to check out Adobe Edge 
Animate CC — and to continue reading this book.
Maintaining Browser Compatibility
Adobe Edge Animate CC works in all modern browsers — including the most 
recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Internet Explorer 9. 

14
Part I: Getting Started with Adobe Edge Animate 
It also works on all tablets and smart phones that have modern browsers 
installed. For audiences that don’t use modern browsers, Edge Animate does 
provide a fallback option that you can use so that your animation does not 
appear broken. This fallback option is discussed later in this section.
	
Compatibility is important for web content; if a browser doesn’t support your 
code, then your animation won’t work. No wonder Adobe Edge Animate CC 
creates code that works in all modern browsers.
A brief history of HTML
HTML5 is the slowly evolving next iteration of HTML (HyperText Markup 
Language), the coding language that developers use to create web pages. 
The very first version of HTML was introduced in the early 1990s. HTML2 
was released in 1995. In 1997, HTML3 came out and was closely followed by 
HTML4 — the version that most web developers are familiar with — which is 
presently the predominant markup language.
Over the past few years, enterprising developers have turned their attention 
to creating web content with HTML5, even though it isn’t the new standard 
for everyone — at least not yet. Modern web browsers, however, are already 
utilizing HTML5 functionality, and HTML5 will most likely become the norm 
for web development in the near future. Using and learning HTML5 now will 
put you ahead of the pack as the future of web development unfolds.
Concerns with HTML5 and older browsers
Many web developers are concerned that not all parts of HTML5 are compat­
ible with all browsers. This is especially true with Internet Explorer. Where 
many features of HTML5 will work in browsers such as Chrome and Firefox, 
they will not always work in Internet Explorer. This leaves many web devel­
opers questioning how widely they should start using HTML5. It isn’t in a web 
developer’s best interest to create web pages that don’t work in all browsers — 
but the future is still a bit murky, and lots of folks are content to use old 
browsers.
Adobe has addressed these issues with Edge Animate. You can feel safe and 
secure knowing that your Edge Animate web compositions will work in all 
modern browsers, including the current versions of Firefox, Chrome, Safari, 
and Internet Explorer 9.

15
 Chapter 1: Introducing Adobe Edge Animate CC
	
You don’t need to know HTML5, or even HTML, to use Edge Animate. But the 
more you know, the better off you’ll be if you need to use the code to help 
implement it for viewing. The Edge Animate software creates the code for you 
while you build your web animation.
	
When you save your Edge Animate file, the software creates several different 
files. One of those files has the .html filename extension. The HTML5 code 
is within the .html file. You can view this file with any plain text editor such 
as Notepad. After you’re done creating your composition, you can view the 
animation in a web browser — either from within the software, or by double-
clicking the .html file, which opens and plays your animation in your default 
browser.
Desktop browser compatibility
Compatibility with the Microsoft Internet Explorer web browser is an issue 
that web developers have to contend with when developing sites. Microsoft 
has been slow to update Internet Explorer to be compatible with HTML5 — 
and code that works perfectly fine in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox doesn’t 
behave well in earlier versions of Internet Explorer.
For example, if you code a border to have rounded edges, then your corners 
will appear rounded off in Chrome and Firefox; but view that same site in IE 
and suddenly your rounded edges appear square. Issues like this can ruin a 
website’s design.
Browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera already support many 
aspects of HTML5. There are no concerns with Adobe Edge Animate CC com­
positions working perfectly in these browsers. These browsers also have 
built-in automatic updates for their users. Because of that, web designers and 
developers can feel certain that their users are most likely using the most 
current version of that browser.
What to do for Internet Explorer 8 
and older versions
In an ideal world, everyone would upgrade their browsers regularly. 
Unfortunately, not everyone can do that, for whatever reason. Even though 
Internet Explorer 9 has opened the door to HTML5 compatibility, which 
means Edge Animate works in that version of the browser, not all IE users 
have upgraded their browsers. It’s still not uncommon for many IE users to 

16
Part I: Getting Started with Adobe Edge Animate 
use versions 7 and 8 — and (to many designers’ horror and dismay) IE 6 is 
still in use by many people.
	
Adobe Edge Animate CC compositions will not work in Internet Explorer 8 and 
older versions, just as HTML5 doesn’t work in IE6.
However, the good news is that more and more web users are upgrading 
their browsers, and usage of IE6 is slowly dwindling. With that said, though, 
Edge Animate works in all modern portable browsers. If your main goal is 
to create animated applications for use on smart phones and tablets, then 
you’re very much in luck.
If you’re creating web animations for an audience who still uses IE8 and older 
browsers, that lurking obsolescence can be a concern when you’re using 
Adobe Edge Animate CC. Say that you spend countless hours developing the 
perfect web animation and then put it online. You tested it in Firefox and IE 9, 
and it works perfectly. Then you walk across the hall to show it to your boss — 
and to your horror, it doesn’t work because your boss is using IE 6. Well, in 
the real world, there’s a good chance many of your clients and customers are 
also using an earlier version of IE that isn’t compatible with Edge Animate. 
Fortunately, Edge Animate has you covered with at least two options: You can 
(a) use Google Chrome Frame support or (b) use down-level browser support — 
a feature that enables you to create a poster (a static image), or to use static 
HTML, to replace the animation — which keeps your website from appearing 
“broken.” Your audience sees an image that looks the way it’s supposed to 
look, even though it’s not animated. (Chapter 14 details down-level support.)
Google Chrome Frame support
Edge Animate has a feature that enables you to use Google Chrome Frame 
support for browsers that don’t support animation. As a next step to down-
level browser support, you can publish Edge Animate content so that your 
audience can view it on IE 6, 7, or 8 using Google Chrome Frame. For the user 
who doesn’t already have Google Chrome Frame, you can also control the 
experience of installing it.
Edge Animate has down-level Stages
The down-level Stages in Edge Animate are versions of the Stage that you can 
use to create and publish a down-level version of your composition that will 
be compatible with browsers that don’t support HTML5 animation. (I go into 
detail on down-level Stage usage in Chapter 14.) The down-level Stages offer 
only minimal creation tools, but you can 
	
✓	Import graphics and create text elements.
	
✓	Import a poster from the main composition.

17
 Chapter 1: Introducing Adobe Edge Animate CC
Basically, the animations that you create and place online can detect the 
browsers your audience is using. If the code detects that someone is using 
a non-compatible browser for your animation, then it reverts to showing a 
poster image instead of the animation. This saves your website from appear­
ing broken. Instead of seeing an animation that doesn’t work, the audience 
sees a poster — a still frame — that you create from the animation.
Again, you don’t have to know code for the down-level Stage support to work. 
Although coding for browser detection can be tricky, Edge Animate has that 
capability built in — and it’s an option you can choose when you’re ready to 
publish.
Compatibility with tablet 
and mobile browsers
Where Adobe Flash fails, Adobe Edge Animate CC works. It’s well known that 
Apple doesn’t allow Adobe Flash animation to work in its portable devices — 
and that includes the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad. Steve Jobs, before his 
passing, stated that Flash had too many security vulnerabilities and other 
negative aspects for Apple to allow Flash to work with iOS.
Edge Animate, on the other hand, doesn’t suffer from those issues. Your 
Edge Animate compositions will work just fine on Apple products — and on 
Android devices — whether tablets of all types, smart phones, and other 
devices that use modern mobile browsers.
Creating an Edge Animate Composition
The process for creating an Edge Animate CC composition isn’t too different 
from creating any other type of content. When starting, you should consider 
what, where, and how you want your animation to appear. Will your animation 
be part of an existing website? Are you adding an animation to complement 
a book? Is your client requesting a brand new animated logo? Perhaps you 
want to create an advertisement to appear on the web? You can create all 
these projects using Edge Animate.
Here’s the basic outline for creating an Edge Animate composition:
	
1.	 Determine how you and your audience will use this animation.
	
2.	 Collect your images and other assets.

18
Part I: Getting Started with Adobe Edge Animate 
	
3.	 Write an outline.
	
4.	 Create and save commonly used elements such as buttons for re-use 
later.
	
5.	 Start animating.
	
6.	 Save and export your finished animation.
	
Before you start animating, consider whether your animation will be viewed 
in an e-reader, in the browser, in iBooks, or be an app for use on both iOS and 
Android devices.
No matter the device, if it supports HTML5 and JavaScript, your Edge Animate 
project will run smoothly.
Gathering your assets
After you know what you want to create and where you want it to appear, it’s 
time to start gathering your assets — electronically drawn images, photographs, 
paragraphs of text, or a combination of all three — that will make up the final 
animation. Edge Animate makes it easy to import or create these assets.
Creating an outlined approach 
to your animation
At this point you have defined the purpose of your animation and the art to 
make it beautiful. Now you need to create a wireframe, essentially an outline 
of how you want your animation to play. Sure, you can wing it and make it 
up as you go along, but an excellent idea is to picture your animation in your 
head, and then put down on paper how you imagine your animation will play 
from start to finish. This outline provides a base from which you can work.
Making symbols for frequently 
used elements
If you know your animation is going to contain many similar elements, or the 
same elements repeated over and over, you want to create those elements 
first. Elements are the different pieces that make up your animation. An ele­
ment can be a box that you draw, a text box that you specify, an image that 
you import, and so on.
www.allitebooks.com

19
 Chapter 1: Introducing Adobe Edge Animate CC
An element that you may want to reuse can be a button, or an asset that you 
re-use throughout the animation, or any type of navigation the audience 
can use.
After you create this element and have it behaving the way you want, you 
can then save it as a symbol. You can then export this symbol for use in other 
projects. That way, if this animation becomes a part of a series of animations 
and you want to re-use the same symbols, you’ll be ahead of the game by 
having some assets already saved and ready to go when you create the actual 
animation.
	
You can even save an entire animation project as a symbol. For example, if 
you create a slideshow animation, you can save that entire slide show as a 
symbol, which you can then export from Edge Animate — and then import 
into a different Edge Animate project. (Chapter 12 has the details on creating 
and working with symbols.)
Animators, start your animating
When you have a purpose for your animation, all of your assets are lined up 
and ready to go, and you’ve saved your multi-use elements as symbols, it’s 
time to start animating.
To start animating, you import your assets onto the Stage. Then you use the 
Timeline to create keyframes. A keyframe represents an animation sequence. 
For example, if you animate a box moving from one side of the Stage to the 
other, that animation is represented in the Timeline as a keyframe. (I go into 
the details of working with keyframes and the Timeline in Chapter 4.) From 
there, you add actions to your elements for interactivity. As you create your 
animation, you can preview it to make sure the animation is behaving as you 
expect it to behave.
Saving and exporting your animation
When you finish creating your animation project, you want to save or export 
your composition for use by your audience or for use in another project or 
design tool. Edge Animate provides many options to export and save your 
work. Likewise, there are multitudes of options on how you can present your 
work both online, or in iBooks, or for use with other design tools. Chapter 15 
has the details for putting your project online.

Part I: Getting Started with Adobe Edge Animate 
Adobe Edge Animate CC and the Creative Cloud
Adobe has embraced the cloud in a big way. 
Over the past few years, the term “cloud” has 
become a popular buzzword among the digerati 
(the tech gurus and their disciples) to mean all 
the documents, software, apps, pictures, and 
such that are stored online — which you can 
access through the Internet. When someone 
says, “it’s in the cloud,” the translation is, “it’s 
available online.”
Adobe’s answer to the cloud comes in the 
form of a feature called the Creative Cloud — 
an online location where you can find the 
latest versions of the vast majority of Adobe 
creative software titles. No longer do you 
need to wait for new features to sprout and 
full-version cycles to run their course before 
you can receive software updates. By placing 
everything in the cloud, Adobe can update your 
software as needed — that’s one of the main 
benefits of paying a subscription.
The software in the Creative Cloud includes 
Photoshop, InDesign, Flash, and much more. 
Brand new titles, as of 2013, include the Edge 
suite of tools.
The Edge suite of tools includes Edge Animate, 
Code, Inspect, Web Fonts, Typekit, PhoneGap 
Build, and an upcoming title currently called 
Reflow. Each of these tools serves a unique 
purpose, and they all tie in nicely together:
	✓	Edge Code is all about coding the web. 
Currently in preview, you can use Code to 
preview CSS, edit code and integrate other 
code for design work. Code is based on an 
understanding of how HTML5, CSS3, and 
JavaScript work together and continually 
evolve. Adobe states that, “if you have the 
skills to use Edge Code, you also have the 
skills to customize the editor and contribute 
new features.” You can find more informa­
tion here: http://html.adobe.com/
edge/code
	✓	Edge Inspect is all about previewing the 
creative content that you create. Adobe 
knows that just because you might create 
your content on a desktop, that doesn’t 
mean your audience will view it on a desk­
top monitor. Rather, your audience may 
view your content on a tablet, or a phone, 
or any other number of devices. Inspect 
allows you to wirelessly pair several differ­
ent types of devices to the machine where 
you create the content. When you do this, 
you can then view the changes you make 
update instantly as you work. More infor­
mation here: http://html.adobe.
com/edge/inspect
	✓	Edge Web Fonts is all about free web fonts. 
This large collection of fonts was gath­
ered from sources such as Adobe, Google, 
and independent designers. Web Fonts is 
already available for use with Edge Code — 
and will eventually become a part of Edge 
Reflow as well. The fonts are served by 
Typekit, which leads us to . . . (More infor­
mation here: http://html.adobe.
com/edge/webfonts)
	✓	Typekit is all about commercial fonts. 
Launched in September 2009 by Small 
Batch, Inc. (the folks behind Google 
Analytics), it was acquired by Adobe in 
October 2011. You can find over 700 fonts 
in Typekit and can search for them by clas­
sification, properties, or recommended use. 
Adobe makes it very easy to add these fonts 
into your websites by copying and pasting 
a couple of lines of code into the head 
tag of your HTML. More information here: 
http://html.adobe.com/edge/
typekit
	✓	PhoneGap Build is all about mobile. You 
can use PhoneGap Build to create mobile 
apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

 Chapter 1: Introducing Adobe Edge Animate CC
Finishing the process
Eventually, through this process, you’ve created an animation using HTML5 
and jQuery — without typing a single line of code. Your audience may never 
know the technologies that made the animation they watch and interact with 
possible (for that matter, you may not fully understand the advanced coding 
techniques that make it possible — or ever have to). But that’s the beauty of 
Adobe Edge Animate CC: It does all the heavy lifting behind the scenes, which 
allows you to sit back and do what you do best — create beautiful animated 
and interactive content that can respond to fit and form with any number of 
screen sizes and devices.
Presenting Your Project Online
After pouring your blood, sweat, and tears going through the process of cre­
ating your animation, you most likely want to put it online so that the world 
can enjoy your magnificent creation. There are many ways you can put your 
Edge Animate composition online or embed it in another tool for presentation, 
such as an iBook. Your animation can be a standalone web page, occupy part 
of a website as its own page, or be embedded in an existing page. You can 
add Edge Animate projects to content management systems (CMS) such as 
With this tool, you build your app in the 
cloud, and Adobe keeps you current with 
the latest SDK (software development 
kit). Probably the most impressive feature 
to PhoneGap Build is that you can create 
iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry, 
webOS, and Symbian technologies, all 
from this one tool. More information here: 
http://html.adobe.com/edge/
phonegap-build
	✓	Reflow is all about responsive web design, 
an upcoming trend in web design that 
content developers are paying attention 
to. A responsive web design allows you to 
design once and have your creation look 
great no matter the screen size your audi­
ence is using. To get notified when a pre­
view of Reflow becomes available, you can 
sign up here: http://html.adobe.
com/edge/reflow
You can access all these tools and more 
through a subscription to the Creative Cloud. If 
you’re unsure about spending money on cloud 
services, Adobe offers a free 30-day trial. This 
trial period gives you access to limited services 
and 2GB of storage. You can use the storage 
to save your projects. If your trial expires and 
you have projects saved in the cloud, you don’t 
have to worry about losing your work. When 
you decide to start a paid subscription using the 
same account as the free trial, then your work 
is ready and waiting for you to return. Following 
this same line of thought, if you allow your paid 
subscription to run out, Adobe saves your proj­
ects in the cloud for a determined length of 
time. This allows you to renew your subscrip­
tion later, and your work is still there; provided 
that you don’t wait too long.

WordPress, Joomla!, or Blogger. See Chapters 13 through 16 for more infor­
mation on posting your animation online.
	
When you save your Edge Animate project, the software creates many differ­
ent files for you. One of those files is written in HTML5. You can upload this 
HTML file, along with the other files that Edge Animate creates, to the web via 
FTP to your site or your client’s site. Doing it that way allows you to create a 
single web page for your animation or make it part of a larger site.
	
It is also possible to embed your animation into an existing web page. If you 
want to do that, then you must still upload the files that Edge Animate creates 
for you to the folder structure of the site where the page lives. Then, you grab 
a snippet of code from the HTML file that Edge Animate created for you and 
place that snippet of code into the HTML file of the page where you want the 
animation to appear.
The snippet of code that you want to copy and paste from the Edge Animate 
HTML file to the HTML file of the page you want to embed your animation 
looks like this:
<!--Adobe Edge Runtime-->
    <script type=”text/javascript” charset=”utf-8” src=”Untitled-1_edgePreload.
js”></script>
    <style>
        .edgeLoad-EDGE-15449885 { visibility:hidden; }
    </style>
<!--Adobe Edge Runtime End-->
	
You also have to place a line of code such as this into the body tag of the page:
<div id=”Stage” class=”EDGE-13887483”>
For more about this requirement, see Chapter 15.
The preceding code may look a little intimidating for those who don’t know 
code, but there’s really nothing to fret over. Basically, this code snippet is 
what calls your animation into action. The HTML file acts as a shell that trig­
gers the JavaScript. Make sure that you upload all the files that Edge Animate 
creates for you, so that your composition doesn’t appear broken. (See 
Chapter 15 for more information on putting your project on the web.)
The .edgeLoad line of code in this code snippet contains a unique number, 
in this case, 15449885. This number was created by Edge Animate to connect 
the HTML file to the JavaScript files. If you alter this number, you will break 
the connection between the files and your animation will not play correctly.

Discovering Awesome 
Features and Tools
In This Chapter
▶	Getting to know the essential animation tools
▶	Creating interactive, responsive animations
▶	Exploring font, language, and publishing options
▶	Seeing how Edge Animate supports your coding habit
A

dobe Edge Animate CC is a powerful, flexible program for creating and 
publishing animations for the web. In this chapter, I introduce you 
to many features of Adobe Edge Animate CC, including essentials such as 
the Stage, the Timeline, and familiar drawing tools. And I tell you about the 
options that Edge Animate provides for publishing and saving files, as well 
as choices it offers for your interface language and for web-friendly fonts. 
For those who like to dive below the surface, I describe the framework of the 
JavaScript API and working with native HTML in the code panels that Edge 
Animate places at your disposal. And — probably most important in this day 
and age of multiple screen sizes — you find out about creating a responsive 
web design that resizes itself to fit various devices.
Meeting Your Most-Used Animation Tools
Building even a basic animation in Adobe Edge Animate CC involves using 
three primary tools: 
	
✓	Stage: The Stage is a live HTML window built directly into Edge Animate. 
It’s where you draw elements such as rectangles, squares, and circles. 
Later on, you can add style and animations to those elements and even 
add actions such as links. You can also import images to the Stage — 
which you can also animate and make interactive for your audience. 
Finally, you can use the Stage to preview your animation.

24
Part I: Getting Started with Adobe Edge Animate 
	
✓	Timeline: This part of the screen is where you add keyframes and ani­
mation sequences that make your composition come alive. From the 
Timeline you can edit where, when, and for how long an animation 
sequence takes place.
	
✓	Drawing toolbar: You can draw rectangles, rounded rectangles, and 
even ellipses, including perfect circles, using the drawing tools. Also 
included is a Text tool so you can write text within your animation. 
Adding elements to your animation is one of the first steps in creating a 
composition in Edge Animate.
These three tools — the Stage, Timeline, and Drawing toolbar — are essential 
to creating an animation. The Stage is where your composition comes alive; 
the Timeline is where you plot your animation sequences; and the drawing 
tools help you create the elements that become the assets of your animation.
Putting a spotlight on the Stage
The majority of the Adobe Edge Animate CC interface consists of the Stage. The 
Stage is where you build your animations. When you first open Edge Animate, 
and you choose to create a new file, you’re presented with a crisp, white, blank 
Stage from which you can start to build your project (see Figure 2-1).
	
Figure 2-1: 
A blank 
Stage to get 
you started.
	
The Stage is located at the top center of the interface and has the following 
handy characteristics for creating your animations:
	
✓	It is a live HTML window: At first, the Stage may not look like much — but 
as you create your animation, you notice an abundance of functionality.
	
	One of the Stage’s best features is that you can watch your animation 
play on it. You don’t necessarily have to switch to a browser to preview 
your work. Instead, you can preview your animation by watching it on the 
Stage — because the Stage is actually an HTML window. It’s virtually the 
same as a standard web browser, but it’s built right into Edge Animate.

25
 Chapter 2: Discovering Awesome Features and Tools
	
✓	It has rules and guides: Two additional features to the Stage are the 
rules and guides shown in Figure 2-2:
 
• One ruler runs along both the top of the Stage; another runs down 
the length of the Stage on the left side. You can use these rulers to 
help place your assets (such as images and text) on the Stage.
 
• The guides are thin purple lines that stretch from the ruler across 
the Stage and to the opposite side of the screen. You can use these 
guides to help position your elements on the Stage. (Elements can 
be anything from drawn circles and rectangles to images to text 
boxes and other parts that make up the animation.)
	
Figure 2-2: 
The Stage, 
with hori-
zontal and 
vertical 
guides 
shown.
	
To place a guide on the Stage, place the cursor over the ruler, and then click 
and drag. The purple guide then appears. To move the guide around the 
Stage, click it and drag it.
	
After you place guides on the Stage, any elements (images, text boxes, and 
such) then snap to the guides. This helps you place elements exactly where 
you want them.
Engaging the intuitive, accurate, 
and flexible Timeline
Besides the Stage, the Timeline is probably the feature you use most often 
with Edge Animate. You find the Timeline at the bottom of the screen, and it 
contains many features, as follows:
	
✓	Keyframes: You use keyframes to direct when, and for how long, an ani­
mation unfolds on the Stage. The colored bars in the Timeline, shown in 
Figure 2-3, represent keyframes and indicate when an animation starts, 
stops, and for how long it will play. You can edit these keyframes with a 
click and a drag.

26
Part I: Getting Started with Adobe Edge Animate 
	
✓	Mode toggles: The Timeline also allows you to toggle different modes, 
such as Auto-Keyframes, Auto-Transitions, and the Pin, and you can 
choose different Easing attributes.
 	
✓	Animation enhancements: From the Timeline, you can tweak your anima­
tion in multiple ways — for example, by adding actions (see Chapter 5), 
specifying filter elements (see Chapter 4), and enabling Timeline snapping 
(also Chapter 4).
	
Figure 2-3: 
The 
Timeline.
	
Drawing with familiar tools
If you’ve ever used other drawing or image editing software, then you most 
likely recognize the drawing tools available in Edge Animate. If Edge Animate 
is the first artistic software you’ve used, then just relax as you discover that 
drawing elements such as rectangles and circles is as easy as clicking and 
dragging.
You can locate the drawing tools at the top of the screen, directly underneath 
the menu, as shown in Figure 2-4.
	
Figure 2-4: 
The drawing 
tools.	
The drawing tools include a rectangle, a rounded rectangle, an ellipse for 
drawing circles, and a text tool for drawing text boxes.

 Chapter 2: Discovering Awesome Features and Tools
Exploiting Features That 
Interact and Adapt
Adobe Edge Animate CC is about much more than moving elements around 
the screen. You can use many of its features to create interactivity for your 
audience — and fine-tune many more to configure the software to suit 
your preferences:
	
✓	Interactivity: You can build fully interactive animations with such controls 
and actions as buttons, links, and loops.
	
✓	Symbols: You can save elements you create (such as buttons) and use 
them again in a different animation.
	
✓	Responsive web design: Edge Animate enables you to build a composition 
that responds to browser and device window sizes.
	
✓	Multiple publishing options: Edge Animate offers numerous ways to 
publish your animation for use in different applications — such as dif­
ferent web browsers and iBooks — or you can import your Adobe Edge 
Animation into different Adobe products such as InDesign or Muse.
	
✓	Font choices: Edge Animate provides a multitude of font choices. If 
you’re fussy about particular fonts, the good news is that if you can find 
a font on the web, you can most likely use it in your animation.
	
✓	Choose your language: If English is not your native language and you 
prefer to work in (say) German, Spanish, French, or Japanese, then Edge 
Animate has you covered.
Implementing interactivity intelligently
Adobe Edge Animate CC enables you to do much more than just draw and ani­
mate elements. You can also make those elements interactive, which allows 
your audience to click on items to make different actions happen. For example, 
you can make Stop, Play, and Pause buttons for an interactive slideshow. You 
can also create a menu by adding links that allow your audience to navigate to 
different parts of your animations — or to entirely different web pages.
When your audience moves the cursor around your animation, you can 
make different actions happen when the cursor moves over specific areas. 
This kind of cursor movement is called a mouseover. Or, if your audience is 
using tablets or smart phones to view your animation, you can allow them to 
simply tap an element to cause an action.

28
Part I: Getting Started with Adobe Edge Animate 
Using Symbols to make reusable objects
At first, using Symbols may prove a bit daunting, but after you gain experi­
ence working with them, they become indispensable.
So, what exactly is a Symbol? It’s essentially a nested animation you create 
that has its own independent Timeline and interactive capabilities. For 
example, say that you find yourself creating the same element with the same 
actions over and over for many different projects. By saving that recurring 
element as a Symbol, you can reuse it and its associated actions for any proj­
ect. A prime example of a Symbol is a button. If you find yourself recreating 
the same button — say, a Play button for a slide show — you may want to 
save that Play button as a Symbol for reuse later.
You can find your Symbols in the Library panel, as shown in Figure 2-5.
	
Figure 2-5: 
How 
Symbols 
appear in 
the Library 
panel.
	
	
Edge Animate allows you to export and import Symbols. You can also copy 
and paste Symbols from one project to another for ease of use. You can even 
copy and paste Symbols that contain other Symbols. In addition, you can 
export a Symbol as a separate .ansym project and import it into another proj­
ect. See Chapter 12 for information on creating and using Symbols.
If you do find yourself using Symbols regularly, then rejoice when you 
find that you can export and import more than one Symbol at a time. Edge 
Animate combines multiple Symbols into one .ansym file when you export 
them; you can have a number of them in a single directory without worrying 
about conflicts. Plus, you can import those multiple Symbols by using that 
one file instead of several — especially useful if, besides that Play button, you 
also want to reuse a Stop and Pause button as well.

 Chapter 2: Discovering Awesome Features and Tools
Incorporating responsive web design
Right along with HTML5, responsive web design is the latest buzzword termi­
nology when it comes to web development. A responsive web design allows 
your animation to resize appropriately depending on the size of the browser 
window. This can mean many things. Say, for example, someone is viewing 
your animation on a desktop computer. If the user resizes the browser 
window to make it bigger or smaller, the elements within your animation 
resize themselves appropriately, with the new sizes based on percentages. 
For example, if the browser window is maximized at 100%, the images and so 
forth in your animation appear at 100%. If the browser window is shrunk to 
50% of its size, then your images also shrink to 50% of their normal size.
This is a very powerful feature because there is such a wide variety of screen 
sizes these days. You never know whether your audience is viewing your 
animation on a 60-inch display, a 4-inch iPhone, or anything in between. 
Tablets add to the diversity of screen sizes.
Adobe Edge Animate CC handles responsive design by using percentages 
instead of hard coded pixels. This enables you to concentrate on your anima­
tion and not have to worry about how it appears on a myriad of screen sizes.
Counting your multiple publishing options
You have more than one way to publish animations these days — and Adobe 
Edge Animate CC has you covered, offering a multitude of options (as shown 
in Figure 2-6). You can publish your animation as a standalone web page or 
you can embed it in an existing web page. You also find options that allow 
you to export your animation for use in an iBook. You can even publish your 
animation as a static HTML page for use on older web browsers that don’t 
support HTML5 or animations.
	
Figure 2-6: 
The Edge 
Animate

settings.
	

30
Part I: Getting Started with Adobe Edge Animate 
	
The static HTML files are still written with HTML5, and the animations still 
play. The difference is that the elements are not created via JavaScript when 
Edge Animate generates the static file. Instead, they exist in the HTML file. 
This arrangement is good for search engine optimization (SEO): Some search 
engines, when they find elements created dynamically with JavaScript, don’t 
interpret those elements correctly.
Putting your best font forward
You can use a multitude of fonts on the web, and Adobe Edge Animate CC has 
you covered. In addition to a standard default list of fonts that are available 
to you (see Figure 2-7), Edge Animate also enables you to import fonts from 
around the web.
	
Figure 2-7: 
Default font 
list.
	
If none of these fonts satisfy your needs, you can import fonts from many dif­
ferent sources — including Google Web Fonts. You can also use Adobe Edge 
Web Fonts, which is built into Animate. And if you’re familiar with Typekit 
(another free font tool), you can celebrate knowing that tool also works with 
Edge Animate.
	
Keep in mind that Typekit is a tool for the very experienced user: You can also 
use your own font, or one that you purchased, but you have to host the font 
on your web server. To do so, you have to create a style sheet with an 
@font-face rule and place it in the project file folder. Here’s how:

31
 Chapter 2: Discovering Awesome Features and Tools
	
1.	In Edge Animate, in the Web Font dialog box, type this line:
<link href=”mystyle.css” rel=”stylesheet” type=”text/css”>
	
	 Another dialog box appears.
	
2.	In this second dialog box, input the name of the font as specified in 
the style sheet.
If you need more information on how to write the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) 
code for a custom font in the style sheet, you can find it here:
http://blog.freelancer-id.com/2010/06/02/custom-font-for-
all-browsers/
I discuss fonts in more detail in Chapter 12.
Working in your language of choice
Adobe Edge Animate CC is global in many regards — including the language 
you see on menus and panels. If you feel more comfortable working in a lan­
guage other than English, Edge Animate makes it easy for you to change the 
language used in the software to one of many popular languages.
From the Help menu, as shown in Figure 2-8, you can choose from several 
different languages. When you choose a language from the Help menu, that 
language appears in the software. The languages that you can choose from 
include German, English, Spanish, French, and Japanese.
	
Figure 2-8: 
The Change 
Language 
option from 
the Help 
menu.
	
	
If you do pick another language, you have to close and restart Edge Animate 
to see the change take effect. After you select the language that you want, the 
interface does not automatically update, simply close the program and then 
reopen it to see your newly selected language.

Part I: Getting Started with Adobe Edge Animate 
Digging into the Code
Adobe Edge Animate CC makes the creation of animations possible for a 
range of users — from those who consider working with code a challenge to 
experienced developers and engineers who eat code for breakfast. On the 
one hand, you really don’t need any coding skills to create professional ani­
mations with Edge Animate; on the other hand, Edge Animate provides
	
✓	Native HTML5 code, which is very clean — no proprietary or unneces­
sary code. This helps make the code easier to read and understand for 
everyone.
	
✓	A persistent code panel, which gives you access to editing the code by 
hand.
	
✓	JavaScript API (application programming interface), which provides an 
opportunity to learn the details behind the code.
Designers without coding skills can relax knowing they can still create com­
positions without knowing any code at all. Meanwhile, experienced develop­
ers can salute Adobe for providing access to all of the background code.
Working in native HTML
While you work in Edge Animate, the software is constantly creating code 
behind the scenes. While you don’t necessarily have to know any HTML or 
JavaScript to create animations, if you do happen to have some coding skills, 
then you can celebrate — Edge Animate creates very clean HTML code with­
out any proprietary baggage.
	
If you want to get into the code, then consider the HTML file that Edge 
Animate creates as the only file that you may need to open. Edge Animate 
does create several other types of files, including JavaScript files, but those 
files are dense with code. If you are not a developer, then good advice is to 
steer clear of those files.
	
If you’ve already built several websites and don’t want to create your animation 
from scratch, you’re in luck: You don’t have to start over from the beginning. 
A great feature of Edge Animate is that you can import existing HTML files — 
which gives experienced web developers a head start with Edge Animate.
HTML5 is the big thing with web development these days, right along with 
CSS3. If you’re wondering what HTML5 is, the best way to describe it is that 
it’s the future of the web. So, by using Edge Animate, you are placing yourself 

33
 Chapter 2: Discovering Awesome Features and Tools
at the forefront of web technologies. And the best part is, you don’t have to 
know how to code to use it; Edge Animate creates the code for you.
The HTML5 code generated by Edge Animate is clean and contains no extra 
code, as shown here: 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
   <meta http-equiv=”Content-Type” content=”text/html; charset=utf-8”>
   <meta http-equiv=”X-UA-Compatible” content=”IE=Edge”/>
   <title>Untitled</title>
<!--Adobe Edge Runtime-->
    <script type=”text/javascript” charset=”utf-8” src=”Untitled-1_edgePreload.
js”></script>
    <style>
        .edgeLoad-EDGE-15449885 { visibility:hidden; }
    </style>
<!--Adobe Edge Runtime End-->
</head>
<body style=”margin:0;padding:0;”>
   <div id=”Stage” class=”EDGE-15449885”>
   </div>
</body>
</html>
This HTML5 file simplifies animation playback. Here’s why:
	
✓	After you upload the HTML file and the associated files (usually through 
FTP to your web host server), you and your audience can view the ani­
mation in a web browser.
	
✓	You can copy and paste a snippet of the code (shown next) into an 
existing web page, like this:
<!--Adobe Edge Runtime-->
    <script type=”text/javascript” charset=”utf-8” src=”Untitled-1_
edgePreload.js”></script>
    <style>
        .edgeLoad-EDGE-15449885 { visibility:hidden; }
    </style>
<!--Adobe Edge Runtime End-->
	
	If you copy and paste the code snippet just shown into an existing web 
page, you must also upload the associated JavaScript files, images, and 
so on that are part of the file and folder structure that Edge Animate 
creates when you save a composition. You also have to add a div with 
the composition ID into the body tag, as in this example:
<div id=”Stage” class=”EDGE-15449885”></div>.

Coding easily with the 
persistent code panel
You can use Adobe Edge Animate CC without knowing a single bit of code. 
However, if you are a developer who likes to hand-code, you can do so with 
the code window. You have two options when using the code window:
	
✓	You can view the full code. Figure 2-9 shows what you see: all the code 
in the actions file for the particular animation you’re working on. This 
view is extremely helpful; you don’t have to keep clicking back and forth 
between code snippets.
	
	Use the Full Code mode to view and edit your actions file. You can acti­
vate this mode by clicking the Full Code button in the top-right corner of 
the code editor.
	
✓	You can view a specific action’s code. When you have the code window 
open, you see a list of actions on the left side. By clicking one of those 
actions, you can edit the code for only that action (see Figure 2-10).

Pulling in the JavaScript API
An Adobe Edge Animate CC JavaScript API is available for the hardcore 
coders out there. For those who know nothing of JavaScript or writing code, 
don’t fret; massive code-slinging isn’t necessary in order to create anima­
tions. However, if you do like to lift the hood and poke around in the engine, 
then the JavaScript API provides an excellent resource.
You can find the JavaScript API here:
http://www.adobe.com/devnet-docs/edgeanimate/api/current/
index.html
	
API stands for application programming interface and is a common tool that 
programmers use for writing and debugging code. Of course, if you want to 
educate yourself on how to code, looking into the workings of APIs can get you 
started. Keep in mind, however, that APIs generally don’t provide beginner-
level information; they assume that you already know how to code.
The Adobe Edge Animate CC JavaScript API gives you plenty to explore:
	
✓	Adobe Edge Animate CC overview: This section of the API gives you a 
general introduction to the program.
	
✓	Triggers, events, and actions: These features of Edge Animate execute 
your code for you (such as looping) or when your audience interacts 
with different parts of the animation (such as clicking a button).
	
✓	Tools and pointers for creating Symbols (reusable embedded anima­
tions): Especially useful are the Edge Animate Symbols, which are self-
contained behaviors, Timelines, and graphics.

36
Part I: Getting Started with Adobe Edge Animate 
	
✓	JavaScript API: This is the standard JavaScript interface, a handy tool in 
its own right, especially when you like to hand code specific aspects of 
your animation projects.
	
✓	Advanced topics: After you’ve got some coding practice under your 
belt, these topics offer some adventurous directions to explore (for 
example, creating multiple compositions in a page).
Figure 2-12 provides an example of what you can find in the API.

T

his chapter gets you working in Adobe Edge Animate CC. I discuss the 
Welcome screen and all of the informative links to tutorials and the help 
community — and I also show you how to make it all quiet.
I show you how to size the Stage so that it can have a static size or a 
responsive design that sizes the Stage to the size of the browser window.
Chapter 3 also discusses how to import existing web pages. Edge Animate 
can open simple web pages and turn any images into elements — which you 
can then animate or enhance with actions. (For more about elements and 
actions, see Chapter 5.)
Part of working with a new composition is knowing how to add images as 
assets that become part of the composition. This chapter discusses that 
vital bit of knowledge, and shows you how to build up what’s on the Stage by 
drawing elements and adding text boxes.
Starting a New Composition
When you first open Adobe Edge Animate CC, you’re greeted with a very 
informative Welcome screen, as shown in Figure 3-1. The Welcome screen 
has many components to it, which are grouped into three different sections. 

38
Part I: Getting Started with Adobe Edge Animate 
On the left side of the screen you can open an existing file, create a new file, 
create a file from a template, or view a list of recent files.
The remainder of this section summarizes the Welcome screen and then 
branches off to cover two vital techniques:
	
✓	Resizing the Stage: You can size the Stage either by pixel count or by 
percentage.
	
✓	Importing an existing web page: You can open existing HTML files.
Also on the Welcome screen, down in the bottom-left corner, there are two 
little icons. You will most likely immediately recognize both of them. The 
Facebook icon takes you directly to the Edge Animate Facebook page; the 
Twitter icon connects you to the Edge Animate Twitter feed.
In the top-middle of the Welcome screen, you can find a menu that consists of
	
✓	What’s New: This section provides a list of all the latest features, addi­
tions, and updates since the last release.
	
✓	Getting Started: The Getting Started section of the Welcome screen 
shows several boxes in the main part of the screen. From here, you can 
walk through several tutorials and examples that are built directly into 
Edge Animate (see Figure 3-1).	
	
✓	Resources: The Resources section of the Welcome screen provides a list 
of links that you can click for additional help, tutorials, video, and FAQs 
from the community as shown in Figure 3-2. From the Resources section, 
you can also view and download sample projects as well as access the 
JavaScript API.
	
✓	Quiet: If you prefer a nice, quiet space from which to work when 
you open Edge Animate, all you have to do is click Quiet from the 
Welcome screen. Doing so removes the tutorials and lists that you 
may normally see.
	
Edge Animate remembers whichever Welcome screen option you choose. If 
you close the software with Quiet selected, then the next time you open Edge 
Animate, you see the Quiet Welcome screen. The same holds true if you close 
the program with any of the other options selected.
	
An Internet connection is required to gain access to many of the features 
listed on the Welcome screen.

clutter.
	
The first time that you open Edge Animate, you may want to start a brand-
new composition. To do that, simply click the Create New icon from the left 
side of the screen (refer to Figure 3-1). Later, after you have some saved 
projects, you can click either Open File or Recent Files to open your existing 
compositions.
When you click Create New, Edge Animate presents a brand-new blank Stage 
from which you can start your work.
Resizing the Stage
The Stage is where you will place your elements, such as images, text, and 
drawn objects. The Stage is a live HTML window, which means that what you 
see on the screen, is what your audience sees when they view and interact 
with your composition. You can size the Stage a couple different ways:
	
✓	Pixels: Adobe Edge Animate CC enables you to set the Stage to remain a 
specific size no matter the size of the browser window.
	
✓	Percentage: For those who prefer a more responsive web design.
	
✓	Testing responsive web design: You may want to change the back­
ground color of the Stage to test the responsiveness of your design. (I go 
into detail on how to do this test in the next couple of sections.)
Sizing your Stage by pixel values
Most likely one of the first steps you’ll want to take is to size your Stage 
properly. If you plan to insert your animation into an existing web page, first 
determine how much space you want your animation to take up on that page, 
and then size the Stage accordingly.

41
 Chapter 3: Working with a New Composition
To resize the Stage, click the orange numbers in the Stage section of the 
Properties panel — in the far-left column near the top of the screen — as 
shown in Figure 3-4. Clicking the width or height numbers allows you to type 
in the exact dimensions (in pixels) that you want your Stage to have.
	
If you don’t want to type in the numbers, Edge Animate gives you an alternative 
method for resizing the Stage: Simply place your cursor over one of the orange 
numbers. When the cursor turns into a double arrow (as shown in Figure 3-4), 
you can click and drag to increase or decrease the size of the Stage.
Sizing your Stage by percentage of screen size
If you want to create an animation that doesn’t have to fit any specific dimen­
sion, then you should switch from pixels (px) to percentage (%), by clicking 
the toggle (see Figure 3-5). This is one step to creating a responsive web 
design. When you size the Stage by screen percentage instead of by pixel 
values, the Stage sizes itself according to the size of the parent element.
	
One example of a parent element can be the browser window itself — if the 
animation is a standalone web page. However, if the animation is one part of 
a web page, then the parent element can be a div element within which the 
animation is nested.
	
Figure 3-4: 
Resizing the 
Stage by 
dimensions 
(in pixels).
	

42
Part I: Getting Started with Adobe Edge Animate 
	
Figure 3-5: 
Sizing the 
Stage by 
percentage 
of screen.
	
To have your Stage fill the entire browser window, set the Stage width 
and height to 100%, as shown in Figure 3-6. To have your Stage fill half the 
browser window, set the Stage to 50%; and so on, depending on how much of 
the browser window you want your animation to occupy.
By default, the background of the Stage is white. Therefore you won’t see any 
difference in the Stage when you switch between px and %.
	
To test the difference between using px and % for Stage size, change the back­
ground color of the Stage to something other than white, such as red. Then 
experiment with different percentages and px dimensions to see the different 
effects.
To change the background color of the Stage (as shown in Figure 3-6), click 
the white square to bring up a color picker.
	
You can tell Edge Animate to keep the width and height proportions the same 
by clicking the Link Width and Height icon (highlighted in Figure 3-7). By 
default, the Link Width and Height icon is turned off; with that default in effect, 
Edge Animate will not keep the width (or height) in the same proportion when 
you resize.

Importing HTML
Adobe Edge Animate CC is very HTML-friendly. If you have an existing — 
albeit a very basic — HTML web page that you want to animate, then just 
click Open File from the Welcome screen to start working with it.

44
Part I: Getting Started with Adobe Edge Animate 
	
Make sure all images and associated files are in the same folder as the htm file 
when you open it — or in a nested folder in the htm file. Otherwise they won’t 
appear on the Stage.
When you’re importing existing HTML, keep in mind the following:
	
✓	Edge Animate may not like your CSS files
	
✓	Images in your htm file appear in the Library panel.
	
✓	Text is imported as an element.
Possible issues with CSS files
Keep in mind that the simpler the HTML page is that you import, the easier it 
is for Edge Animate to open it.
	
If you do have trouble opening your htm file, try removing all associated CSS 
files. You may fret at the loss of that earlier work, but keep in mind that you 
can quickly replace all of that design work with Edge Animate.
If you open an existing HTML file with menus and such, you can animate 
the menus and elements but you can’t reformat the color and some other 
aspects. The reason for this is that Edge Animate only allows animation 
sequences for imported HTML objects so as not to fight with any CSS styl­
ing you may have already applied. It can get a bit messy when you apply two 
styles to an element, which can lead to unexpected results.
Images appear in the Library panel
If the HTML page that you’re importing contains images, then Edge Animate 
imports those images into the Library panel as an asset (see Figure 3-8).
	
Figure 3-8: 
Here the 
original 
Edge 
Animate 
icon was 
imported 
as an asset 
into the 
Library 
panel.	

45
 Chapter 3: Working with a New Composition
You can now treat the imported images as elements that you can animate or 
add interactive attributes; you can make the image move about the screen 
and/or make the image a link. For more information on the Library panel, see 
Chapter 12.
Text is imported as an element
When you import an HTML file with text, Animate imports that text as an ele­
ment. You can select the text elements and animate them or add actions to 
them; however, you can’t edit the text.
If the original HTML file used H1 or paragraph tags for text, then Animate rec­
ognizes those attributes and displays them in the Elements panel, as shown 
in Figure 3-9.
	
Figure 3-9: 
Text is 
imported as 
an element.
	
Working with Templates
Templates were introduced in Edge Animate 2.0. This feature removes the 
necessity of reinventing the wheel every time you want to start a new compo­
sition. Sure, you could always start a new composition from a saved file, but 
Templates enable you to start a new project that already contains attributes 
and elements that you want to use without having to rewrite an existing 
saved file. Templates are very useful when you want to create several similar 
compositions and you want to start animating right away — without setting 
up your preferences from a brand-new composition or having to remove or 
swap out elements from a saved file. You can find the Templates from the 
main menu under File (as shown in Figure 3-10).
From the File menu, you can
	
✓	Create from Template: Here’s where you start a new composition 
from a saved Template, to do this, you must first save a Template and 
then import that Template into Animate. When you click Create from 
Template, the Template Viewer opens and you see thumbnails of your 
imported Templates (as shown in Figure 3-11). Then you choose the 
Template you want to work with.

Templates 
from the File 
menu.
	
	
Figure 3-11: 
Choose a 
Template 
from the 
Template 
Viewer.
	
	
✓	Save As Template: this saves your current composition as a Template. 
Saved Templates include anything and everything in your composition. 
This includes Symbols, images, text, fonts and custom amendments you 
made including the size of the Stage. When you click Save As Template, 
and then choose a spot to save the file, Animate creates an antmple 
file. When you save a Template, you are then prompted to import that 
Template. I suggest you do that, so you can select it later when you 
choose Create from Template.

47
 Chapter 3: Working with a New Composition
	
If you try to open an antmple file from your file directory and that file has 
already been imported, you’ll get this message: 
The Animate Template file contains a template that is already imported. 
Overwrite the existing template?
You can then choose Yes or No. If you try to open an antmple file from your 
file directory that has not already been imported, then Edge Animate imports 
that Template for you. You can then open that template by clicking Create 
from Template.
	
If you decide you no longer want a particular Template to appear in the 
Template Viewer, click the garbage can from the Template Viewer when you 
hover over a particular Template thumbnail, as shown in Figure 3-12.
	
Figure 3-12: 
Delete 
unwanted 
Templates.
	
	
When you delete a Template, the saved Template file remains on your hard 
drive (or in the specific file directory to which you originally saved it). 
Deleting a Template simply removes it from Edge Animate; you can no longer 
choose it from the Template Viewer.

Drawing and Editing Elements, Importing 
Images, and Writing Text
Adobe Edge Animate CC provides drawing tools so that you can create rect­
angles, rounded rectangles, and ellipses on the Stage — which then become 
elements that you can animate and add actions to. The same is true for 
importing images and writing text. Figure 3-13 shows where you can find the 
drawing tools directly under the main menu.
	
Figure 3-13: 
Drawing 
tools.
	
Adobe Edge Animate CC provides a range of tools you can use to create 
elements:
	
✓	Drawing tools: You can draw rectangles, rounded rectangles, and 
ellipses (including circles).
	
✓	Editing the corners: If you want to edit the roundness of your corners, 
Edge Animate provides ways to make it happen.
	
✓	Importing images: As a designer, you most likely have some choice 
images that you want to animate. Now you can.
	
✓	Writing text: There is a very good chance that you want to add some 
text to your composition. Animate makes that task easy for you.
Drawing rectangles
Drawing a rectangle is as easy as clicking the Rectangle tool and then clicking 
and dragging inside the Stage.
When you animate the rectangles you draw, they become elements on the 
Stage. Then you can turn them into Symbols, assign them actions and trig­
gers, and so on.
	
When you draw an element on the Stage (such as a rectangle) and other 
elements are already on the Stage, Edge Animate automatically shows pink 
guidelines (see Figure 3-14). These guidelines can help you create equal-size 
elements and align your elements evenly with each other.

 Chapter 3: Working with a New Composition

Use the 
guidelines 
to help 
create

elements.
	
Creating rounded rectangles
The Rounded Rectangle tool is similar to the Rectangle tool, except the 
corners are round instead of square.
You can affect how round the corners are by experimenting with the way you 
click and drag when you draw a rounded rectangle. For example, you can 
draw a circle, a pill shape, or a square with slightly round corners — and just 
about anything in between. Figure 3-15 shows some of the different shapes 
you can draw with the Rounded Rectangle tool.
	
Figure 3-15: 
Drawing 
different 
shapes with

Rectangle 
tool.
	
Drawing ellipses
The Ellipses tool makes it easy to draw circles. Just select the Ellipses tool 
(as highlighted in Figure 3-13), and then click and drag to draw a shape with 
rounded corners. Figure 3-16 shows a perfect circle element.
	
To draw a perfect circle, hold down Shift while you click and drag. This key­
press forces the proportions of the elements to retain the circle shape no 
matter how you click and drag.

fect circle

Editing the Corners of Elements
No matter what type of element you draw — rectangle, rounded rectangle, or 
ellipse, or circle — you can then select it and edit each corner (if it has cor­
ners) independently. To do so from the Properties panel, find Corners, and 
then (if necessary) click the white arrow to display its attribute settings.
Figure 3-17 shows the Corners attributes in the Properties panel. In this 
example, you can edit eight different points on the element, and the top-right 
corner is set to 0 so the corners are straight. The other corners are set to 50 
so that the corners are round.
	
Figure 3-17: 
Use the 
Corners 
attributes 
in the 
Properties 
panel to edit 
corners.
	
	
To edit all the corners at once, select 1, edit the orange number on the right, 
and then press Enter. All the corners become uniform, as shown in Figure 3-18.

Importing images
You can import images from the menu bar; click File➪Import. A navigation 
window opens, prompting you to select an image. Navigate to where you 
saved your image, then select the image, and finally choose Open from the 
navigation window.
	
Adobe Edge Animate CC supports drag and drop. Instead of clicking through 
the File menu, you can drag an image from your desktop directly onto the 
Stage.
When you have an image in your composition, several new options appear in 
the Properties panel, as shown in Figure 3-19.
	
Figure 3-19: 
New options

Properties 
panel.
	

52
Part I: Getting Started with Adobe Edge Animate 
Writing text
Adding text to your Edge Animate project is a matter of a few clicks and 
typing. And the best part is that the text you type is considered selectable 
type while it’s viewed in a browser. Edge Animate will not convert your 
text into an image for the final output — which means search engines can 
parse your text and index it for search results. Ultimately, using text in Edge 
Animate helps — or at least doesn’t hurt — your website’s SEO (search 
engine optimization).
	
Adobe Edge Animate CC is considered SEO-friendly; it places text in the 
JavaScript file as text, not as an image of text. Therefore, search engines can 
find any text that you type into Edge Animate and use in the final animation 
placed on your site.
To insert text into your Edge Animate composition, click the Text tool, which is 
located directly under the main menu bar in the top-left corner (see Figure 3-20).
	
Figure 3-20: 
Selecting 
the Text 
tool.
	
With the Text tool selected, click and drag over the Stage. You see a thin, 
blue rectangle appear as you click and drag. When you release the left mouse 
button, you also see a gray text box with a blinking cursor (as shown in 
Figure 3-21).

▶	Fine-tuning the Timeline view to match your preferences
T

he Adobe Edge Animate CC Timeline is a crucial part of the software. The 
Timeline is where you determine when different actions take place and 
which elements are affected. You can find the Timeline at the bottom of the 
screen. This chapter covers many elements of the Timeline, including the 
finer details — including the creation of animation sequences, also known as 
transitions.
Controlling the Timeline
The Timeline is located at the bottom of the interface. It has Play controls such 
as Play, Rewind, Fast Forward, and Return to Last Play Position (see Figure 4-1).
The Play controls include the basics and one that proves extremely convenient:
	
✓	Play, Rewind, and Fast Forward: These are the basic controls you’ll 
find on any kind of media player, and Adobe Edge Animate CC has them 
for your use.
	
✓	Return to Last Play Position: Sometimes you don’t want to return to the 
beginning of an animation when you finish watching it. That’s especially 
true when your animation starts to get long and (say) you have a par­
ticular section that you want to tweak. This control gets you back to the 
point at which you last stopped playing the animation, as often as you 
like, with no fuss.

56
Part II: Adopting Tools and Techniques 
Play, Rewind, and Fast Forward
When you have your animation ready to test or view, you can click Play 
to watch the animation play out on the Stage. Likewise, you can click Fast 
Forward or Rewind to (respectively) advance the animation quickly or back it 
up just as fast.
The Return to Last Play Position will return to the point in the Timeline to 
where you left the Pin.
	
Figure 4-1: 
The Play 
controls 
on the 
Timeline.
	
	
You can also press the spacebar on your keyboard to play the animation. The 
animation will play in its entirety if the Playhead (explained in detail later in 
this chapter) is at the end of the Timeline. You can also watch your animation 
unfold simply by clicking and dragging the Playhead back and forth over the 
Timeline.
Return to Last Play Position
By default, the Return to Last Play Position icon is grayed out, because the 
last play position was at the beginning of the Timeline. When you start to 
create your composition, you can move the Playhead further out along the 
Timeline. Doing that activates the Return to Last Play Position button as 
shown in Figure 4-2.
	
Figure 4-2: 
The Return 
to Last Play 
Position 
and the 
Playhead.
	

57
 Chapter 4: Using the Timeline for the First Time
When you click the Return to Last Play Position after you play the compo­
sition, Edge Animate brings you back to where the Playhead was on the 
Timeline, as opposed to bringing you all the way back to the beginning.
Toggling the Timeline Modes
Directly after the Play controls are another set of tools where you can set the 
Keyframes mode, set the Auto-Transition mode, and you can also toggle the 
Pin and set the Easing attribute. These tools are shown in Figure 4-3.
	
Figure 4-3: 
Keyframe 
tools are 
to the right 
of the Play 
controls.
	
Adobe Edge Animate CC uses keyframes for animations. Keyframes appear 
as white diamonds in the Timeline. The green horizontal bars in Figure 4-2 
represent the transitions (animation sequences) between keyframes for a 
rectangle element that moves from the left corner to the bottom-right corner 
over a period of 5 seconds. That’s a lot of information, and you can find it all 
within the Timeline and keyframe.
Adobe Edge Animate CC contains several toggle modes within the Timeline 
area:
	
✓	Keyframes: You can toggle them on or off if you want or don’t want Edge 
Animate to create keyframes automatically for you while you’re creating 
your composition.
	
✓	Auto-Transition: You can toggle this feature on or off if you want or 
don’t want Edge Animate to create animation sequences automatically 
when you move elements around the Stage.
	
✓	Playhead and Pin: When it comes time to start animating, make sure 
the Pin is toggled on, otherwise Edge Animate won’t create animation 
sequences.
	
✓	Easing: You may not necessarily call this a toggle, but you can choose 
your preferred Easing attributes; your choices affect the way Edge 
Animate brings your elements to life.

58
Part II: Adopting Tools and Techniques 
Keyframes modes
To create keyframes automatically, you must first activate keyframes by 
clicking the red Stopwatch icon. By default, when you first start a new anima­
tion, the Stopwatch is red but has gray lines running through it (as shown in 
Figure 4-4).
	
Figure 4-4: 
Here the 
default state 
of the Auto-
Keyframe 
mode is 
disengaged.
	
You’ll want the Stopwatch to appear red as you create your composition so 
that Edge Animate automatically creates keyframes for you. Simply click the 
Stopwatch to activate Auto-Keyframes and turn the Stopwatch red (as shown 
in Figure 4-5).
	
When the Stopwatch is disengaged, you don’t have to click the Stopwatch to 
enable it. Simply toggle the Pin and Auto-Keyframes will become enabled. You 
can learn more about toggling the Pin and moving the Playhead in the follow­
ing sections.
	
Figure 4-5: 
Here Auto-
Keyframes 
are enabled.
	
If you click the Stopwatch and it dims to gray instead of red, then you’ll need 
to manually insert your keyframes.
	
If you want to arrange elements on the Stage without triggering keyframes, 
then make sure the Stopwatch is dimmed by clicking it, as shown in Figure 4-6. 
When the Stopwatch is gray, that means Auto-Keyframes are disabled.

 Chapter 4: Using the Timeline for the First Time
	
Figure 4-6: 
Auto-
Keyframes 
are disabled 
when the 
Stopwatch 
is gray.
	
Auto-Transition mode
By turning Auto-Transition mode on or off, you toggle the capability to create 
smooth transitions between keyframes. Transitions are the animations that 
you create to show (for example) an element moving from left to right on the 
Stage (transitions are also referred to as animation sequences). When you 
create a new file, the Auto-Transition mode is enabled for you (as shown in 
Figure 4-7). You’ll also see a colored arrow between the Pin and the Playhead. 
This orange-colored bar-with-arrows is discussed in detail later in this chap­
ter, in the “Animating forward” and “Animating backward” sections.
	
Figure 4-7: 
Here the 
default state 
for Auto-
Transition 
mode is 
enabled.
	
When Auto-Transition mode is turned on, Edge Animate creates an animation 
effect when you move elements around the Stage, provided you’ve toggled 
the Pin and Playhead as outlined in the next few sections.
	
You’ll know when you’ve created an animation: The color-coded bars appear 
between the keyframes, as shown in Figure 4-2.
If you click the Auto-Transition icon, it dims, and Edge Animate will not 
create an animated sequence. Instead, Edge Animate only inserts the key­
frame diamonds; you won’t see the colored bars (see Figure 4-8).

If you want animation sequences to appear when you move elements around 
the Stage, make sure that the Stopwatch icon is red and the Auto-Transition 
mode is enabled. If you want to move elements around on the Stage without 
creating keyframes or animation sequences, then disable both the Stopwatch 
and the Auto-Transition icon. You also have to toggle the Pin, as discussed 
next.
Toggling the Pin
When you start creating animation sequences, you need to toggle the Pin. 
When you first start a new composition, the Pin is turned off, as shown in 
Figure 4-9. In this state, you can’t create animation sequences.
	
Figure 4-9: 
Here the 
default state 
of the Pin is 
turned off.
	
To create animation sequences, you turn on the Stopwatch, make sure the 
Auto-Transition mode is on, and then click the Pin icon. The Pin icon acti­
vates (as shown in Figure 4-10) and turns light blue.

Pin to 
activate it.

 Chapter 4: Using the Timeline for the First Time
With the Pin turned on, you can now move it up and down the Timeline to 
determine where and for how long you want an animation sequence to last. 
You can find more details in the following sections.
Easing tool
The Easing tool is the last icon right before the Timeline. You can use the 
Easing tool to affect how animations play. To add Easing to an element, select 
an element’s transition from the Timeline, and then select an attribute from 
the Easing menu (as shown in Figure 4-11).
For example, if you want your element to bounce like a ball, choose Ease Out 
from the left column, and then choose Bounce in the right column.
The default setting for Easing is Linear, which has no effect on your elements. 
If you change Easing from Linear to something else, then all new elements 
that you create will default to this new Easing attribute. You can have dif­
ferent Easing attributes for each element on the Stage. To edit a particular 
element’s Easing attribute, you must select that element’s transition from the 
Timeline.
	
If you’re mathematically inclined, you’ll appreciate the graph on the far right, 
which shows the effects of the Easing attributes.
	
Figure 4-11: 
The Easing 
attributes.
	
The Playhead and the Pin
The Playhead and the Pin are located along the time markers in the Timeline. 
You’ll use them for a couple of different tasks. The first task is to determine 
the points in time where you want an animation to start and end. The second 
task is to tell Edge Animate where you want to start viewing your animation 
when you click Play.

62
Part II: Adopting Tools and Techniques 
The Pin is the blue icon on top; the Playhead is the yellow chevron below it.
When you’re ready to start animating, you’ll want to drag either the Pin or 
the Playhead down the length of the Timeline. Dragging either the Pin or the 
Playhead down the Timeline, as shown in Figure 4-12, determines whether 
your animation plays forward or backward. This is discussed in more detail 
in the following sections.
	
Figure 4-12: 
The 
Playhead 
and the Pin.	
Working with Keyframes and 
Animation Sequences
It’s important to get a handle on working with keyframes and animation 
sequences so you can create them and edit them to do what you want. The 
following sections introduce you to all the parts of Edge Animate that you 
need for creating keyframes and animation sequences. Here’s where you 
actually create those keyframes and animation sequences — which boils 
down to getting familiar with these processes:
	
✓	Creating keyframes: When you start animating, depending on how you 
set the Pin and the Playhead, you can create transitions that play either 
forward or backward, depending on how you create them.
	
✓	Selecting keyframes: After you create keyframes, you can select them 
so that you can edit them.
	
✓	Editing keyframes: After creating a keyframe, and then selecting it, you 
can edit it.
	
✓	Copying and pasting keyframes: You can copy and paste the keyframes 
you want to reuse. This should save you plenty of time; you don’t have 
to recreate the same keyframe over and over for similar animation 
sequences.
Creating sequences
To create a keyframe and an animation sequence (transitions), follow these 
steps.

63
 Chapter 4: Using the Timeline for the First Time
	
1.	Place an element on the Stage with the drawing tools or by importing 
an image.
	
2.	Toggle the Pin so that it turns light blue.
	
3.	Click and drag either the Pin or the Playhead down the Timeline.
	
	 The differences between moving the Pin and moving the Playhead are 
described later in this section.
	
	 The amount of space that separates the Pin from the Playhead deter­
mines the length of time the animation takes to play out.
	
4.	Click and drag the element around the Stage, for example, move the 
element from the top-left corner down to the bottom-right corner.
	
	 Edge Animate adds color-coded bars to the Timeline.
To preview your animation, click Play or press the spacebar.
Animating forward
Where you place the Pin and the Playhead on the Timeline affects your 
animation sequence. For example, you may be scratching your head and 
wondering why, when you play your animation, the element goes from the 
bottom-right corner up to the top-left corner instead of the other way around.
To animate forward — that is, to have the animation sequence play in the 
same direction in which you moved the elements on the Stage — you must 
move the Playhead farther down the Timeline than the Pin so that you see a 
yellow bar-with-arrows (as shown in Figure 4-13).
	
Figure 4-13: 
Animating 
forward by 
moving the 
Playhead 
down the 
timeline.
	
Animating backward
If you want your animation to appear in a backward sequence relative to the 
direction in which you move the element on the Stage, then move the Pin far­
ther down the Timeline than the Playhead: You see a blue bar-with-arrows, as 
shown in Figure 4-14.

Adobe Edge Animate CC is full of keyboard shortcuts. One of them is Shift+P, 
which reverses the direction of your timespan from blue to orange (or vice 
versa). This comes in useful when you realize you want to play an animation 
sequence in the opposite direction.
Animating with Motion Paths
Motion Paths enable you to create animation sequences that follow a curved 
path, or a loop, such as a bird in flight or an image that dances across the 
stage. Animate provides plenty of options to working with Motion Paths, as 
described in the following sections. You can toggle Motion Paths off or on 
from the Properties panel as shown in Figure 4-15 (be sure to select an 
element on the Stage so you can see the Motion Path property).
	
Toggle the Auto-Orient option so that the element’s rotation follows the 
Motion Path. If you leave Auto-Orient off, then the element’s rotation is not 
affected by the Motion Path.
	
Use the Layout Defaults from the toolbar to set Motion Paths as a default for 
all new elements that you add to the Stage (see Figure 4-16). When you change 
the Layout Defaults, the settings for all previously existing elements are not 
affected. 
With Motion Paths toggled on, when you create an animation sequence 
for an element, you will see a thin blue line with arrows at each end; these 
arrows represent the direction of the element’s movement (see Figure 4-17). 
This blue line indicates the path the element travels during the animation. 
Remember to toggle the Pin and set the Playhead to create an animation 
sequence.

To move a Motion Path around the Stage without adding a new anchor point, 
hover the mouse over the thin blue line (at a place in the line with no anchor 
points), hold down Cmd or Ctrl, and then drag with the mouse.

The thin 
blue line

Path for the

Adding an anchor point
When you first draw a Motion Path (dragging an element across the Stage 
with the Pin toggled), Animate creates a straight path. To add curves to 
your path, you must insert anchor points. To add an anchor point, hover the 
mouse over the thin blue line until you see the pen tool as shown in Figure 4-18.
	
Figure 4-18: 
The pen tool 
indicates 
that you 
can edit 
the Motion 
Path.
	
With the pen tool showing, click and drag with your mouse to insert an 
anchor point and to add a curve to the Motion Path. This action also creates 
a Bézier handle. You can use the Bézier handle to further manipulate the 
curve of the Motion Path by clicking and dragging those points, as shown in 
Figure 4-19.

67

paths can

perfect 
curve.
	
	
To delete, or remove an anchor point, hover on the existing anchor and use 
the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Click for the PC or Cmd+Click for a Mac.
Creating a sharp point instead of a curved path
While curved paths are pretty awesome, 90 degree angles can look pretty 
sharp as well (pun intended). To create a sharp angle in your Motion Path, 
you have to remove the Bezier handle from the anchor point. To remove 
the Bezier handle, position the mouse over the Bezier handle and use the 
keyboard shortcut Alt+Click (Option+Click for Mac). When you do that, 
the Bezier handle is removed from the Motion Path and the anchor point 
becomes a sharp angle as shown in Figure 4-20. 
	
Figure 4-20: 
A Motion 
Path with a 
sharp angle.
	
Keyframes and Easing with Motion Paths
You can split up a Motion Path to have more than one keyframe. The key­
frame diamonds in the Timeline represent different Motion Paths (also known 
as animation sequences or transitions). To add a keyframe to a Motion Path, 
place the Playhead and Pin in the portion of the Timeline where you want to 
add the keyframe, then simply click the diamond from the Timeline next to 
the transition you want to add a keyframe to as shown in Figure 4-21.

Figure 4-21: 
Add key-
frames to a 
Motion Path 
to create 
separate 
animation 
sequences.
	
Breaking a single Motion Path into more than one transition can be useful. 
For example, you can add one Easing attribute to the first keyframe of the 
path and have a different Easing attribute assigned to the second part. To do 
that, select the first keyframe transition from the Timeline (see Figure 4-22) 
and then add an Easing attribute to it (see Chapter 17 for more details on 
Easing). Then select the second Motion Path sequence and add a different 
Easing attribute. You can then preview the entire animation sequence on the 
Stage (press the Space Bar to preview on the Stage or press Ctrl+Return to 
preview in a browser).

Splitting and joining Motion Paths
Motion paths are fully editable. Meaning you can bend and twist them to your 
will as well as splitting them apart and putting them back together. 
www.allitebooks.com

69
 Chapter 4: Using the Timeline for the First Time
To split a Motion Path, you have to first add a keyframe diamond to the ani­
mation sequence as discussed in the last section. Adding the keyframe to 
the path creates two separate Motion Paths that happen to be connected. 
To split these two Motion Paths, hover the mouse pointer over the middle 
arrow that was created when you added the keyframe diamond (as indicated 
in Figure 4-22), and then Ctrl+Click (Cmd+Click) and drag to separate the 
two Motion Paths. Figure 4-23 shows the saw cursor that appears when you 
Ctrl+Click over an arrow.
To join two Motion Paths together, simply click an end arrow and drag it over 
to the other Motion Path’s end arrow until they snap together.
	
Figure 4-23: 
Separate 
the Motion 
Paths when 
you see the 
saw icon. 
	
Don’t be alarmed if you see the element attached to only one of the separated 
paths. If you move the Playhead up and down the Timeline, you’ll see that the 
element is still attached to both Motion Paths. Previewing the animation also 
shows that the element is still associated to both of the Motion Paths. It’s 
just that one of the Motion Paths will appear as if it doesn’t have the element 
simply based on where the Playhead is on the Timeline.
If you split a Motion Path and place one segment on the far side of the Stage 
and the other path on the opposite side of the Stage, then you’ll see your 
element follow the first path and then jump to the second path. To exag­
gerate this effect, try adding time in the Timeline between when the first 
Motion Path ends and the second starts. To separate the keyframe diamonds 
(and the animation sequence), place the cursor over the second animation 
sequence and then click and drag down the Timeline (see the next two sec­
tions on selecting sequences and editing sequences for more information). 
See Figure 4-24 as an example.

Paths

You cannot set Motion Paths to use percentage-based layouts to create a 
responsive layout (see Chapter 21 on how to build a responsive web design). 
As a work-around, you can nest your Motion Path element inside a group, 
parent, or Symbol and then set the parent to use percentage based positioning 
(see Chapter 11 for nesting elements, Chapter 21 for layout preferences and 
layout defaults, and Chapter 12 for information on Symbols). You can also
use this nesting method to set the Motion Path relative to top, right, bottom, 
and left. 
	
Experiment with the Transform Origin point when animating with Motion 
Paths. The element’s travel along the Motion Path is based on the origin point, 
which doesn’t necessarily have to be the center of the element itself. For more 
information on origin points and the Transform tool, see Chapter 7. 
Selecting sequences
After you create keyframes and animation sequences, you may want to select 
them so you can edit them. You have several ways you can select keyframes.
	
✓	Place the cursor over the top bar (also called the rollup bar). When the 
cursor turns to the shape of a hand, as shown in Figure 4-25, you can 
click to select all associated animation sequences.
	
✓	Select keyframes by clicking and dragging with the mouse.
	
	You can select several keyframes at once.
	
✓	Hold the Shift key down while clicking different keyframes to select more 
than one at a time.

Edge Animate also allows you to select just one animation sequence by 
clicking a specific colored bar.
You can edit animation sequences and keyframes after you’ve selected them.
Editing sequences
Adobe Edge Animate CC provides an easy means to not only move keyframes 
and animation sequences, but you can shorten or lengthen them as well.
Moving sequences
To move keyframe and animation sequences either up or down the Timeline, 
simply select the color-coded bar and then drag it while keeping the left 
mouse button depressed.
You can move multiple keyframes in the same manner. To select more than 
one keyframe at a time, hold the Shift key down while clicking different 
keyframes.
Lengthening or shortening sequences
Not only can you move where the keyframe appears in the Timeline, you can 
also lengthen or shorten the keyframe so that the animation takes a longer or 
shorter time to play.
To lengthen the keyframe, move the mouse cursor to either end of the key­
frame until the cursor turns into a double-arrowed line (see Figure 4-26). 
Then simply click and drag.

Copying and pasting keyframes 
and sequences
Adobe Edge Animate CC allows you to copy and paste keyframes and anima­
tion sequences. This makes it easy to create multiple instances of the same 
animation.
To copy a keyframe, simply select it and then use Ctrl+C. Then place your 
Playhead at the point in the Timeline at which you want to paste the key­
frame. Finally, use Ctrl+V to paste in the keyframe.
	
Before you paste in the keyframe you copied, make sure the Playhead is 
located at the point in the Timeline where you want it to appear. Otherwise 
you might paste the keyframe into a section of the Timeline that isn’t where 
you want it. The keyframe that you’re pasting into the Timeline will appear 
wherever the Playhead is located.
Finer Details of the Timeline 
and Stage Controls
Edge Animate offers many ways to configure the Timeline and Stage; you can 
adjust them to your own liking. This includes an easy way to center the Stage, 
magnify the Stage, filter elements, and turn Timeline snapping on or off.
The finer controls for the Stage and Timeline include these:
	
✓	Centering the Stage: If you start moving, adjusting, resizing, and so 
forth, you may need to re-center the Stage for better viewing.
	
✓	Magnifying the Stage: For those times you want to see every last pixel of 
your elements.

73
 Chapter 4: Using the Timeline for the First Time
	
✓	The Playhead and Pin timestamp: Edge Animate provides more than 
one way to move the Playhead and Pin up and down the Timeline.
	
✓	Filtering elements: Sometimes you only want to see certain elements.
	
✓	Timeline snapping: Do you like your elements to snap into a precise 
place on the Timeline or do you prefer more freedom?
	
✓	Configuring the grid view: You can set the grid view to your preference 
so that you either see a grid or you don’t.
	
✓	Viewing more or less of the Timeline: Sometimes you may want to see 
the entire Timeline for your composition; sometimes you may want to 
zoom in.
	
✓	Adding more time: If you run out of time, you can always add more!
	
You might be wondering how Edge Animate determines the vertical order in 
which elements appear in the Timeline. It all depends on how the elements 
are arranged. The element that is most in front (appears on top of all other 
elements) is the first element listed in the Timeline. The element that is most 
in back (appears behind all other elements) is the last element listed in the 
Timeline. 
Stage controls
There are a couple of controls for the Stage that enable you to center it and 
magnify it.
	
✓	Centering the Stage: If, for some reason, the Stage has gone off-kilter 
on you and you want a one-click solution to re-center the Stage on your 
screen, then simply click the Center the Stage icon. This icon is located 
in the bottom-left corner of the Stage (as shown in Figure 4-27).
	
✓	Magnifying the Stage: If you want to zoom in on the Stage, you can use 
the magnification tool (as shown in Figure 4-28). You can either click the 
orange number and type in a specific zoom level or place your mouse 
pointer over the number and then click and drag to adjust.

Timeline controls
Adobe Edge Animate CC provides several tools to help you configure the 
Timeline so that it appears just the way you want.
	
✓	Playhead and Pin stamp: Provides a means to show you where the 
Playhead is in the Timeline and the length of time for the animation 
sequence. The Playhead is represented by the yellow numbers on the 
left, and the Pin is represented by the blue numbers on the right (see 
Figure 4-29). You can place your cursor over these numbers and then 
click and drag to change the location of the Playhead and Pin on the 
Timeline.
	
Figure 4-29: 
Playhead 
and Pin 
stamp.
	
	
✓	Filtering elements: Edge Animate provides a way for you to see only the 
elements with animation sequences or to see all of the elements at once. 
This doesn’t affect what you see on the Stage, but it does affect what you 
see in the Timeline. In Figure 4-30, on the left, the filtering is turned off, 
and you see all of the elements; on the right, filtering is turned on, and 
you see only the animated elements. The Filter control is identified.
	
Figure 4-30: 
Filtering 
elements.
	

75
 Chapter 4: Using the Timeline for the First Time
	
✓	Configuring the grid view: If you want to see precise measurements in 
the Timeline — anywhere from a full second to a 30th of a second — you 
can set that view (as shown in Figure 4-31); you can pull up your choices 
and toggle the grid view on or off.
	
Figure 4-31: 
Configuring 
the grid 
view.
	
	
✓	Timeline snapping: If you choose to turn on the grid view, then you can 
have the Pin and Playhead snap to the grid by turning on Timeline snap­
ping (as shown in Figure 4-32).
	
Figure 4-32: 
Toggling 
Timeline 
snapping.
	
	
✓	Magnification scrollbar: You can view more or less of the Timeline by 
scrolling the magnification bar (as shown in Figure 4-33). You can click 
to view the entire Timeline, click to either zoom the magnification in or 
out, or click and drag the icon on the scrollbar.

76
Part II: Adopting Tools and Techniques 
	
✓	Inserting more time into the Timeline: You can add more time into 
your Timeline at any point while you’re designing your composition. 
From the main menu, click Timeline and then choose Insert Time, which 
is about halfway down the menu. When you do that, a dialog box opens 
(as shown in Figure 4-34).

Chapter 5
Working with Triggers, Actions, 
Labels, and Cursors
In This Chapter
▶	Adding interaction to your composition with actions
▶	Creating triggers to execute actions
▶	Applying labels to actions and triggers
▶	Creating clues with cursor attributes
O

ne especially powerful feature of Adobe Edge Animate CC is the 
capability to add actions, triggers, labels, and cursor attributes to 
your composition. These tools are what you use to make your animation 
interactive so your audience can participate in what your animation is doing 
instead of having to sit there and watch passively.
By placing labels in the Timeline, and associating them with actions and 
triggers, you can identify specific points in the Timeline, and you create a 
simpler means of controlling actions and triggers (as opposed to using time­
stamps). Through the use of labels, you don’t have to open the code box to 
change, for example, the point in time at which you want the animation to 
play when a trigger or action is called. Rather, you just have to slide the label 
up or down the Timeline to edit the action or trigger. Using labels helps you 
skip a step — opening the code box — if you need to edit your actions to 
reflect a different point in the Timeline.
When you place interactive elements into the Timeline, it’s a good idea to 
change the cursor attribute to provide a visual clue to your audience. Knowing 
that an element is (say) clickable, sizable, or what have you makes the audi­
ence more inclined to interact with the composition. If the cursor never 
changes, then your viewers may never know they could have clicked instead 
of just sitting there.

78
Part II: Adopting Tools and Techniques 
Inserting Stage Triggers
Adobe Edge Animate CC enables you to add Stage triggers — essentially com­
mands that control how the animation plays. A Stage trigger occurs when 
the animation reaches a certain point in the Timeline where you’ve placed a 
command to make something happen onscreen. A typical command launched 
with a Stage trigger is looping — having an animation repeat when it reaches 
the end (or at some other point you designate). Figure 5-1 shows a list of 
available Stage actions.
	
Figure 5-1: 
List of trig-
gers you 
can use for 
the Stage.
	
	
You can also add actions to the Stage along with triggers. For more informa­
tion on adding Stage actions from the Elements panel, see Chapter 11.
Adding triggers to the Stage
To add Stage triggers, you have to perform a number of steps in a certain 
order. The following procedure shows how to add a loop to your animation 
through a Stage trigger:
	
1.	Create an animation sequence to which you can add the Stage trigger.
	
	 For example, draw an element on the Stage using the drawing tools (see 
Chapter 3) and then create an animation sequence (see Chapter 4).
	
2.	Position the Playhead on the Timeline where you want the Stage 
trigger to fire.

79
 Chapter 5: Working with Triggers, Actions, Labels, and Cursors
	
	 You could, for example, set a trigger at the end of the animation.
	
3.	Click the Insert Trigger icon as identified in Figure 5-2.
	
Figure 5-2: 
Click the 
Insert 
Trigger icon 
to open the 
menu.
	
	
	 When you click the Insert Trigger icon, the Trigger menu opens (refer to 
Figure 5-1).
	
4.	With the menu open, click a trigger item on the right, for a loop, 
choose Play from.
	
	 Doing so inserts code into the window on the left (see Figure 5-3).
	
Figure 5-3: 
Click a 
trigger on 
the right to 
insert code 
on the left.
	
	
5.	Click the X in the top-right corner of the Trigger box to close and save 
your trigger.
	
	 You see a Trigger icon in the Timeline, as identified in Figure 5-4.

Part II: Adopting Tools and Techniques 
To see your loop in action, you need to preview it in a browser. To preview 
your animation in a browser, from the main menu, click File and then Preview 
in a Browser (see Figure 5-5).
	
Figure 5-5: 
Click 
Preview in 
Browser 
to see your 
triggers in 
action.
	
Congratulations! You now have a loop within your animation.
	
You can add a label or designate a time in the Trigger box if you want your ani­
mation to loop back to a certain point in the Timeline instead of returning to 
the beginning. (I describe how to create and insert labels in the next section.)
If you want to designate time instead of a label, you can do that as well. 
Simply type in the ms (milliseconds) value in the parentheses in the Trigger 
box as shown in Figure 5-6. For example, if you want your animation to loop 
back to 0:01 in the Timeline, then type in 1000; if you want to loop back to 
0:02 in the Timeline, then type in 2000.

81
 Chapter 5: Working with Triggers, Actions, Labels, and Cursors
	
You can edit Stage triggers a couple of different ways:
	
✓	You can move where the triggers are in the Timeline by clicking and 
dragging the Trigger icon (refer to Figure 5-4) up and down the Timeline.
	
✓	Double-click the Trigger icon to open the coding box. You can then edit 
the trigger from within the coding box.
Labeling Key Points
You can add labels into the Timeline for use with Stage triggers and element 
actions. Say you want your animation to jump back to a certain point in time 
when it reaches the Stage trigger. You can use a label to determine where the 
animation jumps back to in the Timeline.
	
Using labels with Stage triggers has a unique advantage over using time­
stamps. You can drag a label up and down the Timeline to change the point, 
for example, where a loop is to begin. This is nice, because you don’t have to 
open the coding box to make the edit, which is what you would have to do if 
you used a timestamp.
Creating labels
To insert a label into the Timeline use the main menu; click Timeline and 
then Insert Label (Figure 5-7).
A label appears in the Timeline where the Playhead is located. You can name 
this label (as shown in Figure 5-8).
You can name this label as you see fit, but name it appropriately so you can 
remember later why you put it there. For example, if you want a slideshow 
presentation to loop back to the 1-second mark instead of looping all the way 
back to the beginning, then you insert the label at the 1-second mark and 
name it something like Restart Slide Show.
When you have a label inserted into the Timeline, you can go back and edit 
your trigger or action.
	
You can move the label up and down the Timeline by clicking and dragging. 
This comes in handy when you start making more advanced animations and 
you’re constantly finding good reasons to adjust exactly where you want the 
loop (or whatever) to start. Without a label, you’d have to keep opening up 
the Trigger box, adjusting the ms value, and fuming about having to do that.

label.
	
	
You can change the name of the label by double-clicking it from the Timeline. 
Note that if you change the name of the label on the Timeline, then you have 
to go back to the trigger or action and update the name of the label in the 
code box as well.
Associating labels with 
actions and triggers
If you decide to add a label to your Timeline after you create a trigger or 
action, you can go back and edit the trigger or action to use the label.

83
 Chapter 5: Working with Triggers, Actions, Labels, and Cursors
	
✓	To edit a trigger, double-click the Trigger icon (as shown in Figure 5-4).
	
✓	To edit an action, select the element, right-click, and then choose Open 
Actions For.
With the Trigger/Action dialog box open, edit the code to show a label 
instead of a number of ms (milliseconds), as shown in Figure 5-9.
You have to use the single quotation marks for the label to work:
	
✓	When you type the label correctly, the text appears orange.
	
✓	If you forget the single quotation marks, the text appears purple.
	
Labels are case-sensitive. Therefore, if your label says Restart Slide Show 
but you type Restart slide show or Restart Slideshow in the Trigger box, your 
trigger won’t work. Be sure to type the label exactly as it appears on the 
Timeline in the Trigger box.
	
Figure 5-9: 
Trigger with 
a label.
	
	
When you’re using a specific ms value to identify a trigger, you need not use 
single quotation marks around the number; simply typing the number is suf­
ficient. If you want to use a label, however, then you must use single quota­
tion marks — one at the beginning and one at the end of the label. If you type 
in the label without the single quotation marks, the text appears in black to 
signal that the label is incorrect. If you use the single quotation marks cor­
rectly when you type the label, the text turns orange.
To use labels with Symbols and playback actions, see Chapter 12.
Inserting Element Actions
Adding actions to an element is similar to adding a trigger to the Stage. Two 
main differences exist between a Stage trigger and an element action:

84
Part II: Adopting Tools and Techniques 
	
✓	An element action requires that your audience do something to make 
the action happen.
	
	For example, your audience must click or mouse over an element to trig­
ger the element’s action. For a Stage trigger, the audience doesn’t have 
to do anything at all because the Stage trigger fires when the animation 
reaches the point where the trigger is located. Figure 5-10 shows a list of 
available actions that you can designate so that your audience can fire 
an element action.
	
✓	The Actions box for an element allows you to designate the type of 
interaction your audience must use to execute the action.
	
	Stage triggers don’t work the same way as actions; they execute when 
the animation reaches a certain point in the Timeline, whatever the 
audience is (or is not) doing. They don’t require interaction.
	
Figure 5-10: 
Actions you 
can desig-
nate to an 
element.
	
Element actions require interaction from the audience. These interactions 
include:
	
✓	Click or dblclick: Choose these options if you want your audience to 
click or double-click an element for the action to occur. You can use the 
swipe actions in the same way as Click, for mobile-focused experiences.
	
✓	Mouse: Use mouseover, mousedown, and other such actions if you want 
your audience to move the mouse over, into, or off of an element.
	
✓	Touch: The touch actions refer to mobile devices and touch screens and 
act the same as a click. If you plan for your animation to work for both 
desktop and mobile, then using just Click is sufficient.

85
 Chapter 5: Working with Triggers, Actions, Labels, and Cursors
	
✓	Focus: This action is tied to using the Tab key on the keyboard to enable 
your audience to select (or tab through) different elements; it has its 
own section of the chapter to detail the additional steps needed to 
implement it.
Adding actions to elements
One of the actions you may want to add to an element is to have it open a 
new URL. This capability is handy for creating menus or building links to 
other relevant content.
You can follow this same basic procedure for most of the other actions as 
well. (The additional steps for working with focus are coming up in the 
section directly after the steps for adding actions to elements.)
To start adding actions to an element, you must first create an element, as 
described in Chapter 3. With an element on the Stage, follow these steps:
	
1.	Select an element, right click and choose Open Actions For (as shown 
in Figure 5-11).
	
Figure 5-11: 
Right-click 
an element 
to open a 
large menu.
	
	
	 After you click Open Actions from the menu, a blank coding box (the 
place where you type in your commands) opens.
	
2.	From the menu on the right, choose Open URL.

86
Part II: Adopting Tools and Techniques 
	
	 Edge Animate populates the box with code, as shown in Figure 5-12.
	
	 By default, Adobe Edge Animate CC uses the URL to adobe.com when 
you click Open URL. If another destination for the link suits your pur­
pose better, simply replace the adobe.com URL with a URL that goes to 
where you want to send your audience.
	
Figure 5-12: 
The Actions 
coding box 
looks like 
this with 
code in it.
	
	
	 You can use multiple actions on an element:
	
✓	To add an action to an element, with the Actions coding box open, click 
the + in the upper-left corner, as indicated in Figure 5-12.
	
✓	To remove an action from an element, click the –.
	
✓	When you have more than one action associated with a single element, 
then Edge Animate displays all of the actions in a tab view (as shown in 
Figure 5-13). Simply click the tabs to display the relevant code for each 
action.
	
Figure 5-13: 
You can 
have more 
than one 
action per 
element.
	
	
3.	From the menu on the right, choose Open URL.
	
4.	Update the URL within the code box, which is highlighted in orange 
text.

87
 Chapter 5: Working with Triggers, Actions, Labels, and Cursors
	
5.	Close the coding box to save your work.
 	
6.	Preview your animation in a browser to test your work.
To test to make sure that your link works, click the link with the mouse.
On most websites, when you place your mouse over a link, the cursor 
changes from an arrow to a hand. Using the procedures described in this 
chapter, you can set cursor attributes to provide visual clues to your audi­
ence to indicate, for example, where links are or to show if you can select an 
element.
Congratulations! You now have a loop within your animation.
	
If an element already has an action associated with it, then when you click 
Open Actions, Edge Animate immediately opens the coding box instead of the 
menu shown in Figure 5-11. When that happens, and you want to add a second 
action to that element, then click the + (as shown in Figure 5-12).
Using focus as an action
Focus is an action that requires a couple more steps. You need to set the Tab 
Index from the Properties panel to get it to work. This section discusses spe­
cifically how to use the Tab Index with the Focus action.
	
Focus in Edge Animate is a jQuery event. From the jQuery API, “Elements with 
focus are usually highlighted in some way by the browser, for example with a 
dotted line surrounding the element.” In Edge Animate, you can highlight an 
element by setting the tab index. For more information on focus, see http://
api.jquery.com/focus.
To get started with the Focus action, follow these steps:
	
1.	Create an element on the Stage, as described in Chapter 3.
	
2.	Select the element.
	
3.	At the bottom of the Properties panel in the Accessibility section, assign 
a number to the element in the Tab Index (as shown in Figure 5-14).
	
4.	To test that your element now has a tab assigned to it, preview your 
animation in the browser.
	
	 Press the Tab key and the browser highlights your element:
 
• In Google Chrome, the highlight appears as a golden border.
 
• In Firefox and Internet Explorer, the highlight appears as a dotted 
line.

88
Part II: Adopting Tools and Techniques 
	
Figure 5-14: 
Setting the 
Tab Index to 
get Focus to 
work.
	
	
5.	Close the browser window and return to Edge Animate.
	
6.	Right-click the element, choose Open actions, and then choose Focus.
	
	  The coding box opens, and the following code appears:
// insert code to be run when an element gains focus
	
7.	Choose an action from the menu on the right (such as Open URL).
	
8.	Update the URL and then close the box to save your changes.
When you preview the animation in a browser and press the Tab key, when 
that element is highlighted — in effect, when it gains focus — the action is 
triggered. In this case, the new URL loads.
Adding Cursor Attributes
When you create, say, a button that your audience can interact with, your 
users expect some kind of signal to show them that part of the animation is 
clickable. A clear way to provide such a signal so your audience can interact 
with an element is to change the shape of the cursor. You do that by 
specifying attributes for the cursor. Read on.

89
 Chapter 5: Working with Triggers, Actions, Labels, and Cursors
Cursor attribute types
Edge Animate provides a large choice to choose from when it comes to cursor 
attributes, such as a pointing finger that indicates a link. As shown in Figure 5-15, 
you can change the cursor to represent different types of interactivity, 
including these:
	
✓	Pointing finger: Indicates a link to click.
	
✓	Watch: Indicates that something is loading and/or that the audience 
should wait for something to happen.
	
✓	Sizing: Indicates that the audience can resize something such as a 
window or a column or a row.
	
Figure 5-15: 
Edge 
Animate 
provides a 
wide range 
of cursor 
attributes.
	
	
Good animators always provide as many visual clues to their audience as 
possible. That’s how your audience realizes when and where an element of 
your composition is available for interaction.
Adding cursor attributes
Adobe Edge Animate CC allows you to change how the cursor looks by 
changing its attributes. This section shows you how to change the cursor 
into a pointer when you hover over a button in your composition.
To change the attributes of the cursor, follow these steps:
	
1.	Select an element, such as a button.
	
2.	From the Properties panel, click the Cursor Style icon as indicated in 
Figure 5-16.
	
3.	Choose a cursor attribute from the menu (see Figure 5-15).

To test that your cursor attribute is working, simply preview it in a browser. 
When you hover the mouse pointer over the element, it should change to a 
pointing finger, as shown in Figure 5-17.

▶	Customizing the workspace to your liking
▶	Saving your custom workspace or reverting to the default
A

dobe Edge Animate CC is a dynamic software tool. The flexibility of the 
tool provides you the means to configure the interface to your choos­
ing. You can close all the panels if you prefer to view only the Stage and the 
Timeline. Or you may want to maximize the Assets panel so that it takes up 
the entire screen. You can tab panels, stack them side by side, or place one 
on top of the other. And if the screen becomes entirely too cluttered, all you 
have to do is revert to the default view. However, if you finally get all the 
panels arranged in the manner best suited for you, you can save that view as 
a custom workspace.
The settings in the Properties panel constantly update as you click from one 
type of element to the next. Each different type of element — drawn rectan­
gle, imported image, or text box — has its own unique set of properties. Not 
all properties are completely unique; some remain consistent no matter 
their type.
Clicking and Dragging the Panels
The Adobe Edge Animate interface consists of a main menu along the top and 
a series of panels and frames border the Stage. The panels contain the but­
tons, toggles, and switches that enable you to design. The frames contain the 
panels — and you can configure those as well, moving and resizing them as 
you see fit. You can even revert to the default view or create several different 
types of views:
	
✓	Stacked
	
✓	Tabbed
	
✓	Default
	
✓	Side by side

92
Part II: Adopting Tools and Techniques 
You can customize the location and size for the Properties panel, the 
Elements panel, and the Library. Each of these panels has two small icons in 
the top-right corner:
	
✓	Drop-down arrow (shown in Figure 6-9): Use this icon to undock or 
close panels and frames. You can also use it to maximize frames.
	
✓	Click and Drag: Use this icon to move panels around the workspace.
You can click and drag the panel by placing the cursor over the Click and 
Drag icon at the far right, as indicated in Figure 6-1.
	
Figure 6-1: 
The Click 
and Drag 
icon for 
panels.
	
	
You can move each panel into any onscreen position and location, whether by 
clicking and dragging the name of each panel or clicking and dragging its icon.
Creating a stacked view
You can stack panels on top of each other. For example, you can click and 
drag the Properties panel to the top portion of the Timeline. While you click 
and drag, Edge Animate highlights — using a purple shade — where you are 
dragging the panel. Figure 6-2 shows the purple shade.
	
Figure 6-2: 
The purple 
area shows 
where the 
dragged 
panel will 
appear.
	
If you drag the Properties panel to the top portion of the Timeline (refer to 
Figure 6-2), the Properties panel appears stacked on top of the Timeline (as 
shown in Figure 6-3).

93
 Chapter 6: Embracing the Workspace

Creating a tabbed view
If the stacked view appears too cluttered for your taste, then you may prefer 
a tabbed view for the panels. You can drag a panel so that it’s tabbed with 
another panel: The dragged panel becomes a tab; the panel it’s dragged to 
becomes another tab. To make this happen, you can drag (for example) the 
Properties panel so that the purple shade is inside the Timeline, as shown in 
Figure 6-4.
	
Figure 6-4: 
Creating 
tabbed  
panels.
	
By dragging one panel into the center of another panel, you create a tabbed 
view (as shown in Figure 6-5).
When the panels are tabbed, you can click the different tabs to see the 
different panels.

Moving a panel back to 
its original position
After you move a panel around, you may decide you liked it better where it 
was before. In that case, you can simply click and drag that panel back to its 
original position.
If you move the Properties panel to a tabbed view with the Timeline, and 
want to revert the positioning, then click and drag the Properties panel (you 
can drag it from the name of the panel) over to the far-left side of the screen. 
A thin green shade appears, along with a hollow image of the panel, when 
you’ve dragged the Properties panel far enough over (Figure 6-6).

and a hol-
low image

the panel 
will appear.
	

95
 Chapter 6: Embracing the Workspace
Stacking panels side by side
The options are nearly endless as to where and how you can arrange the 
workspace. Another option besides stacked or tabbed is to place the panels 
side by side, as shown in Figure 6-7.
	
Figure 6-7: 
Side-by-side 
placement 
of panels.
	
This side-by-side stacking was done by dragging the Properties panel onto 
the left side of the Library panel, as shown in Figure 6-8.

Manipulating the Panels and Frames
Adobe Edge Animate CC is a flexible and customizable tool that enables you 
to work the way you want. You configure the panels and frames in various 
ways that include these:
	
✓	Undock panels and frames so they can float about the interface.
	
✓	Maximize the frame so you can see much more information.
	
✓	Save customized views tailored to your preference.

96
Part II: Adopting Tools and Techniques 
Undocking panels
If stacking or creating tabs isn’t your style, then you can undock the panels, 
which allows them to float around your workspace. In each case, you can 
undock either the panel or the frame, as shown in Figure 6-9.
	
Figure 6-9: 
When you 
want to 
undock, 
click the 
drop-down 
arrow to 
open the 
menu.
	
Undocking a panel separates it from the workspace so you can freely move 
the panel around onscreen (as shown in Figure 6-10).
	
Figure 6-10: 
An 
undocked 
panel.
	
If you click the red X in the top corner, the panel closes.
To reopen an undocked panel, from the main menu click Window and then 
choose which panel you wish to open. Any panels currently open have a 
check mark next to them. Closed panels don’t have a check mark (as shown 
in Figure 6-11).

97
 Chapter 6: Embracing the Workspace
	
Figure 6-11: 
Opening 
or closing 
panels from 
the Window 
menu.
	
Undocking frames
Each frame can hold multiple panels when you’ve grouped the panels in a 
tabbed view. If you have panels tabbed together and you choose Undock 
Frame from the menu shown in Figure 6-9, then all the tabbed panels undock 
from the workspace and you can float them around the interface at will (as 
shown in Figure 6-12).
	
Figure 6-12: 
Undocking 
a frame 
in tabbed 
view.
	
You can close the frame (and all of the panels with it) by clicking the X.

98
Part II: Adopting Tools and Techniques 
Maximizing the frame
Another option for viewing frames and panels is to expand to maximum view. 
You can do this by choosing Maximize Frame from the menu shown in Figure 
6-9. When you click Maximize Frame, your chosen panel fills the entire 
workspace.
	
The shortcut key to maximize a frame is one you may find especially useful. 
Simply place the cursor over the panel and press the ` key, which is located in 
the top-left corner of your keyboard, just to the left of the 1, showing the tilde 
(~) above the ` character. You can restore the frame size by choosing Restore 
Frame Size from the menu, as shown in Figure 6-13.
	
Figure 6-13: 
The Restore 
Frame 
Size menu 
option.
	
When you choose the Restore Frame Size option, the frame reverts to the 
way it appeared before you chose to Maximize Frame.
Saving a custom workspace view
When you get your workspace customized to exactly the way you want it, 
you can save that view and use it again on future compositions or the next 
time you open Adobe Edge Animate CC.
To save your custom workspace, from the main menu, choose 
Window➪Workspace➪New Workspace (as shown in Figure 6-14).
When you choose New Workspace, a dialog box appears. You can then name 
your customized workspace in that dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-15.
After you name your workspace and click OK, your newly named workspace 
appears in the Workspace menu (Figure 6-16). In this example, the custom 
workspace was named My Workspace.

From the Workspace menu shown in Figure 6-16, you can choose your

clicking Default. If, during the course of animating, your custom workspace 
gets moved around and you want to reset it, then you can click Reset “My 
Workspace.”
You can also Delete Workspace and create even more New Workspaces.

100
Part II: Adopting Tools and Techniques 
	
When you close Edge Animate after customizing your workspace, the software 
shows the same customized workspace the next time you open Edge Animate, 
regardless of whether you saved that view. If you were hoping the interface 
would revert to the default view, you can reset (go back to) the default by 
clicking Window➪Reset “Default” (as shown in Figure 6-17). See the next sec­
tion for more details.
Reverting to the default view
It’s fun to move and resize the different panels and frames around the inter­
face. However, if you get carried away and you start to think you broke some­
thing or you can’t figure out how to undo what you just did, don’t worry: You 
can always revert your workspace to the way you want it to be.
	
Sorry, but pressing Ctrl+Z on your keyboard doesn’t undo moving panels 
around the workspace.
To revert your workspace to the default view, from the main menu choose 
Window➪Workspace➪Reset “Default”.
If you’re working from a custom saved view, the Workspace menu appears 
a bit differently. In Figure 6-17, the top arrow shows how to revert to the 
default view; the bottom arrow shows how to revert to the saved custom 
view.

Choosing Window➪Workspace➪Reset “Default” restores your workspace to 
looking the way it did the first time you opened Edge Animate.

101
 Chapter 6: Embracing the Workspace
The Constantly Changing 
Properties Panel
The Properties panel (found along the left column) constantly updates itself 
depending on which type of element is selected. If you select a drawn element 
such as a rectangle, Edge Animate displays different configurations in the 
Properties panel than if you select a text box or an image. This keeps the 
clutter down in that you only see what you need, or can, work with for a 
certain type of element. Some properties are consistent, and appear no 
matter what type of element you select; other properties are specific to 
certain types of elements. Examples of consistent properties include: ID, 
Class, Actions, Display block, and Position and Size. All of these are discussed 
in detail in the following pages.
In addition to formatting and animating from the Properties panel, you can 
also:
	
✓	Edit the Title tag
	
✓	Set the class name
	
✓	Add actions
	
✓	Enable your audience to tab through elements
Specific properties for the Stage
Your first view of the Properties panel occurs when you start a new 
composition (Figure 6-18). This initial view shows properties for the Stage, 
including:
	
✓	Title tag: You can edit the title tag for the HTML page from the 
Properties panel.
	
✓	Actions: You can add actions to the Stage from the Properties panel.
	
✓	Size dimensions: You can edit the size of the Stage from the Properties 
panel.
	
✓	Overflow: These attributes include Visible, Hidden Scroll, and Auto. You 
can find more information on Overflow in Chapter 8.
	
✓	Toggle Autoplay: If you don’t want your animation to automatically start 
playing when the page loads, make sure this check box isn’t checked. If 
you do uncheck the box, then make sure to add an action to an element — 
such as a Play button — so your audience can start the animation.

102
Part II: Adopting Tools and Techniques 
	
✓	Composition ID: I recommend leaving the Composition ID alone. Edge 
Animate uses this ID in the HTML file for reference.
	
✓	Down-level Stage: This simpler version of the Stage accommodates 
browsers that don’t support HTML5 or CSS3. Chapter 14 provides 
details of the down-level Stage.
	
✓	Poster: Used with the down-level Stage. Chapter 14 contains additional 
information.
	
✓	Preloader: Used for setting what your audience first sees while your 
animation is loading to the screen.
	
	This is best used for large compositions that may not load immediately 
upon launch. Chapter 14 contains additional information.
	
Figure 6-18:

panel for the

You can find more information on Stage properties in Chapter 3, where I 
discuss resizing the Stage by pixel or by percent. Chapter 13 also provides 
additional information on configuring the Stage for a responsive web design; 
Chapter 20 provides a sample project on creating a responsive web animation.
	
You can edit the Title tag not only from the HTML file, but also from the 
Properties panel. The Title tag is important because, if your animation is a 
standalone web page, the text used for the Title tag appears in the tab of 
your web browser. (Figure 6-19 shows the Title tag in the Firefox browser.) 
Therefore it’s good practice to give the Title tag a name relevant to your 
content.

Consistent properties for all elements
The Properties panel appears in the left column of the default view of the 
interface. This is where you can configure, toggle, set, animate, etc. all of 
your different elements, including the Stage (see the previous section).
Depending on the type of element that you select, different properties appear 
in the Properties panel, but some of them remain consistent (as shown in 
Figure 6-20):

✓	ID: Name an element in this box, which then appears in the Timeline.
	
✓	Class: You can specify the user class for a specific element. If you aren’t 
a developer and see yourself strictly as a designer, you may not use this 
box; if you do know JavaScript and CSS, you may use this feature. When 
you type a name into the Class box, and then open the .js file from the 
folder structure, you should see that your content elements now have a 
user class assigned.
	
✓	Actions: You can assign actions to elements from the Properties panel. 
See Chapter 5 for more information.
	
✓	Display block: This is where you can set when an element is Always On, 
On, or Off. If an element is On, you can see it; if it’s Off, it’s hidden from 
view. You can also set the Overflow properties to Visible, Hidden, Scroll, 
or Auto. Opacity is another property that you can set from this block. 
See Chapter 8 for more information.
	
✓	Position and Size: You can use these settings in association with build­
ing a responsive web design. Here you can set an element’s anchor point 
(which determines the point of an element that Edge Animate consid­
ers the center, thus affecting how certain animations display the ele­
ment). You can also position the element on the Stage and change its 
actual size. You can even use Layout Presets. For more information, see 
Chapter 8.
	
✓	Transform: In this block, you can skew and rotate elements. You 
can also change the scale of the element and move the origin point. 
Additional information is found in Chapter 7.
	
✓	Cursor: If you want a specific type of cursor to appear when your audi­
ence hovers the mouse pointer over an element, you can set that from 
here. See Chapter 5.
	
✓	Shadow: Whether your element is a rectangle, ellipses, a text box, or 
an image, you can add a shadow to make it stand out. You can even ani­
mate that shadow. Chapter 9 contains additional information.
	
✓	Clip: You can use clip to cover or uncover portions of an element. For 
example, you can animate an image so that parts of the element slowly 
appear or disappear. Chapter 9 has the details.
	
✓	Accessibility: Refers to setting a tab index for elements. This allows 
your audience to use the Tab key on the keyboard to select different ele­
ments (as discussed in Chapter 5).
	
You can assign a title to images, rectangles, and other drawn elements, includ­
ing text boxes. These titles appear when your audience hovers their mouse 
over the element, or if they use Tab to select an element or elements. To 
assign a title to an element, simply type in the box as indicated by the red 
rectangle in Figure 6-20.

 Chapter 6: Embracing the Workspace
	
Figure 6-20: 
Consistent 
properties 
for all types 
of elements.
	
Specific properties for specific elements
You use properties in Edge Animate to format and add style to elements. 
Elements can be anything from a drawn box to images to text. When you 
select one of these types of elements from the Stage, different properties 
appear in the Properties panel.
Each different element type has different properties that you can configure 
from the Properties panel. The element types include:
	
✓	Drawn: Objects you create, such as rectangles, rounded rectangles, and 
ellipses.
	
✓	Images: Pictures you insert, which have their own sets of properties.
	
✓	Text: The text boxes that you create, which have their own unique 
properties as well.

106
Part II: Adopting Tools and Techniques 
Drawn elements
When you select a drawn element — rectangle, rounded rectangle, or an 
ellipse — new properties appear in the Properties panel. Although text boxes 
are considered drawn elements, they have their own special properties, 
detailed in the next couple of sections.
Color section
In the Color section, you can set the background color of the element (refer 
to Figure 3-7), the border color, the border type, and the thickness of the 
border (as shown in Figure 6-21).
	
Figure 6-21: 
Setting 
the drawn 
element’s 
background 
color, bor-
der color, 
type, and 
thickness.
	
Corners section
The Corners section is where you can set the roundness of the corners — 
or even animate the corners so that a square box turns into a circle. (In 
Chapter 9, I discuss how to set up that animation sequence.)
In Figure 6-22, you can see that you can configure up to eight different cor­
ners of an element. If you click the 4, then you can configure four corners. If 
you want to set all of the corners at once, then choose 1.
You can set the Corner settings as either px or percentage.

107
 Chapter 6: Embracing the Workspace
	
Figure 6-22: 
Set the 
roundness 
of the  
corners.
	
Image elements
You can set images as either img or div.
	
✓	As an img: Edge Animate treats the element as an image using the image 
tag in HTML.
	
✓	As a div: Edge Animate treats your image as a background image.
You can set the image to either img or div from the Properties panel, near 
the top, as shown in Figure 6-23. Use the image tag (img) when the image 
includes actual content (for example, a graph); use a div tag with a back­
ground image when the image is only decorative.
	
Figure 6-23: 
Setting 
specific 
proper-
ties for div 
background 
images.
	
	
Also shown in Figure 6-23 is the capability to swap out one image for another, 
as indicated by the red arrow. This is useful if you don’t have the final art 
ready, but you do want to start animating. The next subsection details how to 
do this extremely handy trick.

108
Part II: Adopting Tools and Techniques 
Swapping images in your animation
In this case, you can use filler art to get started; when the final art is ready, all 
you have to do is follow these steps:
	
1.	Make sure that your replacement image is added to the Library panel. 
If it is not, add it as follows: From the Library panel, click the + icon 
(as shown in Figure 6-24).
	
	Your chosen replacement image is added to the Assets section of 
the Library panel.
	
Figure 6-24: 
Adding an 
image to 
the Asset 
Library so 
you can use 
it to replace 
another 
image.
	
	
2.	Select the image element you want to replace from the Stage.
	
	 The image becomes highlighted.
	
3.	Click the arrows in the Image section of the Properties panel.
	
	 A box with a list of images from the Library panel appears.
	
4.	Choose a replacement image.
	
	 The replacement image becomes highlighted.
	
5.	Insert the replacement image into your animation by clicking 
anywhere on the interface, besides the box.
	
	 The new image replaces the old image.
	
6.	Test your animation with the new image by previewing in a browser.
	
	 The new image does its thing in your animation.
Background image
If you choose div to set the image as a background image, then the Properties 
panel appears (refer to Figure 6-23), and you have the opportunity to set the 
location and size of the image as indicated by the orange rectangle.

109
 Chapter 6: Embracing the Workspace
Image tag
If you choose img instead of div, then Edge Animate assigns an image tag to 
that element. When this happens, the Properties panel updates and appears 
as shown in Figure 6-25.
If you designated your image as an img, you can now name an ALT tag for 
your image. The ALT tag appears in place of the image if your audience has 
images turned off in their browsers. A typical ALT tag would show Cute 
Kitten in place of an image showing, say, a cute kitten.
	
Alt tags are also good for search engine optimization (SEO). SEO is a market­
ing term for web developers, which basically translates into best practices for 
the best search results. Search engines can’t read images, but they can read 
ALT tags, so by adding an ALT tag to your image you provide a way for search 
engines to index your content.
	
Figure 6-25: 
Add an ALT 
tag to your 
images as 
best 
practice.
	
	
There is a difference between ALT tags for images and the accessibility title — 
text that appears as a pop-up when you hover your mouse pointer over an 
element (refer to Figure 6-20, #10) — for all different types of elements:
	
✓	ALT tags provide a way for search engines to index your images for 
search results. The text assigned to an ALT tag appears in place of the 
image if the image cannot be displayed.
	
✓	Accessibility titles provide a way to add pop-up text that appears when 
someone hovers the mouse pointer over an element.

110
Part II: Adopting Tools and Techniques 
Text box elements
Edge Animate is very font-friendly. When you select a text box, the Text prop­
erties appear in the Properties panel, as shown in Figure 6-26. You can set 
many text properties:
	
✓	Font style (refer to Figure 2-7)
	
✓	Font size
	
✓	Font weight
	
✓	Font decoration
	
✓	Left, center, or right alignment
You can animate the font size, as when you make text appear to shrink or 
grow. You can also animate the font color if (say) you want to have your text 
slowly (or quickly) change from one color to another. See Chapter 10 for 
more information on animating text.
	
Unfortunately, you can’t animate a change from one font style to another.
To add new fonts, see Chapter 11.

Font proper-
ties as size, 
color, type, 
and justifi-

In This Chapter
▶	Animating powerfully with the Transform tool
▶	Applying Transform attributes by clicking and dragging or entering numbers
▶	Centering on the center point
▶	Animating border radius, spinning, skewing, scaling, and rotating with the 
Transform tool
T

he Transform tool allows you to animate the Skew, Scale, Rotation, 
Border Radius, and Location of an element simply by clicking and drag­
ging. The Transform tool is located directly to the right of the Select tool, as 
shown in Figure 7-1.
You can also use the Transform tool to spin elements, which is different from 
rotating elements (also described in this chapter).
	
Figure 7-1:

Part III: Formatting and Animating 
Transforming with the Transform 
Tool and Properties Panel
Here’s a handy feature of Edge Animate: Much of what you can do with the 
Transform tool, you can also do from the Properties panel. While you’re 
making your animation, you may want to switch back and forth between the 
Transform tool and the Properties panel. The difference is that the Transform 
tool allows more fluidity while the Property panel provides more accuracy 
and precision by using numbers.
Turning a selected element 
into a transform selection
If you right-click an element on the Stage, a menu appears from which you 
can choose Transform (along with several other options), as shown in 
Figure 7-2. When you click Transform, elements you select appear as a 
transform selection.
	
Figure 7-2: 
Right-click 
an element 
for several 
options.
	

115
 Chapter 7: Animating with the Transform Tool and Properties Panel
You can also click the Transform tool icon, as shown in Figure 7-1. When you 
click the Transform tool, the element changes from a blue border to a black 
border with several selection points, as shown in Figure 7-3.
	
Figure 7-3: 
Regular 
boxes and 
transform 
boxes.
	
Transform elements have 
their own properties
When you have the Transform tool selected on an element, new items appear 
in the Properties panel, as shown in Figure 7-4.
	
Figure 7-4:

feature.
	

116
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
When you have a Transform box onscreen, you can animate it several differ­
ent ways, as described in the rest of this chapter. I highly encourage you to 
be creative with the Transform tool to create unique animations.
Understanding the Center 
Transform Origin
The center point, indicated in Figure 7-5, determines where the center of an 
element is located. Where you place the center point has an effect on the 
animation.
	
Figure 7-5: 
The little 
blue dot 
known as 
the center 
point.
	
Positioning the center point
You can move the center point around, and thus affect how an animation 
plays out, by using either of two features:
	
✓	The Transform tool: All elements have a center point when you click the 
Transform tool. You can move that center point by clicking and dragging 
it with your mouse. You can even drag the center point outside of the 
element for an exaggerated animation.
	
✓	The Properties panel: You can position the center point through the 
Properties panel from the Transform section, as shown in Figure 7-6. 
Note that this feature has X and Y coordinates; these determine where 
the center point appears in the box. X and Y coordinates of 50% repre­
sent the center of the element.

Animating with the center point
You can experiment by placing the center point in different parts of the ele­
ment and seeing how that affects the animation. Here’s a step-by-step expla­
nation of how to create an animation sequence with the center point on a 
text box:
	
1.	Draw a text box on the Stage and type in something like Text Box.
	
2.	Select the Transform tool (refer to Figure 7-1).
	
3.	Click and drag the center point so it’s over the top-left part of the first 
letter, as shown in Figure 7-7.
	
Figure 7-7: 
Moving the 
center point 
off-center to 
see how it 
affects the 
animation.
	

118
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
	
4.	Set the Pin and the Playhead in the Timeline.
	
	 Toggle the Pin, and then drag the Playhead down the Timeline so that 
you see the chevron arrows (as shown in Figure 7-8).
	
Figure 7-8: 
Setting up 
the Timeline 
to create an 
animation 
sequence.
	
	
5.	On the Stage, place your cursor over the bottom-right corner of the 
text box so that the cursor turns into a semicircle-with-arrow, as 
shown in Figure 7-9.
	
6.	Click, hold down the mouse button, and swing the mouse around in a 
circular motion.
	
	 You should see the text box rotate as you move the mouse. The box 
swings around as if a pin was stuck in the top-left corner.
	
7.	When you’re done swinging the box, release the mouse button.
	
	 Edge Animate creates an animation sequence, which you can then 
preview.
To experiment, move the center point back to the center and then try rotat­
ing the box again. You should see a very different animation in that the 
center of the box is now actually in the center instead in the top left of the 
box. The difference is that the box is now rotating from the center of the box 
instead of from the top left.
	
Figure 7-9: 
Grab the 
corner of 
the box to 
rotate.
	

119
 Chapter 7: Animating with the Transform Tool and Properties Panel
	
Here’s something to try for fun:
	
1.	Create a long animation sequence so that you can slowly see how the 
point of origin affects the rotation of the text box.
	
2.	At the beginning of the sequence, set the center point in the top-left 
corner.
	
3.	At the end of the sequence, position the center point in the lower-right 
corner.
	
4.	Preview the animation to see how the center point gives the appear­
ance of the text not only rotating, but also moving across the Stage 
as well.
	
	 You can also scrub the Playhead up and down the Timeline to see the 
origin point move across the box.
Creating Animations with 
the Transform Tool
The Transform tool enables you to create many different types of animation 
sequences. In this section, I cover:
	
✓	Border radius
	
✓	Moving an element across the Stage
	
✓	Spinning elements
Animating the border radius
You can animate the border radius of an element with the Transform tool so 
that you can change square corners to rounded corners. Figure 7-10 shows 
where to click and drag to change the radius of the corner. This allows you 
to take an element with square edges and animate it so that it transitions to 
having rounded corners.
To animate the transition of square corners to rounded corners, with the 
Transform tool selected, place the mouse pointer near one of the squares in 
the corner of the element.

120
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
	
Figure 7-10: 
Using the 
Transform 
tool to 
animate 
rounded 
corners.
	
Click and drag one of the corner squares inward toward the center point. 
The farther you click and drag, the more the square corners round off 
(Figure 7-11).
	
If you want to animate the corners rounding off, remember to set the Timeline 
so that Edge Animate creates keyframes and an animation sequence: Toggle 
the Pin, make sure the Stopwatch is red, and separate the Pin and the 
Playhead on the Timeline as shown in Figure 7-8.
	
Figure 7-11: 
Rounding 
corners by 
using the 
Transform 
tool.
	
	
If you click and drag one of the corners, then all four corners round off in 
synch, but they won’t stay to scale if you start dragging to the left or right 
(as compared to evenly dragging inward). If you want to ensure that all the 
corners stay in scale relative to each other, then press Shift on the keyboard 
while you click and drag.
If you want to round off only one of the corners, then press Ctrl on the key­
board (or for the Mac use Cmd) while you click and drag. You can also use 
the Corners section of the Properties panel to set specific configurations.

121
 Chapter 7: Animating with the Transform Tool and Properties Panel
Animating the location of an element
You have several different ways you can animate an element from one loca­
tion to another (having it move across the Stage). One way is to use the 
Transform tool by following these steps:
	
1.	Set the Playhead and Pin in the Timeline to designate when the ani­
mation will start and how long you want the animation to last.
	
2.	Click the Transform tool from the toolbar (as shown in Figure 7-1) and 
then select an element from the Stage.
	
	 The pointer changes to a four-way cursor (as shown in Figure 7-12).
	
Figure 7-12: 
Using the 
Transform 
Tool to 
animate the 
location of 
an element.
	
	
3.	Click, hold, and drag the element across the Stage to where you want 
it to appear, and then release the mouse button.
	
	 The element is now animated to move across the screen.
	
4.	To test your new animation, you can run the animation on the Stage 
or you can preview it in a browser.
	
5.	To save your animation, you can press Ctrl+S or, from the main menu, 
choose File➪Save.
Spinning elements
In this section, I show how to make an object spin using the Transform tool, 
which is different from rotating.
Here’s how to make an element spin.
	
1.	Create an element on the Stage.
	
	 In this example, I use a text box with the word Spin in it.

122
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
	
2.	Set up the Playhead and Pin in the Timeline to designate how long 
you want the animation to last.
	
3.	With the element selected, click the Transform tool (refer to 
Figure 7-1).
	
4.	Place the cursor over the left-middle selector on the box so that you 
see the double arrow (as shown in Figure 7-13).
	
Figure 7-13: 
Click and 
drag the 
middle-left 
selector 
to start  
spinning.
	
	
5.	Click, hold, and drag the mouse to the right.
	
	 The element transforms as you drag.
	
	 Use the pink guideline to help you determine when the element is com­
pletely flipped over. The guideline automatically appears as you click 
and drag.
	
6.	When the element appears reversed — that is, appears as its mirror 
image — stop dragging and release the mouse button (see Figure 7-14).
	
	 Releasing the mouse button generates an animated keyframe automati­
cally. This is the first half of your spin animation; the remaining steps 
complete it.
	
Figure 7-14: 
The mirror 
image.
	
	
7.	Adjust the Playhead and Pin in the Timeline as shown in Figure 7-15.
	
	 To do so, move the Pin to the end of the first animation sequence, and 
the Playhead farther along from there.

123
 Chapter 7: Animating with the Transform Tool and Properties Panel
	
Figure 7-15: 
Adjust the 
Playhead 
and Pin in 
the Timeline 
to create 
the second 
half of the 
spin.
	
	
	 You can move the Pin and Playhead together by placing the mouse over 
the onscreen chevron. When you see the pointer change to a hand, you 
can click and drag the Playhead and Pin together down the Timeline.
	
8.	With the Playhead and Pin in position, place the cursor on the right­
most middle selector, and then click and drag to the left until the ele­
ment appears the same as when the first half of the animation started.
	
	 You should now have two animation sequences. If you want the element 
to spin continuously, you can add a loop (as described in Chapter 5).
	
Adobe Edge Animate CC has several Paste Special options, shown in Figure 
7-16. They include a Paste Inverted option, which comes in handy if you want 
to replicate the opposite of a keyframe. In this example on how to make an 
element spin, you can use the Paste Inverted option to create the second 
keyframe. After creating the first keyframe, copy it and then paste it using the 
Paste Inverted option.
	
Figure 7-16: 
The Paste 
Special 
options from 
the Edit 
menu.
	

124
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
Animating with the Transform 
Tool or the Properties Panel
You can also use the Properties panel to create three of the same animation 
effects that you create with the Transform tool:
	
✓	Skewing
	
✓	Scaling
	
✓	Rotating
Using the Transform tool gives you more fluid control over the animation. 
When you use the Properties panel, you set specific numbers — which pro­
vides greater precision in creating the animation.
Skewing elements
Skewing your elements is a very cool effect. In Adobe Edge Animate CC, to 
skew your element means to animate your element through a transition of 
oblique angles or to change its direction or position suddenly. The best way 
to figure out what skew does is to experiment with it.
One example of skewing is to bring text onto the Stage. You can use skew­
ing as an alternative approach to fading text in or scrolling it. Skewing gives 
the effect of the text shrinking in size as the different angles twist the words 
around.
Transform tool
With the Transform tool and element selected, place the cursor directly 
along an edge as shown in Figure 7-17 so that you see the double lines with 
half-arrows. You can now click and drag to skew the element.
	
Figure 7-17: 
Skewing 
with the 
Transform 
tool.
	

125
 Chapter 7: Animating with the Transform Tool and Properties Panel
	
If you don’t want to animate the skew effect, be sure you disable the Auto 
Keyframe mode when you use the Transform tool.
If you do want to animate the skew, then set the Pin and Playhead at different 
points in the Timeline when you use the Transform tool and make sure the 
Stopwatch is red.
Properties panel
To use Skew via the Properties panel, follow these steps:
	
1.	Import an image or create an element.
	
2.	Adjust the Timeline Playhead and Pin to where you want the skewing 
to happen.
	
3.	From the Properties panel, adjust the number of Skew degrees (see 
Figure 7-18).
	
You can specify both horizontal and vertical Skew values for the object. These 
values affect the object on its X and Y axis (respectively). To find the best 
effect, try using both values at varying degrees; also adjust the length of the 
animation.
After you set the Skew values, you can test the effect as follows: Move the Pin 
in the Timeline forward or backward to allow at least a 5-second duration (to 
provide enough time that you can really see the effect in action), and then 
reset the Skew values back to 0 to display the object without any Skew at all.
	
Adjusting the length of the animation for Skew has a dramatic effect on how 
the animation plays out. With a longer animation, the Skew effect has more 
time to show the different angles the object is twisted through before settling 
back to 0 (or whatever final value you set for the object).
	
Figure 7-18: 
The Skew 
feature 
in the 
Properties 
panel.
	

126
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
	
The most you can skew an element is 89 degrees. If you use a value higher 
than 89, Edge Animate reverts the value to 89. You’ll probably want to use a 
skew value much lower than 89 for your final composition. A value of 89 twists 
and transforms the element greatly and may be a bit much.
Scaling elements
Scaling means essentially that you can change the size of an element while 
keeping its proportions consistent if you want. You can:
	
✓	Scale elements with the Transform tool
	
✓	Scale elements from the Properties panel
Scaling with the Transform tool
If you prefer to use a click-and-drag method for scaling elements, you can use 
the Transform tool to do just that by following these steps:
	
1.	Click the Transform tool (refer to Figure 7-1) to select it.
	
2.	Place the cursor over one of the corner selectors on an element.
	
	 As shown in Figure 7-19, you see a diagonal cursor with an arrow at 
each end.
	
3.	Click, hold, and drag the corner selector.
	
	 If you drag outward, you make the element larger; if you drag inward, 
you make the element smaller.
	
Figure 7-19: 
Using the 
Transform 
tool for  
scaling.
	
	
To keep the element’s proportions the same, hold down Shift while clicking 
and dragging.
Scaling with the Properties panel
You can shrink and grow objects through a Scale feature on the Properties 
panel. You can Scale objects both horizontally and vertically.

127
 Chapter 7: Animating with the Transform Tool and Properties Panel
	
The Scale feature has a Link Scale attribute that enables you to synch the pro­
portions (see Figure 7-20). When the Link Scale attribute is on, the horizontal 
and vertical sizes remain in synch — but only when you’re modifying the 
values from the Properties panel. With the Link Scale attribute turned off, you 
can set two different values for horizontal and vertical.
	
Scaling your text is different from animating the font size. To animate the font 
size, see Chapter 9.
	
Figure 7-20: 
Scaling has 
a Link Scale 
attribute.
	
Shrinking elements
To make an element shrink, go to the Properties panel and click the dia­
monds next to Scale with the percentages at 100% (see Figure 7-20). Clicking 
the diamonds creates keyframes.
Next, toggle the Pin and slide out the Playhead in the Timeline to the point 
where you want the shrinking to stop. Last, adjust the percentages in the 
Scale feature to a value lesser than 100%. This should create an animated key­
frame for you in the Timeline.
	
Scaling an element can create a neat trick by making your object appear to 
flip over. To see this in action, create an animated keyframe where the object 
starts at 100% and ends at –100%. The animation shrinks the element down to 
nothing, and then makes it reappear flipped upside down. The negative per­
centage is what flips the object over.

128
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
Growing elements
To make your element grow larger, start the keyframe with the object at 
a value lesser than or equal to 100%. Then slide out the Playhead in the 
Timeline to the point where you want the growing to stop (making sure to 
keep the Pin at the point where you want the animation to start). Then go 
back to the Properties panel and increase the percentage to the size desired. 
Provided the Stopwatch is still red, Edge Animate creates a new animated 
keyframe for you.
Rotating elements
You can rotate elements in your composition, like the wheels of a car, which is 
different from making an element spin (as discussed earlier in this chapter).
In this section, I show you how to:
	
✓	Use the Rotate feature from the Properties panel to make your text 
appear to rotate.
	
✓	Make a rotation animation appear as if it’s happening very quickly or 
very slowly.
For information on how to rotate an element with the Transform tool, look 
in the beginning of this chapter, in the section, “Animating with the center 
point.”
	
This technique to make elements rotate also works on imported images.
Determining how fast to make the element rotate
After you have a text box or an image ready to rotate, you need to determine 
how long you want the animation to last.
	
✓	If you want the rotating to happen quickly, separate the Playhead from 
the Pin in the Timeline for about a half-second or so.
	
✓	If you want the text or image to rotate more slowly, then move the 
Playhead further down the Timeline away from the Pin.
	
	The shorter the duration of the animation, the quicker it happens. 
The longer the animation lasts, the slower it plays out. For a quick ani­
mation, create a very short keyframe. For a slow animation, create a 
long keyframe.

 Chapter 7: Animating with the Transform Tool and Properties Panel
Using the rotate feature
Go to the Properties panel and find the Rotate feature as shown in Figure 7-21. 
Click the diamond next to Rotate to set the position of your object at the 
start of the animation sequence. Then set up your Timeline to make an ani­
mation sequence.
There are two ways to change the rotation of an object from the Properties 
panel:
	
✓	Click and drag the thin white line on the Rotate circle in a circular 
fashion
	
✓	Input a degree value by clicking the orange 0 and typing in the number 
of degrees you want the object to rotate.
	
If you type in the degrees manually and press Enter, the thin white line on the 
circle rotates to the degree value you indicated. This provides a helpful visual 
clue to the angle created by the number of the degrees you entered.
	
Figure 7-21: 
The Rotate 
feature 
in the 
Properties 
panel.
	
	
For the keyframe to appear, the Stopwatch icon in the Timeline must be red.
After you create the animation sequence, you can press the spacebar to play 
the rotating animation.

130
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
	
If you want to change the speed of the rotating effect, place the cursor at the 
end of the keyframe in the Timeline so that you see the double-arrow cursor. 
Then click and drag to create either of the following effects:
	
✓	Slow down the rotation by increasing the length of the keyframe.
	
✓	Speed up the rotation by decreasing the length of the keyframe.

Formatting Element Visibility, 
Positioning, and Sizing
In This Chapter
▶	Concealing and revealing elements
▶	Automating scroll bars
▶	Managing overflow
▶	Adjusting opacity
▶	Applying layout presets and defaults
I

n Chapter 8, I present how to animate and format several aspects of the 
elements you use in your animation. This includes formatting and animat­
ing visibility: You can choose when, where, and for how long an element 
appears on the Stage by using visibility.
In addition, scroll bars and the Overflow property enable you to work with 
content that is larger than the container. For example, scroll bars provide 
your audience with a way to access and read text that doesn’t fit entirely on 
the screen.
When creating animations, you expect to size and position elements as 
needed — and Edge Animate responds with a ton of positioning and sizing 
features. This includes a variety of layout presets.
Setting the Visibility of Elements
You can format and animate the visibility of an element — that is, whether 
the viewer can see an element on the Stage. Even if you turn Visibility off and 
you no longer see the element on the Stage, you can still select it from the 
Elements panel or the Timeline and work with it. You have these options:

132
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
	
✓	You can turn Visibility Off, On, or Always On.
	
✓	You can animate the Visibility setting so that elements appear or 
disappear as the animation plays.
Element Visibility on the Stage
If your composition starts to get cluttered with too many elements, you can 
turn the visibility of specific elements off and on to help clean up the clutter. 
When you turn off an element’s visibility, it disappears from the Stage but 
it’s still present; you can still see it when you preview your animation in a 
browser.
Figure 8-1 shows where the Set Element Visibility icon is in the Timeline and 
how it appears when it’s turned on or off. For more information on setting the 
visibility of elements on the Stage, see Chapter 11.

Animating the visibility of elements
You can use the Element Display feature on just about anything in Edge 
Animate, including text boxes, images and rectangles. The Display feature is 
found in the Properties panel (as shown in Figure 8-2).
	
The default is Always On, which means your audience will always see the 
element on the Stage.
Always On, or Off, or On
Use the Display feature to toggle elements from one state to another, whether 
Always On, On, or Off. Click the tiny arrow next to Always On to open the 
menu shown in Figure 8-3.

133
 Chapter 8: Formatting Element Visibility, Positioning, and Sizing
	
Figure 8-2: 
The Element 
Display 
feature.
	
	
Figure 8-3: 
The Display 
feature 
menu.
	
The Element Display feature is useful in that you can tell Edge Animate when 
you want a certain element shown in the animation. This comes in handy 
if, for example, you want a bit of text to appear late in the animation and 
then for it to disappear. Instead of adding in Opacity attributes to make text 
appear at a certain point in the Timeline — by animating the Opacity from 0% 
to 100% — you can simply use the element Display feature. More information 
on Opacity is found in this chapter.
	
The default setting for the Element Display feature is Always On. So, if you 
want your audience to always see the element, then you don’t have to do 
anything to make sure your element is always on.
To toggle an element from Off to On, you need to first create an element such 
as a rectangle. Then, from the Properties panel, click the drop-down arrow 
for Display and choose Off. Doing so inserts a keyframe (diamond) into the 
Timeline as shown in Figure 8-4 — which also shows the Display setting, 
which appears in the Timeline along with the keyframe.

134
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
	
Figure 8-4: 
Element 
Display off.
	
From the Timeline, you can toggle the Display between off and on, but in 
order to revert to Always On, you have to do that from the Properties panel. 
When you revert the element to Always On, Edge Animate warns you that any 
keyframes will be removed (as shown in Figure 8-5).
	
Figure 8-5: 
Reverting 
to Always 
On removes 
any key-
frames

ated with

Don’t be alarmed to see your text box suddenly disappear from the Stage 
when you turn it to Off. Likewise, don’t worry when you realize you can’t 
select the turned-Off element from the Stage. In essence, when an element is 
Off, it may as well not be part of the composition at all. However, you can still 
select it from the Elements panel in the top-right corner and you can also see 
it listed in the Timeline. That’s how you know the element still exists.
Follow these steps to animate the visibility of an element from Off to On to 
Off again:
	
1.	 Create an element on the Stage.	
	
2.	Move the Playhead to the point in the Timeline at which you want the 
element to become visible.
	
3.	Select the element and then choose On from the Display menu.
	
	 Doing so automatically turns Visibility to Off for the time leading up to 
when it’s On.

135
 Chapter 8: Formatting Element Visibility, Positioning, and Sizing
	
4. 	Move the Playhead to the point in the Timeline at which you want the 
element to become invisible.
	
5.	Choose Off from the Display menu.
Congratulations! You have now created an animation in which an element 
starts off invisible, becomes visible, and then disappears again. To test that 
it works, you can preview the animation in the browser or you can view from 
the Stage.
Figure 8-6 shows how your Timeline should appear after you complete the 
quick steps for animating Visibility. The shaded areas represent when the 
element is off. The Timeline segment between the two hollow diamonds 
represents the time during which the element is visible.

Adding scroll bars, hidden, visible, or auto
Overflow is a nice added touch in Adobe Edge Animate CC. You can find it in 
the Properties panel, as indicated in Figure 8-7.
	
Figure 8-7: 
Use the 
Overflow 
tool in the 
Properties 
panel for 
scroll bars.
	

136
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
Overflow gives you some handy ways to control the visibility of your elements. 
You can
	
✓	Add scroll bars to an element.
	
✓	Allow for content that is larger than the size of the element or Stage to 
be in one of two states:
 
• Visible: Useful when you want all of the content to appear even if it 
overflows the container (see Figure 8-9) or the Stage.
 
• Hidden: Useful when you want to hide certain content.
	
✓	Use an Auto feature in which Edge Animate determines whether to have 
scroll bars present.
	
Overflow is a CSS property. Auto, Visible, and Hidden are all values of that 
property.
When you click the drop-down arrow for the Overflow attribute in the 
Properties panel, several choices appear as shown in Figure 8-8.
	
Figure 8-8: 
Overflow 
attributes 
include 
Visible, 
Hidden, 
Scroll, and 
Auto.
	
	
You can set the Overflow properties to any type of element.
Visible Overflow property
Visible allows any overflow content (content that doesn’t fit on the Stage or 
within a container) to still appear, both on the Stage and in the browser. In 
Figure 8-9, the container is the blue-outline box with selection points.

137
 Chapter 8: Formatting Element Visibility, Positioning, and Sizing
	
Figure 8-9: 
Visible 
allows 
content that 
extends 
past the 
container to 
appear.
	
Hidden Overflow property
The Hidden Overflow property keeps any content that overflows the con­
tainer hidden from immediate view onscreen until your audience scrolls to it 
(as shown in Figure 8-10).
	
Figure 8-10: 
The Hidden 
attribute 
covers 
content that 
extends 
past the 
container.
	
Scroll Overflow property
The Scroll Overflow property inserts scroll bars into the element’s container 
or the Stage, as shown in Figure 8-11. With the scroll bars available, the user 
can scroll around within the box. Figure 8-11 shows an example.
	
Figure 8-11: 
Scroll bars

audience 
to scroll 
through text 
or other 
content.
	

138
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
Auto Overflow property
Auto enables Edge Animate to do the thinking and determine if any content 
overflows the container. If content does overflow the container, then Edge 
Animate automatically adds scroll bars (as shown in Figure 8-12). With Scroll 
enabled, the scroll bars appear both on the bottom and on the right (refer to 
Figure 8-11). However, if you use Auto, Edge Animate knows to add only the 
right scroll bar, and the bottom scroll bar won’t appear because it isn’t 
necessary.
	
Figure 8-12: 
Auto 
enables 
Edge 
Animate 
to do the 
thinking 
on adding 
scroll bars.
	
Animating with Opacity
Opacity is the condition of lacking transparency or translucence; when an 
object is opaque, you can’t see through it (you knew that). And Adobe Edge 
Animate CC enables you, through the Opacity tool, to have elements slowly 
fade in or out or simply appear as mere see-through shadows. Figure 8-13 
shows where you can find the Opacity tool on the Properties panel.
	
Figure 8-13: 
Set the 
Opacity to 
50% to make 
an element 
see-through.
	

139
 Chapter 8: Formatting Element Visibility, Positioning, and Sizing
Figure 8-14 shows an image at 50% Opacity placed over a rectangle. At 50% 
Opacity, you can see through the image and make out the rectangle behind it.
	
Figure 8-14: 
Using 
Opacity to 
allow your 
audience to 
see through 
elements.
	
Here are some quick steps on animating with Opacity. In this example, I show 
you how to make an image slowly appear on the Stage:
	
1.	Select an element on the Stage, such as an image.
	
2.	From the Properties panel, move the Opacity slider down to 0% (as 
shown in Figure 8-13).
	
3.	In the Timeline, toggle the Pin and then move the Playhead down to 
specify as long a time as you want the Opacity animation to last.
	
	 The farther you separate the Playhead from the Pin, the longer the 
animation, and the more slowly the image appears.
	
4.	With the Playhead set, go back to the Opacity slide bar and drag it up 
to 100%.
	
	 Edge Animate creates a keyframe animation sequence after you set the 
Opacity the second time.
You can now preview the Opacity animation from the Stage or in a browser.
Configuring Positioning and Sizing
Adobe Edge Animate CC has no shortage of settings when it comes to posi­
tioning and sizing. Many of these features work best when nesting elements, 
so you may want to check Chapter 10 to understand how the Element panel 
works. Positioning refers to the coordinates of the element relative either 
to the Stage or to the parent element when one element is nested inside the 
other. You can also use a position attribute to affect how you want the ele­
ment to react when you size it.

140
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
Setting the relative position
Specifying the relative position of an element affects which corner of your 
element is manipulated when you resize it. You can find the Position and Size 
attributes in the Properties panel (as shown in Figure 8-15). Be sure to select 
an element from the Stage to have these attributes appear.
	
When I refer to relative position in the context of Edge Animate, note that it 
doesn’t mean the same as relative positioning in Cascading Style Sheets (that 
is, the distinction between Position: absolute and Position: relative). In strict 
CSS terms, Edge Animate 1.0 uses only absolute positioning.
Here’s how to test the way relative position works in Edge Animate:
	
1.	Make sure the top-left corner of the element is highlighted (as 
indicated in Figure 8-15).
	
2.	Adjust the width or height of the element by using the W and H 
attributes (as indicated in Figure 8-15).
	
	 Notice that when you adjust the width or height, the top-left corner of 
the element stays where it is, while the rest of the element shrinks or 
grows.
	
3.	Select the bottom-right corner, resize the element, and see what a 
difference it makes.
	
	 The bottom-right corner stays in the same location while the other three 
corners are affected.

 Chapter 8: Formatting Element Visibility, Positioning, and Sizing
Global or Applied settings
You may wonder about the difference is between Global and Applied settings. 
Here’s the essence:
	
✓	Global settings coordinate elements relative to the Stage.
	
✓	Applied settings use underlying property values to affect elements.
I go into further detail in the next two sections to provide a better sense of 
what these properties do.
	
When you switch between Global and Applied, it affects all elements on the 
Stage. It isn’t possible to have some elements configured as Global and some 
as Applied; it’s an all-or-nothing deal. However, switching between Global and 
Applied doesn’t affect relative positioning applied to a specific element. For 
example, if you set an element with Top Right positioning, it remains in that 
setting whether you choose Global or Applied.
Using Global settings for position
When you use Global settings, the position coordinates always appear as x 
and y axis points (as shown in Figure 8-16). You can use keyframes with the 
position points, which means you can animate the position of an element; 
for example, you can have the element move from the left of the Stage to 
the right.
	
Figure 8-16: 
Global set-
tings, the 
default, 
make coor-
dinates 
appear as 
x and y axis 
points.
	

142
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
To get a better sense of how Global settings work, try the following:
	
1.	Draw four rectangles on the Stage and click Global.
	
2.	Set the first element using the top-left square as shown in Figure 8-15.
	
3.	Set the second element using the top-right square.
	
4.	Set the third element with the bottom-left square.
	
5.	Set the fourth element with the bottom right.
	
6.	Switch to the Stage by clicking an empty part of the Stage.
	
7.	Adjust the height and width of the Stage as shown in Figure 8-17.
	
	 Notice how the four different elements are affected.
When you adjust the width of the Stage, elements set with the top-right and 
bottom-right positioning are affected. When you adjust the height of the 
Stage, elements set with the bottom-left and bottom-right positioning are 
affected. The element set with the top-left positioning isn’t affected at all 
when you change the dimensions of the Stage.
	
Figure 8-17: 
Adjust the 
height and 
width of the 
Stage to see 
how that 
affects  
elements.
	
Using Applied for position
The first difference you may notice between Global and Applied is in the 
Properties panel:
	
✓	When you choose Global and then select an element, you see x and y 
axis points.
	
✓	When you choose Applied, you see axis points based on the relative 
position if one element is nested inside another element.
For more information on nesting elements, see Chapter 10.

143
 Chapter 8: Formatting Element Visibility, Positioning, and Sizing
	
You can nest certain types of elements into another element by dragging them 
over that other element.
Figure 8-18 shows an element set with Applied Top Left positioning. Notice 
the axis points are shown with L (left) and T (top). If you choose Right 
Bottom positioning, then the axis points appear as R (right) and B (bottom). 
And so on for the other positions.
	
Figure 8-18: 
Applied 
settings 
with top-left 
positioning.
	
If your element is nested inside another, as shown in Figure 8-19, then the 
relative position is shown in relation to the parent item. For example, if you 
select an ellipse that is nested inside a rectangle, then you see the position of 
the ellipse from the rectangle. If you choose Global, then you see the relative 
position from the Stage.
	
Figure 8-19: 
Nesting 
items by 
dragging 
one over 
another.
	
	
The Global and Applied settings don’t modify any settings, instead, they pro­
vide a means to display the relative positioning between nested elements.

144
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
Layout presets
Adobe Edge Animate CC conveniently provides Layout presets. You can 
select different Layout presets instead of configuring the settings yourself. 
There are different Layout presets depending on the type of element that you 
select from the Stage. There are different presets for the two major types of 
elements used in your animation:
	
✓	Text boxes and other drawn elements have their own presets.
	
✓	Images: Different settings appear depending on if the image is an img or 
a div. See Chapter 6 for more information.
	
Layout presets make more sense when the Stage’s width and height are 
formatted by percent.
Text boxes and drawn elements
The different Layout presets for text boxes and drawn elements such as 
rectangles and ellipses include these:
	
✓	Scale position: Sets elements to use % instead of px for the position (as 
shown in Figure 8-20).
	
✓	Scale size: Sets elements to use % instead of px for the size (as shown in 
Figure 8-21).

 Chapter 8: Formatting Element Visibility, Positioning, and Sizing
Images
If you have your image set as an img, then different options appear under 
Layout presets than if you set the image as a div (see Chapter 6). Both img 
and div provide the same Layout presets — scale position and scale size — 
as drawn elements.
	
Img sets the image as a regular image on the Stage. Div sets the image as a 
background image.
For regular images, you can select a Scale Image Layout preset (as described 
in Figure 8-22).
	
Figure 8-22: 
Layout 
presets 
for images 
set as img 
from the 
Properties

Images set as div that act as background images have even more options, as 
shown in Figure 8-23.

presets.
	
To get an idea of what each different Preset Layout does, simply click the box 
for the description, then click Apply.

146
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
	
There’s one more place to configure default layouts up near the main menu. If 
you click the Layout Defaults icon (as shown in Figure 8-24), a menu appears 
that enables you to select a default setting for relative positioning, px (pixels), 
or percent; you also get to choose how to use images.
	
Figure 8-24: 
Set the 
Layout 
Defaults for

and images.
	
Minimum and maximum sizing
Hidden away at the bottom of the Position and Size section of the Properties 
panel, you can find a little icon that reveals two more sizing options for set­
ting minimum width and/or maximum width (as shown in Figure 8-25).
	
The best way to use the minimum and maximum settings for an element is 
when you design a responsive web animation in which you create elements 
that change dynamically in proportion relative to the size of the Stage and 
browsers. (Chapter 12 goes into more detail on creating a responsive web 
animation.)

Animating Background Color, 
Borders, Corners, Shadows, and 
Clipping
In This Chapter
▶	Applying colors
▶	Cutting corners
▶	Enlightening shadows
▶	Clipping elements
I

n this chapter, I present many more formatting and animating options. I 
cover how to use background color for elements and how to add a border 
to elements. You can even animate the background color to transition from 
one color to another. In the same regard, you can animate the borders as well.
Adobe Edge Animate CC provides you the features necessary to animate the 
rounding-off of corners. If you want that square to turn into a circle, you can 
do that; you can also add shadows to your element. In this chapter, I show 
you a few different examples of using shadows.
Last but not least, clipping is a featured tool in Edge Animate. Use clipping to 
veil and unveil elements. This is a cool technique to use if you want text to 
gradually appear on the Stage.
Applying Color
Adobe Edge Animate CC has a few different options for using color, some of 
which are quite powerful. You can add background color to drawn elements 
such as rectangles and ellipses, but you can’t add background color to text 
boxes or images. You can also add color to borders— as well as format and 
animate the border to appear solid, dashed, or dotted. You can add colors in 

150
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
two ways: by using the Eyedropper tool to sample colors from the Stage or 
by setting RGBa, Hex, or HSLa numeric values. In addition, Animate boasts 
a robust Color Gradient tool with many options. I discuss all these features 
in the following sections. You can find the Color properties in the Properties 
panel when you have a drawn element (other than a text box) selected, as 
shown in Figure 9-1.
	
Figure 9-1: 
Color prop-
erties in the 
Properties 
Panel.
	
	
To apply background color or a border to a text box, simply place a rectangle 
with a colored background or formatted border behind the text box, as shown 
in Figure 9-2. The following section describes how to set background colors, 
which you can also use for adding color to text. (You can find the steps that 
show how to format borders in the section that follows the discussion of using 
gradient colors.)

151
 Chapter 9: Animating Background Color, Borders, Corners, Shadows, and Clipping
Using the color graph
You can choose a background color and border color in a couple of different 
spots in Adobe Edge Animate CC, as shown in Figure 9-3. You can set the 
background and border color from either up near the main menu in the 
toolbar or from the Color section in the Properties panel.
	
Figure 9-3: 
Open the 
Color prop-
erties from 
either the 
Properties 
panel or the 
near the 
main menu.
	
	
You don’t have to select the border to change its color. You set the color of 
the border just as you would set the background color. The border color icon 
is directly to the right of the background color.
You can select colors either by appearance or by numeric value.
When you click the Background Color icon or the Border Color icon, a color 
graph appears as shown in Figure 9-4. From this graph, you can choose the 
background or border color for your element.
The color graph gives you many options for picking a color. When you first 
open the color graph, the box in the top left appears gray. When you choose 
a new color, the box splits in two, showing you the current color on the left 
and the original color on the right. If you want to revert to the original color, 
simply click the right side of the box. When you find a color that you like, 
you can save it for later use by clicking the + icon near the saved colors (as 
shown in Figure 9-4).

152
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
	
Figure 9-4: 
Using the 
color graph.
	
To actually choose a color, you can click and drag the circle around the 
graph, or you can use the first slider to change the hue. The second slider 
affects how light or dark the color appears. The third slider affects transpar­
ency, which is useful if you want to see other elements that might be placed 
under the element you are adding color to. Another option is to change the 
color by typing in specific RGBa, Hex, or HSLa color values in the text box.
	
If you have an image or other element on the Stage that has a color you want 
to use, then you can use the Eyedropper tool to sample a color for use on a 
selected element. When you select the Eyedropper tool, you see a target with 
a large ring around it as shown in Figure 9-5. As the target passes over the 
Stage, the color it will sample is shown in the ring. When you pass over the 
color you like, simply right click and that color is automatically applied to the 
selected element. You can also save this color by pressing the + icon. 
You can animate the background and border color as indicated by the pres­
ence of a keyframe diamond. It’s possible, for example, to animate a rectangle 
so its background changes from red to black. Here’s a quick procedure for 
animating colors:
	
1.	Draw an element, such as a rectangle, on the Stage. Make sure the 
Auto-Keyframe Mode is on (the Stopwatch is red).
	
2.	Use the color graph from the Properties panel to choose a background 
color, such as red.
	
3.	Move the Playhead down the Timeline for as long as you want the 
animation to last.

4. 	Use the color graph to choose a new color, such as blue.
 
• If the Stopwatch is red, then you just created an animation in 
which the background color of the rectangle slowly changes from 
red to blue.
 
• If you made the sequence last long enough, you’ll see the element 
turn purple during the animation as the colors change from red 
to blue.
 
• For more precise control over which color you want to use, you 
can directly input numeric values for either RGBa, Hex, or HSLa 
values, as shown in Figure 9-4.
Using the color gradients
The Gradient Color icon is located directly to the right of the Background 
color icon in the Properties panel as shown in Figure 9-1. The Gradient color 
graph works a lot like the background color graph — but with one big, obvi­
ous difference: You can use gradient colors, meaning that you can fade a color 
from, say, a dark purple to a light purple, or from a light gold to a dark black. 
Figure 9-6 shows the Color Gradient color graph with the additional gradient 
feature on the right side.

Part III: Formatting and Animating 
	
Figure 9-6: 
Color 
Gradient 
color graph.
	
To create a gradient color, first draw a rectangle or ellipse on the Stage and 
then choose the Color Gradient icon from the Properties panel. With the 
Gradient Color graph open, choose your starting color. Animate automati­
cally picks white as your secondary color. To update the secondary color, 
click the bottom slider and then choose a second color. The element on the 
Stage updates as you change the colors so you can see the final outcome as 
you’re working. You can slide both of the sliders up and down to indicate 
where you want colors to begin and end in relation to the element.
Linear gradients
When you start choosing gradient colors, Animate picks the Linear option for 
you, with the first color appearing at the top and the second color appearing at 
the bottom. You can change this arrangement to fit your needs. For example, 
if you want the gradient color to start in the top-left corner and end in the 
bottom-right corner, you can change the gradient angle as shown in Figure 9-7. 
Simply click and drag the Gradient Angle icon or click the orange number and 
type in your preferred angle.
	
To have your gradient color pattern repeat itself, you can click the Repeat 
option at the bottom of the color graph. To help exaggerate this effect, slide 
the top and bottom sliders close together (as shown in Figure 9-8).

two slid-
ers close 
to each to

the Repeat 
effect.
	
	
You can add as many sliders — therefore as many color stops — as you like 
(as shown in Figure 9-9). That way, for example, you could have red fade into 
orange, which fades to yellow, which fades to green, which . . .  well, you get 
the idea. To add a slider, simply click inside the bar and a new slider appears. 
To remove a slider, simply click and drag the slider off the bar.

Radial gradients
If linear gradients aren’t what you are looking for then Animate also offers 
elliptical and circular gradients. Directly to the right of the linear gradient 
icon, you can find the radial gradient icon. If you long-click this icon, a menu 
appears with several radial options, as shown in Figure 9-10.
	
Figure 9-10: 
Radial 
options for 
gradient 
colors.
	
You can change the center point of where your radial gradient originates. 
For example, if you don’t want your radial gradient to start from the center of 
the element, you can adjust the X and Y axis points as shown in Figure 9-11. 

157
 Chapter 9: Animating Background Color, Borders, Corners, Shadows, and Clipping
When you change the X and Y properties, you can see the changes to the 
radial gradient appear on the Stage in real time. 
	
Figure 9-11: 
Configuring 
the center 
point of your 
radial color 
gradient.
	
You can save your gradient settings just as you can save your background 
colors. On the gradient side of the color chart, click the + icon (as shown in 
Figure 9-12), and Animate saves your current gradient settings in that row of 
vertical boxes.
	
Figure 9-12: 
Saving your 
gradient 
colors.
	

158
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
	
You can animate the colors in a gradient, but you can’t animate from a linear 
gradient to a radial gradient; you can only animate the colors — say, from gold 
to black.
Choosing a border style
You can choose the style (None, Solid, Dashed, or Dotted) for the border of 
a rectangle, rounded rectangle, or ellipse, as shown in the drop-down menu 
of Figure 9-13. You can choose whatever color you want for the border, using 
the same type of color-picker tool as for the background.
To update the width of the border, simply click the orange 0 that is located 
next to the Border Style drop-down arrow.
	
You can animate the width of the border as you can any property that has 
a diamond keyframe icon next to it. Note however, that you can’t animate 
the border type (for example, animating a solid border to become a dotted 
border).

Rounding Corners
Corner properties in Edge Animate is a powerful tool (Figure 9-14 provides 
a glimpse). The Corner properties allow you to set how much of a curve the 
borders have on your rectangles. For example, if your rectangle has square 
corners, you can use the Corners properties to round them off.

159
 Chapter 9: Animating Background Color, Borders, Corners, Shadows, and Clipping
	
Figure 9-14: 
The Corners 
properties 
allow you 
to round 
off corners 
or square 
them.
	
	
Not only can you use the Corners properties to round off square corners, 
you can also change the radius for each corner. This means you can set one 
corner square, another corner with a small radius, and another corner with a 
large radius.
One, four, or eight different points
Figure 9-15 shows a composite of the three different views of the Corners 
tool:
	
✓	Option 1 affects all four corners by changing the orange number.
	
✓	Option 4 allows you to specify the roundness of each corner individually.
	
✓	Option 8 allows you to specify the roundness of each corner, and each 
corner has two different specifications that you can adjust for roundness.
Figure 9-16 provides an extreme example of how you can change the look 
of a rectangle by manipulating eight different points. Take note of how each 
corner is contorted differently according to the settings you make from the 
Properties panel.

ferent 
configura-
tions for

angles.
	
	
By toggling the px switch, you can choose between using px or percentage to 
specify how your corners look. Also, setting the border radius to 50% creates 
a circle.
Animating rounded corners
What’s really great about the Corners tool is that you can animate how 
round, or square, the corners appear. For example, you can start with a circle 
that transforms into a square. Here’s how you can do that:
	
1.	Start off by drawing a perfect circle.
	
	 Hold down Shift while drawing the circle with the Ellipse tool to 
maintain even proportions.

161
 Chapter 9: Animating Background Color, Borders, Corners, Shadows, and Clipping
	
2.	Slide the Playhead down the Timeline to where you want the 
animation to end, leaving the Pin at the beginning of the animation.
	
3.	Select the circle and adjust the corner radius to 0.
	
	 Doing so creates an animation that transforms your circle into a square.
	
4.	Preview the animation on the Stage or in the browser.
	
This is great stuff to learn, but what if you want just the opposite — say, to 
transform a square into a circle? In that case, repeat the preceding procedure, 
and when you finish, select the keyframe animation sequence and copy it. 
Then paste the copied sequence into the Timeline using Edit, Paste Special, 
Paste Inverted (Figure 7-16).
Adding Shadows
You can create some pretty sweet animations and effects using shadows.
The Blur feature of the Shadow properties can create some interesting imag­
ery, as shown in Figure 9-17.
	
Figure 9-17: 
Experiment 
with the 
Blur prop-
erty for 
interesting 
effects.
	
Shadow properties
As an extreme example of pushing the Shadow properties to the edge, you 
can create a shadow that appears as simply blurred or as a gradient. Note, 
in Figure 9-18, that the element need not be on the Stage (and here it isn’t). 
In this section, I show you how to create an effect such as this by explaining 
each of the Clip properties.

162
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
	
Figure 9-18: 
All systems 
are “Go” in 
this Shadow 
effect.
	
To enable the Shadow tool, you must toggle the switch as indicated in 
Figure 9-19. You can choose, if you want, to configure a Drop Shadow or 
an Inset Shadow. Drop shadows appear outside the borders of the element 
(making it appear to float) and inset shadows appear along the inner edges of 
the element.
	
Figure 9-19: 
Toggling 
the Shadow 
switch to 
enable the 
properties.
	
Besides setting a drop or inset shadow, you can also configure these options:
	
✓	X and Y axis points: These settings determine exactly where the 
shadow appears in relation to the element.
	
✓	Blur: Your shadow can have anything from straight corners (0 blur) to 
an appearance of foggy haze (1000 blur).
	
✓	Spread: This setting controls how big, or how little, the shadow appears 
in relation to the element.
	
✓	Color: You can open a color graph to choose a color for the shadow.

163
 Chapter 9: Animating Background Color, Borders, Corners, Shadows, and Clipping
Animating shadows 
You can animate shadows in Adobe Edge Animate CC, and the opportunities 
it presents are pretty powerful.
Shadow does provide keyframe diamonds for each of the properties — X, Y, 
Blur, Spread — allowing you to animate shadows. In this example, I provide 
an example of an element and a shadow appearing as if they come together, 
after which the shadow shrinks to become a blurry edge of the element. 
Follow these steps to create the example:
	
1.	Select an element from the Stage and set the Shadow properties as 
shown in Figure 9-20.
	
	 On the right of the figure, you see the element is mostly off the Stage; the 
shadow has square corners and doesn’t even touch the element.
	
Figure 9-20: 
Setting the 
Shadow 
proper-
ties at one 
extreme and 
then animat-
ing to the 
other.
	
	
2.	Set the Playhead and the Pin in the Timeline so that you can create a 
keyframe animation sequence.
	
3.	Change the settings in the Shadow properties (as shown in Figure 9-21).
	
	 By changing the settings, you create a keyframe animation sequence.

164
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
	
4.	Play the animation on the Stage or in the browser. 
	
	 Note how the shadow and the element come together, and the shadow 
first softens and then frames the border.

shadow and 
element

together.
	
Using Filters
Adobe Edge Animate CC has a set of properties called Filters, which are simi­
lar to what you would find in software such as Adobe Photoshop. You can 
find these Filters in the Properties panel (as shown in Figure 9-22). You get 
the Filters properties to appear in the Properties panel by having an element 
selected. You can apply the individual Filters — Invert, Hue-Rotate, Contrast, 
Saturate, Sepia, Grayscale, Blur, and Shadow — to text boxes, drawn ele­
ments, divs, symbols, and images. You cannot apply the Filters properties to 
the Stage itself. Using the Filters properties is a versatile way to create spe­
cial effects such as fuzzing out images in the background.
You can pick and choose which Filters you want to affect your element by 
clicking the X after each Filters property you want to use. A grayed-out X indi­
cates that a particular Filters property will not affect the element; a bright X 
shows that it will affect the element.
	
The Filters properties are still highly experimental; they work best in Chrome, 
Safari, iOS 6, and Blackberry 10.

Properties.
	
Unveiling the Clipping Tool
Adobe Edge Animate CC features a Clipping tool, which you can find just 
under the main menu as shown in Figure 9-23. Clipping is an animation effect 
used to unveil or veil an onscreen element; you can animate the effect of an 
element appearing left-to-right or top-to-bottom.
Selecting the area
The following procedure demonstrates how to use the Clipping tool:
	
1.	Select an element on the Stage and then click the Clipping tool.
	
	 The element takes on a green outline, as shown in Figure 9-24.
	
2.	Click and drag the selectors (the mini squares on the outline) from the 
green box.

Figure 9-24:

tool is 
selected.
	
	
	 Doing so selects the areas of the element that you want clipped.
 
• The solid gray area inside the green outline shows which parts of 
the element are visible.
 
• The diagonal lines that create a shaded effect show which parts of 
the element will appear clipped (see Figure 9-25).
At this point, your element appears half-visible.

167
 Chapter 9: Animating Background Color, Borders, Corners, Shadows, and Clipping
	
Figure 9-25: 
A partially 
clipped 
element.
	
To undo the magic just done in the previous steps — creating an animation 
that unveils the clipped portion of the element to your audience — follow 
these steps:
	
1.	If the element isn’t already clipped, select the Clip tool and drag the 
left-middle green selector on the element all the way to the right.
	
	 Doing so completely clips the element.
	
2.	Position the Playhead and the Pin in the Timeline to designate when 
the unveiling starts and how long you want the animation to last.
	
3.	Grab the left-middle selector again and drag it to the left until the 
entire element is unclipped.
	
	 The result is an animated sequence keyframe that unveils the element.
You can watch this animation play on the Stage or preview it in a browser.
Adjusting the properties
You can use the Clip feature in animations to reveal or hide parts of an ele­
ment; you have two ways to do it. In addition to the Clipping tool, Adobe 
Edge Animate CC features a Clip section in the Properties panel that you 
can use to clip or cut off portions of an element (text, images, or whatever). 
Figure 9-26 shows the Clip section in the Properties panel.
	
You must toggle the Clip switch to enable the properties.

168
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
	
Figure 9-26: 
The default 
setting of 
the Clip 
attributes.
	
The px controls affect the element in a circular fashion: The top px (orange 
number) affects the top of the image, the right px affects the right side of the 
image, the bottom px affects the bottom of the image and the px on the left 
affects the left side of the image.
	
In order to see the green border and the clipped area, you must select the Clip 
tool (refer to Figure 9-23).
The following steps show how this use of the Clip feature works:
	
1.	Click the clipped element to select it.
	
2.	Click the Clip tool.
	
	 The element acquires a green border, and the clipped area becomes 
visible.
	
3.	Clip exactly 50 px of the element from the top down by setting the 
orange number on top to 50 and the number on the right to the width 
of the element (as shown in Figure 9-27).
	
	 Adobe Edge Animate CC is smart enough to provide the width and 
height of the element for you.
	
4.	Click the keyframe diamond to set your chosen properties in the 
Timeline.
	
	 If you don’t want to type in a number to specify how much Clip property 
to apply, you can click and drag on the orange number to increase or 
decrease the clip area.

169
 Chapter 9: Animating Background Color, Borders, Corners, Shadows, and Clipping
	
Figure 9-27: 
Click the 
diamond 
to create a 
keyframe.
	
	
5.	Set the Pin and the Playhead in the Timeline, and then set the Top 
and Left value for the Clip property to 0.
	
	 The resulting animation unveils the clipped area of the element.
You can preview the complete animation, showing both the veiling and 
unveiling of the clipped part of the element, on the Stage or in a browser.
	
If you set the bottom and the right Clip values to 0, you make the element 
invisible.

Text Boxes
In This Chapter
▶	Addressing text formatting properties
▶	Assigning HTML tags to text
▶	Animating cool text effects
I

n this Chapter, I discuss all of the different attributes and properties for 
using text boxes in your animation. Sometimes you may want to use text 
to convey a message. In Edge Animate, you can format and animate text so 
that it flows within your composition.
Although limited in capacity, the text box editor in Edge Animate is still 
rather feature-rich. While you can format each text box to show text with 
properties such as italics and bold, you can’t make only some of the words 
appear italic and bold. It’s an all-or-nothing proposition on that front. You 
can, however, tweak your animation in various ways to look the way you 
want. Here are some typical examples:
	
✓	By placing some text boxes creatively, you can arrange elements on the 
Stage so it appears that one word in a paragraph is italic while other 
words are not.
	
✓	While working in the text box editor, you can press Enter to start a new 
line of text. You can even format paragraphs to have an indent.
	
✓	You can change the look of your text by applying additional formatting 
properties such as alignment, paragraph spacing, vertical alignment, 
word spacing, and text shadows — and animate all these properties.
	
	Although text shadows don’t appear in Internet Explorer 9, they work 
fine in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and other modern browsers.

172
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
Applying Text Properties
When you create a text box, the Properties panel expands to include Text 
tools (as shown in Figure 10-1). Then you can tweak the text as described in 
this section, using basic or advanced formatting, HTML tags, and animation 
of some attributes.
	
You can nest a text box within another element that isn’t a text box (such as a 
rectangle). Note, however, that you can’t nest one text element inside another.
	
Figure 10-1: 
Use the Text 
properties 
to format 
text.
	
Basic text formatting
The basic formatting attributes for text are shown in Figure 10-1. You can 
format text the following ways:
	
✓	Choose a font: Choose any font from the drop-down list or add a new 
font. For more information about adding and selecting fonts, see 
Chapter 12.
	
	See Figure 2-7 for a list of default fonts available from the Properties 
panel.
	
✓	Set font size: You can format the text to any px, percent, or em size that 
you want (Figure 10-2):
	
• Percentage units represent percentages of the parent element’s 
font size. For Edge Animate, use % in relative terms. For example, 
if you set one text block at 100% and another text block at 50%, 

173
 Chapter 10: Animating and Formatting Text Boxes
then the latter font appears half as big as the former. For fonts, the 
parent element is the Stage itself.
 
• Px is the abbreviation for pixel units. Pixels are fixed units. One 
pixel is equal to one dot on the computer screen (the smallest 
division of your screen’s resolution).
	
	The px unit is a fixed unit, generally used when you want to print.
 
• Ems are scalable units used in websites and can adopt to screen 
resolutions. An em is equal to the current font-size, for instance, if 
the font-size of the document is 12pt, 1em is equal to 12pt. Ems are 
scalable in nature, so 2em would equal 24pt, .5em equals 6pt, and 
so on.
	
	If you want maximum scalability, you may want to use ems in your 
Adobe Edge Animate CC compositions.
	
Figure 10-2: 
Use px, %, 
or em to 
Format Text 
Size.
	
	
✓	Adding font weight: You may have noticed Edge Animate doesn’t have 
any icons to trigger bold formatting. Instead, Edge Animate uses font 
weight, which you can find directly beneath the font size. Use font weight 
to format your text with thin, light, normal, medium, or bold settings (as 
shown in Figure 10-3).
	
	To see the differences in the settings, first use 100 (Thin) and then use 
900 (Black), you should see a dramatic change in style.
	
✓	Adding color to the text: You can format the color of your text just as 
you would the background color of an element (as shown in Figure 10-4). 
For more information on using the color graph, see Chapter 9.

174

Weight for

graph.
	
	
✓	Underlining and italicizing text: You can underline and italicize text, 
but it’s an all-or-nothing deal. You can underline and/or italicize all text 
in a box or none. The procedure looks like this:

175
 Chapter 10: Animating and Formatting Text Boxes
	
1.	From the Stage, single-click the Text Box element.
	
	Don’t double-click. Doing so opens the editor box, which you don’t 
need just now.
	
2.	Choose italic, or underline, or both (as indicated in Figure 10-5).
	
	Any text in the text box now shows your chosen formatting.
	
✓	Aligning text: You can align text to the left margin, to the center, to the 
right margin, or justified (as shown in Figure 10-6).

italics and/
or underlin-
ing to text.

176
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
	
✓	Adding shadows: You can apply Shadow properties to your text for 
additional visual effect.
	
	Shadows on text don’t appear in Internet Explorer 9.
	
	For more information on using Shadow properties, see Chapter 9.
	
One thing that you cannot format from the Properties panel is bullet points. 
However, if you need to use bullets in your text, you can add them from one 
of the .js files. The JavaScript file you need to open is untitled.js, where 
untitled is the name of your project. Don’t confuse this file with the _edge­
Action.js or the _edgePreload.js files. With the correct .js file open, 
search for your text. Then edit the text as shown here:
  {
            id:’Text_1’,
            display:’none’,
            type:’text’,
            rect:[‘13px’,’64px’,’99.7%’,’50.2%’,’auto’,’auto’],
            text:”Introduction to bullet list:<ul><li>First bullet text</
li><li>Second bullet text</li><li>Last bullet text</li></ul>”,
            align:”left”,
            font:[‘Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif’,[112.5,”%”],”rgba(0,0,0,1.00)”,”
normal”,”none”,”normal”]
         },
You can add in HTML-style tags within the JavaScript, using <ul> to start the 
bullet list, and <li> for each item in the list. Don’t forget to close each item 
with </li> and end the list with </ul>.
Using HTML tags
Using HTML tags for your text can help with search engine optimization 
(SEO) and browser parsing so people can find your animation online more 
easily.
	
In practice, assigning HTML tags to your font barely affects your animation’s 
standing (beyond a slight improvement) in search engine results. Even so, 
it’s good practice to use the correct HTML tag for certain types of text, as 
outlined in the following definitions. For the most part, assigning a tag to your 
text doesn’t visibly change anything; except if you use ‘address’ (which 
makes your font italic). It’s considered a best practice to use the HTML tags 
to adhere to coding standards — and it also helps with accessibility, as when 
someone uses a screen reader.
You can find the HTML tags up near the top of the Properties panel when you 
have a text box selected. Simply click the drop-down arrow near div to open 
the menu as shown in Figure 10-7.

177
 Chapter 10: Animating and Formatting Text Boxes
	
Directly to the right of the HTML tags menu, you can find Class and Actions 
icons. (For more information about these properties, see Chapter 6.)
	
Figure 10-7: 
Assigning 
HTML tags 
to text.
	
You can assign the following HTML tags to text blocks:
	
✓	div: This is the default setting for text boxes. In CSS3, it defines a sec­
tion in a document.
	
✓	address: Address text is usually depicted with italics, which Edge 
Animate does format for you. Use this tag to define contact information.
	
✓	article: Use the article tag to define content that can stand alone 
and that you can distribute apart from the rest of your content.
	
✓	blockquote: Use this section to define a section of text that you quoted 
from elsewhere.
	
✓	p: This is the standard tag used to format paragraphs.
	
✓	h1 through h6: These are standard header tags. Use h1 for the topmost 
header and then h2 for second-level headings and so on.
	
✓	pre: Text appears in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it pre­
serves both spaces and line breaks.
	
✓	code: Use this tag when you want to display computer code.
You can assign one HTML tag to each text block. Therefore, you may want 
to use one text block for your headers (h1) and another text block for your 
paragraphs (p). Using HTML tags for text is considered a good practice for 
web development because
	
✓	It helps with screen readers, which the visually impaired use to “read” a 
screen. The screen reader uses text-to-speech software to express 
content audibly.

178
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
	
✓	Using HTML tags is considered good general coding practice.
	
✓	HTML does help, even if minimally, with SEO.
Advanced Text Formatting
Adobe Edge Animate CC offers Advanced Text Formatting properties that 
you can use to fine-tune the presentation of your text. Just click the icon indi­
cated in Figure 10-8 to reveal them in the Properties panel.

The Advanced Text Formatting options include
	
✓	Letter spacing: Defines how far apart the letters are, and how far each 
one is from the others. You’d be surprised how much onscreen space 
you can save by a judicious use of this option.
	
✓	Word spacing: Defines how much space appears between words.
	
✓	Line height: Defines how much space appears between lines of text. You 
can use this option to provide just enough space (neither too cramped 
nor or too spaced out).
	
✓	Text indent: Using this option, you can indent the first line of a text 
block to make it look more like a paragraph in a book.
You can create animations that use all of the Advanced Text Formatting 
options to achieve a more professional, polished look.

 Chapter 10: Animating and Formatting Text Boxes
Animating Text
Now, before you get carried away with the idea of animating your text, keep 
in mind that you can animate some text properties but not others. To give 
you a sense of which is which, this section lists the attributes you can 
animate — and those you can’t.
	
The animation sequences you create can use any property that has a 
keyframe diamond next to it. If you don’t see the diamond, then you can’t 
create a keyframe with that property.
Built-in animation properties
Text properties that you can animate include
	
✓	Size
	
✓	Color
	
✓	All the spacing (Advanced Text Formatting) properties, including
 
• Letter spacing
 
• Word spacing
 
• Line height
 
• Text indent
The following procedure provides an example of animating text so that it 
changes size, color, and spacing:
	
1.	Use the Text tool to draw a text box on the Stage and type in some 
text.
	
	 Note that if you press Enter, you start a new line. To close the text box 
editor, click the X or click the Stage.
	
2.	Format the text by changing the color, size, and letter spacing as 
shown in Figure 10-9. Simply select the text box, and leave the text 
box editor closed, to format the text.
	
	 You have to double-click the text box to open the editor, so use only a 
single click to select the text box.
	
3.	Toggle the Pin and move the Playhead down the Timeline away from 
the Pin.

Part III: Formatting and Animating 
	
Figure 10-9: 
Editing the 
text 
properties.
	
	
4.	Reset the properties that you changed in Step 2 back to their defaults.
	
	 As you change each setting, the properties appear in the Timeline (as 
shown in Figure 10-10).
	
Figure 10-10: 
Properties 
appear-
ing in the 
Timeline.
	
You can preview the animation on the Stage or in the browser.
	
The keyboard shortcut for previewing in the browser is Ctrl+Enter.
Other animation effects
Text properties that don’t show a keyframe diamond (and so can’t be directly 
animated) include

181
 Chapter 10: Animating and Formatting Text Boxes
	
✓	Weight
	
✓	Italics and underlining
	
✓	Alignment
Even though Edge Animate doesn’t have keyframes for these properties, you 
can still create animation sequences that mimic that behavior.
In the following steps, I show how to create a workaround for animating 
properties that don’t have keyframes assigned to them — in this case, 
animating a change in the weight of text:
	
1.	Create a text box on the Stage and type in some text. Then close the 
text box editor.
	
2.	Set the font weight to 100 (Thin). (See Figure 10-3.)
	
3.	Toggle the Pin and slide the Playhead down the Timeline away from 
the Pin.
	
4.	Change the opacity from 100% to 0%. (Refer to Figure 8-13.)
	
	 You just created an animated sequence in which your text disappears.
	
5.	Copy and paste the text element.
	
	 By doing so, you’re placing an identical text box on top of the existing 
text box.
	
6.	For the new text box, set the Opacity to 0% and the font weight to 900 
(Black).
	
7.	Slide both the Pin and the Playhead together (place the cursor over 
the orange bar with chevrons, then click and drag) down the Timeline 
so that the Pin is at the end of the first animation sequence and the 
Playhead is farther down the Timeline.
	
8.	Adjust the Opacity back to 100% to create an animation sequence in 
which the bold text gradually appears.
You can view this animation from the Stage or preview in a browser. You 
should see the thin-weighted font fade out and then see the text fade back in 
with a heavier weight.
If you want more of an abrupt change from Thin to Bold, here’s how to do that:
	
1.	 Create a text box, type in some text, and then close the text editor.
	
2.	From the Properties panel, change the Visibility from Always On to On.
	
3.	Change the font weight to Thin.
	
4.	Copy and paste the text box.

182
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
	
5.	In the Elements panel (top-right of the interface), rename the first text 
box to Thin and the second text box to Bold so you can remember 
which is which.
	
6.	Select the Bold text box and set the Visibility to Off.
	
7.	Drag the Playhead and the Pin (don’t toggle the Pin) together down 
the Timeline to the point at which you want the font weight to change.
	
8.	From the Elements panel, choose the Thin text box and set the 
Visibility to Off.
	
9.	From the Elements panel, select the Bold text box, set Visibility to On, 
and set the weight to 900 (Black).
Because you never toggled the Pin, you didn’t create any keyframe animation 
sequences. However, you did create keyframe diamonds in the Timeline (as 
shown in Figure 10-11).
	
Figure 10-11: 
Keyframe 
animations 
without an 
animation 
sequence.
	
When you preview this animation, you should see the thin text appear and 
then abruptly change to bold.
You can use these same two procedures to mimic animations for italics, 
underlining, and alignment. The accompanying sidebar describes an experi­
ment of mine.
Mimicking the Star Wars Text Crawl
I was going through the Adobe Edge Animate 
CC Facebook page (this was in mid-April 2013) 
and I saw a post about someone creating an 
animation that looked just like the text crawl 
you see at the beginning of Star Wars movies. 
I attempted to re-create this effect, using just 
Edge Animate. 
The only thing I couldn’t truly replicate was 
using a 3D transform tool to make the text 
appear as if it were lying back on a flat surface 
and moving away from the viewer. Instead, 
I shrank the text gradually as it entered from 
the bottom of the screen, slowly scrolled up, 
and then exited the top of the screen. You can 
see the final result here: http://goo.gl/

Chapter 11
Using the Elements Panel
In This Chapter
▶	Using the Elements panel to organize and work with elements
▶	Using the Timeline in conjunction with the Elements panel
T

he Elements panel is located in the top-right corner of the screen. You 
can do a number of things from the Elements panel, including selecting 
elements, opening actions for an element, setting the visibility of an element, 
locking an element, and nesting one element into another element. You can 
also name, or label, elements from the Elements panel.
The Elements panel remains empty until you create your first element, such 
as a text box or a rectangle, or you import an image. However, you can 
always see the Stage in the Elements panel.
Operating in the Elements Panel
The Elements panel provides a useful means to help organize and work with 
elements. From the Elements panel, you can do several things:
	
✓	Add actions
	
✓	Set visibility
	
✓	Lock elements
	
✓	Nest elements
The Elements panel updates along with the Timeline and vice versa, which 
is discussed in the next section. You can find the Elements panel in the top-
right corner of the interface (as shown in Figure 11-1).

Figure 11-1: 
The default 
view of the 
Elements

the Stage.
	
Managing Stage actions
Chapter 5 discusses actions in detail, along with triggers that you can add 
to the Stage, but here I discuss how to use actions for the Stage from the 
Elements panel.
Adding Stage actions
To open the Actions box from the Elements panel, simply click the Open 
Actions icon, which is shown in Figure 11-2 along with a full list of all possible 
actions that you can add to the Stage.
The first nine actions listed in Figure 11-2 are unique to the Stage. The 
remaining actions — from click to focus — are used for elements as well. You 
can find a description of those actions in Chapter 5.
For some of these Stage actions, a designer with no coding experience 
may want to shy away from using certain actions that are code-intensive. 
However, even code-wary designers can use some Stage actions, such as 
keydown and keyup, to good effect. After a list of definitions, I provide some 
quick steps for using keydown and keyup.
Here is a brief description of what you can do with each of the Stage actions:
	
✓	creationComplete: Fires immediately after a Symbol is created and ini­
tialized but before autoPlay occurs.
	
✓	beforeDeletion: Fires just before a Symbol is deleted.
	
✓	compositionReady: Fires after the composition is ready to play but 
before autoPlay occurs.
	
✓	keydown: Fires after the user presses an assigned key (find the example 
code after Figure 11-2).
	
✓	keyup: Fires after the user stops pressing an assigned key.
	
✓	scroll, orientationchange, and resize: These are page-level events.
	
✓	onError: Fires when an event handler causes a JavaScript error.

185
 Chapter 11: Using the Elements Panel
	
For more information on these Stage actions, see the Adobe Edge Animate 
JavaScript API, which is available at
www.adobe.com/devnet-docs/edgeanimate/api/current/index.html
	
Figure 11-2: 
Create 
Stage 
actions 
from the 
Elements 
panel.
	
	
The following example code works with a keydown Stage action. All of the 
code preceded by double slashes (//) are notes to help explain what the 
code does. The actual code starts with if. After you choose keydown on the 
Actions menu, you must then choose how you want that action triggered. In 
this example, I chose Play. Before I chose Play, however, I placed the cursor 
directly after the bracket (and then pressed Enter on the keyboard to start a 
new line, then pressed Tab for the correct spacing), because that is where I 
want to insert the Play code (highlighted in bold). In this example, the anima­
tion plays when the user presses the spacebar.
// insert code to be run when the user presses a key.
// The variable “e.which” tells you the key code of the key that was pressed, 
e.g. 32 = space
if (e.which == 32) {
    sym.play();
    // do something
}

186
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
The following example code uses keyup, which works in the same manner as 
keydown. Now, when the user releases the spacebar, the animation stops.
// insert code to be run when the user stops pressing a key.
// The variable “e.which” tells you the key code of the key that was pressed, 
e.g. 13 = enter
if (e.which == 32) {
    sym.stop();
    // do something
}
	
You can use a particular Stage action only once per composition.
Adding audience control
In the following procedure, I explain how to use Stage actions to allow your 
audience to both start and stop an animation from playing by pressing and 
then releasing the spacebar.
	
1.	Start a new composition. From the Properties panel, in the Stage sec­
tion, uncheck Autoplay.
	
2.	Create a simple animation on the Stage, such as a rectangle moving 
from left to right.
	
3.	From the Elements panel, click Open Actions next to Stage and choose 
keydown.
	
4.	In the code box, place the cursor after the bracket (press Enter to start 
a new line and then Tab over) and then choose Play from the menu on 
the right side.
	
	 Your code should look like the example shown earlier in the Technical 
Stuff note.
	
5.	In the code box, click the + icon (near the top left) and choose keyup.
	
	 This step creates a second action for the Stage.
	
6.	Place the cursor after the bracket, like you did in Step 4, but this time, 
choose Stop.
	
7.	Close the code box to save your changes.
	
If you preview from the Stage, the animation simply plays as though you didn’t 
add the actions. To see your Stage actions in operation, you must preview 
them in a browser. To get the animation to start, press and hold the spacebar. 
To stop the animation from playing, release the spacebar.

187
 Chapter 11: Using the Elements Panel
Setting visibility
The third icon in the Elements panel, after the actions and the color bar, 
looks like an eye. You can click this icon to set the visibility of an element. 
Figure 11-3 shows elements that are visible and that aren’t visible. When an 
element isn’t visible, the eye turns into a circle.
	
Figure 11-3: 
Setting 
element  
visibility.
	
When you turn the visibility off for an element, it no longer appears on the 
Stage. However, keyframes for invisible elements still appear in the Timeline.
If you preview the animation in a browser, all of the elements appear, regard­
less of how the element visibility is set.
	
Don’t confuse the Visibility feature with the Display feature, which is discussed 
in Chapter 8. Here are the differences between the two:
	
✓	Visibility: Refers to showing or hiding elements on the Stage. You can 
hide elements on the Stage to reduce clutter. All invisible elements still 
appear when you preview in a browser. Visibility is used as part of the 
editing process for uncluttering the Stage.
	
✓	Display: Refers to whether the element appears or not, both on the 
Stage and in the Preview. Display is used in the animation creation 
process.
	
When you click the eye-icon of a parent element that contains nested ele­
ments, the child element’s visibility is also affected, as shown in Figure 11-4. 
However, clicking the eye of a child element doesn’t affect the parent element. 
You can set the visibility of nested elements separately. If you turn off the vis­
ibility of a parent element, the child element’s Visibility icon is dimmed.

188
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
	
Figure 11-4: 
The child 
element 
whose 
parent is 
invisible 
appears 
with a 
dimmed eye.
	
Locking elements
You can lock elements from the Elements panel. Locking an element means 
that you can’t edit that element.
	
This is useful if you have an element that overlaps another element and you 
don’t want to accidentally select and start editing or moving that element.
When you want to lock an element in place so that you don’t accidentally 
change it, click the circle to the right of the eyeball (Visibility icon). Locked 
elements have a lock icon next to them, as shown in Figure 11-5.
	
Figure 11-5: 
Lock 
elements 
so that you 
don’t acci-
dentally 
edit them.
	
Nesting elements
When you nest elements, you create a hierarchy of parent and child ele­
ments. The top-level element becomes the parent and the second-level ele­
ment becomes the child. Nesting is useful if you want the parent element to 
affect the child element in terms of position and size and other properties.

189
 Chapter 11: Using the Elements Panel
To nest one element within another, simply click and drag one element into 
another element. The element that you click and drag becomes the child, and 
the element that you dragged it into becomes the parent.
The parent element has a drop-down arrow that you can use to display or 
hide the child elements. Figure 11-6 shows nested elements, with the drop-
down arrow showing the child elements and a parent element with the child 
element rolled up.
	
Figure 11-6: 
Nest  
elements 
to create 
parent and 
child 
elements.
	
	
Edge Animate has nesting rules:
	
✓	You can
 
• Nest rectangles into other rectangles.
 
• Nest images into a rectangle.
 
• Nest text boxes into rectangles.
 
• Have tiers of nest boxes.
	
✓	You can’t
 
• Nest one text box into another text box.
 
• Nest images into a text box.
 
• Nest rectangles into text boxes.
Coordinating with the Timeline
The Timeline and the Elements panel work hand-in-hand. When you make 
changes in one, you see the same changes appear in the other. For example, 
if you name an element in the Elements panel, that name appears in the 
Timeline. However, if you nest elements, you can see that effect in the 
Elements panel, but you won’t see the nesting in the Timeline. Rather, in the 
Timeline, you see the keyframe properties for an element, which you don’t 
see in the Elements panel.

190
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
Features that are coordinated between the Elements panel and the Timeline 
include the following:
	
✓	Color-coordinated elements
	
✓	Copy and paste elements
	
✓	Naming elements
The Elements panel and the Timeline both have narrow colored bars for 
each element. These colored bars provide you with a visual clue about which 
element is which when you’re looking back and forth between the Elements 
panel and the Timeline.
When you have several keyframes in the Timeline, the color coding becomes 
a significant aid in coordinating which elements in the Elements panel corre­
late with which keyframes in the Timeline (see Figure 11-7).
	
Figure 11-7: 
Color-
coordinated 
elements 
in the 
Elements 
panel.
	
Copying and pasting
Just as you can copy and paste elements from the Timeline, you can copy 
and paste elements from the Elements panel: Simply right-click an element 
and choose Copy (or press Ctrl+C). Then right-click and choose Paste (or 
press Ctrl+V).
	
When you copy and paste elements, Edge Animate follows these rules:
	
✓	When you paste an element, it retains the same properties as the one 
that you copied.
	
✓	Keyframe animation sequences associated with a copied element don’t 
copy over.
	
✓	If you copy a parent element, you also copy the child element; therefore, 
when you paste, you create copies of both the child and the parent.

191
 Chapter 11: Using the Elements Panel
	
✓	If you copy a child element, you don’t also copy the parent element.
	
✓	When you paste an element, Edge Animate gives it the same name as the 
copied element but appends Copy to the end (see Figure 11-8).
	
Figure 11-8: 
Copied 
elements 
have the 
same name 
except for 
the word 
Copy.
	
Naming elements
Giving elements names other than Text, RoundRect, or RoundRect2 is useful 
if you have a complicated Timeline with many elements. By naming elements, 
you create an easy way to find and select elements from both the Timeline 
and the Elements panel.
	
Give elements relevant names. For example, if you have a rectangle that you 
want to use as a menu bar, name that element, Menu bar. If you name it Long 
Rectangle Along the Top, not only does Edge Animate truncate that name 
(along with adding underscores between each word; because spaces in names 
are not allowed), but also it may become confusing later if you add a second 
long rectangle along the top of your animation.
	
The “Name” is used by Edge Animate as an ID in the HTML markup. What you 
type in as “Name” in the Elements panel shows in the ID attribute of the HTML 
element in the HTML markup. IDs have specific naming conventions, one of 
them is that IDs cannot contain spaces. They also can’t start with a number; 
here’s a URL that provides additional information:
www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html#type-id
To name your element, simply double-click it from the Elements panel, and 
then type a name as shown in Figure 11-9.

192
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
	
Figure 11-9: 
Double-click 
an element 
to name it.
	
	
Follow these rules for naming elements:
	
✓	Give it a short name so you can see the full name in the Elements box.
	
✓	Give it a relevant name and not something cute and funny. That way, 
you know what that element is six months later when you reopen your 
project.
	
✓	Don’t use spaces or odd characters when naming an element. If you do, 
a blue icon appears, with the information shown in Figure 11-10.

Use only 
unaccented 
letters and 
numbers 
with no 
spaces.
	

Chapter 12
Using the Library Panel
In This Chapter
▶	Importing images without adding them to the Stage
▶	Applying Symbols effectively
▶	Selecting fonts
T

he Library panel provides an easy way to work effectively with images, 
Symbols, and fonts. In this chapter, I discuss how to add images to the 
Library panel without adding them to the Stage.
I also provide details on working with Symbols— which may appear daunting 
at first, but once you get the hang of it, you realize Symbols are true 
timesavers. That’s especially true if you tend to use the same types of 
Symbols (such as buttons or menu items) on a regular basis.
Last, but certainly not least, I delve in to the details on working with and 
adding fonts to Adobe Edge Animate CC. By using the web, you can find and 
use thousands of fonts, and most likely you can use them all in your 
animation.
Positioning Images
The Library panel is a great place to view all of your assets, or images, in one 
spot. You can use the Library panel in association with images in the following 
ways:
	
✓	Import multiple images at once without having them appear on the 
Stage.
	
✓	Drag images onto the Stage from the Library panel.
	
✓	Image filenames remain consistent in the Library panel even if you 
rename them in the Elements panel.
	
✓	You don’t delete or rename images in the Library panel.

194
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
You can find the Library panel on the right side of the interface (see Figure 12-1).
	
Figure 12-1: 
Use the 
Library 
panel for 
Assets, 
Symbols, 
and Fonts.
	
Adding images
You can add images a few different ways in Edge Animate, including the 
following:
	
✓	Drag and drop from your desktop to the Stage.
	
✓	Import from the main menu (refer to Chapter 3).
	
✓	Use the Library panel.
You can use the Library panel to import more than one image at a time. 
Simply gather all the images you want to use for your project into a single 
folder; then click the + icon next to Assets. When you do so, you can then 
navigate your hard drive to find and select images to import into your 
composition. After you select the images you want to import, they appear in 
the Library panel (as shown in Figure 12-2).
	
Figure 12-2: 
Use the 
Library 
panel to

images 
without 
them 
appear-
ing on the 
Stage.
	

195
 Chapter 12: Using the Library Panel
	
One of the differences between importing images from the Library panel and 
importing them via the main menu is that the images don’t appear on the 
Stage and the Timeline. That way, you have your images ready for use, but 
they don’t litter your Stage.
After you have images in the Library panel, you can click and drag them onto 
the Stage. You can double-click the name of the image to rename it if you so 
desire.
	
If you right-click an image from the Library panel, you can open the images 
folder associated with your composition, as shown in Figure 12-3.
	
Figure 12-3: 
Navigate 
to the 
folder from 
which you 
imported the 
image.
	
Deleting and renaming images
Believe it or not, you don’t delete nor rename images in the Library panel. 
Instead, you must use either the Timeline or the Elements panel — and 
before doing that, you have to add the image to the Stage. You can add an 
image to the Stage from the Library panel with a click and a drag.
When you move an image from the Library panel to the Stage, it becomes an 
element and — like all elements — it appears in both the Elements panel and 
the Timeline. Once an image becomes an element, you can rename it and/or 
delete it, as with any other element.
	
Even if you rename or delete an image element, it remains in the Library panel, 
but you can rename it or delete it from the Timeline and the Elements panel. 
To completely remove an image, first remove all instances of the image from 
the Stage. Then, from the Library panel, choose Reveal in finder. Then you can 
delete the images from your hard drive.

196
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
Administering Symbols
You can create complex Symbols with rich functionality that you may need 
when you start developing complicated compositions. On the flip side, you 
can also create basic Symbols for everyday use.
	
Basically, Symbols allow you to create nested animations with independent 
timelines and interactive capabilities. In this section, I discuss turning ele­
ments into Symbols; editing Symbols; working with Symbols and labels; and 
finally how to save, export, and import Symbols.
Although Symbols do have a different workflow from that of elements, once 
you’re comfortable working with them, you won’t have any problems at all.
Creating Symbols
To create a Symbol, follow these steps:
	
1.	Create an element such as a text box, a rectangle, or an imported 
image.
	
	 See Chapter 3 for more information on creating elements.
	
2.	Convert the element to a Symbol.
	
	 You have three choices on how to convert that element into a Symbol:
 
• Right-click the element from the Stage (as shown in Figure 12-4) to 
access a list of options. From that list, choose Convert to Symbol.
 
• Select an element on the Stage and then click the + next to Symbols 
in the Library panel (as shown in Figure 12-5).
 
• Use the keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Y or ⌘+Y (Mac).
	
3.	Name the Symbol in the Create Symbol box (see Figure 12-6).
	
	 You have to play by the rules when you name a Symbol: no spaces and 
no accented letters or numbers. You can use an underscore, though.
	
	 Leave Autoplay Timeline checked if you want any animations you create 
for this Symbol to automatically play in the Timeline. Uncheck this box if 
you don’t want any animations to automatically play.
	
	 If you want a particular part of your composition to play only if an action 
is triggered, then you do not want a Symbol to play automatically in the 
Timeline. For example, you can create a Symbol that plays only if your 
audience clicks a button.

After you create a Symbol, it appears in the Library panel (as shown in 
Figure 12-7). You can then drag it on the Stage for repeated instances, save 
it for use in another composition, or copy and paste it directly into another 
project.

properties

Editing Symbols
After you create a Symbol, you can edit it with a right-click and then choose 
Edit Symbol. If you right-click from the Stage, you see the options shown in 
Figure 12-9.
If you right-click a Symbol from the Library panel, you see another set of 
options, as shown in Figure 12-10.

panel.
	
While you’re in Edit mode for a Symbol, the Stage turns gray and bread­
crumb-type navigation appears in the top-left corner of the Stage, as indi­
cated in Figure 12-11. In this example, Stop_button is the name of the 
Symbol. When you’re editing a Symbol while the Stage is gray, edits you make 
affect only the Symbol’s independent Timeline and not the composition’s 
overall Timeline.
	
While in Edit mode for Symbols, you can get back to the Stage simply by click­
ing Stage from the breadcrumb navigation (as highlighted in Figure 12-11).

Adding features
Symbols have their own Timeline, which works in conjunction with the main 
Timeline. As a result, Edge Animate provides specific features for use with 
Symbols, including the following:
	
✓	A Scrub check box
	
✓	Playback actions for Symbols
	
✓	Labels
Disabling animation
A Symbol’s Timeline allows you to stop a Symbol’s animation sequences from 
playing while you view an animation from the Stage.
In the Playback section of the Properties panel, you can find a Scrub check 
box (see Figure 12-12). The Scrub check box controls how animation appears 
on the Stage:
	
✓	If you leave the Scrub box checked, the Symbol’s animation sequences 
unfold on the Stage.
	
✓	If you uncheck the Scrub box, the Symbol’s animation sequences don’t 
appear on the Stage.
	
Regardless of the Scrub box, you see all the animations when you preview in 
the browser.

Scrub box to

animations

ing on the 
Stage.
	
Adding playback actions
Adding playback actions to Symbols is easy to do from the Properties panel. 
You can think of playback actions as a type of trigger for Symbols. Figure 12-13 
shows the list of options that you can use, including Play and Stop.
	
Figure 12-13: 
Add 
playback 
actions to 
insert a type 
of trigger for 
Symbols.
	
When you select a Symbol from the Stage and then choose a playback action, 
Edge Animate inserts an icon into the Timeline, as indicated in Figure 12-14. 
In addition to inserting a playback action from the Properties panel, you can 
also create a playback action from the Timeline, as highlighted in the figure.

202
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
	
Figure 12-14: 
An icon 
appears in 
the Timeline 
when you 
select a 
playback 
action.
	
	
For best use of playback actions, create an animation sequence for the 
Symbol; otherwise there’s nothing to stop, play, play from, and so on.
To edit the playback action from the Timeline, simply double-click the icon, 
you can then edit the time and the action (shown in Figure 12-15).
	
Figure 12-15: 
Edit the 
playback 
action by 
double-
clicking the 
icon in the 
Timeline.
	
You can also use labels with playback actions, as discussed next.
Labeling
You can use labels (which I cover in detail in Chapter 5) in association with 
playback actions. The difference between using labels with elements as com­
pared to Symbols is that you have to place the label in the Timeline while in 
edit mode for the Symbol. Otherwise the label option (as shown in Figure 12-15) 
appears dim. Follow these steps to use labels with playback actions:
	
1.	Create a Symbol on the Stage that has an animation sequence.
	
2.	Right-click the Symbol and choose Edit Symbol.
	
3.	Position the Playhead in the Timeline where you want the label to 
appear.
	
4.	On the main menu, click Timeline and then Insert Label.
	
5.	Name your label in the Timeline.

203
 Chapter 12: Using the Library Panel
	
6.	Exit Symbol Edit mode by going back to the Stage (click Stage from 
the breadcrumb navigation found above the Ruler).
	
	 The label you just created disappears from the Timeline, but don’t 
worry, it’s still there.
	
7.	Add a playback action and then open it for editing.
	
	 When you choose From or At playback actions, the label option 
becomes active, as shown in Figure 12-16 where I named the label Start 
Show.
	
	 When you close this box, the name of the label appears in the Timeline 
next to the Playback Action icon.
	
Figure 12-16: 
Choose 
a Symbol 
label 
instead of 
using a spe-
cific time.
	
You can preview playback actions on the Stage (provided you left Autoplay 
checked while editing the Symbol), or you can preview in the browser.
To change the location of the Symbol label in the Timeline, go back to Symbol 
Edit mode and drag the label up and down the Timeline.
Exporting and importing Symbols
Adobe knows that as an animator, you probably like to reuse commonly used 
Symbols, such as a slideshow, so Adobe made it very easy for you to:
	
✓	Save Symbols: Right-click an element and choose Convert to Symbol 
(shown earlier in Figure 12-4).
	
✓	Export Symbols: Right-click a Symbol from the Library panel or the 
Stage and then choose Export (shown earlier in Figure 12-10).
	
✓	Import Symbols: In the Library panel, click the + icon and choose Import 
Symbols (see Figure 12-17).

204
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
	
Figure 12-17: 
Import 
Symbols 
from the 
Library 
panel.
	
	
You can copy and paste a Symbol from one project to another. Simply select the 
Symbol from the Stage, copy it, and then open another project and paste it in.
Managing Fonts
Adobe Edge Animate CC provides myriad ways to use and add different fonts 
to your composition. In this section, I discuss the following:
	
✓	Selecting different default fonts from either the Properties panel or the 
Library panel
	
✓	Adding new fonts from a variety of sources
When it comes to font choices, you won’t be at a loss.
Selecting fonts
Adobe Edge Animate CC allows you to choose fonts from a default fonts list, 
as shown in Figures 2-7 and 12-19, which is accessible from the Properties 
panel after you create and select a text box (refer to Chapter 10 for more on 
animating and formatting text). These fonts include the standards, such as 
Georgia, Verdana, and Times New Roman.
The Library panel also has another set of fonts from which you can choose. 
To open this menu, follow these steps:
	
1.	Click the + next to Fonts in the Library panel, as shown in Figure 12-18.
	
	From here, you can choose an Edge Web Font, or click the Custom tab to 
add a new font. If you choose an Edge Web Font, simply select the font 
that you like and then click Add Font at the bottom of the box.

205
 Chapter 12: Using the Library Panel
	
Figure 12-18: 
Click the + 
to start the 
process of 
adding a 
web font.
	
	
2.	If you clicked the Custom tab, then click the + next to the Font 
Fallback List.
	
	 Doing so opens up another list of fonts you can choose.
	
Figure 12-19:

Fallback 
List from 
the Library 
panel.
	
	
3.	Choose a font from the list; then click Add Font.
	
	 The font you chose appears in the Library panel, as shown in Figure 12-20.
	
After you add a font in the Library panel, you can click and drag the name of 
the font onto the Stage. When you do so, Edge Animate creates a text box for 
you that is pre-populated with text.

206
Part III: Formatting and Animating 
	
Figure 12-20: 
Fonts that 
you add 
appear in 
the Fonts 
section of 
the Library 
panel.
	
After you drag a font name onto the Stage, that font also becomes available in 
the Properties panel when you have a text box selected.
	
You can also add web fonts from Font Squirrel, fonts.com, and other types 
of available web fonts to your Edge Animate composition — using the same 
basic procedure described in the next section on using Google web fonts.
Adding Google web fonts
If you’re a fan of Google web fonts, or you’re simply tired of using the same 
old font that everyone else uses, then you can add a Google web font to your 
Edge Animate composition.
	
As of this writing, Google boasts 624 (and counting) different web fonts from 
which you can choose.
To add a Google web font, follow these steps:
	
1.	Use a web browser to visit the Google Web Font site (www.google.
com/webfonts) and pick a font you like.
	
2.	When you find a font you like, click Quick-Use, as shown in Figure 12-21.
	
Figure 12-21: 
Select a 
Google web 
font.
	
	
	 Depending on the font you chose, you may have the option to customize 
the font with various attributes.

207
 Chapter 12: Using the Library Panel
	
	 You also see a Page Load indicator, as shown in Figure 12-22. This tells 
you whether the font loads quickly or slowly onto your web page. My 
example font has a fast page-load time.
	
Figure 12-22: 
Page Load 
indicator.
	
	
	 Consider using fonts that have a fast page-load time for a couple reasons:
 
• If your page takes more than a few seconds to load, visitors will 
leave. They want the page to load quickly.
 
• Google uses page-loading times in its algorithms to determine 
search results. You don’t want your search results hurt based on 
the fonts you chose.
 
• Also, use only styles that you really need. The more styles you 
add, the slower the page load.
	
3.	With the font customized, scroll down the page until you see a bit of 
code, as shown in Figure 12-23; copy this code.
	
Figure 12-23: 
Copy the 
Google web 
font code.
	
	
4.	If Edge Animate isn’t open, open it now.
	
5.	In the Library panel, click the + Symbol next to Fonts.
	
	The Font box opens. Click the Custom tab.
	
6.	In the Embed Code box, paste the code that you copied in Step 3.
	
7.	Type the name of the font in the Font Fallback List, as shown in 
Figure 12-24.

Google 
web font’s 
code into 
the Embed 
Code box 
and name 
the font in 
the Font 
Fallback 
List.
	
	
8.	Click Add Font.
	
	 You’re done!
Now that you’ve added a custom font, when you click the font drop-down 
arrow from the Properties panel, you can select your custom font from the 
list (see Figure 12-25).

Chapter 13
Creating a Project Structure
In This Chapter
▶	Automating the project structure
▶	Editing files
▶	Structuring folders and files for use with other software
A

dobe Edge Animate provides the means for you to create animations 
for the web, for use with InDesign and Muse, and for tools like Apple’s 
iBooks Author. You can save your compositions in any number of ways, 
depending on how you set your publishing settings.
In this chapter, I discuss the folder structure that Edge Animate creates 
and the files within those folders. I make these explanations worthwhile by 
explaining what you can do with all these files.
Understanding the Files 
Edge Animate Creates
When you save your Adobe Edge Animate project, the software creates sev­
eral different files and folders. In addition to a special folder for your images, 
Edge Animate creates an edge_includes folder. I cover all these folders 
here in this section along with details about the different files that Edge 
Animate creates.
	
Even if you are strictly an animator and don’t know a single thing about code, 
I still recommend that you gain a familiarity with what makes Adobe Edge 
Animate tick. After all, you never know when you may have to dig in to the 
file and folder structure to find something in particular or to tweak a line of 
code. Here, I walk you through the basics, so you can understand what Edge 
Animate creates as output.
Figure 13-1 shows a sample file and folder structure.

212
Part IV: Putting Your Animation to Use 
	
Figure 13-1: 
Edge 
Animate 
creates an 
entire file 
and folder 
structure 
for you.
	
Saving your composition
You can work and preview compositions in Edge Animate without saving 
your work. However, the software doesn’t create files or folders until you 
click Save. When you do save your work, Edge Animate creates an entire 
structure of folders and files for you.
To save your work, click File on the main menu and then choose Save or 
choose Save As to save under a different filename (see Figure 13-2).
	
Figure 13-2: 
Saving your 
work from 
the File 
menu.
	
	
Before you save your work, create a folder on your hard drive in which you 
want to save your work. You don’t necessarily have to create a special folder 
just for your images, though this is generally considered a best practice. Even 
if you import your images from several different locations, when you save 
your work, Edge Animate groups all your assets together and organizes them 
for you in a folder structure.

213
 Chapter 13: Creating a Project Structure
Animate files
When you save your work, one of the files that Edge Animate creates is called 
an Animate file. All Animate files are designated with the extension .an. For 
example, myfirstproject.an, or index.an.
Figure 13-3 shows how the Animate file appears (it has the purple square icon 
next to it) in your folder structure in Windows.
	
Figure 13-3: 
You can 
recognize 
the Animate 
files by 
the purple 
square icon.
	
If you click the .an file from the folder structure, Edge Animate boots up, and 
your project opens.
JavaScript files
Edge Animate actually creates two sets of JavaScript files for you when you 
save your project:
	
✓	One set of files is found in the edge_includes folder, as I discuss later 
in the chapter in the section “Edge_includes folder.”
	
✓	The other JavaScript files are found alongside the Animate file and the 
HTML file.
	
	Figure 13-4 shows an example of what these JavaScript files look like in 
the folder structure.
	
Figure 13-4: 
JavaScript 
plays an 
important 
role in 
making 
animations.
	

214
Part IV: Putting Your Animation to Use 
If you try to open these JavaScript files by clicking them, you may get an 
error message. The different example JavaScript files shown in Figure 13-4 do 
the following:
	
✓	index_edge: In this example, the name of the project is index. Therefore, 
the name for each JavaScript file starts with the name of the project.
	
	Within this particular JavaScript file, you can find definitions for symbols.
	
✓	index_edgeActions: This file contains JavaScript code for the actions 
you created within the composition.
	
	For more information on adding actions to your composition see 
Chapters 5 (working with actions in general) and 11 (working with stage 
actions from the Elements panel).
	
✓	index_edgePreload: This file contains JavaScript code for the 
preloader.
	
	For more information on preload, see Chapter 14.
	
Don’t open and play around with the JavaScript files unless you’ve had experi­
ence coding JavaScript. Designers and animators without coding experience 
really don’t have to open these files at all.
If you want to open these files just to see what the code looks like, open them 
with Notepad or other similar plain text applications. In Windows 7, you can 
right-click the JavaScript file and then choose Edit from the menu. When you 
do so, the JavaScript file opens in Notepad.
	
You can edit JavaScript code directly from something like a plain text editor. 
The changes that you save do affect your composition.
	
You can find the code that you write or edit for actions, triggers, and so forth 
while in Edge Animate in the JavaScript_edgeActions file. For example, 
say that you add an action to a rectangle (such as Play From) so that the code 
in the Edge Animate code editor looks like this:
sym.play();
// play the timeline from the given position (ms or label)
sym.play(1000);
If you save the project and then open the JavaScript_edgeActions file in 
a plain text editor, you should see the above code in that file. You can now 
edit this code. If you want the action to start playing at the 2-second mark 
instead of the 1-second mark, simply edit 1000 to 2000. Then save and close 
the file.

215
 Chapter 13: Creating a Project Structure
You can then check the changes by clicking the HTML file to preview in a 
browser. The changes appear in Edge Animate the next time you open the 
project.
If you save edits to the JavaScript file while the composition is still open in 
Edge Animate, a File Changed dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-5.
	
✓	If you click Yes, Edge Animate keeps the changes that you made outside 
Edge Animate.
	
✓	If you click No, Edge Animate doesn’t keep changes that you saved out­
side Edge Animate.
	
Figure 13-5: 
You need 
to reload 
the com-
position for 
saves out-
side Edge 
Animate.
	
	
If you want to edit your files outside Edge Animate in a plain text editor, close 
and save the composition beforehand. That way, you don’t run the risk of 
losing other changes that you might make within Edge Animate while simulta­
neously editing the JavaScript.
HTML files
Because the HTML language is relatively easy to learn, HTML files are prob­
ably the “friendliest” files for non-developers to work with. So, it’s a good 
idea for you to know at least the basics of HTML. Knowing such basics makes 
it much easier for you to help place animations within existing web pages.
The HTML file appears alongside the Animate file and some of the JavaScript 
files. You can instantly recognize the HTML file from the folder structure, 
because its icon appears the same as your default browser’s icon, as shown 
in Figure 13-6.

216
Part IV: Putting Your Animation to Use 
	
Figure 13-6: 
You can 
recognize 
the HTML 
file by the 
browser 
icon.
	
You can do a few different things with the HTML file:
	
✓	Open it for viewing. Simply click the file, and your animation opens in 
your default browser and begins to play.
	
✓	Open it for editing. If you right-click the HTML file, you can open the file 
using Notepad, or some other plain text editor, or even an HTML editor. 
If you open it for editing, you can do things like edit the title tag (see 
Chapter 6) or copy and paste portions of the code so that you can insert 
your animation into existing web pages (see Chapter 15).
For the most part, the HTML file is a shell to house the calls to the JavaScript 
file. For web browsers to display your animation correctly, they need to know 
where to find the files that execute your composition. That’s how the HTML 
file comes into play. You use the .html file, or at least parts of it, to put your 
composition online.
	
You can tell that Adobe Edge Animate is using HTML5 by looking at the 
DOCTYPE tag in the HTML file — a piece of code put at the top of an HTML 
file that tells the browser what standard the page is written in. In HTML5, the 
DOCTYPE looks like this:
<!DOCTYPE html>
In HTML4, DOCTYPE looks like this:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC “-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN”
   “http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd”>
HTML5, in many ways, is about simplifying and reducing the amount of code 
used.
	
You can edit the title tag within the HTML file. The title tag defines what is 
shown in the tab of your browser. If you plan to embed your composition into 
one part of a web page, the title tag in your Edge Animate composition may 
not have an effect. The title tag looks like this:

217
 Chapter 13: Creating a Project Structure
<title>Untitled</title>
You can find this code within the head section, near the top, of the file. If you 
do edit the title tag within the HTML file and save the file, the changes do 
appear in Edge Animate.
	
HTML is written with tags. A tag is a bit of code enclosed by carrots. For exam­
ple, the title tag looks like this: <title>. Each tag has an opening tag and a 
closing tag. The closing tag is similar to the opening tag, except it has a slash 
in it, like this </title>.
You most likely don’t want your first animation to appear as “Untitled” on the 
Internet, so you probably want to update that, if you didn’t already, from the 
Properties panel. To do so, simply overwrite Untitled to something more suit­
able, such as
<title>My First Slideshow</title>
After you save the HTML file and then refresh or reopen your composition in 
the browser, the title should now appear in the tab as shown in Figure 13-7.
	
Figure 13-7: 
Update the 
title tag 
so that it 
doesn’t say 
Untitled.
	
	
If you plan to edit your composition outside Edge Animate in a separate 
editor, it’s a good idea to save and close Edge Animate before doing so. 
Otherwise, you run the risk of losing edits and changes that you may make in 
Edge Animate while editing the code files.
Image folders
Edge Animate creates an image folder when you save your composition, 
which can inadvertently result in you having two sets of the same images in 

218
Part IV: Putting Your Animation to Use 
your folder structure. This happens if you put your images in the same folder 
in which you save your composition, rather than in a separate folder named 
Images.
	
It’s best practice to place your images in a folder labeled Images. That way, 
Edge Animate doesn’t create a second set of images in your folder structure.
Having two sets of the same images can lead to confusion; especially if you 
want to go back and edit them later.
	
If you decide you don’t want two sets of the same images in the same folder 
directory and want to delete the redundant set, make sure you don’t delete 
the folder that Edge Animate created. If you do, you will find your images 
missing from your composition.
Edge_includes folder
The edge_includes folder contains additional JavaScript files. The differ­
ence here is that they are .min files.
	
The .min.js files found in the edge_includes folder are minified (com­
pressed) JavaScript files. For example, white spaces and comments are 
stripped out, and they use shorter variable names. That’s why when you open 
one of these files, it may look like a large wall of text. These compressed files 
allow for faster loading times, which can earn you bonus points from browsers 
like Google that benchmark stuff like that.
These files tend to be very long, and I don’t cover them here except to men­
tion that (a) they’re important to your composition and (b) they shouldn’t be 
tampered with or edited for danger of breaking your composition.
	
It’s highly recommended that you don’t open nor edit the .min.js files found 
in the edge_includes folder. Unless, of course, you’re trained in such matters.
Creating Edge Animate Files for 
Use with Other Software Tools
Adobe Edge Animate plays well with other software tools. From the main 
menu, you can click File and then Publish Settings to choose which kinds of 
files Edge Animate creates. You choose these settings based on what you 
want do with the file:

219
 Chapter 13: Creating a Project Structure
	
✓	Put it on the web.
	
✓	Use with other Adobe tools, such as InDesign.
	
✓	Prepare files compatible with OS X.
When you choose all the Publish settings you want (see Figure 13-8), Edge 
Animate creates another whole set of folders and files. I go into more detail 
on publishing options in Chapter 14.
	
Figure 13-8: 
Choose the 
settings 
best suited 
for how you 
want to  
use the 
composition.
	
At the top level of the folder structure, you now see a Publish folder, as 
shown in Figure 13-9.
	
Figure 13-9: 
Find the 
Publish 
folder in 
the Folder 
directory.
	
Within the Publish folder, you find
	
✓	An Edge Animate package for use with other Adobe tools
	
✓	A .wdgt folder for use with iBooks Author
	
✓	A web folder that contains all the files and folders you need to publish to 
the web

220
Part IV: Putting Your Animation to Use 
Figure 13-10 shows the folders within the Publish folder.
	
Figure 13-10: 
The fold-
ers within 
the Publish 
folder.
	
Edge Animate package
The Edge Animate package folder contains an .oam file (see Figure 13-11). 
You can use .oam files with InDesign, Muse, and other Adobe Tools. 
Basically, Edge Animate compresses the JavaScript and HTML files used for 
your animation into a format that InDesign can use (the .oam file).
	
Figure 13-11: 
Use .oam 
files with 
other Adobe 
tools.
	
iBooks folder
The iBooks folder contains a .wdgt folder. You can use this folder with 
Apple’s iBooks Author. The .wdgt folder contains another whole series 
of folders and files, as shown in Figure 13-12. All you need to do is copy or 
import the .wdgt file for use with iBooks Author.

221
 Chapter 13: Creating a Project Structure
Adobe Edge Animate and Adobe Fireworks
Adobe Edge Animate works very well with 
Adobe Fireworks both in exporting and in 
importing one into the other. To get started, you 
must first download the Edge Animate exten­
sion from John Dunning’s website: http://
johndunning.com/fireworks/
about/EdgeAnimate.
Once you’re on Dunning’s site, you can read all 
about the great integration features between 
Edge Animate and Fireworks. Dunning’s 
Fireworks extension supports elements for use 
in Edge Animate, such as rectangles, text, bit­
maps, symbols, circles, layers, shadows, and 
so on. Dunning also includes notes on which 
types of elements Fireworks exports as flat­
tened images. He even explains how to export 
an element as a flattened image if that is what 
you want. This extension also enables you to 
export elements with percentage properties 
as opposed to pixels. Dunning also provides 
a short list of limitations that Fireworks won’t 
export properly, such as text elements shifting 
vertically, depending on the size and the font.
Something that you may find really exciting is 
the ability to export multi-state Fireworks proj­
ects as an Edge Animate symbol. Fireworks 
does this by exporting the animations as either 
a series of PNG files or a single sprite image.
The figure shows where to click to download 
the Fireworks extension for use with Edge 
Animate.
After you have the extension installed, it 
appears under the Commands menu in the 
Fireworks interface, as shown here.
You can also import Edge Animate projects 
into Fireworks. Basically, Fireworks asks you to 
select the .html or .an file that you want to 
import. Fireworks then creates a new document 
based on the same size and color as the Edge 
Animate document.

222
Part IV: Putting Your Animation to Use 
Web folder
This folder contains the standard set of Edge Animate files and folders. Edge 
Animate saves all the files and folders in one folder, which makes it easy for 
you to work with.

t isn’t enough to simply create your animation project and then click Save. 
Oh, no. First you need to optimize your files for the specific task(s) for 
which you want to use your animation. Edge Animate provides publishing 
settings specifically for use on the web, for use with other Adobe tools, or for 
use with Apple’s iBook Author. Throughout this chapter, I provide the details 
for each of these settings.
In addition to the Publishing Settings, you can set up a preloader. A preloader 
is used when your animation takes a long time to load. It’s a great idea for 
providing some kind of visual clue to your audience that your animation is 
simply taking a bit of time to load and that it isn’t broken.
I start this chapter suggesting different ways to handle audiences who still 
use Internet Explorer 8 or older. Animations don’t work properly in those 
versions of IE, but you can create prompts for that segment of your audience 
to use Google Chrome Frames to avoid missing out on seeing and interacting 
with your composition.
Guarding Against Internet 
Explorer 8 and Older
Internet Explorer 8 still has a strong hold on Internet usage, particularly in 
the United States. Therefore, it’s in your best interest to create web content 
that all Internet users can see. There’s nothing worse for a web designer than 

224
Part IV: Putting Your Animation to Use 
to create content that appears broken or inaccessible to a large segment of 
the population.
It’s imperative that you safeguard your animations from appearing broken by 
implementing a down-level Stage in association with the Edge Animate poster 
feature.
To use these features, read on!
Using the poster
You can use a poster with the down-level Stage. A poster, in its basic form, 
is a still image of your composition. You can use the poster instead of your 
composition when your audience is using an older web browser such as 
Internet Explorer 8 or earlier.
	
You don’t have to know which browser your audience is using because Edge 
Animate codes that for you. All you have to do is create the poster and imple­
ment the down-level Stage to create backup content in the event your audi­
ence isn’t using a modern browser (IE 9 or later, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari).
Browser, browser, who’s got the browser?
Internet Explorer 9, which is the most current 
version of Microsoft’s web browser, does play 
well with HTML5 and CSS3. As of this writing, 
Internet Explorer 10 is currently in preview and 
is generating interest with web enthusiasts. 
However, because of mostly corporate use and 
people who simply don’t upgrade their brows­
ers, plenty of web surfers still use versions of 
Internet Explorer that don’t support Adobe Edge 
Animate CC features, especially when it comes 
to animations and certain types of formatting.
Desktop usage of Internet Explorer 8 and older 
becomes staggeringly apparent when you look at 
the statistics. According to many different articles, 
Internet Explorer is still one of the most-used web 
browsers in the United States, Canada, Australia, 
the U.K., China, and South Korea. However, it has 
been cited that Google’s Chrome browser leads 
the pack in worldwide use.
As for different versions of Internet Explorer, 
use of IE 9 is still considered rare. When I 
checked the analytics of my own corporate site, 
which is visited mostly by corporate America, 
more than 33% of all visitors were using Internet 
Explorer between October 2011 and October 
2012. Among those using IE, 56% were using 
version 8. Only 30% of IE users had upgraded 
to version 9. During that same period, 11.37% 
were still using IE 7, and 1.84% were using IE 6.
A responsive web design is squarely focused 
on mobile (tablet and phone) usage. The mobile 
browser war is being fought amongst Opera, 
Android, and Safari in regard to usage. All three 
of those browsers have roughly equal usage 
share between them, with Nokia’s browser, 
BlackBerry, and others rounding out the bottom 
percentages.

225
 Chapter 14: Preparing Your Animation for Publication
Creating a poster is best done when you finish creating your animation. 
Follow these steps:
	
1.	Find a still shot that represents the point you want to make with your 
animation.
	
	 This point is most likely at the very beginning of the animation or the 
very end.
	
2.	Place your Playhead at the point you want to capture.
	
	 This allows you to preview your poster.
	
3.	Click the camera icon as shown in Figure 14-1.
	
Figure 14-1: 
Click the 
camera icon 
to open the 
Capture 
a Poster 
Image box.
	
	
	 A new box appears with a couple options, as shown in Figure 14-2.
	
4.	Capture your poster image:
 
• You can capture a new poster image at the current Playhead 
position by clicking Capture.
 
• If you already have a poster image, but want to replace it with a 
new one, you can click Refresh.
	
	Doing so overwrites any previously saved poster files.
	
	 Edge Animate saves the poster as a .png file in your images folder.

226
Part IV: Putting Your Animation to Use 
	
Figure 14-2: 
Click 
Capture 
to Create 
the poster 
or click 
Refresh to 
overwrite an 
old poster.
	
	
	 In the bottom-right corner of the Capture a Poster Image box, there is a 
Playhead icon. You can click that icon to move the Playhead to the posi­
tion where the previous poster was taken. For example, if the Playhead 
was at the beginning of the Timeline for the last poster you created and 
you want to take the new poster image at that same location but the 
Playhead is now at a different point in the Timeline, simply click that 
Playhead icon to create a new poster at the same location as the last 
time you created a poster.
	
	 After you click Capture, a new box appears, as shown in Figure 14-3.
	
Figure 14-3: 
After creat-
ing a poster, 
you put it to 
use through 
Publish 
Settings 
or edit the 
down-level 
Stage.
	
From here, you can open the Publish Settings, which is described later in this 
chapter in the section, “Using the Publishing Settings and Publish.” You can 
also choose to Edit Down-Level Stage, which I describe in the next section.
Using the down-level Stage
The down-level Stage is put in use when your audience uses a browser that 
doesn’t fully comply with the advanced animation features of Adobe Edge 

227
 Chapter 14: Preparing Your Animation for Publication
Animate CC. Given the current worldwide usage of Internet Explorer, espe­
cially in the United States, using a down-level Stage is in the best interest of 
all web content designers and animators.
Whether you click Edit from the Down-level Stage section of the Properties 
panel (Figure 14-4) or you reach the Down-level Stage section while creating a 
poster, the settings are the same.
	
Figure 14-4: 
Click Edit 
to open the 
Down-level 
Stage  
properties.
	
If you click the Edit button for the down-level Stage but don’t have a poster 
created, Edge Animate prompts you to create a poster. To get back to the 
Stage, simply click Stage in the breadcrumb navigation (as indicated in 
Figure 14-5).
	
Figure 14-5: 
Click Stage 
to get back 
to your 
composi-
tion if you 
don’t have a 
poster 
created.
	

228
Part IV: Putting Your Animation to Use 
Once you do have a poster created and you get to the Down-level Stage 
properties, you can set several properties (as shown in Figure 14-6):
	
✓	Text: You can use the Text tool to add text to the poster. Simply select 
the Text tool and then create a text box on the Stage.
	
✓	Position and Size: You can set where you want the poster image to 
appear within the Stage. You can use either X and Y coordinates, or 
simply use the auto W and H settings, per the default. Using Auto for 
width and height places your poster in its original dimensions. You can 
even toggle the px switch to use percentages instead of fixed coordinates.
	
✓	Image: From this section, you can swap out the current poster image 
for another image. Simply click the double-arrow icon to select another 
image from your library assets.
	
✓	Link: You can turn your poster image into a clickable link. Simply insert 
the URL you want members of your audience to visit when they click the 
image. You can also click the drop-down arrow to choose whether the 
new URL opens in the current browser window, a new window, _top, 
or _parent.
	
Figure 14-6: 
Configure 
the Down-
level Stage 
properties.
	
Using the Preloader
Adobe Edge Animate CC has a preloader. The preloader defines what appears 
before anything else. For instances when your animation may take a long 
time to load, it’s a good idea to use something like an hourglass timer. By 
using a timer, you alert your audience that the animation is loading and that 
they will need to wait. You can add a timer through the Preloader section on 
the Properties panel (shown in Figure 14-7).
In addition to choosing preloader art, you can also choose when JavaScript 
and images load, either as soon as they can or only when needed. I explain 
this further in the following sections.

229
 Chapter 14: Preparing Your Animation for Publication
	
Figure 14-7: 
Use the 
Preloader 
option for 
animations 
that take 
time to load.
	
Choosing either the Immediate 
or Polite option
Two different buttons appear in the Preloader properties. The first button 
(Figure 14-8) enables you to choose either:
	
✓	The Immediate option loads all JavaScript, graphics, fonts, and everything 
else all at once when the audience opens your composition.
	
✓	The Polite option loads the JavaScript (js) as page-load events fire, such 
as an action (say, when someone taps a button).
	
Figure 14-8: 
The Polite 
option loads 
js as page-
load events 
fire.
	

230
Part IV: Putting Your Animation to Use 
Choosing the preloader art
Edge Animate provides a few different pieces of artwork that you can use 
as an animated timer. If your animation takes a long time to load onto the 
screen, your audience may start to think that it’s broken or that they landed 
on the wrong URL. To prevent your audience from leaving, show some sort of 
hourglass timer that tells your audience to pull up a chair and stick around 
for a while. To get started, click the Edit button, as shown in Figure 14-9.
	
Figure 14-9: 
Click Edit 
to open the 
preloader’s 
art options.
	
When you click the Edit button, you can work on the preloader from the 
Stage, this is similar to when you edit a Symbol in that it is separate and 
independent from the main Timeline. For more information on Symbols, see 
Chapter 12.
The settings in the Properties panel update while you edit the preloader. You 
can now Insert Preloader Clip-Art, as shown in Figure 14-10.
	
Figure 14-10: 
Open the 
menu with 
preloader 
art.
	
Choosing the preloader art
From the preloader art menu, you can choose from several different anima­
tion hourglass-type icons, as shown in Figure 14-11. After you select an ani­
mated piece of art, click Insert near the bottom of the window.

231
 Chapter 14: Preparing Your Animation for Publication
	
Each type of preloader art has different dimensions and file sizes. It’s a good 
idea to choose art that fits within the Stage of your composition.
If you don’t like any of these ideas, Edge Animate provides you with the 
option of swapping out the art, which I describe next.
	
Figure 14-11: 
Choose an 
animated 
preloader 
clip and 
then click 
Insert.
	
	
Adding preloader art, just like anything else, increases file size. You probably 
don’t want to add a large preloader to a composition that is already large. You 
can see how large the preloader is (size affects page-loading speeds) when you 
open the drop-down menu to select and insert the preloader gif (Figure 14-12).
	
Figure 14-12: 
Edge 
Animate 
provides a 
visual graph 
depicting 
preloader 
art size.
	

232
Part IV: Putting Your Animation to Use 
Editing the preloader clip art
After you insert one of the clip art options, the Properties panel displays new 
settings, as shown in Figure 14-13. You can edit the following properties:
	
✓	Position the art by X and Y axis points. You can choose between pixel 
or percent.
	
✓	Edit the width and height. You can choose between pixel or percent.
	
✓	Swap out the current image. This is also how you can use custom 
preloader art, which I cover in more detail in the next section.
	
✓	Add a link. You do so by adding a URL in the box and set the target 
window from the drop-down arrow.
	
Figure 14-13: 
Properties 
for pre-
loader art.
	
You can also edit the preloader art directly from the Stage, as shown in 
Figure 14-14.
	
Figure 14-14:

art from the 
Stage.
	

233
 Chapter 14: Preparing Your Animation for Publication
Using custom preloader art
If you don’t like any of the preloader clip art that Edge Animate provides, 
you can use your own art instead. After you select one of the preloader clip 
art options and then close that menu, you can swap out the preloader image 
from the Properties panel. When you click the Swap Image icon (as indicated 
in Figure 14-15), you can choose from images in your Library Assets. This 
enables you to choose your own custom art.
	
Figure 14-15: 
Swap out 
the pre-
loader clip 
art with your

Assets.
	
Using the Publishing Settings 
and Publish
The rest of this chapter covers the publishing settings. This includes the 
web options and publishing your composition for use with other Adobe 
tools and iBooks. To open the publishing settings, from the main menu, click 
File➪Publish Settings, as shown in Figure 14-16.

234
Part IV: Putting Your Animation to Use 
	
Figure 14-16: 
Open the 
Publish 
Settings 
from the File 
menu.
	
Using the web options
After you click Publish Settings on the File menu, the Publish Settings box 
appears. From within that box, you see three options on the left side. When 
you select the Web option, more web settings appear on the right (see 
Figure 14-17).
	
Figure 14-17: 
Use the 
Web Publish 
Settings for 
online 
animations.
	
	
The advantage to using the Web Publish Settings is that it allows Edge 
Animate to perform different types of optimization and minification to the 
files. When you click the Publish button, Edge Animate generates a lighter file 
output, which means the file is significantly reduced as compared to simply 
saving the composition.

235
 Chapter 14: Preparing Your Animation for Publication
The Web Publish Settings include
	
✓	Target Directory: Click the folder icon to choose where you want the 
web files saved.
	
✓	Use Google Chrome Frames: Check this box to create a Google Chrome 
Frame for when your audience is using Internet Explorer 8 or earlier. If 
your audience doesn’t have Google Chrome Frame installed, you can 
prompt them to install it.
	
	There are three options on how to display the prompt, as shown in 
Figure 14-18. A Google Chrome Frame provides the means for members 
of your audience to view your animation when they use IE 8 or earlier, 
versions that don’t properly support Edge Animate.
	
✓	Host runtime files on Adobe CDN: If you choose this option, you benefit 
from faster downloads and easier-to-manage output with runtime 
hosting provided by Adobe via Akamai servers. Uncheck this option if 
your content needs to run offline.
	
✓	Publish Content as Static HTML: Creates an HTML file with additional 
div tags. This provides more options for working with the HTML file, 
such as adding it to an existing web page and helps with SEO.
	
Edge Animate generates the following code when you publish your project as 
a static HTML page. In addition to a div tag for the Stage, tags for the other 
elements appear:
<body style=”margin:0;padding:0;”>
                   <div id=”Stage” class=”EDGE-10260726”>
        <div id=”Stage_Rectangle” class=”edgeLoad-EDGE-10260726” title=”Use as 
Alt Tag”></div>
        <div id=”Stage_Text” class=”edgeLoad-EDGE-10260726 Text Box”>Text</div>
        <img id=”Stage_swirl” class=”edgeLoad-EDGE-10260726 swirl image” 
alt=”Alt Tag” title=”Accessibility” 
                       src=”images/green%20swirl.jpg”></img>
    </div>
</body>
You can copy and paste the code within the body tags to insert your ani­
mation into an existing web page. Just remember to upload the associated 
JavaScript files and the images as well. See Chapter 15 for additional informa­
tion on how to embed your animation into another HTML file.

Using the Edge Animate 
Deployment Package
Use the Edge Animate Deployment Package if you’re publishing your compo­
sition for use with other Adobe software tools such as InDesign, Muse, and 
others. When you select the Edge Animate Deployment Package from the 
Publish Settings, you can choose different settings from the right, as shown 
in Figure 14-19. When you select these options and then click Publish, Edge 
Animate creates an .oam file for use with other Adobe software.

 Chapter 14: Preparing Your Animation for Publication
The settings for the Edge Animate Deployment Package include
	
✓	Target Directory: Click the folder icon to choose where to save the .oam 
file.
	
✓	Published Name: Name the .oam file in this box.
	
✓	Poster Image: You can swap out the poster image by clicking the double 
arrow icon.
When you finish with the settings, click Save to exit the window, or click 
Publish to generate the files.
Publishing as iBooks / OSX
Use the iBooks / OS X setting if you’re publishing your composition for use 
with Apple’s iBooks Author. When you select the iBooks / OS X from the 
Publish Settings, you can choose different settings from the right, as shown 
in Figure 14-20. When you select these options and then click Publish, Edge 
Animate creates an .wdgt file for use with Apple’s software.

Choose 
where to 
save the 
file, what to 
name it, and

The settings for the iBooks / OS X include
	
✓	Target Directory: Click the folder icon to choose where to save the 
.wdgt file.
	
✓	Published Name: Name the .wdgt file in this box.
	
✓	Poster Image: You can swap out the poster image by clicking the double 
arrow icon.

When you finish with the settings, click Save to exit the window, or click 
Publish to generate the files.
	
For Edge Animate to generate these special files, you must either click Publish 
on the File menu (Figure 14-15) or click Publish from the Publish Setting box. 
Clicking Save or Save As doesn’t generate the special files.

▶	Placing your composition into an existing web page
▶	Embedding your composition into a Joomla! article
▶	Finding the WordPress plug-in
P

lacing your composition online can mean many things to many different 
people. The process is different depending on the type of site to which 
you want to add your composition. You can use your Edge Animate project 
as its own stand-alone site or page. You can embed your composition into an 
existing web page. If you use the Joomla! content management system (CMS), 
you can add your animation using a wrapper module. If using WordPress is 
more your style, you can use an Edge Suite extension.
	
No matter how you plan to use your animation online, using a good FTP (File 
Transfer Protocol) solution is the recommended means to uploading your files, 
which is necessary for most of the sections in this chapter. If you don’t already 
use FTP, I can suggest using FileZilla (http://filezilla-project.org), 
which many other companies and individuals have suggested to me over the 
years. FileZilla is free and intuitive to use. If you have trouble figuring something 
out, documentation is easily available (http://wiki.filezilla-project.
org/Documentation). FileZilla is continuously updated and supported as 
open-source software.
	
This book doesn’t cover buying domains or getting a web host. I assume that 
you, or your client, already have a web host and domain. If you don’t have 
a web host or a domain, I suggest looking into that before moving forward. 
Personally, I’ve used Bluehost (www.bluehost.com) for more than five years 
and have never had a problem. Its customer service is fast and responsive, 
and the service representatives can generally help you with any situation. 
You don’t have to take my word for it, though; you can use WebHostingChoice 
(http://webhostingchoice.com) as a starting point to research the top 
web hosts.

240
Part IV: Putting Your Animation to Use 
Posting Your Composition 
as a Standalone Page
A good example of a stand-alone page or website is an informative and inter­
active set of graphics and text. Informative graphics can have rollovers for 
more information or an intuitive navigation menu that is presented using 
cues mixed among the text and images (as opposed to a menu bar running 
along the borders of the site).
	
Refer to Chapter 14 for how to get your animation ready for publication. Now 
is a good time to review how to use the publishing settings, in particular the 
section on using the web options.
Uploading your animation through 
your own hosted site
If you host your own site, simply copy and paste your files into your site’s 
directory. The only file that you don’t have to copy over is the .an file (the 
Animate file). If Edge Animate generates a debug.log file, you don’t have to 
copy over that file either. For more information on the files and folders that 
Edge Animate creates, see Chapter 13; Chapter 14 provides information on 
the publishing settings for deploying to the web.
	
I highly recommend using the publishing settings (see Chapter 14) and trans­
ferring the files and folders that Edge Animate generates within the publish\
web folder structure to your web host. This folder structure doesn’t contain 
the .an file. It contains only optimized files for web use.
When you copy over the files, be sure to include the images and the edge_
includes folder and all of the files in those folders.
After you copy over the files and folders, your Edge Animate composition 
should appear online. You can find it at the URL according to how your 
directory is set up and based on the name of the HTML file. For example, 
if the name of your HTML file is slide-show-animation.html, you can 
find your composition at www.yourwebsiteurl.com/slide-show-
animation.html.

241
 Chapter 15: Putting Your Project on the Web
Uploading to your hosted site through FTP
If you want to put your animation online through a web host, I recommend 
using good FTP software such as FileZilla. To the uninitiated, using FTP may 
sound a little scary, but it’s no more complicated than using folders and files 
just like the ones on your desktop computer.
Creating a new directory 
for your composition
To keep your files organized, create a new folder, or directory, in your overall 
site’s directory to store your animation compositions. To do so in FileZilla, 
simply right-click where you want the new folder to be and then choose 
Create Directory, as shown in Figure 15-1.
	
Create the new folder in the root folder that contains your site. For example, 
you probably have a folder called public_html, which is where you store 
your site’s files and additional folders. Or your root folder may be simply 
called yoursite.com; it all depends on how your site was originally set up.
	
Figure 15-1: 
Create a 
new direc-
tory for your 
animation.
	
	
Name your new directory something generic, like animations, that way you 
can use this folder again for future animation compositions.
Uploading your files
With the new folder set up, it’s time to import, or upload, your animation. If 
you’re using FileZilla or similar FTP software, uploading the files is a matter 
of a simple drag-and-drop or copy-and-paste action. You can also click 
File➪Import on FileZilla’s menu bar.
After you create the new directory and upload the files, your directory 
should look similar to Figure 15-2.

242
Part IV: Putting Your Animation to Use 
	
Figure 15-2: 
Your 
animation 
directory.
	
Finding your animation online
Now, to find your animation online, simply follow the specific URL path that 
you set up. In this example, the URL is similar to
http://www.yoursite.com/slideshow-animation/slide-show-animation.html.
Adding Your Project into 
an Existing Web Page
Often your end goal for your animation is to embed it in an existing web page, 
such as an animation slideshow on a restaurant site. Here is a step-by-step 
guide on how to embed your animation in an existing web page:
	
1.	Find the HTML file you want your composition to appear in.
	
2.	Open the Edge Animate HTML file. Copy everything between <!--
Adobe Edge Runtime--> and <!--Adobe Edge Runtime End-->, 
which is found in the <head> tags.
	
3.	Paste the code in the <head> tags of the web page in which you want 
your animation to appear.

243
 Chapter 15: Putting Your Project on the Web
	
4.	Copy this code, which appears between the <body> tags:
<div id=”stage” class=”EDGE-7347542”>
</div>
	
5.	Paste the code into the HTML file of the web page where you want the 
animation to appear.
	
6.	Save the updated HTML file.
	
7.	Upload the Animate files and folders into the same folder as the HTML 
file that now contains your animation.
	
	 See the previous section on uploading your files for more information.
	
8.	Preview, test, and fine-tune how the animation appears in the page.
	
When you copy over code, don’t copy the <title> tag from your Animate 
HTML file. Doing so may conflict with the <title> tag on the HTML file that 
you’re copying into. Also, don’t copy the <body style=”margin:0;
padding:0;”> code from your Animate HTML file. Doing so might conflict 
with the <body> tag on the HTML page that you’re copying into.
	
Don’t break the path that connects the HTML file, the JavaScript files, and 
the image folder. If the paths don’t remain consistent, your animation will not 
work properly.
	
There’s a very good chance that you’ll need to fine-tune the CSS or other 
design parameters of the web page to ensure that the animation appears as 
you want it to look in the page. Each web page is unique. However, whoever 
originally designed the web page most likely knows what to do to make sure 
your composition looks good on the page.
Putting Your Composition 
into a Joomla! Site
If you use Joomla! as a content management system (CMS), how do you get 
your composition to show up on your site? The answer is pretty simple: You 
make a wrapper module. A wrapper module in Joomla! enables you to create 
an iFrame. An iFrame allows you to add content from another URL into your 
Joomla! article. The following section explains how to do this.
The first thing you need to do is upload your Edge Animate files, as described 
earlier in this chapter. That effectively puts your animation online. But that 
doesn’t help with placing your animation in your Joomla! site; it simply 
appears online as though you posted it as its own page.

244
Part IV: Putting Your Animation to Use 
The easiest and quickest way to put your animation in Joomla! — for exam­
ple, in an article or on the front page — is by using a wrapper module.
The following procedure creates a wrapper module for your animation 
and uses that module in an article to get your animation to appear on your 
Joomla! site.
	
1.	To create a wrapper module, go to the Joomla! main menu and click 
Extensions➪Module Manager (Figure 15-3).
	
Figure 15-3: 
Open the 
Module 
Manager 
from the 
main menu.
	
	
2.	 Click New, as shown in Figure 15-4.

reating an interactive and animated slideshow is a great way to acquire 
some of the Adobe Edge Animate CC basics. In this chapter, I cover how 
to work with several images in a composition. I also discuss how to time the 
images fading in and fading out. In addition, I show you how to add a loop to 
a slideshow so that it keeps playing. To include some basic interactivity to the 
slideshow, I conclude with a discussion on how to add Play and Stop buttons.
Overall Steps for Creating a Slideshow
This chapter provides detailed steps for creating a slideshow with a loop and 
buttons for starting and stopping. Here’s a quick rundown of the general steps:
	
1.	 Determine the size of the Stage. This is especially important if you want 
to embed the slideshow into an existing web page.
	
2.	 Gather your images and size them the same size as the Stage.
	
3.	 Import all of the images through the Library panel in Edge Animate.
	
4.	 Drag the first image onto the Stage.
	
5.	 Set the Opacity properties for the image to fade in and then fade out.

250
Part V: Creating Sample Projects 
	
6.	 Place the second image on the Stage.
	
7.	 Copy the first two keyframes you made for the first image.
	
8.	 Select the second image, and then paste the first keyframes so that they 
apply to the selected image.
	
9.	 Repeat Steps 6 through 8 for the remaining images.
	
10.	 Add in a Stage trigger to play from the beginning when the animation 
reaches the end.
	
11.	 Add the Play and Stop buttons and set their actions.
	
12.	 Add Cursor attributes to the buttons.
That’s the overall procedure in a nutshell. You can find the details on each of 
these steps throughout the remainder of this chapter.
Setting Up Images and the Stage
Before you even open up Adobe Edge Animate CC, I highly encourage you to 
organize the images that you want to use in your slideshow. You also want to 
figure out how big you want to set the Stage. After you have done that, then 
you can open up Edge Animate and start importing the images.
	
1.	Determine how big to make the Stage. If you want to place the slide­
show into an existing web page, determine the available space in 
the page.
	
2.	When you know how big you want to make the Stage, size the images 
accordingly.
	
	 Slideshows look best when you size all the images the same.
	
3.	Create a folder on your desktop for your overall slideshow project. 
Within that main folder, create another folder called Images. Place all 
your images within that folder.
	
4.	Open Edge Animate and size the Stage per Step 1.
	
	 See Chapter 3 for more on how to size the Stage.
	
5.	Import all your images at once through the Library panel (see 
Chapter 12).
After completing these first steps, you can proceed to animating the first slide.

251
 Chapter 16: Creating an Interactive Slideshow Animation
	
If your image is bigger than the Stage, parts of the image appear dimmer than 
other parts. The parts that appear dimmer are the parts that are off the Stage 
(see Figure 16-1). You can resize the Stage or the images to make a good fit. 
You can also change the Overflow property for the Stage to Visible, but that 
won’t help if you want to place the slideshow within an existing web page and 
you have tight space considerations.
	
Figure 16-1: 
Make sure 
the Stage 
and the 
images are 
the same 
size.
	
Animating the First Slide
Edge Animate is feature-rich, and you can create a composition multiple 
ways. For example, when creating your slideshow, you can use the Visibility 
property to make images appear or disappear from the Stage. However, for 
now, I want to use opacity. I have a couple reasons for doing so. First, I go 
into detail on using visibility in a later example in Chapter 19; second, I want 
to show how to use opacity effectively. When you use opacity to fade ele­
ments in and out, also using visibility is redundant and unnecessary. The fol­
lowing procedure picks up where I left off in the previous section.
	
1.	Drag your first image from the Library panel onto the Stage.
	
2.	From the Properties panel, set the Opacity to 0.
	
	 This starts your image off as appearing invisible, as shown in Figure 16-2.
	
3.	Toggle the Pin and drag the Playhead down the Timeline to the 
1-second mark.

252
Part V: Creating Sample Projects 
	
Figure 16-2: 
Using the 
Opacity 
setting to 
conceal the 
image.
	
	
4.	Set the Opacity to 100%.
	
	 If you preview the slideshow at this point, you see the image fade in over 
the course of 1 second. You now have your first animation.
	
5.	Select this animation and copy it.
	
6.	Configure the image to fade out:
	
a.	Place your cursor over the yellow bar with the chevrons, as shown 
in Figure 16-3.
	
b.	Click and drag that keyframe so that the Playhead is at the 
2-second mark and the Pin is at the 1-second mark.
	
c.	From the Properties panel, adjust Opacity back to 0.
	
	This makes your image fade out.
	
Another way to do Step 6 is to copy the transition from the Timeline. Then, 
use Paste Inverted (from the main menu, click, Edit➪Paste Special➪Paste 
Inverted).

Click and 
drag the

253
 Chapter 16: Creating an Interactive Slideshow Animation
You should now have two animations. The first one fades the image in, and 
the second one fades the image out. If you preview the animation, you’ll see 
the image slowly appear and then disappear.
The next section shows how to animate the second slide.
Animating the Second Slide
If you’ve been following along since the beginning of this chapter, you cur­
rently have a Stage and a set of images in your Library that have the same 
size dimensions. You’ve also created two transitions during which your first 
image fades onto the screen in 1 second and then fades out.
Now it’s time to create the second set of transitions for use with the second 
slide:
	
1.	Drag the second image for your slideshow from the Library panel onto 
the Stage.
	
2.	Place the Playhead at the 2-second mark in the Timeline.
	
3.	Copy the first two transitions from the previous procedure.
	
	 You can select them both at the same time by clicking on the rollup bar, 
as shown in Figure 16-4.
	
Figure 16-4: 
Place the 
cursor over 
the top bar to 
select both 
keyframes.
	
	
4.	Make sure you have the second image selected and then paste in the 
transitions.
	
	 This applies the same keyframe attributes to the second image as you 
set for the first image. At this point, if you preview the slideshow, you 
see the first image fade in and then out, and then the second image fades 
in and fades out.

254
Part V: Creating Sample Projects 
	
5.	Experiment with meshing the two images so that as the first image 
fades out, the second one starts to fade in.
	
	 To do so, select the second set of transitions and drag them down the 
Timeline so that it starts at the 1-second mark, as shown in Figure 16-5.
	
	 If you preview the slideshow now, you see the second image start to 
appear as the first image disappears.
	
Figure 16-5: 
Blend the 
fading out 
of the first 
image with 
the fading  
in of the 
second.
	
	
6.	Repeat Steps 1 through 5 for your remaining images.
	
Scrub the Playhead to about the 1.5 mark in the Timeline. Doing so allows you 
to see both images at approximately 50% opacity. You can see a combination 
of both images on the Stage at once, as shown in Figure 16-6.
	
Figure 16-6: 
Viewing 
both images 
at once.
	
Adding the Finishing Touches
Up to now, you have a decent slideshow animation. However, it’s missing 
interactivity. Also, it stops when it reaches the end. In this section, I show 
you how to add a loop to your animation so that it keeps repeating. I also 
show you how to add Play and Stop buttons so that your audience can inter­
act with the slideshow.

255
 Chapter 16: Creating an Interactive Slideshow Animation
Adding a loop
Here’s how to add a loop to your slideshow:
	
1.	Place the Playhead at the end of the Timeline.
	
2.	Click the Insert Trigger icon from the Timeline, as shown in Figure 16-7.
	
Figure 16-7: 
Insert a trig-
ger into the 
Timeline.
	
	
	 When you click the Insert Trigger icon, the Trigger dialog box opens.
	
3.	Click Play From on the right side of the box.
	
	 This populates the code, as shown in Figure 16-8.
	
	 By default, Edge Animate uses 1000 as the timestamp from which to 
play. If you want your slideshow to repeat from the very beginning, edit 
this to 0.
	
4.	Close the box to save.
	
Figure 16-8: 
Click Play 
From to cre-
ate a loop.
	
	
To preview the loop, you must watch the animation from a browser 
(File➪Preview in browser). The Stage doesn’t support the trigger.

256
Part V: Creating Sample Projects 
Adding Play and Stop buttons
Now you have a slideshow that continuously repeats, but what if your audi­
ence wants to stop the slideshow? In that case, it’s good to provide some 
buttons that your audience can interact with. The following procedure shows 
you how to add a Play button and a Stop button. For this procedure, I’m 
assuming that you already have images that represent the buttons.
Here’s how to add actions to your buttons. You can repeat this process for 
the Stop button and the Play button:
	
1.	Place your button on the Stage where you want it to appear (this 
doesn’t have to be an image. It can be a text box or an image).
	
2.	Right-click the button image and choose Open Actions.
	
3.	From the menu, choose Click.
	
	 This opens a second menu.
	
4.	From this menu, choose the action for the button.
	
	You can choose Play or Stop here.
	
	 This populates the dialog box with code, as shown in Figure 16-9.
	
Figure 16-9: 
Click Play 
to have the 
animation 
start playing 
where it 
left off.
	
	
To test that your buttons work, you must preview the animation in a browser.

257
 Chapter 16: Creating an Interactive Slideshow Animation
Adding the Cursor attributes
If you previewed a button in the preceding section to see whether it works, you 
may have noticed that your cursor didn’t change from the standard arrow to a 
hand when you hovered over the button, indicating that it is indeed a button.
In the next procedure, I show you how to add Cursor attributes to the buttons 
to provide a visual clue to your audience that they can click the buttons. This 
procedure assumes you already have an image on the Stage with actions set.
	
1.	Select the element (image of the Play or Stop button) on the Stage.
	
2.	From the Properties panel, click the Cursor attribute icon.
	
	 This opens the Cursor attribute menu (Figure 16-10).
	
Figure 16-10: 
Add a 
Cursor  
attribute to 
your 
buttons.
	
	
3.	Choose the pointing hand icon.
	
	 This icon appears when you hover the mouse over the button in a web 
browser.
	
To see your Cursor attributes in action, you must preview the animation in a 
browser. The Stage doesn’t support Cursor attributes.

Chapter 17
Synchronizing Elements 
in an Animation
In This Chapter
▶	Drawing and formatting elements
▶	Putting rotating and easing to good use
▶	Timing text and coordinating effects
I

n this chapter, I explain how I created an animation of a car driving into 
a brick wall. I affectionately named this composition “Car Go Boom.” To 
get the animation to work, I drew the road and some lane markers. I then 
imported an image of a car, sans the wheels. I had to remove the wheels 
from the car so that I could create an animation of the wheels turning. I 
also imported an image of a brick wall so that the car had something to hit. 
Finally, I added an effect of the car bouncing off the wall and then some text 
saying “Boom” — hence I made “Car Go Boom.”
My intention in this chapter is to give you a resource for synchronizing 
elements, using the rotating tool, and effectively using easing.
Drawing Elements onto the Stage
To get started, use the Rectangle tool to draw the road (refer to Chapter 3 for 
more on drawing elements). Simply draw a black rectangle along the bottom 
portion of the Stage.
	
While drawing your objects, make sure the pin isn’t toggled and that Edge 
Animate doesn’t automatically create keyframes; otherwise each element you 
draw and each change you make are recorded as animated keyframes. That 
could be fun to watch later — to see the iterative process of creating, coloring, 

260
Part V: Creating Sample Projects 
placing, and sizing the rectangles — but it probably wouldn’t look too good in 
the final animation.
If you want to get fancy, you can draw lane markers:
	
1.	Draw a small rectangle.
	
2.	Use the color picker (refer to Chapter 9) to change the color to yellow.
	
3.	Angle the lane marker to a –10 skew (refer to Chapter 7).
	
4.	Place the lane marker in the middle of the road.
	
	 You can use the guide lines that magically appear to align the element in 
the center.
	
5.	Copy and paste the lane marker as many times as you need to.
	
	 Repeat until the road has a sufficient number of lane markers, as shown 
in Figure 17-1.
	
Figure 17-1: 
Stage is set 
with a road 
and lane 
markers.
	
	
If, after placing all the lane markers in the road, you decide you want smaller 
markers, you can adjust their sizes all at once:
	
1.	Select one of the markers.
	
2.	While pressing Shift on the keyboard, select the other markers.
	
3.	In the Properties panel, adjust the size by changing the Width.
	
	 The Height should stay proportional if the Link Scale is on.
You can also import the brick wall at this time so that it’s at the far end of 
the road.
Now it’s time to import and synchronize a car wheel.

261
 Chapter 17: Synchronizing Elements in an Animation
Rotating an Element
Adobe Edge Animate CC isn’t the equivalent to stop-motion animation. That 
is, you don’t have to create a keyframe for each rotation of a wheel. If you 
have to do that, you may as well create a claymation composition.
Here’s how to make your wheel roll:
	
1.	Import an image of a car wheel and position it right above one of the 
lane markers.
	
2.	Activate the pin and adjust the Playhead in the Timeline so that you 
can create a transition.
	
3.	Use the mouse to move the wheel off the Stage.
	
4.	Change the Rotate attribute (refer to Chapter 7) to 360 degrees (see 
Figure 17-2).
	
	 Your composition should now look like Figure 17-3.
You can preview this animation on the Stage.
	
Figure 17-2: 
Set the 
Rotate prop-
erty to 360.
	
	
You can also use the Properties panel (instead of the mouse) to roll the wheel 
off the Stage instead of the mouse. To do so, in the Position and Size section, 
set the L property so that the wheel is just off the Stage (refer to Chapter 8 for 
more on positioning and sizing). If you have Global selected, then you would 
simply set the X property.
	
Figure 17-3: 
Positioning 
the ele-
ment off the 
Stage.
	

262
Part V: Creating Sample Projects 
Synchronizing More than One Element
Now that you’ve practiced making one wheel roll down the road, it’s time to 
import the car image and copy and paste the first wheel to create a second 
wheel.
	
If you’ve been following the chapter, now is a good time to delete the first ani­
mation you made of the wheel rolling down the road by itself. To do so, select 
that keyframe in the Timeline and delete it. When you delete the keyframe, the 
object isn’t deleted. To delete the object, you need to select it from the Stage, 
and then delete it.
	
Before you start importing new images and copying and pasting the wheel, be 
sure to toggle off the pin and make sure the stop watch isn’t red so that you 
don’t start creating automatic keyframes. You don’t want each import, change, 
and move animated.
Aligning the wheels:
	
1.	Align the car image so that the wheel well is aligned with the wheel.
	
2.	Copy and paste the first wheel to create a second wheel. Place the 
second wheel in the empty wheel well.
Now it’s time to synchronize the car and the wheels so that they all travel 
together down the road.
	
While you import your images, you may need to use the Send Backward fea­
ture (to find this feature, open the Modify menu from the main menu, then 
choose Send Backward) to send the image of the wheel behind the image of 
the car. Figure 17-4 shows the different options available for arranging your 
elements.
	
Figure 17-4: 
The Modify 
menu for 
arranging 
the order of 
objects.
	

263
 Chapter 17: Synchronizing Elements in an Animation
	
Adobe Edge Animate CC does support images with transparent backgrounds. 
To keep the transparent background of your image, save it as a .png file; oth­
erwise, you may have square white edges along the perimeter of your wheels, 
which could look funky as the car is cruising down the road.
At this point, your composition should look like Figure 17-5 (the wall isn’t 
shown), with the road drawn and the three images (car and two wheels) in 
place and selected.
	
Figure 17-5: 
Preparing 
for synchro-
nization.
	
	
1.	Enable Auto Keyframe mode (the stopwatch appears red), toggle the 
Pin and move the Playhead in the Timeline to where you want the ani­
mation to end.
	
	 For example, if you want the car to take 5 seconds to cross the Stage, 
move the Playhead out to the 0:05 mark and keep the pin at 0.
	
2.	Select the two wheels and the car by clicking on them with the mouse 
while holding down Shift so that you have all three elements selected.
	
3.	Use the mouse to click and drag the three objects until the front end of 
the car hits the wall.
	
	 Don’t worry if your hand is a little shaky while dragging the objects. 
That actually improves the appearance of a car driving down the road 
and smacking into a wall.
	
4.	From the Timeline, make sure the Playhead is at the point in time 
when the car hits the wall, leaving the Pin at the beginning of the 
animation.
	
5.	Select only one of the wheels and change the Rotate attribute to 360.
	
6.	Select the other wheel and set the Rotate attribute to 360.
If you play the animation now, the car should appear to be traveling down 
the road and stopping when it meets the wall.

264
Part V: Creating Sample Projects 
Using Easing
In this section, I describe how to create the appearance of a car bouncing 
off a brick wall by using easing. For more information on easing, refer to 
Chapter 4.
	
Keep an eye on where the Playhead and Pin are in the Timeline. Also keep an 
eye on the Pin to see whether it’s toggled and whether the stopwatch icon is 
activated to create automatic keyframes.
Here’s how to add easing to an element. The following steps continue from 
the example in the preceding section:
	
1.	Place the Playhead at the end of the animation where the car meets 
the wall.
	
2.	Select the elements to which you want to add an easing attribute.
	
	 In this case, you select the car and two wheels.
	
	 Now you can edit the easing attributes by using the Easing tool in the 
Timeline as highlighted in Figure 17-6.
	
Figure 17-6: 
Using the 
Easing tool.
	
	
3.	Click the Easing tool icon (Figure 4-11).
	
	 This opens several options for using easing.
	
4.	Choose one of the options and then choose a more detailed option.
	
	If you click different options, the graph on the right updates showing a 
representation of the easing effect.
	
	 For this example, choose Ease Out and then Bounce.
	
Notice that three of the five easing attributes are named with either In or Out 
or In Out. Here’s a brief description of those terms:

265
 Chapter 17: Synchronizing Elements in an Animation
	
✓	In: The easing effect takes place at the beginning of the animation.
	
✓	Out: The easing effect takes place at the end of the animation.
	
✓	In Out: The effect happens at both the beginning and the end of the 
animation.
If you play the animation now, you should see the wheels rotating, the car 
moving down the road, and when the car meets the wall, you should see it 
bounce back and forth. Okay, so it’s more like the car ran into a trampoline 
rather than a brick wall, but you discovered how to use easing. Now is a good 
time to experiment with all the different easing attributes.
	
It can be difficult to see the full easing effect watching the animation play 
in real time. You can watch the animation in slow motion by scrubbing the 
Playhead back and forth in the Timeline. Doing so allows you to see the car 
bounce in slow motion.
Timing Some Text
Just for practice, try adding text to appear at the point when the car hits 
the wall.
	
1.	Place the Playhead and Pin in the Timeline at the point where you 
want the text to appear.
	
	 If you want to time the text to appear just after the first crash, scrub the 
Timeline so that you see the car hit the wall and then start to bounce 
back — that’s where you want to place the Playhead and Pin. That way, 
the text appears as the car bounces back and forth off the wall.
	
2.	Insert a text box (refer to Chapter 10) and type some text, such 
as Boom.
	
3.	Reduce the Opacity setting (refer to Chapter 8) to 0 (see Figure 17-7).
	
	 This gives the appearance that the text isn’t there, as shown in Figure 17-8.
	
4.	Make sure the Pin is toggled and move the Playhead a smidgen down 
the Timeline.

266
Part V: Creating Sample Projects 
	
Figure 17-7: 
Reduce the 
Opacity to 
zero.
	
	
Figure 17-8: 
The text 
doesn’t 
appear with 
an Opacity 
of 0.
	
	
5.	Change the Opacity to 100%.
	
	 This gives the appearance that the text pops into view as the car hits the 
wall. Figure 17-9 shows the Stage with the text.
	
Figure 17-9: 
Text 
appears 
at 100% 
Opacity.
	

267
 Chapter 17: Synchronizing Elements in an Animation
	
You can change the name of the elements to better suit what they actually 
represent. For example, if you have several text boxes in your animation, num­
bering them isn’t the best way to keep track of them. Instead, you can rename 
them for better representation. In this case, renaming the text box as Boom 
helps you remember what that element is.

▶	Creating a Symbol
A

dobe Edge Animate CC is a great tool for e-learning specialists and 
teachers. You can build interactive and animated tutorials from which 
students can learn. In this chapter, I show you how to create a tutorial with 
several steps. Students can use forward and back arrows to move forward in the 
lesson or to move back a step. I also show how to add a Symbol to the com­
position, which is used for a quick tip that students can tap to show or hide 
additional information.
During the course of this chapter, I discuss a few pitfalls that I encountered 
when first creating this tutorial. My intention is that you can learn from my mis­
takes, and avoid creating the same mistakes. Also, as you advance in working 
with Edge Animate, you may discover that some of my ideas aren’t completely 
necessary. For example, when it comes time to create a Symbol, I suggest that 
you create your first Symbol in a separate project, save it as a Symbol, and 
then import it into your main composition. Doing so for your first few projects 
may save you some headaches. However, as you become more familiar with 
Edge Animate, you may find that this extra step is no longer necessary.
I originally created this tutorial with dimensions appropriate for use on an 
iPad; however, the tutorial works great on mobile devices such as Amazon’s 
Kindle Fire and Android phones. It also works great on desktop browsers 
such as Internet Explorer 9, Firefox, and Chrome.
This chapter starts with the assumption that you’ve already:
	
✓	Created a wireframe
	
✓	Gathered your assets and fonts
	
✓	Sized the Stage (iPad screen dimensions: 768 x 1024)
You’re ready!

Steps for Building an Interactive Tutorial
To get a sense of what this chapter shows you 
how to build, here’s the first step of the tutorial. 
The function of the tutorial is to teach how to 
complete a task through a series of steps. The 
student taps on elements to proceed through 
the tutorial.
Here are the overall steps presented in this 
chapter:
	 1.	 Gather your assets.
	 2.	 Size your Stage.
	 3.	 Format the navigation bar.
	 4.	 Add a text box for the instructions.
	 5.	 Add placeholders for the navigation arrows.
	 6.	 Create and animate the callout lines using 
clipping.
	 7.	 Use labels in the Timeline to show where 
new steps begin.
	 8.	 Add actions to the navigation arrows so 
students can move back and forth through 
steps.
	 9.	 Create a Symbol for the quick tip text.

271
 Chapter 18: Building an Interactive Tutorial
Placing the Navigation Bar
First, you place the navigation bar, which enables the student to advance the 
lesson or to backtrack to a previous step, along the bottom of the screen.
	
1.	Use the Rectangle drawing tool to create the navigation bar along the 
bottom of the Stage. Use the color picker to set the background color 
(see Chapter 9).
	
2.	Create a text box for the instructions (Chapter 10).
	
3.	Draw a rectangle to house the forward arrow in the lower-right corner 
(Chapter 3).
	
4.	Place the image of a forward arrow inside the rectangle.
	
5.	Use the guides to help evenly align the elements (text box, arrow box, 
and arrow) within in the navigation bar.
	
	 Figure 18-1 shows how helpful the guides are when you need to align 
several elements. You can place as many guides as you need.
	
Figure 18-1: 
Use the 
guides to 
help align 
elements.
	
	
Place the guides and then leave them. Don’t delete them or move them. You 
want these guides in place throughout the process of creating the tutorial. 
Each step uses different arrow elements (forward_arrow_step_1, forward_
arrow_step_2, forward_arrow_step_3) and leaving the guides in place helps 
you remember where to place them. Placing your arrows in slightly different 
positions for each step may create the appearance of the arrows jumping 
around, even if the arrows change placement in tiny increments. Right now, 
you’re placing only the forward arrow, but in the next step, you add the back 
arrow.

Animating the First Step of the Tutorial
Now that you’ve created the navigation bar, you can turn your attention to 
animating the first step.
	
1.	Place the first main graphic on the Stage.
	
	 Each step has a different main graphic. You want to size the main graph­
ics roughly the same size for consistency. In this example, the main 
image switches between the iPad’s home screen and reminder screen.
	
2.	Use the guides to determine the placement of the main image (see 
Figure 18-2).
	
	 That way, all main graphics appear in the same location.
	
Figure 18-2: 
Use the 
guides to 
help place 
the main 
graphic 
images.
	
	
Resist the temptation to simply move the guides you placed for the navigation 
bar for use with main graphics.
Using clipping for the callout lines
Now it’s time to draw the callout lines. The callout lines are used to provide 
a reference as to where the student should tap the screen. In this example, I 
use rectangles to draw the callout lines, and I use clipping to animate them.
This procedure shows how to animate the callout the lines:
	
1.	Use the Rectangle tool to draw a long, skinny bar and then set the 
background color, as shown in Figure 18-3.

273
 Chapter 18: Building an Interactive Tutorial
	
Figure 18-3: 
Draw the 
first callout 
line.
	
	
2.	Copy the first callout line and paste it to create the second line.
	
	 Each segment of the line is its own element. By copying and pasting, you 
keep the same width and color and save yourself the trouble of redraw­
ing and reformatting the line.
	
3.	Name each line segment accordingly so that each one isn’t Rect1Copy 
or whatever.
	
	 Use northlinestep1, horizontallinestep1, and so on. You want to keep 
these names straight so that you can find them easily later to make 
tweaks.
	
4.	Use clipping (refer to Chapter 9) to animate the callout line appearing 
on the Stage.
	
	 Select the element and then the Clipping tool, toggle the Pin, and move 
the Playhead down the Timeline. Start the keyframe with the element 
completely clipped, and end the keyframe with the element completely 
unclipped.
	
	 Figure 18-4 shows a partially clipped callout line.
	
Figure 18-4: 
Use clipping 
to create 
the anima-
tion of the 
callout 
line that’s 
appearing.
	
You can preview the clipping animation from the Stage.

274
Part V: Creating Sample Projects 
Create segments in the 
Timeline for each step
Now that you have Step 1 complete, it’s a good idea to start adding labels 
to your Timeline (see Chapter 5). The labels should represent where Step 1 
begins, another for Step 2, and so on. This is like creating segments in your 
Timeline, which is helpful for a couple of reasons:
	
✓	These labels come in handy when you set the actions for the forward 
and back arrows.
	
	The labels help you visualize where Step 1 is taking place, where Step 2 
happens, and so forth.
	
Using labels is considered best practice because using time code may prove 
trickier when working with actions. For instance, you can move the label 
to affect timing without having to edit the action, whereas when using time 
codes, you can’t. Labels also provide visual clues in the Timeline on what is 
taking place at that time.
Using Stage triggers to stop 
the tutorial from advancing
Your tutorial keeps playing unless you add a Stage action to trigger the ani­
mation to stop playing. You want the animation to stop playing so that the 
student controls when to advance the lesson. Otherwise, the animation keeps 
playing through each step.
This procedure shows you how to stop the animation after each step:
	
1.	Place the Playhead where Step 1 finishes.
	
2.	Click the Insert Trigger icon, as indicated in Figure 18-5.
	
	 Doing so opens the Trigger code box.

275
 Chapter 18: Building an Interactive Tutorial
	
Figure 18-5: 
Create Stage 
triggers to 
stop the 
animation 
from playing 
at the end of 
each step.
	
	
3.	From the Trigger code box, choose Stop from the right side, as shown 
in Figure 18-6.
	
Figure 18-6: 
Choose Stop 
to stop the 
animation 
from 
playing.
	
	
4.	Close the box to save the trigger.
Now when you preview the animation, it stops after Step 1 is finished. To test 
this, repeat the steps and procedures in this section for Steps 2, 3, and so on.
Adding the Interactivity
After you complete animating each step in your tutorial, you need to add the 
forward and back buttons, which allows students to advance at their own 
pace. After the procedure on adding actions for the arrows, I show you how 
to add a quick tip button as a SymbolSymbol.

276
Part V: Creating Sample Projects 
Creating the forward and back arrows
If you are like me, you may want to create a SymbolSymbol for the back and 
forward arrows. I’m here to tell you that is overkill. The navigation arrows 
are too simple to warrant use of a SymbolSymbol. Besides, SymbolSymbols 
are best used when you want to create animations that are independent of 
the main Timeline. The navigation arrows aren’t independent of the main 
Timeline; in fact, they work directly with the main Timeline in regard to the 
labels that represent where each step begins. A better reason for creating a 
SymbolSymbol is for the quick tip, which I discuss in the next section.
	
Here is a list of points to keep in mind when working with the navigation 
arrows:
	
✓	Each step needs its own arrow element.
	
✓	Don’t use more than one click (or tap) action per element.
	
✓	Avoid using the touch commands. Click works best even for touch 
screens. The touch commands can lead to double-clicking. This is more 
true for tablets like the Kindle Fire. On the iPad, double-clicking does not 
happen as often.
	
Add labels to your Timeline for use with the navigation arrows. If you use a 
label in an action that doesn’t exist, your animation plays from the beginning 
of the Timeline.
Here’s the procedure for adding actions to your navigation arrows:
	
1.	Set the visibility of each arrow element.
	
	 You don’t want the arrows to always be visible. As you add an arrow for 
each step, turn the visibility to On at the beginning of the step and Off 
right before the end of the step. See Chapter 8 for more information on 
the Visibility property.
	
2.	Name each arrow element accordingly (forward_arrow_1, forward_
arrow_2, and so on).
	
	This way, you can find them easily later on.
	
	 Now you’re ready to edit the action.
	
3.	Right-click the arrow and choose Open Actions.
	
4.	Choose Click from the menu.
	
5.	Choose Play From in the right column.

277
 Chapter 18: Building an Interactive Tutorial
	
6.	Edit the code so that a click starts playing the animation from the 
appropriate location.
	
	 For example, for the forward arrow in Step 1, you want the student to 
advance to Step 2 (see Figure 18-7).
	
Figure 18-7: 
Use labels 
in the 
actions for 
ease of use.
	
	
7.	Set the cursor attribute for the element (see Chapter 5).
	
	 This is only necessary if your audience might use a desktop or laptop 
computer along with a mouse. If you plan for the tutorial to only appear 
on tablets, then this isn’t necessary.
Now that you have the first arrow created, you can copy the element for 
re-use on each step. When you are ready to place the arrow to advance to 
Step 3 of the tutorial (the first arrow advances the student to Step 2), move 
the Pin and Playhead to where Step 2 starts in the Timeline and then paste in 
the element in the same spot (using the guides) as where the first arrow was 
placed.
Then edit the click action (so that it advances to Step 3 instead of Step 2, 
etc.) and remember to set the visibility for each arrow. For example, at the 
beginning of Step 2, the first arrow’s visibility should be Off, and the second 
arrow’s visibility should be On.
You can follow this same procedure for the back arrows. The first back arrow 
should appear at the beginning of Step 2 so that the student can backtrack to 
Step 1.
Creating the quick tip
The quick tip in this tutorial is an excellent example of how and when to use 
Symbols in Adobe Edge Animate CC. The quick tip works independently of 
the main Timeline and thus has actions and labels that don’t affect the main 

278
Part V: Creating Sample Projects 
Timeline. You can even create this Symbol in an entirely different project 
than you’ve been working on so far, which is exactly what I propose you do 
until you gain enough experience working in Edge Animate to create Symbols 
within the main composition.
The quick tip in this example is a plus Symbol. When students tap that Symbol, 
additional text flies out, and they can close that extra text by tapping on an X. 
Here’s how you do that:
	
1.	Start a new project.
	
2.	Add an element to the Stage that you want to serve as the icon for the 
quick tip.
	
3.	Create a keyframe animation in which text flies out from the Symbol.
	
	For example, create a text box directly over the quick tip Symbol and 
shrink it down to almost nothing.
	
4.	Create a keyframe animation so that it moves up and to the left of the 
quick tip and slowly enlarges to 100%. Set the visibility to On for the 
duration of the transition.
	
5.	Add a Stop Stage trigger right after that keyframe.
	
6.	Create a second keyframe animation (after the Stage trigger) so that 
the enlarged text shrinks back down to nearly 1% and moves back to 
over the Quick Tip Symbol. Set the visibility to On at the beginning 
and then to Off at the end.
	
7.	Add a second Stop Stage trigger at the end of the second keyframe.
	
8.	Insert labels into the Timeline to show where the text enlarges and 
where the text shrinks.
	
	 At this point, your Timeline should look similar to Figure 18-8.
	
	 Now you need to add an action to the Quick Tip element.
	
Figure 18-8: 
Timeline 
showing 
keyframes 
for the 
Quick Tip 
animations.
	

279
 Chapter 18: Building an Interactive Tutorial
	
9.	Right-click the Quick Tip element, choose Open Actions, choose Click, 
and then edit the code (see Figure 18-9).
	
Figure 18-9: 
Edit the 
label to start 
the action 
where 
the text 
enlarges.
	
	
10.	Create a means for the student to close the text:
	
a.	Import an X icon image and place it in the top-right corner of the 
text box.
	
b.	Set the visibility to On at the point in the Timeline when the text 
completely enlarges.
	
c.	Set the visibility to Off when the text starts to shrink, as shown in 
Figure 18-10.
	
Figure 18-10: 
Edit the vis-
ibility of the 
close icon.
	
	
11.	To enable the student to close the text box, add an action to the X icon 
element, as shown in Figure 18-11.

280
Part V: Creating Sample Projects 
	
Figure 18-11: 
Code for 
closing the 
text box.
	
	
	 You’re ready to convert this project into a Symbol.
	
12.	Right-click and choose Convert to Symbol.
	
13.	In the dialog box, name the Symbol and uncheck Autoplay Timeline, 
as shown in Figure 18-12; then click OK.
	
	 This stops the Symbol from automatically playing when the main anima­
tion starts to play.
	
Figure 18-12: 
Name the 
Symbol and 
uncheck 
Autoplay 
Timeline.
	
	
14.	Copy this Symbol and paste it into the main composition (or you can 
export the Symbol if you want to import it into several different 
compositions).
And that’s how you create an animated Symbol that plays independently of 
the main Timeline.

Children’s Book

T

his chapter presents a basic outline on how to create an animated chil­
dren’s book. What I don’t do is provide step-by-step directions on ani­
mating the actual story. Writing and animating the story are up to you. The 
writing part, well, that’s completely up to you; but by reading this book, you 
find out how to animate the story. This chapter provides tips on how to add 
subtle refinements to your animation project and how to organize and plan a 
children’s book.
Overview Planning
To animate an interactive children’s book, the first thing you gotta do is write 
the story. (I realize that’s probably common sense, but I’ve been guilty of 
wanting to jump ahead a few steps in times past, so I thought I’d add that as 
a gentle reminder.) So, step one is to write the story and create a storyboard 
that outlines how the book progresses.
Before you start animating, the second item to check off is gathering your 
assets. Whether that means hiring an illustrator to create the artwork, doing 
it yourself, buying stock art from various websites, or using copyright-free 
images off the Internet is up to you. Regardless of your methods, be sure to 
get at least one image that you can use for the background, or multiple back­
ground images if your story takes place in more than one location. Having 
a consistent background image helps in placing your characters and text 
boxes, and it facilitates an interactive table of contents.

282
Part V: Creating Sample Projects 
In addition to the artwork, think about what kind of font(s) you want to use in 
your book. Now is a good time to review the section in Chapter 12 on working 
with fonts.
Once you have your storyboard created and your artwork is ready to go, it’s 
time to start thinking about how to organize your Timeline in Adobe Edge 
Animate CC. Decide how to create segments in the Timeline, how to use 
labels to help you visualize where Chapter One starts, where Chapter Two 
starts, and so on. Think of the keyframe animations for each chapter as seg­
ments. You also want to segment some time for the table of contents (TOC). 
At first blush, you may think about creating a Symbol for the TOC, but for 
My thinking process on how to 
create the table of contents
Probably one of the most important techniques 
to learn while creating an animated book is 
proper development of the table of contents 
(TOC). I stumbled onto this one when I first tried 
to create an animated children’s book. My initial 
plan was to make the TOC a Symbol. I wanted 
the TOC to behave independently of the main 
Timeline so that it appeared and disappeared 
based on the audience’s interaction.
The tricky part was creating links in the TOC 
so that the audience could jump from chapter 
to chapter (or page to page). The easiest way 
to do so is to use Play From actions utilizing 
labels from the main Timeline. The problem is 
that Symbols behave independently of the main 
Timeline and, therefore, don’t recognize labels 
from the main Timeline.
My second thought was to use URLs in the 
action, but for that to work, I would have to 
create each chapter as its own Edge Animate 
project, which would create tons of files and 
tons of uploading (because I would have to 
upload each project separately and each proj­
ect would have its own URL). I suppose for very 
lengthy books that approach is a viable option, 
but most children’s books aren’t lengthy — 
think of Goodnight Moon as compared to Game 
of Thrones.
Finally, I ditched the idea of using a Symbol for 
the TOC. Instead, I created a segment in the 
main Timeline in which I placed my TOC anima­
tions and links. You can read the details on how 
I did this later in the chapter.
I do realize that most children’s books do not 
contain chapters. If your book does not con­
tain chapters per say, every time you read the 
word “chapter,” simply replace it with the word 
“page.” If your book is extremely short, you may 
want to skip creating a TOC. For longer books 
that need more than one sitting to read, I rec­
ommend a TOC.
If your book becomes very long, loading times 
may be affected. If it takes too long for your 
book to load, consider dividing the book into 
multiple Edge Animate files (different projects) 
to reduce the file size. If you do make multiple 
files for your book, you need to use URL links in 
your TOC instead of linking to labels from the 
Timeline.

283
 Chapter 19: Animating an Interactive Children’s Book
this example, I show you how to use labels from the main Timeline to create 
links for the TOC, which is why the TOC is part of the main Timeline and not 
a Symbol.
	
Symbols are used to create animations that are independent of the main 
Timeline. Symbols have their own set of labels for their own Timeline. Symbols 
don’t recognize labels from the main Timeline.
Finally, before you start animating, here are few things to consider doing:
	
✓	Set the Visibility of elements to turn on when you want them to appear 
and turn off when you want them to disappear.
	
✓	Add labels in the Timeline to signify when different chapters (or pages) 
start and for use with Play From actions.
	
✓	Create different text boxes for headers, body paragraphs, and each 
different link or navigation button.
Formatting the Text Boxes
Although Adobe Edge Animate CC has many features, settings, and properties 
for text, it isn’t intended for text-heavy projects, which is fine for children’s 
books that may contain only a few lines of text on each page. Edge Animate is 
also good for creating children’s books because you can enable interactivity 
by creating links with the text boxes and other elements.
Creating a different text 
box for each element
For Edge Animate CC, you must create a separate text box whenever you 
want to use different formatting for the text. For example, if you use different 
font sizes or colors for the chapter headings than you use for the main text, 
you need to create different text boxes for the different types of text.
You also have to create separate text boxes for each link in the TOC. Although 
it may seem easier to create a single text box with a long list of chapter titles, 
doing so won’t work in this example. Each text box can contain only one Play 
From action, which you use to create the links. So, each chapter title in the 
TOC must have its own text box.

284
Part V: Creating Sample Projects 
Using shadow on text appropriately
Say that your background image consists of blue skies and white puffy clouds. 
If you use a light-colored text, your text may become lost or hard to read over 
the white clouds. Or say that you want to use the color blue for the TOC link 
and place it in the top-left corner of the Stage on top of a blue sky — using blue 
on blue may make it hard for your audience to read or even see the text.
To help with this, I recommend placing a subtle shadow on the text to make 
it easier to read (see Figure 19-1).
	
Figure 19-1: 
Add a 
shadow to 
your text for 
easier 
reading.
	
To create the shadow, follow these steps:
	
1.	Check the Pin to make sure it’s not toggled and be sure that Edge 
Animate doesn’t automatically create keyframes as you perform these 
steps.
	
2.	Select the text box.
	
3.	From the Properties panel, toggle No Shadow to enable adding shad­
ows, as shown in Figure 19-2.
	
Figure 19-2: 
Enable the 
Shadow 
properties.
	

285
 Chapter 19: Animating an Interactive Children’s Book
	
4.	Change the shadow color to black and set each of the properties to 1, 
as shown in Figure 19-3.
	
Figure 19-3: 
Configure 
the shadow 
for subtlety.
	
You now have a shadow on your text, which makes the text easy to read 
when it’s placed over images, as shown in Figure 19-4.
	
Figure 19-4: 
Text with 
a slight 
shadow is 
easier to 
read.
	
Creating a Segmented Timeline
Although I don’t go into the specifics of animating an interactive children’s 
book (after all, the story you tell and how you tell it are up to you), I do want 
to provide a list of items to keep in mind while animating your story:
	
✓	Label the start of each chapter (or page) to create a segmented 
Timeline. This makes it easy to see where each part of the book starts. 
You can use the labels for your Play From actions as well. Also, insert a 
label for where you want your TOC animation to start.

286
Part V: Creating Sample Projects 
	
✓	Set the Visibility property for each of your elements to On (instead of 
using the default Always On) at the appropriate times.
	
✓	Animate each segment to tell your story.
	
✓	Place a Stage trigger to stop the animation at the end of each segment. 
Otherwise the story keeps playing, and the audience loses control over 
when they want to move forward.
	
✓	Turn the Visibility of elements to Off just after the Stage Stop trigger for 
each segment. (Unless, of course, you want those same elements visible 
in the next segment.)
	
✓	If you plan to use a consistent background image throughout the story, 
you can leave that element’s Visibility setting at Always On so that the 
image is visible when the TOC opens — and so your audience doesn’t 
experience a blank Stage when they open the TOC.
Navigating the Story
In this section, I discuss a couple ways for your audience to navigate through 
your story. I present how to build an interactive table of contents (TOC) and 
discuss how to place navigation links for your audience to advance the story 
or return to a previous page.
	
Place the forward and back navigation links as you animate each chapter or 
page. That way, when you preview the story in a browser, you can test the 
navigation as you edit each chapter or page. You may wait until you finish 
animating the story before you add the TOC, simply because you may not 
have all your labels in place until the end.
Placing the next and back navigation
Consistency is always the key to good navigation. Don’t make your audience 
guess where or how to move the story forward. If you want to use more cre­
ative text than “Next” or “Back” to indicate the navigation, be sure you make 
clear what your audience needs to do to advance the story. For example, add 
something like “Find out what happens to the bear by clicking the beehive.”
If that approach is still too dry, you can do something along the lines of, “The 
bear swatted at the beehive with his paw. Can you help him get the honey 
by knocking down the bee hive?” Then make the beehive glow for a moment. 
Such visual clues will clearly signal the audience to click the beehive to 
advance the story.

287
 Chapter 19: Animating an Interactive Children’s Book
Using standard and consistent buttons for navigation is a tried-and-true 
approach, and this is how you do it:
	
1.	Use the Stage guides to align your navigation buttons or text.
	
	 The Stage guide helps you consistently place the elements in the same 
location for each page (see Figure 19-5).
	
Figure 19-5: 
Use the 
guides to 
help place 
elements.
	
	
2.	Make sure the Pin is not toggled, and place the text or image on 
the Stage.
	
3.	Advance the Playhead to the point in the Timeline where you want 
the navigation element to appear — for example, at the end of 
Chapter One.
	
4.	From the Properties panel, turn the visibility On for the navigation 
element (see Figure 19-6).
	
Figure 19-6: 
Turn the vis-
ibility from 
Always On 
to On.
	
	
5.	Right-click the element and add an action to the element (click Play 
From) and use the label for Chapter 2, for example (see Figure 19-7).

288

Add a Play 
From action 
for the 
Navigation 
link.
	
	
6.	Slide the Playhead down the Timeline to the end of the first chapter 
and just after the Stop Stage trigger. Change the visibility to Off, as 
shown in Figure 19-8.
	
Figure 19-8: 
Turn the 
visibility to 
Off after the 
Stage Stop 
trigger.
	
	
	 Repeat this procedure, using a unique element, for each navigation ele­
ment. You can create the back navigation in the same manner.
Building the table of contents
Using a TOC is a nice touch that adds another level of professionalism to 
your interactive book.

289
 Chapter 19: Animating an Interactive Children’s Book
Create a TOC only if it truly benefits your audience. For example, if you create 
a book in which your audience may want to skip around to different parts, a 
TOC can be useful. A TOC may also be useful if the story takes more than one 
sitting to read; however, if your audience can read through the book in 5 to 15 
minutes, a TOC isn’t necessarily beneficial. Figure 19-9 shows the TOC that I 
talk about in the following sections.
	
Figure 19-9: 
An example 
of format-
ting a table 
of contents.
	
Formatting the table of contents
Before you start formatting the TOC, advance the Playhead to a point in the 
animation where the visibility for all other elements is turned off. This gives 
you a clear working space for formatting the TOC. For example, move the 
Playhead to the far end of the Timeline.
	
Make sure that the Pin isn’t toggled and that Edge Animate is not set to start 
automatically creating keyframes. Otherwise Edge Animate creates keyframes 
as you format the TOC.
How to create a table of contents:
	
1.	Draw a rounded rectangle to create a container for the TOC. Place it 
along the left side of the Stage.
	
2.	From the Properties panel, in the Corners section, choose the 4-corner 
formatting option.
	
3.	Format the corners so that those at top-right and bottom-right are 
slightly rounded (see Figure 19-10).
	
4.	Format the top-left and bottom-left corners to appear square (simply 
click the box for that corner) to create a tabbed look (see Figure 19-10).

290

Figure 19-10:

tabbed look 
for the TOC 
container.
	
	
5.	Use a 50% Opacity setting for the background of the rounded rectan­
gle so that the background image is visible through the element (see 
Figure 19-11).
	
Figure 19-11: 
Use 50% 
Opacity to 
see through 
the TOC 
container.
	
	
6.	Create a separate text box for each chapter or page of the book and 
place them vertically within the rounded rectangle.
	
	 Use the guides to help you align the text boxes, as shown in Figure 19-9.

291
 Chapter 19: Animating an Interactive Children’s Book
	
7.	Format the text in a traditional blue color to signify it’s a link, as 
shown in Figure 19-12.

this step.

After you complete formatting the TOC, you can start to animate it so that 
the audience can interact with it.

Part V: Creating Sample Projects 
Animating the TOC
The animation for the TOC consists of the TOC sliding out from the left when 
the TOC link is clicked. (Placing the TOC link is the last procedure in this 
chapter, right after this one.) When the audience clicks one of the TOC links, 
the TOC disappears from the Stage. Here are the steps for this process:
	
1.	Insert a label in the Timeline to designate where you want to start the 
TOC animation.
	
	 You use this label later for the TOC link.
	
2.	Move the Playhead down the Timeline to where you inserted the TOC 
label.
	
3.	Toggle the Pin to start automatically creating animated keyframes.
	
4.	Move the Playhead down the Timeline to indicate the length of time 
that you want the TOC to take to slide onto the Stage, as shown in 
Figure 19-14.
	
Figure 19-14: 
Toggle the 
Pin and move 
the Playhead 
down the 
Timeline to 
animate the 
TOC sliding in 
from the left.
	
	
5.	Select all the TOC elements and move them onto the Stage. This cre­
ates a keyframe animation.
	
6.	For each TOC element
	
a.	Select the element and right-click it (for example, choose Open 
Actions and then Click) to add an action (for example, Play From).
	
b.	Type the label as shown in Figure 19-15.

293
 Chapter 19: Animating an Interactive Children’s Book
	
Figure 19-15: 
Add a Play 
From click 
action to

7.	Add a Cursor attribute for each of your TOC elements (Figure 19-16).
	
Figure 19-16:

attribute to

8.	Place a Stage Stop trigger at the end of the TOC segment in the 
Timeline.
	
9.	Move the Playhead slightly past the Stage Stop trigger and then turn 
off the visibility for each of the TOC elements.
You have now created the animation for the TOC. The next step is to create a 
way for the audience to open the TOC.

294
Part V: Creating Sample Projects 
Placing the TOC text box link
In this section, I present a procedure on how to create a means for your audi­
ence to access the TOC. At the beginning of the animation, the TOC is not 
visible. You want to create an element that enables the reader to open the 
TOC. If you don’t want to use a text box to create the link to open the TOC, 
you can just as easily use an image or a drawn element. Whatever you choose 
to use, make sure it signifies that, by clicking (or tapping) it, the audience 
knows it’s opening the TOC.
Here’s how to create an element that opens the TOC:
	
1.	Place the Playhead in the point in the Timeline where you want the 
TOC link to appear.
	
	 For example, you may want the TOC link to appear directly after an 
opening title screen or at the end of the first page or chapter.
	
2.	Find a place on the Stage where you want the TOC link to consistently 
appear — for example, in the top-left corner of the screen.
	
3.	Draw a text box and type Table of Contents, or whatever you think is 
appropriate.
	
4.	From the Properties panel, change the visibility from Always On to On.
	
5.	Add an action to the TOC element (right-click the element, then 
choose Open Actions➪Click➪Play From, and then type in the TOC 
label), as shown in Figure 19-17.
	
Figure 19-17: 
Adding a 
Play From 
action that 
specifies 
Click for  
the TOC 
element.
	
	
6.	Move the Playhead down the Timeline to the point in the animation 
where you want the TOC element to turn off and change the visibility 
setting to Off from the Properties panel.

295
 Chapter 19: Animating an Interactive Children’s Book
	
Here’s a trick for getting the TOC element (the link) to disappear when the 
TOC is open:
	
1.	Make sure the TOC animation (when it slides in from the left) is at the 
very end of the animation, after all the chapters.
	
2.	Set Visibility for the TOC element link to On at the beginning of the 
book.
	
3.	Set Visibility to Off at the end of the project’s last chapter, but before 
the start of the TOC animation.
	
4.	Place a Stage Stop trigger at the end of the last chapter.
	
	 Otherwise the TOC animation plays at the end of the last chapter.
	
Place Stage Stop triggers at the end of each chapter to stop the animation; 
otherwise the story continues to play. For more information on Stage Stop 
triggers, refer to Chapter 5.

Animating Navigation Menus
In This Chapter
▶	Creating an animated drop-down menu
▶	Importing your slideshow project as a Symbol for use in a one-page site
▶	Using mouseovers as actions
▶	Using Open URL actions
▶	Creating a navigational header for a larger site
▶	Creating a one-page site
E

dge Animate is good for creating one-page sites and headers within 
larger sites. Within these headers, you can add navigation to other parts 
of the parent site. The example in this chapter shows how to create an ani­
mated header for a company with three main business units. The animation 
includes the feature of rollover text for each business unit and links for the 
visitor to dive deeper into the site.
	
A great example of a one-page site is a restaurant site. Restaurant sites tend 
to have a limited amount of text and an abundance of imagery depicting the 
dining room, the staff, and of course the food. Don’t let the term one-page site 
trick you though; even though the site won’t have multiple pages, you can still 
present the appearance of many different pages just by swapping out the text 
and adding a slideshow. In this chapter, I show you how to create such a site, 
using an animated drop-down menu.
Creating a One-Page Website
You can create an entire website with Adobe Edge Animate CC, provided you 
keep it relatively simple. I’m not suggesting that you can create a complex 
site with tons of text and hundreds of pages; you are better off using another 
tool for that task. However, it’s completely plausible to create simple web­
sites with limited text with Adobe Edge Animate CC.

298
Part V: Creating Sample Projects 
As I mentioned, an excellent example of a one-page website is a restaurant 
site because it tends to have limited text, perhaps a paragraph or two per 
page, and it tends to rely on imagery to convey its message. The heavy use of 
imagery lends itself to slideshow animation (refer to Chapter 16 for more on 
creating slideshow animation), which you can import into your one-page site 
as a Symbol.
The following sections provide details on creating animated drop-down 
menus with top-level and sub-level menu items (as shown in Figure 20-1). I 
also show how to set up the actual content, through the example of import­
ing a slideshow Symbol.
	
Figure 20-1: 
Create 
animated 
drop-down 
menus 
with Edge 
Animate.
	
Creating the top-level menu items
The following procedure describes how you can set up the top-level menu 
items:
	
1.	Place the guides on the Stage to evenly align the menu items.
	
	You can use Modify➪Distribute (from the main menu) to help align 
elements as well.
	
2.	Create a separate text box element for each top-level menu item.
	
3.	Add a cursor attribute to each element.
	
4.	Change the visibility to On for each element, even though the top-
level menu items are always visible.
	
5.	Insert a label in the Timeline to indicate where the sub-level menu 
animation occurs.
	
6.	Place a Stop Stage trigger (see Chapter 5) before the first sub-level 
animations begin, as shown in Figure 20-2.

299
 Chapter 20: Animating Navigation Menus
	
Figure 20-2: 
Use a Stop 
Stage 
trigger to 
prevent the 
animation 
from playing 
before the 
visitor clicks 
a link.
	
	
7.	Right-click the first top-level menu item and add an action (Open 
Actions➪Click, Play From) to start playing from the first sub-level ani­
mation segment of the Timeline, using the label that you inserted in 
Step 5 (see Figure 20-3).
	
Figure 20-3: 
Add a Click, 
Play From 
action to 
create a link 
to the sub-
level menu.
	
Now you need to create the sub-level menu.
Creating the sub-level menu items
The sub-level menu opens when the visitor clicks a top-level menu item. You 
can animate how the sub-level menu opens. In the following procedure, I 
show how to create an effect in which the drop-down menu appears to liter­
ally drop-down, with each sub-level menu item appearing one at a time as 
the menu opens. You achieve the drop-down menu animation effect with the 
Clipping tool, as shown in Figure 20-4. I then turn the visibility to On for each 
sub-level menu item as the clipping animation reveals each item. I describe 
this procedure in detail in the following section.

300
Part V: Creating Sample Projects 
	
Figure 20-4: 
Use Clipping 
to reveal the

container.
	
Opening animation for the sub-level menu
To create the sub-level menu, follow these steps:
	
1.	Move the Playhead to the point in the Timeline where you inserted 
the label for the first sub-level menu item.
	
2.	Create a separate text box for each sub-level menu item.
	
	 In this example, I changed the font color to white to make it easier to 
read against a multi-colored background (see Chapter 10).
	
3.	Add a Cursor attribute to each text box element.
	
4.	Draw a rectangle box over the menu list to act as a container.
	
	 In this example, I used a 50% Opacity setting with a black background. I 
also rounded the bottom corners but left the top corners square. These 
settings are shown in Figure 20-5.
	
Figure 20-5: 
Format 
the menu 
container 
from the 
Properties 
panel.
	

301
 Chapter 20: Animating Navigation Menus
	
5.	Toggle the Pin and select the menu container.
	
6.	Use the Clipping tool to create an animated effect of unveiling the 
rectangle, as though it were sprouting from the top-level menu item.
	
	 See Chapter 9 for more on clipping.
	
7.	Time the visibility for each sub-level menu item as the rectangle box 
reveals itself.
	
	 The best way to do this is to scrub the Playhead along the Timeline man­
ually to view when the clipping effect passes over each sub-level menu 
item. As the rectangle element unclips while you move the Playhead 
down the Timeline and passes over the sub-level menu item, change the 
Visibility setting for each of those elements to On. Figure 20-6 shows 
how that appears in the Timeline.
	
Figure 20-6: 
The key-
frames 
appear 
staggered 
along the 
course of 
the clipping 
animation.
	
	
8.	Add a Stop Stage trigger at the end of this animation.
At this point, you have an animation for opening the sub-level menu. To 
finish, you need to create the closing animation for the menu. I describe how 
to do so next.
Closing animation for the sub-level menu
In addition to creating an animation for when the menu opens, you can create 
an animation for when the menu closes. This animation occurs while the 
menu is open and the visitor clicks the top-level menu item.

302
Part V: Creating Sample Projects 
The following procedure describes how you can create the closing animation:
	
1.	Insert a label in the Timeline to indicate where you want the close menu 
animation to begin, such as at the end of the open menu animation.
	
2.	Swap out the top-level open menu element with a close menu element.
	
a.	Copy the top-level menu item.
	
b.	Turn the visibility to Off.
	
c.	Paste the menu item.
	
d.	Turn the visibility to On.
	
e.	Update the action to close the sub-level menu items (see Figure 20-7).
	
Figure 20-7: 
Update 
the action 
to reflect 
closing the 
menu.
	
	
3.	Reverse the animation sequences you made to open the menu to 
reflect closing the menu.
	
a.	Use the Clipping tool to create an animation in which the menu 
container (the rectangle) appears to roll up.
	
b.	Time the visibility of the sub-level elements so that they appear Off 
(that is, disappear) as the clipping occurs (Figure 20-8).
	
4.	At the end of the menu-close menu animation, add a Stage trigger in 
the Timeline to play from the beginning of the Timeline (see Figure 20-9).
	
	 This brings your visitor back to the beginning of the Timeline, where the 
click action for the top-level menu opens the sub-level menu.
	
5.	Just after the Stage trigger that you inserted, turn off the visibility for 
the menu-close element (top-level menu item text box) and the menu-
container element (the rectangle).

303
 Chapter 20: Animating Navigation Menus

Figure 20-9:

of the close

mations, add

ger to play

beginning.
	
At this point, you have animations for when the menu opens and closes. In 
the next section, I show you how to create an animation for when visitors 
click a menu item.
Navigating to new content
In this project, you create a one-page site with a menu. Although the site is 
considered a one-page site, that doesn’t mean all of the content is static. You 
can still make new content appear, as though visitors were clicking through 
to a new page, even though they remain on the same page. You can use the 
following procedure to create this navigation by inserting a slideshow as a 
Symbol.

304
Part V: Creating Sample Projects 
	
1.	Create a slideshow as described in Chapter 16.
	
	 You can skip adding the buttons if you want; I don’t use them in this 
example. Instead, I use an infinite loop so that the slideshow keeps 
repeating (at the end of the slideshow animation, insert a Stage trigger 
to play from the beginning).
	
2.	Convert the slideshow into a Symbol (refer to Chapter 12) and export it.
	
	Be sure to leave Autoplay selected. That way, when the visitor clicks the 
Gallery link from the menu, the slideshow automatically starts to play.
	
3.	Import the Symbol into this current project through the Library panel 
by clicking the + icon (see Figure 20-10).
	
Figure 20-10: 
Click the + 
icon next 
to Symbols 
to import a 
Symbol.
	
	
4.	Insert a label in the Timeline to indicate where the sub-level menu 
item’s content is animated.
	
	 In this case, name the label Gallery.
	
5.	Add an action (Click, Play From) for the sub-level menu item, using 
the label Gallery as shown in Figure 20-11.
	
Figure 20-11: 
Select the 
sub-level 
menu item 
and add a 
Click, Play 
From action.
	
	
6.	Place the Playhead over the Gallery label in the Timeline.
	
7.	Drag the Symbol from the Library panel onto the Stage.
	
8.	Change the visibility for the Symbol from Always On to On.

305
 Chapter 20: Animating Navigation Menus
Now when your visitor clicks Menu➪Gallery, the slideshow automatically 
starts to play. When your visitor clicks another menu item, the slideshow 
goes away.
Navigating with Mouseovers 
and Open URL Actions
So far in this book, I’ve discussed navigating in terms of being within an ani­
mation’s Timeline, using actions with clicks and Play From. In this section, 
I branch out and move toward navigating with the Open URL action. This 
works great when your animation is embedded within a larger — parent — 
site. By using an action with Open URL, you can place links within your ani­
mation to other pages of the parent site. That way, your visitor can navigate 
within your animation to access other parts of the site.
Another type of action I haven’t discussed much so far is mouseovers. 
Mouseovers (aka rollovers) are great for when a click isn’t necessary. For 
example, you can allow your visitor to scroll through a list of items, and as 
she scrolls, new information appears on the screen. That way, the visitor 
doesn’t have to click through each item to see more information. In the fol­
lowing procedures, I show you how to use an effective mix and Open URL 
actions and mouseover actions to create a functional and effective navigation 
menu, or a header, that you can embed into a larger site.
This example focuses on a business with three main departments. The three 
departments are listed vertically on the left, with room on the right for text 
that describes the different departments. When the visitor rolls over the dif­
ferent departments, different text appears on the right. When the visitor 
clicks the logo or one of the text links, she is taken to a page within the 
larger, parent site.
Placing the artwork and the text
You can use the following procedure to set up the project and get started:
	
1.	Gather your assets, including the URLs you want to link to and the 
text you want to appear.
	
2.	Size your Stage according to the space you want it to consume on the 
parent site.

306
Part V: Creating Sample Projects 
	
3.	Use the guides on the Stage to create partitions, using the rule of 
thirds — that is, with one-third of the space on the left and two-thirds 
on the right.
	
	 In Figure 20-12, you see that I even added guides to create margins 
for the text. Vertically, use the Stage to create three rows for the left 
column.
	
4.	Place the Always On elements on the Stage, such as the logos and the 
names of the business units on the left.
	
	 You may also want a consistent header at the top on the right.
	
Figure 20-12: 
Use the 
guides to 
partition the 
Stage and 
place the 
Always On 
elements.
	
	
5.	Add some kind of animation to the logos to draw attention to them.
	
	 I discuss how to make elements spin in Chapter 7. Later in this chapter, 
you find out how to add an Open URL action to the logos.
	
6.	Add a Stage Stop trigger after the initial animations.
	
	 If you don’t add the Stage Stop trigger, all the mouseover text appears in 
order. And you don’t want that to happen.
With the Stage set, it’s time to add the text that you want to appear when a 
visitor rolls a mouse pointer over one of the business units.
Adding the mouseover text
In this example, I use text that appears before the visitor clicks anything. This 
text is then replaced when a mouseover or click action occurs.
Follow these steps to add the rollover text:
	
1.	Draw a text box on the right within your guides and type the initial text.
	
2.	Change the visibility from Always On to On.

307
 Chapter 20: Animating Navigation Menus
	
3.	Segment your Timeline with labels for use with the mouseovers. Each 
label represents where in the Timeline the mouseover text appears. 
Insert the first label.
	
4.	Place the Playhead in the Timeline where you inserted the first label.
	
5.	Draw a text box on the Stage within your guides and type or paste the 
text.
	
6.	Set the visibility to On for the text.
	
7.	Insert a second label into the Timeline for the second business unit’s 
text.
	
8.	Just before the second label, add a Stage Stop trigger, as shown in 
Figure 20-13.
	
Figure 20-13: 
Insert Stage 
Stop trig-
gers in the 
Timeline 
after each 
business 
unit text.
	
	
9.	Place the Playhead in the same spot as the second label.
	
10.	Turn off the visibility for the first business unit text.
	
11.	Place a text box for the second business unit’s text on the Stage. Turn 
the visibility to On.
	
12.	Repeat Steps 1 through 11 for the third business unit’s text.
	
A nice aspect to using mouseovers is that the rollover text doesn’t go away if 
the visitor moves the mouse off the element — that is, of course, if she doesn’t 
mouse over another element that has a mouseover action.
Adding the mouseover and 
open URL actions
Use the following steps to add the mouseover and open URL actions.
	
1.	Right-click the top-left element for the first business unit to open the 
Actions panel.

308
Part V: Creating Sample Projects 
	
2.	Add a mouseover.
	
3.	Add a Play From action and use the label for the first business unit 
text. Test it in a browser to confirm that when you roll over the ele­
ment, the text changes on the right.
	
	 You can add animations to the text on the right to ensure that your audi­
ence notices that the text changes. Chances are that the text updating is 
fairly obvious.
	
	 Overusing animation can be just as bad as no animation at all. Be careful 
not to overdo it.
	
4.	Select the logos and add a cursor attribute.
	
	 It’s a good idea to start adding a cursor attribute first (before adding the 
link) for all links. I usually discover that I forgot to add it when I test the 
link. When the cursor doesn’t change, I think I didn’t add the link, but 
then when I click it and the link works, I realize I simply forgot to add the 
cursor attribute.
	
5.	Add the Click, Open URL action for the logo. Update the URL in the 
code to where you want your visitor to go, as shown in Figure 20-14.
	
Figure 20-14: 
Use the 
Open URL 
Action to 
navigate 
within the 
parent site.
	
At this point, you may realize that the spinning logo link may not be enough 
to prompt visitors to click, especially if they’re looking for a traditional-col­
ored text link to click. In this case, you can add a text link within the rollover 
text, as I describe next.
Adding text links
It’s a good idea to add a colored text link in your rollover text so that, for 
example, your audience can clearly navigate to the About Us page for a par­
ticular business unit to find more information. This is how you add the link:

309
 Chapter 20: Animating Navigation Menus
	
1.	Move the Playhead over the first label.
	
2.	Add a new text box under the business unit text and set the visibility 
to On. Don’t forget to set the visibility to Off right after the Stage Stop 
trigger.
	
3.	Right-click the text box element to add a Click, Open URL action, as 
you did for the logo.
	
4.	You can color the link any way you like, but the traditional hyperlink 
blue is R: 0; G: 0; B: 255.
	
	 See Chapter 10 for more information on formatting text.
	
5.	Repeat Steps 1 through 4 for each business unit.
You may even want to add text links within the initial text box just in case 
visitors don’t hover over the mouseover elements or don’t click the logos. 
If you decide to do so, remember to use a separate text box for each link, as 
shown in Figure 20-15. Also, remember to use the guides to evenly align each 
text box.
	
Figure 20-15: 
Each link 
needs its 
own text 
box 
element.
	
After completing the procedures in this chapter, you have an animated 
navigation system that you can incorporate into a larger parent site.
	
To post these projects online, refer to Chapter 14, where you find out how 
to get your animation ready for the web using the Publishing settings. Also 
refer to Chapter 15 for information on putting your composition on the web, 
including how to embed the animation in an existing web page.

T

his chapter discusses the details of formatting settings for a responsive 
web design. By using percentages (%) instead of pixels (px), you can 
create animations that automatically adjust to the size of a person’s browser. 
Using percent also helps with formatting for different mobile screen sizes for 
devices such as phones and tablets.
Currently, popular mobile screen sizes range from 4 inches to 7 inches to 
10 inches. Creating a separate animation for each type of device is not 
necessary. Instead, you can create a responsive web design as discussed in 
this chapter.
Starting at the Stage
To get started with creating a responsive web design, you need to set the 
width and height properties of the Stage to %.
You can also set the properties for maximum width and minimum width:
	
✓	For the minimum width, you can use either % or px.
	
✓	You can set the Max W property to none, px, or %. The default is None.
	
	To change the Max W property, click the drop-down arrow and then 
uncheck the None box, shown in Figure 21-1.

312
Part V: Creating Sample Projects 
	
Figure 21-1: 
Change 
the Max W 
property by 
clicking the 
drop-down 
arrow.
	
When you change the W and H properties from px to %, little white icons 
(ticks) appear on the Ruler, as shown in Figure 21-2. You can slide those ticks 
up and down the Ruler to simulate the effect of a person adjusting the brows­
er’s window size.
	
Figure 21-2: 
Change the 
Width and 
Height prop-
erties to % 
to enable 
browser-
resizing 
simulation.
	
If you have elements on the Stage that are also set to %, you see those ele­
ments adjust in size as the browser window is resized.

313
 Chapter 21: Building a Responsive Web Design
To test the width percentage settings for your design, experiment by using px 
instead of % for the minimum width:
	
1.	Start a new project and set the Stage width and height to 100%.
	
2.	Set the Min W to 600 px and leave Max W at None.
	
3.	Import an image and place it on the Stage.
	
4.	Set the image width and height to %.
	
5.	Slide the tick down the ruler and watch as the image resizes.
When you slide the tick past the minimum width, the image and Stage stop 
scaling down in size. If you preview this in a browser, you’ll see that the 
image becomes cropped when you size the browser smaller than the minimum.
	
The little caret (shown in Figure 21-3) that appears in the Ruler indicates the 
px width of the Stage when you use the percent setting.
	
Figure 21-3: 
The caret 
indicates 
the Stage 
size in px.
	
Setting the Layouts
You can apply the same percentage settings to elements for a responsive 
web design as you can for the Stage. You can set these properties a few ways. 
One way is to change the properties from pixel to percentage for each ele­
ment individually from the Properties panel. However, that option can be 
time-consuming, and it isn’t necessary. Adobe Edge Animate CC provides two 
different means for setting global parameters: layout defaults and layout pref­
erences. The layout preferences are geared toward scaling and sizing for each 
individual element in relation to the parent element. The layout defaults set 
the value for each element as either percent or pixel.

Set the layout defaults first and then override them as necessary with the 
layout presets.
Although the terms layout defaults and layout preferences may sound simi­
lar, they have different meanings, as I explain in the following sections. I 
cover the layout preferences in more detail in Chapter 8.
Using the layout defaults 
for responsive design
If you know that you want to use the same settings for all the elements and 
images that you use on the Stage, you can set the layout default values, as 
shown in Figure 21-4. You can open the Layout Defaults menu from the 
toolbar.
	
Figure 21-4: 
Go to the 
toolbar to 
open the 
Layout 
Defaults 
menu.
	
For a responsive web design, you can use a combination of px and % settings, 
depending on what you want to dynamically resize and what you want to be 
static.
	
To start off designing for responsiveness, I recommend the following settings:
	
✓	Set all of your elements to % (L, T, W, and H).
	
✓	Select the Use ‘img’ Tag for Images box.
	
✓	Select ‘auto’ for Image Height.

315
 Chapter 21: Building a Responsive Web Design
Changing the layout defaults to percentages sets the properties for all ele­
ments — text boxes, rectangles, ellipses, and images — to respond when the 
browser window is resized.
	
To keep your image size proportional (so that it doesn’t stretch oddly wide 
or long) when the browser is resized, set either the image width or the image 
height to Auto (use the check boxes shown in Figure 21-4 to configure your 
settings), but not both — nor neither one. You have to set either the width or 
the height to Auto to keep the image proportional as the window is resized 
(refer to Figure 21-4). The exception to this is when you work with SVG files 
(for example, an image of a pattern). In this case, you can set both width and 
height to %, and the image will still look good.
	
If you set your elements for percent, when you resize the Stage, the elements 
on the Stage also resize:
	
✓	To stop elements from resizing when you change the size of the Stage, 
change all the elements back to px.
Using the layout preferences 
for a responsive web design
Chapter 8 covers the details on the layout preferences, which you can find in 
the Properties panel, as shown in Figure 21-5.
	
Figure 21-5: 
Use the lay-
out presets 
from the 
Properties 
panel.
	
You can override the layout defaults that you configured from the toolbar 
with the layout presets from the Properties panel. This is useful if you want 
one of your elements to behave differently than the layout defaults.

316
Part V: Creating Sample Projects 
	
A big difference between the layout defaults and the layout presets is that the 
presets are intended to work with parent elements:
	
✓	Layout presets apply responsiveness to existing and/or multiple ele­
ments while layout defaults are for new compositions with no or few 
existing elements. In addition, the layout presets make it easier to apply 
certain responsive behavior such as scaling only the position, centering 
an image, and so on.
	
✓	If the element is not nested inside another element, Edge Animate treats 
the Stage as the parent element.
Here’s a fun way to experiment with how the layout presets work:
	
1.	Draw two elements on the Stage, such as a rectangle and an ellipse.
	
2.	Nest one of the elements into the other (drag and drop one element 
into the other from the Elements panel).
	
3.	Select both of the elements and set the Layout Preset to Scale Size (see 
Figure 21-6) and then click Apply.
	
Figure 21-6: 
Select the 
Scale Size 
Layout 
Preset to 
resize the 
child ele-
ment when 
the parent 
element is 
resized.
	
	
4.	Select only the nested element and resize it.
	
	 The parent element should remain unaffected.
	
5.	Select only the parent element and resize it.
	
	 The child element should resize along with the parent.
	
6.	Select the Stage and resize that to watch the two different elements 
resize.
	
	 For the next step, make sure the Stage width and height are set to %.

317
 Chapter 21: Building a Responsive Web Design
	
7.	Test the responsive web design aspect by dragging the tick mark 
along the ruler.
	
8.	Change the layout preset for one of the elements from Scale Size to 
Scale Position (see Figure 21-7).
	
Figure 21-7: 
Select 
the Scale 
Position lay-
out preset 
to affect the 
position of 
the element.
	
	
9.	Drag the tick mark in the ruler and note the difference in behavior for 
the element.
	
Elements do not have an auto feature like images do to keep proportions. If 
you want an element to maintain its width or height, you have to switch back 
to px rather than use %.
Testing Your Animation’s Responsiveness
The best way to find out how a responsive web design works is to test it 
before you start working on a real project. You can glean much from these 
experiments. For example, images can keep proportions, but drawn elements 
and text boxes do not if you use percentages instead of pixels. Also, drawn 
elements and text boxes won’t wrap around images if you resize the browser 
causing the window to shrink. Instead, drawn elements and text boxes resize 
to fit the new window dimensions — and either appear over the image or dis­
appear under the image.
	
You can affect whether the elements appear over or under the image by using 
the Arrange setting (right-click an element and choose Arrange and then select 
whether you want to bring an element forward or backward). This is the same 
as changing the order in the Elements panel.

318
Part V: Creating Sample Projects 
To test how different types of elements react to the browser window resizing, 
try the following:
	
1.	Set up the Stage for a responsive web design by setting the width and 
height to %.
	
2.	Set the layout default to %.
	
3.	Add different types of elements to the Stage, such as text boxes, 
images, and rectangles.
Adobe Edge Inspect
Adobe Edge Inspect, as the name implies, is 
part of the Edge suite of tools. This is a very 
handy Chrome extension that you install into 
both your Chrome browser and your mobile 
device. To download the Chrome extension, 
go to http://html.adobe.com/edge/
inspect. You do need a membership to the 
Adobe Creative Cloud to install this extension, 
which is available for free (as of this writing).
You also need to install the Inspect app on your 
mobile device:
	✓	iOS devices: www.adobe.com/go/
edgeinspect_ios
	✓	Android devices: www.adobe.com/go/
edgeinspect_android
	✓	Kindle Fire devices: www.adobe.com/
go/edgeinspect_amazon
For more information on installing, you can visit 
http://forums.adobe.com/docs/
DOC-2535.
After you have both the extension and the app(s) 
installed on your devices, you can pair your 
computer with your mobile device, enabling you 
to see your computer’s browser. To enable the 
synching, you must have all of your devices on 
the same wireless network.
The synch is limited to only the browser. If you 
switch to your desktop, your mobile device con­
tinues to display whatever was last on your web 
browser.
If for some reason your computer and devices 
don’t automatically synch to each other, you 
have to manually input your computer’s IP 
address (when you click the Edge Inspect 
button in the browser, it shows you the IP 
address) into your mobile device. That’s what 
I had to do to pair my Windows laptop to my 
Android phone. I also had to do it for my Kindle 
Fire. And that’s when I learned that in order to 
pair up multiple devices, you need to pay a $9.99 
per month membership.
The benefit to using Edge Inspect is that you 
can view your Edge Animate projects on your 
mobile device when you preview your anima­
tion in the browser. This means that you don’t 
have to upload your files to the web for test­
ing. You also don’t have to type in the URL for 
your project over and over. In addition, if you 
click any links in the browser running on your 
desktop machine, then all synched devices will 
also follow that link as well. The savings in time 
alone may be worth that ten bucks per month.

 Chapter 21: Building a Responsive Web Design
	
4.	Set different layout presets for the different elements.
	
5.	Nest some elements into each other.
	
6.	Drag the tick on the Ruler around (both the vertical and the horizon­
tal) and see how the different elements react.
	
	 You can also preview in a browser to see how the elements react when 
you resize the browser window.
	
You can also use Adobe Edge Inspect to view how your design looks on differ­
ent types of devices. I discuss this in the Adobe Edge Inspect sidebar.

A

dobe Edge Animate CC has many more uses than just ten, but here I list 
the top ten that immediately rise to the top of my mind. You may find 
some of them elementary, whereas others may evoke fresh ideas for things 
you can do with Edge Animate, from creating basic slideshows, to creating 
advertisements, to creating an e-learning tool. You may even come up with a 
way to animate a game with Adobe Edge Animate CC.
Animating with Edge Animate
Yes, you can animate with Edge Animate. Shocking, I know. But if I didn’t list 
animating as a use for Edge Animate, I’d be missing a big one. The animations 
that you create can be as simple as a sun rising over a hill or as complex as 
all the stars and planets moving through the universe. The only limitation is 
your own imagination as to what you want to create and put into motion.
Designing with Edge Animate
You can also design with Edge Animate. Although Edge Animate is not neces­
sarily a design tool, designers can work with Edge Animate rather easily, so 
designing with Edge Animate is a legitimate use. You may not draw overly 
complex illustrations with Edge Animate, at least not with 1.0, but you can 
place and move elements about the Stage in a simple way to create works of 
art. And that, to me, is designing.

324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Developing with Edge Animate
Good developers who know their code wouldn’t let this missing feature stop 
them from adding sound to their Animate project. Instead, developers who 
know their stuff can dive in to the JavaScript and add the code necessary to 
incorporate sound into their animation.
The persistent code window, as I discuss in Chapter 2, is there for develop­
ers to take full advantage of when they want to edit or add to the code. Edge 
Animate’s code window allows you to view all the available code or just the 
relevant parts for a particular element. Either way, Adobe made it easy for 
developers to dive in and work their magic.
Learning from Edge Animate Projects
E-learning specialists and teachers may delight in knowing that it’s possible 
to create animated tutorials with Edge Animate. In Chapter 18, I explain how 
to build an example of what an interactive and animated tutorial can look 
like. Everyone, from kids to adults, can benefit from an easy-to-use and intui­
tive touch-screen interface on their tablets and phones.
You can create animated tutorials that teach everything from how to use a 
remote control for your television to how to use a tablet. If someone needs 
to become skilled at something, there’s a good chance you can make an ani­
mated and interactive tutorial to instruct them.
Working with Edge Animate 
as a Professional
As a web professional, you’ll find Edge Animate useful for an endless list of 
items. If you have a site that needs a little energy injected, Edge Animate is a 
great tool for you to:
	
✓	Build animated logos.
	
✓	Build slideshows (refer to Chapter 16).

325
 Chapter 22: Ten Users of Edge Animate
	
✓	Build one-page sites such as for a restaurant or an interactive brochure 
(refer to Chapter 20).
	
✓	Animate a children’s book (refer to Chapter 19).
If you decide to animate your company’s logo, try to keep it simple. Overdoing 
an animation and making it more complex than necessary can do more damage 
than good. You don’t want to confuse your visitor by a logo dancing and 
bouncing across the screen, if there’s no apparent purpose. On the other hand, 
giving your logo a nice little spin can gain the attention that it deserves.
Animating as a Hobby
Animating as a hobby is my favorite use for Edge Animate. While I was learn­
ing to use the tool, I made several animations for my other favorite hobby, 
playing video games. I created a site called GoozerNation, where a team 
of contributors and I discuss all things video games. After Edge Animate 
came out, this site started boasting Edge Animate projects in addition to 
just articles. Figure 22-1 shows a still shot of an animation I created using 
Commander Shepard from the popular video game franchise Mass Effect. 
When “Mass Effect 3” released, an Internet meme characterized a phrase that 
the Commander repeats during the course of the game (that is, he endorses 
a particular store and repeats ad nauseum that store is his favorite). My twist 
on the meme was that Commander Shepard’s favorite site on the Internet 
was my own. The animation was cheesy and badly done. It mostly consisted 
of the Commander’s mouth opening and closing, which was supposed to rep­
resent him speaking the words that appeared to his right. I even added a Play 
Again link so that people could watch it over and over.
You can view the animation here: http://goo.gl/vuNsV (I used Google’s 
URL shortener to save you a bunch of typing)

326
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Selling with Edge Animate
Creating advertisements with Edge Animate is another excellent use for the 
tool. Unlike Flash, Edge Animate uses HTML5 and JavaScript, so your audi­
ence can view your ad on Apple devices. That way, you know your ad can 
appear on iPads and iPhones.
Popular advertisement sizes include
	
✓	Leaderboard: 728 x 90
	
✓	Medium rectangle: 300 x 250
	
✓	Wide skyscraper: 160 x 600
	
✓	Full banner: 468 x 60
	
✓	Large rectangle: 336 x 280
	
✓	Rectangle: 180 x 150
	
✓	Button: 120 x 60
	
✓	Square button: 125 x 125
When making your advertisement in Edge Animate, try designing it with 
a responsive web design. That way, no matter the screen size, your ad 
looks good.
Specializing Your Content
I read an article the other day about how using a tablet is a great way to 
create an economical kiosk for customer use. For example, say that you work 
in a car dealership; what if you provided a tablet for customers to preview 
cars, features, and options while they peruse the showroom floor. You can 
create an Edge Animate project that allows customers to do exactly that.
Here’s another example. Restaurant employees can use an Edge Animate 
composition on a tablet to show customers images of the day’s specials. 
Instead of using a paper menu, the tablet can display vibrant images of the 
dishes, which the customer can then sort though.

 Chapter 22: Ten Users of Edge Animate
Gaming with Edge Animate
You might consider making games with Edge Animate a stretch. After all, a 
key component to most games is sound, which Edge Animate lacks in the 
initial version. However, I don’t think making games with Edge Animate is 
entirely impossible. It just takes a ton of extra coding. So, making games with 
Edge Animate is most likely geared toward hardcore developers and not nec­
essarily designers or hobbyists.
With that said, I made a sort-of game using Adobe Edge Animate. The game, if 
you want to call it that, involves the audience clicking a basketball to make a 
basket (see Figure 22-2). When the audience clicks the ball, the ball launches 
up toward the basket with flames shooting out from it. The ball then swishes 
through the hoop and lands with a bounce. The audience is then invited to 
shoot another basket. Again, as with the Commander Shepard animation, it’s 
completely cheesy, but in a fun kind of way. To play the game yourself, you 
can find it online at http://goo.gl/9B8xg.
	
Figure 22-2: 
You can 
make games 
with Edge 
Animate, if 
you want to.
	
Using the Responsive Web Design Tools
A great use of Edge Animate is making responsive web designs. I go into 
detail on how to create a responsive web design in Chapter 21. This fea­
ture allows you to create animations that respond to different browser and 
screen sizes. I can envision a future in which many web-design jobs will make 
responsive web design a mandatory requirement; just think of all the differ­
ent screen sizes on the market today. You have your 4-inch to 6-inch phones, 
7-inch and 10-inch tablets, and any number of dimensions for laptops and 
desktop monitors.

328

Learning how to create a responsive web design may very well become 
essential for all web enthusiasts. If this is something that interests you, check 
out Adobe Edge Reflow, which is in development as of this writing but should 
be available sometime in 2013.

A

s you’ve no doubt noticed, you can find URLs to useful websites 
throughout this book; all can lead you to very handy information that 
you can use with your Adobe Edge Animate CC project. Some of the URLs 
point to websites, such as Adobe, where you can access the different software 
in the Creative Cloud. Other URLs point you in the direction of fonts that you 
can use in your Edge Animate project. Then there are the educational URLs 
that send you to API references, the W3C, and other informative sites.
I’ve grouped all of these URLs into one comprehensive chapter and grouped 
them into ten sections for easy reference. This includes finding a web host, a 
content management system, and FTP software, all of which is invaluable in 
getting your project online.
Last, I provide two links that I hope you consider visiting. These are links to 
my Adobe Edge Animate CC For Dummies Facebook page and Twitter account. 
I plan to keep these accounts running for as long as there’s an active audi­
ence. I’d love to hear from you and see what kinds of projects you conjure up 
after reading this book.
Adobe Links to the Creative Cloud
In case it’s escaped your attention (not likely, but hey, it can happen), Adobe 
has a ton of software residing in the virtual cloud. A great place to start is at 
a page called “Adobe & HTML,” located at http://html.adobe.com (see 
Figure 23-1).

330
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
	
Figure 23-1: 
Adobe 
wants to 
help you 
create 
the web.
	
At the Adobe & HTML page, you can learn about Adobe’s mission for the 
web, how it adheres to HTML standards, how it’s committed to Open Source 
projects, and there’s a section on Edge Tools & Services. It’s really an inter­
esting corner of the Internet to check out what Adobe is doing in terms of 
helping you create web content. There’s even a link to events, which take 
place around the world.
Here are more great Adobe URLs to check out:
	
✓	Adobe Edge Code: http://html.adobe.com/edge/code
	
✓	Adobe PhoneGap Build: http://html.adobe.com/edge/phone
gap-build
	
✓	Adobe Edge Reflow: http://html.adobe.com/edge/reflow
	
✓	Adobe Edge Inspect: http://html.adobe.com/edge/inspect
Online Font Resources
Even though Adobe Edge Animate CC doesn’t work great with tons of text, it 
does work well with small amounts of text, and it enables you to import tons 
of fonts. In Chapter 12, I show you how to import fonts from places such as 
Google. Figure 23-2 shows the Adobe Edge Web Fonts page.

331
 Chapter 23: Ten Online Resources
	
Figure 23-2: 
Adobe

Here is a short list of good places to find excellent fonts:
	
✓	Google’s web fonts: www.google.com/webfonts
	
✓	Adobe also has Typekit: http://html.adobe.com/edge/typekit
Referencing the APIs
For the developers out there, APIs serve as an excellent resource to find 
new coding information. For non-developers, APIs can at least provide back­
ground information that can help you make sense of the code you’re staring 
at in the code window.
Here are three useful API sites:
	
✓	Adobe’s Edge Animate JavaScript API: www.adobe.com/devnet-
docs/edgeanimate/api/current/index.html
	
✓	The jQuery site: http://jquery.com
	
✓	Google’s Hosted Libraries Developer’s Guide: https://developers.
google.com/speed/libraries/devguide
Google’s Hosted Libraries page has a ton of links that you can explore to 
learn even more.

332
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
The W3C
At times, I’ve felt that the W3C is antiquated and rather slow moving in terms 
of keeping HTML standards fresh and relevant, but the W3C site still serves 
the important purpose of being an excellent resource for learning how to use 
HTML tags. You may find this site beneficial while learning how to use HTML 
and CSS with your Edge Animate projects.
A separate source from W3C is the W3C online school (www.w3schools.
com/tags). You can click around the W3C school to learn a thing or two 
about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and more.
Adobe Fireworks
Adobe Fireworks has been around for awhile, and I’ve heard varying opin­
ions on the design tool. Certain sites, like Smashing Magazine, still run many 
articles praising the software. If you do check it out and like it, you may be 
happy to know that it’s available through Adobe’s Creative Cloud. Here’s the 
URL: www.adobe.com/products/fireworks.html. Plus, Fireworks works 
great with Edge Animate, as I discuss in Chapter 13.
You can find a great resource to find out more about Fireworks at John 
Dunning’s site: http://johndunning.com/fireworks.
Browser Usage
Chapter 1 has an entire section on browser compatibility — a very impor­
tant concern for most web designers and developers. Adobe Edge Animate 
CC does work great on all modern browsers, but that doesn’t include pre­
vious versions of Internet Explorer (older than version 9). To keep up to 
date on the current usage of Microsoft’s browser, check here: http://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers.
Hopefully, this page stays fresh with new updates, and even more hopefully, 
that old versions of IE will disappear from users’ computers so that we won’t 
have to worry anymore about whether our animations work in everyone’s 
browsers.

333

FTP Recommendation
Unless you host your own servers, or if you’re simply going the way of the 
downloadable app, you’re going to need a way to upload your animation files 
to the web. Luckily, FileZilla provides excellent software for you to do just 
that, which you can find at http://filezilla-project.org.
Even though FileZilla’s FTP software is intuitive and easy to use, you still 
may have some questions. In that case, check its online documentation at 
http://wiki.filezilla-project.org/Documentation.
Web Hosts
If you’re looking around for a web host so that you can show off all your 
animations, look no further than this site to compare all of the different 
offerings: http://webhostingchoice.com.
I can personally vouch for Bluehost, as I’ve been using the company for many 
years for several sites and I’ve never had a problem. And no, the company 
did not pay me to say that. I don’t mind recommending it based on several 
years of great service. You can find it here: www.bluehost.com.
Content Management Systems
If you want to start a blog, or some kind of news site with tons of content, you 
may want to add some animations to it. Several different types of Content 
Management Systems (CMS) are out there perfectly suited to serve this 
task. My personal choice has always been Joomla! You can check it out at 
www.joomla.org.
Another option for a CMS is WordPress. It even has a plug-in for Adobe Edge 
Animate CC: Go to http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/edge-suite.

Chapter 24
Ten Web Design Trends
In This Chapter:
▶	More images, less text
▶	To scroll horizontal or vertical, that is the question
▶	Designing headers and creative navigation
▶	Telling stories through the latest coding techniques
N

ew web design trends emerge every year — rounded corners, shadows, 
inset text. This year is no exception; new trends continue to appear, 
and I expect to update this chapter when it’s time to write version 2.0 of 
this book. 
One consistent factor is that new trends in web design appear to go hand-
in-hand with new coding capabilities. For example, at the beginning of web 
design, it was difficult to create rounded corners without using tables and 
several different images. These days, creating rounded corners is as easy as 
writing a few lines of CSS code — not to mention that you can ditch the tables 
and the extra images. 
The web design trends presented in this chapter, for the most part, represent 
not only new coding techniques but also new ways for your audience to inter­
act with your site in engaging ways. When you grab your audience’s attention 
and get them intrigued in your web design, you’re well on your way to retain­
ing that audience. By using Adobe Edge Animate, you can create all of the 
design trends listed here.
More Imagery and Illustration
Are you tired and bored of looking at a wall of text? Are all those small 
images and icons starting to look a bit dated? Does a solid background color 
make you yawn? If you feel that way, there’s a good chance your audience 
feels the same way. Adding more imagery and illustrations to your site can 
greatly improve your web design. To make your site look more current, add a 
subtle background image instead of using a white, grey, or black background.

336
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
In Chapter 3, I discuss importing images for use with your Animate composi­
tion and how to work with them. In Chapter 6, you can discover how to use 
images in the background and the difference between using a div tag and an 
img tag for the images. Chapter 8 has great information on setting Layout 
presets for your images. Chapter 12 goes into detail on using images from the 
Library panel. As you can see, this book can give you a strong start working 
with images in Edge Animate.
Horizontal Scrolling
Creating web designs with horizontal scrolling could take some courage— it’s 
rarely been done — but that doesn’t mean it hasn’t been done before and to 
great effect. A simple web search for “great horizontal websites” won’t leave 
you disappointed. You will find many great examples of art sites, galleries, 
and creative sites that use horizontal scrolling to great effect. 
While this type of navigation is still relatively new, by creating a site in this 
fashion you could place yourself at the head of the pack in terms of fashionable 
web design.
Vertical Scrolling
Just the opposite of horizontal scrolling is vertical scrolling. While scrolling 
vertically has been a popular web design trend for many years, in the past 
year or two it has been greatly exaggerated. 
Many sites, such as boingboing.net and twitter.com use a never-ending 
vertical-scroll technique that keeps the audience on the page. This never-
ending presentation style is designed to keep audience attention on a 
continuous search for more content.
Fixed Headers
If you decide to design an animated web page using the never-ending vertical-
scroll method, then you might want to think about adding a fixed header to 
your site. A fixed header is a navigation menu that rests at the top of the page 
and it remains visible as your audience scrolls down the page. This feature 
enables your audience to navigate quickly from where they are to a different 
section of your site — and always know where they are. 

337
 Chapter 24: Ten Web Design Trends
A fixed header is a convenience your audience can appreciate because they 
don’t have to scroll all the way back up to the top of the page to find the 
menu. Features that keep user convenience in mind will also keep your audi­
ence on your site for longer periods of time.
Creative Navigation
Getting creative with your navigation is neatly complementary to using more 
illustrations and images in your web designs. Instead of a basic text menu, 
use images to denote a link. After your users learn that they can click images 
to advance through your site, they’ll become more comfortable with looking 
for links in unusual places on your site. This kind of interaction opens up the 
opportunity to create easter eggs within your site. An easter egg, in this con­
text, represents seemingly hidden content that can surprise and excite your 
audience when they stumble across it. 
A great way to show your audience that an image or an icon is a link, is to 
use the Cursor attribute feature in Animate. When your audience passes the 
mouse pointer over a linked image, the cursor can change from a pointer to a 
hand, indicating a link (as discussed in detail in Chapter 5). 
Storytelling
Everyone loves an engaging story. So, why not design a site or animation that 
tells your audience an engaging story? Instead of creating a basic restaurant 
website that presents only images of the food and descriptions of ingredi­
ents, why not create a fanciful background story? In addition to listing your 
best dishes as being locally organic, farm-raised, sustainable goodness, why 
not add a story about the couple who got engaged between the main course 
and the dessert? You could add an animation of a ring dropping into a flute 
of champagne, complete with rising bubbles. Site visitors might have arrived 
at your restaurant site looking for a good meal, but they’ll stay to learn more 
about what goes on at the other tables. Storytelling website animations not 
only enhance presentation, they can connect with visitors’ life experiences.
Navigating within One Page
One-page websites — once known as brochure sites — are making a comeback. 
By keeping your audience on a single page that can take on the appearance of 

338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
various different pages, you can take advantage of the scrolling trend. Instead 
of clicking around to different pages in an attempt to find something, your 
audience can instead scroll through your site as they advance through your 
content. Links that serve as images can also help your audience jump directly 
to specific spots on the site when they know what they want — while still 
engaging someone who is casually searching.
By creating a site as described in this section, you are really taking advantage 
of a few current web design trends: scrolling for information, using more 
imagery, and implementing creative navigation. Chapters 19 and 20 provide 
examples of how to create a one-page site complete with navigation.
Moving Away from Flash
Adobe Flash was once the wave of the future, but that wave has crashed on 
the beach and a new wave is rolling in. Where Flash used to be the predomi­
nant tool for creating animations and websites, that tool’s heyday has come 
and gone. But I’ll stop short of calling it dead in the water. 
Adobe Edge Animate might not quite be ready to completely replace Flash, 
but it’s on its way to accomplishing just that. After all, you can’t view Flash 
on i-devices such as iPhones and iPads, and who wants to create content that 
appears broken on some of the most popular mobile devices around?
HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
The world of web design and coding techniques is constantly evolving. 
The big trend in code is HTML5 and CSS3, which are only going to become 
increasingly ingrained into the web-o-sphere. Google Chrome is leading the 
charge, implementing the latest standards — with Firefox and Safari right 
alongside. Then there’s Internet Explorer — currently a bit late showing up at 
the party — but Microsoft is making great strides in updating their browser 
to keep pace. In the first chapter of this book, I go into detail on HTML5 and 
browser compatibility. 
In Chapter 14, I discuss how to safeguard your animation from appearing 
broken on older versions of Internet Explorer by using the Down-level Stage 
and the different web publishing options that Edge Animate offers. In these 
regards, simply using Adobe Edge Animate could be considered a web design 
trend itself!

 Chapter 24: Ten Web Design Trends
Responsive Web Design
Responsive web design (RWD) is the latest rage these days. The concept 
behind RWD is to design one site for use on any number of devices, from 
desktop monitors to tablets to phones. While web designers might be split on 
whether to create a mobile site separately from a desktop site, or to create 
a single site that can respond to browser size, I see the trend tilting to the 
responsive camp. 
The reason for this is rather simple, by creating one responsive site, you 
don’t have to keep updating two different sites. Creating an RWD points in 
the direction of the future; the more advanced coding techniques and tools 
become, the better they’ll work with RWD. Consider it one more way Adobe 
Edge Animate puts you in the vanguard of web design trends. (Chapter 21 
goes into full detail on how to create an RWD using Animate.)
