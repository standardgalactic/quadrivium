The tech that’s so cutting edge, 
you’re risking your fingers  
just turning this page
gamechanger
Typical. Just when you think you’re getting a handle on the latest in TV technology, something new comes along and moves 
the goal posts once more. The gamechanger in question, curious T3 reader, is Samsung’s The Wall: a super screen concept 
revealed at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show. The eyeball-grabbing feature, no doubt, is its monstrous 146-inch 
panel, but honestly, unless you’re planning to star in your own MTV Cribs show, who wants to go that big? The really 
interesting feature, and one we think could shape the future of TVs, is the implementation of MicroLEDs. Unlike the 
majority of TV makers that opt to use OLED tech in their high-end sets, Samsung is sticking to its non-organic guns by 
using regular LED tech, albeit scaled down, making them smaller and more potent. Like OLED, MicroLED’s pixels are 
individually lit, giving the picture superior colours, contrast and brightness. But unlike OLED, Samsung is claiming its 
MicroLED TVs will offer premium picture quality at a lower price tag. Only time will tell…

connect-phwoar
Like some kind of mecha manga from the ’90s, The 
Wall has a unique power: to convert into different sizes 
by connecting to other units. You could, for example, 
create a huge display from several smaller screens, or 
stack them side by side to make a cinema-wide TV

Editor’s letter
i’m so excited about this issue of T3, because we get to 
bring you the results of some seriously exciting 
invitations we recently received. 
first, we went to the new french gP formula 1 circuit to 
drive an actual f1 car. When you’re watching at home, it’s 
so easy to idly wonder how hard it really is to keep control 
of those things. It turns out to be somehow both easier and 
even more complex than you might think – you can read 
about our whole experience on p84.
We also got an exclusive chance to sit down with Phil 
Schiller, apple’s VP of marketing, and a common face at its 
keynote presentations. I’m not sure he’s going to change 
anyone’s opinion of apple products one way or another, but 
getting to find out more about how it develops products, 
and what’s going to be big in the future, was fascinating.
It’s the time of year when a lot of people book their big 
holidays, so we’ve got our huge travel guide to help you find 
not only the most spectacular or luxurious destinations, but 
the tech and accessories you’ll want to make the most of 
them. This goes from noise-cancelling headphones to get 
you through the journey, to ideal cameras for different 
types of trip, to even ingenious beach blankets that never 
get sandy. Happy travels!

our mission is to bring you the clearest recommendations we 
can – and that means a great deal of hard work happens 
before a product even reaches our pages!
because we only feature products the T3 team would 
happily use ourselves, we end up discarding a significant 
number of options in each category before settling on a final 
shortlist to review. In this respect, T3 Select does exactly what 
it says on the tin, picking only the best of the best to test; the 
gear we know you’ll want to seriously consider purchasing. 
and that should mean an end to you having to undertake 
hours of painstaking research and product comparisons. 
you won’t see any duff products, but you will come away 
with clarity on which one is the best in its category or for a 
specific task: our awards badges (see below) ensure that 
everything T3 recommends is clearly highlighted on the page.
It goes without saying that every product in T3 Select has 
been thoroughly tested by our team of experts, enabling you 
to buy with total confidence.

  Hp  
envy x2
 From £999, hp.com
If you’re tired of juggling a laptop, tablet and 
other tech in order to work effectively on the 
go, then more robustly when you’re in the 
office, the always connected HP ENVY x2 
could throw you a lifeline. Why? Microsoft’s 
new aluminium hybrid is being positioned as a 
complete mobile device that’s so powerful 
you’ll have no need for an extra tablet. It’s 
lighter than an iPad Pro and is serving up 
ample firepower.
Everyone’s excited about laptops with 
Gigabit LTE connectivity, and the Windows  
10 S, Snapdragon 835-running ENVY x2 is no 
exception, promising lightning-fast download 
speeds and a reliable data connection thanks 
to an x16 LTE modem. We get annoyed with 
poor battery life on tech, so we’re impressed 
with the ENVY x2’s 20 hours’ battery life brag. 
That said, the incoming ASUS NovaGo (see the 
next page) is promising 22 hours. Whether 
either claim is true to life remains to be seen.
Chunkiness definitely has its place in tech, 
but not on this hybrid – its display is a mere 
6.9mm thick. Looks-wise, it doesn’t set any new 
style rules, but there are crisp lines, a glossy 
magnetic hinge and a brooding colour scheme 
to enjoy. So if you’re on the lookout for a 
powerful, streamlined work and play machine, 
the HP ENVY x2 (shipping in February) could 
be the one to ditch your other tech for.

 ASUS NovAGo 
 From $599 (£449.66), asus.com/uk
It might not look like the future of laptops, but the 
foldable NovaGo is rocking a few world firsts. For 
starters, ASUS’s newcomer is the first ‘always 
connected’ Gigabit LTE-capable laptop, with 
lightning-fast download speeds thanks to a 
Snapdragon 825 chipset and x16 LTE modem. 
According to ASUS, the NovaGo can download 
a two-hour movie in 10 seconds.
An eSIM ensures an always-connected 
experience, with up to 22 hours of video 
playback. ASUS is making a big deal about the 
NovaGo’s immediate response – just one press of 
the power button should wake the 13.3-inch 
NanoEdge display instantly. Don’t expect big 
innovation in the folding design stakes, but do 
get excited about the power and performance.

of always-connected laptops, promising mega

Singing aloud to our favourite songs is something 
T3 does all the time. We do it with gusto and 
often get the words wrong. That could change 
if we ponied up for Japan’s Cotodama Lyric 
Speaker, an artsy device that displays the lyrics 
of most songs played through it. Well, maybe not 
that obscure zydeco artist you listen to… 
The award-winning gadget streams tracks 
from Spotify, AirPlay and other services via its 
iOS/Android app, displaying fonts and graphics 
that, when analysed by the speaker’s built-in 
expression engine, apparently change in relation 
to the mood and structure of the song playing. 
Handmade and produced in tiny monthly 
batches of 15, there’s a distinct whiff of exclusivity 
about the Lyric Speaker. If you revel in owning 
tech that hardly anyone else does, you’ll love this.
T3 SAYS: The Lyric Speaker isn’t something any 
of us need, but it’s something many will want.

 roto vr chair

“You spin me right round, baby…” sang Dead or

dropped in 1984 and we’re in 2018, could have 
been singing about the Roto VR Chair. Why? 
Swivel action base. That doesn’t mean you’ll end 
up in a tangle of cables, though – plug your PC 
into the back of the chair instead!
The Roto VR Chair wants to provide you with a 
more immersive AR or VR experience, helping 
you explore 360 degrees without your feet 
touching the floor, while motorised turns work to 
provide a sense of weightlessness. The starter 
pack includes the chair, base, head tracker and 
touch pedals, enabling you to walk in a virtual 
environment even when seated. It also promises 
to combat motion sickness, which is good news 
for those susceptible to the queasies.

We haven’t tested the kit yet but we’re excited

bar, wireless subwoofer and two wireless 
surround sound speakers can achieve, especially 
with Polk’s SDA surround tech. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi

Modern life is crazy, and not all of us have the

it’s as simple as that with the Relax, a compact

wellness and meditation exercises.
Sonoro says exercises have been “produced 
in cooperation with renowned relaxation 
experts”, and that you can access them at the 
push of a button, along with soothing nature 
sounds. The point? To help you slow down, 
breathe and relax. You could do this in the

 freeflY Mov 
 $299 (£223.95), gomovi.com
Imagine hiring a Hollywood film crew to shoot

could certainly recommend alternative ways for 
you to spend that dump of cash, including 
dropping a fraction of it on the Freefly Movi, an 
affordable smartphone cinema robot dubbed 
the “Hollywood film crew for your phone”.
Aimed at mobile filmmakers, the Movi 
houses one of Freefly’s world-class gimbals and 
creates innovative shots with the help of an 
app. You simply sit your phone in the Movi’s 
frame and go from there. The Movi can handle 
several pro-level shooting modes, including 
Orbit, where the shot is fixed on your subject 
as you circle around them like a human drone.

When you unlock your computer or 
phone, it gives you access to all of your 
most sordid and sensitive information. 
But then it just trusts that you’re still 
you an hour later, rather than someone 
else who’s stuffed you in a closet. 
Enter continuous authentication, 
which means your device is constantly 
checking that whoever’s using it is still 
the owner. The only big example so far 
is the iPhone X, which scans your face 
to unlock itself, and scans again before 
it does anything like autofill your card 
details into websites. The Apple Watch 
has a basic version of this: you unlock 
it, and it stays unlocked only if it 
detects your heartbeat uninterrupted.
There’s an interesting continuous 
authentication option for the desktop 
too, aimed at businesses. TypingDNA 
uses machine learning to analyse your 
typing style, and if it suddenly changes 
(because someone else is using your 
computer, with a different typing 
pattern) it can lock, or send an alert. 
Google has shown something similar 
for Android in the past, combining 
typing, face recognition and location, 
so between that and better face 
detection coming to phones, expect 
smarter security in the future.

nikon aF-S 70-200MM 
F/2.8e Fl eD Vr
Lenses like this are the 
workhorses of pro photographers, but 
let’s unpack the name. AF-S means a 
silent autofocus motor. 70-200mm is 
the zoom range, in this case short to 
medium telephoto settings perfect for 
portraits and animals that aren’t too far 
away. The constant maximum aperture 
of f/2.8 will give you faster shutter 
speeds and shallow depth of field, 
while the E is an electromagnetic 
diaphragm. FL means some lens 
elements are made from fluorite rather 
than glass, to reduce coloured fringing 
known as chromatic aberration and ED 
indicates extra-low dispersion glass for 
the same reason. VR is for Vibration 
Reduction, Nikon’s image stabilisation 
solution, which helps combat camera 
shake and keeps your images sharp.

nikon D850
A good camera body is 
essential, and this is currently 
the daddy. Its full frame, 45-megapixel, 
backside-illuminated sensor is the first 
to score 100 points from camera-rating 
lab DxOMark, and it can blast away at 
seven frames per second – or nine with 
an optional battery grip. 153 autofocus 
points help keep things sharp, and  
the D850 can also shoot 4K video.

nikon 50MM  
F1.4G aF-S
Known as a ‘normal’ lens 
because it gives a field of view similar 
to that of the human eye, the 50mm 
focal length is the same as the 
measurement across the diagonal of  
a 35mm film frame, and therefore also 
the sensor in our D850. The enormous 
maximum aperture of f/1.4 gobbles  
up light and melts backgrounds into  
a smooth bokeh, making it the perfect 
tool for dreamy portraits.

Surprisingly, jeans are the wardrobe staple that many of 
us get wrong. An unsightly gap between your shoe and 
ankle, a gathering of material at the front or sagging at 
the back… These are all signs of ill-fitting jeans, but this 
doesn’t have to be your denim fate. Hannah Dalzell, stylist 
for The Chapar (thechapar.com), a leading men’s online 
personal shopping service, knows that finding killer jeans 
is easier than you think. And it starts with colour and fit…
“Every man should own a pair of well-fitted indigo 
jeans,” says Hannah. “Don’t be afraid to try slim fit – it 
doesn’t have to be skin-tight, but baggy denim is over. 
One of the most popular cuts is tapered fit. This follows 
the shape of the leg, offering more room around the 
thigh which slims in from the knee, down to the ankle.”
As for ‘wash’, Hannah advises choosing one that works 
with your age and personality. “Favourites at The Chapar 
include Levis 511’s in Rock Cod, Scotch and Soda’s Ralston 
jeans, and 7 For All Mankind Slimmy Slim.”
For those suffering from plumber’s inch, it’s time to 
sort your rise out. “Rise is the difference between the 
middle crotch seam to the top of the waistband,” Hannah 
tells us. “High-rise jeans are better if you want to tuck 
your shirt in, and for eliminating builder’s bum.”

Auto 
the car of the future
Renault’s SYMBIOZ concept car is a vision of the self-driving car the 
company thinks we’ll be buying in five years – and we’ve tried it
Most self-driving cars being tested are just 
normal cars with motors and sensors bolted 
on. With the SYMBIOZ concept car, Renault 
is doing it differently, building the sensors 
inside the body, and thinking about what 
the interior experience of a self-driving car 
should be. It’s the whole package.
The SYMBIOZ is a ‘Level 4’ self-driving 
car, meaning the driver can ignore the road 
and do something else, but only on certain 
roads – in this case, highways. So we headed 
to the highway, activated its autonomous 
mode… and put on a VR headset.
While the car cruised down a real, open 
highway at 110kph, weaving through traffic, 
we watched a VR experience specially made 
for the car by Ubisoft, matching the car’s 
speed or acceleration in-game, meaning 
there were no motion sickness issues.
It’s amazing how quickly it feels normal to 
see the driver kicking back. (The seats can 
recline heavily, for true relaxation.) That’s 
partly because Renault makes sure you trust 
the car, showing the vehicles it’s detected 
around it on three 12-inch OLED dash 
screens, and providing a HUD for the driver 
that shows when the car plans to change 
lanes. But it’s also partly because it works 
well enough that you stop worrying. This 
is way beyond cruise control or even 
Tesla’s Autopilot, and we love the idea of 
motorways becoming free time. Bring it on.

Award-winning travel writer Victoria Philpott reveals  
her top picks for UK spa stays
Valentine’s Day is nearly here, and if you 
want to impress your loved one this year, 
Leicestershire’s Ragdale Hall Health Hydro 
and Thermal Spa (ragdalehall.co.uk) is an 
excellent, luxurious bet. 
Housed in a sprawling Victorian manor 
house, the choice of treatments is incredible, 
from flotations to facials and reiki. There’s a 
candle pool, outdoor waterfall pool, volcanic 
salt bath, colourflow cave and, coming soon, 
an infinity rooftop pool from which to 
admire the comely countryside. A Cupid’s 
Couples Day package starts from £249 per 
couple, with other options available.  
In Surrey meanwhile, Pennyhill Park Hotel 
(from £580, exclusive.co.uk/the-spa) is just 
16 miles from Heathrow Airport. With eight 
indoor and outdoor pools, a golf course and 
an extensive treatment menu, including the 
caviar and pearl Gold Facial, it’s easy to relax 
into romance here. Wine and dine your 
loved one by booking into The Latymer, the 
hotel’s Michelin-starred restaurant.  
Further south, Watergate Bay (from £180, 
watergatebay.co.uk) is perched on the 
Cornish coast just outside of Newquay. Sit 
and watch the waves roll in from the huge 
windows of Zacry’s Restaurant before 
enjoying your luxury bedroom, a 25m pool, 
spa treatments and perhaps even the 
Extreme Academy, for bonding over 
adrenaline-fuelled beach sports.

BlazeWear explorer JackeT
The problem with clothes, unlike, say, 
buildings or vehicles, is that other than a few 
zips they have limited temperature control. 
When you’re heading into the mountains, 
environmental conditions can change 
swiftly and you can be caught out, which 
could be serious. Take note, then, of 
BlazeWear’s latest outerwear, designed to 
prepare you for the coldest of snaps.
The Explorer Jacket (from £200, 
blazewear.com) subtly integrates state-of-
the-art TriZone Heat tech for precise levels 
of warmth at the touch of a button. With 
three adjustable heat settings, in-coat 
temperatures can rise to a super-toasty 
55°C – on a freezing mountain, that will 
definitely come in handy. A rechargeable 
USB power bank (lithium-ion battery) 
generates up to 13 hours of uninterrupted 
heat, making it ideal for longer excursions 
where temperatures might worsen. That 
power bank can also be used to charge your 
smartphone in an emergency.
Because the waterproof Explorer Jacket 
is designed with Thermolite insulation tech, 
it’s respectably warm even without the 
additional heater, and its lightweight, 
high-performance wadding boasts excellent 
insulation, retention and heat distribution. 
But hey, who wouldn’t want the option of 
continuous, customisable heat when it’s on 
offer and ready to be switched on?

We’ve come a long way 
from the what-precisely-is-
this-drink stage of home 
brewing. (it was supposed to be 
wine, by the way, if you happened 
to taste the 1987 vintage 
GuruBrew.) one could argue, if 
pushing things just a little beyond 
the bounds of plausibility, the craft 
beer revolution is just an extension 
of homebrew, but with better kit.
so if beer’s your thing, you don’t 
want too much, and you have no 
interest in the lore of brewing, 
picoBrew has you covered with its 
pico C ($449, due for uk launch 
imminently). slap in a picopak from 
one of its affiliated craft people, 
give it a couple of hours and you’re 
ready to ferment over a couple of 
weeks. results should be drinkable, 
though you’ll question the expense 
compared to an eight-pack.
those doing it the proper way 
will need a laundry list of bottles, 
tubs, meshes and scientific 
doodads for measuring pressure 
and such. the heavily hyphenated 
the-home-brew-shop.co.uk should 
be able to sort you out with a 
starter kit for around £60. When 
you’re ready to upgrade, there’s  
a bunch of devices that connect  
to apps on your phone. the 
Brewnanny monitor (around £372, 
with limited availability) is probably 
the queen of such things, keeping 
an eye on the temperature, gas, 
gravity and even the light levels.  
When the yeast has feasted and 
the hops have, er, popped, serve  
it up right: grab a suitable draft kit 
(Beer hawk offers one for around 
£170), force some Co2 into your 
brew, and keep it away from the  
air until you’re ready to guzzle it.

if you’re still pedalling

much fitter than Guru, and we

For cycle fans of a less enthusiastic

you can absolutely get that raleigh

Guru could answer this 
question in his sleep, 
because he often has to: 
the throngs of gadget fans do not 
stop to examine GaGu’s face or 
listen to his snores before they  
start burbling their queries in his 
direction. so imagine ol’ Guru laid 
on his side, padding his hands  
and feet like a dog running in a 
dream and reciting the following  
in a slightly worried, unclear and 
groggy voice.
turn the brightness of the screen 
down. turn the volume of the 
speakers down. stop playing 
games, and turn off any pointless 
visual effects. switch from the 
discrete graphics cards to your 
motherboard’s integrated solution, 
if that’s an option. power down 
radios you’re not using. Make use of 
your Windows or macos power 
saving options‚ drag the slider on 
the battery meter to the left to use 
less power and conserve more 
battery. in the battery settings, 
change the level that’s regarded as 
‘critical battery’ to something a 
little lower. if you’re on a MacBook, 
install the latest updates and use 
the energy saver section of system 
preferences  to do the obvious 
things this menu does.
there are myths around laptop 
battery that have been perpetuated 
based on a mixture of outdated 
information and downright 
stupidity. don’t, for example, think 
that leaving your laptop plugged  
in is going to knacker its battery. 
nope! unless there’s something 
very wrong with your charging 
circuit, this is a perfectly safe thing 
to do. And don’t bother putting an 
older machine into the freezer to 
boost its life; there’s the possibility 
of a slight effect on your battery’s 
chemistry on a temporary basis, 
but nothing that’ll last, and the rest 
of the machine might suffer. 
definitely don’t poke holes in your 
batteries to let air into them, as this 
also lets the fire out. 
How can I make my laptop 
battery last longer?

What price freedom from infestation?  
A couple of hundred quid to the rat man, 
who chuckled at Guru’s rubbish electronic 
rodent repellers, put down a bunch of 
dehydrating (and, judging by the noise, 
absolutely delicious) bait, pointed out the 
massive hole in GaGu’s garage where the 
rats were getting in, and made friends with 
the family’s ineffective cats. 
By way of an apology to the 
felines after giving them the 
blame, Guru bought them  
a new gadget to ignore: the 
Frolicat Bolt (£26). it uses  
its motorised mirror to spang

family’s new collaborative to-do lists have. 
Clan Guru is using Wunderlist (free, with 
apps for phones, computers and just about 
every electronic thing except for blasted 
Alexa) in combination with the deadly 
organisational skills and cutting sass of 
Mrs Guru. every tiny thing is categorised, 
tagged, divided and fervently enforced. 
should Guru deign to ignore a to-do,  
a snippy ‘sort your life out’ entry ends  
up on his personal list. perfect for getting  
stuff done and bickering in equal measure.

Guru’s thrift for tech 
companies who refuse to 
get along is as short as his 
tolerance for insipid daytime tV. 
Alas, buy in to hue and you’re in the 
hue club, and so on and so forth 
unless you’re happy to battle with 
multiple apps and a bunch of 
confusion from your better half.
you could link everything into  
a whole with something like iFttt 
or stringify. But it probably won’t 
work properly. thank goodness, 
then, for smart tech marriage 
counsellor Zigbee, which has snuck 
its way into the new echo and 
pushed out a new standard for 
smart lights that Guru hopes leads 
to bulbs from multiple brands 
working together in the future.
What is the  
best translator?
Can I trust 
Chinese

Guru absolutely applauds 
the enthusiasm the tech 
market is showing for live 
translation, and though the Google 
pixel Buds (£159, plus the £579 
you’ll need to plunk down for a 
pixel 2) are surprisingly adept at 
doing low-lag babelfishing, they’re 
also so conspicuous that the only 
conversation you’re likely to have  
is about how stupid it all is. 
you may as well skip the 
investment. Go old-school with a 
little phrasebook, use a service like 
Memrise (memrise.com) to teach 
your brain how to actually speak 
that language. or delay your  
travel plans for a few years while 
Microsoft et al gets its own live 
translation engines ready.
a
Can you trust them to 
what? Work? probably, 
depending on how little 
you’ve spent on them. Be what 
you’ve supposedly paid for? 
depends on the shadiness of the 
retailer you’ve used, but fakes  
are a lot less prevalent now that 
brands such as oppo, huawei,  
Vivo and Xiaomi are creating  
a proper market there that’s  
heading strongly over here.
if you’re worried about them 
phoning home with all your 
precious info, Guru isn’t sure what 
to tell you. your current phone  
is probably chucking a load of 
‘telemetry’ data somewhere. it’s  
a miserable fact of electronic life.

Guru finds the finest 
media you need on 
your various screens

 
o you spend a lot of 
time worrying about 
how secure your tech is? 
Once, that would have 
meant ensuring your email account 
was protected by something really 
clever like ‘h0tmailpa55word’. 
Now, it means having strong 
passwords for all your online 
activity, your thermostat, your 
washing machine, your TV, your 
kids’ toys and your smart e-pants. 
You’ve got smart e-pants, right?
My password collection has long 
since proliferated past the point 
where I could ever remember them 
all. I’ve got half a dozen that I use 
quite a lot, so it usually takes me 
no more than six goes to log on to 
most things. But some sites require 
passwords so complex, no human 
mind could hope to remember 
them. There was also that period 
when I used to let Apple and 
Google generate passwords for me, 
which means I need to remember 
streams of ASCII vomit like 
‘duSi__o’;irl382%627ArrGh9efd’ if 
I want to log on to that site I once 
bought that birthday e-card for my 
mum on.
The idea with those kinds of 
passwords is that the operating 
system securely remembers it 
for you, but that seems to have 
stopped working somewhere along 
the line for me. Technology, eh?
Oops, sorry about that
The problem is that technology 
today is so endlessly complicated in 
the way it all interlinks that having 
(and remembering) strong 
passwords doesn’t make you safe 
anyway. I logged onto an unusually 
helpful public Wi-Fi the other day, 
and it said on its landing page, “This 
network is intrinsically unsafe; your 
data could be intercepted.” So of 
course, I just 
logged on 
anyway, 
because I had to 
see if anyone Liked 
my Facebook posts.
Now, of course, we have 
Spectre and Meltdown. You’ve 
heard of them, right? Even among 
a tech-savvy audience like T3’s, it 
wouldn’t surprise me if a few of you 
don’t know what they are. They’re 
not viruses or ransomware like 
WannaCry, which you may recall 
the North Koreans used to shut 
down the NHS for a weekend last 
year. They’re flaws within the  
chips found in every computer or 
mobile device of the last 20 years 
that could be used to take over 
your devices.
Yet it’s possible you might not 
know about these luridly named 
mega-bugs because they really 
But that’s 
how we deal with fears about 
online security really: ignore them 
until they go away, or the world 
ends. Whichever comes first.
I realised this around the time 
flaws were discovered in SSL, the 
thing that makes safe-looking 
padlocks appear in the corner of 
web browsers when browsing 
securely. Turned out it wasn’t 
secure at all. It was like moving into 
a house and having a magnificent 
front door installed and then, 10 
years later, discovering the lock was 
actually made of jelly. That worried 
me, being a big fuss-pot, but it 
soon became clear that nobody 
else gave a flying one. 
Something similar happened 
when PlayStation Network was 
hacked. People were furious! No, 
not because their credit card 
details might have been filched; 
because PSN had to shut for a few 
days, so they couldn’t game online. 
Clearly, this can’t be the right 
attitude to something so terrifying, 
but it perhaps is the best one, if we 
wish to avoid becoming paranoid 
wrecks. It’s like nuclear war – an 
atomic exchange would end the 
world and could happen, in theory, 
at any second. Buy hey! So far, 
there’s not been an atomic war. 
We’ll cross that bridge when we 
come to it, yeah?
I logged onto a helpful 
public Wi-Fi the other 
day that said “This 
network is unsafe” 
Duncan Bell is

Online security is a massive worry. The 
correct response is obvious: ignore it

that much, despite the chance they 
could bring about the end of society 
as we know it. Maybe when we’re all 
fighting for tinned food by hitting 
each other with ox thighbones, 
people will think, ‘Hmm, I kind of 
wish more prominence had been 
given to those intrinsic flaws in the 
security systems of everything, 
everywhere. Maybe then I wouldn’t 
be living in a cave and having to use 
Windows phone.’

The Euro road trip
fter a 10-year absence, F1 will return to 
France next summer when the French  
Grand Prix takes place at the Circuit Paul 
Ricard (which we tried out – see p84), near 
Marseille in Provence. And if Lewis Hamilton fancies a 
slightly less intense drive afterwards, we’ve got the 
ultimate road trip – the Route Napoleon. This spectacular 
journey links Golfe Juan and Grenoble, and winds 
through two of the country’s prettiest regions: Provence-
Alps-Côte d’Azur and Rhône-Alpes. It follows part of the 
324-kilometre route taken by Napoleon and his men in 
1815, when the exiled French statesman marched from 
Elba to Grenoble.
Equally spectacular (although in a castles, not 
coastline, sense) is the Romantische Strasse (Romantic 
Road), which passes through southern Germany. 
Highlights include the dramatic Neuschwanstein Castle 
(Disneyland’s version was based on this 19-century 
fortress) and the historic city of Würzburg, which is 
surrounded by vineyards. For the sheer diversity of the 
scenery, we recommend driving from Bucharest to 
Vienna. After leaving Romania’s capital, you will pass 
through the Carpathian Mountains (home to Bran 
Castle, said to be Count Dracula’s former digs) before 
joining the high-altitude Transfăgărășan highway, 
which Jeremy Clarkson once conquered for an episode of 
Top Gear. He later described it as “the best road in the 
world.” After passing though Budapest (spending the 
night here will allow you to visit its famous ‘ruin’ bars, 
built into abandoned buildings), you’ll press on to the 
finish line – the beautiful Austrian capital of Vienna. 
For something a little closer to home, head to the 
Atlantic Highway – the road which weaves its way from 
the UK’s deer-filled Exmoor National Park to Land’s 
End, the westernmost tip of Cornwall. The highway’s 
total length comes in at around 240 miles, but this 
spectacular route isn’t one to be rushed. The best bit? 
You’ll be driving through some of England’s prettiest 
villages, which means plenty of opportunities for 
cream tea fixes.

his March, Qantas will launch the first direct 
flight between Australia (Perth) and the UK, 
and the airline has suggested that direct flights 
between the UK and Sydney could start by 
2022, by which time there will be even more reasons to 
book a trip down under. Hotel-wise, we’re particularly 
excited about the W Brisbane, due to open this spring – it’s 
the luxury hotel brand’s first property in Australia. We’re 
also pretty certain that a large number of those making 
use of the UK to Sydney route will make a beeline for the 
recently opened Sofitel Sydney Darling Harbour. It’s the 
first new-build international luxury hotel to open in the 
city’s central business district this millennium.
For something totally different, head to Cambodia for 
a walk on the wild side. Last year saw the launch of the 
luxurious Cardamom Tented Camp, opening up one of 
Cambodia’s most remote areas: the Cardamom Mountains. 
This autumn will see the opening of Shinta Mani Wild, 
another tented camp in the same area. There’ll be luxury 
expedition boats, beautiful tented suites and an enormous 
spa, and guests will be able to join local rangers on 
wildlife-spotting hikes. 
Over in Zambia, one of the world’s most popular safari 
spots has also had a makeover. Zambia’s Lower Zambezi 
National Park is now the world’s only carbon-neutral 
national park. But that doesn’t mean cold showers and no 
electricity, because the park’s got several opulent camps, 
including the Royal Zambezi Lodge, where the 15 canvas 
tents come with armchairs, the finest down pillows and 
private verandas. Splash out on one of the Presidential 
Suites, and you’ll get a private plunge pool and separate 
lounge area. In the beautiful bathroom, the copper bath is 
positioned to allow you to spot the big five while you soak.
 To really get away from it all, head to Kafue National 
Park. It’s Zambia’s largest, with a wide range of 
accommodation. Our favourite camp is the KaingU 
Safari Lodge, where you can choose between tented chalets 
or rooms in the beautiful main house.

he Thai islands are officially full. Although 
neighbouring countries are trying to recreate 
similar idylls, it’s easier said than done. On the 
Vietnamese island of Phu Quoc, for example, 
overdevelopment has produced a rash of gaudy hotels and 
casinos. Our advice? Visit Cambodia’s coast. Although the 
seaside city of Sihanoukville is popular with backpackers, 
those in the know are heading east to the coastal province 
of Kep, where a number of beautiful boutique hotels are 
popping up. We’re smitten with Knai Bang Chatt, a beach 
hotel with its own sailing club. Elsewhere in Cambodia, the 
opening of Alila Villas Koh Russey is generating huge buzz, 
as is the launch of the all-villa Six Senses Koh Krabey, a 
short boat ride from Sihanoukville.
Closer to home, Montenegro is shaping up to 
be the next big beach destination. The country’s 
coastline shares the same expanse of ocean as Greece, Italy 
and Croatia, and one of its finest beach resorts, Bečići, is an 
hour’s drive from its capital, Podgorica. Industry experts 
are also predicting that Turkey will make a comeback in 
2018, with İzmir province the place to be. Our favourite 
locations include the resort town of Çeşme, and Foça, a 
quaint beach town. May 2018 will see the return of tour 
operator Mark Warner to Turkey, and the company chose 
this area as the site of its new property, which will open 
from May until October. Phokaia Beach Resort will have 
an enormous water sports centre and a wide range of 
activities, including yoga, cycling, hiking and tennis.

The serene spectacle
ometimes, the post-Christmas fallout leaves 
you wanting to get as far away from people as 
possible. If that’s you, forget the fairy lights 
and focus on the Northern Lights with a trip 
to Lapland – but don’t worry, you won’t find annoyingly 
perky elves or ruddy-cheeked Santas at the particular 
destination we’re recommending. At the Kakslauttanen 
Arctic Resort in Finnish Lapland, you can spend the night 
in a cosy glass igloo, allowing you to admire the Northern 
Lights without stepping outside. 
We’re also huge fans of Sweden’s Icehotel, which 
became a permanent fixture in 2016. This year’s version 
will have 35 suites, an ice bar and an ice ceremony hall, 
and you’ll be able to sign up for Northern Lights 
snowmobile tours and arctic yoga lessons. Although a 
word of warning – a visit to the Icehotel might sound 
rather romantic, but it’s not. You’ll snooze inside a 
double-layered sleeping bag, and will be warned against 
showering before bed to avoid adverse reactions to the 
sudden drop in temperature. And if you decide you’re not 
cut out for sub-zero slumber, don’t panic, because all 
guests get a ‘warm room’ in the adjoining hotel as a 
backup option. Survive the night, and you’ll be woken by a 
member of staff dispensing tumblers of warm lingonberry 
juice from a special dispenser. 
If you love the mountains but don’t fancy sleeping  
on a block of ice, head to the beautiful Fairmont Banff 
Springs in Banff National Park. This castle-like hotel 
is one of Canada’s largest, and its location, perched on 
the edge of a forested lake, means there are plenty of 
opportunities for long winter walks. When it’s time to 
dine, you can choose between 12 restaurants, although our 
favourite is the cosy Rundle Lounge, with its spectacular 
views of the mountains.

018 will be a big year for rugby, with the 
Rugby World Cup Sevens taking place in San 
Francisco. In 2019, Japan will host the Rugby 
World Cup. But you don’t have to know the 
difference between a fly half and a flanker to enjoy one of 
England’s most underrated attractions – The Webb Ellis 
Rugby Football Museum in Rugby, near Coventry, just 
named UK City of Culture 2021. The museum is tucked 
inside the building once owned by shoemaker James 
Gilbert, who produced the first rugby balls in 1842. They’re 
still made here today, making it the building with the 
longest continuous association with rugby in the world.
Craving a weekend away? We’ve got the perfect spot: the 
Grade II-listed Wireless Cottage in Cornwall. This one-
bedroom cliff-top cabin was built in 1900 by engineer 
Guglielmo Marconi, who wanted somewhere secluded to 
carry out his wireless communication experiments. He 
chose well, because the property’s just a short walk from 
Lizard Point, the most southerly spot in the UK.
Short on time but keen to take a break from people? 
Spend a night or two at No Man’s Fort in the Solent, which 
was constructed over 150 years ago. You can either rent one 
of the 22 rooms or get together with friends and hire the 
entire place. And there’s plenty to do, too: you can sign up 
for rum-tasting or cocktail-making lessons, challenge 
your friends to a game of laser tag or learn how to slice the 
top off a bottle of champagne during a sabrage lesson – an 
essential life skill, we’re sure you’ll agree.

The culture weekend
ulture vultures are flocking to Poland, and the 
capital, Warsaw, will soon hold even more 
appeal, because March will see the opening of 
the five-star Raffles Europejski. Raffles’ newest 
property will open in the cobbled historic district, next to 
the Presidential Palace. Nearby attractions include the 
Historical Museum of Warsaw and the Adam Mickiewicz 
Museum of Literature, a tribute to Poland’s greatest writer. 
For an additional culture fix, head over the border to 
the German city of Hamburg, officially known as the Free 
and Hanseatic City of Hamburg (try saying that with a 
mouthful of bratwurst). Its name reflects its historical 
importance to the Hanseatic League, founded in the 
14th century by north German towns and merchant 
communities abroad to protect their trading interests. 
Learn more about Germany’s biggest port with a visit to 
the Museum of Hamburg History, before getting a different 
perspective on its transformation with a visit to HafenCity, 
a trendy new harbour side area that is home to the 
Elbphilharmonie Hamburg concert hall, one of the largest 
and most acoustically advanced music venues in the world.
And then there’s Turin, which became even more 
accessible in November when British Airways launched its 
twice-weekly flights from Heathrow. The city is most 
famous for the Turin Shroud, although the relic rarely goes 
on show. Must-sees include the Santuario della Consolata 
– a gold-covered explosion of baroque extravagance – and 
the Mole Antonelliana. When the latter was originally 
built as a synagogue in the 1880s, it was the world’s tallest 
building, and it’s still one of the tallest brick structures in 
Europe. Today, it houses a museum of cinema. The best bit? 
If energy levels dip, it’s now even easier to refuel. Until the 
end of 2018 you’ll be able to pick up a limited edition Torino 
Coffee Card. Created to celebrate the city’s longstanding 
relationship with coffee, it entitles the owner to five coffees 
at a number of Turin’s historical cafés.

Ikea Trådfri
How Hot?
There are two kinds of white bulbs in 
the Trådfri line: a straight dimmable 
variety, and one that lets you 
embrace the entire white spectrum. 
With the latter, you can switch the 
temperature of your lighting from 
a cold white, perfect for working, 
to a warm white, the best option 
for relaxing in the evening. Tie the 
temperature change to a timer 
via the app, and you can go from 
focused to flopping, automatically.

February 2018 T3 55
The Setup
Perfect Panels
Three more items in the Ikea 
catalogue are compatible with 
the Trådfri system – the Surte 
and Jormlien LED door panels 
(£70/£100), which attach to a host 
of Ikea cabinets for a brighter feel 
to your kitchen; and the Floalt LED 
panel (from £50), a less useful but 
still cool oblong that projects a 
diffuse light into your room. Like 
the bulbs, you can add these items 
in later, and group them to control 
whole rooms at once.
IllumInate your 
home wIth the 
swedIsh gIant’s 
smart-bulb system
There’s a wide selection of bulbs 
and control options on offer
Ikea’s ubiquitous reputation as a dIy furniture 
manufacturer has been almost matched, at 
least in recent years, by its nous as a lighting 
supplier. The firm’s low-cost bulbs have 
converted many homes from compact 
fluorescent to longer-lasting LED. Now the 
Swedish giant has taken the next step, entering 
the world of smart lighting. 
There’s a wide-ranging selection under its 
Trådfri banner – individual dimmers, bulbs of 
different sizes and regions of the white light 
spectrum, sensors, and smart lighting panels 
for your furniture – as well as 10-bulb remote 
controls and, naturally, a router bridge to 
control the lot via a mobile phone app. And 
while we’re showing you how to set up the 
basic gateway kit (£65, including two E27 
bulbs, the gateway and a remote) it’s worth 
pointing out that the most recent firmware 
makes trådfri bulbs Zigbee-compatible; if you 
already have a Hue setup and you’re looking to 
expand, Trådfri bulbs (which include recently 
released RGB varieties, although these can’t 
be bought online outside of a £35 kit) are an 
inexpensive choice.
It’s true that other rival lighting systems are 
not much more expensive when getting a full 
bulbs-and-gateway pack, and may have more 
options – while Ikea’s system is pretty 
expansive, there are no flood bulbs, and there’s 
no bayonet-fitting option without a £1 adapter 
– but the individual bulb price is excellent for 
doing a whole house, and they work really well. 
Ikea’s app isn’t the absolute best, compared 
with its seasoned competitors, but it does 
work with other smart home control systems.  
Ikea’s handy twistable dimmers (or ‘steering 
devices’), which can be tied to individual bulbs 
by holding them near, are a more handsome 
and intuitive solution than Philips’ rather ugly 
four-button remote. and you can get started 
with smart lighting without investing in a hub: 
a mere £15 gets you started with a simple bulb 
and dimmer combo, which you can expand 
when you’re ready. The other advantage is the 
super-easy setup process for Trådfri: you 
could be up and running in 15 minutes – and 
that includes the time it takes to screw ’em in.

01
DoWnLoAD TråDFrI
Head to your device’s app 
store and install the free 
trådfri app. once it’s installed, 
open it up, agree to the terms 
and conditions, click the ‘Let’s 
get started’ button, and plug 
in the hardware. Twist the top 
of the gateway to open it, plug 
the ethernet cable into your 
router and the USB power 
cable into the gateway.
02
Sync up
Tap ‘Next’ and, in theory, the 
app will detect your newly 
plugged-in gateway. If it 
doesn’t, log in to your router 
and find out its address – look 
for ‘TRADFRI-Gateway’ or 
‘GW’ followed by a bunch of 
unintelligible characters. then 
simply scan the code on the 
back of the gateway to link 
everything up together.
03
ADD DEvIcES
Now link the remote control to 
your Trådfri network. Tap the 
appropriate button in the app. 
tap the button inside the back 
of the remote four times to 
reset it, then hold that button 
down for 10 seconds while the 
remote is next to the gateway 
to tie them together. the 
process is much the same for 
bulbs and other trådfri kit.
04
group ’Em
all lights are added to a single 
group by default. unless 
they’re only in one room, you’ll 
probably want to change this; 
tap the cog, then ‘Manage 
your devices’, and use the plus 
button to add a new group. 
A remote control can only be 
bound to one group at a time, 
so you’ll need a second (or a 
dimmer) for a second room.
05
mAkE A mooD
on the main screen, you’ll see 
a coloured circle above each 
group – this is its current 
mood, the equivalent of Hue’s 
scenes. you can change the 
intensity of the light by 
dragging the slider, but tap 
that circle and the ‘New mood’ 
button, and you can set a 
custom temperature and light 
level for that group.
06
WAkE up rIghT
use the time icon in the 
top-left of the main screen to 
set up timed routines. there 
are a few built-in, including 
a handy ‘rise and shine’ mode 
that will start raising your 
selected lights gradually to 
help you wake up refreshed – 
and you can be specific, pulling 
up a bedside lamp rather than 
a whole group if you wish.
“In our increasingly 
sleep deprived, lights-
on lifestyles, this 
smart bulb setup could 
help create a more restful pre-bed 
experience and a more refreshed 
post-sleep one. It’s clever, 
inexpensive and user-friendly.”

Panasonic’s Google 
Assistant-equipped 
smart speaker is 
designed to produce  
hi-fi sound
We’re now awash with AI-equipped 
speakers, but Panasonic is hoping to stand 
out from the noisy crowd with its new 
connected home buddy, the SC-GA10, 
arriving in early 2018. Much like the 
forthcoming Apple HomePod, Panasonic 
is making its smart speaker a music-first 
affair, designing it to produce hi-fi quality 
sound – as well as being able to handle 
your voice commands courtesy of a 
built-in Google Assistant.
The SC-GA10 looks a damn sight 
better than many other smart speakers, 
with a hybrid texture body combining 
polished aluminium and fine fabric mesh 
(available in Black and White). Google 
Home users will appreciate the touch-
sensitive top, but the SC-GA10 features a 
much fuller suite of control buttons 
compared to Google’s minimalist selection.
While Apple’s talked loudly about the 
HomePod’s plethora of beamforming 
tweeters, Panasonic has seen fit to pack 
the SC-GA10 with two soft-domed 
tweeters, each with a silk diffuser, for a 
180-degree arc of sound. An 8cm woofer 
with twin voice coils handles bass duties, 
creating an extremely enticing setup. 
The SC-GA10 is capable of performing 
web searches, setting alarms, making 
to-do lists and controlling compatible 
connected home devices, too. Because it’s 
equipped with Google Assistant, it’ll play 
with any Chromecast audio device on the 
same network, so you could include it in a 
multi-room setup if you desire. You can 
even pair two SC-GA1Os together for a 
stereo approach.

Yale Smart living  
Door/WinDoW ContaCt
£20, yale.co.uk
as part of yale’s Smart Living alarm system, this coin-cell 
powered sensor is far from the cheapest way to monitor your 
doors – a starter pack containing a PIr detector, remote 
control and yale’s 20 device siren/hub combo costs about 
£450. It is, at least, simple to set up: there’s a learn button on 
the front. Pairing one up with the rest of the Smart alarm 
network, including naming and zoning via the smartphone app, 
is quick and easy. That app itself is functional, but also pretty 
ugly. yale kit is not, as far as we can determine, compatible with 
other smart hubs or services, so while using the system is 
subscription free, you’re tied to yale’s servers to get anything 
done beyond local arming and disarming. Still, it’s quick to alert 
you of door incursions via push message and email.
energenie mi|Home open SenSor
£28, energenie4u.co.uk
energenie’s prime goal is, as the name suggests, saving energy. 
This means its door and sensor isn’t necessarily a security tool, 
although Energenie’s clean app can be configured to send push 
notifications of activations and deactivations: take the battery 
out, and the app won’t know it’s been disabled. The aaa-
powered Open Sensor is more about being clever with your 
home, and keeping tabs on your door and window openings. It’s 
not super-smart – the required gateway (£70) can cosy up with 
Nest or energenie’s own Home Smart Thermostat, but not link 
your activities to anything particularly clever. you can, though, 
get much more complex with IFTTT integration. Installation is 
slick, mounting the components is easy enough (although there 
are no screw holes on the main component), and the Open 
Sensor manages some impressive range from the gateway.
t3 SaYS A clever security sensor that is simple to set up 
and acts fast, but requires a big investment in both cash 
and ecosystem to get started.

Hive WinDoW or Door SenSor
£29, hive.co.uk
arguably the most attractive device pair here, it’s amazing 
what a little frosted sticker and a second design iteration can 
do – the Hive sensor requires that you buy at least a Hive Hub 
(£80) to use it. Once you do, you get access to an accomplished 
app offering push updates on the status of your house’s 
openings, statistics on sensor activation over time, and a mild 
amount of integration with your Hive kit. Disappointingly, 
unlike its competitor from energenie, the door sensors (which 
make the unusual Cr123 battery good for around three years 
of life) aren’t on Hive’s limited list of IFTTT integrations. This 
means you can’t use them for anything beyond keeping tabs on 
your own internal machinations. They work fine in the Hive 
loop, triggering fast and reliably with excellent range, but their 
limited practical application is a little disappointing.
elgato eve Door & WinDoW
£35, elgato.com
elgato’s relatively expensive bluetooth-powered, HomeKit-
enabled sensor is the only one on test here that doesn’t 
explicitly need an additional hub – any iOS device will do the 
trick, as long as you’re in bluetooth range – but it does, on the 
flip side, require you to be checked into the Apple ecosystem to 
use it. It’s utterly elegant, with a tiny magnet, a squat sensor 
unit designed to fit a half-AA battery, and spacers included to 
make sure the contact is always sound. The most recent 
firmware update sends alerts on opening and closing, and if 
you’ve got an apple TV set up as a home hub, you can have 
them broadcast to your phone from afar. If anything, though, 
the eve sensor is much more useful as an enabler for your 
wildest dreams of smart home automation, particularly if you’re 
already invested in HomeKit compatible gear. 
t3 SaYS An easy addition to an existing Hive setup, 
great for monitoring the status of your doors, but not 
particularly useful beyond that.

Apple user, Elgato’s handsome sensor is incredibly 
versatile when combined with HomeKit automation.
 
 
 
 
 
Verdict
Verdict
MounT IT rIgHT
getting the correct positioning on both 
vertical and horizontal axes is essential. 
If your sensor includes spacers to raise or 
lower the magnet portion, use them, and 
test the accuracy of your mounting using 
the LED indicator on the sensor.
KEEP IT HIgH
Most sensors mount using a sticky pad. 
While this is usually fine, keep it away 
from any potential knocks. Placing a 
sensor on a door at foot height is asking 
for it to be kicked off, so mount your 
sensors near the top of any frames.
cHEcK THE bATTErIEs
Make the rounds yearly, replacing the 
batteries on your sensors to keep them 
fresh, and avoid false alarms. some 
sensors, like those from Elgato and Hive, 
use obscure cells that you probably won’t 
have, so stock up and be prepared.

You’re not the first person to feel 
misunderstood by alexa. while 
amazon’s Echo Plus is an impressive 
smart speaker, it isn’t foolproof, so you will 
run into occasional problems. when you 
say your Echo Plus is ignoring you, do you 
mean alexa doesn’t respond at all or that 
she does, but not in the way you want? If 
it’s the former, make sure your Echo Plus 
is connected to wi-Fi. If it isn’t, it won’t 
work properly – it can’t answer questions, 
process requests or stream media.
Placement is a factor in how well the 
speaker performs. amazon recommends 
placing the Echo Plus eight inches away 
from walls or other objects that may 
cause interference, such as baby 
monitors or microwaves. It isn’t a good 
idea to crowd your Echo Plus with 
knick-knacks and other tech, either, nor 
to leave it on the floor. alexa may also 
have trouble hearing you if your Echo 
Plus is placed next to a noisy air 
conditioner or dehumidifier.
Getting specific will also help alexa 
understand more clearly what you want 
her to do – via the alexa app, check to 
see what she heard compared to what 
you actually said. to help alexa become 
more accustomed to your voice, use the 
app’s Voice training feature, during which 
you’ll read aloud 25 phrases aloud in a 
‘typical voice from a typical distance’ so 
that alexa can better understand you.

Not every room or space in your home needs to be 
constantly heated, further hiking up your energy bills. 
Portable motion sensor heaters are handy for warming 
up conservatories, dining rooms, spare bedrooms, utility 
rooms and outside work spaces, and will only turn on 
when you walk into that room, pumping out instant 
heat, then switch off when you leave. These standalone 
motion sensor heaters are available from brands 
including Honeywell, with its Digital Ceramic Tower 
Heater, and Meaco, which recently launched a new 
range called MeacoHeat Motion. There are two models 
available: a smaller 1.8kW heater (£79.99) designed 
with two output levels to save energy, plus a one-to-
seven hour timer and fan-only mode for summer; and a 
larger 2.0kW heater (£99.99) with added oscillation to 
distribute heat across a 60-degree arc. 
Q
floorplanner and room designer app 
enables you to digitally build and decorate 
rooms using furniture, flooring and wall 
colours from real brands. Begin by 
choosing your room shape, such as 
rectangular or l-shape, or create a 
custom floor plan. From there you can set 
the dimensions and decorate your space, 
exploring colour combinations and 
flooring materials, and dropping furniture 
from amikasa’s catalogue into your digital 
room to see how it would look in real life. 
If apps don’t have the exact piece of 
furniture you’re interested in, choosing 
the closest alternative, in terms of size 
and colour, can still help you plan your 
home redesign.

Doing complex smart home automation 
stuff with Amazon’s Alexa service has,  
for a long time, relied on external services 
such as IFTTT and Stringify. That, 
however, has all changed. A recent update 
to the Alexa app introduces the concept  
of routines to the Alexa ecosystem. Using 
routines, you can attach a string of actions 
to a voice command, and get multiple 
things done with your Alexa-compatible 
kit, all via a simple holler at your Echo. 
Make sure you’ve got the latest  
version of the Amazon Alexa app on your 
smartphone by heading to either the App 
Store or Play Store and updating. Then 
open it up, hit the three-line hamburger 
icon, select the ‘Routines’ menu, and hit 
the blue plus button to find the goods.  
You can select either a scheduled time  
or any voice trigger you like – it makes 
sense to use something appropriate to  
the actions you want to perform, but 
“purple monkey dishwasher”, we can  
attest, works just as well.
The list of actions currently available, 
beyond those that interact with your 
Alexa-compatible smart devices, isn’t 
outrageously long at this early stage.  
You can’t yet, for example, trigger 
third-party skills or put on music, but 
news, traffic and weather reports are in, 
perfect for setting up your custom loadout 
for the beginning or end of the day. 
Set up a routine with the trigger,  
“Alexa, let’s get ready,” and you could have 
it shut off the smart plugs connected to 
the devices you won’t be using during  
the day, drop the lights house-wide, and  
let you know what the traffic and weather 
are up to. The inverse, “Alexa, I’m home,” 
might set your Echo to greet you, read  
you the news, and bring up your preferred 
evening lighting.

ime to start seeing things 
differently. The rise of 4K screen 
tech has been impossible to miss, 
but it’s too good to leave in the 
corner of the lounge. transplanted into the 
smaller screen size of laptop panels, 4K means 
a whole new visual experience. But it’s taken 
its time turning up. 4K laptops aren’t yet the 
norm, so if you’re looking for resolution 
today, look towards the high end. 
This isn’t a case of 4K screens being scarce. 
Indeed, factory upgrades mean 4K panels of 
T
all shapes and sizes are now abundant. The 
sluggish takeup of 4K in laptops is more of 
a power issue: driving a 4K screen properly 
needs strong processing power. You might 
expect to run games at full resolution, and 
end up sorely disappointed when your shiny 
new laptop can’t keep up with the pace – and 
4K means a very real hit to battery life. And, 
realistically, 4K’s visual upgrades can be hard 
to discern, and add a slight price premium. 
When it comes to laptops for the masses, 
Full HD will often do.
For the tech cognoscenti, though, the 
drawbacks don’t outweigh the benefits. 
The visual clarity of a 4K screen in computer 
use can’t be beat. Text is smoother, images 
are sharper, and there’s more logical (if not 
physical) room for multiple windows and 
applications. Photo editing and video editing 
at full resolution is an absolute joy, and if 
you’re shooting in 4K it makes no sense to 
downscale the fruits of your labour. Plus, the 
fact that 4K is the premium option means it’s 
attached to premium hardware…

efore we tackle the big boys, let’s 
single out the little gem: the 
incredibly slight Spectre is a 
design and engineering marvel. 
Retaining the super-slimline form of earlier 
iterations, it’s about the same size as an A4 
magazine, both in thickness and in edge-to-
edge dimensions. It’s flat and clean, making a 
statement not with bright bling, but by being 
calm, cool, focused and really small.
The Spectre’s screen hinges up over a bump 
at the rear, revealing a keyboard that, despite 
the base being only slightly thicker than the 
screen itself, has a decent amount of travel 
and a comfortable feel. There are certainly 
compromises here – notably the fact that 
you’ll need a dongle to expand beyond the 
Spectre’s three on-board USB-C ports – but 
we’re inclined to forgive them. 
The Razer Blade Pro is very different. It’s 
massive, incorporating a 17-inch panel, and 
forgoes slender electronics in favour of big, 
aggressive components and the cooling they 
require – truly the other side of the premium 
The incredibly slight 
Spectre is a design and 
engineering marvel
Just about the most luxurious laptop package you’re 
likely to find, awkward ports and all. We’re not sure  
how so much was packed into such little space
coin. Not that it’s immensely thick, though. 
Everything’s packed into a 22mm aluminium 
shell that weighs in at a shoulder-wrenching 
3.54kg. The extra width afforded by that 
screen means the Blade Pro’s trackpad has 
been moved, unusually, to the right edge of 
the keyboard to make it gamer-friendly (for 
right-handers, at least), and everything’s 
infused with Razer’s Chroma RGB lighting. 
The keyboard has its own distinct flair, using 
low-profile mechanical switches for a tactile, 
noisy click that feels very desktop.
MSI’s GS73VR isn’t unreasonable in its 
specifications, but it’s no performance slouch 
despite sporting a slimmer profile than the 
Blade Pro. Made of cool brushed aluminium 
alloy, it’s a lot lighter than its 17-inch rival, 
coming in at 2.4kg, although its design is 
arguably less appealing, and aluminium’s 
lightness has a trade-off in terms of strength. 
The deep-travel SteelSeries-made keyboard, 
feels great, although we could do without the 
every-letter-looks-identical gamer font.

The insane power of the Razer Blade Pro 
means it’s a bulky beast, but gaming 
machines are currently in the midst of 
a size revolution. Nvidia’s Max-Q tech 
(a name co-opted from NASA, where 
it refers to the point at which the 
aerodynamic stress on a rocket in the 
atmosphere hits its peak) shrinks the 
company’s Pascal graphics technology 
down to three times thinner than before 
and, when used in properly engineered 
systems, it can even run quieter and cooler.
You can get Max-Q laptops right now –  
the £2,799 Asus ROG Zephyrus being the 
most prominent – but expect the increase 
in GPU-hungry 4K screens and an eventual 
price drop to take the technology more 
mainstream before too long.

s you might expect given their 4K 
specs, it’s fair to say that none of 
these machines disappoints in 
the visual department. The 
Spectre, with its smaller screen, naturally 
has the greater pixel density, although 4K 
crushed down to ultraportable laptop size 
means you’re going to need to press your face 
pretty close to any of these panels to discern 
the existence of a pixel. HP’s screen also 
impresses with its response times – if 
anything, they’re slightly better than Razer’s 
efforts. MSI’s panel – the only one here that’s 
not touch-sensitive – is a little disappointing 
in terms of colour consistency at different 
viewing angles, although it’s still bright and 
rich, with a highly appealing colour range. 
The Blade Pro, calibrated and configured for 
gaming, has extremely wide viewing angles, 
awesome blacks, and a range that appeals 
while never becoming overblown.
Although the Spectre is not made for 
gaming – and that’s not something you 
should really attempt with it, given its

integrated graphics and moderate RAM – 
it’s a firecracker of a performer, packing the

is a tremendous performer in its own right, 
capable of grinding out VR with its GtX 1060 
graphics solution, and carrying enough 
extraneous RAM, storage and gaming 
gimmickry to carry you forward for a 
good couple of years.
In the end, though, there could only be 
one winner of this test. The Blade Pro 4K is 
an astonishing machine, which goes some 
way to explaining its astonishing price. It’s 
the term ‘dream machine’ made silicon flesh, 
a no-holds-barred exploration of what’s 
possible in portable hardware. Everything 
has been turned up to 11, from the best-in-

The Razer Blade Pro is most at home on the desktop. Carry it around too 
much and you’ll rip the straps off your bag
State of the Art
72 T3 February 2018
e’ve enjoyed having all three of 
these machines for an extended 
period, and loved them all for 
their own reasons. But here’s the 
bad news: nothing here has particularly 
fantastic battery life. Under our desktop tests, 
we found the Spectre the most disappointing. 
Presumably its compact case doesn’t leave a 
lot of room for battery cells, leaving it to 
top out around 2 hours 15 minutes despite 
running a more subtle component 
combination and smaller screen. The Razer 
Blade Pro, probably by virtue of a battery 
that makes up much of its weight, somehow 
manages 30 minutes longer on a much higher 
spec – far more than we’d expect from a 
desktop replacement. MSI’s paltry hour and 
a half is much closer to the mark. 
It’s also worth pointing out the noise issue. 
The Blade Pro is meant primarily as a desktop 
replacement, so it’s a little embarrassing 
to use away from the desk, due to its 
cacophonous cooling solution. There’s good 
reason for this – desktop-class components 
tend to get rather hot when taxed – but it’s 
louder than we’d like. The GS73VR, similarly, 
fires out a fair blast of air when even slightly

troubled, spitting it out of a front-mounted 
vent. Both 17-inch models are unwieldy; 
neither feels at home on a lap. But they never 
stumble, and each offers far more in terms of 
options, and a much more expansive screen, 
than the dinky Spectre.
The question, really, is what your day-to-
day routine looks like. If you’re moving 
around and meeting, or even just crashing on 
the sofa, the Spectre does more than enough. 
It’s hyper-portable, it’s slick and quick, and 
it really makes an impression. If you’re more 
tethered to a desk and getting your game on, 
the Blade Pro is a serious machine at a serious 
price – one that we’d rarely even consider 
moving. It may rip out a step more VR or 4K 
gaming performance than the GS73VR, but 
that extra kilo (and the fact that you could 
buy both the MSI and HP machines for the 
same price as the Razer) makes a difference.

Given the world’s increasing reliance on 
high-power, high-capacity batteries, there’s 
a whole host of tech in the works that 
could change the way your laptop charges 
in the future. Aluminium-graphite cells, for 
example, only hold about half the capacity 
of a lithium-ion unit, but can charge to full 
power in a minute or so. Scientists are also 
working on sodium-ion batteries, which 
could replace our reliance on lithium mining 
with simple salt.
there’s a lot of refinement to be done: 
one of the biggest issues blocking new 
better technologies from going mainstream 
is durability, with most alternative batteries 
lasting only a couple of thousand charge 
cycles. But never doubt that there are big 
changes on the horizon.

the fine pixel density of a 4K

handy, and wipe your screen 
regularly with alcohol wipes.

Each of these machines has an 
enormously bright display – 
brighter, by all rights, than it 
needs to be. Dropping the 
brightness to 50% or so will 
extend the life of your screen, 
save your eyes, and make your 
overworked battery last just 
that little bit longer.

Interview
78 T3 February 2018
nterviewing tech company 
executives is something of a 
double-edged sword. On the 
one hand, you can expect them 
to be right on message with the company 
line. On the other, you can expect some 
insights that those further down the chain 
would feel beyond their station.
And so when I was invited to meet Phil 
Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of 
worldwide marketing, I went to the London 
apartment where our meeting was due to 
take place with some excitement about our 
discussion, which spanned some 40 minutes 
and a whole host of topics. Among other 
things, we talked about the new iMac Pro, 
Apple’s move into AR, the delay to HomePod 
and the process to get to iPhone X.
It’s on that latter topic that we begin, with 
Schiller characteristically enthused.  
“It’s probably the boldest of the things we’ve 
done – thinking back to the start when the 
teams started working on [the device] and 
made proposals of some of the things we 
would ultimately do with the technology.
“At the time, at the beginning, it seemed 
almost impossible. Not just almost. It seemed 
impossible. And to pull off what feels 
impossible and make it possible – and not 
only that, but just something we love using 
– is just a great achievement.
“Clearly there was a point in the process 
where we had to commit to the fact that it 
would be a full top-to-bottom screen on the 
front with no home button, which means 
you’re counting on Face ID working as we’d 
hope, and being as good.
“That’s an exciting moment, when you 
have to sort of… the old saying: ‘Burn the 
boats. Leave the past behind, and commit.’ 
Knowing that the team was willing to make 
that gamble was a key point early enough in 
the process.”
We mention that we were surprised the 
learning curve for the iPhone X gestures was 
unexpectedly short. “One of the things I find 
is that often with technology, it’s not the 
first try that tells you and informs you how 
it’ll be like to live with it, what it means to 
use it, how well you adapt to it; it’s the first 
time you set it up as your own. That’s when 
you really judge: what does this mean?”
tech it out
“Most people are comfortable with it within 
minutes – 30 minutes, whatever. It’s not the 
kind of thing you have to live with for a week 
or two to get used to. It doesn’t mean… you 
know, we’ve still got muscle memory 
sometimes and we might try to do 
something and we remember, ‘Oh no, that’s 
not how you do it’ - you want to swipe up on 
an iPhone 8 or 7, or on an iPad, and no, it 
doesn’t work that way. That, to me, is always 
the sign of some or our most advanced, best 
thought-out technology: they become 
intuitive incredibly quickly and change how 
you think about everything else you use.
Schiller acknowledges that Apple “knew 
what we had” with the Touch ID fingerprint 
sensor and that it knew what it had created 
with the home button through the years. 
“We knew it was no small thing to decide to 
replace that.” He adds that Apple believed it 
could make something people would love in 
its place, and would have even bigger 
potential over time.
I say to Schiller that we’ve been surprised 
at how good Face ID is for Apple Pay. “Yes. 
That was on a long list of things we knew 
we had to deliver. The home button, at the 
beginning, really did one thing. Maybe two. 
It woke up your screen, and then it let you go 
to the home screen from any app. And then 
over the years, we’ve layered on many uses 
– the multitasking capabilities, evoking Siri, 
you being able to use it for Apple Pay, 
creating Touch ID. So Face ID had a much 
harder job for its first version than the home 
button had for its first version.”
Apple notoriously doesn’t talk about 
products in advance (unless it’s the 2018 Mac 
Pro, when it did), but regardless I ask 
“We kneW

whether Face ID could appear in more Apple 
products beyond phones (laptops and the 
iMac seem like an obvious option)? 
“We try not to get ahead of ourselves,” 
says Schiller with the look of someone who 
may have been asked this question before. 
“While we have many plans throughout the 
year for many things, we also are realists in 
that we need to create something, and that 
we need to make it great, and that we need to 
study, and we need to learn… all the user 
cases all around the world from everybody 
in every situation, before we then imagine 
some of the other things we might do.”
team spirit
We move on to talk about one of Apple’s 
strengths, the relationship between the 
hardware and the software and why that’s 
vital to Apple as a company. “It’s a very 
important thing. It’s something we think 
a lot about. It’s something that we have 
appreciated about the culture of Apple as 
a company, and something that 
we’ve actually worked to 
enhance as well. 
“One of the great things Tim 
[Cook] has done is to recognise 
the power of collaborative work 
at Apple; he encourages us all to 
really take advantage of that; 
and to not only work together, 
but to imagine things in our 
products that would not be 
possible had it not been for that 
collaboration. And those then 
turn into strengths that, as 
customers, we all benefit from.
“That simple idea has 
extended to how you can walk 
up to your Mac, and it unlocks it 
from your Watch. It’s actually 
using very complex, speed-of-
light calculations between the 
internet and your devices to 
understand proximity and 
privacy of whose device it is. So it’s very 
advanced technology, but with a very 
simple benefit.
“Products [like] AirPods and Pencil could 
not work were it not for hardware and 
software and chip teams and radio teams,  
all working together to make something 
happen. And I think the latest feature that’s 
the result of this collaboration is Face ID.
“Other companies certainly have had the 
vision of ‘Can you unlock something with 
someone’s face?’ but no one [has] actually 
delivered technology as advanced and 
capable and ubiquitous and consumer-
friendly as Face ID. And that is the direct 
result of this collaboration, and how these 
teams work for years together on a simple 
powerful idea with all that technology.
Our discussion progresses onto other 
products. I had on my list to talk about 
AirPods, but Schiller wants to talk in detail 
about them before I’ve had chance to ask. 
“So frequently, I talk to customers who say, 
‘My favourite product Apple has ever made 
are AirPods.’ And that’s just a really nice 
thing to hear. I love when customers respond 
that one of their favourite product is 
something this simple, and yet so much 
work went into it.
“At the surface level, it’s an incredibly 
simple product. But the reality is it’s actually 
an incredibly complex product to make. Each 
AirPod really is its own computer, running 
software and hardware. And those two 
computers need to deliver this very clear 
experience that you want, and they have to 
work together, because we’re very attuned 
to synchronisation in audio as a species.
“One of our favourite features is just the 
idea that you take it out and the music stops 
– you put it back in and it keeps going again. 
Again, that’s a simple idea, but took a lot  
of engineering to make it work quickly, 
reliably, for all of us in all different ear sizes 
and different situations. And they have to 
work with this iPhone that may be in your 
pocket or your bag. And as you know, our 
bodies are big bags of water, which are really 
bad for radio signals to get through.
“When we designed the AirPods, we were 
designing them partly with Apple Watch 
[Series 3] in mind. The idea that you can 
have, one day, a cellular experience on your 
watch [with] your AirPods.”
One of the things Apple Watch excels at 
is fitness tracking, and I suggest to Schiller 
that we were impressed with how well the 
AirPods stay in when running with them, 
even if they’re not fitness headphones per se. 
“We all went through the same learning 
curve, which is: we expect them to not stay 
in that well. We’re surprised when they do, 
and then you realise, ‘I had no idea that the 
cables were having such an effect on how 
things stay in my ears’ and that when you 
remove the cable, there’s a bigger difference 
than we thought – both as a design 
team, the customers as we all use 
them; most of everybody goes 
through that realisation.”
No competitioN
I move on to talk about the evolving 
relationship between the Mac and 
iPad Pro. Is the iPad Pro really the 
PC replacement it was touted as? Or 
is it rather a supplementary device 
to the Mac? 
“What we’ve learned, truthfully, 
is that it’s both, and that depends 
on the user,” says Schiller. “For 
some people, iPad Pro is a 
replacement for their computer. 
Not that you throw away your 
computer. People don’t do that. 
“But that it becomes your 
primary computing device. The 
way you mostly hear about this is 
people say, ‘I use a computer at my 
desk’ or ‘I use a notebook at my desk, but 
when I travel, I travel just with my iPad Pro’. 
It is so great in that situation.
“So for those customers, the iPad has 
become their primary device, but they don’t 
think of it in their brains as competing with 
their previous computer. It’s just the 
computer they spend the most time with.
“And then there are other customers who 
augment their computer experience. They 
use their computer a lot, but they also use an 
iPad for a task that it is clearly far better for 
than their computer. 
“I think that people love to watch movies 
on their iPad more than they do on a 
computer. People like to read on their iPad 
better than on their computer.
“So depending on what those tasks are, 
for those customers they’re augmenting. 
“one of The 
greaT Things 
Tim has done is 
To recognise 
The poWer of 
collaboraTive 
Work aT apple”

And what we try to do is not tell the 
customer that either direction is the right or 
wrong way. It’s almost like they’re making a 
distinction between the two, even though 
the uses are overlapping, and one is 
replacing the other frequently.
“It’s an interesting thing. The words are 
important. People don’t necessarily like the 
word ‘replace’ when they’re making these 
choices. But in reality, they are spending 
more time with it.” 
Schiller is then keen to talk about a 
related product he’s especially proud of 
– Apple Pencil – and even returns to it after 
I ask another question. 
“Pencil, after AirPods, is maybe the 
second product that I hear customers say is 
their new favourite Apple thing. Again, it’s 
such a simple device. A simple, solid, clear, 
very focused purpose, and yet, the 
technology behind that is incredibly 
advanced and we’ve just seen a tremendous 
response to that from the designers who 
work with it.
“I’m seeing more and more professionals 
and university students use it for note-
taking and annotating documents, 
whatever, and really enjoying that 
experience. Now, is that a replacement for a 
computer? Is that an augmentation? I don’t 
know. Let them use whatever words they 
want. But they just like using it a lot. And so  
I think it’s not complete to talk about iPad 
Pro without also talking about Pencil.”
I move the conversation onto the Mac and 
ask why Apple has decided now is the time 
for the iMac Pro, after years without an 
update to the Pro desktop line-up – the Mac 
Pro hasn’t been updated since 2013, and a 
new Mac Pro is promised in 2018, with the 
iMac Pro offering a new, different option for 
high-end users in the mean time. 
“First of all, we care deeply about our pro 
customers. Always have, always will. We 
love that so much is created on Mac.
“One of the things we’ve learned over the 
last few years is the depth of love and loyalty 
for macOS by our pro customers. And pro is 
a very large term. It encompasses many 
different people who in turn have many 
different needs.
pros of all kiNds
“What we find is we have a lot of pros on 
MacBook Pro; we have a lot of pros on iMac; 
and we have pros on Mac Pro. So a number of 
years ago, when we talked about how we 
need to move all our products forward for 
pros, we knew we needed to, along with 
MacBook Pro – and doing a new Mac Pro  
– meet an iMac need.
“This time, we decided to push it further. 
We asked our engineering teams, ‘Can you 
make an iMac Pro that’s truly designed for 
pros?’ It really, inside, is a completely 
different computer.
“So why now? Because this is how long 
it’s taken. It was a big, big project, and that’s 
just how things go. It takes this time. And 
we’re getting close to when it’s out there. It’s 
very soon. A matter of days now (the iMac 
Pro has since been released). And like all of 
our products, we have a lot of thoughts and 
feelings about it. But the truth will be: what 
do customers tell us? I can’t wait. 
“This is always the most exciting moment 
of the process. It truly is. A whole new 
product. Nobody’s used it yet in the real 
world, and they’re about to, and what are we 
all going to learn? That’s probably one of the 
most fun moments in any product launch 
that we have.”
Talking about products that are coming 
soon, I ask about HomePod and the delay  
to the launch of the product which was 
originally slated for this month. Why has 
there been a pause? 
“It’s really very simple: it’s a brand-new 
product. It’s a lot of engineering to make it 
be the product we’ve described, and for it 
to be what we all hope it can be. And I’m 
actually really proud that we’re a company 
that will take the time to do something 
right. Our goal is always not to be ‘most’ but

to be ‘best’, and we set high standards. We 
often exceed those, but not always. And we 
need to be self-honest if something’s not 
ready, and continue to work on it until it is.”
Schiller is also frank about AI-driven 
speakers being still very much a developing 
product category. 
“Nobody really knows how we all want to 
use these kinds of products. There might not 
be one product for everybody. And our 
[focus is] on having great sounding music 
wherever you place it in your room, or a 
great interaction with Siri for a music 
experience – we think that that’s a great 
[starting] point for a new kind of product.
“I think others have different 
perspectives on the things that they’re 
making, and we’re all going to learn 
together what we think.”
Originally, the chat between myself and 
Schiller was to be around ARKit, current 
app developments and the future potential 
for new app technologies, so I asked about 
that as well, and where Apple’s focus on AR 
might lead. 
“We’ve been talking about augmented 
reality for a while – about a year. We did a lot 
of work understanding both VR and AR. We 
know there is a place in the world for both 
technologies, but of the two, augmented 
reality is perhaps the greatest opportunity to 
change how we use technology and how we 
do many tasks in our lives.
“We think it’s the most ubiquitous 
technology in front of us; we’re at the 
beginning of this gigantic curve that’s going 
to happen. So this is pretty thrilling. We can 
probably talk for hours about what it could 
be, but the truth is, nobody knows. And 
that’s the fun of it.
“We believe that, with the fullness of 
time, augmented reality has that 
opportunity to transform most of everything 
we do with technology. 
“It helps how you visualise and work with 
products and technologies. [The IKEA Place 
app] is a great early example of how you can 
visualise furniture in your living room, not 
just something in a showroom. It’s the stuff 
of science fiction. We’ve seen it in movies, 
and now we get to actually hold it in our 
hands. It’s very cool.”
“The truth is, [AR games] began before we 
released ARKit, with Pokémon Go. That was 
a beginning form of augmented reality that 
was just with great universal appeal. Now 
with ARKit, they can make a much better 
version of it, and they’re hard at work at 
that. There’s just an endless list of things, but 
the truth is, it’s going to change more things 
than we can imagine right now.”
smart homekit
I got to ask just one final question and I 
wanted to focus on HomeKit, Apple’s smart 
home control protocol built into Siri and iOS, 
which we’re hearing more and more about 
as the smart home market explodes. Home 
automation has been talked about for a long 
time (Schiller acknowledges this with a 
smile), and a lot of the solutions haven’t been 
very elegant. Why is now the right time to 
release and push HomeKit? 
“To do [this], takes time,” muses Schiller. 
It’s inevitable that we will walk into our 
homes and say something and the lights 
come on without having to search around for 
a light switch or ask for the heat to be turned 
down when it gets too hot or turn on your TV 
and watch a show. This isn’t in question. I 
think everyone accepts we’re on a path here 
together as a world to get there.
“We believe the correct way to do voice 
control is with an understanding of the 
user’s attention, not the user being trained 
to memorise commands. So for us, with Siri, 
that means we have to develop [its] 
knowledge so that developers can create the 
products – the light switches, the heating 
controls and the home security system and 
all that you need – without having to, 
themselves, create the artificial intelligence. 
That’s on us, as the platform creator, to do.
“All of that foundational work has been 
going on for more than a year now, and it 
starts to result in more and more products 
that are coming to market to support that. 
And it’s the beginning of the first builders 
across Europe to start to build homes that 
have it in from the beginning for the buyer 
– which I think is a great sign of the progress 
that we’re making towards the goal that  
we all want.
“So yeah, we believe in HomeKit. We 
believe in building an intelligent home. 
That’s part of the ecosystem of our products, 
and it works together with them in an 
intuitive and safe way.”
And with that, our interview ends. We 
shake hands and we shuffle off. 
Schiller has left me with plenty to muse 
on, anticipate and speculate over. But he also 
left me with one overriding feeling - that 
above all else this is a guy who’s unbelievably 
passionate about the hardware and software 
Apple creates.

indeed. I was glad to be one of the first 
primarily because I didn’t want to wait 
around getting more and more 
nervous over time. 
To be honest, after all the talk about 
the clutch, I was most concerned 
about messing that up. I really didn’t 
want to stall the car in the pit lane 
(which someone did, while someone 
else misjudged the first corner 
meaning the circuit’s lorry had to be 
deployed for rescue). 
I stepped into the car and was 
strapped in so tightly I really wasn’t 
sure I’d be able to breathe well 
enough. Then came the familiar noise 
from so many Sunday afternoons 
watching F1: the wheel guns crashing 
into life as the tyres went on. 
The engineers rolled me out into the 
pit lane on a set of dolly wheels, and 
then turned me to face the end of the 
pit lane. Gulp…
burning rubber
Under the instruction of the race 
engineer, who was also standing in 
the pit lane speaking to me over the 
intercom, I was told to select first gear 
and then told to let the clutch out – 
again warning me to do it very slowly.
As I did so the car moved forward 
and I accelerated. But not as much as  
I needed to. I realised that if I stayed 
he 7am minibus rolled up 
to my hotel at Le Castellet, 
around 40km from 
Marseille in the south of 
France. Today was the day I drove an 
F1 car. It was a bleary-eyed start, but 
I changed into my overalls along with 
around 10 other willing participants.
We’d be driving Formula Renault 2.0 
cars in the morning (think: a step 
below Formula 3), among various 
other activities to get us prepared, 
followed by several laps in the Formula 
1 car after lunch – providing we made 
the grade in the morning. 
First was a drivers’ briefing to learn 
about a few things we needed to be 
aware of regarding safety, and by 8am 
we were in a minibus going around the 
circuit for the first time, learning the 
layout. Back indoors, we loosened up 
with some gentle exercises followed 
by a briefing on the FR 2.0 cars. 
We were then sent off in the car in 
groups of three or four with a pace car 
in front. The pace car got gradually 
faster, and it was quite a challenge to 
get used to the Formula Renault car 
at first. After a Batak fitness/agility 
training session to test our reaction 
time, we were sent out again in the FR 
2.0 car before an exercise to help us 
visualise the track. We had to ‘think’ 
our way around the track and compare 
the resulting time to our actual time in 
the car. The telemetry from our 
morning driving was analysed, which 
didn’t exactly look great: we weren’t 
accelerating hard enough and 
therefore not having to brake hard 
enough either.
Still, having shown our natural talent 
(or, at least, basic competence), the 
instructor sent us through for our F1 
seat fitting – at last we were about to 
sit in the car! The seating position is so 
low it feels unnatural – you’re almost 
lying down, and it’s extremely weird 
hardly being able to see over the top 
of the dash. 
are you ready?
The brake pedal is so stiff it feels  
like it’s not a pedal at all. You really 
need to stamp on it to get it to work. 
As we found out later, the brakes are 
tremendously effective, but when real 
F1 drivers are going at full pelt they 
have to apply a Herculean amount of 
pressure to the pedal to slow the 
machine down. 
After lunch at around 1pm we were 
into the F1 briefing. This bit made 
driving the car sound daunting, not 
least because of the clutch. The clutch 
on an F1 car is a paddle on the back of

two clutch paddles on modern F1 cars 
for a more precise start). The main 
question in my head at this point was 
about gearing – even when the 
instructor suggested gears that we 
should take some of the corners in, I 
was still worried about remembering 
what gear to be in at what time.

I would be one of the first two people

The same V8s raced in F1 by Kimi 
Räikkönen and Romain Grosjean
The F1 cars used are V8s from the 2012 FIA 
Formula One World Championship and are now 
Renault Sport F1 demonstration cars. They are 
speed limited – not that we ever hit it! – and the 
cars were originally raced under the Lotus name 
by Kimi Räikkönen and Romain Grosjean. We 
drove Grosjean’s old car, which usually resides on 
the right of the garage. 
These retired cars come with two articulated 
lorries and their own crew. The crew are a 
mixture of people who’ve retired from going 
around the world with the main F1 team, and 
several enthusiastic youngsters hoping to make 
the grade and step up to going on F1 race 
weekends regularly.

the track
Circuit Paul Ricard returns to F1  
for the first time since 1990 
The track Renault uses for its Renault 
Sport F1 experiences – run by the 
Winfield Racing School – is the Circuit 
Paul Ricard. Opened in 1970, the track 
was used for the French Grand Prix until 
1990. Next year it will return to the F1 
calendar for the first time since then.
We drove a shortened version of the 
main circuit, 3.8km instead of 5.8km, 
including two straights and a twisty, 
difficult final section. 
Winfield has an F1 legacy, including 
Alain Prost and Damon Hill graduating 
from its ranks. You can book an F1 
experience like ours for a cool £10,500 
(+VAT) at winfieldracingschool.com.

cautious on the accelerator,  
I was going to stall. I needed to be 
more confident and aggressive on it. 
So I trundled anxiously down the pit 
lane and tentatively out towards the 
very tight first corner. 
I decided to take that one relatively 
gently and then sort myself out. 
Although this was a bit slow, it wasn’t 
that far from the end of the pit lane to 
the first corner, giving me just enough 
time to get used to the monster in my 
nervous grasp. 
need For speed
Then I was able to set off on my three 
laps proper – getting used to the car 
gradually. I felt almost immediately 
more comfortable than in the FR 2.0 
car in the morning; because it was a 
much smoother experience, it was 
actually a lot easier to drive. 
Before getting back, the engineer 
spoke through my earpiece to remind 
me to change gear more regularly 
– the end of the circuit is a twisty 
section, and I wasn’t changing up and 
down as much as I should have 
through the more complex parts. 
By the second lap I felt a lot more 
comfortable and I was able to give it 
more beans on both straights in my 
final lap, although I felt my cautious 
side creep back in and slow down well 
before the tight corner at the end of 
the pit straight. 
I wanted to keep driving and grow 
into the car even more, but as I was 
thinking about turning into the start of 
the pit lane, the engineer told me my 
precious time was already up. 
slowing down
It was a superb day and I truly felt that 
if I had, say, driven 10 laps instead of 
three, that I would have been able to 
be a lot faster as my confidence grew. 
Given others’ difficulties in driving the 
F1 car, I felt pretty damn proud I had 
managed to keep the thing on the 
track – and running smoothly – the 
whole time.
As we returned to the Winfield base 
at the other side of the circuit, I felt 
elated yet somewhat relieved, too, that 
it was over. After changing back into 
our clothes, we celebrated with 
champagne (naturally) and were 
presented with our telemetry data, a 
certificate and a wooden model of the 
track, which looks pretty good on the 
bookcase at home.

92 T3 february 2018
Tested 
icrosoft has debuted a 
15-inch version of the 
Surface Book 2, which 
is out in the US and is 
coming to the UK this year. But 
thankfully, the 13.5-inch edition 
has already made it to these shores.
The Surface range has always been 
designed to showcase what Windows 
is capable of – and to take the fight for 
high-performance mobile computing 
to Apple. Microsoft has made no 
secret of the fact it’s targeting Apple’s 
creative heartland, and the success 
and usefulness of the Surface Pen is 
a big part of this assault. 
The Surface Book 2 is very much 
a follow-up to the original, but the 
landscape for Surface devices has 
changed a little now that Surface 
Laptop has arrived. Surface Laptop 
is a Surface Book for those who just 
want a laptop, leaving Surface Book 2 
free of any traditional bonds to target 
those who want a laptop and a 
kick-ass Windows tablet they can use 
with Surface Pen. It’s a jack-of-all-
trades, with complete versatility to 
go alongside awesome power.

Surface Book 2
These devices take the two-in-one 
convertible concept to the nth degree; 
they’re most certainly not like the 
Surface or Surface Pro. And if you 
remember Surface RT, well, we’re 
surprised Microsoft hasn’t been 
round to wash your brain of the 
memory, Men in Black-style.
For our money, the 15-incher is too 
big. You simply don’t need a tablet 
that size, and it’s too big to be truly 
portable. Because of its unusual 
thickness – thanks to the unique 
hinge – it’s already a little bit of a 
struggle to get this laptop into a bag 
that’s specifically designed to be able 
to take a 13-inch laptop. 
While Surface Book 2 is similar  
to the original version, there are two 
big differences for us. The first is a 
beneath-the-surface tweak: the Core 
i5 version of the laptop now features 
fanless cooling. The Core i7 version 
still needs active cooling due to its 
greater power consumption (as do  
all models of the 15-inch).
Second, the heft has decreased 
slightly with this new model. It’s 
312x232x13mm (at its thinnest part), 
so Surface Book 2 is slightly smaller 
and thinner than its predecessor, and 
it weighs 1.6kg compared to the 
original’s 2kg. Surface Book’s main 
issue is that it feels bulky compared 
to many thin and light laptops around 
at the moment – most notably the 
super-thin MacBook Pro. 
Fulcrum hinge
At 15mm, the MacBook Pro is slightly 
thicker than the Surface Book 2 is 
at its thinnest point; but while the 
MacBook Pro is uniform throughout, 
the Surface Book 2’s hinge means it’s 
much thicker in that area thanks to 
the fulcrum type arrangement. 
You do get used to it, though, and  
it enables you to position the screen  
at some pleasingly jaunty angles. 
However, rivals such as Dell and 
Lenovo have managed to produce 
clever laptops that don’t require 
such massive hinges. 
Surface Book 2 is definitely a 
performance proposition, with a 
price tag to match. The base model 
isn’t too bad, but given it doesn’t 
have a dedicated GPU, you would be 
forgiven for thinking you need the 
upgraded model – which costs £500 
more. That’s a hell of a leap. 
Comparisons 
The base-level Surface Book 2 
13.5-inch model gives you a seventh-
generation Intel Core i5 CPU, 8GB 
RAM, 256GB and an integrated GPU, 
for £1,499. By comparison, the Dell 
XPS 13 costs a lot less but admittedly 
doesn’t feature the same level of 
components. It starts at £999 for a 
dual-core Intel Core i3 CPU, the same 
RAM and around half the storage 
– with a Full HD InfinityEdge screen. 
Then there’s an XPS 13 with the 
latest-gen Intel Core i7 CPU, the same 
RAM and storage as the Surface Book 
2, plus an Nvidia GTX 1050 GPU with 
2GB GDDR5 memory – for £1,999. 
Meanwhile £2,499 gets you one with 
16GB RAM, 512GB SSD and an Nvidia 
GTX 1050 GPU. The top configuration 
costs £2,999 for the same processor 
and RAM, but with a whopping 1TB 
SSD and a GTX 1050. 
A better XPS 13 model comes with 
an Intel Core i7 processor, 3200x1800

1600:1 contrast ratio

InfinityEdge touch display and 8GB 
of RAM for around half the asking 
price of the top-end Surface Book 2 
13.5-inch model. Value-for-money 
certainly isn’t on the agenda here.
The Surface Book 2 - even the top 
specification – is unsurprisingly a 
productivity-focused device rather 
than one you want for games (there’s 
2GB of graphics memory). If you do 
want the latter and money isn’t a 
problem, it’s probably worth waiting 
for the 15-inch Surface Book 2 to 
arrive in the UK later in 2018. 
Coincidentally, as with the 
previous Surface Book, the dedicated 
graphics system is in the base, so if 
you use the screen as a detached 
tablet, you’ll be using integrated 
graphics instead. If you detach while 
using a graphics-intensive app, you 
will be warned. The base also gives 
the Surface Book additional power.
The stated battery life of 17 hours  
is a little optimistic, but during 
intensive testing we managed a full 
day’s work out of it. If all you’re doing 
is some browsing and working in 
documents, you’ll be looking at a lot 
more time than that. The tablet’s life is 
best described as ‘several hours’ – you 
won’t have a problem lasting through 
an all-morning meeting, but then it 
will be time to charge. You can charge 
the tablet separately from the body. 
As you’ll know if you’ve seen 
anything of the earlier model, the 
screen of the Surface Book 2 detaches 
with a satisfying click (via a key on 
the keyboard or a taskbar button) 
although Microsoft has made some 
improvements to the ‘muscle wire’ 
mechanism this time. 
As you may know, Windows 10 
automatically turns into tablet mode 
when you detach, which makes 
things a lot simpler, though you can 
still have the full desktop on the tablet 
MiCRoSofT SuRfACe Pen
For artists and creatives, the Surface Pen 
boasts precision ink on one end and a rubber 
eraser on the other — plus tilt (1,028 levels) 
for shading, greater sensitivity (4,096 levels), 
and, Microsoft claims, “virtually no lag”.

The trackpad is smooth and 
responsive, while the Surface 
keyboards have always been some  
of the best around. The backlit 
keyboard is great to type on thanks  
to plenty of key travel – we could 
happily tap away all day long.
Surface colours 
The 3000x2000 267ppi screen looks 
fantastic thanks to a 1600:1 contrast 
ratio that makes colours appear 
simply brilliant. Some may find the 
3:2 aspect ratio a little strange at first, 
but there’s plenty of space from top to 
bottom to put documents alongside 
each other – you don’t get that with 
many ultraportable laptops which 
have 16:9 ratios. 
As a Windows 10 tablet, the Surface 
Book 2 is probably the best example 
around; it’s so thin and light. That 
said, as a laptop the whole thing feels 
a tad unbalanced on your lap, as the 
base of the device is so heavy.
Microsoft has opted for USB-C 
with the Surface Book 2, unlike the 
original, even if it is just a single port. 
Unfortunately Microsoft just doesn’t 
have the balls that Apple does to go 
cold turkey on older USB ports, so 
there are two of those. There’s even a 
full-size SD Card reader, which 
photographers will appreciate. 
As with the Google Pixelbook and 
Pixelbook Pen, it’s a huge miss that 
Microsoft makes you pay £99 for the 
Surface Pen stylus (see box left). 
Once again, the Surface Pen can 
magnetically attack to the side of 
Surface Book 2, but at this price it 
really should be included, especially 
as many of Surface’s core tablet mode 
experiences leave you desiring a 
stylus. The Surface Dial - a puck that 
can change context-sensitive settings 
- works brilliantly with the Surface 
Book 2. Again it’s not included in the 
box, but that’s more understandable 
given it’s not quite as essential.
What’s in Store? 
Windows 10 is pretty decent as a 
tablet OS, even if it isn’t quite as 
intuitive as iOS. But the Microsoft 
Store remains a problem; there still 
aren’t enough decent apps and the 
experience of the Store itself remains 
woeful and slow. 
You can only conclude that 
Microsoft isn’t capable of producing  
a good app store and attracting 
developers, because we’re now five 
years on from the original launch. 
Still, it’s OK because Windows is such 
a well-supported platform for other 
applications outside of the store. 
The Surface Book 2 13.5-inch is 
undoubtedly a premium product; 
nothing feels underdone and it’s the 
most powerful two-in-one laptop 
we’ve tried. It’s an excellent showcase 
for Windows 10, including the new 
features of the Fall Creators Update, 
such as Windows Mixed Reality. It 
has a premium design and excellent 
features, though it comes at a price.
We’re impressed The screen is astounding,  
the design is fantastic, and it’s the best 
Windows tablet you can get.
We’d improve It is heavy compared to other 
ultraportable rivals, and it’s expensive. 
The last word If you’re fully invested 
in Windows rather than macOS, you can  
do no better than this.

Glance at the Boost Up, and you might mistake it 
for a saucer. Its body is slightly wider at the top 
than the bottom, with a grippy rubber ring on top 
for your phone, and the same material on the 
bottom to stop slippage. It’s great for larger phones.

Under the pad’s rim is a small cavity for connecting

illuminates only when power is being transferred.

The convenience of inductive charging carries a 
premium: most phones have a quick-charge option 
they either come with an adapter for, or you can 
buy for about £20 that will charge them faster. It’s 
much less cool, admittedly.

This took the same amount of time to charge an 
iPhone X as the Mophie, but again, worked fine. As 
a sign of how wireless power works, they’re only a 
tiny bit faster than using the wired 5W iPhone 
adapter, not the 50% faster you might expect. 
Design 
 
 
 
 
Mophie’s charger is mostly rubber-coated, so it’s 
grippy on a tabletop. It has a smaller diameter than 
the Belkin, so larger phones overhang. In practice, 
you’ll want to leave room to avoid knocks to your 
phone whichever mat you choose.

Mophie’s base has a rounded outer edge. The cable 
slots into a recessed port and has a flush finish at 
the mat’s edge. Unlike the Belkin, the cable runs 
into the plug’s bottom. The light on the base’s front 
is arguably more discreet, but a little harder to see.
value 
 
 
 
 
Beyond their outward appearance, the two mats 
are very similar, with an identical price tag, so it all 
hinges on if you want to pay for convenience. 
However, this mat’s size is a little conservative 
for phones with a screen over 5.5 inches.

The Qi standard is 5W of charging power, but both 
these pads provide 7.5W for iPhone 8/X only.

ReMarkable
igital detox. That’s not a phrase 
you’d expect to see in T3, yet it goes 
hand-in-hand with the ReMarkable, 
a low-tech tablet aimed at paper 
lovers craving a digital sketching, reading and 
writing experience. In an age of digital 
overwhelm the ReMarkable focuses on work/
study without distractions – save for Wi-Fi to 
transfer files, it’s an internet-free zone.
With the ReMarkable you can read, create, 
store and transfer documents, notebooks and 
ebooks (ePub, PDF), though heavy users will 
chew through the 8GB of memory. You can also 
bookmark pages, make notes and sketch with 
the responsive Marker stylus.
We love the 10.3-inch Canvas touchscreen 
display, with its push-button page turners, but 
creating and transferring files was a mixed bag; 
the software was glitchy; reading isn’t as 
dynamic as it is on an e-reader; and we were 
unable to email bigger notebooks. Writing on 
the ReMarkable, however, is pure joy, complete 
with scratchy, ‘pencil on paper’ sound. A lack of 
blue light means it suits bedtime use, too.
The ReMarkable is a niche device that’s 
desperate to bin your consumption of paper and 
help you work more effectively, without 
suffering digital overwhelm. At the high price 
we were expecting a smoother performance, but 
it’s still one of the sleekest, most promising bits 
of eco and mindfulness tech right now.
It’s a low-tech poster tablet, but is

LG’s Signature line is where you’ll find LG’s fanciest

LG Signature

Dream Screen
he W7 wallpaper TV may 
be LG’s current OLED 
poster boy, but the 
unusual form factor of 
that deconstructed flatscreen won’t 
suit everyone. Drop one rung down 
the hierarchy ladder, though, and 
you’ll find a genuine crowd-pleaser: 
the Signature G7.
This premium OLED doesn’t skimp 
when it comes to cosmetics and 
specification, but its conventional 
design makes it eminently adoptable.
The model featured here is a 
65-incher, but it’s also available in 
77-inch guise, for a wallet-numbing 
£20,000 (give or take a few quid).  
The G7 looks properly premium. 
LG describes the design as “picture on 
glass”. The panel is bonded to a 
patterned glass backing, with tuner 
and electronics strapped to the back 
and hidden in the pedestal stand. This 
plinth can be repositioned in order to 
allow wall-mounting. Despite its 
thinness, this is a hefty beast, tipping 
the scales at 32kg.
The pedestal is home to four HDMI 
inputs, all HDCP 2.2 compliant for 4K 
source hook-up, plus 3 USB inputs 
(one a fast v3.0 for timeshifting), 
Ethernet and an optical digital 
output. Sitting beneath the screen is 
an integrated soundbar with a 
dramatic louvre-style grille.  
The set has twin terrestrial 
Freeview Play tuners, plus satellite 
alternatives. Dual-band Wi-Fi 
supports Ethernet. It ships with two 
remote controls: the latest iteration of 
LG’s Magic Remote, which features a 
scroll wheel to control the onscreen 
cursor, and a simplified pointer.

HDR10, DolbyVision and broadcast

specific Technicolour HDR setting, 
and LG’s own Active HDR 
management for upscaling SDR.
The G7 doesn’t support 3D, but 
sonically speaking, the set can be 
considered cutting-edge. A built-in 
Dolby Atmos decoder makes the most 
of Atmos-encoded audio from the 
likes of Sky, BT TV and Netflix. To 
properly exploit this, you’ll need a

LG Signature OLED65G7V
Sports, Game, HDR Effect, Vivid and 
ISF Bright room/Dark room modes. 
Standard is our go-to choice for most 
content. With HDR, each of these 
presets gets an appropriate boost.
While there is no need to deviate 
far from these presets, minor tweaks 
can maximise image performance: 
watch 4K Blu-ray movies on the 
Cinema Home preset with TruMotion 
turned Off and Dynamic Contrast set 
to Low, and always keep Super 
Resolution set to Low or Medium.
Another tip is to make sure that 
Just Scan is set to On rather than Auto 
in the Aspect Ratio menu, as this 
helps reduce patterning artefacts 
over fine 4K detail.
Hello gorgeous
OLED’s characteristic deep blacks 
guarantee really dynamic images, 
and make for a wonderfully cinematic 
viewing experience. When playing 
letterbox movies, the bars are totally 
black. Colour depth and vibrancy on 
this 10-bit panel is gorgeous.  
LG has made massive strides 
delivering peak HDR brightness. We 
measured peak luminance with a five 
per cent window, at just over 730cd/
m2 (aka nits), using the Standard 
image preset. This translates to a 
vibrant, comfortable HDR viewing 
experience. The set tone maps UHD 
Blu-ray content mastered at 1000 nits 
with hardly any black level crushing. 
And with a growing amount of 
Dolby Vision encoded material, from 
Netflix to 4K UHD, it’s great to have 
compatibility on tap. DolbyVision 
uses dynamic metadata to optimise 
HDR content on a scene-by-scene 
basis. Look for it on the Netflix 
original movie Okja.
To see the set really shine, take  
a gander at Star Trek: Discovery 
(Netflix). This show may be 1080p,  
but HDR quality and colour detail are 
superb. And, as you’d expect from an 
emissive display, background 
uniformity is top-notch.
The G7 does a fine job upscaling HD 
to 4K, giving SDR content cinematic 
sparkle. When Deckard first meets 
Rachel in Blade Runner: The Final 
Cut (Blu-ray), the room is heavily 
shadowed, but Jordan Cronenweth’s 
cinematography has lustre and depth.
The TV does have a weakness, 
though. Its handling of motion judder 
and moving detail isn’t entirely 
successful. The Smooth and Clear 
modes exhibit obvious interpolation 
artefacts. We reckon the best option 
is the User TruMotion setting, which 
can be optimised for TV shows (using 
Dejudder 0, Deblur 8) or sports 
footage (Dejudder 4, Deblur 10).
The integrated soundbar does a 
sterling job. LG describes it as a 4.2 
sound system, but the soundstage is 
clearly stereophonic. Still, it’s 
powerful and full-bodied; with 60W 
on board, there’s plenty of oomph.  
There’s stiff competition at the 
premium end of the OLED market  
- most notably from Sony’s A1 and  
Panasonic’s underrated EZ952. But 
this flatscreen from LG is certainly 
one to lust over.
We’re impressed High-end 
industrial design and peerless 
picture performance. 
We’d improve The TruMotion 
presets struggle to shake off 
unwanted artefacts. 
The lasT Word We love the 
G7. Superior design, delicious AV 
performance, sensational UHD 4K 
image clarity, impressive audio; 
eye-opening onboard Dolby 
Atmos and integrated soundbar is 
the icing on a very satisfying cake.

Verdict
read more speaker reviews on 
T3.com: bit.ly/t3speakers
irpulse Audio will be a new name to 
many, but the company’s credentials 
are solid. The brand is fronted by 
audio designer Phil Jones, former 
founder of highly regarded British hi-fi outfit 
Acoustic energy. And what we have here is an 
ambitious active loudspeaker (no separate amp 
required) with audiophile aspirations.
Build quality is unequivocally premium. The 
cabinet is 25mm MDF with a luscious cherry 
wood veneer and satin lacquer finish.  
The horn-loaded ribbon tweeter is an 
intriguing attraction. It’s partnered with a 
139mm mid-woofer featuring a rigid aluminium 
cone - it’s this element which is responsible for 
the speaker’s sweet, unctuous midrange.  
Horn-loaded ribbon tweeters and a fantastic mid-range 
bring startling clarity to these studio-grade active monitors
AirPulse A200 
getting Active
 A
The amp section offers two analogue inputs 
(one balanced), plus two digital (optical and 
coaxial) audio inputs. There’s also Bluetooth 
aptX support for direct streaming. The A200 
utilises Class D architecture: 2 x 10w drives the 
ribbon tweeters, with 2 x 55w for the woofers.
The ribbon tweeters are key to the A200’s 
fabulous clarity. They reveal layer upon layer of 
detail. Blondie’s Sunday Girl, a 16-bit CD rip, 
sounds factory fresh; the scritch of punky guitar 
and percussive detail are revelatory. Mid-range 
is similarly fabulous, as evidenced by Adelle’s 
vocal on Hello (an MQA encode), that perfectly 
pitched piano an immaculate accompaniment.
The soundstage is crisp and focused; there is 
air and space in the musical presentation. If the 
enclosures do have a limitation, it’s deep bass. 
There’s no profundity below 50Hz.
That said, as a near field monitor, the A200 
are impeccably precise. Indeed, they sound as if 
they should cost twice as much.

A Genelec hiGh-end 2.1 
stereo setup – with  
leArn to plAy dAy 2018!
There are few things cooler and more satisfying in 
life than the ability to play a musical instrument, but 
we know it can be a bit daunting to get started. That’s 
why we’ve teamed up with Learn to Play Day to offer a 
brilliant Genelec speaker system, to promote the free 
music lessons you can get all over the country on 17 and 
18 March 2018! 
Over 100 music shops up and down the country are 
participating by holding totally free music lessons for 
absolutely anyone – 2017’s Learn to Play Day delivered 
over 12,000 taster lessons in locations such as shops, 
schools and studios. and Music for all, the charity 
behind Learn to Play Day (backed by the likes of rick 
Wakeman, Jools Holland and rick astley), is aiming to 
make 2018 even bigger and better!
The local venues across the uK will be holding 
introductions to a wide range of music instruments, 
from the classic to the modern, as well as workshops, 
demonstrations, and maybe even the odd appearance 
by local rock stars. find out where you can go for a 
lesson near you at learntoplayday.com!
Of course, if you want to learn an instrument, 
you’re probably already a music lover, so we’re giving 
away a pair of Genelec G2 active speakers and 
an f1 subwoofer. These are made using the same 
professional-level tech in Genelec’s speakers used for 
recording and broadcast the world over. These home 
versions are just as good, but easier to set up, and 
because the amplifier and speakers are all integrated, 
they’re just plug-and-play to get truly epic, crystal-
clear sound quality. for more information about these 
speakers, visit genelec.com

Xiaomi mi Band 2
£29.20, amazon.co.uk
Although there’s a lack of integrated GPS and 
the band feels cheap compared to the others, 
Xiaomi’s superbly priced tracker gives 
admirable performance for its featherweight 
price. Of course, the 0.42-inch OLED screen is 
fuzzy compared to the Samsung, but it 
displays time, calories, steps and heart rate 
adequately enough. The Mi Band 2 is also 
good in bed, keenly spotting when you drop 
off and wake up. Steps and heart rate tracking 
are less accurate, yet in the right ballpark. 
Auto-recognition can be sluggish, but a 
claimed 20-day battery life is promising.
 
 
 
 
Best for tight Budgets
With so many fitness bands claiming to be the best, how do you know which  
one is right for you? We put six of the most popular to the test
band on the run
misfiT shine 2
£49.99, misfit.com/uk_en
Misfit’s bargainous and impressively 
accurate sleep, swim and activity tracker 
has the best claimed battery life here at up 
to six months. Its 12-LED display uses light 
patterns to communicate notifications and 
goal achievements, though interpreting 
these takes practice. Like the TomTom, the 
waterproof Shine 2 is easy to set up, with 
plentiful data displayed in-app. If it wasn’t 
for the round disc being prone to popping 
out of the band – perhaps stick it in the 
included Action Clip instead – this could be 
a winner. 
 
 
 
 
ideal for swimmers
samsung gear fiT2 Pro
£209.99, samsung.com/uk
However you move and relax, Samsung’s 
waterproof sleep and fitness tracker will 
keep tabs. This band isn’t dainty, but it’s 
futuristically sleek, with a customisable 
Super AMOLED display. There’s also 
Spotify offline support and access to 
various fitness apps. The battery lasted just 
over two days, or roughly nine hours with 
GPS, and we experienced some lag in heart 
rate monitoring, making this better for 
casual runners rather than interval trainers. 
Automatic activity tracking is excellent – 
throw on the band and go.

garmin ViVosPorT
£169.99, buy.garmin.com/en-GB
Garmin’s feature-packed sleep, sports and 
fitness tracker offers much motivation for 
shedding pounds. While the screen is dull, and 
its small size is no friend to poor eyesight, 
elsewhere the Vivosport sings. It has decent 
heart rate monitoring and tracks walks, runs 
and bike rides without dragging your 
smartphone along. There’s plenty of fitness 
modes available via the Garmin Connect app, 
including strength training. Battery life is 
impressive – ours lasted nearly a week in 
smartwatch mode, roughly eight hours in GPS 
– giving us plenty of unbridled freedom.

TomTom Touch cardio + 
Body comPosiTion
£99, wiggle.co.uk
TomTom’s splash-proof tracker looks at what’s 
going on inside your body as well as how 
you’re working and resting it. It is simple to set 
up, with an app that encourages goal setting. 
Body mass and fat percentage are estimated 
via a series of measurements at the wrist, 
though short-term it’s hard to judge how 
accurate these are. Activity tracking is 
reliable, with resting heart rate and steps/
calories burned in line with Garmin and Fitbit. 
There’s no GPS, so distance is instead 
‘measured’ by arm movement.
 
 
 
 
Perfect for Beginners
– certainly the ones here - serve 
up smart notifications, they have 
to work extra hard to match the 
calibre of their smartwatch 
brethren. On the other hand, 
there’s something to be said for 
the simplicity of a quality fitness 
band: no surplus tech to explore, 
just comprehensive tracking and 
digestible metrics. Here, we’ve 
tested six of the most popular 
bands to see how they fare at 
monitoring workouts and daily 
activity. As you’ll soon see,  
price isn’t always an indication 
of performance…
fiTBiT alTa hr
£129.99, fitbit.com/uk
We tested this stylish band over a series of 
runs, and found it lightweight and reliable. It’s 
a straight-talking choice for walkers and 
runners wanting easy-glance stats (calories, 
distance, heart rate, etc) at the wrist, with the 
option of drilling down via an app. The OLED 
display is bright, but needs a firm tap, and 
when positioned correctly on the wrist the 
Alta HR does a solid job of heart-rate tracking 
(it automatically tracks sleep, too). Partner it 
with the Fitbit Coach app, and you’ll gain a 
progressive training package to match your 
increasing fitness.

Harrods Hawaiian  
Black loose Tea
Tepid, excessively milky tea can be a deeply miserable experience, especially when served 
in a polystyrene cup for £3.50. Quality costs, and it’s unlikely that any tea is as highly 
priced as this exclusive blend of Hawaiian Black Loose Tea offered by Harrods. Grown in 
the super-fertile soils of Hawaii’s Mauna Loa volcano, the premium brew has Darjeeling 
characteristics, with base notes of honeyed sweet raisin and autumnal fruits, while 
tropical top notes perfectly complement the blend’s sweetness. Use 1-2 teaspoons  
per cup and let it brew for 3-4 minutes. At this price, you’d better get that timing right.
