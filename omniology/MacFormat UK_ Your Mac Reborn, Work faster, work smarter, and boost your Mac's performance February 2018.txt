The eyeQ solves a problem we didn’t even know existed: what if you’re at an event and want 
to be immersed in the action, but also record it on your iPhone? This device lets you do both. 
It’s essentially a set of digital binoculars – whack your iPhone into the eyeQ and it’ll record what 
you see. It’s got a touchpad that feeds into a heads-up display, so you can control the camera 
without removing the headset. It’s pretty expensive, but if you’re serious about being 
immersed and recording the moment for posterity, it might be worth a shot.
 From $249 (about £189)  includes eyeQ, Micro-USB charging cable, adjustable neck strap

 Welcome to MacFormat’s first issue 
of 2018, and hello again to long-term 
readers, who might recognise me 
from my time as production editor. 
To start off the year, our cover feature 
is all about getting your Mac working 
better. It’s full of tips to improve 
performance, and ways to boost your 
skills and get more from your Mac.
There’s much more in this issue, 
naturally, but before you get stuck in, 
we have to talk about the elephant 
in the room: High Sierra security. Just days before this issue 
went to press, a serious vulnerability in the latest macOS 
was disclosed, whereby an intruder could enable and then 
log in as the root user, gaining access to every user’s files. 
Apple swiftly fixed the issue and a spokesperson provided 
us with a statement (see bit.ly/hsrootfix). We can only hope 
that Apple’s promised review of its processes means it never 
messes up this badly again.
Apple’s fix should be installed on your Mac by now, at 
least if your App Store preferences are set to allow system 
data files and security updates to be installed automatically, 
but the fix requires a restart to become active, so you should 
check it has been applied: follow the steps at bit.ly/hssecupd.

 Is iPhone X really 
revolutionary?
achieving virtual Vrvana
irtual and augmented reality 
(VR and AR, respectively) are 
hyped right now, but Apple has 
little on show. Given the progress rivals like 
Microsoft and Facebook are making in this 
area, that seems strange. But it now turns out 
the company may be busier than we thought.
Apple has reportedly bought Vrvana, a 
company that is working on a mixed virtual 
and augmented reality headset called the 
Totem. The purchase supposedly cost Apple 
$30 million and took place in the summer. 
Apple hasn’t commented on the alleged 
takeover – usually the company issues a 
boilerplate statement explaining that it buys 
other firms from time to time. At the time of 
writing, Vrvana’s website was still up and 
running, although its social media pages 
had not been updated since August 2017.
Vrvana’s Totem headset has yet to be 
released. It works by recording the world 
around you using a set of cameras. It then 
projects that onto its 1440p OLED display. 
That method allows it to combine both virtual 
and augmented reality into a single view. 
This is different from the approach taken 
by Microsoft’s HoloLens, which displays 
augmented reality images onto a transparent

pple’s HomePod speaker 
has been delayed into early 
2018. But that’s not the only 
delay it has faced – a recent report has 
highlighted that Apple has been working 
on the Siri speaker since 2012, with 
various revisions along the way.
Apple’s HomePod team was supposedly 
taken completely by surprise when Amazon 
released the Echo in 2014. It bought an Echo, 
took it apart, and apparently scoffed at its audio 
quality, according to the report.
      However, Apple dithered, cancelling and reviving 
the HomePod project several times. As a result, Amazon now 
has a sizeable lead in the market. Apple hopes to sell about four 
million HomePods in 2018, but has a lot of catching up to do.
 HomePod’s 
   troubled path
The device was pushed back  
 several times over the years
a
headset display; Vrvana’s approach allows 
the headset to do a lot more.
Totem’s built-in cameras help to track 
its position in space; infrared cameras are 
used to detect a user’s hands. Apple may 
decide to use Vrvana’s technology and 
integrate it into its own device, rather 
than make use of the device wholesale.
Reality check
Apple has been rumoured to be working 
on a VR or AR headset – or potentially a 
set of AR glasses – for some time now. 
This latest move appears to signal the 
company’s intent to catch up with its 
rivals in this area.
In particular, rumours have swirled of 
an Apple augmented reality headset that 
features a built-in display, a dedicated 
processor and an ‘rOS’ operating system. 
That form factor would fit well with 
Vrvana’s Totem (as opposed to a set of AR 
glasses), so the purchase makes sense.
According to reports, Apple is hoping 
to finalise its headset by the end of 2019, 
and ship the resulting device as early 
as 2020, barring any delays.
In addition to the Vrvana acquisition, 
Apple has bought a number of other AR 
companies in recent months, including 
Metaio, Flyby Media and Faceshift. These 
have all been software companies; Vrvana 
is the first VR hardware company that 
Apple has acquired, perhaps signalling an 
intent to progress its headset 
project at a greater speed.
Tim Cook has made his 
enthusiasm for AR clear, 
saying: “I could not be 
more excited about AR.”

T
he iPhone X is Apple’s 
first phone equipped with 
an OLED display. Still, that’s 
not stopping the company looking ahead 
to the next big thing in display tech.
According to a number of reports, 
that technology is based around 
MicroLED screens. Like the OLED 
display in the iPhone X, MicroLED 
screens are composed of light-emitting 
diodes that produce their own light, 
resulting in excellent contrast ratios.
However, MicroLED components 
are much smaller than their OLED 
equivalents, meaning that a MicroLED 
screen can be incredibly thin and light.
And that’s where Apple comes in. The 
company is well known for its quest to 
make its devices ever more svelte, and

hile everyone’s been focusing 
on the new Apple Park, a second 
Apple ‘spaceship’ is just about 
ready. It’s located in Sunnyvale, California, 
about five miles from Cupertino, and while 
it’s noticeably different to the Apple Park 
building, it shares plenty of the same design 
traits. Its grand, sweeping facade and floor- 
to-ceiling glass walls clearly mark it out as 
belonging to the same family.
Apple calls it the Central & Wolfe campus. 
It’s due to open in early 2018, and will house 
thousands of Apple employees. 
Details of the campus first emerged in late 
2015, but it has been largely overshadowed by

 Apple is known to be 
ramping up its video 
production work, and a 
new report from Loup 
Ventures posits that the 
company will offer 
all-in-one video and 
music subs within two to 
three years. That would 
rival the likes of Netflix 
and Amazon, and focus 
mainly on original 
content. It reckons 
Apple will benefit from 
a running start with 
75 million subscribers.
 We’re used to Apple 
making lots of money, 
and there was no 
surprise when Tim Cook 
announced the firm’s 
fourth-quarter 2017 
results. Apple made 
$52.6 billion in this 
period, up 12% on the 
same period last year. 
Sales of 46 million 
iPhones brought in 
$28.8 billion, iPads 
made $4.8 billion, Mac 
sales came to $7.1 
billion, and services 
made $8.5 billion. 
Not bad going, then.

could greatly help in that 
endeavour when it comes 
to the iPhone.
But due to the microscopic 
scale of making a MicroLED 
array, the manufacturing 
process can pose a lot of 
problems. According to a 
Digitimes report, Apple scaled 
back its MicroLED efforts in 
Taiwan, although it was also 
noted that it could be relocating 
its efforts to the US instead.
Samsung is also reportedly 
looking into the technology, as is 
Facebook for its Oculus virtual 
reality headset.
Apple Park in both the media and popular 
imagination. Designed by architecture firm 
HOK, it is clearly visible from several blocks 
away due to its size and impressive design. 
Like Apple Park, Central & Wolfe has ample 
underground parking to minimise the visual 
impact on the campus, and to improve its 
environmental impact.
On the ground floor there will be a fitness 
centre, a cafeteria, a conference centre and a 
500-person amphitheatre. Upstairs, the office 
spaces will be open plan, according to HOK.
Apple Park opened to employees in April 
2017, while construction was still going on. 
Its visitor centre opened in November 2017.
Apple has only just started using 
OLED tech, but is reportedly looking 
for the next breakthrough.

Protecting a new iPhone X with AppleCare+ cover seems like 
a given – but is it the best option?
X-tra coverage
he iPhone X is incredible in a 
great many ways. Incredibly 
advanced. Incredibly sexy. 
Incredibly expensive. If you’ve 
bought one, you’ll want to protect your shiny 
new gadget, so AppleCare+ seems like a 
natural choice. However, is it the best way to 
give you peace of mind if something goes 
wrong? Over the next few pages, we’ll take a 
look at the options available so you know the 
best way to protect your costly investment.
Firstly, let’s take a quick look at what 
rights are guaranteed to every citizen thanks 
to UK legislation. Under the Consumer Rights 
Act 2015, you have up to six years to return 
an item that was faulty when you bought it 
(in England, Wales and Northern Ireland; you 
get five years in Scotland), although after the 
first six months the onus is on you to prove 
that it was faulty at the time of purchase. 
Incidentally, that six-year (or five-year) period 
is much more generous than the two-year 
return period guaranteed by the EU.
The criteria for return are that the iPhone 
had to have been faulty or damaged when you 
received it, or wasn’t fit for purpose, or was 
not as described. If you return it within the 
first 30 days after buying the device, you are 
legally entitled to a full refund. If you do so 
within the first six months, you’ve got to give 
Apple a chance to repair or replace the faulty 
product (if that’s unsuccessful, you can then 
get a full refund).
Of course, this all applies to damage that 
was already present in the iPhone X when you 
bought it, so doesn’t cover you for anything 
that happens to it once it’s in your possession. 
For that, you’ll need AppleCare+ or third-
party insurance. Let’s start with AppleCare+.
AppleCare+ coverage
AppleCare+ is Apple’s own insurance cover 
for its products. You can purchase it when 
you initially buy an Apple product, or within 
60 days of the date of purchase. For iPhone X, 
it costs £199 for two years of coverage, and 
covers you for up to two instances of 
accidental damage within that period. Each 
claim has an excess: £25 for screen repairs, or 
£79 for anything else. You also get two years 
of priority support from Apple. On top, you 
get coverage for batteries that retain less than 
80% of their original capacity, plus coverage 
for earphones and accessories that were 
included as part of your iPhone X purchase.
AppleCare+ includes a lot then, but won’t 
cover you in all eventualities. It does not cover 
you if you lose your iPhone or it gets stolen,  
and you need to take factors like that into 
consideration when weighing up whether to 
buy an AppleCare+ plan. UK plans exclude 
the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. 
Apple wants you to buy AppleCare+ – that 
much is clear from the repair prices it charges 
if you don’t have AppleCare+ cover. At the 
time of writing, repairing the screen of the

Buying AppleCare+ 
couldn’t be simpler, but 
you need to check that 
it provides the kind of 
cover you’re looking for.

iPhone X will set you back £286.44 if you 
don’t have coverage (compared to £25 if you 
do). Other damage, such as cracking the glass 
back of the device, will cost a galling £556.44. 
For comparison, those same repairs will cost 
£156.44 and £356.44 respectively if you have 
an iPhone 8, so there’s a large premium for 
owning an iPhone X. Even worse, those UK 
prices for iPhone X repairs are actually more 
expensive than Apple charges in the US: 
$279 and $549, respectively.
With prices like that, AppleCare+ can save 
you some serious cash. Assuming you bought 
AppleCare+ for iPhone X and needed the glass 
back of the phone to be repaired, you’d pay 
£278 in total (£199 for AppleCare+ coverage 
and the £79 excess for ‘other damage’). Getting 
the screen repaired would cost you £224. 
Those are savings of £62.44 for a screen 
repair and £278.44 for other damage. That 
means anything that falls under the ‘other 
damage’ category will basically save you 50% 
if you have AppleCare+ compared to not 
having it – a huge saving considering how 
expensive iPhone X repairs are.
Of course, if you have to get the screen 
repaired twice you’ll save £323.88 with 
AppleCare+ coverage, and you’ll save an 
eye-watering £755.88 on two instances 
of ‘other damage’. Food for thought.
Other benefits
AppleCare+ isn’t just about repairs – you also 
get 24/7 priority access to Apple support via 
phone calls or over web chat for the two-year 
length of AppleCare+. Without that, you only 
get 90 days of telephone support from Apple, 
starting on the date you bought the iPhone. 
As well as help for iPhone, AppleCare+ also 
includes troubleshooting for iOS, iCloud, 
wireless networks and Apple’s own iOS apps 
(such as Safari, FaceTime and Mail).
With AppleCare+, there’s also an Express 
Replacement Service, plus the ability to get 
your device repaired at a local Apple Store 
when travelling in Europe. The Express 
Replacement Service will be particularly 
attractive to many people, and it’s something 
that you can’t get without AppleCare+. This 
is where Apple will send you a replacement 
device before you’ve returned the faulty one. 
Apple includes packaging that you can use to 
return the damaged iPhone to the company. 
The replacement device will either be new 
or ‘equivalent to new’, according to Apple. 
It essentially means that you can get back 
to using an iPhone as quickly as possible.
There’s a one-off fee of £79 to have Apple 
send you a replacement device, which is quite 
reasonable considering you’re getting a new 
(or ‘equivalent to new’) device. Note that even 
if you have AppleCare+ coverage, you’ll still 
have to pay the out-of-warranty fee of £556.44 
if you’ve already used up your two instances 
of accidental damage coverage, as well as a 
£7.44 shipping fee. That’s where AppleCare+’s 
two-claim limit could be an issue. If you’re 
accident prone and think you might exceed 
two damage claims, you may want third-
party insurance; we’ll discuss that shortly.
If you don’t send Apple your faulty iPhone 
within 10 business days, you’ll be charged a 
replacement fee for Apple to send you a new 
iPhone X. That’s £999 for the 64GB model, 
and £1,149 for the 256GB one. If your faulty 
phone arrives late with Apple, the company 
will remove the replacement fee but will still 
charge you a late fee of £225 for the 64GB 
iPhone X and £300 for the 256GB model. 
Apple determines that an iPhone X is late if it 
arrives between 10 and 20 business days after 
the replacement is shipped to you. That’s a 
strong incentive to send your faulty phone to 
Apple as quickly as possible – even paying a 
late fee on top of the AppleCare+ charges is 
expensive, never mind the replacement fee!
Third-party insurance
While AppleCare+ can be a whole lot cheaper 
than getting Apple to repair your iPhone X if 
you don’t have coverage, you may still be able 
to get a better deal elsewhere.
For example, we found that insurance 
Paying a late 
return fee on 
top of the 
AppleCare+ 
charges is 
expensive
You’ll gain an additional layer 
of protection if you purchase 
an iPhone X using a credit card. 
Under Section 75 of the Consumer 
Credit Act, you get free protection 
for any purchase you make with a 
credit card costing between £100 
and £30,000.
In practice, that means that if 
Apple goes bust (unlikely) or the 
iPhone X is faulty when you buy it 
or is never delivered to you, you 
can claim the full amount back 
from your credit card company.
You don’t have to have paid 
the full amount, and can still claim 
if you’re buying the iPhone with 
monthly repayments. The value 
of the item is the important thing, 
not how much you’ve paid.
You don’t get this kind of 
protection with a debit card, so it’s 
worth considering using a credit 
card when buying an iPhone X.
Finally, some premium credit 
cards offer additional protection if 
your iPhone is lost or stolen, often 
within 90 days of purchase.
Credit where credit’s due
You can even find out about your 
repair options from the support 
section on your iPhone X.

Apple repair charges without cover
firm Insurance2Go offers a specific iPhone X 
policy that costs £109.99 a year at the time 
of writing. That puts it at £219.98 for two 
years of coverage, a little over the £199 that 
AppleCare+ costs for the same length of 
time. However, for that extra £20.98 you’ll 
be covered if the phone is lost or stolen, 
and you’re covered for up to £1,000 of 
unauthorised phone calls (none of which are 
covered by AppleCare+). Accidental damage 
is also included, as it is with AppleCare+, 
except that there’s no limit on the number of 
claims you can make during your coverage 
period; AppleCare+ limits you to two claims. 
The excess fee is £50 with Insurance2Go’s 
plan – if you’ve broken the iPhone X’s screen, 
the excess with AppleCare+ is lower, but 
Insurance2Go’s excess is cheaper than the 
£79 you pay under AppleCare+ if you’ve done 
any other damage to your phone.
Ultimately, you need to decide whether the 
extra £20 (in this example) is worth the extra 
coverage. But if you’ve already shelled out a 
grand or more on a shiny new iPhone X, that 
probably doesn’t seem like very much for the 
extra peace of mind it’ll give you.
Of course, it’s not a cut-and-dried 
situation; there are other things to consider. 
Most third- party insurance companies won’t 
offer instant replacement of a broken iPhone 
X in the same way that Apple does. Mobile 
networks often do include this benefit as part 
of their own insurance packages, but at a 
steeper cost than AppleCare+; EE’s iPhone X 
insurance will set you back £288 for two 
years, for example. AppleCare+ also gets 
you priority access to Apple’s support staff, 
giving you a level of expert knowledge that 
an insurance company won’t be able to 
provide. If you want that kind of access and 
support, or simply can’t bear to be without 
an iPhone X for long after it breaks and want 
it to be replaced almost instantly, AppleCare+ 
may be the best option for you.
If you already have contents insurance, 
you should check whether you can include 
an iPhone X on your policy. If you can, that 
may simply be the best option of all.
Conclusion
Any insurance is better than no insurance, 
especially when it comes to the painfully 
expensive repair costs of the iPhone X. 
AppleCare+ offers a lot, but it may not be the 
best option if you want coverage for a lost or 
stolen phone, for example. Conversely, if you 
value getting a quick replacement for a broken 
iPhone or want to get priority access to Apple 
support, you should give it some thought. The 
worst thing you can do is not get any cover 
at all; a device as expensive as the iPhone X 
needs to be protected one way or another.

mind kicks in and thinks maybe it’s not a good 
idea to manufacture millions of adapters – 
even the plain USB-A type – that many people 
may never use, given the 12-inch MacBook’s 
one USB-C port is enough for many people.
In that regard, I’ve also been hoping for 
Apple to show real environmental courage 
and stop bundling its cabled EarPods with 
every iPhone, mostly because I never use 
them. Deduct their cost and let each of 
us choose our headphones. However, 
I expect a lot of people are pleased with 
the convenience of them being bundled. 
Also, for better or worse, the white buds 
and cables keep Apple in the minds of people 
who see them around – free advertising!

is due to space, combined with it being a 
relatively easy buying decision compared

ADApTeR ANGST
Three years ago I upgraded from a 24-inch 
iMac to a 27-inch model in order to keep up 
with developing technology. I then had to 
spend almost £100 to buy adapters as ports 
had changed from FireWire to Thunderbolt.
Late last month, I upgraded to the new 
27-inch iMac for the same reason. Once 
again, I’ve had to spend £140 on adapters, 
as ports have now changed from Thunderbolt to Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C).
Why does a company that makes more profit than entire continents’ 
GDP penalise loyal return customers with hefty charges for adapters that 
must cost very little to produce? After spending almost £2,000 on the 
iMac, this is painful. Why not include them in the box?
b y  M i c h a e l  Wa l l
AlAN SAyS… I feel your pain, Michael. When I upgraded my MacBook 
Pro, I bought adapters that would now cost £156, though I benefitted 
from Apple’s (sadly temporary) price drop on everything from its USB-A 
to USB-C adapter to LG’s Thunderbolt 3-equipped UltraFine displays.
The impact of port changes is more keenly felt this time around, at 
least on portable Macs or by users of certain types of peripheral. With 
some areas of its product line-up, Apple seems to recognise that port 
changes might be controversial to the point of being damaging. A good 
example of this is the Lightning to 3.5mm 
headphone jack adapter that’s bundled 
with the iPhone 7 or later – imagine the 
uproar if Apple had not just dropped the 
built-in jack but also made you pay for an 
adapter. It would be a welcome gesture of 
goodwill if Apple were to include even one 
USB-C adapter – the plain USB-A one – with 
every MacBook Pro, for example, to ensure 
you’re not left high and dry if you decline/
forget/are unaware you might need to buy 
one when you purchase a new Mac. 
As much as its stings, though, I can see 
the logic on Apple’s part in not doing this 
for Thunderbolt 1 or 2; devices that use the 
older Thunderbolt standards are relatively 
niche, and used by a small proportion of 
Mac users. The cynical part of me can see 
that this is an opportunity for Apple to 
make even more money on adapters. Then

Confusion Drive
 I have been a subscriber to your excellent 
magazine for years, and give old copies to 
my local dental surgery. The February 2016 
issue [#296] contained a Make Your Own 
Fusion Drive article. I kept a photocopy of 
the article, but on reading to the end, it 
closes with ‘you’re now ready to build your 
Fusion Drive’. This implies that the second 
part of the process would be in the 
following issue. Please would you tell me 
how I can obtain a copy of this second part? 
b y  J a c k  S i v e W r i g h t
JO SAyS… Wow, we’re delighted to know 
that article is proving useful to long-term 
readers. Maybe it’s due for a re-run for 
newer readers in need of a relatively 
inexpensive way to keep an older Mac 
in service, given that recent versions of 
macOS work on pretty old hardware.
Jack, unfortunately, you haven’t 
archived the whole article – it should be 
four pages long, the last page containing 
the six steps that combine your SSD and 
hard drive into a Fusion Drive. No worries, 
though – we’ll sort you out with the 
missing content this time around.
As we’ve had other positive feedback 
about the Fusion Drive project, we’ll look 
at running an updated version soon. 
Meanwhile, if you’re in need of a back 
issue, turn to page 82 to find out how 
to order printed or digital versions.
 If your Mac has Thunderbolt or USB 3, 
you have a really easy upgrade route, as 
long as you don’t mind an external box 
running off it. If the fastest connection 
available to you is an internal bay, you may 
prefer to replace the internal hard drive 
with a larger SSD. The process is trickier 
and riskier, requiring a guide for your 
specific model (search iFixit.com) and 
a suitably safe workspace.

a straightforward case of that being your 
best option if your current equipment is 
ready for it, or if you plan to upgrade to 
a 4K television any time soon.

 I have a 2015 MacBook Pro and I use it mainly 
for video editing. Since updating my Mac to 
High Sierra, it runs at a very slow pace. Videos 
used to play instantly. Not now. I could go and 
make a cup of tea it takes so long! I would like 
to back track to Sierra again. I hope there 
is another update to rectify this.
b y  t o n y  S
pAul SAyS… Anecdotally, High Sierra 
certainly seems to have produced more than 
its fair share of negative feedback. Though 
we haven’t encountered anything as serious 
as your problem on the Macs here, none of 
the MacFormat team has needed to work on 
any video projects in the last few months. 
If this is crippling, macOS Recovery and Time 
Machine can get you back to an older system.
If you have a peculiar problem with High 
Sierra that you’re unable to fix for yourself, 
remember that you can contact Howard 
Oakley on genius@macformat.com, who’ll try 
to advise on ways to investigate the problem 
further, if not provide an outright solution.

hard drive? USB 3 on recent models

MATT BOLTON…
After a 2016 quieter than a product launch at a BlackBerry 
store, 2017 was really strong for Apple, especially when it came 
to hardware. However, software was a little less strong across 
the board, so here’s what I’m hoping to see from Apple in 2018.
First up is a smarter Siri. One of the few stumbles for Apple 
this year was HomePod slipping into 2018, but I think Apple 
should take its time to get it right at launch, and maybe look to 
re-announce it at an event in March, alongside expanded Siri  
capabilities. Siri works well for key stuff  like  understanding 
what you’re saying, but compared to Google Assistant or 
Amazon Alexa, what it can actually 
do is pretty limited. Expansions 
through SiriKit in iOS 10 were a 
sign of exciting things to come… 
except they didn’t come, at least not 
with iOS 11. Perhaps HomePod will 
be able to access more types of 
knowledge at first, and then maybe 
in iOS 12, we’ll get something more 
next-generation for Siri overall.
A real software low point this year was tvOS, with zero 
interesting changes. In the UK, the best thing Apple could do is 
get more catch-up services on tvOS and get them working with 
Siri, but even beyond that, apps on it feel like they’ve stalled. 
Adding options like Picture in Picture or Slide Over so you can 
view Twitter’s reactions right alongside Strictly are obvious 
next steps, but I’m not sure these would actually make anything 
better, or that I’d ever use them. I hope Apple focuses more 
towards the video side, making that work worldwide, maybe 
with recommendations and other ways to find new shows.
High Sierra also failed to excite, despite adding a new file 
system (that sounds like it’s sarcasm, but I’m sorry to say that it 
isn’t). I’m not sure we’ll see a big change to the desktop concept 
this year, but I think it could benefit a lot from more of iOS’s 
predictive options. Suggesting apps and documents based on 
behaviour or whether they’re named in messages (a bit like 
how dates get picked out for entering calendar appointments 
now) could be great. The Mac App Store also needs a complete 
overhaul, and hopefully we’ll see that – but it has to be about 
more than just a smart new design for users. The store needs 
updating at a fundamental level for developers, with more 
flexible options for the apps 
themselves, otherwise a new 
coat of paint won’t make any 
major difference.
APPLE CORE Opinion
The iPhone’s multitasking hasn’t 
really changed in years, but what 
we do on phone has gotten more 
intense, so we need more flexibility.
If HomePod is going to stand out in the suddenly-
very-crowded smart speaker market, Siri’s going 
to need to get a lot smarter, and quickly.

And then there’s iOS. The iPad had a 
fantastic year, but it felt kind of light on the 
phone side. I think we can hope for similar 
productivity boosts to iPad for iPhone in 
iOS 12. Multitasking should be a lot smarter, 
so I think a Dock and new app switcher 
screen is likely. And with the new taller 
iPhone X screen as standard, I’d love to see a 
Picture in Picture video mode where the top 
of the screen stays playing video, while you 
use apps in the bottom two-thirds. I’m not 
convinced about split-screen apps overall, but 
when I’m travelling for work, still juggling 
multiple tasks, my iPhone may be my only 
computer, and I know it could do that better.

Which Apple 
Watch is best?
 The Apple Watch 
Series 1 is still available, 
from £249, and includes 
a heart rate sensor and 
accelerometer for 
tracking speed and 
distance when you’re 
exercising outdoors. 
The new Series 3, from 
£329, is water resistant 
for swimming, includes 
GPS and an altimeter.
Do I need GymKit?
 If you exercise 
outdoors, you can use 
your iPhone or Apple 
Watch to track your 
speed, distance covered, 
and calories burned. 
But you don’t actually 
move off the spot when 
you’re using a treadmill 
or cycling machine in 
a gym; GymKit can 
record data directly 
from the exercise 
machine then transfer 
it to the Apple Watch.
he gym is the first port of call 
for most people who want to 
improve their fitness, and apple 
recently unveiled big plans to 
get into the gym business. But rather than 
opening a chain of elegantly designed gyms, 
Apple came up with GymKit, a new piece of 
software that is included in watchOS 4. GymKit 
allows treadmills, rowing machines and other 
types of fitness equipment to record data 
about your workout, such as distance, speed, 
and calories burned, and transmit that data 
directly to your Apple Watch.
Of course, an iPhone or Apple Watch can 
already monitor how far or fast you run when 
you’re jogging or cycling around the park, but 
they’re less useful if you’re simply running on 
the spot on a machine in the gym. But a running 
machine that works with GymKit can use an 
NFC chip (near-field communication) to record 
the details of your workout in precise detail, 
and then simply push that data over onto 
your Apple Watch.
Apple has announced that it is working with 
all the main manufacturers of gym equipment 
to add GymKit support to their products, 
including LifeFitness, StairMaster, and Nautilus, 
and some of them have even promised to 
release their first GymKit-compatible machines 
by the end of this year. However, most gyms 
tend to update their equipment every two 
T
or three years, so it could take a while for 
Apple’s new tech to reach UK high streets.
Work it out
If you want to get started a little sooner then 
there are still plenty of options available for 
taking your training to the next level. 
The Apple Watch does include both heart 
rate and motion sensors, but it’s something of 
a jack-of-all-trades device, so for many sports 
a more specialised heart sensor can be useful 
(or just cheaper than buying an Apple Watch). 
Wahoo is perhaps the most well known name 
here, as its Tickr range of sensors is sold in  
Apple Stores. The basic Tickr model starts 
at just £40, and provides precise, real-time 
monitoring of your heart rate and calorie 
consumption. For more detailed monitoring 
there’s the Tickr X for £65, which includes 
additional sensors for running and other 
sports, as well as a special ‘treadmill’ mode 
so that you can use it in the gym as well as 
running outdoors.
Other affordable sports tech that comes 
in for less than £100 includes devices such 
as the Tangram range of smart skipping ropes 
(or ‘jump ropes’ if you prefer a less childish 
term). The Smart Rope Pure starts at £60, and 
includes magnetic sensors that can monitor 
your jump rate and calorie consumption, and 
its Smart Gym app for iOS and Apple Watch 
training

 As well as Bluetooth and 
NFC, many fitness devices 
use another wireless tech 
called Ant+. This was 
originally developed by 
Garmin for its own range 
of fitbands, but has since 
been adopted by Wahoo 
and several other fitness 
companies.

Do gyms really 
need GymKit?
  It might take a while for 
new GymKit-compatible 
equipment to arrive in 
your local gym. However, 
many exercise machines 
already include Bluetooth 
connectivity or NFC 
chips, which allow them 
to communicate with 
the manufacturer’s 
own apps on iOS and 
Android devices.
What about 
fitness trackers?
  Apple Watch includes 
dozens of features that 
have little to do with health 
or fitness. If all you want 
is a basic fitband that can 
monitor speed, distance 
and heart rate, there are 
many cheaper alternatives. 
One of our favourites is the 
Misfit Ray, which starts at 
just £36 and looks like 
a friendship bracelet. 
It doesn’t have a screen, 
but can use Bluetooth to 
send data to your iPhone 
when you get back home.
With clever tech and 
LEDs displaying your 
data, Tangram has 
changed the face of the 
lowly old skipping rope.
Concept2 can help track 
rowing, cycling and skiing 
with a wide variety of 
gym-style machines.
allows you to program interval training 
routines and other types of workout. You can 
also buy the Smart Rope LED for £80, which 
has a series of LEDs embedded in the rope, 
which create a lingering after-image that 
displays your workout data hovering in mid-air 
as the rope spins round and round. 
We’re also fans of the Zepp range of sports 
sensors. Some of these – such as the tennis 
and golf sensors – focus more on technique, 
helping you to improve the accuracy and 
precision of your game, but Zepp also makes 
a football sensor for £100 that you can wear 
inside a special calf sleeve. This monitors your 
performance during a match, and can record 
data such as your sprinting speed, kick speed, 
and the distance covered during a match to 
see if your fitness is up to scratch.
Bicycle race
If you’re willing to spend a bit more money, 
you can buy your own rowing machine or 
cycling machine for use at home. Concept2 
is one of the main manufacturers in this field, 
and its range of rowing machines, cycling and 
‘ski-erg’ machines are great for working on 
general cardio fitness. They’re a bit pricey, with 
its Model D rowing machine starting at around 
£860, and £1,188 for the 
BikeErg cycling machine, 
but Concept2’s products are used in a lot of 
gyms as well, and there’s a small industry of 
third-party apps that work with the company’s 
fitness equipment. This data can be fed into 
Apple’s Activity and Health apps, of course.
A less expensive option for use at home 
is a ‘trainer’ – a special stand that you can use 
to convert an ordinary bike into a stationary 
exercise machine, complete with Bluetooth 
connectivity for your iPhone. 
Along with its Tickr heart sensors, Wahoo 
makes a number of Kickr trainers, starting at 
£500 for the Kickr Snap. For an additional 
£500 you can buy the Kickr Climb, an add-on 
for the Snap that raises and lowers the front of 
the bike to simulate hill climbs. The company 
even makes a range of accessories for its 
fitness gear, such as a ‘desk’ stand you can 
place in front of your bike so that you can 
do some work on your laptop while you’re 
exercising on your bike. And if that’s too 
expensive for you, both Wahoo and Garmin 
have a range of affordable ‘bike computers’, 
starting at less than £100, that turn your old 
rust bucket into a high-tech smart bike with 
GPS and other fitness features.

Work faster  
and smarter, 
and boost  
your Mac’s 
performance
RN!
Written by Craig Grannell  >
Y
ou may at times feel your 
Mac experience is akin to 
squelching through a bog. 
And the thing is, although 
ageing hardware can cause 
problems, the way you use your Mac is 
often just as much to blame. The reality 
is that, over time, your Mac accumulates 
all kinds of cruft, which slows everything 
down; moreover, your own workflows 
and habits may have ingrained in you 
inefficient ways of working.
This feature is all about giving 
you a new Mac. Not in a literal sense –  
MacFormat’s budget sadly doesn’t 
stretch to taping a free MacBook to 
every magazine. What we mean is that 
we’ll outline all kinds of ways to boost the 
effectiveness of your Mac, and thereby 
also your productivity.
Hardware will be covered, but the 
reality is that the vast majority of Macs in 
recent years are essentially sealed boxes. 
The days are long gone when you could 
safely crack open a Mac, replace a bunch 
of its internal components, and end up with 
a sort-of-new, screamingly-fast computer. 
Mostly, then, we’re looking at everything 
else: ways in which you can ‘think different’ 
about how you use apps; new methods for 
interacting with your Mac – and how to be 
more effective when doing so; user-friendly 
methods of automating certain processes, 
and recommendations for moving key data 
and your workflow to the cloud.
Take on board our advice and, even 
though your Mac itself may remain broadly 
unchanged, it will nonetheless feel like 
it’s been reborn, as you head towards a 
smarter, faster, more productive future.

Optimise your Mac
Whether you’re using a keyboard, mouse or trackpad,  
there are ways to speed up working with your Mac
 1
Adjust your 
keyboard
In System Preferences, the 
Keyboard pane has options 
for fine-tuning how your 
keyboard works with your 
Mac, including defining new 
keyboard shortcuts, and 
creating text replacements.
 2
Explore your 
mouse options
Whatever mouse you’re 
currently using, the Mouse 
pane provides settings to 
change how it works. Tracking 
speed is perhaps the most 
important – ramp it up to 
the maximum you feel 
comfortable with.
 3
Understand 
your trackpad
The Trackpad pane offers 
three tabs full of options. 
Again, tracking speed is worth 
increasing, but also turn on 
‘Tap to click’, so you tap lightly 
to select items on your Mac, 
rather than having to press.
 4
Use Spotlight
Sure, you can launch 
apps on your Mac by clicking 
icons in the Applications folder 
or Dock. But it’s often faster to 
press ç+[Space] to fire up 
Spotlight, type a few letters, 
and use the arrow keys and 
® to open what’s selected.
 5
Power up with  
BetterTouchTool
BetterTouchTool (from £4, 
boastr.net) is a single utility 
designed to enhance all of 
your input devices. Using this 
app, you can define all manner 
of triggers to perform your 
choice of actions.
 6  
Get advanced 
trackpad gestures
Your Mac’s Magic Mouse or 
trackpad understands many 
more gestures than System 
Preferences provides options 
for. With BetterTouchTool, 
you can create gestures that 
use up to five fingers or a firm 
press on a trackpad corner.

How to: Define a custom keyboard shortcut >
JANUARY 2018 | MACFORMAT | 31
1
Type accented letters
For fast access to accented letters, 
hold a letter key down to see a pop-up 
menu; press a number key to select the 
character in the corresponding position. 
Or, learn specific shortcuts in Keyboard 
Viewer (activated in the Keyboard tab of 
System Preferences’ Keyboard pane).
2
Keyboard access to 
menu commands
To access a menu command without 
navigating menus, press ç+ß+/ 
to bring up Help, and start typing 
the command’s name. Use the arrow 
keys to navigate the menu and ® to 
confirm. This is also great when you know 
the name of a command but don’t recall 
its whereabouts in an app’s menus.
3
Use Hot Corners
In the Mission Control pane of 
System Preferences, click Hot Corners. 
In the sheet that then appears, define 
what you want to happen when you move 
the mouse cursor into each corner. This 
can be a lightning fast way to trigger 
your screen saver.
4
Invest in a decent 
window manager
Don’t waste time precisely positioning 
windows – get a window manager to do it! 
BetterTouchTool offers options for this, 
but Moom ($10, manytricks.com) is 
better. Have it instantly snap a window to 
a user-defined area by using a keyboard 
shortcut or gesture, or by dragging out 
the desired position on the screen.
5
Open apps from 
the keyboard
BetterTouchTool enables you to set 
keyboard shortcuts to instantly open 
favourite apps or folders. The action to 
use is Open Application/File/AppleScript. 
Shortcuts that involve ≈+ß+[letter] 
won’t clash with anything else.
6
Ditch your mouse
Mice are a dated input device, and 
poor ergonomically. Consider a trackpad 
so you can use gestures, or a pen-based 
tablet on which the surface is mapped to 
corresponding points on your display – 
then you can jump to a position by lifting 
the stylus and setting it down elsewhere.
The ultimate refresh MAC REBORN
 macformat.com  @macformat
2
Create a new shortcut
In System Preferences > Keyboard > 
Shortcuts > App Shortcuts, click the + 
button just below the right-hand pane. 
Select an app from the Application menu 
(or All Applications if you want the 
shortcut to be available everywhere.)
1
Find a shortcut
Keyboard shortcuts are a great way to 
speed up workflow on your Mac – it’s far 
easier to prod a couple of keys than to 
move the pointer to a menu item. But 
some items don’t have shortcuts, such 
as File > Export as PDF… in TextEdit.
3
Define a shortcut 
Next to Menu Title, type the menu 
command exactly (including ellipses – 
å+;). Click inside Keyboard Shortcut 
and press your desired key combination. 
Choose something that doesn’t clash with 
existing ones. Click Add. Now try it out.
Power up your 
Mac’s input devices
Saying ‘Hey Siri’ 
works for your 
iPhone and iPad. 
A workaround 
can add it to your Mac, too. 
In Siri’s System Preferences 
pane, select Customise in the  
Keyboard Shortcut pop-up 
menu, and use å+[Space]. 
(This differs from the similar 
predefined shortcut in the 
pop-up, which requires you to 
hold those keys, not just press 
them.) In the Keyboard pane’s 
Dictation tab, turn on enhanced 
dictation. (This may require a 
400MB download.)
Go to the Accessibility 
preferences pane, select 
Dictation on the left, and define 
‘Hey’ as the dictation keyword 
phrase. Click the Dictation 
Commands button, tick Enable 
advanced commands, and click 
+ to create a new command. In 
‘When I say’, type ‘Siri’, and set 
Perform to Press Keyboard 
Shortcut. Repeat the keyboard 
shortcut from earlier. Click 
Done. Hey, Siri! is now all set.
Hey, Siri!

Start using 
Smart Folders
In Finder, you can create 
Smart Folders, which are 
automatically filled with items 
that match your specified 
criteria. The contents could 
be anything from recently 
saved JPEGs to all items that 
you’ve tagged with a red label.
 2
Smart Playlists
Smart Playlists in 
iTunes provide the means to 
create collections of music 
that continually adapt. For 
example, you might create 
one for recent additions you 
haven’t played at all, or stuff 
you’ve told the app you love 
yet haven’t played for months.
 3
Smart Mailboxes
By default, Mail gives 
you a sole Smart Mailbox: 
Today. This contains all the 
messages that arrived today 
from all your accounts. But as 
you’ll see in our tips, you can 
create more useful mailboxes.
 4
Understand rules
The make-up of smart 
containers varies slightly from 
app to app, but the foundation 
is always rules/conditions. 
Figure out in plain English 
what you want items to match, 
and then set about defining 
that using the menu options.
 5
Text replacement
If you’re always mis-
typing something, familiarise 
yourself with the Text tab in 
System Preferences’ Keyboard 
pane. There you’ll find a table 
in which to specify text you 
want to replace with longer 
phrases, plus system-wide 
settings for shortcuts such as 
turning straight quotes curly.
 6
Automate tasks
Automator is used to 
build workflows that perform 
tasks on your behalf. In the 
hands of a programmer, it’s a 
hugely powerful facility, but 
the drag-and-drop system’s 
suitable even for beginners.

JANUARY 2018 | MACFORMAT | 33
1
Create multi-line 
text replacements
In the Text tab of System Preferences’ 
Keyboard pane, you can set short phrases 
that you want to be replaced with longer 
blocks of text. This is great for accessing 
extended characters, and you can also 
paste multi-line text that you’ve written 
in TextEdit into the With column – ideal 
for boilerplate replies to emails!
2
Automate quitting 
every app
If you often have many apps open, 
you can quickly close them all using 
an app built in Automator that contains 
the Quit All Applications action. Choose 
whether apps ask to save changes; you 
can also remove specific apps from the 
action, so they remain open.
3
Scale images 
with Automator
Automator can resize images. With the 
Scale Images action, set the number of 
pixels for each one’s long side. The app will 
offer to add a Copy Finder action to retain 
the originals, rather than replace them.
4
Make an ‘urgent’ 
Smart Mailbox
It’s easy for email to get lost in amongst 
the many items in your inbox. Create 
a Smart Mailbox with the conditions 
‘Message is in Mailbox Inbox’ and ‘Date 
received is not in the last 7 days’. This 
will contain email that arrived over a 
week ago – which needs dealing with.
5
Create an 
‘unread’ Mailbox
On iOS, Apple provides a handy Unread 
folder for unread emails across all your 
accounts. Create a Smart Mailbox on 
your Mac to do the same. Simply add a 
‘Message is unread’ condition; optionally, 
add a ‘Message is not in mailbox Junk’ 
condition to omit junk mail.
6
Rotate iTunes tracks 
In iTunes, create a Smart Playlist 
with the rule ‘Last Played not in the last 
30 days’. Add a ‘Media Kind is Music’ rule. 
The playlist will include tracks you’ve not 
heard during the past month. You can 
then refine this as necessary with ratings 
and artist information.

Create your workflow
On the return input line, replace input 
with: "https://duckduckgo.com/?q=" 
& (input as string). This sends the 
selected text to DuckDuckGo. Add Display 
Webpages beneath the Run AppleScript 
action. This opens the result in Safari.
1
Set things up
You can select text and run a Google 
search on it from the ≈-click contextual 
menu, but let’s make a service that uses 
DuckDuckGo. Create a new Service, and 
drag Run AppleScript to the right pane. 
A basic script structure will be added. 
3
Save and use
Save the service as Search with 
DuckDuckGo. It can now be selected from 
the Services menu when text is selected in 
an app. In System Preferences > Keyboard 
> Shortcuts, create a shortcut for instant 
access to the service.
Automate more 
stuff on your Mac
For anyone who 
downloads and 
works with a lot 
of files, Mac 
housekeeping can feel like 
endless tedium. Hazel ($32 – 
about £24, noodlesoft.com) 
is designed to toil on your 
behalf. Setting it up involves 
you identifying specific folders, 
and then creating rules to 
process files in those folders 
based on conditions that files 
must match.
Hazel works in a similar 
manner to Smart Folders. 
So you can, for instance, 
have Hazel examine your  
Downloads folder and send 
any music it finds to iTunes, 
PDFs to ~/Documents/PDFs, 
and images to Photos. With 
a system like this in place, 
anything still lurking in 
Downloads can then be safely 
trashed – and Hazel will even 
empty the Trash on a regular 
basis, saving you the bother 
of doing so yourself.

Live in the 
Hurl your Mac and every other device into  
the future by fully embracing the cloud
1
Use iCloud
Make any Mac feel 
reborn by embracing iCloud. 
When you fully utilise iCloud, 
important data is instantly 
available on any of your 
Macs – no more half-finished 
bits and bobs scattered 
across multiple computers.
2 Share folders
In iCloud Drive’s options, 
you can choose to store your 
Desktop and Documents 
folders online. Files in them 
then sync across Macs signed 
into your Apple ID, and are 
available on iOS devices too.
3 Sync Safari across 
your devices
When using iCloud across your 
various Macs and iOS devices, 
you can view a list of Safari 
tabs left open on them from 
any one device. Bookmarks 
and your browsing history 
sync across them too. Turn on 
iCloud Keychain to sync site 
logins and payment details.
4 Optimise photos
If you’re a keen 
photographer, consider 
storing all your photos and 
videos in iCloud. On doing so, 
even edits become available 
on all your devices – and your 
Mac will only download 
originals when there’s space.
5 Use Google Drive
Google Drive gives you 
15GB of online storage for 
free. With Google’s Backup 
and Sync app, you can 
integrate Google Drive into 
Finder to access your Google 
Docs, and also sync specific 
folders for online back-up.
6 Check out 
Dropbox
Dropbox only offers 2GB for 
free, but has very widespread 
support in apps across all 
platforms. You can selectively 
sync, too, which makes it 
suitable for use as an online-
only locker for files you’re 
currently working on.

When you place the pointer over your 
list, a button appears to the right. Click it

they must have an iCloud account.)
1
Create a list
Make your Mac work for you by using 
it to create lists you can access on all your 
devices – and share with other people, too! 
Open Reminders and click Add List. Name 
your new list – ‘To-do list’ or similar – and 
drag it where you want it in the left pane.
3
Use your list
Both parties can now use the list, 
which will be updated and synchronised 
across all of their devices. To stop sharing 
a list with someone, select their name in 
the pop-up menu and press the ∫ key. 
You cannot undo this action.
Refresh your Mac 
by using the cloud
The ultimate refresh MAC REBORN
So you’re the type 
of person who 
enjoys having great 
sounds pumped 
into your ears at all times. But 
large music collections take up 
space on your Mac, and aren’t 
particularly portable – at least 
not without faffing about 
synchronising tracks – which 
then eat into the limited storage 
on iPhones and iPads.
If you’re going all-in with 
the cloud to revitalise your 
Mac experience, consider a 
music-streaming service. 
Apple Music will integrate 
with an existing collection in 
iTunes and works across 
macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS, 
iTunes for Windows and even 
Android, but other services 
are pretty great too, including 
those from Spotify, Amazon 
and Google.
Stream all 
your music
1
Optimise Mac storage
The days of new Macs having way 
more storage than their predecessors 
are over – a problem if you have a lot of 
media. iCloud Drive provides a solution: 
in System Preferences > iCloud, click 
on iCloud Drive’s Options button and 
turn on Optimise Mac Storage. Older 
documents are offloaded to iCloud 
when storage space is needed.
2
Go online for your 
office tasks
Apple now offers online versions of 
its office-oriented apps like Pages and 
Numbers, but Google’s online suite 
remains the industry leader. Consider 
using Docs (word processing) and 
Sheets (spreadsheets) if you want fast 
access to your work on any platform, 
and to very easily collaborate live with 
your friends and colleagues.
3
Share screenshots 
with Dropbox
Need a more optimal way to share 
your screenshots? Take a look in 
Dropbox’s Import preferences and 
tick ‘Share screenshots using Dropbox’. 
Grabs taken on your Mac in the normal 
manner will then instantly be moved 
to your Dropbox folder, and you can 
then share links to them with people.
4
Be wary of operating 
system differences
When using Apple’s cloud services, 
be mindful that certain features may 
require a specific system. For example, 
pinning and tables in Notes are part of 
iOS 11 and macOS High Sierra. Pinning 
doesn’t happen in earlier systems, 
and tables aren’t shown at all.
5
Easy access on 
your iOS devices
When using iCloud Drive and storing 
your Desktop and Documents folders 
there, a major advantage in terms of 
speeding up your workflow is the 
ability to access these folders 
on your iOS devices. Open the Files 
app and you’ll find those folders in 
the top level of iCloud Drive. It’s worth 
noting that iOS devices only download 
files on demand, not by default.

your user folder, if it exists, 
in case you’ve installed some 
apps specifically to your user

sluggish or locks up, open 
Activity Monitor and keep an 
eye on the CPU and Memory 
tabs. If specific apps are 
putting too much load on 
your Mac, start considering 
alternatives to use instead.

How to: Work with Activity Monitor >
JANUARY 2018 | MACFORMAT | 37
1
Use appropriate apps 
for the task in hand
Suitability is an important consideration 
when it comes to app usage. Think of what 
you’re trying to achieve, and then the best 
way of going about that. Don’t just shove 
everything into Pages, for example – use 
Reminders for lists, Numbers for tabular 
data, and Notes for gathering research.
2
Learn about processes 
to fix issues
If you’re not sure what a process does, use 
Google or similar to look it up and find out. 
Sometimes, you’ll find quitting processes 
rather than apps in Activity Monitor can 
fix issues – such as killing Photos Agent to 
get a stalled Photo Stream working again.
3
Reconsider Apple’s 
default apps
Some Mac users merrily install tons of 
apps. Every time something new and shiny 
appears, it’s instantly downloaded. But it 
pays to look again at what Apple provides. 
Many of the company’s own apps are 
powerful, and work very well with iCloud.
4
Find more efficient 
alternatives
If you use only a fraction of an app’s 
capabilities, you might instead go for 
something simpler. Only care about words, 
rather than page layout? Consider iA 
Writer over Word or Pages. Only do basic 
image editing? Photos can do that – you 
don’t need Photoshop or Affinity Photo.
5
Offload installers 
to external storage
When you download new apps outside 
of the Mac App Store, you likely get an 
installer dumped in Downloads. You’re 
free to offload installers to external 
storage, and you don’t need them on 
your Mac – they’re just clutter that takes 
up space. If you have macOS installers in 
Applications, they’re a huge waste.
6
Prune your menu bar
Some apps place status icons in 
the menu bar. That area can fast become 
crowded and make items designed for 
quick access hard to find. Disable any you 
don’t use – look in their apps’ preferences.

2
View memory usage
Use the Memory tab in a similar 
fashion. Click the Memory header to list 
running processes by memory usage. 
Sometimes you’ll find individual Safari 
tabs cause memory pressure problems. A 
quit and restart of the browser can fix this.
1
Check CPU usage
Open Activity Monitor (found in the 
Utilities folder), and click the CPU tab. 
Click the % CPU header and also choose 
View > My Processes. Your account’s 
processes will be listed by CPU usage. 
Note down any that overload your Mac.
3
Quit unruly apps
Unresponsive apps are displayed in 
red, and you may need to force them to 
quit. You can kill any process from Activity 
Monitor by selecting it, clicking the close 
button (the x at the top left), and choosing 
Quit – or, if necessary, Force Quit.
Tips for being 
app-happy
If you have an 
iOS device, you 
may have noticed 
a large number 
of apps and games stopped 
working with iOS 11. That’s 
because Apple’s newest mobile 
operating system nixed support 
for 32-bit apps. The Mac hasn’t 
killed off such apps yet, but 
Apple has announced the 
process will begin in 2018, 
whereupon all Mac App Store 
apps will have to be 64-bit.
To find out what 32-bit 
apps you’re running, start by 
choosing  > About This Mac. 
Click System Report to open 
the System Information utility. 
In that app, select Applications 
(under Software in the left 
pane). Finally, click the 64-bit 
column header to separate 
32-bit and 64-bit apps in the list. 
Don’t trash 32-bit apps just yet, 
but keep an eye out for updates 
(or 64-bit alternatives if the app 
in question hasn’t been updated 
in a number of years).
Prep for 
64-bit

Find out about 
your Mac
In the  menu, choose About 
This Mac. This is the central 
area for finding out more 
about your Mac, including 
details about the model such 
as its graphics processor, 
connected displays, and 
installed memory and storage.
 2
View storage
Select the Storage tab 
and you get an overview of all 
connected disks. Used storage 
is broken down into categories, 
so you can check out whether 
your Mac’s drives are clogged 
up with photos, apps, or other 
types of data.
 3
Get your Mac’s 
model number
When you want to know about 
upgrading a Mac, you’ll need 
to know its specific model 
type. This is displayed in the 
Overview tab of About My 
Mac, which details the Mac’s 
release year and display size.
 4
Check out the 
fine details
Under Overview, click System 
Report. This opens the System 
Information utility, which gives 
you a more detailed look at 
what’s inside your Mac. Select 
any category from the sidebar 
to learn more about it.
 5
Print a report
Should you need to 
provide some of your Mac’s 
details to a store or repair 
centre, use File > Print to take 
a copy of the selected 
category’s details. As always 
in macOS, you can print to a 
PDF to get a digital copy.

Choose Window > Storage 
Management to open a list 
of recommendations. Here, 
you’ll see whether you have 
options to offload data to the

may have a positive impact on 
your storage upgrade needs.

Upgrade your  
Mac’s RAM
Most modern Macs are sealed, but 27-inch 
iMacs still have upgradable memory, as 
do many older models. Go to  > About 
This Mac > Overview to find out what your 
specific Mac model is. The Memory tab 
details installed memory, and provides 
a button to Apple’s upgrade instructions. 
If you can add memory, it’s worth doing.
2
Get an SSD to 
speed things up
If your Mac still has a hard drive rattling 
around inside it, consider upgrading to 
an SSD. You’ll find that Information will 
be accessed far more rapidly, greatly 
speeding up everything from startup 
to opening apps. You may be able to 
upgrade older Macs yourself; if concerned, 
find an Apple repair expert to assist.
3
Trash redundant files
Even if you don’t swap out your 
Mac’s internal drive, there are things 
you can do to make it feel reborn. For 
example, wheel out GrandPerspective 
again, search for redundant files, and 
trash them. This alone can speed up 
a Mac if its startup disk is getting full.
4
Use external drives
Should you not be keen on deleting 
a bunch of files, even if you no longer 
actively use them, offload them to an 
external hard drive. If the documents 
are of importance, make sure you have 
at least two backups of them.
5
Improve your Wi-Fi
If your main Mac problem is internet 
connectivity being sluggish, consider 
three things: upgrade to fibre broadband 
if it’s available; get better hardware (free 
routers are often relatively poor); and look 
at Wi-Fi extenders for buildings where the 
signal can’t get through loads of walls.
6
Get a USB hub
Simple, cheap ‘upgrades’ can often 
make a big difference. If you have an iMac 
and are sick of disconnecting and plugging 
in USB devices, grab a USB hub. Boom: 
instant access to a ton of ports.

Activate Duet DIsplay
In the Security & Privacy pane of 
System Preferences, select Privacy and 
then Accessibility. Unlock the pane (you’ll 
need an admin password), and tick Duet. 
You’ll now need to restart your Mac, after 
which Duet will be in the menu bar.

Install Duet Display
If you have an iPad hanging around 
doing nothing when you’re using your 
Mac, turn it into a second display. Go to 
duetdisplay.com and click Download Mac. 
Find the file in Downloads and go through 
the steps to install the helper tool.
3
Connect your iPad
Install Duet Display (£14.99, App 
Store) on your iPad, open the app, and 
then connect your iPad to your Mac with 
a Lightning cable. Use Duet’s settings to 
adjust resolution and quality. You can 
also enable a virtual Touch Bar.
Power up your Mac 
with new hardware
Increasingly, people use 
notebooks rather than desktop 
computers. They’re great for 
portability, but not for your 
back, given that you typically 
type while hunched over the 
keyboard. Poor ergonomics 
shouldn’t be ignored – back 
complaints are a major problem 
for computer users.
If you have the space and 
funds, look at getting yourself 
an external display, and connect 
a wireless Apple keyboard and 
trackpad to your notebook. 
You’ll have more screen space 
in which to work, and a more 
natural setup for typing and 
interacting with your Mac. 
Your Mac hardware won’t 
necessarily feel reborn as a 
consequence of such changes – 
but you may well do.

Use the Camera Raw filter
Press ß+ç+A to open the Camera Raw filter, which has 
a very powerful healing tool. Press B to select it, and use the

The Healing Brush tool is for removing incidental blemishes –

 An imperfect image, 
Photoshop CC
unfortunately, not every

often unwanted elements 
make their way into even the 
most carefully considered compositions. 
And that’s before you consider the unwanted 
intrusion of dust spots.
Photoshop CC 2018 (and earlier versions) 
offers a wealth of tools when it comes to 
cleaning up images. Being able to heal dust 
spots, clone out bigger intrusions, and select 
and mask areas of an image so you can drop in 
entirely new elements is fantastically handy. 
Accidentally caught an awkward-looking 
passer-by in the frame? A few minutes’ work 
and you can get shot of them completely.

 Easy does it. Avoid

changes in an attempt 
to get the job done 
sooner: poor-quality 
cloning is very easy 
to spot, particularly 
in printed images.

 The Clone Source 
panel allows you to set 
up to five sources to 
clone from, as well as 
being able to rotate or 
offset your samples. 
You can set clone 
sources from any layer

Be precise
If Photoshop heals over a spot and you don’t like the result, 
press ç+Z to undo it. Alternatively, drag the green dashed 
circle somewhere else on the image to change where Photoshop 
takes its sample from. Press V to hide these dashed circles.

Close up and personal
Press å+ç+0 (zero) to view your image at 100% – this 
will allow you to discern much smaller spots. Press h to switch 
from the Healing Brush to the Hand tool, and drag around your 
image so you can check the whole thing over.

Turn it into a selection
Open the Paths panel (Window > Paths). In it, ç-click the 
path you just made to convert it to a marquee selection. Now 
any Clone Stamp alterations you make will be restricted to the 
marquee and you won’t risk changing other parts of your image.

Clone wars
With an appropriate area selected, click and drag over the 
area you want to replace. We’re working on the skirting board 
first, being careful to sample directly from the horizontal line 
between the skirting board and the floorboard so it matches.
6
Remove bigger objects
This image, illustrating a projector running a video game, 
is a work in progress – the cables straggling away from the unit 
are a real distraction. They’re too big to use the Healing Brush 
tool, so the Clone Stamp tool is best.
9
Mark the area to edit
With the skirting and floor sorted out, we need to get the 
fine detail around the table’s edge sorted. It’s awkwardly on the 
side of the table, so to avoid cloning the table unnecessarily, 
we’ve used the Path tool to outline the edge of the table.
7
Set sample area
With the area to work on enlarged, press S to select the 
Clone Stamp tool. Photoshop then copies directly from one area 
of the image over that which you want removed. Hold å, then 
click in the area you want to sample from.
5
Visualise spots
Press Y to visualise the spots in your image. This high-
contrast view of your image visualises spots as bright white 
specks, allowing you to quickly identify and sort them. It’s worth 
frequently switching this view on and off to do the best job.

 iTunes and an 
admin password 
so Automator 
can do its thing
Automator must envy Siri. 
While Apple’s digital assistant 
hogs all the headlines, 
Automator just gets on with 
the job of automating things on your Mac 
and gets hardly any credit. It’s an incredibly 
powerful app, and it’s nowhere near as 
frightening as it looks.
Automator’s job is to take care of common 
tasks for you. It’s effectively a programming 
tool, but once you’ve done the prep work, 
it can generate the necessary script for you. 
All you need to do is show Automator what to 
do and it’ll record how to do it.
One of the brilliant things about Automator 
is that you can use it to add features that 
Apple hasn’t got round to yet. For example, in 
iTunes you can navigate much of the interface 
from the keyboard – switching between kinds 
of media or moving the focus to the search 
bar, say – but there aren’t shortcuts for the 
buttons to switch between Library, For You, 
Browse, Radio and the iTunes Store. As you’ll 
discover, Automator can fix that, and lets us 
assign whatever keyboard shortcuts we want.
Automator is all about automation, and 
Macs are very wary of anything automated in 
case it’s malicious software. That means if 
you’ve got a fairly untouched installation of 
macOS, Automator might be blocked from 
controlling your Mac. In that case, your Mac 
will tell you so when you try to run your 
Automator workflow, and you may have to 
give permission to Automator or iTunes in 
System Prefs > Security & Privacy > Privacy. 
iTunes triggers
Let’s explain what we’re going to do in this 
tutorial. First of all, we’re going to record the 
action of clicking on one of iTunes’ buttons. 
Then, we’re going to turn that recording into 
the AppleScript for the new Service our 
keyboard shortcut will trigger. We’ll then edit 
that slightly and copy it for each button, giving 
us five in total. Then we’ll create our shortcuts. 
Note that when we edit the AppleScript, 
we add a ‘return’ command: that’s to prevent 
error pop-ups if there are fewer than five 
buttons in the middle of iTunes’ navigation bar. 
We’ll make five shortcuts to match the number 
of sections in the Music category, but other 
kinds of media have fewer sections, and we 
don’t want pressing shortcut four or five to 
make our Mac angry. Gary Marshall

 How to Improve navigation in iTunes 
1
Start in Automator
Choose File > New, create a Service and then 
set the pop-up menus above the right pane to 
‘no input’ and ‘iTunes’. Click Record and press 
ç+† to go to iTunes, then click a navigation 
link, such as For You. Stop recording.
2
Copy the event
Your workflow should contain a ‘Watch 
Me Do’ action. In it, you’ll see a ‘Click the…’ 
event. Select it, press ç+C to copy it, click 
the action’s heading and press ∫ to delete it. 
Don’t worry, we’re going to bring it back again.
3
Add AppleScript
Click Actions (top left), search for ‘Run’ 
and drag ‘Run AppleScript’ into the workflow 
pane on the right. Select all of the text in the 
script and press ç+V to replace it with the 
AppleScript for the action you recorded.
4
Amend the script
Change the number after ‘delay’ to 
0.35 and then replace the text that’s between 
‘click radio button’ and ‘of radio group’ with ‘1’. 
Scroll down. Replace everything between 
‘on error’ and ‘end try’ with the word ‘return’.
5
Save your workflow
Press ç+S to save your workflow and 
call it ‘Media Subview 1’. Next, press ç+ß+S 
to duplicate the workflow, change ‘click radio 
button 1’ to ‘click radio button 2’ and save as 
‘Media Subview 2’. Repeat for 3, 4 and 5.
6
Create shortcuts
Open System Preferences and then follow 
Apple’s instructions (bit.ly/mkshrcts) to set up 
a keyboard shortcut for iTunes > Services > 
Media Subview 1. We’d recommend ç+ß+1. 
Repeat for the other Services you created.
Genius tip!
 Pair Automator with 
your Mac’s dictation 
features so that a 
spoken command, 
chosen by you, triggers 
a workflow. See bit.ly/
dictcmd for more info.

while the Mac desktop is 
fairly intuitive, minimising 
and reopening multiple 
windows can be a real chore, 
especially if you’re working with multiple 
apps at once. Magnet is a handy window 
manager that’s often near or at the top of the 
Mac App Store’s paid-for apps chart. It offers 
a simple way to arrange windows on your 
desktop. Normally it’s £4.99, though it’s 
sometimes discounted to as little as 99p.
You can use Magnet to automatically 
resize windows to a quarter, half or third of 
your desktop, and you can stack multiple apps 
neatly with just a swish of your mouse or by 
using Magnet’s intuitive keyboard shortcuts. 
Multiple options
The app offers a broad range of options 
for ‘tiling’ your windows beyond the simple 
zoom and minimise options offered by macOS. 
You can drag iTunes to the bottom-right 
corner of your screen so that it takes up 
just one quarter of the desktop, allowing 
you to browse your playlists as you work. 
Why not have Safari take up the upper half 
of your screen, so you’re free to browse the 
web at the same time?
The latest version of Magnet (2.1) has 
now been optimised for High Sierra. Other 
changes include support for dividing your 
desktop into thirds (see the walkthrough) or 
two-thirds portions, as well as compatibility 
with Adobe Creative Cloud apps. And if you 
have multiple displays, you’ll be pleased to 
learn that Magnet can support up to six.

 How to Set up Magnet 
1
Authorise Magnet
With Magnet installed on your Mac, 
open  > System Preferences > Security 
& Privacy. Click the Privacy tab, then 
select Accessibility on the left. Click the 
padlock (bottom left), enter your admin 
password, then put a tick next to Magnet.
2
Open Magnet at startup
Once you’ve authorised Magnet, 
the app will show a ‘Congratulations’ 
message, which details exactly how you 
can tile windows. When you’re done.tick 
the box marked ‘Launch Magnet at login’, 
then close the window.
3
Quartering windows
Start dragging an open window from 
its title bar, then move the pointer to the 
very corner of the screen. You’ll see a 
shaded overlay appear. Let go of the 
window to automatically snap and resize 
it to the shaded quarter (or a close fit).
4
Horizontal windows 
Magnet can also arrange windows 
to run across the whole width of the top 
or bottom half of the desktop. Drag a 
window to the left or right edge, and then 
just above or below one of the corners 
there, then release.
5
Vertical windows
Magnet can arrange a window to 
take up a vertical half of the desktop, 
which is great for working on a document 
while researching online. Simply drag a 
window to the middle of the right- or left-
hand edge of the screen.
6
Tile into thirds
Windows can be arranged vertically 
into thirds of the desktop’s width. Drag a 
window to and then along the screen’s 
bottom edge; use the shaded overlays to 
choose a third to fill. Minimum widths 
imposed by apps may result in overlaps.
7
Use the menu
If you find it difficult to tile windows 
the way you want by dragging with your 
mouse or trackpad, click on your chosen 
window and then on Magnet’s icon in the 
menu bar. From here you can select any 
of the tiling options outlined above.
8
Magnet shortcuts
Click Magnet’s icon to view keyboard 
shortcuts for arranging windows. These 
are ≈+å+[another key] by default. To 
record a new combo, choose Preferences 
from the menu, click next to a shortcut, 
then press your desired key combo.
9
Magnet tweaks
Deselect the ‘Snap windows by 
dragging’ preference to limit invoking 
Magnet to its keyboard shortcuts or its 
menu. If you’d rather not allow Magnet 
to affect the app you’re using, click its 
menu bar icon and choose Ignore [App].

 How the accessibility 
features in iOS 11 can 
improve your iPhone 
or iPad experience
 
yOu’LL nEEd
  iOS 11 (some 
features exist on 
older versions of iOS)
Accessibility is something 
many people consider an add-on 
for those with specific assistive 
needs. A well known example 
is screen reading software, baked into Macs 
and iOS devices to help anyone with a visual 
impairment. But modern accessibility’s aim is 
to cater for everyone, whatever their specific 
needs. So iOS 11 includes settings to benefit 
people who have hearing or motor impairment, 
too, and issues such as vestibular disorders.
Chances are that if you don’t have any such 
concerns, you skip past the Accessibility 
section of Settings entirely. That’s a shame, 
because ideas and concepts geared towards 
easing device use for a subset of people can 
often benefit a much wider audience. 
And that’s what this tutorial is all 
about — highlighting accessibility controls 
that can be a boon for anyone who uses 
an iPad or an iPhone, whether you have 
a specific impairment or not. We start with 
three handy-to-have controls in the Display 
& Brightness section of Settings, before 
delving into the Accessibility section proper.  
Craig Grannell
How to Make the most of accessibility features 
1
Adjust display zoom
Want content bigger on your iPhone 
Plus? In Settings > Display & Brightness, 
scroll down to View and tap it. In the 
Display Zoom page, you can preview 
Standard and Zoomed modes. Select 
Zoomed, tap Set and confirm to restart.
2
Increase text size
You can alternatively adjust text 
alone. In Text Size (or Settings > General 
> Accessibility > Larger Text), drag the 
slider. In apps that support Dynamic 
Type, such as Mail and Facebook, text will 
grow accordingly (or shrink, if you wish).
3
Make text bolder
The option below Text Size is Bold 
Text (also found in General > Accessibility 
> Larger Text). This emboldens text 
throughout iOS, including app names and 
button labels. Unlike Text Size, applying it 
requires your iPhone to be restarted.

CoNtINUED… Make the most of accessibility features 
4
Use Smart Invert
You could invert screen colours 
before iOS 11 in General > Accessibility > 
Display Accommodations. However, the 
new Smart Invert option reverses interface 
colours but not media. Alas, while it works 
in Photos, it doesn’t for images in Safari.
5
Auto-brightness
The Auto-Brightness switch used to 
be in Display & Brightness. Apple now 
thinks you should leave it on, so it has 
hidden this setting. If you ‘think different’, 
you’ll now find it in General > Accessibility > 
Display Accommodations.
6
Turn on speech
Few people use the text-to-speech 
feature in macOS, but it’s great for reading 
back what you’ve written. We suspect even 
fewer realise iOS is capable of the same. 
Go to General > Accessibility > Speech, and 
turn on Speak Selection to get started.
7
Read out a selection
Use the Speaking Rate slider to 
preview how fast the voice will talk. Then 
switch to another app, select some text, 
and tap Speak. Note how the current 
sentence is underlined, and words 
are highlighted as they are spoken. 
8
Increase contrast
If you have trouble dealing with 
the semi-transparent interface elements 
peppered throughout iOS 11, you can 
actually make them look more solid. 
In General > Accessibility > Increase 
Contrast, switch on Reduce Transparency.
9
Reduce motion
Had your fill of iOS 11’s dizzying 
animations, such as zooming when you 
open a folder, and the app switcher? Most 
can be stilled by turning on Reduce Motion 
in General > Accessibility. Auto-playing 
effects in Messages are toggled separately.
10
Type to Siri
If you want to use Siri somewhere 
you have to be quiet, turn on Type to Siri 
in General > Accessibility > Siri. When Siri 
is activated, you now type in your query. 
Note, however, that this entirely overrides 
voice input functionality.
11
Fine-tune 3D Touch
If your iPhone has a 3D Touch screen, 
go to General > Accessibility > 3D Touch. 
Here, you can disable the feature entirely 
if you regularly trigger it by accident, or 
you can adjust its sensitivity so that it 
requires a firmer press before activation.
12
Turn on mono audio
Listening out for someone? Want 
to use just one earbud, keeping the other 
ear free, without missing half your stereo 
track? Use General > Accessibility > Mono 
Audio to mix the left and right sounds into 
a mono signal that’s sent to both channels.

Have your iPhone tell you who’s calling before you even say “hello”

  20 minutes
yOu wILL LEARn
  How to assign custom 
images, ringtones 
and vibrations to 
your key contacts 
yOu’LL nEEd 
  An iPhone 
your iPhone is smarter than 
a traditional phone, and so it 
follows that it’s able to alert 
you to who’s on the other end 
of the line when a call comes in. But in order 
for this to work well, things need turning on 
and setting up, depending on the level of 
customisation you fancy.
When a call comes in, your iPhone will 
show whatever details are stored for the caller. 
If there are none, you’ll just see a number; but 
if you keep Contacts up to date, it’ll display any 
name, company, and photo that it finds.
In the walkthroughs here, we show you 
how to make the photo fill the screen, and 
assign custom ringtones and vibrations to 
specific contacts. But you can also have your 
iPhone announce who’s calling by speaking 
their name, saving you even having to glance 
its way: in Settings, go to Phone > Announce 
Calls, and choose Always. This feature can be 
restricted to times when you have headphones 
on or, more usefully, when you’re in the car.
Craig Grannell
How to Get fullscreen caller images >
1
Avoid tiny images
If pictures for people in Contacts come 
from the likes of Facebook thumbnails, 
the result is unimpressive when a call 
arrives. Next to the caller’s name, you 
see a tiny thumbnail. Of course, you may 
have no images assigned at all.
2
Bigger photo
For each contact you want to display 
fullscreen, you need a high-quality image 
in Photos. Ideally, you want one with 
dimensions at least half the vertical 
height of your iPhone and roughly 
75 per cent of its width.
3
Assign photo
Open a card in Contacts, tap Edit, 
tap the photo area and then Choose 
Photo. Select a photo to use, then move 
and scale it within the circle. (The extra 
width will give you more leeway.) Tap 
Choose and then Done. You’re all set.

How to Assign ringtones >
How to Feel your phone calls 
2
Sounds specific
For each person you want to have 
a distinct ringtone, open their card in 
Contacts, tap Edit, and tap Ringtone. 
Change their tone from the default to 
something else. You can also assign 
custom Text Tones to individuals.
3
Custom ringtones
If you’re not keen on Apple’s 
ringtones, you can create your own in 
GarageBand, and share them from the 
Browse screen as ringtones. Use loops 
or imported audio, or – if short on ideas 
– just yell someone’s name into the mic.
1
Activate vibrations
Ensure vibrations are on. In Settings, 
go to Sound & Haptics, turn on Vibrate 
on Ring and/or Vibrate on Silent to suit 
your personal preferences. You’ll now 
feel when a call arrives. Tap Ringtone 
(lower down) to choose a vibration.
2
Good vibrations
Within Ringtone > Vibration, tap 
Create New Vibration. In the New 
Vibration page, make your own distinct 
pattern by tapping/holding the screen. 
Tap Stop when you’re done, and then 
Play to feel what you created.
3
Assign a vibration
If unhappy, tap Record to have 
another go. Otherwise, tap Save, and 
name your vibration. This can then 
be assigned to one or more people in 
Contacts, in the Ringtone page shown 
in step 2 of the previous walkthrough.
Control where your calls go 
When Apple devices are signed in to iCloud and FaceTime using the same Apple 
ID, are on the same network, and have Wi-Fi turned on, phone calls can be taken 
on any of them. This feature is less impressive when several devices blare at you 
simultaneously when a call arrives. In Settings on your iPhone, go to Phone > 
Calls on Other Devices to pick which Macs and iOS devices should receive calls. 
To stop this on your Mac, untick Calls From iPhone in FaceTime’s prefs. For Apple 
Watch, open its app on your iPhone and look in My Watch > Notifications > Phone.
Dial up as much Continuity as you require 
1
Change main ringtone
In Settings, go to Sound & Haptics > 
Ringtone. Change it from the default. 
This now gives you a fighting chance of 
knowing your iPhone is the one that’s 
ringing. But you can assign ringtones 
to individuals, too…

Being able to customise

in macOS Sierra, but 
if you moved off to do 
something elsewhere 
and returned to that

  How to use Mac-only 
features of Contacts 
yOu’LL need
  Some people’s info 
already added to 
the Contacts app
These days, Apple makes quite 
a big deal about how a lot of its 
apps are broadly the same on 
macOS and iOS. Even if you’re 
armed with an iPhone, you get the majority 
of GarageBand or Numbers features in the 
palm of your hand. Which is great until you 
need to use some of the bits Apple left out.
Given its relative simplicity on the Mac, 
it’s perhaps surprising to realise Contacts isn’t 
quite as feature-rich on the iPhone and iPad. 
Sure, you can easily access all your contacts 
(assuming you’re using iCloud), and the 
interface is all very swish. But can you create 
groups? Nope. Smart groups? No way. Export 
contacts in a range of formats? No. How about 
set up a more private version of your own card 
to share? Not easily.
Fortunately, you can do all of these things 
at speed on the Mac. This walkthrough shows 
you how, along with providing a quick peek at 
Cardhop, a kind of third-party ‘pro’ take on 
Contacts from the folks behind Fantastical. 
Craig Grannell
How to Create groups in Contacts >
1
Make a new group
Hover over the iCloud header in 
the sidebar and click the + that appears 
(or choose File > New Group) to create a 
new contacts group. Give your group a 
memorable name. The group will sync 
to iOS devices and between Macs.
2
Add some contacts
Click All Contacts at the top of the 
sidebar to show your contacts. To add a 
person to the new group, simply drag 
them over the group’s name and let go. 
To remove someone, select the group, 
then the person’s name, and press ∫.
3
Use Smart Groups
Choose File > New Smart Group. 
In the sheet that appears, add conditions 
to create a group that automatically 
updates. Smart Groups don’t sync via 
iCloud, but can be used in Mail. (Consider 
prefixing them with SG for faster access.)

How to Make your own card more private >
How to Export your cards >
1
Create a ‘me’ card
Go to Contacts > Preferences, and 
select vCard. Tick Enable private me 
card. At the top of All Contacts, select 
your card, and click Edit. Turn off items 
in the Share column if you don’t want 
them included when exporting your card.
2
Copy and paste
The private ‘me’ card is a Mac-only 
feature. A workaround to get a private 
card on to iOS is to make a duplicate of 
your existing card and then adjust its 
details accordingly. To get started, select 
your card, and then copy and paste it.
3
Use on other devices
In the copy of your card, delete the 
fields/elements you don’t want to share 
with other people. Perhaps differentiate 
it from your full card with a specific 
photo, so you don’t accidentally send 
out the wrong one.
1
Check out iOS
On iOS, you can scroll to the bottom 
of any Contacts card and tap Share 
Contact. This can be sent to any app, 
including Files, but is always given the 
generic name Text File.vcf, which you’ll 
later need to change.
2
Drag and drop
In Contacts for Mac, the process 
is swifter and a mite smarter by default. 
Drag a contact’s record from Contacts to 
Finder – or any other app – and it retains 
the name of the contact. The exported 
file is otherwise identical to that on iOS.
3
Export to PDF
If you want an old-school list of your 
contacts, select one or more of them, 
a group, or All Contacts, and choose File > 
Export as PDF. Congratulations: you now 
have a traditional address book. Now you 
just need to print it out.
Start using CardHop
Although it’s a fairly powerful app on the Mac, Contacts isn’t terribly pleasant 
to use. By contrast, CardHop (£14.99, flexibits.com) is the Mac app equivalent of 
a loyal dog, always sitting patiently in the menu bar, desperately eager to please.
Cardhop’s natural language input makes it a cinch to add and edit contacts, 
or perform actions like making a call or emailing someone. The Notes field is 
also front-and-centre during searches, for when you need to recall your friend’s 
children’s names. That feature alone might be worth 15 quid.

hen Steve Jobs unveiled 
the ipad nearly eight 
years ago, he made the 
point that it wasn’t just 
a bigger iphone or a smaller MacBook – 
it was a third kind of device that, for 
some tasks at least, would be better 
than either. Since then, it’s got better 
than even he may have envisaged.
The iPhone needn’t look to its 
laurels: nobody wants to stuff a 10-inch 
touchscreen in their pocket or hold it 
against their ear. The Mac, on the other 
hand, has seen Apple’s remarkable 
A-series mobile processors creep ever 
closer to its territory, and not even the 
super-slim 12-inch MacBook can match 
W
Which iPad is best for you?
a tablet’s portability. So could it be time 
to ditch the desktop, nix the notebook, 
and make an iPad your main machine?
Apps and accessories 
Over the next few pages we’ll take a 
tour of the key apps and accessories 
that you might rely on to make that a 
real possibility. There’s no doubt that 
today’s iPads are capable of some 
amazing feats, from running recording 
studios to flying with airline pilots and 
assisting in operating theatres. But to be 
truly practical, you’ll first need to make 
sure it can cover all the essentials of 
everyday computing, without leaving 
you running back to the Mac.
With four ipad models in the range, 
Apple’s £99 pencil may narrow your 
choice: it only works with ipad pro. 
Third-party pressure-sensitive styluses 
for smaller iPads are less satisfactory.
Then again, the 9.7-inch iPad is a 
bargain. Its A9 processor isn’t too far 
behind the Pro’s A10X, and although its 
screen is no better than 2014’s iPad Air 2, 
it’s very sharp, has good colour accuracy, 
and is brighter. 
Ignore the iPad mini, which is too 
cramped for work and only comes in 
an overpriced 128GB model (£419). The 
128GB 9.7-inch iPad is a good buy at 
£429; at £339 with just 32GB, we think 
the base configuration would be a false 
economy for full-time use.
Even the iPad Pro’s default 64GB 
is a little tight, with no way to expand it.           
At £769, the 10.5-inch with 256GB is the 
sweet spot, with fantastic display quality; 
add Apple’s Smart Keyboard (£159) and 
it’s still over £300 cheaper than a 12-inch 
MacBook. Mobile network connectivity, 
at a crazy £130 extra, isn’t essential if you 
have an iPhone – just connect the iPad to 
your Personal Hotspot. The 12.9-inch iPad 
Pro, at £919 for 256GB, is worth the extra 
if you need to get lots of work into view.
The iPad has matured very nicely, and is 
now a very capable – and obviously very 
mobile – device. But can it satisfy all 
your needs. Could you ditch your Mac?
The 12.9-inch iPad Pro 
is the obvious choice 
to cover a full range of 
tasks, but isn’t the only 
option available to you.

Apple’s Mail app makes it easy to 
add accounts, and many people 
find it works fine. Others 
complain that searching is glitchy and it 
lacks convenience features. For the latter, 
Airmail is fast and lets you write messages 
in HTML or Markdown, as well as assigning 
incoming mail to Memo, To Do or Done.
iOS handles fonts across apps 
much like macOS, but has no 
Font Book to add or manage 
them. AnyFont is the answer, accepting 
standard font files from a Mac via the 
iTunes app, from email attachments, 
or from Dropbox. Admittedly, it’s a bit 
cumbersome to use, but it’s also a must 
for serious iPad document creation.
iOS 11’s new Files app is a 
convenient place to manage 
documents, and integrates 
third-party cloud services whose apps 
you’ve installed. But Documents is more 
capable and can view, play and download 
files from the web.
Apple’s basic Calculator app only 
exists on iPhone. PCalc is a solid 
substitute for iPad that uses 
the full screen for scientific functions, 
conversions and a Reverse Polish Notation 
mode. Worth the money for regular use.
This Apple-owned utility lets you 
build workflows (series of steps).  
You drag and drop actions, which 
then automate one or more apps to achieve 
your goals. A workflow might send a preset 
text, upload your last photo to a website or 
read you the time. The more you use your 
iPad, the more it can help.

ith Apple’s pages, 
numbers and Keynote 
available for free, 
every ipad has the 
productivity basics. 
Photos can manage your media and 
GarageBand is on hand for soundtracks. 
Safari covers web browsing, Mail should 
accommodate all your email accounts, 
and iBooks displays PDFs.
Unless you’re a die-hard Apple purist 
who only ever works with other die-hard 
Apple purists, however – and if so, we 
salute you – you may need a bit more 
to complete your do-it-all mobile 
workstation. Although Apple’s apps 
handle Microsoft documents, there 
are limits to the accuracy of their 
conversions, so it makes sense to add 
Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint, 
all designed for iPad and free to install, 
along with Outlook and OneNote.
To keep their full functionality after 
30 days you’ll need an Office 365 
subscription, from £59.99 per year from 
products.office.com. For arcane reasons, 
iPad Pro users without a subscription can

The apps you’ll need
desktop deal-breakers
A few of the desktop versions’ more 
advanced capabilities aren’t available 
even if you pay, which could be a deal-
breaker for the iPad if you need them 
regularly. For example, you’ll find that 
a smaller range of file formats is 
supported; Word includes key features 
like Track Changes, but lacks endnotes 
and equation editing; and Excel’s 
brilliantly useful Pivot Tables can’t 
be created or manipulated, although 
Pivot Tables already set up in a 
document are displayed.
To keep in touch with 
colleagues, FaceTime is ideal 
if they’re Apple users and the 
Skype app works fine if not;

Apps to consider
62 | MACFORMAT | JANUARY 2018
Drag and drop
With drag and drop in iOS 11, in many apps you 
can hold a finger on an item – such as a photo, 
message or document – and drag it to another 
app. Use your other hand if you need to switch 
to another app before dropping the item in,  
or ask Siri to open it.
W
Beyond the industry-
standard, there are very 
powerful creative apps
Apple’s apps can handle Microsoft docs, but it 
makes sense to add Word, Excel and PowerPoint.

As long as iOS is reasonably up-to-date, your iPad 
can run business-standard apps like Excel, as well 
as advanced creative apps such as LumaFusion.
Microsoft OneNote is okay, but 
many people prefer Evernote to 
organise, annotate and sync their 
notes. Free for basic use, subscriptions give 
you more cloud space, formats and syncing 
to more than two devices – starting at 
£29.99 per year. Add the Penultimate app to 
handwrite searchable notes on the screen.
Drag and drop in iOS 11 lets you 
drag things from one app and 
drop them into another right 
away. Yoink is a holding area for multiple 
items, accessible via Slide Over, or as a 
Share sheet extension or custom keyboard.
iCloud is a practical place to keep 
documents, but Dropbox is more 
versatile and lets you share 
whole folders with people in an instant. 
With its app installed, Dropbox integrates 
with iOS 11’s Files app and Share sheets.
Your keychain on the Mac can 
store more than just login details. 
However, iOS lacks the Keychain 
Access app to do this. Dashlane is a flexible 
password, autofill and private info manager. 
Free for iPad-only use, syncing between 
devices costs £29.99 a year.
While sipping their flat whites, 
power users swear by 
OmniGroup’s tools for organising 
and visualising information. This all-purpose 
diagramming app brings the precision of 
the Mac version to the touchscreen; a Pro 
version (£99.99) adds even more advanced 
features, including JavaScript automation.

Creative thinking
Creative software companies haven’t 
entirely embraced the iPad as a primary 
platform. Adobe’s iOS apps are aimed 
at different tasks than its Mac software. 
Though Photoshop Sketch and Illustrator 
Draw use the touchscreen for freehand 
graphics, on the whole Adobe’s apps 
assume you’ll take your work back to the 
Mac (Premiere Clip handles basic rough 
cuts that can be imported to Premiere 
Pro CC), or act mainly as viewers for your 
content (Lightroom CC for iOS only really 
makes sense for users of the Mac app). 
Beyond the industry-standard names, 
however, there are now some very 
powerful creative apps for iOS. 
While film and TV editors need 
top-end Macs, iOS apps like the 
established Pinnacle Studio Pro (£12.99, 
pinnaclesys.com) and the fast-rising 
LumaFusion (£19.99, luma-touch.com) 
have precise enough tools for serious 
work. Affinity Photo (£19.99, affinity.serif.
com) provides most of the features of a 
desktop photo editor.
Musicians, meanwhile, have a better 
choice of software than on any other 
platform. Again, there’s no full equivalent 
of Mac digital audio workstations (DAWs) 
like Cubase Pro or Apple’s Logic Pro X, 
but Cubasis 2.2 (£48.99, steinberg.net) 
is capable, while iPad-only alternatives 
like Auria Pro (£48.99, auriaapp.com) 
are impressive if you don’t need 
roundtripping with desktop apps.

Should i convert my 
JPEGs to HEiF files?
HEIF images in Preview, and save them as 
JPEG, PNG, and other formats, but if you can’t 
readily transcode from older formats into HEIF 
your proposal won’t work.
Third-party tools which can write to the 
new formats are based on the open source 
FFmpeg tool, which you can use directly in 
Terminal if you wish. As this works in Sierra 
and older versions of the system, you don’t 
need High Sierra for conversion, though that 
makes viewing and decoding much easier.
Look at Image2HEIF (£2.99, Mac App 
Store), which is based on FFmpeg, with its 
basic interface for transcoding from JPEG or 
PNG, and limited control over image quality. 
Results look impressive, with little loss of 
detail in files half the size of equivalent JPEGs.

Q
I’ve held off upgrading to iOS 11

Macs to High Sierra. Would I face 
compatibility problems if I mixed iOS 11 
with Sierra systems?
by D av i D  a r m s t r o N g
A
Very many iOS and Mac users 
have successfully upgraded to 
iOS 11 while staying with macOS 
Sierra. As usual, there are trade-offs to be 
made, and there’s no doubt that to get the 
most out of iOS 11, you’d be better off running 
High Sierra when you can.
Where you’d lose out are those new 
features in iOS 11 which don’t work with 
macOS Sierra. A good example of these is 
tables in Notes: if you insert a table into 
a note in iOS 11 and then try opening that 
note in Sierra, the table isn’t just formatted 
crudely, but that content is omitted 
completely. macOS Sierra also lacks 
support for the new HEIF and HEVC image 
and video formats, although third-party 
software and automatic conversion 
should help address that. (See the question 
on the previous page for more on this.)
Obviously, the more that you share 
between your iOS devices and Macs, the 
more likely this is to trip you up. Having said 
that, all the key features of iCloud and shared

data which are present in iOS 10 and macOS 
Sierra still work fine.
Because iOS is more of a closed system, 
in which security is paramount, the security 
enhancements in iOS 11 are an important 
consideration too: these now include a fix 
for vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi’s WPA2 protocol, 
for example. But the cost is that all your old 
32-bit iOS apps will cease functioning, unless 
they can be updated or upgraded.
Running iOS 11 lets you add neat tables to Notes, but these 
can’t be seen at all when viewed in macOS Sierra.

stations, wired systems and modem-router 
with proper Ethernet cabling. Powerline 
networking can work very well, but uses 
domestic electric wiring to transmit network 
traffic. Even the best and most modern wiring 
is designed to deliver power safely, not to 
transmit high volumes of digital signals. It can 
be sensitive to your own domestic electrical 
appliances cutting in and out, and heavy 
equipment in nearby buildings. It’s also 
completely unshielded.
When planning your network, connect 
non-portable devices using Ethernet as much 
as possible. This will give them better 
bandwidth and reduce the number of devices 
using wireless networking. Position your Wi-Fi 
systems to optimise local cover without 
conflicting with one another, or spilling into

major task, but well worth the time and effort.

Yes, but you may well have other

by D av i D  s i m P s o N
A
This is a shutdown panic or freeze, 
and should never occur. It happens 
when macOS is trying to shut 
everything down, but something brings 
macOS GeNIUS tIPS
it to a grinding halt. Your problem is identifying 
what that something is.
Test whether it affects another account 
on your Mac: if it doesn’t, then it’s likely to be 
old or broken software in your Home folder, 
probably in ~/Library, rather than an issue 
within macOS itself.
The best way to identify the cause is by 
browsing the log after such an ‘improper’ 
shutdown, using Consolation (eclecticlight.co/
downloads). Search for ‘system boot:’, which 
marks the beginning of the startup process, 
then work back to the entries before the 
shutdown for clues about what went wrong.
Stuck when shutting down
When you’ve located the 
last log message containing 
‘system boot:’, look back 
at the previous shutdown 
to identify problems.

Time Machine backups were

When your Mac has been away 
from its normal backup disk 
for so long, its next backup is 
likely to take a long time and may well 
involve verification, as well as a ‘deep 
traversal scan’ of your Mac. These are 
much better performed with your Mac 
connected to your Time Capsule, or any 
other networked backup storage, by 
wired Ethernet, rather than by Wi-Fi.
You may also find it wise to keep 
an eye on your Mac’s logs during this 
period, as problems in Time Machine 
are not particularly well reported except 
in the log. Apple’s Console is not much 
use for this, and you should find my 
free Consolation tool from eclecticlight. 
co/downloads much more helpful. 
Once backups are running more 
normally again, check them using 
T2M2 from the same site.
If you can’t get backups working 
normally due to failed verification, 
it may be best to start from scratch. 
Make an archive copy of your old 
backups if you can and wish, then 
initialise the Time Capsule and set 
the first backup going 
over Ethernet.

iPhone 
killers
A
pple hit the jackpot 
with the iPhone, 
a device that has 
become the company’s best-
selling device and brought 
it untold riches. Naturally, 
other companies wanted 
to get in on the action and 
knock Apple from its lofty 
perch. The list of so-called 
iPhone killers is long, but 
three devices stand out: the 
Essential Phone, the Palm 
Pre and the Nokia N97. From 
sleek high-end devices to 
keyboard-equipped retro 
throwbacks, all are yet to 
make the grade.
Essential 
Phone
August 2017
uch is Apple’s dominance in 
the tech world that it seems 
every other company is out to 
take it down. The media seems 
fond of the idea too, often resulting in a 
bevy of breathless headlines exalting the 
next ‘Apple killer’ of some form: the next 
iPod killer, the next Mac killer, the next 
iPhone killer – you get the idea.
Sometimes these devices come from 
major Apple rivals like Sony or Microsoft, 
backed by almost limitless funds and 
expertise. Other times they’re brought 
out by small teams that think they’ve hit 
the jackpot where all others have failed, 
and can bring down the Cupertino giant.
Of course, not every Apple killer 
ends in murderous success. Some put 
up a good fight but ultimately can’t 
land the final blow. Others never live 
up to the hype that gets bestowed on 
them. And some never even make it 
to market, becoming vapourware and 
disappearing in the wind.
Over the next few pages, we’ll take 
a look at some of the more notable 
rivals once thought destined to take 
Apple’s crown. From recent flops to 
vintage disappointments, these are 
the Apple killers that weren’t.
The next big 
things that 
took a swing 
and missed
Even before it launched, the 
Essential Phone was being 
touted as a potential iPhone 
killer. Word spread that 
former Apple engineer and 
Android founder Andy Rubin 
was involved, while shadowy 
leaked photos of the device 
quickly went viral.
The Essential Phone 
seemed to be a device 
destined for success. Aside 
from the Rubin connection, 
it has a modular camera 
system, an edge-to-edge 
glass screen, wireless 
charging and a titanium 
shell. It’s a high-end phone,  
no doubt.
But if anything, the 
Essential Phone is a good 
example that something that 
looks good on paper doesn’t 
necessarily equate to roaring 
sales in practice. According to 
a report published a month 
after the phone launched, it 
had only sold 5,000 units 
through its network partner 
Sprint (sales of unlocked units 
remained unknown). A month 
later, Rubin and co knocked 
$200 off the $649 launch 
price. Missed launch deadlines 
and lacklustre software added 
to the issues. Essential isn’t 
dead, but its rocky start has 
failed to kill off the iPhone.

touchscreen phone that also 
came with a keyboard. It ran 
on webOS, the first mobile OS 
that allowed multitasking.
That wasn’t enough to save 
Palm, though. Dodgy software, 
a flimsy slider mechanism and 
fragile screens were all issues. 
HP bought Palm in 2010, and 
shelved the brand name just 
a year later.
Like Palm, Nokia was another 
company left reeling by the 
iPhone. The N97 was the 
Finnish firm’s answer, on which 
it pinned a lot of hopes. Sadly 
for Nokia, the N97 was a huge 
disappointment, and failed to 
unseat Apple.
Like the Palm Pre, the N97 
featured a slide-out keyboard, 
although the Nokia device was 
meant to be used in landscape 
orientation. It was an eye-
catching design, and the phone 
sold pretty well, but nowhere 
near enough to rival the iPhone.
That was due to a multitude 
of issues. The camera scratched 
easily, the maps software was 
almost unusable, and the OS was 
very buggy. It never met its 
potential, and may even have 
contributed to Nokia’s decline.

When Apple’s biggest rival 
comes out with a product 
to take down the iPod, 
you have to take notice. 
Unfortunately for Microsoft, 
it got it wrong with the Zune.
Initial sales of the first 
model were strong. It took 
9% of the portable media 
market during its first week; 
still a long way behind the 
iPod’s 63%, but not bad.
That didn’t last long. 
Sales dropped from $185 
million during 2007’s 
Christmas season to 
$85 million a year later. 
Apple sold $3.37 billion 
worth of iPods during 
2008’s Christmas period.
Microsoft’s problem was 
that it was too late. The iPod 
was established, and the 
Zune just wasn’t different 
enough to succeed.
As with many things, when 
Apple released the iPod in 
2001 it changed the way 
we viewed a device. Sony, it 
seems, didn’t pay attention.
The catchily named Vaio 
Pocket VGF-AP1 launched 
three years after the first 
iPod, yet still sported the 
clunky looks of the media 
players of old.
Worse, it only played 
files in the ATRAC3 format, 
and had a confusing array 
of 25 buttons on the front. 
Stylish, it was not.
Microsoft’s Zune was late, but 
the PonoPlayer was even later. 
This device – created by Neil 
Young – was a high resolution 
audio player coming in at $400 
a pop. That sounds OK… until you 
realise it was launched in 2015.
It was always going to be a 
hard sell. The age of mass market 
standalone music players was 
long gone, with most consumers 
happy to store their tunes on 
their phones. But the PonoPlayer 
was even more niche, as it 
focused on high-resolution audio.
Despite raising a massive 
$6.2 million on Kickstarter, 
PonoPlayer quickly fell away. 
Its online store went offline in 
2016 and remains so.

Big, blocky and built like a 
brick, the Archos Jukebox 
Recorder is about as far 
removed from an iPod 
as it’s possible to be. 
Amazingly, despite its truly 
hideous design, it was one 
of the smallest digital music 
players on the market (bar 
the iPod, of course).
Still, it managed to find 
a degree of popularity 
due to its USB 2.0 
connection, 
its easily 
replaceable batteries and 
the fact that you could 
replace its hard drive with 
a bigger laptop one.
Of course, with a design 
like this it was never going 
to usurp the sleek, design-
conscious iPod.

Courier
Cancelled April 2010
Tablet computers 
that needed extra-
strength medication
iPad 
killers
A
fter the success of the 
iPod and iPhone, rumours 
swirled of Apple’s next 
project: a tablet computer. Before 
the iPad was even revealed, rivals 
claimed that they had the device to 
beat the nascent ‘iSlate’.
In a familiar story, Apple routed 
the competition. Some were buggy, 
some were slow, and some never 
even made it into the wild. They 
crashed and burned while the iPad 
went from strength to strength.
While iPad copycats have abounded for 
years, Microsoft’s Courier project was a 
little different. It comprised two touchscreen 
devices and a stylus, held together by a book-like 
cover. The target market was creatives who might 
sketch ideas into the device on the go. 
However, Microsoft preferred to develop Windows 8 
for tablets, and the Courier project was cancelled within 
a few weeks of the iPad’s launch. It was a novel vision for 
tablets that never made it out of the blocks.
The problem with predictions is 
they don’t always come true. Case 
in point: the HP Slate 500, touted 
as an iPad killer for the masses 
before the iPad was even out. 
But after delays and rumoured 
changes, it ditched the consumer 
market and launched as an 
enterprise product instead.
It was basically a touchscreen PC 
with the keyboard removed. It ran 
Windows 7, but had no specialist 
touchscreen software, instead relying 
on Windows’ mediocre facilities.
That made it hard to do any 
serious work without hooking up an 
While the HP Slate 500’s touchscreen 
issues were partly due to Windows, 
this device had no such excuse. That’s 
because its 1GB of memory wasn’t even 
enough to run its operating system well.
It also made for a frustrating user 
experience. Apps could take minutes to 
load, the touchscreen was inaccurate 
and laggy, while the low-resolution 
display was a pain to look at. A pitiful 
three-hour battery life rounded off 
the problems. Apple really didn’t have 
anything to worry about with this device.

The Apple Watch killers that ran out of time
if there’s one idea that won’t go away, 
it’s that desktop computers should 
come equipped with touchscreens.
The HP TouchSmart series reflected 
this belief, positioning its devices as 
all-in-ones that one-upped the iMac 
thanks to their displays.
Of course, the iMac is still here 
and the TouchSmart desktops aren’t, 
thanks to dated appearances and 
sluggish internal specs.
When it first launched, the MacBook Air was the 
ultra-portable laptop to beat. Dell reckoned it had 
done that with the slimline Adamo – at 0.65-inches 
thick, it was thinner than Apple’s 0.76-inch 
Air. But for a £1,400 laptop, 
it was surprisingly flimsy, and 
its internals struggled to justify 
its eye-watering price.
The Samsung Galaxy 
Gear shows why rushing 
to beat Apple isn’t 
always a good idea. 
Lacklustre design, poor 
battery life, limited apps and an 
uncomfortable strap meant it was 
a flop. It was replaced just seven 
months after going on sale.
The watch that 
kickstarted an industry 
was gone just three years 
after going on sale. After 
raising $10 million via 
crowdfunding and selling millions of 
units, the Pebble just couldn’t keep up 
with its rivals’ innovations. It was bought 
by Fitbit in 2016.
Even traditional watch 
firms have felt the pinch 
from Apple. Swiss company 
Tag Heuer responded to the 
popularity of smartwatches 
with the Connected watch, which looked 
more like a traditional timepiece. Suffice 
to say, it hasn’t yet dented Apple’s 
vice-like grip on the market.
The iMac sports an iconic look, so 
it’s no wonder it has its imitators. 
The Asus Zen AiO may be the best-
looking of the bunch.
Of course, that may be because it’s 
mimicking the iMac. But for all its good 
looks, this machine has failed to knock 
Apple from its perch. Apple remains one 
of the few PC companies not to lose 
sales in recent years; Asus has been 
struggling in comparison.

REUSE 
OLD KIT
ormally, when I fail to get an old Mac 
working, I try to save my confession 
until the final paragraph so that I 
can first regale you with tales of my clever 
diagnostics and ingenious repairs. But let’s cut 
to the chase. When I opened up the case of this 
Mac Plus, the rusty fiasco that greeted me made 
it clear this was a non-starter. The power supply 
board showed no voltage on any of the DC rails 
and there was extensive water damage. 
There is one other Mac Plus in the Haq 
Collection I acquired recently, but it doesn’t have 
a power supply board, so cannibalising the two 
isn’t an option either. The case is still in good 
condition though, so this seems like an ideal 
opportunity for a case mod, without the guilt of 
destroying a potentially salvageable Mac. And it 
so happens that I have the perfect project.

Can Luis turn

 Before the smartphone, and even before the Palm organiser, there was 
the Apple Newton. Released in 1993 after six years and $100 million in 
development costs, the Newton only sold 50,000 units in its first 
three months and quickly became a white elephant. The handwriting 
recognition was unreliable, the AAA batteries ran down too quickly 
and the first-generation model couldn’t even connect to your desktop 
computer. But the Newton did bring us the term Personal Digital Assistant 
(PDA) and it helped to define the genre that led us to the iPhone.

Mannequin can advance or retreat along it. 
The torso has a separate motor that allows 
him to pivot and swipe with the foam

head uses a Bluetooth speaker for trash talk,

display different expressions. The whole thing

questions 
How easy is it to 
cut the Mac case?
 The whole of the outer 
case is made of plastic –  
probably ABS – so it’s 
easy to drill or saw 
through. If you’re using 
power tools, run them 
at their slowest speed, 
to avoid melting the 
plastic and gumming 
up your blade.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How to I avoid 
‘twitching’ on my 
robot’s motors?
 This can be caused 
by ‘back EMF’ from 
the relay coil. When 
the relay is turned 
off, the magnetic field 
from the coil collapses 
and this rapid change 
induces a current in 
any nearby wires. You 
can protect against this 
with a diode in series 
with the 5V line to the 
relay board. It is also 
a good idea to include 
a 220uF capacitor 
between the power 
and ground wires, 
to smooth out any 
sudden voltage spikes.
The 64 LEDs in each 
eye can be controlled 
independently to 
allow animated 
eye expressions.

Mega handles the radio control and all the motors.
narrow tolerances, 
so that was not going 
to work here. Instead 
I had to model the whole 
thing in CAD, which meant 
teaching myself how to use 
CAD. I opted for Fusion 360 (autodesk.com) 
mostly on the basis of its price, which is zero 
for home hobbyists, but it also turns out to be 
an extremely powerful design tool. 
Every component in your design keeps 
a separate track of all the edits you make. 
This is way more than just an undo history – 
it’s more like the time travel in Back to the 
Future. If I create a 2D sketch and then 
extrude it into a 3D object, I can jump back 
at any point, edit the sketch and Fusion 360 
will propagate the changes back through the 
timeline. This includes intelligently redoing all 
the other edits I have 
made since then. And all this 
is done on a Mac mini from 2012!
Making it real
A CAD model by itself, though, is just a pretty 
picture. You need a 3D printer to turn it into 
reality. I used this project to justify buying 
myself the Prusa i3 MK2S (£560 from 
prusa3d.com) and I am now a complete 
convert. I originally thought it would just 
be the easiest way to make the cogs for the 
gearbox – and it undoubtedly was. But I totally 
underestimated how useful it would be for all 
the other fiddly bits. 
I don’t have a big workshop with a lathe 
and lots of fancy drills and saws. But the 
magic of 3D printing let me create custom 
brackets and mounts, with the confidence 
that if they fitted together on the screen, 
they would fit together in real life. I even 
used a flexible rubber filament to print the 
tyres for Mannequin’s wheels.
Mannequin’s electronics are controlled by 
two Arduino programmable microcontrollers 
(arduino.cc). An Arduino Mega handles the 
radio control and the motors, and an Arduino 
Uno in the head drives the LED matrices for 
the eyes. The motors are scavenged from two 
cordless drills, but they run on 18V and draw 
large currents, so you can’t switch them 
directly from an Arduino. I used a 24V relay 
board, with four relays to switch between 
forward and back on each of the two motors.

Get inside
Undo the two screws at the back, near 
the bottom, with a Torx T15 screwdriver. 
To get at the top screws, recessed into 
the carry handle, you’ll need to firmly 
tape a Torx T15 screwdriver bit to the 
end of a pencil to fashion a makeshift 
screwdriver extension; wrap the tape 
tightly and it should be strong enough.

Power board
Disconnect the green/yellow earth 
lead and the two large connectors going 
to the CRT tube. There’s a thick red, high-

back the ‘suction cup’ cover; squeeze the 
connectors together to pull free. Undo 
the three Phillips screws and remove the 
power board from the chassis.

Undo the four screws holding the 
CRT to the front bezel and lift it out. 
Disconnect the ribbon cable from the

drive chassis is held in place by three 
Torx T15 screws at the top and two more 
under the drive itself.
 How to Gut a Mac Plus 
Next issue!
 Luis fires up a Power 
Mac 4400 – the only 
Power Mac with the 
floppy drive on the left-
hand side! But does this 
machine have any other 
redeeming features?
Microsecond timing
To program an Arduino, you essentially use a 
simplified dialect of C++, and upload the code 
over a USB cable. I used the cloud-based 
development environment at create.arduino.
cc, so that I could write the code on my 
desktop, but then access it from my MacBook 
Air to upload changes while Mannequin was 
still mounted on his beam. 
Radio control transmitters work by sending 
modulated pulses less than 2 milliseconds 
long. To work out the position of each joystick 
on the controller, the Arduino Mega has to 
time these pulses very precisely. That’s easy 
to do using open-source libraries available at 
sparkfun.com/tutorials/348. The only snag 
is that writing different patterns to an LED 
matrix also requires accurate timing, and 
the libraries for that can interfere with the 
radio control code. 
That’s why I used two Arduinos. The Mega 
at the base of the robot would receive the 
commands from the RC controller and create 
a 4-bit code representing the expression 
Mannequin should display. This was then 
passed along a 4-wire cable that ran up the 
central tube that supported the torso.  This 
‘spinal cord’ was constantly being plugged and 
unplugged every time I took the head off, so 
the delicate pins took a lot of punishment. 
When we were setting Mannequin up on the 
first morning of Sci-Fi Weekender, pin 3 
snapped off as I was plugging it in and I had to 
perform the most precarious bit of soldering 
of my life, balancing on tiptoes on a narrow 
beam with just the light from the torch app on 
my iPhone to see by.
So that’s the robot, but where does the 
Mac Plus come in? It’s Mannequin’s helmet! 
After I had removed the CRT screen and 
everything else (see above), I took the empty 
case and cut a hole in the bottom for the spine 
tube and hot-glued the 3D printed skull chassis 
into place. The front bezel is held in place with 
simple 3D-printed clips so I can still get at the 
internals for maintenance and to change the 
battery that powers the Arduino. Classic Macs 
obviously aren’t canon in the Star Wars 
universe, but whenever someone pointed this 
out, I just explained that Mannequin was 
cosplaying as an Earth computer! I’m happy 
with how this project turned out and it was by 
far the easiest one I’ve done for Love Your 
Mac so far – but only if you don’t count the six 
months I spent building the rest of the robot! 
i totally underestimated 
how useful a 3d printer 
would be for fiddly bits

wired connection. As it 
stands, it’s a shame no 
such port is present, as that 
might have allowed the speakers 
to support USB Audio input; that’s 
increasingly important now that devices 
such as the iPhone and iPad can use their 
Lightning-to-USB cable to deliver digital 
audio that provides higher quality than 
either Bluetooth or a conventional 3.5mm 
wired connection. 
Bass light 
You’re not going to get hi-fi quality from 
speakers costing £90, but the MX Sound 
does a good job for such a compact little set. 
The speakers produce a warm, full sound 
with the massed harmonies of Somebody 
To Love by Queen, and manage to create 
an open, expansive soundstage for the wide 
atmospherics of Enya’s Orinoco Flow. 
The only minor disappointment is the bass 
output. To be fair, the little bass port on each 
speaker (which does double duty as a stand) 
adds some body to the mid-bass on pop tracks 
like Blondie’s Rapture, but the small speakers 
do struggle to get down to the deeper, 
electronic bass of Prime Evil by The Orb. 
There are bigger and better speakers 
around, but if you need just a compact set 
of desktop speakers to enhance music and 
video on your Mac and mobile devices, the 
MX Sound will do the trick very nicely, 
without costing the earth.
L
ogitech’s new MX mice and 
keyboards have gone down 
well here at MacFormat by 
providing ingenious features, such as 
the ability to quickly switch control 
between two separate computers. 
The company’s new MX Sound speakers 
attempt to provide similar versatility 
when you’re listening to music on your 
Mac, iPhone or iPad.
The two compact speakers stand just 16cm 
wide and high, so they’ll sit comfortably on 
either side of your Mac without taking up too 
much desk space. They provide Bluetooth for 
iOS devices, and can pair with two devices at 
once. There are also two 3.5mm connectors 
for audio input from a Mac or other wired 
device, and a headphone connector as well. 
And, just like the other Logitech MX 
products, the MX Sound enables you to 
switch between devices – either Bluetooth 
or wired – quickly and easily. All you have to 
do is pause the audio on one device and then 
start playing a track on the other, and the 
MX Sound will automatically detect the new 
audio input and switch over for you.
The one thing missing here is a USB port. 
Given the speakers’ compact design, it would 
be handy to power them straight from a USB 
port on a Mac or PC. That would make it even 
simpler to set them up, especially if you want 
to use them with a laptop that gets moved 
from room to room at home. Admittedly, the 
Bluetooth streaming might require mains 
power, but it’d be nice to have the option of 
running the speakers off USB for a simple

ireless noise-cancelling 
headphones feel like the 
pinnacle of private listening 
technology. In this regard, the PX 
headphones are a massive success.  
The feature-set is a masterclass in 
covering all the bases of a modern pair of 
headphones. Charging by USB-C? Check. 
A non-proprietary 3.5mm jack? Check. 
A complete set of physical button controls? 
Check. A respectable 22 hours of battery life? 
Check. Bluetooth aptX HD support? Check. 
More impressive is the ability of the 
headphones to understand when you’re using 
them and when you’re not, turning off simply 
by removing them from your head. You can 
even pause them by lifting just one of the 
earcups off your head. 
Occasionally the technology can misfire. 
There were a couple of moments when we 
paused our music with the headphones still 
on our head, only for it to resume playing after 
a couple of seconds in confusion, but these 
problems were few and far between, and it’s 
possible to change the sensitivity of this 
feature in the PX’s companion app. 
Noise-cancelling performance
We tried the PX on a noisy underground 
train during rush hour using their default 
(‘Flight’) noise cancellation setting and 
they performed admirably, with a level 
of cancellation that’s up there with the 
likes of Bose and Sony. 
If you want a more granular level of 
control, there are three noise-cancelling 
modes to choose from in the companion app, 
with each designed to cancel and let through 
certain frequencies more than others. 
The ‘City’ setting is designed to let 
through traffic noise, so you can walk the 
streets with improved safety while using 
the headphones. ‘Office’ lets through higher-
frequency voices so colleagues can talk to you. 
Finally, ‘Flight’ is focused on eliminating the 
low rumble of a plane’s engines. 
We love the functionality of the PX, and 
its noise cancellation easily competes with 
the established players, but its sound quality 
doesn’t quite hit the same heights that we’ve 
come to expect. The biggest problem is the 
mids and trebles, which have a fuzziness to 
them that means complex soundstages can 
end up feeling a little squashed. 
Listen to the likes of Radio Protector by 
65daysofstatic and when the song really gets 
going, the headphones make the sound feel 
messier and noisier than it should be. Overall 
this leads to a loss of detail that, while not the 
worst we’ve experienced, is a step behind 
what we hope for at this price point. 
At the bassier end, the cans fair a great 
deal better. Play Freeze Me by Death from 
Above 1979 and its driving bass line is present 
in spades. It’s tight, it’s punchy, and its given 
the space to really hold the song together. 
It feels odd to complain about the PX’s 
sound quality, but it’s a sign of just how 
mainstream noise-cancellation technology 
has become that at this price we’re able to 
expect premium sound quality in addition 
to everything else the headphones offer.
The PX is available 
in black-and-silver 
or black-and-gold 
colourways.

but the full-back cap over its USB-C port and 
its overall build quality inspire less confidence.

here, but the design of its seal and its packaging 
feel well considered for its protective purpose.
HHHHH
£449.99  FROM CalDigit, caldigit.com  
 FEATURES IP57 dust and waterproof, USB-C port
Design HHHHH
Tuff’s body is metal at its core, but with a removable 
bumper that’s available in other colours. Water resistance 
(one metre for 30 minutes) comes from a small plug in the 
bumper that fills the cavity where the USB-C port resides.
Portability HHHHH
At 13.5x9x2.1cm, Tuff is one of the largest external SSDs 
we’ve tried; CalDigit uses the same design for hard drives. 
It comes with an optional ‘protective archive box’, which 
also stores both of the bundled USB-A and USB-C cables.
Performance HHHHH
Tuff’s peak rate of 521.8MB/sec when reading is behind 
Adata’s drive, but in every other test its peak and mean 
averages were on par with or better than it. Tuff is as good 
as other (non-RAID) USB 3.1 Gen 2 drives we’ve tested.
Value HHHHH
This drive also features a USB 3.1 Gen 2 interface, which is 
great news for recent Macs. On top of the smart design, the 
tough storage box certainly boosts the protective value, 
and it’s barely any more costly than other SSDs we’ve seen 
that lack a dust and water cover, such as Samsung’s T5.

This SSD is metallic save for black plastic ends. One end 
pulls out of the body and pivots away to reveal the USB-C 
port, but our (theoretical, not encountered) concern is a 
bump to the cap might pull it out, leaving the port exposed.
Portability HHHHH
The drive is 7.3x4.4x1.2cm and weighs just 33 grams. 
Size-wise, that’s in line with other small SSDs we’ve 
tested, though the weight is even lower than the gorgeous 
Samsung T5, our favourite tiny drive, which is 51 grams.

Adata’s drive features a USB 3.1 Gen 2 interface for better 
transfer rates on a suitable Mac. The peak rate we got was

Value HHHHH
This drive looks nice, its body’s ridged form and the feel of 
the material make it comfortable to grip, and the protective 
promise – working after an hour in 1.5m of water – are nice 
extras over drives of similar cost and size. But robustness

Wave 2 routers APPLe cHoIce
W
e’ve looked at a group 
test of 802.11ac routers 
previously here in 
MacFormat, but things move 
on and we’ve now got a complete 
range of routers featuring new 
technologies. These ‘second 
generation’ or ‘Wave 2’ 802.11ac 
Wi-Fi routers feature MU-MIMO – 
or Multiple User, Multiple Input 
Multiple Output technology. 
The 802.11n and 802.11ac routers 
we’ve had for the last decade have used 
MIMO technology, but they could only 
deal with one device at a time. That’s no 
good for the devices and uses we have 
now, where streaming content, games 
and more to multiple devices, such as 
your Mac and iPad, is an everyday 
occurrence. And these devices now 
consume a lot of bandwidth. MU-
MIMO resolves the issue. 
So this latest generation of routers 
can deliver consistent high speeds to 
all your devices thanks to an extra 
send and receive antenna, additional 
channels for newer devices that can use 
the 5Ghz band, and increased capacity. 
strong field
We’ve picked some terrific options 
from popular Wi-Fi manufacturers, 
and they’re presented for you over the 
next few pages. Many of these routers 
are very similar in 
terms of their wireless 
capability, and that’s 
not surprising 
considering they’re 
based on the same 
wireless standards, 
and in some cases will have the same 
wireless chipset inside. 
It’s an incredibly strong field, that’s 
for sure. But who will come out on top?
We’re streaming content, games  
and more to multiple devices, 
such as Mac and iPad, and these 
devices consume a lot of bandwidth
things to consider…
a few advanced features to look out for
1
USB ports
some of our routers come 
with usB ports. With these, you 
can decide to share a storage drive 
across your network. this is really 
useful if, for example, you have a 
bunch of video files on a usB stick 
you wish to share to various devices. 
It’s also handy for backing up. 
2
Price
Routers vary wildly in price. 
second generation 802.11ac routers 
aren’t cheap currently and that’s 
because of the more complex chipset 
inside. We recommend shopping 
around as prices also fluctuate 
quite a bit – expect some post-
Christmas discounts. 
3
ADSL connection 
Most of our routers are 
ethernet, meaning they need to 
connect to an ethernet feed. the 
Asus boasts ADsL connectivity, 
too, but that’s not a deal-breaker as 
you can get ADsL versions of some 
of the other models here. Most ADsL 
broadband providers give you a router, 
but you can turn off the routing 
capabilities so they’re basically just 
a modem and then you can connect 
up your new super router to that box. 
4
How it looks
this is a bit of a weird one, 
but routers aren’t designed to be 
shut in cupboards. they’re designed 
to be front and centre in the home. 
so appearance is important – as it 
should be for any tech you’re about 
to spend a decent wedge of cash on. 
How we 
tested
 First, we recorded 
each device’s peak 
throughput over the 
course of two minutes. 
then we copied a 1tB 
file between two client 
Macs and timed how 
long the file took to 
copy. We repeated 
this twice and took 
the average time. We 
also tested them in 
everyday use, and 
gauged performance 
when we were 20 
metres away with 
numerous walls and 
obstacles in the way.
Higher…

 there are some even 
more expensive routers, 
believe it or not, like the

which we’re going 
to test next issue! 
…or lower?

 In terms of sheer wireless performance, 
there were two that stood out – the Asus 
DSL-AC88U and the TP-Link Archer 
C5400 V2. The D-Link AC3150 came in a 
clear – and very successful – third place in 
our tests. We were really surprised at how 
speedy the file copy times were with all our 
routers but of course all 802.11ac routers 
are very proficient at communicating with just a couple of devices. 
It’s with stacks of devices like iPads, HomeKit tech, Apple TV 
and more that 802.11ac Wave 2 routers really come into their own 
– particularly if you’re streaming Full HD or 4K video content 
around your home. It’s worth pointing out that the Linksys, 
Netgear and Synology will still be capable enough for any 
multi-device home. If you only have a handful of connected 
devices though, it might be worth looking at a more budget 
option for your 802.11ac connectivity needs. 
 The feature set of all these routers is 
impressive – there’s not a lot to choose 
between them, although the cheaper 
Linksys and Netgear don’t have quite 
the same capacity as their more expensive 
brethren. But all have the latest 802.11ac 
Wave 2 standard and all are rather simple 
to set up, even if some of the quick start 
guides are a little lacking in useful detail.
Moving on, there are several striking designs in this test, 
not least the TP-Link Archer and D-Link. The Asus router is also 
a formidable presence, clearly aimed at gamers after ultimate 
performance. The TP-Link is the cleverest design though, with 
the antennae folding really neatly into the unit. Unfortunately, the 
remainder of the units here are quite uninspiring designs, even if 
the Linksys does win in the usability stakes with its clear and 
precise display panel and simple-to-use setup app for iOS. 
 All of these routers offer exceptional 
connectivity options. As we’ve mentioned, 
the Asus offers the bonus of being able 
to connect up to ADSL broadband, 
although this is not a deal-breaker as 
various other 802.11ac routers are available 
with ADSL options. The Asus does also 
offer compatibility with the new G.fast 
standard, though. For wired connections, you’re looking at a 
reasonably standard four Gigabit Ethernet LAN ports across 
all these routers, with an additional WAN Ethernet port for 
connecting to a broadband model. 
In terms of wireless connectivity, there are different speeds on 
offer; at peak performance we found the Asus and TP-Link are the 
best performers, with the Netgear, D-Link, Linksys and Synology 
close behind. But you can’t go wrong with any of these options as 
you can see from the consistently high scoring below.
 At these price points, a USB port for 
file or printer sharing is a given and you 
can share network drives, for example, 
with all these routers. The Synology takes 
this a step further with an SD card slot 
– useful if you have a newer MacBook Pro 
or MacBook which doesn’t have an SD 
card slot (especially considering USB-C 
SD card converters are pretty rare). 
In terms of price, the Linksys and Netgear score high – they 
represent excellent value for money when you consider what 
they’re up against here and the fact that some of the others are 
around £100 more. The TP-Link is a fantastic router, for example, 
but is it worth £95 more than the Netgear? You could also question 
the price hike for the in-between D-Link. The Asus has a similar 
problem and it comes down to whether you want to pay a 
premium to get the very best you can get.

Photolemur
Carbon Copy 
Cloner 5
AI-powered photo editor
Easily create bootable clones
P  
hotolemur takes 
an unusual 
approach to photo 
editing, placing artificial 
intelligence and automatic 
image analysis front and 
centre. It uses them to look 
at the different parts of a 
picture and then apply 12 
‘smart technologies’ to adjust 
various characteristics. 
It’s very straightforward: 
load up one or more pics and 
the software performs its 
analysis. Use the before/after 
slider to see what changes it 
has made. You don’t get 
control over the individual 
processes, but you do get a 
C  
reating a bootable 
clone of your 
startup disk 
can get you out of sticky 
situations if, for example, 
you want to perform a 
clean install of macOS. 
Carbon Copy Cloner does 
more than create bootable 
clones, but that remains its 
core function. And if you’re 
using High Sierra, version 5 
supports that system and its 
new file system, APFS.
This release has a guided 
restore function that walks 
slider that controls the level 
of the whole effect from 0 to 
100%. You can start again if 
you’re not happy, or easily 
export if you are. 
Anyone familiar with 
image editing will recognise 
the collection of processes 
being applied: colour, detail, 
exposure, contrast, dehazing 
and noise reduction, among 
others. The end result is a 
punchier and more vivid 
image. It never pushed the 
you through restoring files 
when you start your Mac 
from a cloned backup. The 
new Cloning Coach watches 
in the background as you 
configure tasks, alerts you 
to potential problems, and 
advises on avoiding them.
Other new features are 
focused on managing tasks. 
The Outlook view displays 
tasks in calendar form that 
makes it easy to see which

image too far in our tests, 
and using the single variable 
slider means you can apply a 
more subtle effect if you like. 
Photolemur works well, 
replicating the kinds of 
changes an experienced 
editor might make, though 
perhaps inevitably without 
the small touches that a more 
detailed eye would pick out. 
Nonetheless, it’s good for 
applying quick fixes to your 
photos. HOlliN JONES
are scheduled. Tasks can 
also be organised in groups. 
Aside from its utility, 
perhaps the best thing about 
the app is its logical interface, 
although there is still room 
to improve. Sometimes tips 
spill off the screen’s edge, 
and on Macs with small 
displays, the window can’t 
be made small enough to see 
them, so you have to drag it 
around. KENNy HEMpHill
 A simple-to-use app

good results when

Lightroom CC
Lightroom moves to the cloud as part of a radical overhaul
 £9.98 per month for Lightroom CC and 1TB cloud storage/£9.98 per month for Photography Plan with Lightroom CC,  
Lightroom Classic CC, Photoshop CC and 20GB cloud storage  FROM Adobe, adobe.co.uk  needs OS X 10.11 or later
L
ightroom has been popular with 
pro photographers for many 
years thanks to its cataloguing 
and editing abilities. The desktop version, 
now called Lightroom Classic CC, is still 
available and little changed from the previous 
version. Co-existing alongside it, however, 
Adobe has released a new, cloud-focused app 
called Lightroom CC. Although it has many of 
the core features of the ‘old’ Lightroom, it’s 
been given the ‘prosumer’ treatment, with 
more advanced tools removed and more focus 
on automatically doing things for you. 
The biggest change is that Lightroom now 
insists on uploading your originals and edits 
to the cloud, with storage space based on your 
subscription tier. There is an option to also 
store originals locally, but not to ignore the 
cloud. So at best you’re keeping one copy on 
your Mac and another online. 
This is good for backup, but professionals 
who regularly shoot hundreds of gigabytes 
of raw images in a month are quickly going 
to have to pay to upgrade their storage. This 
change is mostly aimed at letting you work 
 An impressive 
cloud-focused app; 
advanced users may 
find it a little lacking.
HHHHH 
 Great interface
 Cross-device editing
 Lacks advanced tools
 Limited storage
VERDICT
across devices, and to this end the Lightroom 
app for iOS has been completely overhauled 
as well, with near feature parity with the Mac 
and Windows apps. Uploading to the cloud is 
automatic, so all your devices and edits are 
available on every device.
Keep it clean
All versions now have a stripped-back 
interface with editing and correction tools 
sliding in from various panels. The tools are 
still very good for cropping, tonal and colour 
adjustments and more. While they do go 
beyond the (much improved) tools in Apple’s 
Photos Mac app, many of the more detailed 
tool options are now missing, which will 
trouble professionals.
For hobbyists and home users this is less of 
an issue, and you can still achieve remarkable 
edits and improvements to pictures as well 
as creating albums, adding tags and sharing 
much more easily across all your devices. 
More advanced users, however, will want 
to see more flexibility and fine-grained tools 
return in future updates. HOllin JOnes
Edits remain live across all 
devices. Start working on one 
device, finish on another.

Kaleidoscope 2
Total War — 
Alexander
Spot the difference
World domination is never easy
T  
his is a file-
comparison app 
with a razor-
sharp focus, geared 
towards productivity. 
It’s the kind of thing you’d 
expect on a Mac, not an iPad. 
Throw plain text, Word 
docs, or HTML or other code 
at it and you can quickly spot 
differences in a two-up or 
unified view. The app also 
supports Split View, which 
is just as well, given that it 
lacks the Mac version’s text 
merge feature.
With images, everything 
suddenly feels fiddly. You get 
a number of viewing options: 
T  
his game puts you 
in the sandals of 
Alexander the 
not-yet-Great, and asks 
you to conquer the known 
world within a time limit. 
Apart from the constant 
fear of running out of time, 
little else has changed since 
the series’ previous iPad 
release. Manoeuvre armies 
and recruit new units to gain 
strategic advantage. Bump 
into an opposing army, or lay 
siege to a city, and you’ll be 
dropped into the meat of the 
an A/B switch, a two-up 
scrolling view, a split view 
with a slide bar – and all do 
the job. But the A/B view has 
small buttons and the split 
view slider handles work 
independently, so you can’t 
swipe back and forth across 
the image with a finger.
When it comes to folders, 
importing appears to be an 
issue. Drop a couple of text 
files on Kaleidoscope and 
you’re comparing them 
action – real-time battles in 
which you control individual 
regiments and generals.
The interface has been 
intelligently designed for a 
touchscreen, but without the 
responsiveness of mouse 
control, and a view that 
doesn’t zoom out far enough, 
your micromanagement  can 
become a stop-start affair. 
It’s rather difficult too, 
and that’s a shame. The 
 £19.99  FROM Black Pixel, kaleidoscopeapp.com 
 NEEDS iOS 11 or later
 £4.99  FROM Feral Interactive, feralinteractive.com  
 NEEDS iOS 10.2 or later
almost instantly. Open a 
couple of web archives and 
the app appears to seize up. 
You’ll have more success if 
you reduce folders to a dozen 
items each, but even then 
importing can take a while.
There’s ambition here, 
not only regarding the app 
but also the iPad. Just be 
aware of its limitations, 
and put it through its paces 
during the two-week free 
trial. CRaig gRaNNEll
100-turn limit and its 
associated need to keep 
attacking makes the game 
ideally suited to flights and 
toddler naps. Conflicts are 
suitably epic: seeing so many 
units fighting at once is a fine 
display of iPad power, while 
custom and one-off battles 
add longevity. Sadly, the 
learning curve is likely 
to put off many people. 
iaN EvENDEN
 A solid but

it’s just way too hard.

Procreate 4
Amazing art app gets even better
 £9.99  FROM Savage Interactive, procreate.art  NEEDS iOS 11.1 or later
P  
rocreate is aimed squarely 
at artists – whether dabblers 
or full-time professionals – both 
for finished artwork and visualisation, 
where a scene or character is roughed 
out. So you can get results quickly, but you 
also have the depth and precision to produce 
polished work if you wish.
This is a big update. The neat interface is 
more streamlined than ever, with everything 
clearly and logically laid out in drop-down 
panels accessed from the top toolbar, making 
it easy to switch colours and brushes. The app’s 
developer has also made clever use of gestures, 
so you can find extra settings with a swipe, 
not unlike using keyboard shortcuts.
In the Layers panel, for example, swiping 
a layer to the left reveals options to duplicate, 
lock or delete it. Tapping the selected layer 
pops up a contextual menu with more 
advanced commands, including the new 
ability to add a layer mask. You edit this using 
any of the brushes, painting areas dark to hide 
the contents of the layer. This does need to be 
more sophisticated, but it provides another 
means of non-destructive editing.
That’s one respect in which Procreate still 
feels a little lacking overall. You can undo 
with a two-finger tap, or hold your fingers 
down to wind back as many steps as you want, 
 Procreate is a 
serious creative tool. 
At £9.99 all-in, 
it’s great value.
HHHHH
 Responsive
 Wet paints
 Easy to use
 Strokes and effects 
not editable later
VERDICT
There’s a clever 
use of gestures, 
so you can find 
extra settings 
with a swipe
but there’s no way to edit individual strokes 
or effects later, or change the resolution of 
a canvas. Still, this suits the app’s painterly 
approach, which is enhanced by a new set of 
wet painting brushes. These feel convincingly 
real and interact satisfyingly with any colour 
on the canvas. There’s also a Smudge mode 
that makes any brush act as if it’s being 
dragged over wet paint.
Stylus support
An iPad Pro with an Apple Pencil is the ideal 
setup: both pressure and tilt are supported, 
and you get detailed control over how brushes 
(which include pencils, pens, and airbrushes) 
respond. For other iPads, many Pogo, Jot and 
Wacom active styluses are also supported. 
Even with a basic rubber stylus (or your finger) 
you can get impressive results moving paint 
around to make textures and backgrounds.
On a first-generation iPad Pro, Procreate’s 
new 64-bit graphics engine, using iOS’s Metal 
API, ensures it almost always keeps up 
smoothly with your strokes when working 
at the screen’s native 2048x1536 resolution, or 
even higher. Inevitably, you see some lag on 
slower iPads, but rival painting app ArtRage 
struggles even on iPad Pro with canvases 
large enough for professional work.

 Ever since the famous Bondi Blue iMac 
debuted in August 1998, Apple’s all-in-one 
desktop computer has been setting standards 
in gorgeous design and powerful performance. 
Apple’s innovation was as clear back then as it 
is today – the iMac was the first Macintosh to 
drop the floppy disk in favour of USB, and its 
colourful aesthetic set it apart as a playful 
pretender in a world of staid beige boxes.
Today, Apple is again pushing boundaries 
with the iMac, blessing all of its 27-inch models 
with a massive 5K (5120x2880) resolution and 
a wide P3 colour gamut. Add in Intel Core i5 
and i7 CPUs (configurable from 3.4GHz up to 
4.2GHz), a fast and capacious Fusion Drive, and 
powerful AMD Radeon RX graphics processors, 
and the 27-inch iMac is the desktop system to 
own. At WWDC in June 2017, Apple refreshed 
the entire range of iMacs, with discrete GPUs 
coming to all but the entry-level model, newer 
Intel CPUs, brighter Retina displays and more 
Thunderbolt 3 ports.
 An update in 2014 brought a £100 
price drop to the most affordable 
Mac, but rises in late 2016 added 
£80 back on. The mini comes with 
some interesting talking points: the 
entry-level model has a 1.4GHz dual-
core Intel Core i5 CPU and 4GB of 
memory, making it one of the lowest-
spec Macs around, with a 500GB 
hard drive and no display. 
Higher-end models come with 1TB of 
storage included (Fusion Drive and 
SSD options are available), 8GB of 
memory, a better graphics processor 
and either a 2.6GHz or 2.8GHz Intel 
Core i5 for £679 and £949. Those 
models can be upgraded to a Core 
i7, but there aren’t any quad-core 
options available at the moment. 
Expect updates in 2018.

Apple tips 
From Stormfront, your 
local Apple experts
Split screen
Ellie Otley, Darryl Elkins 
Stormfront.co.uk
In iOS 11, Apple updated the way 
compatible iPads handle multiple 
apps simultaneously. The most 
useful of these is arguably split 
screen. With this facility, you can 
have two apps open on screen, 
provided the apps support it.
Open your first app, and then 
quickly swipe up from the bottom 
of the screen to show the dock. 
Tap and hold the icon for the 
second app then drag this to the 
left or right of the screen and 
release. If done correctly there 
should be a dark grey line down 
the screen; you can then drag 
this line from left to right to 
arrange the windows.  
you can also drag and drop 
text and images from one app to 
another, such as Safari to Mail.  
If the second app floats over the 
first, this is called Slide Over. To 
get the apps in split screen, drag 
down from the top of the floating 
app until you see the split screen 
divider appear.

 The baby of Apple’s laptop family, 
the MacBook was updated at WWDC 
2017 to get Intel Kaby Lake processors 
and faster SSDs. Weighing in at just 
0.92kg, it’s Apple’s most lightweight 
laptop but still packs in a 226ppi pixel 
density in its 12-inch Retina display.
The MacBook is powered by an Intel 
Core M processor (configurable to Core 
i5 or i7), which doesn’t require a fan to 
keep cool, so the MacBook runs silently. 
It also features a Force Touch trackpad, 
which can trigger different responses 
as you apply more pressure. All models 
of the MacBook come loaded with 8GB 
of 1866MHz memory, which can be 
boosted to 16GB, and Intel HD Graphics 
615 – an upgrade from the previous HD 
Graphics 515 – and there are 256GB or 
512GB flash storage options. There are 
four colour options: Silver, Space Grey, 
Gold, and Rose Gold.
 Apple debuted the new MacBook Pro 
in October 2016 with an OLED strip of 
app-specific controls called the Touch 
Bar. The Force Touch trackpad was made 
larger to give more room for gestures, 
and the keyboard was also updated to 
have a second-generation version of the 
butterfly keys from the 12-inch MacBook. 
The MacBook Pro range then got a 
further boost at WWDC 2017, when both 
the 13-inch and 15-inch models had their 
processors updated to Intel’s Kaby Lake 
models. The larger of the two also had 
its graphics card upgraded to give more 
powerful Radeon Pro options.
you get two or four Thunderbolt 3 
ports (depending on the model), which 
are also compatible with USB-C devices, 
and through which you can charge the 
MacBook Pro. The 13-inch and 15-inch 
sizes remain, although the entry-level 
13-inch lacks a Touch Bar.

 Apple always had to do something big 
for the iPhone’s tenth birthday, and it’s 
done that with the iPhone X. Sporting a 
glass back to allow wireless charging and 
a gorgeous edge-to-edge, OLED, Super 
Retina display measuring 5.8 inches 
across, it’s big news all over.
Its better cameras don’t just mean 
great photos – they allow for Face ID, 
the face-scanning technology that is the 
latest, safest way to unlock your phone 
(goodbye Touch ID and Home button).
But don’t let the new kid on the block 
overshadow the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus – 
they’re great phones in their own right. 
They get wireless charging too, plus 
revamped cameras, a new A11 Bionic 
chip, and new augmented reality tech.
All new models come in 64GB and 
256GB capacities. The pricing for the 
iPhone 8 starts at £699, the 8 Plus at 
£799 and the iPhone X at £999.
 Apple shifted the iPad range around in 
March 2017, replacing the iPad Air 2 with 
a 9.7-inch model simply called ‘iPad’. The 
entire Air range has been phased out, 
but the iPad mini 4 is still available.
The 9.7-inch iPad features an A9 CPU 
and M9 motion coprocessor, and comes 
in 32GB and 128GB storage flavours. The 
Retina display has been made brighter 
compared to the Air 2, but the new iPad 
is slightly thicker and heavier. It’s also 
got an 8MP rear camera and a 1.2MP 
front-facing camera.
On the software side, the iPad adds 
multitasking features, which are a boon 
for productivity. you can slide a second 
app over the right side of the one you’re 
working in, then dismiss it to get back to 
work. Picture in Picture enables you to 
watch video in a corner of the screen. 
There’s also Split View, which lets you 
work on two apps side by side.

 The Watch is Apple’s quiet revolution, 
and it’s now the number one watch in 
the world. Series 3 is meant to cement 
that status quo.
To achieve that, Series 3 lets you 
make and receive calls from your wrist 
for the first time – the sci-fi dream is 
now a reality. you can also stream Apple 
Music to the device, giving you one more 
reason to leave your phone at home.
Performance-wise, the processor has 
seen a 70% speed boost, and the new 
W2 wireless chip is far faster and more 
power efficient. All that, yet the case is 
still the same slimline size.
Apple is introducing new colours 
and bands, plus a new dark grey colour 
for the high-end ceramic model.

 If you’re not fussed about 4K but still 
want exceptional image quality, this IPS 
display is truly superb. It offers 99% 
coverage of the Adobe RGB colour space, 
10-bit colour and a 2560x1440-pixel 
resolution. It has HDMI 1.4, DVI and Mini 
DisplayPort connections, and four USB 
3.0 ports for expansion.
 We love this display. At 32 inches 
diagonally it’s big enough to make its  
4K resolution worthwhile, and its colour 
rendering is excellent – 100% of sRGB, 
93% of Adobe RGB and 97% of the P3 
gamut that Apple’s new MacBook Pro 
uses. It’s big, bold, beautiful and superb 
for productivity and colour work alike.
 With two blazing fast Thunderbolt 3 
ports and a 5Gbps USB-C port to boot, the 
Drobo 5D3 can provide you with rapid file 
transfers to and from your Mac. you can 
load it up with up to five HDDs or SSDs of 
differing capacities, giving you plenty of 
flexibility for storage options. It’s pricey, 
but a worthy investment.
 This router has an awful lot going for it. 
The winner of issue 321’s group test, the 
Asus scored an impressive five stars in 
three out of four categories. It performed 
brilliantly in our tests, has excellent 
connectivity (with both Ethernet and 
ADSL options), and it looks great too. It 
will keep your network powered for years.
 The Eco-Tank ET-2600 has a fairly high 
cost, but its innovative cartridge-free 
design will save you a ton of money 
in the long run. It’s got a scanner and 
copier, plus Wi-Fi and USB connectivity. 
Replacement inks are cheap, working out 
at a mere 0.2p per page for mono text, 
and just 0.35p per page for colour.
 The winner of 
MF317’s head-to-head 
review introduces a 
whole new level of 
connectivity to your 
Mac. Equipped with 
two Thunderbolt 3 
ports for blazingly fast 
file transfers, plus many more ports, you 
won’t be lacking options to hook up your 
devices. And it can even charge the latest 
15-inch MacBook Pro.
 This drive is the fastest portable SSD 
we’ve ever tested. Freecom claims its 
write speeds can reach 700MB/sec, but 
in our tests it blazed past that to reach 
713.8MB/sec write speeds and 907.3MB/
sec read speeds, thanks to its USB 3.1 
Gen 2 capability. It’s costly, but worth 
it if you feel the need for speed.

 Despite that silly-
looking hump on its 
back, the official battery 
case for the iPhone 7 is 
rather impressive. It’s 
easy to fit, the buttons 
feel great, and the soft 
inner lining protects 
against scratches. It isn’t the largest 
capacity case, yet it has more than 
enough juice for busy days, and the 
bump is surprisingly comfy.

you’re recording an interview, creating 
a podcast or just jamming with your 
band, its clarity and depth makes it 
easy to recommend.

 It’s hard not to love 
Affinity Photo. Whether 
you’re fancy yourself 
a seasoned pro or a 
photo novice, you will 
find it powerful and 
easy to use. Its interface has the perfect 
blend of ease of use and quick access to 
powerful features, and its useful batch 
processing is a great addition. An app 
that packs both power and practicality 
for less than £50? We’re in!
 Apple’s Final Cut Pro 
has always been a good 
option for video editors, 
but the latest version 
makes it even better. 
It introduces ‘roles’, 
which can be colour-coded to make your 
timeline’s components easier to navigate, 
something that’s further boosted by the 
streamlined interface. It supports the 
Touch Bar, too, plus wide colour on the 
new MacBook Pro.
 Ever since Apple 
stopped updating iWeb, 
Mac users have been 
searching for the ideal 
replacement. Well look 
no further – it’s 
RapidWeaver. Don’t know code? no 
worries, RapidWeaver lets you design 
visually if you want to. you can build any 
type of page and publish to any type of 
platform, and extend its functions with 
thousands of addons.
 Different people often 
need different things 
from a writing app, 
but Scrivener handles 
so many things 
expertly. The winner 
of MF319’s group test has templates for 
scripts, short stories, novels and much 
more, allowing you to quickly get stuck 
in. That means it’s great value for 
money given its unrivalled flexibility. 
It’s the writer’s writing tool.
 When disaster strikes 
and your hard drive 
fails, having a backup 
can be a lifesaver. This 
app makes creating and 
restoring from backups 
an absolute breeze. It comes with a helpful 
guided restore feature, plus a Cloning 
Coach that monitors what you do and 
looks out for potential problems. If you’re 
looking to clone or back up your hard 
drive, this is the app you need.
 When it comes to 
making music on your 
Mac, djay Pro is our 
favourite app by far. It 
comes with everything 
you need to make 
amazing professional music, from 
coloured waveforms to a four-deck view 
and even true-to-life grooves on the 
virtual records. It integrates neatly with 
Spotify, and its MacBook Pro Touch Bar 
integration is very handy.
 Feeling inbox anxiety? 
The solution could be 
Spark, a free email app 
for Mac and iOS. It’s 
centred on a ‘smart 
inbox’, which prioritises 
your emails based on importance – no 
more losing that vital work email among 
a sea of spam. you can snooze emails 
and be reminded of them later, and 
search via natural language too. And 
to top it all off, it’s free.
 If you find your 
calendar and reminders 
are getting out of 
control, Fantastical is 
the app for you. It 
supports natural 
language entry, so that you can enter 
events and reminders as you would speak 
and Fantastical will get to work. It’s got a 
nifty menu bar window, plus a great 
interface, clever calendar management 
and a powerful iOS app to boot.
 Despite strong 
competition from the 
likes of Tidal, Apple 
Music and Amazon, 
Spotify is our top music-
streaming choice. It hits 
all the right notes, from its fair price to its 
curated playlists. Its library is one of the 
largest on the market, and its interface is 
simple and straightforward to use. And, 
unlike Apple Music and Tidal, it has a free 
tier as well.

Apple

New York Apple Store
Written by Graham Barlow 
The iMac SE brought CD 
burning to the masses with 
a built-in CD-RW drive.
The CD-ROM 
revolution
 The original (Bondi 
Blue) iMac from 1998 
was groundbreaking 
because it dropped the 
floppy drive in favour of 
a USB port, but it was 
the iMac SE, called the 
‘Flower Power’ iMac, 
from early 2001 that 
had the capability to 
burn its own CDs with 
a 24x/8x/4x CD-RW 
drive. The 24x was the 
read speed, the 8x was 
the CD-R write speed 
and the 4x was the 
rewrite speed. CD-R 
discs were now cheap 
enough for people 
to afford, and CD-RW 
discs, which could be 
rewritten, were also 
affordable as storage, 
although not as reliable 
for backing up as a hard 
drive. CD-Rs could 
easily be scratched, like 
regular CD-ROM discs.
The first 
floppy disk
 Floppy disks 
offered computer 
users data storage 
in the guise of thin, 
flexible magnetic units 
enclosed in rectangular 
plastic cases. They 
were developed in the 
late 1960s and became 
ubiquitous for personal 
computers before 
being superseded 
by higher-capacity 
USB flash drives and 
CD-ROM discs. The 
popular 1.44MB High 
Density floppy disk was 
introduced in 1987.
Floppy disks commonly 
came in 8-inch, 5.25-inch, 
and 3.5-inch sizes.
The Zip disk 
 The Zip drive was 
introduced by Iomega 
in 1994. It proved really 
popular because it 
offered a disk capacity 
of 100MB – perfectly 
filling a niche market 
for more storage than 
a standard floppy 
provided. Capacities 
reached 750MB but, 
by the early 2000s, the 
Zip disks’ time was up.

June 1977
 Apple launches 
the Apple II, which 
initially had an audio 
cassette interface for 
storing data. Apple 
recommended using 
the Panasonic RQ309 
in some of its early 
documentation. 
October 1991 
 Apple released the 
PowerBook 140 (as 
well as two other 
models) with 20 to 
80MB hard drives.
February 2008 
 While you could plug 
a hard drive into an 
Airport Extreme, Time 
Capsule in 2008 was 
Apple’s first network 
storage device, 
enabling you to back 
up your Mac to a hard 
drive over Wi-Fi.
October 2010
 The super-slim 
MacBook Air was 
Apple’s poster child for 
an SSD in a laptop. The 
MacBook Air option 
with a 64GB SSD drive 
was expensive, but fast.  
Apple went on to 
introduce flash storage 
to the MacBook Pro 
and MacBook range.
T
he way we store data has changed radically 
from the early days of home computing to the 
modern era. From early data cassette storage on 
the Apple II in 1977 to the solid-state drive of the latest 
MacBook Pro, storage has gone through something of a 
physical and price revolution. Here we track the changes. 
1987 onwards 
 Apple started 
introducing built-in 
hard drives with the 
Macintosh SE range. 
Hard-drive equipped 
models had a 20MB 
SCSI hard disk. Of 
course, it was possible 
to attach them 
externally before that.
Apple storage history
From the humble floppy to the latest Fusion Drive
June 2007 
 As well as breaking 
new ground in smart- 
phones, the iPhone 
started Apple’s love 
affair with flash 
storage. Fast solid- 
state drives later 
found their way into 
the MacBook range.
January 1984
 The original 
Macintosh 128K had 
a 3.5-inch internal 
floppy drive. 
It contained the 
disk-based MacOS 
system, but could be 
safely ejected once 
the computer was 
turned on, so you 
could use the drive 
for other things. 
October 2012 
 Introduced on the 
2012 iMac and Mac 
mini, a Fusion drive 
is Apple’s name for 
a hybrid drive that 
combines an SSD of 
24GB or more with 
a hard disk drive 
and presents it as a 
one combined unit.
