You see, wire telegraph is a kind of a very, very long cat. You pull his tail in 
New York and his head is meowing in Los Angeles. Do you understand this? 
And radio operates exactly the same way: you send signals here, they receive 
them there. The only difference is there is no cat.

I’m grateful to everybody at No Starch Press for their help and advice as this 
book moved from idea to print. In particular, Tyler Ortman, Megan Dunchak, 
Michael Kershaw, and Riley Hoffman have made this a much better book 
than it would have been without their attention. Any remaining faults in the 
book are, of course, my responsibility.
Thanks also to Georgia Taylor at Verizon Wireless and Helen Chung at 
Clearwire, who allowed me to borrow equipment and use their networks, 
and to all the manufacturers and software developers who allowed us to use 
photographs of their hardware and software.


I N T R O D U C T I O N
This is a book for people who want to use 
the Internet everywhere—not just in the 
office or in the room at home where there’s a 
telephone or cable connection, but in the backyard, 
at the public library, at a highway rest area, or in a hotel 
lobby. In this book you will learn how to choose the 
best wireless data service for your particular needs, how to set up your com-
puter for wireless, and how to design and install your own wireless network. 
We’ll also describe some wireless products and services that you might not 
have known about, such as the ability to make low-cost, worldwide Voice over 
Internet (VoIP) telephone calls from your laptop computer.
The combination of wireless Internet services and portable computers 
can make a huge difference in the way we use the Internet. By eliminating 
the tether to a wired network, we can gather information, watch and listen 
to streaming video or audio, and exchange messages wherever we might be, 
rather than only at specific locations. It’s no longer necessary to return home 
or to the office or search for an Internet café or a public library. Like mobile 
telephones (which use related technology), go-anywhere, always-accessible 

xx
Introduction
Internet services can change the way we live, work, and entertain ourselves. 
When wireless broadband Internet services work properly, they’re practically 
invisible; just turn on the computer or a smaller portable device such as a 
smartphone, and a universe of information is immediately at your fingertips. 
But we’re talking about computers, so complications are always possible. In 
order to help you identify the causes and solutions for wireless connection 
problems, the first few chapters of this book offer details about how wireless 
data communication systems work, including the surprising tale of the avant-
garde composer and the glamorous actress whose wartime invention provided 
the foundation of modern spread-spectrum technology. 
As you read this book, I hope you will remember that a wireless network, 
and for that matter, any kind of communications technology, is a means to 
an end that you use to achieve some other objective. Remember that your 
original goal was to find out if your favorite team won, invite your friends to a 
dinner party, read your class notes, or watch the latest YouTube videos. If you 
have to concentrate on making your wireless connection, you’re doing some-
thing wrong.
You’re in control. The computer and the network should do things the 
way you want to do them, rather than forcing you to adjust your life or work 
to meet the machine’s requirements. If you have trouble making your wire-
less connection (or any other computer activity) work “properly,” it’s almost 
always the computer’s fault, or the fault of the people who designed the 
hardware and software. The computer and the network are your servants, 
and not the other way around.
New wireless network products and services are appearing all the time, 
so the information in this book represents a snapshot of a moving target. 
Within another year or two, manufacturers will have replaced some of the 
products described here with new and better models, and the wireless service 
providers will offer faster connections over wider areas. The specific makes 
and models will change, but the general principles ought to remain.
The first edition of this book, The Book of Wi-Fi, was limited to 802.11b 
Wi-Fi networks, which were the only practical choice when that book was 
published in 2003. When I wrote that book, I expected Wi-Fi networks to 
replace or supplement wired home and office networks, but I did not anti-
cipate that a huge number of additional Wi-Fi hot spots would also cover 
public locations. In my Seattle neighborhood, I can connect my laptop com-
puter to the Internet at a branch library, half a dozen coffee shops, three 
taverns, four pizza joints, and a supermarket. Today, Wi-Fi signals are every-
where, and other broadband services offer wireless signals that cover much 
wider areas than any Wi-Fi network. A few years from now, more and better 
wireless services will offer even faster connections. The dream of a high-
speed wireless service that works almost everywhere is rapidly coming true.

Introduction
xxi
The first three chapters of this book explain how data networks operate, 
how wireless technology can extend data networks beyond the reach of 
wired connections, and how Wi-Fi networks work. Next, Chapter 4 describes 
the hardware needed for Wi-Fi and how to design and install your own 
Wi-Fi network. Chapters 5 and 6 provide the information you need to use 
a Wi-Fi network to connect to the Internet from a computer running 
Microsoft Windows. Chapter 7 covers Wi-Fi clients for the Linux and 
Unix operating systems, and Chapter 8 provides similar information for 
Macintosh OS X. Chapter 9 explains how to install and configure Wi-Fi 
access points, and Chapter 10 covers long-range, point-to-point Wi-Fi links. 
Chapters 11 and 12 cover connecting to existing Wi-Fi networks and Wi-Fi 
security.
In Chapter 13, we’ll move away from Wi-Fi and describe some alter-
native broadband wireless services, including EV-DO, EDGE, and WiMAX. 
Chapter 14 explains how to use Wi-Fi and broadband services with smart-
phones and other pocket-size computers, Chapter 15 describes virtual private 
networks (VPNs), and Chapter 16 explains how to use wireless links to place 
telephone calls through the Internet. Finally, Chapter 17 offers trouble-
shooting tips and general advice.
Most readers won’t read this book from cover to cover, but you’ll probably 
find something you can use in every chapter. In particular, please don’t ignore 
the chapters on security and VPNs—they contain essential information that 
can keep your network and your data safe. If all your computers use Windows, 
you can skip the Linux/Unix and Macintosh chapters.
If I have done my job as author, this book will improve your experience 
with Wi-Fi and other wireless data services. I hope it will help you understand 
how data moves through the air between your computer and the Internet 
and how to set up and use your own system for best performance. After your 
wireless connection is ready to use, you shouldn’t have to think about the 
network at all. Along the way, I hope you enjoy both the book and your time 
online.

Broadband wireless networks are one 
more step toward the Internet’s ultimate 
destiny of interconnecting everything in the 
known universe. 
A wireless network combines two kinds of communication technology: 
data networks that make it possible to share information among two or more 
computers, and radio (or wireless) communication that uses electromagnetic 
radiation to move information from one place to another. 
The earliest Wi-Fi systems provided a convenient way to connect a laptop 
computer to an office network and to connect computers to a home network 
without stringing cables between rooms. Today, Wi-Fi and other broadband 
services allow millions of users to connect to the Internet when they’re away 
from their homes or offices, as wireless signals cover entire metropolitan areas. 
A variety of products and services use different methods to accomplish 
essentially the same objective: wirelessly exchanging network data using radio 
signals. Each service has a somewhat different set of features, and each uses 
a slightly different technology. The three most widely used systems are Wi-Fi, 
WiMAX, and 3G cellular service.

Chapter 1
The next chapter explains how these three broadband wireless networks 
work. But before we go into detail about specific wireless data network services, 
it will be helpful to understand networks in more general terms.
Moving Data Around
To begin, let’s review the general structure of computer data and the methods 
that networks use to move data from one place to another. This is very basic 
stuff that might already be familiar to you, but bear with me for a few pages. 
This really will help you to understand how a wireless network operates.
Bits and Bytes
As you probably know, the processing unit of a computer can recognize only 
two information states: either a signal is present or not present at the input to 
the processor. These two conditions are usually described as 1 and 0, on and 
off, or mark and space. Each instance of a 1 or a 0 is a bit.
The form that each 1 or 0 takes varies in different types of communication 
channels. It can be a light, a sound, or an electrical charge that is either on 
or off, a series of long and short sounds or light flashes, two different audio 
tones, or two different radio frequencies.
Individual bits are not particularly useful, but when you string 8 of them 
together into a byte, you can have 256 different combinations. That’s enough 
to assign different sequences to all the letters in the alphabet (both upper- 
and lowercase), the 10 digits from 0 to 9, spaces between words, and other 
symbols such as punctuation marks and letters used in foreign alphabets. 
A modern computer recognizes and processes several 8-bit bytes at the same 
time. When processing is complete, the computer transmits the same stream 
of bits at its output. The output might be connected to a printer, a video 
display, or a data communication channel. Or it might be something else 
entirely, such as a series of flashing lights. Figure 1-1 is an example of a 
sequence of bits.
Figure 1-1: These bits form the sequence of A (01000001) and n (01101110).
The inputs and outputs that we’re concerned about here are the ones 
that form a communication circuit. Like the computer processor, a data 
channel can recognize only one bit at a time. Either there’s a signal on the 
line or there isn’t.
However, over short distances, it’s possible to send the data through a 
cable that carries eight (or some multiple of eight) signals in parallel through 
eight separate wires. Obviously, a parallel connection can be eight times 
faster than sending one bit through a single wire, but those eight wires cost 
eight times as much as a single wire. That added cost is insignificant when 
the wires are only a foot or two long, but when you’re trying to send the data 
over a long distance, that additional cost can be prohibitive. And when you’re

using existing circuits, such as telephone lines, you don’t have any choice; 
you must find a way to send all eight bits through the existing pair of wires 
(or other media). The solution is to transmit one bit at a time with some 
additional bits and pauses that identify the beginning of each new byte. This 
is a serial data communication channel, which means that you’re sending bits 
one after another. At this stage, it doesn’t matter what medium you use to 
transmit those bits—it could be electrical impulses on a wire, two different 
audio tones, a series of flashing lights, or even a lot of notes attached to 
the legs of carrier pigeons—but you must have a method for converting the 
output of the computer to the signals used by the transmission medium and 
converting it back again at the other end.
Error Checking
In a perfect transmission circuit, the signal that goes in at one end will be 
absolutely identical to the one that comes out at the other end. But in the 
real world, there’s almost always some kind of noise that can interfere with 
our original pure signal. Noise is defined as anything that is added to the 
original signal; it could be caused by a lightning strike, interference from 
another communication channel, or dirt on an electrical contact someplace 
in the circuit (or in the case of those carrier pigeons, an attack by a marauding 
hawk). Whatever the source, noise in the channel can interrupt the flow of 
data. In a modern communication system, those bits are pouring through 
the circuit extremely quickly—millions of them every second—so a noise hit 
for even a fraction of a second can obliterate enough bits to turn your data 
into digital gibberish.
Therefore, you must include a process called error checking in your data 
stream. Error checking is accomplished by adding some kind of standard 
information to each byte. In a simple computer data network, the hand-
shaking information (described in the next section) is called the parity bit, 
which tells the device receiving each byte whether the sum of the ones and 
zeroes inside the byte is odd or even. If the receiving device discovers that the 
parity bit is not what it expected, it instructs the transmitter to send the same 
byte again. This value is called a checksum. More complex networks, including 
wireless systems, include additional error checking handshaking data with 
each string of data.
Handshaking
Of course, the computer that originates a message or a stream of data can’t 
just jump online and start sending bytes. First it has to warn the device at 
the other end that it is ready to send data and make sure that the intended 
recipient is ready to accept data. To accomplish this, a series of handshaking 
requests and answers must surround the actual data.
The sequence of requests goes something like this:
Origin: “Hey destination! I have some data for you.”
Destination: “Okay, origin, go ahead. I’m ready.”

4
Chapter 1
Origin: “Here comes the data.”
Origin: Data data data data . . . checksum
Origin: “That’s the message. Did you get it?”
Destination: “I got something, but it appears to be damaged.”
Origin: “Here it is again.”
Origin: Data data data data . . . checksum
Origin: “Did you get it that time?”
Destination: “Yup, I got it. I’m ready for more data.”
We can leave the specific contents of the handshaking information to 
the network designers and engineers, but it’s important to understand that 
every bit that moves through a computer data network is not part of the 
original information that arrived at the input computer. In a complex 
network, such as a wireless data channel, as much as 40 percent or more of 
the transmitted data is handshaking and other overhead. It’s all essential, 
but every one of those bits increases the amount of time that the message 
needs to move through the network.
Finding the Destination
Communication over a direct physical connection (e.g., a wired connection) 
between the origin and destination doesn’t need to include any kind of 
address or routing information as part of the message. You might have to set 
up the connection first (by placing a telephone call or plugging cables into a 
switchboard), but after you’re connected, the link remains in place until you 
instruct the system to disconnect. This kind of connection is great for voice 
and simple data links, but it’s not efficient for digital data on a complex net-
work that serves many origins and destinations because a single connection 
ties up the circuit all the time, even when no data is moving through the 
channel. 
The alternative is to send your message to a switching center that will 
hold it until a link to the destination becomes available. This is known as a 
store and forward system. If the network has been properly designed for the 
type of data and the amount of traffic in the system, the waiting time will be 
insignificant. If the communication network covers a lot of territory, you can 
forward the message to one or more intermediate switching centers before it 
reaches its ultimate destination. The great advantage of this approach is that 
many messages can share the same circuits on an as-available basis.
To make the network even more efficient, you can divide messages 
that are longer than some arbitrary limit into separate pieces called packets. 
Packets from more than one message can travel together on the same circuit, 
reassemble themselves into the original messages at the destination, and 
combine with packets that contain other messages as they travel between

switching centers. Each data packet must also contain another set of infor-
mation: the address of the packet’s destination, the sequence of the packet 
relative to other packets in the original transmission, and so forth. Some 
of this information instructs the switching centers where to forward each 
packet, and other information tells the destination device how to reassemble 
the data in the packet back into the original message.
That same pattern is repeated every time you add another layer of activity 
to a communication system. Each layer can attach additional information to 
the original message and strip off that information after it has done what-
ever the added information instructed it to do. By the time a message travels 
from a laptop computer on a wireless network through a local area network 
(LAN) and an Internet gateway to a distant computer that is connected to 
another LAN, a dozen or more information attachments might be added 
and removed before the recipient reads the original text. A package of data 
that includes address and control information ahead of the bits that contain 
the content of the message, followed by an error-checking sequence, is called 
a frame. Both wired and wireless networks divide the data stream into frames 
that contain various forms of handshaking information along with the original 
data.
It might be helpful to think of these bits, bytes, packets, and frames as 
the digital version of a letter that you send through a complicated mail 
delivery system:
1.
You write a letter and put it into an envelope. The name and address of 
the recipient is on the outside of the envelope.
2.
You take the letter to the mail room, where a clerk puts your envelope 
into a bigger Express Mail envelope. The big envelope has the name and 
address of the office where the recipient works.
3.
The mail room clerk takes the big envelope to the post office where 
another clerk puts it into a mail sack. The post office attaches a tag to 
the sack, marked with the location of the post office that serves the 
recipient’s office.
4.
The mail sack travels on a truck to the airport, where it is loaded into a 
shipping container along with other sacks going to the same destination 
city. The shipping container has a label that tells the freight handlers 
there’s mail inside.
5.
The freight handlers place the container inside an airplane.
6.
At this point, your letter is inside your envelope, which is inside the 
Express Mail envelope, which is inside a mail sack, inside a container, 
inside an airplane. The airplane flies to another airport near the desti-
nation city.
7.
At the destination airport, the ground crew unloads the container from 
the airplane.

6
Chapter 1
8.
The freight handlers remove the sack from the shipping container and 
put it on another truck.
9.
The truck takes the sack to a post office near the recipient’s office.
10. At the post office, another mail clerk takes the big envelope out of the 
sack and gives it to a letter carrier.
11. The letter carrier delivers the big Express Mail envelope to the recipient’s 
office.
12. The receptionist in the office takes your envelope out of the Express 
Mail envelope and gives it to the recipient.
13. The recipient opens your envelope and reads the letter.
At each step, the information on the outside of the package tells some-
body how to handle it, but that person doesn’t care what’s inside. Neither 
you nor the person who ultimately reads your letter ever sees the big Express 
Mail envelope, the mail sack, the truck, the container, or the airplane, but 
every one of those containers plays an important part in moving your letter 
from here to there. 
Instead of envelopes, sacks, containers, and airplanes, an electronic 
message uses strings of data at the beginning or end of each packet to tell 
the system how and where to handle your message, but the end result is just 
about the same. In the OSI network model (described in the next section), 
each mode of transportation is a separate layer.
Fortunately, the network software adds and removes all of the preambles, 
addresses, checksums, and other information automatically so you and the 
person receiving your message never see them. 
However, each item added to the original data increases the size of the 
packet, frame, or other package, and therefore increases the amount of time 
necessary to transmit the data through the network. Because the nominal 
data transfer speed includes all the overhead information along with the data 
in your original message, the actual data transfer speed through a wireless net-
work is a lot slower than the nominal speed. In other words, even if your 
network connects at 11Mbps, your actual file transfer speed might only be 
about 6 or 7Mbps or even less. That sounds like a huge slowdown, but it 
really doesn’t matter in a Wi-Fi network that’s connected to the Internet 
through a 1.5Mbps DSL line or even a 5Mbps cable modem; your wireless 
link is still able to handle data transfer more quickly than the DSL or cable 
modem can provide it. On the other hand, if you’re using Wi-Fi with an ultra-
fast fiber optic connection to the Internet, or if you want to move very large 
audio, video, or CAD files around your own local network, you will want to 
use one of the faster Wi-Fi versions, either 802.11g or (when it becomes 
available) 802.11n.

The ISO OSI Model
As the package delivery example demonstrates, the information itself is only 
part of the process. When information moves across a network, it’s essential 
that all of the parties involved—the originator, the ultimate recipient, and 
everything in between—agree that they will use the same formatting, timing, 
and routing rules and specifications. These rules (also called protocols) define 
the network’s internal “plumbing” and the form of the information that 
moves through it.
As network communication has become more complex, the community 
of network designers has accepted the International Organization for Stand-
ardization’s (ISO) Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model to identify 
the individual elements of a network link. The OSI model applies to just 
about any kind of data communication system, including the broadband 
wireless network that will be described in the rest of this book.
Because everybody in the communication industry uses the OSI model, 
it encourages hardware and software designers to create systems and services 
that can exchange information with similar products from other manufac-
turers. Without the OSI model or something like it, it would not be possible 
to expect equipment from more than one source to work together.
The OSI model also allows a designer to change just one element of the 
network without the need to design everything else from scratch. For example, 
a wireless network uses radio signals instead of cables at the physical layer 
The Physical Layer
As the name suggests, the physical layer defines the physical media or hardware 
that carries signals between the end points of a network connection. The 
physical layer might be a coaxial cable, a pair of telephone wires, flashing 
lights, or radio waves. 
and adds routing information at the data link 
layer, but it keeps the existing protocols and 
specifications for everything else. A complex 
network (such as the Internet) can use wired 
connections for one part of the signal path 
and wireless connections for another.
The OSI model is usually portrayed as a 
stack of seven layers with each layer acting as 
a foundation for the layer directly above it as 
shown in Figure 1-2. 
Starting at the bottom, the seven layers of 
the OSI model are described in the following 
sections.
Figure 1-2: The OSI network 
model has seven layers.

Chapter 1
The specifications of a network’s physical layer might include the shape 
of the shell and the pin numbers in a cable connector, the voltages that 
define the 0 and 1 (on and off) values, the durations of individual data bits, 
and the radio frequencies and modulation methods used by a radio trans-
mitter and receiver.
The Data Link Layer
The data link layer handles transmission of data across the link defined by the 
physical layer. It specifies the format of each data packet that moves across 
the network, including the destination of each packet, the physical structure 
of the network, the sequence of packets (to make sure that the packets arrive 
in the correct order), and the type of flow control (to make sure that the 
transmitter doesn’t send data faster than the receiver can handle it). Each 
packet also includes a checksum that the receiver uses to confirm that the 
data was not corrupted during transmission, as well as the string of bits and 
bytes that contains the actual data inside the packet. Therefore, it contains 
the software that creates and interprets the signals that move through the 
physical layer.
In both wired and wireless Ethernet, every physical device that is con-
nected to the network has a unique 48-bit media access control (MAC) address 
that identifies it to the network. The header (the first part of the data string 
inside of a packet) includes the MAC addresses of both the origin and des-
tination of that packet.
The Network Layer
The network layer specifies the route that a signal uses to move from the source 
to the destination independently of the physical media. At the network level, 
it doesn’t matter whether the data moves through a cable, radio waves, or if it 
uses some combination of both because that’s all handled at a lower level. 
Within the Internet, the exchange of data between LANs, wide area 
networks (WANs), and the core Internet trunk circuits occurs at the network 
layer.
The Transport Layer
Starting at the transport layer, the OSI model is concerned with communica-
tion between programs on two different computers rather than the process 
of moving data from point A to point B. For example, when you view a web 
page on the Internet, the connection between the browser on your computer 
(such as Internet Explorer or Firefox) and the webserver that contains that 
page occurs at the transport layer (but the commands you send to the server 
occur at the application layer).

Introduction to Networking
9
The Session Layer
The session layer defines the format that the programs connected through the 
transport layer use to exchange data. If the programs use passwords or other 
authentication to assure that the program at the distant end of the connection 
is allowed to use a local program, that authentication happens in the session 
layer.
The Presentation Layer
The presentation layer controls the way each computer handles text, audio, 
video, and other data formats. For example, if a distant computer sends a 
picture in JPEG format, the software that converts the data string to a picture 
on a monitor or a printer operates at the presentation layer.
The Application Layer
The application layer handles the commands and data that move through the 
network. For example, when you send an email message, the content of your 
message (but not the address or the formatting information) is in the applica-
tion layer. Most of the words, pictures, sounds, and other forms of information 
that you send through a network enter the system through the application 
layer. 
Summary
In general, data networks have evolved over the last 100 years from very 
simple (and relatively slow) telegraph services to today’s complex high-
speed communication systems. One of the most important improvements 
in networking has been to replace many of the wires and cables that connect 
individual users to the worldwide network grid (also known as the Internet) 
with radio signals. Chapter 2 explains how to combine traditional network 
services with wireless signaling.

Up to a point, it’s quite possible to treat 
your wireless network as a set of black boxes 
that you can turn on and use without knowing 
much about the way they work. That’s the way 
most people relate to the technology that surrounds 
them. You shouldn’t have to worry about the technical specifications just to 
place a long-distance telephone call or heat your lunch in a microwave oven 
or connect your laptop computer to a network. In an ideal world (ha!), the 
wireless link would work as soon as you turn on the power switch.
But wireless networking today is about where broadcast radio was in 
the late 1920s. The technology was out there for everybody, but the people 
who understood what was happening behind that Bakelite-Dilecto panel 
(Figure 2-1) often got better performance than the ones who just expected 
to turn on the power switch and listen.
In order to make the most effective use of wireless networking tech-
nology, it’s still important to understand what’s going on inside the box 
(or in this case, inside each of the boxes that make up the network). This

Chapter 2
chapter describes the standards and specifications that control wireless 
networks and explains how data moves through the network from one 
computer to another.
Figure 2-1: Every new technology goes through the tweak-
and-fiddle stage.
When the network is working properly, you should be able to use it with-
out thinking about all of that internal plumbing—just click a few icons and 
you’re connected. But when you’re designing and building a new network, 
or when you want to improve the performance of an existing network, it can 
be essential to understand how all that data is supposed to move from one 
place to another. And when the network does something you aren’t expecting 
it to do, you will need a basic knowledge of the technology to do any kind of 
useful troubleshooting.
How Wireless Networks Work
Moving data through a wireless network involves three separate elements: 
the radio signals, the data format, and the network structure. Each of these 
elements is independent of the other two, so you must define all three

when you invent a new network. In terms of the OSI reference model, the 
radio signal operates at the physical layer, and the data format controls 
several of the higher layers. The network structure includes the wireless 
network interface adapters and base stations that send and receive the radio 
signals. In a wireless network, the network interface adapters in each computer 
and base station convert digital data to radio signals, which they transmit to 
other devices on the same network, and they receive and convert incoming 
radio signals from other network elements back to digital data. 
Each of the broadband wireless data services use a different combination 
of radio signals, data formats, and network structure. We’ll describe each 
type of wireless data network in more detail later in this chapter, but first, 
it’s valuable to understand some general principles.
Radio
The basic physical laws that make radio possible are known as Maxwell’s 
equations, identified by James Clerk Maxwell in 1864. Without going into the 
math, Maxwell’s equations show that a changing magnetic field will produce 
an electric field, and a changing electric field will produce a magnetic field. 
When alternating current (AC) moves through a wire or other physical 
conductor, some of that energy escapes into the surrounding space as an 
alternating magnetic field. That magnetic field creates an alternating electric 
field in space, which in turn creates another magnetic field and so forth until 
the original current is interrupted.
This form of energy in transition between electricity and magnetic energy 
is called electromagnetic radiation, or radio waves. Radio is defined as the radiation 
of electromagnetic energy through space. A device that produces radio waves 
is called a transmitter, and a complementary device that detects radio waves in 
the air and converts them to some other form of energy is called a receiver. 
Both transmitters and receivers use specially shaped devices called antennas to 
focus the radio signal in a particular direction, or pattern, and to increase the 
amount of effective radiation (from a transmitter) or sensitivity (in a receiver).
By adjusting the rate at which alternating current flows from each trans-
mitter through the antenna and out into space (the frequency), and by adjusting 
a receiver to operate only at that frequency, it’s possible to send and receive 
many different signals, each at a different frequency, that don’t interfere 
with one another. The overall range of frequencies is known as the radio 
spectrum. A smaller segment of the radio spectrum is often called a band.
Radio frequencies and other AC signals are expressed as cycles per 
second, or hertz (Hz), named for Heinrich Hertz, the first experimenter to 
send and receive radio waves. One cycle is the distance from the peak of an 
AC signal to the peak of the next signal. Radio signals generally operate at 
frequencies in thousands, millions, or billions of hertz (kilohertz or KHz, 
megahertz or MHz, and gigahertz or GHz, respectively).
The simplest type of radio communication uses a continuous signal that 
the operator of the transmitter interrupts to divide the signal into accepted 
patterns of long and short signals (dots and dashes) that correspond to 

14
Chapter 2
individual letters and other characters. The most widely used set of these 
patterns was Morse code, named for the inventor of the telegraph, Samuel 
F.B. Morse, where this code was first used. 
In order to transmit speech, music, and other sounds via radio, the trans-
mitter alters, or modulates, the AC signal (the carrier wave) by either mixing 
an audio signal with the carrier as shown in Figure 2-2 (this is called amplitude 
modulation, or AM) or by modulating the frequency within a narrow range 
as shown in Figure 2-3 (this is called frequency modulation, or FM). The AM or 
FM receiver includes a complementary circuit that separates the carrier from 
the modulating signal.
Figure 2-2: In an AM signal, the audio modulates the carrier.
Figure 2-3: In an FM signal, the audio modulates the radio frequency.
Because two or more radio signals using the same frequency can often 
interfere with one another, government regulators and international agencies, 
such as the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), have reserved 
certain frequencies for specific types of modulation, and they issue exclusive 
licenses to individual users. For example, an FM radio station might be 
licensed to operate at 92.1 MHz at a certain geographical location. Nobody 
else is allowed to use that frequency in close enough proximity to interfere 
with that signal. On the other hand, some radio services don’t require a 
license. Most unlicensed services are either restricted to very short distances, 
to specific frequency bands, or both. 
Both AM and FM are analog methods because the signal that comes out 
of the receiver is a replica of the signal that went into the transmitter. When 
we send computer data through a radio link, it’s digital because the content 
has been converted from text, computer code, sounds, images or other infor-
mation into ones and zeroes before it is transmitted, and it is converted back 
to its original form after it is received. Digital radio can use any of several 
different modulation methods: The ones and zeroes can be two different 
audio tones, two different radio frequencies, timed interruptions to the 
carrier, or some combination of those and other techniques.

Wireless Data Networks
Each type of wireless data network operates on a specific set of radio fre-
quencies. For example, most Wi-Fi networks operate in a special band of 
radio frequencies around 2.4 GHz that have been reserved in most parts of 
the world for unlicensed point-to-point spread spectrum radio services. Other 
Wi-Fi systems use a different unlicensed band around 5 GHz. 
Unlicensed Radio Services
Unlicensed means that anybody using equipment that complies with the tech-
nical requirements can send and receive radio signals on these frequencies 
without a radio station license. Unlike most radio services (including other 
broadband wireless services), which require licenses that grant exclusive use 
of that frequency to a specific type of service and to one or more specific 
users, an unlicensed service is a free-for-all where everybody has an equal 
claim to the same airwaves. In theory, the technology of spread spectrum 
radio makes it possible for many users to co-exist (up to a point) without 
significant interference.
Point-to-Point
A point-to-point radio service operates a communication channel that carries 
information from a transmitter to a single receiver. The opposite of point-to-
point is a broadcast service (such as a radio or television station) that sends the 
same signal to many receivers at the same time.
Spread Spectrum
Spread spectrum is a family of methods for transmitting a single radio signal 
using a relatively wide segment of the radio spectrum. Wireless Ethernet 
networks use several different spread spectrum radio transmission systems, 
which are called frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS), direct-sequence 
spread spectrum (DSSS), and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing 
(OFDM). Some older data networks use the slower FHSS system, but the first 
Wi-Fi networks used DSSS, and more recent systems use OFDM. Table 2-1 
lists each of the Wi-Fi standards and the type of spread spectrum modulation 
they use.
Spread spectrum radio offers some important advantages over other 
types of radio signals that use a single narrow channel. Spread spectrum 
is extremely efficient, so the radio transmitters can operate with very low 
power. Because the signals operate on a relatively wide band of frequencies,

they are less sensitive to interference from other radio signals and electrical 
noise, which means they can often get through in environments where a 
conventional narrow-band signal would be impossible to receive and under-
stand. And because a frequency-hopping spread spectrum signal shifts among 
more than one channel, it can be extremely difficult for an unauthorized 
listener to intercept and decode the contents of a signal.
Spread spectrum technology has an interesting history. It was invented 
by the actress Hedy Lamarr and the American avant-garde composer George 
Antheil as a “Secret Communication System” for directing radio-controlled 
torpedoes that would not be vulnerable to enemy jamming. Before she came 
to Hollywood, Lamarr had been married to an arms merchant in Austria, 
where she learned about the problems of torpedo guidance at dinner parties 
with her husband’s customers. Years later, shortly before the United States 
entered World War II, she came up with the concept of changing radio fre-
quencies to cut through interference. The New York Times reported in 1941 
that her “red hot” invention (Figure 2-4) was vital to the national defense, 
but the government would not reveal any details.
Figure 2-4: Hedy Lamarr and George Antheil received this patent in 1942 for the 
invention that became the foundation of spread spectrum radio communication.

Antheil turned out to be the ideal person to make this idea work. His 
most famous composition was an extravaganza called Ballet Mechanique, 
which was scored for sixteen player pianos, two airplane propellers, four 
xylophones, four bass drums, and a siren. His design used the same kind of 
mechanism that he had previously used to synchronize the player pianos to

change radio frequencies in a spread spectrum transmission. The original 
slotted paper tape system had 88 different radio channels—one for each of 
the 88 keys on a piano.
In theory, the same method could be used for voice and data communi-
cation as well as guiding torpedoes, but in the days of vacuum tubes, paper 
tape, and mechanical synchronization, the whole process was too complicated 
to actually build and use. By 1962, solid-state electronics had replaced the 
vacuum tubes and piano rolls, and the technology was used aboard US Navy 
ships for secure communication during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Today, 
spread spectrum radios are used in the US Air Force Space Command’s 
Milstar Satellite Communications System, in digital cellular telephones, and 
in wireless data networks.
Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum
Lamarr and Antheil’s original design for spread spectrum radio used a 
frequency-hopping system (FHSS). As the name suggests, FHSS technology divides 
a radio signal into small segments and “hops” from one frequency to another 
many times per second as it transmits those segments. The transmitter and 
the receiver establish a synchronized hopping pattern that sets the sequence 
in which they will use different subchannels. 
FHSS systems overcome interference from other users by using a narrow 
carrier signal that changes frequency many times per second. Additional 
transmitter and receiver pairs can use different hopping patterns on the same 
set of subchannels at the same time. At any point in time, each transmission 
is probably using a different subchannel, so there’s no interference between 
signals. When a conflict does occur, the system resends the same packet 
until the receiver gets a clean copy and sends a confirmation back to the 
transmitting station.
For some older 802.11 wireless data services, the unlicensed 2.4 MHz 
band is split into 75 subchannels, each of them 1 MHz wide. Because each 
frequency hop adds overhead to the data stream, FHSS transmissions are 
relatively slow.
Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum
The direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) technology that controls 802.11b 
networks uses an 11-chip Barker Sequence to spread the radio signal through 
a single 22 MHz–wide channel without changing frequencies. Each DSSS 
link uses just one channel without any hopping between frequencies. As 
Figure 2-5 shows, a DSSS transmission uses more bandwidth, but less power 
than a conventional signal. The digital signal on the left is a conventional 
transmission in which the power is concentrated within a tight bandwidth. 
The DSSS signal on the right uses the same amount of power, but it spreads 
that power across a wider band of radio frequencies. Obviously, the 22 MHz 
DSSS channel is a lot wider than the 1 MHz channels used in FHSS systems.
A DSSS transmitter breaks each bit in the original data stream into a 
series of redundant bit patterns called chips, and it transmits them to a receiver 
that reassembles the chips back into a data stream that is identical to the 

18
Chapter 2
original. Because most interference is likely to occupy a narrower bandwidth 
than a DSSS signal, and because each bit is divided into several chips, the 
receiver can usually identify noise and reject it before it decodes the signal.
Figure 2-5: A conventional signal (left) uses a narrow radio frequency bandwidth. A DSSS 
signal (right) uses a wider bandwidth but a less powerful signal.
Like other networking protocols, a DSSS wireless link exchanges hand-
shaking messages within each data packet to confirm that the receiver can 
understand each packet. For example, the standard data transmission rate in 
an 802.11b DSSS WI-Fi network is 11Mbps, but when the signal quality won’t 
support that speed, the transmitter and receiver use a process called dynamic 
rate shifting to drop the speed down to 5.5Mbps. The speed might drop because 
a source of electrical noise near the receiver interferes with the signal or 
because the transmitter and receiver are too far apart to support full-speed 
operation. If 5.5Mbps is still too fast for the link to handle, it drops again, 
down to 2Mbps or even 1Mbps. 
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation, used in 802.11a 
Wi-Fi networks, is considerably more complicated than DSSS technology. 
The physical layer splits the data stream among 52 parallel bit streams that 
each use a different radio frequency called a subcarrier. Four of these sub-
carriers carry pilot data that provides reference information about the 
remaining 48 subcarriers, in order to reduce signal loss due to radio inter-
ference or phase shift. Because the data is divided into 48 separate streams 
that move through separate subcarriers in parallel, the total transmission 
speed is much greater than the speed of data through a single channel.
The subcarrier frequencies in an 
OFDM signal overlap with the peak 
of each subcarrier’s waveform match-
ing the baseline of the overlapping 
signals as shown in Figure 2-6. This 
is called orthogonal frequency division. 
The 802.11a standard specifies a 
total of eight data channels that are 
20 MHz wide. Each of these channels 
is divided into 52 300 kHz 
subcarriers.
Figure 2-6: In OFDM, the peaks of over-
lapping frequencies don’t interfere with 
one another.

Introduction to Wireless Networks

When a Wi-Fi radio receiver detects an 802.11a signal, it assembles the 
parallel bit streams back into a single high-speed data stream and uses the 
pilot data to check its accuracy. Under ideal conditions, an 802.11a network 
can move data at 54Mbps, but like DSSS modulation, the OFDM transmitter 
and receiver automatically reduce the data speed when the maximum trans-
mission rate is not possible due to interference, weak signals, or other less-
than-perfect atmospheric conditions. 
The more recent 802.11g specification was designed to combine the best 
features of both 802.11b (greater signal range) and 802.11a (higher speed). 
To accomplish this objective, it uses OFDM modulation on the 2.4 GHz fre-
quency band.
Why This Matters
The great science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke once observed that “Any 
sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” For most 
of us, the technology that controls high-speed spread spectrum radio could 
just as easily be a form of magic, because we don’t need to understand the 
things that happen inside a transmitter and a receiver; they’re just about 
invisible when we connect a computer to the Internet. As mentioned earlier 
in this chapter, you don’t need to understand these technical details about 
how a Wi-Fi transmitter splits your data into tiny pieces and reassembles 
them into data unless you’re a radio circuit designer.
But when you know that there’s a well-defined set of rules and methods 
that make the connection work (even if you don’t know all the details), you 
are in control. You know that it’s not magic, and if you think about it, you 
might also know some of the right questions to ask when the system doesn’t 
work correctly. If knowledge is power, then knowledge about the technology 
you use every day is the power to control that technology rather than just 
use it.
Benefits of Wireless
Wireless broadband provides Internet access to mobile devices in addition to 
allowing network operators to extend their networks beyond the range of 
their wired connections. For our purposes, two-way radio is the most sensible 
approach to wireless broadband, but other methods (such as infrared light 
or visible signaling) are also possible. Connecting your computer to the 
Internet (or a local network) by radio offers several advantages over connect-
ing the same computer through a wired connection. First, wireless provides 
convenient access for portable computers; it’s not necessary to find a cable or 
network data outlet. And second, it allows a user to make a connection from 
more than one location and to maintain a connection as the user moves from 
place to place. For network managers, a wireless connection makes it possible 
to distribute access to a network without the need to string wires or cut holes 
through walls.
In practice, access without cables means that the owner of a laptop or 
other portable computer can walk into a classroom, a coffee shop, or a library 
and connect to the Internet by simply turning on the computer and running 

20
Chapter 2
a communication program. Depending on the type of wireless network you’re 
using, you might also be able to maintain the same connection in a moving 
vehicle.
When you’re installing your own network, it’s often easier to use Wi-Fi 
links to extend your network and your Internet connection to other rooms 
because a wired system requires a physical path for the cables between the 
network router or switch and each computer. Unless you can route those 
cables through a false ceiling or some other existing channel, this almost 
always means that you must cut holes in your walls for data connectors and 
feed wires inside the walls and under the floors. A radio signal that passes 
through those same walls is often a lot neater and easier.
Wireless Data Services
Because radio signals move through the air, you can set up a network connec-
tion from any place within range of the network base station’s transmitter; 
it’s not necessary to use a telephone line, television cable, or some other 
dedicated wiring to connect your computer to the network. Just turn on the 
radio connected to the computer and it will find the network signal. There-
fore, a radio (or wireless) network connection is often a lot more convenient 
than a wired one.
This is not to say that wireless is always the best choice. A wired network 
is usually more secure than a wireless system because it’s a lot more difficult 
for unauthorized eavesdroppers and other snoops to monitor data as it 
moves through the network, and a wired link doesn’t require as many complex 
negotiations between the sender and receiver on protocols and so forth. In 
an environment where your computer never moves away from your desk and 
there are no physical obstacles between the computer and the network access 
point, it’s often easier to install a data cable between the computer and a 
modem.
So now we have a bunch of radio transmitters and receivers that all 
operate on the same frequencies and all use the same kind of modulation. 
(Modulation is the method a radio uses to add some kind of content, such as 
voice or digital data, to a radio wave.) The next step is to send some network 
data through those radios. Several different wireless data systems and services 
are available to connect computers and other devices to local networks and 
to the Internet, including Wi-Fi, WiMAX, and a handful of services based on 
the latest generations of cellular mobile telephone technology.
Wi-Fi
The IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) has produced a 
set of standards and specifications for wireless networks under the title IEEE 
802.11 that define the formats and structures of the relatively short-range 
signals that provide Wi-Fi service. The original 802.11 standard (without any 
letter at the end) was released in 1997. It covers several types of wireless media: 
two kinds of radio transmissions and networks that use infrared light. The 

Introduction to Wireless Networks
21
802.11b standard provides additional specifications for wireless Ethernet 
networks. A related document, IEEE 802.11a, describes wireless networks 
that operate at higher speeds on different radio frequencies. Still other 
802.11 radio networking standards with other letters are also available or 
moving toward public release. 
The specifications in widest use today are 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g. 
They’re the de facto standards used by just about every wireless Ethernet 
LAN that you are likely to encounter in offices and public spaces and in most 
home networks. It’s worth the trouble to keep an eye on the progress of those 
other standards, but for the moment, 802.11a and 802.11g are the ones to 
use for short-range wireless networks, especially if you’re expecting to connect 
to networks where you don’t control all the hardware yourself. 
NOTE
Many first-generation 802.11b Wi-Fi network adapters are still compatible with 
today’s networks, but their manufacturers don’t offer the device drivers that are 
necessary to make them work with the latest operating systems (such as Windows XP 
or Windows Vista).
The 802.11n standard is the next one in the pipeline, and when it’s 
released, it will replace both 802.11b and 802.11g because it’s faster, more 
secure, and more reliable. The older standards will still work, so new Wi-Fi 
equipment will support all three (often along with 802.11a, which uses 
different radio frequencies) and automatically match your network interface 
to the signals it detects from each base station.
NOTE
Until the new 802.11n standard is formally approved and released, some manufac-
turers offer “pre-n” network adapters and access points that include many of the features 
that will be in the final 802.11n standard. These preliminary versions generally work 
best on networks that are limited to equipment (adapters and access points) made by a 
single manufacturer, although they all generally work with any existing 802.11b or 
802.11g network. Your best bet is to wait until the final standard is released before you 
upgrade your system, but if you do buy a pre-n device, the manufacturer will probably 
offer a free firmware upgrade to the final 802.11n specifications.
There are two more names in the alphabet soup of wireless LAN 
standards that you ought to know about: WECA and Wi-Fi. WECA (Wireless 
Ethernet Compatibility Alliance) is an industry group that includes all of the 
major manufacturers of wireless Ethernet equipment. Their twin missions 
are to test and certify that the wireless network devices from all of their 
member companies can operate together in the same network, and to 
promote 802.11 networks as the worldwide standard for wireless LANs. 
WECA’s marketing geniuses have adopted the more friendly name of Wi-Fi 
(short for wireless fidelity) for the 802.11 specifications. 
Once or twice per year, the Wi-Fi Alliance conducts an “interoperability 
bake-off” where engineers from many hardware manufacturers confirm 
that their hardware will communicate correctly with equipment from other 
suppliers. Network equipment that carries a Wi-Fi logo has been certified 
by the Wi-Fi Alliance to meet the relevant standards and to pass inter-
operability tests. Figure 2-7 shows one version of the Wi-Fi logo.

22
Chapter 2
NOTE
See “Extending the Network” on page 167 for more about long-range Wi-Fi operation.
Because most Wi-Fi signals have such a limited range, you must find a 
new access point, or hot spot, and set up a new connection every time you 
move your computer to a new location. And because many Wi-Fi access 
points don’t permit strangers to connect through them, you may have to 
establish a separate account for each location. 
The Wi-Fi networks described in this book follow the 802.11a, b, and g 
standards, but much of the same information will also apply to the new 
802.11n networks when they become available.
Metropolitan Wi-Fi Services
In some metropolitan areas, a large number of interconnected Wi-Fi base 
stations are being installed by either local government agencies or private 
businesses to provide wireless service throughout an entire region or in 
selected neighborhoods as an economical alternative to cable and telephone 
(DSL) services. The base stations for these services are often mounted on 
utility poles or rooftops.
These same networks might also provide a variety of special data services 
to the local government and major subscribers. For example, the local natural 
gas, electric, and water utilities could add small Wi-Fi adapters to their meters 
and use the system to send readings once a month. And city buses might 
have transponders that report their locations to a central tracking system, 
like the one in Seattle at http://busview.org/busview_launch.jsp, as shown in 
Figure 2-8.
It’s not yet clear whether these city-wide Wi-Fi services will be able to 
overcome possible interference problems and competition from other 
wireless data alternatives, or whether they will attract enough business to 
remain viable. But if they do, any computer within the coverage area that 
has a Wi-Fi adapter should detect the signal and have access to a broadband 
Internet connection.
Wi-Fi was originally intended to be a wireless 
extension of a wired LAN, so the distances between 
Wi-Fi base stations and the computers that commu-
nicate through them are limited to about 100 feet 
(35 meters) indoors or up to 300 feet (100 meters) 
outdoors, assuming there are no obstructions 
between the access point and the computer. When 
802.11n equipment becomes available, it will sup-
port connections between computers and base 
stations at least as far apart as the older Wi-Fi 
versions. There are ways to extend the range 
of a Wi-Fi signal, but those techniques require 
special equipment and careful installation.

reports locations on a website.
Cellular Mobile Wireless Services
Several broadband wireless data services are extensions of cellular mobile 
telephone technology. You might see them described as 3G services because 
they’re based on the third generation of cellular telephone technology. If 
you have been using a mobile telephone for more than a year or two, you 
probably remember that the earliest phones were only good for voice calls, 
but as each new generation was introduced, your mobile carrier offered 
more and better features. Table 2-2 describes the various generations.
For people who use their computers away from their home or office, the 
great advantage of a mobile broadband service is that it covers a much wider 
territory than any Wi-Fi base station; you can connect your computer to the 
Internet without the need to search for a new hot spot and use a different 
access account in each new location, and you can even keep the same connec-
tion alive in a moving vehicle. Each of the major wireless broadband services 
offers coverage in most metropolitan areas and much of the countryside 
between cities.

24
Chapter 2
Of course, computer technology has also been improving at the same 
time, so today’s 2.5G and 3G mobile telephones often incorporate enough 
computing power to allow them to double as pocket-size Internet terminals 
(as well as cameras and media players). And equally important, from the 
perspective of this book, broadband data adapters that use 2.5G and 3G 
technology can attach to a laptop or other portable computer and provide a 
direct wireless connection to the Internet through the same cellular telephone 
company that offers mobile telephone service.
Today, most cellular broadband wireless services offer credit card–size 
adapters that connect to your computer through the PC Card socket on the 
side of a laptop or into the front or back panel of a desktop computer. In 
another year or two, many new laptops will come with internal adapters and 
integrated antennas for both Wi-Fi and 3G wireless or WiMAX that mount 
directly on the motherboard, just as they contain internal Wi-Fi adapters and 
dial-up modems today.
NOTE
Some cellular service providers also offer mobile telephones that can connect a computer 
to the Internet through a USB cable linked to the phone, but separate PC Card adapters 
are a lot more convenient and easy to use.

WiMAX
Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) is yet another 
method for distributing broadband wireless data over wide geographic areas. 
It’s a metropolitan area network service that typically uses one or more base 
stations that can each provide service to users within a 30-mile radius. The 
IEEE 802.16 specification contains the technical details of WiMAX networks.
In the United States, the earliest WiMAX services were offered by 
Clearwire as a wireless alternative to DSL and cable broadband Internet 
access in fixed locations (such as homes and businesses), but mobile 
WiMAX access is not far behind. By early 2008, Clearwire plans to offer 
access to their wireless networks through an adapter on a PC Card. When 
those adapters become available, WiMAX, 3G cellular data services, and 
metropolitan Wi-Fi networks will compete for the same commercial niche: 
wireless access to the Internet through a service that covers an entire metro-
politan area.
Each WiMAX service provider uses one or more licensed operating fre-
quencies somewhere between 2 GHz and 11 GHz. A WiMAX link can transfer 
data (including handshaking and other overhead) at up to 70Mbps, but most 
commercial WiMAX services are significantly slower than that. And as more 
and more users share a single WiMAX tower and base station, some users 
report that their signal quality deteriorates.
Unlike the cellular broadband wireless data services that piggyback on 
existing mobile telephone networks, WiMAX is a separate radio system that is 
designed to either supplement or replace the existing broadband Internet 
distribution systems. In practice, WiMAX competes with both 3G wireless 
services and with Internet service providers that distribute Internet access to 
fixed locations through telephone lines and cable television utilities. Home 
and business subscribers to a WiMAX service usually use either a wired LAN 
or Wi-Fi to distribute the network within their buildings. Figure 2-9 shows a 
typical WiMAX network.

Chapter 2
What About Bluetooth?
Bluetooth is the other type of wireless networking technology that we ought 
to describe. Bluetooth uses radio signals to replace the wires and cables that 
connect a computer or a mobile telephone to peripheral devices, such as a 
keyboard, a mouse, or a set of speakers. You can also use Bluetooth to transfer 
data between a computer and a mobile telephone, smartphone, BlackBerry, or 
other PDA (personal digital assistant).
Bluetooth is an FHSS system that splits the radio signal into tiny pieces. 
It moves among 79 different frequencies 1,600 times per second in the same 
unlicensed 2.4 GHz range as 802.11b and 802.11g Wi-Fi services.
Bluetooth is not practical for connecting a computer to the Internet 
because it’s slow (the maximum data transfer rate is only about 700Kbps), 
and it has a very limited signal range (most often about 33 feet, or 10 meters, 
or less). 
In order to prevent interference between Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signals, 
many computers that use both technologies (including the widely used Intel 
Centrino chip set) coordinate the two services. When either module is active, 
it notifies the other, and the active service takes priority. This coordinated 
operation is slightly slower than either service operating alone, but the 
difference is insignificant.
Frequency Allocations
Each type of broadband wireless service uses a specific set of radio frequencies. 
Some of these frequencies are reserved for the exclusive use of a specific 
licensed service provider while others are free-for-all bands that are open 
for anybody to use.
Wi-Fi Services
The 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n Wi-Fi services all operate in a frequency 
range at or slightly above 2.4 GHz. The 802.11a signal uses a band close to 
5.3 GHz. The specific center frequencies of each Wi-Fi channel are listed in 
Table 2-3.
Unless you’re a radio engineer, the important things to know about 
the different Wi-Fi services are the maximum data transmission rate and the 
signal range. Table 2-3 shows the important characteristics of each Wi-Fi 
specification.
The differences between the maximum data speeds and the typical speeds 
are caused by the handshaking and other nondata information that must 
attach itself to each data packet. Obviously, there’s a tremendous amount 
of overhead involved in moving information through any kind of Wi-Fi 
network.

Introduction to Wireless Networks
27
Other Broadband Services
National broadband wireless data service providers use a different variation 
on spread spectrum technology and a different range of radio frequencies. 
The broadband wireless services provided by Sprint, AT&T, and Verizon 
all share the frequencies around 800 MHz and 1,900 MHz used by those 
companies’ digital mobile telephone networks. WiMAX services, such as 
Clearwire, use signals in the 2.3 to 2.5 GHz and 3.5 GHz bands.
Many new radio frequencies may open up for mobile telephone and 
data services in the United States after February 17, 2009, when all the 
existing analog television stations move to new digital channels, and the 
old VHF channels will close down. The newly vacant radio spectrum will 
become available for new services, including broadband wireless data.
NOTE
Don’t panic. All your favorite television stations will still be available after the 
changeover. You will need either an inexpensive converter box or a new digital 
television set to receive them, but they’ll still be there for you.
The exact frequencies that the WiMAX and broadband wireless data 
services use are less important to you as a user than the frequencies of Wi-Fi 
signals because service providers control the base stations and access points. 
The network interface device in your computer automatically finds the right 
signal and sets up the connection without forcing you to choose a specific 
channel.
Choosing a Service
Each type of wireless access to the Internet offers a different combination 
of cost, coverage areas, reliability, ease of use, and security. Your choice will 
depend on your particular needs and the availability of signals in the locations 
where you need wireless Internet access.

Chapter 2
For example, if you use your computer in just a few places and all of those 
places are within range of Wi-Fi hot spots, the built-in Wi-Fi adapter (or an 
inexpensive plug-in adapter) is probably your best choice. It’s likely that Wi-Fi 
hot spots already exist at your workplace and in the libraries, coffee shops, 
schools, and conference centers where you regularly spend time, and it’s 
relatively easy and inexpensive to install one or more access points at home. 
However, you will probably need a separate account to log in to each Wi-Fi 
network. Some of these Wi-Fi services are free, but others charge for access 
by the hour, by the day, or by the month; if you need paid accounts at several 
locations, the total cost can be more than a single account with a cellular 
service.
Wi-Fi also allows you to add portable computers to an existing LAN at 
home or in your school or workplace. And if cost is a primary concern, you 
will probably choose to use free public Wi-Fi hot spots instead of a cellular or 
WiMAX service that charges a monthly fee.
On the other hand, if you want constant Internet access wherever you 
go, the cellular data and WiMAX metropolitan area network services are 
better choices. Both systems provide coverage throughout large geographic 
regions, and both allow you to maintain a connection while you’re moving 
from one place to another. You can use the same account and the same login 
and password every time you set up a connection. However, it’s important to 
make sure that there’s a usable cellular or WiMAX signal in all the places 
where you expect to use them before you commit to a long-term contract. 
Most wireless data service providers offer a free or low cost trial period that 
you can use to test the system.
As WiMAX and cellular data services become more common, many 
laptop computers and add-on network adapters will operate with both types 
of wireless services. When the computer detects a high-speed Wi-Fi signal, it 
will automatically try to establish a connection to that network. But when 
there is no local Wi-Fi signal, or if you haven’t configured your computer to 
use any of the local signals, it will automatically shift over to your WiMAX or 
cellular data account and use that service to connect to the Internet.
All three types of wireless Internet services—Wi-Fi, cellular, and 
WiMAX—offer fast and reliable connections, but each has a different set of 
strengths and weaknesses. For short-range coverage and for access to local 
area networks, Wi-Fi is the obvious choice. If you are outside of the service 
areas of a DSL or cable Internet service, WiMAX is a huge improvement over 
a slow dial-up service. But when you carry your computer to many locations, a 
single account with a cellular or WiMAX service will allow you to connect to 
the Internet without the need to search for a new hot spot and set up a new 
account.

H O W  W I - F I  W O R K S
Wireless Ethernet, better known as Wi-Fi, 
uses spread-spectrum radio signaling to 
distribute computer data through local area 
networks. This chapter describes the technical 
details of Wi-Fi networking, including the differences 
among the Wi-Fi standards and the structure of a net-
work. It also includes basic information about Wi-Fi 
access points (also called base stations) and network 
interface adapters.
Wi-Fi Network Controls
Wi-Fi specifications control the way data moves through the physical layer 
(the radio link), and it defines a media access control (MAC) layer that 
handles the interface between the physical layer and the rest of the network 
structure.

Chapter 3
The Physical Layer
In an 802.11 network, the radio transmitter adds a 144-bit preamble to each 
packet, with 128 bits that the receiver uses to synchronize with the transmitter 
and a 16-bit start-of-frame field (a frame is a packet with additional data 
added to the beginning or end of the bit string). This is followed by a 48-bit 
header that contains information about the data transfer speed, the length 
of the data contained in the packet, and an error-checking sequence. This 
header is called the PHY preamble because it controls the physical layer 
(in the ISO model) of the communication link.
Because the header specifies the speed of the data that follows it, the 
preamble and the header are always transmitted at 1Mbps. Therefore, even if 
a network link is operating at the full 11Mbps, the effective data transfer speed 
is considerably slower. In practice, the best you can expect is about 85 percent 
of the nominal speed, and the other types of overhead in the data packets 
reduce the actual speed even more.
The 144-bit preamble is a holdover from the older and slower DSSS 
systems that has stayed in the specification to assure that 802.11 devices are 
still compatible with the older standards, but it really doesn’t accomplish 
anything useful. There is an optional alternative that uses a shorter 72-bit 
preamble. In a short preamble, the synchronization field has 56 bits that are 
combined with the same 16-bit start-of-frame field used in long preambles. 
The 72-bit preamble is not compatible with very old 802.11 hardware, but 
that doesn’t matter in a modern Wi-Fi network because all the nodes can 
recognize the short preamble format. In all other respects, a short preamble 
works just as well as a long one.
It takes the network a maximum of 192 milliseconds to handle a long 
preamble, compared to 96 milliseconds for a short preamble. In other words, 
the short preamble cuts the overhead on each packet in half. This makes a 
significant difference in the actual data transmission speed, especially for 
things like streaming audio and video and voice over Internet services.
Some manufacturers use the long preamble as the default, and others 
use the short preamble. It’s usually possible to change the preamble length 
in the configuration software for network adapters and access points.
For most users, preamble length is one of those technical details that you 
don’t have to understand as long as it’s the same for all the devices in the 
network. Fifteen years ago, when telephone modems were the most common 
way to connect one computer to another, we all had to worry about setting the 
data bits and stop bits every time we placed a call through a modem. You 
probably never knew exactly what a stop bit is (it’s the amount of time an old 
mechanical Teletype printer needed to return to the idle state after sending 
or receiving each byte), but you knew that it had to be the same at both ends. 
Preamble length is the same kind of obscure setting: It has to be the same on 
every node in a network, but most people neither know nor care what it 
means.

How Wi-Fi Works

The MAC Layer
Within the ISO model, the MAC layer (which is usually understood as a 
subset of the data link layer) controls the traffic that moves through the 
radio network. It prevents data collisions and conflicts by using a set of rules 
called carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), and it supports 
the security functions specified in the 802.11 standards. When the network 
includes more than one access point, the MAC layer associates each network 
client with the access point that provides the best signal quality.
When more than one node in the network tries to transmit data at the 
same time, CSMA/CA instructs all but one of the conflicting nodes to back 
off and try again later, and it allows the surviving node to send its packet. 
CSMA/CA works like this: When a network node is ready to send a packet, 
it listens for other signals first. If it doesn’t hear anything, it waits for a random 
(but short) period of time and then listens again. If it still doesn’t sense a 
signal, it transmits a packet. The device that receives the packet evaluates it, 
and if it’s intact, the receiving mode returns an acknowledgment. But if the 
sending node does not receive the acknowledgment, it assumes that there 
has been a collision with another packet that scrambled the data, so it waits 
for another random interval and then tries again.
CSMA/CA also has an optional feature that sets an access point (the 
bridge between the wireless LAN and the backbone network) as a point 
coordinator that can grant priority to a network node that is trying to send 
time-critical data types, such as voice or streaming media.
The MAC layer can support two kinds of authentication to confirm that 
a network device is authorized to join the network: open authentication 
and shared key. When you configure your network, all the nodes in the 
network must use the same kind of authentication. The network supports all 
of these housekeeping functions in the MAC layer by exchanging (or trying 
to exchange) a series of control frames before it allows the higher layers to 
send data. It also sets several options on the network adapter:
 The network supports two power modes: continuous aware mode and 
power save polling mode. In continuous aware mode, the radio receiver is 
always on and consuming power. In power save polling mode, the radio is 
idle much of the time, but it periodically polls the access point for new 
messages. As the name suggests, power save polling mode reduces the 
battery drain on portable devices such as laptop computers and PDAs.
 The network contains the access control that keeps unauthorized users 
out of the network. A Wi-Fi network can use two forms of access control: 
the SSID (the name of the network) and the MAC address (a unique string 
of characters that identifies each network node). Each network node must 
have the SSID programmed into it or the access point will not associate 
with that node. An optional table of MAC addresses can restrict access to 
radios whose addresses are on the list. It controls the wired equivalent 

32
Chapter 3
privacy (WEP) or Wi-Fi protected access (WPA) encryption function. 
WEP encryption can use either a 64-bit or a 128-bit encryption key to 
encode and decode data as it passes through the radio link; WPA uses a 
128-bit key and a 48-bit initialization vector (see Chapter 12 for informa-
tion about using Wi-Fi encryption).
Other Control Layers
All of the activity specified in the 802.11 standards takes place at the PHY 
and MAC layers. The higher layers control things like addressing and routing, 
data integrity, syntax, and the format of the data contained inside each packet. 
It doesn’t make any difference to these layers whether they’re moving packets 
through wires, fiber optic lines, or radio links. Therefore, you can use a 
wireless network with any kind of LAN or other network protocol. The same 
radios can handle TCP/IP, Novell NetWare, and all the other network proto-
cols built into Windows, Unix, Macintosh, and other operating systems 
equally well.
Wi-Fi Network Protocols
The first Wi-Fi method to reach the marketplace was the 802.11b version in 
1999, and the faster 802.11a followed about a year later, though the standards 
were released at the same time. By 2003, the IEEE standards group had 
developed the newer 802.11g specification that offered the best of both 
earlier types: It’s as fast as 802.11a, and it has the greater signal range of 
802.11b. The 802.11g specification is also backward compatible with 802.11b, 
so an older 802.11b-only network adapter will work (albeit at slower 802.11b 
speeds) with an 802.11g access point.
NOTE
There are also specifications designated as 802.11c, d, e and f, but they have to do with 
things like bridge operation and Quality of Service (QoS). Unless you’re manufacturing 
your own base stations, you’ll never have to worry about them.
The latest Wi-Fi specification is 802.11n. It provides higher speed and 
better security than any of the earlier versions. You can expect 802.11n 
access points to also work with 802.11b and 802.11g network adapters.
When you’re using a Wi-Fi system to connect to the Internet, it’s important 
to remember that the data transfer speed across the wireless link is less relevant 
than you might expect. The maximum bandwidth of your incoming Wi-Fi 
signal can’t be greater than the speed of the data that the access point receives. 
Even if the network’s Wi-Fi base station can handle relatively high-speed 
signaling, it’s probably connected to the Internet through a T-1, cable modem, 
or DSL line that has a maximum speed of 5Mbps or less, so that’s the max-
imum speed that it can relay the signal to you. 

How Wi-Fi Works
33
Wi-Fi Radio Frequencies
By international agreement, a section of radio spectrum near 2.4 GHz is 
reserved for unlicensed industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) services, 
including spread spectrum wireless data networks. The 802.11b, 802.11g, 
and 802.11n services all use this band.
Another band of frequencies near 5.3 GHz is reserved for something 
called the unlicensed national information infrastructure (U-NII). The 
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States and similar 
regulatory bodies in other countries permit wireless networking in both the 
ISM band and the U-NII band. 802.11a operates in the U-NII band.
However, the exact frequency allocations for Wi-Fi services are slightly 
different from one part of the world to another; the authorities in different 
countries have assigned slightly different frequency bands. Table 3-1 shows 
the 2.4 GHz frequency assignments in several locations. 
Just about every other country in the world also uses one of these bands. 
Those minor differences in frequency allocations are not particularly impor-
tant (unless you plan to transmit across the border between France and Spain 
or something equally unlikely) because most networks operate entirely within 
a single country or region, and the normal signal range is usually just a few 
hundred feet. There’s enough overlap among the various national standards 
to allow the same equipment to operate legally anywhere in the world. The 
set of channels your equipment can use is typically dictated by the country 
it was sold in, and it is usually set by the manufacturer. 
Wireless Channels
The exact frequency that a particular wireless network uses is determined by 
its channel. In North America, Wi-Fi devices use 11 802.11b/g channels. Many 
other countries have authorized 13 channels, but Japan uses 14 channels, 
and only 4 are available in France. Fortunately, the entire world uses the same 
set of channel numbers, so channel 9 in New York uses exactly the same 
frequency as channel 9 in Tokyo or Paris. Table 3-2 shows the channels used 
in different countries and regions.

Chapter 3
You might have to set your network adapter to a different channel number 
when you take it abroad (if the adapter doesn’t automatically detect a signal), 
but there’s almost always a way to connect, assuming there’s a network within 
range of your adapter. If you’re not sure which channels to use in another 
country, consult the local regulatory authority for specific information. Alter-
natively, you can use channels 10 and 11, which are legal everywhere except 
Israel.
Reducing Interference
Note that the frequency specified for each of those channels is actually the 
center frequency of a 22 MHz channel. Therefore, each channel overlaps 
with several other channels that are above and below it. The whole 2.4 GHz 
band only has space for three completely separate channels, so if your network 
runs on channel 4, for example, and your neighbor is using channel 5 or 
channel 6, each network will detect the other network’s signals as interference. 
Both networks will work, but the performance (as reflected in the data transfer 
speed) will not be as good as it would be when the channels are more widely 
separated from one another.
To minimize this kind of interference, you should try to coordinate 
channel usage with other nearby network managers (your neighbors running 
their own home Wi-Fi networks count as network managers). If possible, each 
network should use channels that are at least 25 MHz or five channel numbers

apart. If you’re trying to eliminate interference between two networks, use 
one high channel number and one low number. For three channels, your 
best choices are channels 1, 6, and 11, as shown in Figure 3-1. For more than 
three networks, you’ll have to put up with some amount of interference, but 
you can keep it to a minimum by assigning a new channel in the middle of an 
existing pair.
Figure 3-1: Channels 1, 6, and 11 do not interfere with one another.
This all sounds more serious than it is likely to be on the ground. In 
practice, you can optimize the performance of your network by staying away 
from a channel that somebody else is using nearby, but even if you and your 
neighbor are on adjacent channels, your networks will probably work, 
although your connections might be a bit slower than they’d be on more 
widely separated channels. Unless your neighbor’s network is extremely 
busy, you’re likely to have more problems with interference from other 
devices using the 2.4 GHz band, such as cordless telephones and microwave 
ovens.
The 802.11a Wi-Fi specification uses a different range of radio frequencies, 
as shown in Table 3-3. Each channel is 20 MHz wide, so similar rules about 
channel separation apply.
Choosing the operating channel is the network operator’s responsibility. 
When you connect to an existing network, your computer or network adapter 
will automatically detect one or more Wi-Fi signals and allow you to choose

the one you want to use. Most Wi-Fi adapters and network interfaces can 
recognize more than one Wi-Fi protocol and configure the connection for 
the active signal. So, for example, if your computer finds both an 802.11a 
signal and an 802.11g signal, you can choose either one without the need 
to manually change the internal settings.
The 802.11 specifications and various national regulatory agencies 
(such as the FCC in the United States) have also set limits on the amount of 
transmitter power and antenna gain that a Wi-Fi device can use. This restric-
tion is intended to limit the distance over which a network link can operate, 
and therefore it allows more networks to use the same channels without 
interference. We’ll talk about methods for working around those power 
limits and extending the range of your wireless network without violating 
the law in Chapter 10.
Wireless Network Devices
After you have defined the data format and the radio links, the next step is to 
set up a network structure. How do computers use the radios and the data 
format to actually exchange data?
Wi-Fi networks include two categories of radios: network adapters and 
access points. A network adapter is connected to a computer or some other 
device, such as a printer, that exchanges data with a wireless network. An 
access point is the base station for a wireless network, and is a bridge between 
the wireless network and a traditional wired network.
Network Adapters
Wi-Fi network adapters can take several physical forms:
Plug-in PC Cards that fit the PCMCIA sockets in most laptop computers
To bypass the internal shielding in most computers, the built-in antennas 
and status lights in most wireless PC Card adapters extend about an inch 
beyond the opening of the card socket. Other PC Card adapters have 
sockets for external antennas.
Internal network adapters on PCI cards that fit inside a desktop computer
Most PCI adapters are actually PCMCIA sockets that allow a user to plug 
a PC Card into the back of the computer, but a few are built directly on 
the PCI expansion cards. As an alternative to a rear panel socket, separate 
PCMCIA sockets that fit a computer’s external front panel drive bays are 
available from Actiontec and several other manufacturers.
External USB adapters
USB adapters are often a better choice than PC Cards or internal adapters 
because they’re easier to install, and it’s almost always easier to move an 
adapter at the end of a cable to a position with the best possible radio 
signal path to and from the nearest access point.

How Wi-Fi Works
37
Internal wireless adapters built into laptop computers
Internal adapters are modules that plug into the computer’s mother-
board. They present the same appearance to the operating system as 
an external PCMCIA card. The antennas for built-in radios are usually 
hidden inside the computer’s fold-over clamshell screen.
Plug-in adapters for PDAs and other handheld devices
PDAs and other handheld devices often have expansion ports that can 
take one of several types of expansion cards. Typically, they present the 
same appearance to the operating system as a larger expansion card in a 
laptop. It is rare for adapters for PDAs and handhelds to have antenna 
jacks.
Internal network interfaces built into other devices, such as Internet-capable 
telephone sets and office or household appliances
Today, printers, digital cameras, Internet radios, voice over Internet 
(VoIP) telephones, home entertainment systems, and many other 
devices can all use Wi-Fi links to send and receive images, audio, and 
other forms of data. In the future, sophisticated household appliances 
will use Wi-Fi to transmit status messages when your clothes are dry or 
your roast has reached its ideal temperature. 
A network adapter should work with any operating system as long as a 
driver for that adapter is available. In practice, that means you can find 
Windows drivers for just about everything, but you will have fewer choices if 
you’re using a computer running Mac OS, Linux, or Unix. You can find 
pointers to sources for Linux and Unix drivers in Chapter 7, and information 
about using Wi-Fi with a Macintosh in Chapter 8. 
Adapters for Multiple Network Types
In some situations, you might want to use different kinds of network connec-
tions in different places. For example, when your laptop is running in your 
office, you will want it to connect to your LAN through a Wi-Fi link so you 
can use the company’s high-speed Internet account and exchange files and 
messages with other local computers. But when you take the same computer 
on the road, you want to connect to the Internet through a cellular data 
service. Therefore, it would be very convenient if your computer could auto-
matically choose the best connection for your current location.
Today, the only way to change network types is to manually choose the 
software that controls each type of network; you might also have to physically 
remove one network adapter and insert another one. But the makers of laptop 
computers and network interface adapters are working on this problem, and 
several of them will offer a single network adapter and control software in 
the near future that detects more than one type of wireless service and either 
offers an onscreen choice or automatically selects the best connection for you.
When you install one of these multiple-service adapters, you can set up 
your own list of priorities; for example, you might want it to look for your 
home or office LAN first, and if that’s not available, to set up a connection to 
your cellular data account.

38
Chapter 3
Access Points
Access points are often combined with other network functions. It’s quite 
possible to find a stand-alone access point that just plugs into a wired LAN 
through a data cable, but there are plenty of other options. Common access 
point configurations include:
 Simple base stations with a bridge to an Internet port for connection to 
a LAN
 Base stations that include a switch, hub, or router with one or more wired 
Ethernet ports along with the wireless access point
 Broadband routers that provide a bridge between a cable modem or DSL 
port and the wireless access point
 Software access points that use one of the wireless network interface 
adapters in your computer as the base station
 Residential gateways that support a limited number of operating 
channels
The physical design of access points varies from one manufacturer to 
another. Some look like industrial devices that were intended to be placed 
out of sight on the floor or mounted on an inconspicuous wall, but others 
(especially the ones targeted at the home network market) have swooshy, 
“aerodynamic” shapes that appear to have been designed for the top of a 
coffee table or, more likely, next to a desktop computer. Some have internal 
antennas, others (like the one in Figure 3-2) have short vertical whips per-
manently attached, and still others have connectors for external antennas 
(which may or may not be supplied with the access point). Regardless of its 
size and shape, every access point includes a radio that sends and receives 
messages and data between network stations and an Ethernet port that 
connects to a wired network.

How Wi-Fi Works
39
Building a Network
Wi-Fi networks operate in two modes: ad hoc networks and infrastructure 
networks. As the name suggests, an ad hoc network is usually temporary. 
An ad hoc network is a self-contained group of stations with no connection to a 
larger LAN or the Internet. It includes two or more wireless stations with no 
access point or connection to the rest of the world. Ad hoc networks are also 
called peer-to-peer networks and independent basic service sets (IBSS). Figure 3-3 
shows a simple ad hoc network.
Figure 3-3: An ad hoc wireless network with three stations
Infrastructure networks have one or more access points that are almost always 
connected to a wired network. Each wireless station exchanges messages and 
data with the access point, which relays them to other nodes on the wireless 
network or the wired LAN. Any network that requires a wired connection 
through an access point to a printer, a fileserver, or an Internet gateway is an 
infrastructure network. Figure 3-4 shows an infrastructure network.

Chapter 3
An infrastructure network with just one base station is also called a basic 
service set (BSS). When the wireless network uses two or more access points, 
the network structure is an extended service set (ESS). Recall that the technical 
name for a network ID is the SSID. You might also see it called a BSSID if the 
network has just one access point or an ESSID when it has two or more access 
points.
A network with more than one access point (an ESS) creates several new 
complications. First, the network must include a way for only one base station 
to handle data from a particular station, even if the station is within range of 
more than one base station. And if the station is moving during a network 
session, or if some kind of local interference crops up near the first access 
point, the network might have to hand off the connection from one access 
point to another. Wi-Fi networks handle this problem by associating a station 
with only one access point at a time and ignoring the signals from stations 
that are not associated. When the signal fades at one access point and improves 
at another, or when the amount of traffic forces the network to rebalance the 
load, the network will reassociate the station with a new access point that can 
provide acceptable service. If you think this sounds a lot like the way a cellular 
telephone system handles roaming, you’re absolutely correct; even the termi-
nology is the same—it’s also called roaming.
Public and Private Networks
Wi-Fi is an unlicensed radio service, and that means that anybody can set up 
a base station (licensed radio services typically require an expensive license 
to operate a radio at a specific location for a fixed number of years). Some of 
these base stations limit access to a specific set of users, but others allow any 
computer within range of the radio signal to set up a connection. 
When your computer searches for a Wi-Fi signal, it’s likely that it will 
find more than one active network; some of them might be private networks, 
and others might be accessible to anybody who wants to use them. Public 
access points, also called hot spots, allow any nearby computer to establish a 
connection; some require paid accounts, but many others, especially in 
places like schools and libraries, are free (although they might require a login 
name and password).
As a general rule, most private networks should have one or more 
security features, such as encryption or MAC address restriction that locks 
out unauthorized users, but it’s not uncommon to find home and business 
networks that are wide open because the owner never bothered to turn on 
the security tools. We’ll explain how to use MAC address restriction and 
other security tools in Chapter 12.

How Wi-Fi Works
41
Putting It All Together
The radio link, the data structure, and the network architecture are the three 
essential elements that form the internal plumbing of a Wi-Fi network. Like 
the components of most other networks (and most plumbing systems, for that 
matter), these elements should be entirely invisible to the people using the 
network—if users can send and receive messages, read files, and perform 
other activities on the network, they should never have to worry about the 
low-level details.
Of course, this assumes that it always works exactly as it’s supposed to 
work, and users never have to call a network help desk to ask why they can’t 
read their email. Now that you have read this chapter, you probably know 
more about the way your wireless LAN moves messages from here to there 
than 95 percent of the people who use Wi-Fi networks. And you have a good 
chance of understanding the support person who tells you to make sure 
you’re using channel 11, or that you need to change your preamble length, 
or that your adapter is operating in infrastructure mode.

A wireless local area network (LAN) obvi-
ously requires a somewhat different set of 
hardware components from a traditional 
wired network. This chapter describes the com-
ponents that go into a wireless network and offers advice 
about deciding which components will best meet your 
needs. As you read the descriptions of features and functions in access points, 
network adapters, and antennas, remember that the marketplace for wireless 
networking equipment is both extremely competitive, and rapidly changing. 
If one manufacturer offers an access point or network adapter with a hot new 
feature, you can expect that same feature to show up in competing products 
within a few months or less. Therefore, this chapter does not discuss specific 
brands or models; by the time you read this, any such recommendation would 
be wildly out of date.

44
Chapter 4
Everybody Speaks the Same Language (More or Less)
Before we talk about specific features and functions, it may be useful to review 
the rules—and the realities—about using equipment made by more than 
one manufacturer in the same wireless network. It can be done, but it’s not 
quite as simple as the people at the Wi-Fi Alliance would have you believe.
Dozens of companies make equipment that qualifies for Wi-Fi certifica-
tion. To receive that certification, each device must undergo interoperability 
testing by the Alliance’s independent testing lab. If an access point or network 
adapter carries a Wi-Fi logo, it has passed an extensive series of tests to confirm 
that it works with previously certified hardware from several other vendors.
Access points and network adapters from different manufacturers may 
look different on the outside, and each maker provides its own config-
uration software, but the radio circuits inside are all pretty similar. Adapters 
that carry many brand names are actually made under contract by other com-
panies, and just about everybody uses one of just a few standard chip sets. 
In other words, it’s possible to use any combination of Wi-Fi–certified 
adapters and access points together in the same network as long as they all 
follow the same specification (e.g., 802.11b, 802.11a, or 802.11g). The critical 
word in that last sentence is possible. In practice, certification really means that 
a group of technicians who are intimately familiar with the internal workings 
of Wi-Fi networks can get a mixed-vendor network to operate properly in a 
carefully run series of tests under tightly controlled laboratory conditions.
Does that mean that a homeowner or the IT person in a small business 
who has never installed a wireless network can get that same combination of 
products to work? Oh, probably, but maybe not on the first attempt. It may 
take a lot of time and aggravation to set all the configuration options to the 
correct values. It’s almost always a safe bet that devices from different makers 
will have different default settings. For example, some systems use short pre-
ambles as the default, and others use long preambles; some configurations 
request encryption keys as ASCII characters, but others might want them in 
hexadecimal. You can make all this stuff work together, but it might be a 
somewhat painful experience.
As a general rule, it’s almost always easier to equip your entire network 
with hardware from a single manufacturer because the configuration settings 
and options will all be the same, but that’s not always possible or even the 
best choice. You can control the brands of access points in your own network, 
and you can buy the same brand of external network adapters for your desktop 
computers, but eventually one of the users in your office network (and you 
can probably predict who it will be, can’t you?) will come to you with a Wi-Fi 
adapter made by somebody you’ve never heard of, and they’ll expect it to 
connect to your network. Maybe the adapter showed up at a garage sale or 
a swap meet, or maybe it came with a shiny new laptop computer. Or maybe 
it’s the one your daughter’s school recommended for the on-campus network. 
And you have little or no control over the make and model of the internal 
adapters built into a laptop computer or the base station used by a public hot 

The Hardware You Need for Wi-Fi
45
spot. For one reason or another, you’ll eventually have to integrate hardware 
and software from more than one maker into the same network.
The information in this book will help you to understand exactly what 
you need to do to make everything work together, but when you’re building 
your own Wi-Fi network, you can reduce the number of headaches by using 
equipment from a single source.
NOTE
One more point is worth mentioning here: When you buy a Wi-Fi adapter, you generally 
get what you pay for. In most cases, expensive versions from major manufacturers are a 
lot more likely to work with a variety of base stations than their less costly generic counter-
parts. Higher quality radios can also help boost your signal range and make more base 
stations in an area available to you.
Network Adapters
A network adapter is the interface between a computer and a network. In a 
wireless network, the adapter contains a radio transmitter that sends data 
from the computer to the network and a receiver that detects incoming radio 
signals that contain data from the network and passes it along to the computer. 
The computer’s operating system treats a wireless adapter just like any other 
network interface.
If you only plan to use Wi-Fi to connect your computer to the Internet 
through existing Wi-Fi hot spots in public locations, such as libraries, coffee 
shops, and so forth, a network adapter (along with the software to support 
it) is the only new hardware you need to add to your computer. If you want to 
set up your own home or office network, you’ll also need one or more access 
points.
Built-in Wi-Fi adapters are standard features of new laptop computers. 
If your laptop already has a wireless interface, there’s generally no reason 
to replace it until a new Wi-Fi specification, such as the 802.11n standard, 
becomes available—and perhaps not even then if you’re satisfied with your 
existing equipment. So choosing a new adapter is particularly important for 
owners of desktop computers and older laptops. If you have an older laptop 
without a built-in adapter, you can add Wi-Fi capability by installing a plug-in 
adapter on a PC Card or connecting a USB adapter.
Most new Wi-Fi network adapters automatically recognize signals that use 
all three Wi-Fi specifications (or all four, after 802.11n comes out). When the 
adapter detects a signal from an access point, it identifies the signal type and 
uses the same specification to exchange data with that access point.
You should consider several things when you select an interface adapter: 
the physical package (the form factor), the type of antenna (internal or 
external? directional or not?), compatibility with the network’s access points 
and other nodes in the network, and compatibility with the computer’s 
operating system. And of course, you should also consider all the standard 
issues that apply to any piece of computer hardware or software: ease of use, 
security, quality of technical support, and other users’ experiences with the 
product and the company.

Chapter 4
Form Factor
In most cases, the wireless adapter plugs into one of the computer’s high-speed 
I/O ports—either an internal expansion card slot, a socket on a laptop’s 
motherboard, a PCMCIA (PC Card) socket, or a USB port. Network adapters 
for PDAs usually fit into CompactFlash or SDIO (Secure Digital Input/
Output) sockets.
Each type of adapter has its own advantages and drawbacks. The choice 
of a particular package depends on the computer you will use with the adapter 
and the way you expect to use it. For example, if you want to connect a laptop 
computer to the network, an internal adapter or a PC Card is usually the best 
option because it’s easy to install, it doesn’t take up much space, and it doesn’t 
force you to carry a special cable. But in a desktop system, a USB adapter is 
often a better choice.
Internal Adapters
Almost all new laptop computers have an adapter module on a mini-PCI card 
mounted directly onto the motherboard with one or more antennas inside 
the clamshell section of the case that also holds the display screen. Even if 
you choose to save money by ordering a laptop without the adapter, the 
computer probably has an antenna, so you can install a Wi-Fi module later.
The obvious advantage of an internal adapter is that it doesn’t force a 
user to carry (and possibly forget or lose) yet another accessory item along 
with the computer. The disadvantage, if there is one, is that it’s not practical 
to move the same adapter to a different computer when it’s time to repair or 
replace the original machine. If the backup unit doesn’t have an internal 
adapter (which is possible because it’s probably older than the primary unit), 
the user or the network manager will either have to provide a separate adapter 
on a PC Card, connect through a USB cable, or go without wireless access to 
the local network and the Internet. 
A built-in adapter adds about as much to the cost of a new laptop as you 
would pay for a Wi-Fi adapter on a separate PC Card. It doesn’t make sense 
to replace your current laptop just to get the internal wireless adapter, but 
when it’s time to look for a new computer, it’s a feature worth having.
If your computer does have an internal wireless adapter, there’s an easy 
way to disable the adapter when you aren’t using it. Most laptops use either a 
physical on/off switch or a pair of FN keys to turn the internal adapter on and 
off. If you don’t turn it off when it’s not in use, the radio unit will drain your 
computer’s battery more quickly than necessary, and it will produce radio 
signals that can interfere with other users of the same unlicensed 2.4 GHz 
frequencies. Depending on the software your computer uses, leaving the 
wireless radio running can also expose you to security risks because your 
computer may connect to networks without your knowledge.
The internal adapter mounts onto the computer’s motherboard with 
special connectors for the internal antenna. Lenovo calls this a field replaceable 
unit (FRU); other makers have similar descriptions for parts that are easy to 
remove and replace. When new adapters that support the 802.11n specifica-
tion and other adapters that support both Wi-Fi and 3G wireless or WiMAX 

The Hardware You Need for Wi-Fi
47
on a single card become available, it will be possible to remove the existing 
adapter and install a new one by following instructions supplied by the laptop’s 
manufacturer.
Most laptop manufacturers limit the internal adapters you can use to 
those certified by the manufacturer, the FCC, and other regulatory agencies. 
When you buy a new internal adapter, make sure to check both the manual 
and your computer manufacturer’s website to be sure that model adapter 
works with your model of laptop, or purchase the adapter from the company 
that made your computer.
PC Cards
If your laptop computer does not have an internal Wi-Fi adapter, you can 
add one on a PCMCIA card. Just about every maker of Wi-Fi devices has at 
least one PC Card adapter in its product line.
Wireless adapters on PC Cards are compact and don’t add much weight 
to a portable computer, which are both important features. However, it’s 
important to remove the adapter from the computer when you don’t need a 
network link. Otherwise, the adapter might continue to radiate unwanted 
signals and possibly allow an intruder to connect to your computer without 
your knowledge. A Wi-Fi adapter that is not in use also places a small but 
unnecessary drain on the computer’s battery.
PC Card adapters all look pretty much the same because they all have 
to fit into a computer’s PCMCIA socket. However, some adapters have more 
features and better performance than others. Once again, you generally get 
what you pay for. As Figure 4-1 shows, they’re about the size of a credit card 
with a multipin connector at one end and a plastic cover for the internal 
antenna or a connector for an external antenna at the other end.

There are two main types of PC Cards. PCMCIA, the original standard, is 
a slower 16-bit card. Found on older laptops, PCMCIA slots can only support 
802.11b speeds. More modern laptops have CardBus support, which looks 
nearly identical to a PCMCIA connector but supports higher speed 32-bit 
cards such as 802.11a/g/n. Laptops purchased from the late 1990s onward 

48
Chapter 4
should have CardBus support. Laptops made after 2006 might have a third 
type of adapter slot, called ExpressCard, either as a replacement for the PC 
Card socket or as an additional feature. This high-speed slot uses a physically 
different card and is not compatible with previous cards.
Most PC Card adapters include one or two indicator lights on the section 
of the adapter that extends beyond the end of the PCMCIA slot. One of these 
indicators lights when the adapter is receiving power from the computer and 
the other lights when the adapter detects an active radio link from an access 
point or another node in an ad hoc network.
Many PC Card adapters contain two internal antennas with a diversity 
system that constantly compares the quality of the incoming signals from 
each antenna and automatically selects the stronger one. Even though the 
two antennas inside a PC Card are only an inch or two apart, the improvement 
over a single antenna can be substantial. 
Network adapters on PC Cards usually have built-in omnidirectional 
diversity antennas, but some manufacturers also offer versions with connectors 
for external antennas. The choice of an internal versus external antenna is 
always a trade-off. In most cases, the internal antenna is a lot easier to use with 
a portable computer because it doesn’t force you to carry a separate antenna 
and cable. But it’s much easier to adjust the exact location of an antenna at 
the end of a cable instead of the side or back of a computer that you must 
place in a position where you can comfortably see the screen and reach the 
keyboard. If you want to link to an access point from the extreme edges of a 
network’s coverage area or if you’re operating in a location with a lot of inter-
ference, a separate high-gain directional antenna can give you better and 
more reliable network performance than the antennas built into most PC 
Cards. If your usual PC Card adapter does not have an external antenna 
input connector, you might want to remove it and use a USB adapter with a 
high-gain antenna when you’re trying to connect from a fringe location.
USB Adapters
If your computer has a USB (Universal Serial Bus) port, as most desktop and 
laptop computers built since about 1999 do, a wireless USB adapter might be 
the best way to connect it to your Wi-Fi network. The adapter connects to the 
computer through a cable or directly into the computer itself, so it’s never a 
problem to move the whole adapter (with its built-in antenna) to the position 
that provides the best network performance. Even if the optimal location is 
on top of a bookcase or filing cabinet or on the floor under your computer 
table, the location of the adapter won’t interfere with your ability to use the 
computer. It’s a lot easier to connect a USB adapter to a desktop computer 
than to use an adapter on an internal expansion card because you don’t 
have to take apart the computer to install a USB device.
USB adapters come in many shapes and sizes depending on the design 
and marketing philosophies of the manufacturer. Most USB adapters have 
captive antennas that are often mounted on hinges or swivels that allow a user 
to make fine adjustments to their positions. Because the antennas on USB 
adapters are usually larger and easier to manipulate than the antennas in 
PC Card adapters, you can expect somewhat better signal quality through a 

The Hardware You Need for Wi-Fi
49
USB device (but remember that you won’t notice any improvement over 
the threshold that provides a full-speed connection).
Figure 4-2 shows a wireless USB adapter with a hinged antenna made by 
Linksys. Like the adapters on PC Cards, most USB adapters take their power 
from the computer so they don’t require a separate battery or an external 
power supply.
Other USB Wi-Fi adapters are compact modules similar to flash drives, as 
shown in Figure 4-3. These adapters are small and easy to throw into your 
portable computer’s bag as an alternative to a PC Card, but they often have 
lower maximum transmitter power, which translates to less signal range than 
either a PC Card or a larger USB adapter, so they are more likely to drop an 
active connection in marginal reception conditions than other adapters.
Expansion Cards for Desktop Computers
Many internal wireless adapters for desktop systems are actually PC Cards 
mounted in PCMCIA sockets that fit a PCI expansion slot on the computer’s 
motherboard. The adapter fits a slot in one of the mounting plates on the 
back of the computer. This approach offers several advantages for the 
manufacturers: They can use the same PC Card adapter that they sell 
separately for use in laptops combined with a socket that they obtain and 
re-label from some third party, and the metal housing of the PC Card 
provides an effective shield that keeps the radio signals away from the 
inside of the computer. 
But it would be difficult to find a worse place to locate the antenna for a 
wireless adapter. If the adapter has a built-in antenna, you can’t easily move it 
to a different position to improve the signal quality; if the adapter has an

Chapter 4
antenna socket, the antenna cable (or the antenna itself) is likely to become 
tangled with the computer’s other cables. The card sticks out from the back of 
the computer cabinet where you can’t see the indicator lights. The backs of 
most desktop computers are often rats’ nests of other cables and connectors 
that can all affect the radio’s radiation pattern. And the computer’s metal 
backplane may act as either an obstruction or a source of multipath inter-
ference between the adapter and the nearest access point. Of course, it’s 
entirely possible that a PCI adapter will perform flawlessly, right out of the 
box, in spite of all those potential problems. Don’t assume that it won’t work 
until you have actually tried it in your own network, especially when the 
adapter was supplied with your computer. But when you’re adding Wi-Fi to 
an existing desktop computer, a USB adapter is almost always a better choice 
because it’s more flexible and easier to install.
If you do encounter connection problems, there are a couple of ways to 
work around them. If the computer has a USB port, removing (or turning 
off) the internal adapter and installing a wireless USB adapter is the obvious 
solution. Even if there’s no USB port on the outside of the computer, it’s 
possible that the motherboard has a USB port; if it does, you can use an 
inexpensive cable and bracket to bring the port out to the backplane. For 
older motherboards that don’t have USB ports, you’ll need an expansion 
card with one or more add-in USB ports.
If signal quality is a problem, look for an adapter that has a connector for 
an external antenna rather than an antenna built into the adapter itself. 
Adapters with external antenna connectors are available from Buffalo and 
Proxim Wireless, among others. 
If you’re committed to using a built-in adapter, you might want to consider 
installing a PC Card reader or socket that mounts in a spare external drive 
bay on the front of a desktop or tower computer network and a separate PC 
Card adapter, rather than a socket, on the backplane. This makes the adapter 
much easier to reach than it would be at the back of the computer, and it 
moves the adapter away from the tangle of other cables and plugs behind 
the computer. The Actiontec PC750 is among the most widely available 
front-mounting PC Card readers.
NOTE
When you shop for a PC Card reader, make sure it’s designed to work with network 
adapters and not just with flash cards and other storage devices.
Internal vs. External Antennas
Most wireless network adapters come with captive omnidirectional antennas. 
For most users in most situations, these built-in antennas send and receive a 
strong, clean data stream between an access point and a nearby computer. 
But if network adapters with built-in antennas don’t provide a good enough 
signal because of distance, obstructions, or interference from other radio 
signals, an external antenna may be the best way to solve the problem. As a 
rule of thumb, you can expect an external antenna to provide a signal at least 
15 percent stronger than the antenna built into a PC Card adapter; special 

The Hardware You Need for Wi-Fi
51
high-gain directional antennas can offer even better performance. This 
translates to either faster data exchange or a greater maximum distance 
between the computer and the access point.
If you identify a dead spot in your coverage area, a network adapter with 
a connector for an external antenna instead of a built-in antenna may be the 
right choice for a computer that remains in that location. But it’s a lot more 
cumbersome to set up a separate antenna before you can log in to the net-
work, so PC Cards with built-in antennas are generally the best choice for 
laptops and other portables.
As an alternative to an external antenna, consider a USB adapter with a 
built-in antenna. You can place the adapter anywhere within the length of 
the USB cable and move it around to find the best signal. 
Remember that there are two antennas in the link between a base station 
and a wireless network adapter—one at the access point and one at the com-
puter. A high-gain antenna at either end will have the same impact on the 
link, so when you’re operating your own network, it will be equally effective 
to replace the standard antenna on either the access point or the network 
interface. However, a directional antenna will focus most of the signal in one 
direction, so a directional access point antenna can reduce the quality of 
links to other network nodes, as shown in Figure 4-4.
Figure 4-4: Different combinations of directional and non-directional antennas can change 
the coverage area of a network.
You can find more information about external antennas later in this 
chapter. 
Interoperability
Wi-Fi certification is supposed to assure that network adapters and access 
points from different manufacturers will work together seamlessly. But there 
are a few features and configuration options that can make it difficult or 
impossible to exchange data between certain combinations of hardware. For 
example, some devices come with 128-bit encryption keys, but others use 64-bit 
keys. If an access point expects 128 bits, it won’t work with the smaller key.

Chapter 4
The easiest way to avoid this is to acquire all of your hardware from the 
same source, and make sure you’re not using incompatible models (such as 
network cards with proprietary “turbo” features). Otherwise, read the specifica-
tions carefully, test every new component type with the rest of your network 
(and one or more public hot spots) as soon as you receive them, and make 
sure your vendor will accept a return if it isn’t compatible.
Adapters and access points that use a prerelease version of the new 
802.11n (pre-n) standard are likely to have problems working with devices 
from other manufacturers because each company is using its best guess 
about the exact specifications of the new version. So it’s best to avoid pre-n 
equipment unless you have complete control of all the computers that will 
connect to your network. And even if you do, remember that you may have 
to upgrade or replace your pre-n devices after the final standard has been 
adopted. Devices that advertise upgradeability to the final 802.11n standard 
may be a better choice than devices that do not because it means you will not 
have to buy new hardware later.
Finding Drivers for Your Adapter
Like every other peripheral device you use with your computer, a wireless 
network adapter requires specific driver software that contains the controls 
and interfaces that allow the adapter to exchange data with the computer’s 
central processor. You can safely assume that the software disk supplied with 
the adapter includes a driver for Microsoft Windows XP and probably for 
Windows Vista, but that won’t do any good if the computer you’re trying to 
link to your network uses Linux or some flavor of Unix. If you’re a Macintosh 
user, Apple’s AirPort family of adapters is usually the best choice.
If you don’t get the right driver software with your network adapter, 
you’ll have to either find it someplace else or choose a different adapter that 
supports your operating system. The first place to look is the manufacturer’s 
technical support website, which probably offers a variety of drivers for free 
download. It you can’t find anything there, send a request for information 
to the manufacturer’s technical support center; they might know of a third-
party driver for your operating system or invite you to help test a new driver 
they haven’t yet released. If that fails, try an online search for <adapter make 
and model> <operating system> driver. 
If you’re a Windows user, you must install new drivers when you upgrade 
from Windows XP (or some earlier version) to Windows Vista. Some drivers 
are supplied in the Windows Vista package, but many others were not yet 
available when Vista was released. Again, the best source for new drivers is 
the adapter manufacturer’s website. If your laptop has an internal adapter, 
look for new drivers on the website maintained by the laptop maker or 
importer.
Most manufacturers work closely with Microsoft, and when new drivers 
are available, they often distribute them through the Windows Update website. 
This is the same site that Microsoft uses to distribute its own updates and 
patches, but the Automatic Updates feature does not load new drivers unless 
you specifically request them.

To check for new drivers, follow these steps:
1.
Open your Internet Explorer web browser.
2.
From the Tools menu, choose Windows Update. The Microsoft Update 
web page will appear.
3.
If you haven’t used the update tool before, it will offer to load and install 
the updating software. Go ahead and load it.
4.
When the Welcome page shown in Figure 4-5 appears, click the Custom 
button.
Figure 4-5: Use the Custom button to search for new drivers.

The update tool will examine your system and eventually display a list of 
new updates.
6.
In the column at the left side of the web page, look for Hardware, Optional 
(n), with the number of available updates inside the parentheses. Click 
the Hardware link to see a list of available updates to the network adapter 
and other devices connected to your computer.
7.
Add a checkmark to the box next to each of the updates you want to 
install. While you’re at it, go ahead and look at the High Priority and 
Software, Optional lists and select the ones you want to install; they’ll 
probably improve the computer’s overall performance. 
8.
Click the Review and Install updates link at the top of the list and follow 
the onscreen instructions to download and install the update software. 
9.
Restart the computer if the update tool instructs you to do so.

Chapter 4
Don’t give up if the neither the adapter manufacturer nor Microsoft can 
help you. Many adapters contain similar internal circuits, so it may be possible 
to use a driver with an adapter that was originally created for a different 
brand. For example, the Xircom CWE1100 adapter uses the same drivers as 
similar adapters from Cisco. See Chapter 7 for Linux and Unix driver sources 
from user groups and online archives. Without a driver, your adapter is only 
useful as a paperweight. If you can’t find the right driver for your operating 
system, look for a different adapter. This should not be a problem unless 
you’re using a very old or very cheap adapter, in which case a new one will 
almost certainly offer more features and better performance than your old 
clunker.
Ease of Use
Every wireless adapter comes with a utility program that detects nearby Wi-Fi 
signals and sets the operating mode (infrastructure or ad hoc), the channel 
number, and all of the other configuration options that must match the 
settings for the other nodes on the same network. 
NOTE
It’s always a good idea to look for the most recent software and driver updates on the 
adapter manufacturer’s website. If a web address is not printed on the adapter or in 
the printed material supplied with it, use Google or some other online search tool to 
find one.
As an alternative to the adapter manufacturers’ configuration programs, 
Microsoft includes a generic Wi-Fi program in both Windows XP and Windows 
Vista, and many laptop makers also provide their own configuration software 
as part of the customized software package supplied with new computers. So 
you might have two or three different ways to accomplish the same thing. 
Figures 4-6, 4-7, and 4-8 show the three programs supplied with a Lenovo 
ThinkPad laptop.
All three of these programs perform the same job—managing a Wi-Fi 
connection—but they present the optional settings and status information 
differently. Some use a single window with all the options in one place while 
others split things into several separate sections. Some display signal strength 
and quality as numeric values, but others show the same data in graphic form. 
Under ideal conditions, a user would never have to look at the internal 
workings of the configuration utility because most modern Wi-Fi software 
automatically matches the adapter’s settings to the signal it receives from 
each access point or ad hoc network. The configuration utility and the status 
display should both be easy to understand and use. They all contain the same 
information and options, so the choice comes down to a subjective evaluation: 
Can you look at the configuration window and understand how to choose a 
connection? Does the status display tell you at a glance whether or not you 
have a usable link to the network?

Figure 4-8: ThinkPad laptop computers include yet another way to find and use 
Wi-Fi networks.
Securing Your Network
The 802.11b specification includes a security scheme called WEP (wired 
equivalent privacy) that uses either a 64-bit or 128-bit encryption key. 
Unfortunately, the WEP encryption standard is full of holes, so it’s not 
adequate to truly protect your network against access by unauthorized users. 
The more recent WPA (Wi-Fi protected access) encryption method is more 
secure than WEP, but it’s not perfect. When you’re shopping for a new 
adapter or access point, look for one that supports WPA encryption.
Chapter 12 contains more detailed information about setting up and 
using the security features of a wireless network. The best choice, especially if 
your network has more than one brand of adapters and access points, is 
almost always to use one of the additional security methods described in 
Chapter 12 along with WEP or WPA encryption. 
Documentation and Technical Support
Every company that makes and sells Wi-Fi hardware offers some kind of 
technical support for its users. However, the quality and usefulness of that 
support varies wildly from one vendor to another. If you can’t get the 
information you need from the manufacturer, you should find a different 
supplier.
At a minimum, an adequate level of technical support should include 
an accurate and clearly written user’s manual, a support center that answers 
specific questions by telephone and email, a website with answers to fre-
quently asked questions, and a download center that offers the latest versions 
of device drivers, configuration utilities, and status display software.

The Hardware You Need for Wi-Fi
57
Each adapter and access point should come with a detailed user’s manual 
that contains clearly written instructions for installing, configuring, and using 
the equipment. It’s always a good idea to look over the manual before you 
buy any piece of computer equipment; there’s no excuse for a manual with 
confusing instructions or text that seems to have been badly translated from 
colloquial Swahili by somebody whose native language was an obscure dialect 
of Gaelic.
Even the greatest manual ever written won’t include the answers to every 
possible question, so it should also be possible to telephone or send email 
to a technical support center. It’s always nice when tech support has a toll-free 
telephone number, but it’s not essential—you probably paid more for the 
product to support that “free” service. You should be able to reach a live 
human technician within a minute or two, or if you call at a busy time, you 
should be able to leave your telephone number for a callback within a few 
hours. There is never any excuse for endless time on hold (with or without 
sappy music), or incomprehensible automated menus that never have the 
answers to your specific questions.
When you send a question by email, you should receive an acknowl-
edgment within an hour or less, even if it’s only an automated “Thanks for 
your question. We will reply with a complete answer as soon as possible.” You 
should expect an answer to your question no later than the next business day. 
And of course, the people who answer your questions should provide 
information that actually solves your problem. Bad information is worse than 
no information at all.
Most computer hardware and software companies have technical support 
websites that contain answers to the most common questions they receive 
from users. If you have access to the Web when you need a quick answer, 
that’s often the least painful way to find it. The website should also include a 
download center where you can find copies of the latest drivers and related 
software for every product that the company has ever sold, including dis-
continued models.
Reputation
It’s almost always helpful to learn about other people’s experiences with a 
wireless adapter (or anything else you might be planning to buy) before you 
spend your own money. The manufacturer and the dealer who want to sell 
the product are happy to tell you about all the positive features, but you can’t 
expect them to be completely objective.
Local user groups, published product reviews, and Internet discussions 
can all be useful sources for information about Wi-Fi equipment. It’s not 
always safe to take every review and every horror story at face value, but when 
you see or hear a dozen or more reports about a driver that crashed Windows 
or a PC Card that overheated, you can often assume that there’s some kind 
of pattern emerging. The Practically Networked website (http://www
.practicallynetworked.com/list.asp) is one good place to look for reviews and 
users’ evaluations of Wi-Fi gear.

Chapter 4
At least one major supplier of wireless network equipment has a reputa-
tion for bad tech support—long waits for a support technician by telephone 
and longer waits for replies to email combined with frequently unhelpful 
answers to questions. In a marketplace with as much competition as the Wi-Fi 
business, you don’t need to put up with a company that doesn’t (or can’t) 
provide decent support.
Adapters for Ad Hoc Networks
In an ad hoc network, every network adapter exchanges data with every other 
node through direct links without an access point acting as a central node. 
Ad hoc networks are useful for small, isolated networks and direct peer-to-peer 
file sharing. For example, somebody who uses a laptop computer on the road 
and a desktop computer in the office can set up an ad hoc network to transfer 
files between the two. Or two laptop owners might use an ad hoc connection 
to share files. 
Ad hoc wireless networks that connect two or more network nodes without 
the use of an access point are far less common than infrastructure networks, 
but they are part of the 802.11 specifications. As such, just about every network 
interface adapter and wireless configuration program offers an ad hoc network 
option.
In general, any network adapter with a Wi-Fi logo will work well in an ad 
hoc network. It’s essential that all of the nodes in the network are configured 
for ad hoc operation, and that all of the other configuration options match 
as well. Connecting directly to another computer should be no more difficult 
than connecting to an access point.
The specifications do not provide a standard for 802.11g speeds on an 
ad hoc network; however, some manufacturers support higher speeds while 
others adhere to the 11Mbit limitation described in the specification. Gen-
erally, if you need the higher speeds of 802.11g for a permanent network, 
ad hoc isn’t the best choice.
Dual-Purpose Adapters
Wi-Fi networking is wildly popular, but it’s not the only wireless technology 
out there. Several other systems are available, including Bluetooth, which 
provides very short-range connections for computer peripheral devices and 
accessories such as headphones and keyboards, and the 3G mobile data 
services that we’ll discuss in Chapter 13. Each offers solutions to a somewhat 
different set of problems, and each fills a different market niche.
Several manufacturers have announced new products that combine a 
Wi-Fi network interface adapter with an interface for some other wireless 
service. Some can detect and use both Wi-Fi networking and Bluetooth. Still 
others might combine access to Wi-Fi LANs with 3G cellular data or WiMAX. 
The benefits of a combined network interface are obvious—one device is 
more convenient to carry and install than two, and it provides access to more 

The Hardware You Need for Wi-Fi
59
networks and services. And because the same radio transmitter and receiver 
handles both services, the potential for interference is also reduced.
An ideal dual-service network adapter would automatically detect radio 
signals from all compatible networks within range and allow a user to set 
up an instant connection to any of them regardless of the type of link the 
network is using. The cost of this combined adapter should be only slightly 
more than the price of an adapter that only recognizes one networking 
protocol. Such a perfect wireless networking device may actually appear 
some time in the next few years.
The latest PDA devices, such as Apple’s iPhone, come close to this ideal. 
When the device is within range of a high-speed Wi-Fi signal, it automatically 
connects. But when there’s no Wi-Fi signal nearby, the device uses a slower 
3G network, instead.
The added cost of a dual-mode adapter might be justified if you know 
that you will be using both of the network services that the adapter supports. 
Like most other electronic equipment, these adapters will come down in 
price over time, so there’s not much reason to buy one unless you have an 
immediate need for it.
Access Points
Most wireless network interface adapters perform just one function: They 
exchange data between a computer and a network. But access points offer 
a wide variety of features and functions. They’re available as simple access 
points and in combination with hubs, switches and routers for wired connec-
tions to nearby computers and other devices. And there’s a whole category of 
wireless access points for home networks called residential gateways.
The physical design of an access point is less important than the design 
of an interface adapter because access points don’t have to fit into a com-
puter’s card slot or an expansion bay. Some are built into simple rectangular 
boxes while others are in odd-shaped enclosures that may look more distinc-
tive. The appearance of the package is less important than the features and 
functions inside, especially when the access point will be placed out of sight 
in a closet or hidden behind a false ceiling. Regardless of the shape, most 
access points include mounting plates, brackets, or other hardware for attach-
ing the device to a wall or shelf. 
There are a handful of other general features that you might want to 
look for when you select an access point. If your site survey tells you that you 
will need high-gain antennas, or if you want to place an antenna outdoors or 
in some other isolated location, you should use an access point with an exter-
nal antenna connector instead of a permanently mounted captive antenna. 
In a high-traffic network where you plan to use more than one radio channel 
at the same time, a single access point that contains two radio modules can 
replace two separate access points. And if the best location for your access 
point is not close to an AC power outlet, choose a model that offers an 
optional power over Ethernet or active Ethernet feature. 

60
Chapter 4
The best way to choose the type of access point to use in your network is 
to decide what kind of connections you’re likely to need. Are you adding 
wireless access to an existing wired network? Or do you want to provide some 
new wired links along with the wireless service? Do you want to use the wireless 
network to share Internet access? The answers to all of these questions will 
help you choose the right access point for your network.
Operating Standards
When you are designing a new Wi-Fi network for your home or office, where 
you can also select the network adapters for each computer that will connect 
to the network, you can use an access point that supports only one of the Wi-Fi 
standards. But if you want to provide Wi-Fi access to visitors or to the general 
public, your base station should support as many standards as possible. Several 
manufacturers offer dual-band access points or routers that produce both 
802.11a and 802.11g signals (an 802.11g access point will also work with an 
802.11b adapter). For example, the Linksys router shown in Figure 4-9 pro-
vides access using all three standards.

Wireless Router uses both 802.11a and 802.11g 
signaling.
Pure Wireless LANs
When all the nodes in a LAN exchange data by radio, the access point acts 
as a hub that provides the central control point for the network as shown in 
Figure 4-10. Strictly speaking, the access point in this kind of network does 
not provide access to anything except other wireless nodes. This kind of 
wireless connection is one of the basic functions of any access point, so you 
should select the simplest and least expensive model that can provide a 
usable signal to your coverage area.

The Hardware You Need for Wi-Fi

Figure 4-10: A simple wireless network without any external connections
This kind of simple wireless network is possible, but there’s not much 
reason to use an access point in a purely wireless LAN. You can accomplish 
the same thing in an ad hoc wireless network that creates direct point-to-point 
links without the need to go through a central hub. About the only time a 
pure-wireless infrastructure network (with an access point) might make sense 
would be when you expect to start with wireless links and later expand the 
network to include a wired Ethernet connection to a fileserver, a shared 
Internet connection, or more computers and workstations.
Wireless Access to a Wired LAN
Any access point can act as a base station that adds wireless links to an 
existing wired LAN like the one shown in Figure 4-11. The access point 
presents the same appearance to the rest of the network as a subsidiary hub 
or switch that connects wired nodes to the network.

Chapter 4
In this kind of hybrid wired and wireless LAN, each device on the network 
can exchange data with every other network node regardless of how it is 
connected. It doesn’t matter if a particular device is connected to the LAN 
through a wire or over a radio link, it’s all one seamless network. 
An access point that acts as a bridge between the wired and wireless 
sections of the network usually has a single 10Mbps or 100Mbps RJ-45 
Ethernet port for connecting a cable from the wired LAN. On higher-end 
equipment, there’s often an additional serial or USB port for a remote 
terminal that the network manager uses to enter configuration commands 
and receive status information.
Combining the Access Point with a Wired Hub 
In a new LAN that includes both wired connections and wireless links, the 
best approach may be a single device that combines the functions of a wireless 
access point with a wired hub or switch, as shown in Figure 4-12. This kind 
of access point is sometimes described as a broadband router.
Figure 4-12: A wireless access point combined with a broadband 
switch controls both the wireless and wired segments of a hybrid 
network.
A broadband router typically has three kinds of network connections:
 Radio links to computers equipped with wireless Ethernet adapters
 One or more Ethernet ports for wired links to computers with network 
interface cards
 A broadband wide area network (WAN) port for connecting the router 
to the network backbone or for stacking the router with additional hubs 
or switches
Some routers also include a print server that can move documents 
directly to a network printer.

The major benefits of a combined access point and hub are convenience 
and economy in a home office or a small business where it’s easy to run cables 
to some of the network computers. A combined unit may also be the quickest 
way to extend an existing network to both wired and wireless nodes in a 
remote location. 
Broadband Gateways
A broadband gateway is an access point that includes a port for direct connec-
tion to a DSL or cable modem that supplies high-speed access to the Internet, 
as shown in Figure 4-13. Some gateway devices also include several RJ-45 
Ethernet ports for wired connections to local computers.
Figure 4-13: An access point combined with a broadband gateway 
supports a wireless network that shares a high-speed Internet connection.
This approach is most practical in a home network or small business 
where the service entry for the broadband Internet service runs all the way 
to the office, rather than stopping at a service entry or a telephone closet, 
because the access point must be placed in the best possible location to 
provide wireless network coverage.
Multiple Access Points
A single access point can be completely adequate to support a wireless LAN 
in an open, relatively small space with a moderate volume of traffic. But when 
your network must cover a very large area (greater than about 100 feet in 
diameter), a space obstructed by walls, furniture, or other objects, or inter-
ference from other radios, you will probably have to add more access points.

Chapter 4
The Wi-Fi specification includes a roaming function that automatically 
hands off a network link from one access point to another when the signal 
quality through the new access point is better than the original connection. 
Most home networks and many networks in very small businesses will need 
only one access point, so choosing an access point that supports roaming 
is only a problem for managers of large and complex networks. 
After a network client associates with an access point, it automatically 
surveys all of the other radio channels to determine if some other access 
point operating on a different channel will provide a stronger or cleaner 
signal than the one it is currently using. When the client finds a channel that 
can support a faster link than the current one, it drops the old association 
and immediately associates with the best available signal source. 
Therefore, access points with overlapping coverage areas should be set 
to different channel numbers. For the least amount of interference from one 
access point to the next, the channel numbers of any pair of adjacent access 
points should be at least five channels apart. 
In most cases, a network client will not associate with a different access 
point unless the client moves to a different location while the network link is 
active or the amount of traffic on the current channel increases. In other 
words, a hand off can occur when a user carries a laptop or PDA from one 
place to another and when it becomes necessary for the network to balance 
the load among all of the available access points.
As Figure 4-14 shows, all of the access points must be connected together 
through a conventional wired LAN that might also include additional com-
puters and servers that don’t require a wireless connection. 
In most cases, multiple access points should be placed to provide coverage 
that overlaps by about 30 percent from one access point to the next. But when 
your wireless network must support a large number of simultaneous users, 
the best way to balance the load may be to install two or more access points 
in the same place with each access point set to a different, non-interfering 
radio channel. 
Figure 4-14: Multiple access points on a wired LAN allow wireless users to roam throughout a larger coverage 
area than any single access point can serve by itself.

Roaming is covered by the Wi-Fi standard, so it should be possible to use 
different brands of access points in the same network. They’re all supposed 
to work together. But each access point includes a proprietary configuration 
utility, and each may have a somewhat different design, so a network with 
only one brand of access point will almost always be easier to configure and 
use than a mixed network. Building a wireless network is complicated enough; 
it’s always a good idea to eliminate a possible source of confusion.
Enhanced-Performance Access Points
Several manufacturers offer access points and routers with enhancements 
and special features that can improve the signal quality or performance in 
difficult settings. For example, you might see devices advertised as extended 
range or high-speed access points. Some of these systems improve performance 
by splitting data into two or more parallel streams and transmitting those 
streams on more than one channel at the same time.
If one of these enhanced access points comes from a major manufacturer, 
it will probably perform as advertised, but it’s always a good idea to look for 
independent reviews from magazines and websites before you commit your-
self. The improved performance promised by these access points will only 
occur when you’re using a compatible network adapter, which is probably 
only made by the same manufacturer who built the access point. When you 
try to connect to an enhanced access point from any other network device, 
the network performance will be no better than a less expensive access point 
without the enhanced features.
External Antennas
If you can establish a reliable high-speed data link to any location in your 
network’s coverage area with the antennas built into your network adapters 
and the captive antennas attached to your access points, there is absolutely 
no reason to waste any time, money, or energy on external antennas. When 
you reach the maximum possible speed, better antennas won’t move the data 
any faster.
But when reception conditions are less than perfect, and when you want 
to push a radio signal as far as you possibly can, a separate antenna can cut 
through interference, increase data transfer speed, expand the network’s 
coverage area, and establish reliable communication links in places where 
they would be little more than a rumor if you use adapters and access points 
with plain vanilla internal antennas.
At first glance, it would appear that the easiest way to improve the quality 
of a radio signal would be to crank up the power that comes out of the trans-
mitter. Instead of the wimpy 30 milliwatts (0.030 of a watt) produced by most 
wireless adapters, why not boost it to 10 or 20 watts or more? Wouldn’t that 
produce a much stronger signal? 
Sure it would, but the FCC and the other agencies around the world that 
regulate radio services won’t let you do it. More powerful radios would pro-
duce stronger signals that would create a lot more interference over wider 

66
Chapter 4
areas, which would mean that fewer users could share the same piece of the 
radio spectrum. By comparison, the television station that uses channel 4 in 
New York City transmits with 100,000 watts of output power, but the nearest 
station that uses the same channel is in Boston, a few hundred miles away. 
On the other hand, the radios in a wireless LAN use less than a watt, so the 
signal is almost inaudible a few hundred feet away. 
Since you can’t increase the amount of power produced by the radio 
transmitters, the next best method for improving signal quality is to optimize 
the performance of the antennas.
Radio antennas come in two types: omnidirectional antennas that transmit 
and receive in all directions at equal strength and directional antennas that 
focus their energy and sensitivity in a specific direction. In a wireless LAN, an 
access point with an omnidirectional antenna is most useful when you want 
to cover a wide area. A network adapter with an omnidirectional antenna 
can communicate equally well with any nearby access point. If the coverage 
area you want to reach with your wireless LAN extends beyond the distance 
you can cover with internal omnidirectional antennas, you can expect to 
increase the coverage area by about 15 percent with an external antenna.
In other words, if the signal quality of your link begins to fade at a 
distance of 100 feet between a network node and the closest access point, 
you can extend the useful signal range to about 115 feet by using an external 
omnidirectional antenna on either the access point or the network adapter. 
If you use external antennas at both ends, you can expect to reach about 
132 feet. Of course, that 100-foot value is just an easy-to-calculate example. 
The actual signal range of a pair of internal antennas might be very different 
depending on obstructions between the two devices and interference from 
other radio signals, but the 15 percent improvement rate for each antenna 
will remain about the same. 
The shape of a directional antenna’s coverage area and the amount of 
gain (signal strength from the transmitter and sensitivity to the receiver) 
depend on the exact design of each antenna. Some directional antennas can 
provide a moderate amount of gain over a broad pattern (like a floodlight) 
while others can focus three or four (or more) times as much gain over a 
much narrower area (like a spotlight). 
Directional antennas can provide a huge improvement in signal quality 
over a tightly focused coverage area, and they can also reduce interference 
from null areas outside of that coverage pattern. Therefore, they can have 
several uses in a wireless LAN:
 They can allow a user outside the normal coverage area to join the 
network.
 They can increase the effective coverage area served by an access point 
by limiting the coverage to one direction.
 They can reduce or eliminate the effect of off-axis interference from 
other radio signals.
 They can reduce the amount of interference that a wireless LAN creates 
for other radios.

Directional antennas come in many shapes and sizes. The next section 
describes the major types of antennas and offers some suggestions about 
choosing the best type for your network. 
Antenna Characteristics
External antennas come in many shapes and sizes. When you select an 
antenna, you should consider coverage pattern, gain, form factor, and 
weatherproofing.
Coverage Pattern
The specification sheet for every antenna includes a diagram that shows the 
shape of the antenna’s coverage pattern. In general, the pattern will be either 
omnidirectional (an antenna that radiates or receives equally well in all direc-
tions), directional (with the strongest radiation or reception in one direction), 
or figure eight (with strong coverage toward the front and back of the antenna 
and weak coverage to and from the sides).
Catalog listings and specification sheets for directional antennas usually 
include an aperture angle, beam width, or capture area expressed in degrees. 
The aperture angle is the section of a circle that contains the antenna’s 
maximum power coverage or sensitivity. For example, if an antenna has an 
aperture angle of 45 degrees, the maximum coverage or sensitivity extends 
outward from the front of the antenna at a 45 degree angle.
Most manufacturers will tell you the beam width in more than one plane. 
This might be important information when you’re planning to place an access 
point’s antenna on a wall, roof, or tower and you want to exchange data with 
network nodes on the ground.
Gain
The gain of an antenna is the ratio of the transmitting power or receiving 
sensitivity when compared to a standard dipole antenna (a dipole is a straight, 
center-fed, half-wavelength antenna, such as the T-shaped twin-lead antenna 
supplied with many FM radios and tuners). The gain is usually expressed as 
dbi (decibels over isotropic). An antenna with a high dbi value has more gain 
than one with a lower value.
There’s often a trade-off between an antenna’s beam width and its gain. 
This occurs because an antenna with a tight aperture angle focuses the same 
amount of power (or sensitivity) into a smaller area.
Form Factor
A dipole antenna for a 2.4 GHz radio is only about an inch long, but the 
reflectors and other elements that add gain and directional characteristics 
might be much longer than that. Many antennas are supplied inside a 
protective cover that does not affect their performance, but it keeps the 
actual antenna clean and dry and makes it easier to mount the antenna on a 
pole or a wall.

68
Chapter 4
Omnidirectional antennas are almost always vertical whips or shafts no 
more than two or three inches in diameter. Some high-gain omnis can be 
as much as two or three feet long. For indoor use, especially in rooms with 
dropped ceilings, a special omnidirectional ceiling mount antenna can be 
an excellent choice for a wireless network.
Directional antennas can take many shapes, including parabolic dishes 
and panels that include a reflector behind the active part of the antenna; 
antennas that resemble a shorter version of a rooftop TV antenna; and 
patch or panel antennas with several radiating elements, usually within a 
flat enclosure that resembles a smoke detector or mounted on a swivel that 
makes it possible to aim the antenna more precisely.
Weatherproofing
Outdoor antennas usually need some kind of protection from rain and snow 
and from ultraviolet radiation that can deteriorate the materials from which 
the antenna is constructed. Therefore, many manufacturers offer antennas 
with sealed elements inside weatherproof enclosures.
A weatherproof enclosure doesn’t serve any purpose indoors where the 
goal should be to make the antenna as unobtrusive as possible. Some antennas 
are advertised for indoor/outdoor use, but the only thing they will do for an 
indoor installation is increase the cost.
When you mount an antenna outside, remember to consider the 
damage that could occur if lightning strikes your antenna (or near your 
antenna). This is especially crucial for antennas mounted on rooftops and 
poles. Special in-line lightning arrestors are available that can prevent a 
lightning strike from traveling through the network wires to damage other 
equipment in your building.
How to Choose an Antenna
It’s important to remember that there’s no good reason to install an antenna 
with more gain than you can actually use. If you can establish a clean link with 
a low-gain antenna, your network won’t perform any better or move data any 
faster just because the access point’s antenna is sending and receiving stronger 
signals. In fact, the overall signal quality might not be as good with a better 
antenna because it will pick up more noise and interference from other 
networks and other 2.4 GHz devices.
The standard omnidirectional antenna should be your first choice unless 
you have a good reason to use something else. If you need a directional 
antenna, choose one that covers the area you want to reach as efficiently as 
possible. If you don’t need to cover an enormous area, don’t waste your 
money on a high-gain antenna. The least amount of gain necessary to reach 
all the nodes in your network will work as well or better than a bigger and 
more expensive antenna that pushes a signal out to places where nobody 
except unauthorized users will ever receive it.

The Hardware You Need for Wi-Fi
69
It’s always a good idea to buy your antennas from the same supplier 
as the radios that you will use with them, in order to prevent unpleasant 
finger-pointing between two or more vendors when something doesn’t work 
properly. But if your network requires some kind of special antenna that you 
can’t get from the people who make or sell your radios, don’t be afraid to go 
to a specialist dealer.
Rolling Your Own
Some wireless network designers and experimenters have designed a whole 
class of home brew antennas for 2.4 GHz operation using such cheap and 
easily obtainable materials as an empty Pringles potato chips canister. We’ll 
describe these antennas in more detail in Chapter 10, which describes 
long-range point-to-point network links.
Unless you already have a workshop full of tools and test equipment and 
you’re really fond of salted snacks made out of potato flakes, these homemade 
antennas don’t offer any particular advantages over a commercial antenna 
with well-defined performance characteristics. After you calculate the cost of 
materials and the value of the time needed to assemble and test a home brew 
antenna (including the obligatory trip to your local big-box Home Center and 
Hardware Emporium, where you will spend at least 45 minutes searching for 
the right mounting brackets), the price of a store-bought antenna doesn’t 
seem to be all that expensive. For example, you can buy a directional antenna 
with higher gain than the standard Pringles version from HyperGain (http://
www.hyperlinktech.com/web/antennas) for about $50. 
Where to Use a Directional Antenna
There are three ways to use directional antennas: on an access point, on a 
network adapter, and on both an access point and a network adapter.
On an Access Point
A directional antenna on an access point will provide a stronger signal to all 
the network nodes within the access point’s coverage area. Therefore, it will 
reach users who are farther away from the access point and improve the signal 
quality for users who are closer at the expense of users who are not located 
within the antenna’s coverage pattern.
In a network that requires several access points to provide complete cover-
age, an access point with a directional antenna at one end of the intended 
coverage area may be more efficient than an omnidirectional antenna. As 
Figure 4-15 shows, the directional antenna can concentrate all of the signal 
in places where it will be used instead of flinging it out equally in all directions. 
In this example, the directional antenna’s coverage angle is about 90 degrees, 
so it reaches the interior of the building, but it doesn’t waste a lot of power on 
signals to other areas where nobody will want them.

70
Chapter 4
Figure 4-15: A combination of directional and omnidirectional antennas 
may be the best way to cover a large or odd-shaped area.
Directional antennas can also extend coverage in one direction and 
direct signals into dead spots and other places where the access points with 
omnidirectional antennas don’t provide adequate signals.
On a Network Adapter
The second option is to place a high-gain directional antenna on a wireless 
network adapter and point the antenna at an access point with an omni-
directional antenna. This might be the best way to add a node to a network 
through an access point that is also serving other, closer network clients. To 
eliminate the cost and inconvenience of installing another access point or 
running an Ethernet cable to a single isolated user, try using a directional 
antenna on that user’s network adapter.
On Both an Access Point and a Network Adapter
A network link that uses directional high-gain antennas at both ends can 
cover a lot of ground. A link from a rooftop to a hilltop location might reach 
several miles or more if there’s a clean line of sight without obstruction from 
trees or buildings between the two ends. Aiming the two antennas at each 
other for maximum signal strength can be very critical for long-distance links; 
turning one antenna (or both) just a few degrees can make the difference 
between a strong signal and no signal at all. The coverage angles of dish and 
parabolic antennas can be extremely tight.

The Hardware You Need for Wi-Fi
71
As you move the two ends of a radio link apart, two more complications 
arise. The curvature of the earth and an electromagnetic phenomenon called 
the Fresnel zone can get in the way, unless the antennas are high enough to 
avoid them. At 2.4 GHz, the average height of the two antennas must be at 
least 13 feet above the ground or other obstructions for a 1-mile link. At 
5 miles, the minimum height increases to 35 feet, and at 10 miles, the min-
imum height is 57 feet.
Antennas Are a Whole Other World
Long-range links are almost always solutions to uncommon problems, such 
as providing access to a place where no other network service is available or 
adding users in a remote building to a campus or corporate network. Adding 
a directional antenna that fills a dead spot in an indoor network or a panel 
antenna that mounts on a roof or an outside wall to cover a parking lot doesn’t 
make your network much more complicated than using access points with 
omnidirectional antennas. But when you start to think about antennas with 
complex patterns and very high gain, you’re moving beyond what a book 
about wireless LANs can cover. You need expert help. 
Before you can install a big, powerful antenna, you (or somebody working 
for you) must pay attention to things like wind loading (you don’t want the 
antenna to fall down in a storm), local zoning ordinances (lots of people 
think antennas are ugly or dangerous or both, so they have rules about where 
and how you can put them up), and protection from weather and wildlife 
(you don’t want the antenna to ice up in the winter or play host to a family of 
birds in the spring). And you’ll probably want to use an expensive piece of 
test equipment called a spectrum analyzer to aim the two antennas at each 
other. 
If you don’t have experience with this stuff, you’ll either need to find help 
from somebody who does or spend a lot of time experimenting. If that’s your 
idea of fun, have yourself a fine time. You can find more detailed information 
about long-range point-to-point links in Chapter 10.
It’s Time to Buy
This chapter describes the different kinds of wireless network adapters, access 
points, and antennas that you will need to connect your computer to a Wi-Fi 
hot spot, construct a new wireless LAN, or add wireless access to your existing 
wired network. The next step is to make some choices and gather all of the 
hardware together. You’re ready to install the wireless hardware. In the next 
chapter, you can find step-by-step procedures for installing different kinds of 
adapters and access points and for running the configuration utility programs 
that make all those pieces work together in a network.

In general, installing a wireless network 
adapter is easy because most network 
adapters are plug-and-play devices. As soon 
as you connect the adapter to your computer, 
or as soon as you turn on an internal adapter or 
your computer, the computer automatically detects 
the device and runs the control software to set up a 
connection.
This chapter will explain how to set up a Wi-Fi connection for two kinds 
of users: the home or office user who wants to connect to a fixed access point 
once and assume that is keeps working every time; and a laptop user who wants 
to connect to different networks in different locations.

Chapter 5
Installing PC Card Adapters
Network adapters on PC Cards plug into the PCMCIA socket on a portable 
computer or the socket adapter that fits an expansion slot in a desktop com-
puter (yes, that does mean that one kind of adapter sometimes plugs into 
another kind of adapter). To install the PC Card, just insert it gently but 
firmly into the socket. When it’s properly seated, you should feel the holes 
on the edge of the card grab the pins inside the socket.
Most wireless PC Card adapters contain internal antennas that extend an 
inch or more beyond the outer edge of the PCMCIA socket. However, a few 
adapters come with connectors for external antennas. If you are using an 
external antenna, place the antenna in the location where you want to 
operate it, and run the antenna cable from the antenna to the network 
adapter’s antenna connector. Be gentle. Often the tiny connectors used by 
laptop adapters are fragile, and damaging the connectors or cables can lead 
to loss of signal.
Installing USB Adapters
Most USB wireless adapters are compact devices with one or more internal 
antennas or with external antennas that are connected to the adapter through 
a hinge that allows the antenna element to move around, like the one shown 
in Figure 5-1. Because the adapter connects to the computer through a cable, 
it’s easy to move the whole adapter around when the first position you try 
doesn’t detect an adequate signal from the access point.

permanently attached external antenna.

Managing Your Wi-Fi Connections
75
To install a USB adapter, follow these steps:
1.
Run a USB cable from the computer to the location where you plan to 
place the adapter. Note that the two ends of a USB cable have different 
type of connectors, so make sure the connector at the computer end of 
the cable mates with the computer’s USB port.
2.
Plug the cable into the computer’s USB port. Plug the other end of the 
cable into the network adapter. In most cases, Windows will automatically 
detect the adapter and guide you through the process of loading the 
driver software.
3.
If Windows can’t find the device driver for your adapter, look for a driver 
online, either at the manufacturer’s website or at one of the other sites 
listed later in this chapter, and instruct Windows to use that driver file.
4.
Run the configuration program provided with your adapter or use the 
Wireless Configuration Tool included with Windows XP.
5.
Open the signal strength and signal quality display.
6.
If the signal quality is not good or excellent (at least three bars out of 
five), try adjusting the antenna position or moving the adapter for optimal 
performance. 
Installing an Internal Adapter in a Laptop Computer
Most new laptops include a built-in Wi-Fi adapter on a mini-PCI card that 
mounts directly on the computer’s motherboard. If you ordered your com-
puter without an internal Wi-Fi card and decide to install one later, or if you 
want to replace the existing card with a new and better model (such as a card 
that includes the new 802.11n specification when such cards become avail-
able), you must open up the computer to reach the adapter.
Don’t try to take apart a laptop computer without specific instructions 
for your particular make and model. Laptops are all designed to squeeze as 
many parts and features as possible into a very small package, and there’s 
usually just one correct way to get to each component. Unless you find and 
remove exactly the right set of screws and covers in exactly the right order, 
you probably won’t get to the part or socket you want, but you will create a 
whole new set of problems.
Fortunately, most laptop makers offer detailed step-by-step instructions 
for removing and installing an internal Wi-Fi card in service manuals and 
online tech support websites. Before you try to open up the computer, it’s 
absolutely necessary to read the full procedure in the manual or online. If 
there’s an online video that shows the procedure, watch the whole thing, 
and then step through it again (if you have a second computer to watch it 
on) as you install your new card.

76
Chapter 5
Installing an Internal Adapter in a Desktop System
Adding an internal adapter to a desktop computer is a bit more complicated 
because it requires opening the case and inserting the adapter into an expan-
sion slot. But it’s no different from adding any other expansion card, which 
most network managers and serious home computer users have probably 
done more times than they care to think about. 
You know the routine: Unplug the power cable. Open the case. Find a 
vacant expansion slot. Remove the metal backplane cover. Insert the adapter 
into the slot. Screw it down. Close the case. Plug the power cable back into 
the computer. Lather. Rinse. Repeat.
Many internal network adapters are actually PC Card adapters with 
PCMCIA sockets that fit into an expansion slot. Unless the adapter manual 
tells you otherwise, it’s a good idea to remove the PC Card from the socket 
before you install the socket in your computer. It often takes a bit of twisting 
and pushing to seat the socket properly in the expansion slot, and the socket 
is more flexible without the card in place. After you reassemble the computer, 
insert the adapter into the socket and load the wireless adapter driver.
Loading the Driver Software
Regardless of their physical format, just about all wireless adapters are plug-
and-play devices, which means that Windows should automatically recognize 
the adapter and load the relevant drivers as soon as you install it. However, 
sometimes you’ll need to install a specific software driver manually before 
your operating system can use the adapter to send and receive data.
Drivers can come from three sources: some are supplied with the operat-
ing system or a copy might have been provided on a diskette or a CD with the 
adapter. But the best source for the most recent version of any driver is the 
manufacturer’s online technical support website. You can also find links to 
the latest Windows drivers for your adapter from one of these driver directories 
on the Internet:
http://www.driverzone.com
http://www.driverguide.com
http://www.drivershq.com
http://www.mrdriver.com
http://www.winfiles.com
http://www.windrivers.com
In most cases, the same software disk or download that includes the 
driver for a wireless network adapter also contains the configuration and 
control utility program for that adapter. You should install the driver and 
load the software before you physically install or connect the adapter.
The first time you insert a PC Card in the PCMCIA socket or plug a USB 
adapter into the computer’s USB port, Windows will identify the adapter and 
run its Found New Hardware Wizard, as shown in Figure 5-2. Assuming you 

Managing Your Wi-Fi Connections
77
have already loaded the latest version of the driver and the configuration 
utility, choose the Install the software automatically option. Windows will 
automatically find and install the driver. If it doesn’t find the driver, choose 
the Install from a list or specific location option to direct Windows to the driver 
files in a download file or a CD.
NOTE
Windows Vista presents a different set of screens when it detects new hardware, but the 
automatic installation is very similar. When in doubt, follow the instructions on your 
screen.
Figure 5-2: Windows offers to load a driver the first time it detects new hardware.
After it installs the driver, Windows will instruct you to restart the 
computer. Some configuration utilities run automatically whenever a 
wireless adapter is active; others require a user to start the program from 
the Start Programs menu or from an icon in the Windows Desktop. If the 
configuration program does not open in a program window, it will display a 
status icon in the System Tray next to the clock.
In Linux and Unix systems, you might have to install your driver 
manually. Chapter 7 describes Linux and Unix drivers in more detail.
Choosing a Control Program
In Windows your computer has at least two or three different programs that 
can control your Wi-Fi adapter and configure the wireless connection to a 
network. One of these programs was included with Windows and another 
comes with the network adapter. Yet another program might be part of the 
bundled software supplied by the maker of your laptop computer. All of 
these programs perform the same tasks, and they all display similar informa-
tion, but each one arranges the commands and displays differently.
It’s worth the time and trouble to try all of the Wi-Fi programs installed 
on your computer because you will probably find one that is easier to use 
than any of the others. It’s also possible that one program is more sensitive to 
marginal signals.

78
Chapter 5
The way you use your Wi-Fi control program depends on how you use 
wireless connections. If you keep the computer in one place most of the time 
with a Wi-Fi link to the Internet and your home or office network, you should 
configure the Wi-Fi control program to automatically find and use your own 
network every time you turn on the computer. On the other hand, if you’re 
mainly using the computer as a portable unit that you move from place to 
place, the control program should detect and display all the nearby Wi-Fi 
signals and allow you to choose the one you want to use. We’ll cover both 
scenarios below.
NOTE
When you don’t plan to connect your laptop computer to the Internet or a local network, 
use the hardware or software switch on the computer to completely turn off the radio.
The Microsoft Wireless Network Connection Utility
Windows includes a Wireless Network Connection utility that supports just 
about every wireless network adapter. When Windows detects a Wi-Fi adapter, 
it automatically runs the Wireless Network Connection utility unless you have 
instructed the computer to use a different control program. 
To switch between control programs, you just need to right-click the active 
Wi-Fi control program in the System Tray. Figure 5-3 shows the pop-up menu 
command in Windows XP that transfers control to the Intel PROSet/Wireless 
program. 
Figure 5-3: Use the pop-up command in the System Tray 
to shift control to the Intel Wi-Fi control program.
Connecting to an Access Point in Windows XP
To set up a Wi-Fi network connection using the Microsoft program in 
Windows XP, follow these steps:
1.
From the Windows desktop, double-click the Wireless Network 
Connection icon in the System Tray (shown in Figure 5-4) at the lower 
right corner of your screen (to the left of the clock). 
Figure 5-4: Windows uses this icon to control 
the Wireless Network Connection program.

Managing Your Wi-Fi Connections
79
2.
The Wireless Network Connection program shown in Figure 5-5 will 
show one or more nearby Wi-Fi access points. In this example, the 
program has detected five different networks.
Figure 5-5: The Wireless Network Connection utility displays information about every 
nearby wireless access point.
3.
Like the display on a mobile telephone’s screen, the Wireless Network 
Connection window uses five bars (at the right of each listing) to show 
the relative strength of each incoming signal. Choose the name of the 
wireless network you want to join, and click the Connect button near the 
bottom of the window. 
4.
If you have used this network before, the Wireless Network Connection 
program will automatically set up the wireless link. If it’s the first time 
you have connected to this network, the program might ask for an 
encryption key or other security code. If necessary, type the key code 
provided by the owner of the access point.
5.
After the program sets up a wireless link, it identifies the connection in 
the list of networks, as shown in Figure 5-6. In this example, the com-
puter is connected to the SampleNetwork access point.
When your network connection is up and running, you can close the 
Wireless Network Connection window.

80
Chapter 5
Figure 5-6: The connected flag in the SampleNetwork listing tells you that your computer 
is connected to that network. The star indicates that this is a preferred network.
Connecting to an Access Point in Windows Vista
Setting up a Wi-Fi connection in Vista works in a similar manner to XP, but 
the screens are different. Follow these steps to establish a wireless link:
1.
If it’s not already on, turn on the wireless adapter in your laptop or plug 
the adapter into a USB port. The Network Connections icon shown in 
Figure 5-7 will appear in the Notification Area (the System Tray). 
Figure 5-7: Click the Network Connections 
icon to open a Wi-Fi connection.
2.
Click the Network Connections icon to open the information window 
shown in Figure 5-8.

Managing Your Wi-Fi Connections
81
Figure 5-8: The Network Connections information 
window lets you know if one or more wireless 
networks are within range.
3.
Choose the Connect to a Network option. The Select a Network To 
Connect To window shown in Figure 5-9 will appear.
Figure 5-9: The Select a Network To Connect To window displays a list of all nearby 
wireless networks.

82
Chapter 5
4.
Select the name of the network you want to use and click the Connect 
button at the bottom of the window. If the network is encrypted and a 
security window appears, type the correct security key for this network. 
If the network is not protected by encryption, Windows will make the 
connection immediately.
5.
Move your mouse cursor over the Network Connections icon in the 
System Tray. If the pop-up window shows Access: Local Only, click the icon 
and choose the Network and Sharing Center option to open the window 
shown in Figure 5-10.
Figure 5-10: The Network and Sharing Center window shows the current status of 
your network connection.
6.
To connect your computer to the Internet, click the red X in the diagram 
between the local network and the Internet. Windows will examine your 
connection and establish a link to the Internet.
Making an Automatic Connection
Most of us use a limited number of access points and network services to con-
nect our computers to the Internet. When you’re using a wireless link to 
connect to your home or office network, or if most of your connections are at 
the coffee shop, the library, or the airport club that you visit frequently, you 
should set the control program to find and use those access points whenever 
they detect their signals. Windows calls these preferred networks.

Managing Your Wi-Fi Connections
83
Setting Up a Preferred Network in Windows XP
To create a preferred network profile, follow these steps:
1.
Take your computer to the location where you want to connect to a Wi-Fi 
network.
2.
If the computer has a built-in Wi-Fi adapter, turn the adapter on. If the 
computer uses an external adapter, plug the adapter into a PC Card 
socket or connect it to a USB port. The Wireless Network Connection 
program should detect one or more nearby networks and display them 
in a list.
3.
Double-click the name of the network you want to set as your preferred 
network. If the network is encrypted, the program will ask for a network 
key, as shown in Figure 5-11. Type the network key in both fields and 
click Connect to join the network. If the network is not encrypted, the 
program will connect your computer to the network immediately. Either 
way, it will add this network to your list of preferred networks.
Figure 5-11: When the Wi-Fi control program detects an 
encrypted network, it will ask for the network key.
The next time you turn on your computer when you’re within range of 
this network, the Wireless Network Connection program will automatically 
make the connection without the need to choose it from a list. 
If you have identified two or more preferred networks (for making 
connections in different locations), the program will connect in the order 
that they appear in the list in the Wireless Network Connection Properties 
dialog box.
NOTE
Windows uses the SSID (the name of each network) to identify a preferred network. 
Therefore, it will automatically connect to any network that has that SSID. This can be 
convenient when you use your computer in more than one coffee shop owned by the same 
chain, but it could be a problem if your preferred network’s owner hasn’t changed the 
default SSID on an access point. 

84
Chapter 5
In most cases, the order of the networks on your list of preferred networks 
won’t make any difference because they will be physically separated from one 
another—one might be at home, a second at the library, and yet another in a 
coffee shop. But if two or more preferred networks have overlapping coverage 
areas, you might want to change the order of the items in the list. To change 
the order, follow these steps:
1.
From the Wireless Network Connection window, click the Change 
Advanced Settings option in the list of Related Tasks at the left side of 
the window.
2.
In the Properties window, choose the Wireless Networks tab to open the 
dialog box shown in Figure 5-12. 
Figure 5-12: Use the Move Up and Move Down buttons to 
change the order of items in the list of Preferred Networks.
3.
In the list of Preferred Networks, choose one of the items and use the 
Move Up and Move Down buttons to change its position on the list. 
Repeat until all the items on the list are in the order you want.
Setting Up a Preferred Network in Windows Vista
In Windows Vista, to make the current Wi-Fi connection the default connec-
tion that will automatically open whenever your computer is within range of 
that network’s signal, follow these steps:
1.
Right-click the Network Connections icon in the System Tray and choose 
Connect to a Network from the pop-up menu.

Managing Your Wi-Fi Connections
85
2.
Right-click the name of the network that you want to set as the default 
and choose Properties from the pop-up menu. Choose the Connection 
tab to open the window shown in Figure 5-13.
Figure 5-13: Use the options in the Connection tab to set 
a default network.
3.
Choose the Connect automatically when this network is in range option, 
and click the OK button at the bottom of the window.
4.
Close all the open windows. 
Disconnecting from an Access Point
To disconnect your computer from a wireless network, follow these steps:
1.
Right-click the Wireless Network Connection icon in the System Tray.
2.
Choose View Available Wireless Networks from the pop-up menu. The 
Wireless Network Connection window will appear.
3.
Click the name of the network that is currently connected.
4.
Click the Disconnect button.
Viewing Technical Details
In almost all cases, the Wireless Network Connection utility automatically 
detects nearby access points and sets up a Wi-Fi connection for you without 
any need to pay attention to technical details like the preamble length or the 
amount of power that the radio transmitter is using. But when you have a 

86
Chapter 5
problem, or when you or your technical support advisor wants to troubleshoot 
a flaky connection, follow these steps to open the Properties window for your 
wireless network adapter:
1.
From the Wireless Network Connections window, click the Change 
Advanced Settings item in the list of Related Tasks.
2.
In the Wireless Network Connection Properties window, click the 
Configure button next to the name of your wireless network adapter 
to see the window shown in Figure 5-14, where you can view or change 
some of the more obscure configuration settings. As you scroll down the 
Property list, the text in the Description box will tell you what each item 
means.
Figure 5-14: The Advanced tab of the Network Connection 
Properties window controls several rarely-used configuration 
settings.
The Intel PROSet/Wireless Program
If your computer came with an Intel mini-PCI Wi-Fi adapter, a version of the 
PROSet/Wireless control and configuration program was probably pre-
loaded on the system along with Windows and the laptop maker’s proprietary 
software. 
The PROSet program does the same thing as the Microsoft Wireless 
Network Connection program, but it displays the controls differently, and it 
provides a lot more information about the signals it exchanges with an access 
point. You don’t need any of that information to set up and use a Wi-Fi 
connection—the adapter and software automatically detect the channel 
number and the Wi-Fi mode that each access point uses—but it can be 

Managing Your Wi-Fi Connections
87
extremely useful when you (or your technical support) want to troubleshoot 
your system.
Figure 5-15 shows the PROSet/Wireless program’s main screen with a 
list of nearby access points detected by the computer’s Wi-Fi adapter. The list 
of nearby access points shows the signal strength and the Wi-Fi mode each 
access point is using and whether or not the signal is encrypted. To connect 
to a network, click the name, and click the Connect button under the list. 
Figure 5-15: The main screen of the Intel PROSet control program is 
similar to the Microsoft Program.
When you connect to a network, the PROSet/Wireless program will 
automatically create a new profile for this network and add it to your list of 
known wireless networks. The program treats the list of profiles just like the 
Windows program handles its list of Preferred Networks; it will automatically 
use a stored profile to set up a connection whenever it detects one of the 
networks on the Profile list.
So far, the Intel program looks like it works just like the Microsoft utility. 
But notice that this window has several buttons that aren’t on the Microsoft 
screen. The important ones are Properties, under the list of detected networks, 
and Details, near the top of the window (the Details button is only visible when 
a connection is active). 
The Properties screen, shown in Figure 5-16, provides information about 
the network and each of the network’s access points. If the host network uses 

88
Chapter 5
more than one access point, the Properties screen shows information about 
each of them. In this case, it tells us (among other things) that the Sample-
Network access point is using channel 1.
Figure 5-16: The Intel program’s Properties window provides 
information about the incoming signal from an access point.
The Details button opens the Connection Details window shown in 
Figure 5-17 when a Wi-Fi connection to a network is active. This window 
shows even more technical details about the adapter and the connection, 
including the channel, the radio frequency, the MAC addresses of both the 
adapter and the access point, and the amount of power the adapter’s radio 
transmitter is using (some of these details require scrolling down the list of 
details). You won’t use any of this information very often, but when there’s a 
problem with your connection, it can be very valuable.
Other Wi-Fi Adapters and Control Programs
If you’re using a different brand of mini-PCI adapter, a Wi-Fi adapter on a 
PC Card, or a USB adapter, the control software supplied with that adapter 
probably has a completely different layout and a different set of controls 
and data display from either the Microsoft or Intel programs. The programs 
supplied by many laptop computer makers are also quite different. Each of 
these programs accomplishes essentially the same thing as the Microsoft and 
Intel programs.

Managing Your Wi-Fi Connections
89
Figure 5-17: The Intel Connection Details window 
offers a more or less complete technical description 
of the active Wi-Fi connection.
As you saw in the last chapter, Lenovo ThinkPad laptop computers 
come with their own Wi-Fi program, shown here again in Figure 5-18. In 
this case, the program shows the relative signal strengths of several access 
points through a graphic display instead of the five bars. There’s another 
screen in the ThinkPad software (behind the Show Details option) that 
shows technical details.
Figure 5-18: The ThinkPad wireless control program shows the relative strength of 
each nearby access point’s signal.

90
Chapter 5
The layout may be quite different, but the commands and controls work 
in a similar manner to the two programs described in this chapter. If you can’t 
make sense of your own adapter’s control program, either consult the manual 
supplied with the adapter, or switch to the Windows Wireless Connections 
program.
Status Information
Each Wi-Fi control program provides a somewhat different set of information. 
Your status display may contain one or more of the following items.
Signal strength
Signal strength is the amount of power in the radio signal that the adapter 
received during the most recent scan. Most programs use the familiar 
five bars display to show signal strength, but some might offer the mea-
sured strength in dBm (decibels below 1 milliwatt). In practice, the signal 
strength value is most useful as a relative measurement to show how the 
signal changes in different locations. 
Mode
The mode is the Wi-Fi specification that the access point is using. It will be 
either 802.11b, 802.11a, 802.11g, or 802.11n. Some control programs 
show the mode simply as a, b, g, or n.
Channel
This field shows the radio channel number that the adapter is currently 
using. 
Signal quality 
Signal quality is the quality of the data packets the adapter received during 
the most recent scan. A 100 percent reading indicates that 100 percent 
of the received packets are good.
Overall quality 
Overall quality is a calculated value based on the signal strength and signal 
quality. It is usually expressed as excellent, good, fair, or poor.
Link speed or data rate 
The link speed is the nominal data transfer speed that the adapter and the 
associated access point are currently using.
Association 
This field confirms that the adapter has established an association with a 
wireless LAN. 
MAC
This field identifies the network adapter’s unique MAC (media access 
control) address. The MAC address is loaded by the manufacturer, and 
it’s usually printed on the outside of the adapter. If your laptop has an 
internal Wi-Fi adapter, the MAC address is probably also on a sticker 
located on the bottom of the computer.

Managing Your Wi-Fi Connections
91
SSID 
The SSID is the name of the network with which this device is currently 
associated. All nodes and access points in a wireless LAN must use the 
same SSID. 
Network type 
If the network uses one or more access points, the network type is 
infrastructure. If it’s a peer-to-peer network, the type is ad hoc.
Encryption
This field shows whether the adapter is currently using WEP or WPA 
encryption.
Activity
The activity display shows the number of outbound and inbound packets 
that the adapter has sent and received.
Changing Your Adapter’s Configuration Settings
In most cases, your Wi-Fi adapter’s default settings will do everything you 
need to connect your computer to a nearby network. But if you’re dealing 
with an unusual situation, it’s always possible to use the adapter’s configuration 
tool to make changes. Because the specific settings for each make and model 
of adapter are slightly different, the configuration program is supplied with 
the adapter. The configuration settings will remain the same even if you 
connect to a different network.
For example, Figure 5-19 shows the configuration tool for the Intel 
mini-PCI adapter supplied with a ThinkPad laptop. To change one of the 
adapter’s properties, scroll down the list of properties and highlight the item 
you want to change, then choose the new setting from the drop-down Value 
menu, which changes for each item in the list of Properties.
Figure 5-19: The Intel Properties window is a 
typical Wi-Fi configuration tool. 

92
Chapter 5
Configuring a Network Connection
The easiest way to configure a whole network full of adapters is to start by 
configuring the access point and then noting the wireless configuration 
settings that you must match in the individual adapters. If you expect your 
users to configure their own adapters, you will want to prepare a standard 
information sheet or card that lists these settings:
 The network’s name (the SSID)
 Network type (infrastructure or ad hoc)
 DHCP (automatic address assignment) on or off
 If DHCP is off, the IP address and subnet assigned to this user’s 
computer
 Type of encryption (none, WEP 40/64-bit or 128-bit, or WPA)
 WEP or WPA encryption key (or a telephone number of the help desk 
that can provide it)
 Preamble length 
 URL, login, and password for access to the network (if necessary)
No matter how clear you make the written instructions, some people will 
have trouble connecting to the network without help. So your instruction 
sheet should also include the name or telephone number of the people who 
can help set up an adapter and talk a confused user through the configuration 
process.
If most of your users have the same kind of adapter, you might want to 
include screen captures of that adapter’s configuration window and the 
Windows Network Settings window with step-by-step instructions for opening 
those windows.
The Mobile Life: Moving from One Network to Another
If you use your portable computer on more than one wireless network, you 
may want to prepare your own cheat sheet for configuring your network 
adapter to work with each network that you regularly use: home, office, 
coffee shop, airport, and so forth. Some configuration utilities offer multiple 
preset configuration profiles, but if yours does not, you will have to set all the 
options each time you move to a different network.
The Wireless Network Connection utility in Windows XP includes an 
Automatic Wireless Configuration feature that detects every wireless network 
within range and automatically configures your wireless adapter. This can 
save a lot of time and trouble, but if Windows doesn’t detect a network that 
ought to be there, it won’t hurt to use a sniffer tool such as NetStumbler 
(http://www.netstumbler.com) to perform your own search for nearby access 
points.

Managing Your Wi-Fi Connections
93
To use the automatic wireless configuration feature in Windows XP, 
follow these steps:
1.
Make the Windows Wireless Connections tool the active Wi-Fi control 
program.
2.
Open the Wireless Network Properties window by either clicking 
the network icon in the System Tray next to the clock or opening 
Start Settings Network Connections, right-clicking the icon for 
the wireless network connection, and selecting Properties from the 
drop-down menu.
3.
Select the Wireless Networks tab.
4.
Enable or disable automatic configuration by selecting the Use Windows 
to configure my wireless network settings option.
5.
Click the Advanced button to open the window shown in Figure 5-20, 
where you can set the type of networks that Windows will automatically 
detect. 
Figure 5-20: The Advanced window specifies the 
networks that Windows will automatically detect.

Beyond Windows
Every adapter manufacturer provides software for the most popular versions 
of Microsoft Windows, but that’s not the only operating system you can use 
with a wireless network adapter—if you can find the right drivers. Drivers for 
less common operating systems may be available from the adapter manu-
facturer’s technical support websites or from user groups devoted to the 
operating system in question.

Chapter 5
For Macintosh users, your best bet is to use Apple AirPort adapters and 
the software provided with them, which are fully compatible with other Wi-Fi 
networks. But some other adapters will also work with a Mac, if you have the 
right drivers. Chapter 8 explains how to use AirPort software with a Macintosh.
If you have some other make of PC Card or USB wireless adapter, don’t 
give up hope. Cisco and other manufacturers also offer Mac OS drivers and 
configuration software. Check the adapter maker’s website for the latest 
versions, or run a web search for Macintosh plus the make and model of your 
adapter. 
Drivers for some adapters are also available for Linux, FreeBSD, 
NetBSD, and other varieties of Unix, either directly from the manufacturer 
(for example, both Proxim Wireless and Cisco offer Linux drivers through 
their websites) or through user groups. Some recent releases of several 
flavors of Unix and Linux include drivers for several widely-used Wi-Fi chip 
sets. Chapter 7 contains more detailed information about using Linux and 
Unix on a Wi-Fi network.
Signal Strength vs. Signal Quality
Most wireless utilities show signal strength and quality in bar graphs, or as a 
percentage value, but they don’t tell you what a signal at 100 percent strength 
is 100 percent of. It’s important to understand that signal strength and signal 
quality are not the same thing; a wireless adapter does not have to receive a 
signal at full strength to move data at the maximum possible speed. As long 
as the receiver can capture a clean signal, the network’s performance should 
be acceptable. But even a strong signal can suffer if the receiver also picks up 
interference from other wireless networks or from other devices that use the 
same radio frequencies, such as wireless telephones and microwave ovens.
And even if the data transfer speed is slower than the maximum possible 
rate, it might not make any real difference. For example, if you’re using a Wi-Fi 
network to connect your computer to the Internet through a DSL line (at 
about 1.5Mbps or less), it won’t matter if your local wireless network speed 
drops from 11Mbps down to 2Mbps; that’s still a lot more bandwidth than you 
need because the slower DSL line is the slowest part of the overall connec-
tion. On the other hand, when you use the same networks for computer-to-
computer file transfers, a faster wireless link will make a noticeable difference.
The spread spectrum radio signal used in a Wi-Fi network is not the same 
as an FM radio signal, but the interference and signal quality problems are 
similar. If you live in or near a big city, you can probably receive a dozen or 
more FM radio stations on your kitchen radio. Some of these stations might 
have transmitters close to your house, and others transmit from the other 
side of town or even farther away. But as long as your radio can capture a 
station at a minimum useful level, the radio reproduces the music reasonably 
well; the signal from the little teakettle college radio station a mile away sounds 
just as good as the big commercial station with a much more powerful trans-
mitter up in the hills (this is a technical discussion—programming is a whole 
other question). On the other hand, if you’re out on the fringes of the 
station’s coverage area, or if there’s another nearby station using the same 

Managing Your Wi-Fi Connections
95
frequency, the sound of the station you want to hear might be noisy and 
hard to understand. In the same way, the overall quality of a wireless net-
work link is affected by both signal strength and the presence or absence of 
unwanted noise.
The technical definition of noise in an information channel is any unwanted 
energy or information. The only thing you want your network adapter to receive 
is the digital signal that came from the access point you want to use; so every-
thing else that shows up at the receiver is noise. This can include interference 
from other wireless data networks and other radios using the same frequencies 
(such as cordless telephones, microwave ovens, and medical electronics) and 
interference from natural sources such as lightning. Up to a point, the digital 
technology and spread spectrum radio system used in an 802.11b network 
can do a pretty good job of ignoring interference, but when the noise is just 
as strong as the signal you want, the network will apply its error correction 
features until it can confirm that an intelligible signal has made it from the 
transmitter to the receiver. 
A stream of noise or another pair of radios trying to use the same channel 
at the same time can reduce a link’s data transfer speed, but so can a weak 
signal. As the distance between the transmitter and the receiver increases, 
the amount of energy that the receiver detects will decrease until the signal is 
simply too weak for the receiver to decode the data. And if there are physical 
obstructions that absorb some of the radiated energy between the transmitter 
and the receiver, the useful signal range will be even shorter. That’s why Wi-Fi 
reception is better outdoors than indoors. 
It’s possible to use a high-gain antenna to increase the signal strength, 
and you can raise the antenna to the top of a tower or a tall building to 
increase the useful distance that it will travel, but at some point the signal 
strength will be too weak to be useful. That’s why most wireless network 
utility programs show separate readings for signal strength and signal quality. 
When a problem does occur, you can use the two measurements to help 
identify the source of the problem: If the signal is strong but the quality is 
low, the problem is probably caused by some kind of interference, but if both 
signal quality and signal strength are low, it’s likely that you’re too far away 
from the nearest access point or there’s some kind of obstruction between 
you and the access point.
Any time the network fails to transmit a data packet successfully, the 
device at the receiving end instructs the transmitting device to send the same 
packet again. This can happen when there is noise or interference on the 
link (radio or wired), when other users are trying to use the same channel at 
the same time, or when a radio signal is too weak for the receiver to decode the 
data contained in the packet. One or two repeated packets in a data stream 
won’t make any real difference, but when it becomes necessary to send almost 
every packet several times before the receiver accepts it, the actual data trans-
fer speed will be half or less of the nominal speed. A pair of Wi-Fi radios might 
try to compensate for a poor signal by dropping the transmission speed (this 
is the same kind of approach as speaking slowly and distinctly over a noisy 
telephone line), but the effect is often the same: It takes longer to receive 
the data.

96
Chapter 5
Slow data transfer is not always caused by the radio portion of the network; 
it can also happen when there’s heavy traffic on a server or some kind of noise 
on the wired portion of the network.
So several problems can all produce the same symptoms. When the data 
speed appears to slow down, the cause could be in: 
 The radio link or signal quality 
 The server
 Someplace else in the network—your local network’s access point might 
be connected to a noisy land line
To isolate the source of the problem, run your Wi-Fi status program or a 
signal monitor program like NetStumbler on the client computer. If the signal 
strength is low, try moving to a different location away from obstructions 
between your computer and the access point. If the signal strength is adequate 
but signal quality is poor, the network adapter is probably receiving noise 
along with the network data; look for a signal from an access point that uses a 
different channel number. If you can, move your network to other channel 
numbers as far away as possible from the other networks near you to find a 
segment of the spectrum that has fewer competing signals. And if both signal 
strength and signal quality are adequate but the data transfer speed is slow, 
the cause is probably in the server or someplace else in the network.

W I - F I  F O R  W I N D O W S
In an ideal world, it would be possible to 
plug a wireless network adapter into a com-
puter, fire it up, and connect to the network 
right away. No fuss, no bother (and no need for a 
book like this one). That’s the way Windows ought 
to work; when Windows identifies a network adapter 
during startup, it should automatically place a Network icon on the desktop 
and configure all of the settings your computer needs to make a connection.
But nothing is ever that simple. Before you can start to move data across 
a wireless network, you will probably have to tell Windows exactly how and 
where to find the network and how to connect to the Internet through the 
wireless LAN. This chapter explains the general principles involved in making 
Windows work with a wireless LAN and the specific procedures you will 
need to configure the networking tools and features in different versions 
of Windows. This is tedious, nitpicky stuff, but it will eliminate a lot of grief 
when your network connection doesn’t work properly.

98
Chapter 6
In Windows XP and Windows Vista, all of this configuration activity is 
supposed to happen automatically if your network adapter contains firmware 
compatible with Microsoft’s automatic configuration tool. Most of the latest 
Wi-Fi adapters come with drivers that work with the Windows XP tools, but 
you might have to download an updated version to use your adapter with 
Vista. If your computer does not automatically recognize an adapter, look for 
device driver software on the manufacturer’s website.
NOTE
Unfortunately, device drivers for Windows Vista are not available for many older Wi-Fi 
adapters, especially the ones that only use the 802.11b standard. The manufacturers 
might call these end of life or legacy products, but it comes down to the same thing: 
They have stopped supporting them. You’re out of luck if you want to use one of these 
adapters with Vista; your only option is to buy a new adapter. 
If you have experience setting up Windows networks, you shouldn’t have 
much trouble with wireless. As far as Windows is concerned, a wireless adapter 
is just one more type of network interface that exchanges data with applica-
tions and the operating system. Up through Windows 2000, the “wireless” 
stuff happens someplace else; in XP, there’s a separate tab for wireless-specific 
settings, as shown in Figure 6-1. Configuring Windows for wireless is a matter 
of making this particular computer aware that it’s connected to a network and 
setting the addresses of the network servers and services.
Figure 6-1: The Wireless Network Connection window 
includes a Wireless Networks tab.

Windows Network Configuration in General
Different versions of Windows use somewhat different configuration tools, 
but they all accomplish the same thing: The computer’s IP address, subnet 
mask, and gateway address settings must all match the values that the rest of 
the network requires. It’s entirely possible to set these values without under-
standing what they mean, but it’s always helpful to know something about 
how the network actually works.
The installation manual for the wireless access point on your LAN router 
should tell you which IP addresses or other settings to use when you’re config-
uring your network. If you can’t find the information in the printed material 
that came with your hardware, ask your network manager or Internet technical 
support center for help.
IP Addresses
The numeric Internet protocol (IP) address of a network client is the formal 
identity that the other computers in the same network use to reach that device. 
Every computer on a network must have a different address.  
The agencies that administer the Internet have established a complex 
numbering system with a unique address for every device connected to the 
Internet. Numeric IP addresses always appear as four groups of numbers 
between 0 and 255, so the total universe of IP addresses runs from 0.0.0.0 to 
255.255.255.255. These numbers are sometimes called octets because they 
use eight binary digits (binary 11111111 equals decimal 255).
A numeric IP address can identify a single computer, or it can be a gateway 
to a LAN (or a larger network) with two or more computers connected to it 
through a router. In some networks, all the computers (and other devices 
such as printers) on a LAN can share one public interface through a mech-
anism known as Network Address Translation (NAT).
Each local computer must also have a unique numeric IP address within 
the LAN (an internal address). In a network using NAT, the router or other 
gateway that connects the LAN to the Internet translates between internal and 
external IP addresses.
To prevent conflicts between local IP addresses and Internet addresses, 
several ranges of numbers have been reserved for use by local networks as 
internal IP addresses. These addresses will never be found on the Internet, 
and they can be used on multiple local networks at the same time (so long as 
the networks don’t have to talk to each other directly), but if you’re maintain-
ing several networks, it might help you keep your sanity to use different ranges, 
anyway. The private network address are:
10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

Chapter 6
Assigning Addresses
In some networks, a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server 
assigns a different IP address to every client device on the network. The 
server assigns an address to each client device whenever the client joins the 
network, so the same client might have a different local address from one 
session to another; that’s why it’s called dynamic host configuration.
The DHCP server is usually in the router that controls all the devices in 
the network. In a pure wireless network, that’s probably in an access point; in a 
mixed network that has both wireless and wired links, the DHCP server is likely 
to be in the Internet gateway. Figure 6-2 shows the server in a typical network.
Figure 6-2: A DHCP server provides local IP addresses to all 
the devices in a LAN.
When a DHCP server is active, all of the network client computers on the 
LAN should instruct Windows (and other network operating systems) to 
obtain an IP address automatically. If a network does not use a DHCP server, 
the network manager must assign a permanent address to each client. If your 
network manager assigns addresses manually, keep a copy of the address in a 
text file with a backup copy on paper. If you are the network manager, keep 
two or more copies of your own list of addresses as you assign them.
The manual for your access point should specify the correct range of 
addresses for client devices and explain how to assign them. If you use DHCP, 
the server will assign them automatically. If you don’t use DHCP, you must 
use a different address within the specified range for each device on your 
network (in other words, you must make sure that two or more devices don’t 
use the same IP address).
With most DHCP servers, it’s also possible to assign the same address 
to each client every time, which can be very helpful. How to configure this 
depends on your DHCP server, but it usually requires knowing either:
 The name of the client (sent by most operating systems in the DHCP 
request), which is an arbitrary human-readable name, usually the same 
as the system name Windows is configured to use for filesharing.
Internet
Access point
Gateway

…or here.
Printer

Wi-Fi for Windows
101
 The MAC address of the client, which is a 12-character address that is 
unique to every network card. The easiest way to get this address is to 
either look at the network device properties on the client system or at 
the connection logs on the access point or DHCP server.
The Subnet Mask
The subnet mask is a string of four numbers that specifies which parts of the IP 
address identify the network or the local subnetwork (the subnet) and which 
parts identify individual computers and other devices on the network. Each 
of the four numbers is usually either 255 or 0. For example, if the subnet 
mask is 255.255.255.0 (the most common value), then all the numeric IP 
addresses in the network must be XXX.XXX.XXX.ZZZ, where XXX.XXX.XXX 
is the same for all addresses, and ZZZ is different in each address. 
The subnet mask must be identical for all of the access points and wireless 
clients served by those access points. In small and medium-sized networks, 
the subnet mask is almost always 255.255.255.0. 
Gateways
The gateway is the wireless access point, router, or other device that acts as the 
interface between the computers on a LAN and other devices or networks 
that are not part of the local network. Any time a computer that is not part of 
the local network tries to communicate with a device on the network, it must 
move data through the gateway.
The gateway address (sometimes called the default gateway) is the numeric 
IP address of the gateway server. In a wireless network, the gateway address 
setting in each network client must be the same as the IP address used by 
the access point. If a wireless network has more than one access point, all the 
access points in the network must use the same gateway address.
If an access point doubles as a hub or router, the gateway address that 
the access point uses for wired and wireless clients is not the same as the 
gateway address that it uses to communicate with a LAN or Internet server. 
When you configure a network client, remember to use the access point’s 
LAN IP address as the default gateway, and not the address of the WAN 
gateway.
Domain Name Servers
A Domain Name Server is a computer that converts domain names such as 
nostarch.com or hard-cider.com to the numeric IP addresses of the computers or 
other devices that use those addresses. Some DHCP servers provide a DNS 
address automatically, but others require a manual entry. If you are not using 
DHCP, you must specify at least one DNS address.
Most networks and Internet service providers use two or more DNS 
servers, in order to provide an automatic backup when the primary server is 
offline. Your network manager or your Internet service provider should give 
you the addresses of your network’s DNS servers. As a last resort, if you can’t 

102
Chapter 6
find the addresses for your own network’s DNS servers, you can use one or 
more of the public DNS servers listed at http://www.tech-faq.com/public-dns-servers
.shtml or the OpenDNS Tier 2 servers listed at http://www.opennic.unrated
.net/public_servers.html. Choose the servers closest to your own location for 
the best performance. 
Some access points and network gateways also request a DNS address. 
The list in the access point or gateway should be identical to the list of DNS 
servers on each client.
File and Printer Sharing
When filesharing is active, other network users can read and write files 
to and from your computer. Printer sharing allows other users to send files 
and documents to a printer connected to the shared printer. In Microsoft 
networking, a folder that contains files that are available to other users is 
called a share.
The access level of a shared file or folder specifies whether other users 
can read a file but not change it, or if they have permission to add, remove, 
or change the contents of a file.
Network Interface Adapter Options
If you can’t find a setting or option in the configuration utility, look in the 
Properties window for your wireless adapter. The driver for each type of 
network interface adapter includes a set of options that control the specific 
features of that adapter, such as the name that the client will use on the 
network, the data transfer speed, the operating mode, and the power saving 
mode. Figure 6-3 shows a typical list of adapter properties.
To open the Properties window in Windows XP, go to the Windows 
Control Panel, select the System icon, choose the Hardware tab, and then 
click the Device Manager tab. In Windows Vista, open the Control Panel, 
choose System, and click Device Manager in the list of Tasks at the left side of 
the System window. Open the list of Network Adapters and double-click the 
entry for your wireless adapter. The list of options is under the Advanced tab.
Many of the same adapter options also appear in the configuration 
utility supplied with the adapter and in the Wireless Configuration Utility in 
Windows XP. When you change an option in one place, that change should 
also appear in the other location the next time you open it. 
Naming Your Computer
The network uses a numeric IP address to find and identify your computer, 
but the human users of the network will want a name that is easier to recognize 
and remember than one of those strings of numbers and dots. Most users 
won’t know or care that 192.168.0.34 is the computer in their office, and 
192.168.0.37 is the laptop in the kitchen. So you (or the network manager) 
must assign a name to each computer in the network. This name will appear 
in all of the directories and lists of computers that can be reached through 
your network, as shown in Figure 6-4. Each computer must have a unique 
name with a maximum length of 15 characters and spaces.

Wi-Fi for Windows
103
Figure 6-3: The Advanced network connection tab controls 
many configuration settings.
The Computer Description field is not required, but it can provide 
more detailed information to other users about a network client than the 
15-character Computer Name limit allows.
Figure 6-4: The name and description of each computer on the network appears in a 
network window.
Windows also provides a space to assign each computer on the network 
to a workgroup. In a small LAN, you will probably want to assign all of the 
computers to a single workgroup. Therefore, the workgroup name setting 
must be identical on every computer in the network. 

104
Chapter 6
There are at least two different ways to assign a name to your computer 
and join a workgroup. When you set up your network in Windows XP or Vista, 
the Network Setup Wizard includes screens where you can assign a name and 
description and identify the workgroup; unfortunately the workgroup name 
reverts to a default (such as MSHOME for home networks), so it’s essential 
to change it to your own workgroup’s name any time you run the wizard. 
After the network has been set up, you can change the name of a 
computer or assign it to a different workgroup in XP by opening Control 
Panel System Computer Name. In Vista, use Control Panel System and 
Maintenance System See the name of this computer Change Settings. 
In some wireless networks, the name of the workgroup must be the same 
as the SSID used by the access point, especially when the network config-
uration utility doesn’t display a list of nearby networks. If you’re having trouble 
connecting, try changing the workgroup name to the SSID of the network 
you want to join.
Configuring Windows
Microsoft includes specific support for wireless networking in Windows XP 
and Windows Vista that is supposed to integrate wireless configuration with 
other Windows configuration settings. In theory, this should make it easier 
to set up and use wireless networks, but it’s still not a simple plug-and-play 
process.
The goal is automatic wireless configuration: Windows should auto-
matically detect your wireless network adaptor and search for accessible 
wireless network signals. When it detects a nearby network, Windows should 
allow a user to join the network with just a few mouse clicks. And if you replace 
your adapters with a different brand, you won’t have to learn a new set of 
commands and controls.
That’s the goal, but there are still a few obscure configuration settings 
buried in the Device Manager rather than the wireless configuration tool, 
so it might be necessary to use the configuration tool supplied with your 
network adapter for the less obvious network configuration settings and 
options.
Do You Have the Latest Firmware?
Just about every manufacturer of network adapters offers the latest upgrades 
on its website as free downloads. While you’re at it, use the Windows Update 
link in Internet Explorer’s Tools menu to make sure you have the very latest 
version of Windows, including all the available updates, patches, and service 
packs.

Using the Windows Wireless Tools
Some vendors have integrated the Windows Wireless Properties controls 
with their own programs, and others have turned the whole process over to 
the Windows utility. For example, the Adapter Settings command in the Intel 
PROSet/Wireless control screen (shown in Figure 6-5) links to the Windows 
Network Connection Properties window (the one shown in Figure 6-3).
Figure 6-5: The Adapter Settings command in the Intel control window 
links to the Windows Wireless Network Properties window.
Other adapters allow you to choose between their own control programs 
and the Windows tools. In addition, some popular laptop computer makers 
include yet another Wi-Fi control program as part of their proprietary software 
packages. All of these programs probably do the same things, so the correct 
choice is the one you like best. Try each of them, and use the one that seems 
easiest to understand and use.
The following sections explain how to use the Windows wireless config-
uration tools.

Making a Connection
To connect your computer to a Wi-Fi network, double-click the network icon 
in the System Tray next to the clock. In some systems, like the one shown in 
Figure 6-6, you might see two or more separate wireless icons—one for 
each control program. In this example, the Microsoft icon is on the left, 
the Lenovo icon is in the middle, and the Intel logo is on the right.
Figure 6-6: Click a wireless network 
icon to set up a Wi-Fi connection.

The images in this section are all from Windows XP. The windows and dialog boxes in 
Windows Vista are similar but not identical.  
The Wireless Network Connection window shown in Figure 6-7 will open.
Figure 6-7: The Wireless Network Connection window lists all the Wi-Fi signals within

The Wireless Network Connection Status window shows the current state 
of your wireless link, including the connection status, the amount of time the 
current link has been active, the data transfer speed, the signal quality, and 
the number of bytes the adapter has sent and received since the adapter 
connected itself to the network. To view the Status window, right-click the 
wireless icon and choose Status from the pop-up menu. Figure 6-8 shows the 
status window.

In most cases, the Connection tool will automatically configure your 
computer to exchange data with the network. If it doesn’t, you might have 
to change one or more settings. If you’re trying to connect to your own net-
work, consult the manual that was supplied with your Wi-Fi access point. If 
you’re connecting to a public network, look for printed or online config-
uration or setup instructions supplied by the Wi-Fi service provider.
To change the most common network settings, click the Properties 
button at the bottom of the Wireless Network Connection Status window. 
To turn off the radio link, click the Disable button.

Selecting a Network
If your computer is within range of more than one network, you must choose 
the one you want to use. The Wireless Properties utility includes a list of 
Preferred Networks, but it doesn’t limit you to the networks on that list.
The list of networks in the Wireless Network Connection window shows 
the SSIDs of all the networks that will accept a link from your wireless adapter. 
If the adapter detects just one network, Windows will automatically try to 
connect to that network. When a network adapter detects more than one 
network, it compares the SSID of each network to the names in the Preferred 
Networks list and automatically connects you to the network with the highest 
priority. You can change the order in which Windows searches for networks 
by clicking Change the Order of Preferred Networks in the Connection 
window with the Move Up and Move Down buttons in the Properties Window.
If your adapter detects a network that’s not on your Preferred list, it will 
set up a connection if the nonpreferred option in the Advanced window is 
active. Click the Advanced button in the Properties window to open that 
window.
Of course, it’s possible that the computer will make the wrong choice; 
if it detects two or more networks, it might not automatically connect to the 
network you want. When that happens, select the name of the correct network

window to set the computer’s name and SSID.
in the Available Networks list and click the Configure button. This will open 
another window with more information about that network, and it will set up 
a connection with that network.
Connecting to an Encrypted Network
The listing for each Wi-Fi network in the Wireless Network Connection 
window will tell you whether that network uses encryption, and if so, which 
type of encryption it uses. The first time you try to connect to an encrypted 
network, Windows will ask for the network key for that network. After you 
have established a connection, Windows will store the key and try to use it 
whenever you connect to the same network.
Troubleshooting the Connection
Whether you’re using Windows XP or some earlier version of the operating 
system, it ought to be possible to set up a link to a wireless network. If the 
automatic connection function doesn’t work, don’t assume that you’ve done 
something wrong—more likely, you’re a victim of somebody’s bad design. 
Here are some things to check:
 Is the SSID used by your computer exactly the same as the SSID of the 
network you want to join?
 Is encryption turned on or off? If it’s on, are you using the correct encryp-
tion key? Is encryption set to 64-bit or 128-bit?

114
Chapter 6
 Does the access point use MAC address filtering? Is your wireless adapter 
on the list of qualified users?
 Does the workgroup name match the SSID?
 Does your access point use a DHCP server? If not, are the IP address, 
subnet mask, and default gateway settings correct?
 Is the preamble length setting correct? To change the preamble length, 
open the adapter’s Properties window (the one shown in Figure 6-12) 
and choose Preamble Mode or Preamble Length from the Properties 
menu.

Wi-Fi networking is not limited to com-
puters that use a Windows operating system. 
Computers running Linux, Unix, and 
Mac OS X can all support Wi-Fi, if you can find 
the driver software for your network adapter. A TCP/IP 
network doesn’t care what kind of operating system 
the computers connected to the network are using. It’s just receiving bits and 
bytes from a computer port and moving them around. All of the most popular 
versions and distributions of both Linux and Unix (including Mac OS X) 
include wireless networking configuration and control tools that perform the 
same functions as the Windows utilities described in Chapter 6. This chapter 
contains information about connecting your Unix- and Linux-based computer 
to a Wi-Fi network, and it describes some utilities and other tools that can 
make things easier. 

116
Chapter 7
If you’re not already using Unix or Linux, connecting to a wireless net-
work is not a good enough reason to start. There are some Linux and Unix 
tools for measuring the performance of a Wi-Fi network and for cracking 
wireless encryption that aren’t available for Windows, but unless you’re a 
network manager, you probably don’t have any real need for them. 
This chapter is written for Unix and Linux users who already have enough 
experience to set up and use one of those operating systems on a laptop or 
desktop computer. If you need more help using your Unix or Linux clients, 
you should ask for help from your neighborhood guru or find a more general 
how to use Linux or Unix book, such as Ubuntu for Non-Geeks, 2nd Edition by 
Rickford Grant (2007, No Starch Press) or Absolute FreeBSD, 2nd Edition by 
Michael W. Lucas (2008, No Starch Press).
Many Linux and Unix distributions for desktop and laptop computers 
(rather than servers), including Ubuntu, openSUSE, and PC-BSD (among 
others) include drivers and control software that support many common Wi-Fi 
adapters, so a computer running one of those distributions will probably 
detect and connect to a nearby wireless signal automatically. If you’re using 
one of those distributions with a supported adapter, you can just turn on the 
computer, plug in the adapter, and go. But if your distribution doesn’t include 
Wi-Fi drivers and utilities, or if you have a less common adapter, you’ll have 
to find the driver and control software separately. You can find pointers to 
many sources for those drivers later in this chapter.
If you’re not satisfied with the Wi-Fi control program supplied with your 
Linux or Unix distribution, or if your distribution doesn’t include a Wi-Fi 
program, you can choose from several other Wi-Fi control programs that 
perform the same actions as the built-in control programs but present them 
differently. There’s a list of these programs later in this chapter.
NOTE
If you’re operating a Unix or Linux network server, it’s better to locate the server in the 
same room and use Ethernet cables to connect the server to the network router, instead 
of wireless links. As a general rule, Wi-Fi is not the best way to connect a server to a 
LAN because the data transfer speed of a Wi-Fi link is almost always slower and more 
susceptible to interference than a wired connection.
Drivers, Back Seat and Otherwise
Before we go any deeper into connecting devices to wireless networks, let’s 
take some time to review exactly what a driver does and why drivers are impor-
tant. Later in this chapter, you can find advice about finding the right drivers 
for different kinds of wireless network adapters and how to use them to 
connect Unix and Linux computers to a wireless network. 
A device driver is the software interface between a computer’s operating 
system and the inputs and outputs of a peripheral device connected to the 
computer. The driver contains the instructions that translate incoming com-
mands and data from the device into a form that the operating system can 
understand, and it translates outbound instructions from the operating 
system into specific device controls. It handles memory management and 

Wi-Fi for Linux and Unix
117
timing, and it specifies the input/output (I/O) port and the interrupts 
that the device will use to communicate with the operating system. Figure 7-1 
shows the relationship between a computer and a very generic device driver.
Figure 7-1: A device driver is the data and control interface between a computer and a 
peripheral device.
Every peripheral device, including a wireless network adapter, requires a 
driver that converts standard instructions from the computer to controls that 
handle the specific features and functions of that device. Without the driver, 
the device won’t operate. A device without the right driver is useful only as a 
paperweight or a doorstop.
So, for example, the driver for a keyboard tells the computer which I/O 
port carries data to and from the keyboard, converts keystrokes into input 
data, and turns the Caps Lock, Num Lock, and Scroll Lock lights on or off. 
A printer driver includes the specific controls that make the difference 
between an impact printer and a laser printer. A driver for an input or output 
device will specify whether the device uses a serial or parallel port, a USB 
port, a PCMCIA socket, or one of the internal expansion slots on the com-
puter’s motherboard. And the driver for a wireless network adapter specifies 
things like the channel number that the radio will use to send and receive 
data, the amount of power the radio will transmit, and the data transmission 
speed that the adapter will use to transfer data.
The drivers for Wi-Fi adapters handle the physical layers of TCP/IP 
communication—just the information the adapters need to set up and use 
radio links to a network, while other layers handle data formatting and con-
tent. This assures that the adapter can handle many data formats and the 
data can pass through many different adapter types.
Drivers also make it possible for the same piece of hardware to work with 
different operating systems. A driver converts the input and output signals 
produced by the operating system to and from commands in the device’s 
“native language.” Drivers written for different operating systems that control 
the same device start with instructions in different forms, and convert those 
instructions into the same set of device controls. Therefore, your computer 
requires device drivers written specifically for that operating system. 
It might be useful to think of a driver as the instruction manual for a 
device. Manuals written in English, Dutch, and Malay all contain the same set 
of instructions, but they are provided in languages that different users will 
understand. Computer device drivers are similar, except the languages are 
operating systems instead of human speech.
The device driver is a separate program from the configuration utility, 
but many software designers combine the two in a single installation. The 
configuration utility provides a set of commands and displays that send and 
receive data in both directions through the driver to the network adapter.

Chapter 7
Where to Find Drivers
You need a driver for your computer’s operating system before you can use 
your wireless network adapter. If you’re lucky, or if you have done some careful 
shopping, the right driver is either on the CD supplied with the adapter, or it’s 
bundled with the operating system. For Linux and Unix systems, most drivers 
are already built into the core, or kernel, of the operating system.
Many wireless adapters are actually private-label products that were made 
by somebody whose name does not appear anywhere on the package or the 
device itself. So it’s often necessary to do some detective work to identify the 
right driver for a particular adapter. Proxim and Atheros are particularly 
active in the private-label adapter business. The adapter manufacturers might 
not want to tell you whose hardware is lurking inside their boxes, but the 
people who develop third-party Linux drivers have often figured out which 
brands work with which drivers.
The first place to look for a Linux or Unix adapter is in the operating 
system core itself. Generally speaking, the most stable and well-supported 
drivers will have been merged into the kernel development process. Most 
distributions will turn on all the stable drivers by default, but it might be 
necessary to recompile your kernel in some situations.
If you have a choice, it’s better to pick an adapter that is already supported 
by your operating system. Some manufacturers provide the necessary specifica-
tions to write complete drivers, or they have written and contributed drivers 
themselves. Other manufacturers offer no official support for Linux and BSD, 
but dedicated individuals have written drivers by painstakingly reverse engi-
neering the official drivers from other platforms. The final option for users 
trying to get an adapter functioning is to use a wrapper framework, which takes 
a Windows device driver and wraps it in code that makes it act like a driver 
for Linux or Unix.
Adapter manufacturers who have produced their own Linux and Unix 
drivers, or who have worked with the open source community to provide 
official specifications, have generally done a good job of supporting devices 
and making drivers available to users. Several major vendors, however, provide 
no such support or assistance. If you already have an adapter that will not 
support Linux or Unix, you will probably have to move from the relatively 
sane world of commercial software to the wide-open universe of user groups, 
email lists, and community websites. Communities of users are out there, 
made up of people who are anxious to improve the performance and compat-
ibility of their favorite operating systems. Within these communities, dozens 
of open source developers have created device drivers and wireless config-
uration utilities.
Linux Drivers
More than a hundred different brands of wireless network adapters carry Wi-Fi 
certification labels, but almost all of them use one of just a handful of internal 
chip sets. If you can’t find a Linux or Unix driver for a specific card, you can 
often use a generic driver for the adapter’s chip set.

Wi-Fi for Linux and Unix
119
As Linux becomes more popular, a growing number of companies will 
provide their own Linux drivers for their wireless network adapters. If you 
can’t find a Linux driver from your adapter maker, you can probably use one 
of the drivers supplied in Linux distribution packages, or you can download 
a separate driver from the chip set provider or a third-party developer. 
One very good place to find Linux drivers is the Linux Wireless LAN 
Support website at http://linux-wless.passys.nl. As Figure 7-2 shows, this site 
provides a search tool that you can use to identify the chip set in your adapter 
and find a direct link to a driver.
Figure 7-2: The Linux Wireless LAN Support website provides a wealth of useful 
information about Wi-Fi adapters and drivers.
To find a driver for your adapter, use one of the search menus on the 
first page of the Linux Wireless LAN Support site to open either a list of 
adapters made by each manufacturer or a list of interfaces sorted by the type 
of interface that the adapter uses to connect to your computer (most often 
either PCMCIA or USB). The listing for each make and model or each chip 
set includes a direct link to a driver for that device.
If you can’t find a driver for your adapter on one of those lists, your best 
bet is to ask for help. The Linux community is famous for assisting new 
users. Somebody who knows which driver will work with your Whoopie-Matic 
Lightning Bolt Wireless Adapter has probably posted pointers to exactly the 
information you need in a Linux newsgroup. The comp.os.linux.networking 
newsgroup is the best place to ask questions about finding drivers for wireless 
network adapters. Before posting your own questions, it’s always a good idea 

120
Chapter 7
to scan the newsgroup’s archives for previous answers that will solve your 
problem. Look in the comp.os.linux section of groups.google.com for a search-
able archive of old questions and answers.
If none of those sources can tell you where to find a Linux driver for a 
specific make and model of adapter, the next step is to identify the chip set 
inside the adapter and find a driver for that chip set. Some adapters come 
with data sheets or manuals that identify the chip set, but if yours does not, 
open a console and try one of these commands:
 If the adapter connects to the computer through a USB port, use lsusb.
 If the adapter is a 32-bit PC Card (a CardBus card), use lspci.
 If the adapter is an older 16-bit PC Card, use pccardctl ident.
 If the adapter is mounted inside a desktop computer on a PCI card, 
use lspci.
After you connect the adapter, look at the kernel messages via dmesg to 
see if additional information is available.
As a last resort, you can almost always identify the chip set by entering 
the FCC ID code from the adapter’s label into the Federal Communications 
Commission’s FCC Equipment Authorization System Generic Search form at 
https://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/GenericSearch.cfm. This web page provides 
links to a database with copies of the paperwork that the manufacturer filed 
with its application for type approval, usually including a technical description 
and one or more circuit diagrams. A few minutes reading those documents 
should tell you who made the adapter’s chip set, which should be enough 
to let you find the applicable driver at the Linux Wireless LAN Support 
website.
If you can’t find a driver for your adapter in the Linux Wireless LAN 
Support list or any other source, there are two other last resort alternatives 
that convert Windows drivers to Linux. The first is a free program called 
NDISwrapper that wraps Linux support around the manufacturer’s Windows 
driver. For more information and a free download, go to the project’s home 
page at http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net. The other option is a similar com-
mercial program, DriverLoader, created by Linuxant. For more information 
about DriverLoader and a free 30-day trial download, go to http://www.linuxant
.com/driverloader. 
NOTE
Before you spend a lot of time trying to find and install a compatible third-party driver 
for your old or obscure Wi-Fi adapter, consider replacing it with an inexpensive new 
adapter that works out of the box with your Linux version. You will probably see better 
performance and experience less aggravation than with your old adapter. 
Unix Drivers
Wi-Fi drivers and network software for Unix systems are less common than 
the ones for Linux, but there’s enough support out there to connect com-
puters running many major versions of Unix to a wireless network. The major 
BSD versions—FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD—all include integrated 

Wi-Fi for Linux and Unix
121
drivers for the most widely-used Wi-Fi chip sets. Solaris and other Unix versions 
don’t support as many chip sets as the BSD versions, but they do include a 
few drivers in their distribution packages or distribute them through their 
respective user communities. 
It’s even more important with Unix than with Linux to find a driver before 
you buy an adapter because drivers for some chip sets simply don’t exist for 
every version of Unix. Adapters that use the most common chip sets are often 
supported, but you might not have as much luck with a more obscure adapter.
Some Unix distributions (especially the ones that are targeted at desktops 
and laptops rather than servers, such as PC-BSD, found at http://www.pcbsd.org) 
include plug-and-play support for many common Wi-Fi adapters and chip 
sets. If your Unix distribution does not support your adapter, you will have 
to find and install a separate driver. To identify the right Unix driver, follow 
these steps:
1.
Use the lists at http://linux-wless.passys.nl to identify the chip set in your 
Wi-Fi adapter.
2.
Look in the list at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open_source
_wireless_drivers for links to the correct driver for your Unix version and 
chip set.
If you can’t find a driver for your adapter and version of Unix, try a 
web search for <name of Unix type> <name of chip set> driver, or ask in the users’ 
forum for your Unix version. For information about using Wi-Fi with Solaris, 
start at http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/laptop/wireless. 
Wi-Fi Control Programs
The Wi-Fi configuration and control programs supplied with Ubuntu, 
SUSE, PC-BSD, and other distributions are all you really need to set up your 
computer for a Wi-Fi connection. The adapter attached to your computer 
detects nearby wireless networks and either connects automatically or offers 
a list and allows you to choose the network you want to use. No muss and a 
minimum of fuss.
But some other distributions don’t include bundled Wi-Fi software, 
so you must find and install one of the add-on programs. Some of these are 
designed for the GNOME or KDE desktop, and others are more generic.
Using Built-in Software
The wireless networking software included with many Unix and Linux 
distributions is easy to use: If the system doesn’t automatically set up a link, 
just open the Network or Network Devices tool and select the Wireless option. 
For example, follow these steps to set up a wireless connection in Ubuntu 
Linux:
1.
If it’s not already turned on, turn on the Wi-Fi adapter or connect it to 
your computer.

Other distributions use slightly different programs, but they’re all very 
similar. Look in your desktop’s Network Settings or Control Center menu for a 
Wireless Networks section where you can turn the wireless adapter on or off, 
choose a network, and enter a WEP or WPA password.
Add-on Wi-Fi Programs
If your own distribution (of either Linux or Unix) doesn’t include a Wi-Fi 
control program, or if you want a different arrangement of features and con-
trols, you have several choices, as shown in Figures 7-5 through 7-10. Some of 
these programs are only available for Linux, but like the GNOME and KDE 
desktops that many of these programs use, many of them will work with Linux 
and several versions of Unix.
Figure 7-5: NetworkManager is the 
default Wi-Fi control program for sev-
eral distributions, including Ubuntu. 
A KDE version of the program—
KNetworkManager—is also available 
(http://gnome.org/projects/Network-

Looking Under the Hood
Many of these packages are based on the Wireless Extensions for Linux API 
that are included in most recent Linux releases, and the Wireless Tools 
programs that use the wireless extensions. The combined documentation for 
both Wireless Extensions and Wireless Tools is online at http://www.hpl
.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Linux.Wireless.Extensions.html.
As other wireless software for Linux appears, the Wireless Tools for Linux 
document (http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html) 
will probably be one of the best places to learn about it. 

126
Chapter 7
If a driver supports wireless extensions (and all Linux drivers do), the 
user can change the network configuration with any tool that provides an 
interface with the wireless extensions API, or the command-line tools iwconfig, 
iwlist, and iwpriv.
Wireless Tools
Wireless Tools is a set of programs that manipulate the wireless extensions. 
You can find instructions for downloading the most recent version from 
http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html. The Wireless 
Tools are command-line programs, but they also provide a foundation for 
other programs that add a graphical user interface (GUI) to their controls 
and statistics.
Wireless Tools contains a /proc entry and three programs: iwconfig, iwspy, 
and iwpriv.
/proc/net/wireless
The /proc entry is a listing in the /proc pseudo-filesystem that shows some 
statistical information about the wireless interface. /proc entries act as files, 
so the command cat /proc/net/wireless will display wireless statistics:
>cat /proc/net/wireless
Inter-|sta|  Quality       |Discarded packets
face  |tus|link level noise| nwid crypt  misc
 eth2:  f0   15.  24.   4     181     0     0
The status listing shows the current state of the network device. The 
Quality values show the signal quality of the link, the signal level at the 
receiver, and the amount of noise at the receiver when no signal is present. 
The Discarded packets values show the number of packets discarded due 
to an invalid network ID (nwid) because the adapter was not able to decrypt 
the contents of the packets. 
iwconfig
The iwconfig program controls the wireless adapter’s configuration options. 
In an 802.11b network, it includes these parameters:
channel
The channel number that the adapter will use.
nwid
The network identification. In an 802.11b network, the nwid is 
the same as the SSID.
name
The name of the type of wireless network or protocol in use on 
this network. This may be the type of adapter or a generic name such as 
802.11b.
enc
The encryption key currently in use. 
The command iwconfig, with no argument, produces a list of current 
iwconfig and /proc/net/wireless values.

Wi-Fi for Linux and Unix
127
iwspy
The iwspy program sets and displays the local computer’s IP address and the 
MAC address. 
iwpriv
The iwpriv program provides additional support for device-specific 
extensions.
Programs Based on the Wireless Tools
Obviously, the Wireless Tools programs are more of a framework for software 
developers than easy-to-use resources for end users. They do the actual work 
for the programs described in the next couple of sections, so it’s useful to 
know that they exist and what they do. In actual operation, programs like 
NetworkManager are a lot easier to use for everyone except the most hard-
core command-line geeks.
netcfg
netcfg is a network configuration tool for the GNOME environment. It allows a 
user to create and manage connection profiles and change network settings 
in real time. The netcfg home page is at http://netcfg.sourceforge.net. 
wavemon
wavemon uses ncurses to monitor and configure wireless adapter settings. 
It includes an Overview screen with all the important information from 
Wireless Tools in graphic form, a level alarm that triggers when signal strength 
drops below a preset level, and a full-screen history display that shows changes 
in signal level, noise level, and signal quality over time. There’s also a config-
uration tool that uses menus for easy set up.
For more information about wavemon and links to the most recent version 
of the program, see http://www.janmorgenstern.de/projects-software.html.
Status Display Programs
Several programs import the information from the /proc/net/wireless 
listings into graphic displays. The major difference among these programs 
appears to be the display format. 
WMWave
WMWave (Figure 7-11) is a dockapp that 
shows link quality, signal level, and noise 
level in a small onscreen window. It’s 
available at http://wmwave.sourceforge.net.
Figure 7-11: WMWave shows 
the characteristics of an active 
Wi-Fi connection.

GKrellMwireless
The Gkrellm monitor stack is a graphic display of system information that 
can use themes to match the appearance of many window managers. The 
Gkrellm plug-in adds information about wireless network connections to the 
monitor stack. For general information about GKrellMwireless, go to the main 
website at http://gkrellm.luon.net/index.phtml. For details about the wireless 
plug-in, go to http://gkrellm.luon.net/gkrellmwireless.phtml.
xwipower
The same icon also shows the current battery level. When the tiny battery 
in the icon is solid, the battery is fully charged or the computer is using 
external power. The battery icon appears as an outline when the battery level 
drops below 10 percent.
xwipower works in Linux, FreeBSD, and NetBSD. It’s available for 
download at http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/sysutils/xwipower.
Remote Monitoring
The /proc/net/wireless entry looks like a file, so it’s possible to retrieve 
status information about remote network clients through the network. 
Steven Hanley’s Signal Level Server and Clients programs present this 
information in a graphic display. For details and downloads, go to http://
svana.org/sjh/wireless.
Configuring an Access Point
Most configuration utilities for wireless access points use either a web-based 
interface, an internal command-line interface from a remote terminal, or 
both. So it should not make any difference what operating system you use on 
the host computer that connects to the access point. The access point’s com-
mands, controls, and status displays will be the same on any system.
The exception is the Apple AirPort Base Station access point, which 
presents a different set of problems. The internal software supplied with the 
AirPort Base Station assumes that you’re configuring it from a Macintosh 
using the AirPort Setup Assistant and the AirPort Utility. In practice, that’s 
usually a safe bet because just about everybody who uses an AirPort Base 
Station is also using at least one Macintosh computer.
The xwipower utility shows wireless signal 
strength in an onscreen icon and also 
includes a bar graph that tracks signal 
strength over time (Figure 7-12). The 
signal strength icon shows a set of bar 
graphs that correspond to the strength 
of the received signal. The icon displays 
a message in Japanese when the adapter 
fails to detect a signal (roughly translated, 
it means outside of signal area). 
Figure 7-12: xwipower shows 
the strength of a wireless signal 
as an onscreen icon.

Wi-Fi for Linux and Unix
129
There’s really not much reason to use anything but a Mac to configure 
your AirPort Base Station, but it can be done. To set up an AirPort Base 
Station from a Linux host, you need a Linux configuration program. At this 
time, only one program, the AirPort Base Station Configurator, appears to fit 
this description. Separate versions for the two versions of the AirPort Base 
Station (Snow and Graphite) are available from http://wireless.ictp.trieste.it/
school_2003/soft/java_configurator/APconfigurator.html.
Because it was written as a Java application, the AirPort Configurator 
program will run on any computer with Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 
in place. This includes Windows, Solaris, and Linux platforms. You can obtain 
a copy of JRE from http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp.
Wi-Fi for Unix
The number of wireless options for people who use various flavors of Unix is 
limited, but they do exist. 
Configuration Tools
Each BSD Unix version also includes configuration programs that control 
the settings and options of the adapters that use the an and wi drivers. 
Some of the commands have slightly different names, but the functions are 
essentially the same. Table 7-1 lists the configuration commands for different 
versions of BSD Unix.
As Wi-Fi networks become more common, more versions of Unix will 
support wireless services. As always, the official and unofficial mailing lists, 
newsgroups, and websites dedicated to each version will have the news of 
new drivers and network support as soon as they become available and people 
start discussing them.
wiconfig and wicontrol
The configuration programs for the wi driver can set all the network and 
adapter options. The syntax for the wiconfig and wicontrol commands are 
identical in all three Unix versions that contain them.

Chapter 7
The syntax for wiconfig and wicontrol in an 802.11 network is:
wicontrol OR wiconfig [interface] [-o] [-e 0|1] [-k key [-v 1|2|3|4]]
[-t tx rate] [-n network name] [-s station name] [-p port type]
[-m MAC address] [-d max datalength] [-r RTS threshold] 
[-f frequency] [-A 0|1] [-M 0|1] [-P 0|1] [-T 1|2|3|4]
The interface argument identifies the logical interface name of the 
network adapter. The names are typically wi0, wi1, and so forth. Assuming you 
have just one wireless adapter in the computer, it will show up as wi0.
To view the network adapter’s current settings, type the command (either 
wiconfig or wicontrol) and the interface name with no other flags. The WEP 
encryption key will only appear if you have root access to the system. 
 The –o option displays the statistics counters for this interface.
 The –e option enables or disables WEP encryption. Type –e 0 to turn off 
encryption or –e 1 to turn it on. The default is encryption disabled.
 The –k key [-v 1/2/3/4] option sets the WEP encryption keys. If the 
command omits the –v setting, the command will set the first key.
 The –T 1/2/3/4 option identifies the WEP key that the adapter will use to 
encrypt outbound packets.
 The –t tx rate option sets the transmission rate. The tx rate values are:
 The –n network name option sets the name (SSID) of the network that this 
client will join. The default setting is an empty string, which will instruct 
the client to associate with the first access point it finds. The –p option 
must be set to BSS mode for this option to work.
 The –s station name option sets the name that will identify this client on 
the network.
 The –p port type option identifies the operating mode that this network 
client will use. Use –p 1 for infrastructure mode or –p 2 for ad hoc 
operation.
 The –m MAC address option changes the MAC address of the network 
adapter. There is rarely a good reason to change the factory-assigned 
MAC address.

 The –d max_data_length option changes the maximum frame size in bytes. 
The default is 2304. 
 The –r RTS threshold option sets the RTS/CTS threshold in bytes. The 
default is 2347.
 The –f frequency option sets the adapter’s operating channel number. In 
infrastructure mode, most network adapters automatically scan through 
all available channels to search for an access point, so this option should 
be omitted unless you want to select a specific channel in an environment 
where more than one signal is present.
 The –M option enables or disables the option that reduces interference 
from microwave ovens. Use 0 to disable this option or 1 to enable it.
 The –P 0/1 option enables or disables power management.
This all looks a lot more complicated than it really is. In practice, if the 
kernel recognizes the card, and if the adapter settings match the settings for 
the access point and other adapters in the same network, you should be able to 
connect without any trouble. If the kernel doesn’t find the card, rebuild the 
kernel. 
When you set up a new connection, it’s easier to enter each option as a 
separate command than to try to run a whole string at one time. Here are the 
commands that you will use most often:
wiconfig –p 1
Set the network client to operate in infrastructure mode 
with one or more access points
wiconfig –s Sally's Laptop
Identify the network node as “Sally’s Laptop”
wiconfig –e 1
Turn on WEP encryption
wiconfig –k [WEP key]
Set the WEP encryption key
Along with the wireless settings, it’s also necessary to set the standard 
network configuration options that apply to any TCP/IP connection. The 
ifconfig command handles these settings in most Unix versions.
After you have configured your wireless network adapter and your 
network connection, they will operate just like any other network connection. 
You can run network utilities like ping, web browsers, email clients, and 
other applications, and you can connect to network resources just as you 
would over a wired connection.

W I - F I  F O R  M A C
Apple’s AirPort family of wireless network-
ing products is the logical choice for Mac-
intosh users who want to create a wireless 
network to connect their computers and for 
those who want to connect their Macs to an existing 
wireless network. Because Apple controls both ends 
of the network link—the access point and the network client—an AirPort 
network is a lot easier to set up than a generic Wi-Fi network. The AirPort 
Extreme (Apple’s name for its access point) automatically loads its Internet 
configuration settings from an existing Macintosh connection and transfers 
those settings to all the other computers on the same network. 
Apple is a member of the Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance 
(WECA), and both the AirPort Extreme and the AirPort Extreme Card carry 
Wi-Fi certification. Therefore, a Macintosh with an AirPort card can join 
any Wi-Fi network almost as easily as it can join an AirPort network. A 
mixed-platform wireless network that includes Macs, Windows-based PCs, 
and Unix or Linux machines can use one or more AirPort Extremes as 
access points.

134
Chapter 8
Apple uses different names for some of the features and functions in its 
wireless networks, but the general rules for designing, configuring, and 
using an AirPort network are the same as the rules for setting up generic 
wireless networks. The only difference between an AirPort network and any 
other Wi-Fi network is some of the terminology and the software that moves 
configuration data from a network client to the base station. 
This chapter explains how to set up and use a wireless AirPort network 
on Macintosh computers, how to add a Macintosh with an AirPort Extreme 
Card to an existing Wi-Fi network that does not use an AirPort Extreme 
access point, and how to add a computer running Windows to an AirPort 
network.
AirPort Components
The AirPort product family includes three components: wireless network 
adapters called the AirPort and the AirPort Extreme Card, and an access 
point called the AirPort Extreme. 
The AirPort Extreme Card is an internal Wi-Fi adapter that fits inside many 
Macintosh models. New MacBook and MacBook Pro laptop computers and 
many desktop Macs include a built-in AirPort Extreme Card as standard 
equipment; if your computer does not include one, you can either install 
it inside your computer or use a third-party USB Wi-Fi adapter with the 
OrangeWare driver described in “Using Non-Apple Adapters with a Mac” 
on page 138.
The AirPort Extreme is a stand-alone access point that manages the 
wireless network. The latest version includes an Ethernet WAN port, three 
10/100Base-T Ethernet ports, and a USB port along with the wireless access 
point. Figure 8-1 shows an AirPort Extreme Base Station.

with Macintosh computers.

As shown in Table 8-1, AirPort Extreme has a status light on the case that 
displays its current operating status.
Along with the AirPort hardware, Apple provides several software tools:
 The AirPort Setup Assistant is an automated configuration tool that 
automates the process of setting up most network installations.
 The AirPort Utility provides direct access to configuration options for 
setting and changing more complex network options. A separate ver-
sion of AirPort Utility is available for Windows.
 The AirPort Status Menu is a simple tool for monitoring and controlling 
network activity from the menu bar in the main Macintosh screen.
Setting Up an AirPort Network
Most AirPort users can use the AirPort Setup Assistant to create and config-
ure their networks without the need to worry about complex configuration 
options. But when local conditions require direct control of advanced settings, 
and when the network manager wants to monitor the network’s operation, the 
AirPort Utility offers more complete control of all network settings.
Using the Setup Assistant to create a network is fast and easy: Just config-
ure a client, click a few buttons, and let the software make all the decisions 
for you. The Setup Assistant automatically loads all the settings and fires up 
the network for you.
Installing the Hardware
Many recent Macintosh models come with built-in AirPort adapters and 
AirPort software bundled with the operating system. If you are using an older 
Macintosh that does not already have an AirPort adapter, you must install the 
AirPort Extreme Base Station before you try to run the AirPort Setup Assistant.
To install an AirPort Extreme, follow these steps:
1.
Place the AirPort Extreme Base Station in the location where you plan to 
operate it. Like any other wireless network access point, a single AirPort 
Extreme should be close to the center of the area you want to reach with 
your network. If you are installing more than one unit in order to cover a 
large area, spread them evenly through the entire space.

2.
Run a cable between the Base Station’s Internet WAN port and an existing 
wired Ethernet hub or a broadband Internet gateway router, such as a 
DSL modem or a cable modem. If you do not have access to a wired LAN 
or a broadband Internet service, or if you want to use a telephone line as 
backup to your broadband connection, run a USB cable from the Base 
Station’s USB port to a modem for the telephone line.
3.
If you want to connect one or more nearby computers or other network 
devices to the network through cables, run CAT5 or CAT5E cables from 
those devices to the Ethernet ports on the Base Station.
4.
Plug the power cable into the Base Station’s power outlet and an AC 
outlet.
The Base Station’s antennas are built into the enclosure, so it’s not 
possible to move them without moving the entire unit. After running the 
AirPort Setup Assistant, if you discover that the signal level is not adequate 
for reliable data exchange with all of your computers and other network 
clients, it might be necessary to move the Base Station to a different location 
for better signal coverage. H-Squared (http://www.h-sq.com) makes an optional 
Air Mount bracket that can hold the AirPort Extreme on a wall, ceiling, or 
other vertical or horizontal surface, but you’ll still have to allow for access to 
the power and Ethernet cables.
Running the AirPort Setup Assistant
Follow these steps to use the AirPort Setup Assistant with Mac OS X (version 
10.4 or later) or to configure your computer’s connection to a Base Station:
1.
Confirm that the AirPort Extreme is connected to either a telephone line, 
a broadband connection, or both, and that power is connected to the 
access point. The indicator light on the AirPort Extreme should light.
2.
Open the Utilities folder in the Applications folder. A list of nearby Wi-Fi 
networks like the one in Figure 8-2 will appear.
Figure 8-2: Use the AirPort Application to choose or configure a Base Station.

137
3.
Choose your AirPort Extreme access point from the list, and click 
Configure at the top of the window.
4.
Step through the onscreen instructions to configure the access point.
The AirPort Utility
The AirPort Utility (called the AirPort Admin Utility in OS X versions 10.4 
and earlier) is Apple’s tool for configuring a Base Station. Figure 8-3 shows 
the AirPort Utility window.
Figure 8-3: The AirPort Utility controls the local computer’s wireless network connection.
To set up a Base Station, choose that network from the list of Base Stations 
and click Continue.
The AirPort Status Icon
The AirPort Status icon appears at the top of the Macintosh screen whenever 
the AirPort Extreme Application is active. Click this icon to open a menu 
with commands to switch between networks, monitor the signal strength of 
the active network, and turn the wireless adapter on or off.
Using an AirPort Network
When the AirPort network is up and running, a Macintosh treats the com-
puters connected to the network through wireless links just like any other 
network resource. File transfers, Internet access, remote printers, and other 
services show up on directories the same way they would appear if they were 
connected through Ethernet cables.

138
Chapter 8
For most users, the only indication that a wireless connection is active 
will be the flashing lights in the menu bar at the top of their screens that 
light and go dark as the quality of the wireless signal changes due to inter-
ference and network activity. Unless a networked computer is on the edge 
of the Base Station’s coverage area or is receiving a lot of interference, the 
connections to the local network and the Internet should be just about as 
fast and clean as they would be through a wired network.
Connecting Macintosh Clients to Other Networks
Apple hopes that most Macintosh users will use their AirPort Cards to connect 
their computers through an AirPort Extreme to other Macs. But that’s not 
the only possible way to use a wireless network with a Macintosh. Because the 
Setup Assistant automates the process, it’s easier to connect Macs to an AirPort 
Extreme network than it is to build a mixed-platform wireless network that 
can use access points, network adapters, and configuration software from 
different sources. AirPort Extreme Cards do meet the Wi-Fi specification 
for interoperability, so they can also communicate with Wi-Fi access points 
made by many other manufacturers (and in ad hoc networks with other Wi-Fi 
adapters). Therefore, it is not a problem to use a Macintosh computer in a 
new or existing wireless network that also includes network clients that run 
Windows or other operating systems.
For example, PowerBook and MacBook owners who carry their computers 
to offices and public spaces served by Wi-Fi hot spots can connect to those 
networks just as easily as the owners of Windows-based laptop computers, 
and a wireless network in an office or household can provide service to both 
Macs and PCs without any changes to the network configuration.
Using Non-Apple Adapters with a Mac
Most Macintosh owners will probably want to use an AirPort Extreme Card 
rather than some other brand of network adapter because the AirPort software 
is so closely integrated with Mac OS networking functions, but it’s also possible 
to install a different brand of USB-based wireless network adapter if you 
can find driver and control software for the Mac OS version used by your 
computer. In many cases, the Wi-Fi adapters from other makers cost consid-
erably less than similar Apple products.
The Apple AirPort Extreme adapter uses a Broadcom bcm43xx chip set 
(for older models) or the Atheros chip set (for newer models on Intel-based 
Macs), so the driver and control software may work with other brands that 
contain the same chip set. You can use the search tool at http://linux-wless
.passys.nl to find specific makes and models. The same tool will tell you the 
chip set in most other adapter makes and models.
For adapters that use the Atheros chip set (including many adapters 
made by 3Com, D-Link, NETGEAR, Fujitsu, IBM, Linksys, NEC, Samsung, 
and Sony; see the list at http://www.orangeware.com/endusers/wirelessformac
.html), the OrangeWare Wireless Driver for Mac offers performance that 

Wi-Fi for Mac
139
OrangeWare claims is faster and more flexible than the Apple software. 
The OrangeWare driver is available for a free 10-minute trial at http://www
.orangeware.com/endusers/wirelessformac.html; if it works with your existing hard-
ware, the added cost is less than the cost of a new AirPort Extreme Card. 
For adapters using PRISM chip sets, look for a driver at http://wirelessdriver
.sourceforge.net. 
For adapters with Ralink chip sets, download drivers and support software 
from http://www.ralinktech.com/ralink/Home/Support/Macintosh.html.
If you’re using an older PowerBook with a PCMCIA socket or a desktop 
Mac with one or more PCI expansion slots, and (like me) you have one or 
more old Wi-Fi adapters that only recognize 802.11b networks, the driver 
software from IOXperts (http://www.ioxperts.com) can add support for many 
(now obsolete) Wi-Fi adapters. You could probably find a very inexpensive 
compatible adapter through eBay or a surplus dealer, but don’t waste your 
money; you’re better off spending a little more on a new adapter that also 
works with one of the other drivers in this section using the newer and faster 
802.11g and 802.11n standards.
Connecting an AirPort Card to a Non-AirPort Access Point
When a Macintosh with an AirPort Card is within range of a signal from a 
non-AirPort access point, the AirPort Card should detect the network signal 
and display the access point’s SSID in the AirPort application’s Choose 
Network menus and the AirPort Control Strip. When a user selects that net-
work from the menu, the AirPort Card should associate itself with that access 
point just as it would associate with an AirPort Extreme. The Control Strip 
and the AirPort application will show the quality of the signal from the access 
point in their graphic displays the same way they show a connection to an 
Apple Base Station.
In most large business networks and public wireless services, the network 
manager has probably prepared a “how to connect to our network” document 
for employees and visitors who want to use their portable computers and other 
devices on the wireless LAN. This document might be a printed information 
sheet or brochure or an online web page. Either way, it will include some 
specific settings that users must change in their configuration utility programs. 
The configuration program for an AirPort adapter is the AirPort Utility, but 
Apple has chosen to use different names for some of the settings, including 
Network Name for the SSID and AirPort ID for the network adapter’s MAC 
address. Fortunately, the AirPort utilities will detect the network name and 
ID automatically, so it’s not necessary to manually change them.
If the wireless network uses a DHCP server in the access point or some-
place else in the network to assign IP addresses to network clients, open the 
Internet tab of the AirPort Utility and set the Configure TCP/IP option to 
accept DHCP addresses. 
If the network does not use DHCP, the network manager will provide a 
list of configuration settings assigned to this client. To configure an AirPort 
client to connect to the network, set the Configure TCP/IP option to Manually 

140
Chapter 8
and enter these addresses in the Internet tab of the AirPort Utility. Copy the 
IP Address, Subnet Mask, DNS Servers, and Domain Name provided by the 
network manager directly to the fields in the Admin Utility. The setting that 
AirPort calls a Router Address is known to the rest of the world as the network 
gateway. Use the Gateway address supplied by the network manager in the 
AirPort Utility’s Router Address Field. 
Connecting Other Wi-Fi Clients to an AirPort Network
Just because a wireless LAN uses an AirPort Extreme as its access point does 
not mean that the network is limited to AirPort clients. Every client computer 
on an AirPort network does not have to be a Macintosh. There is absolutely 
no difference between an AirPort network and any other Wi-Fi network, so a 
computer that uses some other brand of network adapter and a different 
operating system will have no trouble detecting an AirPort network.
An AirPort Extreme appears to the network adapters in computers 
that use other operating systems as a standard Wi-Fi access point. The adapter 
will use the AirPort network to exchange data with other computers and as 
a gateway to the Internet. From the adapter’s point of view, connecting to an 
AirPort Extreme is just like connecting to any other brand of access point. 
Detecting the radio signal is one thing, but configuring a network client 
to use the network is a bit more difficult because Apple uses different names 
for some of the standard network configuration settings. If you don’t know 
how to translate between AirPort and Wi-Fi terminology, you may have trouble 
getting the network to work properly. Do not panic. We’re here to help. It’s 
not as bad as it seems when you have the translation keys that are revealed in 
the next few pages.
Network Properties
In Windows, the Network Properties window contains the settings and options 
that a computer must use to connect to a TCP/IP network. On a Macintosh, 
the same information is in the AirPort Utility.
If the AirPort Utility is set to use DHCP to configure TCP/IP, the 
configuration utility on the client must also be set to accept DHCP (in 
Windows, select the Obtain An IP Address Automatically and the Obtain 
DNS Server options). 
If the AirPort Utility is set to configure TCP/IP manually, the owner of a 
Windows client must enter these TCP/IP Properties settings:
IP Address
Use the IP address provided by the LAN manager or ISP.
Subnet Mask
Copy the address from the AirPort Utility’s Internet tab. If 
you don’t know the address, try 255.255.255.0.
DNS Servers
Copy the DNS server addresses from the Admin Utility’s 
Internet tab.
Host
Copy the Network Name from the Admin Utility’s AirPort tab.

Wi-Fi for Mac
141
Domain
Copy the Domain name (if any) from the Admin Utility’s 
Internet tab.
Gateway

Configuring an AirPort Extreme from Windows
Apple’s AirPort Extreme access point is more expensive than many other 
products that will do the same thing without the special Macintosh config-
uration program. So it’s likely that most people and most businesses that use 
an AirPort Extreme will have one or more Macintoshes in their networks. 
Therefore, the Macintosh Admin Utility is generally the best choice for setting 
up an AirPort Extreme network.
However, Apple also offers free software that you can use to set up and 
run an AirPort Extreme network from a computer running Windows. The 
AirPort Express Assistant, shown in Figure 8-4, is part of the free AirPort for 
Windows package, available for download from http://www.apple.com/support/
downloads/airport42forwindows.html. 
Figure 8-4: The AirPort Express Assistant for Windows provides a step-by-step process 
for setting up an AirPort Extreme network.
Is AirPort the Answer?
Because Apple could control both ends of its AirPort design—the access point 
and the network clients—it has come up with a system that automates the 
configuration hassles that confront many other Wi-Fi networks. And once you 
know the secret handshake (in the form of AirPort’s oddball names for some 
standard features and functions), your Windows and Linux/Unix computers 
with other manufacturers’ network adapters will also work perfectly well on 
an AirPort network.

142
Chapter 8
An AirPort network is indeed the obvious choice for a wireless network 
in a business or household where most of the computers are Macintoshes. 
For the rest of us, the AirPort Extreme is a completely adequate access point, 
but it’s considerably more expensive than many other brands, so some other 
type of access point can generally provide similar performance at lower cost.
Keep in mind that AirPort Extreme is not your only choice if your 
PowerBook or desktop Mac didn’t come with a built-in Wi-Fi adapter. Other 
makers’ PC Cards and USB Wi-Fi adapters, combined with third-party drivers 
and control software, will allow you to add your Macintosh to a Wi-Fi network 
just as well as the more expensive Apple products do.

W I - F I  A C C E S S  P O I N T S
Many Wi-Fi users never install or maintain 
an access point—they connect to public 
hot spots in coffee shops and libraries and 
maybe in the workplace, where there’s a network 
manager to worry about providing a signal to their 
computers. But if you want to use Wi-Fi in your own 
small business or home network, you’ll have to know 
something about access points.
An access point, or base station, in a wireless network is the central trans-
mitter and receiver that exchanges data by radio with individual computers 
and other network clients. Multiple access points can increase the size of the 
area served by the network and support a larger number of network clients, 
but every Wi-Fi network must include at least one access point. The number 
and location of your network’s access points defines its coverage and capacity.
When you decide to install a wireless network, you have at least two 
options: You can unpack all the boxes, hook up the radios to your computers, 
and try to make it all work, or you can do some advance planning and think 

144
Chapter 9
about the best locations for each component before you start playing with 
hardware. This chapter is for those conscientious and methodical people 
who plan first and install things later. It’s also for the rest of us who tried to 
fire up a network without any planning, and now we want to learn how to do 
the job properly.
The first thing to do when you start planning your wireless LAN—or for 
that matter, any LAN—is to spend some time thinking about exactly how you 
expect to use the network. Are all of the computers in your network in fixed 
locations with easy access to cable runs? Are you thinking about wireless 
because it’s the best way to add computers and users to your network or 
just because it’s the flavor of the month?
For example, I live in a one-story house with an unfinished basement. 
I could use wireless to extend my home network from the front room to the 
kitchen (and I did, when I was testing equipment for this book), but it’s almost 
as easy to use a gateway router and the built-in Ethernet interface adapters in 
my computers and string cable through the basement rafters instead. On the 
other hand, if I wanted to use my laptop computer on the front porch or 
the back yard as well as the kitchen, or if I lived in a two-story house or an 
apartment where I couldn’t get inside the ceilings or under the floors, then it 
could make sense to install an access point in the front room and a wireless 
network card in the laptop so I could carry it from place to place.
You can apply the same kind of analysis to a business network. As long as 
all the computers are stationary and you have an easy way to run cables (such 
as a false ceiling or cable conduits in the walls and floors), a wired network is 
usually the better choice. But if the salespeople all carry portables when they 
call on customers, or the engineers want to use their laptop machines in 
meetings or over lunch, or if there’s some other good reason to extend the 
network beyond the reach of cables, it’s probably time to add wireless 
access. 
In most cases, the wireless network should be a supplement to the wired 
connections rather than a completely wireless operation. At least one com-
puter should probably connect to the network through cables; a wired connec-
tion is often easier to use when you’re changing the access point’s wireless 
configuration settings.
Installing Access Points
As Chapter 3 explained, many access points are combined with other 
devices, such as network routers, broadband Internet routers, and traditional 
Ethernet hubs. At a bare minimum, every access point must include a radio 
transmitter and receiver, one or two captive antennas or connectors for 
external antennas, and (usually) an Ethernet port for connecting the access 
point to a wired network. The access point should also contain some kind of 
internal configuration software that displays the current settings and accepts 
commands to make changes.
Because each make and model of access point comes in a different 
package with different inputs, outputs, and controls, you will want to follow 
the specific installation and configuration instructions supplied with your 

Installing and Configuring Wi-Fi Access Points

device. Unfortunately, the manufacturers’ manuals don’t always give you all 
the information you need. This section offers a general procedure for install-
ing a generic access point, with occasional side comments about features and 
functions that don’t exist in every product. It is intended to supplement the 
installation procedure provided in your own access point’s manual.
Here are the general steps for installing an access point:
1.
If necessary, assemble the access point. The user’s manual for your access 
point should contain specific instructions for the make and model you 
are using.
2.
Based on the information in your site survey, place the access point in 
the location where you plan to operate it. 
3.
If the access point has a captive antenna on a swivel or other mechanism 
that allows you to move it around, adjust the antenna to a position as close 
to vertical as possible. If you are placing the antenna at or near the ceil-
ing, place the antenna so that it points straight down, if possible. If the 
antenna is closer to the floor, point it straight up. If you can’t adjust the 
antenna’s position, don’t worry about it; the access point should work 
almost as well in its fixed position.
4.
If the access point has a connector for an external antenna, install the 
antenna and run a cable from the antenna to the access point. Keep 
this cable as short as possible without stretching it or turning any sharp 
corners.
5.
Connect power to the access point. Most access points are supplied with 
“wall wart” DC power adapters, but some have AC power cords. Either 
way, connect the power cable to the access point first, then plug the 
cable or power supply into an AC outlet. Take a moment to label the 
power adapter or plug to indicate that it connects to the access point—
many times there is no branding to identify which device it goes to.
6.
An access point does not draw a lot of power, so it’s not necessary to use 
a dedicated AC power source, but if you use an uninterruptible power 
supply or a surge protector to protect your computers, you should also 
protect your access point. 
7.
If you are using a Power over Ethernet (PoE) system to provide power to 
the access point, follow the PoE instructions supplied with your access 
point to make the connection. Most PoE systems use the 802.3af power 
standard; however, there are other power standards as well. Make sure 
that the access point matches your power equipment.
8.
Connect an Ethernet cable between the LAN connector on your access 
point and the nearest network router, hub, switch, or other network point 
of presence. 
9.
Consult the manual to find out how to connect a control cable to the 
access point. Some access points use a serial cable from a nearby com-
puter, and others connect through the network. You will use this 
connection to set the access point’s configuration.

146
Chapter 9
10. If the access point uses a serial connection, it might be easier to take a 
laptop computer to a temporary location near the access point, where you 
can see the LED indicators light and go dark as you run the configura-
tion routine, rather than running a longer cable to an existing computer.
11. Turn on the access point’s power switch. You will probably see an LED 
indicator light. It could take a few minutes before the access point’s 
internal processor is ready to operate. The access point’s manual should 
explain the functions of the LED indicators.
After the physical installation is complete, the next step is to configure 
the access point. If you are using the same brand of access point and wireless 
interface adapters, the default settings are probably the same, so you might be 
able to install an adapter into a nearby computer and test the network right 
away.
Configuring the Access Point Through a Browser
Most access points accept configuration commands through a dedicated local 
numeric IP address. In other words, you can gain access to the configuration 
program by typing the access point’s numeric address into your web browser. 
You can find the access point’s default IP address in the manual supplied 
with the hardware or from the manufacturer’s technical support web pages. 
You can typically use Microsoft Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, or any 
other graphical web browser to view and change access point settings. Because 
of this, the configuration program will run through a computer running any 
operating system. Rarely, an access point might require a specific configura-
tion tool or a specific browser.
The first time you turn on the access point, it will use the default settings 
that were set at the factory. Unless you change some of these settings, it might 
be possible for unauthorized users to gain access to your network and for 
network users (authorized or not) to make changes that should be made 
only by the network manager. At an absolute minimum, you should change 
the configuration program’s password.
Once again, the specific configuration procedure is different for each 
type of access point, but the general principles are similar. Use this procedure 
as a supplement to the information in the access point manual:
1.
Confirm that the access point is connected to the LAN.
2.
From a computer connected to the LAN, open the web browser of your 
choice.
3.
In the browser’s Address field, type the default numeric IP address for 
the access point, as specified in the access point manual, and then 
press the ENTER key.
4.
If the software requires a password, the browser should find and open 
the access point’s password window. Type the login name and password.
5.
You should see the top-level configuration page. Figure 9-1 shows a typical 
configuration page, this one for the Actiontec combined Wi-Fi access 
point and DSL modem supplied by Qwest to its DSL subscribers.

Installing and Configuring Wi-Fi Access Points
147
Figure 9-1: The configuration menu screen for an Actiontec access point. Configuration 
screens for other access points display similar information, but they arrange it differently.
If you get an “unable to connect” message instead of a login window or a 
top-level menu when you try to open the configuration utility, send a ping 
request to the access point. In Windows, enter Start Run cmd to open a 
command window, and type ping IP address, using the access point’s numeric 
IP address. If the network recognizes the address, you should see a response 
like the one in Figure 9-2. If the program reports “host unreachable,” a conflict 
probably exists between the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 
server on your LAN and the default address for the access point. The next 
section explains how to deal with this problem.

of timed echoes from the target device.

Chapter 9
DHCP and Other Distractions
DHCP automatically assigns an IP address to each computer on a network. 
Because DHCP eliminates the need to manually assign a separate address to 
each computer, it can save a lot of time and trouble, but when the network 
hub or switch and the wireless access point both try to act as DHCP servers, 
or when a client device expects a specific address but the DHCP server assigns 
an address on the fly, trying to set up the network can become ugly.
Conflicting DHCP servers can cause problems when you add an access 
point to a LAN. Some standalone access points expect to receive requests for 
access to the web-based configuration screens at a specific numeric IP address. 
When that access point is connected to a hub that is acting as a DHCP server, 
however, the server assigns a different IP address to the access point. So when 
a user tries to connect to the IP address listed in the access point manual, 
nothing happens (or the browser reports “unable to find this address,” which 
is about the same thing).
It’s important to remember that a LAN can have only one DHCP server. 
If the LAN includes another DHCP server (usually in a router) that assigns 
numeric addresses, it’s best to disable the DHCP function in the access point 
and allow the main server to handle address assignments for the entire net-
work, including both wired and wireless nodes. As a general rule, the active 
DHCP server should be in the device closest to your Internet connection—
usually the DSL modem or cable modem or other Internet access device.
This is one case where a generic description of the problem is less useful 
than the specific procedure provided with your particular access point. The 
hardware manual should contain setup instructions that cover both the access 
point’s configuration utility and the Windows networking settings that apply 
to each client machine. Find the manual, and try to follow those instructions 
as closely as possible. When you do come up with a combination of access 
point configuration settings and Windows networking settings that actually 
works (and it’s a safe bet that such a combination does exist), note those 
settings on paper and store them with the manual. You will need them later 
to add more computers and access points to the same network.
DNS Addresses
The Internet uses Domain Name System (DNS) to convert between numeric 
IP addresses and plain-language addresses. If your computer can’t find an 
active DNS server, your web browser, email program, and other tools won’t 
work because they won’t know where to find other computers on the Internet. 
When DHCP is active, most access points provide DNS service to the com-
puters that receive IP addresses from the DHCP server. Therefore, you must 
specify one or more DNS server addresses when you configure an access point. 
You can obtain DNS addresses from your network manager or ISP or from a 
list of public name servers such as the ones at http://www.opennic.unrated
.net/public_servers.html (use the Tier 2 servers) or http://www.resolvingnameserver
.com/freerns.html. 

Installing and Configuring Wi-Fi Access Points
149
Configuration Commands and Settings
Each manufacturer’s configuration utility handles them differently, but every 
access point should include the same basic set of options. As you set up your 
wireless network, you might want to change some of these options from the 
default values.
Many web-based configuration utilities use tabs or menus to split the list 
of options into several screens. If the location of a particular command is not 
obvious from the layout of the top-level screen, either try opening lower-level 
screens until you find the one you want or look in the access point manual 
for specific navigation instructions. In general, the configuration utility should 
include the following options.
Passwords 
The setup program will also ask you for a password or passphrase. This is the 
code that your users will enter to connect to an encrypted access point.
Every access point’s configuration software requires a password before it 
will allow you to make changes. When you unpack and install an access point, 
it uses the manufacturer’s generic password. Because these passwords are well 
known to hackers and crackers who could change the password and lock you 
out of your own network, you must reset the password as soon as you install the 
network. 
NOTE
If you forget or lose an access point’s password, you can return it to the default password 
by using the physical Reset control on the access point. Consult your access point’s 
manual for specific information (if you don’t have the manual, look for a downloadable 
copy on the manufacturer’s website). If you reset the access point, you will have to recon-
figure all of its settings and options.
LAN IP Address
The LAN IP address field displays the numeric IP address currently used by 
the access point within the local network. This could be a default address 
assigned at the factory, an address automatically assigned by the LAN’s DHCP 
server, or an address assigned manually by the network manager. If your 
wireless network has two or more access points, each one should have a 
different IP address.
Subnet Mask
The Subnet Mask field identifies the subnetwork that includes the access point 
and the wireless clients that connect to the LAN through the access point. 
The address of the subnetwork is assigned by the network manager. If your 
LAN does not include a subnetwork, use the default value of 255.255.255.0.
Wireless Network ID (SSID)
The Service Set Identification (SSID) is the name of the wireless network that 
includes this access point. When a wireless client attempts to connect to a 
network, it searches for an access point with the same SSID as the one in its 

150
Chapter 9
own configuration settings. If it finds a signal with a different SSID, it rejects 
the association and continues to scan for the correct SSID.
Therefore, the SSID serves two purposes: It acts as the first line of defense 
against unauthorized access to a wireless network, and in an environment 
where more than one wireless LAN is operating, it associates each client with 
the correct network. However, the SSID by itself is not a particularly effective 
security tool because some network adapters will accept an SSID of ANY, which 
will allow the client to associate with the first access point it finds, regardless 
of the access point’s SSID. Also, every time a user connects to the access point, 
it transmits the SSID, even if the access point is configured to hide or cloak 
the SSID.
A network adapter will assume that all the access points with the same 
SSID are part of the same network. This can work in your favor when you set 
up a network with more than one access point (use the same SSID for all of 
them), but it also means that it’s essential to change the default SSID supplied 
with your access point to a unique name to make sure your users don’t connect 
to the wrong access point by mistake.
Channel
The Channel setting is the radio channel number that the access point will 
use to exchange data with the client devices in the wireless LAN. Each access 
point operates on a single channel, but most network adapters scan across all 
the channels to find the best available signal with the same SSID. You can 
assume that nearby client devices will find your access point, regardless of the 
channel setting, as long as both devices use the same operating mode. If one 
of your users tries to use a network adapter with a preset channel, however, 
the channel settings for the access point and the client must match.
In a noisy environment, some channels might perform better than others 
because other networks and other 2.4 GHz devices could generate inter-
ference on some frequencies but not on others. If other wireless networks are 
operating nearby, you can often reduce interference and improve perfor-
mance by using channel numbers that don’t overlap. If that’s not possible, 
use channels as far apart from one another as possible.
If your network includes more than one access point, you should set 
adjacent access points to different channels. To avoid overlap between 
signals, remember to use channels that are at least five channel numbers 
apart, such as channels 1, 6, and 11. 
Mode
Most new access points support several different Wi-Fi specifications (or 
modes), including 802.11b, 802.11g, and usually 802.11a. Access points 
made after the 802.11n standard is approved will also include that mode 
along with the others. When the access point detects a signal from a 
network adapter, it automatically uses the operating mode it’s receiving 
from the adapter. This multiple-mode operation allows computers with 
network adapters that only recognize one mode to connect without the 
need to change adapters.

Installing and Configuring Wi-Fi Access Points
151
The configuration program for your access point probably includes an 
option that specifies the operating modes that the access point can use. 
Unless you want to limit access to your network to a limited set of network 
adapters, it’s best to use the most flexible mode setting, one that recognizes 
all available operating modes.
Security
Wi-Fi networks can use either of two different encryption schemes to keep 
people who do not have the proper electronic key code out of the network: 
WEP (wired equivalent privacy) and WPA (Wi-Fi protected access). As 
Chapter 12 of this book explains, WEP encryption is not particularly effective 
against a determined eavesdropper, but it’s better than nothing. The more 
recent WPA method is more secure, but if some of your users have older Wi-Fi 
adapters that only accept WEP encryption, you might have to use the older 
system (or insist that your users replace their old Wi-Fi adapters with new 
ones that can use WPA). 
It’s generally easier to set up a wireless network with encryption disabled, 
but it’s a very good idea to turn it on when you start moving real data through 
the network. The encryption keys must be identical in each of your access 
points’ configuration utilities and in all the client devices that you expect to 
use with that network.
WEP Encryption
Every access point can use a 64-bit WEP encryption key to restrict unauth-
orized access, and some offer the choice of either a 64-bit key or a more secure 
128-bit key. Because the 64-bit key is actually a 40-bit key combined with a 
24-bit initialization vector string, some configuration programs call it 40-bit 
encryption. Similarly, 128-bit encryption is a 104-bit key combined with a 
24-bit initialization string, and it is sometimes called 104-bit encryption. Some 
access points might support proprietary WEP methods that use larger keys; 
they require all users of the network to have cards that support them. Access 
points and network adapters that use 40-bit WEP encryption are completely 
compatible with those that use 64-bit WEP encryption.
Unfortunately, some manufacturers request a string of letters and 
numbers as a WEP key, and others expect you to provide a series of hexa-
decimal numbers, either as five groups of two or as a single 10-digit string. 
Still others will ask you for a passphrase and automatically generate the hex 
key for you. 
WPA Encryption
Most new access points also support WPA encryption; if yours does not, 
check the manufacturer’s website for a firmware update. When you select 
WPA encryption for your access point, the setup program will offer a choice 
of either PSK (Pre-Shared Key) or RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In 
User Service) mode. Unless your network already has a RADIUS server, choose 
the PSK option. 

152
Chapter 9
Within PSK mode, you can select from two encryption methods: TKIP 
(Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) or AES (Advanced Encryption System). 
TKIP is the stronger of the two, so it’s usually the better choice. Because the 
network name (SSID) is used to generate the keys in PSK mode, it’s important 
to change your network SSID from the default because a combination of using 
dictionary words for the PSK passphrase and a common network SSID can 
provide determined attackers with an easy route into your network.
DHCP
As mentioned in “DHCP and Other Distractions” on page 148, an access point 
can act as a DHCP server that automatically assigns numeric IP addresses to 
the wireless clients in the network. 
Remember that only one DHCP server can be active at any time. So if 
the network already has an active DHCP, disable the access point’s DHCP 
function. If your network includes more than one access point, the DHCP 
server should be active in only one of them—and then only if no other server 
is already active.
When the access point’s DHCP server is active, the configuration utility 
might display a list of currently active DHCP clients on the same screen that 
contains the enable/disable options. Or the utility might offer to open another 
window or display another screen that contains the list of DHCP clients. 
Other Settings
In addition to the settings listed above, you might discover several other 
options in your access point’s configuration utility. Some could control other 
nonwireless functions built into the same device, and others might be settings 
that allow a user to specify some arbitrary values that would otherwise be 
changed in the client device.
The access point manual should give you the information you will need 
to set these options. When the purpose of a setting is not clear, or if it looks 
like it won’t have any effect on your network, the safest approach is to accept 
the default value. In other words, when in doubt, leave it alone! 
How Many Access Points?
Except for an ad hoc network, the simplest wireless networks operate with 
just one access point and a handful of network nodes. But when you’re trying 
to cover a large space, an irregular space with obstructions, or if you expect to 
have many wireless users, you will probably have to add at least one addi-
tional access point on a different channel. 
If the anticipated coverage area of your indoor network extends more 
than about 150 feet from the access point, consider a network with more than 
one access point. Outdoors you should be able to get a reliable signal from 
an access point at least 200 feet away if a clean line of sight is available.
As a practical limit, if more than about half a dozen computers are trying 
to connect to the same access point at the same time, the data transfer speed 
from each wireless node will start to drop. But remember that most of your 

Installing and Configuring Wi-Fi Access Points
153
users won’t be trying to move data or use the Internet at exactly the same 
moment, unless they’re streaming audio or video or moving large files around, 
so that “half a dozen” might translate to 20 or 30 users over the course of a day.
If the number of users on your network increases over time, you might 
discover that performance is becoming sluggish because your access points 
are operating at or near full capacity. When that happens, it’s time to consider 
adding more access points to your network. You can either place the new 
access points midway between the existing ones or use different channel 
numbers and place them right next to the existing access points. If you can, 
choose channel numbers that are not being used by other nearby networks.
Assuming your network operates in infrastructure mode, it resembles a 
hub and spokes design in which each computer or other device is communi-
cating with the network through an access point. Therefore, it’s not necessary 
for all the devices on your wireless network to use the same channel number. 
If you can distribute your network computers among two or three noninter-
fering channels, it will reduce the number of links on each channel, which 
will improve performance across the entire network.
There are several ways to connect multiple access points to the network. 
If it’s practical to string Ethernet data cables to each access point’s location, 
either connect all the access points to a router or use a combined router and 
access point for the first location and run data cables from there to the other 
locations.
On the other hand, if there are walls or other obstructions between 
access point locations, or if it’s difficult or impossible to run cables for some 
other reason, you can use a special type of access point called a range expander 
or range extender that uses radio signals to connect to the network’s primary 
access point.
NOTE
When you set up an outdoor network, don’t forget to consider the effect of foliage between 
the access point and the client computers—if you install the network during the winter 
when trees are bare, you might have poor reception during the summer when the same 
trees are in full leaf. Placing multiple access points is not an exact science. If your net-
work covers a large open space, you can place them at regular intervals. But finding 
the best way to cover an irregular space might be more difficult.
Perhaps the best method is to start with a single access point at the 
center of the building and confirm that it provides decent coverage within 
50 or 100 feet or up to the first major obstacle. You can confirm this by walk-
ing around with a computer running your Wi-Fi control program or a site 
survey program. When the signal starts to fade, move back to a place where 
the signal is good and measure the distance from the access point. Try to 
place the second access point about the same distance away from your current 
location, but in the opposite direction. If the second access point doesn’t 
give you the necessary coverage for the rest of your space, you might have 
to add still more access points. Your goal should be a maximum of about 
30 percent overlap in coverage between any pair of access points. 

154
Chapter 9
As a rule of thumb, your users should have no trouble using a signal that 
shows four or five bars in the control program. Three bars is probably okay 
for most users, but when the signal strength drops down to one or two bars, 
you should plan to add another access point.
Locating three or more access points can be more difficult. Remember, 
your goal in adding more access points is to fill in as much space as possible. 
With two access points in an open space, you would probably place both of 
them halfway between the side walls, each about a third of the way from the 
front and back. If you add another unit, you might want to put the third in 
the middle and move the other two closer to the front and back, or you can 
arrange them in some kind of triangular pattern. Figure 9-3 shows typical 
layouts with two access points and three access points.
Figure 9-3: For added coverage, use two or more access points.
Each access point in a network should operate on a different channel 
from the ones used by adjacent access points. If possible, use channel numbers 
that don’t interfere with one another, such as channels 1, 6, and 11. In a very 
large space, try to keep channel numbers widely separated by staggering the 
channel numbers over the entire area, like the arrangement in Figure 9-4.
Using Multiple Access Points
When two or more access points on the same network detect a signal from 
the same client device, the access point with the best signal handles the link. 
If the client device moves away from the currently active access point and 
closer to another one, or if the signal quality deteriorates because of inter-
ference from other radio signals, the original access point will hand off the 
link to the access point that is receiving the best signal from the client. This 
is the same kind of technology that permits cellular telephones to roam with-
out interrupting a conversation.

Figure 9-4: Keep overlapping access points separate from one

The early Wi-Fi specifications allowed network adapters and other client 
devices to move a connection to the network from one access point to another, 
but they did not explain how to hand off an association. In the absence of a 
standard, each access point manufacturer came up with its own method, which 
might not have been compatible with every other manufacturer’s system. 
This is less of a problem with 802.11g and 802.11n networks, but it’s still 
best to use just one type of access point in your network. You can expect a 
Wi-Fi–compliant network adapter to work with any brand of access point, 
but it’s not always safe to expect two different kinds of access points to work 
together.

WHICH OPERATING MODE?
The best access points for a new Wi-Fi network can use all available operating 
modes (802.11b, 802.11a, and 802.11g today, and 802.11n after that specifica-
tion becomes standard), so they can exchange data with users whose computers 
have any kind of network adapter. The drawback, however, is that when a user with 
an older card joins a network that supports a newer, faster standard (such as an 
802.11b user joining an 802.11g network), the network must switch all users to the 
slower standard for compatibility. If you expect all of your users to have newer cards, 
setting the mode to accept only the faster standards might offer better performance.

Chapter 9
Performing a Site Survey
Understanding general networking principles is fine, but you’re installing 
a wireless network in a real location with real walls and real furniture (and 
most likely, real sources of real interference). Radio waves pass through some 
materials and bounce off others, so the general estimates of a radio’s range 
and signal strength in an ideal environment are less important than the actual 
performance in the place you want to use it. You should therefore conduct a 
site survey that tells you how your own radios will operate in your own space.
The first step in a site survey is to identify the area that you want your 
network to cover. In most cases, that will be the entire area of your office, 
home, or campus, but there are other possibilities. For example, you might 
want to provide network access only in common areas, such as a conference 
room, a reception area, or a library. Or you might want to share a single broad-
band network connection among a group of neighbors. Keep in mind that 
radio signals at Wi-Fi frequencies can pass through many walls, ceilings, and 
floors, so they will probably reach adjacent spaces even if you don’t aim them 
at those spaces. 
For a straightforward home or small office network, your site survey can 
be very simple. If the whole building is just 50 feet from front to back and 
30 feet wide, you can probably place the access point almost anywhere. Just 
connect the access point to your existing Internet connection, fire up a laptop 
or other portable computer as a wireless network client, and carry the client 
device around while a network connection is active. If you can keep the con-
nection alive everywhere in the house or office, you’re ready to go.
The spaces covered by a single network don’t have to be continuous 
(or contiguous), although that’s the way most networks are constructed. 
For example, if your business occupies the third, fourth, and ninth floors of a 
building but none of the floors in between, you can place access points in 
your own offices, connect them together with Ethernet cables (or connect 
them to your existing wired LAN), and ignore the other floors. As long as all 
the access points use the same name (the SSID), your computer will use the 
same network profile to make the connection. If your LAN extends to more 
than one building, you can place access points in each building and link them 
together (if no link is already in place) with a leased line, a virtual private 
network (VPN) connection through the Internet, or a point-to-point radio 
link and a bridge router (described in the next chapter).
Make a Site Plan . . .
When you have a rough idea of the space you want your network to cover, 
it’s time to create a more detailed floor plan. If your network will cover 
more than one floor of a building, or when the network will include space 
in more than one building, you will want a plan for each floor, a vertical 
diagram of each building, and another diagram that shows the network’s 
entire coverage area.

Installing and Configuring Wi-Fi Access Points
157
Your floor plan should include the location of each wall and partition 
along with every existing network connection and AC power outlet. If you 
know about potential sources of interference, such as a 2.4 GHz cordless 
phone, a Bluetooth network, or a microwave oven, mark their locations on 
the plan as well. Figure 9-5 shows a floor plan of a small office.
Figure 9-5: An office floor plan
In general, you can get away with a single access point if you can find a 
spot with a clean line of sight to every location where somebody might want 
to place a computer or other network client. When that’s not possible because 
of obstructions to the radio signals, you will need additional access points. But 
don’t automatically assume that a clear radio path is the same as a line of sight. 
The only way to be sure is to fire up an access point and run your own test.
In this case, the best location for a line of sight to everywhere in the office 
would probably be at the angle of the L-shaped space. If that’s not good 
enough, the next approach to try would be placing one access point at each 
end. The office in Figure 9-5 contains plenty of network drops and AC 
outlets, so connecting to the wired network should not be a problem. That’s 
not always the case. In many places, the logical place for an access point might 
be inside a false ceiling, but if you can’t locate an AC outlet up there, you 
might have to find a different spot or use an access point that supports a power 
over Ethernet option.
It’s less of a problem when the preferred access point location is close to 
an AC outlet but farther away from a network connection point. You can often 
solve the problem with a longer data cable, but don’t drop a cable from a 
false ceiling into the middle of a room or over a partition that doesn’t reach 
the ceiling; it looks messy, and somebody will almost certainly yank it out 
eventually. Your installation will look a lot better if you extend the data cable 
to a real wall and either drop the cable inside the wall or run it flush to a 
Ethernet network outlets

corner of two walls. Remember to avoid sharply bending or crimping the net-
work cable; be sure to allow for a broad curve. When you want to use a single 
access point to serve two adjacent floors of a building, the best location would 
be as close to the shared ceiling and floor as possible. The location is less 
critical in most houses because the radio signal will pass through wood and 
plaster more easily than concrete and steel.
The antennas built into most access points and network interfaces are 
nondirectional or omnidirectional, which means that they radiate equally in 
all directions. In other words, the useful signal range resembles a sphere or a 
doughnut with the antenna at the center. Therefore, you will want to place 
your access point more or less in the middle of the space you want to cover. 
If you’re using an access point with a connector for an external antenna, you 
can be more flexible. In some environments, a directional antenna at one end 
of the building might be more effective than an omni in the center.
The built-in antennas on many access points are whips mounted on swivels 
that allow you to change their positions relative to the box that contains the 
circuitry. It might not make a lot of difference, but the usual practice is to aim 
the antennas down when the access point is placed near the ceiling and aim 
them up when they are close to the floor. In general, you might get slightly 
better coverage when the antenna is vertical rather than horizontal.
One potential cause of signal loss is multipath interference. Multipath loss 
occurs when the same signal reaches a receiving antenna directly from the 
transmitter and again a fraction of a second later after bouncing off a reflective 
surface. On a broadcast television signal, multipath appears on the screen as 
a ghost or shadow image. In a packet data network, the receiver treats multi-
path interference as noise, which can slow down the transmission speed. Many 
access points and network adapters use two separate antennas in a “diversity” 
receiving arrangement to reduce or eliminate the impact of multipath inter-
ference. The receiver compares the strength of the signal from each antenna 
and automatically selects the better one. Even though the two antennas might 
be located just an inch or two apart, a diversity system can often provide a 
cleaner output than a single antenna. If the access point’s built-in antenna 
is inside a package with an odd form, such as a U-shaped bar, or if it has 
two separate antennas, the device is probably using a diversity receiving 
system. The best way to find out if your hardware uses diversity is to read 
the specifications.
If your access point does have two captive antennas, you might want to 
experiment with different relative antenna positions. If your coverage is not 
adequate when the antennas are aligned north and south, try gradually rotat-
ing the access point to align the antennas to the east and west as you watch 
the signal strength display on a network client computer. If the antennas 
are on swivels, try moving them around rather than keeping them absolutely 
parallel.
Outdoors, the rule of thumb is that higher is better, within reasonable 
limits (for example, don’t put your antenna on top of a 100-foot tower). If 
you possibly can, use an access point with a connector for an external antenna 
so you can place the box under cover and run a coaxial cable to the antenna. 
A weatherproof vertical antenna on a roof or a flat-panel antenna mounted

high on the side of a building should provide decent line-of-sight coverage 
up to 300 feet away. When you place an antenna on a roof, try to mount it high 
enough to make it visible from the ground to prevent attenuation from the 
building itself, as shown in Figure 9-6. If you can’t see the access point’s 
antenna, the signal quality might suffer, but enough of the signal should 
pass through the structure to provide an acceptable signal. 
Figure 9-6: A rooftop antenna might not reach users who are close to the building.
When you mount an omnidirectional antenna outdoors, more gain does 
not always mean better coverage. As the gain of an omnidirectional antenna 
increases, the vertical range decreases; the sphere or doughnut shape of the 
antenna coverage becomes flatter. Mounting a high gain (greater than 8 dB) 
omnidirectional antenna high up might make it invisible to users above or 
below it, while a 5 dB or lower antenna might provide perfect coverage. Always 
make sure to install proper grounding and lightning protection on external 
installations; a lightning strike on or near your roof can easily travel through 
the antenna, access point and network cable, and damage your whole buid-
ing’s network.
The amount of signal attenuation caused by a structure will be different 
for different building materials. At 2.4 GHz, radio waves can pass through 
wood and glass more easily than through concrete or structural steel. As a 
practical matter, if you’re not trying to cover a large college campus or 
industrial park with your wireless network, you might produce an entirely 
usable outdoor signal from your indoor access points, especially if they’re 
located near the exterior wall. As you run your site survey, try carrying a 
portable device away from the building while a connection is active; you 
might be surprised to discover how far the signal carries. 
Remember that we’re talking about digital signals. When you achieve 
the minimum signal quality needed to provide a clean, high-speed data link, 
a stronger signal won’t make any difference unless you have a problem with 
interference. In other words, a three-bar signal is often all you need to make 
a connection, and a stronger signal won’t improve performance if you’re 
already seeing a five-bar signal. Don’t waste your time or money adding an 
outdoor access point if you can serve your outdoor picnic bench from an 

160
Chapter 9
existing indoor access point. The signal might be stronger from an outdoor 
access point, but it won’t transfer your data any faster.
Moving vehicles or other large metal objects (such as construction cranes) 
between the access point and a network client can get in the way of an other-
wise clean signal and produce temporary dropouts. If you’re trying to provide 
network coverage to a freight loading yard or some other space that has trucks 
or other large objects moving around in it, you will want to mount your 
antenna as high as possible or place a second access point on the other side 
of the area you want to reach with your network.
Testing, Testing . . . 
After all the theoretical planning, you can’t avoid real-world testing with actual 
hardware. A floor plan might give you a good idea of how your network should 
work, but the only way to find out how those radio waves actually move around 
the area you want to cover with your network is to set up a temporary install-
ation and perform some real-world tests.
There are two schools of thought about site surveys: One group believes 
that they’re the best and most efficient way to find the optimal locations for 
access points in your Wi-Fi network; the other says that adding access points 
is cheaper than hiring a consultant or buying expensive software, so you might 
as well just install more of them (access points, not consultants) until your 
network reaches the whole area you want to cover.
You have several options when you need to perform a site survey:
 Let somebody else do it for you—either a paid consultant or the vendor 
who expects to sell the network hardware to you
 Use site survey software
 Use the configuration program or the status program supplied with a 
network interface
The alternative to a formal site survey is old-fashioned trial and error: 
Install one or more access points and move them around until you achieve 
the best performance.
Allowing a consultant or sales tech to perform the survey for you has 
several advantages. First, you can let that person do the work, and you just 
have to read the report rather than having to run (or crawl) around the whole 
building with a test unit yourself. More importantly, the people who do this 
kind of site survey all the time have their own measurement devices that auto-
matically store individual readings and produce detailed reports. Unfor-
tunately, these measurement units are expensive, and they require some 
special training, so they’re not practical for a one-time user.
If you can’t find somebody else to do the job, you’ll have to do it yourself. 
Several hardware vendors, including Cisco, offer site survey software tools for 
their interface adapters and access points. If you’re installing a complex Wi-Fi 
network, take a look at the Site Survey software offered by Ekahau (http://www
.ekahau.com) and Covera (http://www.coverazone.com). These programs work 

Installing and Configuring Wi-Fi Access Points

with many (but not all) network adapters, and they offer long lists of useful 
features. Free evaluation versions of both programs are available, so you can 
try them before you buy. Several other free programs also provide site survey 
information.
If your test hardware doesn’t include one of those tools, you can pull 
enough information out of the standard status and configuration programs 
that come with every wireless interface to perform a site survey. It’s a little 
easier with the survey tool, but the configuration programs will tell you what 
you need to know.
Most likely, the first access point location you test will give you completely 
adequate network coverage, especially in a small office, house, or apartment. 
But when you’re setting up a more complex network, it can be very useful to 
convince your hardware supplier to let you test network interfaces and access 
points from more than one manufacturer. Because different manufacturers 
use different antenna designs and different configuration software, you might 
discover that one make of network adapters or access points works better than 
another in your network.
Here’s what you should do to complete a site survey:
1.
Choose a location for your access point. You might decide to change 
the location after the initial site survey is complete, but as a start, select 
a location with a line of sight to as much of your intended coverage 
area as possible.
2.
If you already have a wired LAN in place, connect your sample access 
point to the LAN and plug in the power supply. If your site does not have 
an existing LAN, just connect the power unit. Turn on the access point.
3.
Configure the access point: Assign an SSID and choose a channel number 
for each operating mode.
4.
If your laptop computer doesn’t have a built-in Wi-Fi adapter, plug one 
into the computer’s PC Card socket. For these tests, turn off WEP or 
WPA encryption.
5.
Using your floor plan as a guide, prepare a site survey form, like the one 
in Table 9-1. Make an entry in the Location column for every room within 
your coverage area; make two or three entries for different parts of large 
spaces.

6.
Take the portable computer to the first location on your survey form.
7.
Run the Wi-Fi connection program on your laptop computer. The 
program should report a signal association between the network node 
and the access point and show the signal strength (usually as zero to five 
bars). Check the signal strength for each operating mode (802.11b, 
802.11a, 802.11g) that your access point supports.
8.
Copy the signal strength for the current location to your survey form. 
9.
With the connection program running, carry the portable computer to 
the next location on your list. If necessary, use the Refresh command to 
obtain new readings. Note the signal strength in your survey form.
10. Repeat the process for each location on your list.
You might also want to wander around the building, noting changes in 
signal quality as you go. You can expect the signal strength to drop as you 
move farther away from the access point. 
If possible, test using several different brands of wireless card. Different 
wireless cards perform differently, so it’s important to test the signal quality 
with a range of client cards when you’re planning a network for users with 
mixed hardware.
Don’t be surprised if you discover one or more unexpected dead spots, 
where the signal strength drops below a usable level. This might occur because 
of some kind of obstruction (like a metal filing cabinet) between the access 
point and the portable unit or because some source of local interference 
(like a microwave oven, a Bluetooth device, or a cordless phone) is located 
nearby. Finding those dead spots is one of the reasons you’re doing the site 
survey. In some cases, moving the test unit just a foot or two away from the 
original location might be enough to solve the problem. Be sure to note any 
dead spots on the survey form. 
If you find a lot of dead spots as you move around the building, or if any 
of the dead spots are in critical places, try moving the access point. Keep in 
mind that some of your Wi-Fi users will probably be using pocket-size PDAs 
and Wi-Fi–equipped mobile telephones while they walk from one room 
to another, so you shouldn’t forget to test signal quality in hallways and 
bathrooms.
After you have tested the signal quality in every location on your list, mark 
the location of the access point on the floor plan and copy the test values for 
each room or other location. If you’re working in a relatively small space, you 
will probably see consistent numbers for most locations. In a larger area, the 
limits of the access point’s useable signals will probably fit within some kind 
of irregular curve. Don’t be surprised to discover that the signal strength 
decreases as you move farther away from the access point. 
If the signal quality is not acceptable over most of the area you want to 
cover, try moving the access point to a different location, or if the access point 
has an external antenna, try moving the antenna. Once again, look for a place 
with a clean, unobstructed line of sight to as much of the area as possible. 
Repeat the survey with the access point in the new location. 

Installing and Configuring Wi-Fi Access Points
163
If you can’t find a single location that covers the whole area you want to 
reach, place one or more additional access points at about two thirds of the 
distance to the place where the signal begins to fade, and connect each access 
point to your wired LAN. Use a different channel number for each access 
point.
Interference Problems
If nobody else is using a Wi-Fi network or any other 2.4 GHz device within 
about half a mile, you won’t have to worry about interference to your network, 
but that’s becoming less likely every day. Other network services, along 
with cordless phones, microwave ovens, outdoor lighting systems, and 
radio-controlled toys, all use the same set of frequencies. In addition, several 
nearby home or office networks are probably using their own Wi-Fi networks. 
It’s often a radio jungle out there.
The type of radio modulation used by wireless Ethernet networks is 
supposed to overcome interference from all those other services. That’s the 
theory. The engineers who work with the various 2.4 GHz radio services are 
trying to cooperate so we can all use our networks, phones, microwaves, and 
toys at the same time. In practice, however, the receivers in your access points 
and network adapters might listen to the channel that is supposed to contain 
a nice, clean Wi-Fi signal and perform the digital equivalent of throwing 
their hands into the air and shouting “Arrrgh!”
Or, more accurately, they do nothing: When that happens, the radio that 
transmitted the signal waits for an acknowledgment that never comes and 
then sends the same packet again and again until the receiver acknowledges 
that it has accepted a clean copy. This means that the channel not only has 
to be clear enough for the original packet to reach the client but clear enough 
for the acknowledgment to reach the original sender. The same thing happens 
with the next packet, and the one after that, and the one after that. This has 
the same effect as trying to conduct a voice conversation over a noisy phone

line or a walkie-talkie, where . . . you . . . have . . . to . . . speak . . . very . . . slowly 
. . . and . . . listen . . . very . . . carefully. In other words, your nice, speedy 
network will feel like it’s receiving data bits through a pipeline full of molasses.
If there’s a lot of radio interference around you, you will probably discover 
it during your site survey. When you can’t establish an 11Mbps link within a 
clean line of sight to the access point, look for another radio signal nearby. 
It might be something obvious like the microwave oven in the lunchroom 
or the cordless phone in the kitchen, but it could just as easily be something 
harder to find, like another network next door, or a point-to-point radio link 
that’s passing over your roof.
You can try a few things to reduce or eliminate interference: Either 
remove the source of interference or move your own network to a different 
channel. Changing channels is often easier, but it’s not always effective 
because your source of interference might be a frequency-hopping radio 
that jumps around the entire 2.4 GHz band, or a completely different 
source of interference might be operating on the new frequency.
It’s worth a try, however. To try to eliminate interference, follow these 
steps, in this order:
1.
Use the Network Connections tool to identify nearby Wi-Fi networks and 
the channels that each of them is using.
2.
Move to a different Wi-Fi channel as far away from the one where you 
encountered the problem as possible. For example, if you can’t use 
channel 6, try dropping down to channel 1 or jumping up to channel 11. 
If the neighboring networks are using more than one channel, look for a 
channel number that is not in use.
3.
Look for a cordless phone, a microwave oven, or some other device that 
radiates at 2.4 GHz. If possible, replace the offending device with one 
that operates at a different frequency, such as a 900 MHz cordless phone.
4.
If you can change the output power of the radios in your access points 
and interface adapters, make sure they’re set to the high (100 mw) setting. 
Most adapters use an option in the Network Connection Properties win-
dow to control power management.
5.
Try moving either your access point’s antenna or the antennas on the 
network interface connected to your computer. Sometimes changing 
the location by just a few inches can make a big difference in network 
performance.
6.
Ask your neighbors if they are using a wireless network. You can often 
identify the location of a home network by its name, such as Smith family. 
Because they’re likely to experience the same kind of interference from 
your network that you’re getting from theirs, they’ll probably agree to 
cooperate on a “channel assignment plan” in which each network uses a 
different channel. Remember, if you can keep the networks at least five 
channel numbers apart, you will keep cross-channel interference to a 
minimum. If you’re trying to coordinate more than three channels, spread 
the channel numbers across the band as widely and evenly as possible. 

Installing and Configuring Wi-Fi Access Points
165
Because the only set of three channels that don’t interfere are channels 
1, 6, and 11, and because one of those three channels is the default set-
ting on many access points, you might discover that they contain more 
interference from neighboring networks than one of the intermediate 
channels. You might have better luck with one or two of the intermedi-
ate channels instead.
7.
Try replacing the omnidirectional antennas on your access point, your 
network adapters, or both with directional antennas to increase the signal 
strength and the receivers’ sensitivity. You might have to move the access 
point to a different location or add more access points to cover the same 
area. If you can convince your neighbors to go to directional antennas, 
try to align the patterns for a minimum of overlapping coverage.
If none of these techniques solve your interference problem, you can’t do 
much more except to either accept sluggish performance or replace your 
2.4 GHz Wi-Fi network with an 802.11a wireless network that operates at 
5.2 GHz. 
You might encounter one more source of interference, especially in a 
business or institutional setting, but this one probably won’t show up until 
your network has been in operation for a while. As the wireless network 
becomes more popular among your users, more and more of them might 
try to use it at the same time, and the overall network performance will 
deteriorate. To solve this kind of problem, you can add more access points 
that operate on different channels.
Advantages of Mixed Networks
Just because you have decided to install and use a Wi-Fi network, you don’t 
have to use a wireless connection for every computer; it’s often better to 
connect some computers through Ethernet cables. All of the major access 
point manufacturers offer combination units that provide both a Wi-Fi 
access point and one or more wired Ethernet connection points in a single 
package. 
A wired LAN connection offers several advantages over a Wi-Fi link: 
 A cable connection can move data more quickly and with less hand-
shaking overhead.
 When you reduce the number of active Wi-Fi nodes in a network, you 
also reduce the potential for conflicts among active signals.
 Wired connections are more secure than Wi-Fi connections because it’s 
more difficult for an unauthorized user to intercept the signal.
 When you run the access point’s configuration and setup program, it’s 
often easier to establish the initial connection through a cable. Indeed, 
some routers and access points will only accept configuration com-
mands through a cable connection.

166
Chapter 9
When one or more desktop computers, printers, or servers on your LAN 
are in the same room as the network router, or if they are accessible through 
an easy cable run, plan to install a CAT5e or CAT6 Ethernet cable between 
the router or switch and each computer. Leave the Wi-Fi connections for 
laptops and other portables and for computers located in rooms that are 
farther away from the router (such as an upstairs bedroom). If your LAN needs 
more wired ports than the router/access point provides, look for a multiport 
Ethernet switch that supports at least 100Base-T (100Mbps) connections, 
and plug it into one of the Ethernet ports on the router. Consult the router’s 
manual for specific instructions on stacking or chaining switches.
If your network includes one or more fileservers, print servers, and other 
devices that are shared by the network’s users, it’s best to use cables rather 
than wireless links to connect those devices to the network to reduce the 
amount of wireless traffic. However, this might not be possible for devices 
such as webcams and other remote sensors that are not close to the router; 
it’s okay to use Wi-Fi to connect such devices to the network.
Access Points Combined with Hubs and Gateway Routers
Many manufacturers offer products that combine the functions of a wire-
less access point with a network hub, switch, or router. Other combination 
products include network print servers or broadband (cable or DSL) Internet 
modems along with access points. A combination unit can be an excellent 
starting point for a new small network or a good way to add both wired and 
wireless clients to an existing network. Because a combined device doesn’t 
require separate power supplies, cabinets, and interconnecting cables for 
each function, the cost is likely to be considerably less than the cost of separate 
components that perform the same jobs. And the convenience of reducing the 
number of cables tying everything together can be a huge advantage, especially 
for a small network that doesn’t run everything back to a wiring closet.
To decide whether one of these combination units is the best way to 
meet your particular requirements, identify those requirements first, and 
then look at various manufacturers’ product catalogs and websites to find a 
device that comes as close to your needs as possible. Among others, D-Link, 
Linksys, Netsys, Belkin, and Buffalo all offer a wide variety of access points 
combined with other functions.
Installing the access point portion of a combination unit is not much 
different from installing a standalone access point. Each device uses a proprie-
tary configuration utility that offers a place to set the access point’s operating 
channel, the SSID, and other settings, along with other configuration options 
that apply to the device’s added functions. Once again, the manual provided 
with each product and the maker’s website are the only place to find the 
specific information needed to complete the configuration and setup routines.
In most Wi-Fi networks, the access points are just about invisible in daily 
operation. They sit on a shelf, or they’re on the floor behind a desk, where 
they move data between client computers and the wired network. After you 
get the access point up and running, you can just about forget it until you need 
to change the configuration.

Installing and Configuring Wi-Fi Access Points
167
Extending the Network
The original idea behind the Wi-Fi specification was to provide wireless 
connections to LANs in limited areas such as businesses, homes, and public 
institutions. Wi-Fi was supposed to be a simple extension of traditional 
Ethernet to laptops and other computers that could not be conveniently 
connected through a cable. Other radio services would provide wireless 
access to the Internet from public spaces.
That was the plan. But Wi-Fi gear is inexpensive, it doesn’t require a 
license, and it’s relatively easy to set up and use. So an entire culture of 
“guerilla networkers” emerged to develop alternative uses for the technology 
that extend the reach of wireless networks beyond their own offices, class-
rooms, and homes. Hobbyists and community organizers have installed 
antennas on rooftops and hillsides where they can reach entire neighborhoods 
with public or private wireless access to the Internet and create point-to-point 
data links over distances of several miles. Many colleges and universities have 
added outdoor wireless access points to their campus-wide networks. And a 
handful of cities have started to build public Wi-Fi networks that might even-
tually cover their entire downtown areas.
These wide-area Wi-Fi networks have the potential to create some serious 
competition to the multibillion dollar 3G (third-generation cellular) wireless 
networks that were supposed to be the next wave of mobile connectivity. If 
these noncommercial networks that have been thrown together with duct 
tape and antennas in coffee cans ever come close to providing widespread 
reliable and cheap wireless network access at 6Mbps, the 3G cellular folks 
will have a lot of trouble convincing people to buy their expensive 384Kbps 
services. Therefore, the commercial cellular and wireless network operators 
are watching the community network movement very carefully. 
It’s relatively easy to install and use a Wi-Fi network to move data between 
buildings or to provide network access to your back yard, parking lot, or 
other open space. Outdoor antennas are widely available, or if you prefer, 
you can build your own.  
This chapter contains information about the legal and practical issues 
related to operating and using a wireless network outside your own property 
and technical information about outdoor access points and antennas. In 
Chapter 10, you can learn how to use Wi-Fi equipment to construct and use 
long range, point-to-point network links.
Legal Issues
Wi-Fi networks do not require licenses, but the FCC and other regulatory 
agencies have established some rules about the radio transmissions that 
make those networks possible. Most of these rules exist to minimize the 
likelihood of interference among wireless networks, cordless phones, and 
other services that share the same radio frequencies, so nobody has an 
unfair advantage over nearby users.

168
Chapter 9
When you’re trying to create a Wi-Fi network with the largest possible 
footprint, rather than just reaching all the computers in your own building, 
the strength of the radio signals from your access points and network adapters 
becomes a lot more important. There’s a direct relationship between the 
strength of your signal and the distance it can travel, so it’s essential to under-
stand just exactly what the regulations allow.
The specific rules that apply to unlicensed wireless devices appear in 
Part 15, Section 15.247 of the FCC’s regulations. Here’s what they say:
(b) The maximum peak output power of the intentional radiator 
shall not exceed the following:
(1) For frequency hopping systems operating in the 2400–2483.5 
MHz band [. . .] and all frequency hopping systems in the 
5725–5850 MHz band: 1 watt.
(3) For systems using digital modulation in the 902–928 MHz, 
2400–2483.5 MHz, and 5725–5850 MHz bands: 1 Watt. 
(4) Except as shown in paragraph (c) of this section, if transmitting 
antennas of directional gain greater than 6 dBi are used the peak 
output power from the intentional radiator shall be reduced below 
the stated values in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section as 
appropriate, by the amount in dB that the directional gain exceeds 
6 dBi.
(i) Systems operating in the 2400–2483.5 MHz band that are used 
exclusively for fixed, point-to-point operations may employ 
transmitting antennas with directional gain greater than 6 dBi 
provided the maximum peak output power of the intentional 
radiator is reduced by 1 dB for every 3 dB that the directional gain 
of the antenna exceeds 6 dBi.
Source: http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Engineering_Technology/
Documents/cfr/1998/47cfr15.pdf, section 15.247
What does that all mean? First, the rules allow the radio transmitters in 
access points and network adapters to have a maximum power of 1 watt. And 
second, the maximum amount of antenna gain is 6 dBi unless you reduce the 
transmitter power as you increase the gain. Highly directional point-to-point 
systems are permitted to use more antenna gain than point-to-multipoint 
systems. The maximum power to the antenna can’t be more than 1 watt, but 
you can use a directional antenna to increase the effective radiated power to 
4 watts. 
The rules in other countries might be somewhat different, so you should 
check with your own country’s regulators, especially about the channels 
and maximum power allowed, but the United States rules should provide 
some useful guidelines for calculating your equipment’s power output and 
antenna gain.
When you calculate the output power of a radio, you must also con-
sider the signal loss in the cable between the radio and the antenna. For 
example, the output of an access point might be 20 dBm (equal to less than 
half a watt), but a particular cable to the antenna might lose 6 dB at 2.4 GHz. 

Installing and Configuring Wi-Fi Access Points
169
Therefore, the antenna would only receive 14 dBm from the radio. That’s a 
lot less than a watt, so there’s room for some gain in the antenna.
The radios built into most Wi-Fi access points and adapters transmit at 
less than half of a watt, so they’re well within the legal limits unless you 
connect one to a huge antenna with a tremendous amount of gain. An RF 
amplifier between the radio and the antenna could boost power beyond the 
1 watt limit, but of course, that would violate the FCC’s regulations.
Two different types of Wi-Fi signal could benefit from more transmitter 
power: point-to-point signals, where the added power could increase the 
distance between the two sites; and point-to-multipoint, where increased 
power at the access point could expand the footprint within which client 
devices could successfully join the network. A point-to-point link typically 
uses high-gain directional antennas at both ends; in a point-to-multipoint 
system, the antenna at the access point usually covers a broad area, but the 
client adapters might use directional antennas.
If anything, the FCC’s power restrictions on radio transmitters in the 
2.4 GHz band are too conservative. It would be nice to be able to push, say, 
5 watts into a high-gain antenna to create a clean and reliable data link over a 
distance of 5 or 10 miles or more, or use a single access point to cover a larger 
area. But the telephone companies and communications common carriers 
who sell data services have enough influence with the regulators to keep the 
low power rules in place, and stronger signals would create a lot more inter-
ference. So the one-watt limit is probably here to stay.
As a responsible, law-abiding citizen, you should always take those 
federal regulations very seriously. And as a responsible, law-abiding author 
and publisher, we would never encourage you to do anything else. However, 
it’s extremely unlikely that a hypothetical individual or small business using 
a hypothetical high-gain antenna to boost the signal strength of their hypo-
thetical wireless LAN would ever attract any attention from the FCC or other 
law enforcement types, unless that hypothetical signal created significant 
interference to somebody else’s network or other radio service, or if it 
attracted attention from a local telephone company or a major Internet 
service provider. Operating your Wi-Fi network within the FCC’s power 
restrictions is the right thing to do, but that’s too bad, because it would not 
be difficult to boost the strength of your signal.
As a general rule, the FCC doesn’t care to spend its time and resources 
dealing with interference complaints on unlicensed frequencies like the 
2.4 GHz ISM band used by Wi-Fi networks. But the law is the law, so as a matter 
of principle, nobody with the good sense to buy and read this book would 
ever consider blatantly boosting the power from their access points and net-
work adapters or using very-high-gain antennas. Of course not.
Remember that the FCC’s rules only apply to the United States. The 
regulators in other countries have set their own limits, which are sometimes 
even lower than the American numbers. And their enforcement policies 
might be a lot more severe. So it’s important to consult technical and legal 
experts with experience in your own country before you try to install a 
high-gain antenna or an RF amplifier in your network.

Chapter 9
Outdoor Antennas and Access Points
Several factors contribute to the signal strength (and therefore the maximum 
distance) of a radio link between an access point and a network client in a 
Wi-Fi network:
 Antenna gain
 Transmitted power
 Antenna height
 Cable attenuation
Keep in mind that a Wi-Fi link moves data in both directions: from the 
access point to the network adapter, and from the adapter to the access 
point. So the antennas and radios in the link must be able to both transmit 
and receive radio signals. Fortunately, the gain and directional characteristics 
of an antenna are identical for both transmitting and receiving, so the same 
antenna that boosts the effective power of an outbound signal can also 
increase a receiver’s sensitivity to a weak incoming signal.
An outdoor antenna must also survive in the physical environment where 
it is operating. High winds can shift a directional antenna away from the 
direction it was originally aimed; accumulated ice and snow can block the 
signal and increase the amount of weight that the physical mounting hardware 
must support; and sunlight can cause a plastic enclosure to deteriorate. 
Therefore, many antennas are sealed inside radomes or other enclosures 
that offer additional protection. The maximum output power of a Wi-Fi 
transmitter is less than a watt, so just about any antenna durable enough for 
outdoor use should be hefty enough to handle the signal without any trouble.
Antennas for the 2.4 GHz band exist in many shapes and sizes. An 
omnidirectional antenna can be a single element just a few inches long, 
with or without an enclosure. The antennas built into PCMCIA adapters are 
even shorter. The most common directional antennas are yagis (smaller 
versions of rooftop TV antennas), patch antennas that resemble smoke 
detectors, parabolic reflectors that can be up to three feet high, and large 
panels with extremely wide aperture angles. 
Remember that a wireless data network uses digital radio signals, so 
there is absolutely no advantage to using higher power, or a fancy antenna, 
or placing your antenna on a rooftop, if you can send and receive adequate 
signals with smaller, cheaper equipment. If an antenna with a moderate 
amount of gain produces acceptable signals, your data won’t be any better 
or move any faster when you replace it with something bigger and more 
expensive. And smaller antennas are a lot less conspicuous, which can reduce 
the likelihood of complaints from neighbors and local zoning agencies.
Antenna Characteristics
Wireless network devices use the same antennas for both transmitting and 
receiving radio signals. An antenna handles a lot more energy when it’s 
transmitting than when it’s receiving, but the performance characteristics 
are identical. The same antenna that increases the effective radiated output 

Installing and Configuring Wi-Fi Access Points
171
power of a transmitted signal also boosts the sensitivity of a receiver by the 
same amount; an antenna connected to a Wi-Fi access point or network 
adapter will improve the strength of the radio signals moving in both direc-
tions across the radio link. The most important characteristics that define the 
performance of an antenna are aperture angle and gain.
The aperture angle of a directional antenna is the angle or arc within 
which the antenna radiates or detects energy at maximum power or sensitivity. 
If, for example, an antenna’s aperture angle is 20 degrees, the window of 
maximum signal strength extends 10 degrees to each side of the front of the 
antenna. The signal strength will drop when both antennas in a radio link 
are not within the aperture angle of the other. Figure 9-7 shows the effect of 
aiming a pair of directional antennas at each other.
Figure 9-7: Directional antennas can increase signal strength.
The specifications for a nondirectional antenna (also called an omni-
directional antenna) don’t include an aperture angle, but if they did, the 
aperture angle would be 360 degrees. Omnidirectional antennas might have 
a vertical aperture angle listed; as the gain of an omnidirectional antenna 
increases, the vertical range decreases. As the name suggests, the antennas in 
a point-to-point link should be aimed directly at each other, so their aperture 
angles can be extremely narrow.
An antenna’s gain is its effective output power or sensitivity relative to a 
standard dipole antenna. If you measured the strength of signals from two 
identical transmitters, or the same signal through two separate receivers, the 
signal that passes through an antenna with a gain of 3 dBi will be 3 dB stronger 
than a signal through a reference dipole antenna. The gain of an antenna 
increases with the size of the antenna and as the signal is focused within a 
narrow aperture. 
It’s useful to think about antenna angles and gain as similar to focused 
lights. A standard light bulb radiates the same amount of light energy in all 
directions (except back to the base of the bulb). But if you place a reflector 
behind one side of the light source, or if you focus the light in a particular

Chapter 9
direction, the apparent brightness of the light will increase within the target 
area, but it will look dimmer when you move away from the target area. The 
total amount of light radiated by the bulb is the same, but more of that light 
is concentrated in certain places. 
Radio antennas work the same way, more or less. A nondirectional 
antenna will radiate equal amounts of energy in all directions, while a 
directional antenna can concentrate more energy in some directions than 
in others.
Directional antennas with tight aperture angles are useful for point-to-
point links, but that’s not the only way to take advantage of a directional 
antenna in a wireless network. When you have a potential problem with 
interference from other radio signals, it’s often helpful to place a direc-
tional antenna with the source of interference off axis from the aperture 
angle so the receiving antenna is much less sensitive to the source of inter-
ference than to the signal you want. When you’re trying to provide network 
coverage to your own property while limiting the amount of spillover to your 
neighbors, you can place one or more directional antennas at the edge of 
the area you want to reach and aim the antennas inward.
An antenna with a greater surface area is more effective than a smaller 
antenna, but the exact size of the antenna is also extremely important. The 
ideal antenna for any radio frequency is cut to a length exactly equal to the 
wavelength of that frequency or some multiple or fraction of that wavelength. 
So it’s important to use an antenna specifically designed for operation at 
2.4 GHz (2,400 MHz) with your 802.11b network. An antenna of the correct 
size will receive Wi-Fi signals far more efficiently than an antenna with a 
random length.
Power
The maximum amount of power produced by a Wi-Fi radio transmitter is 
determined by the design of the radio; the people operating the network 
usually can’t adjust it, or if they can, it’s most often nothing more than a 
choice between high and low power. However, the output power of one of 
those radios is often considerably less than the legal maximum, so it’s often 
possible to increase the amount of power that reaches the antenna without 
breaking the law.
 You can’t boost the amount of power produced by the transmitter, so 
the only way to increase the power of the signal from a radio in an access 
point or a network adapter is to place a device called an RF amplifier (RF 
stands for radio frequency) between the radio and the antenna. You can think 
of an RF amplifier as a black box that takes a low-power radio signal at its 
input and provides a stronger signal with exactly the same content at the 
output. 
Some RF amplifiers are designed for use indoors next to the access 
point, router, or network adapter. Others can be mounted outdoors on the 
tower or mast next to the antenna. Indoor amplifiers are usually easier to 
install and maintain, and they’re a lot easier to connect to an AC power 
source, but they’re less efficient because a long feed cable to the antenna 

Installing and Configuring Wi-Fi Access Points
173
will absorb some of the RF power coming out of the amplifier. An amplifier in 
a weatherproof enclosure near the antenna will supply more power to the 
antenna, but it will be more difficult to reach when you have to repair or 
replace it. If you do use an outdoor amplifier, look for one that obtains DC 
power through the antenna feed cable. 
HyperLink Technologies and other manufacturers offer RF amplifiers for 
use at 2.4 GHz. Many of these devices amplify both inbound and outbound 
signals. This is a useful feature because it makes it possible to install an ampli-
fier on just one end of a link and still increase the signal strength in both 
directions. When you use a bidirectional amplifier, make sure that it is designed 
for use with the 802.11 standard you are actually using. Bidirectional amps 
must determine when a card is transmitting and change the amplifier mode 
accordingly, since an amplifier designed for 802.11b might not detect an 
802.11g card that is transmitting, and it could even damage the device.
Antenna Height
Radio signals at 2.4 GHz travel along a line-of-sight path, so you can increase 
the distance that a signal can travel by raising one or both antennas. That’s 
why it’s common practice to place radio antennas on rooftops, hilltops, and 
tall towers. To compensate for the curvature of the earth, the average height 
of the two antennas must increase as the signal path (the distance between 
antennas) gets longer.
Radio line of sight is actually broader than the visual path between the 
two antennas. Radio waves travel within a cigar-shaped region called the 
Fresnel zone (pronounced fru-NEL zone) that surrounds the direct path 
between the transmitting and receiving antennas. For the best possible 
transmission, the Fresnel zone must be free of hills, trees, buildings, and 
other obstructions.
The maximum distance that a wireless network signal can travel depends 
on the average height of the two antennas, with allowance for the curvature 
of the earth and the requirement for unobstructed Fresnel zone clearance. 
Table 9-2 lists one set of estimated minimum heights required for various 
distances at 2.4 GHz. Remember that these are estimates, so you might actually 
move your data over somewhat greater distances.

Chapter 9
Note that the height of the two antennas is the average height above 
average terrain: If one antenna is higher than the average height, the other 
antenna can be closer to the ground. For example, if one end of a five-mile 
link is on a hillside or on the roof of an eight-story building, the other end 
of the link could be close to ground level if there are no obstructions between 
the two locations. If one antenna is on a mountaintop, the maximum signal 
path might be several times greater.
When you’re trying to provide Wi-Fi network coverage to a large area, it’s 
more efficient to place the access point’s antenna as high as possible rather 
than trying to raise a lot of antennas connected to individual computers. On 
the other hand, if you’re trying to connect just one or two computers to a 
distant access point, it could be better to place the antennas connected to 
their network adapters on a rooftop.
For a really long Wi-Fi link, you will want to place both antennas as high 
as possible, but unless you’re trying to provide access to a remote mountaintop 
or something like that, there’s probably a better and more reliable way to 
create a broadband connection to the Internet or your own LAN.
Cable Attenuation
The cable that carries a radio signal from a radio transmitter to an antenna, 
or from the antenna to a receiver, is not a perfectly efficient transmission 
medium; every foot of cable absorbs a small but measurable amount of power. 
So the amount of power that reaches the antenna drops as the cable length 
increases.
The effect of cable attenuation on a short cable is usually insignificant, 
but it can make a huge difference over longer runs. If the antenna is high on 
a tower or rooftop, or if you’re trying to estimate the antenna gain necessary 
for a long point-to-point link, you must allow for cable loss when you calculate 
the strength of the signal reaching the antenna. The amount of loss in a 
particular type of cable depends on the diameter of the cable and the mate-
rials used to produce the cable. The specifications for each type of cable will 
include the amount of attenuation, often expressed in dB per 100 feet at 
different operating frequencies. 
If the cable loss is rated at 6.80 dB at 2,500 MHz, you can estimate that a 
20-foot cable at 2.4 GHz (2,400 MHz) will lose about 1.3 dB (20 ft = 100 ft × 0.2; 
0.2 × 6.80 dB = ~1.3 dB). If the output power from an access point or network 
adapter is 20 dBm (100 milliwatts), the antenna will only receive 18.7 dBm 
(74.1 milliwatts) through that cable. So when you push that signal through 
an antenna with a gain of 6 dBi, the effective radiated power would be about 
24.7 dB (20 − 1.3 + 6 = 24.7), or about 295 milliwatts.
Every foot of feed cable increases the amount of cable loss, so you should 
place your access points and network adapters as close to the antenna as 
possible. If the antenna is mounted on a roof or the wall of a building, try to 
place the radio in a nearby equipment closet or other space where you have 
access to AC power and your Ethernet cables. It’s a lot more efficient to run a 
longer Ethernet cable to the access point and a shorter antenna feed cable.

Installing and Configuring Wi-Fi Access Points
175
When you install an antenna feed cable, it’s good practice to allow a 
little slack at each end to make it easier to connect and disconnect the cable 
from the antenna and the radio. But don’t leave a lot of excess cable coiled 
up on the floor just because the premade cable is longer than you need. All 
that cable wastes signal with no compensating benefit.
Each coupler or connector in the cable run is also a point of loss; a typical 
guideline is 0.3 dB of loss per connector, so a short pigtail connector from a 
wireless card to a standard antenna connector would include two connectors, 
then both ends of the long cable run would have two more, and the connector 
on the antenna itself would be a fifth point of loss. Therefore, in addition to 
the loss of the cabling itself, you will have an additional 1.5 dB of loss due to 
connectors. Whenever possible, keep the number of connectors in your 
antenna cable to a minimum.
Campus Networks
A campus network usually provides wireless access to the Internet, and 
sometimes to a LAN, for users in two or more buildings, and to the outdoor 
spaces that surround those buildings. A campus network can exist on a 
college or university campus, but the same kind of planning and design can 
also apply to other locations. For example, a campus network might also 
operate in an office park or an industrial park, in a public space such as a 
green park or a shopping and entertainment center, or even a farm or a 
marina. Several cities have installed campuslike networks to provide public 
Internet access throughout their central business districts. Another form of 
temporary campuslike network might exist at a special event such as a music 
festival, a Boy or Girl Scout jamboree, or a gathering of old-car enthusiasts. 
They’re also common at flea markets and swap meets where many people 
want to use the Internet to consult specialty websites before they decide to buy.
The simplest campus networks occur by accident: The radio signals from 
the access points that provide network service to the interior of a building 
don’t stop at the building’s walls, so a user in the parking lot or the back yard 
can also establish wireless access to the network. A larger and more complex 
campus network might have additional access points in locations specifically 
chosen to reach network clients on the college lawn or the coffee shop across 
the street.
A campus network might be a complement to a set of wireless links that 
connect two or more buildings to the same network, but it’s not the same 
thing; a campus network should provide broad coverage to a lot of outdoor 
space, while a point-to-point link simply extends a single LAN to spaces inside 
several buildings. 
Setting Up a Campus Network
In general, the same rules apply to a campus network that you would use in 
designing a Wi-Fi network that serves a single building. Choose locations for 
your access points that will provide signals to as much of the area as possible, 
and allow for some overlap from one footprint to each adjacent footprint. 
Each pair of overlapping coverage areas should use a different radio channel.

176
Chapter 9
When you’re setting up an outdoor network to provide Wi-Fi access to 
the Internet, remember to place your Internet modem and first access point 
close to a source of electric power and within a short cable run to a telephone 
line or other Internet point of presence. If possible, place the antenna 
within a clean line of sight to campsites, picnic tables, and backstage areas 
(as appropriate) where your users will want to use their laptop computers.
In almost every case, the access points that serve an outdoor network 
should connect to external antennas rather than the captive antennas built 
into many access points designed for indoor use. Choose the antenna with 
the best characteristics for your particular needs, and use a waterproof cable 
to connect it to an access point located out of the weather. 
Connecting the Access Points to a LAN and the Internet
If your access points are all located in buildings that already have network 
service, you can treat the access points with outdoor antennas as a simple 
extension of the existing network. But if you don’t already have a network 
connection at your access point, you’ll have to create one.
To connect your campus network to a LAN or the Internet, you must 
provide a point of network presence for every access point. The connection 
can be through an Ethernet cable, a data circuit leased from the telephone 
company, or a point-to-point radio link. 
Every access point requires a source of electric power, but it’s not always 
necessary to run a long extension cord from the nearest AC outlet. Many 
access point manufacturers offer a power over Ethernet option that carries 
power for the access points through the same cable that carries the Ethernet 
data. And don’t forget solar power as a possible alternative.
Ethernet cables are easy to connect to an access point, but they’re not 
the best choice for links between buildings except in very specific situations. 
First, you must have a secure path for the cable to follow; you can’t just string 
the cable through the trees or run it across the lawn. On a college campus, 
it’s sometimes possible to run cables through steam or other utility tunnels, 
but that’s not practical in most other locations. Even if you have a way to route 
the cable from one building to another, the maximum practical distance 
for a 10Base-T or 100Base-T twisted pair cable connection is only about 
100 meters. If your access point is more than a hundred meters from the 
network hub, you’ll have to add one or more repeaters to the line or replace 
the twisted pair cable with a fiber optic connection. Either way, the cost is 
probably greater than using a radio link or connecting each access point to a 
separate Internet router and assigning the same SSID to each network.
Sometimes the ideal location for an access point is on a building that 
has existing Internet service, but it’s not part of the LAN you want to use 
for your campus network. In that case, you can set up a VPN link that creates 
a “tunnel” through the Internet back to your own network. The access point 
will pass data to and from your own network through the VPN just as if it was 
connected through a short cable.

Installing and Configuring Wi-Fi Access Points
177
The third alternative is often the most practical choice. Use point-to-point 
wireless links between the network hub and each of your remote access points. 
Outdoor routers and related hardware and software that are designed specif-
ically for this purpose are available from Cisco, D-Link, and many other 
suppliers. 
Networking Your Neighborhood
Someplace between the relative simplicity of a home-based wireless network 
and a complex campus network, you might want to think about extending 
your own home or small-business network: You can share a high-speed 
Internet connection with one or more nearby neighbors or allow your 
employees to take their laptop computers to the coffee shop next door. If 
you or your children like to play multiplayer games with the family next 
door, or if you want to go online from your Palm handheld or Pocket PC 
while schmoozing with your neighbors at the annual block party, a neighbor-
hood network might be the way to go.
But before you decide to hang an antenna on your roof, consider exactly 
what you want to accomplish with your neighborhood network and how you 
plan to maintain security in the rest of your network. If you’re trying to add 
a particular location to your network (such as a particular neighbor’s house, 
or the cafe that has become your de facto branch office), use a directional 
antenna that will focus your signal to the specific location you want to reach. 
On the other hand, if you want to provide an Internet hot spot for everybody 
within half a block or more, you can place a high-gain nondirectional antenna 
at the highest point on your own building. If you’re using the same LAN for 
both in-house and neighborhood use, make sure a firewall keeps your own 
computers separate from the public portion of the network. 
If your network adapter has a connector for an external antenna, you 
might want to either buy or build a directional antenna that you can point 
toward the community network’s nearest access point. It’s quite possible that 
you will discover nearby signals that were not detected by the low-gain omni-
directional antenna built into the adapter.
Many neighborhood network initiatives use an alternate distribution 
method, called wireless distribution system (WDS) or mesh. In a mesh net-
work, each access point connects to other access points that are in wireless 
range, and it provides access to clients. Mesh networks trade raw speed for 
ease of connectivity—when additional access or range is required, simply 
turn on another access point. But remember that each access point in the 
mesh that does not also have a dedicated Internet connection can reduce 
the bandwidth by up to half.
Several free and commercial mesh solutions exist, as well as the standard 
WDS supported by many routers. Typically all access points in a WDS or mesh 
network must be the same brand to properly connect.

Chapter 9
Keeping Your ISP Happy
It seems like a perfectly logical idea: Share your high-speed cable modem or 
DSL service with your next-door neighbor, and split the cost. Or let everybody 
in your apartment building or on your suburban block share a single wireless 
network. 
But consider the potential aggravation factor of dealing with your Internet 
service provider, who might view your generous sharing of a cable or DSL 
account as a threat to its (real or potential) revenue stream and a violation 
of its terms of service. Some major ISPs have specific policies that do not 
allow customers to share connections through neighborhood networks. Many 
other ISPs don’t care, and a few even encourage the practice. 
The ISPs are legitimately concerned that neighborhood networks might 
generate a lot more demand for network bandwidth than a single user connec-
tion. When you design and construct a communications network, you calculate 
the maximum capacity of your network based on predicted peak demand. If 
you get it right, your network can handle the demand with enough capacity 
to spare for emergencies, but if the demand increases beyond your expecta-
tions, the whole system overloads and you have to add more capacity. 
This kind of planning applies to telephone systems, highways, and even 
streetcar lines, as well as Internet connections. If you have enough streetcars 
(or bandwidth) to handle your rush hour traffic, the system runs efficiently 
and the number of dimes and quarters in the fare box should cover your 
expenses. But when a big new factory opens at one end of the line, 500 more 
passengers suddenly want to use your system. Unless you add more capacity, 
the cars are too crowded and everybody complains.
Experience can give you a pretty accurate idea of how much demand will 
exist at any given moment—you might not know exactly who is online at 10:15 
on a Tuesday morning, but you can predict how many streetcars or how much 
bandwidth you will need to handle the demand.
In the case of an Internet account, the ISP has built enough bandwidth 
to handle the peak demand (in an office, it’s probably first thing in the 
morning and at lunchtime; in a residential neighborhood, it’s after school). 
But if that demand doubles, they’ll have to buy and install more equipment 
and find a source of revenue to pay for it. They want to prevent the kind of 
unexpected additional demands for bandwidth that can break down the 
whole system, or, more accurately, they want to know about it and plan (and 
charge) accordingly.
You have three choices: Ask your ISP if it has a policy on shared connec-
tions and follow its guidelines (which might mean finding a different ISP); 
go ahead and install your neighborhood access points and hope the telephone 
company, cable service, or other ISP doesn’t find out about it; or investigate 
a commercial connection type such as synchronous DSL or even a T1-class 
line, which will cost more but should have less restrictive terms of use.

Installing and Configuring Wi-Fi Access Points

Network Security: Everybody Is Your Neighbor
The most basic configuration of a neighborhood network is a single access 
point with a wide coverage footprint and an unprotected connection to the 
Internet. Anybody with a network adapter within range of your signal can use 
your network to exchange data through the Internet. That includes the family 
next door, but it also includes the guy in the van parked on the street who’s 
using your network to download pornography. 
Unless you are intentionally creating a public Internet hot spot for every-
body who comes along, you should use some of the security tools built into 
the Wi-Fi specifications. Chapter 12 covers security in more detail, but here 
are the most important security tools:
 Turn on WEP or WPA key encryption. This one is crucial. It’s true that a 
dedicated intruder can crack a WEP key in less than an hour, but it does 
discourage the casual drive-by user and serves as a “do not disturb” sign.
 Use MAC address filtering to restrict access to your network to specific 
network adapters. Again, it’s not difficult to spoof a MAC address with 
the right software, but it’s one more impediment to unauthorized access.
 Turn off the DHCP function that automatically assigns a numeric IP 
address to each client, and assign a specific address to each authorized 
user.
 Turn on the firewall function in your access point or router.
 Use an external server or a firewall that forces each user to supply a 
username and password before it connects them to the Internet.
 Use a VPN.
If you’re using the same network to link two or more of your own com-
puters, use a firewall to isolate that part of the network from the public access 
point. Encourage all of the legitimate users of your network to pay close 
attention to file sharing so they don’t allow outsiders to read or write the data 
stored on their computers. Also, be sure to change the access point’s admin-
istrative password. Do not use admin or any other widely used default password. 
An intruder who breaks into your access point can cause massive damage to 
your network.

As low cost Wi-Fi equipment has become 
widely available, many users have thought 
about aiming an antenna at a nearby building 
or a hillside 5 or 10 miles away to create a cheap, 
high speed, two-way data link. Some experimenters 
and tinkerers with more time than money have even 
designed their own antennas out of tin cans, potato chip canisters, and junk 
from their basement workshops. They have generally discovered that Wi-Fi 
links can be a reliable way to move data across a lot of ground.
This chapter contains information about designing and using point-to-
point wireless network links. A point-to-point wireless link can be part of a larger 
Wi-Fi network, it can act as a simple bridge between two wired LANs, or it can 
add a single distant site to an existing LAN. Point-to-point service differs from 
other Wi-Fi networks because it moves data between two specific locations 
rather than broadcasting a network signal to any network client within range

of the radio signal. It’s also possible to use Wi-Fi as part of a wireless gateway 
that provides Internet access to a community or an isolated location where 
affordable landlines are not available.
Why extend a wireless network? Point-to-point links can serve several 
purposes:
 It can extend a single network to include users in more than one build-
ing. In an office park or on a college campus, a business or academic 
department that occupies space in more than one building can use 
wireless to share LAN services across all the organization’s locations.
 It can move data across a barrier such as a highway or a river. If there’s a 
clean line of sight, a wireless link can jump across a gap that could make 
it difficult or impossible to string cables from one building to another.
 It can provide LAN and high-speed Internet access to users and unat-
tended computers in remote locations. A wireless link can extend a 
broadband connection to places that are not served by broadband DSL 
or cable modem Internet service, or even by Plain Old Telephone Service. 
 It can establish wireless network links as an inexpensive alternative to 
leased lines. Private data circuits supplied by the telephone company or 
other common carriers normally involve a one-time installation fee and a 
recurring monthly payment. The annual cost of a leased line can often 
be many times greater than the one-time cost of buying and installing a 
radio link.
In a sense, a point-to-point Wi-Fi network link is a completely different 
category from a wireless LAN. Both use the same radio technology, and it’s 
quite possible to extend a wireless LAN beyond the limits of a single building, 
but a point-to-point link could just as easily use some other type of radio 
modulation at some other frequency, rather than DSSS at 2.4 GHz, and 
perform the same function. You can find some pointers to alternative methods 
for connecting remote sites to your network later in this chapter.
Extending the LAN
A point-to-point wireless network link can be either a LAN at one end con-
nected to a single client device at the other end or a bridge between two 
LANs. In other words, the end points of a link can be either a single computer 
or other device, or a full network.
A wireless LAN with a remote client, like the one shown in Figure 10-1, 
works the same way as a network with two or more access points within a 
single building. The only difference is that one or more access points con-
nected to the LAN use an outdoor antenna aimed at a client computer in a 
remote location. The remote computer appears to the network exactly like 
every other computer on the same LAN.

location.
A wireless network bridge, like the one shown in Figure 10-2, is a 
link between two segments of the same LAN. The two segments might 
be separated by as little as a few hundred feet or as far apart as several 
miles or more.

Chapter 10
If the distance between the end points is too far for a single radio link, or 
if there are obstructions to the line-of-sight signal path, a point-to-point link 
can include one or more repeaters at relay points between the origin and the 
destination. A relay point can be situated at an isolated location, such as a 
radio tower or a rooftop, or a place with additional network clients, such as a 
third building between the two end points.
A point-to-point link can use any access point and network adapter that 
has connectors for external antennas. However, several manufacturers offer 
wireless routers that have been specifically designed for outdoor bridging 
applications, which are often a better choice. Routers made by Plexus, 
HyperLink Technologies, Cisco, and other manufacturers all combine 
access points with routers, so they make the network a lot easier to assemble.
Bridge Routers
A bridge router is the opposite of an access point: An access point connects 
to a wired LAN and converts the network connection to Wi-Fi signals; a bridge 
router connects to the network through a Wi-Fi link and provides one or more 
wired Ethernet ports. In other words, a bridge router provides a wireless link 
between two parts of the same LAN. Many of the same manufacturers that 
make access points and network interfaces also offer bridge routers as part 
of their product lines. Figure 10-3 shows a Wi-Fi bridge router as part of an 
extended LAN.
Figure 10-3: A bridge uses Wi-Fi to connect a remote location to a LAN.
You could use a bridge router to share a LAN or single broadband 
Internet connection among two or more buildings. For example, you can 
use a bridge router to distribute your neighbor’s DSL or cable Internet 
service to two or more computers in your own house (with your neighbor’s 
permission, of course). Or if your business has offices in two or more nearby 
buildings, a bridge router could extend the LAN between buildings.

Long Range Point-to-Point Links

Point-to-Point and Point-to-Multipoint
An indoor access point uses either a nondirectional antenna that radiates 
equal amounts of energy in all directions from the middle of the intended 
coverage area, or a directional antenna with a wide aperture angle located at 
one edge (or a corner) of the coverage area. An access point that provides 
wireless service to any location within a designated area (such as an office or 
a house) is a point-to-multipoint service; it can exchange data with many network 
clients at the same time.
A point-to-point link has a different objective: It moves as many of the 
radiated signals as possible between two fixed locations. Radio signals move 
across the link in both directions, so each access point, router, or network 
adapter uses the same antenna for both transmitting and receiving. The goal 
is to focus the radio signal toward the antenna at the other end of the link, so 
at least one of the end points uses a directional antenna. If the link covers a 
long distance, both antennas should be directional for the strongest possible 
signals.
In a campus or similar area where the network connects several buildings, 
the network links can be split to distribute network service from a central 
location to remote sites in more than one direction. In this kind of system, 
the central access point uses a nondirectional antenna, and each remote uses 
a directional antenna, as shown in Figure 10-4. In a system where two remote 
sites are in the same general location relative to the primary base station, the 
best choice might be a directional antenna with a wider operating angle. 
A more complex system might include a combination of directional and 
omnidirectional antennas.
Figure 10-4: An omnidirectional antenna can distribute signals to two or more remote 
locations at the same time.
Installing a Point-to-Point Link
The first step in conducting a point-to-point site survey is to identify a 
possible signal path. In theory, it ought to be possible to calculate the 
required height of both antennas and identify the path between them, 
but it almost never works out that way. There’s almost always a certain 
amount of tweaking required before you can fire up your radios and start to

move data across the network. You can perform a preliminary survey with a 
good map (such as a topographical map from the US Geological Survey), 
but at some point you will want to climb up onto the roof (or look out the 
window) and confirm that there’s a line of sight to the place you want to put 
the other end of the link. If the path extends more than a few hundred 
yards, bring a pair of binoculars with you.
You can generally place an antenna on your own building without any 
special permits, but if you want to use the roof of a commercial building, you 
will probably need permission from the property owner and possibly from 
the local zoning board or other land-use agency. This probably won’t be a 
problem when you’re mounting an inconspicuous antenna, but keep it in 
mind if you have to use a relatively large dish or something similar. If you’re 
using an existing pole or tower to support the antenna, make sure you’re not 
producing or receiving interference with other antennas nearby.
Climbing a pole or tower with a belt full of tools and securely mounting 
a bulky antenna in a precise position 30 or more feet in the air is not a casual 
afternoon project. Don’t even consider it without appropriate safety equip-
ment, including hard hats for everybody involved—a dropped wrench or bolt 
can be lethal. If you don’t have experience with this kind of work, there’s no 
shame in hiring somebody to do the job for you. The people who sell point-
to-point antennas can tell you where to find a qualified antenna rigger in 
your area.
Choose a Signal Path
The first step in installing a link is to decide exactly where it will go. If you’re 
just extending the network across a parking lot or a highway, the path will be 
obvious; choose a location that avoids the big tree in front of the building. 
But if the distance between antennas is more than about half a mile, you 
will probably want to lay out the path on a map first.
Topographical maps, either on paper or online, will give you the best 
level of detail. See http://www.topozone.com for maps of the entire United States; 
http://toporama.cits.rncan.gc.ca is the source for maps of Canada. If the exact 
locations for both end points are not immediately obvious on a map, a GPS 
device can provide precise geographic coordinates.
Reaching the Boondocks: Long-Range Links
The distance covered by most point-to-point wireless network links can 
probably be measured in yards rather than miles (or if you prefer, in meters 
rather than kilometers), so installing the link is relatively easy. The other end 
of the link is in plain sight, so the antennas are easy to aim at each other. 
Signal strength is usually not a problem on a short hop, especially with direc-
tional antennas.
A longer link is possible, but it’s more difficult to set up because the 
signal will be weaker, and it’s a lot more important to point the antennas 
accurately. Figure 10-5 (and some common sense) shows why a receiver 
becomes harder to find as you move farther away from the transmitter.

Long Range Point-to-Point Links
187
Figure 10-5: A small angle change in the direction of an antenna can have a 
huge effect on the connection if a receiver is several miles away.
It’s also more difficult to locate a particular building or other end point 
with the unaided eye when it’s one of many buildings on a hillside or in a 
valley several miles away, so a telescope or a pair of binoculars is an essential 
part of your installation tool bag. Starting at the location where the network 
connection is already in place, look for the target site from the roof or an 
upper-story window. If you can find it, you can probably install a network link 
from here to there.
However, at least one of the antennas in a long-range link must be high 
enough to overcome the obstructions caused by Fresnel zone interference and 
the curvature of the earth. This isn’t a serious problem for a one- or two-mile 
link—the roof of a two-story building is probably high enough to give you the 
clearance you need unless there are a lot of trees in the way—but if you’re 
trying to push a signal five miles or more, the height of the antenna is a 
significant issue. This is the reason you often see radio towers on top of hills 
and tall buildings.
Aligning the Antennas
For best performance, a directional antenna must be aimed directly toward 
the antenna at the other end of the link. If the antennas at both end points 
are directional, they must both be pointed correctly. In most cases, the best 
place to locate an antenna is on the roof or a tower, or bolted to an outside 
wall, but sometimes it’s possible to place it indoors next to a window if there’s 
a clean line of sight to the other end of the link. 
It’s entirely possible to align a pair of antennas by watching the signal 
strength display in your Wi-Fi configuration software, but when you’re working 
with long-range links and weak signals, a piece of test equipment called a 
spectrum analyzer will provide much more precise information. A spectrum 
analyzer is a special-purpose radio receiver that displays a portion of the 
radio spectrum as a visual image. Because the display shows any radio signal 
it detects as a spike in the graphic display, the spike will grow larger as the 
signal strength increases. Therefore, you can use the display to find the best 
possible positions for your antennas.
Unfortunately, most general-purpose spectrum analyzers that can display 
a 2.4 GHz signal are quite expensive devices—a new one will probably cost 
3 miles
50 yards

Chapter 10
several thousand dollars or more. However, MetaGeek (http://www.metageek
.net) makes a simple and relatively inexpensive USB spectrum analyzer called 
Wi-Spy, which is designed specifically for evaluating signals within the 2.4 GHz 
band. Figure 10-6 shows the display from a laptop connected to a Wi-Spy 
analyzer. If you can’t find a spectrum analyzer easily, don’t worry about it; 
the signal strength display in the Wi-Fi software will work well enough.
Figure 10-6: The MetaGeek Wi-Spy spectrum analyzer provides a graphic 
display of Wi-Fi radio signals. 
Installing and aligning the antennas for a point-to-point link is not a 
one-person job. At a bare minimum, you will need one person at each end 
to adjust the antenna’s positions to find the strongest signal; if an antenna is 
not right next to the computer or spectrum analyzer, you will want one person 
watching the screen while another moves the antenna. If you can place a 
team at each end of the link with telephones or two-way radios, it will save a 
lot of time and aggravation.
To aim the antennas properly, follow these steps:
1.
Choose the exact location where you want to install each antenna and 
securely mount the masts or poles that will hold it.
2.
Use the mounting hardware supplied with each antenna to attach it to the 
mast, pole, or other supporting structure. Point the antenna toward the 
other end point of the link, but don’t tighten the mounting screws yet; 
you will want to adjust the antenna’s position more precisely.
3.
Run the feed cables from the antenna to your wireless router, access point, 
or network adapter. If you have access to a spectrum analyzer that can 
operate at 2.4 GHz, connect it to the feed cable coming from the antenna.

Long Range Point-to-Point Links
189
4.
Connect the routers or access points to their respective networks and 
turn on the radios at both ends. If you are using a spectrum analyzer, 
tune it to the frequency of the radio channel that your access point or 
router is using. If you don’t have a spectrum analyzer, start the config-
uration utility on your network device. If only one end of the network 
link has a directional antenna, that’s the one to adjust.
5.
Slowly move the antenna connected to the router or the spectrum 
analyzer. You should see a peak in the signal strength display when this 
antenna is aimed directly at the other end of the link. Move the antenna 
left and right first, and then adjust the vertical angle. When the signal 
strength display or the spectrum analyzer shows the strongest signal, 
tighten the antenna mounting hardware to maintain that position.
6.
If the other antenna is also directional, repeat the signal peaking 
process. If you have a second team at the remote site, they can make 
the adjustments on their antenna while they communicate via radio 
or telephone with the people at the point of origin.
7.
If it’s not already connected to the network device, connect the feed line 
from the antenna to your router, access point, or network adapter.
At this point, you should be able to exchange data between the two end 
points in both directions. If you can’t get enough signal through the link to 
produce a usable network connection, make sure both the network adapter 
and the access point are set to operate at full power. If that’s not enough to 
provide a useful signal, you might have to boost the signal with an RF amplifier 
or replace one or both antennas with other antennas that have more gain.
Obstructions and Relays
Each antenna in a point-to-point link must have an unobstructed line of sight 
to the antenna at the other end of the link. If there’s a building or a mountain 
between the origin and the destination, you’ll have to find a way to get your 
signal over or around it. If the signal path goes through a wooded area, try to 
run your site survey during the spring or summer because a signal that 
passes through bare branches without any trouble can often be shut down by 
leaves and other foliage.
You can’t bend a radio signal around an obstruction, so the only way to 
get past it is to use a repeater at a location that has a line of sight to both end 
points. A repeater can be a single router with space for two radios, such as 
the Proxim Outdoor Router, two separate routers connected through an 
Ethernet network cable, or a pair of access points connected through a 
network hub. To reduce the effects of interference between the two antennas, 
each segment of a multihop network link should use a different radio channel.
As a side benefit, the same router that relays the network to a second 
radio can also provide network service to the building where the relay is 
located, or it can split the network and relay signals to two or more remote 
end points. So, for example, the central control point of a Wi-Fi network 

190
Chapter 10
might be located on a valley floor with a link to a relay point on a nearby 
hilltop or rooftop. From the hilltop repeater, the same network can be 
extended to two or more locations in as many different directions.
Alternatives to Wi-Fi for Point-to-Point
Long-range Wi-Fi links are not the only way to connect remote clients to a 
LAN. Other methods for extending a network are often easier or more 
reliable.
The main reasons to use Wi-Fi equipment in a point-to-point wireless link 
are that the equipment is widely available and relatively inexpensive, it doesn’t 
require a special license, and the link can be part of an existing wireless LAN. 
But it’s also possible to use other radios that use different (licensed or 
unlicensed) radio frequencies or different types of radio signals.
The IEEE 802.11 specification (without any other suffix letter) covers 
radios that use both direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) and frequency-
hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) modulation. In a radio environment 
where interference from other wireless LANs is a problem, a different 
technology can often cut through the noise to produce a stronger and 
cleaner stream of data. 
Each type of radio offers a different combination of data transmission 
speed and signal range. For example, BreezeCom’s PRO.11 family of wireless 
network products use FHSS radios that can move data at up to 3Mbps over a 
distance of up to 30 miles. A BreezeCom Workgroup Bridge connects directly 
to a 10Base-T Ethernet LAN. 
If the 11Mbps data speed of an 802.11b is not fast enough to meet your 
requirements, other devices can provide faster connections, but they generally 
have shorter ranges than a Wi-Fi link. 802.11a equipment has a maximum 
data speed of around 54Mbps at 5 GHz. C-SPEC’s OverLAN HS 100 has a 
top speed of about 100Mbps, but the signal range is significantly shorter than 
a Wi-Fi link.
For links with a degraded line of sight, modified Atheros radios from 
Ubiquity Networks use the 802.11g OFDM encoding at 900 MHz, which can 
handle interference from foliage and buildings much more effectively.
This is a book about wireless networks, but sometimes it’s useful to 
remember that the point of the exercise is to establish a network connection 
or access to the Internet and not a wireless link. If a broadband connection to 
the Internet already exists at the remote location, go ahead and use it. Just 
because a point-to-point wireless link is possible, it’s not always necessary. 
For example, a virtual private network can provide all the advantages of a 
point-to-point wireless link without the hassles of setting up a pair of antennas. 
As far as the people using the network are concerned, a single network with a 
VPN tunnel connecting two or more buildings looks just like a network with 
a radio link. Another approach that can often be effective is to run cables from 
one building to the next through utility tunnels. 

Long Range Point-to-Point Links
191
Antennas for Network Adapters
If you’re using a point-to-point link to reach a single distant network client, 
you will need a network adapter that accepts an external antenna. You might 
find a PC Card adapter with an antenna connector, but Buffalo and other 
manufacturers offer USB Wi-Fi network adapters that can use an external 
antenna.
Because some adapters use proprietary antenna connectors, they require 
a special cable called a pigtail with a standard antenna cable connector at one 
end and a plug that matches the adapter’s connector at the other. A proprie-
tary pigtail can cost more than the network adapter, but comparable pigtails 
are also available at less than a third of the adapter maker’s prices from several 
other sources, including Fleeman Anderson & Bird (http://www.fab-corp.com) 
and HyperLink Technologies (http://www.hyperlinktech.com). The small cables 
used for pigtails can often be the most poorly shielded component in your 
network; always keep pigtails as short as possible to maximize the signal 
strength.
Build Your Own Antenna?
Many community network enthusiasts have designed and built their own 
antennas out of odd hardware, plastic spacers, copper wire, and empty cans. 
Depending on the contents of your junk box and your pantry, the materials 
for a homemade high-gain directional antenna might cost as little as three or 
four dollars, not counting the price of a can of coffee, beef stew, or potato 
chips. If you have to go out and buy all the parts and hand tools necessary for 
the project, you might spend $20 or more.
However, when you add the value of the time necessary to assemble the 
antenna and tweak it for optimal performance, it’s not at all clear that rolling 
your own would be less expensive than buying an inexpensive commercial 
antenna. It’s not unusual to spend three to six hours or more assembling one 
of these “cheap” home brew antennas. A few minutes of online searching 
(look for “2.4 GHz antenna”) should find several sources for store-bought 
directional antennas under $25 that will work at least as well as the ones you 
can build. Keep in mind that your access point or network client adapter 
doesn’t need an antenna that can handle high power, so you can get by with 
a relatively lightweight unit.
The most common type of directional antenna for point-to-point commu-
nication is called a yagi, or more properly, a Yagi-Uda antenna system. It was 
named for the two Japanese engineers, Professor Hidetsugu Yagi and Professor 
Shintaro Uda of Tohuku University, who designed and constructed the first 
ones around 1926. A typical yagi antenna, like the one shown in Figure 10-7, 
has a single active element whose length is exactly half the wavelength of the 
radio frequency at which the antenna will operate (at 2.4 GHz, that’s about 
2.35 inches). Quarter-wavelength elements will also work. Additional elements, 
called reflectors and directors, are located parallel to the active element at 

192
Chapter 10
very specific intervals determined by the size of the active element. Reflectors 
are located behind the active element, while the directors are in front of it. 
Most of the rooftop television aerials that were common before the days of 
cable and satellites were yagis.
Figure 10-7: A yagi antenna has one active element, 
one reflector, and several directors.
A yagi always has just one reflector, which is about 5 percent longer 
than the active element, and several directors, which are about 5 percent 
shorter than the active element (each additional director should be 
slightly shorter than the one behind it). As you add more elements to a 
yagi, the amount of gain increases. If you want to consider building a yagi 
of your own, take a look at Rob Flickenger’s antenna built inside a Pringles 
potato chip can at http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/448. 
Many designs for home brew 2.4 GHz yagi antennas use one-inch washers 
as reflectors, directors, and active elements. This will work, but it’s not ideal 
for two reasons: First, at 2.437 GHz (the center frequency of Wi-Fi channel 6) 
a quarter-wavelength active element should be about 1.16 inches long, so 
those washers are about 16 percent smaller than they ought to be for ideal 
performance; and second, the reflector and directors are the same size as the 
active element, which reduces the gain (or sensitivity) of the antenna. But 
considering that the whole thing was built out of about $7 worth of parts, it’s 
close enough. If a pair of these antennas gets your signal from here to there 
and back again at high speed, it really doesn’t matter that the reflectors and 
directors aren’t exactly the right size.
Darren Fulton’s more traditional 13-element design at http://www.users
.bigpond.com/Darren.fulton/yagi/13_element_yagi_antenna_for_2.htm, shown in 
Figure 10-8, uses antenna elements cut to length from heavy-gauge brass or 
copper wire and a reflector made of sheet aluminum.

Figure 10-8: Darren Fulton’s home brew yagi antenna has a 
total of 13 elements.
A yagi isn’t the only type of directional antenna that lends itself to 
build-it-yourself designs. Waveguide antennas, with a radiating element 
inside a reflective metal cylinder or cone, use another extremely effective 
design. The antenna’s performance depends on the size of the enclosure, the 
length of the radiating element, and its exact position. Greg Rehm’s instruc-
tions for assembling a tin can waveguide antenna are online at http://www
.turnpoint.net/wireless/cantennahowto.html.
If you want to boost your signal gain in all directions, you should use an 
omnidirectional antenna. The instructions at http://jgomsi.com/obelix/wireless/
guerrilla2/ are a good place to start.
Based on the tests and measurements posted on the Internet for these 
and other home brew antennas, it appears that they’re both effective and 
cheap, especially if you don’t include the value of your time when you calculate 
the cost. It’s all a matter of attitude: If you thought “that sounds like a fun 
project” when you read about building a home brew antenna, go for it. But if 
spending an afternoon with a soldering iron in your hand sounds like a form 
of cruel and unusual punishment, remember that an inexpensive commercial 
antenna will do the same job just as well, with a lot less effort.

For many people, connecting to the Inter-
net when they’re away from home or the 
office is more important than operating or 
using their own network. Wi-Fi signals in schools, 
libraries, airports, coffee shops, and conference centers, 
aboard trains and buses, and even in city parks and 
highway rest areas go a long way toward making your laptop computer or 
other portable a go-anywhere Internet appliance. In many urban areas, it 
seems as if there are Wi-Fi networks almost everywhere. When you open your 
computer’s wireless network setup program in a city center or a residential 
neighborhood, it often detects half a dozen or more Wi-Fi signals. Depending 
on your location, many of these signals are likely to be business office LANs 
or home networks, but many others are public networks that welcome con-
nections from outside users (that’s you). Some of these services charge by 
the hour (or by the month) for Internet access, but many others are free.
This chapter explains how to find Wi-Fi access points that will allow you 
to connect and how to choose the best access point when your computer 
detects more than one nearby network.

Public Wi-Fi Is Not Secure
Any time you use a public Wi-Fi hot spot, there is a very real possibility that 
somebody else is reading everything that moves to and from your computer, 
including your login names and passwords, email, instant messages, and 
personal information on web pages. Wi-Fi network monitor programs that 
can capture and display Wi-Fi data packets as they move through the air are 
easy to find and use. Other programs can use that captured data to crack 
your WEP or WPA keys. Figure 11-1 shows a network monitoring program in 
action.
Figure 11-1: Wireshark, a freely available packet sniffer, allows unsavory latte drinkers to 
listen in on your online coffee house conversations. The figure shows a sensitive chat session 
in MSN Messenger—but whenever you’re on a public network, remember that all your 
unencrypted email, chats, and web browsing are subject to similar public scrutiny. Behave 
accordingly! 
Just because a Wi-Fi hot spot is operated by your hotel or a well-known 
chain of coffee shops or bookstores doesn’t meant that your data is secure. 
Somebody in a car parked nearby (or the hotel room next door) could be 
watching your keystrokes as you type them—or even modifying them as 
they go.
Therefore, it’s essential to remember that public Wi-Fi connections are 
not secure. Don’t use a Wi-Fi hot spot in a hotel, coffee shop, conference 
center, or any other location to send or receive information that you would 
not want to share with everybody else in the room (or in the hotel room 
next door).

sense—don’t conduct online banking or send your credit card number (or 
any other confidential information) from a public hot spot—you should be 
able to strike a balance between security and convenience.
Whenever possible, encrypt your traffic with a VPN or other mechanism 
(see Chapter 15 for ways to do this). This will not only protect your data 
from prying eyes, but it will help prevent someone from injecting malicious 
data into your system. 
Remember that not all websites use SSL (denoted by https in the URL and 
the padlock icon at the top or bottom of the window in most browsers, as 
shown in Figure 11-2) to encrypt the entire session. Often only the login is 
encrypted to protect the username and password, but the following pages 
are not protected to save CPU resources from encrypting data from thousands 
or millions of users. 
Figure 11-2: All browsers use variations 
on the padlock icon to signify a secure 
(HTTPS) connection.
Finding a Wi-Fi Hot Spot
The easiest and most obvious way to find a Wi-Fi network is to turn on your 
computer and run its Wi-Fi control program. The network adapter will scan 
for nearby signals and display a list like the one in Figure 11-3, which shows 
the unsecured signals available in the lobby of a hotel next to Seattle’s Lake 
Union. When you’re in an unfamiliar neighborhood (or even just a few blocks 
away from your usual haunts), you might not know which networks would 
welcome your connection and which ones are private. Just because the owner 
of a network hasn’t bothered to turn on encryption doesn’t mean it’s an open 
invitation for you to use that network.
AD HOC NETWORKS
You can also see a bogus public network in Figure 11-3 that claims to offer “Free 
Public WiFi.” Notice, however, that the icon next to the Free Public Wifi network 
displays a computer-to-computer link—an ad hoc network. This could really be a 
direct link to a computer operated by a thief trying to steal your passwords and other 
private data that he can later use to read your email or drain your bank account. 
More likely, it’s a victim of the ad hoc network bug described later in this chapter. If 
your computer identifies a nearby network as a free Wi-Fi site, you should not trust it. 
Don’t bother connecting to open ad hoc networks without the “Free Wifi” name—they 
won’t let you get online anyway. The only time you should trust an ad hoc network is 
when you’re deliberately exchanging data with another computer in the same room.

Chapter 11
In Figure 11-3, the two ibahn signals are the hotel’s Wi-Fi hot spots; 
cascadelink and kenmoreair are access points in the waiting room for the 
Kenmore Air seaplane base across the street. 
Figure 11-3: The Windows Network Connection window provides a list 
of nearby networks.
The best approach is often to do some research before you try to connect—
either consult an online directory of hot spots (such as http://www.wifinder.com, 
http://www.netstumbler.com/hotspots, or http://www.wififreespot.com) before you 
leave home, or look for some kind of “Wi-Fi Here” sign near the door or cash 
register at a coffee shop, the information desk at the library, or some other 
obvious location. If you can find an instruction sheet or information card that 
provides details about a public network you want to use, be sure to connect 
to that network’s SSID rather than some other unknown signal that your 
system detects nearby. 
If you subscribe to a specific public Wi-Fi service, such as Boingo or 
T-Mobile, you can download and install a program that can identify that 
company’s sites and automatically set up a connection. Figure 11-4 shows the 
T-Mobile Connection Manager.
When you choose the Wi-Fi option at the right side of the window and 
choose Networks, the Connection Manager program scans for nearby signals 
and displays a list in the window shown in Figure 11-5. This image was taken 
at the same location as the one in Figure 11-1.
NOTE
If you have trouble connecting to your email server or IM system on a paid Wi-Fi network, 
try running a web browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox first. Many subscription 
services use the browser to display a login/password screen.

Figure 11-4: The T-Mobile Connection Manager 
provides access to Wi-Fi and other broadband 
wireless networks.
In spite of your best intentions to check out the directories and guides 
before you leave home, you will probably find yourself in a new location where 
you want to find and use a Wi-Fi network to connect your computer to the 
Internet. The control programs supplied with your Wi-Fi adapter, your com-
puter’s operating system, and your computer all make it easy to identify and 
choose the best nearby network signal; sniffer programs such as NetStumbler 
(also called Network Stumbler) provide even more information about each 
network that you can use to make a more informed choice.
Figure 11-5: The T-Mobile Connection Manager detects nearby Wi-Fi networks.
To find a Wi-Fi network, simply turn on your computer and run your 
favorite Wi-Fi network setup program. Some public networks are open to 
anybody who wants to use them, but many others require an account (paid 
or otherwise) with the network’s operator. When you connect to an account-
holders-only network, you will see a login screen each time you try to use your 
web browser or other Internet application program with the network.
Keeping Your Data Secure
Any time you connect to the Internet through a public hot spot, be sure your 
computer’s firewall is active to keep other people from connecting to your com-
puter while you’re collecting email, swapping instant messages, or blogging 
about the current speaker at the conference you’re attending.

200
Chapter 11
Both Windows (XP and Vista) and Mac OS X include built-in firewalls, 
as do all the standard Linux distributions. For more about firewalls and other 
network security issues related to wireless networks, see Chapter 12. 
It’s equally important to remember that nonelectronic methods of stealing 
data can be just as effective as monitoring your wireless signals through another 
computer. When you send and receive email or instant messages, and when 
you type an unsecured account name and password in a public place such as 
a coffee shop, a library, or a conference, you’re running two kinds of risks: a 
data monitor program (also known as a snooping program) on a nearby com-
puter can capture your password as you send it, and a shoulder surfer can 
watch your screen and keyboard and note your login information as you type 
it into the computer. 
The best way to protect your data from over-the-air monitoring is to use a 
virtual private network (VPN) between your portable computer and the LAN 
at your office or home. Chapter 15 offers detailed information about installing 
and using a VPN. If that’s not possible, wait for a secure connection before 
you conduct financial transactions or send private email. The only way to keep 
your critical data absolutely secure is to never send it through a Wi-Fi net-
work. That might sound like an extreme statement, and it probably is, but it’s 
nonetheless true.
NOTE
Don’t assume that your Wi-Fi connection is secure just because you’re alone in a hotel 
room or an office. That Wi-Fi signal can easily pass through walls and floors to a data 
snoop in another room or in a car parked on a nearby street.
Keeping other people’s eyes away from your screen requires a different 
kind of protection. If possible, find a table in a coffee shop or other public 
location where you can sit with your back to a wall so nobody can look over 
your shoulder without your knowledge. If that’s not practical, when you’re in 
a lecture hall or the audience of a public event, or when you’re aboard an 
airplane or a train, consider using a privacy filter (made by 3M and others) 
over your computer’s screen that makes it impossible to see the image unless 
you’re directly in front of it. Once again, the most effective way to protect 
your data from unwanted attention is to wait until you can use the computer 
privately. 
NetStumbler and Other Sniffer Tools
A sniffer tool is a program that uses a wireless network adapter to scan for 
active networks and displays the characteristics of each network. NetStumbler 
is a very slick Windows utility that will find network characteristics and display 
a list, like the one in Figure 11-6, that shows everything you need to know 
about a detected network signal, including the MAC address, SSID, channel 
number, and the signal strength and quality. If you have a global positioning 
system (GPS) device connected to your computer, NetStumbler can also iden-
tify the exact latitude and longitude of the location where it detected the 
strongest signal from each access point, and it can estimate the distance 

Connecting to an Existing Wi-Fi Network
201
between your current location and the access point. Among other things, 
NetStumbler displays numeric values for the signal strength and noise level 
of each network, rather than just a set of bars. This can be particularly 
helpful when you’re looking for the best possible location for an access 
point or aiming a directional antenna to find the strongest possible signal. 
Figure 11-6: NetStumbler finds and displays extensive details about every wireless Ethernet signal that it 
can find.
For most of us, NetStumbler and other sniffers can pull more Wi-Fi infor-
mation out of the air than we’ll ever need, but if you’re trying to map all 
the signals and compare the signal quality of your own complex Wi-Fi net-
work, or if you’re curious about the technical details of nearby networks, 
sniffers can be useful tools. NetStumbler is beggarware, which means that it’s 
available at no cost, but users who consider it to be useful are invited to send 
an unspecified donation to the developer. You can download NetStumbler 
from http://www.netstumbler.com/downloads. 
Several other more complex Wi-Fi sniffer tools are also available, but most 
of them require a computer running Linux or Unix. The TuxMobil website 
(http://tuxmobil.org/linux_wireless_sniffer.html) is a good source for links to 
information about Wi-Fi sniffers and scanners. One of the most popular is 
Kismet (available from http://www.kismetwireless.net), which includes tools for 
sniffing wireless packets, identifying networks, and detecting intrusion into 
your own computer. Kismet was created by Mike Kershaw, the technical 
reviewer of this book. You can find descriptions of more of these programs at 
the usual software sources for your own Unix or Linux distribution or from 
SourceForge.net (http://www.sourceforge.net).

Chapter 11
Public Hot Spots
If you don’t know which public wireless service has the network service con-
tract at the airport where you’re waiting to change planes, or at the convention 
center where you’re attending meetings, you’ll have to let your computer 
search for a signal. If you don’t already have an account with a particular 
wireless service provider, most of them allow new users to set up new accounts 
on the spot. 
Airports and Conference Centers
Providing public wireless network service to airport terminals is a new and 
growing industry that appears to be simple from the consumer’s point of 
view—just install enough access points to cover all the concourses and the 
airlines’ lounges, connect them to a broadband Internet trunk, and wait for 
customers to start paying for network access. It sounds like a license to print 
money. Of course, it’s not that simple. Nothing that involves a government-
owned airport authority and a facility that supports dozens of different radio 
services for everything from air traffic control to rental car returns and shuttle 
buses is ever easy. Things get even more complicated when the airport signs 
a franchise agreement with one wireless service and every airline contracts 
with a different company to provide wireless service to all of their VIP clubs.
It seems as if the management of every airport has come up with a slightly 
different set of answers to these questions. Therefore, you can’t assume that 
the account you set up to connect in the Admirals’ Club in Chicago will also 
work at the waiting area near gate A-14 in Seattle. The only way you can find 
out is to fire up the computer and see what signals it detects. If the Wi-Fi utility 
tells you that it has found a signal, remember to look at the menu or window 
that shows the names of all the networks within range. If you have an account 
with one of those networks, go ahead and log in. If not, choose the net-
work with the best signal quality and set up a new account. To avoid falling 
into a theft-of-data trap, be sure to avoid connecting to any signals that your 
computer identifies as ad hoc networks.
If you travel through the same airports a lot, or if you belong to one or 
more of the airlines’ VIP clubs, you will want to set up a prepaid account with 
the company that provides service to those locations. When you find yourself 
in an airport (or any other location) that uses a different service, you can sign 
up for a pay-as-you-go account on the spot.
Wi-Fi service in conference centers is similar. You might need a paid sub-
scription to one of the public Wi-Fi services, but more and more conference 
organizers provide free Wi-Fi connections. To connect, turn on your laptop 
or other wireless device and look for a strong signal. If necessary, ask a confer-
ence official for the SSID of the hot spot supplied by the hotel or conference 
center.

Hotels 
Wi-Fi is available in most upscale hotels, major brand-name motels, and luxury 
vacation resorts. Wireless access to the Internet has become almost as common 
as a television in each room and free morning coffee. Some properties include 
Wi-Fi service as a standard amenity at no extra charge, while many others 
require guests to pay extra for Internet use. 
To avoid an unpleasant surprise on your bill, it’s always a good idea to 
ask about Wi-Fi charges when you check into a hotel. Some places might 
automatically add an inflated charge for network access unless you specifically 
refuse it, even if you connect to their network for just a few minutes. Like 
wildly expensive long-distance telephone calls, some innkeepers treat Internet 
access as one more potential opportunity to gouge their guests.
If you’re staying at a hotel or motel that charges an unreasonable amount 
for Wi-Fi (more than about $10 per day), tell the desk clerk that you will not 
be using the service, so they should not charge you for it. Take your laptop 
computer to a nearby coffee shop, café, public library, or some other nearby 
hot spot where you can connect at a lower cost, or even better, for free. Or if 
you travel a lot, consider using a broadband wireless data service like the ones 
described in Chapter 13 to completely bypass the hotel’s Wi-Fi network.
Many networks in hotels and other businesses will ask you to provide a 
login and password before they allow you to connect to the Internet, even if 
they don’t charge for the service, to restrict access to their own customers. 
You should receive an instruction sheet when you check in or find one on a 
table or desk in your room that explains exactly how to connect.
Aboard Planes, Trains, Buses, and Other Moving Targets
Mass transit systems and long-distance passenger railroads around the world 
also offer Wi-Fi service to their passengers; you can even find Wi-Fi networks 
aboard the ferry boats that sail across Puget Sound in Washington and Sydney 
Harbour in Australia. Wi-Fi on commercial airliners is less common, but a few 
international carriers do offer Wi-Fi service on long-haul flights. You can 
expect to find a lot more airborne wireless access in the next few years.
Connecting to a mobile hot spot is no different from connecting to any 
other Wi-Fi network, but it’s particularly important that you select the onboard 
service rather than one that might be coming from outside the vehicle; other-
wise you will move out of signal range almost immediately. Turn on your com-
puter, run the Wi-Fi control program, and choose the network you want to 
use. The mobile network that travels along with you on the bus, boat, or train 
should be obvious from its name.
Wi-Fi services that offer connections from moving trains, buses, or what-
ever generally cost more than other public Wi-Fi services because the Internet 
connection is more complicated and because you’re a captive audience—
either pay the fee or go without a connection. 

204
Chapter 11
Municipal Wi-Fi Networks 
Public Wi-Fi services with multiple access points that cover an entire neighbor-
hood or even a whole city seem like the logical extension of individual hot 
spots. It seems like a very good deal for city governments, who often think 
they can collect franchise fees or payments to place Wi-Fi antennas on utility 
poles and possibly obtain free wireless Internet service for government 
agencies while they provide high-speed Internet access to their communities. 
The idea of use-it-anywhere Wi-Fi, both for laptops and other portables, and as 
an alternative to cable and DSL connections, seems like a logical new type of 
public utility, just like electricity and the public water supply. Therefore, many 
towns and cities around the world are looking at either building their own 
wide-area Wi-Fi networks or contracting with a private service provider.
Public Wi-Fi hasn’t worked out as well as many vendors and local govern-
ments had hoped and expected, especially in major urban centers. The trade 
magazines and websites that keep track of such things are full of reports that 
one city after another has either delayed the start-up of their municipal Wi-Fi 
networks or had the private networking company that was building the system 
for them fail to deliver the service on schedule or even cancel their contracts. 
The initial gold rush mentality that seems to drive entrepreneurs toward any 
new technology has been replaced by a wait-and-see position: Until somebody 
figures out how to actually make money on a citywide system, the vendors 
are hesitant to move forward.
It turns out that community Wi-Fi networks have several possible problems. 
Signals from outdoor antennas don’t always provide reliable signals inside 
houses and commercial buildings without additional hardware; many people 
who already subscribe to wired DSL or cable Internet services don’t want to 
pay for another subscription that duplicates what they already have; and some 
of the new broadband wireless data services, such as the ones we’ll describe 
in Chapter 13, don’t require nearly as many individual access points, so 
they’re far less costly to build and maintain. Without a base of new sub-
scribers, the network suppliers don’t want to spend money on the network 
infrastructure.
In spite of these initial difficulties, a few towns and cities are already 
offering municipal Wi-Fi services, and others will follow. If you live or work 
in a place where a public Wi-Fi network is on the air, it can be a convenient 
alternative to the ones you’ve been using in coffee shops, bookstores, and 
other locations as a supplement to your own home and office networks. 
After 2009, when many broadcast television stations in the United States 
move to different channels (2011 in Canada), even more wireless data options 
will probably appear. Eventually, some kind of wide-area wireless Internet 
service will probably become available in many cities and towns around the 
world. Whether that service uses Wi-Fi, WiMAX, or some other technology 
remains to be seen.

Connecting to an Existing Wi-Fi Network
205
Like most other paid Wi-Fi networks, most municipal networks display a 
login and password entry window after you connect. In a few cases, the network 
provides some small amount of access time at no cost so you can send and 
receive email or conduct a brief instant messaging session before the payment 
meter begins to run. 
“Free Public WiFi”
There’s an odd Wi-Fi nuisance that claims to be a network called Free Public 
WiFi or Free Internet Access or some similar name, which is caused by a bug in 
many Wi-Fi control programs (including the one in Windows). Everybody 
loves something free, so it’s very tempting to click on that network and try 
to connect, especially when the alternative service charges by the hour or by 
the day. Connecting to one of these networks probably won’t damage your 
computer or destroy any data, but they’re false signals that you should know 
about and avoid. These signals are particularly common at airports, hotels, 
and other locations where a lot of people are using their laptops at the same 
time within a relatively small area.
If a Wi-Fi control program has one or more ad hoc networks in its list of 
preferred networks, it sends out a beacon signal whenever it searches for a 
connection, and every other nearby Wi-Fi adapter receives and displays the 
name of that network (for example, Free Wi-Fi Service). When the owner of 
one of those computers tries to connect to the “free” network, the control 
program adds the name to its preferred list, and it sends out yet another 
beacon signal. And so it goes, quietly creating more useless new beacon signals 
all the time. In a busy airport waiting area, you might see half a dozen or more 
separate Free Wi-Fi ad hoc network listings in your Wi-Fi control program.
The original Free Wi-Fi signal was probably a network cracker who wanted 
to steal passwords and other data from unsuspecting travelers. However, the 
bug in the Wi-Fi control programs that causes it to reproduce itself has created 
a wireless worm that is more of a nuisance than a serious security threat.
Figure 11-7 shows a Windows Wireless Network Connection program 
that has detected three separate bogus ad hoc networks. In this case, these 
signals are probably coming from laptop computers in hotel rooms directly 
above the lobby where the image was captured. 
If you look closely at the Wi-Fi control program, you will notice that each 
of these signals is coming from an ad hoc (computer-to-computer) link rather 
than a Wi-Fi access point, so there’s a different kind of icon associated with 
that network’s listing. If your Wi-Fi control program shows the properties of 
each signal, you will discover that the addresses of the Free Public WiFi, Free 
Internet, and hpsetup networks all begin with 02-XX, which is not a legitimate 
MAC address number. 

206
Chapter 11
Figure 11-7: The three computer-to-computer networks in this screen are 
not what they appear to be.
In spite of the tempting names, you should not try to connect to any of 
these networks. In most cases, you probably won’t connect to anything, but 
your computer will add Free Public WiFi (or whatever name the beacon is using) 
to your own list of approved networks, and it will start sending out yet another 
ad hoc signal with the same name. Worse yet, if your computer does create 
an ad hoc network with another computer nearby, the person using that 
other computer might be able to open and read your files.
NOTE
If you do connect successfully to the Internet through one of these bogus hot spots and 
read your email, use instant messaging, or do anything else that requires a login and 
password, there’s an excellent chance that somebody will grab your data as it moves 
through the network. Be sure to change all your account names and passwords—yes, 
all of them—as soon as possible.
If your computer connects to one of these sites automatically, disconnect 
or turn off your Wi-Fi adapter immediately. To make sure your computer 
doesn’t continue to send out a Free Wi-Fi beacon, follow these steps:
1.
Open the Network Connection control program you normally use.
2.
If Free Public WiFi or any other ad hoc network that you don’t normally 
use appears in the list, select it (but don’t click the Connect button) 
and open the Advanced Settings (in Windows), Profiles window (in 
Intel PROSet), or the section that controls preset connection profiles. 
In Windows, open the Wireless Networks tab, as shown in Figure 11-8.

nection Properties window to remove a bogus 
ad hoc network profile.

Select the profile you want to delete from the list of profiles or Preferred 
Networks, and click the Remove button.
4.
Click OK to save your action and close the window. 
In the Intel PROSet program, you can permanently exclude the name of 
a bogus ad hoc network by selecting any network name in the main control 
window and clicking Properties. When the Properties window opens, click 
Manage Exclusions to open the Exclude List Management window, shown in 
Figure 11-9, where you can add the name of the false signal.

Chapter 11
Unprotected Private Access Points
There’s one more source of accessible Wi-Fi signals that we haven’t discussed 
until now: the ones that leak from wireless home and office networks that 
your neighbors haven’t bothered to protect. It can be awfully tempting to 
grab a connection to one of those networks, but it’s both illegal and unethical, 
even if it is amazingly easy. In many downtown office districts, high-tech 
industrial parks, and residential neighborhoods, a casual visitor can often 
find and log in to half a dozen or more wireless networks within a few blocks. 
If you can detect a network signal, you might be able to connect through 
that network to the Internet, but this is legally considered “theft of service”; 
network managers and law enforcement people frown on it, to say the least.
Of course, nobody with the good sense to read this book would ever 
consider using somebody else’s network or eavesdropping on somebody 
else’s wireless traffic without permission. If you want to try, you’re on your 
own. A few minutes online with a good web search engine can supply a list of 
factory default SSIDs and WEP codes for many popular network access points 
and software for cracking WEP encryption. Many users, especially in home 
networks and small businesses, don’t turn on encryption because it’s “too 
complicated” or “too much trouble” or because nobody told them that it’s 
important (consider yourself advised: It’s important). Many more never 
bother to change their default IDs and passwords. 
This kind of wireless network hacking is sometimes described as 
wardriving, as an extension of the older hackers’ practice of wardialing—
using a modem to dial random telephone numbers in search of computers 
with unprotected dial-in ports.
Some unprotected wireless networks actually welcome public access, so 
there’s a legitimate reason for wardriving (or warwalking with a Wi-Fi enabled 
PDA or smartphone). Even if you don’t actually try to set up a connection to 
a network, it can be instructive (and yes, entertaining) to wander around to see 
what’s out there, but when you click that Connect button on your neighbor’s 
network without permission, you’re breaking the law.
In general, wardriving, or guerilla networking, or whatever you want to 
call it, is one of those activities, like monitoring your neighbors’ cordless tele-
phone conversations, that are sort of fun but not within the limits of polite 
conduct. Yeah, you can argue that anybody who’s dumb enough to operate 
an unprotected wireless network deserves to have other people use it, or 
that the bandwidth is right out there for the taking, but that’s not likely to 
convince the owner of the network (or the nice policeman who comes knock-
ing on your car door while you’re online) that your intentions are entirely 
honorable and that you’re not doing anybody any harm.

Connecting to an Existing Wi-Fi Network
209
If you treat wardriving as a nonintrusive hobby, like those people who take 
their radio scanners to a railroad freight yard and listen to conversations 
between train dispatchers and individual locomotive engineers, or bird-
watchers who keep a book that lists every species they’ve ever seen, then it’s 
probably quite harmless. But when you cross the line and actually establish 
an unauthorized connection, you should understand exactly what you’re 
doing—stealing bandwidth.
It’s not common, but police have actually arrested people for stealing a 
Wi-Fi connection. In 2006, the owner of a Vancouver, Washington coffee shop 
complained about a man who had used her Wi-Fi hot spot from his parked 
truck several times a week for three months without ever buying anything. 
The cops charged him with theft of services. A year later, the BBC reported 
that another man in the English town of Redditch, Worcestershire was cau-
tioned for “dishonestly obtaining communications services with intent to avoid 
payment.” And yet another person was fined £500 in London for “hijacking a 
wireless broadband connection.”
And even if the Network Police don’t come and arrest you for theft of 
service (which is possible but highly unlikely), you’re also risking your own 
data; some unprotected networks are operated by people who hope you will 
use them because they’re logging all your keystrokes and other data, including 
your email password, credit card numbers, and other personal information. 
Of course, when you’re on the other side of this fence, it’s in your interest 
to prevent unauthorized users from connecting through your access point. 
At the very least, you should understand that Wi-Fi networks are not absolutely 
secure, and every access point and network adapter radiates signals that can 
be detected by outsiders. You can take steps to restrict access to your network, 
but you can’t keep the existence of the network a secret from a serious snoop. 
As manager of your own wireless network, this should raise a whole lot of 
questions in your mind. Questions like: Is my network secure? Can somebody 
on the street connect to my network without my knowledge? How do I keep 
those #*@&$! out of my network? For the answers to these and other questions 
about wireless network security, go immediately to the next chapter of this 
book.

W I R E L E S S  N E T W O R K  S E C U R I T Y
Wireless networks are not secure. Let me 
repeat that: Wireless networks are not 
secure. They are safe enough for many users 
most of the time, but it’s just not possible to make 
a network that uses radio to exchange data absolutely 
private.
Wireless networks are a trade-off between security and convenience. 
The obvious benefits of a wireless network connection—fast and easy access 
to the network from a portable computer or an isolated location—come at a 
cost. For most users, the convenience of wireless operation outweighs the 
potential security threats. But just as you lock the doors of your car when you 
park it on the street, you should take similar steps to protect your network 
and your data.
The simple truth is that a wireless network uses radio signals with a well-
defined set of characteristics, so somebody who wants to dedicate enough 
time and effort to monitoring those signals can probably find a way to 
intercept and read the data contained in them. If you send confidential 

212
Chapter 12
information through a wireless link, an eavesdropper can copy it. Credit 
card numbers, account passwords, and other personal information are all 
vulnerable.
An entire catalog of tools for cracking Wi-Fi encryption methods is easy 
to find on the Internet. 3G broadband and WiMAX networks might be more 
secure than Wi-Fi ones (primarily because capturing data from them is 
more difficult), and WPA encryption is better than WEP encryption, but no 
wireless security is perfect. Encryption and other security methods can make 
data a little more difficult to steal, but they don’t provide complete protection 
against a really dedicated snoop. As any policeman will tell you, locks are 
great for keeping out honest people, but serious thieves know how to get 
past them. 
NOTE
Wireless network encryption (such as WPA or WEP) takes place at the data layer of the 
OSI model (discussed in Chapter 1). The encryption is performed on all data that is 
sent across the network. Other encryption methods are also available: VPNs (virtual 
private networks) operate above the TCP layer and can provide additional encryption, 
and SSL (which secures HTTPS website traffic) is specific to the application.
To make things even more dangerous, many network managers and 
home wireless users leave the doors and windows to their networks wide 
open to intruders by failing to use encryption and the other security features 
that are built into every Wi-Fi access point and network node. “Drive-by logins” 
to unprotected private networks are possible in many urban and suburban 
business districts and in a surprising number of residential neighborhoods. 
When Wi-Fi was still a new technology, the San Francisco Chronicle reported 
that a network security expert with a directional antenna mounted on the 
roof of a van in downtown San Francisco could log in to an average of half a 
dozen wireless networks per block. That number would be much greater today. 
A year later, a group of Microsoft employees who ran an “unofficial” test found 
more than 200 unprotected access points in a suburban neighborhood outside 
Seattle. Today, most people have gotten the message about using encryption 
on their home and office networks, but too many of them are still using the 
older WEP encryption system rather than the much more secure WPA 
method. The technical support people at one major telephone company, 
Qwest, were still advising their DSL customers to use WEP encryption as late 
as mid-2007.
If you’re located in a city center or a suburb, you can probably see this 
for yourself. When you use your Wi-Fi control program to scan the networks 
in your neighborhood, you will probably see a list of nearby networks in addi-
tion to your own access point. The control program will also tell you what 
kind of encryption (if any) each network is using. In the example shown in 
Figure 12-1, one network (RedGoldandGreen) is wide open, and four others 
are encrypted; two of the encrypted networks use WPA, and the two that are 
listed as “security-enabled” without an encryption type use WEP. 
Do the math: your access point has a range of 150 feet or more in all 
directions, so the signal probably extends beyond your own property lines 
(or the walls of your apartment or office). A network device in the building

next door or across the street can probably detect your network. And so can 
a laptop or PDA inside a car parked on the street. If you don’t take some pre-
cautions to prevent it, the operator of that device can log in to your LAN, steal 
files from your servers, and tie up your Internet connection with streaming 
videos or multiplayer games. 
It’s important to understand that we’re talking about two different 
kinds of security threats to a wireless network. The first is the danger of an 
outsider connecting to your network without your knowledge or permission; 
the second is the possibility that a dedicated eavesdropper can steal or modify 
data as you send and receive it. Each represents a different potential problem, 
and each requires a different approach to prevention and protection. While 
it’s certainly true that none of the encryption tools currently available can 
provide complete protection, they can make life more difficult for most casual 
intruders. And as long as they’re out there, you might as well use them.
An unsecured wireless network presents many opportunities to an 
attacker. Not only are the network crackers able to monitor any data that 
moves through the network, but they might also be able to modify it.  If, for 
example, there is a vulnerability in your web browser, an attacker can replace 
images as you view them with an image that exploits that vulnerability and 
installs a trojan on your computer, allowing the attacker to steal data stored 
on the computer that you never sent over the wireless network. This type of attack 
might be relatively rare (casual snoopers are unlikely to take the time on the 
chance you have something interesting), but it still presents a serious risk. 
Also, many popular websites encrypt the login page with SSL encryption via 
HTTPS, but they don’t encrypt subsequent pages to reduce the drain on 
processing power—your password might be secure, but any email you read 
via the webmail interface might not be, and attackers might be able to steal 
the cookie (a unique piece of data included with web information) that iden-
tifies your login and access your mailbox directly.

Protecting Your Network and Your Data
As the operator of a Wi-Fi network, what can you do to discourage intruders? 
There are a few techniques that can make things difficult for them. First, you 
can accept the fact that wireless networks are not completely secure and use 
the built-in network security features to slow down would-be intruders; second, 
you can supplement your wireless router’s built-in tools with a hardware or 
software firewall (or both) to isolate the wireless network; and third, you can 
deploy additional encryption such as a VPN to secure traffic to the network.
The security features of the early Wi-Fi protocols (WEP encryption) were 
not adequate to protect data.  The WEP protocol was flawed in several ways. 
The basic encryption method (the RC4 algorithm) was known to have weak-
nesses in certain applications, it required all users to know the key, and 
provided no secure mechanisms for distributing new keys. Most of these 
shortcomings were acknowledged and dismissed as being outside the scope 
of the goal of providing the same protection that a user on a standard wired 
network would receive, but, in fact, the result was that wireless equivalent 
privacy was little better than no protection at all.  Recent attacks (such as 
those performed by the aircrack-ptw tool) have further undermined WEP 
because they’ve often been able to disclose an encryption  key in a matter of 
minutes by analyzing a limited amount of traffic. With these developments, 
WEP should be treated more as a “do not disturb” sign than as a real means 
of protection.
The WPA and WPA2 standards attempt to fix the shortcomings of WEP, 
but they only work when all of the users of a network have modern cards and 
drivers. Most, if not all, cards made in the last few years will support WPA or 
WPA2.
For most of us, the more serious danger is not that people will eavesdrop 
on our messages, but that they will create their own connection to our network 
and either read files stored on computers on the LAN or steal the broadband 
connection to the Internet without our knowledge. However, business net-
works must take extra precautions to protect their (and their customers’) data. 
Several high-profile compromises of customer credit card data in major retail 
chains have been traced to inadequate network protection.
It’s essential to maintain control of your network. Here are some specific 
steps to take:
 Don’t use your access point’s default SSID. Those defaults are well known 
to network crackers.
 Change the SSID to something that doesn’t identify your business or your 
location. If an intruder detects something called BigCorpNet and they 
look around to see BigCorp headquarters across the street, they’ll home 
right in on that network. Same thing for a home network; don’t use your 
family name or the street address or anything else that makes it easy to 
figure out where the signal is coming from.
 Don’t use an SSID that makes your network sound like it contains some 
kind of fascinating content—use a boring name like, oh, network5, or even 
a string of gibberish, such as W24rnQ. If a would-be cracker sees a list of 
nearby networks, yours should look like it’s the least interesting of the lot.

Wireless Network Security
215
 Change your access point’s IP address and password. The factory default 
passwords for most access point configuration tools are easy to find (and 
they’re often the same from one manufacturer to another—hint: don’t 
use admin), so they’re not even good enough to keep out your own users, 
let alone unknown intruders who want to use your network for their own 
benefit. If an outsider gets into the access point’s software, they could lock 
you out of your own network by changing the password and the encryp-
tion key.
 If possible, place your indoor access point in the middle of the building 
rather than close to a window. This will reduce the distance that your net-
work signals will extend beyond your own walls.
 Use WPA encryption rather than WEP. WPA encryption is a lot more 
difficult to break, especially if you use a complex encryption key. 
 Change your encryption keys often. It takes time to sniff encryption keys 
out of a data stream; every time the keys change, the miscreants trying to 
steal your data are forced to start again from scratch. Once or twice every 
month is not too often to change keys in a home network. An office LAN 
should change keys at least once a week. 
 Don’t store your encryption keys in plaintext on the network where they 
are used. This seems obvious, but in a widespread network, it might be 
tempting to distribute them on a private web page or in a text file. Don’t 
do it.
 Don’t use email to distribute encryption keys. Even if you’re not sending 
emails in plaintext, an intruder who has stolen account names and pass-
words will receive the messages with your new codes before your legiti-
mate users get them.
 Add another layer of encryption, such as Kerberos, on top of the encryp-
tion built into the wireless network. See http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www 
and http://www.isi.edu/~brian/security/kerberos.html for downloads and more 
information about Kerberos.
 If it’s practical on your network, turn on the access control feature in your 
access point. Access control restricts network connections to network 
clients with specified MAC addresses. The access point will refuse to 
associate with any adapter whose address is not on the list. This might 
not be practical if you want to allow visitors to use your network, but it’s a 
useful tool in a home or small business network where you know all of 
your potential users. MAC address filtering will not prevent a determined 
attacker from copying the address of an authenticated user, but it could 
provide an additional layer of protection.
 Test your network’s security by trying to find and use your network from 
outside your own building. Take a laptop computer running a sniffer 
program, such as NetStumbler or your network adapter’s control pro-
gram, and start walking away from the building. If you can detect your 
network from a block away, so can an intruder.

216
Chapter 12
 Turn on the security features, but treat the network as if it was wide open 
to public access. Make sure everybody using the network understands that 
they’re using a nonsecure system. 
 Limit file shares to the files that you really want to share; don’t share entire 
drives. Use password protection on every share.
 Use the same firewall and other security tools that you would use on a 
wired network. At best, the wireless portion of your LAN is no more secure 
than the wired part, so you should take all the same precautions.
 Consider using a VPN for added security.
Protecting Your Computer
Network security goes both ways—the network manager doesn’t want unauth-
orized users messing with the network, and individual users don’t want 
anybody to get to their personal files. When you’re logged in to a public 
network, you should take some precautions to prevent anybody else on the 
network from reading your files.
In Windows Vista and Windows XP, there isn’t a central place to turn off 
file shares, so you must turn off each share separately. Follow these steps to 
turn off sharing:
1.
Open the My Computer window.
2.
The icons for some or all of your shared drives and folders might appear 
with a hand “serving” the icon. To turn off sharing, right-click the icon 
and choose Sharing and Security from the menu.
3.
Turn off the Share this folder on the network option.
4.
Click the OK button to close the dialog box. When the My Computer 
window appears, the sharing hand will no longer be under the name of 
the folder or drive letter.
5.
Repeat the process for every shared folder or file. Don’t forget the 
Shared Documents folder.
When you get back to your own office or home network, you’ll have to 
reverse the procedure to start sharing your files again.
What about the danger of somebody grabbing your data as it passes 
through the radio link? It can be done, even if you’re using encryption. 
You have to assume that any data transmitted through a wireless network is 
not secure. A determined eavesdropper with the right equipment and soft-
ware can copy your data packets as they move through the air. It’s possible, 
but it’s not likely unless you are a target of government surveillance or 
industrial espionage.
The only way to be absolutely sure that nobody is monitoring your wireless 
network is to stop using it. But it’s even easier to monitor the cordless phone 
in your kitchen. In general, you can assume that a connection through a 
public network is no more or less secure than a link to your own network. 
If somebody is serious about stealing your network packets, they will probably 
find a way to do it. 

Wireless Network Security
217
Wi-Fi Security Tools
The security tools in the Wi-Fi specifications aren’t perfect, but they’re better 
than nothing. Even if you choose not to use them, it’s essential to understand 
what they are and how they work, if only to turn them off.
Network Name (SSID)
As you learned in Chapter 3, every wireless network has a name. In a network 
with just one access point, the name is the basic service set ID (BSSID). When 
the network has more than one access point, the name becomes the extended 
service set ID (ESSID), but your computer’s control program displays both 
types in the same list. The generic designation for all network names is the 
SSID, which is the term you will see most often in wireless access point and 
client configuration utility programs. 
When you configure the access points for a network, you must specify the 
SSID for that network. Every access point and network client in a network must 
use the same SSID. 
When a network client detects two or more access points with the same 
SSID, it assumes that they are all part of the same network (even if the access 
points are operating on different radio channels), and it associates with the 
access point that provides the strongest or cleanest signal. If that signal deterio-
rates due to interference or fading, the client will try to shift to another access 
point on what it thinks is the same network. This transfer is called a hand off.
If two different networks with overlapping signals have the same name, 
a client will assume that they’re both parts of a single network, and it might 
try to perform a hand off from one network to the other. From the user’s point 
of view, this misdirected hand off will look as if the network has completely 
dropped its connection. Therefore, every wireless network that could possibly 
overlap with another network must have a unique SSID. 
The exceptions to the unique SSID rule are public and community 
networks that only provide access to the Internet but not to other computers 
or other devices on a LAN. Those networks often have a common SSID, so 
subscribers can detect and connect to them from more than one location. In 
other words, if you have an Internet access account at your local coffee shop, 
you might find and use exactly the same SSID when you visit another shop 
owned by the same company. 
A network’s SSID provides a very limited form of access control because 
it’s necessary to specify the SSID when you set up a wireless connection. The 
SSID option in an access point is always a text field that will accept any name 
you care to assign, but many network configuration programs (including the 
wireless network tools in Windows XP and those supplied with several major 
brands of network adapters) automatically detect and display the SSIDs of 
every active network within their signal range. 
It’s not always necessary to know the SSID of a network before you try to 
connect; the configuration utility (or a network monitor or sniffer program 
like NetStumbler) will show you the names of every nearby network in a list 
or a menu (the exceptions are networks in which the Broadcast SSID feature 

218
Chapter 12
has been turned off). For example, Figure 12-2 shows the result of a 
NetStumbler scan at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, where Wayport served the 
passenger terminal and MobileStar provided coverage in the American 
Airlines VIP club. 
Figure 12-2: NetStumbler and many configuration utilities display the SSIDs of every 
nearby wireless network.
WARNING 
Every access point comes with a default SSID setting. These defaults are well known 
and documented within the community of network snoops (see, for example, the lists 
of access points and defaults compiled by members of SeattleWireless.net at http://
seattlewireless.net/arlan/ssid_defaults-1.0.5.txt). Obviously, the defaults should 
never be used in any active network. Make sure you change the access point’s admin-
istrative login and password while you’re at it. 
Normally, most Wi-Fi access points send out beacon signals that broadcast 
the network’s SSID. When a network adapter performs a radio scan, it detects 
those beacon signals and displays a list of nearby SSIDs in its control program.
However, it’s possible to disable the SSID broadcast so the network doesn’t 
show up on most control program scans. To connect a computer to a network 
whose name is not visible, you must instruct your control program to search 
for the relevant SSID.
Nonbroadcast SSIDs are not completely invisible. A sniffer program (such 
as NetStumbler) can still detect it and display the SSID, and every time a user 
connects to the network, the network adapter sends the SSID in a packet that 
can easily be sniffed. Disabling the SSID broadcast might, in some cases, make 
it easier for an intruder to later attack the laptop of one of your users (this is 
a more serious issue for businesses or corporate network administrators than 
for people running home networks). Because the laptop cannot know if the 
hidden network is available, it must constantly probe for it, announcing its 

Wireless Network Security
219
presence and giving an attacker much of the information needed to spoof the 
hidden network. Because a hidden network must be in a laptop’s Preferred 
Networks list, it will automatically connect to the spoofed network.
WEP Encryption
WEP encryption is an option in every Wi-Fi system, so it’s important to know 
how it works, even if you choose not to use it. As the name suggests, the 
original intent of the wired equivalent privacy (WEP) protocol was to provide 
a level of security on wireless networks that was comparable to that of a wired 
network. That was the goal, but a network that depends on WEP encryption 
is almost as vulnerable to intrusion as a network with no protection at all. It 
will keep out the casual snoops (and your freeloading neighbors, if they’re 
not particularly adept at cracking encryption), but it’s not particularly effective 
against a dedicated intruder. The more recent WPA encryption is always the 
better choice.
WEP encryption is intended to serve three functions: it prevents unauth-
orized access to the network, it performs an integrity check on each packet, 
and it protects the data from eavesdroppers. WEP uses a secret encryption 
key to encode data packets before a network client or an access point transmits 
them, and it uses the same key to decode the packets after they have been 
received. The original standard used shared authentication, in which the 
access point sends a challenge packet that a client must encrypt with the 
proper WEP key and send back. However, this technique opens a significant 
vulnerability by allowing a snooper to watch both parts of the exchange and 
figure out the key.  The “open” authentication method, which should be 
used by any network using WEP (not that any network should use it), simply 
discards packets that cannot be decrypted by the network’s WEP key.
Therefore, the WEP settings must be exactly the same on every access 
point and client adapter in the network. This sounds simple enough, but it 
gets confusing because manufacturers use different methods to identify the 
size and format of a WEP key. The functions don’t change from one brand to 
another, but identical settings don’t always have identical descriptions.
How Many Bits in Your Encryption Key?
A WEP key can have either 64 bits or 128 bits. Although 128-bit keys are 
more difficult to crack (but they are still pretty insecure), they also increase the 
amount of time needed to transmit each packet. However, confusion arises 
because a 40-bit WEP key is the same as a 64-bit WEP key, and a 104-bit key is 
the same as a 128-bit key. The standard 64-bit WEP key is a string that includes 
an internally generated 24-bit initialization vector and a 40-bit secret key 
assigned by the network manager. Some manufacturers’ specifications and 
configuration programs call this 64-bit encryption, but others describe it as 
40-bit encryption. Either way, the encryption scheme is the same, so an adapter 
that uses 40-bit encryption is fully compatible with an access point or another 
adapter that uses 64-bit encryption.

220
Chapter 12
Many network adapters and access points also include a strong encryption 
option that uses a 128-bit key. Devices that support strong encryption are 
downward compatible with 64-bit encryption, but it’s not automatic, so all of 
the devices on a mixed network of 128-bit and 64-bit devices will operate at 
64 bits. If your access point and all of your adapters accept 128-bit encryption, 
use a 128-bit key. But if you want your network to be compatible with adapters 
and access points that only recognize 64-bit encryption, configure the entire 
network to use 64-bit keys.
In practice, the choice of 64- or 128-bit WEP encryption doesn’t make 
much difference. Tools are easily available that can crack both types, although 
cracking a 128-bit key might take a bit longer. 
Is Your Key ASCII or Hex?
The length of the key is not the only confusing thing about setting WEP 
encryption. Some programs request the key as a string of ASCII characters, 
but many others want the key in hexadecimal (hex) numbers. Still others 
can generate the key from an optional passphrase. 
Each ASCII character has 8 bits, so a 40-bit (or 64-bit) WEP key contains 
5 characters, and a 104-bit (or 128-bit) key has 13 characters. In hex, each 
character uses 4 bits, so a 40-bit key has 10 hex characters, and a 128-bit key 
has 26 characters. In Figure 12-3, the Wireless Setting screen for a D-Link 
access point, the 40-bit Shared Key Security field uses hex characters, so it 
has space for 10 characters. The D-Link program runs all 10 characters 
together in a single string, but some others split them into 5 sets of 2 digits 
or 2 sets of 5. The key looks the same to the computer either way, but it’s 
easier to copy the string when it’s broken apart. 
Figure 12-3: The configuration utility for a D-Link access point accepts WEP keys 
in hex format.

Wireless Network Security
221
A passphrase is a string of text that the adapters and access points auto-
matically convert to a string of hex characters. Because humans can generally 
remember actual words or phrases more easily than hex gibberish, a pass-
phrase can be easier to distribute than a hex string. However, a passphrase is 
only useful when all the adapters and access points in a network come from 
the same manufacturer.
What Are the Options?
Like just about everything else in a Wi-Fi configuration utility, the names 
of the encryption options are not consistent from one program to the next. 
Some use a straightforward set of options such as “enable WEP (or WPA) 
encryption,” but others use technical language taken from the formal 802.11 
specification. 
Some access points also offer an optional shared key authentication 
option that uses encryption when a network client has the key, but uses 
unencrypted data with other network nodes.
Mixing Hex and ASCII Keys
Setting up a mixed network becomes more complicated when some 
network nodes use hex only and others require ASCII keys. If that’s the 
situation in your network, you will want to follow these rules for setting the 
encryption keys:
 Convert all your ASCII keys to hex. If a configuration program demands 
an ASCII key, enter the characters 0x (zero followed by lowercase letter x), 
followed by the hex string. If you’re using Apple’s AirPort software, 
you’ll have to enter a dollar sign ($) at the beginning of a hex key.
 Make sure all your encryption keys have exactly the right number of 
characters.
 If all else fails, read the security sections of the manuals for your network 
adapters and access points. It’s possible that one or more of the devices 
in your network has some obscure proprietary feature that you don’t 
know about.
Is WEP Secure Enough To Use?
Several academic computer scientists have published reports about WEP 
encryption that argue against trusting it to protect confidential data. They all 
point to serious flaws in the cryptographic theory and practice that were used 
to define the WEP encryption algorithms. These experts are unanimous in 
their recommendations: If you use an 802.11 wireless network, you cannot 
rely on WEP for security; you should employ WPA to protect your networks.
A group at the University of California, Berkeley has identified numerous 
flaws in the WEP algorithm that make it vulnerable to at least four different 
kinds of attacks:
 Passive attacks that use statistical analysis to decrypt data
 Active attacks that construct encrypted packets to mislead the access 
point into accepting false commands

222
Chapter 12
 Attacks that analyze encrypted packets to construct a dictionary that can 
be used to automatically decrypt data in real time
 Attacks that alter packet headers to divert data to a destination controlled 
by the attacker
The Berkeley report, which you can read online at http://www.isaac
.cs.berkeley.edu/isaac/wep-faq.html, concludes with an unequivocal statement: 
“Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) isn’t. The protocol’s problems are a 
result of misunderstanding of some cryptographic primitives and therefore 
combining them in insecure ways.”
Researchers at Rice University and AT&T Labs published a description 
of their attack against WEP encrypted networks (http://www.securitytechnet
.com/resource/hot-topic/wlan/wep_attack.pdf) that led them to a similar opinion: 
“802.11 WEP is totally insecure.” They were able to order and receive the 
necessary hardware, set up a network for testing, design their attack tool, 
and successfully capture a 128-bit WEP key in less than a week.
Both the Berkeley and the AT&T Labs reports are written by and for 
technical experts who have a background in cryptography. Their conclusions 
are clear, but their methods assume that an intruder has some serious tech-
nical knowledge. However, it doesn’t take a network expert to crack WEP 
encryption; tools for less sophisticated code breakers are also easy to find. 
Both AirSnort (from the Shmoo Group, http://airsnort.shmoo.com) and 
WEPCrack (http://sourceforge.net/projects/wepcrack) are Linux programs that 
monitor wireless network signals and exploit the weaknesses in the WEP 
algorithm to extract the encryption key. There are dozens of others. Just a 
few minutes with Google or any other Internet search tool is all it takes to 
find WEP cracking tools and detailed instructions for using them.
Recently announced attacks against WEP, implemented in tools such as 
aircrack-ptw, can break WEP keys in a matter of minutes using a very limited 
amount of data—sometimes as little as 10 megabytes of data gathered from a 
single network user and a few seconds of processing on a modern laptop.
Bottom line: Go ahead and encrypt your network data, but use WPA 
rather than WEP if you possibly can. Encrypted data is more secure than 
plaintext transmission, and it takes time to crack a WEP key, so WEP does 
add another (extremely weak) layer of security, especially if you change keys 
frequently. WEP encryption might not do much to protect you against serious 
attackers, but it will probably keep out the casual network eavesdropper who 
stumbles onto your network from across the street and the drive-by network 
snoop. It’s a lot easier to break into an unencrypted network (and there are 
still plenty of them out there), so a cracker who detects your encrypted signal 
will probably move on to a target with less protection.
WPA Encryption
WPA encryption was developed as a partial solution to the security problems 
that make WEP encryption less than totally secure. WPA is much safer than 
WEP, but cracking WPA is still possible.

Wireless Network Security
223
WPA is more secure because it uses a method called Temporal Key Integrity 
Protocol (TKIP) to automatically change the encryption key after a specified 
period of time or after the system exchanges a specific number of packets. 
Because WPA changes the key frequently, it’s a lot more difficult for a cracker 
to gather enough information to decipher its encryption code.
In large networks, WPA uses an authentication server to verify the identity 
of each network user. The server uses Remote Authentication Dial-in User 
Service (RADIUS) and the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) to 
exchange encryption keys with the computers and other devices that are 
connected to the wireless network.
In home networks and smaller business networks that don’t have a server, 
a method called pre-shared key (PSK) mode uses a passphrase stored in the 
access point in place of the authentication server. To connect to the network, 
users must enter the same passphrase on their computers or other network 
devices (or set their devices to automatically enter the passphrase). When 
you set up WPA encryption, you must specify whether the network uses a 
server or PSK mode.
Any access point and network adapter that supports 802.11g or 802.11n 
should also recognize WPA encryption. If you’re using an older 802.11b or 
802.11a access point, it might still be possible to add WPA encryption by 
installing the latest versions of firmware and drivers. Look in the support or 
downloads section of the manufacturer’s website for free upgrade instructions 
and software.
PSK Passphrases 
A WPA-PSK passphrase can be a string of either 8 to 63 ASCII characters or 
64 hexadecimal digits. The passphrase that you enter into a network device 
must be exactly the same as the one stored in the access point. Obviously, 
typing 64 digits correctly is not something that you want to do frequently, so 
the ASCII alternative is the better choice for most users. For optimal secu-
rity, the ASCII passphrase you assign to your network should be a random 
mixture of at least 20 characters including letters (capitals and lower case), 
numbers, and punctuation marks. 
A PSK network uses the passphrase to set up the initial connection 
between a client (such as a computer or PDA) and the access point. After the 
connection is in place, the TKIP assigns new encryption keys to every packet 
or group of packets.
The PSK combines with your network SSID to calculate the final key 
value. It is important to choose a unique SSID and a strong passphrase. 
Attackers can build large tables of SSID and PSK pairs for common network 
names and dictionary words, performing weeks of calculation once with the 
payoff of nearly instantly determining the key of any network that matches 
that pair of values. Choosing strong passphrases and unique SSIDs can 
mitigate this type of attack.

configuration software will ask if you want to use encryption, and if so, whether 
you want WEP or WPA encryption. Unless you’re planning to run an open-
access network, you should choose WPA. 
In many cases, the access point will offer two or more types of WPA 
encryption. If your network includes a RADIUS server, choose EAP. If the 
network has no encryption server, use the WPA-TKIP option.
For a network user, providing a WPA key is just as easy as providing a 
WEP key. Most network adapters made in the last few years automatically 
recognize the type of encryption embedded in each Wi-Fi signal that they 
detect, so the control program might ask for an encryption key without 
specifying whether it’s a WEP key or a WPA key. 
WPA Security
It was probably inevitable that somebody would take the added security 
features in WPA encryption as a challenge and develop a WPA cracking tool. 
Several such tools are out there, so WPA does not provide the impenetrable 
protection that some of its proponents might want you to believe. In partic-
ular, programs called coWPAtty and Aircrack-ng both use dictionary attacks on 
WPA-TKIP networks to try thousands or millions of possible keys until it finds 
the correct ones. Because each additional letter, number, or other character 
in a key increases the key’s complexity, a long key takes much longer to crack 
than a short one. This kind of cracking technique takes time because the 
programs can only try about 50 different encryption keys per second, but 
eventually, they will find the right passphrase and connect to the target 
network. 
Fortunately, neither of these programs or any of the others aimed at 
cracking WPA encryption are easy to use, and they can take a lot of time to 
crack a network, so successful attacks on WPA are not particularly common. 
It might not be possible or practical to completely protect yourself against 
attacks, but a long passphrase that includes random numbers and punctuation 
marks in odd places is usually a better choice than a string of words or num-
bers alone. In other words, something like hdt%mzx33wolf$fgilxxq&#smedbxor 
is a better passphrase than nostarchpressbooks.
Access Control (MAC Authentication)
Most access points include an option that permits the network manager to 
restrict access to a specific list of client adapters. If a network device with a 
MAC address that does not appear on the list of authorized users tries to 
connect, the access point will not accept the request to associate with the 
network. This can keep intruders from connecting to a wireless LAN, but it 
forces the network administrator to keep a complete list of users’ adapters 
and their MAC addresses. Every time a new user wants to join the network, and 
every time an established user swaps adapters or gets a new laptop, PDA, or 
other device with a built-in adapter, the network manager must add one 

Wireless Network Security
225
more MAC address to the list. This is probably manageable in a home or 
small office network, but it could be a major undertaking for a larger corpo-
rate or campus-wide system, if it’s practical at all.
MAC authentication does not provide unbreakable protection against 
unauthorized users because a determined cracker could monitor radio 
signals from approved users, intercept their adapters’ MAC addresses, and 
load an approved address onto a different adapter. But combined with encryp-
tion and other security tools, authentication adds one more impediment in 
the path of a network cracker. 
Every access point configuration utility uses a different format for its access 
lists. The manual and online documentation supplied with your access point 
should provide detailed instructions for creating and maintaining an access 
control list.
The Wi-Fi standards do not specify a maximum size for an access point’s 
access control list, so the numbers are all over the map. Some access points 
limit the list to a few dozen entries, but others, such as the Proxim Harmony 
AP Controller, will support as many as 10,000 separate addresses. Still others 
accept an unlimited number. If you plan to use a list of addresses to control 
access to your network, make sure your access point will work with a large 
enough list to support all of your users, with enough expansion space for 
future growth. As a rule of thumb, the access point should accept at least 
twice as many MAC addresses as the number of users on your network today.
Some access points also include a MAC address exclusion feature that 
allows the network manager to block one or more MAC addresses from access 
to the network. 
Virtual Private Networks
Virtual private networks can add one more layer of useful security by isolating 
the connection between network nodes from other network traffic. A VPN 
is an encrypted transmission channel that connects two network endpoints 
through a “data tunnel.” Many network security experts recommend a VPN 
as an effective way to protect a wireless network from eavesdroppers and 
unauthorized users. You can find more detailed information about setting 
up and using a VPN in Chapter 15.
Authentication: The 802.1x Standard
Because of the security gaps in the WEP encryption specification, many 
wireless network equipment manufacturers and software developers have 
adopted yet another IEEE standard, 802.1x, to add another layer of security 
to their networks. The 802.1x standard defines a structure that can support 
several additional forms of authentication, including certificates, smart 
cards, and one-time passwords, all of which offer more protection than the 
access control built into 802.11. In 802.11 networks, a technique called the 
Robust Security Network builds upon the 802.1x framework to restrict network 
access to authorized devices.

226
Chapter 12
Most end users need to know two things about 802.1x: First, it’s built 
into some (but not all) Wi-Fi hardware and software, including the wireless 
configuration utility supplied with Windows XP and many recent access 
point products, so it can provide one more potential layer of security; and 
second, it has serious flaws that a dedicated network cracker can exploit to 
break into a wireless network. The ugly technical details are in an analysis 
prepared by two researchers at the University of Maryland, available online at 
http://www.cs.umd.edu/~waa/1x.pdf.
Firewalls
If you accept the idea that encryption and 802.1x do not provide adequate 
protection for a wireless LAN, the next logical step is to find another way to 
keep intruders out of your network. You also need a firewall.
A firewall is a proxy server that filters all the data that passes through it 
on the way to or from a network, based on a set of rules established by the 
network manager. For example, a firewall might reject data from an unknown 
source or files that match a particular source (such as a virus). Or it might 
pass all data moving from the LAN to the Internet, but only allow certain types 
of data from the Internet. The most common use of a firewall in a LAN is at 
the gateway to the Internet, as shown in Figure 12-4. The firewall monitors all 
inbound and outbound data between the computers on the local network 
on one side and the Internet on the other. This kind of firewall is intended 
to protect the computers on the LAN from unauthorized access from the 
Internet.

In a wireless network, a firewall can also be placed at the gateway between 
the wireless access points and the wired network. This firewall isolates the 
wireless portion of the network from the wired LAN, so intruders who have 
connected their computers to the network without permission can’t use 
the wireless connection to reach the Internet or the wired part of the LAN. 
Figure 12-5 shows the location of a firewall in a wireless network.
Figure 12-5: A firewall in a wireless LAN can act as a protected 
gateway to the wired portion of the same network.
Keep Wireless Intruders at Bay
Most people who try to tap into a wireless network don’t care about the other 
computers on the local network; they’re looking for free high-speed access to 
the Internet. If they can’t use your network to download files or connect to 
their favorite web pages, they’ll probably move on to find some other unpro-
tected wireless hot spot. That doesn’t mean you should store confidential 
data in file shares on unprotected computers, but if you can limit or restrict 
access to the Internet, it will make your wireless network a lot less attractive to 
intruders.

Chapter 12
A firewall in a wireless network can perform several functions: It acts as a 
gateway router between the wireless network and a wired LAN or a direct 
connection to the Internet, blocking all traffic moving from the wireless side 
to the wired network that doesn’t come from an authenticated user, but it 
does not interfere with commands, messages, and file transfers from trusted 
users. Therefore, a  legitimate user can connect to network nodes on the 
wired part of a mixed LAN or onto the Internet, but an intruder would be 
cut off at the firewall.
Because authorized users and intruders are both on the unprotected side 
of the firewall, it does not isolate wireless nodes from one another. An intruder 
can still gain access to another computer on the same wireless network and 
read shared files, so it’s a good idea to turn off file sharing in any computer 
connected to a wireless network.
A firewall for a wireless network should use some kind of authentication 
to allow legitimate users through the gateway, but it should reject everybody 
else. If the access control based on MAC addresses is built into Wi-Fi networks, 
and the added authentication in 802.1x is not adequate, then an outboard 
firewall should require each user to enter a login and password before they 
can connect to the Internet.
If your wireless network includes computers running more than one 
operating system, your firewall must use a login tool that works on any 
platform. The easiest way to accomplish this is with a web-based authen-
tication server, such as the one included in the Apache webserver (http://
httpd.apache.org).
The Apache webserver is available as a Unix application that can run on 
an old, slow computer with an early Pentium, or even a 486 CPU, so it’s often 
possible to recycle an old junker that is no longer in daily service and use it 
as a firewall. Both the Apache application and a Unix operating system are 
available as open source software, so it ought to be possible to build an Apache 
firewall at extremely low cost.
If you prefer to use Windows rather than Unix, or if you don’t want to 
assemble your own firewall, you have several options. You can use the Windows 
version of Apache, or you can use a commercial utility such as the ones listed 
at http://www.thegild.com/firewall. 
Isolate Your Network from the Internet
Attacks on a wireless LAN don’t all come through the air. A wireless network 
also requires the same kind of firewall protection against attacks from the 
Internet as every other network. Many access points include configurable 
firewall features, but if yours does not, the network should include one or 
more of these firewalls:
 A firewall program on each computer
 A separate router or a dedicated computer acting as a network firewall

Wireless Network Security
229
Client firewall programs provide another line of defense against attacks 
through the Internet from outside your own network. Some of these attacks 
come from miscreants who are looking for a way to read your files and other 
resources that you don’t want the entire world to see. Others might want to 
use your computer as a relay point for spam or attempts to break into some 
other computer halfway around the world in order to make the real source 
more difficult to identify. Still others spread viruses or use Really Unpleasant 
programs that take over control of a PC and display threatening messages. 
An unprotected system with a lot of unused storage space can be an attractive 
target for hackers who want to distribute pirated software, music, or video files 
(you don’t think they store that stuff on their own computers, do you?).
The number of such idiots and creeps out on the Internet is surprisingly 
large; if you install a firewall that notifies you when an outside computer tries 
to connect to your network, you will probably see several break-in attempts 
every day.
Access Points with Firewalls
The easiest firewall to use with a wireless network is one that’s built into an 
access point, such as the D-Link DI-524 Wireless Router (shown in Figure 12-6) 
and similar products from other manufacturers. This model combines the 
functions of a wireless access point with a broadband router and an Ethernet 
switch, so it supports both wired and wireless network clients.

Figure 12-6: The D-Link DI-524 Wireless Broadband Router 
contains configurable firewall firmware.
As you know, a network router provides translation services between the 
numeric IP address that identifies the LAN to the Internet and the internal 
IP addresses that identify individual computers within the local network. The 
firewall normally blocks all incoming requests for data to network hosts, but 
this creates problems when you want to use one or more of the computers on 

230
Chapter 12
the local network as fileservers. So the firewall includes a virtual server that 
redirects certain types of requests to the appropriate computer inside the 
firewall.
Each request for connection to a server includes a specific port number 
that identifies the type of server. For example, webservers operate on port 80, 
and FTP servers use port 21, so those port numbers are part of the request for 
access. To accept requests for access to a server, you must instruct the firewall’s 
Network Address Translation (NAT) function to forward those requests to a 
specific computer within the LAN. In Figure 12-7, the virtual server is con-
figured to use the computer with the local IP address 192.168.0.177 as a 
webserver and 192.168.0.164 as an FTP fileserver. Table 12-1 lists the most 
common service port numbers.
Figure 12-7: The D-Link access point directs requests for access to fileservers to 
specific computers within the network.
Hundreds of other port numbers have been assigned, but you will never 
see most of them in actual use. The official list of port assignments is online 
at http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers. 
NAT translation assumes that the IP addresses of each virtual server don’t 
change from one request to the next. A webserver on 192.168.0.23 today 
won’t migrate to 192.168.0.47 next week. That’s generally not a problem on 
a wired network, but in a wireless setting where network clients join and depart 
the network all the time, the DHCP server automatically assigns the next 
available address to each new client. If one of those clients is also the home 
of one of the network’s service ports, the NAT probably won’t find it. This 
is not a common problem because most networks don’t use portable com-
puters as servers, but it can happen. The solution is either to turn off the 
DHCP server and assign a permanent IP address to each client or move 
the service port to a computer than has a wired connection to the network 

Wireless Network Security
231
and assign a fixed IP address with a number at the high end of the DHCP 
range (for example, if the range of addresses assigned by the DHCP is from 
192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.200, set the server’s address as 192.168.1.199).
Firewall Software
A wireless gateway firewall at the interface between the access point and the 
wired part of your LAN will keep intruders from using your network to reach 
the Internet, and a firewall at the Internet connection will turn away attempts 
to connect to your network from the Internet, but there’s still one more form 
of protection necessary in a wireless network. If somebody gains access to 
your wireless LAN without permission, you want to keep him out of the other 
legitimate computers on the same network, so you need to install a client 
firewall program on each network node.
Client firewalls perform the same functions at a computer’s network 
interface that a LAN or enterprise firewall performs for the entire network; 
it detects attempts to connect to TCP service ports and rejects them unless 
they match one or more of the firewall program’s configuration settings.
Several good firewall products are available as shareware, and others 
are free to noncommercial users. It’s easy to try them on your own system and 
choose the one you like best. There’s also a firewall built into Windows XP and 
Windows Vista that is adequate for most home and small-business networks.

Unix and Linux users also have plenty of firewall options. Most of them 
were written for use on stand-alone firewall computers that are commonly 
used as network gateways, but they could be equally appropriate as protection 
for individual network clients.
In Linux, the iptables firewall is part of the kernel. It is well documented 
at http://www.netfilter.org/projects/iptables/index.html. Portsentry is a port scan 
detection tool that is integrated into several widely used Linux distributions. 
It’s available for download from http://linux.cudeso.be/linuxdoc/portsentry.php.
IP Filter is a software package that provides firewall services to FreeBSD 
and NetBSD systems. The official IP Filter website is http://coombs.anu.edu
.au/~avalon, and there’s an excellent HOWTO document at http://www
.obfuscation.org/ipf/ipf-howto.txt. The program can deny or permit any packet 
from passing through the firewall, and it can filter by net mask or host address, 
establish service port restrictions, and provide NAT translation services.
OpenBSD, FreeBSD, and NetBSD can all use the PF, or Packet Filter, 
facility to perform firewalling functions. More information is available at 
http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf.
NetBSD/i386 Firewall is another free Unix firewall. It will operate 
on any PC with a 486 or later CPU and uses as little as 8MB of memory. The 
NetBSD/i386 Firewall Project home page is http://www.dubbele.com.
Turn Off DHCP
The DHCP server in an access point or router automatically assigns a numeric 
IP address to each computer that is connected to the network. Therefore, it 
will also assign an IP address to an unauthorized computer that makes it 
through your encryption and other security tools. 
On the other hand, if your network uses fixed IP addresses for each 
computer, and the access point or router is set to only recognize those 
particular addresses, the access point or router will reject a connection 
attempt unless the computer or other device is set to the correct address. 
The most common ranges of IP addresses for a LAN are: 
 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.255 
 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255 
If you use a less common range of fixed IP addresses, it will be more 
difficult for an outsider to guess a correct address. Several other ranges are 
also reserved for LANs, including:
 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
 172.16.0.0 to 176.31.255.255
 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
 169.254.0.0 to 169.254.25.255

Wireless Network Security
233
If, for example, you have 10 computers on your home network, you 
could set the range of acceptable IP addresses to 172.16.234.20 through 
172.16.234.40 and assign a static IP address within that range to each 
computer.
Of course, this is not as practical for a public network where many users 
come and go, but it’s useful in a home network in which you control all the 
network nodes. 
Don’t confuse using static IP addresses with MAC authentication. Both 
methods restrict access to a specific set of computers, but they use different 
parts of the connection process to accomplish that goal. While both offer an 
additional layer of security, they are imperfect. Neither method should be 
your only means of securing your network.
Turn Off the Power
An intruder can’t break into your wireless network if the access point and all 
of your computers are turned off. If you and your family, or the people in your 
office are not using your Wi-Fi network, there’s usually no reason to let any-
body else use it, especially without your permission or knowledge. When you 
leave home for a few days, or even a few hours, or when you are done with 
your computers for the night, you can shut down your wireless network by 
disconnecting the power connector on the access point or using a power 
strip to turn off power to all of your computers and peripheral devices, includ-
ing the network access point. When you want to use the computer and the 
network again, reconnect the power connector or turn on the power strip. 
Remember to wait until the lights on your DSL or cable modem and wireless 
access point stop flashing before you try to use the network.
This technique has the added benefit of reducing the amount of electric 
power the access point and other devices consume. Neither the access point 
nor any of your other equipment uses more than a watt or two when they’re 
idle, but if you reduce that number to zero, you might see a small reduction 
in your monthly electric bill. 
Physical Security
Up until now, we’ve been talking about keeping electronic intruders out 
of your wireless network. It’s easy enough to gain access to a network using 
off-the-shelf equipment that hasn’t already been configured for that network; 
it’s even easier when the intruder has stolen a laptop from an authorized 
user. Losing a laptop computer to a thief is bad enough. Letting the thief use 
a stolen computer to log in to a network is even worse. As a network operator, 
you should remind your users that their portables are attractive targets for 
thieves, and offer some guidelines for protecting them. As a user yourself, 
you should follow the same precautions.

234
Chapter 12
The first rule is simple: Don’t forget that you’re carrying a computer. It 
seems obvious, but London taxi drivers found about 2,900 laptops (and 62,000 
mobile phones!) left in their cabs during a six-month period. Uncounted 
others have been abandoned in airplanes, hotel rooms, commuter trains, 
and conference centers. It doesn’t take a thief to separate a computer from 
its owner if the owner just walks away.
Don’t advertise the fact that you’re carrying a computer. Those nylon bags 
that say IBM or COMPAQ on the side in great big letters might be handy, but 
they’re not as safe as an ordinary briefcase or a conservative carrier bag.
Next, keep your laptop in your hands or on your shoulder whenever it’s 
not locked in a closet or storage locker. Look away for a minute, and a skilled 
thief can make it disappear. Airport terminals, railway stations, and hotel 
lobbies are common places for quick snatch-and-grabs. If you have to use the 
computer in a public space, use a lock with a steel cable to secure it to an 
immovable object.
Don’t leave an unsecured laptop computer in an office overnight.
Watch out for airport scanners. Make sure you’re able to retrieve the 
computer as soon as it comes off the conveyor belt. Two people working 
together can do a fine job of delaying you and grabbing the computer before 
you can get to it. If somebody tries to steal your computer from a security 
check, make some noise and get help from the security guards.
Make sure your computers and loose components like PC Cards have 
property labels both inside and out. Engrave your name or company name 
and telephone number on network interface cards and other removable parts. 
A company called Security Tracking of Office Property (http://www.stoptheft
.com) offers registered security plate labels with a cyanoacrylate adhesive that 
requires something like 800 pounds of pressure to remove and an indelible 
chemical tattoo marked “Stolen Property” that appears if somebody removes 
the label. 
If you can convince your users to use alarm devices on their computers, 
that might improve the chances of recovering them. Caveo Anti-Theft PC 
Cards (http://www.caveo.com/products/anti-theft.htm) are motion detectors that 
analyze a computer’s motion and both sound a loud alarm and prevent 
access to the computer’s operating system when the computer has been 
carried beyond a preset distance. Similar alarm products are available from 
other manufacturers.
Tracking software is another approach to laptop security. Subscription ser-
vices such as LoJack for Laptops (http://www.lojackforlaptops.com), Computrace 
(http://www.absolute.com), CyberAngel (http://thecyberangel.com), and XTool 
Laptop Tracker (http://www.stealthsignal.com) use the computer’s commu-
nications software to send a “Here I am” signal back to the service. When a 
subscriber reports that a computer has been stolen, the service uses the 
locator signal to assist law enforcement authorities in finding it.
Finally, keep a list of models and serial numbers separately from the 
devices themselves. You’ll need that information for your police report and 
your insurance claim.

Wireless Network Security
235
When you discover that one of the computers that uses your wireless 
network has been lost or stolen, it’s essential to protect the rest of the network. 
If possible, change the network’s passwords and encryption keys as soon as 
you can. If your network uses a list of MAC addresses to control access, remove 
the stolen device’s MAC address from the list of authorized connections. Some 
tools (such as ArpWatch for Linux) provide a mechanism for watching for 
specific MAC addresses and raising an alert when it detects one of those 
addresses.
Sharing Your Network with the World
If you use your wireless network to provide public access to the Internet to 
your neighborhood or campus, or if you want to allow customers and other 
visitors to connect to your wireless net, you won’t want to use encryption or 
other security tools to limit access to known users, but you should still give 
some thought to security. Just because you want to give people a direct 
connection to the Internet, that doesn’t mean you want to let them poke 
around in the other computers connected to your network, so it’s necessary 
to isolate the wireless access points from the rest of the network.
If all of the local nodes on your LAN are connected through wires, the 
best approach is to place a firewall between the wireless access point and the 
wired LAN that only allows the access point (and the computers connected 
to it through wireless links) to communicate with the Internet but not with 
any local nodes on the wired LAN, as shown in Figure 12-8. 
Figure 12-8: The firewall isolates the wireless segment from the rest of the network.
If one or more of your in-house computers uses wireless connections, 
you must protect them from access by outsiders who are using the public 
portion of your network. There are several ways to do that: Figure 12-9

shows a wireless network with a software firewall in each in-house computer; 
Figure 12-10 shows a system that uses two separate wireless networks with 
different SSIDs that are both connected to the same Internet hookup. In 
general, the basic rule is to use one or more firewalls to isolate the public 
portion of your network from the computers that you don’t want open to 
everybody in the world.

Some Final Thoughts About Wi-Fi Security
It seems as if a pattern is emerging, doesn’t it? Engineers from interested 
hardware and software companies gather under the flag of an IEEE task 
force to develop yet another new set of network security tools to make their 
products safe from hackers, crackers, eavesdroppers, and other miscreants—
and a few months later, an independent researcher at some university or 
government agency discovers that the new tools have their own serious prob-
lems that expose the “protected” data to break-ins and leaks, and yet another 
cracking program shows up on the Internet, “just to demonstrate the concept.” 
In the meantime, the poor end users of the world are running as fast as they 
can to keep up, but their wireless networks still aren’t completely secure. 
If you look at wireless security as a cat-and-mouse game, it’s pretty clear 
that the mice (or is it the cats?) need some sophisticated knowledge and 
equipment to work around the existing encryption and authentication tools. 
On the other hand, some of the most advanced tools are freely available to 
anyone with an Internet connection. 
What to do? Is a secure wireless network an unreachable goal? Don’t 
give up hope. WPA encryption is secure enough to keep most intruders out 
of the vast majority of Wi-Fi networks, and the additional security features 
included in the new 802.11n specification will provide even more protection. 
If that’s not good enough, you can add a VPN to provide yet another layer of 
security for your data.  
Think of wireless security like the front door to your house: If you leave 
the door wide open, anybody can walk in and steal your stuff. But when you 
lock the door and latch all the windows, it will be much more difficult for a 
burglar to enter. An expert can pick the lock, but that takes a lot of time and 
trouble, and most thieves will look for an unprotected house instead.

Wi-Fi is not the only way to connect a 
computer to the Internet. Several other 
methods are also out there, and each of 
them offers a unique combination of advantages 
and drawbacks. Wired LANs and connections through 
power lines are often faster and more convenient than 
Wi-Fi for fixed installations such as home and office 
networks; other radio services might be better for 
connecting your smartphone, laptop, or PDA. 
Every connection method is a trade-off among data transfer speed, ease 
of access, cost, and other features. For many users, the added convenience of 
a single connection that’s available without the need to search for an access 
point is worth the added cost and the sacrifice in data transfer speed. 
This chapter describes the currently available wireless services and offers 
advice about choosing the best one for your particular needs.

Chapter 13
What’s Wrong with Wi-Fi?
Thousands of Wi-Fi networks blanket most urban and suburban areas in 
North America and Europe. Almost every new laptop computer includes a 
Wi-Fi adapter, and separate plug-in adapters are cheap and easy to install. 
Access points are inexpensive and convenient. Wi-Fi network connections 
are generally fast and reliable. So what’s not to like? 
In spite of its many attractive features, Wi-Fi is not the ideal wireless 
service for all occasions. Wi-Fi networks have these drawbacks: 
 Every time you move to a new location, you must set up a new Wi-Fi 
connection, often through a different network that requires a different 
account.
 Public Wi-Fi networks are not available everywhere. Just because your 
computer detects a handful of signals from Wi-Fi access points doesn’t 
mean that you can connect to them; many are likely to be encrypted 
private networks.
 Wi-Fi networks have a limited signal range. Unless you’re using some 
kind of high-gain antenna, a network with a single access point typically 
reaches no more than 300 feet (100 meters) outdoors or a lot less if 
there are walls between your computer and the base station. 
 Wide area campus-wide or larger networks require multiple access points, 
which can be expensive and complicated to install and maintain.
 Every Wi-Fi network requires a separate login, password, and encryp-
tion key.
 Wi-Fi networks are less secure than most wired LANs; even if the network 
uses encryption and address filtering, a determined snoop can capture 
and read Wi-Fi data.
 Using a Wi-Fi network adapter can expose your computer to access from 
other users who could read your files and steal your identity. This is not 
common, but it’s possible.
None of these problems should discourage you from ever using Wi-Fi; it’s 
often faster and cheaper than any other wireless service, and sometimes it’s 
the only available option. But just because there’s a Wi-Fi adapter built into 
your laptop computer, it’s not always the best way to connect it to the Internet.
Broadband Data Services
Each type of wide-area broadband wireless service uses a different set of radio 
frequencies and a different type of modulation, but from a user’s point of 
view, they’re all very similar. A built-in network adapter or a plug-in PC Card 
or USB adapter exchanges data with a network of base stations that covers an 
entire metropolitan area, highway corridor, or other large geographic region. 
Unlike Wi-Fi, there’s no need to search for an access point before you connect 
your computer to the Internet; within the service area, you can assume that 
there’s always a usable signal wherever you are. The characteristics that set 

Alternatives to Wi-Fi: Wireless Broadband Data
241
each service apart from its competitors include the specific coverage footprint, 
the cost of a monthly subscription, the proprietary control software, and the 
data transfer speed.
Wide-area broadband services offer these advantages over Wi-Fi:
 Each service offers coverage over an entire region; roaming from one 
location to another is no problem.
 It’s not necessary to maintain separate subscriptions for more than one 
hot spot or service provider.
 A single connection profile is all you need to connect anywhere; there’s 
no need for a different profile for each access point or service provider.
 The service providers operate and maintain the access points.
 These services operate on licensed frequencies, so interference with 
other sources of radio signals is not a serious issue.
 Each service provider supplies the network adapter hardware already 
configured to its frequencies and modulation types; it’s not necessary 
(or possible) to shop for hardware separately.
In practice, if you’re within the footprint of a broadband wireless service 
provider’s signal, you can turn on your wireless adapter and expect to connect 
to the Internet. However, many wide-area broadband networks are often 
significantly slower than Wi-Fi, and the cost of a monthly subscription is still 
relatively expensive (although both of these conditions might change in the 
next few years). Until the broadband providers build out their service areas 
and expand their roaming agreements with other carriers, no single service 
offers anything close to universal coverage.
As a general rule, the speed of a wireless Internet service decreases as the 
coverage area of a single access point expands, so a Wi-Fi link is almost always 
much faster than a cellular data service. However, there are some exceptions: 
When WiMAX networks become available, they might be just as fast as Wi-Fi 
links. Older mobile phone modems are even slower, but they use obsolete 
technology (such as GPRS), so they’re not part of this discussion.
The difference in speed between Wi-Fi and broadband wireless can be 
dramatic, so some broadband control programs can choose a Wi-Fi signal 
when it’s within range and switch to the slower broadband service when 
that’s the only signal available. When Apple introduced the iPhone, many 
users complained that AT&T’s broadband EDGE connections were much 
slower than a Wi-Fi signal.
In the future, we can expect to see modems built into new laptop 
computers that will automatically find and use the fastest available wireless 
connection to the Internet from any location; if there’s a speedy Wi-Fi hot 
spot nearby, the computer will grab and use that signal, but if it can’t find a 
usable Wi-Fi network, it will connect through your cellular network’s slower 
broadband service instead. Today, some broadband control programs (like 
the T-Mobile Connection Manager shown in Figure 13-1) allow you to man-
ually select either type of connection from the same window.

242
Chapter 13
Figure 13-1: The T-Mobile Connection Manager con-
trols both Wi-Fi and broadband network connections.
In the T-Mobile program, the panel at the right side of the window shows 
the relative signal strength of the Wi-Fi and EDGE/GPRS signals that it has 
detected. EDGE/GPRS (Enhanced Data rate for GSM Evolution/General Packet 
Radio Service) are the technologies that T-Mobile uses for its broadband wireless 
service. If the faster EDGE service is available, the program automatically uses 
it; otherwise, it drops down to a slower GPRS data link. When you choose the 
type of service you want to use, you can either click the Connect button in 
the center of the window or click the name of the service type to see a list of 
available signals. In the next generation of wireless control programs, this 
will all be automatic; the program will choose the best signal and automatically 
connect your computer to that network.
Comparing Technologies
Today’s broadband wireless data services use several different transmission 
specifications: some of them, including EDGE (Enhanced Data GSM Evo-
lution) and EV-DO (Evolution-Data Optimized), are part of the latest 
generation of cellular telephone networks. Others use dedicated data-only 
wireless technologies, such as WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for 
Microwave Access).
In North America, the cellular service providers offer either EDGE or 
EV-DO. If your cellular carrier uses CDMA (code division multiple access) 
technology, its broadband wireless data service uses EV-DO; if the cellular 
service uses GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), its data ser-
vice uses EDGE. Both EDGE and EV-DO are sometimes called 3G (third-
generation cellular) services, but EDGE is technically not a true third-generation 
technology.
Both systems provide data networks that can reach a large area, but the 
various cellular service providers are still in the process of expanding their 
coverage footprints. Before you commit to a particular service, it’s absolutely 
essential to test it in the specific locations where you want to use it most often.
There can be a substantial difference in speed between EDGE and EV-DO; 
EDGE is limited to average speeds of 400 to 700Kbps. The maximum speed 
of the original (Revision 0) EV-DO networks was only about 300 to 700Kbps, 

Alternatives to Wi-Fi: Wireless Broadband Data
243
which is similar to EDGE, but the newer EV-DO Revision A (often called 
Rev. A) networks can operate at maximum download speeds up to about 
2.4Mbps under ideal conditions (but the average speed is generally around 
1.0 to 1.5Mbps, or maybe a little faster). Therefore, you should make sure 
that your modem and your local service provider are both capable of using 
Rev. A signals.
Rev. A is not the end of EV-DO development. The hardware manufacturer 
Qualcomm has announced that it is ready to start making Revision B chip 
sets (the essential integrated circuits inside modems, adapters, and base 
stations), which will allow data to move through two or three radio carriers 
(similar to channels) at the same time. Allowing for handshaking and other 
network overhead, Rev. B should offer data transfer speed at about 4.5Mbps. 
By the time the broadband service providers complete their product develop-
ment and marketing, it will probably be another few years before commercial 
Rev. B service becomes available.
Either network type (EDGE or EV-DO) offers a substantial improvement 
over a dial-up link or a GPRS connection, but an EDGE network link is pretty 
pokey when compared to a Wi-Fi or EV-DO (Rev. A) network. 
Both EDGE and EV-DO provide download speeds (from the Internet to 
your computer) several times faster than their upload speeds (from your 
computer to the Internet). Unless you’re playing multiplayer games, sending 
huge music or video files, or transmitting some other kind of very large files, 
this probably won’t make much difference to your real-world performance.
The price of wireless data service through either an EDGE or EV-DO 
network in the United States or Canada is about the same (typically about 
$60 per month in mid-2007), but you can often find promotions and special 
deals that might reduce that cost. At a minimum, look for an offer that 
includes a free network adapter. When WiMAX and other competitive ser-
vices become available, you can expect the prices of both EDGE and EV-DO 
access to drop.
NOTE
If you choose a low-cost measured broadband service (rather than an unlimited “all you 
can eat” account), remember that the price is based on the total number of bits that pass 
through the network to and from your computer. Every time your computer checks for 
new email or instant messages, the bit count increases by a small amount, even if you 
don’t send or receive new messages. All those no-new-messages exchanges can add up 
over the course of a month.
Many broadband wireless carriers offer a choice of network adapters as 
either PC Cards or USB devices. Both contain similar radios, so the perfor-
mance is likely to be the same with either type. If your computer has a 
PCMCIA socket, a PC Card is often more convenient than a USB unit, but 
when you’re using your computer in a location with a weak signal, you might 
be able to find a stronger signal by moving the USB device. If you’re indoors, 
you can sometimes improve performance by placing the USB box close to a 
window or using a third-party signal booster. Figure 13-2 shows three typical 
broadband network adapters.

Figure 13-2: Broadband network adapters are available 
as USB, ExpressCard, and PC Card.
Unlike Wi-Fi adapters, which are sold separately from the wireless 
services that use them, almost all broadband wireless devices are either 
supplied to new customers directly from the network service providers or 
built into new laptops and other portables (often as an extra-cost option). 
It might be possible to buy a network adapter directly from the hardware 
manufacturer, but it’s a bad idea for several reasons: It will almost certainly 
cost more than the one supplied with your network contract, a generic 
adapter won’t include the specific firmware that each service provider 
requires, and the service provider’s technical support center won’t want 
to talk to you. 
NOTE
When a broadband adapter is built into a new laptop, that adapter is usually limited 
to a single service provider that has a marketing deal with the laptop’s manufacturer 
or distributor. Most laptop suppliers offer access to only one or two broadband service 
providers, so it’s important to choose the service provider you want to use. If your laptop 
is not available with an adapter from your preferred service provider, order the computer 
without a built-in broadband adapter and use a separate PC Card supplied by the 
carrier you want to use. 
Choosing a Service Provider
As a general rule, the companies that offer cellular mobile telephone service 
in your town or city also offer broadband wireless data. 
AT&T is the major national EDGE service provider in the United 
States. Its adapters are available as low-cost options in many brands of new 
laptop computers, including Dell, Lenovo, HP, and Sony, and it’s also the 
captive broadband service provider for Apple’s iPhones (although a quick 
Internet search should point you to instructions for unlocking an iPhone). 
The T-Mobile broadband network also uses EDGE. Unless you’re living in an 
area that is not served by a faster EV-DO service, the slower EDGE network 

Alternatives to Wi-Fi: Wireless Broadband Data
245
service is probably not the best choice because an EV-DO connection will be 
noticeably faster.
The major national providers of EV-DO service in the United States are 
Verizon, Sprint, and Alltel. Several other cellular services and telephone 
companies also offer access to EV-DO wireless data networks, but most of 
them are resellers of service from one of the big three. For example, Qwest 
Wireless offers its own branded EV-DO service, but it uses the Sprint network. 
In Alaska, the major EV-DO provider is ACS wireless. In Canada, both TELUS 
and Bell Mobility (part of Bell Canada) offer EV-DO service in major pop-
ulation centers nationwide, and some smaller carriers provide their own 
service in certain provinces. 
All the service providers that use the same technology get their wireless 
network adapters and base station hardware from the same two or three 
manufacturers, so their performance and reliability are just about the same. 
The most important differences from one provider to another are often the 
locations of their radio towers and the quality of the companies’ technical 
support and billing staffs.
The best approach is to compare offers from two or three providers. Total 
cost per month, cost of a network adapter, and coverage in all the places you 
expect to visit should all be part of your selection process. If you travel outside 
your own country, look for a package that includes international roaming. It 
might also be instructive to call each company’s technical support telephone 
line to see how long you have to wait for a live technician and whether the 
technician is fluent in English (or your own native language). If possible, ask 
for a brief trial period for any new service. Most companies will let you return 
an adapter and cancel your account within a few days if you can’t get an accept-
able connection.
Many cellular phone companies offer package deals that combine broad-
band wireless and mobile telephone service, sometimes with other services 
such as long distance and satellite television as a package deal; call your 
account representative or visit their retail store for specific details.
Coverage
The first and most important issue to consider when you’re shopping for a 
broadband wireless data service is whether the service provider’s signal 
reaches all the locations where you’re likely to use it. If the coverage area 
(sometimes called the footprint) doesn’t include your small-town customers’ 
places of business or the highway corridors where you travel, it doesn’t matter 
how good the service might be in downtown Chicago or Denver.
All the service providers are constantly adding new locations to their 
coverage areas, so you can’t always trust the printed coverage map that you 
might receive from a salesperson. The most reliable coverage maps are the 
ones on each carrier’s website:

T-Mobile

Chapter 13
If you can convince a service provider to let you try its service in the 
locations where you’re most likely to use it, that’s the best possible test. Look 
for either a try before you buy deal or a satisfaction guaranteed offer that 
allows you to return the network adapter and cancel your subscription within 
a week or two for a full refund.
Data Speed
Assuming that more than one service provider can offer service in the place 
where you want to use it, the service that offers the highest data transfer speed 
is the best choice. Therefore, an EV-DO (Rev. A) service is preferable to 
either EV-DO (Rev. 0) or EDGE, and any kind of broadband service is better 
than an older GPRS service. 
Many service providers are gradually improving their higher-speed 
coverage, so a salesperson might tell you that your neighborhood might not 
have high-speed service right now, but it’s coming soon. Even if this claim is 
true, if a competing service can supply broadband today, that service should 
be your first choice (at least for now; you might want to reconsider when 
your initial contract expires).
Selecting the broadband data service that can provide the fastest 
connection is particularly important if you use the connection to receive 
high-bandwidth network content, such as streaming audio and video and 
image-rich web pages. On the other hand, if you only use your wireless 
Internet service for email, instant messages, and viewing websites that are 
limited to text, data transfer speed might not be as important as cost and 
good reception. 
Cost
Broadband wireless service is expensive compared to either wired DSL or 
cable modem service, and it’s extravagant when you compare it with free 
Wi-Fi access in a library or coffee shop. Therefore, it’s worth the time and 
trouble to compare offers from all of the service providers in your area.
Assuming that the local wireless services are all using the same technology 
(EV-DO Rev. A if possible) and the coverage footprint of each service includes 
all the places you expect to take your computer, look for the least expensive 
offer, both in terms of startup cost and monthly fees. 
Many telephone companies offer discounted package deals if you buy 
more than one service from them. If you order some combination of wired 
home or business telephone service, long distance, cellular mobile voice, 
and wireless data from the same company, the service provider might offer 
you a substantial discount.

NOTE
Some service providers might offer a lower price or a free network adapter if you commit 
to a long-term contract, often for two years or more. Read the terms and conditions of 
the agreement before you sign up for more than a single year—it’s quite possible that 
today’s bargain might be more expensive than next year’s competitive deals. As wireless 
technology continues to improve, you might regret locking yourself into a relatively slow 
network service.
Choosing a Network Adapter
Some broadband service providers call them modems rather than network 
adapters, but just about everybody uses similar PC Cards and USB adapters. 
Each company loads its own licensed radio frequencies and firmware, but the 
basic modems are all just about the same.
Each of the major service providers offers a free or very low-cost modem 
to new subscribers along with one or more extra-cost alternatives. Before you 
choose an adapter, read the specifications carefully to make sure that the 
modem supports either EDGE or EV-DO (Rev. A) technology, depending on 
the service provider. EV-DO (Rev. 0) and GPRS are older, slower systems.
Unless you need the added flexibility of a USB adapter or your computer 
requires an ExpressCard, choose the service provider’s free or least expensive 
PC Card modem. Remember that the PC Card will operate inside your com-
puter, so you shouldn’t care about its physical appearance—a shiny expensive 
modem probably doesn’t work any better than the cheap one that costs $50 
or $100 less.
Service and Support
All of the wireless broadband service providers except Clearwire are also 
cellular mobile telephone companies, so you can expect them to treat 
their wireless data customers the same way they treat their cell phone users. 
Unfortunately, that’s not good news—the only industries that score lower in 
customer satisfaction than cellular companies are airlines, news media, and 
cable television companies (see the American Customer Satisfaction Index 
at http://www.theacsi.org).
However, there’s a substantial range between the highest- and lowest-rated 
service providers, so it’s often helpful to ask your friends and colleagues 
about their experiences and look for reports and evaluations on the Internet 
and in consumer publications. After you read two or three of these compar-
isons, you will begin to see a pattern: All the carriers have critics, but some 
appear to provide consistently better service than others.
It can also be instructive to look at the “I hate name of carrier” or 
“company sucks” websites and forums, but don’t rely on them for objective 
reports. The people who post reports to those sites about their terrible 
experiences are the ones who have had bad experiences; they are probably 
not a random cross section of the company’s customers. However, when the 
same complaint appears repeatedly, it might be a sign that the company has 
a real problem. And it’s also useful to see how the company itself responds to 
those complaints.

Broadband Wireless Services Around the World
Like the cellular mobile telephone services that came before them, EDGE 
and EV-DO broadband wireless data services are available in most of the 
industrialized world. When you travel, it might be possible to find roaming 
agreements between your service provider and one or more local companies, 
but the cost can be very high. Before you leave home, ask your account rep-
resentative about international service and roaming charges, or consult this 
website: http://www.gsmworld.com/roaming. 
As an alternative to expensive international roaming, it’s often cheaper 
to establish a separate account with a local company after you arrive. Look 
for a store or kiosk in the airport when you arrive, or try one of the links from 
these web pages:

Connecting to a Wireless Broadband Network
Each broadband service provides proprietary control software along with its 
network adapters, but they all basically do the same things. For example, 
Figure 13-3 shows the Verizon Broadband and Sprint Mobile Broadband 
control programs. There’s a picture of the T-Mobile control program in 
Figure 13-1. The control programs from other carriers offer similar combina-
tions of features.
All of these programs offer the choice of setting up the connection 
manually by clicking the Connect or Go buttons or automatically establish-
ing a live connection every time you run the program. After you establish a 
connection, you can use your web browser, email or instant messaging pro-
gram, and any other Internet application, just as if you were using any other 
type of Internet connection.
When you’re not using the Internet, it’s usually a good idea to turn off 
the wireless adapter or remove it from your computer’s PC Card slot, especially 
if you’re using your computer on batteries. When the adapter is off and the 
Internet link is closed, you’re not sending or receiving radio signals, and 
there’s no opportunity (however slight) for a wireless intruder to capture 
your signals and steal your data or read your files.

Alternatives to Wi-Fi: Wireless Broadband Data
249
Figure 13-3: Both Verizon and Sprint provide control software with their wireless network adapters.
Using More Than One Computer
Every broadband wireless account is tied to a single modem or network 
adapter. If you have more than one portable computer, you can either move 
the modem from one machine to another or obtain more than one account, 
with a separate modem for each. However, you can use any removable 
adapter with any computer as long as the control software is installed on the 
computer; you don’t have to tie the adapter to a single computer.
If your family or business owns and uses more than one computer, you 
have several choices:
 You can buy a broadband account and adapter for each computer.
 You can buy just one account and move the adapter to the computer 
you’re currently using. This might be a good approach if you want to 
share your broadband account between a desktop computer at home or 
in the office and a laptop that you use on the road.
 You can buy two or more accounts, with an adapter for each account. 
Every time you or a family member (or colleague) needs broadband 
service, you can take an adapter from the pool and return it when you’re 
finished.
If you or your business expects to use more than one broadband account 
(with an adapter for each), look for a package deal. It might not be listed in 
the brochure, but every service provider probably has a variety of family plans 
and special offers for large and small businesses that include free adapters, 
lower monthly fees, and maybe even a free month or more. Keep asking 
“Is that your best deal?” until you’re convinced that you have a really good 
offer. Remember that you’re a potentially important customer who rep-
resents ongoing revenue for the service provider and commissions for the 
salesperson. 

250
Chapter 13
Broadband Security
No wireless network is completely secure, but broadband technology comes 
closer than Wi-Fi because the service does not share its operating frequency 
with other radio services, and the service provider controls the hardware at 
both ends of the network connection. Both EDGE and EV-DO systems use 
the same methods as mobile telephones to assign a unique electronic serial 
number (ESN) to each modem and restrict access to the network (and the 
Internet) to the ESNs that correspond to active accounts. In addition, a 
broadband connection to the Internet does not move through a LAN, so 
there’s little or no risk that intruders could use a broadband modem as a 
gateway to the data stored on your computer.
In theory, it would be possible to use a microwave scanner to monitor 
broadband radio signals or to create a transceiver that spoofs a broadband 
base station, but we’re talking about expensive equipment and sophisticated 
decoding software. It can probably be done, but it requires a lot more effort 
than cracking a Wi-Fi signal. 
Encryption is not an option, but if you’re using a broadband account 
to connect to a fileserver, email server, or a corporate network, you can use 
the same kind of VPN that you would use through a Wi-Fi link. Chapter 15 
explains how to set up and use a VPN.
Clearwire, Sprint, and Other Pre-WiMAX Services
WiMAX is yet another broadband technology that will combine the speed 
of a Wi-Fi network and the convenience of EDGE and EV-DO in a single 
network service. When they become available, WiMAX networks are expected 
to move data at a maximum speed of about 70Mbps. Even after you allow for 
a generous amount of overhead, that’s obviously a lot faster than anything 
the current generation of broadband cellular services can offer.
However, full WiMAX service won’t be widely available until mid-2008 at 
the earliest, and it will probably take the service providers several years after 
that to install base stations and offer comprehensive coverage across the 
country. By that time, it’s possible that today’s EDGE and EV-DO networks 
will be replaced by faster EV-DO (Rev. B) and other high-speed broadband 
methods. In the meantime, the two major US WiMAX players, Clearwire and 
Sprint Broadband, are using a slower pre-WiMAX technology that tops out at 
about 1.5Mbps (many users report even slower connections, depending on 
their location relative to the nearest radio tower). Between the two companies, 
pre-WiMAX is available in a growing number of locations. Pre-WiMAX services 
were initially offered as a wireless alternative to DSL and cable Internet services 
in offices, homes, and other fixed locations, but Clearwire also offers plug-in 
PC Cards and, eventually, built-in adapters for both Clearwire and Sprint’s 
Xohm service will be available as an option in new laptop computers. When 
these become widely available, they’re likely to become contenders in the 
wireless networking marketplace. 

Alternatives to Wi-Fi: Wireless Broadband Data
251
Pre-WiMAX systems are as easy to use as wired DSL or cable modem 
connections to the Internet. After you enter your account information 
into the modem, it stores those details in its firmware, so it’s plug and 
play: Whenever you turn on the computer and the modem, you have a live 
broadband Internet link.
If Clearwire’s fixed-location pre-WiMAX modems are any indication 
(the PC Cards were not yet available when this book was written), the network 
adapters on PC Cards and the laptops that use the same technology will 
provide clean and reliable Internet connections when they are within range 
of a base station. However, some users have reported reception problems 
when the tower is too far away or if there’s thick foliage between the tower 
and their modems.
Clearwire recommends placing the modem (with its built-in internal 
antenna) next to a window for best performance, and Sprint uses a separate 
transceiver antenna mounted on the roof or an outside wall. Fixing poor 
signal quality is usually possible in a fixed-wireless system such as a home or 
office network, but it’s less practical when you’re using the same technology 
with a laptop computer in multiple locations. It remains to be seen whether 
pre-WiMAX will be practical as a use-it-anywhere wireless Internet access 
method. When true WiMAX becomes available, the existing pre-WiMAX 
service providers will supply free or low-cost replacement hardware and 
software to all their subscribers. 
We can expect “real” WiMAX service to be much more reliable because 
it uses a completely different type of radio modulation and (probably) a 
different set of frequencies. WiMAX signals will be easier to receive and 
less susceptible to interference than the current generation of pre-WiMAX 
services. In the long run, WiMAX might offer a near-ideal combination of 
high speed and wide coverage without the need to find a new signal and a 
new account in every new location. If WiMAX fulfills its technical potential, 
if the business model produces enough money to build widespread networks, 
and if the WiMAX providers don’t take lessons in poor customer service from 
the cable television and cellular telephone companies, it might become the 
clear choice for wireless Internet access. In the meantime, pre-WiMAX is 
worth a look, but don’t set your expectations too high.
Broadband Wireless in Automobiles and Other Vehicles
As broadband access to the Internet becomes practical, it’s inevitable that 
many people will begin using online services and resources in their cars, 
trucks, and other vehicles. Today, many commuter railroads, bus lines, and 
ferry boats offer onboard Wi-Fi, and similar service is coming to commercial 
airliners, but that’s mostly a matter of passengers using their laptops and 
other portables from their seats. Mobile Internet services for private vehicles 
open up a whole new world of possibilities. 
Among other things, a live in-car Internet connection could provide 
instant messaging, email, and some kind of limited access to the World Wide 
Web, along with live traffic reports and updates to the maps and databases in 

252
Chapter 13
GPS receivers and onboard navigation displays. As a supplement or replace-
ment for a car radio, an Internet receiver could also allow drivers and 
passengers to listen to streaming radio stations and other audio services 
from around the world; when there’s nothing on local radio worth your 
attention, you can switch to the Internet and choose from a much wider 
variety of music or talk, even if it’s on a station thousands of miles away.
Any mobile Internet connection requires these elements:
 A signal from a wireless Internet service provider
 An antenna to send and receive the wireless signals
 A wireless network interface in a computer, a PDA, or a special Internet 
appliance
In a vehicle, each of these elements has special requirements that don’t 
usually apply to a stationary connection. The signal must be accessible over a 
wide enough area that it doesn’t disappear as you move from place to place 
at relatively high speeds (meaning anything faster than walking); the antenna 
must have a way to bypass the shield created by the metal shell of the vehicle; 
and the computer or other device must be compact and easy to use, especially 
if the driver must operate it while the vehicle is in motion.
Today the easiest way to establish an Internet link in a car is to use a 
laptop, PDA, or other portable with a broadband wireless adapter, possibly 
with a USB interface to the radio/CD player in the dashboard. If the car is 
parked within range of a public Wi-Fi signal, you could use Wi-Fi in place of 
the broadband adapter. Of course, the driver should not try to use a computer 
unless the car is parked.
Obviously, the control and connection software and the web browser 
program in a portable computer don’t change just because the device is 
sitting on the passenger seat of an automobile. It still works exactly the same 
way as it does when your laptop is on a table in a coffee shop or on your lap 
in an airport’s waiting area. The biggest difference is that you and the 
computer might be moving at relatively high speed, so the network will 
probably transfer your connection from one base station or radio tower to 
another. 
The broadband wireless and WiMAX networks are designed to handle 
this kind of hand off, so you might not notice any change as you move around. 
However, if you move into a location where the network has a lot of active 
users, you might notice that your connection speed has dropped. 
Of course, if you’re driving out to the boondocks where there aren’t any 
nearby towers, you could lose the connection completely. This probably 
won’t happen if you stay on the main highways because the network service 
providers have decent coverage along those roads, but you’re on your own 
when you decide to take the scenic route. If it’s absolutely essential to maintain 
a connection, consult your service provider’s website for their current coverage 
maps before you leave home. 
You can also use a broadband wireless service to connect from a recrea-
tional vehicle or aboard a boat, as long as you’re within range of your service 
provider’s signal. The easiest way to handle this kind of connection is to use a

laptop computer and a power adapter that takes power directly from the 
boat or car’s electrical system. For best performance, you will want to mount 
an external antenna on the roof of your vehicle or the mast of your boat.
TracNet 
One possible alternative to a portable computer is the KVH TracNet 100 
Mobile Internet Receiver (http://www.kvh.com/Products/product.asp?id=123), 
which is shown in Figure 13-4. It’s a special-purpose network router with a PC 
Card socket for an EV-DO adapter, a choice of external antennas for cars, 
boats, or recreational vehicles, output audio and video connections to the 
car’s built-in entertainment system, and a Wi-Fi hot spot to connect it to your 
laptop or PDA. The whole thing runs on 12-volt DC power, so it can operate 
on the car’s electrical system.

Figure 13-4: The KVH TracNet 100 offers mobile 
access to the Internet through in-car video monitors.
The TracNet system comes with a Kyocera EV-DO adapter configured for 
the Verizon Wireless network; however, if you have an account with a different 
provider, it ought to work equally well if you swap the Verizon adapter with 
one from any other EV-DO service provider that uses the same model of 
adapter card (see http://www.kyocera-wireless.com/wireless/where-to-buy.htm for a 
list of service providers). If you already have a broadband wireless account 
with Verizon, you can move the adapter card between your laptop and the 
TracNet router. 
A TracNet system is not cheap; the router, antenna, keyboard, and remote 
control cost about $2,000, plus separate monthly subscriptions to both MSN 
TV and Verizon Wireless BroadbandAccess Service, so it’s not for everybody. 
But as a demonstration of mobile Internet access, it’s a legitimate start, and 
it’s available right now. In the future, we can expect to see less complex systems 
at lower cost, both as options in new cars and as aftermarket accessories. 

254
Chapter 13
External Antennas
Whether you use a built-in wireless system or a portable unit in your car, you 
will probably need an external antenna mounted on the vehicle’s roof or 
rear deck or attached to a rear window with some kind of adhesive, because 
the vehicle’s metal body is often an effective shield that blocks radio signals. 
Broadband wireless data services use the same radio frequencies as cellular 
mobile telephones, so the same antennas work on both, as long as you can 
find a cable to connect the phone or adapter to the antenna.
The exact type and location of the antenna connector is different on 
different wireless adapters, so it’s essential to use an antenna cable with the 
correct mating connector at the end. The first place to look for a car antenna 
with the right kind of cable connector is a local electronics dealer that special-
izes in installing cellular mobile telephones in cars. Even if they don’t have 
exactly the right antenna in stock, they’ll probably know where to find one 
for you. If you can’t find the antenna and cable locally, try an online dealer 
such as wpsantennas.com (http://www.wpsantennas.com) or Wilson Electronics 
(http://wilsonelectronics.com). Both of those companies have online lists of 
common wireless adapters and mobile phones, with cross references to 
matching antenna cables.
Safety Issues 
Operating a computer while you are driving can be an even greater distraction 
than using a mobile telephone. It’s just not possible to safely use a keyboard 
or a keypad, or look at a computer’s display screen, and concentrate on the 
road in front of you at the same time. Don’t even consider it. Either let your 
passenger operate the computer, or pull the car over to the side of the road 
before you try to do it yourself.
This really ought to go without saying, but the number of people who 
use mobile phones while driving suggests otherwise. Please don’t endanger 
yourself, your passengers, and nearby pedestrians or other drivers by doing 
anything that distracts you from maintaining control of that large, expensive, 
heavy car or truck. It’s just not worth the risk. 
It’s also important to remember that a laptop computer or a PDA sitting 
on the seat of a parked car is likely to attract the wrong kind of attention from 
a thief who could break into the vehicle and steal it. Remember to place your 
computer and other valuable objects under cover or out of sight whenever 
you’re away from the car.

Wi-Fi and other broadband wireless net-
works are not limited to full-size computers 
running full-size operating systems. Palms, 
BlackBerries, Pocket PCs, iPhones, and other 
handheld personal digital assistants (PDAs) can all use 
wireless links to synchronize data with other computers, 
send and receive email, and download data from the Internet. This new 
category of hybrid devices automatically switches between relatively slow EDGE 
or EV-DO networks with wide coverage areas to much faster Wi-Fi networks 
whenever it’s possible to do so. 
Every model has a different set of features and functions, from relatively 
simple phones that offer limited access to text-based information such as 
weather forecasts or sports scores, to very sophisticated devices that use an 
operating system such as Windows Mobile or Palm OS to handle email and 
web browsing. Many phones double as digital cameras that allow users to 
send and receive pictures, multimedia players that can store and play music 
and video, and GPS receivers that offer driving directions. 

256
Chapter 14
Voice and data services have come closer to converging with each 
advance from first-generation cellular mobile telephone service (analog 
voice only) through second- and third-generation (2G and 3G) digital 
services. Depending on the wireless method the service provider uses, many 
of the latest mobile telephones can send and receive a limited amount of 
data (such as text messages and pictures) along with the now-traditional 
voice connections. These are the same wireless methods that support many 
PDAs and the broadband wireless adapters described in Chapter 13. 
NOTE
It’s also possible to use almost any mobile telephone to connect a portable computer or 
a PDA to the Internet through a dial-up modem and a special cable, but the connection 
will be slow and cumbersome because dial-up access is normally limited to a maximum 
of 56Kbps. Other devices and service plans might offer a significantly faster data 
connection as well.
For the purposes of this chapter, a PDA is a handheld computer that uses 
either a specialized Personal Information Manager (PIM) operating system 
or a version of Linux that has been customized for use with mobile devices. A 
smartphone is a PDA that can be used as a mobile telephone through one of 
the cellular mobile telephone networks, along with its other PIM functions. 
Connecting to the Internet Through PDAs and Other 
Handheld Devices
PDAs with wireless network adapters can be particularly useful while you’re 
away from your own home or office, when you want to send and receive email 
or text messages, or when you want to consult an online information source. 
The combination of a telephone, a camera, a text and voice recorder, a music 
player, an Internet appliance, and a small general-purpose computer in a 
convenient pocket-size package is a huge advance in the way people use 
technology. Fifty years ago, having all that technology in your pocket was 
inconceivable; even 5 or 10 years ago it would have required half a dozen 
separate devices (and of course, 50 years from now it will all seem impossibly 
primitive).
The same Wi-Fi network services that support laptops and desktop com-
puters can also work with handheld devices. One or more access points operate 
as hubs for the wireless network and double as bridges to the wired portion 
of a LAN and to the Internet. A single network can include both handheld 
units and larger computers, so it’s entirely practical to use a wireless link to 
synchronize a PDA with another computer. 
NOTE
A web search for compact flash or SD Wi-Fi adapters will produce thousands of links, 
but most of them are several years out of date. Just because a product has been discon-
tinued doesn’t mean that the web pages that describe it go away.

Smartphones and PDAs
257
Choosing a Smartphone
The best place to find a new smartphone with broadband wireless access is 
the service provider whose network you want to use. You can either choose the 
model you want and look for a service provider that supports it, or you can 
select a service provider and limit your choices to its list of models. Most mobile 
telephone companies and wireless service providers have retail stores and web-
sites where you can compare the specific models that are compatible with 
their networks. 
Because most PDAs and smartphones have small display screens, their 
designers have squeezed a lot of program icons and other information into a 
tiny space. This can make it considerably more difficult to operate a handheld 
device than a full-size computer with a big screen, a mouse, and a keyboard. 
Of course, there’s usually a learning curve that will make any device easier to 
use over time, but it’s still important to try more than one of them before you 
buy. “Easy to use” is a subjective call that will not be the same for everyone. 
Some people will be happier with the iPhone’s touch screen, while others will 
prefer a BlackBerry’s keyboard or a simple keypad on a Windows Mobile or 
Symbian device. Your best bet is to visit one or more retail stores and compare 
several phones with different operating systems, different feature sets, and 
different physical layouts.
Every smartphone comes with a basic set of programs, and many others 
are also available. When you’re trying to decide which phone to buy, consider 
the programs you’re likely to use, and be sure to choose a device that either 
includes those programs with the phone or supports one or more aftermarket 
programs that fill your requirements.
UPGRADING AN OLDER PDA
Wi-Fi adapters for smartphones were a popular add-on product a few years ago, but 
these tiny plug-in cards have become an obscure specialty product as new smart-
phones with built-in Wi-Fi have replaced the older models. A few manufacturers still 
make Wi-Fi adapters on SD, miniSD, and CompactFlash cards, but they’re probably 
companies you’ve never heard of, like SparkLAN (http://www.sparklan.com) and 
Spectec (http://www.spectec.com.tw). If you can’t find an adapter through your usual 
suppliers, try searching for Wi-Fi compact flash or Wi-Fi SD on eBay. 
There was no universal standard for plug-in adapters, so each PDA make and 
model required a specific type that might not be compatible with other brands. Your 
PDA instruction manual or user’s guide should identify the type of network adapter 
that it needs to connect to a wireless network.
Some older adapters are still available through the surplus channels, but before 
you order one, make sure you can find a driver for your PDA’s operating system, 
either on the CD supplied with the adapter or by download from the manufacturer’s 
website. NETGEAR, Linksys, and the other major adapter makers still have drivers 
and software for their discontinued adapters available for free download, but they 
probably won’t have drivers for more recent operating systems.

258
Chapter 14
It’s also important to compare the specific wireless services that each 
device supports. Does it use a fast EV-DO or EDGE connection, or is it limited 
to the slower GPRS system? Does it automatically search for a nearby Wi-Fi 
signal before it connects to a broadband network? Does the service provider 
offer useful signal coverage in all the places you expect to use the device? Of 
course, some smartphones are bigger than others. If you plan to carry yours 
in a pocket rather than a purse or briefcase, a smaller unit might be the 
better choice.
Like mobile telephones, each wireless data device has a unique electronic 
serial number (ESN) that links that adapter to a specific account. When you 
buy a smartphone or a PDA with broadband wireless access, you must either 
set up a new account for your new PDA or transfer an existing account from 
another device. 
NOTE
If you transfer your phone or PDA from one service provider to another, the new service 
provider might have to open up your PDA and install a new circuit board with a 
different ESN. 
Smartphone Operating Systems 
A smartphone is a small mobile computer with an operating system that 
controls its features and performance, including the screen layout and the 
way it sends and receives data and telephone calls. The most widely used 
smartphone operating systems are Symbian, Windows Mobile, BlackBerry OS, 
Palm OS, and Apple’s OS X for iPhones. Linux-based phones also exist, but 
they’re not common in North America. Each operating system includes a 
slightly different feature set, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses, 
but they all do essentially the same things: They provide the internal software 
that allows a PDA or smartphone to accept, store, and display text, audio, 
images, and other data and to communicate through one or more com-
munication channels.
Late in 2007, Google announced that it planned to introduce its own 
open platform operating system for smartphones, called Android, and it 
invited third-party software developers to create new applications for it. It will 
be at least a year or two before Android-based smartphones (Googlephones?) 
reach any real-world consumers, but when they do, Google will probably offer 
serious competition to Microsoft, Symbian, and the others.
The Palm, BlackBerry, and iPhone operating systems are all designed for 
specific hardware platforms, while Symbian, Windows Mobile, and Linux are 
more flexible; the hardware manufacturers that use them can choose the 
specific set of features and functions that they want to offer in each device 
in their product lines. 
Some smartphones also include a tethered modem feature that connects a 
laptop or other portable computer to the Internet through a cable, using the 
smartphone’s broadband wireless account. This feature is not available on 
every model or through every service provider, but it can be a convenient 
alternative to a separate wireless network adapter card and broadband data 
account. Tethered modem software is supplied with many BlackBerry models, 

Smartphones and PDAs
259
and June Fabrics Technology (http://www.junefabrics.com) offers a similar 
program called PdaNet for Palm OS and Windows Mobile. Depending on 
your service provider, tethering might require an extra cost per month, 
and often it will not be as fast as a dedicated broadband modem (for example, 
EV-DO Rev. A is typically only available as a dedicated device).
Windows Mobile
Microsoft’s Windows Mobile operating system includes built-in support for 
Wi-Fi networks, along with mobile versions of the Microsoft Internet Explorer 
web browser, Windows Media Player, and various office applications. Windows 
Mobile has many design features that are based on the familiar Windows user 
interface; from the onscreen Start button to the layout of many programs, the 
look and feel is easy for Windows users to learn and use. Figure 14-1 shows a 
PDA using Windows Mobile.
Windows Mobile offers all the same basic features as Palm, Symbian, and 
the others, but it also provides support for Microsoft’s Mobile Office programs, 
BlackBerry
BlackBerry is a family of smartphones made by Research In Motion that are 
integrated with data communication software and services. In addition to voice 
telephone service, BlackBerries also offer email, instant text messaging, and 
access to the Internet through Wi-Fi and broadband wireless data networks. 
Depending on the BlackBerry model and the service provider, some devices 
use only the slower GPRS broadband technology, while others support faster 
EV-DO or EDGE networks. If you plan to use your BlackBerry for Internet 
access, it’s best to look for a model that supports fast data transfer.
including customized versions of Word, 
Excel, and PowerPoint, and a mobile 
version of Internet Explorer (shown in 
Figure 14-1). If your business uses Micro-
soft Exchange Server, you can easily use 
a Windows Mobile smartphone to send 
and receive email. Many additional spe-
cialized programs are also available 
through http://www.microsoft.com/
windowsmobile/catalog.
Most new Windows Mobile devices 
include built-in Wi-Fi adapters, and 
many also support one or more broad-
band wireless systems, depending on the 
service provider. You can find a list of 
currently available Windows Mobile 
devices on Microsoft’s Windows Mobile 
website, http://www.microsoft.com/

Chapter 14
Email is the application that made BlackBerry the most popular smart-
phone in the United States. The screen and keyboard are designed to make 
reading and writing messages fast and easy. If you’re a frequent emailer, a 
BlackBerry could be your best choice.
Figure 14-2 shows a typical BlackBerry. Notice that the screen shows the 
signal strength of an EDGE connection in the upper right corner.
BlackBerries are sold and supported by cellular telephone companies 
and broadband wireless service providers around the world. Like other makes 
of mobile devices, it’s best to buy a BlackBerry through a local company 
(either directly or through a retailer or other representative) to be certain 
that it has been optimized for local networks.
Palm
Palm makes two families of smartphones: one group that uses the Microsoft 
Windows Mobile operating system and another that uses the Palm OS that
was originally designed for its handheld Palm PDAs. Smartphones that use 
Palm OS have a screen layout that many users consider sensible and easy to 
use. The core Palm OS includes the usual smartphone functions, but it also 
supports more programs from third-party developers than any other operating 
system. 
Palm OS smartphones are available that support either EV-DO or EDGE 
networks, depending on the service provider that sells each model. For a 
comparison of Palm smartphones, including the US service providers that 
support each one, see Palm’s website at http://www.palm.com/us/products/

parts of the world, go to http://www.palm.com/intl.

Apple iPhone
Apple’s iPhone is a mobile telephone, an iPod multimedia player, a camera, 
and a broadband wireless Internet client, all in a handheld device that uses 
touch-sensitive onscreen icons in place of the traditional push-button keypad 
or keyboard. Figure 14-4 shows several iPhone screen displays.
Photo courtesy of Apple
Figure 14-4: The iPhone combines multiple functions into 
a compact package.
Taken as a package, iPhone offers an impressive set of features and 
functions. The wide-screen (3.5 inch) touch screen display looks good, it 
feels good in your hand, and the various commands and displays are easy to 
use and understand. However, wireless Internet access is probably iPhone’s 
weakest feature. It’s limited to a single service provider in each country, and 
it uses relatively slow EDGE connections when it’s not within range of a 
usable Wi-Fi access point. It’s not possible to unlock an iPhone from the 
designated service provider without canceling the warranty and possibly 
damaging the phone
If you decide that an iPhone offers the best combination of features, or if 
you’re delighted by that nifty touch screen, you can buy one from AT&T (or 
the captive service provider in your country) or directly from Apple. Either 
way you’ll need a voice and broadband account with AT&T Wireless in the 
United States, or with Rogers in Canada, the O2 network in Britain, T-Mobile 
in Germany, or Orange in France (or the service provider that supports the 
iPhone in your country when it becomes available). 
Since the iPhone was introduced in 2007, several other manufacturers 
including Nokia, Hewlett-Packard, and HTC have also created phones that 
use similar touch screen controls, like the one shown in Figure 14-5. If you 
don’t care about all the iPhone features (such as a music and video player), or 
if you want a different set of bundled programs, you might find a less costly 
alternative from another manufacturer. However, Apple has successfully 
marketed the iPhone as the high-status smartphone to own. Even if your 
Nokia or HP smartphone does everything you want it to do including 
cooking breakfast, it might not impress your friends like an iPhone will.

Chapter 14
Symbian
Symbian is jointly owned by half a dozen major mobile telephone manufac-
turers, including Ericsson, Nokia, Panasonic, Samsung, Siemens, and Sony 
Ericsson. The majority of the world’s smartphones use Symbian OS, but it’s 
less common in North America than some other operating systems. Symbian OS 
version 9.5 (the current version in 2007) supports EDGE broadband connec-
tions. Figure 14-6 shows the screen from a smartphone that uses Symbian OS.
Linux
Motorola, NEC, and Samsung are among the long list of mobile phone makers 
who offer smartphones based on Linux in some parts of the world, but only a 
few of these devices have been approved for use in the United States. You can 
find a partial list of Linux smartphones at http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/
AT9423084269.html. Unlike the other smartphone operating systems that each 
has a single set of features and functions, there are several separate groups 
working with Linux. As a result, the screen layouts and command sets of 
Linux smartphones are not always consistent from one hardware manufac-
turer to another.
Another Linux-powered offering is the Internet Tablet series from Nokia. 
While they are not actually smartphones because they contain no cellular tele-
phone hardware, the Nokia tablets have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support and 
can use both hot spots or a tethered phone for Internet access.
Figure 14-7 shows a smartphone that uses Qtopia, a version of Linux devel-
oped by Trolltech. This particular phone was made by Wistron, a Taiwanese 
original design manufacturer (ODM) whose products are rebranded by many 
other companies.

Which Is Best?
Choosing the right smartphone for your needs can be confusing because each 
hardware manufacturer and each operating system offers a different com-
bination of features in a slightly different package. If access to the Internet is 
an important reason to have a smartphone, you can apply the same criteria 
that apply to adapters for laptops and other portable computers: Look for a 
service provider whose coverage footprint includes all the places you’re likely 
to use the device, and look for the fastest possible data transfer speed.
A smartphone is often a compromise between the convenience of a single 
device that works as a telephone and an Internet access device and performs 
several other functions, with the small size and simplicity of a single-purpose 
mobile telephone or PDA. The phone’s software reflects this compromise.
Remember that a broadband wireless network doesn’t care what kind 
of data is moving through it or what kind of client device is sending and 
receiving it. As long as the frames and packets and the radio modulation 
methods meet the Wi-Fi specifications or they’re compatible with the EDGE or 
EV-DO standards, the network will pass it along. So the same technology that 
connects your laptop computer to the Internet today will appear tomorrow 
in embedded modules that perform completely new services. For example, 
home appliances, office machines, and cars will transmit diagnostic infor-
mation to central monitoring centers that will identify problems and dispatch 
a repair technician before the problems become visible to the people using 
those machines. Pollable water and electric meters will allow a public utility’s 
remote data collector to gather billing information without the need to send 
a human meter reader to every account location.
People seem to view smartphones in one of two very different ways: either 
they cannot imagine the need for such a thing, or they embrace them as a 
vital part of their daily lives. Many people who use smartphones say that they 
would never want to give them up. A single pocket-size device that can perform 
all those functions is enough to spoil them for life—or at least until the next 
generation of electronic assistants with even more features comes along. 
On the other hand, as Freud might have said, sometimes a phone is just 
a phone. If telephone calls and maybe the occasional text message are all you 
need, you don’t need the expense and complications of a smartphone.

V I R T U A L  P R I V A T E  N E T W O R K S
The security tools in the Wi-Fi specification 
are not good enough to protect data trans-
mitted through a wireless network. What’s 
the fix? A virtual private network (VPN) can add 
another effective form of security to data that moves 
from a wireless network client to a host that can be 
located anywhere with a network connection.
A VPN uses a data tunnel to connect two points on a network through 
an encrypted channel. The end points can be a single network client and a 
network server, a pair of client computers or other devices, or the gateways 
to a pair of LANs. Data that passes through a public network such as the 
Internet is completely isolated from other network traffic. It uses login and 
password authentication to restrict access to authorized users; it encrypts the 
data to make it unintelligible to intruders who intercept it; and it uses data 
authentication to maintain the integrity of each data packet and to assure 
that all data originates with legitimate network clients.

266
Chapter 15
NOTE
VPN functions occur at the IP or network layer of the ISO model. Therefore, they can 
operate on top of the Wi-Fi or other wireless protocols, which operate at the physical 
layer. VPNs can also pass data across a network connection that includes more than 
one physical medium (for example, a wireless link that passes data onward to a wired 
Ethernet network). In other words, a VPN is an end-to-end service; it doesn’t matter 
whether data uses a wireless link, an Ethernet cable, an ordinary telephone line, or 
some combination of those and other transmission media. This adds another level of 
security to (or provides an alternative to) WEP or WPA encryption, which only applies 
to the wireless portion of the network.
In a traditional VPN, a remote user can log in to a distant LAN and 
obtain all the same network services that are available to local clients. VPNs 
are commonly used to extend corporate networks to branch offices and to 
connect users to the LAN from home or from off-site locations such as a 
client or customer’s office.
A connection through a VPN server presents the same appearance to the 
rest of the network as a client device connected directly to the LAN. The only 
difference is that the data from the VPN passes through a VPN driver and a 
public network instead of moving directly from the network adapter to the 
LAN. Figure 15-1 shows a typical VPN connection to a remote network.
Figure 15-1: A remote network can connect to a LAN through a VPN.
All of the same security benefits also apply to a short-range VPN that 
tunnels through a wireless link and a longer-range VPN that starts on a 
wireless network and relays the data to a remote server. These are two 
different uses for a VPN: a local VPN that only extends across the wireless 
portion of a network between the client devices and the access point and 
an extended network that carries VPN-encoded data beyond the access points 
to a VPN server through a public network, such as the Internet or a dial-up 
telephone connection.
An extended network is a traditional VPN that happens to originate 
from a wireless network client. The same VPN can also support connections

that don’t include a wireless segment and logins from public wireless services, 
such as the ones at airports or coffee shops. This is the conventional way to 
use a VPN.
Local, short-range VPNs are interesting to people who operate wireless 
networks because they add another layer of security to wireless links. Because 
the data moving between wireless clients and the network access point is 
encrypted (using an algorithm that is more secure than WPA encryption), 
it is unintelligible to any third party who might be monitoring the radio 
signal; because the VPN server at the access point won’t accept data links 
from wireless clients that are not using the correct VPN drivers and passwords, 
an intruder can’t break into the network by associating a rogue client with 
the access point.
The goal of a wireless VPN is to protect the wireless link between the 
clients and the access point and to lock out unauthorized users. Therefore, 
the isolated and encrypted data can only move across a single room rather 
than hundreds or thousands of miles. Of course, the access point might also 
relay VPN-encoded data onward through the Internet to a network host in 
another location.
Figure 15-2 shows a wireless connection to a VPN. The VPN server is 
located between the wireless access point and the host LAN, so all of the 
packets that move through the wireless portion of the network are encoded. 
For clarity, the diagram shows the VPN server as a separate component, but 
the most practical way to add VPN security to a wireless LAN is to use a router 
or gateway that incorporates VPN support. VPN-enabled routers are available 
from several vendors, including Cisco, NETGEAR, and TRENDnet.

VPN Methods
A VPN moves data through one or more intermediate networks to a destina-
tion on another network. The VPN’s tunneling client encapsulates the existing 
data packets or frames by adding a new header with the routing information 
that instructs them how to reach the end point of the VPN. The transmission 
path through the intermediate networks is called a tunnel. At the other end 
of the tunnel, the VPN server removes the tunneling header and forwards 
the data to the destination specified by the next layer of headers. The exact 
form of the tunnel doesn’t make any difference to the data because the data 
treats the tunnel as a point-to-point connection.
The tunneling headers can take several forms. The methods used most 
widely in VPNs are Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), Layer Two 
Tunneling Protocol (L2TP), and IP Security (IPsec) mode. PPTP and L2TP 
can move data through IP, IPX, and NetBEUI networks; IPsec is limited to IP 
networks. Both the client and the server must use the same protocol.
In PPTP and L2TP, the client and server must configure the tunnel for 
each transmission before they begin to exchange data. The configuration 
parameters include the route through the intermediate network and the 
encryption and compression specifications. When the transmission is com-
plete, the client and server terminate the connection and close the tunnel. 
Unfortunately, several data security analysts have identified significant flaws 
in PPTP that can allow intruders to break into a VPN based on PPTP and 
sniff passwords, decode encryption, read data, or inflict damage to a network 
server. Therefore, PPTP headers are not secure and should not be used.
In an IPsec network link, the client and server must establish the tunnel 
through the intermediate networks in a separate transaction before they 
begin to exchange data.
Both L2TP and IPsec offer specific advantages and disadvantages, but 
they’re both good enough to create a secure link between a wireless network 
client and an access point. The differences among the three are technical 
rather than practical. You can find an excellent explanation of the internal 
operation of all three protocols in Microsoft’s white paper entitled Virtual 
Private Networking in Windows 2000: An Overview, which is available online at 
http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/docs/VPNoverview.doc (but remember 
that the flaws in PPTP networks were identified after that white paper was 
written). 
VPN Servers
A VPN server (or host) can be part of a Unix or Windows server, or it can be 
built into a stand-alone network router or gateway. If your network already 
uses a separate computer as a dedicated server, you can use that computer as 
the VPN server. A separate piece of hardware might be a better choice if your 
network does not already have a full-blown network server.

Virtual Private Networks
269
Dozens of VPN equipment makers offer routers, gateways, and other 
products that support one or more of the VPN protocols. Each of these prod-
ucts has a different feature set, so it’s essential to test the specific combination 
of client and server that you intend to use on your own network before you 
commit to them. The Virtual Private Network Consortium (VPNC) is moving 
toward a set of interoperability tests and certification standards (much like 
the Wi-Fi standards for wireless Ethernet equipment). The VPNC website, 
http://www.vpnc.org, lists the products that have passed the interoperability 
tests, and it also provides links to sources of information about a long list of 
VPN products.
Configuring a Windows Server for a Wireless VPN
If you’re committed to using a Windows server, you can use either L2TP or 
IPsec with Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008; if your server runs 
the older Windows NT Server 4.0 or Windows 2000 Server software, you’re 
limited to L2TP (or the seriously flawed PPTP). The server also requires two 
network interface cards: one connected to the wired LAN or the Internet 
gateway and the other connected to the wireless network. The interface card 
that is connected to the wireless port normally connects directly to the wire-
less access point’s Ethernet port. The exact process of installing an L2TP 
host on a Windows server is slightly different in each version of Windows, but 
the general steps are the same. For specific information about configuring a 
particular operating system, consult the online Help screens and Microsoft’s 
Resource Kit and other online documentation for your server’s operating 
system. The following sections describe the configuration steps in general 
terms.
NOTE
For more information about deploying and using VPNs with Microsoft servers, see the 
Microsoft TechNet articles linked from http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/
network/bb545442.aspx.
Configure the Connection to the Wired Network
The link to the LAN or other network is a dedicated connection through a 
network adapter. The network connection profile for this connection must 
include the IP address and subnet mask assigned to this connection and the 
default gateway address assigned to the network gateway.
Configure the VPN Connection
The VPN connection is usually an Ethernet link to one or more access 
points. The connection profile on the server for the VPN connection must 
include the IP address and subnet mask assigned to this port and the addresses 
of the DNS and WINS name servers used by this network.
Configure the Remote Access Server as a Router
The server must use either static routes or routing protocols that make each 
wireless client reachable from the wired network.

270
Chapter 15
Enable and Configure the Server for L2TP Clients
Windows uses Remote Access Service (RAS) and Point-to-Point Protocol 
(PPP) to establish VPN connections. The Routing and Remote Access service 
enables RAS. A VPN connection requires these RAS configuration options:
Authentication Method
Encrypted PPTP connections use the MS-CHAP 
or EAP-TLS authentication methods.
Authentication Provider
Either Windows 2000 security or an external 
RADIUS server can verify network clients.
IP Routing
IP Routing and IP-based remote access must be active. If 
the wired network acts as a DHCP server for the wireless clients, DHCP 
must be active. 
Configure L2TP Ports
Set each L2TP port to accept remote access. 
Configure Network Filters
Input and output filters keep the remote access server from sending and 
receiving data that does not originate at a VPN client. These filters will reject 
data to or from unauthorized users, so those intruders will not be able to 
obtain an Internet connection (or a connection to the wired LAN) through 
the wireless network.
Configure Remote Access Policies
The remote access permission for each wireless client must be set to allow 
access to the RAS server. The port type must be set to the correct VPN 
protocol (e.g., PPTP or L2TP), and the profile for each connection must 
include the type of encryption in use. In Windows, the three encryption 
strength options are:
Basic
Uses a 40-bit encryption key
Strong
Uses a 56-bit encryption key
Strongest
Uses a 128-bit encryption key
VPN Servers for Unix
All of the BSD variations (including FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and 
Mac OS X) include an IPsec VPN client and server as part of the release 
package.
Linux FreeS/WAN is the most popular implementation of IPsec for 
Linux. Go to http://www.freeswan.org for downloads, documentation, and 
access to the community of FreeS/WAN users.
OpenVPN is an SSL-based VPN solution for Linux, BSD, OS X, and 
Windows. It is easy to configure and offers both routed VPN (traffic to

Virtual Private Networks
271
specific destinations is sent through the VPN) and tunneled virtual inter-
faces (emulating a physical layer Ethernet device, which can pass non-IP 
traffic through the VPN). OpenVPN can be found at http://openvpn.net.
If you are using a Linux firewall, you might want to consider VPN 
Masquerade. Linux uses the IP Masquerade function in the Linux kernel 
to share a single connection to the Internet among multiple clients. VPN 
Masquerade is the section of IP Masquerade that supports IPsec clients. The 
HOWTO for Linux VPN Masquerade is at http://tldp.org/HOWTO/VPN-
Masquerade-HOWTO.html.
Network Hardware with Built-in VPN Support
A dedicated computer running Linux or one of the BSD versions of Unix 
can be an inexpensive VPN server; if you’re using a Windows server for other 
purposes, it can also provide VPN support at little or no additional cost. But a 
full-size network server is often a bigger and more complicated solution to a 
relatively simple problem. They’re not always the best choice. Many switches, 
routers, gateways, and firewall devices also include VPN support. Cisco, 3COM, 
Intel, and many other manufacturers make VPN products that are often 
easier to install and maintain than a separate computer. 
In a wireless network, the VPN server does not need all the same bells 
and whistles as a server in a larger corporate network. As Figure 15-3 shows, a 
router located between the wireless access point and the wired portion of an 
enterprise network can easily double as a VPN server. In a home network, the 
VPN server can operate between the access point and a DSL or cable modem.
Figure 15-3: A network router can also act as a VPN server for a wireless network.
Stand-alone VPN client hardware that sits between the computer and 
the network is also available, but it’s not as practical in a wireless network 
because the wireless network adapter is almost always plugged directly into 
the computer itself.

VPN Client Software
A wireless client connects to a VPN server through its wireless Ethernet 
link to the network access point, which the operating system sees as a LAN 
connection. To set up a VPN tunnel through that connection, you must 
install the tunneling protocol as a network service.
Configuring Windows for VPN
Windows XP and Vista include support for VPNs, but it’s not part of the 
default installation, so the first step in setting up a VPN client is to install 
the protocol. 
In Windows XP and Windows Vista, a wizard makes the whole process 
easy. In XP, follow these steps to set up a VPN connection:
1.
From the Control Panel, open Network Connections.
2.
Double-click the New Connection Wizard icon.
3.
When the Network Connection Type window shown in Figure 15-4 
appears, choose the Connect to the network at my workplace option.
Figure 15-4: The option for creating a VPN link specifies connecting to a workplace 
network, but it also applies to a wireless VPN.

If you want to test the connection, click the Next button. If you don’t 
want to connect, select the Don’t connect now option and click Next. 
The wizard will ask for your name and password.
10. Type the name and password you use for this VPN account. If you 
want your computer to automatically send your password, turn on the 
Remember this password option. Click the Create button to establish 
the VPN connection and close the wizard.
To create a shortcut to a VPN on your desktop in Windows, follow 
these steps:
1.
In XP, open the Control Panel and choose Network Connections. In 
Vista, open the Control Panel, choose the Network and Sharing Center, 
and select Manage Network Connections from the list of Tasks.
2.
From the Network Connections window, right-click the icon or listing for 
the VPN and choose Create Shortcut from the pop-up menu. 
3.
A pop-up window will ask if you want to place the shortcut on the desk-
top. Click the Yes button. A shortcut will appear on the desktop.
The Microsoft L2TP/IPsec VPN Client
Microsoft includes a client for Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) connec-
tions with Internet Protocol security (IPsec) in Windows 2000, Windows XP, 
and Windows Vista. A similar client program for Windows 98, Windows Me, and 
Windows NT Workstation 4.0 is available for free download from http://

Making the Connection in Windows
When the VPN connection profile is in place, it’s easy to connect a Windows 
client to the host LAN or the Internet through the wireless VPN link: Just 
double-click the icon for the connection profile. Windows will ask for a login 
and password and then make the connection.
If your wireless connection is the method you use most often to connect 
to the Internet, you can make it the default connection, which will open 
whenever you run a network application such as a web browser or email 
client program. To make the VPN profile the default, follow these steps:
1.
Open the Internet Properties window from the Control Panel.
2.
Select the Connections tab.

3.
In the Dial-Up Settings section, select the VPN connection profile from 
the list and click the Set Default button.
4.
Click the Settings button. In the Dial-Up Settings section, type your login 
and password on the VPN server. 
5.
Choose the Dial whenever a network connection is not present option.
Windows XP Options
Windows XP and Windows Vista offer many VPN options that were not 
available in earlier versions of Windows. To set these options, follow these 
steps:
1.
Open the Network Connections window from the Control Panel. If you 
have a shortcut to your VPN connection on the desktop, you can skip 
this step.

The Options and Security tabs in the VPN to Internet Properties window 
control connection options that normally don’t change from the default 
settings. Network managers who want to change the security settings should 
instruct their users how to configure these options to comply with the net-
work’s specific requirements. 
VPN Clients for Unix
Using a VPN client on a computer running Unix is more complicated than 
running a VPN from a Windows machine because the client is not integrated 
into the kernel. Therefore, you must find a client program that works with 
the version of Unix and the VPN protocol you are trying to use. No single 
program offers a universal VPN client, and some combinations, such as PPTP 
on BSD Unix versions, don’t seem to exist at all.

For information about NetBSD IPsec, take a look at http://www.netbsd
.org/Documentation/network/ipsec.
Using a Wireless VPN
When you design a VPN to protect the data on your network as it passes 
through the wireless link, it’s important to understand exactly where the end 
points of the VPN tunnel are located. If the VPN only tunnels through the 
wireless link, as shown in Figure 15-14, the network will look exactly the same 
as it does without a VPN. 
Figure 15-14: A wireless VPN with the server at the access point protects data through 
the wireless link, but it does not extend the network.
If the VPN extends beyond the wireless access points to pass through a 
wide area network (such as the Internet), like the one in Figure 15-15, the 
wireless network client can appear to be part of a LAN in another building 
or halfway across the continent.
So how far should your wireless VPN extend? It depends on what you 
want the network to accomplish. If your wireless network is in place to support 
laptop and other portable computers at your office, factory, or campus, it 
makes sense to place the server between the network of access points and the 
Laptop with VPN client

connection to your corporate LAN. This will protect your wireless users’ data 
and keep unauthorized users off the network, but it won’t affect the other 
users whose computers connect to the LAN through cables.
Figure 15-15: A VPN can include both the wireless link and an intercity connection through 
the Internet to a corporate network.
At home or in a small business network, the access points probably con-
nect to an Internet gateway router that provides Internet access to all the 
computers in the office or the house. If the access point and the gateway are 
separate devices, you can place the VPN server between the two. If the access 
point and gateway are combined in the same box, you’ll either have to use 
VPN clients on all your computers, including the desktop machines that are 
hardwired to the gateway, and place the client between the gateway and the 
Internet modem like the network in Figure 15-16, or you’ll have to ignore the 
wired Ethernet ports on the gateway and add a new hub or switch between 
the VPN server and the Internet modem, as shown in Figure 15-17.
Figure 15-16: In a small LAN, you can use VPN clients on every computer.

Making the Connection
If you use the wireless LAN with VPN protection most of the time, you should 
make the VPN profile your default connection. Whenever you run a network 
application, the computer will try to connect through the VPN unless you 
open a different connection (such as a dial-up telephone line) first. 
To set a connection profile as the default in Windows, open the Network 
Connections window. Right-click the icon for the profile you want to choose, 
and select the Set as default option from the menu.
To connect to a VPN that isn’t your default, double-click the icon for 
the VPN’s connection profile. You will see a login window like the one in 
Figure 15-18. Type your name and password, and click the Connect button. 
If the VPN server recognizes your account, it will set up the connection.

Bypassing the VPN
Even though you normally use a VPN to protect your wireless data, you might 
sometimes want to send data in the clear without using the VPN. For example, 
you might use a local VPN at your own office or at home between your com-
puter and your Internet gateway router, but when you use the same computer 
at an airport or a coffee shop, or some other location that isn’t protected by a 
VPN, you can use the same computer and network adapter to connect directly 
to the Internet. 
If you’re a network manager, you might occasionally have to change your 
Wi-Fi network’s internal settings. The configuration programs that control 
the Wi-Fi network’s operating channel, SSID, and other options are web-
based utilities that originate on the access point. Because the access point 
is inside the VPN tunnel, it is not possible to send commands to the access 
point through the VPN. It’s important to remember that you can use a VPN 
when you need it and bypass it when you want to make a direct connection. 
Using a VPN Through a Public Network
When you connect your laptop to your corporate LAN through a public net-
work at an airport or in a conference center, or if you’re using a broadband 
wireless service, you can connect through their network to the Internet and 
onward to your corporate VPN server. Because you will have to log in to the 
public network before you initiate the VPN connection, you should create a 
separate VPN via Public Network connection profile in addition to the one you 
use from your own office. The profile should point to your corporate VPN 
server, but it should not be your default connection.
To connect through a public network on a computer running Windows, 
follow these steps:
1.
Turn on the computer with the wireless network adapter in place.
2.
Use your wireless configuration utility to select the public network you 
want to use.
3.
Start Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, or some other web browser. 
You will see the public network’s login screen.
4.
If the computer doesn’t do it automatically, enter your account name 
and password. The public network will acknowledge your login.
5.
Minimize the browser window and open the Network Connections win-
dow or find the VPN shortcut on your desktop.
6.
Double-click the icon for your VPN via Public Network profile. The com-
puter will connect through the Internet to your corporate LAN.
7.
Enter the login and password for your corporate network.
If this procedure doesn’t work for your VPN, ask your network manager 
for help.

Chapter 15
VPNs are an important part of many networks’ security plans for off-site 
users. When a VPN is up and running, it’s also an extremely convenient way 
to connect to your LAN. With just a few keystrokes or mouse clicks, you can 
establish the same access to your network resources from anywhere with 
Internet access that you can get from your own office. If any Internet tech-
nique can eliminate the apparent distance between you and your LAN, your 
office, and your colleagues, a VPN is that technique.

For more than a century, a dedicated 
collection of cables, switches, and radio 
links known as the public switched telephone 
network (PSTN) has connected the world’s 
telephones. When you place a telephone call, the 
PSTN creates a direct link between your phone and 
the phone assigned to the unique telephone number you requested. The 
telephone industry calls this kind of basic connection POTS (plain old tele-
phone service, pronounced like pots and pans). The Internet is a separate 
system that uses a different set of rules and methods to connect computers 
to one another. Computer data (including digital audio) does not require a 
continuous connection, so Internet connections can use packet switching 
(as described in Chapter 1) to move data more quickly and more efficiently 
than the older PSTN. 
When you connect a telephone or a microphone to a computer and 
convert the sound of your voice to a sequence of digital packets, you can 
send those packets through the Internet to a specific destination, where the 
recipient’s computer converts the packets back into an analog audio stream 

286
Chapter 16
and plays the audio through a speaker or a telephone handset. The tech-
nology that moves voice communication through the Internet is known as 
VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol).
If the recipient of your call has a computer connected to the Internet, 
you can completely bypass the PSTN and route the call through the Internet, 
using the recipient’s Internet address to identify the call’s destination. But 
it’s also possible to transfer a call between the Internet and the PSTN in either 
direction. You can originate a call on the Internet and direct it to the PSTN, 
or you can use your POTS line to call a phone attached to a computer.
There are several possible ways to use VoIP:
 Place a computer-to-computer call entirely through the Internet.
 Originate a call on a computer connected to the Internet and transfer it 
to the PSTN as close to the destination as possible, then complete the 
call to the recipient’s telephone line.
 Originate a call on a telephone line and call a local VoIP service pro-
vider, then connect through the Internet to the recipient’s computer.
 Originate a call on a telephone line, connect to a local VoIP provider, 
then connect the call through the Internet to a distant VoIP center, where 
it transfers back to the PSTN and on to the recipient’s telephone line.
VoIP offers several possible advantages over calling through the tradi-
tional telephone system. First, it’s often significantly cheaper because there 
are no toll charges for long distance calls. Second, in places where telephone 
service is not reliable, the Internet’s error-correcting packet data switching 
can sometimes provide connections with better sound and fewer dropped 
calls than a bad telephone line (but the emphasis is on sometimes—just as 
often, a POTS call will be clearer than VoIP). And third, it’s possible to use 
VoIP through a Wi-Fi or broadband wireless link in places where a conven-
tional telephone line or mobile telephone signal might not be available. 
On the other hand, VoIP is often less reliable and less consistent than 
the PSTN because VoIP packets (and other live audio or video streams) can 
be interrupted or delayed by all the sources of interference and noise that 
other data ignores. It makes no difference if your email message takes several 
minutes to arrive, but you expect a phone call to reach its recipient right now. 
And the sound quality of VoIP calls can sometimes be noticeably worse than 
a call through the PSTN. In practice, the reduced cost of long distance calls 
is generally the most compelling reason to use VoIP.
Dozens of service providers offer local or long distance telephone services 
that use VoIP instead of the old PSTN. Some are marketed as alternatives 
to the local dial tone company, others are low-cost worldwide long distance 
services, and still others offer a local telephone number in one or more distant 
locations, so people who call you don’t have to pay long distance charges. 
You can find directories and user reviews of VoIP services at several web-
sites, including http://www.voipreview.org, http://www.voip-info.org, and 
http://www.voipmonitor.net/VoIP+Providers.aspx.

There are two important safety issues related to VoIP telephone calls. Even if your VoIP 
phone or portable computer runs on batteries, the access point and the Internet gateway 
almost certainly use domestic AC power; if your electricity fails, you won’t be able to use 
your VoIP telephone, but a conventional telephone will probably continue to work. And 
VoIP networks create special challenges when you call 911 (or the comparable telephone 
number in your country) in an emergency because a VoIP call to 911 might not connect 
you to the nearest Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP), or if it does, it might not 
accurately transmit your telephone number and address to the PSAP operator. 
There are many ways to use VoIP, but this is a book about broadband 
wireless, so we’ll limit this discussion to VoIP services that use Wi-Fi or broad-
band data services to connect to the Internet. These services fall into two 
categories: software and services that allow a user to originate telephone 
calls from a portable computer or PDA using Wi-Fi or broadband wireless 
data networks, and wireless voice over Wi-Fi telephones that use Wi-Fi links 
to send and receive VoIP calls through the Internet. You don’t need Wi-Fi 
or broadband wireless to use VoIP, but if wireless is part of your arsenal of 
Internet connection tools, you should know that VoIP is available and that 
the two technologies can work together.
VoIP over Broadband Wireless and WiMAX
Any VoIP service that can place telephone calls through the Internet can 
use a portable computer with a broadband wireless connection to originate 
those calls. 
In general, the process goes something like this:
1.
Attach a microphone and a speaker or earpiece to the computer (or use 
the computer’s internal microphone and speakers).
2.
Open up a wireless connection to the Internet. 
3.
Use a web browser or the wireless service provider’s control program to 
log in. 
4.
Use the VoIP service provider’s software to place a telephone call.
After the computer has established its connection to the Internet, the 
VoIP software treats the connection just like any other Internet link. For 
example, Figure 16-1 shows the Skype calling screens for Windows, Macintosh, 
and Linux. To place a call to a telephone number, choose the Call Phones or 
Dial tab, click the green telephone button to connect to Skype, and either 
type a telephone number or use your mouse to enter the number on the 
onscreen keypad. You can sign up for a Skype account and download the 
software at http://www.skype.com.
Skype’s software also includes a personal telephone directory, so you 
can use the program’s Contacts list to place a call without reentering the 
telephone number.

Vonage (http://www.vonage.com) offers a similar service, but it uses a 
special USB flash drive (shown in Figure 16-2) preloaded with its calling soft-
ware, along with a socket for a microphone and stereo earpiece. To place a 
call, insert the flash drive into a USB socket, put the earbuds into your ears, 
and wait for the Vonage Talk software to start.
Figure 16-2: Vonage’s USB flash drive includes calling software and an earpiece 
microphone cable.

Many other VoIP service providers offer similar services. Each of them 
has organized its call origination software differently and each has a different 
pricing plan, so you might want to compare several before you commit to a 
long-term subscription. The reviews at http://www.voipreview.org can tell you 
about other users’ experiences with many providers.
To receive calls through your VoIP account, you must choose an area code 
and telephone number from your VoIP service provider’s website and follow 
their instructions for setting up an inbound account. A VoIP telephone 
number is just like any other phone number, so anybody with a telephone 
can use that number to call you. Most service providers either charge a flat 
rate for unlimited inbound calls, or they charge a few pennies per minute 
or per call.
You don’t have to choose a telephone number based in your local area 
code or even in your own country. If you have customers or friends (or both) 
in a distant location, you can choose one or more numbers that allow them 
to reach you with a local call. For example, if you live in California, and you 
have family in Hong Kong, England, and Canada, you could choose local 
telephone numbers for your VoIP account based in Hong Kong, London, 
and Vancouver and allow your relatives to reach you without the need to 
place expensive international long distance calls. 
Remember that you can only receive incoming calls through a wireless 
link when the link is active. Unlike a wired DSL or cable modem connection, 
your Wi-Fi or broadband data connection is only alive when the wireless con-
trol program is running. Therefore, if you expect to receive calls to your 
VoIP number, you will probably want to subscribe to your service provider’s 
voicemail service.
NOTE
Be sure to compare the real cost of VoIP service to your existing cell phone charges. If you 
already have both a mobile telephone and a broadband data account from the same 
service provider, there might not be any real advantage to using VoIP instead of your 
mobile phone. The mobile service provider uses the same base stations for both services, 
so you probably won’t find wireless data coverage in places where your phone doesn’t 
work. And if your mobile telephone billing plan includes long distance calls at no extra 
cost, VoIP might not offer any real savings.
Voice over Wi-Fi
Wi-Fi phones are cordless telephones that communicate with Wi-Fi access 
points or hot spots and VoIP to send and receive calls through the Internet. 
When you combine a VoIP telephone instrument and a VoIP account with a 
Wi-Fi network, you can create a telephone connection that does not require 
a dedicated telephone line or cellular telephone account. You also get a truly 
ugly abbreviation: either VoWiFi or wVoIP, depending on where you look.
Most VoIP services use the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) specification 
to control Internet telephone calls and other multimedia services. SIP is 
comparable to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that controls the 
World Wide Web. A VoWiFi telephone must either support SIP or connect to 

290
Chapter 16
a computer or router that supports SIP. A VoWiFi telephone call uses SIP to 
control a wireless telephone that sends and receives calls through a Wi-Fi 
base station that is connected to the Internet. Among other things, the SIP 
configuration settings specify the IP address of your VoIP service provider 
and the telephone number assigned to your VoIP account.
Figure 16-3 shows typical VoWiFi connections using a D-Link VoIP phone. 
The wireless telephone uses a Wi-Fi link at home or on the road to connect 
to a VoIP service provider through the Internet, and the service provider 
relays the call to a VoIP subscriber or a PSTN telephone number.
Skype is among the first VoIP providers to offer VoWiFi telephones. The 
NETGEAR SPH101 Wi-Fi Phone (shown in Figure 16-4) and similar phones 
made by SMC, Belkin, Linksys, and Panasonic connect to the Internet through 
a Wi-Fi access point, and they use Skype’s VoIP network to send and receive 
telephone calls. 
The Nokia N800 Internet Tablet (shown in Figure 16-5) combines a 
VoWiFi telephone with a web browser, media player, and a client for email 
and instant messaging. The Skype subscription associated with the Wi-Fi 
Phone includes free calls to other Skype users and very low cost calls to 
conventional telephones.
Other VoIP networks, including BroadVoice (http://www.broadvoice.com), 
also offer preconfigured VoWiFi phones. Other phones are not limited to a 
single VoIP service. These phones have SIP configuration screens that allow 
a user to specify the VoIP service provider, account information, and other 
settings, either through the phone’s keypad or from a computer connected 
to the phone through a USB port.

For example, Figure 16-6 shows the SIP Settings web screen for the D-Link 
DPH-540S VoIP Phone. Every make and model of VoIP phone seems to 
organize the configuration screens differently, so you’ll have to consult the 
user’s manual for specific instructions that apply to your phone. Your VoIP 
service provider will supply the specific information needed in each config-
uration field. 
Figure 16-6: The SIP Settings screen contains the information your VoIP 
phone needs to connect to a specific service provider.

Chapter 16
NOTE
When you’re evaluating VoIP service providers for use with a VoWiFi phone, be sure 
that the service provider does not require a web-based login because you won’t be able to 
log in to the service using your phone. Another downside to VoWiFi phones is that you 
will be unable to use Wi-Fi networks that require a web-based login, including many 
hot spots in airports and hotels.
In most cases, placing VoIP telephone calls through your computer or a 
VoWiFi phone is not a good enough reason to set up a new Wi-Fi access point 
or a broadband wireless data account, but if you already have some kind of 
wireless connection, VoIP might be a handy supplement to email, instant 
messaging, and other Internet communications channels. If you don’t carry 
a conventional mobile phone along with your laptop computer or PDA, VoIP 
can provide a convenient and inexpensive way to send and receive telephone 
calls when you’re within range of a Wi-Fi signal.

When everything in your wireless network 
connection is working properly, you won’t 
even know it’s there—just fire up the wireless 
network adapter and go online. Plug and play, 
right? Don’t hold your breath.
Like everything else related to computers, wireless networking works just 
fine when everything is set up correctly. But that essential setting is often 
hidden under three layers of windows, screens, and dialog boxes. If some 
obscure configuration option is wrong, the network connection won’t work 
properly, if at all. This chapter contains descriptions of common problems 
and advice for solving them. 
My computer doesn’t detect my network adapter.
Windows should automatically detect a PCMCIA or USB adapter when you 
connect the adapter to the computer or when you turn on the computer with 
the adapter already connected. If you’re using a PC Card, you should hear a 
boo-deep sound when the PCMCIA controller detects it, and the system tray 
(next to the clock) should show a PC Card icon like the one in Figure 17-1. 

294
Chapter 17
Figure 17-1: The PC Card icon 
appears when a device in the 
computer’s PCMCIA slot is active.
If Windows doesn’t detect a PC Card or USB device, try removing and 
replacing the card or unplugging and reconnecting the USB connector. If 
it’s a PC Card, make sure the card is firmly seated in its socket. If it’s a USB 
adapter, disconnect any other USB devices that are connected to the same 
computer and try connecting the wireless adapter again. If the adapter 
works, connect the other USB devices one at a time; if connecting another 
USB device kills the wireless adapter, the two devices are competing with 
each other for the same resources.
Try connecting a USB adapter to a different USB connector. The problem 
might be a bad internal connection to the first USB socket.
If Windows does not automatically recognize your network adapter, it 
probably can’t find the right driver, either for your PCMCIA socket or for 
the adapter itself. The Device Manager (as shown in Figure 17-2) will display 
an icon with a yellow exclamation point or a red X for any device that is cur-
rently not working properly. Right-click the listing with the exclamation point 
or X, and choose Properties from the menu to restore the device or reinstall 
the driver.
Figure 17-2: The Device Manager identifies devices that 
are not working properly. There’s a red X over the icon 
next to the listing for the ORiNOCO Wireless LAN card.

Tips and Troubleshooting
295
If there is no listing for the PCMCIA socket or the network adapter, 
install a driver from the disk that was supplied with the adapter, or download 
a new driver from the manufacturer’s website.
In Linux, the PC Card requires PCMCIA services and Wireless Extensions. 
In Unix, you must install the specific driver for your network adapter. After 
connecting your device, use dmesg to view the kernel logs, which will indicate 
whether or not the device was properly detected. For CardBus cards (but not 
PCMCIA cards), lspci should show the device and information about the 
type of drivers it needs. For USB cards, lsusb will display all detected USB 
devices and provide information about them.
If you’re using a laptop computer, confirm that wireless operation is 
turned on. Check both the hardware switch and the software controls in 
your wireless configuration and control program. 
The wireless control program tries to run, even if I’m not 
using my adapter.
Some wireless configuration and control programs automatically try to load 
every time you start your computer. Running the wireless programs at startup 
is fine for a desktop computer that uses them to connect to a LAN all the 
time, but it makes less sense on a laptop computer that often operates with-
out a wireless network connection.
To remove the autostart function, follow these steps:
1.
From the Start menu in Windows, choose Run.
2.
Type msconfig in the Open field and click the OK button.
3.
Select the Startup tab to display a list of programs that automatically run 
every time you start Windows.
4.
Find the entry in the list for the wireless configuration program, and 
remove the checkmark from the box on the same line. 
5.
Most Windows systems have several other unnecessary programs that 
start automatically. While you have the program open, look for other 
programs that you don’t need to open at startup and disable them. 
6.
Click the OK button and restart your computer when Windows asks you 
to do so. 
If you have removed several programs from the Startup list, you will 
probably notice that Windows starts a lot faster than it did before.
Even though the configuration program no longer runs every time you 
run Windows, you can start the program when you need it. You will probably 
see a shortcut to one or more wireless programs on your desktop or in the 
Program menu.

Chapter 17
My computer won’t associate with the local network.
If you can’t find the network, check these items:
 Confirm that the wireless network adapter PC Card is firmly inserted into 
the PCMCIA socket.
 Confirm that the cable between the USB adapter and the computer is 
plugged in at both ends.
 If you are using an access point, confirm that your network adapter is 
configured as an infrastructure network; if you are trying to link directly 
to another wireless adapter, confirm that both systems are configured for 
an ad hoc network.
 Confirm that you are using the correct encryption key. 
 Confirm that the IP address setting is correct. If the access point or some 
other DHCP server automatically assigns IP addresses, confirm that the 
computer’s TCP/IP settings are set to obtain an address automatically.
 Test with encryption and authentication turned off, then be sure to enable 
them again when you are finished.
My computer connects to the wrong network.
In an environment where signals from more than one wireless network are 
within range of the radio in a network adapter, the adapter will detect all 
of them. If the SSID option is set to join ANY network, the client will auto-
matically associate with the strongest local signal; if the configuration program 
includes a list of two or more SSIDs, it will search for SSIDs in the order 
specified by the list.
To configure your computer to join a specific network, change the list of 
preferred networks in the wireless configuration program, and change the 
name of the workgroup. Both the SSID and the workgroup should match the 
SSID of the access point you want to use. 
If another network in the area uses the same SSID as yours, the wireless 
control software will assume it’s part of your network. Change your SSID to 
something unique. 
To change the workgroup name in Windows XP, follow these steps:
1.
Open the System window from the Control Panel.
2.
Choose the Computer Name tab.
3.
Click the Change button.

Tips and Troubleshooting
297
I can see the local network, but I can’t connect to the Internet.
Most LANs use a gateway server to convert the internal IP addresses that are 
used within the LAN to a separate IP address that identifies this network to 
the Internet. To establish an Internet connection, your computer’s TCP/IP 
network configuration settings must specify the addresses of the gateway and 
one or more DNS servers.
Check that your computer has received an address by following these 
steps:
1.
Open a command prompt (run cmd).
2.
Look at the network configuration with ipconfig /all.
3.
Reinitialize DHCP (request a new address) with ipconfig /release and 
ipconfig /renew.
I can see the Internet, but I can’t see other computers on 
my LAN.
Some firewall programs normally block inbound attempts to view files and 
directories. This prevents unauthorized access to your computer, but it also 
blocks other computers on the LAN unless you specifically allow access from 
those computers (using their IP addresses). The firewall controls should 
include a function where you can identify trusted computers or allow local 
access (it’s different for each firewall program); consult the firewall program’s 
documentation for specific instructions. 
If the firewall isn’t blocking access, it’s possible that the computer 
you’re trying to reach is not configured properly, the access point doesn’t 
recognize that computer’s MAC address, or the other computer has filesharing 
turned off.
The signal strength is weak or signal quality is low.
Assuming there’s an access point close to your computer, a weak signal is 
probably caused by some kind of obstruction between your network adapter 
and the access point. To improve the signal quality and signal strength, try 
moving the adapter (and the computer if the adapter is on a PC Card) to a 
different location. The wavelength of radio signals at 2.4 GHz is extremely 
short (they’re called microwaves for a reason!), so moving the adapter even 
a short distance can be enough to make a noticeable difference.
If you’re using a USB adapter, you can be more flexible about its location. 
Try placing the adapter on top of a bookcase or in some other location with a 
clean shot to the access point. And try turning the adapter (or the external 
antenna) sideways so it’s on its side rather than upright; this might bring the 
polarity of the adapter’s antenna closer to the polarity of the antenna in the 
access point.

298
Chapter 17
I can’t find a public network.
Before your computer can connect to a public wireless network, your network 
adapter must associate itself with that network’s access point. If the adapter 
doesn’t automatically join the network, check these configuration settings:
 Confirm that the TCP/IP settings are configured to accept an IP address 
from a DHCP server.
 Run your web browser before you try to use some other Internet client 
program, such as a mail reader. Most commercial public networks dis-
play a login screen through the browser, and they won’t make any other 
connection until you identify yourself to them (and start their billing 
clock). If your default home page is a blank screen, choose a website 
from your Favorites or Bookmarks list, or type a URL in the address field. 
The local login screen will appear before the computer connects you to 
the site you requested.
I don’t know if I’m within range of a network.
Some wireless utilities detect and display the SSIDs of all nearby network 
signals, so you can often check for a signal by simply plugging in an adapter 
and running the status program.
For more detailed information about nearby networks, including their 
SSIDs, try using NetStumbler (available at http://www.netstumbler.com) to 
identify all the signals that your network adapter can find. 
The network is slow.
Any time a single network segment slows down, the overall performance of 
the network will suffer. A slow file transfer or download could be caused by 
an overloaded server or too many people trying to use the network at the 
same time. Within the wireless segment of the network, slow performance 
could be caused by high demand for access to the network or interference 
from other wireless networks and other radio services operating on the same 
frequency. Signal fading and multipath interference can also cause the wire-
less network data speed to drop.
To reduce interference, try to shift the access point to a different channel 
at least five steps away from the original channel. For example, if you’re 
currently using channel 2, try shifting the access point to channel 7. This 
requires access to the access point’s configuration software, so it’s normally 
something that only a network administrator can do.
If you’re the manager of a Wi-Fi network that’s overloaded because too 
many users are online at the same time, add more access points that use 
different channels.

Tips and Troubleshooting
299
My computer drops its connection.
It doesn’t happen often, but a wireless network connection can occasionally 
disappear for no obvious reason. This disappearance could be caused by a 
very brief burst of radio interference, an intermittent failure at the base 
station, or some other short-lived problem. There is always a reason, but 
it’s often easier to simply restore the link than to spend hours searching 
for the cause. 
Windows offers a quick fix for this kind of problem. To restore a dropped 
connection, try this method first:
1.
From the Control Panel, open Network Connections.
2.
Right-click the icon or listing for the connection profile that failed. For a 
Wi-Fi connection, the name is probably Wireless Network Connection.
3.
Click Repair from the pop-up menu. Windows will clear anything that 
remains from the failed connection, turn off the wireless adapter, and try 
to establish a new connection.
4.
Try connecting to a website or some other Internet destination.
If the Repair command solves your problem, you can go back to what 
you were doing before you lost the connection. If you still can’t connect to a 
nearby Wi-Fi hot spot or to your broadband data network, there might be 
some residual junk programs running on your computer that interfere with 
the wireless connection. To clean out the junk, try rebooting the computer: 
Shut down Windows (or any other operating system), turn off the computer, 
wait 10 seconds, and then turn it back on again.
My Wi-Fi network has crashed.
If you’re a network manager and several of your users tell you that they 
can’t connect to your Wi-Fi network, it’s possible that the access point has 
temporarily flaked out (that’s the technical term) or your wired connection 
to the Internet has dropped out. Take a look at the lights on the access point 
and the Internet gateway router to confirm that the Power and WAN indi-
cators are on. If you can’t find an obvious problem, try restarting the access 
point by unplugging and reconnecting the power plug. 
IF ALL ELSE FAILS, REBOOT
Restarting the computer is often the only thing necessary to clear a problem. When 
you turn the computer off and then back on again, you will get rid of the shards 
and fragments of old programs that are taking up space—but not doing anything 
useful—in your computer’s memory. A cold reboot, in which you turn the computer 
off (rather than a warm reboot, in which you use the Restart command), can solve a 
multitude of apparent problems.

Chapter 17
Can I improve performance with an external antenna?
As a rule of thumb, an external antenna will improve the signal strength of 
a wireless network signal by at least 15 percent because it can be placed in a 
position free of obstructions to the signal path. The external antenna can 
be attached to either the access point (in which case it will increase signal 
strength to every network client) or to a wireless network adapter. If you can 
place external antennas on both ends of the link, the total improvement will 
be about 32.5 percent.
This assumes that the captive antenna and the external antenna have 
exactly the same characteristics. If the external antenna is directional, or if it 
has more gain than the captive antenna, the performance improvement could 
be even greater. On the other hand, many network adapters and access points 
use two captive antennas in a diversity system that constantly compares the 
signals from each antenna and selects the stronger one. In a noisy environ-
ment, a diversity antenna system might be more effective than a single 
antenna. 
What else can I do to improve performance?
Energy radiated from a transmitting antenna is often polarized in either 
the horizontal or the vertical plane, so a receiving antenna will detect a 
stronger signal from an antenna with the same polarity. In other words, if 
the transmitter uses a vertical antenna, the receiving antenna will detect a 
stronger signal if it is also vertical. If the transmitting antenna is horizontal, 
a horizontal receiving antenna will perform best.
At short range, polarity won’t make a significant difference to the perfor-
mance of a Wi-Fi link. Even if the two antennas have different polarity, they 
will still exchange signals that are strong enough to keep the data moving at 
full speed. But when you are trying to squeeze every possible data bit out of a 
weak or noisy signal, you might see some improvement when both antennas 
are polarized the same way. 
The captive antennas built into most PC Card adapters are difficult or 
impossible to move without turning the whole computer on its side, but 
many access points have antennas mounted on swivels, so it’s easy to move 
them from a vertical to a horizontal position. 
If you are using a laptop computer with an internal network adapter, the 
antenna is probably built into the upper half of the “clamshell” alongside the 
screen. You can sometimes improve wireless performance by changing the 
angle of the screen or by rotating the entire computer on its base. You don’t 
have to make a huge adjustment to the screen angle; a slight change can 
make the difference between a poor signal and one you can use.

Tips and Troubleshooting
301
When I move to a different access point, the adapter loses the 
connection.
In a Wi-Fi network with more than one base station, wireless adapters are 
supposed to detect all nearby access points and automatically shift their 
association to an access point with a clean, strong signal when you move 
from one place to another. However, the transfers don’t always work properly. 
Sometimes an adapter will just drop the network connection when the signal 
from the nearest access point fades out. If that happens, try connecting again. 
If that doesn’t work, try rebooting your computer. 
Where can I find a copy of the Wi-Fi standards?
IEEE standards are written by engineers for other engineers, so they don’t 
make particularly exciting reading. However, they are the defining docu-
ments for wireless Ethernet networks, so you might want to take a look at 
them. They’re available online at http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/std/
lanman. 
How can I find out who made my network adapter?
In spite of the labels on the packages, many wireless network adapters and 
access points are private label versions of some other company’s products. 
It’s often much easier for a company to add wireless products to their cata-
logs by buying them from somebody else rather than creating and building 
their own designs.
Some companies that sell private label versions of adapters and access 
points might tell you who made them, but many salespeople will insist that 
they make everything themselves, and even if they don’t, they stand by the 
warranty, so why should you care?
As a user or network manager, the name of the original equipment manu-
facturer (OEM) should not make any difference to you, as long as the device 
carries Wi-Fi certification. If it has passed the Wi-Fi tests, you can assume that 
it will work reasonably well with the other equipment in your network, but 
sometimes it helps to know what’s inside that sealed PC Card package. If 
you’re using the adapter with a computer running Unix or Linux, the manu-
facturer’s tech support people might not know where to find the right drivers 
and configuration tools for their devices, but when you know whose compo-
nents are inside, you can find the drivers on your own. As a network manager, 
it can be useful to know which adapters are identical to the ones you’re already 
using so you can keep a few spares on hand that will work with the existing 
drivers in your users’ computers.

302
Chapter 17
How do you find the name of the original manufacturer? You’ll have to 
do your own detective work. Every piece of electronic equipment sold in the 
United States that can emit radio energy must carry a registration number 
issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). This applies to 
radio transmitters such as wireless network devices, and also to most other 
computer components, because they emit radio energy as a side effect to 
whatever function they’re supposed to perform.
don’t worry about it. Just click OK to continue to this website.) Most of this 
information is boring technical stuff, but if you look around the exhibits, 
you can often find something that identifies the original manufacturer or 
the maker of an adapter’s internal chip set.
The FCC database is also a great tool for people like me who have a 
junk box full of old computer circuit cards that seemed important enough 
to save but don’t have labels that explain what they were good for. The 
database maps each card to a listing with a description of the card and 
maybe even a copy of the user’s manual. With a make and model number, 
it’s usually possible to find a manufacturer’s website that provides even 
more details.
If you already have the device, often the easiest way to find out what it is, 
especially in an operating system like Linux or BSD, is to plug it in and see 
what happens. Typically, dmesg, lspci, or lsusb will give you enough infor-
mation about the device specifics to plug into a search engine and find the 
original manufacturer and which drivers to use.
Is the software that came with my network adapter or access 
point up to date?
The software supplied with wireless network adapters exists in two forms: 
programs that run on the computer connected to the adapter and internal 
firmware that controls the adapter itself. All the software that runs on an 
access point is internal firmware.
The manufacturers of wireless networking hardware (and most other 
computer-related products) often issue new versions of the software that 
supports their products. Updated software might include fixes for bugs that 
were discovered after the product shipped, support for new operating 
systems, and additional features and functions such as improved encryption.  
There’s an FCC ID number on just about 
every wireless network device. For example, 
Figure 17-3 shows the label on a Xircom PC Card 
adapter. The FCC ID number is LDK102038.
The FCC maintains a searchable database 
at https://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/
GenericSearch.cfm that lists every ID number, 
with links to copies of all the technical exhibits 
that the manufacturer supplied with their appli-
cation for registration. (If you get a security 
warning when you try to connect to this site,

adapter has a unique FCC 
ID number.

Therefore, it’s always useful to check the manufacturer’s website to see what 
might be available. For updates to wireless broadband data adapters, look in 
the technical support section of your service provider’s website.
Installing new configuration and status programs is easy; just load the 
new software over the older version. In most cases, the manufacturer supplies 
the software in an executable file that automatically deletes earlier versions 
and runs a complete installation routine. It’s always a good idea to read the 
README file or other instructions that were provided as part of the download 
package.
Updating firmware is more complicated. The manufacturer or service 
provider always includes detailed instructions, which you should follow as 
closely as possible. Before you update the firmware in an access point, 
remember to warn all your users that the network will be offline for 
maintenance. 
I’m having trouble connecting to a broadband network.
If you’re trying to connect for the first time, make sure your new account has 
been activated. Telephone your service provider’s support center to check.
If your broadband connection stops working after you have been using it 
for a few weeks or more, check with your service provider to confirm that 
your account is still active. If you’re at the end of a free trial period, make 
sure the service provider hasn’t cancelled your account.
Most broadband networks use DHCP to automatically assign an IP 
address and DNS address. Make sure the broadband network profile has 
DHCP enabled.
If your broadband connection still doesn’t work, try removing and 
reinstalling the service provider’s connection manager software from the 
original CD or from a copy on your hard drive. Most service providers have 
copies of the latest software available for download from their websites 
(you’ll need either a Wi-Fi or wired Ethernet connection to reach the 
Internet when your broadband service isn’t working).
If you are using a non-Windows operating system, such as OS X, Linux, 
or BSD, many broadband vendors require the first connection to be made 
using their Windows proprietary software. After the first connection is made, 
the device will usually work on other operating systems. Ask your vendor’s 
support center for help with alternative operating systems.
I’m having trouble connecting to my VPN.
If you can’t connect to your LAN through a VPN, the problem could be either 
in the VPN settings on your computer or at the VPN host. Either way, your 
best bet is to telephone or email the network manager or help desk staff who 
are responsible for the network. They’ll have the exact codes and settings 
necessary to make your connection work properly.

Chapter 17
How can I extend the life of my computer’s battery?
A radio transmitter consumes electric power as it sends and receives radio 
signals, so the battery in a portable computer with a wireless adapter will run 
down much faster than the same computer without the adapter. Fortunately, 
there are a few things you can do to keep the power drain down to an absolute 
minimum.
First, turn off or disconnect the adapter when you’re not using it. If 
you’re on an airplane or a train, or anywhere else where you’re outside the 
range of a wireless signal, or if you’re using the computer for some purpose 
that doesn’t require network access, remove the PC Card adapter from its 
socket or unplug the USB cable. If your computer has an internal wireless 
adapter, turn it off. 
This is good advice for any plug-in device on a PC Card. If you’re not 
using it, remove it. Modems, Ethernet adapters, and storage cards all consume 
power any time they’re plugged into the computer, so your battery will keep 
going longer if the socket is empty.
When you use your wireless network adapter, you can reduce power 
consumption by using the Power Saving Protocol that’s part of the 802.11 
specification. Someplace in the adapter’s configuration utility, there’s a set 
of power management options that can instruct the adapter to enter a power 
saving mode:
 Constantly Awake Mode (CAM) consumes the most power and provides 
the fastest response. In CAM mode, the adapter is on all the time. It 
receives all incoming messages as soon as the access point gets them. 
 Power Saving Protocol (PSP) mode consumes less power, but it also 
provides slower response. In PSP mode, the adapter instructs the access 
point to hold messages for this network node in a buffer, and it enters 
a low-power sleep mode. At regular time intervals (several times each 
minute), the adapter wakes up and polls the access point for messages. 
Because there’s a delay between the time the access point receives each 
message and the time it sends the message on to the sleeping adapter, 
data and messages will take longer to move through the network. 
Can I use my access point as a network bridge?
An access point is a bridge between a wireless network and a wired LAN. If a 
single access point is not adequate to reach the entire area to be served by 
the wireless network, connecting additional access points to the wired LAN 
can extend the coverage area. But a wireless bridge, in which the wireless link 
connects two LANs together, is a more specialized device. Many access points 
offer wireless bridging as an option, but not as part of the basic feature set. 
If you plan to use an access point as a bridge between networks, check the 
specifications before you buy it. Your best bet is to buy a separate wireless 
bridge rather than trying to jury-rig a generic wireless adapter.

Tips and Troubleshooting
305
I’ve heard that radio signals from cellular phones might be 
dangerous. What about Wi-Fi?
Some people believe the jury is still out on the safety of cellular telephones. 
Others are convinced that they’re a serious health threat. Scientists and 
engineers have performed studies and published papers that claim to prove 
that extended use of a cell phone can—or can’t possibly—cause cancer, 
make milk go sour, or have some other terrible effect. Human exposure to 
electromagnetic fields at the frequencies used by cell phones and wireless 
network adapters is within the levels that most organizations and regulatory 
agencies that have studied the matter consider safe. The dissenters believe 
that those levels are too high. 
Even if you think cell phones are potentially dangerous, it’s likely that 
the radios in wireless adapters are safer, for several reasons. First, when a 
cellular telephone is transmitting, it’s usually just an inch or two from the 
user’s brain, but a wireless adapter is probably a foot or more away (even 
though they’re called laptops, most people use them on a table rather than 
on their laps). The effect of nonionizing radiation (a fancy name for radio 
waves) decreases at a rate equal to the square of the distance, so a transmitter 
located two inches from your head will have about 36 times more effect on 
your body than a radio located a foot away, assuming that both radio signals 
are equally strong at the antenna.
Second, the radio in a cell phone is 20 times more powerful than a radio 
in a wireless adapter (0.60 watts versus 0.03 watts), so the intensity of the 
signal is more than 700 times stronger.
Finally, the effect of radio frequency radiation on organic matter is 
cumulative—the longer the body is exposed to radiation, the greater the 
effect. Most cell phones transmit a continuous stream of packets as long as 
the phone conversation is going on, but wireless LANs are bursty services 
that are only active when they are actually transmitting data. The total 
amount of transmission time for a wireless adapter is just a fraction of the 
time that a cell phone is active.
Therefore, the total amount of radiation your body receives from a 
wireless network adapter is just a tiny fraction of the amount you receive 
from a cell phone. There are plenty of other, more serious, threats to your 
health and safety.

STEAL THIS COMPUTER BOOK 4.0
What They Won’t Tell You About the Internet
by WALLACE WANG
This offbeat, non-technical book examines what hackers do, how they do it, and 
how readers can protect themselves. Informative, irreverent, and entertaining, 
the completely revised fourth edition of Steal This Computer Book contains new 
chapters that discuss the hacker mentality, lock picking, exploiting P2P file-
sharing networks, and how people manipulate search engines and pop-up ads. 
Includes a CD with hundreds of megabytes of hacking and security-related 
programs that tie in to each chapter of the book.

est to an average desktop user, such as installing new software via Synaptic; 
Internet connectivity; working with removable storage devices, printers, 
and scanners; and handling DVDs, audio files, and even iPods. It also eases 
readers into the world of commands, thus allowing them to work with Java, 
Python, or other script-based applications; convert RPMs to DEB files; and 
compile software from source.

THE CULT OF MAC
by LEANDER KAHNEY
No product on the planet enjoys the devotion of a Macintosh computer. 
Famously dedicated to their machines, many Mac fans eat, sleep, and breathe 
Macintosh. In The Cult of Mac, Wired News managing editor Leander Kahney 
takes an in-depth look at Mac users and their unique, creative, and often very 
funny culture. From people who get Mac tattoos and haircuts to those who 
furnish their apartments out of empty Mac boxes, the book details Mac 
fandom in all of its forms.

FORBIDDEN LEGO
Build the Models Your Parents Warned You Against!
by ULRIK PILEGAARD and MIKE DOOLEY
Written by a former master LEGO designer and a former LEGO project man-
ager, this full-color book showcases projects that break the LEGO Group’s 
rules for building with LEGO bricks—rules against building projects that fire 
projectiles, require cutting or gluing bricks, or use nonstandard parts. Many 
of these are back-room projects that LEGO’s master designers build under 
the LEGO radar, just to have fun. Learn how to build a catapult that shoots 
M&Ms, a gun that fires LEGO beams, a continuous-fire ping-pong ball 
launcher, and more! Tips and tricks will give you ideas for inventing your 
own creative model designs.

Broadband wireless networks bring us closer to the 
Internet’s ultimate destiny of interconnecting everyone, 
everywhere. But wireless networking can be a bit 
geeky and nerve-wracking without a proper guide. 
Let’s face it: Networking can be hard.
If you’re one of the last holdouts still connected to the 
Internet by a wire, The Book of Wireless, 2nd Edition is 
the book for you. You’ll learn how to set up your own 
home (or small office) wireless network and how to 
use public wireless networks, safely and securely. This 
plain-English guide demystifies configuring and using 
wireless networks— everything from shopping for 
parts to securing your network. 
Learn how to:
• Select and configure hardware and software for 
your Wi-Fi network and configure access points to 
minimize interference
• Secure your network using WPA encryption or a 
virtual private network (VPN)
• Discover open networks and maintain your privacy 
while surfing in public 
• Use VoIP over a wireless connection to talk on the 
phone for next to nothing
• Evaluate wireless data services based on cost, speed, 
and coverage
• Extend your network to give your neighbors free 
wireless Internet access
You’ll also learn about new and forthcoming broad-
band wireless data standards and how to choose the 
right service provider and equipment. With up-to-date 
information on wireless routers, network interface 
cards, antennas, security, broadband services, and 
software, The Book of Wireless, 2nd Edition will help 
you navigate the confusing wireless landscape to find 
the perfect solution.
