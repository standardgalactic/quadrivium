Preface
The domain of wearable and wireless systems for biomedical and rehabilitation
applications, such as through smartphones and portable media devices, is antici-
pated to grow exponentially. Even from the time of presenting the draft manuscript
of this book to the time of publication, the prevalence of this subject is expected to
undergo meaningful transformation and evolution. These devices enable wireless
inertial sensor applications to an assortment of scenarios pertaining to rehabilitation
and therapy.
Since 2010 when LeMoyne, Mastroianni, and our research team applied a novel
smartphone application for quantifying Parkinson’s disease tremor and gait quan-
tiﬁcation in the context of a wireless accelerometer, the opportunities have
expanded considerably. The authors are delighted to provide a contribution to this
exciting ﬁeld with the anticipation of the considerable array of developments in
years to follow. Please enjoy the knowledge and intellectual inspiration that our
book provides with the goal of providing meaningful, robust, and optimal reha-
bilitation for many.

Chapter 1
Wearable and Wireless Systems for Gait
Analysis and Reﬂex Quantiﬁcation
Abstract The capacity to quantify the movement features of a person undergoing
the rehabilitation process enables therapists and clinicians to proactively optimize
the therapy strategy. Wearable and wireless systems, such as the smartphone and
portable media device, are equipped with accelerometers and gyroscopes that can
readily quantify aspects of human movement pertinent to rehabilitation, such as gait
and reﬂex response. The smartphone and portable media device can measure gait
and reﬂex response through their inertial sensors, and the acquired data can be
conveyed by wireless transmission to the Internet as an email attachment. This
capability enables the experimental site and post-processing resources to be
remotely situated. Three phases of the evolution of quantiﬁcation techniques for the
rehabilitation process are observed, which are characterized as a ﬁrst, second, and
third wave. The ﬁrst wave pertains to the traditional ordinal scale approach used by
expert clinicians. The second wave emphasizes the role of quantiﬁcation systems
that are generally constrained to a clinical setting. The third wave envisions the
development of Network Centric Therapy through the application of wearable and
wireless systems, such as smartphones and portable media devices, for quantifying
movement characteristics, such as gait and reﬂex response. Network Centric
Therapy encompasses a quantum leap in rehabilitation capability through Cloud
Computing amalgamated with machine learning with patient and therapy team
situated remotely anywhere in the world. A summary of each chapter is further
presented.

1.1
Introduction
The capacity to quantify trends in a patient’s rehabilitation enhances the acuity for a
team of clinicians to reﬁne the therapy strategy and prescription [1–6]. Inertial
sensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, have been proposed for the
quantiﬁcation of human movement characteristics, such as gait and reﬂex [3–7].
With recent advances in microelectronics and wireless technology wearable and
wireless accelerometer and gyroscope systems have permeated the ﬁelds of
biomedical engineering and healthcare with previous arrangements, such as teth-
ered sensor systems, becoming effectively obsolete [3–6, 8].
The progressive integration of wearable and wireless systems are envisioned to
enable a quantum leap with regards to the capabilities of the biomedical and
healthcare environment. Inertial sensors, such as the accelerometer and gyroscope,
can facilitate a therapist’s acuity with regards to the nature of the patient’s move-
ment quality in the context of the therapy response. In particular wearable and
wireless devices are forecasted to considerably advance the rehabilitation experi-
ence, especially with regards to gait analysis and the associated quantiﬁcation of
reﬂex characteristics.
Essentially the presence of wearable and wireless systems with inertial sensors,
such as the accelerometer and gyroscope, is representative of the Internet of Things
for the biomedical community. The objective of the book is to provide a perspective
of the role of wireless accelerometer and gyroscope sensor apparatus that are also
wearable for the advance of rehabilitation and therapy in the context of gait analysis
and correlated aspects, such as reﬂex quantiﬁcation. This book sequentially advo-
cates the evaluation to Network Centric Therapy, which is predicted to radically
advance the efﬁcacy of the rehabilitation experience.
An advantage of the wearable and wireless accelerometer and gyroscope system
is the considerable ﬂexibility of available devices for the scenario under consid-
eration. One of the ﬁrst and most fundamental pathways was with regards to the
application of wireless accelerometer nodes for the domain of gait and reﬂex
quantiﬁcation. Wireless accelerometer nodes were successfully demonstrated for
the accurate and reliable quantiﬁcation of gait and reﬂex characteristics. At this
level of technology evolution wireless accelerometer nodes would locally transmit
data packages by wireless connectivity to a nearby situated PC [6, 9–22].
Further research and investigation respective of the technology pathway sought
to acquire wireless capabilities that could better access the Internet directly.
Equipped with the proper software application the smartphone is capable of func-
tioning as a wireless accelerometer platform and also a wireless gyroscope platform.
The recorded data package could be wirelessly conveyed to the Internet as an email
attachment, and the data could be post-processed remote from the experimental
location. Beginning in 2010 LeMoyne and Mastroianni have thoroughly resear-
ched, developed, tested, and evaluated the role of the smartphone for the accurate
and reliable quantiﬁcation of gait and reﬂex response features [3–5, 23–37]. With
the successfully demonstration of the smartphone as a gait analysis tool a multitude
2

of clinically relevant applications have advocated its wireless inertial sensor
capability [3–5].
Another similar wearable and wireless system relative to the smartphone is the
portable media device. Using the same operating system as the smartphone the
portable media device is readily capable of likewise functioning as a wireless
accelerometer platform and wireless gyroscope platform. The primary differentiator
between the portable media device and smartphone is the device cost and wireless
accessibility to the Internet. A portable media device imparts a ﬁxed cost; however,
the smartphone generally requires a marginal cost to sustain the telecommunication
package. The portable media device requires localized wireless Internet connec-
tivity, and by contrast the smartphone can access the Internet through a broad
telecommunication footprint. Research, development, test, and evaluation has
demonstrated the ability of the portable media device as a wireless accelerometer
and gyroscope platform for the quantiﬁcation of gait and reﬂex response similar to
the capabilities of smartphone [3–5, 37–49].
Further developments with respect to the capabilities of wireless and wearable
systems for quantifying rehabilitation status are evident in light of local Bluetooth
wireless connectivity. The concept of Bluetooth wireless offers the capacity to
locally connect the inertial sensor node to the more broadly Internet accessible
devices, such as a tablet, portable media device, and smartphone. This design
perspective alleviates mass encumbrance and mounting complexity of the sensor
node to the patient being monitored. For example, the relevance and acuity of the
Timed 25 Foot Walk test has been considerably advanced through the application
of a wireless accelerometer and gyroscope sensor node locally positioned about the
ankle joint. The experimental trial data package is then streamed by Bluetooth
wireless connectivity to a tablet, and the tablet then transmits the data to an Internet
resource, such as a Cloud Computing database [50].
These available capabilities regarding the broad domain of wearable and wire-
less accelerometer and gyroscope sensors coalesce to promote the potential for
Network Centric Therapy. Network Centric Therapy comprises the capabilities of
rehabilitation and advanced therapy in consideration of the Internet of Things. In
essence Network Centric Therapy would involve Cloud Computing level storage
and post-processing of therapy and rehabilitation based on quantiﬁed data from
wearable and wireless accelerometer and gyroscope sensors used by the patient.
There are a considerable array of utility that Network Centric Therapy offers for
the biomedical and rehabilitation community, the therapist regarding enhanced
acuity and awareness of the efﬁcacy of the therapy strategy, and the patient’s
experience of optimal rehabilitation and timeliness of recovery. This concept pro-
motes augmented patient intensive and focused therapy. The inherent nature of this
envisioned rehabilitation technique is logistically robust.
A patient can provide the therapist ample quantiﬁed data as to the status of the
rehabilitation experience from the convenience of a familiar and therefore highly
relevant home bound environment through the application of wearable and wireless
sensors systems, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes. For example, a therapist
1.1

could evaluate a patient from on the order of thousands of miles remote with respect
to the quality of gait characteristics in consideration of a prescribed therapy strat-
egy. A key feature to Network Centric Therapy is the observation that the patient
and therapist can reside in considerably geographically remote locations, while
proactively interacting for optimal rehabilitation. Data could be stored in a Cloud
Computing resource for further post-processing, such as machine learning classi-
ﬁcation for prognostic acuity of therapy strategy progression.
Network Centric Therapy through the application of wearable and wireless
systems to ascertain patient rehabilitation status integrates the therapy experience
with bioinformatics and data science. This cloud based computing conﬁguration
would enhance trend assessment as to the efﬁcacy of therapy strategy and suitability
for alternative techniques. Such large scales of rehabilitation data for a vast number
of patients would permit further optimization of the rehabilitation experience.
The available inertial sensor data provided through wearable and wireless sys-
tems for objectively quantifying patient rehabilitation feature sets can readily be
consolidated for machine learning. Preliminary demonstration of the role of
machine learning for wearable and wireless accelerometer and gyroscope sensor
systems have been demonstrated for differentiating between hemiplegic affected
and unaffected limbs with considerable classiﬁcation accuracy [36, 48, 49].
Machine learning classiﬁcation of rehabilitation status can augment the situational
awareness and prognostic acuity for a therapist to progressively advance the
sophistication of the therapy strategy. The implication is optimized therapy through
machine learning in consideration of strategy efﬁcacy and hastening time to a
sufﬁcient degree of convergence. The synergy of these capabilities should ame-
liorate strain on the limited availability of medical resources available for
rehabilitation.
Furthermore the development of Network Centric Therapy through the applica-
tion of patient focused wearable and wireless inertial sensor systems is envisioned to
promote more geographically ﬂexible application of medical resources. This is
particularly apparent that the wearable and wireless accelerometer and gyroscope
sensors have soundly established that the patient and therapist can reside remote
[3–5]. For example, consider a scenario for which the most experienced group a
therapists for a speciﬁc form of rehabilitation are uniquely located in Boston;
however, a person in need of such expert resources lives far remote in rural Arizona.
In light of previous rehabilitation technologies the prospect of utilizing expert
therapists in Boston to proactively instill a rehabilitation strategy for a person in a
remote and rural part of Arizona would be logistically daunting. With wearable and
wireless accelerometer and gyroscope sensor systems interconnected to the Internet
to evaluate the quality of gait rehabilitation, a subject could readily utilize such a
device to quantify the status of rehabilitation to the therapist situated far away in
Boston. The therapist could then have the data samples post-processed with
machine learning to distinguish the appropriate phase of the rehabilitation cycle or
even propose an alternative intervention. This capability would be also highly
relevant in the event that a group of expert therapists reside in a speciﬁc location
with a growing patient need remotely situated.

Further implications of the value of wearable and wireless inertial sensors for
quantifying rehabilitation status are the contextually realistic nature of the sensor
data acquired in a patient’s familiar environmental setting as opposed to a brief
clinical snapshot of the recovery status. A clinical snapshot may not reveal the true
nature of the patient’s state of rehabilitation. By contrast the wearable and wireless
inertial sensors can establish a progressive historical perspective of the patient’s
rehabilitation. More proactive intervention is enabled and the therapy strategy can
be optimized. Advanced and future therapy strategies can be developed with the
support of Cloud Computing data of multiple patients through the application of
data mining techniques.
The internationally renown futurist Alvin Tofﬂer envisioned the ‘Third Wave’,
which may be compared to growing prevalence of wearable and wireless
accelerometer and gyroscope sensors for gait and associated reﬂex quantiﬁcation
leading to Network Centric Therapy. To summarize Tofﬂer’s visionary Third Wave
requires addressing the previous First Wave and Second Wave. The First Wave
pertains to the advance of agricultural technology. The Second Wave encompasses
the industrial revolution. Tofﬂer’s insight as to the Third Wave involves the
expansion of the revolutionary developments of the Information Age [51].
The dawn of wearable and wireless systems, such as accelerometer and gyroscope
sensors, for gait analysis and associated reﬂex quantiﬁcation that facilitates the
development of Network Centric Therapy draws analogies to Tofﬂer’s Third Wave.
The First Wave comparative is discussed in Chap. 2 that involved the expert yet
subjective interpretation of a highly skill clinician, which would provide relatively
basic information as to the patient’s rehabilitation status, such as a ordinal scale
rating. The Second Wave metaphor is featured in Chap. 3. This Second Wave analogy
as discussed in Chap. 3 provides clinically standard quantiﬁcation techniques;
however, they are conﬁned to a clinical setting and require specialized resources.
The Third Wave analogy is the rise of wearable and wireless systems, such as
accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, for gait analysis and associated reﬂex
quantiﬁcation. These devices link with Internet connectivity for the potential of
Network Centric Therapy. This concept represents a true Information Age per-
spective that utilizes the Internet with patient intensive rehabilitation. Other asso-
ciated technologies, such as remote post-processing and machine learning, are
cornerstones to the application of wearable and wireless systems for gait analysis
and associated reﬂex quantiﬁcation. The cohesion of these capabilities is envisioned
to provide a quantum leap regarding optimal rehabilitation while ameliorating strain
on limited medical resources.

rehabilitation techniques and technology. They provide both historical perspective
and insight as to future capabilities. The procession of each book chapter further

advocates and establishes the realization of wearable and wireless systems, such as
accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, for gait analysis and associated reﬂex
quantiﬁcation in conjunction with the eminence of Network Centric Therapy.
Chapter 2: The most basic and standard means of quantifying a subject’s
rehabilitation status is with the application of an ordinal scale system. The highly
trained and specialized clinician serves a critical role for this technique. There are
multiple ordinal scale techniques that pertain to gait and reﬂex response quantiﬁ-
cation, for which each ordinal scale assignment corresponds to a speciﬁc series of
criteria. In essence a clinicians expert, although subjective interpretation is critical
for the determination of the patient’s rehabilitation status.
Even through the ordinal scale ranking is speciﬁed by a highly skilled and expert
clinician the reliability of the ordinal scale is a subject of controversy. As Chap. 2
demonstrates, even the reliability of ﬁve point and nine point scales for determining
reﬂex response are contested. They discovery of a hemiplegic reﬂex pair is also a
debatable topic.
Furthermore Chap. 2 advocates that the decrements of abnormal gait strategies
are minute in nature. Clinical techniques for quantifying gait are highly related to
clinical experience. More complex techniques for assessing neurodegenerative
scenarios, such as Friedreich’s ataxia, that are intrinsically related to gait quality,
apply techniques like the Timed 25 Foot Walk test.
As future chapters advocating wearable and wireless accelerometer and gyro-
scope sensors demonstrate, these sensors can provide considerably more reﬁned and
thorough data, such as to augment the conventional Timed 25 Foot Walk test.
Chapters 7 and 9 demonstrate that these wireless and inertial sensors can be worn
during gait and provide signal data for the objective and quantiﬁed machine
learning classiﬁcation of subject health status. This quantum leap in biomedical and
rehabilitation technology represents the considerable potential of Network Centric
Therapy.
The historical evolution of clinical quantiﬁcation techniques proceeds from the
metaphorical First Wave of the ordinal scale approach to the Second Wave era
pertaining to the development of electro-mechanical and optical systems that are
generally conﬁned to a laboratory environment. These devices are addressed in
Chap. 3.

of
electro-mechanical and optical devices for the quantiﬁcation of gait. This capability
constitutes in effect the Second Wave metaphor for the quantiﬁcation of human
movement, such as gait. These devices promote meaningful quantitative feedback,
which can be readily applied to the determination of rehabilitation efﬁcacy. In
particular there are six standard devices applied to the traditional domain of gait
analysis:
• Foot switches
• Electrogoniometers
• Electromyogram (EMG)
• Metabolic analysis
6

Wearable and Wireless Systems for Gait Analysis …

• Optical motion cameras
• Force plates
However, there are drawbacks to this type of technology, especially in comparison
to the Third Wave representing the onset of Network Centric Therapy.
In general these devices are logistically restricted to a clinical gait laboratory.
This issue apparently limits the ability of a patient to access its resources for
proactive therapy in light of continuous and timely feedback of rehabilitation status.
Furthermore, some of these devices, such as the force plate and optical motion
camera, are preclusively expensive with respect to an intensively patient centric
rehabilitation experience. The EMG and optical motion camera require specialized
training for preparation and acquisition of the data sample.
These standard devices, as demonstrated can provide unique data packages,
which can then be post-processed remote using Internet resources. For example, the
force plate has been demonstrated as a tool for identifying various subphases of
stance during the gait cycle. This capability has been synergistically matched with
machine learning to attain considerable classiﬁcation accuracy with respect to a
hemiplegic affected and unaffected ankle-foot complex during gait. Other sophis-
ticated examples pertain to the classiﬁcation of disparate software architectures for
controlling complex powered transtibial prostheses.
With respect to reﬂex response quantiﬁcation similar themed devices relative to
the standard gait analysis systems have been demonstrated. EMG can be readily
applied to determine the intensity of reﬂex response. Force measuring apparatus,
such as a strain gauge, can measure the mechanical nature of the reﬂex.
As thoroughly demonstrated in the subsequent chapters wearable and wireless
accelerometers and gyroscope sensors offer considerably greater opportunity for
gait analysis and reﬂex quantiﬁcation. Wearable and wireless systems for the
analysis of human movement extend to functionally autonomous environments
beyond the conﬁnes of a clinical gait laboratory, which can literally be established
by the patient’s choosing. Wearable and wireless devices leverage the previous
success of demonstrated post-processing capabilities evidenced by standard clinical
quantiﬁcation equipment, such as the advent of machine learning classiﬁcation. The
Second Wave of electro-mechanical and optical equipment for the quantiﬁcation of
human movement, such as gait and reﬂex, represent the foundation for the nascent
pathways of the Third Wave of wearable and wireless systems leading to Network
Centric Therapy. The origins of wearable and wireless systems are presented in the
following Chap. 4.
Chapter 4: Inertial measurement units, such as accelerometers, represent the
foundational basis for wearable and wireless sensor devices for gait and reﬂex
quantiﬁcation. It is rather useful to establish a historical perspective of these inertial
sensors, and their technology development pathway for their integration into the
biomedical, rehabilitation, and healthcare community. On the order of roughly a
half century ago inertial sensors, such as the accelerometer, were proposed for the
quantiﬁcation of human movement, such as gait. However, at the time of this
conceptual perspective, the accelerometer was in fact cumbersome, unreliable, and
1.2
Summary of the Pending Chapters
7

relatively expensive for patient centric application for the domain of quantiﬁed
rehabilitation status feedback.
Approximately at the time of the proposal for using accelerometers to measure
human movement, such as gait, the ﬁeld of biomedical engineering for rehabili-
tation was essentially also in its nascent stages too. Relatively larger industries, such
as the automotive domain, facilitated the advancement of accelerometer technology
space. With synergistic trends regarding electronic improvements in miniaturiza-
tion, the accelerometer node possessed the suitable attributes to function as a
wearable and wireless sensor device for the quantiﬁcation of human movement.
Many preliminary applications pertained to scenarios, such as the quantiﬁcation
of human activity. Other demonstrations of accelerometers for quantifying gait were
successfully contrasted to conventional gait analysis apparatus. However, the initial
use of accelerometers for quantifying gait relied on data logger transfer of data or
tethering mechanisms, which is currently obsolete.
Integral systems amalgamating accelerometer sensors with localized wireless
connectivity enabled the preliminary resemblance of the modern wearable and
wireless sensor system for gait analysis. These systems generally required highly
speciﬁc anatomical mounting positions. They also provided pathways as to the
accuracy and reliability of wearable and wireless systems, especially relative to
traditional devices.
Trends respective of electronic miniaturization continued to progress. This
technology evolution leads to the consolidation of the accelerometer into a singular
wireless accelerometer node. Local wireless connectivity to a laptop computer
enabled the brisk post-processing of experimental data. The wearable and wireless
nature of these accelerometer nodes permitted gait analysis in a robustly autono-
mous indoor and outdoor environment. Furthermore the reﬂex response and latency
could be readily quantiﬁed in an accurate, reliable, and even reproducible manner.
Given the compact nature of the wireless accelerometer node, it could be readily
mounted to a readily familiar anatomical position rather than a location requiring a
specialized degree of training. These trends in wearable and wireless technology
align toward the theme of patient applied devices, such that the patient can con-
veniently wear the wireless sensor, such as an accelerometer node. These obser-
vations represent further convenience toward the objective of achieving Network
Centric Therapy. Considerable number experimental demonstrations are presented
in Chap. 5.
Chapter 5: Multiple wireless accelerometer conﬁgurations were explored for the
objective of providing a wearable and wireless accelerometer capable of conve-
niently quantifying gait and tendon reﬂex characteristics. As gait and tendon reﬂex
are interrelated the selection process for an efﬁcacious wireless accelerometer
system was aligned. Preliminary research, development, testing, and evaluation
focus on the quantiﬁcation of patellar tendon reﬂex response and eventually
associated reﬂex latency.
The wireless quantiﬁed reﬂex device encompassed four progressive evolutionary
cycles. A coherent theme to all four evolutions is the use of an impact pendulum
attached to a neurological reﬂex hammer for evoking the patellar tendon reﬂex. The
8
1
Wearable and Wireless Systems for Gait Analysis …

signiﬁcant advantage of this aspect of the wireless quantiﬁed reﬂex device is the
reﬂex response is elicited from a consistent amount of potential energy.
Furthermore the impact pendulum can consistently target the same aspect of the
patellar tendon with the same quantity of potential energy over the entire course of
an experimental trial sample.
For the wireless quantiﬁed reﬂex device the wireless accelerometer node for
measuring the reﬂex response would be positioned proximal to the lateral malleolus
of the ankle joint. This mounted technique greatly facilitated the consistent appli-
cation of the accelerometer node, which is particularly useful for successful lon-
gitudinal studies. The primary feature of the reﬂex response acceleration signal was
the maximum of the acceleration magnitude using the Pythagorean theorem for the
three dimensional representation of the wireless accelerometer.
The culmination of the wireless quantiﬁed reﬂex device was the fourth gener-
ation, which was capable of quantifying reﬂex response and reﬂex latency. Reﬂex
latency was acquired through applying a tandem activated wireless accelerometer to
the arm of the impact pendulum near the aspect where the neurological reﬂex
hammer was secured. The temporal offset between respective spikes in the accel-
eration magnitude signals for the impact pendulum and reﬂex response established
a functional latency. Software automation further advanced the post-processing,
especially for a longitudinal study. In summary, the fourth generation wireless
quantiﬁed reﬂex device acquired patellar tendon reﬂex response and associated
latency in a accurate, reliable, and reproducible manner for multiple subjects during
a longitudinal study.
Further exploration regarding the many utilities of wireless accelerometers lead
to the application of the wearable and wireless accelerometers systems for the
quantiﬁcation of gait. Wireless accelerometer were readily applied about the lateral
epicondyle of the femur proximal to the knee joint and the lateral malleolus near the
ankle joint. The autonomous nature of the wearable and wireless systems transcends
the clinical conﬁnes of a gait laboratory, and experimental data was acquired in both
familiar indoor and outdoor environments.
The three dimensional magnitude of the acceleration signal reveals distinctive
spikes implying stance initiation. Post-processing derived parameters were
acquired, such as temporal disparity from stance to stance and the time averaged
acceleration between stance to stance increments. These gait parameters identiﬁed
quantiﬁed disparity with regards to hemiplegic gait with respect to the affected leg
and unaffected leg.
Another feature of the wearable and wireless accelerometer system is the
observation that the signal can be presented in real-time. Under this circumstance a
subject can modify their gait strategy based on the accelerometer signal feedback.
This capability is especially relevant for people with disparity of their proprio-
ceptive representation as a result of hemiparesis. This synthesis of wireless
accelerometers for real-time feedback for gait modiﬁcation offers a Virtual
Proprioception.
Virtual Proprioception was successfully demonstrated in two scenarios. One type
of Virtual Proprioception applied the wireless accelerometer nodes about the lateral
1.2

epicondyle proximal to the knee joint. The subject would visually observe the
real-time feedback of the accelerometer signal and then modify gait strategy to attain
parity with respect to the acceleration signal of both the hemiplegic affected leg and
unaffected leg. This form of Virtual Proprioception with visual feedback was suc-
cessfully demonstrated.
Another version of Virtual Proprioception involved auditory feedback with
respect to gait parity. The acceleration signal was post-processed in real-time using
a similar wearable wireless system mounting approach compared to the visual form
of Virtual Proprioception. The real-time computation of the stance to stance time
averaged acceleration was computationally acquired in consideration of a stance
initiation event implied by exceeding a predetermined acceleration threshold. The
auditory version of Virtual Proprioception also successfully enabled a hemiplegic
subject to achieve parity respect of the affected leg and unaffected leg using
real-time acceleration signal feedback.
The wearable and wireless accelerometer system applied in Chap. 5 required
local proximity to a personal computer for the wireless transfer of the experimental
data package. This demonstrated technology capability elucidates the revolutionary
capabilities of Network Centric Therapy as a patient can be evaluated from an
assortment of scenarios both indoor and outdoor for gait analysis. Reﬂex response
and correlated latency can be conveniently recorded in a highly non-intrusive
manner. Furthermore, the quantiﬁed accelerometer data signals can establish a
considerably thorough patient history that can augment therapist acuity with respect
to the efﬁcacy of therapy strategy and suitability for alternative interventions and
progressive reﬁnement of the prescribed rehabilitation techniques.
Further evolution toward the pathway of attaining Network Centric Therapy
identiﬁes the requirement for better wireless accessibility to ideally the Internet. The
smartphone and portable media device enable the capability to function as a
wearable and wireless accelerometer and gyroscope platform. The acquired
accelerometer signal and gyroscope signal can be readily conveyed though wireless
connectivity to the Internet as an email attachment. The secure email resource
represents a functional Cloud Computing environment, for which post-processing,
such as machine learning classiﬁcation, can occur at any remote location in the
world. The true potential of Network Centric Therapy is elucidated in Chap. 6.
Chapter 6: The true potential Network Centric Therapy is preliminarily
demonstrated through the application of smartphones and portable media devices as
wearable and wireless systems. Smartphones and portable media devices are
equipped with inertial sensors, such as an accelerometers and gyroscopes. With the
proper software application the smartphone and portable media device can both
function as wearable and wireless accelerometer or gyroscope platforms.
Their recorded data packages can be readily transmitted by wireless connectivity
to the Internet as email attachments. The secure email resource represents a func-
tional semblance of a Cloud Computer storage resource. This storage in an email
linked to the Internet enables the data to be post-processed through resources
remote to the experimental site literally anywhere in the world.

Wearable and Wireless Systems for Gait Analysis …

During 2010 LeMoyne and Mastroianni demonstrated the utility of a smartphone
as a functionally wireless accelerometer platform for gait analysis. A smartphone
could be readily mounted proximal to the lateral malleolus about the ankle joint
through an elastic band. The gait analysis experiment was conducted in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania and the data was post-processed in metropolitan Los Angles,
California.
Similar techniques presented in Chap. 5 were applied to post-process the data.
First the spikes in the signal representing acceleration magnitude were acquired to
determine stance initiation. Subsequently the time averaged acceleration from
stance to stance was computed to provide another quantiﬁed parameter for gait
analysis.
The portable media device and smartphone can utilize the same operating sys-
tem, such as for an iPhone and iPod. Therefore the same software application could
be applied to provide wireless accelerometer capability to the portable media device
with respect to gait analysis. The smartphone and portable media device possess
unique features for the context of application.
The smartphone is equipped with a broad telecommunications footprint, which
enables its role for outdoors gait quantiﬁcation scenarios. However, the smartphone
also requires a marginal cost for sustaining the telecommunication access. By
contrast the portable media device is ﬁxed cost in nature as it only requires a local
wireless Internet connection, which makes it suitable for indoors quantiﬁcation of
gait status.
Successful demonstration of the portable media device as a wearable and wire-
less accelerometer platform for gait analysis was demonstrated by LeMoyne and
Mastroianni during 2011. Data was conveyed effectively cross-country respective of
the United States through access an email resource through the Internet. Later the
tandem operation of two portable media devices successfully quantiﬁed disparity
regarding a hemiplegic affected and unaffected leg pair during gait.
Further extension of the capabilities of the smartphone and portable media
device as a robust wearable and wireless system was demonstrated through the
quantiﬁcation of the patellar tendon reﬂex. The portable media device is highly
relevant to a localized setting, such as a medical facility, because of its capability to
achieve local wireless Internet connectivity. Therefore the portable media device is
an appropriate extension of the wireless reﬂex quantiﬁcation system. During 2012
LeMoyne and Mastroianni successfully demonstrated the portable media device as
a wireless accelerometer platform for the quantiﬁcation of the patellar tendon reﬂex
using a potential energy impact pendulum. Later a similar conﬁguration attained
considerable machine learning classiﬁcation accuracy for differentiating between a
hemiplegic affected and unaffected patellar tendon reﬂex pair through using a
support vector machine.
In the event that a broader telecommunications footprint is necessary to achieve
wireless connectivity to the Internet the smartphone can enable the wireless reﬂex
quantiﬁcation system to evaluate patellar tendon reﬂex response. In a remote setting
the smartphone represented a functional wireless accelerometer platform for the
successful acquisition of the tendon reﬂex response. The wireless reﬂex
1.2
Summary of the Pending Chapters
11

quantiﬁcation system was further evolved with a software automation program for
the extraction of reﬂex response parameters from the acceleration signal.
As the prevalence of the smartphone for quantifying gait as a functional wireless
accelerometer platform further developed, the scenario of quantifying the gait cycle
of a person with a transtibial prosthesis was considered. A design challenge for the
experiment was developing an appropriate mounting technique as opposed to using
the elastic band, such as a sock. 3D printing offered a unique approach. The
smartphone was mounted to the subject’s prosthesis through a 3D printed adapter.
Similar to previous successful test and evaluation the experimental site and
post-processing resources were remote with each data trial conveyed by wireless
transmission to the Internet as an email attachment.
Current smartphones are also equipped with gyroscope sensors. Preliminary
investigation of the smartphone as a wireless gyroscope platform was successfully
demonstrated through the acquisition of the patellar tendon reﬂex response in
conjunction with the potential energy impact pendulum. The data package was
conveyed through wireless connectivity to the Internet. Post-processing was
enabled through software automation. In particular the gyroscope signal provides a
recognizable visualization of the patellar tendon reﬂex response.
Further extension of the smartphone as a wireless gyroscope platform for the
quantiﬁcation of the reﬂex response using a potential energy impact pendulum
successfully distinguished between a hemiplegic affected and unaffected reﬂex pair
through machine learning. Software automation extracted attributes of the gyro-
scope signal to develop the feature set. Using a multilayer perceptron neural net-
work as the machine learning algorithm considerable classiﬁcation accuracy was
attained.
Returning to the domain of gait analysis, the smartphone as a wireless gyroscope
platform can readily quantify the presence of reduced arm swing. With a conven-
tional smartphone band the device can be mounted near the distal aspect of the
lower arm and proximal to the wrist similar to a watch. This conﬁguration is readily
appropriate for an outdoor setting. Preliminary test and evaluation pertained to
hemiplegic reduced arm swing. The acquired gyroscope signal was post-processed
to establish a feature set that attained considerable classiﬁcation accuracy through
the implementation of a multilayer perceptron neural network to differentiate
between the hemiplegic affected arm and unaffected arm. Another similar and
successful scenario was demonstrated regarding reduced arm swing with respect to
Erb’s Palsy, for which considerable machine learning classiﬁcation accuracy was
also attained.
The successful research, development, testing and, evaluation of smartphones
and portable media devices as wearable and wireless accelerometer and gyroscope
platforms for the quantiﬁcation of gait and reﬂex response quantiﬁcation implicate
and suggest the rampant development of Network Centric Therapy. Experimental
data can be readily recorded and transmitted through wireless Internet connectivity
and remotely post-processed anywhere in the world. Software automation can
consolidate the trial data into a cohesive feature set for machine learning classiﬁ-
cation. Smartphones and portable media devices are equipped with local Bluetooth

wireless capability, which can further evolve the capabilities of Network Centric
Therapy. Chapter 7 presents ‘Bluetooth inertial sensors for gait and reﬂex response
quantiﬁcation with perspectives regarding Cloud Computing and the Internet of
Things’.
Chapter 7: The establishment of smartphones and portable media devices as
wearable and wireless inertial sensor systems represents the preliminary foundation
for the capabilities of Network Centric Therapy. However, further trends toward
miniaturization necessitate a more speciﬁc scope for the wearable and wireless
inertial sensor. For example, the smartphone and portable media device fulﬁll a
considerable array of capabilities far beyond the scope of the requirements of a
wearable and wireless system for Network Centric Therapy.
Bluetooth enables a further reﬁnement with respect to the system requirements
of the wearable and wireless system for the quantiﬁcation of human movement.
Chapter 5 demonstrates the capability of a local wireless accelerometer node
transmitting experimental trial data by wireless connectivity to a locally positioned
laptop computer. With the considerable advances in processing power current
smartphones, portable media devices, and tablets are representative of computing
power demonstrated in Chap. 5. A wearable and wireless accelerometer and
gyroscope sensor can be mounted to a speciﬁc anatomical position for the quan-
tiﬁcation of human movement with its data package wirelessly transmitted by
Bluetooth to a smartphone, portable media device, or tablet that can subsequently
wirelessly convey the data to an Internet resource, such as a Cloud Computing data
storage resource.
The advantage of this architecture with Bluetooth is the further evolutionary
trend toward minimal encumbrance and maximal ergonomic experience of the
wearable and wireless system for the user. Reducing the wireless connectivity to a
local distance alleviates power requirements which beneﬁts volumetric and mass
requirements. Furthermore the post-processing could be either conducted through
an application available with the smartphone, portable media device, and tablet or
Cloud Computing resource. The reduction in post-processing for the actual wear-
able and wireless sensor level further beneﬁts the user experience with minimal
encumbrance.

A conﬁguration that substantially augments the acuity of the Timed 25-foot Walk
test through wearable and wireless sensors connected by Bluetooth to a tablet that
then wirelessly transmits the data package to a cloud computer resource for storage
and post-processing is addressed. Other similar applications that reduce the wear-
able and wireless sensor to the volumetric packaging on the order of a conventional
bandage are considered.
These conﬁgurations integrate both accelerometers and gyroscopes into a
cohesive inertial sensor. With six degrees of freedom provided by the inertial sensor
package a concept called sensor fusion is enabled. Sensor fusion can determine the
actual spatial position as a function of time with respect to the its mounting loca-
tion. Essentially sensor fusion can derive spatial representation, such as the
1.2

trajectory of the foot throughout the entire gait cycle. Chapter 8 presents the utility
of the integral inertial sensor package with ‘Quantifying the spatial position rep-
resentation of gait through sensor fusion’.
Chapter 8: The amalgamation of the accelerometer and gyroscope enable sensor
fusion. Through sensor fusion the inertial sensor can derive acceleration, velocity,
and displacement as a function of time. Examples of the utility of sensor fusion in
the context of gait are demonstrated by deriving the trajectory of the foot during
gait, which implies the sufﬁciency of foot clearance, and also the straightness of the
walking pathway, which represents the degree of balance during gait.
The data acquired from the inertial sensors is post-processed through an orien-
tation ﬁlter, in order to acquire spatial representation parameters, such as acceler-
ation, velocity, and displacement as a function of time. Two orientation ﬁlters
addressed are the Kalman ﬁlter and gradient descent ﬁlter. Kalman ﬁlters were
developed for the objective of providing for aerospace applications rather than for
the quantiﬁcation of human movement. In general the Kalman ﬁlter can be applied
to the post-processing of a computer not a wearable and wireless system, such as a
smartphone or portable media device.
Dr. Madgwick developed a computationally efﬁcient orientation ﬁlter for the
objective of integration into a wearable and wireless system, such as a smartphone
or portable media device, referred to as the gradient descent orientation ﬁlter.
Another advantage of this orientation ﬁlter is that it can function with a sampling
rate for the inertial sensors that is feasible for wearable and wireless systems.
Tuning is consolidated through a single parameter respective of gyroscope mea-
surement error.
The ability to apply sensor fusion for a wearable and wireless system represents
a major capability for Network Centric Therapy. A therapy team can evaluate a
patient remotely and even assess the quality and range of affected limb movement
through

A
further
post-processing capability for the recorded signal data from wearable and wireless
systems is demonstrated by machine learning. Currently, machine learning has been
successfully applied for distinguishing between notable disparities, such as a
hemiplegic pair for reﬂex response, with considerable classiﬁcation accuracy.
Chapter 9 explores the current capability and future application of machine learning
for further evolving Network Centric Therapy.
Chapter 9: Post-processing of the wearable and wireless system’s accelerometer
or gyroscope signal can produce a feature set for machine learning classiﬁcation.
An emphasis is placed on the utility of Waikato Environment for Knowledge
Analysis (WEKA) for machine learning classiﬁcation. Five algorithms are dis-
cussed from a fundamental perspective:
• J48 decision tree
• K-nearest neighbors
• Logistic regression
• Support vector machine
• Multilayer perceptron neural network

Scenarios using wearable and wireless systems for the objective of machine
learning are discussed with regards to these algorithms. Software automation
techniques for the development of a feature set consisting of contextually pertinent
quantiﬁed attributes are considered. The feature set is developed through the
establishment of an Attribute-Relation File Format (ARFF) ﬁle. The synthesis of
machine learning with wearable and wireless systems is envisioned to have con-
siderable impact for the evolution of Network Centric Therapy.
For example, machine learning based on the signal data acquired from a
wearable and wireless system can develop a classiﬁcation accuracy to objectively
determine transition status with regards to the modiﬁcation of a therapy strategy.
The potential to use machine learning in tandem with wearable and wireless sys-
tems for optimal rehabilitation and prognostic forecast are further topics of interest.
Considerable machine learning classiﬁcation accuracy through the application of
wearable and wireless systems has been achieved with regards to therapeutic sce-
narios. Chapter 10 explores the preliminary capabilities of wearable and wireless
devices for applications of homebound rehabilitation settings.
Chapter 10: Any wearable and wireless system equipped with an accelerometer
or gyroscope can be applied to a therapy scenario to quantiﬁcation of the activity.
Machine learning classiﬁcation regarding the numeric attributes of the inertial
signal can deﬁne a relevant classiﬁcation accuracy with respect to usage status.
Chapter 10 explores four applications using smartphones and portable media
devices as wearable and wireless systems representing functional wireless
accelerometer and gyroscope platforms.
As a wireless accelerometer platform the portable media device can be mounted
about the bend of a conventional cane to determine appropriate and inappropriate
usage based on machine learning classiﬁcation through logistic regression. The
support vector machine learning algorithm can be integrated with the wireless
gyroscope platform from a smartphone for identifying rehabilitation status, such as
the affected or unaffected ankle-foot complex. Further applications for homebound
therapy with wearable and wireless systems consist of applying a portable media
device as a wireless gyroscope platform for quantifying wobble board therapy. The
signal was post-processed to attain machine learning classiﬁcation accuracy of the
affected and unaffected ankle-foot complex by means of a multilayer perceptron
neural network. Eccentric training by means of Virtual Proprioception feedback
have been demonstrated using the smartphone functioning as a wireless gyroscope
platform for identifying the quality of the training based on visual feedback
assuring that a prescribed threshold is not exceeded. Subsequently, machine
learning, such as a multilayer perceptron neural network, can attain classiﬁcation
accuracy to differentiate compared to conventional training.
These preliminary endeavors demonstrate the capability of Network Centric
Therapy. A subject can conduct a prescribed therapy regiment with a wearable and
wireless system providing quantiﬁed data. A skilled therapist anywhere in the world
can access the data and have it post-processed, such as for machine learning
classiﬁcation. The classiﬁcation accuracy of the data can be applied for reﬁning the
therapy strategy or even as a prognostic indicator to convergence time to full

of the data packages as email attachments to a predetermined email resource. Future
evolution is envisioned to apply Cloud Computing using the Internet of Things as
the wearable and wireless system from the sensor level.
At the Cloud Computing level Network Centric Therapy is further established
through the assortment of post-processing capabilities. Machine learning of the data
could be applied for prognostic forecast of rehabilitation trends or even modiﬁca-
tion of therapy strategy. The historical rehabilitation trends of multiple patients
could provide a basis for rehabilitation optimization for future patients. In essence,
Cloud Computing would facilitate data science for the biomedical, health, and
rehabilitation community. Also, the rehabilitation process based on Cloud
Computing data could produce a highly focused and patient unique therapy
experience. The future trends are further addressed in Chap. 11.
Chapter 11: With the evolutionary trends leading to wearable and wireless
systems presented future trends regarding Network Centric Therapy are discussed
from the perspective of the authors. The capacity to uniquely target a patient
tailored therapy strategy augmented with machine learning computer diagnostics is
envisioned to revolutionize the rehabilitation process. A central theme to Network
Centric Therapy is the role of Cloud Computing for storage and post-processing of
data. The patient can receive highly specialized therapy feedback from therapy
experts anywhere in the world. Furthermore data science trends in Network Centric
Therapy would enable optimization of rehabilitation strategy for an assortment of
scenario. In summary Network Centric Therapy is envisioned to expand therapy
quality for patients, while signiﬁcantly reducing strain on limited medical resources.

Conclusion
The quantiﬁcation of a patient’s rehabilitation status enables a clinical team with the
feedback to reﬁne their rehabilitation strategy, such as through the quantiﬁcation of
gait and reﬂex response. The degree of acuity for quantifying gait and reﬂex
response has evolved from clinician derived ordinal scale evaluation to quantiﬁ-
cation systems reserved to a clinical environment to the advent of wearable and
wireless systems. Wearable and wireless systems, such as the smartphone and
portable media device, can readily measure and quantify gait and reﬂex charac-
teristics through their inertial sensors, such as the accelerometer and gyroscope.
Augmented with a software application the smartphone and portable media device
function as wireless accelerometer and gyroscope platforms. The acquired data can
be conveyed by wireless transmission to the Internet as an email attachment. This
capability enables the experimental and post-processing resources to be situated
anywhere in the world. The application of wearable and wireless systems, such as
the smartphone and portable media device, for the quantiﬁcation of gait and reﬂex
response constitute the commencement of a third wave of the rehabilitation expe-
rience referred to as Network Centric Therapy, which is truly an Information Age

wearable and wireless systems evaluating patient status in an autonomous setting,
machine learning augmenting the diagnostic and prognostic aspects of the reha-

quantum leap for the rehabilitation process.

Traditional Clinical Evaluation of Gait
and Reﬂex Response by Ordinal Scale
Abstract The original technique for quantifying the rehabilitation status of a
patient involves the observation by an expert clinician. Based on this expert
observation the clinician applies a subjective interpretation to a series of ordinal
scale rankings. Examples of scenarios for applying the ordinal scale methodology
involve the evaluation of the tendon reﬂex response and gait. More sophisticated
quantiﬁcation techniques that are derived from the ordinal scale approach pertain to
the evaluation of neuro-degenerative diseases, such as Friedreich’s ataxia.
Intuitively these ordinal scale techniques are subjective, which causes their relia-
bility to be a subject of controversy. Furthermore, the level of experience of the
evaluating clinician can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the reliability of the evaluation. An
alternative solution would be the incorporation of wearable and wireless systems,
such smartphones and portable media devices, for quantifying human movement,
such as gait and reﬂex response.

Introduction
In order to track the progress of a patent’s progressive response to a therapy strategy
for rehabilitation a logical means to organize the characteristics of the patient’s
status would be advantageous. Intuitively a quantiﬁed method for tracking the
rehabilitation cycle would achieve such an objective. For example, a series of
ordinal scale parameters could be established with correlated bounding criteria. An
expert clinician with years of specialized training could interpret these criteria for
determining an appropriate ordinal scale ranking. As of current the ordinal scale
technique for assessing a patient’s conditions are highly prevalent in the medical
community [1–7].

Although this ordinal scale approach may in principle appear to be a robust
means for determining patient health, there is considerable opportunity for
improvement, especially when considering the rampant presence of wearable and
wireless systems for the healthcare environment. Although an expert clinician
represents considerable acuity and knowledge with years of training, their inter-
pretation of the ordinal scale criteria is still relatively subjective. As shall be later
featured in greater detail the reliability of even a simple ﬁve point ordinal scale
technique for evaluating reﬂex response is a subject of contention [1–7].
Furthermore, there is a considerable likelihood that a person undergoing medical
evaluation for purposes, such as rehabilitation, will be evaluated by multiple clinical
professionals. Although well trained, a group of clinical experts still logically have
disparate interpretations of a ordinal scale’s criteria threshold. Inter-observer
interpretation of ordinal scale methodologies is a situation of even more contro-
versial reliability [1–7].
Before the era of wearable and wireless inertial sensors for evaluating human
movement, such as gait and reﬂex response, the ordinal scale techniques were
conventionally used in the medical community. Terse consideration of these
approaches provides relative perspective for the growing utility of wearable and
wireless systems. Multiple ordinal scale strategies are featured in this chapter, such
as reﬂex response, gait, prosthetic status, and a more sophisticated technique for
evaluating Friedreich’s ataxia severity. The role of the ordinal scale symbolizes the
ﬁrst wave with regards to the quantiﬁcation of gait and reﬂex response.
2.2
Ordinal Scale for Quantiﬁcation of Reﬂex Response
Before the introduction of electronic devices for the quantiﬁcation of biomedical
movement characteristics, such as the response of the patellar tendon, ordinal scales
were applied to ascertain the nature of the observation. The ordinal scale strategy
involved an expert clinician observing the human movement scenario, such as the
tendon reﬂex response, and applying an experienced perspective to determine the
properly representative ordinal scale parameter. The intent of the ordinal scale
strategy is to provide a quantiﬁed attribute with a patient history vantage [1–7].
Before the era of mechanical and electrical sensors, the nature of the tendon
reﬂex response was quantiﬁed as a consequence of a highly skilled expert, such as a
clinician. The clinician would manually elicit the tendon reﬂex, such as through a
neuro-reﬂex hammer. Based on the observation of the reﬂex response, the clinician
would apply the clinician’s expertise to satisfy the criteria of an established ordinal
scale, such as the NINDS Myotatic Reﬂex Scale and Mayo Clinic scale.
A representative ﬂow chart for the procedure of applying the ordinal scale
technique for quantifying the response of the tendon reﬂex is illustrated in Fig. 2.1
[4–20]. The NINDS Myotatic Reﬂex Scale consisting of ﬁve ordinal scale com-
ponents spanning from 0 to 4 is presented in Fig. 2.2 [6, 9]. The Mayo Clinic scale
represents a nine point ordinal scale for interpreting the same patellar tendon reﬂex

response [6, 10]. Also, notable is the observation that as of current a universally
applicable ordinal scale even for quantifying the reﬂex response does not exist [4–
20].
Attempts have been made through published research to establish the reliability
of the ordinal scale approach. Litvan et al. conducted a research study to ascertain
the reliability of the NINDS Myotatic Reﬂex Scale. Two evaluation perspectives
were applied: intraobserver and interobserver. Substantial to near perfect agreement
with respect to the intraobserver reliability for the application of the NINDS
Myotatic Reﬂex Scale was achieved. With respect to the interobserver vantage
moderate to substantial reliability classiﬁcation was attained. An implication of the
study is that the neurologists’ techniques are independent of their application of the
Fig. 2.1 Flow chart to the implementation of the ordinal scale for quantifying the tendon reﬂex
response [4–20]
2.2

NINDS Myotatic Reﬂex Scale. Litvan et al. advocates the NINDS Myotatic Reﬂex
Scale as a universal reﬂex evaluation scale in light of the impact of the results [9].
However, other research ﬁndings dispute the assertions of Litvan et al.
The NINDS Myotatic Reﬂex Scale is only comprised of ﬁve ordinal scale ratings.
Manschot et al. determined in an alternative study that the ordinal scale method-
ology did not attain sufﬁcient reliability. The study by Manschot applied the ﬁve
point NINDS Myotatic Reﬂex Scale and nine point Mayo Clinic scale with respect
to the deep tendon reﬂex. From the interobserver perspective both ordinal reﬂex
scales did not exceed a reliability classiﬁcation of fair [10].
Stam and van Crevel further evolve the disputed concerns regarding the relia-
bility of the ordinal scale strategy for quantifying the deep tendon reﬂex. The
research by Stam and van Crevel pertained to the consideration of the nine ordinal
point Mayo Clinic scale. This study emphasized a considerable lack of congruency
among neurologists. The neurologist were in disagreement for 28% of the exami-
nations by at least two ordinal scale units. Furthermore, there was disagreement
with respect to the presence of asymmetry for 45% of the reﬂex pairs [11]. These
ﬁndings underscore the considerable potential for interobserver lack of coherent
consensus.

2.3
Ordinal Scale Technique for Gait
The ordinal scale strategy also pertains the evaluation of gait. This approach can
apply a quantiﬁed perspective as to the status of gait rehabilitation [21–23]. Five
ordinal themed gait evaluation techniques are:
• New York Medical School Orthotic Gait Analysis
• Hemiplegic Gait Analysis Form
• Wisconsin Gait Scale
• Gait Assessment and Intervention Tool
• Rivermead Visual Gait Assessment
These techniques in general incorporate kinematic and temporal variables. From a
traditional gait analysis and quantiﬁcation perspective these gait evaluation tech-
niques are low cost in nature as the processes require the presence of expert clin-
icians and in some cases a video recording [24]. Quantitative techniques that
associate with gait evaluation, although derived from subjective criteria, are cur-
rently utilized in the healthcare community, such as for people with amputation [25,
26].
Another issue is that decrements regarding the quality of gait are subtle in nature.
Intuitively the acuity of gait evaluation is highly dependent on the observing
clinician’s subjective interpretation. For example, less experienced clinicians have
been discovered to provide evaluations that are moderately reliable [27].
2.4
Ordinal Scale Strategy for Friedreich’s Ataxia
Friedreich’s ataxia was preliminarily discerned by Nikolaus Friedreich during the
1860s, and the incidence is on the order of 1.5 per 100,000 persons per year.
A characteristic feature involves diminished coordination respective of deliberate
motion. For example, the coordination of gait becomes progressively impaired.
Furthermore, sensory neural pathways decline, which cause tendon reﬂexes to
become effectively absent. With the waning of proprioceptive feedback, the ability
to sustain independent locomotion becomes substantially impaired [28–30].
Proprioception constitutes a signiﬁcant afferent neural feedback regarding the
synchronicity adaptivity of gait, for which the quality of tendon reﬂex efﬁcacy and
modulation represents a signiﬁcant contribution [6, 15, 21].
An

neuro-degeneration regarding Friedreich’s ataxia. The Friedreich’s Ataxia Rating
Scale (FARS) is applied in a structured clinical environment through the obser-
vation of specialized experts [31]. The Timed 25 Foot Walk (T25FW) test serves as
an integral role with facilitating the FARS score. The test consists of timing the
duration for a subject to traverse a distance of 25 feet, such as through a conven-
tional hallway [32].
2.3
Ordinal Scale Technique for Gait
25

The ability of the Timed 25 Foot Walk test to truly ascertain the degree of
neuro-degeneration for a person with Friedreich’s ataxia is a subject of debate. The
Timed 25 Foot Walk test provides only a clinical snapshot of the subject’s actual
status. For example, the level of fatigue and state of alertness could greatly inﬂuence
the brief assessment provide through the application of the Timed 25 Foot Walk
test. Especially, since Friedreich’s ataxia inherently correlates to a subject’s ability
to maintain balance while sustaining gait, any distracting inﬂuences during the test
could cause a devolution to a more protracted and conservative gait strategy. Also,
the test only quantiﬁes the temporal displacement between 25 feet of walking, not
speciﬁc attributes, such as leg position during stance and swing phase and gait
pathway coordination, which can be better determined through wearable and
wireless systems with inertial sensors.
Wearable and wireless systems offer the potential to revolutionize conventional
clinical assessments, such as the Timed 25 Foot Walk test. The inherent inertial
sensors can be applied to measure gait and even establish a feature set for machine
learning classiﬁcation. The synthesis of machine learning and gait quantiﬁcation
through wearable and wireless devices has the potential to substantially advance
diagnostic acuity and prognostic foresight [33]. Other post-processing techniques
could lead the development of the actual walking pathway and displacement, which
could also derive the quality of balance and foot clearance during swing phase of
gait [34].
2.5
Transition to Wearable and Wireless Systems
In light of the historical perspective of conventional ordinal scale strategies, the
potential for wearable and wireless inertial systems that are provided by smart-
phones and portable media devices for transitioning to the prevalent means for
ascertaining patient health is envisioned. There are other concerns to address when
contrasting the traditional ordinal scale methodology to the considerable potential
of wearable and wireless systems for evaluating patient status. Regardless of the
ability of a team of clinicians to cohesively interpret ordinal scale rankings, they
constitute a limited and highly specialized resource. By contrast to strained medical
economies, wearable and wireless inertial systems enabled by smartphones and
portable media devices for quantifying human movement, such as gait and reﬂex
response, are essentially mass-produced [1–7].
Furthermore a clinician has a limited amount of time to evaluate a bounded
threshold of subjects. For example, one medical expert clinician may be responsible
for on the order of ten patients. By contrast, a mass-produced certiﬁed wearable and
wireless inertial system can be applied to thousands of patents for the reliable
quantiﬁcation of their movement features.
Other issues to consider are the timing and logistics of clinical appointments.

location. The meeting merely provides a clinical snapshot of the patient’s true
rehabilitation status.
The use of wearable and wireless systems enables a patient to be evaluated at the
convenience of a setting of choice, such as a familiar homebound environment.
These devices can establish rehabilitation status over a considerable length of time.
Trend analysis and historical contrast of the quantiﬁed data can optimize the
rehabilitation experience. This capability facilitates the origins of Network Centric
Therapy with allusions toward the synthesis of data science and rehabilitation.
2.6
Conclusion
The traditional approach for quantifying the status of a patient emphasized the use
of ordinal scale techniques. The ordinal scale is determined by the expert although
subjective interpretation by an expert clinician regarding human movement fea-
tures. Two examples are gait and reﬂex response. These techniques span a range of
complexity from the ﬁve point ordinal scale for characterizing reﬂex response to
sophisticated procedures that utilize ordinal ranking, such as for evaluating
Friedreich’s ataxia. The reliability of these ordinal scale approaches is a subject of
contention while being inﬂuenced by the experience of the clinician. An alternative
solution applies wearable and wireless systems for the quantiﬁcation of movement
characteristics, such as gait and reﬂex response using smartphones and portable
media devices that are equipped with inertial sensors, such as accelerometers and
gyroscopes. With respect to Network Centric Therapy these wearable and wireless
systems imply the conﬂuence of data science and rehabilitation.

Quantiﬁcation Systems Appropriate
for a Clinical Setting
Abstract Conventional gait quantiﬁcation is provided in a highly structured
clinical setting. These devices represent a metaphorical second wave encompassing
clinically standard quantiﬁcation techniques. Traditional gait quantiﬁcation sys-
tems, such as force plates, EMG, foot-switches, and motion capture systems are
described in the chapter for gait analysis. Their relevance for objectively quanti-
fying the status of a patient’s rehabilitation progress is advocated. Regarding reﬂex
quantiﬁcation the application of motion capture systems, EMG, and strain/force
sensors are covered in the chapter. There are drawbacks of these devices, such as
expense, complexity, and limitations to a clinical setting. By contrast, wearable and
wireless systems are projected to transcend the capabilities of these traditional
quantiﬁcation systems with expanded autonomy for subject evaluation in the
context of Network Centric Therapy.

Introduction
Research has advocated the utility of quantiﬁed gait analysis. For example,
healthy motor control and abnormal motor control can be readily contrasted.
A rehabilitation strategy and prescribed therapy can be objectively considered for
the efﬁcacy of progressively modifying and restoring healthy gait for a patient [1–
11].
One standard approach for quantifying gait is through the traditional clinical gait
laboratory. The gait laboratory generally requires a subject traveling to the facility.
The laboratory environment could be characterized as resource intensive, as a
number of skilled technicians would be required to operate the specialized gait
analysis equipment. Relative to the previous chapter, the gait laboratory can provide
a rehabilitation team with a considerable degree of quantiﬁed gait analysis data

acuity compared to an ordinal scale ranking, which may be subject to debate among
multiple clinical experts. However, the technical resources and expense to develop
a research grade clinical laboratory may restrict the number of rehabilitation sub-
jects to be provided with such a focused therapy approach.
Figure 3.1 demonstrates a standard walkway for a gait laboratory. Note that the
platform is spatially conﬁned in nature. Such a clinical environment may provide a
representative snapshot of a subject’s gait rehabilitation status. By contrast, wear-
able and wireless systems are envisioned to enable autonomous environment
evaluation of subjects, such as in a homebound setting, with Network Centric
Therapy enabling highly speciﬁed rehabilitation capabilities [1–11].
The application of conventional gait analysis apparatus to quantify gait consti-
tutes a second wave of technology evolution. These devices can considerably
augment the acuity of the rehabilitation progression for a speciﬁc subject. Pathways
encompassed in the third wave enabling Network Centric Therapy are feasible, but

limited in scope to the patient domain. For example, machine learning has been
demonstrated through the signal post-processing of force plate and optical motion
capture data [12–16].
3.2
Conventional Systems for Gait Analysis
Conventional gait analysis devices can establish quantiﬁed evaluation of gait status.
Six traditional gait analysis tools are:
• Foot switches
• Electrogoniometers
• Electromyogram (EMG)
• Metabolic analysis
• Optical motion cameras
• Force plates
Foot switches and electrogoniometers represent relatively fundamental versions of
wearable systems for gait analysis, which may be inside or outside of a gait lab-
oratory. However, the EMG, metabolic analysis, optical motion cameras, and force
plates are generally reserved for a specialized clinical gait laboratory. Foot switches
acquire a signal during the stance phase of gait for each step. Electrogoniometers
and optical motion camera systems acquire kinematic gait data. The force plate
provides kinetic measurements regarding gait. EMG equipment ascertains the
neuromuscular activity of the muscle under consideration, such as concentric or
eccentric contraction. Metabolic analysis determines the level of metabolic
expenditure during an activity, such as walking [1, 3–11, 17].
Further reﬁnement of the proper device for a gait analysis experiment can be
better elucidated through the consideration of two domains of biomechanical
analysis: kinematics and kinetics. Kinematics pertain to the scope of human
movement in terms of measurement and observation. For instance, kinematics of
human gait pertains to measurements, such as range of motion, joint velocity, joint
acceleration, rate of angular rotation about a joint, and the respective angular
acceleration. These quantities can be measured through systems, such as an optical
motion camera [9–11, 17].
These devices may be applied in application speciﬁc or an integrated context.
For example, a force plate can evaluate ground reaction force for a subject during
stance phase as a singular gait analysis tool. Another consideration is the context of
synchronized gait analysis apparatus, such as an optical motion camera and a force
plate. The signals for both of these devices can be synthesized through
post-processing to derive more sophisticated analysis, such as the calculated work
and power about the ankle, knee, and hip joints [9–11, 17].
However, kinematics does not observe the forces that generate the respective
joint motion under consideration. The other domain of biomechanical analysis
3.1
Introduction
33

kinetics measures the forces that produce joint motion. For this context the ground
reaction force plate is highly relevant [9–11, 17].
3.2.1
Foot Switches
The foot switch acquires a temporal feature of gait and is activated during the stance
phase of gait. Therefore the temporal duration of stance phase and associated swing
phase can be deﬁned [1, 8]. Although the foot switch may provide limited temporal
data regarding the transitional phases of the gait cycle, it may be applied in
autonomous environments.
Although the foot switch constitutes a basic gait analysis tool, it can be integrally
applied with more sophisticated gait analysis equipment. Lee et al. developed a
wireless accelerometer system for quantifying gait activity, which was applied with
tandem operation of a foot switch. Since the application by Lee et al. was resear-
ched, developed, tested, and evaluated during the preliminary phases of wireless
accelerometers for gait analysis, the foot switch facilitated the interpretation of the
accelerometer signal during stance and swing phase [18, 19].
The implications of the research provided by Lee et al. emphasize that although
the foot switch can solely identify temporal alternations between stance and swing
phase of gait, the device can be applied to augment the acuity of a novel wearable
and wireless system such as with respect to post-processing spatial displacement of
gait as a function of time through sensor fusion. For example, the role of a foot
switch for identifying swing and stance phase can be particularly useful with a
wearable and wireless system for gait analysis using six degrees of freedom through
an accelerometer and gyroscope. As addressed in Chap. 8, some algorithms apply a
zero-velocity update during stance phase to effectively reset the computational
process according to the implied constraints of a stationary foot during aspects of
stance phase. The foot switch could possibly be applied to augment the acuity of a
zero velocity update during stance phase.
3.2.2
Electrogoniometers
The fundamental role of the electrogonimeter is to evaluate limb orientation about a
speciﬁed joint. The most basic electrogoniometer measures the spatial representa-
tion of a limb respective of a singular plane. More advanced electrogoniometers are
capable of quantifying limb position about all three planes pertinent to gait [1, 8].
One basic principle for deriving the electrogoniometer signal is the acquisition of
a change in voltage as a consequence for a modulation in resistance. The subse-
quent signal can be digitized for post-processing. A visualized alternative would be
the simulation of the joints and limbs during gait, such as through a stick ﬁgure
representation. The electrogoniometer can accurately represent the orientation of
34
3
Quantiﬁcation Systems Appropriate for a Clinical Setting

the ankle, knee, and hip joints. Adverse gait patterns, such as circumduction about
the coronal plane, can be quantiﬁed to ascertain the level of severity [1, 8].
Electrogoniometers technically represent a wearable system for the domain of
gait analysis. However, the technology evolution of wearable and wireless systems
utilizing inertial sensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, are foreseen to
transcend the development of electrogoniometers. Chapter 4 identiﬁes the evolu-
tionary trends that considerably support the development of wearable and wireless
systems for the quantiﬁcation of human movement, such as gait and reﬂex
response.
3.2.3
Electromyogram (EMG)
The EMG provides acuity to the neuromuscular activity of a targeted muscle
group. The EMG signal acquires the status of muscle activation by neural
recruitment. The synchronicity of a muscle group can be evaluated through an
EMG sensor [1, 6, 8, 10, 11].
EMG sensor surface electrodes are applied cutaneously proximal to the muscle
body or potentially multiple aspects of the muscle under consideration. EMG signal
clarity can be enhanced through abrading the skin adjacent to the predetermined
muscle. The EMG sensor electrode is secured by a medium, such as an
electro-cream, which also beneﬁts the transmissibility of the neural signal.
The EMG apparatus is comprised of ﬁve primary aspects:
• Surface electrode
• Electrode wire
• Transmit ampliﬁer
• Data translator
• Computer
The surface electrode acquires the signal by wire to the transmit ampliﬁer, which
ampliﬁes the signal to the data translator. From the data translator the signal is
conveyed to a local computer for post-processing [10, 11].
A notable issue for the EMG as a gait analysis tool is the level of expertise
required to operate the EMG device, such as targeting and application to the
appropriate muscle group. The EMG signal constitutes an intrinsic link between
cortical volition and the kinematic effect of the movement. Saremi et al. noted
during their research that EMG muscle activity is temporally linked to the asso-
ciated acceleration waveform [20]. Therefore, the traditional operation of EMG
equipment and its impact implies the transitional relevance of wearable and wireless
systems featuring inertial sensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, given
their temporal synchronicity. By contrast to EMG sensors, wearable and wireless
systems can be applied to anatomical mounting points that are readily identiﬁable in
consideration of the patient, such as the lateral malleolus about the ankle joint [3–6,
10, 11].

3.2.4
Metabolic Analysis
Compensatory gait strategies result in decremented metabolic efﬁciency. The
impacts of a metabolically inefﬁcient gait can be ascertained through metabolic
analysis. Current metabolic analysis systems are represented through portable gas
analysis equipment. These applications measure oxygen consumption [9–11].
Though metabolic analysis systems a subject’s energy expenditure from a
metabolic perspective can be objectively quantiﬁed. The recordings can be com-
pared to scenarios, such as a control or resting baseline. The relative metabolic
efﬁciency can be acquired relative to a well-deﬁned baseline to ascertain metabolic
efﬁciency [9–11].
3.2.5
Optical Motion Cameras (Kinematics of Human
Motion)
Standard optical motion capture camera equipment enables the recording of motion,
such as gait, using a two-dimensional recording. Gait is prevalently represented
through the sagittal plane, which can be sufﬁciently acquired using a two-
dimensional motion camera recording. Reﬂective markers are positioned at speciﬁc
anatomical features for the acquisition of joint position, angles, and rates of motion.
The motion capture data is processed through an assortment of software applica-
tions for the establishment of kinematic data. These software programs span the
range from highly sophisticated and expensive to online systems that are essentially
freeware [10, 11, 17].
Two inherent requirements for the successful operation of are a stable recording
platform and proper lighting. Stability for the optical motion capture system is
generally satisﬁed through the use of a tripod frame. For scenarios, such as
high-speed recording, a stable platform is particularly signiﬁcant. High-speed
recording is especially sensitive to the quality of the lighting environment [10, 11].
Lighting scenarios that should be avoided are ambient lighting and outdoor
lighting. Because the traditional phosphorescent light pulses at a frequency of about
60 Hz, it should be avoided as a primary lighting source, especially in consideration
of the motion capture recording rate. Outdoor lighting is inherently variable. For
example, sudden cloud cover could alter the lighting intensity. Also, with respect to
reproducibility of experiments involving motion capture the consistency of the
lighting intensity is a subject of consideration. A morning recording session would
likely have a contradictory lighting intensity by contrast to a later in the day
recording of a motion capture experiment [10, 11].
There are two approaches for resolving the lighting consistency and intensity,
such as conventional tungsten light bulb or light emitting diodes known as LED’s.
The tungsten light bulb produces a brighter lighting intensity compared to the LED.
A decrement to the application of tungsten lighting is the considerable generation of
36
3
Quantiﬁcation Systems Appropriate for a Clinical Setting

thermal energy, which may even constitute a hazard during the experimental testing
and evaluation. The LED is generally less expensive relative to the tungsten light
bulb. Lighting intensity is directly proportional to the recording frame rate
requirement. In the event of a need for color recording, additional lighting intensity
is required [10, 11].
Optical motion capture equipment is generally featured with standard parame-
ters, such as frame rate, resolution, and exposure. These parameters intuitively have
trade offs with regards to other matters, such storage capacity and available data
transfer mechanisms. Consideration of the markers is also imperative for the proper
operation of a motion capture device, and with respect to the use of a dark or color
background white markers are advised [10, 11].
Exposure and resolution are parameters that inﬂuence image quality. Exposure is
an adjustable feature for the standard motion capture apparatus, which determines
the amount of light exposed to the lens. Amplifying the exposure provides superior
image contrast with more light incident on the lens of the motion capture camera.
The upper bound for the motion capture device’s resolution is inﬂuenced according
to the performance of the lens. Greater resolution is correlated with more pixels to
deﬁne the vision ﬁeld, which can enhance the ability to quantify movement, such as
human gait. Lens size is in proportion to resolution, however, larger lens are also
generally associated with more expensive equipment [10, 11].
The other parameter frame rate determines the number of frames recorded per
second. For conventional motion capture devices the frame rate can range from 1 to
2000 Hz. A bounding condition for the feasible maximum frame rate is the
intensity of external lighting. As an example higher frame rate with conventional
external lighting source would cause darker imaging for a motion capture camera
recording [10, 11].
Another experimental design consideration is the amount of data storage and the
time elapse to consolidate the recorded data to storable media, which can be directly
impacted by selected frame rate. In the event that a considerable number of trial
sample are planned to be recorded the download time can signiﬁcantly impact the
feasibility of the experiment. Internet enabled approaches for collaborating with
collaborators situated at a distance, such as email and Cloud Computing, have
maximum data size thresholds [10, 11].
With respect to local access to the data package optical motion camera systems
require a means to access nearby post-processing resources. Two conventional
approaches for data transfer involve USB cable and memory card. Subsequently,
the data package can be reviewed as a .mov or.mp4 ﬁle for initial screening
[10, 11].
Motion capture data of the spatial temporal nature of a series of reﬂective
markers can be further reduced to more substantive kinematic data. Depending on
the orientation of the prescribed marker positions joint angles and the rotational
rates of the respective joint angles can be computed. Each frame of motion capture
data possesses a discrete temporal characteristic based on the frame rate, for which
spatial temporal relationships can be derived. For example, properly mounted
reﬂective markers about the lower leg can derive knee and ankle joint angles and
3.2

joint angular rotation rates [17]. Free software packages for video analysis are
available through the Internet, such as ImageJ, Kinovea, and Tracker [21–23].
3.2.6
Force Plates
The force plate represents an effective means for acquiring the ground reaction
force generated during the stance phase of gait. The traditional force plate is sta-
tionary in nature and embedded in a walking platform for a standard gait laboratory.
Force plates generally involve transducers that record force through the piezo-
electric effect, piezo-resistivity, capacitors, and strain gauges. The resultant electric
signal is in proportion to the contact force generated during stance phase of gait [1,
6, 9–11, 14–17].
Although the force plate is restricted to a clinical environment, such as a gait
laboratory, an advantage of the force plate is the inherent simplicity of operation.
Upon turning the force plate on with its associated software and supporting com-
puter, a preliminary initialization phase enables the calibration of the device. The
force plate samples at a considerable rate, such as 1000 Hz. The prescribed tem-
poral duration for the recording sample can be managed at the discretion of the
operator [10, 11, 14–17].
A notable observation is that the force plate is stationary and embedded in a gait
platform as shown in Fig. 3.2. However, gait is kinetic, dynamic, and somewhat
variable in nature. The gait analysis team supervising the experiment must prepare
the subject for making stance phase contact during natural gait on the force plate. In
Fig. 3.2 Force plate embedded into a standard gait analysis platform for a clinical gait laboratory
38
3
Quantiﬁcation Systems Appropriate for a Clinical Setting

order to achieve proper contact with the force plate a predetermined starting point
must be designated through a preliminary trial and error phase of the experiment.
Also, the subject should sustain a consistent line of sight and neck orientation while
walking. The subject should also maintain a self-selected walking velocity at the
discretion of the subject and gait analysis team, which may be conﬁrmed through a
stopwatch, while ensuring the subject continues walking beyond the force plate in a
sustained manner in order to mitigate transient variability and maintain a sufﬁ-
ciently steady state [10, 11].
The utility of the force plate as a ubiquitous gait analysis apparatus is established
by the signiﬁcance of the stance phase of gait. Within the stance phase of gait are
three subphases:
• Controlled plantar ﬂexion
• Controlled dorsiﬂexion
• Powered plantar ﬂexion
Controlled plantar ﬂexion represents the deceleration aspect of stance subphase,
which mitigates a sudden slapping of the foot to the ground, which could poten-
tially lead to a degenerative pathway for gait sustainability. The controlled
dorsiﬂexion subphase involves energy storage and smooth transition to the powered
plantar ﬂexion subphase. During this subphase motive power is derived from the
plantar ﬂexors [9, 10, 24]. In fact, the majority of mechanical power applied to gait
derives from plantar ﬂexion [9, 10, 24–27].
Human gait is manifested as highly rhythmic and synchronous in nature as
evidenced by the supporting neurology, such as through contribution from cortical
structures, proprioception, and the central pattern generator [7, 28, 29]. Intuitively,
the ground reaction force signal derived from the force plate is implied by similar
rhythmic and synchronous features. Figure 3.3 provides a graph perspective of the
ground reaction force generated by the stance phase of gait. The vertical aspect of
the three dimensional vector force plate recording signiﬁes the ground reaction
force, which produces a distinct double hump proﬁle with two maxima. The pre-
liminary maxima involve the deceleration segment of stance phase, which is
commonly termed as braking. The following maxima represent the acceleration
aspect of stance phase frequently known as push-off [9–11, 30, 31].
With the consistency of the ground reaction force proﬁle a feature set can be
serviced for machine learning classiﬁcation. The feature set consists in general of
kinematic and temporal aspects of the ground reaction force recording. A diversity
of machine learning algorithms has been successfully applied to accurately classify
gait scenarios [14–16]. For example, logistics regression was applied to distinguish
between a subject’s hemiplegic affected ankle-foot-complex and unaffected
ankle-foot-complex during gait [14]. In another endeavor, the support vector
machine was applied to differential between to disparate classes of transtibial
prostheses, such as a Solid Ankle Cushioned Heel (SACH) and BiOM actuator
powered prosthesis with powered plantar ﬂexion [15]. Further experimentation lead
to the application of a multilayer perceptron neural network for classifying between
3.2

39

two distinct software platforms controlling the operation of the BiOM actuator
powered prosthesis with powered plantar ﬂexion [16].
3.3
Synergistic Operation of Clinical Gait Laboratory
Resources for Gait Analysis and Associated Signal
Processing
Conventional gait analysis equipment can be recorded in a tandem manner for
further post-processing of pertinent gait data. With optical motion capture obtaining
kinematic data and a force plate providing kinetic data the work and power about a
speciﬁc joint can be computationally derived. Intuitively, the signals of both the
force plate and motion capture camera systems must be synchronized [10, 11].
Two approaches for signal synchronization are available for consideration. The
signals of the optical motion capture camera and force plate can be synchronized
through a mutual event that is also quantiﬁable. One example that satisﬁes this
criteria is the initial contact that occurs at the preliminary aspect of stance phase
during gait. The ground reaction force recorded by the force plate would exceed a
predetermined threshold. From the spatial temporal perspective of the optical
motion capture camera the time rate of change with respect to vertical displacement
of a speciﬁc marker would approach zero. Another method would be to have both
gait analysis devices emulate an extraneous signal capable of achieving mutual
synchronization, such as a sinusoidal pulse. This method is useful for EMG signal
Fig. 3.3 Ground reaction force proﬁle of stance phase during gait based on BiOM powered
prosthesis [15]
40

Quantiﬁcation Systems Appropriate for a Clinical Setting

synchronization with regards to other tandem operated gait analysis equipment [10,
11].
Following the testing and evaluation of gait analysis equipment the acquired data
sample may require further ﬁltering of the measured signal. Applying a signal ﬁlter,
such as a low pass ﬁlter, is especially relevant in the event that the sampling
frequency considerably exceeds the realistic frequency content of a representative
gait scenario. For instance, a disturbance about the 100 Hz frequency range is
probably a consequence of the actual gait analysis equipment rather than the natural
gait being recorded. One remedy to such a situation would be the application of a
low pass ﬁlter that ﬁlters out higher frequency, such as the 10 Hz low pass
Butterworth ﬁlter [17].
Another consideration is the lower threshold for a relevant sampling rate. The
minimal threshold for a sampling rate is derived as a consequence of the Nyquist
criterion. The Nyquist criterion for minimal sampling frequency is twice the upper
threshold for the actual recorded frequency content. Saremi et al. successfully
applied a portable accelerometer system for gait analysis with a sampling rate of
32 Hz. The implication is the upper frequency threshold of the actual gait cycle
measured would be about 16 Hz [6, 10, 11, 20].
3.4
Electromechanical Techniques for Reﬂex
Quantiﬁcation
As the tendon reﬂex response is a representative aspect of gait, similar themed
techniques for the quantiﬁcation of tendon reﬂexes are derived from the sensor
mechanisms that measure and quantify gait [6, 7, 28, 29]. EMG is capable of
quantifying the response of the tendon reﬂex, and motorized devices have been
applied with EMG to determine the nature of the tendon reﬂex response [28, 29,
32–34]. Using the concept of manually operated reﬂex hammers that are instru-
mented the torque and force characteristics of the patellar tendon reﬂex response
have been determined [28, 29, 35, 36]. Further reﬁnement of the technique to
quantify the tendon reﬂex response through electro-mechanical means have
involved actuators for eliciting the tendon reﬂex with measurement of the response
by a strain gauge, which is a standard electro-mechanical sensor [28, 29, 37–39].
More advanced concepts for measuring the reﬂex response have involved the
application of optical motion capture systems and the use of triaxial accelerometers
[28, 29, 40–43]. The application of wireless accelerometers that are essentially
wearable provide enhanced utility for the quantiﬁcation of the patellar tendon reﬂex
response with minimal encumbrance in terms of mass and volumetric package and
also wireless signal transmission rather than tethering, which is effectively obsolete
[6, 28, 29, 44–49].

Conclusion
Traditional gait quantiﬁcation systems generally exceed the feedback perceptivity
of ordinal scale methodologies based on clinically expert yet subjective interpre-
tation. Therefore they represent a second wave with respect to quantiﬁcation sys-
tems for therapy and rehabilitation. Generally these conventional devices reside in
clinical gait laboratory settings, which imply a logistical issue with respect to
patient accessibility. Furthermore the majority of these clinical quantiﬁcation sys-
tems require a level of specialization for their operation and post-processing.
Similar themed electromechanical techniques have also been successfully applied to
the scenario of tendon reﬂex response quantiﬁcation. Transition from these second
wave applications proceeds to the wearable and eventually wireless systems fea-
tured in the nascent third wave leading to the development of Network Centric
Therapy. These capabilities are further addressed in Chap. 4.

Chapter 4
The Rise of Inertial Measurement Units
Abstract An inherent aspect of the development of wearable and wireless systems
has been the progressive evolution of the inertial measurement unit. Although when
preliminarily recommended for quantifying the aspects of human movement, the
inertial measurement was not sufﬁciently developed for application as a wearable
and wireless system. With the steady advance from other industries accelerometers
became feasible as wearable applications for monitoring activity status and other
biomedical and rehabilitation themed scenarios. Eventually wearable accelerometer
systems developed from data logger conﬁgurations to devices with local wireless
connectivity.

Introduction
Quantiﬁed gait analysis serves a critical role as to the assessment of rehabilitation
therapy efﬁcacy. Using a quantiﬁcation methodology for evaluating the status of
neuro-motor quality with respect to gait can provide feedback for modiﬁcation the
therapy strategy [1, 2]. The possibilities for patient and therapist interaction are
signiﬁcantly advanced with the application of accelerometers and associated inertial
sensors, and far greater capabilities are enabled with the promotion of these inertial
sensors as wearable and wireless systems. In particular the ability to evaluate people
undergoing rehabilitation from the comfort of a home-bound setting through
wearable and wireless systems with the acuity and experienced perspective of a
therapist remotely situated with considerable post-processing capability, such as
through machine learning, is rapidly becoming a matter of the near future [3–7].
The application of inertial sensors to record human movement characteristics has
been an ambitious goal for over the past half century. During the 1950s the
application of accelerometers was considered for the quantiﬁcation of movement.
However, at the era of the 1950s when inertial sensors, such as the accelerometer,

were proposed for the quantiﬁcation of motion they were not sufﬁciently evolved
for human application [6, 8, 9].
During the timeframe of the 1950s accelerometers were relatively cumbersome
for application as a wearable apparatus for human motion quantiﬁcation. Intuitively
at that time, they were also prohibitively expensive. Also, the reliability of the
1950s era accelerometer was a subject of debate [6, 9].
4.2
Evolutionary Pathway for Inertial Sensors
The evolutionary pathway for the development of inertial sensors, such as
accelerometers, to become relevant to the biomedical and rehabilitation industry has
relied on the research and development of industries that also had a motivation for
the miniaturization, cost reduction, and improvement of reliability [3–7]. Another
signiﬁcant industry that especially during the 1990s promoted the advance of
accelerometer technology was the automotive industry. Accelerometers provide an
inherent role for the operation of an airbag release system that is ubiquitous to the
automotive industry product line. Such synergy of technology promoted expanded
production capacity, while stimulating trends in decreasing cost of production.
Other associated trends pertained to advances in quality and reliability [6, 9, 10].
A notable driving trend is the observation that the microelectronics industry is
inherently correlated with inertial sensor applications, such as accelerometers. With
the association to the microelectronics industry Moore’s Law presents a consider-
able evolutionary stimulus for research, development, test, and evaluation trends for
inertial sensors. Moore’s Law emphasizes that for a microelectronics chip the
quantity of transistors doubles approximately ever two years. Further interpretations
of Moore’s Law are progressive trends for enhanced performance and decreasing
cost [6]. These developmental trends are highly pertinent with respect to the domain
of application possibilities for the expanding capabilities of wearable and currently
wireless inertial sensors for the ﬁeld of quantifying human movement [3–7].
The production of accelerometer systems has become progressively advanced
through the application of micro-machining. One technique involves micro-
machining to develop a proof mass mounted to a spring platform. A signal rep-
resentative of the amount of deﬂection caused by acceleration is derived from the
proof mass situated on the deﬂecting platform [9].
Subsequent to the research and development advancements inﬂuenced by the
automotive industry for inertial sensors, such as the accelerometer. Other pro-
gressive evolutionary trends regarding the improvement of the accelerometer sys-
tem have been observed. During the time span from the mid-1990s to the
mid-2000s accelerometers have advanced in miniaturization with reductions in
volumetric packaging. Also, the number of available axes has expanded from
uniaxial to biaxial to triaxial accelerometers [6, 10].
A particular advantage of a three axis accelerometer by contrast to a uniaxial or
biaxial accelerometer is the observation that the accelerometer signal can be readily
46
4
The Rise of Inertial Measurement Units

normalized to the local acceleration of gravity. This capability of the three axis
accelerometers for robustly measuring the local acceleration of gravity signiﬁcantly
alleviates the mounting requirements for the accelerometer node about an
anatomical position of the body. The application of a three axis accelerometer as
opposed to a two axis accelerometer greatly facilitated the progressive research,
development, testing, and evaluation for the quantiﬁcation of gait and reﬂex
response [6, 10–23].
The current and recent state of accelerometer technology evaluation permits the
feasibility of applying such inertial systems for their application as portable
equipment for quantiﬁed measurement of gait. Accelerometers intuitively measure
the static and dynamic acceleration [9]. The static signal is based on the local
gravity. The dynamic acceleration signal represents the quantiﬁed movement being
recorded such as human locomotion [9–13, 22, 23].
With the progressive improvements in accelerometer technology the application
of accelerometer sensor nodes for the quantiﬁed measurement of human movement
has
become
increasingly
prevalent.
Notable
research
advocating
portable
accelerometer system applications has been published from the mid 1990s to the
mid 2000s [6, 22, 23]. Trends are now implicating the utility of fully wireless and
wearable inertial systems for measuring a considerable assortment of human
movement activities [3–7, 24].
During the mid 1990s accelerometer devices were sufﬁciently portable and
lightweight to be realistically applied to the quantiﬁcation of gait analysis. Also,
their pervasive technological relevance has further promoted their economic prac-
ticality as a cost-effective alternative. Logically these desirable features have pro-
moted accelerometer systems for the use of minimally intrusive means for
objectively quantifying gait. These ﬁndings imply the capability for applying
accelerometer systems as wearable applications beyond the conﬁned conditions of
traditional clinical gait laboratories [6, 9, 10].
4.3
Application Scenarios for Accelerometer Systems
Accelerometer systems have become progressively integrated into the analysis of
gait. With the identiﬁcation of gait abnormality from a quantiﬁed perspec-
tive proactive therapy interventions can be applied as a preventative approach
[3–7, 9, 10]. In particular the quantiﬁed measurements through the acuity of a
wearable inertial sensor, such as an accelerometer system, likely transcend the
perceptivity of a clinician’s interpretation. For example, even the accelerometer
signal for a series of gait experiments can be easily stored for progressive contrast
[3–7]. By contrast, even a considerably skilled clinician may not speciﬁcally
recollect a series of monthly scheduled evaluations with a multitude of subjects to
consider.
Another perspective to address is the amount of experience a clinician has
developed. Progressive and degenerative decrements for the quality of gait and
4.2
Evolutionary Pathway for Inertial Sensors
47

associated balance can be subtle to the extent of being quite challenging to discern.
The clinical procedures for evaluating gait disorders and the correlated efﬁcacy of
treatment are inherently qualitative. In general, only moderate reliability is attained
by clinical gait analysis techniques, and the reliability is proportional to the degree
of clinical experience. In response to such research ﬁndings objective instrumen-
tation is advocated for the determination of the efﬁcacy of an intervention strategy
for a patient’s gait [25].
Accelerometer systems have become increasingly signiﬁcant and relevant for the
rehabilitation environment. Quantiﬁed data from the acceleration signal can be
provided to augment the determination of therapy efﬁcacy and diagnostic acuity.
Wearable
inertial
sensors,
such
as
wireless
accelerometers
and
wireless
accelerometer platforms enable such quantiﬁed and objective measurements of gait
characteristics [3–7, 10–13, 22, 23].
By mounting an accelerometer system to a particular aspect, such as the trunk,
contextually speciﬁc gait parameters can be acquired [3–7, 10, 22, 23]. Through
mounting an accelerometer system about the trunk during gait hip loading patterns,
such as hip abduction moment, have been approximated [26, 27]. Positioning
accelerometers proximal to the lumbar and sacral portions of the vertebra have
provided spatial temporal parameters for locomotion [28–30]. Furthermore,
intrinsic aspects of gait quality, such as stability and balance, have also been
characterized, better elucidating the spatial temporal relationship with respect to the
head and pelvis or trunk [31, 32].
A notable advantage of the accelerometer system is that they are inherently
portable. Also, these devices are noninvasive with respect to representative motion.
The accelerometer systems have been demonstrated as robustly suitable for
assessing movement variation with objectively quantiﬁed measurements. Examples
of gait parameters derived through processing the associated acceleration signal are
stride symmetry, speed, and stride time [30, 33, 34].
A subject of potential interest is the application of inertial sensor apparatus, such
as wireless accelerometer systems, for the health status of older people. Especially
these wearable applications may determine proactive need for therapy intervention
before the necessity to apply medically expensive and limited medical resources.
Gait analysis themed accelerometer systems recording the accelerometer signal
about the trunk have successfully assessed the inﬂuence of aging for healthy sub-
jects [33]. Quantiﬁed disparity has been identiﬁed with respect to gait for young and
elderly subjects with accelerometer systems mounted about the head and trunk
[34, 35].
With the wearable accelerometer system being advocated beyond the inherent
restriction of conventional gait analysis apparatus a relevant application would be
for the quantiﬁcation of human activity status [3–7, 10, 22, 23]. For example,
Aminian et al. [36] developed an accelerometer derived application referred to as
Physilog. The Physilog successfully quantiﬁed aspects of physical activity.
Apparatus employing triaxial accelerometer conﬁgurations have demonstrated the
ability to evaluate children regarding their level of physical activity [37].
Sophisticated systems that apply accelerometers, such as the Intelligent Device for
48
4
The Rise of Inertial Measurement Units

Energy Expenditure and Activity (IDEEA), have demonstrated the capacity to
ascertain physical activity status [38].
With the progressive evolution of accelerometer applications as wearable and
eventually wireless systems for quantiﬁcation of human movement, such as loco-
motion, a keystone to the validity of accelerometer systems for the biomedical and
health industry is the successful contrast to traditional gait evaluation systems [3–7,
10]. The research, development, testing, and evaluation of accelerometers has
advanced from uniaxial to biaxial to triaxial accelerometers, and these applications
have been successfully compared to equipment that is standard to the clinical gait
analysis laboratory [10, 39–41].
The most fundamental accelerometer is uniaxial capable of measuring one
dimension. Mayagoita et al. body mounted uniaxial accelerometers to an optical
motion capture system provided by Vicon. An array of uniaxial accelerometers
were mounted about the leg using aluminum strips to identify spatial orientation.
The data acquisition was temporally synchronized. A research objective was to
derive relevant kinematic parameters of gait, such as linear acceleration regarding
the knee, angular orientation of the shank, angular velocity of the shank, and its
corresponding angular acceleration [40].
The uniaxial body mounted accelerometers compared accurately for the acqui-
sition of quantiﬁed kinematic parameters of gait to the optical motion capture
system enabled through Vicon. In conclusion Maygoita advocated the body
mounted uniaxial accelerometer demonstrated similar ﬁndings relative to the
motion capture equipment from a quantiﬁed statistical perspective. At the time of
publication on the order of one and a half decades ago Maygoita et al. [40] envi-
sioned body mounted inertial sensor systems for the ability to quantify gait status in
effectively any domain of choice.
Moe-Nilssen and Helbostad further the relevance of data logger derived body
mounted inertial sensor devices for the quantiﬁcation of human motion. Their
research ascertained the trunk acceleration during gait as a quantiﬁed parameter for
differentiating between elderly groups considered to be ﬁt and frail. Intuitively these
two groups have perceptively disparate balance control strategies, which would
logically be revealed through an objectively quantiﬁed accelerometer signal.
A triaxial accelerometer was linked to a data logger for recording and subsequent
downloading of the acceleration signal, which was mounted about the lower aspect
of the back through a belt [41].
These research contributions by Mayagoitia et al. during 2002 and Moe-Nilssen
and Helbostad during 2005 further demonstrate the relevance of wearable body
mounted inertial sensors, such as the accelerometer, for acquiring gait related
activities. During this timeframe of inertial sensor and supporting microelectronic
technology and the accelerometer to data logger architecture presented a feasible
opportunity. A schematic perspective for the experimental methodology of the
wearable body mounted accelerometer supported by a data logger for storage is
presented in Fig. 4.1.
During the mid-2000s MiniSun a biomedical company located in Fresno,
California researched, developed, tested, and evaluated a wearable system amenable
4.3

for autonomous gait analysis referred to as the Intelligent Device for Energy
Expenditure and Activity (IDEEA). The device was comprised of a microprocessor
with a mass of 60 g and a storage capacity on the order of 200 MB with data
compression capability. IDEEA featured ﬁve biaxial accelerometers equipped with
a sampling rate of 32 Hz [39].
The signal data to from the accelerometer sensors is conveyed to the
microcomputer through ﬂexible cables. The microprocessor computationally
derives activity data based on the characteristics of the accelerometer signal data.
A standard serial communication port facilitates connectivity between the IDEAA
device and the primary data storage location [38].
The IDEEA accelerometer system pertains to the acquisition of inertial sensor
data for primary application about the lower extremities. The spatial temporal data
can be acquired for gait in both a clinical setting and more autonomous environment
[39]. The primary objective of the apparatus was to approximate energy expenditure
beyond the conﬁnes of a clinical laboratory [38, 42]. Saremi et al. [39] further
evolved the relevance of the IDEEA accelerometer system as a portable gait
analysis platform by contrast to an assortment of traditional gait analysis apparatus.

eter sensor using a data logger for temporary storage

The Rise of Inertial Measurement Units

Saremi et al. determined to apply the ﬁve biaxial accelerometer nodes at highly
precise anatomical mounting positions. The trunk mounted accelerometer was
applied 4 cm below the sternum top. Two accelerometer nodes were mounted about
the anterior aspect of the thigh midway relative to the knee and anterior superior
iliac spine with respect to both legs. Regarding each foot, the two remaining
accelerometer nodes were situated under the medial forefoot below the fourth
metatarsal head by 2 cm. The predetermined selection of these accelerometer node
mounting positions enabled the acquisition of the subject’s sagittal plane [39].
Saremi et al. contrasted the IDEAA device to three standard gait analysis sys-
tems, such as a footswitch, EMG, and reﬂective infrared markers using six cameras.
The EMG apparatus acquired signals from the tibialis anterior, medial gastrocne-
mius, biceps femoris, and vastus medialis. Also, a triaxial accelerometer was sit-
uated about the thigh as a comparative with respect to the biaxial accelerometer data
provided through the IDEAA device [39].
The comparison between the biaxial accelerometers of the MiniSun device
against the triaxial accelerometer positioned on the thigh revealed near-identical
waveforms. For both hemiparetic and healthy subjects, there was no signiﬁcant
statistical difference in the spatial temporal parameters of locomotion between the
MiniSun device and the footswitch device. The accelerometer system enabled by
the MiniSun characterized the temporal qualities of gait parameters that are rec-
ognizable to clinicians, such as EMG bursts and joint angle for the ankle, knee, and
hip, regarding healthy subjects [39].
The ﬁndings by Saremi et al. ascertain high test to retest reliability for the
IDEAA. Throughout the span of the experimental testing gait parameters did not
signiﬁcantly vary, such as single limb support, double limb support, swing time,
stance time, walking speed, cadence, and stride length. Based on the impact of the
ﬁndings reliable knowledge of leg derived acceleration signals could enable further
acuity for therapists with respect to patient rehabilitation [39].
The data logger represents a temporary medium for storage of the inertial signal,
such as the acceleration waveform. Data is physically transferred from the body
mounted sensor apparatus to a computer for subsequent post-processing. This
architecture enables both opportunities and presents drawbacks relative to more
modern techniques.
The wearable body mounted accelerometer system with data logger enables
multiple beneﬁts. Consider the contrast to an optical motion capture system tradi-
tionally reserved for a clinical gait laboratory. In general the optical motion capture
system is considerably expensive and requires advanced technical expertise for its
operation. The optical motion capture system is also reserved for indoor operation
as described in Chap. 3 “Quantiﬁcation systems appropriate for a clinical setting”.
Furthermore, the acquisition of kinematic gait data through an optical motion
capture system can be disrupted through obscuring line of sight between the camera
and subject. The inherent nature of the motion capture camera for gait analysis is
not portable. These observations restrict the application of an optical motion capture
camera to a specialized clinical gait analysis laboratory [7, 10, 43, 44].

4.4
Wireless Accelerometer Systems for Gait Analysis
By contrast the portable and wearable accelerometer system with a data logger can
be freely operated in an environment of the clinician’s and subject’s discretion.
Depending on the capacity of the data logger and predetermined sampling rate the
subject may provide gait data on the order of hours or even days. However, this
approach for acquiring an accelerometer signal for gait is becoming effectively
antiquated with the introduction of wireless capability for wearable inertial sensor
systems. Rather than undergoing the burden of physically transferring a trial data
package to computational resources for gait analysis post-processing, data can be
conveyed through wireless transmission to a remote post-processing resource [3–5,
7, 24].
Further progress with regards to portable accelerometer systems manifested
through the application of locally wireless connectivity to a local computer
resource. For example, Bluetooth wireless communication can enable seamless data
transmission between the wearable accelerometer system and local computer
available for further post-processing of the recorded data package. Figure 4.2
illustrates the schematic perspective for the experimental methodology of a wear-
able and wireless accelerometer application for gait analysis and wireless trans-
mission to a local computer resource for subsequent post-processing. Note the
contrary to Fig. 4.1; the wireless approach presented in Fig. 4.2 does not require the
encumbrance of manual data transfer. The wireless transfer may even be further
automated for user convenience.
Kavanagh et al. successfully researched, developed, tested, and evaluated a
novel wearable accelerometer system for gait analysis with local wireless connec-
tivity to a local computer. In order to achieve a representative three dimensional
accelerometer the research team supervised by Kavanagh orthogonally aligned two
accelerometer with two dimensional capability to represent an accelerometer node.
The wearable gait analysis device utilized four accelerometer nodes. The device
was comprised of a microprocessor and power regulation module powered by
batteries. Wireless transmission of the acquired data package was conveyed to a
locally situated computer through a Bluetooth Personal Area Network. The primary
objective of the research endeavor was to evaluate the stride to stride reliability and
reliability from the intra-examination and inter-examination perspective [45].
In order to successfully conduct such gait analysis research the accelerometer
nodes were situated at highly speciﬁc positions of the human anatomy, such as the
lower leg, trunk, neck, and head. The lower leg mounting position was applied
3 cm proximal relative to the lateral malleolus. The L3 spinous process was
selected for measuring spatial temporal parameters about the trunk. The
accelerometer recordings about the neck were measured through securing an
accelerometer node to the C7 spinous process. The occipital pole about the base of
the skull was applied for quantifying the accelerometer signal of the head during
locomotion [45].

The Rise of Inertial Measurement Units

The acceleration waveform was post-processed and assessed according to a
waveform similarity statistic referred to as the coefﬁcient of multiple determination
(CMD) in order to quantify reliability. With respect to individual stride to stride a
CMD of 0.86 was achieved. Intra-examiner application of the wireless and wear-
able accelerometer system attained a CMD of 0.87. With respect of inter-examiner
application of the device a CMD of 0.86 was demonstrated. Kavanagh et al. [45]
emphasizes the high CMD values, and further advocates this novel wireless and
wearable gait analysis system is associated with minimal error for accelerometer
mounting and reapplication with respect to the same or different examiners.
Lee et al. further evolves the potential for applying wireless accelerometer
systems for the domain of wearable gait analysis applications. The device was
represented as a compact integrated wireless accelerometer apparatus comprised of
a three dimensional accelerometer. Primary aspects of the wireless accelerometer
system were the accelerometer, power source, and module for wireless transmission
of the gait analysis data package to a local computer. The accelerometer signal was

sampled at a rate of 61 Hz. The wireless accelerometer system for gait analysis had
an integrated mass on order of 50 g [46].
The wearable and wireless accelerometer system developed by Lee et al. applied
a relatively more simpliﬁed mounting technique by contrast to strategies applied by
Saremi et al. and Kavanagh et al. The accelerometer aspect of the system was
applied about the ankle joint proximal to its lateral aspect. The selected mounting
position enabled the acquired acceleration signal of gait to be contrasted to a
conventional gait analysis apparatus, such as a footswitch. The ﬁndings of the study
reveal that the signals of the accelerometer and footswitch are relatively consistent
[46].
Another application in wireless and wearable devices applies a series of sensors
that are integrated into an actual shoe. Bamberg et al. [47] expand the scope of this
technology through a device they refer to as the GaitShoe. The advantage of the
GaitShoe is that it literally constitutes a wearable system with the foot as highly
deﬁned anatomical mounting location. Multiple sensors are applied to facilitate the
quantiﬁed and recorded measurement of gait. Inertial sensors, such as accelerom-
eters and gyroscopes are included in the GaitShoe. Other sensors applied are
pressure sensors, force sensors, bend sensors, and electric ﬁeld height sensors [47].
The above preliminary research endeavors applying wearable and wireless
systems for the domain of gait analysis emphasize the importance of selecting a
wireless accelerometer as foundational to the capability of conducting gait analysis.
Other wireless accelerometer systems are available for consideration. Three for
example during the mid to later 2000s were the Mednode developed by UCLA,
SparkFun
Electronics
wireless
3D
accelerometer,
and
G-Link
Wireless
Accelerometer Node [6, 10–22, 48–50].
The Mednode developed by the research laboratories of UCLA was considered
for application with respect to gait analysis. It consists of a three dimensional
accelerometer and features local wireless capability. Successful application of the
Mednode was demonstrated through the use of a wireless quantiﬁed reﬂex system
using an impact pendulum to elicit the patellar tendon reﬂex with reliable acqui-
sition of the reﬂex response through the accelerometer signal [15, 48]. A utility
regard the Mednode is that they are software programmable, which enables robust
application [50].
A drawback regarding the Mednode is the degree of specialization respective of
software programming. The Mednode is capable of wireless connectivity with a
local computer for storage of the transmitted data package. An issue is the strength
of the wireless signal, which is restricted according to power provided by the
wearable application. Another noted limitation regarding the Mednode is the ability
to synchronize tandem operated Mednodes. Because of these observations
regarding the Mednode other alternatives were further investigated [6, 10, 20, 21].
A wireless three dimensional accelerometer developed by SparkFun Electronics
was also considered for further research as a wireless gait analysis application. This
wireless accelerometer possessed attributes making it suitable for miniaturized
unmanned autonomous vehicles. The indoor wireless signal strength was on the
order of 30 m. However, a negative characteristic was the power source exceeded

threshold requirements for mass and packaging considerations as a wireless system.
Furthermore the wireless three dimensional accelerometer developed by SparkFun
Electronics specialization for programming, and tandem data synchronization were
issues of difﬁculty [6, 10, 20, 21].
LeMoyne and Mastroianni selected the G-Link Wireless Accelerometer Node
for a considerable array of research, development, testing, and evaluation regarding
the quantiﬁcation of gait, reﬂex response, and reﬂex latency. This wireless
accelerometer node was equipped with a software platform including a graphic user
interface that enabled it to be operational for the general user. The wireless signal
enabled transmission range on the order of 70 m with a mass of 46 grams. These
features enabled simpliﬁed mounting of the wireless accelerometer node with
minimal encumbrance to the subject, which enabled the application to function as a
wearable and wireless system for the quantiﬁcation of gait and reﬂex attributes
[6, 10–13, 16–22, 49]. The unique wireless accelerometer node facilitates the
genesis of Network Centric Therapy as presented in Chap. 5 ‘Portable wearable and
wireless systems for gait and reﬂex response quantiﬁcation’.

Conclusion
The evolutionary trends from disparate industries enabled the development of
inertial measurement units, such as the accelerometer. The accelerometer eventually
became sufﬁciently miniaturized to be applied as a wearable system for biomedical
and rehabilitation scenarios. The scenarios pertained to activity monitoring, suc-
cessful contrast to conventional gait analysis systems, and evaluation of hemiplegic
gait. As capabilities further progressed the need for tethering and manual transfer of
experimental data became obsolete with the advent of wireless accelerometer
systems. Wireless accelerometer systems facilitate gait analysis, for example, with
enhanced autonomy. As demonstrated in multiple future chapters the advent of
wireless accelerometer systems serves as a genesis for Network Centric Therapy by
enabling the possibility for a patient and therapist to be remotely situated with
rehabilitation status tracking quantiﬁed. The rehabilitation experience can be further
optimized through the development of an inertial sensor derived database for his-
torical trend analysis and optimization of the therapy process.

Portable Wearable and Wireless
Systems for Gait and Reﬂex Response
Quantiﬁcation
Abstract With the advent of wireless technology and inertial measurement units,
the prevalence of wireless accelerometers is addressed for quantiﬁcation of gait,
reﬂex response, and reﬂex latency. Over the course of four generations of research,
development, testing, and evaluation the ability to quantify patellar tendon reﬂex
response and latency has been achieved in an accurate, reliable, and reproducible
manner. As a transitional phase to the research, development, testing, and evalu-
ation cycle an artiﬁcial reﬂex device was also applied. The central themes to the
wireless quantiﬁed reﬂex device are tandem operated wireless accelerometer nodes
that are effectively wearable for deriving response and latency and a potential
energy impact pendulum for evoking the patellar tendon reﬂex. The successful
application of these wireless accelerometers that are wearable has been further
extended toward the quantiﬁcation of hemiplegic gait, and real-time modiﬁcation of
hemiplegic gait through the quantiﬁed feedback of Virtual Proprioception. Other
developments regarding the use of wireless accelerometers that are wearable are
further addressed.

Introduction
During the era of the mid to later 2000s the advancement of wireless accelerometer
systems attained sufﬁcient miniaturization to serve also as wearable applications. In
particular LeMoyne et al. pursued the role of wireless accelerometers for the
domain of reﬂex quantiﬁcation and gait analysis. This level of wireless
accelerometer capability was localized in nature for access to a proximally situated
laptop computer [1–3]. Although relative to the current state technology for
wearable and wireless systems far transcend the applications addressed in the
current chapter, they serve as a keystone to the pending developments and
methodologies.

During 2005 LeMoyne et al. sought to quantify patellar tendon reﬂex response
data in a objectively and eventually reliable manner through the evolution of a
wireless reﬂex quantiﬁcation device. The inherent fundamentals of the wireless
reﬂex quantiﬁcation device are the capability to evoke the patellar tendon reﬂex
through a preselected level of potential energy that can be precisely targeted to an
aspect of the patellar tendon. The other fundamental concept was to measure the
reﬂex response through the objective quantiﬁcation of a wireless accelerometer
system that is essentially wearable about the lateral malleolus of the ankle through
an elastic band. These fundamentals attributes served as the basis for the evolution
of the wireless quantiﬁed reﬂex device over the course of four generations [3, 4].
5.2
First Generation Wireless Reﬂex Quantiﬁcation
Device
The preliminary ﬁrst generation of the wireless reﬂex quantiﬁcation device pro-
vided initial proof of concept of the application. The patellar tendon reﬂex was
evoked by a wooden potential energy impact pendulum mounted with a reﬂex
hammer. A wearable and wireless accelerometer inspired by a research laboratory
from UCLA known as the Mednode measured the response of the patellar tendon
reﬂex. The preliminary demonstration the ﬁrst generation of the wireless reﬂex
quantiﬁcation device involved the quantiﬁcation of a hemiplegic reﬂex pair. The
device demonstrated the capability to quantify the notable disparity of the affected
leg reﬂex response compared to the unaffected leg reﬂex response [5].
5.3
Second Generation Wireless Reﬂex Quantiﬁcation
Device
The second generation wireless reﬂex quantiﬁcation device also applied the
Mednode as a wearable and wireless reﬂex accelerometer for objective measuring
of the reﬂex response. An improvement to the concept was through the potential
energy impact pendulum conﬁguration. A sturdy aluminum stand equipped with a
mast that projected to a hinged potential energy impact pendulum attached to a
reﬂex hammer was developed. The capability facilitated the ability to precisely
target a consistent aspect of the patellar tendon with a prescribed amount of
potential energy, such as 30 degrees relative to gravity vector [6].
The second generation wireless quantiﬁed reﬂex device successfully demon-
strated the ability to quantify the patellar tendon reﬂex response in an accurate and
consistent manner. Because of the advances regarding the potential energy impact
pendulum, the second generation system demonstrated the directly proportional
nature of the relationship between the evoking potential energy and the acceleration
magnitude of the reﬂex response [6].

Portable Wearable and Wireless Systems for Gait and Reﬂex …

During the transitional phase between the second to third generation of the
wireless quantiﬁed reﬂex device a priority was placed on improving the wireless
accelerometer system. Although the Mednode demonstrated the ability to measure
the patellar tendon reﬂex response in an objectively accurate and consistent manner,
its operation requires a potentially preclusive level of technical expertise. Also,
during testing and evaluation the wireless signal strength was a topic of concern.
Further investigation found the G-Link wireless accelerometer node as suitable for
the third generation evolution with more appropriate wireless capability and ease of
operation [3, 4].
5.4
Third Generation Wireless Quantiﬁed Reﬂex Device
The third generation wireless quantiﬁed reﬂex device featured the amalgamation of
both the potential energy impact pendulum for precisely targeted strike and pre-
scribed potential energy levels to evoke the patellar tendon reﬂex and a wearable
and wireless accelerometer node. The wireless accelerometer node was mounted as
a wearable application about the lateral malleolus proximal to the ankle joint. This
technique enabled the acquisition of the reﬂex response. The recorded accelerom-
eter signal was post-processed to derive the three dimensional vector acceleration
magnitude [7].
The use of a tandem operated wireless accelerometer was applied to the potential
energy impact pendulum to obtain the temporal nature of the reﬂex hammer strike
eliciting the patellar tendon reﬂex response. The subsequent temporal offset based
on the ankle mounted wireless accelerometer for the imminent reﬂex response
signiﬁes a functional patellar tendon reﬂex latency. The application involved a
real-time stream of the accelerometer signal data by wireless transmission to a local
portable laptop computer, which constrained the sampling rate to on the order of
100 Hz [7].
The third generation wireless quantiﬁed reﬂex device demonstrated the capacity
to accurately and acquire parameters that characterize the patellar tendon reﬂex
response, such as maximum response, minimum response, and latency [7]. In order
to better characterize the reﬂex latency an ampliﬁed sampling rate would be desir-
able. Further testing and evaluation of the wireless quantiﬁed reﬂex device pertained
to utilizing the data logger features of the wireless accelerometer node [3, 4].
Rather than real-time streaming of the wireless data to a local computer, a series
of trial samples would be stored through the wireless accelerometer node’s data
logger. Following the completion of the experiment the data package of both the
wireless accelerometer mounted to about the lateral malleolus and potential energy
impact pendulum would be wirelessly conveyed to a local laptop computer for
post-processing. Prior to the research, development, test, and evaluation of the
fourth generation wireless quantiﬁed reﬂex device. An artiﬁcial reﬂex system was
applied to the testing and evaluation of the progressively evolving wireless quan-
tiﬁed reﬂex device [3, 4].

5.5
Artiﬁcial Reﬂex System
The advantage of applying an artiﬁcial reﬂex system to the test and evaluation
process of the wireless quantiﬁed reﬂex device is the inherent lack of neurological
variability. The artiﬁcial reﬂex system in essentially a mechanical device with
minimal variability. The artiﬁcial reﬂex response is derived from the potential
energy of an elastic band, and the latency is derived from a cam that is connected to
the trigger switch. The associated apparatus for the artiﬁcial reﬂex system, such as
wireless accelerometer nodes, local laptop computer, and potential energy impact
pendulum, is presented in Fig. 5.1 [8, 9].
The key feature of the artiﬁcial reﬂex system testing and evaluation was the
considerable sampling rate that the wireless accelerometers using the data logger
mode were capable of attaining. The experiment applied a sampling rate of
2048 Hz for both tandem activated accelerometers (one applied to the artiﬁcial
reﬂex system and the another applied to the potential energy impact pendulum).
This conﬁguration enabled the maximal acuity for acquiring latency derived from
the artiﬁcial reﬂex system on the order of milliseconds [8, 9].
The artiﬁcial reﬂex system demonstrated the considerable relevance and validity
of the wireless quantiﬁed reﬂex device. The testing and evaluation of the artiﬁcial
reﬂex system using the wireless quantiﬁed reﬂex device acquired artiﬁcial reﬂex

response and artiﬁcial reﬂex latency parameters with considerable accuracy and
consistency [8, 9].
5.6
Wireless Accelerometer Reﬂex Quantiﬁcation System
Characterizing Response and Latency
Another intermediary step between the third and fourth generation wireless quan-
tiﬁed reﬂex device applied the successful concepts of the artiﬁcial reﬂex system to
the acquisition for the patellar tendon reﬂex response and latency. The tandem
activated wireless accelerometers were mounted at the lateral malleolus of the ankle
joint and potential energy impact pendulum while sampling at 2048 Hz. This
conﬁguration provided considerable temporal acuity for the determination of reﬂex
latency. The patellar tendon reﬂex response and latency were acquired through this
conﬁguration with considerable accuracy and consistency [10].
An important discovery regarding the wireless accelerometer data logger mode
was that download time to wirelessly transmit the data package. Essentially the
sampling rate is directly proportional to the wireless data transfer time, and the
sampling rate is inversely proportional to the number of trials that can be stored in
the wireless accelerometer data logger. Therefore the proper sampling rate should
be determined in consideration of the number of trials to be acquired and the desired
acuity of the derived reﬂex latency [3, 4].
5.7
Fourth Generation Wireless Quantiﬁed Reﬂex Device
The fourth generation wireless quantiﬁed reﬂex device applied a longitudinal study
of multiple subjects. Evolving the wireless quantiﬁed reﬂex device based on pre-
vious endeavors, a sampling rate of 512 Hz was applied to the wireless
accelerometer mounted to the lateral malleolus about the ankle joint and tandem
activated wireless accelerometer secured to the potential energy impact pendulum
[11].
The fourth generation wireless quantiﬁed reﬂex device is featured in Figs. 5.2
and 5.3. The advantage of the 512 Hz sampling rate was that it enabled sufﬁcient
temporal acuity for deﬁning the latency of the patellar tendon reﬂex. Also, the
512 Hz sampling rate permitted a sufﬁcient number of trial samples to be acquired
without the need for an intermediary wireless download to the local laptop com-
puter [11].
The fourth generation wireless quantiﬁed reﬂex device applied a multi-subject
longitudinal study. The precise targeting and prescribed level of potential energy
facilitated the consistency of the experiment. Upon recording a considerable
amount of experimental data, a software automation program was applied to

enhance the timeliness of the post-processing routine. From the acceleration signal
the acceleration magnitude was determined, and the maximum reﬂex response and
associated reﬂex latency were derived. Both descriptive and inferential statistics
determined the accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility of the acquisition of patella
tendon reﬂex response and latency with respect to the context of the multi-subject
longitudinal study [11].
The ﬁndings of the evolutionary generations of the wireless quantiﬁed reﬂex
device provide useful perspective and insight as to the prevalence of Network
Centric Therapy. A medical setting, such as a clinical facility, could be equipped
with the wireless quantiﬁed reﬂex device. The quantiﬁed reﬂex response and
latency data could be acquired and transmitted wireless to a localized computer for
post-processing and data storage. The accurate, reliable, and reproducible trial data
of the reﬂex response and latency could be applied for prognostic and proactive
diagnosis of neurological disorders based on the establishment of a robust patient
database, far before the onset of traditionally identiﬁable symptoms.
From a neurological perspective the quality of gait and reﬂex modulation are
inter-correlated [1–4]. In a similar theme the same wireless accelerometer nodes
applied for the quantiﬁcation of reﬂex response and latency can also be applied to
the quantiﬁed evaluation of gait analysis. In proximity to the timeframe that the
wireless quantiﬁed reﬂex device was being tested and evaluated, the same effec-
tively wearable and wireless accelerometer node was being applied to accurately
and consistently measure the quantiﬁed attributes of gait.
5.8
Gait Analysis Using Wearable and Wireless
Accelerometer Nodes
From the research, development, testing, and evaluation origins of wireless
accelerometers for the quantiﬁcation of gait attributes, it was noted that the wireless
accelerometer nodes were effectively wearable devices. They could be readily
mounted to easily identiﬁable anatomical positions, such as the lateral epicondyle
proximal to the knee joint and the lateral malleolus proximal to the ankle joint. With
the local wireless capabilities using either the real-time streaming or data logger
capability the experimental setting was considerably more autonomous than a
restricted clinical setting. Furthermore the gait analysis scenario could be either
applied indoors or outdoors at the subject’s discretion [1, 12, 13].
Preliminary testing and evaluation sought to identify quantiﬁed disparity with
respect the hemiplegic gait. Intuitively the movement characteristics of the hemi-
plegic affected leg are visually disparate relative to the unaffected leg. However,
quantiﬁed evaluation of the hemiplegic leg pair (affected contrasted to unaffected)
could provide a basis for reﬁnements in rehabilitation therapy [1, 12, 13].
Tandem activated and synchronized wireless accelerometers achieved the
objective of identifying quantiﬁed disparity for hemiplegic gait. The wireless

accelerometers were mounted either to the lateral epicondyle proximal to the knee
joint or the lateral malleolus proximal the ankle joint while being secured by an
elastic band, as illustrated in Fig. 5.4. Both kinematic and temporal aspects of the
gait cycle were identiﬁed [12, 13].
The ﬁrst aspect of the post-processing was to consolidate the three acceleration
vectors into an acceleration magnitude according the three dimensional represen-
tation of the Pythagorean’s Theorem. Stance initiation was noted at each charac-
teristic and rhythmic spike in the proﬁle acceleration of the acceleration magnitude.
From this observation the stance to stance temporal disparity would be calculated as
the temporal parameter. The kinematic parameter would be based on the time
averaged acceleration waveform from stance to stance using an integration tech-
nique, such as the trapezoid method. With this approach disparity in hemiplegic gait
was identiﬁed through a quantiﬁed context, such as in particular regarding the time
averaged acceleration waveform from stance to stance [1, 12, 13].
Further testing and evaluation of the wireless accelerometer as a wearable and
wireless system for gait analysis pertained to the consideration of the frequency
domain. Hemiplegic gait involves a hemiplegic affected leg and unaffected leg that
are notably disparate in the spatial temporal domain. However, the frequency
domain may elucidate unique gait disparities that are not readily identiﬁable during
observation. Tandem activated wireless accelerometers were mounted proximal to

the lateral malleolus of both the hemiplegic affected leg and unaffected leg. Upon
the subject reaching steady state the wireless accelerometers were activated, which
mitigated the presences of starting and stopping effects of the gait cycle [14].
Predominant frequencies were identiﬁed during post-processing with a consid-
erable degree of accuracy and reliability. The organization of the predominant
frequencies respective of the hemiplegic affected leg and unaffected leg were
determined to be disparate in a statistically signiﬁcant context. This discovery
implies disparity regarding the rhythmicity of the hemiplegic affected leg compared
to the unaffected leg. Such preliminary ﬁndings may advance gait rehabilitation
therapy techniques [14].
5.9
Virtual Proprioception
As an extension of the capability to objectively quantify gait through the application
of wearable and wireless accelerometers, they can be applied to provide real-time
feedback for the modiﬁcation of gait strategy. In particular this concept is useful for
people with hemiplegic gait, because the proprioception of their hemiplegic affected
leg is disparate relative to their unaffected leg. The application of using wearable
and wireless accelerometers to provide real-time feedback for the modiﬁcation of
hemiplegic gait is know as Virtual Proprioception [1, 15–18].
Virtual Proprioception applies tandem mounted wireless accelerometers that are
mounted about the lateral epicondyle of the femur proximal to the knee joint. While
the subject is walking the disparity of the wireless accelerometers provided quan-
tiﬁed feedback as to the disparity of the hemiplegic affected leg compared to the
unaffected leg. With this feedback provided while walking the subject can modify
gait strategy in real-time for the objective of the acceleration waveform of the
hemiplegic leg achieving a sufﬁcient level of similarity to the acceleration wave-
form of the unaffected leg. Virtual Proprioception has been successfully demon-
strated using visual and audio feedback to inform the subject of the disparity of the
hemiplegic leg compared to the unaffected leg and the progressive modiﬁcation of
gait strategy to achieve convergence to a sufﬁcient level of parity [1, 15, 16].
The ﬁrst version of Virtual Proprioception applied visual feedback as the means
for modifying gait to achieve convergence to parity of the hemiplegic affected leg
and unaffected leg. The tandem activated wireless accelerometers were mounted to
the lateral epicondyle of the femur proximal to the knee joint through an elastic
band. The subject was instructed to walk while both wireless accelerometers were
tandem activated and streaming their effective acceleration waveforms in real-time
to the monitor of a portable computer. The subject was tasked with modifying gait
with an emphasis toward modifying the acceleration waveform of the hemiplegic
affected leg to best approximate the acceleration waveform of the unaffected leg.
The subject was able to modify gait strategy with the hemiplegic affected leg
acceleration waveform reaching convergence to parity of the unaffected leg.
Post-processing demonstrated the stance to stance time averaged acceleration ratio
5.8
Gait Analysis Using Wearable and Wireless Accelerometer Nodes
67

of the hemiplegic affected leg per the unaffected leg converged toward parity (a
ratio approaching one) relative to walking without Virtual Proprioception [1, 15].
The most optimal feedback modality may not be consistently visual in nature for
all people with hemiplegic gait. There is motivation to consider alternative feedback
modalities that may be effective for other subjects. For this reason an auditory
feedback form of Virtual Proprioception was a subject of further research, devel-
opment, testing, and evaluation.
The second version of Virtual Proprioception utilized auditory feedback to
inform the use of the ratio contrasting the stance to stance time averaged acceler-
ation of the hemiplegic affected leg relative to the unaffected leg. In order to achieve
this objective real-time processing of the acceleration waveform during gait was
necessary. Each initiation of stance was detected through the magnitude of the
acceleration waveform exceeding a prescribed threshold [1, 16].
The temporal bounds from a stance event to the following stance event were
deﬁned. The magnitude of the acceleration waveform through the application of the
Pythagorean theorem would then be determined. The next step would involve
applied Riemann summing to obtain the integral to deﬁne the time averaged
acceleration from stance to stance. With this information calculated the ratio of
stance to stance time averaged acceleration for the hemiplegic affected leg to
unaffected leg would be determined. This software was consolidated into a program
that would be amenable to a real-time wearable and wireless computing scenario [1,
16].
The subject would secure a pair of tandem operated wireless accelerometers
mounted by an elastic band to the lateral epicondyle of the femur proximal to the
knee joint. An operator of a locally positioned laptop would then provide the
subject with verbal instructions regarding the status of the ratio of stance to stance
time averaged acceleration for the hemiplegic affected leg to unaffected leg. First
the subject would walk without auditory feedback through Virtual Proprioception,
and then the subject would receive auditory feedback regarding the ratio status, for
which the subject could modify the hemiplegic affected leg gait strategy. From a
quantiﬁed perspective the application of Virtual Proprioception demonstrated the
capacity to achieve a ratio approaching parity of both the affected hemiplegic leg
relative to the unaffected leg, especially when compared to the notable disparity

Further Applications of Wearable and Wireless
Inertial Sensor Systems for Gait Quantiﬁcation
Further endeavors regarding the application of wearable and wireless inertial sen-
sors systems have led to the monitoring of the subject’s condition. Activity status
has been classiﬁed through the application of a wireless body sensor network that

utilized multiple biaxial accelerometers [19]. Indoor monitoring of elderly people
has been demonstrated through the use of a wireless accelerometer package as an
intrinsic feature [20]. A multi-sensor wireless application consisting of the
accelerometer was developed for estimating clinically relevant gait parameters, such
as joint angle and stride length [21]. Relative to traditional gait analysis techniques
a wireless inertial sensing device was partially successful for the estimation of
spatial temporal parameters [22]. A wireless system incorporating accelerometers
determined the status of toe clearance [23].
Wearable and wireless inertial sensor systems have been successfully applied for
the further quantiﬁcation of hemiplegic gait. A multi-node wearable and wireless
inertial sensor system was positioned about aspects of the lower limb for the
objective of distinguishing between subjects with hemiplegic gait and healthy gait
[24]. Through the application of an accelerometer system mounted about the trunk,
disparity of the acceleration signal was determined for hemiplegic and healthy gait
[25]. Temporal parameters of hemiplegic gait were successfully measured using
wireless accelerometers that locally conveyed data through Bluetooth to a waist
mounted PDA, which would then transmit the data to a personal computer for
post-processing and storage [26].
5.11
Conclusion
The role of wireless accelerometers for the quantiﬁcation of gait, reﬂex response,
and reﬂex latency has been discussed. The successful acquisition of patellar tendon
reﬂex response and associated latency has been measured and quantiﬁed in an
accurate, reliable, and reproducible manner through the application of a wireless
quantiﬁed reﬂex device. The wireless quantiﬁed reﬂex device applies a potential
energy impact pendulum and tandem operated wireless accelerometers that are
essentially wearable. This conﬁguration has been progressively evolved over the
course of four generational evolutions. Further success using the wireless
accelerometer node as a wearable gait evaluation system has been demonstrated for
the identiﬁcation of quantiﬁed disparity of hemiplegic gait. The wearable and
wireless accelerometers have been applied as a quantiﬁed feedback modality for
modifying hemiplegic gait strategy known as Virtual Proprioception. These
developments identify the growing potential of Network Centric Therapy as
wearable and wireless systems can readily quantify gait and reﬂex with minimal
resources. Regarding gait analysis and quantiﬁcation the subject can select a
familiar indoor or outdoor setting based on familiarity rather than a scheduled
clinical gait laboratory appointment. The quantiﬁed nature of the wearable and
wireless accelerometers further facilitates the acuity for proactive therapy inter-
vention for optimized rehabilitation.

Quantiﬁcation
Abstract The smartphone and portable media device are equipped with inertial
sensors, such as an accelerometer and gyroscope. With the proper software appli-
cation they can function as wireless accelerometer and gyroscope platforms. This
capability enables the smartphone and portable media device to function as wear-
able and wireless systems for gait and reﬂex response. The experimental trial data
can be conveyed through wireless connectivity to the Internet as an email attach-
ment for post-processing. The signal data can be further consolidated into a feature
set for machine learning classiﬁcation. Many experimental scenarios pertaining to
quantifying the domains of gait and reﬂex response are presented. The smartphone

Introduction
An intrinsic aspect of the smartphone is its inertial sensor package, which includes
both an accelerometer and gyroscope. With a robust software application the
accelerometer signal for example can be recorded as a data package. The collected
signal data can then be transmitted wirelessly as a email attachment through Internet
connectivity. The experimental data can be stored at an email resource for pending
post-processing and analysis. Given the inherent nature of the Internet and wireless
connectivity, the experimental site and post-processing resource location can be
situated literally anywhere in the world [1–4].

The smartphone and portable media device also can share similar software
applications, such as between an iPhone and iPod. This capability enables the
portable media device to resemble the characteristics of the smartphone as a
wearable and wireless accelerometer and gyroscope platform. The selection of
either the smartphone or portable media device for experimentation is contextual to
the environment and scenario under consideration [1–4].
The smartphone involves a considerable telecommunication footprint, so it can
be applied to a considerable assortment of autonomous scenarios, especially out-
doors. However, a trade consideration is the smartphone generally requires a
periodic payment schedule to sustain the telecommunication package, therefore it
maybe in some cases limiting in terms of cost. By contrast the portable media
device has the advantage of a singular ﬁxed cost structure. In light of the need for
local wireless Internet connectivity to convey the acquired data package, this device
is generally restricted to a bounded setting, such as a homebound environment or
other location bounded by a local wireless Internet zone [1–4].
Both the smartphone and portable media device are inherently capable of sep-
arating experimental and post-processing resources that certainly enables the pre-
liminary assessment of Network Centric Therapy capability and potential.
A therapist could assign a patient with a prescribed therapy regiment while being
remotely situated from each other.
As demonstrated in the current chapter a subject’s gait characteristics can be
readily identiﬁed through a smartphone or a portable media device functioning as a
wearable and wireless accelerometer or gyroscope platform. Encompassing asso-
ciated features of gait the patellar tendon reﬂex response can be acquired from any
location of choice for pending remote post-processing [1–4].
Smartphones and portable media devices functioning as wearable and wireless
systems for gait and reﬂex response quantiﬁcation demonstrate preliminary
opportunities for Network Centric Therapy. With remote relationships feasible
between therapist and patient, the logistical complexities of structured appointments
are alleviated. Furthermore a team of therapists can be matched based on their
expert skills rather than their happenstance of locational proximity to the patient.
Also, the therapy team can be composed of experts remotely situated from each
other, further optimizing the rehabilitation experience.
Progressive evolutionary trends advancing the opportunities for wearable and
wireless systems resulted in the development of robust platforms for the quantiﬁ-
cation of the human movement quality, such as gait [5–7]. The reﬂex response, such
as through the patellar tendon, is also a highly correlated neuro-motor feature
respective of gait that can be quantiﬁed through wearable and wireless platforms
[7–9]. Two highly available devices that satisfy the capabilities for robust wearable
and wireless inertial sensor platforms for quantifying gait and reﬂex response are
the smartphone and portable media device [1–4].

Smartphone Quantifying Gait as a Wireless
Accelerometer Platform
During 2010 LeMoyne and Mastroianni sought to evolve their research capabilities
beyond the domain of locally wireless systems, such as those presented in Chap. 5
“Portable wearable and wireless systems for gait and reﬂex response quantiﬁca-
tion”. The applications presented in Chap. 5 are restricted to a relatively local
wireless capability. Also, the wireless transfer of data from accelerometer node to a
personal computer and upload to post-processing resources requires an extra layer
of complexity with an associated degree of technical sophistication that may exceed
the information technology expertise of a person in need of rehabilitation.
A device that could be simply operated by the patient user with simple con-
veyance of the experimental data transmitted in a robust manner to post-processing
resources available to a remotely situated therapist would be ideal. Furthermore
such a device would be readily operated in a user friendly manner. During
approximately 2010 LeMoyne and Mastroianni sought to research, develop, test,
and evaluate a software application that enabled the smartphone, such as an iPhone,
to function as a wearable and wireless accelerometer platform. The smartphone was
equipped with a software application that could record a temporally deﬁned
accelerometer signal with a countdown prior to the commencement of the record-
ing. The acquired data package would be conveyed by wireless transmission to the
Internet as an email attachment for post-processing remote to the experimental
location [1–4].
Preliminary success was demonstrated for the smartphone as a wireless
accelerometer platform as a mechanism for gait quantiﬁcation. During 2010
LeMoyne et al. were the ﬁrst ever to have introduced the operation of a smartphone
as a wireless accelerometer platform for gait analysis. The inherently portable
nature of the smartphone permitted the device to be secured by an elastic band
proximal to an easily identiﬁable anatomical mounting position, such as the lateral
malleolus about the ankle, the lateral epicondyle near the knee joint, and the lumbar
aspect of the spine near about a subject’s belt [10–12].
The operation of the smartphone as a wearable and wireless accelerometer
platform was considerably facilitated through the enabling smartphone application.
Before commencing the experiment parameters, such as countdown duration,
recording duration, and sampling rate, were predetermined. Upon mounting the
device, the person conducting the experiment would activate the application. With
the temporal countdown a subject could achieve a steady state velocity, thereby
mitigating transient effects. Recording initiation and termination were indicated by
an audio tone. With the completion of the experimental trial the data package could
be emailed through wireless connectivity to the Internet [1–4, 10–12].
The most obvious utility of the application of a smartphone as a wearable and
wireless accelerometer platform for the quantiﬁcation of gait analysis was the shear
commercial nature of the application. A ubiquitous communication device could
provide meaningful insight as to the status of one’s gait, especially from a familiar

homebound setting. Logistical and pragmatic implications are lucid. Rather than
orchestrating a medical appointment that evidences a brief snapshot of a person’s
gait status, a person could remotely and conveniently provide a series of gait trial
samples for subsequent analysis [1–4, 10–12]. A representative illustration of the
smartphone mounted about the lateral malleolus near the ankle joint for gait
analysis is provided in Fig. 6.1. Figure 6.2 provides a schematic perspective of the
process for applying the smartphone for the acquisition of gait data in a homebound
setting or any location of choice. Figure 6.3 illustrates a representative acceleration
waveform of gait.
Another insight regarding the application of the smartphone as a wearable and
wireless accelerometer platform for gait analysis is the use of email. An experi-
mental trial package could be emailed by the experimenter to the respective
post-processing resources. During preliminary test and evaluation the experimental
and post-processing capabilities were situated on the order of trans-continental
displacement with respect to the United States of America [1–4, 10–12]. Later
endeavors of similar themed proof of concept endeavors literally situated resources
on disparate sides of the world [13]. In essence the storage of the trial data on an
email account is representative of a functional cloud based system.

Post-processing and Numerical Analysis
for the Acquired Acceleration Waveform for Gait
Preliminary numeral analysis relied on published techniques, such as the temporal
disparity and time averaged acceleration of the acceleration waveform. Initially the
three-dimensional vector sum was acquired to determine the acceleration magnitude
for an experimental gait trial. One characteristic feature of the resultant acceleration
waveform is the characteristic spike that occurs in proximity to stance initiation.
A series of stance initiation events could infer the temporal disparity between stance
initiations for a gait cycle. Further analysis would apply the time averaging of the
acceleration waveform, which would be achieved by integrating the acceleration
magnitude waveform through a trapezoid method divided by the temporal disparity
[10–12, 14–17]. Another feature of the numerical analysis of the acceleration
waveform of gait was the frequency domain derived Fast-Fourier Transformation
[11, 12, 18].

Portable Media Device for Quantifying Gait
as a Wireless Accelerometer Platform
Subsequent to the successful application of the smartphone as a wearable and
wireless accelerometer platform for gait quantiﬁcation and analysis, LeMoyne et al.
considered the portable media device during 2011. The primary advantage of the
portable media device as a gait quantiﬁcation and analysis platform is the device is
readily operational without an expensive cell phone plan as a marginal cost. The
portable media device, such as an iPod, only has a ﬁxed cost of purchase. The only
constraint is the requirement for a local wireless Internet zone, which can be readily
available in most scenarios [1–4, 19].
The software application also can be identical, especially in the case regarding
the operation of an iPhone as a smartphone and iPod as a portable media device.
Therefore the essential experimental protocol comprised assigning a temporal
countdown and recording window. The portable media device was applied about
the lateral malleolus of the ankle through an elastic band. The experimental trial
package was also conveyed trans-continentally regarding the United States of
America for subsequent post-processing [10–12, 19].
As an extension to the research, development, testing, and evaluation of the
portable media device as a robust system for quantifying gait characteristics, the
perceptible disparity of hemiplegic gait was quantiﬁed in a statistically signiﬁcant
manner. Intuitively two available portable media devices are in general more

economical than two smartphones, in consideration of ﬁxed and marginal cost. Two
portable media devices functioning as wireless accelerometer platforms were
mounted as wearable systems about the lateral malleolus of the ankle joint through
the elastic band of a sock for the affected and unaffected leg with both activated in
close proximity. Standard parameters for wearable and wireless accelerometer
platforms for gait analysis, such as the temporal disparity and stance to stance time
averaged acceleration, quantiﬁed statistically signiﬁcant disparity regarding the
contrast of the hemiplegic affected leg and unaffected leg [20].
6.5
Smartphone Wireless Accelerometer Platform
for Quantiﬁcation of Prosthetic Gait
Another consideration is the quantiﬁcation of gait for a person with a prosthesis.
The acquired acceleration waveform may enable insight for the quality of reha-
bilitation, need for therapy intervention, prosthetic upgrade, or overall quality of
life. The smartphone was selected for this endeavor because of the more robust
telecommunications footprint, such as further consideration for an outdoors envi-
ronment. Contrary to the standard body mounting through an elastic band, a more
appropriate mounting technique was necessary. The 3D printed adapter prior to
mounting is presented in Fig. 6.4. A 3D printed adapter secured the smartphone to
the Energy Storage and Return (ESAR) transtibial prosthesis as illustrated in
Fig. 6.5 [21].

In light of the quantity of experimental data obtained during the endeavor, an
automated software process for the rapid and precise acquisition was sought for
improving the post-processing aspect. More sophisticated software automation
facilitated the derivation of quantiﬁed parameters. Using MATLAB the data was
processed in a highly organized and automated manner, considerably reducing the
time for post-processing. The algorithm ﬁrst determined the temporal location of
the acceleration peaks representing stance initiation. Next the temporal disparity
from stance to stance was determined. With this data vectorized the time averaged
acceleration from stance initiation to stance initiation was computed [21].

Smartphone Wireless Gyroscope Platform

The inertial sensor of the smartphone and portable media sensor include a gyro-
scope, which can reveal clearly understandable signals of the scenario being con-
sidered. With the proper software application the smartphone functions as a
wireless gyroscope platform. The acquired data sample can be readily conveyed
through wireless connectivity to the Internet as an email attachment for remote
post-processing. A particular research topic of interest is the quantiﬁcation and
subsequent machine learning classiﬁcation of reduced arm swing [22].

Reduced arm swing represents another quantiﬁable characteristic of hemiplegic
gait. With regards to this aspect of hemiplegic gait, the gyroscope in particular
constitutes a highly relevant signal to measure the degree of reduced arm swing
while walking. A conventional smartphone armband can be readily applied to
secure the device to the distal aspect of the radius and ulna about the wrist joint as
illustrated in Fig. 6.6. The smartphone also enables the subject to provide a series of
experimental trials in a preferred outdoors environment. The collected data would
be wirelessly transmitted through the Internet as comma-separated-value ﬁles
attached to a series of emails [22].
With the recording of the experimental trials available to a secure email account
for post-processing a software automation ﬁle would be applied to reduce the data
to a machine learning feature set. The attributes of the feature set were:
• Mean of the gyroscope signal
• Maximum of the gyroscope signal
• Minimum of the gyroscope signal
• Standard Deviation of the gyroscope signal
Rather than utilizing the convention approach of inferential statistics to identify
statistical signiﬁcance, machine learning was applied to distinguish disparate
classes of a feature set. The multilayer perceptron neural network was selected as
the desired algorithm, since it resembles the neuron, a building block for neuro-
logical perceptivity. The multilayer perceptron neural network successfully differ-
entiated between an affected arm and unaffected arm with regards to a feature set

derived multilayer perceptron neural network is presented in Fig. 6.7, and it is
composed of four input layers, three hidden layers, and two output layers [22].

Portable Media Device Functioning as a Wireless
Gyroscope Platform for Quantiﬁcation of Reduced
Arm Swing for Erb’s Palsy
The portable media device has also been successfully applied as a wireless gyro-
scope platform to establish a feature set for machine learning classiﬁcation of other
types of reduced arm swing, such as for Erb’s Palsy. Successful application in this
context required proximity to a local wireless Internet zone with transmission of the
data packages as emails through access to the Internet. Figures 6.8 and 6.9
demonstrate the respective affected and unaffected gyroscope waveforms during
gait. Note the disparity of gyroscope signals respective of Figs. 6.8 and 6.9.
Following automated post-processing, a machine learning algorithm successfully
classiﬁed between the Erb’s Palsy affected arm and unaffected arm in the context of
reduced arm swing during gait [23].

Quantiﬁcation of Patellar Tendon Reﬂex Response
Through Portable Media Device and Smartphone
as a Wireless Accelerometer Platform
The patellar tendon reﬂex is a highly related neurological-motor aspect correlated to
gait. Synchronous and ﬂuid modulation of the tendon reﬂex is intrinsic to smooth
regulation of gait [8, 9]. Also, the application of the patellar tendon reﬂex represents
highly utilitarian insight regarding the general neurological status of a subject.
Observable dysfunction of the tendon reﬂex may establish a basis for the pro-
gressive escalation of medical resources. Logically the quantiﬁcation of the patellar
reﬂex through wireless accelerometer and gyroscope platforms provided by
smartphones and portable media devices can greatly facilitate the biomedical
community [1–3].
During 2012 LeMoyne et al. applied a portable media device as a wireless
accelerometer platform with connectivity to a local wireless Internet zone. In order to
consistently evoke the patellar tendon reﬂex a potential energy impact pendulum was
connected to a reﬂex hammer, which enabled pre-selected energy levels and precise
targeting of the patellar tendon. The desired mounting position of the portable media
device for recording the accelerometer signal of the patellar tendon reﬂex response
was through an elastic band proximal to the lateral malleolus about the ankle joint.
The application of the portable media device as a wireless accelerometer platform
with the potential energy impact pendulum successfully quantiﬁed the patellar
tendon reﬂex response in an accurate and consistent context [24]. The iPod func-
tioning as a wireless accelerometer has also been successfully applied for quanti-
fying the patellar tendon reﬂex through supra-maximal manual stimulation [25].
Further investigation regarding the capability of the portable media device as a
wireless accelerometer platform with the potential energy impact pendulum lead to
the synthesis of machine learning. The patellar tendon reﬂex response of a hemi-
plegic affected leg and unaffected leg was recorded as an acceleration signal for
wireless transmission to the Internet. Post-processing derived a feature set con-
sisting of temporal domain and frequency domain related attributes. A support
vector machine was selected as the appropriate machine learning platform, which
achieved considerable classiﬁcation accuracy between a hemiplegic reﬂex pair [26].
The enabling software application can be readily applied to both the portable
media device and smartphone to function as a wireless accelerometer platform.
With respect to remote locations without local wireless Internet connectivity, a
smartphone functions as a more suitable wireless accelerometer platform. The
potential energy impact pendulum in tandem with a smartphone as a wireless
accelerometer platform quantiﬁed the patellar tendon reﬂex response in an accurate
and consistent manner [27]. A representative illustration of the smartphone
mounted about the lateral malleolus near the ankle joint for quantifying the patellar
tendon reﬂex response is provided in Fig. 6.10. Figure 6.11 provides a schematic
perspective of the process for applying the smartphone for the acquisition of reﬂex
response data.

Quantiﬁcation of Patellar Tendon Reﬂex Response
Through Smartphone and Portable Media Device
as a Wireless Gyroscope Platform
The smartphone is equipped with multiple inertial sensors, such as the
accelerometer and gyroscope. The most appropriate sensor for the quantiﬁed signal
recording is dependent on the context of the human movement to be quantiﬁed. For
example, the patellar tendon reﬂex response is inherently rotational in nature, as the
patellar tendon reﬂex is linked about the knee joint. In consideration of this
observation, a smartphone functioning as a wireless gyroscope platform would be
highly desirable [1–3, 28].
During 2014 LeMoyne et al. applied a smartphone as a wireless gyroscope
platform to quantify the reﬂex response of the patellar tendon. The gyroscope signal
represents the angular rate of rotation, which provides a highly clinically repre-
sentable quantiﬁcation of the reﬂex response. The tendon reﬂex was evoked using
the potential energy impact pendulum. Trial data was conveyed by wireless con-
nectivity to the Internet as an email with the capacity for post-processing facilitated

by software automation. The resulting data displayed considerable accuracy and
consistency [28].
With a local wireless Internet connection the experiment can be conducted
anywhere in the world and the post-processing can be conducted in a remote
location. For example, LeMoyne and Mastroianni acquired a series of patellar
tendon reﬂex response samples through a portable media device functioning as a
wireless gyroscope platform in Lhasa, Tibet. The trial data was wirelessly trans-
mitted to the Internet for post-processing in Flagstaff, Arizona of the United States
of America. The implications of this experimental endeavor are that the experi-
mental and post-processing resources can be literally situated on opposite sides of
the world [13]. This conﬁguration has been extended to machine learning algo-
rithms, while attaining considerable classiﬁcation accuracy for distinguishing
between the hemiplegic affected and unaffected patellar tendon response [29].
Further testing and evaluation of the smartphone and portable media device as a
wireless gyroscope platform for quantifying the patellar tendon reﬂex response
involved classiﬁcation of a hemiplegic patellar tendon reﬂex pair using machine
learning. The multilayer perceptron neural network was applied as the machine

learning algorithm. A feature set was developed using a software automation
process regarding the post-processing of the experimental trial data. The feature set
consisted of maximum and minimum of the gyroscope signal and the temporal
disparity between maximum and minimum. The multilayer perceptron neural net-
work achieved considerable classiﬁcation accuracy with respect to distinguishing
between an affected leg and unaffected leg hemiplegic reﬂex pair [30, 31].
A representative gyroscope signal of the patellar tendon reﬂex response is
demonstrated by Fig. 6.12 with maximum and minimum of the gyroscope signal
identiﬁed for developing the feature set. Further extension of the relevance of
machine learning classiﬁcation has been extended to the application of K-nearest
neighbors, logistic regression, support vector machine, and the J48 decision tree for
achieving notable classiﬁcation accuracy that differentiates between the hemiplegic
affected and unaffected patellar tendon reﬂex responses [32].

research has successfully contrasted the smartphone inertial sensor to conventional
triaxial accelerometer recordings [34]. Gait attributes, such as variability, have been
successfully assessed through applications developed for the smartphone [35].
Smartphoneshavealsobeenappliedtoactivitiesthatareassociatedwithgait,suchas
sitting and standing [36]. Clinical approaches to evaluating balance and mobility have
been facilitated using the sensor capabilities of the smartphone, such as for measuring
Timed Up and Go test [37]. The smartphone has been successfully demonstrated for
other scenarios, such as the six-minute walk test (6MWT) and expanded timed
Get-up-and-Go (ETGUG) test [38–40]. With inertial sensor data recorded from the
smartphone respective of the ETGUG test and sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transition
subjects that are frail and nonfrail have been distinguished [41, 42].
The capabilities of the smartphone enable the diagnosis of frailty [43]. The
smartphone has been demonstrated for the role of contributing to the evaluation of
early diagnosis of frailty onset [44]. Smartphone applications with the inertial
sensor package have been developed for the assessment of risk of falling [45, 46].
Other smartphone endeavors have been evaluated for health monitoring systems
regarding gait for people with chronic disease [47]. With respect to rheumatoid
arthritis, the smartphone has demonstrated the capability to determine gait abnor-
malities [48, 49].
Smartphones have been further applied to the domain of evaluating people with
Parkinson’s disease. With the smartphones inertial sensor measuring gait the
capacity to distinguish between people with and without Parkinson’s disease has
been demonstrated [50]. The determination of onset of Parkinson’s disease has been
developed through a smartphone application providing gait monitoring [51].
Smartphones have contributed to the assessment of gait variability and freezing of
gait for people with Parkinson’s disease [52, 53]. Further extrapolation the smart-
phone for evaluating Parkinson’s disease progression has been combined with
Cloud Computing [54].

Network Centric Therapy by Application
of the Smartphone and Portable Media Device
The smartphone and portable media device demonstrate the considerable potential
of Network Centric Therapy from a preliminary vantage point. With the proper
software application they can both function as either functionally wireless
accelerometer or gyroscope platforms. Intuitively they also constitute wearable
systems. Using wireless connectivity to the Internet their data samples can be
readily emailed to a secure location with the email address resembling a Cloud
Computing data storage site. The device selection is a matter of environmental
setting under consideration.
With respect to a localized setting with a prescribed geographic boundary the
portable media device may be advantageous. The portable media device in general
88

is cost affordable and does not require a marginal cost to support its telecommu-
nication package. With access to a local wireless Internet zone and proper software
application the device represents a wearable and wireless inertial sensor package
capable of recording both the accelerometer and gyroscope signal for a subject’s
localized activities.
The portable media device can be particularly useful also in a clinical setting
with wireless connectivity, such as for the quantiﬁcation of a subject’s reﬂex
response. Furthermore the data stored in at an email resource can establish a patient
history for historical trend analysis and prognostics forecasting. As a gait analysis
tool the portable media device could greatly facilitate homebound assessment of a
patient’s state of rehabilitation.
By contrast the smartphone is enabled with a broader telecommunication
package, for which more remote wireless connectivity to the Internet is feasible.
Although the smartphone generally requires a marginal cost to support its
telecommunication package, it is capable of recording accelerometer and gyroscope
signal data in more autonomous settings at the users discretion, especially outdoors.
Likewise the smartphone can email its recorded inertial signal data as an email
attachment by wireless connectivity to the Internet with the secure email address
representing a functional Cloud Computing site for data storage and remote data
processing.
With its telecommunication footprint, the smartphone is capable of wirelessly
conveying its recorded accelerometer or gyroscope signal without direct access to a
wireless zone for connectivity to the Internet. For remote and rural settings this
capability may be useful for acquisition of a patient’s preliminary neurological
screening by means of tracking the reﬂex response. The smartphone is especially
relevant to monitoring and quantifying gait, since effective Internet connectivity is
generally feasible for a considerable amount of outdoor and indoor scenarios of the
patient’s choosing.
With consideration of Network Centric Therapy a patient and therapist are
interactively linked through the Internet through the bridging provided by the
smartphone and portable media device as a wireless inertial sensor apparatus that is
readily wearable. This technology provides an alternative to being encumbered by
the logistical implications of periodic therapy appointments, for which the clinical
temporal snapshot may also be an issue of contention. A subject can provide the
therapist with feedback through these wearable and wireless devices as to their
status of rehabilitation by simply walking in a preferred setting.
The acquired data packages can be wirelessly transmitted to the Internet by email
for storage and processing. The efﬁcacy of a therapy strategy can be objectively
assessed and further optimized while augmented by post-processing resources, such
as machine learning classiﬁcation. Other implications of Network Centric Therapy
also warrant further optimization.
Although in principle there is no true bound to the number of patients needing
rehabilitation, there is effectively a bound to the number of trained therapists
existing a speciﬁc geographic setting. Consider the continental United States, for
which the patient to therapist ratio is under strain in the Southeast but relatively

relaxed in the Northwest. Even though therapists in the state of Washington are on
the order of thousands of miles remote to patients in Florida, they could proactively
interact with meaningful rehabilitation in the context of Network Centric Therapy.
Another implication is the interactive nature of Network Centric Therapy.
Thousands of patients and therapists could coalesce their rehabilitation experiences
into a global data resource with the goal of further optimizing the therapy strategy.
This perspective would likely enhance the individualized probability of robust
rehabilitation and recovery.
The data storage nature of Network Center Therapy can be further facilitated in
the context of data science. Machine learning classiﬁcation could be applied to
identify the transitional states between various classes of therapy strategy and
degree of challenge to the respective patient. With individualized rehabilitation
trend history facilitating prognostics for each unique subject a revolution in medical
and therapy intervention is highly likely.

Conclusion
The smartphone and portable media device have been successfully demonstrated as
wearable and wireless accelerometer and gyroscope platforms for the quantiﬁcation
of gait and reﬂex response. The smartphone as a wireless accelerometer platform
was applied ﬁrst for the quantiﬁcation of gait, with the associated portable media
device likewise applied for evaluating gait. Further endeavors applied 3D printed
adapters for mounting to transtibial prosthetic systems for the assessment of
prosthetic gait. Using the wireless gyroscope platform capabilities of the smart-
phone and portable media device scenarios of reduced arm swing have been
classiﬁed through machine learning. In conjunction with the potential energy
impact pendulum of the wireless quantiﬁed reﬂex device, the patellar tendon reﬂex
has been successfully quantiﬁed using the wireless accelerometer and gyroscope,
and considerable machine learning classiﬁcation accuracy has been achieved for
distinguishing between a hemiplegic reﬂex pair (affected and unaffected). These
developmental trends are envisioned to facilitate the development of Network
Centric Therapy, which will radically advance the rehabilitation experience.

Bluetooth Inertial Sensors for Gait
and Reﬂex Response Quantiﬁcation
with Perspectives Regarding Cloud
Computing and the Internet of Things
Abstract Bluetooth wireless enables localized connectivity to a smartphone,
portable media device, and tablet. Rather than using these devices as wearable and
wireless systems alone, the nature of Bluetooth wireless enables locally situated
inertial sensors to be mounted to a subject for quantiﬁed evaluation of gait. The
smartphone, portable media device, and tablet can then wirelessly transmit the data
to a Cloud Computing resource for post-processing. Preliminary demonstration is
presented regarding the machine learning classiﬁcation of gait for Friedreich’s
ataxia. A perspective of the application of Bluetooth wireless for reﬂex quantiﬁ-
cation is presented. Themes, such as sensor fusion and the Internet of Things, are
further discussed. The prevalence of Bluetooth wireless further establishes the
realization of Network Centric Therapy.

Introduction
Previous chapters have advocated the considerable evolutionary trends for
improvement regarding wireless and wearable systems. In Chap. 5 ‘Portable
wearable and wireless systems for gait and reﬂex response quantiﬁcation’ the con-
cept of a localized wireless accelerometer is presented. The wireless accelerometer
node is mounted to an aspect of the body for quantiﬁcation of human movement,
such as reﬂex response and gait. The collected experimental data is transmitted
wirelessly to a personal computer for further processing [1–16].
The evolutionary trends wireless and wearable systems are further advanced
through the application of smartphones and portable media devices to measure the
characteristics of human movement, such as reﬂex response and gait. Smartphones
and portable media devices are not only equipped with the capacity to measure

movement features through their integral inertial sensors. They can also achieve
wireless Internet connectivity, for which the acquired data can be conveyed as an
email attachment for post-processing anywhere in the world [17–38]. The intro-
duction of Bluetooth wireless considerably enhances the opportunity for the
quantiﬁcation of gait and reﬂex response through its inherent localized wireless
connectivity [39].
7.2
Utility of Bluetooth
Bluetooth enables the advanced utility of synergizing these advancing trends in
localized wearable and wireless inertial sensors in conjunction with any device that
is capable of connecting with Bluetooth wireless, such as smartphones, portable
media devices, and even tablets [39, 40]. Bluetooth provides localized wireless
connectivity between two devices. This application can enable a local inertial
sensor to wirelessly stream data to a more powerful device with advanced com-
putational power, such as a smartphone, portable media device, or tablet. The data
can be processed at the device level or conveyed to a Cloud Computing resource for
post-processing [40].
In particular Bluetooth enables the utilization of miniaturized sensors [39]. In
essence this capability enables the application of inertial sensors that solely require
a power source for the operation of their sensor package and localized wireless
transmission using Bluetooth. With reduced power requirements the inertial sensor
can be further miniaturized, which can beneﬁt the mounting procedure [39–41].
7.3
Applications of Bluetooth Connected Sensors
for Gait Analysis
Prajapati et al. [42] applied the use of Bluetooth for the development of a wearable
and wireless system referred to as ABLE (Accelerometry for Bilateral Lower
Extremities). ABLE measured gait through the application of two Sparkfun wireless
accelerometers bilaterally secured about the lateral malleolus near the ankle joint.
The accelerometer data was conveyed wirelessly to a waist mounted PDA, which
functioned as a data logger. The acquired data was then transmitted to a computer,
which would serve the role of data storage and post-processing. The ABLE system
demonstrated the ability to monitor hemiplegic gait, which may improve therapist
acuity of patient status for a more proactive rehabilitation pathway [42]. Guo et al.
applied a similar low energy wireless architecture for distinguishing gait charac-
teristics for subjects with hemiplegic gait symptoms and asymptomatic subjects
[43].

Bluetooth Inertial Sensors for Gait and Reﬂex Response …

Smartphones have been synchronized with sensor devices using Bluetooth for
local wireless transmission, which has augmented the capability of the smartphone
as a mobile platform for gait analysis [44]. For example, footswitches have been
demonstrated using Bluetooth to connect to a smartphone, which enables the
acquisition of temporal aspects of gait in an autonomous context [45]. Other similar
themed approaches have applied pressure sensors with Bluetooth connecting with a
smartphone for data processing and auditory feedback pertaining to the quality of
gait during stance phase [46].
Wireless Bluetooth connectivity between inertial sensors and a smartphone have
been applied to subjects, such as Parkinson’s disease and evaluating risk of falling
[47, 48]. For subjects with Parkinson’s disease this approach has been applied for
the smartphone processing inertial signal data and proving auditory feedback for the
adjustment of gait strategy [47]. Inertial and pressure sensors have transmitted their
data signal by Bluetooth to a smartphone for the objective of assessing the risk of
falling [48].
7.4
Wearable and Wireless Inertial Sensors Using
Bluetooth, Tablet, and Cloud Computing
Bluetooth Low Energy wireless connectivity is suitable for extremely local wireless
linkage. For example, a small sensor node, such as the Texas Instruments Sensor
Tag, can connect to a locally positioned tablet [41]. An experimental trial could
connect with the conveyed data from the inertial sensor, consisting of both gyro-
scope and accelerometer, for transmission to a Cloud Computing data storage
resource for later post-processing. This architecture involves in effect a two step
wireless transmission. The inertial sensor node, which may potentially consist of
nine degrees of freedom (accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer) conveys its
data to a nearby tablet. The tablet later conveys the data package to a Cloud
Computing resource for later post-processing. An advantage of this strategy is the
sensor node is relatively smaller than the smartphone and portable media device,
while also application speciﬁc with regards to the acquisition of inertial data, such
as acceleration and angular rate of rotation [40]. A schematic of this strategy is
illustrated in Fig. 7.1.
The strategy of applying an inertial sensor node with Bluetooth Low Energy
wireless connectivity to a tablet for wireless transmission to a cloud computer
server was achieved as an augment for the Timed 25 Foot Walk test. Rather than
only recording the temporal displacement based on traversing a 25 foot hallway
passage, inertial sensor nodes were mounted about the anterior aspect of the tibia
and proximal to the ankle joint. The acquisition of an accelerometer and gyroscope
signal greatly facilitated the available information obtained during the Timed 25
Foot Walk test [40].
7.3
Applications of Bluetooth Connected Sensors for Gait Analysis
97

For example, the accelerometer and gyroscope data was applied to develop a
feature set for a machine learning scenario. The accelerometer signal established the
temporal disparity from stance initiation to stance initiation. The gyroscope signal
in terms of roll and yaw further populated the feature set. These attributes of the
feature set were applied to classify between a subject with healthy gait and a subject
with Friedreich’s ataxia, which is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to pro-
gressively impaired coordination, such as during gait [40].
With the application of a multilayer perceptron neural network for the machine
learning algorithm considerable classiﬁcation accuracy of the feature set was
attained for distinguishing between a subject with healthy gait and a subject with
Friedreich’s ataxia [40]. The research implications are the capacity to diagnose a
person with a neurodegenerative disease in the nascent state for optimal treatment
though a simple activity, such as walking. Such an approach could also be applied
to ascertain progressive states of the neurodegenerative disease under consideration.
Another similar themed application that applies Bluetooth wireless connectivity
to a tablet is the BioStampRC. The BioStampRC is comprised of an accelerometer
and gyroscope enabling six degrees of freedom. The sensor has a mass on the order
of six grams. Another signiﬁcant advantage is the observation that the BioStampRC
literally is comparable to the volumetric size of a bandage. The sensor streams its
inertial data package to a tablet for subsequent wireless transmission to a Cloud
Computing resource for storage and later post-processing [49].

Bluetooth Wireless Capability for Reﬂex
Quantiﬁcation
The wireless quantiﬁed reﬂex device successfully applied a wireless accelerometer
node linked to a local personal computer for data storage [1–11]. Although tran-
scended by the capabilities presented in part 7.4 ‘Wearable and wireless inertial
sensors using Bluetooth, tablet, and Cloud Computing’, the wireless quantiﬁed
reﬂex device can be further advanced with Bluetooth wireless, tablet, and Cloud
Computing. A subject could temporarily wear an inertial sensor for quantifying the
reﬂex response and possibly reﬂex latency if another inertial sensor is mounted
about the potential energy impact pendulum. The Bluetooth could wirelessly
transmit the trial data to a clinician’s tablet with further wireless transfer to the
Cloud Computing resource for post-processing. In a Network Centric Therapy
scenario the reﬂex quantiﬁcation data could be applied for historic trend analysis of
rehabilitation status, diagnosis of therapy intervention, machine learning classiﬁ-
cation prognosis, and optimization of rehabilitation process. Preliminary insight of
this capability has been demonstrated through the machine learning classiﬁcation of
gait for people with Friedreich’s ataxia [40].
7.6
Relevance for Sensor Fusion
These trends in wireless and wearable systems facilitate the application of sensor
fusion. Sensor fusion applies the data of mutually sampled accelerometer and
gyroscope signals to derive localized displacement, velocity, and acceleration as a
function of time representative of the sensor location. For example, a foot mounted
six degree of freedom sensor would be able to determine the trajectory of foot
clearance during swing phase of gait [50].
7.7
Internet of Things
These trends in wearable and wireless systems further lead to the advent of the
Internet of Things. The concept of the Internet of Things pertains to the connectivity
of sensors and devices to the Internet, which have been advocated through out the
previous chapters. A primary subject for the Internet of Things has been envisioned
to be for the tracking and monitoring of health status [51]. Combined with the
application of machine learning as a post-processing tool, prognostic acuity can be
reﬁned throughout the rehabilitation process [52].

7.8
Network Centric Therapy: The Signiﬁcance
of Bluetooth
The application of Bluetooth enables the physical separation of the device and
sensor. A sensor can be solely scaled to the context of the application with regards
to processing and power requirements. As discussed throughout the chapter the
sensor level can achieve a mass that is on the scale of an order of magnitude less
than a smartphone and a portable media device. Using a device, such as a smart-
phone, portable media device, and tablet the data can be locally processed and
wirelessly transmitted using Internet connectivity to a Cloud Computing resource
[17–41, 49]. These trends are envisioned to substantially facilitate Network Centric
Therapy, for which a team of experts, post-processing resources, and patient can be
situated anywhere in the world while all provided with augmented situational
awareness and acuity of the rehabilitation cycle.
7.9
Conclusion
Bluetooth wireless enhances the capability for wearable and wireless systems that is
envisioned to synergize the smartphone, portable media device, and tablet with the
Internet of Things and Cloud Computing. Through Bluetooth the inertial sensor can
be further miniaturized with local wireless connectivity to a smartphone, portable
media device, and tablet for subsequent wireless transmission to Cloud Computing
resources for post-processing. Applications of Bluetooth have been successfully
demonstrated in an assortment of gait analysis scenarios. The Bluetooth inertial
sensor wireless connectivity to a tablet conﬁguration has been successfully applied
for differentiating between gait for Friedreich’s ataxia and healthy gait through
machine learning classiﬁcation. These observed capabilities of Bluetooth imply its
suitability for reﬂex quantiﬁcation. Sensor fusion is foreseen to be an enhanced
capability through the application of wireless inertial sensors using Bluetooth.
These developments are predicted to augment the proliferation of Network Centric
Therapy through advancing the proactive feedback and assessment of therapy
strategy throughout the rehabilitation cycle.

Quantifying the Spatial Position
Representation of Gait Through
Sensor Fusion
Abstract Wearable and wireless systems equipped with the ability to mutually
record the accelerometer and gyroscope signal can be applied to sensor fusion.
Sensor fusion can provide the location of the inertial sensor with trajectory infor-
mation, such as displacement, velocity, and acceleration as a function of time. In
order to achieve the results of sensor fusion multiple subjects must be applied, such
as the use of quaternion mathematics and orientation ﬁltering. A traditional ori-
entation ﬁlter is the Kalman ﬁlter; however, the gradient descent orientation ﬁlter
offers a more computationally robust alternative that is suitable for wearable and
wireless systems. The result information provided by sensor fusion is particularly
useful for the assessment of gait trajectory. Sensor fusion is anticipated to enhance
Network Centric Therapy with improved visualization of patient status.

Introduction
Sensor fusion is capable of determining the spatial position of the lower limbs during
gait based on recording through wearable and wireless inertial sensors consisting of
the accelerometer and gyroscope. The sensor fusion software algorithm for pro-
cessing the accelerometer and gyroscope signal data primarily consists of an efﬁcient
orientation ﬁlter and zero velocity update to mitigate the inﬂuence of signal drift.
Execution of this process provides an earth frame acceleration proﬁle of the lower
limb, which represents a general representation of the foot during gait. Subsequently,
integration of the acceleration proﬁle yields the velocity proﬁle. Velocity drift
mitigation is applied to the integral of the velocity proﬁle to provide the spatial
orientation of the lower limb respective of the the foot. The chapter consolidates
these concepts of sensor fusion for the determination of lower limb spatial position
during gait through wearable and wireless inertial measurement sensors.

8.2
Sensor Level
There are two classes of sensors applied to establish spatial orientation: the inertial
measurement unit (IMU) and magnetic angular rate and gravity sensor (MARG).
Both types of sensors consist of an accelerometer and gyroscope, which measure
acceleration and rate of angular rotation [1–3]. An issue the with the MARG type
sensor is the magnetometer, which can be used to determine heading in accordance
with the local presence of the Earth’s magnetosphere, could be perturbed by
localized ferromagnetic material (metal) and localized magnet interference from
electronic systems [4]. For the scope of this chapter the IMU’s are the subject of
focus.
8.3
Orientation Filter
An orientation ﬁlter is an imperative aspect of determining spatial orientation. There
are two types of orientation ﬁlter under consideration the Kalman ﬁlter and gradient
descent ﬁlter. The gradient descent ﬁlter was developed on the order of half a
century after the development of the Kalman ﬁlter [5–8].
8.3.1
Kalman Filter
During the 1960s the Kalman ﬁlter was developed, originally for aerospace
applications [4, 5]. These applications may be correlated the power, mass, and
volume constraints of a missile system or spacecraft, rather than for a wearable and
wireless system for monitoring human motion. For this application context high
sampling rates, generally in excess of 500 Hz, are warranted [7, 8].
Recently Rebula et al. [9] implemented a version of the Kalman ﬁlter to suc-
cessfully determine foot position during gait. The Kalman ﬁlter mitigates sensor drift,
such as for the gyroscope, through the application of the accelerometer as an incli-
nometer. Process noise is approximated through the variance of the accelerometer
and gyroscope. Notable achievements of this research endeavor involved IMU’s
sampling at 150 Hz by Memsense and the algorithm was successfully contrasted to
optical motion capture, which is a traditional gait analysis system [9].
In particular the Kalman ﬁlter was primarily developed during the Cold War for
aerospace applications, not wearable and wireless systems, which have become
ubiquitous roughly a half-century later [5]. A new perspective for orientation ﬁlters
in consideration of the contextual attributes of wearable and wireless systems, such
as a more conservative sampling rate and reduced level of computational intensity,
would be highly desirable. Dr. Madgwick has successfully achieved these criteria
with incorporating gradient descent algorithm as an orientation ﬁlter [7, 8].

8.3.2
Gradient Descent Orientation Filter
Two versions of the gradient descent orientation ﬁlter are applicable to the both the
IMU and MARG sensors. The IMU version only requires 109 scalar arithmetic
operations per ﬁlter update, and the MARG version only needs 277 operations. This
ﬁlter is capable of functioning at minimal sampling rates, such as 10 Hz. Both
versions are comprised of adjustable parameter determined by observable system
attributes [7, 8].
Performance of the gradient descent ﬁlter was successfully contrasted to optical
motion capture and commercial Kalman ﬁlter algorithm. In summary the algorithm
applies an analytically derived Jacobian, which substantially reduces computational
load relative to traditional approaches. Complex tuning is ameliorated through a
singular parameter (Beta) established by the gyroscope measurement error [7, 8].
Madgwick has provided the gradient descent ﬁlter utilizing the accelerometer and
gyroscope, which is provided in Appendix A of the manuscript composed by
Madgwick [7].
8.4
Quaternions
The ﬁlter by Madgwick takes input from the accelerometer and gyroscope and
provides a quaternion to establish rotational orientation [7, 8]. Hamilton invented
quaternion mathematics during the 1800s [10]. The advantage of quaternions is
they represent a more computationally robust alternative to characterizing rotational
orientation to other methodologies, such as Euler angles. Euler angle representation
is susceptible to issues, such as gimbal lock. A quaternion is a four dimensional
representation with a scalar and three component vector. Quaternion mathematics is
disparate from traditional mathematics, such as quaternions are non-commutative
[11]. Current application pertains to computer graphic applications and all domains
for deﬁning sensor derived spatial orientation, such as robotics and biomedical
motion analysis.
8.5
Zero Velocity Update
Even with sophisticated orientation ﬁlters sensor drift can still radically perturb the
authentic spatial orientation of derived from an accelerometer and gyroscope sensor
package [7, 9, 12]. During gait there are two major phases: swing and stance. The
primary motion while walking occurs during swing. Stance can be subdivided into
three subphases: controller plantar ﬂexion, controlled dorsiﬂexion, and powered
plantar ﬂexion. During controlled dorsiﬂexion the sole of the shoe during walking is
stationary relative to the ground [13–15]. Essentially the foot is at zero velocity.
8.3
Orientation Filter
107

During this subphase of gait the spatial position algorithm can be reset and
incremented according to the position of the previous condition [9, 12].
Researchers have utilized this characteristic of gait by applying the IMU to the
dorsum of the foot about the top of the shoe. With a threshold detection algorithm,
such as applying a threshold to the magnitude of the acceleration, an effective zero
velocity update approximating stance can be derived. The spatial orientation
algorithm is then applied from the terminal aspect of stance throughout swing and
to the preliminary aspect of stance. The inclusion of a zero velocity update has been
demonstrated to mitigate sensor drift essentially resetting the conditions for the
spatial position algorithm [9].
The Bluetooth technology featured in Chap. 7 serves a particular role for
enabling the detection of the zero velocity update during stance phase of gait. The
smartphone and portable media device are intended to measure gait with leg
mounted scenarios [16–19]. Mounting these devices about the top of the shoe to
acquire a zero velocity update would intuitively encumber the gait cycle. With
localized wireless connectivity of inertial sensors to a resource for storage and
computation the zero velocity update of gait can be readily determined [9, 12]. This
capability is particularly facilitated through the application of inertial sensor nodes
with Bluetooth wireless connectivity [20–22].
8.6
Velocity Estimation and Trajectory Formation
Once the rotational orientation is acquired the true spatial representation of the
acceleration proﬁle can be determined. The true spatial acceleration is achieved by
computing the production of the rotational orientation quaternion and the sensor
frame acceleration. Integrating acceleration derives velocity. With a translational
velocity obtained further mitigation of velocity drift can be applied by removing
any excess offset of velocity during stance phase. Trajectory formation can be
acquired by integration of the velocity proﬁle [7–9].
8.7
Network Centric Therapy and the Role of Sensor
Fusion
Sensor fusion enhances the Network Centric Therapy experience, especially from a
remote clinical perspective. A remotely situated therapist can visualize the motion
of the patient based on the reconstruction of trajectory for a patient wearing wireless
inertial sensors. These trajectories can be visualized for therapy exercises and
evaluation scenarios. Since a collection of historic data can be developed com-
parative trends of motion trajectories, such as gait, can be contrasted to optimize the
rehabilitation strategy.

Conclusion
Sensor fusion enables the trajectory tracking of a speciﬁcally mounted inertial
sensor based on its accelerometer and gyroscope signal. With the results of sensor
fusion, the displacement, velocity, and acceleration as a function of time can be
presented. In order to achieve sensor fusion an appropriate orientation ﬁlter must be
selected. The gradient descent orientation ﬁlter offers a computationally efﬁcient
strategy as an orientation ﬁlter relative to traditional approaches, such as the
Kalman ﬁlter. With accelerometer and gyroscope data applied to the ﬁlter, the
output is generated in quaternion format. Quaternion mathematics offers a better
alternative to Euler angle representation, which is prone to gimbal lock. The
application of sensor fusion is envisioned to enhance the capability of Network
Centric Therapy as an advanced visualization tool.

Role of Machine Learning for Gait
and Reﬂex Response Classiﬁcation
Abstract Over the span of the past decade machine learning has been applied to
distinguishing between disparate health status scenarios with considerable classi-
ﬁcation accuracy. Recent examples pertain to notable classiﬁcation accuracy with
regards to gait and reﬂex response disparity, especially in the context of a hemi-
plegic affected leg and unaffected leg. Machine learning classiﬁcation serves as an
instrumental post-processing methodology for the signal acquired through a
wearable and wireless accelerometer or gyroscope. A summary of machine learning
platforms is presented. The application and demonstration of machine learning as a
diagnostic tool is described within the scope of gait, reﬂex response, and associated
subjects. The amalgamation of machine learning and wearable and wireless systems
is anticipated to further evolve Network Centric Therapy with capabilities, such as
prognostic assessment of rehabilitation, objective consideration of therapy efﬁcacy,
therapy optimization, and diagnosis of appropriate transitional phases of therapy
strategy.

Introduction
Machine learning offers a quantum leap in capability for the biomedical healthcare
community. This technique enables the ability to computationally diagnose a
patient’s rehabilitation status in a repeatable, objective, and highly automated
manner. By contrast to the subjective interpretation of an expert clinician, the same
machine learning algorithm can be applied to determine the patient’s rehabilitation
status through the recovery cycle [1–5].

Success with machine learning has been demonstrated through the application of
Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis has been conducted in synergy with
the quantiﬁed parameters derived from the inertial sensor signals from wearable and
wireless devices for characterizing human movement, such as gait and reﬂex
response [1–5]. Five preferred machine learning algorithms, such as the J48 decision
tree, K-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, support vector machine, and multi-
layer perceptron neural network are discussed from a perspective vantage with their
role for classifying disparate scenarios of human movement, such as gait and reﬂex.
9.2
Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis
(WEKA) for Machine Learning Classiﬁcation
of Human Movement Characteristics Through
Wearable and Wireless Devices
A highly available software platform for machine learning is the Waikato
Environment for Knowledge Analysis, which is commonly referred to by the
machine learning community as WEKA. The WEKA machine learning platform
facilitates to the scientiﬁc community the means to readily utilize the power of
machine learning to classify their data. WEKA incorporates an effective graphic
user interface for operation [6–8]. As sample of the WEKA graphic user interface is
provided in Fig. 9.1.
In order to conduct machine learning classiﬁcation for the application of wireless
and wearable systems, such as the smartphone and portable media devices, to
distinguish hemiplegic affected and unaffected side, a feature set must be developed
[9–13]. The feature set consists of attributes and classes. Attributes can consist of
numeric values. The respective classes are the disparate sets of data that will be
distinguished by a machine learning classiﬁcation accuracy [6–8].
Post-processing of the accelerometer or gyroscope signal can facilitate the
establishment of the attributes for the feature set. During this aspect of developing
the feature set, the acuity of the research team is imperative. For example, the
observation of the data can elucidate the relevance of maxima, minima, temporal
disparity between the maxima and minima, descriptive statistics of the signal, and
associated aspects of the frequency domain. These attributes are generally extracted
from the data through software automation for consistent post-processing. The
attributes and their classes are further consolidated into an Attribute-Relation File
Format (ARFF) ﬁle [9–14].
The primary output of WEKA is the classiﬁcation accuracy of the respective
feature set. Classiﬁcation accuracy is the percentage of correctly classiﬁed relative
to the total number of classes. The confusion matrix further reﬁnes the nature of the
classiﬁcation accuracy, such as which speciﬁc classes were correctly and incorrectly
classiﬁed in matrix format [6–8].

Role of Machine Learning for Gait and Reﬂex Response …

Certain machine learning algorithms using WEKA, such as the J48 decision tree
and the multilayer perceptron neural network, offer visual insight. The WEKA
version of the J48 decision tree provides the actual decision tree for deriving the
optimal classiﬁcation accuracy. The logical structure of the J48 decision tree further
reﬁnes the insight for the research team with respect to the most signiﬁcant attri-
butes that contribute to the classiﬁcation accuracy as demonstrated in Fig. 9.2 [6–8,
15].

The WEKA version of the multilayer perceptron neural network also provides
visualization of the machine learning strategy. The illustration of the multilayer
perceptron neural network consists of the input layer, hidden layer, and output
layer. The input layer consists of the attributes of the feature set. The hidden layer
interconnects the input layer and output layer. The output layer is represented by the
classes of the feature set. A representative multilayer perceptron neural network is
provided in Fig. 9.3 [6–8, 16].
As WEKA features a considerable amount of available machine learning
strategies, the appropriate machine learning strategy is relative to the research
team’s expert perception of the feature set [6–9]. In particular WEKA is comprised
of ﬁve machine learning strategies that warrant further consideration with regards to
their algorithms:
• J48 decision tree
• K-nearest neighbors
• Logistic regression
• Support vector machine
• Multilayer perceptron neural network [6–8]
These machine learning algorithms are each uniquely equipped with the capacity to
classify a feature set derived from the inertial sensor signal of a wireless and
wearable system.

Role of Machine Learning for Gait and Reﬂex Response …

9.2.1
J48 Decision Tree
The WEKA version of the J48 decision tree based on the C4.5 decision tree
algorithm and is included with the ability to visualize the decision tree developed
for the classiﬁcation endeavor. This visualization capability facilitates the assess-
ment of the predominance of the attributes for establishing the derived classiﬁcation
algorithm [6–8]. The J48 decision tree has been successfully applied to achieve
considerable classiﬁcation accuracy for the differentiation of a hemiplegic patellar
tendon reﬂex pair (affected leg and unaffected leg) through the quantiﬁcation of the
reﬂex response through the signal of a portable media device and smartphone
wireless gyroscope platform [13, 15].
The J48 algorithm applies information theory to derive the most precise decision
tree. The strategy maximizes information gain by the quantiﬁcation of entropy with
information measured in bits. The algorithm utilizes a top-down strategy, and a
recursive divide and conquer approach is applied. During this process a decision
tree is developed with a root node. From the root node emerge a sequence of
branches that apply a quantiﬁed evaluation of a particular attribute [6–8].
9.2.2
K-nearest Neighbors
Another extremely useful machine learning algorithm is K-nearest neighbors. The
K-nearest neighbors algorithm has been advocated by statisticians since the 1950s.
Hence,thismachinelearningalgorithmisconsideredrobustandwellestablished[6–8].
By contrast this technique is an instance based learning strategy. Piecewise
linear decision boundaries are collected through the algorithm. With the training
instances determined, the algorithm seeks to ascertain the most similar training set
relative to the new instance [6–8]. The K-nearest neighbors technique has also been
successfully applied for discerning between a hemiplegic patellar tendon reﬂex pair
(affected leg and unaffected leg) with considerable classiﬁcation accuracy [13].
9.2.3
Logistic Regression
Logistic regression represents a more powerful algorithm by contrast to the use of
linear regression for the endeavor of classiﬁcation. An intrinsic feature of the
logistic regression algorithm is the logit transform. The logit transform is compu-
tationally represented through a sigmoidal function [6–8].
A recent successful application for logistic regression is the machine learning
classiﬁcation for hemiplegic leg pair during gait. The feature set was derived from
the ground reaction force signal recorded by a force plate during stance phase of
gait respective of the hemiplegic affected leg and unaffected leg, and considerable
9.2
Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) for Machine …
115

classiﬁcation accuracy was attained. A desirable feature of the logistic regression
machine learning algorithm is the capacity to address the broad range of the
pathology’s changes in distribution [17].
9.2.4
Support Vector Machine
The support vector machine learning algorithm involves a mathematical transfor-
mation of the feature set into a hyperspace representation. The hyperspace is
subsequently consolidated into a hyperplane by means of applying a kernel. With
regards to the hyperplane a support vector is used to differentiate between the
classes that comprise the feature set [6–8, 18].
The support vector machine has attained considerable classiﬁcation accuracy with
regards to differentiating disparate signals acquired by wearable and wireless sys-
tems. For example, a portable media device achieved considerable classiﬁcation
accuracy between a hemiplegic affected and unaffected patellar tendon reﬂex pair
[9]. Novel 3D printed applications, such as the ankle rehabilitation system, in tandem
with a smartphone as a wireless gyroscope platform have successfully utilized the
support vector machine to attain considerable classiﬁcation accuracy with regards to
differentiating between a hemiplegic affected ankle and unaffected ankle [10].
9.2.5
Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network
With regards to the machine learning algorithms presented the multilayer percep-
tron neural network provides a methodology that is most similar to the function of
the brain and its perceptive qualities. The concept is based on the multilayer per-
ceptron neural network functioning as a computational equivalent to the neuron,
which is a foundational aspect of the brain [6–8, 19, 20]. The multilayer perceptron
neural network has been applied in multiple scenarios using wearable and wireless
health applications, such as for therapy techniques, powered prosthetic control
algorithms, and hemiplegic tendon reﬂex pairs [12, 16, 21–23].
9.2.6
Attribute-Relation File Format (ARFF) File
Regarding WEKA the Attribute-Relation File Format (ARFF) ﬁle stores the
quantiﬁed data, for which a machine learning algorithm derives a classiﬁcation
algorithm. The primary aspects of the ARFF ﬁle are the numeric attributes that
compose the feature set. The feature set consists of an array of parameters that at the
discretion of machine learning classiﬁcation team are considered to best represent
the experiment under consideration [6–8]. For example, when considering the
116
9
Role of Machine Learning for Gait and Reﬂex Response …

gyroscope signal of the patellar tendon reﬂex response, the maximum for the
gyroscope signal would logically be a highly relevant numeric attribute for a feature
set [12].
ARFF ﬁles for WEKA are ﬂexible in terms of the software application
amenability. ARFF ﬁles can be conveyed to Comma-Separated-Value (CSV) ﬁles
for operation using Excel. This capability enables the opportunity to modify
speciﬁc numeric attributes of the ARFF ﬁle [6–8].
Post-processing resulting in an ARFF ﬁle is conventionally achieved through
software automation programs. Matlab and Python have been successfully imple-
mented for the automated generation of ARFF ﬁles. Essentially, the signal data of
each experimental trial is stored in a text or CSV ﬁle. Automation programs
facilitated by Matlab or Python extract the relevant numeric attributes for the signal
of each experiment trial. The preliminary ARFF ﬁle is ﬁrst comprised of substantive
deﬁnitions of the nature of the attributes and available classes to be distinguished
through machine learning classiﬁcation. Each experimental trial’s feature set is
sequentially acquired and amended to the ARFF ﬁle until all experimental trial data
is incorporated into the ARFF ﬁle for pending machine learning classiﬁcation [3, 9,
11, 12, 14, 17, 19, 21–25].
9.3
Utility of Machine Learning with Future Perspective
on Network Centric Therapy
Machine learning is envisioned to considerably augment the acuity and opportunity
of wearable and wireless systems for the biomedical and rehabilitation community.
As the machine learning algorithm is software derived, the same algorithm can be
applied to thousands of people partaking in rehabilitation for the same scenario.
Using the same certiﬁed wireless and wearable inertial sensor system to robustly
quantify their movement characteristics, such as gait or reﬂex response, their
recovery status can be accurately classiﬁed through machine learning.
Machine learning classiﬁcation of rehabilitation status can provide a therapist
with enhanced acuity for the evolution or modiﬁcation of a patient’s rehabilitation
strategy. Rather than meeting with a highly constrained quantity of subjects for a
limited duration of time, a ‘network-centric’ form of therapy is enabled. Network
Centric Therapy features machine learning as a keystone for augmented computer
automated diagnostics and prognostics.
A major capability of machine learning is the capacity to enhance classiﬁcation
accuracy and perceptivity with the further amendment of relevant data to better
populate the feature set. This observation can be especially advanced with the
application of Network Centric Therapy. Thousands of patients undergoing a
similar therapy strategy could establish a feature set using the operation of wearable
and wireless systems to objectively quantify their therapy experience and subse-
quent response. Machine learning could then augment the acuity of the therapist for

pending transition to progressively more challenging therapy or application of a
more suitable therapy strategy.
Chapter 10 advocates the usage of smartphones and portable media devices as
robust wearable and wireless systems for contextually homebound therapy. This
chapter offers a key perspective for the goal of attaining Network Centric Therapy.
Portable media devices and smartphones feature software enabling the functional
characteristics of wearable and wireless accelerometer and gyroscope platforms.
Trade-offs for the appropriateness of these devices are a matter of cost and preferred
telecommunication accessibility to the Internet.
Chapter 10 summarizes four scenarios of homebound therapy with wearable and
wireless systems. Portable media devices have been demonstrated in coherence
with machine learning for classifying the appropriateness of assistive device usage.
Even any therapy device, such as a wobble board, for therapy about the ankle-foot
complex can be instrumented with a portable media device to function as a wireless
gyroscope platform in a local homebound setting. Further rehabilitation of the ankle
has been demonstrated with the use of a smartphone to quantify rotational char-
acteristics about the ankle joint. Other more sophisticated applications using
smartphones as wearable and wireless platforms have been demonstrated using the
gyroscope signal as a ‘Virtual Proprioception’ visual biofeedback strategy for
promoting eccentric training.
All of the above research endeavors utilize machine learning to classify their
respective feature sets derived from their accelerometer or gyroscope signal. With
access to the Internet, these applications can be evolved to a Network Centric
Therapy perspective.
9.4
Conclusion
Machine learning offers considerable post-processing impact for the application of
wearable and wireless systems, such as the wireless accelerometer platform and
wireless gyroscope platform, featured by the smartphone and portable media
device. An emphasis is focused on the use of Waikato Environment for Knowledge
Analysis (WEKA), which provides multiple machine learning algorithms. The
preferred algorithm is at the discretion of the research team and the experimental
scenario being considered. In particular ﬁve machine learning algorithms are brieﬂy
presented: J48 decision tree, K-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, support vector
machine, and multilayer perceptron neural network. With the development of a
feature set based on the acquired accelerometer or gyroscope signal data from
wearable and wireless systems, such as the smartphone and portable media device,
post-processing automation produces an Attribute-Relation File Format (ARFF) ﬁle
for machine learning classiﬁcation using WEKA. With this methodology consid-
erable classiﬁcation accuracy has been achieved with regards especially for gait,
reﬂex response, and associated subjects of a hemiplegic affected and unaffected
limb pair. Machine learning is envisioned to provide considerable impact for the

Homebound Therapy with Wearable
and Wireless Systems
Abstract The context of smartphones and portable media devices as wearable and
wireless systems can logically be extrapolated to homebound therapy, especially
with regards to of a rehabilitation for hemiparesis from traumatic brain injury and
stroke. Four applications are addressed. The portable media device operating as a
functionally wireless accelerometer platform can be mounted to a cane for machine
learning classiﬁcation to distinguish appropriate and inappropriate use. An ankle
rehabilitation system can apply a smartphone as a wireless gyroscope to differen-
tiate between a hemiplegic ankle and unaffected ankle. Further applications using a
portable media device as a wireless gyroscope platform involve the use of a wobble
board with machine learning also classifying between a hemiplegic ankle and
unaffected ankle. Another scenario applies the smartphone as a wireless gyroscope
for Virtual Proprioception as feedback for eccentric training while applying
machine learning to classify between Virtual Proprioception feedback and without
Virtual Proprioception feedback for eccentric training. These preliminary systems
are capable of providing essentially autonomous homebound therapy amendable for
Network Centric Therapy.

Introduction
The role of the smartphone and portable media device for objectively measuring
gait and reﬂex response has already been demonstrated in Chap. 6. The current

homebound therapy scenarios through the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors
featured as wireless platforms. Four novel therapy applications are presented in the
current chapter.
The ﬁrst endeavor explores the capability of the portable media device in the
context of a wireless accelerometer platform. The homebound setting of the por-
table media device for connectivity to the Internet by local connectivity enables the
monitoring of the operation of a cane. The experiment classiﬁes through machine
learning appropriate and inappropriate usage of the cane with a portable media
device mounted about the bend to operate as a wireless accelerometer platform [1].
The smartphone can function as a wireless gyroscope platform. This capability
makes it suitable to measure the rotational properties of an ankle rehabilitation
system. By mounting the smartphone to the plate aspect of the ankle rehabilitation
system the gyroscope signal can record the disparity between an hemiplegic pair
consisting of an affected ankle and unaffected ankle. Machine learning is suc-
cessfully applied to classify between these two notably different classes represented
by an affected ankle and unaffected ankle [2].
A wobble board is applied for rehabilitation of the ankle-foot complex. With a
portable media device applied as a wireless gyroscope platform the signal can be
recorded and conveyed to the Internet as an email attachment. Machine learning can
distinguish between a hemiplegic affected and unaffected ankle with respect to
wobble board exercise [3].
The gyroscope signal in particular provides a readily recognizable visualization
of the associated joint, such as the elbow with respect to a biceps curl. With the
visualization of the gyroscope signal in real-time Virtual Proprioception for
eccentric training can be demonstrated. In essence a subject can conduct the
eccentric phase of a bicep curl while using the visual feedback of the gyroscope
signal to ensure that a prescribed threshold is not exceeded. With the trial data
transmitted to remote processing resources, machine learning successfully classiﬁed
between Virtual Proprioception for eccentric training regarding the biceps curl and
a conventional biceps curl [4].
From the perspective of Network Centric Therapy these applications demon-
strate the utility of wearable and wireless systems for a homebound therapy sce-
nario. The smartphone and portable media devices are both equipped with
accelerometer and gyroscope sensors that with the appropriate software application
function as wireless platforms. These devices demonstrate the considerable
potential of wearable and wireless systems for the quantiﬁed assessment of therapy
from a patient’s homebound environment. The experimental data can be readily
conveyed by wireless connectivity to the Internet and subsequently post-processed
from a remote location. Furthermore machine learning can provide considerable
classiﬁcation accuracy for disparate scenarios, such as the hemiplegic affected limb
relative to the unaffected limb [5–8].

Portable Media Device Wireless Accelerometer
Platform for Assistive Device Usage Evaluation
An assistive device, such as a cane, provides essential compensatory strategy for
people with impaired mobility. However, the presence of an assistive device
imparts additional training for a person with difﬁculty walking. A clinician or
therapist is tasked with training a patient with the proper technique of operating an
assistive device. Equipping an assistive device with wireless inertial sensors can
facilitate the subject with remote assessment [1].
However, the proper evaluation of the learned usage of an assistive device, such
as a cane, can be greatly improved beyond the scope of a mere appointment.
A wireless accelerometer platform, such as enabled by a portable media device,
may provide useful insight regarding appropriate use of the assistive device. Such
an amalgamation is particularly relevant to a person’s use of the cane in a familiar
homebound setting [1].
Preliminary attempts regarding wireless applications for transmitting sensor data
to platforms, such as a personal computer for post-processing, is the SmartCane.
The device is equipped with pressure sensors, accelerometers, and gyroscopes.
A classiﬁcation algorithm can generate feedback, such as through an audio tone,
with respect to appropriateness of cane usage [9–11]. Another extension of the
SmartCane is the SmartFall, which is designed to ascertain fall scenarios [12].
An advantage of amalgamating the portable media device with a cane relative to
previous applications, such as the SmartCane, is the observation that the portable
media device is effectively ubiquitous. With local connectivity to a wireless Internet
zone, the recorded signals can be conveyed as email attachments for pending
post-processing and machine learning classiﬁcation [1]. This capability represents a
preliminary vantage of Network Centric Therapy with respect to the capability to
evaluate a patient’s assistive device usage.
By attaching a portable media device as a functional wireless accelerometer
platform to a cane, a patient’s usage of the assistive device can be monitored and
quantiﬁed in a relevant environment for a protracted duration. For preliminary
engineering proof of concept the portable media device was secured by adhesive
proximal to the bend of the cane as illustrated in Fig. 10.1. In order to function as a
wireless accelerometer platform the portable media device was connected to a local
wireless Internet zone [1].
For testing and evaluation from an engineering proof of concept perspective the
subject traversed a sidewalk. Two classes of experimental data were applied to the
endeavor: appropriate cane usage and inappropriate cane usage. Automated
post-processing of the accelerometer signal data resulted in a feature set for
machine learning classiﬁcation. Given the nature of the machine learning classiﬁ-
cation task, logistic regression was selected as the most appropriate machine

learning platform. Considerable classiﬁcation accuracy was attained for distin-
guishing between appropriate and inappropriate can usage [1].
Near term future extrapolation of this successful engineering proof of concept
perspective envisions the integration of previous success for gait rehabilitation
biofeedback. Virtual Proprioception was originally envisioned for real-time modi-
ﬁcation of gait strategy based on predetermined acceleration thresholds [13, 14]. An
extrapolation of Virtual Proprioception would be for establishing an appropriate
maximal threshold and minimal threshold for appropriate use of an assistive device,
such as a cane. It is envisioned that a portable media device could readily to satisfy
the requirements for emulating Virtual Proprioception for a cane, or other suitable
assistive device. With a history of usage for an instrumented assistive device a
database of patient history could be developed, which could determine transition to
another more suitable assistive device throughout the rehabilitation process.

10.3
Smartphone Wireless Gyroscope Platform for Ankle
Rehabilitation
The ankle-foot complex serves a major role for the overall quality of mobility for a
subject. For example, the ankle-foot complex generates substantial motive power
for the gait cycle, such as through powered plantar ﬂexion about stance phase of
gait. Also, during the swing phase of gait efﬁcacious dorsiﬂexion serves consid-
erably for the avoidance of toe strike and potential stumbling while walking [15,
16]. Intuitively the state of the ankle-foot complex regarding the state of rehabili-
tation substantially impacts quality of life.
In particular the weakness of the tibialis anterior musculature for dorsiﬂexion
can lead to abnormal compensatory gait strategies, such a circumduction during
swing phase, due to foot drop. Circumduction involves a leg trajectory that diverges
from the sagittal plane of standard healthy gait. Another adverse strategy involves
foot slap during the initial aspect of stance phase of gait, which correlates with
ampliﬁed loads to the respective leg [13, 15–19]. Therapy interventions using
conventional techniques have successfully improved ankle dorsiﬂexion strength
[20–22]. The quality of hemiplegic gait has been improved with rehabilitation
techniques for advancing ankle dorsiﬂexion functionality [23, 24].
During 2015 LeMoyne et al. presented a fundamental advance with respective
telepresence of therapy for which a therapist and subject could be interconnected
through the Internet. The efﬁcacy of therapy could be quantiﬁed by a wireless
gyroscope platform from a smartphone. Furthermore, the ankle rehabilitation sys-
tem was predominantly the result of 3D printing, for which the therapy device could
be produced anywhere in the world for a subject and the respective therapist.
A representative illustration of the ankle rehabilitation system is provided in
Fig. 10.2 [2].
Preliminary demonstration of the ankle rehabilitation system involves a hemi-
plegic subject using the device for both the hemiplegic affected ankle and

unaffected ankle. The subject would dorsiﬂex the ankle while mounted to the device
providing a series of recordings of a gyroscope signal from a smartphone. The data
package would be transmitted as an email package by connectivity to the Internet.
Automated post-processing would develop a feature set to discern between the
affected ankle and unaffected ankle. With the implementation of a support vector
machine considerable machine learning classiﬁcation was achieved [2].
The ankle rehabilitation system offers a perspective regarding future applications
for Network Centric Therapy. With the therapy data sample stored on a secure
Internet resource, the therapy regiment can be post-processed to a machine learning
feature set. A suitable machine learning algorithm could then be applied to identify
classiﬁcation accuracy with respect to states of progressive rehabilitation. With this
augmented acuity a therapist could prescribe an suitable upgrade to a therapy
prescription or modiﬁcation of strategy. As established in previous chapters all of
these endeavors could occur with the therapist and patient on the order of thousands
of miles remote, or even opposite sides of the globe.
10.4
Portable Media Device Wireless Gyroscope Platform
for a Wobble Board
A portable media device mounted to a wobble board could provide quantiﬁcation
regarding the status of rehabilitation for the ankle-foot complex. Figure 10.3
demonstrated the application of the wobble board mounted with a portable media
device functioning as a wireless gyroscope application [3]. The wobble board
therapy provides an effective approach for restoring functionality of the ankle-foot
complex [25–28]. A hemiplegic affected ankle was compared to an unaffected ankle
using the wobble board functioning as a wireless gyroscope platform. The gyro-
scope signal data was distilled into a feature set for machine learning classiﬁcation
using a multilayer perceptron neural network. Considerable classiﬁcation accuracy
was achieved for differentiating between the hemiplegic affected ankle and unaf-
fected ankle [3].
10.5
Virtual Proprioception for Eccentric Training
Eccentric training offers a unique and effective strength training strategy [29–35].
However, an issue with eccentric training is the implied need for an effective
feedback to assure that the strength training endeavor is truly eccentric in nature.
Virtual Proprioception offers an inertial sensor derived feedback that is relevant for
eccentric training [4]. Virtual Proprioception has been successfully demonstrated
for real-time modiﬁcation of gait strategy [13, 14]. The smartphone as a wireless
gyroscope platform can be mounted through an armband proximal to the wrist joint
as presented in Fig. 10.4. The gyroscope signal can provide real-time visual
feedback to assure that a prescribed threshold is not exceeded [4].

Figure 10.5 demonstrates a subject conducting the eccentric phase of a biceps
curl using Virtual Proprioception for eccentric training. Figure 10.6 contrasts the
gyroscope signal of the eccentric phase of a biceps curl while not using Virtual
Proprioception for eccentric training. The visually disparate gyroscope signal data

can be consolidated into a feature set. Figure 10.7 illustrates a multilayer perceptron
neural network for achieving considerable classiﬁcation accuracy for distinguishing
between the scenarios involving the biceps curl using Virtual Proprioception for
eccentric training and biceps curl while not using Virtual Proprioception for
eccentric training [4].
10.6
Network Centric Therapy for Homebound Therapy
with Wearable and Wireless Systems
One problem regarding the quality of therapy is the observation that a subject attends
an appointment representing a brief temporal snapshot of rehabilitation status and
receives expert evaluation and feedback from the therapist, which is inherently
subjective. However, depending on the availability of resources and logistics of
establishing an appointment, a series of therapy prescriptions could literally be
protracted over the span of multiple weeks. In the meantime the therapist and subject
are essentially disconnected. The therapist has no information regarding the
Fig. 10.5 Gyroscope signal for biceps curl using Virtual Proprioception for eccentric training [4]
128
10

conformance to the scheduled rehabilitation plan. The subject does not receive
feedback with respect to the quality of therapy activity. More important during the
gap between scheduled therapy meetings, the intrinsic and progressively incremen-
tally evidence of quantiﬁed improvement in response to the therapy is not apparent.
The smartphone and portable media device constitute wearable and wireless
accelerometer and gyroscope platforms for quantifying homebound therapy through
an assortment of scenarios. The data package from the inertial sensor recording can
be transmitted wirelessly through connectivity to the Internet as an email attach-
ment for post-processing. In the context of Network Centric Therapy a patient and
therapist would be accessible through the Internet to engage in a highly proactive
form of rehabilitation therapy.
The future implication of wearable and wireless sensors such as a smartphone
and portable media device functioning as a wireless gyroscope platform are con-
siderable, especially with the diagnostic capability of machine learning. A therapy
regiment can be prescribed and quantiﬁed feedback can be provided by a wireless
inertial sensor platform. The wireless inertial sensor platform could be enabled by a
smartphone, portable media device with access to the Internet. Another alternative
would be to utilize an inertial sensor platform that conveys its data package by
Fig. 10.6 Gyroscope signal for conventional biceps curl without feedback from Virtual
Proprioception for eccentric training [4]

Bluetooth wireless connectivity to a local tablet for eventual transmission to the
Internet. This conﬁguration could be relevant to all four presented homebound
therapy applications in the context of Network Centric Therapy.

Conclusion
Wearable and wireless systems in the form of smartphones and portable media
devices are presented for the role of quantifying homebound therapy. An emphasis
is placed on the topic of rehabilitation for persons with hemiparesis derived from
stroke and traumatic brain injury. Four device scenarios are presented. A portable
media device performing the role of a wireless accelerometer platform is mounted
to a cane to evaluate correct and incorrect usage. A smartphone functioning as a
wireless gyroscope platform distinguished between a hemiplegic affected ankle and
unaffected ankle for an ankle rehabilitation system. Using a wobble board mounted
with a portable media device as a wireless gyroscope platform differentiation
between a hemiplegic affected ankle and unaffected ankle was attained. Eccentric
training with respect to a standard biceps curl was distinguished for scenarios of
using Virtual Proprioception as a feedback for eccentric training contrasted to
without Virtual Proprioception feedback for eccentric training. All four scenarios
achieved considerable classiﬁcation accuracy through the application of an

assortment of machine learning algorithms. These applications demonstrate the
considerable level of possible patient therapy interaction from the perspective of a
homebound setting for the growing presence of Network Centric Therapy.

Future Perspective of Network Centric
Therapy
Abstract The previous ten chapters demonstrate the vast utility of wearable and
wireless systems for the quantiﬁcation of reﬂex and gait. These evolutionary trends
are envisioned to facilitate the development of Network Centric Therapy.
A perspective from the authors on the role of Network Centric Therapy and
associated opportunities is brieﬂy presented.

With the role of wearable and wireless systems for the quantiﬁcation of reﬂex and
gait thoroughly covered over the course of the previous ten chapters, the authors
would like to brieﬂy discuss the capabilities of Network Centric Therapy with
associated forecasts. As wearable and wireless system for the domain of rehabili-
tation becomes more actively connected to the Internet, in essence wearable and
wireless systems become in effect a representation of the Internet of Things for
therapy and rehabilitation. This development provides considerable opportunity for
radically advancing the therapy and rehabilitation experience.
One of the notable synergies is the presence of data science for Network Centric
Therapy. Rather than a singular patient to therapist relationship for the optimization
of the rehabilitation pathway, millions of similarly diagnosed patients, such as for
brain injury and stroke related motor symptoms like hemiparesis, would be inter-
connected with their therapy progress and response linked to a common Cloud
Computing data resource. The concept may considerably accelerate the pathway
toward recovery, as therapists would be able to evaluate the efﬁcacy of therapy
strategy from a data science perspective.
Furthermore, machine learning can augment a subject speciﬁc rehabilitation
experience. Even a skilled therapist may be challenged on identifying the transi-
tional junctions for the progressive advances in the therapy pathway. Topics such as
exercise dosage intensity and increase in challenge of therapy strategy are topics of
challenge even for the more advanced clinician. Machine learning may likely bridge

this junction in a temporally optimized manner, such as the objective classiﬁcation
of diagnosis and prognostic extrapolation of the rehabilitation process.
The efﬁcacy of the therapy prescription can be readily assessed using wearable
and wireless systems for quantifying the application of therapy exercise. The sensor
quantiﬁed data can provide the therapist with effectively real-time interaction with a
patient. Since the data is stored in a Network Centric Therapy derived Cloud
Computing resource, therapists with the appropriate post-processing resources can
utilize data science techniques for the historical trends of the rehabilitation cycle.
The interactive nature of Network Centric Therapy is envisioned to provide
enhanced capability for the therapy process. Furthermore the most skilled therapists
can be assembled into a team regardless of location to supervise a multitude of
patients anywhere in the world. A therapy team assembled from clinicians in
Seattle, Washington; New York, New York; and Los Angeles, California could
provide Network Centric Therapy to a disabled veteran from remote Arizona
undergoing rehabilitation to restore gait quality. Much like the past ten years have
see a phenomenal rise in the presence of wearable and wireless systems for
biomedical applications, the exponential growth of Network Centric Therapy is
envisioned to transform the rehabilitation experience.
