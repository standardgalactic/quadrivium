 
Lab: Port Scanning Using Nmap 
Purpose 
In this lab, we are going to use Nmap to perform network discovery and port scans including 
scanning a range of IPs, specific ports, fingerprinting Operating Systems and discovering IPs. 
 
Common Nmap Commands 
 
Purpose 
Command 
Scan 1000 common ports for a single IP 
nmap 192.168.1.1 
Scan 1000 common ports for subnet 
nmap 192.168.1.1/24 
Scan ALL ports for a single IP 
nmap -p- 192.168.1.1 
Scan ALL ports for a range of IPs 
nmap -p- 192.168.1.1-99 
Scan a range of ports for a single IP 
nmap -p 80-100 192.168.1.1 
Scan a single port for a single IP 
nmap -p 80 192.168.1.1 
Fingerprint the OS for a single IP 
nmap -O 192.168.1.1 
Discover all IPs (hosts) in a subnet 
nmap -sP 192.168.1.1 
 
Scan 1000 Common Ports of Your Own System 
nmap localhost 
 
Scan ALL Ports  
nmap -p- localhost 
 
Scan Port 80  
nmap -p 80 localhost 
 
Fingerprint the Operating System 
nmap -O localhost 
 
Fingerprint the Operating System 
First, you need to find out the IP address of the Ethernet Card that the VMWare 
machine is using, so issue the following command:   ifconfig 
 
 
nmap -sP 10.0.2.15 
 
Task:  
- Scan the port range 60 – 120 for your local machine 
- Investigate if Telnet is running on your local machine (assume that you scan only a SINGLE port) 
 
(Solution on Next Page) 

 
 
Solution:  
- Issue the command to scan port range 60 – 120 for your local machine 
 
 nmap -p 60-120 localhost 
 
- Issue the command to find if Telnet is running on your local machine (scan only a SINGLE port) 
 
 nmap -p 23 localhost
