Ron insulated between the rafters
and installed a workshop/garage
heater in his workshop, but the
concrete slab still remained really
cold. Ron decided to install a new
insulated floor system, as well.
The first step is to clear everything
out and sweep the floor clean.
The sub-flooring material Ron 
used is a product called DRIcore. 
This is an engineered wood 
product made up of wood chips or 
flakes that are compressed under 
high pressure using waterproof 
glue. On the back side of each 
panel is a polyethylene moisture 
barrier.  
 
When using this product, it is important to bring it inside at least 24 
hours before installation. This will allow the material to acclimate to 
both the temperature and the humidity in the room.  
The sub floor comes in two-foot 
squares that interlock with each
other using tongue in groove 
joinery. Glue is not used in this
floor system.
This is called a floating floor 
system, which means it is not 
attached to the concrete 
underneath, but instead sits or 
floats on top. This entire floor 
expands and contract with 
changes in humidity and 
temperature, which means you 
need to use spacers around the 
edges of the floor to create a 
quarter inch gap. When the floor 
installation is complete, the 
spacers can be removed so that 
the gap enables the floor to move 
as it needs to.  
After each tile is set in place, set a
tapping block on the edge of the
panel and tap it gently with a
hammer to secure the joint firmly
together.

 
If your existing floor is uneven, 
use a straight edge to locate the 
low spots, which will create a gap 
underneath the straight edge.  
The floor panels are easily
adaptable to these irregularities
with simple shims that are
designed to fit over the molded
panel bottoms. If necessary, you
can stack up to four of these on
top of each other. Masking tape
helps hold the shims in place
when you flip the panels over.
When you come to the end of 
your first row, you will probably 
need a piece smaller than a full 
panel to fill the remaining space. 
Simply measure the space, set 
your table saw fence to the 
required dimension, and then 
make the cut. A hand held circular 
saw or jigsaw can also be used to 
make these simple cuts. 
  
The cut piece drops into place,
but you will not be able to use a
hammer and tapping block to
tighten up the joint. Instead, use a
tool called a pinch bar, which slips
into the gap next to the wall and
hooks over the edge of the panel.
The opposite end is bent upward
to form a striking surface. A few
hammer blows brings the joints 
tightly together. Begin the second
row by staggering the joints so
that they fall directly in the center
of the boards of the first row.
Staggering the rows in this way
creates a much more stable floor.
When working in a doorway, you 
will need to notch out a panel to fit 
around the corner.  

The easiest way to do this is to
set the panel in place and then
use a straight edge or square to
extend the wall lines onto the
board. 
A jigsaw makes cutting out the 
notch quick and simple.  
Not only does this floor go in
quickly and easily, but it also
looks good. It is an ideal sub-floor 
for wood, carpet, vinyl or laminate.
Because Ron was installing his 
floor in a garage and workshop he 
decided on something called the 
G-floor from Better Life 
Technologies for his floor surface. 
This garage floor covering comes 
in nine-foot widths and simply rolls 
out, but it lies perfectly flat and 
stays in place without the need for 
adhesive. 
In just a couple of minutes, this
material transforms the look and
feel of the entire floor.
To trim the edges, use either a
hook shaped utility knife blade, or
a pair of scissors. Simply cut the
floor to fit as you work your way
around the edge of the room. To
hold the seams tightly together,
apply double stick carpet tape to
the back of the floor.
Carefully remove the protective liner from only one side, because 
you want the tape to stick only to the covering and not to the 
underlayment. This leaves the floor covering free to expand and 
contract with changes in temperature and humidity. 

Remove any bubbles or ripples 
with a push broom, working from 
the center to the edges. This new 
flooring is tough, durable and 
good looking. If you ever plan to 
park a car on this surface, it is 
resistant to oil and gasoline. 
The floor is not attached to
anything, so you can easily
remove it if you ever need to.
Although this new floor covering is
only about an inch thick, it still
offers a pretty good insulation
value, which can make any
workspace much more
comfortable.
