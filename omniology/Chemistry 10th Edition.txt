‚ùØ In Chapter 3 the treatment of stoichiometry has been en-
hanced by a discussion of ‚ÄúBCA‚Äù (Before-Change-After) 
tables, which allow another method by which students can 
conceptually understand the role coefficients play in a bal-
anced chemical reaction. Students are shown three meth-
ods to select a limiting reactant: comparing the amounts of 
reactant present, calculating the amounts of products that 
can be formed by complete consumption of each reactant, 
and using a BCA table.
‚ùØ In Chapter 4 we expanded Section 4.10 to include the half-
reaction method for balancing complex oxidation‚Äìreduction 
reactions. This change was made to better support typical 
laboratory programs.
‚ùØ New end-of-chapter questions and problems have been 
added throughout the text.
‚ùØ The art program has been modified and updated as needed, 
and new macro/micro illustrations have been added.
Hallmarks of Chemistry
‚ùØ Chemistry contains numerous discussions, illustrations, 
and exercises aimed at overcoming misconceptions. It has 
become increasingly clear from our own teaching experi-
ence that students often struggle with chemistry because 
they misunderstand many of the fundamental concepts. In 
this text, we have gone to great lengths to provide illustra-
tions and  explanations aimed at giving students a more ac-
curate picture of the fundamental ideas of chemistry. In 
particular, we have attempted to represent the microscopic 
world of chemistry so that students have a picture in their 
minds of ‚Äúwhat the atoms and molecules are doing.‚Äù The 
art program along with the animations emphasize this goal. 
We have also placed a larger emphasis on the qualitative 
understanding of concepts before quantitative problems are 
considered. Because using an algorithm to correctly solve 
a problem often masks misunderstanding‚Äîwhen students 
assume they understand the material because they got the 
right ‚Äúanswer‚Äù‚Äîit is important to probe their understand-
ing in other ways. In this vein, the text includes many Criti-
cal Thinking questions throughout the text and a number of 
Active Learning Questions at the end of each chapter that 
are intended for group discussion. It is our experience that 
students often learn the most when they teach each other. 
Students are forced to recognize their own lack of under-
standing when they try and fail to explain a concept to an-
other student.
Features of Chemistry,  
Tenth Edition
Conceptual learning and problem solving are fundamental 
to the approach of Chemistry. Our philosophy is to help 
students learn to think like chemists so that they can apply 
the process of problem solving to all aspects of their lives. 
We give students the tools to become critical thinkers: to ask 
questions, to apply rules and models, and to evaluate the 
outcome. It was also our mission to create a media program 
that embodies this philosophy so that when instructors and 
students look online for either study aids or online home-
work, each resource supports the goals of the textbook‚Äîa 
strong emphasis on models, real-world applications, and 
visual learning.
What‚Äôs New
We have made extensive updates to the Tenth Edition to en-
hance the learning experience for students. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs 
new:
‚ùØ We have added three new Sections to the text:
‚ùØ 4.11: Simple Oxidation‚ÄìReduction Titrations
‚ùØ 15.6: Polyprotic Acid Titrations
‚ùØ 17.5: Entropy Changes in Aqueous Ionic Solutions
‚ùØ We have added several new subsections throughout the 
text:
‚ùØ The Process of Heat (in Section 6.1)
‚ùØ Photoelectron Spectroscopy for Atoms (in 
Section¬†7.12)
‚ùØ Photoelectron Spectroscopy for Molecules (in 
Section¬†9.3)
‚ùØ Distinguishing Between Chemical and Physical 
Changes at the Molecular Level (in Section 10.1)
‚ùØ Forces Between Polar and Nonpolar Molecules (in 
Section 10.1)
‚ùØ Chromatography (in Section 11.2)
‚ùØ Mechanisms with Fast Forward and Reverse First 
Steps (in Section 12.5)
‚ùØ Acid Catalysis (in Section 12.7)
‚ùØ Nonspontaneous Reactions (in Section 17.7)

To the Professor
‚ùØ  With a strong problem-solving orientation, this text talks to 
students about how to approach and solve chemical prob-
lems. We emphasize a thoughtful, logical approach rather 
than simply memorizing procedures. In particular, an in-
novative method is given for dealing with acid‚Äìbase equi-
libria, the material the typical student finds most difficult 
and frustrating. The key to this approach involves first de-
ciding what species are present in solution, then thinking 
about the chemical properties of these species. This method 
provides a general framework for approaching all types of 
solution equilibria.
‚ùØ  The text contains almost 300 Examples, with more given in 
the text discussions, to illustrate general problem-solving 
strategies. When a specific strategy is presented, it is sum-
marized in a Problem-Solving Strategy box, and the Exam-
ple that follows it reinforces the use of the strategy to solve 
the problem. In general, we emphasize the use of conceptual 
understanding to solve problems rather than an algorithm-
based approach. This approach is strongly reinforced by the 
inclusion of many Interactive Examples, which encourage 
students to thoughtfully consider the example step-by-step.
‚ùØ  We have presented a thorough treatment of reactions that 
 occur in solution, including acid‚Äìbase reactions. This ma-
terial appears in Chapter 4, ‚ÄúTypes of Chemical Reactions 
and Solution Stoichiometry,‚Äù directly after the chapter on 
chemical stoichiometry, to emphasize the connection be-
tween solution reactions and chemical reactions in general. 
The early presentation of this material provides an oppor-
tunity to cover some interesting descriptive chemistry and 
also supports the lab, which typically involves a great deal 
of aqueous chemistry. Chapter 4 also includes oxidation‚Äì
reduction reactions and balancing by oxidation state, be-
cause a large number of interesting and important chemical 
reactions involve redox processes. However, coverage of 
oxidation‚Äìreduction is optional at this point and depends 
on the needs of a specific course.
‚ùØ  Descriptive chemistry and chemical principles are thor-
oughly integrated in this text. Chemical models may ap-
pear sterile and confusing without the observations that 
stimulated their invention. On the other hand, facts without 
organizing principles may seem overwhelming. A combi-
nation of observation and models can make chemistry both 
interesting and understandable. In the chapter on the chem-
istry of the elements, we have used tables and charts to 
show how properties and models correlate. Descriptive 
chemistry is presented in a variety of ways‚Äîas applica-
tions of principles in separate sections, in photographs, in 
Examples and exercises, in paragraphs, and in Chemical 
Connections.
‚ùØ  Throughout the book a strong emphasis on models pre-
vails. Coverage includes how they are constructed, how 
they are tested, and what we learn when they inevitably 
fail. Models are developed naturally, with pertinent obser-
vation always presented first to show why a particular 
model was invented.
‚ùØ  Chemical Connections boxes present applications of chem-
istry in various fields and in our daily lives. Margin notes in 
the Instructor‚Äôs Annotated Edition also highlight many 
more Chemical Connections available on the student 
website.
‚ùØ  We offer end-of-chapter exercises for every type of student 
and for every kind of homework assignment: questions that 
promote group learning, exercises that reinforce student 
understanding, and problems that present the ultimate chal-
lenge with increased rigor and by integrating multiple con-
cepts. We have added biochemistry problems to make the 
connection for students in the course who are not chemis-
try majors.
‚ùØ  Judging from the favorable comments of instructors and 
students who have used the ninth edition, the text seems to 
work very well in a variety of courses. We were especially 
pleased that readability was cited as a key strength when 
students were asked to assess the text.

As you jump into the study of chemistry, we hope that you 
will find our text helpful and interesting. Our job is to present 
the concepts and ideas of chemistry in a way you can under-
stand. We hope to encourage you in your studies and to help 
you learn to solve problems in ways you can apply in all areas 
of your professional and personal lives.
Our main goal is to help you learn to become a truly 
creative problem solver. Our world badly needs people who 
can ‚Äúthink outside the box.‚Äù Our focus is to help you learn to 
think like a chemist. Why would you want to do that? Chem-
ists are great problem solvers. They use logic, trial and error, 
and intuition‚Äîalong with lots of patience‚Äîto work through 
complex problems. Chemists make mistakes, as we all do in 
our lives. The important thing that a chemist does is to learn 
from the mistakes and to try again. This ‚Äúcan do‚Äù attitude is 
useful in all  careers.
In this book we develop the concepts in a natural way: 
The observations come first and then we develop models to 
explain the observed behavior. Models help us to understand 
and explain our world. They are central to scientific thinking. 
Models are very useful, but they also have limitations, which 
we will point out. By understanding the basic concepts in 
chemistry we lay the foundation for solving problems.
Our main goal is to help you learn a thoughtful method of 
problem solving. True learning is more than memorizing facts. 
Truly educated people use their factual knowledge as a starting 
point‚Äîa basis for creative problem solving. Our strategy for 
solving problems is explained first in Section 1.6 and is cov-
ered in more details in Section 3.5. To solve a problem we ask 
ourselves questions, which help us think through the problem. 
We let the problem guide us to the solution. This process can 
be applied to all types of problems in all areas of life.
As you study the text, use the Examples and the problem-
solving strategies to help you. The strategies are boxed to 
highlight them for you, and the Examples show how these 
strategies are applied. It is especially important for you to 
do the computer-based Interactive Examples that are found 
throughout the text. These examples encourage you to think 
through the examples step-by-step to help you thoroughly un-
derstand the concepts involved.
After you have read and studied each chapter of the 
text, you‚Äôll need to practice your problem-solving skills. To 
do this we have provided plenty of review questions and 
end-of- chapter exercises. Your instructor may assign these 
on  paper or online; in either case, you‚Äôll want to work with 
your fellow students. One of the most effective ways to 
learn chemistry is through the exchange of ideas that comes 
from helping one another. The online homework assign-
ments will give you instant feedback, and in print, we have 
provided  answers to some of the exercises in the back of 
the text. In all cases, your main goal is not just to get the 
correct answer but to understand the process for getting the 
answer. Memorizing solutions for specific problems is not 
a very good way to prepare for an exam (or to solve prob-
lems in the real world!).
To become a great problem solver, you‚Äôll need these 
skills:
1. Look within the problem for the solution. (Let the prob-
lem guide you.)
2. Use the concepts you have learned along with a system-
atic, logical approach to find the solution.
3. Solve the problem by asking questions and learn to trust 
yourself to think it out.
You will make mistakes, but the important thing is to learn 
from these errors. The only way to gain confidence is to prac-
tice, practice, practice and to use your mistakes to find your 
weaknesses. Be patient with yourself and work hard to under-
stand rather than simply memorize.
We hope you‚Äôll have an interesting and successful year 
learning to think like a chemist!

8.13 Molecular Structure: 
The VSEPR Model
The structures of molecules play a very important role in determining their chemical 
properties. As we will see later, this is particularly important for biological molecules; 
a slight change in the structure of a large biomolecule can completely destroy its use-
fulness to a cell or may even change the cell from a normal one to a cancerous one.

The authors‚Äô emphasis on modeling (or chemical theories) 
throughout the text addresses the problem of rote memorization by 
helping students better understand and appreciate the process of 
scientific thinking. By stressing the limitations and uses of scientific 
models, the authors show students how chemists think and work.
Active Learning Questions
These questions are designed to be used by groups of students in class.
 1. Consider the following apparatus: 
a test tube covered with a nonper-
meable elastic membrane inside a 
container that is closed with a cork. 
A syringe goes through the cork.
a. As you push down on the 
syringe, how does the 
membrane covering  
the test tube change?
b. You stop pushing the 
syringe but continue to 
hold it down. In a few 
seconds, what happens 
to the membrane? 
Syringe

 2. Figure 5.2 shows a picture of a barometer. Which of the fol-
lowing statements is the best explanation of how this barom-
eter works?
a. Air pressure outside the tube causes the mercury to move 
in the tube until the air pressure inside and outside the 
tube is equal.
b. Air pressure inside the tube causes the mercury to move 
in the tube until the air pressure inside and outside the 
tube is equal.
c. Air pressure outside the tube counterbalances the weight 
of the mercury in the tube.
d. Capillary action of the mercury causes the mercury to go 
up the tube.
e. The vacuum that is formed at the top of the tube holds up 
the mercury.
‚ÄúBefore students are ready to figure out complex problems, they 
need to master simpler problems in various contortions. This 
approach works, and the authors‚Äô presentation of it should have the 
students buying in.‚Äù
‚ÄîJERRY BURNS,  Pellissippi State Technical Community College
The text includes a number of open-ended Critical Thinking 
questions that emphasize the importance of conceptual learning. These 
questions are particularly useful for generating group discussion.
CRITICAL THINKING Consider the simple reaction  
aA n products. You run this reaction and wish to determine its order. What if 
you made a graph of reaction rate versus time? Could you use this to determine 
the order? Sketch three plots of rate versus time for the reaction if it is zero, 
first, or second order. Sketch these plots on the same graph and compare them. 
Defend your answer.
Let‚Äôs Review boxes help students organize their thinking 
about the crucial chemical concepts that they encounter.
LET‚ÄôS REVIEW  Summary of the VSEPR Model
The rules for using the VSEPR model to predict molecular structure are as follows:
 ¬ª Determine the Lewis structure(s) for the molecule.
 ¬ª For molecules with resonance structures, use any of the structures to predict the 
molecular structure.
 ¬ª Sum the electron pairs around the central atom.
 ¬ª In counting pairs, count each multiple bond as a single effective pair.
 ¬ª The arrangement of the pairs is determined by minimizing electron-pair repulsions. These 
arrangements are shown in Table 8.7.
 ¬ª Lone pairs require more space than bonding pairs do. Choose an arrangement that gives 
the lone pairs as much room as possible. Recognize that the lone pairs may produce a slight 
distortion of the structure at angles less than 120 degrees.
The text includes a number of Active Learning Questions
at the end of each chapter that are intended for group discussion, 
since students often learn the most when they teach each other.
A GUIDE TO Chemistry, TENTH EDITION 
Conceptual Understanding Conceptual learning and problem solving are 
fundamental to the approach of Chemistry. The text gives students the tools to 
become critical thinkers: to ask questions, to apply rules and models, and to evalu-
ate the outcome.

Problem Solving This text talks to the student about how to approach and 
solve chemical problems, since one of the main goals of general chemistry is to 
help students become creative problem solvers. The authors emphasize a thought-
ful, logical approach rather than simply memorizing procedures.
‚ÄúThe text gives a meaningful explanation and alternative to memorization. This 
approach and the explanation [to the student] of the approach will supply the 
‚Äòsecret‚Äô of successful problem solving abilities to all students.‚Äù
‚ÄîDAVID BOYAJIAN, Palomar College
In Chapter 3, ‚ÄúStoichiometry,‚Äù the authors introduce a new section, 
Learning to Solve Problems, which emphasizes the impor-
tance of problem solving. This new section helps students understand 
that thinking their way through a problem produces more long-term, 
meaningful learning than simply memorizing steps, which are soon for-
gotten.
Problem-Solving Strategy boxes focus students‚Äô 
attention on the very important process of problem solving.
Chapters 1‚Äì6 introduce a series of questions into the in-chapter 
Examples to engage students in the process of problem solving, such 
as Where are we going? and How do we get there? This 
more active approach helps students think their way through the so-
lution to the problem.
Interactive Examples engage students in the problem-solving pro-
cess by requiring them to think through the example step-by-step rather 
than simply scanning the written example in the text as many students do.
 
3.5 Learning to Solve Problems
One of the great rewards of studying chemistry is to become a good problem solver. 
Being able to solve complex problems is a talent that will serve you well in all walks 
of life. It is our purpose in this text to help you learn to solve problems in a flexible, 
creative way based on understanding the fundamental ideas of chemistry. We call this 
approach conceptual problem solving.
 
The ultimate goal is to be able to solve new problems (that is, problems you have 
not seen before) on your own. In this text we will provide problems and offer solutions 
by explaining how to think about the problems. While the answers to these problems 
are  important, it is perhaps even more important to understand the process‚Äîthe think-
ing  necessary to get the answer. Although at first we will be solving the problem for 
you, do not take a passive role. While studying the solution, it is crucial that you inter-
actively think through the problem with us. Do not skip the discussion and jump to the 
answer. Usually, the solution will involve asking a series of questions. Make sure that 
you understand each step in the process. This active approach should apply to prob-
lems outside of chemistry as well. For example, imagine riding with someone in a car 
to an unfamiliar destination. If your goal is simply to have the other person get you to 
that destination, you will probably not pay much attention to how to get there (pas-
sive), and if you have to find this same place in the future on your own, you probably 
will not be able to do it. If, however, your goal is to learn how to get there, you would 
pay attention to distances, signs, and turns (active). This is how you should read the 
solutions in the text (and the text in general).
 
While actively studying our solutions to problems is helpful, at some point you will 
need to know how to think through these problems on your own. If we help you too 
much as you solve a problem, you won‚Äôt really learn effectively. If we always ‚Äúdrive,‚Äù 
you won‚Äôt interact as meaningfully with the material. Eventually you need to learn to 
drive yourself. We will provide more help at the beginning of the text and less as we 
proceed to later chapters.
 
There are two fundamentally different ways you might use to approach a problem. 
One way emphasizes memorization. We might call this the ‚Äúpigeonholing method.‚Äù In 
this approach, the first step is to label the problem‚Äîto decide in which pigeonhole it 
fits. The pigeonholing method requires that we provide you with a set of steps that you 
memorize and store in the appropriate slot for each different problem you encounter. 
The difficulty with this method is that it requires a new pigeonhole each time a prob-
lem is changed by even a small amount.
 
Consider the driving analogy again. Suppose you have memorized how to drive 
from your house to the grocery store. Do you know how to drive back from the grocery 
store to your house? Not necessarily. If you have only memorized the directions and 
do not  understand fundamental principles such as ‚ÄúI traveled north to get to the store, 
so my house is south of the store,‚Äù you may find yourself stranded. In a more compli-
cated  example,  suppose you know how to get from your house to the store (and back) 
and from your house to the library (and back). Can you get from the library to the store 
without having to go back home? Probably not if you have only memorized directions 
and you do not have a ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù of where your house, the store, and the library are 
relative to one  another.

PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY 
Determining Molecular Formula from Empirical Formula
 
¬ª Obtain the empirical formula.
 
¬ª Compute the mass corresponding to the empirical formula.
 
¬ª Calculate the ratio:
Molar mass
Empirical formula mass
 ¬ª The integer from the previous step represents the number of empirical formula 
units in one molecule. When the empirical formula subscripts are multiplied by 
this integer, the molecular formula results. This procedure is summarized by the 
equation:
Molecular formula 5 empirical formula 3
molar mass
empirical formula mass
Predicting Entropy Changes
Predict the sign of the entropy change for each of the following processes.
a. Solid sugar is added to water to form a solution.
b. Iodine vapor condenses on a cold surface to form crystals.
 
SOLUTION 
a. The sugar molecules become randomly dispersed in the water when the solution 
forms and thus have access to a larger volume and a larger number of possible 
positions. The positional disorder is increased, and there will be an increase in 
entropy. DS is positive, since the final state has a larger entropy than the initial 
state, and DS 5 Sfinal 2 Sinitial.
b. Gaseous iodine is forming a solid. This process involves a change from a rela-
tively large volume to a much smaller volume, which results in lower positional 
disorder. For this process DS is negative (the entropy decreases).

One interesting feature of the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales is that 2408C and 2408F 
 represent the same temperature, as shown in Fig. 1.9. Verify that this is true.

The difference between 328F and 2408F is 728F. The difference between 08C and

Real-World Applications Interesting applications of modern chemistry show 
students the relevance of chemistry to their world.
Chemical Connections describe current applications of chemistry. These special-
interest boxes cover such topics as the invention of Post-it Notes, farming the wind, 
and the use of iron metal to clean up contaminated groundwater. Additional Chemical 
Connections are available on the student website.
Each chapter begins with 
an engaging introduction 
that demonstrates how 
chemistry is related to 
everyday life.
P
ost-it Notes, a product of the 3M 
Corporation, revolutionized casual 
written communications and personal 
reminders. Introduced in the United 
States in 1980, these sticky-but-not-too-
sticky notes have now found countless 
uses in offices, cars, and homes 
throughout the world.
The invention of sticky notes 
occurred over a period of about 10 years 
and involved a great deal of serendipity. 
The adhesive for Post-it Notes was dis-
covered by Dr. Spencer F. Silver of 3M in 
1968. Silver found that when an acrylate 
polymer material was made in a particu-
lar way, it formed cross-linked micro-
spheres. When suspended in a solvent 
and sprayed on a sheet of paper, this 
substance formed a ‚Äúsparse monolayer‚Äù 
of adhesive after the solvent evaporated. 
Scanning electron microscope images of 
the adhesive show that it has an irregular 
surface, a little like the surface of a gravel 
road. In contrast, the adhesive on cello-
phane tape looks smooth and uniform, 
like a superhighway. The bumpy surface 
of Silver‚Äôs adhesive caused it to be sticky 
but not so sticky to produce permanent 
adhesion, because the number of con-
tact points between the binding sur-
faces was limited.
When he invented this adhesive, 
Silver had no specific ideas for its use, so 
he spread the word of his discovery 
to his fellow employees at 3M to 
see if anyone had an application for 
it. In addition, over the next several 
years development was carried out 
to improve the adhesive‚Äôs proper-
ties. It was not until 1974 that the 
idea for Post-it Notes popped up. 
One Sunday, Art Fry, a chemical 
engineer for 3M, was singing in his 
church choir when he became 
annoyed that the bookmark in his 
hymnal kept falling out. He 
thought to himself that it would be 
nice if the bookmark were sticky 
enough to stay in place but not so 
sticky that it couldn‚Äôt be moved. Luckily, 
he remembered Silver‚Äôs glue‚Äîand the 
Post-it Note was born.
For the next three years, Fry worked 
to overcome the manufacturing obsta-
cles associated with the product. By 
1977 enough Post-it Notes were being 
produced to supply 3M‚Äôs corporate 
headquarters, where the employees 
quickly became addicted to their many 
uses. Post-it Notes are now available in 
62 colors and 25 shapes.
In the years since the introduction of 
Post-it Notes, 3M has heard some 
remarkable stories connected to the use 
of these notes. For example, a Post-it 
Note was applied to the nose of a 
corporate jet, where it was intended to 
be read by the plane‚Äôs Las Vegas ground 
crew. Someone forgot to remove it, 
however. The note was still on the nose 
of the plane when it landed in Minne-
apolis, having survived a takeoff, a land-
ing, and speeds of 500 miles per hour at 
temperatures as low as 2568F. Stories on 
the 3M website describe how a Post-it 
Note on the front door of a home sur-
vived the 140-mile-per-hour winds of 
Hurricane Hugo and how a foreign 
official accepted Post-it Notes in lieu of 
cash when a small bribe was needed to 
cut through bureaucratic hassles.
Post-it Notes have definitely 
changed the way we communicate and 
remember things.

n the Midwest the wind blows across 
fields of corn, soybeans, wheat, and 
wind  turbines‚Äîwind turbines? It turns 
out that the wind that seems to blow 
almost continuously across the plains is 
now becoming the latest cash crop. 
One of these new-breed wind farmers 
is Daniel Juhl, who recently erected 
17¬†wind turbines on six acres of land 
near Woodstock, Minnesota. These 
turbines can generate as much as 
10¬†megawatts (MW) of electricity, which 
Juhl sells to the local electrical utility.
There is plenty of untapped wind 
power in the United States. Wind map-
pers rate regions on a scale of  
1 to 6 (with 6 being the best) to indicate 
the quality of the wind resource. Wind 
farms are now being developed in 
areas rated from 4 to 6. The farmers 
who own the land welcome the 
increased income derived from the 
wind blowing across their land. Econo-
mists estimate that each acre devoted 
to wind turbines can pay royalties to 
the farmers of as much as $8000 per 
year, or many times the revenue from 
growing corn on that same land. Juhl 
claims that farmers who construct the 
turbines themselves can realize as 
much as $20,000 per year per turbine. 
Globally, wind generation of electricity 
has nearly quadrupled in the last five 
years and is expected to increase by 
about 60% per year in the United 
States. The economic feasibility of wind- 
generated electricity has greatly 
improved in the past 30 years as the 
wind  turbines have become more 
efficient. Today‚Äôs turbines can produce 
electricity that costs about the same as 
that from other sources. The most 
impressive thing about wind power is 
the magnitude of the supply. Accord-
ing to the American Wind Energy Asso-
ciation in Washington, D.C., the 
wind-power potential in the United 
States is comparable or larger than the 
energy resources under the sands of 
Saudi Arabia.
The biggest hurdle that must be 
overcome before wind power can 
become a significant electricity producer 
in the United States is construction of 
the transmission  infrastructure‚Äî the 
power lines needed to move the electric-
ity from the rural areas to the cities 
where most of the power is used. For 
example, the hundreds of turbines 
planned in southwest Minnesota in a 
development called Buffalo Ridge could 
supply enough electricity to power 
1¬†million homes if transmission problems 
can be solved.
Another possible scenario for wind 
farms is to use the electrical power 
generated to decompose water to 
produce hydrogen gas that could be 
carried to cities by pipelines and used 
as a fuel. One real benefit of hydrogen 
is that it produces water as its only 
combustion product. Thus, it is essen-
tially pollution-free.
Within a few years, wind power 
could be a major source of electric-
ity. There could be a fresh wind 
blowing across the energy land-
scape of the United States in the 
near future.

n doing stoichiometry calculations we assumed that reactions proceed to comple-
tion, that is, until one of the reactants runs out. Many reactions do proceed essen-
tially to completion. For such reactions it can be assumed that the reactants are 
quantitatively converted to products and that the amount of limiting reactant that 
remains is negligible. On the other hand, there are many chemical reactions that stop 
far short of completion. An example is the dimerization of nitrogen dioxide:
NO21 g2 1 NO21 g2 h N2O41 g2
The reactant, NO2, is a dark brown gas, and the product, N2O4, is a colorless gas. 
When NO2 is placed in an evacuated, sealed glass vessel at 258C, the initial dark brown 
color decreases in intensity as it is converted to colorless N2O4. However, even over a 
long period of time, the contents of the reaction vessel do not become colorless. 
Instead, the intensity of the brown color eventually becomes constant, which means 
that the concentration of NO2 is no longer changing. This is illustrated on the molecu-
lar level in Fig. 13.1. This  observation is a clear indication that the reaction has stopped 
short of completion. In fact, the system has reached chemical equilibrium, the state 
where the concentrations of all reactants and products remain constant with time.
Any chemical reactions carried out in a closed vessel will reach equilibrium. For 
some reactions the equilibrium position so favors the products that the reaction appears 
to have gone to completion. We say that the equilibrium position for such reactions lies 
far to the right (in the direction of the products). For example, when gaseous hydrogen 
and oxygen are mixed in stoichiometric quantities and react to form water vapor, the 
reaction proceeds essentially to completion. The amounts of the reactants that remain 
when the system reaches equilibrium are so tiny as to be negligible. By contrast, some 
reactions occur only to a slight extent. For example, when solid CaO is placed in a 
closed vessel at 258C, the decomposition to solid Ca and gaseous O2 is virtually unde-
tectable. In cases like this, the equilibrium position is said to lie far to the left (in the 
direction of the reactants).
In this chapter we will discuss how and why a chemical system comes to equilibrium 
and the characteristics of equilibrium. In particular, we will discuss how to  calculate the 
concentrations of the reactants and products present for a given system at equilibrium.
 
13.1 The Equilibrium Condition
Since no changes occur in the concentrations of reactants or products in a reaction 
system at equilibrium, it may appear that everything has stopped. However, this is not 
the case. On the molecular level, there is frantic activity. Equilibrium is not static but 
is a highly dynamic situation. The concept of chemical equilibrium is analogous to the 
flow of cars across a bridge connecting two island cities. Suppose the traffic flow on 
the bridge is the same in both directions. It is obvious that there is motion, since one

Each chapter has a For Review section to reinforce key concepts 
and includes review questions for students to practice indepen-
dently.
Active Learning Questions are designed to promote 
discussion among groups of students in class.
Active Learning Questions
These questions are designed to be used by groups of students in 
class.
 1. Consider two beakers of pure water at different temperatures. 
How do their pH values compare? Which is more acidic? more 
basic? Explain.
 2. Differentiate between the terms strength and concentration as 
they apply to acids and bases. When is HCl strong? Weak? 
Concentrated? Dilute? Answer the same questions for ammo-
nia. Is the conjugate base of a weak acid a strong base?
 3. Sketch two graphs: (a) percent dissociation for weak acid HA 
versus the initial concentration of HA ([HA]0) and (b) H1 con-
centration versus [HA]0. Explain both.
 4. Consider a solution prepared by mixing a weak acid HA and 
HCl. What are the major species? Explain what is occurring in 
solution. How would you calculate the pH? What if you added 
NaA to this solution? Then added NaOH?
 5. Explain why salts can be acidic, basic, or neutral, and show 
examples. Do this without specific numbers.
 6. Consider two separate aqueous solutions: one of a weak acid 
HA and one of HCl. Assuming you started with 10 molecules 
of each:
a. Draw a picture of what each solution looks like at 
equilibrium.
b. What are the major species in each beaker?
c. From your pictures, calculate the Ka values of each acid.
d. Order the following from the strongest to the weakest 
base: H2O, A2, Cl2. Explain your order.
 7. You are asked to calculate the H1 concentration in a solution 
of NaOH(aq). Because sodium hydroxide is a base, can we 
say there is no H1, since having H1 would imply that the solu-
tion is acidic?
 8. Consider a solution prepared by mixing a weak acid HA, HCl, 
and NaA. Which of the following statements best describes 
what happens?
a. The H1 from the HCl reacts completely with the A2 from 
the NaA. Then the HA dissociates somewhat.
b. The H1 from the HCl reacts somewhat with the A2 from 
the NaA to make HA, while the HA is dissociating. Even-
tually you have equal amounts of everything.
c. The H1 from the HCl reacts somewhat with the A2 from 
the NaA to make HA while the HA is dissociating. Even-
tually all the reactions have equal rates.
d. The H1 from the HCl reacts completely with the A2 from 
the NaA. Then the HA dissociates somewhat until ‚Äútoo 
much‚Äù H1 and A2 are formed, so the H1 and A2 react to 
form HA, and so on. Eventually equilibrium is reached.
Justify your choice, and for choices you did not pick, explain 
what is wrong with them.
 9. Consider a solution formed by mixing 100.0 mL of 0.10 M 
HA (Ka 5 1.0 3 1026), 100.00 mL of 0.10 M NaA, and  
100.0 mL of 0.10 M HCl. In calculating the pH for the final 
solution, you would make some assumptions about the order 
in which various reactions occur to simplify the calculations. 
State these assumptions. Does it matter whether the reactions 
actually occur in the assumed order? Explain.
 10. A certain sodium compound is dissolved in water to liberate 
Na1 ions and a certain negative ion. What evidence would you 
look for to determine whether the anion is behaving as an acid 
or a base? How could you tell whether the anion is a strong 
base? Explain how the anion could behave simultaneously as 
an acid and a base.
 11. Acids and bases can be thought of as chemical opposites 
(acids are proton donors, and bases are proton acceptors). 
Therefore, one might think that Ka 5 1yKb. Why isn‚Äôt this the 
case? What is the relationship between Ka and Kb? Prove it 
with a derivation.
 12. Consider the equation:
HA(aq) 1 H2O(l) N H3O1(aq) 1 A‚Äì(aq).
a. If water is a better base than A‚Äì, which way will the equi-
librium lie?
b. If water is a better base than A‚Äì, is HA a strong or a weak 
acid?
c. If water is a better base than A‚Äì, is the value of Ka greater 
or less than 1?
 13. You mix a solution of a strong acid with a pH 5 4.0 and an 
equal volume of another strong acid solution having a pH 5 
6.0. Is the final pH less than 4.0, equal to 4.0, between 4.0 and 
5.0, equal to 5.0, between 5.0 and 6.0, equal to 6.0, or greater 
than 6.0? Explain.
 14. Consider two solutions of the salts NaX(aq) and NaY(aq) at 
equal concentrations. What would you need to know to deter-
mine which solution has the higher pH? Explain how you 
would decide (perhaps even provide a sample calculation).
 15. What is meant by pH? True or false: A strong acid solution 
 always has a lower pH than a weak acid solution. Explain.
 16. Why is the pH of water at 258C equal to 7.00?
 17. Can the pH of a solution be negative? Explain.
 18. Is the conjugate base of a weak acid a strong base? Explain. 
 Explain why Cl2 does not affect the pH of an aqueous  solution.
 19. Match the following pH values: 1, 2, 5, 6, 6.5, 8, 11, 11, and 
13 with the following chemicals (of equal concentration): 
HBr, NaOH, NaF, NaCN, NH4F, CH3NH3F, HF, HCN, and 
NH3.  Answer this question without performing calculations.
 20. The salt BX, when dissolved in water, produces an acidic solu-
tion. Which of the following could be true? (There may be 
more than one correct answer.)
a. The acid HX is a weak acid.
b. The acid HX is a strong acid.
c. The cation B1 is a weak acid.
Explain.

Buffered solutions
‚ùØ Contains a weak acid (HA) and its salt (NaA) or a weak base (B) and its salt (BHCl)
‚ùØ Resists a change in its pH when H1 or OH2 is added
‚ùØ For a buffered solution containing HA and A2
‚ùØ The Henderson‚ÄìHasselbalch equation is useful:
pH 5 pKa 1 log a 3A24
3HA4b
‚ùØ The capacity of the buffered solution depends on the amounts of HA and A2 present
‚ùØ The most efficient buffering occurs when the 3A24
3HA4 ratio is close to 1
‚ùØ Buffering works because the amounts of HA (which reacts with added OH2) and A2 (which 
reacts with added H1) are large enough that the 3A24
3HA4 ratio does not change significantly 
when strong acids or bases are added
Acid‚Äìbase titrations
‚ùØ The progress of a titration is represented by plotting the pH of the solution versus the volume 
of added titrant; the resulting graph is called a pH curve or titration curve
‚ùØ Strong acid‚Äìstrong base titrations show a sharp change in pH near the equivalence point
‚ùØ The shape of the pH curve for a strong base‚Äìstrong acid titration before the equivalence point 
is quite different from the shape of the pH curve for a strong base‚Äìweak acid titration
‚ùØ The strong base‚Äìweak acid pH curve shows the effects of buffering before the equiva-
lence point
‚ùØ For a strong base‚Äìweak acid titration, the pH is greater than 7 at the equivalence point 
because of the basic properties of A2
‚ùØ Indicators are sometimes used to mark the equivalence point of an acid‚Äìbase titration
‚ùØ The end point is where the indicator changes color
‚ùØ The goal is to have the end point and the equivalence point be as close as possible
 1. What is meant by the presence of a common ion? How 
does the presence of a common ion affect an equilib-
rium such as
HNO21aq2 m H11aq2 1 NO2
21aq2
What is an acid‚Äìbase solution called that contains a 
common ion?
 2. Define a buffer solution. What makes up a buffer solu-
tion? How do buffers absorb added H1 or OH2 with 
little pH change?
 
Is it necessary that the concentrations of the weak 
acid and the weak base in a buffered solution be equal? 
Explain. What is the pH of a buffer when the weak acid 
and conjugate base concentrations are equal?
 
A buffer generally contains a weak acid and its weak 
conjugate base, or a weak base and its weak conjugate 
acid, in water. You can solve for the pH by setting up 
the equilibrium problem using the Ka reaction of the 
weak acid or the Kb reaction of the conjugate base. Both

Marathon Problems also combine concepts from multiple 
chapters; they are the most challenging problems in the end-of-
chapter material.
 
Look for information on the sulfates of gallium, sodium,

mium, and oxygen; chromium has an oxidation state of 16 
and there are 2 potassiums and 1 chromium in the formula. 
The masses of the solutes in each of the solutions are the same. 
When the solutions are added together, a blood-red precipitate 
forms. After the reaction has gone to completion, you dry the 
solid and find that it has a mass of 331.8 g.

completely neutralize a sample of H2X, 35.6 mL of 0.175 M 
OH2 solution was required. What was the mass of the H2X 
sample used?
Marathon Problems
These problems are designed to incorporate several concepts and 
techniques into one situation.

particular sulfate salt. They dissolved a 0.1472-g sample of the 
salt in water and treated it with excess barium chloride, result-
ing in the precipitation of barium sulfate. After the precipitate 
had been filtered and dried, it weighed 0.2327 g.

hen you start your car, do you think about chemistry? Probably not, but 
you should. The power to start your car is furnished by a lead storage bat-
tery. How does this battery work, and what does it contain? When a battery goes dead, 
what does that mean? If you use a friend‚Äôs car to ‚Äújump-start‚Äù your car, did you know 
that your battery could explode? How can you avoid such an unpleasant possibility? 
What is in the gasoline that you put in your tank, and how does it furnish energy to 
your car so that you can drive it to school? What is the vapor that comes out of the 
exhaust pipe, and why does it cause air pollution? Your car‚Äôs air conditioner might 
have a substance in it that is leading to the destruction of the ozone layer in the upper 
atmosphere. What are we doing about that? And why is the ozone layer important 
anyway?
All of these questions can be answered by understanding some chemistry. In fact, 
we‚Äôll consider the answers to all of these questions in this text.
Chemistry is around you all the time. You are able to read and understand this sen-
tence because chemical reactions are occurring in your brain. The food you ate for 
breakfast or lunch is now furnishing energy through chemical reactions. Trees and 
grass grow because of chemical changes.
Chemistry also crops up in some unexpected places. When archaeologist Luis 
 Alvarez was studying in college, he probably didn‚Äôt realize that the chemical elements 
iridium and niobium would make him very famous when they helped him solve the 
problem of the disappearing dinosaurs. For decades scientists had wrestled with the 
mystery of why the dinosaurs, after ruling the earth for millions of years, suddenly 
became extinct 65 million years ago. In studying core samples of rocks dating back to 
that period, Alvarez and his coworkers recognized unusual levels of iridium and nio-
bium in these samples‚Äîlevels much more characteristic of extraterrestrial bodies than 
of the earth. Based on these  observations, Alvarez hypothesized that a large meteor hit 
the earth 65 million years ago, changing atmospheric conditions so much that the 
dinosaurs‚Äô food couldn‚Äôt grow, and they died‚Äîalmost instantly in the geologic time 
frame.
Chemistry is also important to historians. Did you realize that lead poisoning prob-
ably was a significant contributing factor to the decline of the Roman Empire? The 
Romans had high exposure to lead from lead-glazed pottery, lead water pipes, and a 
sweetening syrup called sapa that was prepared by boiling down grape juice in lead-
lined vessels. It turns out that one reason for sapa‚Äôs sweetness was lead acetate (‚Äúsugar 
of lead‚Äù), which formed as the juice was cooked down. Lead poisoning, with its symp-
toms of lethargy and mental malfunctions, certainly could have contributed to the 
demise of the Roman society.
Chemistry is also apparently very important in determining a person‚Äôs behavior. 
Various studies have shown that many personality disorders can be linked directly to 
imbalances of trace elements in the body. For example, studies on the inmates at State-
ville Prison in Illinois have linked low cobalt levels with violent behavior. Lithium 
salts have been shown to be very effective in controlling the effects of manic-depressive 
disease, and you‚Äôve probably at some time in your life felt a special ‚Äúchemistry‚Äù for 
another person. Studies suggest there is literally chemistry going on between two peo-
ple who are attracted to each other. ‚ÄúFalling in love‚Äù apparently causes changes in the 
chemistry of the brain; chemicals are produced that give that ‚Äúhigh‚Äù associated with a 
new relationship. Unfortunately, these chemical effects seem to wear off over time, 
even if the relationship persists and grows.
The importance of chemistry in the interactions of people should not really surprise 
us. We know that insects communicate by emitting and receiving chemical signals via 
molecules called pheromones. For example, ants have a very complicated set of chem-
ical signals to signify food sources, danger, and so forth. Also, various female sex

attractants have been isolated and used to lure males into traps to control insect popu-
lations. It would not be surprising if humans also emitted chemical signals that we 
were not aware of on a conscious level. Thus chemistry is pretty interesting and pretty 
important. The main goal of this text is to help you understand the concepts of chem-
istry so that you can better appreciate the world around you and can be more effective 
in  whatever career you choose.
1.1 Chemistry: An Overview
Since the time of the ancient Greeks, people have wondered about the answer to the 
question: What is matter made of? For a long time, humans have believed that matter 
is composed of atoms, and in the previous three centuries, we have collected much 
indirect evidence to support this belief. Very recently, something exciting has 
happened‚Äîfor the first time we can ‚Äúsee‚Äù individual atoms. Of course, we cannot see 
atoms with the naked eye; we must use a special microscope called a scanning tunnel-
ing microscope (STM). Although we will not consider the details of its operation here, 
the STM uses an electron current from a tiny needle to probe the surface of a sub-
stance. The STM pictures of  several substances are shown in Fig. 1.1. Notice how the 
atoms are connected to one another by ‚Äúbridges,‚Äù which, as we will see, represent the 
electrons that interconnect atoms.
So, at this point, we are fairly sure that matter consists of individual atoms. The 
nature of these atoms is quite complex, and the components of atoms don‚Äôt behave 
much like the objects we see in the world of our experience. We call this world the 
macroscopic world‚Äîthe world of cars, tables, baseballs, rocks, oceans, and so forth. 
One of the main jobs of a scientist is to delve into the macroscopic world and dis-
cover its ‚Äúparts.‚Äù For  example, when you view a beach from a distance, it looks like 
a continuous solid substance. As you get closer, you see that the beach is really made 
up of individual grains of sand. As we examine these grains of sand, we find that they 
are composed of silicon and oxygen atoms connected to each other to form intricate 
shapes (Fig. 1.2). One of the main challenges of chemistry is to understand the con-
nection between the macroscopic world that we experience and the microscopic 
world of atoms and molecules. To truly understand chemistry, you must learn to 
think on the atomic level. We will spend much time in this text helping you learn to 
do that.

CRITICAL THINKING The scanning tunneling microscope allows 
us to ‚Äúsee‚Äù atoms. What if you were sent back in time before the invention of the 
scanning tunneling microscope? What evidence could you give to support the 
theory that all matter is made of atoms and molecules?
One of the amazing things about our universe is that the tremendous variety of 
substances we find there results from only about 100 different kinds of atoms. You can 
think of these approximately 100 atoms as the letters in an alphabet from which all the 
‚Äúwords‚Äù in the universe are made. It is the way the atoms are organized in a given 
substance that determines the properties of that substance. For example, water, one of 
the most common and important substances on the earth, is composed of two types of 
atoms: hydrogen and  oxygen. Two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom are bound 
together to form the water molecule:
hydrogen atom
oxygen atom
water molecule
When an electric current passes through it, water is decomposed to hydrogen and oxy-
gen. These chemical elements themselves exist naturally as diatomic (two-atom) 
molecules:
written O2
oxygen molecule
written H2
hydrogen molecule
We can represent the decomposition of water to its component elements, hydrogen and 
oxygen, as follows:
one oxygen molecule
written O2
two water
molecules
written 2H2O
electric
current
two hydrogen molecules
written 2H2

Notice that it takes two molecules of water to furnish the right number of oxygen and 
hydrogen atoms to allow for the formation of the two-atom molecules. This reaction 
explains why the battery in your car can explode if you jump-start it improperly. When 
you hook up the jumper cables, current flows through the dead battery, which contains 
water (and other things), and causes hydrogen and oxygen to form by decomposition 
of some of the water. A spark can cause this accumulated hydrogen and oxygen to 
explode, forming water again.

This example illustrates two of the fundamental concepts of chemistry: (1) Matter is 
composed of various types of atoms, and (2) one substance changes to another by 
reorganizing the way the atoms are attached to each other.
These are core ideas of chemistry, and we will have much more to say about them.
Science: A Process for Understanding  
Nature and Its Changes
How do you tackle the problems that confront you in real life? Think about your trip 
to school. If you live in a city, traffic is undoubtedly a problem you confront daily. How 
do you decide the best way to drive to school? If you are new in town, you first get a 
map and look at the possible ways to make the trip. Then you might collect informa-
tion about the advantages and disadvantages of various routes from people who know 
the area. Based on this information, you probably try to predict the best route. How-
ever, you can find the best route only by trying several of them and comparing the 
results. After a few experiments with the various possibilities, you probably will be 
able to select the best way. What you are doing in solving this everyday problem is 
applying the same process that scientists use to study nature. The first thing you did 
was collect relevant data. Then you made a prediction, and then you tested it by trying 
it out. This process contains the fundamental elements of science:
1.
Making observations (collecting data)
2.
Suggesting a possible explanation (formulating a hypothesis)
3.
Doing experiments to test the possible explanation (testing the hypothesis)
Scientists call this process the scientific method. We will discuss it in more detail in the 
next section. One of life‚Äôs most important activities is solving problems‚Äînot ‚Äúplug and 
chug‚Äù exercises, but real problems‚Äîproblems that have new facets to them, that involve 
things you may have never confronted before. The more creative you are at solving these 
problems, the more effective you will be in your career and your personal life. Part of the 
reason for learning chemistry, therefore, is to become a better problem solver. Chemists 
are usually excellent problem solvers because to master chemistry, you have to master 
the scientific approach. Chemical problems are frequently very complicated‚Äîthere is 
usually no neat and tidy solution. Often it is difficult to know where to begin.
1.2 The Scientific Method
Science is a framework for gaining and organizing knowledge. Science is not simply a 
set of facts but also a plan of action‚Äîa procedure for processing and understanding 
certain types of information. Scientific thinking is useful in all aspects of life, but in 
this text we will use it to understand how the chemical world operates. As we said in 
1.2

1.2 The Scientific Method

our  previous discussion, the process that lies at the center of scientific inquiry is called 
the scientific method. There are actually many scientific methods, depending on the 
nature of the  specific problem under study and the particular investigator involved. 
However, it is useful to consider the following general framework for a generic scien-
tific method (Fig. 1.3):
Steps in the Scientific Method
1. Making observations. Observations may be qualitative (the sky is blue; water is a 
liquid) or quantitative (water boils at 1008C; a certain chemistry book weighs 2 kg).  
A qualitative observation does not involve a number. A quantitative observation 
(called a measurement) involves both a number and a unit.
2. Formulating hypotheses. A hypothesis is a possible explanation for an observation.
3. Performing experiments. An experiment is carried out to test a hypothesis. This involves 
gathering new information that enables a scientist to decide whether the hypothesis is 
valid‚Äîthat is, whether it is supported by the new information learned from the experi-
ment. Experiments always produce new observations, and this brings the process back 
to the beginning again.
To understand a given phenomenon, these steps are repeated many times, gradually 
accumulating the knowledge necessary to provide a possible explanation of the 
phenomenon.
Scientific Models
Once a set of hypotheses that agrees with the various observations is obtained, the 
hypotheses are assembled into a theory. A theory, which is often called a model, is a set 
of tested hypotheses that gives an overall explanation of some natural phenomenon.
It is very important to distinguish between observations and theories. An observa-
tion is something that is witnessed and can be recorded. A theory is an interpretation‚Äî
a possible explanation of why nature behaves in a particular way. Theories inevitably 
change as more information becomes available. For example, the motions of the sun 
and stars have remained virtually the same over the thousands of years during which 
humans have been observing them, but our explanations‚Äîour theories‚Äîfor these 
motions have changed greatly since ancient times.
The point is that scientists do not stop asking questions just because a given theory 
seems to account satisfactorily for some aspect of natural behavior. They continue 
doing experiments to refine or replace the existing theories. This is generally done by 
using the currently accepted theory to make a prediction and then performing an experi-
ment (making a new observation) to see whether the results bear out this prediction.
Always remember that theories (models) are human inventions. They represent 
attempts to explain observed natural behavior in terms of human experiences. A theory 
is actually an educated guess. We must continue to do experiments and to refine our 
theories (making them consistent with new knowledge) if we hope to approach a more 
complete understanding of nature.
As scientists observe nature, they often see that the same observation applies to 
many different systems. For example, studies of innumerable chemical changes have 
shown that the total observed mass of the materials involved is the same before and after 
the change. Such generally observed behavior is formulated into a statement called a 
natural law. For example, the observation that the total mass of materials is not affected 
by a chemical change in those materials is called the law of conservation of mass.
Note the difference between a natural law and a theory. A natural law is a sum-
mary of observed (measurable) behavior, whereas a theory is an explanation of 
behavior. A law summarizes what happens; a theory (model) is an attempt to 
explain why it happens.

In this section we have described the scientific method as it might ideally be applied 
(Fig. 1.4). However, it is important to remember that science does not always progress 
smoothly and efficiently. For one thing, hypotheses and observations are not totally 
independent of each other, as we have assumed in the description of the idealized sci-
entific method. The coupling of observations and hypotheses occurs because once we 
begin to proceed down a given theoretical path, our hypotheses are unavoidably 
couched in the language of that theory. In other words, we tend to see what we expect 
to see and often fail to notice things that we do not expect. Thus the theory we are test-
ing helps us  because it focuses our questions. However, at the same time, this focusing 
process may limit our ability to see other possible explanations.
It is also important to keep in mind that scientists are human. They have prejudices; 
they misinterpret data; they become emotionally attached to their theories and thus lose 
objectivity; and they play politics. Science is affected by profit motives, budgets, fads, 
wars, and religious beliefs. Galileo, for example, was forced to recant his astronomical 
P
ost-it Notes, a product of the 3M 
Corporation, revolutionized casual 
written communications and personal 
reminders. Introduced in the United 
States in 1980, these sticky-but-not-too-
sticky notes have now found countless 
uses in offices, cars, and homes 
throughout the world.
The invention of sticky notes 
occurred over a period of about 10 years 
and involved a great deal of serendipity. 
The adhesive for Post-it Notes was dis-
covered by Dr. Spencer F. Silver of 3M in 
1968. Silver found that when an acrylate 
polymer material was made in a particu-
lar way, it formed cross-linked micro-
spheres. When suspended in a solvent 
and sprayed on a sheet of paper, this 
substance formed a ‚Äúsparse monolayer‚Äù 
of adhesive after the solvent evaporated. 
Scanning electron microscope images of 
the adhesive show that it has an irregular 
surface, a little like the surface of a gravel 
road. In contrast, the adhesive on cello-
phane tape looks smooth and uniform, 
like a superhighway. The bumpy surface 
of Silver‚Äôs adhesive caused it to be sticky 
but not so sticky to produce permanent 
adhesion, because the number of con-
tact points between the binding sur-
faces was limited.
When he invented this adhesive, 
Silver had no specific ideas for its use, so 
he spread the word of his discovery 
to his fellow employees at 3M to 
see if anyone had an application for 
it. In addition, over the next several 
years development was carried out 
to improve the adhesive‚Äôs proper-
ties. It was not until 1974 that the 
idea for Post-it Notes popped up. 
One Sunday, Art Fry, a chemical 
engineer for 3M, was singing in his 
church choir when he became 
annoyed that the bookmark in his 
hymnal kept falling out. He 
thought to himself that it would be 
nice if the bookmark were sticky 
enough to stay in place but not so 
sticky that it couldn‚Äôt be moved. Luckily, 
he remembered Silver‚Äôs glue‚Äîand the 
Post-it Note was born.
For the next three years, Fry worked 
to overcome the manufacturing obsta-
cles associated with the product. By 
1977 enough Post-it Notes were being 
produced to supply 3M‚Äôs corporate 
headquarters, where the employees 
quickly became addicted to their many 
uses. Post-it Notes are now available in 
62 colors and 25 shapes.
In the years since the introduction of 
Post-it Notes, 3M has heard some 
remarkable stories connected to the use 
of these notes. For example, a Post-it 
Note was applied to the nose of a 
corporate jet, where it was intended to 
be read by the plane‚Äôs Las Vegas ground 
crew. Someone forgot to remove it, 
however. The note was still on the nose 
of the plane when it landed in Minne-
apolis, having survived a takeoff, a land-
ing, and speeds of 500 miles per hour at 
temperatures as low as 2568F. Stories on 
the 3M website describe how a Post-it 
Note on the front door of a home sur-
vived the 140-mile-per-hour winds of 
Hurricane Hugo and how a foreign 
official accepted Post-it Notes in lieu of 
cash when a small bribe was needed to 
cut through bureaucratic hassles.
Post-it Notes have definitely 
changed the way we communicate and 
remember things.

observations in the face of strong religious resistance. Lavoisier, the father of modern 
chemistry, was beheaded because of his political affiliations. Great progress in the chemis-
try of nitrogen fertilizers resulted from the desire to produce explosives to fight wars. The 
progress of science is often affected more by the frailties of humans and their  institutions 
than by the limitations of scientific measuring devices. The scientific methods are only as 
effective as the humans using them. They do not automatically lead to progress.
CRITICAL THINKING What if everyone in the government used 
the scientific method to analyze and solve society‚Äôs problems, and politics were 
never involved in the solutions? How would this be different from the present 
situation, and would it be better or worse?
1.3 Units of Measurement
Making observations is fundamental to all science. A quantitative observation, or mea-
surement, always consists of two parts: a number and a scale (called a unit). Both parts 
must be present for the measurement to be meaningful.
In this textbook we will use measurements of mass, length, time, temperature, electric 
current, and the amount of a substance, among others. Scientists recognized long ago 
that standard systems of units had to be adopted if measurements were to be useful. If 
every scientist had a different set of units, complete chaos would result. Unfortunately, 
different standards were adopted in different parts of the world. The two major systems 
are the English system used in the United States and the metric system used by most of 
the rest of the industrialized world. This duality causes a good deal of trouble; for exam-
ple, parts as simple as bolts are not interchangeable between machines built using the 
two systems. As a result, the United States has begun to adopt the metric system.
Most scientists in all countries have used the metric system for many years. In 1960, 
an international agreement set up a system of units called the International  System (le
Syst√®me International in French), or the SI system. This system is based on the metric 
system and units derived from the metric system. The fundamental SI units are listed in 
Table 1.1. We will discuss how to manipulate these units later in this chapter.

‚óÄ
Robert Boyle (1627‚Äì1691) was born in Ireland. He became especially interested in experiments 
involving air and developed an air pump with which he produced evacuated cylinders. He used 
these cylinders to show that a feather and a lump of lead fall at the same rate in the absence of 
air resistance and that sound cannot be produced in a vacuum. His most famous experiments 
involved careful measurements of the volume of a gas as a function of pressure. In his book  
Boyle urged that the ancient view of elements as mystical substances should be abandoned and 
that an element should instead be defined as anything that cannot be broken down into simpler 
substances. This concept was an important step in the development of  modern chemistry.

Because the fundamental units are not always convenient (expressing the mass of a 
pin in kilograms is awkward), prefixes are used to change the size of the unit. These 
are listed in Table 1.2. Some common objects and their measurements in SI units are 
listed in Table 1.3.
One physical quantity that is very important in chemistry is volume, which is not 
a fundamental SI unit but is derived from length. A cube that measures 1 meter (m) 
on each edge is represented in Fig. 1.5. This cube has a volume of (1 m)3 5 1 m3.

1.3 Units of Measurement

Recognizing that there are 10 decimeters (dm) in a meter, the volume of this cube is 
(1 m)3 5 (10 dm)3 5 1000 dm3. A cubic decimeter, that is, (1 dm)3, is commonly 
called a liter (L), which is a unit of volume slightly larger than a quart. As shown in 
Fig. 1.5, 1000 L is contained in a cube with a volume of 1 cubic meter. Similarly, 
since 1 decimeter equals 10 centimeters (cm), the liter can be divided into 1000 cubes, 
each with a volume of 1 cubic  centimeter:
1 L 5 11 dm2 3 5 110 cm2 3 5 1000 cm3
Also, since 1 cm3 5 1 milliliter (mL),
1 L 5 1000 cm3 5 1000 mL
Thus 1 liter contains 1000 cubic centimeters, or 1000 milliliters.
Chemical laboratory work frequently requires measurement of the volumes of  liquids. 
Several devices for the accurate determination of liquid volume are shown in Fig. 1.6.
An important point concerning measurements is the relationship between mass and 
weight. Although these terms are sometimes used interchangeably, they are not the 
same. Mass is a measure of the resistance of an object to a change in its state of motion.
Mass is measured by the force necessary to give an object a certain acceleration. On the 
H
ow important are conversions from 
one unit to another? If you ask the 
National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA), very important! 
In 1999, NASA lost a $125 million Mars 
Climate Orbiter because of a failure to 
convert from English to  metric units.
The problem arose because two 
teams working on the Mars mission 
were using different sets of units. 
NASA‚Äôs scientists at the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena, California, 
assumed that the thrust data for the 
rockets on the Orbiter they received 
from Lockheed Martin Astronautics in 
Denver, which built the spacecraft, 
were in metric units. In reality, the units 
were English. As a result, the Orbiter 
dipped 100 km lower into the Mars 
atmosphere than planned, and the 
friction from the atmosphere caused 
the craft to burn up.
NASA‚Äôs mistake refueled the contro-
versy over whether Congress should 
require the United States to switch to 
the metric system. About 95% of the 
world now uses the  metric system, and 
the United States is slowly switching 
from English to metric. For example, 
the automobile industry has adopted 
metric fasteners, and we buy our soda 
in 2-L bottles.
Units can be very important. In fact, 
they can mean the difference between 
life and death on some occasions. In 
1983, for example, a Canadian jetliner 
almost ran out of fuel when someone 
pumped 22,300 lb of fuel into the 
 aircraft instead of 22,300 kg. Remember 
to watch your units!

earth we use the force that gravity exerts on an object to measure its mass. We call this 
force the object‚Äôs weight. Since weight is the response of mass to gravity, it varies with 
the strength of the gravitational field. Therefore, your body mass is the same on the 
earth and on the moon, but your weight would be much less on the moon than on the 
earth because of the moon‚Äôs smaller gravitational field.
Because weighing something on a chemical balance involves comparing the mass 
of that object to a standard mass, the terms weight and mass are sometimes used inter-
changeably, although this is incorrect.
CRITICAL THINKING What if you were not allowed to use units 
for one day? How would this affect your life for that day?
1.4 Uncertainty in Measurement
The number associated with a measurement is obtained using some measuring device. 
For example, consider the measurement of the volume of a liquid using a buret (shown 
in Fig. 1.7 with the scale greatly magnified). Notice that the meniscus of the liquid 
occurs at about 20.15 mL. This means that about 20.15 mL of liquid has been delivered 
from the buret (if the initial position of the liquid meniscus was 0.00 mL). Note that 
we must estimate the last number of the volume reading by interpolating between the 
0.1-mL marks. Since the last number is estimated, its value may be different if another 
person makes the same measurement. If five different people read the same volume, 
the results might be as follows:
Person

These results show that the first three numbers (20.1) remain the same regardless of 
who makes the measurement; these are called certain digits. However, the digit to the 
right of the 1 must be estimated and therefore varies; it is called an uncertain digit. We 
customarily report a measurement by recording all the certain digits plus the first 
uncertain digit. In our example it would not make any sense to try to record the volume 
to thousandths of a milliliter because the value for hundredths of a milliliter must be 
estimated when  using the buret.
It is very important to realize that a measurement always has some degree of uncer-
tainty. The uncertainty of a measurement depends on the precision of the measuring 
device. For example, using a bathroom scale, you might estimate the mass of a grape-
fruit to be approximately 1.5 lb. Weighing the same grapefruit on a highly precise 
balance might produce a result of 1.476 lb. In the first case, the uncertainty occurs in 
the tenths of a pound place; in the second case, the uncertainty occurs in the thou-
sandths of a pound place. Suppose we weigh two similar grapefruits on the two devices 
and obtain the following results:
Bathroom Scale
Balance
Grapefruit 1
1.5 lb
1.476 lb
Grapefruit 2
1.5 lb
1.518 lb
Do the two grapefruits have the same mass? The answer depends on which set of results 
you consider. Thus a conclusion based on a series of measurements depends on the 
certainty of those measurements. For this reason, it is important to indicate the uncer-
tainty in any measurement. This is done by always recording the certain digits and the 
first uncertain digit (the estimated number). These numbers are called the significant 
figures of a measurement.
The convention of significant figures automatically indicates something about the 
uncertainty in a measurement. The uncertainty in the last number (the estimated num-
ber) is usually assumed to be 61 unless otherwise indicated. For example, the mea-
surement 1.86 kg can be taken to mean 1.86 6 0.01 kg.
Uncertainty in Measurement
In analyzing a sample of polluted water, a chemist measured out a 25.00-mL water 
sample with a pipet (see Fig. 1.6). At another point in the analysis, the chemist used a 
graduated cylinder (see Fig. 1.6) to measure 25 mL of a solution. What is the differ-
ence between the measurements 25.00 mL and 25 mL?
 
SOLUTION 
Even though the two volume measurements appear to be equal, they really convey  
different information. The quantity 25 mL means that the volume is between 24 mL 
and 26 mL, whereas the quantity 25.00 mL means that the volume is between  
24.99 mL and 25.01 mL. The pipet measures volume with much greater precision than 
does the graduated cylinder.
See Exercise 1.37
When making a measurement, it is important to record the results to the appropriate 
number of significant figures. For example, if a certain buret can be read to 60.01 mL, 
you should record a reading of twenty-five milliliters as 25.00 mL, not 25 mL. This 
way at some later time when you are using your results to do calculations, the uncer-
tainty in the measurement will be known to you.
A measurement always has some degree of 
uncertainty.
Uncertainty in measurement is discussed 
in more detail in Appendix 1.5.

Precision and Accuracy
Two terms often used to describe the reliability of measurements are precision and 
accuracy. Although these words are frequently used interchangeably in everyday life, 
they have different meanings in the scientific context. Accuracy refers to the agree-
ment of a particular value with the true value. Precision refers to the degree of agree-
ment among several measurements of the same quantity. Precision reflects the 
reproducibility of a given type of measurement. The difference between these terms is 
illustrated by the results of three different dart throws shown in Fig. 1.8.
Two different types of errors are illustrated in Fig. 1.8. A random error (also called 
an indeterminate error) means that a measurement has an equal probability of being 
high or low. This type of error occurs in estimating the value of the last digit of a mea-
surement. The second type of error is called systematic error (or determinate error). 
This type of error occurs in the same direction each time; it is either always high or 
always low. Fig. 1.8(a) indicates large random errors (poor technique). Fig. 1.8(b) 
indicates small random errors but a large systematic error, and Fig. 1.8(c) indicates 
small random errors and no systematic error.
In quantitative work, precision is often used as an indication of accuracy; we assume 
that the average of a series of precise measurements (which should ‚Äúaverage out‚Äù the 
random errors because of their equal probability of being high or low) is accurate, or 
close to the ‚Äútrue‚Äù value. However, this assumption is valid only if systematic errors 
are absent. Suppose we weigh a piece of brass five times on a very precise balance and 
obtain the following results:
Weighing
Result
1
2.486 g
2
2.487 g
3
2.485 g
4
2.484 g
5
2.488 g
Normally, we would assume that the true mass of the piece of brass is very close to 
2.486 g, which is the average of the five results:
2.486 g 1 2.487 g 1 2.485 g 1 2.484 g 1 2.488 g
5
5 2.486 g
However, if the balance has a defect causing it to give a result that is consistently 
1.000 g too high (a systematic error of 11.000 g), then the measured value of 2.486 g 
would be seriously in error. The point here is that high precision among several mea-
surements is an indication of accuracy only if systematic errors are absent.
a
Neither accurate nor precise.
b
Precise but not accurate.
c
Accurate and precise.

Precision and Accuracy
To check the accuracy of a graduated cylinder, a student filled the cylinder to the 
25-mL mark using water delivered from a buret (see Fig. 1.6) and then read the volume 
delivered. Following are the results of five trials:

26.54 mL
Is the graduated cylinder accurate?
SOLUTION
The results of the trials show very good precision (for a graduated cylinder). The student 
has good technique. However, note that the average value measured using the buret is sig-
nificantly different from 25 mL. Thus this graduated cylinder is not very accurate. It pro-
duces a systematic error (in this case, the indicated result is low for each measurement).
See Question 1.11
1.5 Significant Figures 
and Calculations
Calculating the final result for an experiment usually involves adding, subtracting, 
multiplying, or dividing the results of various types of measurements. Since it is very 
important that the uncertainty in the final result is known correctly, we have developed 
rules for counting the significant figures in each number and for determining the cor-
rect number of significant figures in the final result.
Rules for Counting Significant Figures
1. Nonzero integers. Nonzero integers always count as significant figures.
2. Zeros. There are three classes of zeros:
a.  Leading zeros are zeros that precede all the nonzero digits. These do not count as 
significant figures. In the number 0.0025, the three zeros simply indicate the position 
of the decimal point. This number has only two significant figures.
b.  Captive zeros are zeros between nonzero digits. These always count as significant 
figures. The number 1.008 has four significant figures.
c.  Trailing zeros are zeros at the right end of the number. They are significant only if the 
number contains a decimal point. The number 100 has only one significant figure, 
whereas the number 1.00 3 102 has three significant figures. The number one 
hundred written as 100. also has three significant figures.
EXAMPLE 1.2
Precision is an indication of accuracy only if 
there are no systematic errors.
1.5
Leading zeros are never significant figures.
Captive zeros are always significant figures.
Trailing zeros are sometimes significant 
figures.

3. Exact numbers. Many times calculations involve numbers that were not obtained  
using measuring devices but were determined by counting: 10 experiments, 3 apples, 
8 molecules. Such numbers are called exact numbers. They can be assumed to have an 
infinite number of significant figures. Other examples of exact numbers are the 2 in 2pr 
(the circumference of a circle) and the 4 and the 3 in 4
3pr3 (the volume of a sphere).  
Exact numbers also can arise from definitions. For example, 1 inch is defined as exactly 
2.54 centimeters. Thus, in the statement 1 in 5 2.54 cm, neither the 2.54 nor the 1 limits 
the number of significant figures when used in a calculation.
Note that the number 1.00 3 102 on the previous page is written in exponential 
notation. This type of notation has at least two advantages: The number of significant 
figures can be easily  indicated, and fewer zeros are needed to write a very large or 
very small number. For example, the number 0.000060 is much more conveniently 
represented as 6.0 3 1025 (the number has two significant figures).
Significant Figures
Give the number of significant figures for each of the following results.
a. A student‚Äôs extraction procedure on tea yields 0.0105 g of caffeine.
b. A chemist records a mass of 0.050080 g in an analysis.
c. In an experiment a span of time is determined to be 8.050 3 1023 s.
 
SOLUTION 
a.  The number contains three significant figures. The zeros to the left of the 1 are leading 
zeros and are not significant, but the remaining zero (a captive zero) is significant.
b.  The number contains five significant figures. The leading zeros (to the left of the 
5) are not significant. The captive zeros between the 5 and the 8 are significant, 
and the trailing zero to the right of the 8 is significant because the number con-
tains a decimal point.
c. This number has four significant figures. Both zeros are significant.
See Exercises 1.32 through 1.34
To this point we have learned to count the significant figures in a given number. 
Next, we must consider how uncertainty accumulates as calculations are carried out. 
The detailed analysis of the accumulation of uncertainties depends on the type of cal-
culation involved and can be complex. However, in this textbook we will use the fol-
lowing simple rules that have been developed for determining the appropriate number 
of significant figures in the result of a calculation.
Rules for Significant Figures in Mathematical Operations
1. For multiplication or division, the number of significant figures in the result is the same as 
the number in the least precise measurement used in the calculation. For example, 
consider the calculation
4.56 3 1.4 5 6.38 8888888n      6.4
 
‚Üë 
Limiting term has 
two significant 
figures
 
‚Üë 
Two significant 
figures
The product should have only two significant figures, since 1.4 has two significant figures.
Exact numbers never limit the number of 
significant figures in a calculation.
Exponential notation is reviewed in  
Appendix 1.1.

2. For addition or subtraction, the result has the same number of decimal places as the least 
precise measurement used in the calculation. For example, consider the sum
 
12.11
 
18.0   ‚Üê Limiting term has one decimal place
 
 1.013
 
31.123 8888888n 31.1
 
‚Üë 
One decimal place
The correct result is 31.1, since 18.0 has only one decimal place.
Note that for multiplication and division, significant figures are counted. For addi-
tion and subtraction, the decimal places are counted.
In most calculations you will need to round numbers to obtain the correct number 
of significant figures. The following rules should be applied when rounding.
Rules for Rounding
1. In a series of calculations, carry the extra digits through to the final result, then round.
2. If the digit to be removed
a.  is less than 5, the preceding digit stays the same. For example, 1.33 rounds to 1.3.
b.  is equal to or greater than 5, the preceding digit is increased by 1. For example, 1.36 
rounds to 1.4.
Although rounding is generally straightforward, one point requires special empha-
sis. As an illustration, suppose that the number 4.348 needs to be rounded to two sig-
nificant figures. In doing this, we look only at the first number to the right of the 3:
4.348
‚Üë 
Look at this number to  
round to two significant figures.
The number is rounded to 4.3 because 4 is less than 5. It is incorrect to round sequentially. 
For example, do not round the 4 to 5 to give 4.35 and then round the 3 to 4 to give 4.4.
When rounding, use only the first number to the right of the last significant figure.
It is important to note that Rule 1 above usually will not be followed in the exam-
ples in this text because we want to show the correct number of significant figures in 
each step of a problem. This same practice is followed for the detailed solutions given 
in the Solutions Guide. However, when you are doing problems, you should carry extra 
digits throughout a series of calculations and round to the correct number of significant 
figures only at the end. This is the practice you should follow. The fact that your round-
ing procedures are different from those used in this text must be taken into account 
when you check your answer with the one given at the end of the book or in the Solu-
tions Guide. Your answer (based on rounding only at the end of a calculation) may 
differ in the last place from that given here as the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù answer because we have 
rounded after each step. To help you understand the difference between these rounding 
procedures, we will consider them further in Example 1.4.
Significant Figures in Mathematical Operations
Carry out the following mathematical operations, and give each result with the correct 
number of significant figures.
a. 1.05 3 1023 4 6.135
b. 21 2 13.8
Corrected
Rule 2 is consistent with the operation of 
electronic calculators.
Do not round sequentially. The number 
6.8347 rounded to three significant figures 
is 6.83, not 6.84.

c.  As part of a lab assignment to determine the value of the gas constant (R), a stu-
dent measured the pressure (P), volume (V ), and temperature (T) for a sample of 
gas, where
R 5 PV
T
The following values were obtained: P 5 2.560, T 5 275.15, and V 5 8.8. (Gases 
will be discussed in detail in Chapter 5; we will not be concerned at this time about 
the units for these quantities.) Calculate R to the correct number of significant 
figures.
 
SOLUTION 
a.  The result is 1.71 3 1024, which has three significant figures because the term with 
the least precision (1.05 3 1023) has three significant figures.
b.  The result is 7 with no decimal point because the number with the least number 
of decimal places (21) has none.
c. R 5 PV
T 5 12.5602 18.82
275.15
 
The correct procedure for obtaining the final result can be represented as follows:
 12.5602 18.82
275.15
5 22.528
275.15 5 0.0818753
 5 0.082 5 8.2 3 1022 5 R
The final result must be rounded to two significant figures because 8.8 (the least pre-
cise measurement) has two significant figures. To show the effects of rounding at inter-
mediate steps, we will carry out the calculation as follows:
Rounded to two  
significant figures  
‚Üì
12.5602 18.82
275.15
5 22.528
275.15 5
23
275.15
Now we proceed with the next calculation:
23
275.15 5 0.0835908
Rounded to two significant figures, this result is
0.084 5 8.4 3 1022
Note that intermediate rounding gives a significantly different result than that obtained 
by rounding only at the end. Again, we must reemphasize that in your calculations you 
should round only at the end. However, because rounding is carried out at intermediate 
steps in this text (to always show the correct number of significant figures), the final 
answer given in the text may differ slightly from the one you obtain (rounding only at 
the end).
See Exercises 1.39 through 1.42
There is a useful lesson to be learned from Part c of Example 1.4. The student mea-
sured the pressure and temperature to greater precision than the volume. A more pre-
cise value of R (one with more significant figures) could have been obtained if a more 
precise measurement of V had been made. As it is, the efforts expended to measure 
P and T very precisely were wasted. Remember that a series of measurements to obtain 
some final result should all be done to about the same precision.

This number must be rounded to two 
significant figures.

1.6 Learning to Solve Problems 
Systematically
One of the main activities in learning chemistry is solving various types of problems. 
The best way to approach a problem, whether it is a chemistry problem or one from 
your daily life, is to ask questions such as the following:
1.
What is my goal? Or you might phrase it as: Where am I going?
2.
Where am I starting? Or you might phrase it as: What do I know?
3.
How do I proceed from where I start to where I want to go? Or you might say: 
How do I get there?
We will use these ideas as we consider unit conversions in this chapter. Then we will 
have much more to say about problem solving in Chapter 3, where we will start to 
consider more complex problems.
1.7 Dimensional Analysis
It is often necessary to convert a given result from one system of units to another. The 
best way to do this is by a method called the unit factor method or, more commonly, 
dimensional analysis. To illustrate the use of this method, we will consider several 
unit conversions. Some equivalents in the English and metric systems are listed in 
Table 1.4. A more complete list of conversion factors given to more significant figures 
appears in Appendix 6.
Consider a pin measuring 2.85 cm in length. What is its length in inches? To accom-
plish this conversion, we must use the equivalence statement
2.54 cm 5 1 in
If we divide both sides of this equation by 2.54 cm, we get
1 5
1 in
2.54 cm
This expression is called a unit factor. Since 1 inch and 2.54 cm are exactly equivalent, 
multiplying any expression by this unit factor will not change its value.
The pin has a length of 2.85 cm. Multiplying this length by the appropriate unit 
factor gives
2.85 cm 3
1 in
2.54 cm 5 2.85
2.54 in 5 1.12 in
Note that the centimeter units cancel to give inches for the result. This is exactly what 
we wanted to accomplish. Note also that the result has three significant figures, as 
required by the number 2.85. Recall that the 1 and 2.54 in the conversion factor are 
exact numbers by definition.

How do we get there?
Since we want to convert from inches to centimeters, we need the equivalence state-
ment 2.54 cm 5 1 in. The correct unit factor in this case is 2.54 cm
1 in
:
7.00 in 3 2.54 cm
1 in
5 17.002 12.542 cm 5 17.8 cm
Here the inch units cancel, leaving centimeters, as requested.
See Exercises 1.43 and 1.44
Note that two unit factors can be derived from each equivalence statement. For 
example, from the equivalence statement 2.54 cm 5 1 in, the two unit factors are
2.54 cm
1 in ¬†¬†and¬†¬†
1 in
2.54 cm
How do you choose which one to use in a given situation? Simply look at the direction 
of the required change. To change from inches to centimeters, the inches must cancel. 
Thus the factor 2.54 cm/1 in is used. To change from centimeters to inches, centime-
ters must cancel, and the factor 1 in/2.54 cm is appropriate.
PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY 
Converting from One Unit to Another
 
¬ª To convert from one unit to another, use the equivalence statement that relates 
the two units.
 
¬ª Derive the appropriate unit factor by looking at the direction of the required 
change (to cancel the unwanted units).
 
¬ª Multiply the quantity to be converted by the unit factor to give the quantity 
with the desired units.

To convert from inches to centimeters
What do we know?
‚ùØ The size needed is 25.5 in.
How do we get there?
Since we want to convert from inches to centimeters, we need the equivalence state-
ment 2.54 cm 5 1 in. The correct unit factor in this case is 2.54 cm
1 in
:
25.5 in 3 2.54 cm
1 in
5 64.8 cm
See Exercises 1.45 through 1.47
Consider the direction of the required 
change to select the correct unit factor.

To ensure that the conversion procedure is clear, a multistep problem is considered 
in Example 1.7.
Unit Conversions III
A student has entered a 10.0-km run. How long is the run in miles?
 
SOLUTION 
Where are we going?
To convert from kilometers to miles
What do we know?
‚ùØ The run is 10.00 km long.
How do we get there?
This conversion can be accomplished in several different ways. Since we have the 
equivalence statement 1 m 5 1.094 yd, we will proceed by a path that uses this fact. 
Before we start any calculations, let us consider our strategy. We have kilometers, 
which we want to change to miles. We can do this by the following route:
miles
meters
kilometers
yards
To proceed in this way, we need the following equivalence statements:
 1 k m 5 1000 m  
 1 m 5 1.094 yd

To make sure the process is clear, we will proceed step by step:
Kilometers to Meters
10.0 km 3 1000 m
1 km
5 1.00 3 104 m
Meters to Yards
1.00 3 104 m 3 1.094 yd
1 m
5 1.094 3 104 yd
Note that we should have only three significant figures in the result. However, since 
this is an intermediate result, we will carry the extra digit. Remember, round off only 
the final result.
Yards to Miles
1.094 3 104 yd 3
1 mi
1760 yd 5 6.216 mi
Note in this case that 1 mi equals exactly 1760 yd by designation. Thus 1760 is an 
 exact number.
 
Since the distance was originally given as 10.0 km, the result can have only three 
significant figures and should be rounded to 6.22 mi. Thus
10.0 km 5 6.22 mi
 
Alternatively, we can combine the steps:
10.0 km 3 1000 m

In using dimensional analysis, your verification that everything has been done cor-
rectly is that you end up with the correct units. In doing chemistry problems, you 
should always include the units for the quantities used. Always check to see that the 
units cancel to give the correct units for the final result. This provides a very valuable 
check, especially for complicated problems.
Study the procedures for unit conversions in the following examples.

1.8 Temperature
Three systems for measuring temperature are widely used: the Celsius scale, the 
Kelvin scale, and the Fahrenheit scale. The first two temperature systems are used in 
the physical sciences, and the third is used in many of the engineering sciences. Our 
purpose here is to define the three temperature scales and show how conversions from 
one scale to another can be performed. Although these conversions can be carried out 
routinely on most calculators, we will consider the process in some detail here to illus-
trate methods of  problem solving.
The three temperature scales are defined and compared in Fig. 1.9. Note that the 
size of the temperature unit (the degree) is the same for the Kelvin and Celsius scales. 
The fundamental difference between these two temperature scales is their zero points. 
 Conversion between these two scales simply requires an adjustment for the different 
zero points.
Temperature 1Kelvin2 5 temperature 1Celsius2 1 273.15
or
Temperature 1Celsius2 5 temperature 1Kelvin2 2 273.15
For example, to convert 300.00 K to the Celsius scale, we do the following 
calculation:
300.00 2 273.15 5 26.85¬∞C
Note that in expressing temperature in Celsius units, the designation 8C is used. The 
degree symbol is not used when writing temperature in terms of the Kelvin scale. The 
unit of temperature on this scale is called a kelvin and is symbolized by the letter K.
Converting between the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales is somewhat more compli-
cated because both the degree sizes and the zero points are different. Thus we need to 
consider two adjustments: one for degree size and one for the zero point. First, we

must account for the difference in degree size. This can be done by reconsidering 
Fig. 1.9. Notice that since 2128F 5 1008C and 328F 5 08C,
212 2 32 5 180 Fahrenheit degrees 5 100 2 0 5 100 Celsius degrees
Thus 1808 on the Fahrenheit scale is equivalent to 1008 on the Celsius scale, and the 
unit factor is
180¬∞F
100¬∞C  or  9¬∞F
5¬∞C
or the reciprocal, depending on the direction in which we need to go.
Next, we must consider the different zero points. Since 328F 5 08C, we obtain the 
corresponding Celsius temperature by first subtracting 32 from the Fahrenheit tem-
perature to account for the different zero points. Then the unit factor is applied to 
adjust for the difference in the degree size. This process is summarized by the 
equation
1TF 2 32¬∞F2  5¬∞C
9¬∞F 5 TC 
(1.1)
where TF and TC represent a given temperature on the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales, 
 respectively. In the opposite conversion, we first correct for degree size and then cor-
rect for the different zero point. This process can be summarized in the following 
 general equation:
 
TF 5 TC 3 9¬∞F
5¬∞C 1 32¬∞F 
(1.2)
Equations (1.1) and (1.2) are really the same equation in different forms. See if you 
can obtain Equation (1.2) by starting with Equation (1.1) and rearranging.
At this point it is worthwhile to weigh the two alternatives for learning to do tem-
perature conversions: You can simply memorize the equations, or you can take the 
time to learn the differences between the temperature scales and to understand the 
processes involved in converting from one scale to another. The latter approach may

take a little more effort, but the understanding you gain will stick with you much lon-
ger than the memorized formulas. This choice also will apply to many of the other 
chemical concepts. Try to think things through!
Temperature Conversions I
Normal body temperature is 98.68F. Convert this temperature to the Celsius and Kelvin 
scales.
 
SOLUTION 
Where are we going?
To convert the body temperature from degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius and to 
kelvins.
What do we know? 
‚ùØ The body temperature is 98.6¬∞F.
How do we get there?
Rather than simply using the formulas to solve this problem, we will proceed by think-
ing it through. The situation is diagramed in Fig. 1.10. First, we want to convert 98.68F 
to the Celsius scale. The number of Fahrenheit degrees between 32.08F and 98.68F is 
66.68F. We must convert this difference to Celsius degrees:
66.6¬∞F 3 5¬∞C
9¬∞F 5 37.0¬∞C
Thus 98.68F corresponds to 37.08C.
 
Now we can convert to the Kelvin scale:
TK 5 TC 1 273.15 5 37.0 1 273.15 5 310.2 K
Note that the final answer has only one decimal place (37.0 is limiting).

What do we know?
‚ùØ The relationship between the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales

The difference between 328F and 2408F is 728F. The difference between 08C and

as required. Thus 2408C is equivalent to 2408F.
See Exercise 1.65
Since, as shown in Example 1.12, 2408 on both the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales 
represents the same temperature, this point can be used as a reference point (like 08C 
and 328F) for a relationship between the two scales:

where TF and TC represent the same temperature (but not the same number). This equa-

may be easier to remember than Equations (1.1) and (1.2).

1.9 Density
A property of matter that is often used by chemists as an ‚Äúidentification tag‚Äù for a 
substance is density, the mass of substance per unit volume of the substance:
Density 5
mass
volume
The density of a liquid can be determined easily by weighing an accurately known 
volume of liquid. This procedure is illustrated in Example 1.14.
Determining Density
A chemist, trying to identify an unknown liquid, finds that 25.00 cm3 of the substance 
has a mass of 19.625 g at 208C. The following are the names and densities of the com-
pounds that might be the liquid:
Compound
Density in g/cm3 at 208C
Chloroform
1.492
Diethyl ether
0.714
Ethanol
0.789
Isopropyl alcohol
0.785
Toluene
0.867
Which of these compounds is the most likely to be the unknown liquid?
SOLUTION 
Where are we going?
To calculate the density of the unknown liquid
What do we know?
‚ùØ The mass of a given volume of the liquid.
How do we get there?
To identify the unknown substance, we must determine its density. This can be done 
by using the definition of density:
Density 5
mass
volume 5 19.625 g
25.00 cm3 5 0.7850 g/cm3
1.9
INTERACTIVE EXAMPLE 1.14
There are two ways of indicating units that 
occur in the denominator. For example, we 
can write g/cm3 or g cm23. Although we 
will use the former system here, the other 
system is widely used.
26

This density corresponds exactly to that of isopropyl alcohol, which therefore most 
likely is the unknown liquid. However, note that the density of ethanol is also very 
close. To be sure that the compound is isopropyl alcohol, we should run several more 
density experiments. (In the modern laboratory, many other types of tests could be 
done to distinguish between these two liquids.)
See Exercises 1.70 through 1.72  
Besides being a tool for the identification of substances, density has many other 
uses. For example, the liquid in your car‚Äôs lead storage battery (a solution of sulfuric 
acid) changes density because the sulfuric acid is consumed as the battery discharges. 
In a fully charged battery, the density of the solution is about 1.30 g/cm3. If the density 
falls below 1.20 g/cm3, the battery will have to be recharged. Density measurement is 
also used to determine the amount of antifreeze, and thus the level of protection against 
freezing, in the cooling system of a car.
The densities of various common substances are given in Table 1.5.

1.10 Classification of Matter
Before we can hope to understand the changes we see going on around us‚Äîthe growth 
of plants, the rusting of steel, the aging of people, the acidification of rain‚Äîwe must 
find out how matter is organized. Matter, best defined as anything occupying space 
and having mass, is the material of the universe. Matter is complex and has many lev-
els of organization. In this section we will introduce basic ideas about the structure of 
matter and its behavior.
We will start by considering the definitions of the fundamental properties of matter. 
Matter exists in three states: solid, liquid, and gas. A solid is rigid; it has a fixed vol-
ume and shape. A liquid has a definite volume but no specific shape; it assumes the 
shape of its container. A gas has no fixed volume or shape; it takes on the shape and 
volume of its container. In contrast to liquids and solids, which are only slightly com-
pressible, gases are highly compressible; it is relatively easy to decrease the volume of

a gas. Molecular-level pictures of the three states of water are given in Fig. 1.11. The 
different properties of ice, liquid water, and steam are determined by the different 
arrangements of the molecules in these substances. Table 1.5 gives the states of some 
common substances at 208C and 1 atmosphere pressure.
Most of the matter around us consists of mixtures of pure substances. Wood, gaso-
line, wine, soil, and air all are mixtures. The main characteristic of a mixture is that it 
has variable composition. For example, wood is a mixture of many substances, the 
proportions of which vary depending on the type of wood and where it grows. Mix-
tures can be classified as homogeneous (having visibly indistinguishable parts) or 
heterogeneous (having visibly distinguishable parts).
A homogeneous mixture is called a solution. Air is a solution consisting of a mixture 
of gases. Wine is a complex liquid solution. Brass is a solid solution of copper and zinc. 
Sand in water and iced tea with ice cubes are examples of heterogeneous mixtures. 
Heterogeneous mixtures usually can be separated into two or more homogeneous mix-
tures or pure substances (for example, the ice cubes can be separated from the tea).
Mixtures can be separated into pure substances by physical methods. A pure 
substance is one with constant composition. Water is a good illustration of these 
ideas. As we will discuss in detail later, pure water is composed solely of H2O mol-
ecules, but the water found in nature (groundwater or the water in a lake or ocean) 
is really a mixture. Seawater, for example, contains large amounts of dissolved 
minerals. Boiling seawater produces steam, which can be condensed to pure water, 
leaving the minerals behind as solids. The dissolved minerals in seawater also can 
be separated out by freezing the mixture, since pure water freezes out. The pro-
cesses of boiling and freezing are physical changes. When water freezes or boils, 
it changes its state but remains water; it is still composed of H2O molecules. A 
physical change is a change in the form of a substance, not in its chemical composi-
tion. A physical change can be used to separate a mixture into pure compounds, but 
it will not break compounds into elements.
One of the most important methods for separating the components of a mixture 
is distillation, a process that depends on differences in the volatility (how readily 
substances become gases) of the components. In simple distillation, a mixture is 
Solid: The water molecules are 
locked into rigid positions 
and are close together.
Liquid: The water molecules 
are still close together but can 
move around to some extent.
Gas: The water molecules are 
far apart and move randomly.

heated in a device such as that shown in Fig. 1.12. The most volatile component 
vaporizes at the lowest temperature, and the vapor passes through a cooled tube (a 
condenser), where it condenses back into its liquid state.
The simple, one-stage distillation apparatus shown in Fig. 1.12 works very well 
when only one component of the mixture is volatile. For example, a mixture of water 
and sand is easily separated by boiling off the water. Water containing dissolved min-
erals behaves in much the same way. As the water is boiled off, the minerals remain 
behind as nonvolatile solids. Simple distillation of seawater using the sun as the heat 
source is an excellent way to desalinate (remove the minerals from) seawater.
However, when a mixture contains several volatile components, the one-step distil-
lation does not give a pure substance in the receiving flask, and more elaborate meth-
ods are required.
Another method of separation is simple filtration, which is used when a mixture 
consists of a solid and a liquid. The mixture is poured onto a mesh, such as filter paper, 
which passes the liquid and leaves the solid behind.
A third method of separation is chromatography. Chromatography is the general 
name applied to a series of methods that use a system with two phases (states) of mat-
ter: a mobile phase and a stationary phase. The stationary phase is a solid, and the 
mobile phase is either a liquid or a gas. The separation process occurs because the 
components of the mixture have different affinities for the two phases and thus move 
through the system at different rates. A component with a high affinity for the mobile 
phase moves relatively quickly through the chromatographic system, whereas one 
with a high affinity for the solid phase moves more slowly.
One simple type of chromatography, paper chromatography, uses a strip of  
porous paper, such as filter paper, for the stationary phase. A drop of the mixture to  
be separated is placed on the paper, which is then dipped into a liquid (the mobile phase) 
that travels up the paper as though it were a wick (Fig. 1.13). This method of separating 
a mixture is often used by biochemists, who study the chemistry of living systems.
It should be noted that when a mixture is separated, the absolute purity of the separated 
components is an ideal. Because water, for example, inevitably comes into contact with 
other materials when it is synthesized or separated from a mixture, it is never absolutely 
pure. With great care, however, substances can be obtained in very nearly pure form.
The term volatile refers to the ease with 
which a substance can be changed to its 
vapor.

Pure substances are either compounds (combinations of elements) or free elements. 
A compound is a substance with constant composition that can be broken down into 
elements by chemical processes. An example of a chemical process is the electrolysis 
of water, in which an electric current is passed through water to break it down into the 
free elements hydrogen and oxygen. This process produces a chemical change because 
the water molecules have been broken down. The water is gone, and in its place we 
have the free elements hydrogen and oxygen. A chemical change is one in which a 
given substance becomes a new substance or substances with different properties and 
different composition. Elements are substances that cannot be decomposed into sim-
pler substances by chemical or physical means.
We have seen that the matter around us has various levels of organization. The most 
fundamental substances we have discussed so far are elements. As we will see in later 
chapters, elements also have structure: They are composed of atoms, which in turn are 
composed of nuclei and electrons. Even the nucleus has structure: It is composed of 
protons and neutrons. And even these can be broken down further, into elementary 
particles called quarks. However, we need not concern ourselves with such details at 
this point. Fig. 1.14 summarizes our discussion of the organization of matter.

‚ùØ Formulate hypotheses
‚ùØ Perform experiments
Models (theories) are explanations of why nature behaves in a 
particular way.
‚ùØ They are subject to modification over time and sometimes fail.
Quantitative observations are called measurements.
‚ùØ Measurements consist of a number and a unit.
‚ùØ Measurements involve some uncertainty.
‚ùØ Uncertainty is indicated by the use of significant figures.
‚ùØ Rules to determine significant figures
‚ùØ Calculations using significant figures
‚ùØ Preferred system is the SI system.

Challenge Problems
 117. A rule of thumb in designing experiments is to avoid using a 
 result that is the small difference between two large measured 
quantities. In terms of uncertainties in measurement, why is 
this good advice?
 118. Draw a picture showing the markings (graduations) on glass-
ware that would allow you to make each of the following vol-
ume measurements of water, and explain your answers (the 
numbers given are as precise as possible).

then poured all of the water together in one container, what total 
volume of water should you report? Support your answer.
 119. Many times errors are expressed in terms of percentage. The

made pennies? Explain.
b.  The person calculated the average mass of the 12 heavy 
pennies. He expressed this average as 3.0828 g 6 0.0482 g. 
What is wrong with the numbers in this result, and how 
should the value be expressed?
 109. The density of an irregularly shaped object was determined as 
follows. The mass of the object was found to be 28.90 g 6 
0.03 g. A graduated cylinder was partially filled with water.

The object was dropped in the cylinder, and the level of the 
water rose to 9.8 cm3 6 0.1 cm3. What is the density of the 
object with appropriate error limits? (See Appendix 1.5.)
 110. The chemist in Example 1.14 did some further experiments. 
She found that the pipet used to measure the volume of the

accurate to 60.002 g. Are these measurements sufficiently 
precise for the chemist to distinguish between isopropyl alco-
hol and ethanol?

 126. An experiment was performed in which an empty 100-mL 
graduated cylinder was weighed. It was weighed once again 
after it had been filled to the 10.0-mL mark with dry sand. A 
10-mL pipet was used to transfer 10.00 mL of methanol to the 
cylinder. The sand‚Äìmethanol mixture was stirred until bubbles 
no longer emerged from the mixture and the sand looked uni-
formly wet. The cylinder was then weighed again. Use the 
data obtained from this experiment (and displayed at the end 
of this problem) to find the density of the dry sand, the density 
of methanol, and the density of sand particles. Does the bub-
bling that occurs when the methanol is added to the dry sand 
indicate that the sand and methanol are reacting?

 121. On October 21, 1982, the Bureau of the Mint changed the 
composition of pennies (see Exercise 120). Instead of an 
alloy of 95% Cu and 5% Zn by mass, a core of 99.2% Zn and 
0.8% Cu with a thin shell of copper was adopted. The overall 
composition of the new penny was 97.6% Zn and 2.4% Cu 
by mass. Does this account for the difference in mass among 
the pennies in Exercise 120? Assume the volume of the indi-
vidual metals that make up each penny can be added together 
to give the overall volume of the penny, and assume each 
penny is the same size. (Density of Cu 5 8.96 g/cm3; density 
of Zn 5 7.14 g/cm3.)

here does one start in learning chemistry? Clearly we must consider 
some essential vocabulary and something about the origins of the sci-
ence before we can proceed very far. Thus, while Chapter 1 provided background on 
the fundamental ideas and  procedures of science in general, Chapter 2 covers the 
specific chemical background necessary for understanding the material in the next 
few chapters. The coverage of these topics is necessarily brief at this point. We will 
develop these ideas more fully as it becomes appropriate to do so. A major goal of 
this chapter is to present the systems for naming chemical compounds to provide 
you with the vocabulary necessary to understand this book and to pursue your labo-
ratory studies.
Because chemistry is concerned first and foremost with chemical changes, we will 
proceed as quickly as possible to a study of chemical reactions (Chapters 3 and 4). 
However, before we can discuss reactions, we must consider some fundamental ideas 
about atoms and how they combine.
2.1 The Early History of Chemistry
Chemistry has been important since ancient times. The processing of natural ores to 
produce metals for ornaments and weapons and the use of embalming fluids are just 
two applications of chemical phenomena that were utilized prior to 1000 b.c.
The Greeks were the first to try to explain why chemical changes occur. By about 
400 b.c. they had proposed that all matter was composed of four fundamental sub-
stances: fire, earth, water, and air. The Greeks also considered the question of whether 
matter is continuous, and thus infinitely divisible into smaller pieces, or composed of 
small, indivisible particles. Supporters of the latter position were Demokritos* of 
Abdera (c. 460‚Äìc. 370 b.c.) and Leucippos, who used the term atomos (which later 
became atoms) to describe these ultimate particles. However, because the Greeks had 
no experiments to test their ideas, no definitive conclusion could be reached about the 
divisibility of matter.
The next 2000 years of chemical history were dominated by a pseudoscience called 
alchemy. Some alchemists were mystics and fakes who were obsessed with the idea of 
turning cheap metals into gold. However, many alchemists were serious scientists, and 
this period saw important advances: The alchemists discovered several elements and 
learned to prepare the mineral acids.
The foundations of modern chemistry were laid in the sixteenth century with 
the  development of systematic metallurgy (extraction of metals from ores) by a 
German, Georg Bauer (1494‚Äì1555), and the medicinal application of minerals by a 
Swiss  alchemist/physician known as Paracelsus (full name: Philippus Theophrastus 
Bombastus von Hohenheim [1493‚Äì1541]).
The first ‚Äúchemist‚Äù to perform truly quantitative experiments was Robert Boyle 
(1627‚Äì1691), who carefully measured the relationship between the pressure and volume 
of air. When Boyle published his book The Skeptical Chymist in 1661, the quantitative 
sciences of physics and chemistry were born. In addition to his results on the quantita-
tive behavior of gases, Boyle‚Äôs other major contribution to chemistry consisted of his 
ideas about the chemical elements. Boyle held no preconceived notion about the num-
ber of elements. In his view, a substance was an element unless it could be broken 
down into two or more simpler substances. As Boyle‚Äôs experimental definition of an 
element became generally accepted, the list of known elements began to grow, and the 
Greek system of four elements finally died. Although Boyle was an excellent scientist, 
he was not always right. For example, he clung to the alchemists‚Äô views that metals 
were not true elements and that a way would eventually be found to change one metal 
into another.

The phenomenon of combustion evoked intense interest in the seventeenth and 
eighteenth centuries. The German chemist Georg Stahl (1660‚Äì1734) suggested that a 
substance he called ‚Äúphlogiston‚Äù flowed out of the burning material. Stahl postulated 
that a substance burning in a closed container eventually stopped burning because the 
air in the container became saturated with phlogiston. Oxygen gas, discovered by 
Joseph Priestley (1733‚Äì1804),* an English clergyman and scientist (Fig. 2.1), was 
found to support vigorous combustion and was thus supposed to be low in phlogiston. 
In fact, oxygen was originally called ‚Äúdephlogisticated air.‚Äù
2.2 Fundamental Chemical Laws
By the late eighteenth century, combustion had been studied extensively; the gases 
carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen had been discovered; and the list of 
elements continued to grow. However, it was Antoine Lavoisier (1743‚Äì1794), a French 
chemist (Fig. 2.2), who finally explained the true nature of combustion, thus clearing 
the way for the tremendous progress that was made near the end of the eighteenth 
century. Lavoisier, like Boyle, regarded measurement as the essential operation of 
chemistry. His experiments, in which he carefully weighed the reactants and products 
of various reactions, suggested that mass is neither created nor destroyed. Lavoisier‚Äôs 
*Oxygen gas was actually first observed by the Swedish chemist Karl W. Scheele (1742‚Äì1786), 
but because his results were published after Priestley‚Äôs, the latter is commonly credited with the 
discovery of oxygen.

FIGURE 2.2 Antoine Lavoisier was 
born in Paris on August 26, 1743. Although 
Lavoisier‚Äôs  father wanted his son to follow 
him into the legal profession, young 
Lavoisier was fascinated by science. From 
the beginning of his scientific career, 
Lavoisier recognized the importance of 
accurate measurements. His careful 
weighings showed that mass is conserved 
in chemical reactions and that combus-
tion involves reaction with oxygen. Also, 
he wrote the first modern chemistry text-
book. It is not surprising that Lavoisier is 
often called the father of modern 
chemistry.
 
To help support his scientific work, 
Lavoisier invested in a private tax-
collecting firm and married the daughter 
of one of the company executives. His 
connection to the tax collectors proved 
fatal, for radical French revolutionaries 
demanded his execution, which occurred 
on the guillotine on May 8, 1794.
FIGURE 2.1 The Priestley Medal is the highest honor given by the American Chemical Society. 
It is named for Joseph Priestley, who was born in England on March 13, 1733. He performed many 
important scientific experiments, among them the discovery that a gas later identified as carbon 
dioxide could be dissolved in water to produce seltzer. Also, as a result of meeting Benjamin Franklin 
in London in 1766, Priestley became interested in electricity and was the first to observe that graphite 
was an electrical conductor. However, his greatest discovery occurred in 1774 when he isolated 
oxygen by heating mercuric oxide.
 
Because of his nonconformist political views, Priestley was forced to leave England. He died in 
the United States in 1804.

verification of this law of conservation of mass was the basis for the developments in 
chemistry in the nineteenth century. Mass is neither created nor destroyed in a 
chemical reaction.
 
Lavoisier‚Äôs quantitative experiments showed that combustion involved oxygen 
(which Lavoisier named), not phlogiston. He also discovered that life was supported 
by a process that also involved oxygen and was similar in many ways to combustion. 
In 1789 Lavoisier published the first modern chemistry textbook, Elementary Treatise 
on Chemistry, in which he presented a unified picture of the chemical knowledge 
assembled up to that time.  Unfortunately, in the same year the text was published, the 
French Revolution broke out. Lavoisier, who had been associated with collecting taxes 
for the government, was executed on the guillotine as an enemy of the people in 1794.
 
After 1800, chemistry was dominated by scientists who, following Lavoisier‚Äôs lead, 
performed careful weighing experiments to study the course of chemical reactions and 
to determine the composition of various chemical compounds. One of these chemists, 
a Frenchman, Joseph Proust (1754‚Äì1826), showed that a given compound always con-
tains exactly the same proportion of elements by mass. For example, Proust found that 
the substance copper carbonate is always 5.3 parts copper to 4 parts oxygen to 1 part 
carbon (by mass). The principle of the constant composition of compounds, originally 
called ‚ÄúProust‚Äôs law,‚Äù is now known as the law of definite proportion. A given com-
pound always contains exactly the same proportion of elements by mass.
 
Proust‚Äôs discovery stimulated John Dalton (1766‚Äì1844), an English schoolteacher 
(Fig. 2.3), to think about atoms as the particles that might compose elements. Dalton 
reasoned that if elements were composed of tiny individual particles, a given compound 
should always contain the same combination of these atoms. This concept explained 
why the same relative masses of elements were always found in a given compound.
 
But Dalton discovered another principle that convinced him even more of the exis-
tence of atoms. He noted, for example, that carbon and oxygen form two different 
compounds that contain different relative amounts of carbon and oxygen, as shown by 
the  following data:
Mass of Oxygen That 
Combines with 1 g of Carbon
Compound I
1.33 g
Compound II
2.66 g
Dalton noted that compound II contains twice as much oxygen per gram of carbon as 
compound I, a fact that could easily be explained in terms of atoms. Compound I might 
be CO, and compound II might be CO2.* This principle, which was found to apply to 
compounds of other elements as well, became known as the law of multiple propor-
tions: When two elements form a series of compounds, the ratios of the masses of 
the second element that combine with 1 g of the first element can always be 
reduced to small whole numbers.
Oxygen is from the French oxyg√®ne, 
meaning ‚Äúgenerator of acid,‚Äù because it was 
initially considered to be an integral part 
of all acids.
*Subscripts are used to show the numbers of atoms present. The number 1 is understood (not writ-
ten). The symbols for the elements and the writing of chemical formulas will be illustrated further 
in Sections 2.6 and 2.7.
FIGURE 2.3 John Dalton (1766‚Äì1844), an Englishman, began teaching at a Quaker school 
when he was 12. His fascination with science included an intense interest in meteorology, which led 
to an interest in the gases of the air and their ultimate components, atoms. Dalton is best known for 
his atomic theory, in which he postulated that the fundamental differences among atoms are their 
masses. He was the first to prepare a table of relative atomic weights.
 
Dalton was a humble man with several apparent handicaps: He was not articulate and he was 
color-blind, a terrible problem for a chemist. Despite these disadvantages, he helped to revolu-
tionize the science of chemistry.

To make sure the significance of this observation is clear, in Example 2.1 we will 
consider data for a series of compounds consisting of nitrogen and oxygen.
Illustrating the Law of Multiple Proportions
The following data were collected for several compounds of nitrogen and oxygen:
Mass of Nitrogen That 
Combines with 1 g of Oxygen
Compound A
1.750 g
Compound B
0.8750 g
Compound C
0.4375 g
Show how these data illustrate the law of multiple proportions.
 
SOLUTION 
For the law of multiple proportions to hold, the ratios of the masses of nitrogen combin-
ing with 1 g of oxygen in each pair of compounds should be small whole numbers. 
We therefore compute the ratios as follows:
 A
B 5 1.750
0.8750 5 2
1
 B
C 5 0.8750
0.4375 5 2
1
 A
C 5 1.750
0.4375 5 4
1
These results support the law of multiple proportions.
See Exercises 2.41 and 2.42
 
The significance of the data in Example 2.1 is that compound A contains twice as 
much nitrogen (N) per gram of oxygen (O) as does compound B and that compound B 
contains twice as much nitrogen per gram of oxygen as does compound C.
 
These data can be explained readily if the substances are composed of molecules 
made up of nitrogen atoms and oxygen atoms. For example, one set of possibilities for 
compounds A, B, and C is
A:
N
O
=
2
1
C:
N
O
=
1
2
B:
N
O
=
1
1
Now we can see that compound A contains two atoms of N for every atom of O, whereas 
compound B contains one atom of N per atom of O. That is, compound A contains twice 
as much nitrogen per given amount of oxygen as does compound B. Similarly, since com-
pound B contains one N per O and compound C contains one N per two Os, the nitrogen 
content of compound C per given amount of oxygen is half that of compound B.
 
Another set of compounds that fits the data in Example 2.1 is
A:
N
O
=
1
2
C:
N
O
=
1
4
B:
N
O
=
1

Verify for yourself that these compounds satisfy the requirements.

Still another set that works is

=

C:

B:

See if you can come up with still another set of compounds that satisfies the data in 
Example 2.1. How many more possibilities are there?
In fact, an infinite number of other possibilities exists. Dalton could not deduce 
absolute formulas from the available data on relative masses. However, the data on the 
composition of compounds in terms of the relative masses of the elements supported 
his hypothesis that each element consisted of a certain type of atom and that com-
pounds were formed from specific combinations of atoms.
2.3 Dalton‚Äôs Atomic Theory
In 1808 Dalton published A New System of Chemical Philosophy, in which he pre-
sented his theory of atoms:
Dalton‚Äôs Atomic Theory
1. Each element is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
2. The atoms of a given element are identical; the atoms of different elements are different 
in some fundamental way or ways.
3. Chemical compounds are formed when atoms of different elements combine with 
each other. A given compound always has the same relative numbers and types of 
atoms.
4. Chemical reactions involve reorganization of the atoms‚Äîchanges in the way they are 
bound together. The atoms themselves are not changed in a chemical reaction.
It is instructive to consider Dalton‚Äôs reasoning on the relative masses of the 
atoms of the various elements. In Dalton‚Äôs time water was known to be composed 
of the elements hydrogen and oxygen, with 8 g of oxygen present for every 1 g of 
hydrogen. If the formula for water were OH, an oxygen atom would have to have 8 
times the mass of a hydrogen atom. However, if the formula for water were H2O 
(two atoms of hydrogen for every oxygen atom), this would mean that each atom of 
oxygen is 16 times as massive as each atom of hydrogen (since the ratio of the mass 
of one oxygen to that of two hydrogens is 8 to 1). Because the formula for water 
was not then known, Dalton could not specify the relative masses of oxygen and 
hydrogen unambiguously. To solve the  problem, Dalton made a fundamental 
assumption: He decided that nature would be as simple as possible. This assump-
tion led him to conclude that the formula for water should be OH. He thus assigned 
hydrogen a mass of 1 and oxygen a mass of 8.
 
Using similar reasoning for other compounds, Dalton prepared the first table of 
atomic masses (sometimes called atomic weights by chemists, since mass is often 
determined by comparison to a standard mass‚Äîa process called weighing). Many of 
the masses were later proved to be wrong because of Dalton‚Äôs incorrect assumptions 
about the formulas of certain compounds, but the construction of a table of masses was 
an important step forward.
 
Although not recognized as such for many years, the keys to determining absolute 
formulas for compounds were provided in the experimental work of the French chem-
ist Joseph Gay-Lussac (1778‚Äì1850) and by the hypothesis of an Italian chemist named 
2.3
These statements are a modern paraphrase 
of Dalton‚Äôs ideas.

Amadeo Avogadro (1776‚Äì1856). In 1809 Gay-Lussac performed experiments in 
which he measured (under the same conditions of temperature and pressure) the vol-
ume of gases that reacted with each other. For example, Gay-Lussac found that 2 vol-
umes of hydrogen react with 1 volume of oxygen to form 2 volumes of gaseous water 
and that 1 volume of hydrogen reacts with 1 volume of chlorine to form 2 volumes of 
hydrogen chloride. These results are represented schematically in Fig. 2.4.
 
In 1811 Avogadro interpreted these results by proposing that at the same tempera-
ture and pressure, equal volumes of different gases contain the same number of parti-
cles. This assumption (called Avogadro‚Äôs hypothesis) makes sense if the distances 
between the particles in a gas are very great compared with the sizes of the particles. 
Under these conditions, the volume of a gas is determined by the number of molecules 
present, not by the size of the individual particles.
 
If Avogadro‚Äôs hypothesis is correct, Gay-Lussac‚Äôs result,
2 volumes of hydrogen react with 1 volume of oxygen 8n 2 volumes of water vapor
can be expressed as follows:
2 molecules* of hydrogen react with 1 molecule of oxygen 8n 2 molecules of water
These observations can best be explained by assuming that gaseous hydrogen, oxygen, 
and chlorine are all composed of diatomic (two-atom) molecules: H2, O2, and Cl2, 
 respectively. Gay-Lussac‚Äôs results can then be represented as shown in Fig. 2.5. (Note 
that this reasoning suggests that the formula for water is H2O, not OH as Dalton believed.)
Unfortunately, Avogadro‚Äôs interpretations were not accepted by most chemists, and 
a half-century of confusion followed, in which many different assumptions were made 
about formulas and atomic masses.
During the nineteenth century, painstaking measurements were made of the masses 
of various elements that combined to form compounds. From these experiments a list 
of relative atomic masses could be determined. One of the chemists involved in con-
tributing to this list was a Swede named J√∂ns Jakob Berzelius (1779‚Äì1848), who 
*A molecule is a collection of atoms (see Section 2.6).
There are seven elements that occur as 
diatomic molecules:
H2, N2, O2, F2, Cl2, Br2, I2
‚óÄ
Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, a French physicist and chemist, was remarkably versatile. Although he 
is now known primarily for his studies on the combining of volumes of gases, Gay-Lussac was 
instrumental in the studies of many of the other properties of gases. Some of Gay-Lussac‚Äôs moti-
vation to learn about gases arose from his passion for ballooning. In fact, he made ascents to 
heights of over 4 miles to collect air samples, setting altitude records that stood for about 50 
years. Gay-Lussac also was the codiscoverer of boron and the developer of a process for manu-
facturing sulfuric acid. As chief assayer of the French mint, Gay-Lussac developed many tech-
niques for chemical analysis and invented many types of glassware now used routinely in labs. 
Gay-Lussac spent his last 20 years as a lawmaker in the French government.

discovered the elements cerium, selenium, silicon, and thorium and developed the 
modern symbols for the elements used in writing the formulas of compounds.
2.4 Early Experiments to 
Characterize the Atom
On the basis of the work of Dalton, Gay-Lussac, Avogadro, and others, chemistry was 
beginning to make sense. The concept of atoms was clearly a good idea. Inevitably, 
scientists began to wonder about the nature of the atom. What is an atom made of, and 
how do the atoms of the various elements differ?
2.4
J
√∂ns Jakob Berzelius was probably 
the best experimental chemist of  
his generation and, given the crude-
ness of his laboratory equipment, 
maybe the best of all time. Unlike 
Lavoisier, who could  afford to buy the 
best laboratory equipment available, 
Berzelius worked with minimal equip-
ment in very plain  surroundings. One 
of Berzelius‚Äôs students described the 
Swedish chemist‚Äôs workplace: ‚ÄúThe 
laboratory consisted of two ordinary 
rooms with the very simplest arrange-
ments; there were neither furnaces nor 
hoods, neither water system nor gas. 
Against the walls stood some closets 
with the chemicals, in the middle the 
 mercury trough and the blast lamp 
table.  Beside this was the sink consist-
ing of a stone water holder with a 
stopcock and a pot standing under it. 
[Next door in the kitchen] stood a 
small heating furnace.‚Äù
In these simple facilities, Berzelius 
performed more than 2000 experi-
ments over a 10-year period to deter-
mine accurate atomic masses for the 
50 elements then known. His success 
can be seen from the data in the table 
at right. These remarkably accurate 
values attest to his experimental skills 
and patience.
Besides his table of atomic 
masses, Berzelius made many other 
major contributions to chemistry. 
The most important of these was the 
invention of a simple set of symbols 
for the elements along with a sys-
tem for writing the formulas of 
compounds to replace the awkward 
symbolic representations of the 
alchemists. Although some chem-
ists, including Dalton, objected to 
the new system, it was gradually 
adopted and forms the basis of the 
system we use today.
In addition to these accomplish-
ments, Berzelius discovered the ele-
ments cerium, thorium, selenium, and 
 silicon. Of these elements, selenium

The Electron
The first important experiments that led to an understanding of the composition of the 
atom were done by the English physicist J. J. Thomson (Fig. 2.6), who studied electrical 
discharges in partially evacuated tubes called cathode-ray tubes (Fig. 2.7) during the 
period from 1898 to 1903. Thomson found that when high voltage was applied to the 
tube, a ‚Äúray‚Äù he called a cathode ray (because it emanated from the negative electrode, 
or cathode) was produced. Because this ray was produced at the negative electrode and 
was repelled by the negative pole of an applied electric field (Fig. 2.8), Thomson postu-
lated that the ray was a stream of negatively charged particles, now called electrons. 
From experiments in which he measured the deflection of the beam of electrons in a 
magnetic field, Thomson determined the charge-to-mass ratio of an electron:
e
m 5 21.76 3 108 C/g
where e represents the charge on the electron in coulombs (C) and m represents the elec-
tron mass in grams.
and silicon are particularly important 
in today‚Äôs world. Berzelius discovered 
 selenium in 1817 in connection with his 
studies of sulfuric acid. For years sele-
nium‚Äôs toxicity has been known, but 
only  recently have we become aware 
that it may have a positive effect on 
human health. Studies have shown 
that trace amounts of selenium in the 
diet may protect people from heart 
disease and cancer. One study based 
on data from 27 countries showed an 
inverse relationship between the 
cancer death rate and the selenium 
content of soil in a particular region 
(low cancer death rate in areas with 
high selenium content). Another 
research paper reported an inverse 
relationship between the selenium 
content of the blood and the inci-
dence of breast cancer in women. A 
study reported in 1998 used the toe-
nail clippings of 33,737 men to show 
that selenium seems to protect 
against prostate cancer. Selenium is 
also found in the heart muscle and 
may play an important role in proper 
heart function. Because of these and 
other studies, selenium‚Äôs reputation 
has improved, and many scientists are 
now studying its function in the 
human body.
Silicon is the second most abun-
dant element in the earth‚Äôs crust, 
exceeded only by oxygen. As we will 
see in Chapter 10, compounds involv-
ing silicon bonded to oxygen make 
up most of the earth‚Äôs sand, rock, and 
soil. Berzelius prepared silicon in its 
pure form in 1824 by heating silicon 
tetrafluoride (SiF4) with potassium 
metal. Today, silicon forms the basis 
for the modern microelectronics 
industry centered near San Francisco 
in a place that has come to be known 
as ‚ÄúSilicon Valley.‚Äù The technology of 
the silicon chip (see figure) with its 
printed  circuits has transformed com-
puters from room-sized monsters with 
thousands of unreliable vacuum tubes 
to desktop and notebook-sized units 
with trouble-free ‚Äúsolid-state‚Äù 
circuitry.

One of Thomson‚Äôs primary goals in his cathode-ray tube experiments was to gain 
an understanding of the structure of the atom. He reasoned that since electrons could 
be produced from electrodes made of various types of metals, all atoms must contain 
electrons. Since atoms were known to be electrically neutral, Thomson further assumed 
that atoms also must contain some positive charge. Thomson postulated that an atom 
consisted of a diffuse cloud of positive charge with the negative electrons embedded 
randomly in it. This model, shown in Fig. 2.9, is often called the plum pudding model 
because the electrons are like raisins dispersed in a pudding (the positive charge cloud), 
as in plum pudding, a favorite English dessert.
 
In 1909 Robert Millikan (1868‚Äì1953), working at the University of Chicago, per-
formed very clever experiments involving charged oil drops. These experiments 
allowed him to determine the magnitude of the electron charge (Fig. 2.10). With this 
value and the charge-to-mass ratio determined by Thomson, Millikan was able to cal-
culate the mass of the electron as 9.11 3 10231 kg.
Radioactivity
In the late nineteenth century, scientists discovered that certain elements produce high-
energy radiation. For example, in 1896 the French scientist Henri Becquerel found 
accidentally that a piece of a mineral containing uranium could produce its image on 
a photographic plate in the absence of light. He attributed this phenomenon to a spon-
taneous emission of radiation by the uranium, which he called radioactivity. Studies 
in the early twentieth century demonstrated three types of radioactive emission: 
gamma (g) rays, beta (b) particles, and alpha (a) particles. A g ray is high-energy 
‚Äúlight‚Äù; a b particle is a high-speed electron; and an a particle has a 21 charge, that is, 
a charge twice that of the electron and with the opposite sign. The mass of an a particle

is 7300 times that of the electron. More modes of radioactivity are now known, and we 
will discuss them in Chapter 19. Here we will consider only a particles because they 
were used in some crucial early experiments.
The Nuclear Atom
In 1911 Ernest Rutherford (Fig. 2.11), who performed many of the pioneering experi-
ments to explore radioactivity, carried out an experiment to test Thomson‚Äôs plum pud-
ding model. The experiment involved directing a particles at a thin sheet of metal foil, 
as illustrated in Fig. 2.12. Rutherford reasoned that if Thomson‚Äôs model were accurate, 
the massive a particles should crash through the thin foil like cannonballs through 
gauze, as shown in Fig. 2.13(a). He expected the a particles to travel through the foil 
with, at the most, very minor deflections in their paths. The results of the experiment

The fall of charged oil droplets due to gravity can be halted by adjusting the voltage across the two plates. This voltage and 
the mass of the oil drop can then be used to calculate the charge on the oil drop. Millikan‚Äôs experiments showed that the 
charge on an oil drop is always a whole-number multiple of the electron charge. (b) A photograph of Millikan‚Äôs apparatus.
FIGURE 2.11 Ernest Rutherford (1871‚Äì1937) was born on a farm in New Zealand. In 1895 he 
placed second in a scholarship competition to attend Cambridge University but was awarded the 
scholarship when the winner decided to stay home and get married. As a scientist in England, 
 Rutherford did much of the early work on characterizing radioactivity. He named the a and b parti-
cles and the g ray and coined the term half-life to describe an important attribute of radioactive 
elements. His experiments on the behavior of a particles striking thin metal foils led him to postu-
late the nuclear atom. He also invented the name proton for the nucleus of the hydrogen atom. He 
received the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1908.

were very  different from those Rutherford anticipated. Although most of the a parti-
cles passed straight through, many of the particles were deflected at large angles, as 
shown in Fig. 2.13(b), and some were reflected, never hitting the detector. This out-
come was a great surprise to Rutherford. (He wrote that this result was comparable 
with shooting a howitzer at a piece of paper and having the shell reflected back.)
Rutherford knew from these results that the plum pudding model for the atom could 
not be correct. The large deflections of the a particles could be caused only by a center 
of concentrated positive charge that contains most of the atom‚Äôs mass, as illustrated in 
Fig. 2.13(b). Most of the a particles pass directly through the foil because the atom is 
mostly open space. The deflected a particles are those that had a ‚Äúclose encounter‚Äù 
with the massive positive center of the atom, and the few reflected a particles are those 
that made a ‚Äúdirect hit‚Äù on the much more massive positive center.
In Rutherford‚Äôs mind these results could be explained only in terms of a nuclear 
atom‚Äîan atom with a dense center of positive charge (the nucleus) with electrons mov-
ing around the nucleus at a distance that is large relative to the nuclear radius.
CRITICAL THINKING You have learned about three different 
models of the atom: Dalton‚Äôs model, Thomson‚Äôs model, and Rutherford‚Äôs 
model. What if Dalton was correct? What would Rutherford have expected 
from his experiments with gold foil? What if Thomson was correct? What would 
Rutherford have expected from his experiments with gold foil?
 
2.5  The Modern View of Atomic 
Structure: An Introduction
In the years since Thomson and Rutherford, a great deal has been learned about atomic 
structure. Because much of this material will be covered in detail in later chapters, 
only an introduction will be given here. The simplest view of the atom is that it con-
sists of a tiny nucleus (with a diameter of about 10213 cm) and electrons that move 
about the  nucleus at an average distance of about 1028 cm from it (Fig. 2.14).
 
As we will see later, the chemistry of an atom mainly results from its electrons. For 
this reason, chemists can be satisfied with a relatively crude nuclear model. The nucleus 
is assumed to contain protons, which have a positive charge equal in magnitude to the 
electron‚Äôs negative charge, and neutrons, which have virtually the same mass as a proton

but no charge. The masses and charges of the electron, proton, and neutron are shown in 
Table 2.1.
Two striking things about the nucleus are its small size compared with the overall 
size of the atom and its extremely high density. The tiny nucleus accounts for almost all 
the atom‚Äôs mass. Its great density is dramatically demonstrated by the fact that a piece 
of nuclear material about the size of a pea would have a mass of 250 million tons!
An important question to consider at this point is, ‚ÄúIf all atoms are composed of these 
same components, why do different atoms have different chemical properties?‚Äù The 
answer to this question lies in the number and the arrangement of the electrons. The 
electrons constitute most of the atomic volume and thus are the parts that ‚Äúintermingle‚Äù 
when atoms combine to form molecules. Therefore, the number of electrons possessed 
by a given atom greatly affects its ability to interact with other atoms. As a result, the 
atoms of different elements, which have different numbers of protons and electrons, 
show different chemical behavior.
 
A sodium atom has 11 protons in its nucleus. Since atoms have no net charge, the 
number of electrons must equal the number of protons. Therefore, a sodium atom has 
11 electrons moving around its nucleus. It is always true that a sodium atom has 
11 protons and 11 electrons. However, each sodium atom also has neutrons in its 
nucleus, and different types of sodium atoms exist that have different numbers of neu-
trons. For example, consider the sodium atoms represented in Fig. 2.15. These two 
atoms are isotopes, or atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of 
neutrons. Note that the symbol for one particular type of sodium atom is written

where the atomic number Z (number of protons) is written as a subscript, and the mass 
number A (the total number of protons and neutrons) is written as a superscript. (The 
 particular atom represented here is called ‚Äúsodium twenty-three.‚Äù It has 11 electrons,  
11 protons, and 12 neutrons.) Because the chemistry of an atom is due to its electrons, 
The chemistry of an atom arises from its 
electrons.

isotopes show almost identical chemical properties. In nature most elements contain mix-
tures of isotopes.
CRITICAL THINKING The average diameter of an atom is  
2 3 10210 m. What if the average diameter of an atom were 1 cm? How tall  
would you be?
Writing the Symbols for Atoms
Write the symbol for the atom that has an atomic number of 9 and a mass number of 19. 
How many electrons and how many neutrons does this atom have?
SOLUTION
The atomic number 9 means the atom has 9 protons. This element is called fluorine,
symbolized by F. The atom is represented as
19
9F
and is called fluorine nineteen. Since the atom has 9 protons, it also must have 9 elec-
trons to achieve electrical neutrality. The mass number gives the total number of pro-
tons and neutrons, which means that this atom has 10 neutrons.
See Exercises 2.61 through 2.66
2.6 Molecules and Ions
From a chemist‚Äôs viewpoint, the most interesting characteristic of an atom is its ability to 
combine with other atoms to form compounds. It was John Dalton who first recognized 
that chemical compounds are collections of atoms, but he could not determine the struc-
ture of atoms or their means for binding to each other. During the twentieth century, we 
learned that atoms have electrons and that these electrons participate in bonding one 
atom to another. We will discuss bonding thoroughly in Chapters 8 and 9; here, we will 
introduce some simple bonding ideas that will be useful in the next few chapters.
The forces that hold atoms together in compounds are called chemical bonds. 
One way that atoms can form bonds is by sharing electrons. These bonds are called 
covalent bonds, and the resulting collection of atoms is called a molecule. Mole-
cules can be represented in several different ways. The simplest method is the 
chemical formula, in which the symbols for the elements are used to indicate the 
types of atoms present and subscripts are used to indicate the relative numbers of 
atoms. For example, the formula for carbon dioxide is CO2, meaning that each mole-
cule contains 1 atom of carbon and 2 atoms of oxygen.
 
Examples of molecules that contain covalent bonds are hydrogen (H2), water (H2O), 
oxygen (O2), ammonia (NH3), and methane (CH4). More information about a molecule 
is given by its structural formula, in which the individual bonds are shown (indicated 
by lines). Structural formulas may or may not indicate the actual shape of the mole-
cule. For example, water might be represented as
H
O
H
H

or
The structure on the right shows the actual shape of the water molecule. Scientists 
know from experimental evidence that the molecule looks like this. (We will study the 
shapes of molecules further in Chapter 8.)

The structural formula for ammonia is shown in the margin at left. Note that 
atoms connected to the central atom by dashed lines are behind the plane of the 
paper, and atoms connected to the central atom by wedges are in front of the plane 
of the paper.
 
In a compound composed of molecules, the individual molecules move around as 
independent units. For example, a molecule of methane gas can be represented in 
several ways. The structural formula for methane (CH4) is shown in Fig. 2.16(a). The 
space-filling model of methane, which shows the relative sizes of the atoms as well 
as their relative orientation in the molecule, is given in Fig. 2.16(b). Ball-and-stick 
models are also used to represent molecules. The ball-and-stick structure of methane 
is shown in Fig. 2.16(c).
 
A second type of chemical bond results from attractions among ions. An ion is an 
atom or group of atoms that has a net positive or negative charge. The best-known 
ionic compound is common table salt, or sodium chloride, which forms when neutral 
chlorine and sodium react.
 
To see how the ions are formed, consider what happens when an electron is transferred 
from a sodium atom to a chlorine atom (the neutrons in the nuclei will be ignored):
Neutral sodium

11 electrons
Sodium ion
(Na+)

10 electrons
Minus 1 electron
With one electron stripped off, the sodium, with its 11 protons and only 10 electrons, 
now has a net 11 charge‚Äîit has become a positive ion. A positive ion is called a  
cation. The sodium ion is written as Na1, and the process can be represented in short-
hand form as
Na h Na1 1 e2
Ammonia
H

Na1 is usually called the sodium ion rather 
than the sodium cation. Also Cl2 is called 
the chloride ion rather than the chloride 
anion. In general, when a specific ion is 
referred to, the word ion rather than cation 
or anion is used.

the 18 electrons produce a net 12 charge; the chlorine has become an ion with a nega-
tive charge‚Äîan anion. The chloride ion is written as Cl2, and the process is repre-
sented as
Cl 1 e2 h Cl2
 
Because anions and cations have opposite charges, they attract each other. This 
force of attraction between oppositely charged ions is called ionic bonding. As

Cl2 molecules) react to form solid sodium chloride, which contains many Na1 and 
Cl2 ions packed together and forms the beautiful colorless cubic crystals.
 
A solid consisting of oppositely charged ions is called an ionic solid. Ionic sol-
ids can consist of simple ions, as in sodium chloride, or of polyatomic (many atom) 
ions, as in ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), which contains ammonium ions (NH41) 
and nitrate ions (NO32). The ball-and-stick models of these ions are shown in 
Fig. 2.18.
2.7 An Introduction to the Periodic 
Table
In a room where chemistry is taught or practiced, a chart called the periodic table is 
almost certain to be found hanging on the wall. This chart shows all the known ele-
ments and gives a good deal of information about each. As our study of chemistry 
progresses, the usefulness of the periodic table will become more obvious. This sec-
tion will simply introduce it to you.
A simplified version of the periodic table is shown in Fig. 2.19. The letters in the 
boxes are the symbols for the elements; these abbreviations are based on the current

 element names or the original names (Table 2.2). The number shown above each 
symbol is the atomic number (number of protons) for that element. For example, 
carbon (C) has atomic number 6, and lead (Pb) has atomic number 82. Most of the 
elements are metals. Metals have characteristic physical properties such as efficient 
conduction of heat and electricity, malleability (they can be hammered into thin 
sheets), ductility (they can be pulled into wires), and (often) a lustrous appearance. 
Chemically, metals tend to lose electrons to form positive ions. For example, copper 
is a typical metal. It is lustrous (although it tarnishes readily); it is an excellent con-
ductor of electricity (it is widely used in electrical wires); and it is readily formed into 
various shapes, such as pipes for water systems. Copper is also found in many salts, 
such as the beautiful blue copper sulfate, in which copper is present as Cu21 ions. 
Copper is a member of the transition metals‚Äîthe metals shown in the center of the 
periodic table.
 
The relatively few nonmetals appear in the upper-right corner of the table (to the 
right of the heavy line in Fig. 2.19), except hydrogen, a nonmetal that resides in the 
 upper-left corner. The nonmetals lack the physical properties that characterize  
the metals. Chemically, they tend to gain electrons in reactions with metals to form 
negative ions. Nonmetals often bond to each other by forming covalent bonds. For 
example, chlorine is a typical nonmetal. Under normal conditions it exists as 
Cl2 molecules; it reacts with metals to form salts containing Cl2 ions (NaCl, for 
example); and it forms covalent bonds with nonmetals (for example, hydrogen 
chloride gas, HCl).
 
The periodic table is arranged so that elements in the same vertical columns (called 
groups or families) have similar chemical properties. For example, all of the alkali 
metals, members of Group 1A‚Äîlithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium 
(Rb), cesium (Cs), and francium (Fr)‚Äîare very active elements that readily form ions 
with a 11 charge when they react with nonmetals. The members of Group 2A‚Äî
beryllium (Be), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), and 
radium (Ra)‚Äîare called the alkaline earth metals. They all form ions with a 
21 charge when they react with nonmetals. The halogens, the members of Group 7A‚Äî 
fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and astatine (At)‚Äîall form 
diatomic molecules. Fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine all react with metals to 
form salts containing ions with a 12 charge (F2, Cl2, Br2, and I2). The members of 
Group 8A‚Äîhelium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and 
radon (Rn)‚Äîare known as the noble gases. They all  exist under normal conditions as 
monatomic (single-atom) gases and have little chemical reactivity.
Metals tend to form positive ions; 
 nonmetals tend to form negative ions.

Note from Fig. 2.19 that alternate sets of symbols are used to denote the groups. 
The symbols 1A through 8A are the traditional designations, whereas the numbers 
1 to 18 have been suggested recently. In this text the 1A to 8A designations will 
be used.
The horizontal rows of elements in the periodic table are called periods. Horizontal 
row 1 is called the first period (it contains H and He); row 2 is called the second period 
(elements Li through Ne); and so on.
We will learn much more about the periodic table as we continue with our study of 
chemistry. Meanwhile, when an element is introduced in this text, you should always 
note its position on the periodic table.
2.8 Naming Simple Compounds
When chemistry was an infant science, there was no system for naming compounds. 
Names such as sugar of lead, blue vitrol, quicklime, Epsom salts, milk of magnesia, 
gypsum, and laughing gas were coined by early chemists. Such names are called com-
mon names. As chemistry grew, it became clear that using common names for com-
pounds would lead to unacceptable chaos. Nearly 5 million chemical compounds are 
currently known. Memorizing common names for these compounds would be an 
impossible task.
The solution, of course, is to adopt a system for naming compounds in which the 
name tells something about the composition of the compound. After learning the sys-
tem, a chemist given a formula should be able to name the compound or, given a name, 
should be able to construct the compound‚Äôs formula. In this section we will specify the 
most important rules for naming compounds other than organic compounds (those 
based on chains of carbon atoms).
We will begin with the systems for naming inorganic binary compounds‚Äî 
compounds composed of two elements‚Äîwhich we classify into various types for eas-
ier recognition. We will consider both ionic and covalent compounds.
Another format of the periodic table will be 
discussed in Section 7.11.
2.8
H
assium, element 108, does not exist 
in  nature but must be made in a 
particle accelerator. It was first created 
in 1984 and can be made by shooting 
magnesium-26 (26
12Mg) atoms at 
curium-248 (248
96Cm) atoms. The colli-
sions between these atoms produce 
some hassium-265 (265
108Hs) atoms. The 
position of hassium in the periodic 
table (see Fig. 2.19) in the vertical col-
umn containing iron, ruthenium, and 
osmium suggests that hassium should 
have chemical properties similar to 
these metals. However, it is not easy to 
test this prediction‚Äîonly a few atoms 
of hassium can be made at a given 
time and they last for only about 
9 seconds. Imagine having to get  
your next lab experiment done in 
9 seconds!
Amazingly, a team of chemists 
from the Lawrence  Berkeley National 
Laboratory in California, the Paul 
Scherrer Institute and the University 
of Bern in Switzerland, and the Insti-
tute of Nuclear Chemistry in Germany 
have done experiments to character-
ize the chemical behavior of hassium. 
For example, they have observed that 
hassium atoms react with oxygen to

Binary Ionic Compounds (Type I)
Binary ionic compounds contain a positive ion (cation) always written first in the for-
mula and a negative ion (anion). In naming these compounds, the following rules apply:
Naming Type I Binary Compounds
1. The cation is always named first and the anion second.
2. A monatomic (meaning ‚Äúone-atom‚Äù) cation takes its name from the name of the element. 
For example, Na1 is called sodium in the names of compounds containing this ion.
3. A monatomic anion is named by taking the root of the element name and adding -ide. 
Thus the Cl2 ion is called chloride.
Some common monatomic cations and anions and their names are given in Table 2.3.
The rules for naming binary ionic compounds are illustrated by the following 
examples:

a. CsF    b. AlCl3    c. LiH
 
SOLUTION 
a. CsF is cesium fluoride.
b. AlCl3 is aluminum chloride.
c. LiH is lithium hydride.
Notice that, in each case, the cation is named first and then the anion is named.
See Exercise 2.75
A monatomic cation has the same name as 
its parent element.
In formulas of ionic compounds, simple 
ions are represented by the element 
symbol: Cl means Cl2, Na means Na1, and 
so on.

Formulas from Names
So far we have started with the chemical formula of a compound and decided on its 
systematic name. The reverse process is also important. For example, given the name 
calcium chloride, we can write the formula as CaCl2 because we know that calcium 
forms only Ca21 ions and that, since chloride is Cl2, two of these anions will be 
required to give a neutral compound.
Binary Ionic Compounds (Type II)
In the binary ionic compounds considered earlier (Type I), the metal present forms 
only a single type of cation. That is, sodium forms only Na1, calcium forms only Ca21, 
and so on. However, as we will see in more detail later in the text, there are many met-
als that form more than one type of positive ion and thus form more than one type of 
ionic compound with a given anion. For example, the compound FeCl2 contains Fe21 
ions, and the compound FeCl3 contains Fe31 ions. In a case such as this, the charge on 
the metal ion must be specified. The systematic names for these two iron compounds 
are iron(II) chloride and iron(III) chloride, respectively, where the Roman numeral 
indicates the charge of the cation.
 
Another system for naming these ionic compounds that is seen in the older litera-
ture was used for metals that form only two ions. The ion with the higher charge has a 
name ending in -ic, and the one with the lower charge has a name ending in -ous.  
In this system, for example, Fe31 is called the ferric ion, and Fe21 is called the 
ferrous ion. The names for FeCl3 and FeCl2 are then ferric chloride and ferrous 
chloride, respectively. In this text we will use the system that employs Roman 
numerals. Table¬†2.4 lists the systematic names for many common type II cations.

SOLUTION 
All of these compounds include a metal that can form more than one type of cation. Thus 
we must first determine the charge on each cation. This can be done by recognizing 
that a compound must be electrically neutral; that is, the positive and negative charges 
must exactly balance.

Because the anion is Cl2, the cation must 
be Cu1 (for charge balance), which 
requires a Roman numeral I.
Because the anion is O22, the cation must 
be Hg21 [mercury(II)].
The three O22 ions carry a total charge 
of 62, so two Fe31 ions [iron(III)] are 
needed to give a 61 charge.
2. Name

Two O22 ions (total charge 42) 
are required by the Mn41 ion 
[manganese(IV)].
Two Cl2 ions are required by the Pb21 
ion [lead(II)] for charge balance.
See Exercise 2.76
 
Note that the use of a Roman numeral in a systematic name is required only in cases 
where more than one ionic compound forms between a given pair of elements. This 
case most commonly occurs for compounds containing transition metals, which often 
form more than one cation. Elements that form only one cation do not need to be 
identified by a Roman numeral. Common metals that do not require Roman numer-
als are the Group 1A elements, which form only 11 ions; the Group 2A elements, 
which form only 21 ions; and aluminum, which forms only Al31. The element silver 
deserves special mention at this point. In virtually all its compounds, silver is found as 
the Ag1 ion. Therefore, although silver is a transition metal (and can potentially form 
ions other than Ag1), silver compounds are usually named without a Roman numeral. 
Thus AgCl is typically called silver chloride rather than silver(I) chloride, although the 
latter name is technically correct. Also, a Roman numeral is not used for zinc com-
pounds, since zinc forms only the Zn21 ion.
 
As shown in Example 2.5, when a metal ion is present that forms more than one 
type of cation, the charge on the metal ion must be determined by balancing the posi-
tive and negative charges of the compound. To do this you must be able to recognize 
the common cations and anions and know their charges (see Tables 2.3 and 2.5). The 
procedure for naming binary ionic compounds is summarized in Fig. 2.20.
CRITICAL THINKING We can use the periodic table to tell us 
something about the stable ions formed by many atoms. For example, the 
atoms in column 1 always form 11 ions. The transition metals, however, can 
form more than one type of stable ion. What if each transition metal ion 
had only one possible charge? How would the naming of compounds be 
different?
Type II binary ionic compounds contain a 
metal that can form more than one type 
of cation.
A compound must be electrically neutral.
A compound containing a transition metal 
usually requires a Roman numeral in its 
name.

Cobalt is a transition metal; the compound 
name must have a Roman numeral. The 
two Br2 ions must be balanced by a 
Co21 ion.
Calcium, an alkaline earth metal, forms 
only the Ca21 ion. A Roman numeral is 
not necessary.
Aluminum forms only the Al31 ion. A 
Roman  numeral is not necessary.

Chromium(III) indicates that Cr31 is

Gallium always forms 31 ions, so 3 I2 
ions are required for charge balance.
See Exercises 2.77 and 2.78
The common Type I and Type II ions are summarized in Fig. 2.21. Also shown in 
Fig. 2.21 are the common monatomic ions.
Ionic Compounds with Polyatomic Ions
We have not yet considered ionic compounds that contain polyatomic ions. For exam-
ple, the compound ammonium nitrate, NH4NO3, contains the polyatomic ions NH41 
and NO32. Polyatomic ions are assigned special names that must be memorized to 
name the compounds containing them. The most important polyatomic ions and their 
names are listed in Table 2.5.

Note in Table 2.5 that several series of anions contain an atom of a given element 
and different numbers of oxygen atoms. These anions are called oxyanions. When 
there are two members in such a series, the name of the one with the smaller number 
of oxygen atoms ends in -ite and the name of the one with the larger number ends in 
-ate‚Äîfor example, sulfite (SO322) and sulfate (SO422). When more than two oxy-
anions make up a series, hypo- (less than) and per- (more than) are used as prefixes to 
name the members of the series with the fewest and the most oxygen atoms, respec-
tively. The best example involves the oxyanions containing chlorine, as shown in 
Table 2.5.

As above, BrO32 is bromate, like 
ClO32 (chlorate).
See Exercises 2.79 and 2.80
Binary Covalent Compounds (Type III)
Binary covalent compounds are formed between two nonmetals. Although these com-
pounds do not contain ions, they are named very similarly to binary ionic compounds.
Naming Binary Covalent Compounds
1. The first element in the formula is named first, using the full element name.
2. The second element is named as if it were an anion.
3. Prefixes are used to denote the numbers of atoms present. These prefixes are given in 
Table 2.6.
4. The prefix mono- is never used for naming the first element. For example, CO is called 
carbon monoxide, not monocarbon monoxide.
In binary covalent compounds, the element 
names follow the same rules as for binary 
ionic compounds.

To see how these rules apply, we will now consider the names of the several cova-
lent compounds formed by nitrogen and oxygen:

N2O
NO
NO2
N2O3
N2O4
N2O5
Dinitrogen monoxide
Nitrogen monoxide
Nitrogen dioxide
Dinitrogen trioxide
Dinitrogen tetroxide
Dinitrogen pentoxide
Nitrous oxide
Nitric oxide
 
Notice from the preceding examples that to avoid awkward pronunciations, we 
often drop the final o or a of the prefix when the element begins with a vowel. For 
example, N2O4 is called dinitrogen tetroxide, not dinitrogen tetraoxide, and CO is 
called carbon monoxide, not carbon monooxide.
 
Some compounds are always referred to by their common names. Three examples 
are water, ammonia, and hydrogen peroxide. The systematic names for H2O, NH3, and 
H2O2 are never used.

Because gallium is in Group 3A, 
like aluminum, it forms only 31 
ions. Two Ga31 ions are required 
to balance the charge on three 
O22 ions.
See Exercises 2.83, 2.87, and 2.88
Acids
When dissolved in water, certain molecules produce a solution containing free H1 ions 
(protons). These substances, acids, will be discussed in detail in Chapters 4, 14, 
and 15. Here we will simply present the rules for naming acids.
 
An acid is a molecule in which one or more H1 ions are attached to an anion. The 
rules for naming acids depend on whether the anion contains oxygen. If the name 
of the anion ends in -ide, the acid is named with the prefix hydro- and the suffix -ic. 
For example, when gaseous HCl is dissolved in water, it forms hydrochloric acid. 
Similarly, HCN and H2S dissolved in water are called hydrocyanic and hydrosulfu-
ric acids, respectively.
 
When the anion contains oxygen, the acidic name is formed from the root name of 
the anion with a suffix of -ic or -ous, depending on the name of the anion.
1. If the anion name ends in -ate, the suffix -ic is added to the root name. For 
example, H2SO4 contains the sulfate anion (SO422) and is called sulfuric acid; 
H3PO4 contains the phosphate anion (PO432) and is called phosphoric acid; and 
HC2H3O2 contains the acetate ion (C2H3O22) and is called acetic acid.
Acids can be recognized by the hydrogen 
that appears first in the formula.
62

2. If the anion has an -ite ending, the -ite is replaced by -ous. For example, H2SO3, 
which contains sulfite (SO322), is named sulfurous acid; and HNO2, which con-
tains nitrite (NO22), is named nitrous acid.
The application of these rules can be seen in the names of the acids of the oxyanions 
of chlorine:

HClO4 
Perchlorate 
Perchloric acid
HClO3 
Chlorate 
Chloric acid
HClO2 
Chlorite 
Chlorous acid
HClO 
Hypochlorite 
Hypochlorous acid
The names of the most important acids are given in Tables 2.7 and 2.8. An overall 
strategy for naming acids is shown in Fig. 2.24.

systematic way to name chemical compounds. What if all compounds had only 
common names? What problems would this cause?

repeated this experiment, he found that the water weighed the 
same before and after heating, and the mass of the flask plus  
the solid residue equaled the original mass of the flask. Were

hemical reactions have a profound effect on our lives. There are many exam-
ples: Food is converted to energy in the human body; nitrogen and hydrogen 
are combined to form ammonia, which is used as a fertilizer; fuels and plastics are 
produced from petroleum; the starch in plants is synthesized from carbon dioxide and 
water using energy from sunlight; human insulin is produced in laboratories by bacte-
ria; cancer is induced in humans by substances from our environment; and so on, in a 
seemingly endless list. The central activity of chemistry is to understand chemical 
changes such as these, and the study of reactions occupies a central place in this book. 
We will examine why reactions occur, how fast they occur, and the specific pathways 
they follow.
In this chapter we will consider the quantities of materials consumed and produced 
in chemical reactions. This area of study is called chemical stoichiometry (pro-
nounced stoy?keÃÑ?om9?uh?treÃÑ). To understand chemical stoichiometry, you must first 
understand the concept of relative atomic masses.
 
3.1 Counting by Weighing
Suppose you work in a candy store that sells gourmet jelly beans by the bean. People 
come in and ask for 50 beans, 100 beans, 1000 beans, and so on, and you have to 
count them out‚Äîa tedious process at best. As a good problem solver, you try to come 
up with a better system. It occurs to you that it might be far more efficient to buy a 
scale and count the jelly beans by weighing them. How can you count jelly beans by 
weighing them? What information about the individual beans do you need to know?
Assume that all of the jelly beans are identical and that each has a mass 
of 5 g. If a customer asks for 1000 jelly beans, what mass of jelly beans 
would be required? Each bean has a mass of 5 g, so you would need 1000 
beans 3 5 g/bean, or 5000 g (5 kg). It takes just a few seconds to 
weigh out 5 kg of jelly beans. It would take much longer to count out 
1000 of them.
In reality, jelly beans are not identical. For example, let‚Äôs assume 
that you weigh 10 beans individually and get the following results:
Bean
Mass
Bean
Mass
1
5.1 g
 6
5.0 g
2
5.2 g
 7
5.0 g
3
5.0 g
 8
5.1 g
4
4.8 g
 9
4.9 g
5
4.9 g
10
5.0 g
Can we count these nonidentical beans by weighing? Yes. The key piece of informa-
tion we need is the average mass of the jelly beans. Let‚Äôs compute the average mass 
for our 10-bean sample.
Average mass 5 total mass of beans
number of beans
 5 5.1 g 1 5.2 g 1 5.0 g 1 4.8 g 1 4.9 g 1 5.0 g 1 5.0 g 1 5.1 g 1 4.9 g 1 5.0 g
10
 5 50.0
10 5 5.0 g
The average mass of a jelly bean is 5.0 g. Thus, to count out 1000 beans, we need 
to weigh out 5000 g of beans. This sample of beans, in which the beans have an 
average mass of 5.0 g, can be treated exactly like a sample where all of the beans

are identical. Objects do not need to have identical masses to be counted by weigh-
ing. We simply need to know the average mass of the objects. For purposes of 
counting, the objects behave as though they were all identical, as though they each 
actually had the average mass.
We count atoms in exactly the same way. Because atoms are so small, we deal 
with samples of matter that contain huge numbers of atoms. Even if we could see 
the atoms, it would not be possible to count them directly. Thus we determine the 
number of atoms in a given sample by finding its mass. However, just as with jelly 
beans, to relate the mass to a number of atoms, we must know the average mass of 
the atoms.
3.2 Atomic Masses
As we saw in Chapter 2, the first quantitative information about atomic masses came 
from the work of Dalton, Gay-Lussac, Lavoisier, Avogadro, and Berzelius. By observ-
ing the proportions in which elements combine to form various compounds, nineteenth-
century chemists calculated relative atomic masses. The modern system of atomic 
masses, instituted in 1961, is based on 12C (‚Äúcarbon twelve‚Äù) as the standard. In this 
system, 12C is assigned a mass of exactly 12 atomic mass units (u), and the masses of 
all other atoms are given relative to this standard.
 
The most accurate method currently available for comparing the masses of atoms 
 involves the use of the mass spectrometer. In this instrument, diagramed in Fig. 3.1, 
atoms or molecules are passed into a beam of high-speed electrons, which knock 
electrons off the atoms or molecules being analyzed and change them into positive 
ions. An applied electric field then accelerates these ions into a magnetic field. 
Because an accelerating ion produces its own magnetic field, an interaction with the 
applied magnetic field occurs, which tends to change the path of the ion. The amount 
of path deflection for each ion depends on its mass‚Äîthe most massive ions are 
deflected the smallest amount‚Äîwhich causes the ions to separate, as shown in 
Fig. 3.1. A comparison of the positions where the ions hit the detector plate gives 
very accurate values of their relative masses. For example, when 12C and 13C are 
analyzed in a mass spectrometer, the ratio of their masses is found to be

each element.
 
Look at the value of the atomic mass of carbon given in this table. You might expect 
to see 12, since we said the system of atomic masses is based on 12C. However, the 
number given for carbon is not 12 but 12.01. Why? The reason for this apparent dis-
crepancy is that the carbon found on earth (natural carbon) is a mixture of the isotopes 
12C, 13C, and 14C. All three isotopes have six protons, but they have six, seven, and 
eight neutrons, respectively. Because natural carbon is a mixture of isotopes, the 
atomic mass we use for carbon is an average value reflecting the average of the iso-
topes composing it.
 
The average atomic mass for carbon is computed as follows: It is known that natural 
carbon is composed of 98.89% 12C atoms and 1.11% 13C atoms. The amount of 14C is 
negligibly small at this level of precision. Using the masses of 12C (exactly 12 u) and 
13C (13.003355 u), we can calculate the average atomic mass for natural carbon as 
follows:
98.89% of 12 u 1 1.11% of 13.0034 u 5
10.98892 112 u2 1 10.01112 113.0034 u2 5 12.01 u
In this text we will call the average mass for an element the average atomic mass or, 
simply, the atomic mass for that element.
 
Even though natural carbon does not contain a single atom with mass 12.01, for 
stoichiometric purposes, we can consider carbon to be composed of only one type of 
atom with a mass of 12.01. This enables us to count atoms of natural carbon by weigh-
ing a sample of carbon.
 
Recall from Section 3.1 that counting by weighing works if you know the average 
mass of the units being counted. Counting by weighing works just the same for atoms 
as for jelly beans. For natural carbon with an average mass of 12.01 atomic mass units, 
The International Union of Pure and 
Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) has declared 
that what we refer to as the ‚Äúaverage 
atomic mass‚Äù should be called the 
‚Äúatomic weight‚Äù of an element, which is 
dimensionless by custom. However, we 
will retain the term ‚Äúaverage atomic mass‚Äù 
because this name accurately describes 
what the term represents.
Most elements occur in nature as  
mixtures of isotopes; thus atomic masses 
are usually average values.

to obtain 1000 atoms would require weighing out 12,010 atomic mass units of natural 
carbon (a mixture of 12C and 13C).
 
As in the case of carbon, the mass for each element listed in the table inside the 
front cover of the text is an average value based on the isotopic composition of the 
naturally occurring element. For instance, the mass listed for hydrogen (1.008) is  
the average mass for natural hydrogen, which is a mixture of 1H and 2H (deuterium). 
No atom of hydrogen actually has the mass 1.008.
 
In addition to being useful for determining accurate mass values for individual 
atoms, the mass spectrometer is used to determine the isotopic composition of a 
natural element. For example, when a sample of natural neon is injected into a mass 
spectrometer, the mass spectrum shown in Fig. 3.2 is obtained. The areas of the 
‚Äúpeaks‚Äù or the heights of the bars indicate the relative abundances of 20
10Ne, 21
10Ne, and 
22
10Ne atoms.
The Average Mass of an Element
When a sample of natural copper is vaporized and injected into a mass spectrometer, the 
results shown in Fig. 3.3 are obtained. Use these data to compute the average mass of 
natural copper. (The mass values for 63Cu and 65Cu are 62.93 u and 64.93 u,  respectively.)
SOLUTION 
Where are we going?
To calculate the average mass of natural copper
What do we know?
‚ùØ 63Cu mass 5 62.93 u
‚ùØ 65Cu mass 5 64.93 u
How do we get there?
As shown by the graph, of every 100 atoms of natural copper, 69.09 are 63Cu and 30.91 
are 65Cu. Thus the mass of 100 atoms of natural copper is
169.09 atoms2 a62.93 
u
atomb 1 130.91 atoms2 a64.93 
u
atomb 5 6355 u
The average mass of a copper atom is
6355 u
100 atoms 5 63.55 u/atom
This mass value is used in doing calculations involving the reactions of copper and is 
the value given in the table inside the front cover of this book.
Reality Check When you finish a calculation, you should always check whether your 
answer makes sense. In this case our answer of 63.55 u is between the masses of the 
atoms that make up natural copper. This makes sense. The answer could not be smaller 
than 62.93 u or larger than 64.93 u.
See Exercises 3.39 and 3.46
3.3 The Mole
Because samples of matter typically contain so many atoms, a unit of measure called 
the mole has been established for use in counting atoms. For our purposes, it is most 
convenient to define the mole (abbreviated mol) as the number equal to the number of

carbon atoms in exactly 12 g of pure 12C. Techniques such as mass spectrometry, which 
count atoms very precisely, have been used to determine this number as 6.02214 3 1023 
(6.022 3 1023 will be sufficient for our purposes). This number is called Avogadro‚Äôs 
number to honor his contributions to chemistry. One mole of something consists of 
6.022 3 1023 units of that substance. Just as a dozen eggs is 12 eggs, a mole of eggs is 
6.022 31023 eggs.
 
The magnitude of the number 6.022 3 1023 is very difficult to imagine. To give you 
some idea, 1 mole of seconds represents a span of time 4 million times as long as the 
earth has already existed, and 1 mole of marbles is enough to cover the entire earth to 
a depth of 50 miles! However, since atoms are so tiny, a mole of atoms or molecules is 
a perfectly manageable quantity to use in a reaction (Fig. 3.4).
CRITICAL THINKING What if you were offered $1 million to count 
from 1 to 6 3 1023 at a rate of one number each second?
Determine your hourly wage. Would you do it? Could you do it?
 
How do we use the mole in chemical calculations? Recall that Avogadro‚Äôs number 
is defined as the number of atoms in exactly 12 g of 12C. This means that 12 g of 12C 
contains 6.022 3 1023 atoms. It also means that a 12.01-g sample of natural carbon 
contains 6.022 3 1023 atoms (a mixture of 12C, 13C, and 14C atoms, with an average 
atomic mass of 12.01). Since the ratio of the masses of the samples (12 gy12.01 g) is 
the same as the ratio of the masses of the individual components (12 uy12.01 u), the 
two samples contain the same number of atoms (6.022 3 1023).
 
To be sure this point is clear, think of oranges with an average mass of 0.5 lb each 
and grapefruit with an average mass of 1.0 lb each. Any two sacks for which the sack 
of grapefruit weighs twice as much as the sack of oranges will contain the same num-
ber of pieces of fruit. The same idea extends to atoms. Compare natural carbon (aver-
age mass of 12.01) and natural helium (average mass of 4.003). A sample of 12.01 g 
of natural carbon contains the same number of atoms as 4.003 g of natural helium. 
Both samples contain 1 mole of atoms (6.022 3 1023). Table 3.1 gives more examples 
that illustrate this basic idea.
 
Thus the mole is defined such that a sample of a natural element with a mass equal 
to the element‚Äôs atomic mass expressed in grams contains 1 mole of atoms. This 
The SI definition of the mole is the amount 
of a substance that contains as many 
entities as there are in exactly 12 g of 
carbon-12.
Avogadro‚Äôs number is 6.022 3 1023. One 
mole of anything is 6.022 3 1023 units of 
that substance.
The mass of 1 mole of an element is equal 
to its atomic mass in grams.

definition also fixes the relationship between the atomic mass unit and the gram. Since

CRITICAL THINKING What if you discovered Avogadro‚Äôs number

on the periodic table? If so, how? If not, why not?
Determining the Mass of a Sample of Atoms
Americium is an element that does not occur naturally. It can be made in very small 
amounts in a device known as a particle accelerator. Compute the mass in grams of a 
sample of americium containing six atoms.

Where are we going?

To do chemical calculations, you must understand what the mole means and how to 
determine the number of moles in a given mass of a substance. These procedures are

Determining Moles of Atoms
Aluminum (Al) is a metal with a high strength-to-mass ratio and a high resistance to 
corrosion; thus it is often used for structural purposes. Compute both the number of 
moles of atoms and the number of atoms in a 10.0-g sample of aluminum.

SOLUTION 
Where are we going?
To calculate the moles and number of atoms in a sample of Al
What do we know?
‚ùØ Sample contains 10.0 g of Al
‚ùØ Mass of 1 mole (6.022 3 1023 atoms) of Al 5 26.93 g
How do we get there?
We can calculate the number of moles of Al in a 10.0-g sample as follows:
10.0 g Al 3 1 mol Al
26.98 g Al 5 0.371 mol Al atoms
The number of atoms in 10.0 g (0.371 mole) of aluminum is

Reality Check One mole of Al has a mass of 26.98 g and contains 6.022 3 1023 atoms. 
Our sample is 10.0 g, which is roughly 1y3 of 26.98. Thus the calculated amount 
should be on the order of 1y3 of 6 3 1023, which it is.

Calculating Numbers of Atoms
A silicon chip used in an integrated circuit of a microcomputer has a mass of 5.68 mg. 
How many silicon (Si) atoms are present in the chip?
 
SOLUTION 
Where are we going?
To calculate the atoms of Si in the chip
What do we know?
‚ùØ The chip has 5.68 mg of Si
‚ùØ Mass of 1 mole (6.022 3 1023 atoms) of Si 5 28.09 g
How do we get there?
The strategy for doing this problem is to convert from milligrams of silicon to grams 
of silicon, then to moles of silicon, and finally to atoms of silicon:
 5.68 mg Si 3
1 g Si
1000 mg Si 5 5.68 3 1023 g Si
 5.68 3 1023 g Si 3 1 mol Si
28.09 g Si 5 2.02 3 1024 mol Si
 2.02 3 1024 mol Si 3 6.022 3 1023 atoms
1 mol Si
5 1.22 3 1020 atoms
Reality Check Note that 5.68 mg of silicon is clearly much less than 1 mole of silicon 
(which has a mass of 28.09 g), so the final answer of 1.22 3 1020 atoms (compared 
with 6.022 3 1023 atoms) is in the right direction.
See Exercise 3.49

Where are we going?
To calculate the number of moles and the mass of a sample of Co
What do we know?
‚ùØ Sample contains 5.00 3 1020 atoms of Co
How do we get there?
Note that the sample of 5.00 3 1020 atoms of cobalt is less than 1 mole 
(6.022¬† 3¬† 1023¬† atoms) of cobalt. What fraction of a mole it represents can be

Since the mass of 1 mole of cobalt atoms is 58.93 g, the mass of 5.00 3 1020 atoms can 
be determined as follows:
8.30 3 1024 mol Co 3 58.93 g Co
1 mol Co 5 4.89 3 1022 g Co
Reality Check In this case the sample contains 5 3 1020 atoms, which is approxi-
mately 1y1000 of a mole. Thus the sample should have a mass of about (1y1000)
(58.93) > 0.06. Our answer of ,0.05 makes sense.
See Exercise 3.50
3.4 Molar Mass
A chemical compound is, ultimately, a collection of atoms. For example, methane 
(the major component of natural gas) consists of molecules that each contain one 
carbon and four hydrogen atoms (CH4). How can we calculate the mass of 1 mole 
of methane; that is, what is the mass of 6.022 3 1023 CH4 molecules? Since each 
CH4 molecule contains one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms, 1 mole of 
CH4 molecules contains 1 mole of carbon atoms and 4 moles of hydrogen atoms. 
The mass of 1 mole of methane can be found by summing the masses of carbon and 
hydrogen present:
 Mass of 1 mol C 5 12.01 g
 Mass of 4 mol H 5 4 3 1.008 g
 Mass of 1 mol CH4 5 16.04 g
Because 16.04 g represents the mass of 1 mole of methane molecules, it makes 
sense to call it the molar mass for methane. Thus the molar mass of a substance is the 
mass in grams of 1 mole of the compound. Traditionally, the term molecular weight has 
been used for this quantity. However, we will use molar mass exclusively in this text. 
The molar mass of a known substance is obtained by summing the masses of the com-
ponent atoms as we did for methane.
Methane is a molecular compound‚Äîits components are molecules. Many sub-
stances are ionic‚Äîthey contain simple ions or polyatomic ions. Examples are NaCl 
(contains Na1 and Cl2) and CaCO3 (contains Ca21 and CO322). Because ionic com-
pounds do not contain molecules, we need a special name for the fundamental unit 
of these materials. Instead of molecule, we use the term formula unit. Thus CaCO3
is the formula unit for calcium carbonate, and NaCl is the formula unit for sodium 
chloride.
Calculating Molar Mass I
Juglone, a dye known for centuries, is produced from the husks of black walnuts. It is 
also a natural herbicide (weed killer) that kills off competitive plants around the black 
walnut tree but does not affect grass and other noncompetitive plants. The formula for 
juglone is C10H6O3.
a. Calculate the molar mass of juglone.
b. A sample of 1.56 3 1022 g of pure juglone was extracted from black walnut 
husks. How many moles of juglone does this sample represent?

SOLUTION

In 1 mole of juglone, there are 10 moles of carbon atoms, 6 moles of hydrogen 
atoms, and 3 moles of oxygen atoms:

The mass of 1 mole of juglone is 174.1 g, which is the molar mass.
b. The mass of 1 mole of this compound is 174.1 g; thus 1.56 3 1022 g is  
much less than a mole. The exact fraction of a mole can be determined  
as follows:
1.56 3 1022 g juglone 3 1 mol juglone
174.1 g juglone 5 8.96 3 1025 mol juglone

Calcium carbonate (CaCO3), also called calcite, is the principal mineral found in lime-
stone, marble, chalk, pearls, and the shells of marine animals such as clams.
a. Calculate the molar mass of calcium carbonate.
b. A certain sample of calcium carbonate contains 4.86 moles. What is the mass in 
grams of this sample? What is the mass of the CO322 ions present?
 
SOLUTION 
a. Calcium carbonate is an ionic compound composed of Ca21 and CO322 ions. In  
1 mole of calcium carbonate, there are 1 mole of Ca21 ions and 1 mole of CO322 
ions. The molar mass is calculated by summing the masses of the components:
1 Ca21:¬†¬† 1 3 40.08 g 5 40.08 g

3 O:¬†¬†
 3 3 16.00 g 5 48.00 g
 Mass of 1 mol CaCO3 5 100.09 g
Thus the mass of 1 mole of CaCO3 (1 mole of Ca21 plus 1 mole of CO322) is 
100.09 g. This is the molar mass.
b. The mass of 1 mole of CaCO3 is 100.09 g. The sample contains nearly 5 moles, 
or close to 500 g. The exact amount is determined as follows:
4.86 mol CaCO3 3 100.09 g CaCO3
1 mol CaCO3
5 486 g CaCO3
 
To find the mass of carbonate ions (CO322) present in this sample, we must 
realize that 4.86 moles of CaCO3 contains 4.86 moles of Ca21 ions and  
4.86 moles of CO322 ions. The mass of 1 mole of CO322 ions is

Molar Mass and Numbers of Molecules
Isopentyl acetate (C7H14O2) is the compound responsible for the scent of bananas. A 
mo lecular model of isopentyl acetate is shown in the margin below. Interestingly, bees 
release about 1 mg (1 3 1026 g) of this compound when they sting. The resulting scent 
attracts other bees to join the attack. How many molecules of isopentyl acetate are 
released in a typical bee sting? How many atoms of carbon are present?
 
SOLUTION 
Where are we going?
To calculate the number of molecules of isopentyl acetate and the number of carbon 
atoms in a bee sting
What do we know?
‚ùØ Mass of isopentyl acetate in a typical bee sting is 1 microgram = 1 3 1026 g
How do we get there?
Since we are given a mass of isopentyl acetate and want to find the number of mole-
cules, we must first compute the molar mass of C7H14O2:
 7 mol C 3 12.01 g
mol 5 84.07 g C
 14 mol H 3 1.008 g
mol 5 14.11 g H
 2 mol O 3 16.00 g
mol 5 32.00 g O
 
130.18 g
This means that 1 mole of isopentyl acetate (6.022 3 1023 molecules) has a mass of 
130.18 g.
 
To find the number of molecules released in a sting, we must first determine the 
number of moles of isopentyl acetate in 1 3 1026 g:
1 3 1026 g C7H14O2 3
1 mol C7H14O2
130.18 g C7H14O2
5 8 3 1029 mol C7H14O2
Since 1 mole is 6.022 3 1023 units, we can determine the number of molecules:
8 3 1029 mol C7H14O2 3 6.022 3 1023 molecules
1 mol C7H14O2
5 5 3 1015 molecules
To determine the number of carbon atoms present, we must multiply the number of 
molecules by 7, since each molecule of isopentyl acetate contains seven carbon atoms:
5 3 1015 molecules 3 7 carbon atoms

5 4 3 1016 carbon atoms
Note: In keeping with our practice of always showing the correct number of signifi-
cant figures, we have rounded after each step. However, if extra digits are carried 
throughout this problem, the final answer rounds to 3 3 1016.
See Exercises 3.61 through 3.66

3.5 Learning to Solve Problems
One of the great rewards of studying chemistry is to become a good problem solver. 
Being able to solve complex problems is a talent that will serve you well in all walks 
of life. It is our purpose in this text to help you learn to solve problems in a flexible, 
creative way based on understanding the fundamental ideas of chemistry. We call this 
approach conceptual problem solving.
The ultimate goal is to be able to solve new problems (that is, problems you have 
not seen before) on your own. In this text we will provide problems and offer solutions 
by explaining how to think about the problems. While the answers to these problems 
are  important, it is perhaps even more important to understand the process‚Äîthe think-
ing  necessary to get the answer. Although at first we will be solving the problem for 
you, do not take a passive role. While studying the solution, it is crucial that you inter-
actively think through the problem with us. Do not skip the discussion and jump to the 
answer. Usually, the solution will involve asking a series of questions. Make sure that 
you understand each step in the process. This active approach should apply to prob-
lems outside of chemistry as well. For example, imagine riding with someone in a car 
to an unfamiliar destination. If your goal is simply to have the other person get you to 
that destination, you will probably not pay much attention to how to get there (pas-
sive), and if you have to find this same place in the future on your own, you probably 
will not be able to do it. If, however, your goal is to learn how to get there, you would 
pay attention to distances, signs, and turns (active). This is how you should read the 
solutions in the text (and the text in general).
While actively studying our solutions to problems is helpful, at some point you will 
need to know how to think through these problems on your own. If we help you too 
much as you solve a problem, you won‚Äôt really learn effectively. If we always ‚Äúdrive,‚Äù 
you won‚Äôt interact as meaningfully with the material. Eventually you need to learn to 
drive yourself. We will provide more help at the beginning of the text and less as we 
proceed to later chapters.
There are two fundamentally different ways you might use to approach a problem. 
One way emphasizes memorization. We might call this the ‚Äúpigeonholing method.‚Äù In 
this approach, the first step is to label the problem‚Äîto decide in which pigeonhole it 
fits. The pigeonholing method requires that we provide you with a set of steps that you 
memorize and store in the appropriate slot for each different problem you encounter. 
The difficulty with this method is that it requires a new pigeonhole each time a prob-
lem is changed by even a small amount.
Consider the driving analogy again. Suppose you have memorized how to drive 
from your house to the grocery store. Do you know how to drive back from the grocery 
store to your house? Not necessarily. If you have only memorized the directions and 
do not understand fundamental principles such as ‚ÄúI traveled north to get to the store, 
so my house is south of the store,‚Äù you may find yourself stranded. In a more compli-
cated  example,  suppose you know how to get from your house to the store (and back) 
and from your house to the library (and back). Can you get from the library to the store 
without having to go back home? Probably not if you have only memorized directions 
and you do not have a ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù of where your house, the store, and the library are 
relative to one  another.
The second approach is conceptual problem solving, in which we help you get the 
‚Äúbig picture‚Äù‚Äîa real understanding of the situation. This approach to problem solving 
looks within the problem for a solution. In this method we assume that the problem is 
a new one, and we let the problem guide us as we solve it. In this approach we ask a 
series of questions as we proceed and use our knowledge of fundamental principles to 
answer these questions. Learning this approach requires some patience, but the reward 
for learning to solve problems this way is that we become an effective solver of any 
new problem that confronts us in daily life or in our work in any field. In summary, 
instead of looking outside the problem for a memorized solution, we will look inside 
the problem and let the problem help us as we proceed to a solution.

As we have seen in problems we have already considered, there are several organiz-
ing principles to help you become a creative problem solver. Although we have been 
using these ideas in earlier problems, let‚Äôs review and expand on them. Because as we 
progress in our study of chemistry the problems become more complicated, we will 
need to rely on this approach even more.
1.
We need to read the problem and decide on the final goal. Then we sort through the 
facts given, focusing on the key words and often drawing a diagram of the problem. 
In this part of the analysis we need to state the problem as simply and as visually 
as possible. We could summarize this entire process as ‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù
2.
In order to reach our final goal, we need to decide where to start. For example, in 
a stoichiometry problem we always start with the chemical reaction. Then we ask 
a series of questions as we proceed, such as, ‚ÄúWhat are the reactants and prod-
ucts?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat is the balanced equation?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat are the amounts of the reactants?‚Äù 
and so on. Our understanding of the fundamental principles of chemistry will 
enable us to answer each of these simple questions and eventually will lead us to 
the final solution. We might summarize this process as ‚ÄúHow do we get there?‚Äù
3.
Once we get the solution of the problem, then we ask ourselvves, ‚ÄúDoes it make 
sense?‚Äù That is, does our answer seem reasonable? We call this the Reality 
Check. It always pays to check your answer.
Using a conceptual approach to problem solving will enable you to develop real 
confidence as a problem solver. You will no longer panic when you see a problem that 
is different in some ways from those you have solved in the past. Although you might 
be frustrated at times as you learn this method, we guarantee that it will pay dividends 
later and should make your experience with chemistry a positive one that will prepare 
you for any career you choose.
To summarize, one of our major goals in this text is to help you become a creative 
problem solver. We will do this by, at first, giving you lots of guidance in how to solve 
problems. We will ‚Äúdrive,‚Äù but we hope you will be paying attention instead of just 
‚Äúriding along.‚Äù As we move forward, we will gradually shift more of the responsibility 
to you. As you gain confidence in letting the problem guide you, you will be amazed 
at how effective you can be at solving some really complex problems‚Äîjust like the 
ones you will confront in ‚Äúreal life.‚Äù
3.6 Percent Composition 
of Compounds
There are two common ways of describing the composition of a compound: in terms 
of the numbers of its constituent atoms and in terms of the percentages (by mass) of its 
elements. We can obtain the mass percents of the elements from the formula of the 
compound by comparing the mass of each element present in 1 mole of the compound 
to the total mass of 1 mole of the compound.
 
For example, for ethanol, which has the formula C2H5OH, the mass of each element 
present and the molar mass are obtained as follows:
 Mass of C 5 2 mol 3 12.01 g
mol 5 24.02 g
 Mass of H 5 6 mol 3 1.008 g
mol 5 6.048 g
 Mass of O 5 1 mol 3 16.00  g
mol 5 16.00 g
 Mass of 1 mol C2H5OH 5 46.07 g

The mass percent (often called the weight percent) of carbon in ethanol can be com-
puted by comparing the mass of carbon in 1 mole of ethanol to the total mass of 1 mole 
of ethanol and multiplying the result by 100:
 Mass percent of C 5 mass of C in 1 mol C2H5OH
mass of 1 mol C2H5OH
3 100%
 5 24.02 g
46.07 g 3 100% 5 52.14%
The mass percents of hydrogen and oxygen in ethanol are obtained in a similar 
manner:
 Mass percent of H 5 mass of H in 1 mol C2H5OH
mass of 1 mol C2H5OH
3 100%
 5 6.048 g
46.07 g 3 100% 5 13.13%
 Mass percent of O 5 mass of O in 1 mol C2H5OH
mass of 1 mol C2H5OH
3 100%
 5 16.00 g
46.07 g 3 100% 5 34.73%
Reality Check Notice that the percentages add up to 100.00%; this provides a check 
that the calculations are correct.
Calculating Mass Percent
Carvone is a substance that occurs in two forms having different arrangements of the 
atoms but the same molecular formula (C10H14O) and mass. One type of carvone gives 
caraway seeds their characteristic smell, and the other type is responsible for the smell 
of spearmint oil. Compute the mass percent of each element in carvone.

3.7 Determining the Formula 
of a Compound
When a new compound is prepared, one of the first items of interest is the formula of 
the compound. This is most often determined by taking a weighed sample of the com-
pound and either decomposing it into its component elements or reacting it with oxy-
gen to produce substances such as CO2, H2O, and N2, which are then collected and 
weighed. A device for doing this type of analysis is shown in Fig. 3.5. The results of 
such analyses provide the mass of each type of element in the compound, which can 
be used to determine the mass percent of each element.
 
We will see how information of this type can be used to compute the formula of a 
compound. Suppose a substance has been prepared that is composed of carbon, hydro-
gen, and nitrogen. When 0.1156 g of this compound is reacted with oxygen, 0.1638 g 
of carbon dioxide (CO2) and 0.1676 g of water (H2O) are collected. Assuming that all

its carbon to carbon dioxide and all its hydrogen to water. These products are collected by 
absorption using appropriate materials, and their amounts are determined by measuring the 
increase in masses of the absorbents.

the carbon in the compound is converted to CO2, we can determine the mass of carbon 
originally present in the 0.1156-g sample. To do this, we must use the fraction (by 
mass) of carbon in CO2. The molar mass of CO2 is
 C:¬†¬†1 mol 3 12.01 g
mol 5 12.01 g
 O:¬†¬†2 mol 3 16.00 g
mol 5 32.00 g
 Molar mass of CO2 5 44.01 g/mol
The fraction of carbon present by mass is
Mass of C
Total mass of CO2
5
12.01 g C
44.01 g CO2
This factor can now be used to determine the mass of carbon in 0.1638 g of CO2:
0.1638 g CO2 3
12.01 g C
44.01 g CO2
5 0.04470 g C
Remember that this carbon originally came from the 0.1156-g sample of unknown 
compound. Thus the mass percent of carbon in this compound is
0.04470 g C
0.1156 g compound 3 100% 5 38.67% C
 
The same procedure can be used to find the mass percent of hydrogen in the 
unknown compound. We assume that all the hydrogen present in the original 0.1156 g 
of compound was converted to H2O. The molar mass of H2O is 18.02 g, and the frac-
tion of hydrogen by mass in H2O is
Mass of H
Mass of H2O 5
2.016 g H
18.02 g H2O
Therefore, the mass of hydrogen in 0.1676 g of H2O is
0.1676 g H2O 3
2.016 g H
18.02 g H2O 5 0.01875 g H
The mass percent of hydrogen in the compound is
0.01875 g H
0.1156 g compound 3 100% 5 16.22% H
The unknown compound contains only carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen. So far we have 
determined that it is 38.67% carbon and 16.22% hydrogen. The remainder must be 
nitrogen:
100.00% 2 138.67% 1 16.22%2 5 45.11% N
 
‚Üë 
‚Üë 
 
% C 
% H
We have determined that the compound contains 38.67% carbon, 16.22% hydrogen, 
and 45.11% nitrogen. Next we use these data to obtain the formula.
 
Since the formula of a compound indicates the numbers of atoms in the compound, 
we must convert the masses of the elements to numbers of atoms. The easiest way to 
do this is to work with 100.00 g of the compound. In the present case, 38.67% carbon 
by mass means 38.67 g of carbon per 100.00 g of compound; 16.22% hydrogen means 
16.22 g of hydrogen per 100.00 g of compound; and so on. To determine the formula, 
we must calculate the number of carbon atoms in 38.67 g of carbon, the number of 
CO2
H2O
84

hydrogen atoms in 16.22 g of hydrogen, and the number of nitrogen atoms in 45.11 g 
of nitrogen. We can do this as follows:
38.67 g C 3 1 mol C
12.01 g C 5 3.220 mol C
16.22 g H 3 1 mol H
1.008 g H 5 16.09 mol H
45.11 g N 3 1 mol N
14.01 g N 5 3.220 mol N
Thus 100.00 g of this compound contains 3.220 moles of carbon atoms, 16.09 moles 
of hydrogen atoms, and 3.220 moles of nitrogen atoms.
 
We can find the smallest whole-number ratio of atoms in this compound by divid-
ing each of the mole values above by the smallest of the three:
C:¬†¬†3.220
3.220 5 1.000 5 1
H:¬†¬†16.09
3.220 5 4.997 5 5
N:¬†¬†3.220
3.220 5 1.000 5 1
 
Thus the formula might well be CH5N. However, it also could be C2H10N2 or 
C3H15N3, and so on‚Äîthat is, some multiple of the smallest whole-number ratio. Each 
of these alternatives also has the correct relative numbers of atoms. That is, any mol-
ecule that can be represented as (CH5N)n, where n is an integer, has the empirical 
formula CH5N. To be able to specify the exact formula of the molecule involved, the 
molecular formula, we must know the molar mass.
 
Suppose we know that this compound with empirical formula CH5N has a molar 
mass of 31.06 g/mol. How do we determine which of the possible choices represents 
the mo lecular formula? Since the molecular formula is always a whole-number mul-
tiple of the empirical formula, we must first find the empirical formula mass for CH5N:
 1 C :¬†¬†1 3 12.01 g 5 12.01 g
 5 H:¬†¬†5 3 1.008 g 5 5.040 g
 1 N:¬†¬†1 3 14.01 g 5 14.01 g
 Formula mass of CH5N 5 31.06 g/mol
This is the same as the known molar mass of the compound. Thus in this case the 
empirical formula and the molecular formula are the same; this substance consists of 
molecules with the formula CH5N. It is quite common for the empirical and molecular 
formulas to be different; some examples where this is the case are shown in Fig. 3.6.

PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY 
Empirical Formula Determination
 
¬ª Since mass percentage gives the number of grams of a particular element per 
100 g of compound, base the calculation on 100 g of compound. Each percent 
will then represent the mass in grams of that element.
 
¬ª Determine the number of moles of each element present in 100 g of com-
pound using the atomic masses of the elements present.
 
¬ª Divide each value of the number of moles by the smallest of the values. If 
each resulting number is a whole number (after appropriate rounding), these 
numbers represent the subscripts of the elements in the empirical formula.
 
¬ª If the numbers obtained in the previous step are not whole numbers, multiply 
each number by an integer so that the results are all whole numbers.
Numbers very close to whole numbers, 
such as 9.92 and 1.08, should be rounded 
to whole numbers. Numbers such as 2.25, 
4.33, and 2.72 should not be rounded to 
whole numbers.
CRITICAL THINKING One part of the problem-solving strategy 
for empirical formula determination is to base the calculation on 100 g of 
compound. What if you chose a mass other than 100 g? Would this work? What if 
you chose to base the calculation on 100 moles of compound? Would this work?
PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY 
Determining Molecular Formula from Empirical Formula
 
¬ª Obtain the empirical formula.
 
¬ª Compute the mass corresponding to the empirical formula.
 
¬ª Calculate the ratio:
Molar mass
Empirical formula mass
 ¬ª The integer from the previous step represents the number of empirical formula 
units in one molecule. When the empirical formula subscripts are multiplied by 
this integer, the molecular formula results. This procedure is summarized by the 
equation:

the mo lecular formula. For example, in Example 3.10 we know the molar mass of the 
compound is 98.96 g/mol. This means that 1 mole of the compound weighs 98.96 g.

4 moles of H atoms, and the molecular formula is Cl2C2H4, as obtained in Example 3.10.

3.8 Chemical Equations
Chemical Reactions
A chemical change involves a reorganization of the atoms in one or more substances. 
For example, when the methane (CH4) in natural gas combines with oxygen (O2) in the 
air and burns, carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) are formed. This process is rep-
resented by a chemical equation with the reactants (here methane and oxygen) on the 
left side of an arrow and the products (carbon dioxide and water) on the right side:
CH4 1 O2 h CO2 1 H2O
 
Reactants 
Products
Notice that the atoms have been reorganized. Bonds have been broken, and new ones 
have been formed. It is important to recognize that in a chemical reaction, atoms are 
neither created nor destroyed. All atoms present in the reactants must be accounted 
for among the products. In other words, there must be the same number of each type 
of atom on the products side and on the reactants side of the arrow. Making sure that 
this rule is obeyed is called balancing a chemical equation for a reaction.
 
The equation (shown above) for the reaction between CH4 and O2 is not balanced. 
We can see this from the following representation of the reaction:
+
+
Notice that the number of oxygen atoms (in O2) on the left of the arrow is two, while on 
the right there are three O atoms (in CO2 and H2O). Also, there are four hydrogen atoms 
(in CH4) on the left and only two (in H2O) on the right. Remember that a chemical reac-
tion is simply a rearrangement of the atoms (a change in the way they are organized). 
Atoms are neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. Thus the reactants and 
products must occur in numbers that give the same number of each type of atom among 
both the reactants and products. Simple trial and error will allow us to figure this out for 
the reaction of methane with oxygen. The needed numbers of molecules are

Notice that now we have the same number of each type of atom represented among the 
reactants and the products.
 
We can represent the preceding situation in a shorthand manner by the following 
chemical equation:
CH4 1 2O2 h CO2 1 2H2O
We can check that the equation is balanced by comparing the number of each type of 
atom on both sides:

The Meaning of a Chemical Equation
The chemical equation for a reaction gives two important types of information: the 
nature of the reactants and products and the relative numbers of each.
 
The reactants and products in a specific reaction must be identified by experiment. 
Besides specifying the compounds involved in the reaction, the equation often gives 
the physical states of the reactants and products:
State
Symbol
Solid
(s)
Liquid
(l)
Gas
(g)
Dissolved in water 
(in aqueous solution)
(aq)
For example, when hydrochloric acid in aqueous solution is added to solid sodium 
hydrogen carbonate, the products carbon dioxide gas, liquid water, and sodium chlo-
ride (which dissolves in the water) are formed:
HCl1aq2 1 NaHCO31s2 h CO21g2 1 H2O1l2 1 NaCl1aq2
 
The relative numbers of reactants and products in a reaction are indicated by the 
coefficients in the balanced equation. (The coefficients can be determined because we 
know that the same number of each type of atom must occur on both sides of the equa-
tion.) For example, the balanced equation
CH41g2 1 2O21g2 h CO21g2 1 2H2O1g2
can be interpreted in several equivalent ways, as shown in Table 3.2. Note that the total 
mass is 80 g for both reactants and products. We expect the mass to remain constant, 
since chemical reactions involve only a rearrangement of atoms. Atoms, and therefore 
mass, are conserved in a chemical reaction.
 
From this discussion you can see that a balanced chemical equation gives you a 
great deal of information.

3.9 Balancing Chemical Equations
An unbalanced chemical equation is of limited use. Whenever you see an equation, 
you should ask yourself whether it is balanced. The principle that lies at the heart of 
the balancing process is that atoms are conserved in a chemical reaction. The same 
number of each type of atom must be found among the reactants and products. It is 
also important to recognize that the identities of the reactants and products of a reac-
tion are determined by experimental observation. For example, when liquid ethanol is 
burned in the presence of sufficient oxygen gas, the products are always carbon diox-
ide and water. When the equation for this reaction is balanced, the identities of the 
reactants and products must not be changed. The formulas of the compounds must 
never be changed in balancing a chemical equation. That is, the subscripts in a for-
mula cannot be changed, nor can atoms be added or subtracted from a formula.
CRITICAL THINKING What if a friend was balancing chemical 
equations by changing the values of the subscripts instead of using the 
coefficients? How would you explain to your friend that this was the wrong 
thing to do?
Most chemical equations can be balanced by inspection, that is, by trial and error. 
It is always best to start with the most complicated molecules (those containing the 
greatest number of atoms). For example, consider the reaction of ethanol with oxygen, 
given by the unbalanced equation
C2H5OH1l2 1 O21g2 h CO21g2 1 H2O1g2
which can be represented by the following molecular models:
+
+
Notice that the carbon and hydrogen atoms are not balanced. There are two carbon 
atoms on the left and one on the right, and there are six hydrogens on the left and two 
on the right. We need to find the correct numbers of reactants and products so that we 
have the same number of all types of atoms among the reactants and products. We will 
balance the equation ‚Äúby inspection‚Äù (a systematic trial-and-error procedure).
The most complicated molecule here is C2H5OH. We will begin by balancing the 
products that contain the atoms in C2H5OH. Since C2H5OH contains two carbon atoms, 
we place the coefficient 2 before the CO2 to balance the carbon atoms:
C2H5OH(l) + O2(g)
2CO2(g) + H2O(g)
2 C atoms
2 C atoms

In balancing equations, start with the most 
complicated molecule.

Since C2H5OH contains six hydrogen atoms, the hydrogen atoms can be balanced by 
 placing a 3 before the H2O:
C2H5OH(l) + O2(g)
2CO2(g) + 3H2O(g)
(3 √ó 2) H
(5 + 1) H
Last, we balance the oxygen atoms. Note that the right side of the preceding equation 
contains seven oxygen atoms, whereas the left side has only three. We can correct this 
by putting a 3 before the O2 to produce the balanced equation:
C2H5OH(l) + 3O2(g)
2CO2(g) + 3H2O(g)
1 O
7 O
7 O
6 O
(2 √ó 2) O

Now we check:
C2H5OH(l) + 3O2(g)
2CO2(g) + 3H2O(g)
2 C atoms
6 H atoms
7 O atoms
2 C atoms
6 H atoms
7 O atoms
The equation is balanced.
 
The balanced equation can be represented as follows:

You can see that all the elements balance.
PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY 
Writing and Balancing the Equation for a Chemical Reaction
1. Determine what reaction is occurring. What are the reactants, the products, and the 
physical states involved?
2. Write the unbalanced equation that summarizes the reaction described in Step 1.
3. Balance the equation by inspection, starting with the most complicated molecule(s). 
Determine what coefficients are necessary so that the same number of each type of 
atom appears on both reactant and product sides. Do not change the identities 
(formulas) of any of the reactants or products.
CRITICAL THINKING One part of the problem-solving strategy 
for balancing chemical equations is ‚Äústarting with the most complicated 
molecule.‚Äù What if you started with a different molecule? Could you still 
eventually balance the chemical equation? How would this approach be 
different from the suggested technique?

nitrogen gas (consisting of N2 molecules), and water vapor. Balance the equation for 
this reaction.
 
SOLUTION 
1. From the description given, the reactant is solid ammonium dichromate, 
(NH4)2Cr2O7(s), and the products are nitrogen gas, N2(g), water vapor, H2O(g), 
and solid chromium(III) oxide, Cr2O3(s). The formula for chromium(III) oxide 
can be  determined by recognizing that the Roman numeral III means that 
Cr31 ions are present. For a neutral compound, the formula must then be Cr2O3, 
since each oxide ion is O22.
2. The unbalanced equation is
1NH42 2Cr2O71s2 S Cr2O31s2 1 N21g2 1 H2O1g2
3. Note that nitrogen and chromium are balanced (two nitrogen atoms and two 
chromium atoms on each side), but hydrogen and oxygen are not. A coefficient of 
4 for H2O balances the hydrogen atoms:
1NH42 2Cr2O71s2 S Cr2O31s2 1 N21g2 1 4H2O1g2

Note that in balancing the hydrogen we also have balanced the oxygen, since there are 
seven oxygen atoms in the reactants and in the products.

SOLUTION 
1, 2. The unbalanced equation for the reaction is
NH31g2 1 O21g2 S NO1g2 1 H2O1g2
3. Because all the molecules in this equation are of about equal complexity, where 
we start in balancing it is rather arbitrary. Let‚Äôs begin by balancing the hydrogen. 
A coefficient of 2 for NH3 and a coefficient of 3 for H2O give six atoms of hydro-
gen on both sides:
2NH31g2 1 O21g2 S NO1g2 1 3H2O1g2
The nitrogen can be balanced with a coefficient of 2 for NO:
2NH31g2 1 O21g2 S 2NO1g2 1 3H2O1g2
Finally, note that there are two atoms of oxygen on the left and five on the right. The 
oxygen can be balanced with a coefficient of 5
2 for O2:
2NH31g2 1 5
2 O21g2 S 2NO1g2 1 3H2O1g2
However, the usual custom is to have whole-number coefficients. We simply multiply 
the entire equation by 2.
4NH31g2 1 5O21g2 S 4NO1g2 1 6H2O1g2
Reality Check There are 4 N, 12 H, and 10 O on both sides, so the equation is 
balanced.
We can represent this balanced equation visually as

3.10  Stoichiometric Calculations: 
Amounts of Reactants 
and Products
As we have seen in previous sections of this chapter, the coefficients in chemical equa-
tions represent numbers of molecules, not masses of molecules. However, when a 
reaction is to be run in a laboratory or chemical plant, the amounts of substances 
needed cannot be determined by counting molecules directly. Counting is always done 
by weighing. In this section we will see how chemical equations can be used to deter-
mine the masses of reacting chemicals.
 
To develop the principles for dealing with the stoichiometry of reactions, we will 
consider the reaction of propane with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water. We 
will consider the question: ‚ÄúWhat mass of oxygen will react with 96.1 g of propane?‚Äù 
3.10
Before doing any calculations involving a 
chemical reaction, be sure the equation for 
the reaction is balanced.

In doing stoichiometry, the first thing we must do is write the balanced chemical equa-
tion for the reaction. In this case the balanced equation is
C3H81g2 1 5O21g2 h 3CO21g2 1 4H2O1g2
which can be visualized as
+
+
This equation means that 1 mole of C3H8 reacts with 5 moles of O2 to produce 3 moles 
of CO2 and 4 moles of H2O. To use this equation to find the masses of reactants and prod-
ucts, we must be able to convert between masses and moles of substances. Thus we must 
first ask: ‚ÄúHow many moles of propane are present in 96.1 g of propane?‚Äù The molar 
mass of propane to three significant figures is 44.1 (that is, 3 3 12.01 1 8 3 1.008). The 
moles of propane can be calculated as follows:
96.1 g C3H8 3 1 mol C3H8
44.1 g C3H8
5 2.18 mol C3H8
T
he next time you visit a gas station, 
take a moment to note the octane 
rating that accompanies the grade of 
gasoline that you are purchasing. The 
gasoline is priced according to its 
octane rating‚Äîa measure of the fuel‚Äôs 
antiknock properties. In a conventional 
internal combustion engine, gasoline 
vapors and air are drawn into the com-
bustion cylinder on the downward 
stroke of the piston. This air‚Äìfuel mix-
ture is compressed on the upward 
piston stroke (compression stroke), and 
a spark from the sparkplug ignites the 
mix. The rhythmic combustion of the 
air‚Äìfuel mix occurring sequentially in 
several cylinders furnishes the power 
to propel the vehicle down the road. 
Excessive heat and pressure (or poor-
quality fuel) within the cylinder may 
cause the premature combustion of 
the mixture‚Äîcommonly known as 
engine ‚Äúknock‚Äù or ‚Äúping.‚Äù Over time, this 
engine knock can damage the engine, 
resulting in inefficient performance 
and costly repairs.
A consumer typically is faced with 
three choices of gasoline, with octane 
ratings of 87 (regular), 89 (midgrade), 
and 93 (premium). But if you happen to 
travel or live in the higher elevations of 
the Rocky Mountain states, you might 
be surprised to find different octane 
ratings at the gasoline pumps. The 
reason for this provides a lesson in 
stoichiometry. At higher elevations the 
air is less dense‚Äîthe volume of oxygen 
per unit volume of air is smaller. Most 
engines are designed to achieve a 14;1 
oxygen-to-fuel ratio in the cylinder prior 
to combustion. If less oxygen is avail-
able, then less fuel is required to achieve 
this optimal ratio. In turn, the lower 
volumes of oxygen and fuel result in a 
lower pressure in the cylinder. Because 
high pressure tends to promote knock-
ing, the lower pressure within engine 
cylinders at higher elevations promotes 
a more controlled  combustion of the 
air‚Äìfuel mixture, and therefore octane 
 requirements are lower. While consum-
ers in the Rocky Mountain states can 
purchase three grades of gasoline, the 
octane ratings of these fuel blends are 
different from those in the rest of the 
United States. In Denver, Colorado, 
regular gasoline is 85 octane, midgrade 
is 87 octane, and premium is 91 
octane‚Äî2 points lower than gasoline 
sold in most of the rest of the country.

Next we must take into account the fact that each mole of propane reacts with 
5 moles of oxygen. The best way to do this is to use the balanced equation to construct 
a mole ratio. In this case we want to convert from moles of propane to moles of oxy-
gen. From the balanced equation, we see that 5 moles of O2 are required for each mole 
of C3H8, so the appropriate ratio is
5 mol O2
1 mol C3H8
Multiplying the number of moles of C3H8 by this factor gives the number of moles 
of O2 required:
2.18 mol C3H8 3
5 mol O2
1 mol C3H8
5 10.9 mol O2
Notice that the mole ratio is set up so that the moles of C3H8 cancel out, and the units 
that result are moles of O2.
 
Since the original question asked for the mass of oxygen needed to react with  
96.1 g of propane, the 10.9 moles of O2 must be converted to grams. Since the molar 
mass of O2 is 32.0 g/mol,
10.9 mol O2 3 32.0 g O2
1 mol O2
5 349 g O2
Therefore, 349 g of oxygen are required to burn 96.1 g of propane.
 
This example can be extended by asking: ‚ÄúWhat mass of carbon dioxide is pro-
duced when 96.1 g of propane are combusted with oxygen?‚Äù In this case we must 
convert between moles of propane and moles of carbon dioxide. This can be accom-
plished by looking at the balanced equation, which shows that 3 moles of CO2 are 
produced for each mole of C3H8 reacted. The mole ratio needed to convert from moles 
of propane to moles of carbon dioxide is
3 mol CO2
1 mol C3H8
The conversion is
2.18 mol C3H8 3 3 mol CO2
1 mol C3H8
5 6.54 mol CO2
Then, using the molar mass of CO2 (44.0 g/mol), we calculate the mass of CO2  produced:
6.54 mol CO2 3 44.0 g CO2
1 mol CO2
5 288 g CO2
We will now summarize the sequence of steps needed to carry out stoichiometric 
 calculations.
96.1 g C3H8
2.18 mol C3H8 
6.54 mol CO2 
1 mol C3H8
44.1 g C3H8
3 mol CO2
1 mol C3H8
288 g CO2 
1 mol CO2
44.0 g CO2
CRITICAL THINKING Your lab partner has made the observation 
that you always take the mass of chemicals in lab, but then you use mole 
ratios to balance the equation. ‚ÄúWhy not use the masses in the equation?‚Äù your 
partner asks. What if your lab partner decided to balance equations by using 
masses as coefficients? Is this even possible? Why or why not?

3.11 The Concept of Limiting Reactant
Suppose you have a part-time job in a sandwich shop. One very popular sandwich is 
always made as follows:

Assume that you come to work one day and find the following quantities of ingredients:
8 slices bread    9 slices meat    5 slices cheese
How many sandwiches can you make? What will be left over?
To solve this problem, let‚Äôs see how many sandwiches we can make with each

How many sandwiches can you make? The answer is three. When you run out of meat, 
you must stop making sandwiches. The meat is the limiting ingredient (Fig. 3.9).
What do you have left over? Making three sandwiches requires six pieces of bread. 
You started with eight slices, so you have two slices of bread left. You also used three 
pieces of cheese for the three sandwiches, so you have two pieces of cheese left.
In this example, the ingredient present in the largest number (the meat) was actually 
the component that limited the number of sandwiches you could make. This situation 
arose because each sandwich required three slices of meat‚Äîmore than the quantity 
required of any other ingredient.
When molecules react with each other to form products, considerations very similar 
to those involved in making sandwiches arise. We can illustrate these ideas with the 
reaction of N2(g) and H2(g) to form NH3(g):
N21g2 1 3H21g2 h 2NH31g2
Consider the following container of N2(g) and H2(g):
H2

What will this container look like if the reaction between N2 and H2 proceeds to comple-
tion? To answer this question, you need to remember that each N2 requires 3 H2 molecules 
to form 2 NH3. To make things clear, we will circle groups of reactants:
H2
NH3
N2
Before the reaction
After the reaction
In this case, the mixture of N2 and H2 contained just the number of molecules needed 
to form NH3 with nothing left over. That is, the ratio of the number of H2 molecules to 
N2 molecules was
15H2
5N2
5 3H2
1N2
This ratio exactly matches the numbers in the balanced equation
3H21g2 1 N21g2 h 2NH31g2
This type of mixture is called a stoichiometric mixture‚Äîone that contains the 
relative amounts of reactants that match the numbers in the balanced equation. In this 
case all reactants will be consumed to form products.
Now consider another container of N2(g) and H2(g):
H2
N2
What will the container look like if the reaction between N2(g) and H2(g) proceeds to 
completion? Remember that each N2 requires 3 H2. Circling groups of reactants, we have
H2
NH3
N2

After the reaction

In this case, the hydrogen (H2) is limiting. That is, the H2 molecules are used up 
before all the N2 molecules are consumed. In this situation the amount of hydrogen 
limits the amount of product (ammonia) that can form‚Äîhydrogen is the limiting 
reactant. Some N2 molecules are left over in this case because the reaction runs out of 
H2 molecules first. 
Although this pictorial representation is a good visual to show us what is happening 
in the course of the reaction, we can also present this information in a table. To do so 
we must use the balanced chemical equation. Remember that the balanced equation 
tells us the relative numbers of molecules that react. The relative numbers of molecules 
mixed together are usually different from the coefficients in the balanced equation. In 
this case we are starting with 5 molecules of N2 and 9 molecules of H2. These are 
numbers we use when trying to determine which reactant is limiting and how much 
product we form. We can organize our data as shown below:

Note that the 5 molecules of N2 and 9 molecules of H2 (and no NH3 initially) are 
presented in the Before row. The Change row represents how much of each substance 
reacts or is produced. The After row represents how much of each substance remains 
in the final reaction mixture. We can tell from the pictorial representation which num-
bers belong in this table, but it is not always practical to do this, so let‚Äôs look at a 
general way to determine these numbers.
Because we are assuming that the reaction goes to completion, we know that at 
least one of the values for N2 or H2 must be zero (0) in the After row. That is, we run 
out of at least one of the reactants. Thus, the two possibilities are:
Possibility I: H2 runs out first
N2

For Possibility I we are assuming that we run out of H2, and for Possibility II we are 
assuming we run out of N2. How do we decide which of the possibilities is correct? We 
decide from our understanding of what a balanced chemical equation represents‚Äîthe 
relative numbers of molecules that react. Recall that this is what the Change row rep-
resents as well. This brings us to a crucial idea: the ratio of the numbers in the Change 
row has to be the same as the ratio of the coefficients in the balanced equation. Let‚Äôs 
reconsider, then, the two possibilities with this in mind:
103

How did we come up with these numbers? We know the numbers in blue because 
the numbers in the Before row reflect the original mixture. Because we are assuming 
that the H2 runs out first we have 29 in the Change row. We determine the other two 
numbers in the Change row by using the ratio of the coefficients in the balanced equa-
tion. Because the ratio of the coefficients of N2 to H2 is 1;3, we can determine that the 
change for H2 must be 23. That is, one-third as much N2 is used as H2. The reactants 
are consumed, so the sign is negative. The ratio of the coefficients of N2 to NH3 is 1;2, 
so we can determine the change for NH3 must be 16. That is, twice as much NH3 is 
produced as N2¬†consumed.
We can use similar reasoning to complete the table for Possibility II:
Possibility II: N2 runs out first so the change for N2 is 25:
N2

2NH3

Now we can determine that the change for H2 must be 215 since three times as 
much H2 is consumed as N2. Also, the change for NH3 must be 110 (twice as much 
NH3 is formed as N2 consumed).
We can see why N2 is not limiting by looking at Possibility II. For all of the N2 to 
react, we need 6 more molecules of H2 than we have. Because we cannot have a nega-
tive amount of a substance, Possibility II must not represent the reaction correctly.
Notice also that Possibility I conveys all of the information we initially saw in the 
picture of the reaction container. We begin with 5 molecules of N2 and 9 molecules of 
H2, and after the reaction is complete we are left with 2 molecules of N2 and 6 mole-
cules of NH3.
Using a table such as this is convenient in that all of the information is conveyed: 
we now know which reactant runs out first, how much of the excess reactant is left 
over, and how much product is formed. It also emphasizes an understanding of what a 
balanced equation means because we have to use the ratio for the balanced equation in 
the Change row.
To determine how much product can be formed from a given mixture of reac-
tants, we have to look for the reactant that is limiting‚Äîthe one that runs out first 
and thus limits the amount of product that can form. In some cases, the mixture of 
reactants might be stoichiometric‚Äîthat is, all reactants run out at the same time. In 
general, however, you cannot assume that a given mixture of reactants is a stoichio-
metric mixture, so you must determine whether one of the reactants is limiting. The 
reactant that runs out first and thus limits the amounts of products that can form 
is called the limiting reactant.
To this point we have considered examples where the numbers of reactant mole-
cules could be counted. In ‚Äúreal life‚Äù you can‚Äôt count the molecules directly‚Äîyou 
can‚Äôt see them, and even if you could, there would be far too many to count. Instead, 
you must count by weighing. We must therefore explore how to find the limiting reac-
tant, given the masses of the reactants.

Determination of Limiting Reactant Using 
Reactant Quantities
There are two ways to determine the limiting reactant in a chemical reaction. One 
involves comparing the moles of reactants to see which runs out first. We will consider 
this approach here.
 
In the laboratory or chemical plant, we work with much larger quantities than the 
few molecules of the preceding example. Therefore, we must learn to deal with limit-
ing reactants using moles. The ideas are exactly the same, except that we are using 
moles of molecules instead of individual molecules. For example, suppose 25.0 kg of 
nitrogen and 5.00 kg of hydrogen are mixed and reacted to form ammonia. How do we 
calculate the mass of ammonia produced when this reaction is run to completion (until 
one of the reactants is completely consumed)?
 
As in the preceding example, we must use the balanced equation
N21g2 1 3H21g2 h 2NH31g2
to determine whether nitrogen or hydrogen is the limiting reactant and then to deter-
mine the amount of ammonia that is formed. We first calculate the moles of reactants 
present:
 25.0 kg N2 3 1000 g N2
1 kg N2
3 1 mol N2
28.0 g N2
5 8.93 3 102 mol N2
 5.00 kg H2 3 1000 g H2
1 kg H2
3 1 mol H2
2.016 g H2
5 2.48 3 103 mol H2
Since 1 mole of N2 reacts with 3 moles of H2, the number of moles of H2 that will react 
exactly with 8.93 3 102 moles of N2 is
8.93 3 102 mol N2 3 3 mol H2
1 mol N2
5 2.68 3 103 mol H2
To determine which reactant is limiting, we can place our data in a table as before, in 
this case looking at the Before and Change rows:
Possibility I: N2 runs out first
N2
1
3H2 
S
2NH3
Before
8.93 3 103
2.48 3 103
0
Change
28.93 3 103
22.68 3 103
Thus 8.93 3 102 moles of N2 require 2.68 3 103 moles of H2 to react completely. 
However, in this case, only 2.48 √ó 103 moles of H2 are present. This means that the 
hydrogen will be consumed before the nitrogen. But what if we had chosen the case 
where the H2 runs out first? Assuming that 2.48 3 103 moles of H2 are used, we can 
calculate the moles of N2 that would be required. 
2.48 3 103 mol H2 3 1 mol N2
3 mol H2
5 8.27 3 102 mol N2
Let‚Äôs represent these data in table form, once again focusing on the Before and 
Change rows:
Possibility II: H2 runs out first
N2

3H2 
S
2NH3

8.93 3 103

Always determine which reactant is  
limiting.

Thus 2.48 3 103 moles of H2 require 8.27 3 102 moles of N2. Because 8.93 3 102 moles 
of N2 are actually present, the nitrogen is in excess. Thus hydrogen is the limiting reac-
tant in this particular situation, and we must use the amount of hydrogen to compute 
the quantity of ammonia formed:
2.48 3 103 mol H2 3 2 mol NH3
3 mol H2
5 1.65 3 103 mol NH3
Converting moles to kilograms gives
 1.65 3 103 mol NH3 3 17.0 g NH3
1 mol NH3
5 2.80 3 104 g NH3 5 28.0 kg NH3
Determination of Limiting Reactant Using 
Quantities of Products Formed
A second method for determining which reactant in a chemical reaction is limiting is 
to consider the amounts of products that can be formed by completely consuming each 
reactant. We can see this by considering our results when we reacted 5 molecules of N2 
with 9 molecules of H2 to form NH3:
Possibility I: H2 runs out first
N2

3H2 
S
2NH3

Possibility I shows the amount of NH3 formed if H2 is limiting, and Possibility II 
shows us the amount of NH3 formed if N2 is limiting. Possibility I is correct because 
we cannot end up with a negative number of H2 molecules. Notice that the amount 
of NH3 produced in Possibility I is less than that in Possibility II. This leads us  
to the general idea that the reactant that produces the smallest amount of product 
must run out first and thus be limiting. As another example, consider again the reac-
tion of 25.0 kg (8.93 3 102 moles) of nitrogen with 5.00 kg (2.48 3 103 moles) of 
hydrogen.
 
We will now use these amounts of reactants to determine how much NH3 would 
form. Since 1 mole of N2 forms 2 moles of NH3, the amount of NH3 that would be 
formed if all of the N2 was used up is calculated as follows:
8.93 3 102 mol N2 3 2 mol NH3
1 mol N2
5 1.79 3 103 mol NH3
Next we will calculate how much NH3 would be formed if the H2 was completely  
used up:
2.48 3 103 mol H2 3 2 mol NH3
3 mol H2
5 1.65 3 103 mol NH3
106
CHAPTER 3 Stoichiometry

Because a smaller amount of NH3 is produced from the H2 than from the N2, the amount 
of H2 must be limiting.
 
Thus because the H2 is the limiting reactant, the amount of NH3 that can form is 
1.65 3 103 moles. Converting moles to kilograms gives:
1.65 3 103 mol NH3 3 17 g NH3
1 mol NH3
5 2.80 3 104 g NH3 5 28.0 kg NH3

How many moles of CuO are required to react with 1.06 moles of NH3?
1.06 mol NH3 3 3 mol CuO
2 mol NH3
5 1.59 mol CuO
Thus 1.59 moles of CuO are required to react with 1.06 moles of NH3. Since only 
1.14 moles of CuO are actually present, the amount of CuO is limiting; CuO will 
run out before NH3 does. We can see this by placing the data in a table:

‚ñ† As we can see, there is not enough CuO to react with all of the NH3, so CuO is 
the limiting reactant.
B. Alternatively we can determine the limiting reactant by computing the moles of 
N2 that would be formed by complete consumption of NH3 and CuO:
 1.06 mol NH3 3 1 mol N2
2 mol NH3
5 0.530 mol N2
 1.14 mol CuO 3 1 mol N2
3 mol CuO 5 0.380 mol N2
As before, we see that the CuO is limiting since it produces the smaller amount of N2.
To find the mass of N2 produced
What are the moles of N2 formed?
Because CuO is the limiting reactant, we must use the amount of CuO to calculate the 
amount of N2 formed.
What is the mole ratio between N2 and CuO in the balanced equation?
1 mol N2
3 mol CuO
What are the moles of N2?
1.14 mol CuO 3 1 mol N2
3 mol CuO 5 0.380 mol N2
What mass of N2 is produced?
Using the molar mass of N2 (28.02 g/mol), we can calculate the mass of N2 
produced:
‚ñ† 0.380 mol N2 3 28.02 g N2
1 mol N2
5 10.6 g N2
See Exercises 3.123 through 3.128
 
The amount of a product formed when the limiting reactant is completely con-
sumed is called the theoretical yield of that product. In Example 3.17, 10.6 g of nitro-
gen represent the theoretical yield. This is the maximum amount of nitrogen that can 
108

be produced from the quantities of reactants used. Actually, the amount of product 
predicted by the theoretical yield is seldom obtained because of side reactions (other 
reactions that involve one or more of the reactants or products) and other complica-
tions. The actual yield of product is often given as a percentage of the theoretical yield. 
This is called the percent yield:
Actual yield
Theoretical yield 3 100% 5 percent yield
For example, if the reaction considered in Example 3.17 actually gave 6.63 g of 
 nitrogen instead of the predicted 10.6 g, the percent yield of nitrogen would be
6.63 g N2
10.6 g N2
3 100% 5 62.5%
Calculating Percent Yield
Methanol (CH3OH), also called methyl alcohol, is the simplest alcohol. It is used  
as a fuel in race cars and is a potential replacement for gasoline. Methanol can  
be manufactured by combining gaseous carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Suppose 
68.5 kg CO(g) is  reacted with 8.60 kg H2(g). Calculate the theoretical yield of 
methanol. If 3.57 3 104 g CH3OH is actually produced, what is the percent yield of 
methanol?

We can determine the limiting reactant by calculating the amounts of CH3OH formed 
by complete consumption of CO(g) and H2(g):
 2.44 3 103 mol CO 3 1 mol CH3OH

5 2.44 3 103 mol CH3OH
 4.27 3 103 mol H2 3 1 mol CH3OH

5 2.14 3 103 mol CH3OH
Since complete consumption of the H2 produces the smaller amount of CH3OH, the H2 
is the limiting reactant as we determined above.
To calculate the theoretical yield of methanol
What are the moles of CH3OH formed?
We must use the amount of H2 and the mole ratio between H2 and CH3OH to determine 
the maximum amount of methanol that can be produced:
4.27 3 103 mol H2 3 1 mol CH3OH
2 mol H2
5 2.14 3 103 mol CH3OH

‚ñ† Thus, from the amount of reactants given, the maximum amount of CH3OH 
that can be formed is 6.86 3 104 g. This is the theoretical yield.

Empirical formula
‚ùØ The simplest whole-number ratio of the various types of atoms in a compound
‚ùØ Can be obtained from the mass percent of elements in a compound
Molecular formula
‚ùØ For molecular substances:
‚ùØ The formula of the constituent molecules
‚ùØ Always an integer multiple of the empirical formula
‚ùØ For ionic substances:
‚ùØ The same as the empirical formula
Chemical reactions
‚ùØ Reactants are turned into products.
‚ùØ Atoms are neither created nor destroyed.
‚ùØ All of the atoms present in the reactants must also be present in the products.
Characteristics of a chemical equation
‚ùØ Represents a chemical reaction
‚ùØ Reactants on the left side of the arrow, products on the right side
‚ùØ When balanced, gives the relative numbers of reactant and product molecules or ions
Stoichiometry calculations
‚ùØ Amounts of reactants consumed and products formed can be determined from the balanced 
chemical equation.
‚ùØ The limiting reactant is the one consumed first, thus limiting the amount of product that can 
form.
Yield
‚ùØ The theoretical yield is the maximum amount that can be produced from a given amount of 
the limiting reactant.
‚ùØ The actual yield, the amount of product actually obtained, is always less than the theoretical 
yield.
‚ùØ Percent yield 5
actual yield 1g2
theoretical yield 1g2 3 100%

ous reactions, depending heavily on analyses of blood and other body fluids. In addi-
tion to the common tests for sugar, cholesterol, and iron, analyses for specific chemical 
markers allow detection of many diseases before obvious symptoms occur.
Aqueous chemistry is also important in our environment. In recent years, contami-
nation of the groundwater by substances such as chloroform and nitrates has been 
widely publicized. Water is essential for life, and the maintenance of an ample supply 
of clean water is crucial to all civilization.
To understand the chemistry that occurs in such diverse places as the human body, 
the atmosphere, the groundwater, the oceans, the local water treatment plant, your hair 
as you shampoo it, and so on, we must understand how substances dissolved in water 
react with each other.
However, before we can understand solution reactions, we need to discuss the 
nature of solutions in which water is the dissolving medium, or solvent. These solu-
tions are called aqueous solutions. In this chapter we will study the nature of 
materials after they are dissolved in water and various types of reactions that occur 
among these substances. You will see that the procedures developed in Chapter 3 to 
deal with chemical reactions work very well for reactions that take place in aqueous 
solutions. To understand the types of reactions that occur in aqueous solutions, we 
must first explore the types of species present. This requires an understanding of the 
nature of water.
4.1 Water, the Common Solvent
Water is one of the most important substances on the earth. It is essential for sustaining 
the reactions that keep us alive, but it also affects our lives in many indirect ways. 
Water helps moderate the earth‚Äôs temperature; it cools automobile engines, nuclear 
power plants, and many industrial processes; it provides a means of transportation on 
the earth‚Äôs surface and a medium for the growth of a myriad of creatures we use as 
food; and much more.
One of the most valuable properties of water is its ability to dissolve many different 
substances. For example, salt ‚Äúdisappears‚Äù when you sprinkle it into the water used to 
cook vegetables, as does sugar when you add it to your iced tea. In each case the ‚Äúdis-
appearing‚Äù substance is obviously still present‚Äîyou can taste it. What happens when 
a solid dissolves? To understand this process, we need to consider the nature of water. 
Liquid water consists of a collection of H2O molecules. An individual H2O molecule 
is ‚Äúbent‚Äù or V-shaped, with an HOOOH angle of approximately 105 degrees:
H
H
O
105¬∞
The OOH bonds in the water molecule are covalent bonds formed by electron shar-
ing between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms. However, the electrons of the bond are 
not shared equally between these atoms. For reasons we will discuss in later chapters, 
oxygen has a greater attraction for electrons than does hydrogen. If the electrons were 
shared equally between the two atoms, both would be electrically neutral because, on 
average, the number of electrons around each would equal the number of protons in 
that nucleus. However, because the oxygen atom has a greater attraction for electrons, 
the shared electrons tend to spend more time close to the oxygen than to either of the 
hydrogens. Thus the oxygen atom gains a slight excess of negative charge, and the 
hydrogen atoms become slightly positive. This is shown in Fig. 4.1, where d (delta) 
indicates a partial charge (less than one unit of charge). Because of this unequal charge 
distribution, water is said to be a polar molecule. It is this polarity that gives water its 
great ability to dissolve compounds.

A schematic of an ionic solid dissolving in water is shown in Fig. 4.2. Note that the 
‚Äúpositive ends‚Äù of the water molecules are attracted to the negatively charged anions 
and that the ‚Äúnegative ends‚Äù are attracted to the positively charged cations. This pro-
cess is called hydration. The hydration of its ions tends to cause a salt to ‚Äúfall apart‚Äù 
in the water, or to dissolve. The strong forces present among the positive and negative 
ions of the solid are replaced by strong water‚Äìion interactions.
 
It is very important to recognize that when ionic substances (salts) dissolve in water, 
they break up into the individual cations and anions. For instance, when ammonium 
nitrate (NH4NO3) dissolves in water, the resulting solution contains NH41 and NO32 
ions moving around independently. This process can be represented as
NH4NO31s2  888n NH4
11aq2 1 NO3
21aq2
where (aq) designates that the ions are hydrated by unspecified numbers of water 
molecules.
 
The solubility of ionic substances in water varies greatly. For example, sodium 
chloride is quite soluble in water, whereas silver chloride (contains Ag1 and Cl2 ions) 
is only very slightly soluble. The differences in the solubilities of ionic compounds in 
water  typically depend on the relative attractions of the ions for each other (these 
forces hold the solid together) and the attractions of the ions for water molecules 
(which cause the solid to disperse [dissolve] in water). Solubility is a complex topic 
that we will explore in much more detail in Chapter 11. However, the most important 
thing to remember at this point is that when an ionic solid does dissolve in water, the 
ions become hydrated and are dispersed (move around independently).
 
Water also dissolves many nonionic substances. Ethanol (C2H5OH), for example, is 
very soluble in water. Wine, beer, and mixed drinks are aqueous solutions of ethanol 
and other substances. Why is ethanol so soluble in water? The answer lies in the  
structure of the alcohol molecules, which is shown in Fig. 4.3(a). The molecule con-
tains a polar OOH bond like those in water, which makes it very compatible with 
water. The interaction of water with ethanol is represented in Fig. 4.3(b).
 
Many substances do not dissolve in water. Pure water will not, for example, dis-
solve animal fat, because fat molecules are nonpolar and do not interact effectively

with polar water molecules. In general, polar and ionic substances are expected to be 
more soluble in water than nonpolar substances. ‚ÄúLike dissolves like‚Äù is a useful rule 
for predicting solubility. We will explore the basis for this generalization when we 
discuss the details of solution formation in Chapter 11.
CRITICAL THINKING What if no ionic solids were soluble in 
water? How would this affect the way reactions occur in aqueous solutions?
4.2 The Nature of Aqueous 
Solutions: Strong and Weak 
Electrolytes
As we discussed in Chapter 1, a solution is a homogeneous mixture. It is the same 
throughout (the first sip of a cup of coffee is the same as the last), but its composition 
can be varied by changing the amount of dissolved substances (you can make weak or 
strong coffee). In this section we will consider what happens when a substance, the 
solute, is dissolved in liquid water, the solvent.
One useful property for characterizing a solution is its electrical conductivity, its 
ability to conduct an electric current. This characteristic can be checked conveniently 
by using an apparatus like the ones shown in Fig. 4.4. If the solution in the container 
conducts electricity, the bulb lights. Pure water is not an electrical conductor. However, 
some aqueous solutions conduct current very efficiently, and the bulb shines very 
brightly; these solutions contain strong electrolytes. Other solutions conduct only a 
small current, and the bulb glows dimly; these solutions contain weak electrolytes. 
Some solutions permit no current to flow, and the bulb remains unlit; these solutions 
contain nonelectrolytes.
The basis for the conductivity properties of solutions was first correctly identified 
by Svante Arrhenius (1859‚Äì1927), then a Swedish graduate student in physics, who 
carried out research on the nature of solutions at the University of Uppsala in the early 
1880s. Arrhenius came to believe that the conductivity of solutions arose from the 
presence of ions, an idea that was at first scorned by the majority of the scientific estab-
lishment. However, in the late 1890s when atoms were found to contain charged par-
ticles, the ionic theory suddenly made sense and became widely accepted.
As Arrhenius postulated, the extent to which a solution can conduct an electric 
current depends directly on the number of ions present. Some materials, such as 
sodium chloride, readily produce ions in aqueous solution and thus are strong electro-
lytes. Other substances, such as acetic acid, produce relatively few ions when dis-
solved in water and are weak electrolytes. A third class of materials, such as sugar, 
form virtually no ions when dissolved in water and are nonelectrolytes.

An electrolyte is a substance that when 
dissolved in water produces a solution that

4.2 The Nature of Aqueous Solutions: Strong and Weak Electrolytes

Strong Electrolytes
Strong electrolytes are substances that are completely ionized when they are dissolved 
in water, as represented in Fig. 4.4(a). We will consider several classes of strong elec-
trolytes: (1) soluble salts, (2) strong acids, and (3) strong bases.
 
As shown in Fig. 4.2, a salt consists of an array of cations and anions that separate 
and become hydrated when the salt dissolves. For example, when NaCl dissolves in 
water, it produces hydrated Na1 and Cl2 ions in the solution (Fig. 4.5). Virtually no 
NaCl units are present. Thus NaCl is a strong electrolyte. It is important to recognize 
that these aqueous solutions contain millions of water molecules that we will not 
include in our molecular-level drawings.
 
One of Arrhenius‚Äôs most important discoveries concerned the nature of acids. Acid-
ity was first associated with the sour taste of citrus fruits. In fact, the word acid comes

directly from the Latin word acidus, meaning ‚Äúsour.‚Äù The mineral acids sulfuric acid 
(H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3), so named because they were originally obtained by 
the treatment of minerals, were discovered around 1300.
 
Although acids were known for hundreds of years before the time of Arrhenius, no 
one had recognized their essential nature. In his studies of solutions, Arrhenius found 
that when the substances HCl, HNO3, and H2SO4 were dissolved in water, they behaved 
as strong electrolytes. He postulated that this was the result of ionization reactions in 
water, for example:
HCl 888n H11aq2 1 Cl21aq2
HNO3 888n H11aq2 1 NO3
21aq2
H2SO4 888n H11aq2 1 HSO4
21aq2
Thus Arrhenius proposed that an acid is a substance that produces H1 ions (protons) 
when it is dissolved in water.
 
We now understand that the polar nature of water plays a very important role in 
causing acids to produce H1 in solution. In fact, it is most appropriate to represent the 
‚Äúionization‚Äù of an acid as follows:
HA1aq2 1 H2O1l2 h H3O11aq2 1 A21aq2
which emphasizes the important role of water in this process. We will have much more 
to say about this process in Chapter 14.
Studies of conductivity show that when HCl, HNO3, and H2SO4 are placed in  water, 
virtually every molecule ionizes. These substances are strong electrolytes and are thus 
called strong acids. All three are very important chemicals, and much more will be said 
about them as we proceed. However, at this point the following facts are important:
Sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and hydrochloric acid are aqueous solutions and should be 
written in chemical equations as H2SO4(aq), HNO3(aq), and HCl(aq), respectively, 
although they often appear without the (aq) symbol.
A strong acid is one that completely dissociates into its ions. Thus, if 100 mol-
ecules of HCl are dissolved in water, 100 H1 ions and 100 Cl2 ions are produced. 
Virtually no HCl molecules exist in aqueous solutions (Fig. 4.6).
Sulfuric acid is a special case. The formula H2SO4 indicates that this acid can 
produce two H1 ions per molecule when dissolved in water. However, only the 
first H1 ion is completely dissociated. The second H1 ion can be pulled off under 
certain conditions, which we will discuss later. Thus an aqueous solution of H2SO4
contains mostly H1 ions and HSO42 ions.
 
Another important class of strong electrolytes consists of the strong bases,  
soluble ionic compounds containing the hydroxide ion (OH2). When these compounds 
are dissolved in water, the cations and OH2 ions separate and move independently. 
Solutions containing bases have a bitter taste and a slippery feel. The most common 
basic solutions are those produced when solid sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium 
hydroxide (KOH) is dissolved in water to produce ions, as follows (Fig. 4.7):
NaOH1s2  888n Na11aq2 1 OH21aq2
KOH1s2  888n K11aq2 1 OH21aq2
Weak Electrolytes
Weak electrolytes are substances that exhibit a small degree of ionization in water. 
That is, they produce relatively few ions when dissolved in water, as shown in 
Fig. 4.4(b). The most common weak electrolytes are weak acids and weak bases.
The main acidic component of vinegar is acetic acid (HC2H3O2). The formula is 
 written to indicate that acetic acid has two chemically distinct types of hydrogen

atoms. Formulas for acids are often written with the acidic hydrogen atom or atoms 
(any that will produce H1 ions in solution) listed first. If any nonacidic hydrogens are 
present, they are written later in the formula. Thus the formula HC2H3O2 indicates one 
acidic and three nonacidic hydrogen atoms. The dissociation reaction for acetic acid in 
water can be written as follows:
HC2H3O21aq2 1 H2O1l2 m H3O11aq2 1 C2H3O2

Acetic acid is very different from the strong acids because only about 1% of its mol-
ecules dissociate in aqueous solutions at typical concentrations. For example, in a 
S
cience is a human endeavor, subject 
to human frailties and governed by 
personalities, politics, and prejudices. 
One of the best illustrations of the 
often bumpy path of the advancement 
of scientific knowledge is the story of 
Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius.
When Arrhenius began studies 
toward his doctorate at the University of 
Uppsala around 1880, he chose to inves-
tigate the passage of electricity through 
solutions, a mystery that had baffled 
scientists for a century. The first experi-
ments had been done in the 1770s by 
Cavendish, who compared the conduc-
tivity of salt solution with that of rain 
water using his own physiologic reac-
tion to the electric shocks he received! 
Arrhenius had an array of instruments to 
measure electric current, but the pro-
cess of carefully weighing, measuring, 
and recording data from a multitude of 
experiments was a tedious one.
After his long series of experiments 
was performed,  Arrhenius quit his 
laboratory bench and returned to his 
country home to try to formulate a 
model that could account for his data. 
He wrote, ‚ÄúI got the idea in the night of 
the 17th of May in the year 1883, and I 
could not sleep that night until I had 
worked through the whole problem.‚Äù 
His idea was that ions were responsible 
for conducting electricity through a 
solution.
Back at Uppsala, Arrhenius took his 
doctoral dissertation containing the 
new theory to his advisor, Professor 
Cleve, an eminent chemist and the 
discoverer of the elements holmium 
and thulium. Cleve‚Äôs uninterested 
response was what Arrhenius had 
expected. It was in keeping with Cleve‚Äôs 
resistance to new ideas‚Äîhe had not 
even accepted Mendeleev‚Äôs periodic 
table, introduced 10 years earlier.
It is a long-standing custom that 
before a doctoral degree is granted, the 
dissertation must be defended before a 
panel of professors. Although this 
procedure is still followed at most 
universities today, the problems are 
usually worked out in private with the 
evaluating professors before the actual 
defense. However, when Arrhenius did 
it, the dissertation defense was an open 
debate, which could be rancorous and 
humiliating. Knowing that it would be 
unwise to antagonize his professors, 
Arrhenius downplayed his convictions 
about his new theory as he defended 
his dissertation. His diplomacy paid off: 
He was awarded his degree, albeit 
reluctantly, because the professors still 
did not believe his model and consid-
ered him to be a marginal scientist, at 
best.
Such a setback could have ended 
his scientific career, but Arrhenius was 
a crusader; he was determined to see 
his theory triumph. He promptly 
embarked on a political campaign, 
enlisting the aid of several prominent 
scientists, to get his theory accepted.
Ultimately, the ionic theory tri-
umphed. Arrhenius‚Äôs fame spread, and 
honors were heaped on him, culminat-
ing in the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 
1903. Not one to rest on his laurels, 
Arrhenius turned to new fields, includ-
ing astronomy; he formulated a new 
theory that the solar system may have 
come into being through the collision 
of stars. His exceptional versatility led 
him to study the use of serums to fight 
disease, energy resources and conser-
vation, and the origin of life.
Additional insight on Arrhenius and his 
scientific career can be  obtained from his 
address on receiving the Willard Gibbs 
Award. See Journal of the American Chemical 
Society 36 (1912): 353.

solution containing 0.1 mole of HC2H3O2 per liter, for every 100 molecules of HC2H3O2
originally dissolved in water, approximately 99 molecules of HC2H3O2 remain intact 
(Fig. 4.8). That is, only one molecule out of every 100 dissociates (to produce one H1
ion and one C2H3O22 ion). The double arrow indicates the reaction can occur in  either 
direction.
 
Because acetic acid is a weak electrolyte, it is called a weak acid. Any acid, such 
as acetic acid, that dissociates (ionizes) only to a slight extent in aqueous solutions is 
called a weak acid. We will explore the subject of weak acids in detail in Chapter 14.
 
The most common weak base is ammonia (NH3). When ammonia is dissolved in 
 water, it reacts as follows:
NH31aq2 1 H2O1l2 m NH4
11aq2 1 OH21aq2
The solution is basic because OH2 ions are produced. Ammonia is called a weak base 
because the resulting solution is a weak electrolyte; that is, very few ions are formed. 
In fact, in a solution containing 0.1 mole of NH3 per liter, for every 100 molecules of 
NH3 originally dissolved, only one NH41 ion and one OH2 ion are produced; 99 mol-
ecules of NH3 remain unreacted (Fig. 4.9). The double arrow indicates the reaction can 
occur in either direction.
Nonelectrolytes
Nonelectrolytes are substances that dissolve in water but do not produce any ions, as 
shown in Fig. 4.4(c). An example of a nonelectrolyte is ethanol (see Fig. 4.3 for the 
structural formula). When ethanol dissolves, entire C2H5OH molecules are dispersed 
in the water. Since the molecules do not break up into ions, the resulting solution does 
not conduct an electric current. Another common nonelectrolyte is table sugar (sucrose, 
C12H22O11), which is very soluble in water but which produces no ions when it dis-
solves. The sucrose molecules remain intact.
 
4.3 The Composition of Solutions
Chemical reactions often take place when two solutions are mixed. To perform stoi-
chiometric calculations in such cases, we must know two things: (1) the nature of 
the reaction, which depends on the exact forms the chemicals take when dissolved, 
and (2) the amounts of chemicals present in the solutions, usually expressed as 
concentrations.
 
The concentration of a solution can be described in many different ways, as we will 
see in Chapter 11. At this point we will consider only the most commonly used expres-
sion of concentration, molarity (M), which is defined as moles of solute per volume of 
solution in liters:
M 5 molarity 5 moles of solute
liters of solution
A solution that is 1.0 molar (written as 1.0 M) contains 1.0 mole of solute per liter of 
solution.

Dilution
To save time and space in the laboratory, routinely used solutions are often purchased 
or prepared in concentrated form (called stock solutions). Water is then added to 
achieve the molarity desired for a particular solution. This process is called dilution. 
For example, the common acids are purchased as concentrated solutions and diluted as 
needed. A typical dilution calculation involves determining how much water must be 
added to an amount of stock solution to achieve a solution of the desired concentration. 
The key to doing these calculations is to remember that
Moles of solute after dilution 5 moles of solute before dilution
because only water (no solute) is added to accomplish the dilution.
 
For example, suppose we need to prepare 500. mL of 1.00 M acetic acid (HC2H3O2) 
from a 17.4-M stock solution of acetic acid. What volume of the stock solution is 
required? The first step is to determine the number of moles of acetic acid in the final 
solution by multiplying the volume by the molarity (remembering that the volume 
must be changed to liters):
500. mL solution 3
1 L solution
1000 mL solution 3 1.00 mol HC2H3O2
L solution
5 0.500 mol HC2H3O2
Thus we need to use a volume of 17.4 M acetic acid that contains 0.500 mole of 
HC2H3O2. That is,
V 3 17.4 mol HC2H3O2
L solution
5 0.500 mol HC2H3O2
Solving for V gives
V 5 0.500 mol HC2H3O2
17.4 mol HC2H3O2
L solution
5 0.0287 L or 28.7 mL solution
Thus to make 500 mL of a 1.00-M acetic acid solution, we can take 28.7 mL of  
17.4 M acetic acid and dilute it to a total volume of 500 mL with distilled water.
Dilution with water does not alter the 
numbers of moles of solute present.

A dilution procedure typically involves two types of glassware: a pipet and a 
 volumetric flask. A pipet is a device for accurately measuring and transferring a given 
volume of solution. There are two common types of pipets: volumetric (or transfer) 
pipets and measuring pipets (Fig. 4.11). Volumetric pipets come in specific sizes, such 
as 5 mL, 10 mL, 25 mL, and so on. Measuring pipets are used to measure  volumes for 
which a  volumetric pipet is not available. For example, we would use a measuring 
pipet as shown in Fig. 4.12 above to deliver 28.7 mL of 17.4 M acetic acid into a 
500-mL volumetric flask and then add water to the mark to perform the dilution 
described previously.

‚ñ†  To make 1.5 L of 0.10 M H2SO4 using 16 M H2SO4, we must take 9.4 mL of the 
concentrated acid and dilute it with water to 1.5 L. The correct way to do this is to 
add the 9.4 mL of acid to about 1 L of distilled water and then dilute to 1.5 L by 
adding more water.
See Exercises 4.41b,d, and 4.42a,b,d
As noted earlier, the central idea in performing the calculations associated with 
dilutions is to recognize that the moles of solute are not changed by the dilution. 
Another way to express this condition is by the following equation:
M1V1 5 M2V2
where M1 and V1 represent the molarity and volume of the original solution (before 
dilution) and M2 and V2 represent the molarity and volume of the diluted solution. This 
equation makes sense because
 M1 3 V1 5 mol solute before dilution
 5 mol solute after dilution 5 M2 3 V2
Repeat Example 4.7 using the equation M1V1 5 M2V2. Note that in doing so,
M1 5 16 M¬†¬†¬†¬†M2 5 0.10 M¬†¬†¬†¬†V2 5 1.5 L
and V1 is the unknown quantity sought. The equation M1V1 5 M2V2 always holds for a 
dilu tion. This equation will be easy for you to remember if you understand where it 
comes from.
 
4.4 Types of Chemical Reactions
Although we have considered many reactions so far in this text, we have examined 
only a tiny fraction of the millions of possible chemical reactions. To make sense of all 
these reactions, we need some system for grouping reactions into classes. Although 
there are many different ways to do this, we will use the system most commonly used 
by practicing chemists:
Types of Solution Reactions
 ¬ª Precipitation reactions
 ¬ª Acid‚Äìbase reactions
 ¬ª Oxidation‚Äìreduction reactions
Virtually all reactions can be put into one of these classes. We will define and illustrate 
each type in the following sections.

4.5 Precipitation Reactions
When two solutions are mixed, an insoluble substance sometimes forms; that is, a 
solid forms and separates from the solution. Such a reaction is called a precipitation 
reaction, and the solid that forms is called a precipitate. For example, a precipitation 
reaction occurs when an aqueous solution of potassium chromate, K2CrO4(aq), 
which is yellow, is added to a colorless aqueous solution containing barium nitrate, 
Ba(NO3)2(aq). As shown in Fig. 4.13, when these solutions are mixed, a yellow 
solid forms. What is the equation that describes this chemical change? To write the 
equation, we must know the identities of the reactants and products. The reactants 
have already been described: K2CrO4(aq) and Ba(NO3)2(aq). Is there some way we 
can predict the identities of the products? In particular, what is the yellow solid?
 
The best way to predict the identity of this solid is to think carefully about what 
products are possible. To do this, we need to know what species are present in the 
solution  after the two reactant solutions are mixed. First, let‚Äôs think about the nature 
of each reactant solution. The designation Ba(NO3)2(aq) means that barium nitrate 
(a white solid) has been dissolved in water. Notice that barium nitrate contains the 
Ba21 and NO32 ions. Remember: In virtually every case, when a solid containing 
ions dissolves in water, the ions separate and move around independently. That is, 
Ba(NO3)2(aq) does not contain Ba(NO3)2 units; it contains separated Ba21 and NO32 
ions [Fig. 4.14(a)].
 
Similarly, since solid potassium chromate contains the K1 and CrO422 ions, an 
aqueous solution of potassium chromate (which is prepared by dissolving solid K2CrO4 
in  water) contains these separated ions [Fig. 4.14(b)].
 
We can represent the mixing of K2CrO4(aq) and Ba(NO3)2(aq) in two ways. First, 
we can write
K2CrO41aq2 1 Ba1NO32 21aq2 h products
4.5
A precipitation reaction also can be called  
a double displacement reaction.
The quantitative aspects of precipitation 
reactions are covered in Chapter 15.
When ionic compounds dissolve in water, 
the resulting solution contains the separated 
ions.

as illustrated in Fig. 4.15(a).
How can some or all of these ions combine to form a yellow solid? This is not an 
easy question to answer. In fact, predicting the products of a chemical reaction is one 
of the hardest things a beginning chemistry student is asked to do. Even an experi-
enced chemist, when confronted with a new reaction, is often not sure what will hap-
pen. The chemist tries to think of the various possibilities, considers the likelihood of 
each possibility, and then makes a prediction (an educated guess). Only after identify-
ing each product experimentally is the chemist sure what reaction has taken place. 
However, an educated guess is very useful because it provides a place to start. It tells 
us what kinds of products we are most likely to find. We already know some things that 
will help us predict the products of the above reaction.
1.
When ions form a solid compound, the compound must have a zero net charge. 
Thus the products of this reaction must contain both anions and cations. For 
example, K1 and Ba21 could not combine to form the solid, nor could CrO422
and NO32.
2. Most ionic materials contain only two types of ions: one type of cation and one 
type of anion (for example, NaCl, KOH, Na2SO4, K2CrO4, Co(NO3)2, NH4Cl, 
Na2CO3).
 
The possible combinations of a given cation and a given anion from the list of ions 
K1, CrO422, Ba21, and NO32 are
K2CrO4¬†¬†¬†¬†KNO3¬†¬†¬†¬†BaCrO4¬†¬†¬†¬†Ba1NO32 2
Which of these possibilities is most likely to represent the yellow solid? We know it‚Äôs not 
K2CrO4 or Ba(NO3)2. They are the reactants. They were present (dissolved) in the sepa-
rate solutions that were mixed. The only real possibilities for the solid that formed are
KNO3¬†¬†and¬†¬†BaCrO4
To decide which of these most likely represents the yellow solid, we need more facts. 
An experienced chemist knows that the K1 ion and the NO32 ion are both colorless. 
Thus, if the solid is KNO3, it should be white, not yellow. On the other hand, the 
CrO422 ion is yellow (note in Fig. 4.14 that K2CrO4(aq) is yellow). Thus the yellow 
solid is almost certainly BaCrO4. Further tests show that this is the case.

So far we have determined that one product of the reaction between K2CrO4(aq) and 
Ba(NO3)2(aq) is BaCrO4(s), but what happened to the K1 and NO32 ions? The answer 
is that these ions are left dissolved in the solution; KNO3 does not form a solid when the 
K1 and NO32 ions are present in this much water. In other words, if we took solid 
KNO3 and put it in the same quantity of water as is present in the mixed solution, it 
would dissolve. Thus, when we mix K2CrO4(aq) and Ba(NO3)2(aq), BaCrO4(s) forms, 
but KNO3 is left behind in solution (we write it as KNO3(aq)). Thus the overall equation 
for this precipitation reaction using the formulas of the reactants and products is
K2CrO41aq2 1 Ba1NO32 21aq2 h BaCrO41s2 1 2KNO31aq2
As long as water is present, the KNO3 remains dissolved as separated ions. (See 
Fig. 4.15 to help visualize what is happening in this reaction. Note the solid BaCrO4 
on the bottom of the container, while the K1 and NO32 ions remain dispersed in the 
solution.) If we  removed the solid BaCrO4 and then evaporated the water, white 
solid KNO3 would be  obtained; the K1 and NO32 ions would assemble themselves 
into solid KNO3 when the water is removed.
 
Now let‚Äôs consider another example. When an aqueous solution of silver nitrate  
is added to an aqueous solution of potassium chloride, a white precipitate forms  
(Fig. 4.16). We can represent what we know so far as
AgNO31aq2 1 KCl1aq2 h unknown white solid
Remembering that when ionic substances dissolve in water, the ions separate, we can 
write
Ag1, NO3
2 1 K1, Cl2 h Ag1, NO3
2, K1, Cl2 h white solid

Since we know the white solid must contain both positive and negative ions, the pos-
sible compounds that can be assembled from this collection of ions are
AgNO3¬†¬†¬†¬†KCl¬†¬†¬†¬†AgCl¬†¬†¬†¬†KNO3
Since AgNO3 and KCl are the substances dissolved in the two reactant solutions, we 
know that they do not represent the white solid product. Therefore, the only real pos-
sibilities are
AgCl¬†¬†and¬†¬†KNO3
From the first example considered, we know that KNO3 is quite soluble in water. Thus 
solid KNO3 will not form when the reactant solids are mixed. The product must be 
AgCl(s) (which can be proved by experiment to be true). The overall equation for the 
reaction now can be written
AgNO31aq2 1 KCl1aq2 h AgCl1s2 1 KNO31aq2
Figure 4.17 shows the result of mixing aqueous solutions of AgNO3 and KCl, includ-
ing a microscopic visualization of the reaction.
 
Notice that in these two examples we had to apply both concepts (solids must have 
a zero net charge) and facts (KNO3 is very soluble in water, CrO422 is yellow, and so 
on). Doing chemistry requires both understanding ideas and remembering key 
information. Predicting the identity of the solid product in a precipitation reaction 
requires knowledge of the solubilities of common ionic substances. As an aid in pre-
dicting the products of precipitation reactions, some simple solubility rules are given 
in Table 4.1. You should memorize these rules.
 
The phrase slightly soluble used in the solubility rules in Table 4.1 means that the 
tiny amount of solid that dissolves is not noticeable. The solid appears to be insoluble 
to the naked eye. Thus the terms insoluble and slightly soluble are often used 
interchangeably.

Note that the information in Table 4.1 allows us to predict that AgCl is the white 
solid formed when solutions of AgNO3 and KCl are mixed. Rules 1 and 2 indicate that 
KNO3 is soluble, and Rule 3 states that AgCl is insoluble.
 
When solutions containing ionic substances are mixed, it will be helpful in deter-
mining the products if you think in terms of ion interchange. For example, in the pre-
ceding discussion we considered the results of mixing AgNO3(aq) and KCl(aq). In 
determining the products, we took the cation from one reactant and combined it with 
the anion of the other reactant:

The solubility rules in Table 4.1 allow us to predict whether either product forms as a 
solid.
The key to dealing with the chemistry of an aqueous solution is first to focus on the 
actual components of the solution before any reaction occurs and then to figure out 
how these components will react with each other. Example 4.8 illustrates this process 
for three different reactions.
To begin, focus on the ions in solution 
before any reaction occurs.

required a machine the size of a large 
room now can be carried out on a 
hand-held calculator. This tendency 
toward miniaturization is also having 
a major impact on the science of 
chemical analysis. Using the tech-
niques of computer chip makers, 
researchers are now constructing 
minuscule laboratories on the surface 
of a tiny chip made of silicon, glass, or 
plastic (see photo). Instead of elec-
trons, 1026 to 1029 L of liquids moves 
between reaction chambers on the 
chip through tiny capillaries. The 
chips typically contain no moving 
parts. Instead of conventional pumps, 
the chip-based laboratories use 
voltage differences to move liquids 
that contain ions from one reaction 
chamber to another.
Microchip laboratories have many 
advantages. They require only tiny 
amounts of sample. This is especially 
advantageous for expensive, difficult-
to-prepare materials or in cases such 
as criminal investigations, where only 
small amounts of evidence may exist. 
The chip laboratories also minimize 
contamination because they repre-
sent a ‚Äúclosed system‚Äù once the mate-
rial has been introduced to the chip. 
In addition, the chips can be made 
to be disposable to prevent cross-
contamination of different samples.
The chip laboratories present some 
difficulties not found in macroscopic 
laboratories. The main problem con-
cerns the large surface area of the 
capillaries and reaction chambers 
relative to the sample volume. Mol-
ecules or biological cells in the sample 
solution encounter so much ‚Äúwall‚Äù that 
they may undergo unwanted reactions 
with the wall materials. Glass seems to 
present the least of these problems, 
and the walls of silicon chip laborato-
ries can be protected by formation of 
relatively inert silicon dioxide. Because 
plastic is inexpensive, it seems a good 
choice for disposable chips, but plastic 
also is the most reactive with the sam-
ples and the least durable of the avail-
able materials.
PerkinElmer, Inc. is working toward 
creating a miniature chemistry labora-
tory about the size of a toaster that can 
be used with ‚Äúplug-in‚Äù chip-based 
laboratories. Various chips would be 
furnished with the unit that would be 
appropriate for different types of analy-
ses. The entire unit would be con-
nected to a computer to collect and 
analyze the data. There is even the 
possibility that these ‚Äúlaboratories‚Äù 
could be used in the home to perform 
analyses such as blood sugar and blood 
cholesterol and to check for the pres-
ence of bacteria such as E. coli and 
many others. This would revolutionize 
the healthcare industry.

Predicting Reaction Products
Using the solubility rules in Table 4.1, predict what will happen when the following 
pairs of solutions are mixed.
a. KNO3(aq) and BaCl2(aq)
b. Na2SO4(aq) and Pb(NO3)2(aq)
c. KOH(aq) and Fe(NO3)3(aq)
 
SOLUTION 
a. The formula KNO3(aq) represents an aqueous solution obtained by dissolving solid 
KNO3 in water to form a solution containing the hydrated ions K1(aq) and 
NO32(aq). Likewise, BaCl2(aq) represents a solution formed by dissolving solid 
BaCl2 in water to produce Ba21(aq) and Cl2(aq). When these two solutions are 
mixed, the resulting solution contains the ions K1, NO32, Ba21, and Cl2. All ions 
are hydrated, but the (aq) is omitted for simplicity. To look for possible solid 
products, combine the cation from one reactant with the anion from the other:
K1¬†¬† 1 ¬†¬†NO

2¬†¬† 1 ¬†¬†Ba21¬†¬† 1 ¬†¬†Cl2¬†¬† h

Possible  
solid 
products
Note from Table 4.1 that the rules predict that both KCl and Ba(NO3)2 are soluble in 
water. Thus no precipitate forms when KNO3(aq) and BaCl2(aq) are mixed. All the 
ions remain dissolved in solution. No chemical reaction occurs.
b. Using the same procedures as in part a, we find that the ions present in the com-
bined solution before any reaction occurs are Na1, SO422, Pb21, and NO32. The 
possible salts that could form precipitates are
Na1¬†¬† 1 ¬†¬†SO4
22¬†¬† 1 ¬†¬†Pb21¬†¬† 1 ¬†¬†NO
 
3
2¬†¬† h
The compound NaNO3 is soluble, but PbSO4 is insoluble (see Rule 4 in 
Table 4.1). When these solutions are mixed, PbSO4 will precipitate from the 
solution. The balanced equation is
Na2SO41aq2 1 Pb1NO32 21aq2 h PbSO41s2 1 2NaNO31aq2
c. The combined solution (before any reaction occurs) contains the ions K1, OH2, 
Fe31, and NO32. The salts that might precipitate are KNO3 and Fe(OH)3. The 
solubility rules in Table 4.1 indicate that both K1 and NO32 salts are soluble. 
However, Fe(OH)3 is only slightly soluble (Rule 5) and hence will precipitate. 
The balanced equation is
3KOH1aq2 1 Fe1NO32 31aq2 h Fe1OH2 31s2 1 3KNO31aq2
See Exercises 4.51 and 4.52
4.6 Describing Reactions in Solution
In this section we will consider the types of equations used to represent reactions in 
solution. For example, when we mix aqueous potassium chromate with aqueous bar-
ium nitrate, a reaction occurs to form a precipitate (BaCrO4) and dissolved potassium 
nitrate. So far we have written the overall or formula equation for this reaction:
K2CrO41aq2 1 Ba1NO32 21aq2 h BaCrO41s2 1 2KNO31aq2

Although the formula equation shows the reactants and products of the reaction, it 
does not give a correct picture of what actually occurs in solution. As we have seen, 
aqueous solutions of potassium chromate, barium nitrate, and potassium nitrate con-
tain individual ions, not collections of ions, as implied by the formula equation. Thus 
the complete ionic equation
2K11aq2 1 CrO4

21aq2 h  
 
BaCrO41s2 1 2K11aq2 1 2NO3
21aq2
better represents the actual forms of the reactants and products in solution. In a com-
plete ionic equation, all substances that are strong electrolytes are represented as ions.
 
The complete ionic equation reveals that only some of the ions participate in the 
reaction. The K1 and NO32 ions are present in solution both before and after the reac-
tion. The ions that do not participate directly in the reaction are called spectator ions. 
The ions that participate in this reaction are the Ba21 and CrO422 ions, which combine 
to form solid BaCrO4:
Ba211aq2 1 CrO4
221aq2 h BaCrO41s2
This equation, called the net ionic equation, includes only those solution components 
directly involved in the reaction. Chemists usually write the net ionic equation for a 
reaction in solution because it gives the actual forms of the reactants and products and 
includes only the species that undergo a change.
Three Types of Equations Are Used to Describe  
Reactions in Solution
 ¬ª The formula equation gives the overall reaction stoichiometry but not necessarily the 
actual forms of the reactants and products in solution.
 ¬ª The complete ionic equation represents as ions all reactants and products that are 
strong electrolytes.
 ¬ª The net ionic equation includes only those solution components undergoing a change. 
Spectator ions are not included.
Writing Equations for Reactions
For each of the following reactions, write the formula equation, the complete ionic 
equation, and the net ionic equation.
a. Aqueous potassium chloride is added to aqueous silver nitrate to form a silver 
chloride precipitate plus aqueous potassium nitrate.
b. Aqueous potassium hydroxide is mixed with aqueous iron(III) nitrate to form a 
precipitate of iron(III) hydroxide and aqueous potassium nitrate.

4.7 Stoichiometry of Precipitation 
Reactions
In Chapter 3 we covered the principles of chemical stoichiometry: the procedures for 
calculating quantities of reactants and products involved in a chemical reaction. Recall 
that in performing these calculations we first convert all quantities to moles and then use 
the coefficients of the balanced equation to assemble the appropriate mole ratios. In 
cases where reactants are mixed, we must determine which reactant is limiting, since 
the reactant that is consumed first will limit the amounts of products formed. These 
same principles apply to reactions that take place in solutions. However, two points 
about solution reactions need special emphasis. The first is that it is sometimes difficult 
to tell immediately what reaction will occur when two solutions are mixed. Usually we 
must do some thinking about the various possibilities and then decide what probably 
will happen. The first step in this process always should be to write down the species 
that are actually present in the solution, as we did in Section 4.5. The second special 
point about solution reactions is that to obtain the moles of reactants we must use the 
volume of the solution and its molarity. This procedure was covered in Section 4.3.
We will introduce stoichiometric calculations for reactions in solution in Exam-
ple 4.10.

NaCl are required.

Notice from Example 4.10 that the procedures for doing stoichiometric calculations 
for solution reactions are very similar to those for other types of reactions. It is useful 
to think in terms of the following steps for reactions in solution.

4.8 Acid‚ÄìBase Reactions
Earlier in this chapter we considered Arrhenius‚Äôs concept of acids and bases: An acid 
is a substance that produces H1 ions when dissolved in water, and a base is a sub-
stance that produces OH2 ions. Although these ideas are fundamentally correct, it is 
convenient to have a more general definition of a base, which includes substances that 
do not contain OH2 ions. Such a definition was provided by Johannes N. Br√∏nsted 
(1879‚Äì1947) and Thomas M. Lowry (1874‚Äì1936), who defined acids and bases as 
follows:
An acid is a proton donor.
A base is a proton acceptor.
 
How do we know when to expect an acid‚Äìbase reaction? One of the most difficult 
tasks for someone inexperienced in chemistry is to predict what reaction might occur 
when two solutions are mixed. With precipitation reactions, we found that the best way

to deal with this problem is to focus on the species actually present in the mixed solu-
tion. This idea also applies to acid‚Äìbase reactions. For example, when an aqueous 
solution of hydrogen chloride (HCl) is mixed with an aqueous solution of sodium 
hydroxide (NaOH), the combined solution contains the ions H1, Cl2, Na1, and OH2. 
The separated ions are present because HCl is a strong acid and NaOH is a strong base. 
How can we predict what reaction occurs, if any? First, will NaCl precipitate? From 
Table 4.1 we can see that NaCl is soluble in water and thus will not precipitate. There-
fore, the Na1 and Cl2 ions are spectator ions. On the other hand, because water is a 
nonelectrolyte, large quantities of H1 and OH2 ions cannot coexist in solution. They 
react to form H2O molecules:
H11aq2 1 OH21aq2 h H2O1l2
This is the net ionic equation for the reaction that occurs when aqueous solutions of 
HCl and NaOH are mixed.
 
Next, consider mixing an aqueous solution of acetic acid (HC2H3O2) with an 
aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH). In our earlier discussion of con-
ductivity we said that an aqueous solution of acetic acid is a weak electrolyte. This 
tells us that acetic acid does not dissociate into ions to any great extent. In fact, in 
0.1 M HC2H3O2 approximately 99% of the HC2H3O2 molecules remain undissoci-
ated. However, when solid KOH is dissolved in water, it dissociates completely to 
produce K1 and OH2 ions. Therefore, in the solution formed by mixing aqueous 
solutions of HC2H3O2 and KOH, before any reaction occurs, the principal species 
are HC2H3O2, K1, and OH2. What reaction will occur? A possible precipitation 
reaction could occur between K1 and OH2. However, we know that KOH is solu-
ble, so precipitation does not occur. Another possibility is a reaction involving the 
hydroxide ion (a proton acceptor) and some proton donor. Is there a source of pro-
tons in the solution? The answer is yes‚Äîthe HC2H3O2 molecules. The OH2 ion has 
such a strong affinity for protons that it can strip them from the HC2H3O2 mole-
cules. The net ionic equation for this reaction is
OH21aq2 1 HC2H3O21aq2 h H2O1l2 1 C2H3O
 
2
21aq2
 
This reaction illustrates a very important general principle: The hydroxide ion is 
such a strong base that for purposes of stoichiometric calculations it can be 
assumed to react completely with any weak acid that we will encounter. Of course, 
OH2 ions also react completely with the H1 ions in solutions of strong acids.
 
We will now deal with the stoichiometry of acid‚Äìbase reactions in aqueous solu-
tions. The procedure is fundamentally the same as that used previously for precipita-
tion reactions.
PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY
Performing Calculations for Acid‚ÄìBase Reactions
1. List the species present in the combined solution before any reaction occurs, and 
decide what reaction will occur.
2. Write the balanced net ionic equation for this reaction.
3. Calculate the moles of reactants. For reactions in solution, use the volumes of the 
original solutions and their molarities.
4. Determine the limiting reactant where appropriate.
5. Calculate the moles of the required reactant or product.
6. Convert to grams or volume (of solution), as required.
 
An acid‚Äìbase reaction is often called a neutralization reaction. When just enough 
base is added to react exactly with the acid in a solution, we say the acid has been 
neutralized.

Acid‚ÄìBase Titrations
Volumetric analysis is a technique for determining the amount of a certain substance 
by doing a titration. A titration involves delivery (from a buret) of a measured volume 
of a solution of known concentration (the titrant) into a solution containing the sub-
stance being analyzed (the analyte). The titrant contains a substance that reacts in a 
known manner with the analyte. The point in the titration where enough titrant has 
been added to react exactly with the analyte is called the equivalence point or the 
stoichiometric point. This point is often marked by an indicator, a substance added 
at the beginning of the titration that changes color at (or very near) the equivalence 
point. The point where the indicator actually changes color is called the endpoint of 
the titration. The goal is to choose an indicator such that the endpoint (where the indi-
cator changes color) occurs exactly at the equivalence point (where just enough titrant 
has been added to react with all the analyte).
Requirements for a Successful Titration
 ¬ª The exact reaction between titrant and analyte must be known (and rapid).
 ¬ª The stoichiometric (equivalence) point must be marked accurately.
 ¬ª The volume of titrant required to reach the stoichiometric point must be known accurately.
 
When the analyte is a base or an acid, the required titrant is a strong acid or strong 
base, respectively. This procedure is called an acid‚Äìbase titration. An indicator very 
commonly used for acid‚Äìbase titrations is phenolphthalein, which is colorless in an 
acidic solution and pink in a basic solution. Thus, when an acid is titrated with a base, 
the phenolphthalein remains colorless until after the acid is consumed and the first 
drop of excess base is added. In this case, the endpoint (the solution changes from 
colorless to pink) occurs approximately one drop of base beyond the stoichiometric 
point. This type of titration is illustrated in Fig. 4.18.
 
We will deal with the acid‚Äìbase titrations only briefly here but will return to the 
topic of titrations and indicators in more detail in Chapter 15. The titration of an acid 
with a standard solution containing hydroxide ions is described in Example 4.15. In 
Example 4.14 we show how to determine accurately the concentration of a sodium 
hydroxide solution. This procedure is called standardizing the solution.
Neutralization Titration
A student carries out an experiment to standardize (determine the exact concentration 
of) a sodium hydroxide solution. To do this, the student weighs out a 1.3009-g sample 
of potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHC8H4O4, often abbreviated KHP). KHP (molar 
mass 204.22 g/mol) has one acidic hydrogen. The student dissolves the KHP in dis-
tilled water, adds phenolphthalein as an indicator, and titrates the resulting solution 
with the sodium hydroxide solution to the phenolphthalein endpoint. The difference 
between the final and initial buret readings indicates that 41.20 mL of the sodium 
hydroxide solution is required to react exactly with the 1.3009 g KHP. Calculate the 
concentration of the sodium  hydroxide solution.

occurs after the equivalence point? How would this affect your calculated 
concentration of NaOH?
Neutralization Analysis
An environmental chemist analyzed the effluent (the released waste material) from an 
industrial process known to produce the compounds carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and 
benzoic acid (HC7H5O2), a weak acid that has one acidic hydrogen atom per molecule. 
A sample of this effluent weighing 0.3518 g was shaken with water, and the resulting 
aqueous solution required 10.59 mL of 0.1546 M NaOH for neutralization. Calculate 
the mass percent of HC7H5O2 in the original sample.

In doing problems involving titrations, you must first decide what reaction is  occurring. 
Sometimes this seems difficult because the titration solution contains several components. 
The key to success in doing solution reactions is to first write down all the compo-
nents in the solution and focus on the chemistry of each one. We have been emphasiz-
ing this approach in dealing with the reactions between ions in solution. Make it a habit to 
write down the components of solutions before trying to decide what  reaction(s) might 
take place as you attempt the end-of-chapter problems  involving  titrations.
 
4.9 Oxidation‚ÄìReduction Reactions
We have seen that many important substances are ionic. Sodium chloride, for example, 
can be formed by the reaction of elemental sodium and chlorine:
2Na1s2 1 Cl21g2 h 2NaCl1s2
In this reaction, solid sodium, which contains neutral sodium atoms, reacts with chlo-
rine gas, which contains diatomic Cl2 molecules, to form the ionic solid NaCl, which 
contains Na1 and Cl2 ions. This process is represented in Fig. 4.19. Reactions like this 
one, in which one or more electrons are transferred, are called oxidation‚Äìreduction 
reactions or redox reactions.
 
Many important chemical reactions involve oxidation and reduction. Photosynthe-
sis, which stores energy from the sun in plants by converting carbon dioxide and water 
to sugar, is a very important oxidation‚Äìreduction reaction. In fact, most reactions used 
for energy production are redox reactions. In humans, the oxidation of sugars, fats, and 
proteins provides the energy necessary for life. Combustion reactions, which provide 
most of the energy to power our civilization, also involve oxidation and reduction. An 
example is the reaction of methane with oxygen:
CH41g2 1 2O21g2 h CO21g2 1 2H2O1g2 1 energy
Even though none of the reactants or products in this reaction is ionic, the reaction is 
still assumed to involve a transfer of electrons from carbon to oxygen. To explain this, 
we must introduce the concept of oxidation states.
Oxidation States
The concept of oxidation states (also called oxidation numbers) provides a way to keep 
track of electrons in oxidation‚Äìreduction reactions, particularly redox reactions  involving 
covalent substances. Recall that electrons are shared by atoms in covalent bonds. The 
oxidation states of atoms in covalent compounds are obtained by arbitrarily assigning the 
The first step in the analysis of a complex 
solution is to write down the components 
and focus on the chemistry of each one. 
When a strong electrolyte is present, write 
it as separated ions.

electrons (which are actually shared) to particular atoms. We do this as follows: For a 
covalent bond between two identical atoms, the electrons are split equally between the 
two. In cases where two different atoms are involved (and the electrons are thus shared 
unequally), the shared electrons are assigned completely to the atom that has the stronger 
attraction for electrons. For example, recall from the discussion of the water molecule in 
Section 4.1 that oxygen has a greater attraction for electrons than does hydrogen. There-
fore, in assigning the oxidation state of oxygen and hydrogen in H2O, we assume that the 
oxygen atom actually possesses all the electrons. Recall that a hydrogen atom has one 
electron. Thus, in water, oxygen has formally ‚Äútaken‚Äù the electrons from two hydrogen 
atoms. This gives the oxygen an excess of two electrons (its oxidation state is 22) and 
leaves each hydrogen with no electrons (the oxidation state of each hydrogen is thus 11).
 
We define the oxidation states (or oxidation numbers) of the atoms in a covalent 
compound as the imaginary charges the atoms would have if the shared electrons were 
divided equally between identical atoms bonded to each other or, for different atoms, 
were all assigned to the atom in each bond that has the greater attraction for electrons. 
Of course, for ionic compounds containing monatomic ions, the oxidation states of the 
ions are equal to the ion charges.
 
These considerations lead to a series of rules for assigning oxidation states that are 
summarized in Table 4.2. Application of these simple rules allows the assignment of 
oxidation states in most compounds. To apply these rules, recognize that the sum of the 
oxidation states must be zero for an electrically neutral compound. For an ion, the sum 
of the oxidation states must equal the charge of the ion. The principles are illustrated 
by  Example 4.16.
 
It is worthwhile to note at this point that the convention is to write actual charges on 
ions as n1 or n2, the number being written before the plus or minus sign. On the other 
hand, oxidation states (not actual charges) are written 1n or 2n, the number being 
written after the plus or minus sign.

CRITICAL THINKING What if the oxidation state for oxygen was 
defined as 21 instead of 22? What effect, if any, would it have on the oxidation 
state of hydrogen?
Assigning Oxidation States
Assign oxidation states to all atoms in the following.
a. CO2    b.  SF6    c.  NO32
 
SOLUTION 
a. Since we have a specific rule for the oxidation state of oxygen, we will assign its 
value first. The oxidation state of oxygen is 22. The oxidation state of the carbon 
atom can be determined by recognizing that since CO2 has no charge, the sum of 
the oxidation states for oxygen and carbon must be zero. Since each oxygen is 
22 and there are two oxygen atoms, the carbon atom must be assigned an oxida-
tion state of 14:
CO2
p    r 
             14    22 for each oxygen
Reality Check We can check the assigned oxidation states by noting that when the 
number of atoms is taken into account, the sum is zero as required:
111 42 1 21222 5 0
 
p 
h
 
No. of C 
No. of O

b. Since we have no rule for sulfur, we first assign the oxidation state of each fluo-
rine as 21. The sulfur must then be assigned an oxidation state of 16 to balance 
the total of 26 from the fluorine atoms:
SF6
p    r 
             16    21 for each fluorine
Reality Check 16 1 6(21) 5 0
c. Oxygen has an oxidation state of 22. Because the sum of the oxidation states of 
the three oxygens is 26 and the net charge on the NO32 ion is 12, the nitrogen 
must have an oxidation state of 15:
NO

Note that in this case the sum must be 21 (the overall charge on the ion).

We need to make one more point about oxidation states, and this can be illustrated by 
the compound Fe3O4, which is the main component in magnetite, an iron ore that accounts 
for the reddish color of many types of rocks and soils. To determine the oxidation states 
in Fe3O4, we first assign each oxygen atom its usual oxidation state of 22. The three iron 
atoms must yield a total of 18 to balance the total of 28 from the four oxygens. This 
means that each iron atom has an oxidation state of 18
3. A noninteger value for the oxida-
tion state may seem strange because charge is expressed in whole numbers. However, 
although they are rare, noninteger oxidation states do occur because of the rather arbitrary 
way that electrons are divided up by the rules in Table 4.2. For Fe3O4, for example, the 
rules assume that all the iron atoms are equal, when in fact this compound can best be 
viewed as containing four O22 ions, two Fe31 ions, and one Fe21 ion per formula unit. 
(Note that the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù charge on iron works out to be 8
31, which is equal to the oxidation 
state we determined above.) Noninteger oxidation states should not intimidate you. They 
are used in the same way as integer oxidation states‚Äîfor keeping track of electrons.
The Characteristics of Oxidation‚ÄìReduction 
Reactions
Oxidation‚Äìreduction reactions are characterized by a transfer of electrons. In some 
cases, the transfer occurs in a literal sense to form ions, such as in the reaction
2Na1s2 1 Cl21g2 h 2NaCl1s2
However, sometimes the transfer is less obvious. For example, consider the combus-
tion of methane (the oxidation state for each atom is given):
CH41g2 1 2O21g2 h CO21g2 1 2H2O1g2

 (each O) (each H)
Note that the oxidation state for oxygen in O2 is 0 because it is in elemental form. In 
this reaction there are no ionic compounds, but we can still describe the process in 
terms of a transfer of electrons. Note that carbon undergoes a change in oxidation state 
from 24 in CH4 to 14 in CO2. Such a change can be accounted for by a loss of eight 
electrons (the symbol e2 stands for an electron):
CH4 h CO2 1 8e2
 
h 
h 
 
24 
14
On the other hand, each oxygen changes from an oxidation state of 0 in O2 to 22 in 
H2O and CO2, signifying a gain of two electrons per atom. Since four oxygen atoms 
are involved, this is a gain of eight electrons:
2O2 1 8e2 h CO2 1 2H2O

       4(22) 5 28
No change occurs in the oxidation state of hydrogen, and it is not formally involved in 
the electron-transfer process.
 
With this background, we can now define some important terms. Oxidation is an 
increase in oxidation state (a loss of electrons). Reduction is a decrease in oxidation 
state (a gain of electrons). Thus in the reaction

sodium is oxidized and chlorine is reduced. In addition, Cl2 is called the oxidizing 
agent (electron acceptor), and Na is called the reducing agent (electron donor).

we can say the following:
Methane is oxidized because there has been an increase in carbon‚Äôs oxidation state 
(the carbon atom has formally lost electrons).
Oxygen is reduced because there has been a decrease in its oxidation state (oxygen 
has formally gained electrons).
CH4 is the reducing agent.
O2 is the oxidizing agent.
Note that when the oxidizing or reducing agent is named, the whole compound is 
specified, not just the element that undergoes the change in oxidation state.
Oxidation‚ÄìReduction Reactions
Metallurgy, the process of producing a metal from its ore, always involves oxidation‚Äì 
 reduction reactions. In the metallurgy of galena (PbS), the principal lead-containing ore, 
the first step is the conversion of lead sulfide to its oxide (a process called roasting):
2PbS1s2 1 3O21g2 h 2PbO1s2 1 2SO21g2
The oxide is then treated with carbon monoxide to produce the free metal:
PbO1s2 1 CO1g2 h Pb1s2 1 CO21g2
For each reaction, identify the atoms that are oxidized and reduced, and specify the 
oxidizing and reducing agents.
 
SOLUTION 
For the first reaction, we can assign the following oxidation states:
2PbS1s2 1 3O21g2 h 2PbO1s2 1 2SO21g2

The oxidation state for the sulfur atom increases from 22 to 14. Thus sulfur is oxi-
dized. The oxidation state for each oxygen atom decreases from 0 to 22. Oxygen is 
reduced. The oxidizing agent (that accepts the electrons) is O2, and the reducing agent 
(that donates electrons) is PbS.

CRITICAL THINKING Dalton believed that atoms were 
indivisible. Thomson and Rutherford helped to show that this was not true. What 
if atoms were indivisible? How would this affect the types of reactions you have 
learned about in this chapter?
4.10 Balancing Oxidation‚ÄìReduction 
Equations
Oxidation‚Äìreduction reactions in aqueous solutions are often complicated, which 
means that it can be difficult to balance their equations by simple inspection. In this 
section we will discuss a special technique for balancing the equations of redox reac-
tions that occur in aqueous solutions. It is called the half-reaction method.
The Half-Reaction Method for Balancing 
Oxidation‚ÄìReduction Reactions  
in Aqueous Solutions
For oxidation‚Äìreduction reactions that occur in aqueous solution, it is useful to sepa-
rate the reaction into two half-reactions: one involving oxidation and the other 
in volving reduction. For example, consider the unbalanced equation for the oxidation‚Äì 
reduction reaction between cerium(IV) ion and tin(II) ion:
Ce411aq2 1 Sn211aq2 h Ce311aq2 1 Sn411aq2
This reaction can be separated into a half-reaction involving the substance being reduced,
Ce411aq2 h Ce311aq2
and one involving the substance being oxidized,
Sn211aq2 h Sn411aq2
The general procedure is to balance the equations for the half-reactions separately and 
then to add them to obtain the overall balanced equation. The half-reaction method for 
balancing oxidation‚Äìreduction equations differs slightly depending on whether the 
reaction takes place in acidic or basic solution.
PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY
The Half-Reaction Method for Balancing Equations for 
Oxidation‚ÄìReduction Reactions Occurring in Acidic Solution
1. Write separate equations for the oxidation and reduction half-reactions.
2. For each half-reaction,
a. balance all the elements except hydrogen and oxygen.
b. balance oxygen using H2O.
c. balance hydrogen using H1.
d. balance the charge using electrons.

3. If necessary, multiply one or both balanced half-reactions by an integer to equalize 
the number of electrons transferred in the two half-reactions.

MnO

21aq2 1 Fe211aq2 h
Acid
Fe311aq2 1 Mn211aq2
This reaction can be used to analyze iron ore for its iron content.
1. Identify and write equations for the half-reactions. The oxidation states for the 
half-reaction involving the permanganate ion show that manganese is reduced:
MnO

This is the reduction half-reaction. The other half-reaction involves the oxidation 
of iron(II) to iron(III) ion and is the oxidation half-reaction:
Fe21 h Fe31

2. Balance each half-reaction. For the reduction reaction, we have

d. All the elements have been balanced, but we need to balance the charge using 
electrons. At this point we have the following overall charges for reactants 
and products in the reduction half-reaction:

We can equalize the charges by adding five electrons to the left side:

Both the elements and the charges are now balanced, so this represents the 
balanced reduction half-reaction. The fact that five electrons appear on the 
reactant side of the equation makes sense, since five electrons are required to 
reduce MnO42 (Mn has an oxidation state of 17) to Mn21 (Mn has an oxida-
tion state of 12).
 
For the oxidation reaction
Fe211aq2 h Fe311aq2
the elements are balanced, and we must simply balance the charge:

3. Equalize the electron transfer in the two half-reactions. Since the reduction half-
reaction involves a transfer of five electrons and the oxidation half-reaction 
involves a transfer of only one electron, the oxidation half-reaction must be mul-
tiplied by 5:
5Fe211aq2 h 5Fe311aq2 1 5e2
4. Add the half-reactions. The half-reactions are added to give

5Fe311aq2 1 Mn211aq2 1 4H2O1 l 2 1 5e2
Note that the electrons cancel (as they must) to give the final balanced equation:
5Fe211aq2 1 MnO

21aq2 1 8H11aq2 h 5Fe311aq2 1 Mn211aq2 1 4H2O1 l 2
5. Check that elements and charges are balanced.

Charges balance: 
51212 1 1122 1 81112 5 171 h

The equation is balanced.
Balancing Oxidation‚ÄìReduction Reactions (Acidic)
Potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) is a bright orange compound that can be reduced to 
a blue-violet solution of Cr31 ions. Under certain conditions, K2Cr2O7 reacts with etha-
nol (C2H5OH) as follows:
H11aq2 1 Cr2O

221aq2 1 C2H5OH1 l 2 h Cr311aq2 1 CO21 g2 1 H2O1 l 2
Balance this equation using the half-reaction method.
The number of electrons gained in the 
reduction half-reaction must equal the 
number of electrons lost in the oxidation 
half-reaction.

Balancing hydrogen using H1, we have
C2H5OH1 l 2 1 3H2O1 l 2 h 2CO21 g2 1 12H11aq2

C2H5OH1 l 2 1 3H2O1 l 2 h 2CO21 g2 1 12H11aq2 1 12e2
3. In the reduction half-reaction, there are 6 electrons on the left-hand side, and 
there are 12 electrons on the right-hand side of the oxidation half-reaction. Thus

CRITICAL THINKING When balancing redox reactions occurring 
in basic solutions, the text instructs you to first use the half-reaction method as 
specified for acidic solutions. What if you started by adding OH2 first instead 
of H1? What potential problem could there be with this approach?
Balancing Oxidation‚ÄìReduction Reactions (Basic)
Silver is sometimes found in nature as large nuggets; more often it is found mixed with 
other metals and their ores. An aqueous solution containing cyanide ion is often used 
to extract the silver using the following reaction that occurs in basic solution:

4.11 Simple Oxidation‚ÄìReduction 
Titrations
In Section 4.8 we discussed volumetric analysis, specifically acid‚Äìbase titrations. 
Oxidation‚Äìreduction reactions (discussed in Sections 4.9 and 4.10) can also be used 
for volumetric analytical procedures. For example, a reducing substance can be titrated 
with a solution of a strong oxidizing agent or vice versa. Three of the most frequently 
used oxidizing agents are aqueous solutions of potassium permanganate (KMnO4), 
potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7), and cerium hydrogen sulfate [Ce(HSO4)4].
 
The strong oxidizing agent, the permanganate ion (MnO42), can undergo several 
different reactions. The reaction that occurs in acidic solution is the one most com-
monly used:
MnO42(aq) 1 8H1(aq) 1 5e2 n Mn21(aq) 1 4H2O(l)
Permanganate has the advantage of being its own indicator‚Äîthe MnO42 ion is 
intensely purple, and the Mn21 ion is almost colorless. As long as some reducing agent 
remains in the solution being titrated, the solution remains colorless (assuming all 
other species present are colorless), because the purple MnO42 ion being added is 
converted to the essentially colorless Mn21 ion. However, when all the reducing agent 
has been consumed, the next drop of permanganate titrant will turn the solution being 
titrated light purple (pink). Thus, the endpoint (where the color change indicates the 
titration should stop) occurs approximately one drop beyond the stoichiometric point 
(the actual point at which all the reducing agent has been consumed).
 
The example problem below describes a typical volumetric analysis using 
permanganate.
Iron ores often involve a mixture of oxides and contain both Fe21 and Fe31 ions. Such an 
ore can be analyzed for its iron content by dissolving it in acidic solution, reducing all the 
iron to Fe21 ions, and then titrating with a standard solution of potassium permanganate. 
In the resulting solution, MnO42 is reduced to Mn21, and Fe21 is oxidized to Fe31. A 
sample of iron ore weighing 0.3500 g was dissolved in acidic solution, and all the iron 
was reduced to Fe21. Then the solution was titrated with a 1.621 3 1022 M KMnO4
solution. The titration required 41.56 mL of the permanganate solution to reach the light 
purple (pink) endpoint. Determine the mass percent of iron in the iron ore.
SOLUTION 
Where are we going?
We are asked to determine the mass percent of iron in an iron ore.
How do we get there?
Mass percent of iron 5
mass of iron
mass of iron ore 3 100%
We know that the mass of the mixture is 0.3500 g, so we change the question to ‚ÄúWhat 
is the mass of the iron?‚Äù

All of the iron metal is converted to Fe21, which is reacted with a known volume 
and molarity of MnO42. From volume and molarity we can get moles, and by using the 
mole ratio in a balanced equation, we can determine the moles of iron. We convert 
from moles to mass using the atomic mass of iron.
 
From the problem it is obvious that this is a redox reaction, so we will need to bal-
ance the equation accordingly.
 
First, we write the unbalanced equation for the reaction:
H1(aq) 1 MnO42(aq) 1 Fe21(aq) 88n Fe31(aq) 1 Mn21(aq) 1 H2O(l)
Using the half-reaction method, we balance the equation:
8H1(aq) 1 MnO42(aq) 1 5Fe21(aq) 88n 5Fe31(aq) 1 Mn21(aq) 1 4H2O(l)
The number of moles of MnO42 ion required in the titration is found from the volume 
and concentration of permanganate solution used:
41.56 mL 3
1 L
1000 mL 3 1.621 3 1022 mol MnO4
2
L
 5 6.737 3 1024 mol MnO42
The balanced equation shows that five times as much Fe21 as MnO42 is required:
6.737 3 1024 mol MnO4
2 3
5 mol Fe21
1 mol MnO4
2 5 3.368 3 1023 mol Fe21
Thus the 0.3500-g sample of iron ore contained 3.368 3 1023 mole of iron. The mass 
of iron present is
3.368 3 1023 mol Fe 3 55.85 g Fe
1 mol Fe 5 0.1881 g Fe
‚ñ† The mass percent of iron in the iron ore is
0.1881 g
0.3500 g 3 100% 5 53.74%

Active Learning Questions
These questions are designed to be used by groups of students in 
class.
 1. Assume you have a highly magnified view of a solution of 
HCl that allows you to ‚Äúsee‚Äù the HCl. Draw this magnified 
view. If you dropped in a piece of magnesium, the magnesium 
would disappear and hydrogen gas would be released. Repre-
sent this change using symbols for the elements, and write out 
the balanced equation.

atter exists in three distinct physical states: gas, liquid, and solid. Although 
relatively few substances exist in the gaseous state under typical condi-
tions, gases are very important. For example, we live immersed in a gaseous solution. 
The earth‚Äôs atmosphere is a mixture of gases that consists mainly of elemental nitrogen 
(N2) and oxygen (O2). The atmosphere both supports life and acts as a waste receptacle 
for the exhaust gases that accompany many industrial processes. The chemical reac-
tions of these waste gases in the atmosphere lead to various types of pollution, includ-
ing smog and acid rain. The gases in the atmosphere also shield us from harmful 
radiation from the sun and keep the earth warm by reflecting heat radiation back 
toward the earth. In fact, there is now great concern that an increase in atmospheric 
carbon dioxide, a product of the combustion of fossil fuels, is causing a dangerous 
warming of the earth.
In this chapter we will look carefully at the properties of gases. First we will see 
how measurements of gas properties lead to various types of laws‚Äîstatements that 
show how the properties are related to each other. Then we will construct a model to 
explain why gases behave as they do. This model will show how the behavior of the 
individual particles of a gas leads to the observed properties of the gas itself (a collec-
tion of many, many particles).
The study of gases provides an excellent example of the scientific method in action. 
It illustrates how observations lead to natural laws, which in turn can be accounted for 
by models.
5.1 Pressure
A gas uniformly fills any container, is easily compressed, and mixes completely with 
any other gas. One of the most obvious properties of a gas is that it exerts pressure on 
its surroundings. For example, when you blow up a balloon, the air inside pushes 
against the elastic sides of the balloon and keeps it firm.
As mentioned earlier, the gases most familiar to us form the earth‚Äôs atmosphere. 
The pressure exerted by this gaseous mixture that we call air can be dramatically dem-
onstrated by the experiment shown in Fig. 5.1. A small volume of water is placed in a 
metal can, and the water is boiled, which fills the can with steam. The can is then 
sealed and allowed to cool. Why does the can collapse as it cools? It is the atmospheric 
pressure that crumples the can. When the can is cooled after being sealed so that no air 
can flow in, the water vapor (steam) condenses to a very small volume of liquid water. 
5.1
As a gas, water occupies 1200 times as 
much space as it does as a liquid at 258C 
and atmospheric pressure.

FIGURE 5.1 The pressure exerted 
by the gases in the atmosphere can be 
demonstrated by boiling water in a 
large metal can (a) and then turning off 
the heat and sealing the can. As the can 
cools, the water vapor condenses, 
lowering the gas pressure inside the 
can. This causes the can to crumple (b).

As a gas, the water filled the can, but when it is condensed to a liquid, the liquid does 
not come close to filling the can. The H2O molecules formerly present as a gas are now 
collected in a very small volume of liquid, and there are very few molecules of gas left 
to exert pressure outward and counteract the air pressure. As a result, the pressure 
exerted by the gas molecules in the atmosphere smashes the can.
 
A device to measure atmospheric pressure, the barometer, was invented in 1643 by 
an Italian scientist named Evangelista Torricelli (1608‚Äì1647), who had been a student 
of Galileo. Torricelli‚Äôs barometer is constructed by filling a glass tube with liquid mer-
cury and inverting it in a dish of mercury (Fig. 5.2). Notice that a large quantity of 
mercury stays in the tube. In fact, at sea level the height of this column of mercury 
averages 760 mm. Why does this mercury stay in the tube, seemingly in defiance of 
gravity? Figure 5.2 illustrates how the pressure exerted by the atmospheric gases on 
the surface of mercury in the dish keeps the mercury in the tube.
 
Atmospheric pressure results from the mass of the air being pulled toward the cen-
ter of the earth by gravity‚Äîin other words, it results from the weight of the air. Chang-
ing weather conditions cause the atmospheric pressure to vary, so the height of the 
column of Hg supported by the atmosphere at sea level varies; it is not always 760 mm. 
The meteorologist who says a ‚Äúlow‚Äù is approaching means that the atmospheric pres-
sure is going to decrease. This condition often occurs in conjunction with a storm.
 
Atmospheric pressure also varies with altitude. For example, when Torricelli‚Äôs 
experiment is done in Breckenridge, Colorado (elevation 9600 feet), the atmosphere 
supports a column of mercury only about 520 mm high because the air is ‚Äúthinner.‚Äù That 
is, there is less air pushing down on the earth‚Äôs surface at Breckenridge than at sea level.
Units of Pressure
Because instruments used for measuring pressure, such as the manometer (Fig. 5.3), 
often contain mercury, the most commonly used units for pressure are based on the 
height of the mercury column (in millimeters) that the gas pressure can support. The 
Soon after Torricelli died, a German 
physicist named Otto von Guericke 
invented an air pump. In a famous 
demonstration for the King of Prussia in 
1663, Guericke placed two hemispheres 
together, pumped the air out of the 
resulting sphere through a valve, and 
showed that teams of horses could not pull 
the hemispheres apart. Then, after secretly 
opening the air valve, Guericke easily 
separated the hemispheres by hand. The 
King of Prussia was so impressed that he 
awarded Guericke a lifetime pension!

unit mm Hg (millimeter of mercury) is often called the torr in honor of Torricelli. The 
terms torr and mm Hg are used interchangeably by chemists. A related unit for pres-
sure is the standard atmosphere (abbreviated atm):
1 standard atmosphere 5 1 atm 5 760 mm Hg 5 760 torr
However, since pressure is defined as force per unit area,
Pressure 5 force
area
the fundamental units of pressure involve units of force divided by units of area. In the 
SI system, the unit of force is the newton (N) and the unit of area is meters squared 
(m2). (For a review of the SI system, see Chapter 1.) Thus the unit of pressure in the SI 
system is newtons per meter squared (N/m2) and is called the pascal (Pa). In terms of 
pascals, the standard atmosphere is
1 standard atmosphere 5 101,325 Pa
Thus 1 atmosphere is about 105 pascals. Since the pascal is so small, and since it is  
not commonly used in the United States, we will use it sparingly in this book. How-
ever, converting from torrs or atmospheres to pascals is straightforward, as shown in 
Example 5.1.

5.2 The Gas Laws of Boyle, Charles, 
and Avogadro
In this section we will consider several mathematical laws that relate the properties of 
gases. These laws derive from experiments involving careful measurements of the rel-
evant gas properties. From these experimental results, the mathematical relationships 
among the properties can be discovered. These relationships are often represented pic-
torially by means of graphs (plots).
We will take a historical approach to these laws to give you some perspective on the 
scientific method in action.
Boyle‚Äôs Law
The first quantitative experiments on gases were performed by an Irish chemist, Robert 
Boyle (1627‚Äì1691). Using a J-shaped tube closed at one end (Fig. 5.4), which he 
reportedly set up in the multistory entryway of his house, Boyle studied the relation-
ship between the pressure of the trapped gas and its volume. Representative values 
from Boyle‚Äôs experiments are given in Table 5.1. These data show that the product of 
 1 atm 5 760 mm Hg
 5 760 torr

the pressure and volume for the trapped air sample is constant within the accuracies of 
Boyle‚Äôs measurements (note the third column in Table 5.1). This behavior can be rep-
resented by the equation
PV 5 k
which is called Boyle‚Äôs law, where k is a constant for a given sample of air at a specific 
temperature.
 
It is convenient to represent the data in Table 5.1 by using two different plots. The 
first type of plot, P versus V, forms a curve called a hyperbola [Fig. 5.5(a)]. Looking 
at this plot, note that as the pressure drops by about half (from 58.8 to 29.1), the vol-
ume doubles (from 24.0 to 48.0). In other words, there is an inverse relationship 
between pressure and volume. The second type of plot can be obtained by rearranging 
Boyle‚Äôs law to give
V 5 k
P 5 k1
P
which is the equation for a straight line of the type
y 5 mx 1 b
where m represents the slope and b is the intercept of the straight line. In this case, 
y¬†5¬†V, x 5 1yP, m 5 k, and b 5 0. Thus a plot of V versus 1yP using Boyle‚Äôs data gives 
a straight line with an intercept of zero [Fig. 5.5(b)].

temperature

In the three centuries since Boyle carried out his studies, the sophistication of mea-
suring techniques has increased tremendously. The results of highly accurate measure-
ments show that Boyle‚Äôs law holds precisely only at very low pressures. Measurements 
at higher pressures reveal that PV is not constant but varies as the pressure is varied. 
Results for several gases at pressures below 1 atm are shown in Fig. 5.6. Note the very 
small changes that occur in the product PV as the pressure is changed at these low 
pressures. Such changes become more significant at much higher pressures, where the 
complex nature of the dependence of PV on pressure becomes more obvious. We will 
discuss these deviations and the reasons for them in detail in Section 5.8. A gas that 
strictly obeys Boyle‚Äôs law is called an ideal gas. We will describe the characteristics of 
an ideal gas more completely in Section 5.3.
One common use of Boyle‚Äôs law is to predict the new volume of a gas when the 
pressure is changed (at constant temperature), or vice versa. Because deviations from 
Boyle‚Äôs law are so slight at pressures close to 1 atm, in our calculations we will assume 
that gases obey Boyle‚Äôs law (unless stated otherwise).
Boyle‚Äôs Law I
Sulfur dioxide (SO2), a gas that plays a central role in the formation of acid rain, is 
found in the exhaust of automobiles and power plants. Consider a 1.53-L sample of 
gaseous SO2 at a pressure of 5.6 3 103 Pa. If the pressure is changed to 1.5 3 104 Pa 
at a constant temperature, what will be the new volume of the gas?

at 0.25 atm to 22.26 L ? atm at 1.00 atm. Thus Boyle‚Äôs law is a good approximation at these relatively

The fact that the volume decreases in Example 5.2 makes sense because the pres-
sure was increased. To help eliminate errors, make it a habit to check whether an 
answer to a problem makes physical (common!) sense.
 
We mentioned before that Boyle‚Äôs law is only approximately true for real gases. To 
determine the significance of the deviations, studies of the effect of changing pressure 
on the volume of a gas are often done, as shown in Example 5.3.
Boyle‚Äôs Law II
In a study to see how closely gaseous ammonia obeys Boyle‚Äôs law, several volume 
measurements were made at various pressures, using 1.0 mole of NH3 gas at a tem-
perature of 08C. Using the results listed below, calculate the Boyle‚Äôs law constant for 
NH3 at the various pressures.

SOLUTION 
To determine how closely NH3 gas follows Boyle‚Äôs law under these conditions, we  
calculate the value of k (in L ? atm) for each set of values:

Although the deviations from true Boyle‚Äôs law behavior are quite small at these low 
pressures, note that the value of k changes regularly in one direction as the pressure is 
increased. Thus, to calculate the ‚Äúideal‚Äù value of k for NH3, we can plot PV versus P 
(Fig. 5.7), and extrapolate (extend the line beyond the experimental points) back to 
zero pressure, where, for reasons we will discuss later, a gas behaves most ideally. The 
value of k obtained by this extrapolation is 22.41 L ? atm. Notice that this is the same 
value obtained from similar plots for the gases CO2, O2, and Ne at 08C (see Fig. 5.6).
See Exercise 5.133
Charles‚Äôs Law
In the century following Boyle‚Äôs findings, scientists continued to study the properties 
of gases. One of these scientists was a French physicist, Jacques Charles (1746‚Äì1823), 
who was the first person to fill a balloon with hydrogen gas and who made the first solo 
balloon flight. Charles found in 1787 that the volume of a gas at constant pressure 
increases linearly with the temperature of the gas. That is, a plot of the volume of a gas 
(at constant pressure) versus its temperature (8C) gives a straight line. This behavior is 
shown for samples of several gases in Fig. 5.8. The slopes of the lines in this graph are 
different  because the samples contain different numbers of moles of gas. A very inter-
esting feature of these plots is that the volumes of all the gases extrapolate to zero at 
the same temperature, 22738C. On the Kelvin temperature scale, this point is defined

as 0 K, which leads to the following relationship between the Kelvin and Celsius 
scales:
K 5 ¬∞C 1 273
When the volumes of the gases shown in Fig. 5.8 are plotted versus temperature on the 
Kelvin scale, the plots in Fig. 5.9 result. In this case, the volume of each gas is directly 
proportional to temperature and extrapolates to zero when the temperature is 0 K. This 
behavior is represented by the equation known as Charles‚Äôs law,
V 5 bT
where T is in kelvins and b is a proportionality constant.
 
Before we illustrate the uses of Charles‚Äôs law, let us consider the importance of 0 K. 
At temperatures below this point, the extrapolated volumes would become negative. 
The fact that a gas cannot have a negative volume suggests that 0 K has a special sig-
nificance. In fact, 0 K is called absolute zero, and there is much evidence to suggest 
that this  temperature cannot be attained. Temperatures of approximately 0.000000001¬†K 
have been produced in laboratories, but 0 K has never been reached.
CRITICAL THINKING According to Charles‚Äôs law, the volume 
of a gas is directly related to its temperature in kelvins at constant pressure 
and number of moles. What if the volume of a gas was directly related to its 
temperature in degrees Celsius at constant pressure and number of moles? 
What differences would you notice?

Avogadro‚Äôs Law
In Chapter 2 we noted that in 1811 the Italian chemist Avogadro postulated that 
equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain the same num-
ber of ‚Äúparticles.‚Äù This observation is called Avogadro‚Äôs law, which is illustrated by 
Fig.¬†5.10. Stated mathematically, Avogadro‚Äôs law is
V 5 an
where V is the volume of the gas, n is the number of moles of gas particles, and a is a 
proportionality constant. This equation states that for a gas at constant temperature 
and pressure, the volume is directly proportional to the number of moles of gas. This 
relationship is obeyed closely by gases at low pressures.
Avogadro‚Äôs Law
Suppose we have a 12.2-L sample containing 0.50 mole of oxygen gas (O2) at a pres-
sure of 1 atm and a temperature of 258C. If all this O2 were converted to ozone (O3) at 
the same temperature and pressure, what would be the volume of the ozone?

5.3 The Ideal Gas Law
We have considered three laws that describe the behavior of gases as revealed by 
experimental observations:
 Boyle‚Äôs law:¬†¬†¬†¬†V 5 k
P¬†¬†¬†¬†  1at constant T and n2
 Charles‚Äôs law:¬†¬†¬†¬†V 5 bT¬†¬†¬†¬† 1at constant P and n2
 Avogadro‚Äôs law:¬†¬†¬†¬†V 5 an¬†¬†¬†¬† 1at constant T and P2
These relationships, which show how the volume of a gas depends on pressure, tem-
perature, and number of moles of gas present, can be combined as follows:

where R is the combined proportionality constant called the universal gas constant. 
When the pressure is expressed in atmospheres and the volume in liters, R has the 
value 0.08206 L ? atm/K ? mol. The preceding equation can be rearranged to the more 
familiar form of the ideal gas law:
PV 5 nRT
 
The ideal gas law is an equation of state for a gas, where the state of the gas is its 
condition at a given time. A particular state of a gas is described by its pressure, vol-
ume, temperature, and number of moles. Knowledge of any three of these properties is 
enough to completely define the state of a gas, since the fourth property can then be 
determined from the equation for the ideal gas law.
 
It is important to recognize that the ideal gas law is an empirical equation‚Äîit is based 
on experimental measurements of the properties of gases. A gas that obeys this equation 
is said to behave ideally. The ideal gas equation is best regarded as a limiting law‚Äîit 
expresses behavior that real gases approach at low pressures and high temperatures. 
Therefore, an ideal gas is a hypothetical substance. However, most gases obey the ideal 
gas equation closely enough at pressures below 1 atm that only minimal errors result 
from  assuming ideal behavior. Unless you are given information to the contrary, you 
should  assume ideal gas behavior when solving problems involving gases in this text.
 
The ideal gas law can be used to solve a variety of problems. Example 5.6 demon-
strates one type, where you are asked to find one property characterizing the state of a 
gas, given the other three.
Ideal Gas Law I
A sample of hydrogen gas (H2) has a volume of 8.56 L at a temperature of 08C and a 
pressure of 1.5 atm. Calculate the moles of H2 molecules present in this gas sample.

Gas law problems can be solved in a variety of ways. They can be classified as a 
Boyle‚Äôs law, Charles‚Äôs law, or Avogadro‚Äôs law problem and solved, but now we need 
to remember the specific law and when it applies. The real advantage of using the 
ideal gas law is that it applies to virtually any problem dealing with gases and is easy 
to remember.
 
The basic assumption we make when using the ideal gas law to describe a change 
in state for a gas is that the equation applies equally well to both the initial and final 
states. In dealing with changes in state, we always place the variables that change on 
one side of the equal sign and the constants on the other. Let‚Äôs see how this might work 
in several examples.
Ideal Gas Law II
Suppose we have a sample of ammonia gas with a volume of 7.0 mL at a pressure of 
1.68 atm. The gas is compressed to a volume of 2.7 mL at a constant temperature. Use 
the ideal gas law to calculate the final pressure.

The problem in Example 5.8 could be described as a Charles‚Äôs law problem, 
whereas the problem in Example 5.7 might be called a Boyle‚Äôs law problem. In both 
cases, however, we started with the ideal gas law. The real advantage of using the 
ideal gas law is that it applies to virtually any problem dealing with gases and is easy 
to  remember.

Since the equation used in Example 5.9 involves a ratio of pressures, it was unnec-
essary to convert pressures to units of atmospheres. The units of torrs cancel. (You
will obtain the same answer by inserting P1 5 345
760 and P2 5 468
760 into the equation.) 
However, temperature must always be converted to the Kelvin scale; since this conver-
sion involves addition of 273, the conversion factor does not cancel. Be careful.

 using the ideal gas law is illustrated in Example 5.10.

5.4 Gas Stoichiometry
Suppose we have 1 mole of an ideal gas at 08C (273.2 K) and 1 atm. From the ideal gas 
law, the volume of the gas is given by

P
5 11.000 mol2 10.08206 L # atm/K # mol2 1273.2 K2
1.000 atm
5 22.42 L
This volume of 22.42 L is the molar volume of an ideal gas (at 08C and 1 atm). The 
measured molar volumes of several gases are listed in Table 5.2. Note that the molar 
 volumes of some of the gases are very close to the ideal value, while others deviate sig-
nificantly. Later in this chapter, we will discuss some of the reasons for the deviations.
 
The conditions 08C and 1 atm, called standard temperature and pressure (abbre-
viated STP), are common reference conditions for the properties of gases. For exam-
ple, the molar volume of an ideal gas is 22.42 L at STP (Fig. 5.11).
CRITICAL THINKING What if STP was defined as normal room 
temperature (22¬∞C) and 1 atm? How would this affect the molar volume of an 
ideal gas? Include an explanation and a number.
Gas Stoichiometry I
A sample of nitrogen gas has a volume of 1.75 L at STP. How many moles of N2 are 
present?
 
SOLUTION 
We could solve this problem by using the ideal gas equation, but we can take a shortcut by 
using the molar volume of an ideal gas at STP. Since 1 mole of an ideal gas at STP has 
a volume of 22.42 L, 1.75 L N2 at STP will contain less than 1 mole. We can find how 
many moles using the ratio of 1.75 L to 22.42 L:
1.75 L N2 3 1 mol N2
22.42 L N2
5 7.81 3 1022 mol N2
See Exercises 5.71 and 5.72
Many chemical reactions involve gases. By assuming ideal behavior for these 
gases, we can carry out stoichiometric calculations if the pressure, volume, and tem-
perature of the gases are known.
When 273.15 K is used in  
this calculation, the molar  
volume obtained in Example 5.3 is the 
same value as 22.41 L.

Gas Stoichiometry II
Quicklime (CaO) is produced by the thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate 
(CaCO3). Calculate the volume of CO2 at STP produced from the decomposition of 
152 g CaCO3 by the reaction
CaCO31s2 h CaO1s2 1 CO21g2
 
SOLUTION 
Where are we going?
To use stoichiometry to determine the volume of CO2 produced
What do we know?
‚ùØ CaCO31s2 h CaO1s2 1 CO21g2
What information do we need?
‚ùØ Molar volume of a gas at STP is 22.42 L
How do we get there?
We need to use the strategy for solving stoichiometry problems that we learned in 
Chapter 3.
1. What is the balanced equation?
CaCO31s2 h CaO1s2 1 CO21g2
2. What are the moles of CaCO3 (100.09 g/mol)?
152 g CaCO3 3
1 mol CaCO3
100.09 g CaCO3
5 1.52 mol CaCO3
3. What is the mole ratio between CO2 and CaCO3 in the balanced equation?
1 mol CO2
1 mol CaCO3
4. What are the moles of CO2?
1.52 moles of CO2, which is the same as the moles of CaCO3 because the 
mole ratio is 1.
5. What is the volume of CO2 produced?
We can compute this by using the molar volume since the sample is at STP:
‚ñ† 1.52 mol CO2 3 22.42 L CO2
1 mol CO2
5 34.1 L CO2
‚ùØ Thus the decomposition of 152 g CaCO3 produces 34.1 L CO2 at STP.
See Exercises 5.73 through 5.76
 
Note that in Example 5.12 the final step involved calculation of the volume of gas 
from the number of moles. Since the conditions were specified as STP, we were able 
to use the molar volume of a gas at STP. If the conditions of a problem are different 
from STP, the ideal gas law must be used to compute the volume.

We need to use the strategy for solving stoichiometry problems that we learned in 
 Chapter 3.
1. What is the balanced equation?
From the description of the reaction, the unbalanced equation is
CH41g2 1 O21g2 h CO21g2 1 H2O1g2
which can be balanced to give
CH41g2 1 2O21g2 h CO21g2 1 2H2O1g2
2. What is the limiting reactant?
We can determine this by using the ideal gas law to determine the moles for 
each  reactant:
 nCH4 5 PV
RT 5
11.65 atm2 12.80  L2
10.08206 L # atm/K #  mol2 1298 K2 5 0.189 mol

RT 5
11.25 atm2 135.0 L2
10.08206 L # atm/K #  mol2 1304 K2 5 1.75 mol
In the balanced equation for the combustion reaction, 1 mole of CH4 requires  
2 moles of O2. Thus the moles of O2 required by 0.189 mole of CH4 can be 
calculated as follows:
0.189 mol CH4 3 2 mol O2
1 mol CH4
5 0.378 mol O2
The limiting reactant is CH4.
3. What are the moles of CO2?
Since CH4 is limiting, we use the moles of CH4 to determine the moles of CO2 
 produced:
0.189 mol CH4 3 1 mol CO2
1 mol CH4
5 0.189 mol CO2

Since the conditions stated are not STP, we must use the ideal gas law to 
calculate the volume:

In this case n 5 0.189 mol, T 5 1258C 1 273 5 398 K, P 5 2.50 atm, and

This represents the volume of CO2 produced under these conditions.
See Exercises 5.77 and 5.80
Molar Mass of a Gas
One very important use of the ideal gas law is in the calculation of the molar mass 
(mo lecular weight) of a gas from its measured density. To see the relationship between 
gas density and molar mass, consider that the number of moles of gas, n, can be 
expressed as
n 5 grams of gas
molar mass 5

m

Substitution into the ideal gas equation gives
P 5 nRT

However, myV is the gas density, d, in units of grams per liter. Thus

Thus, if the density of a gas at a given temperature and pressure is known, its molar 
mass can be calculated.

You could memorize the equation involving gas density and molar mass, but it is 
better simply to remember the ideal gas equation, the definition of density, and the 
relationship between number of moles and molar mass. You can then derive the appro-
priate equation when you need it. This approach ensures that you understand the con-
cepts and means one less equation to memorize.
5.5 Dalton‚Äôs Law of Partial Pressures
Among the experiments that led John Dalton to propose the atomic theory were his 
studies of mixtures of gases. In 1803 Dalton summarized his observations as follows: 
For a mixture of gases in a container, the total pressure exerted is the sum of the pres-
sures that each gas would exert if it were alone. This statement, known as Dalton‚Äôs 
law of partial pressures, can be expressed as follows:
PTOTAL 5 P1 1 P2 1 P3 1 c
where the subscripts refer to the individual gases (gas 1, gas 2, and so on). The sym-
bols P1, P2, P3, and so on represent each partial pressure, the pressure that a particular 
gas would exert if it were alone in the container.
 
Assuming that each gas behaves ideally, the partial pressure of each gas can be 
calculated from the ideal gas law:
P1 5 n1RT
V ,¬†¬†¬†¬†P2 5 n2RT
V ,¬†¬†¬†¬†P3 5 n3RT
V ,¬†¬†¬†¬†c
The total pressure of the mixture PTOTAL can be represented as
 PTOTAL 5 P1 1 P2 1 P3 1 c5 n1RT
V
1 n2RT
V
1 n3RT
V
1 c
 5 1n1 1 n2 1 n3 1 c2 aRT
V b
 5 nTOTAL aRT
V b
where nTOTAL is the sum of the numbers of moles of the various gases. Thus, for a mix-
ture of ideal gases, it is the total number of moles of particles that is important, not the 
identity or composition of the involved gas particles. This idea is illustrated in Fig. 5.12.
 
This important observation indicates some fundamental characteristics of an ideal 
gas. The fact that the pressure exerted by an ideal gas is not affected by the identity

(composition) of the gas particles reveals two things about ideal gases: (1) the volume of 
the individual gas particle must not be important, and (2) the forces among the particles 
must not be important. If these factors were important, the pressure exerted by the gas 
would depend on the nature of the individual particles. These observations will strongly 
influence the model that we will eventually construct to explain ideal gas behavior.

At this point we need to define the mole fraction: the ratio of the number of moles 
of a given component in a mixture to the total number of moles in the mixture. The

ssume you work for an oil company 
that owns a huge natural gas reser-
voir containing a mixture of methane 
and nitrogen gases. In fact, the gas 
mixture contains so much nitrogen that 
it is unusable as a fuel. Your job is to 
separate the nitrogen (N2) from the 
methane (CH4). How might you accom-
plish this task? You clearly need some 
sort of ‚Äúmolecular filter‚Äù that will stop 
the slightly larger methane molecules 
(size < 430 pm) and allow the nitrogen 
molecules (size < 410 pm) to pass 
through. To accomplish the separation 
of molecules so similar in size will 
require a very precise ‚Äúfilter.‚Äù
The good news is that such a filter 
exists. Work by Steven Kuznicki and 
Valerie Bell at Engelhard Corporation  
in New Jersey and Michael Tsapatsis  
at the University of Massachusetts has 
produced a ‚Äúmolecular sieve‚Äù in which 
the pore (passage) sizes can be 
adjusted precisely enough to separate 
N2 molecules from CH4 molecules. The 
material involved is a special hydrated 
titanosilicate (contains H2O, Ti, Si, O, 
and Sr) compound patented by 
Engelhard known as ETS-4 (Engelhard 
TitanoSilicate-4). When sodium ions 
are substituted for the strontium ions 
in ETS-4 and the new material is care-
fully dehydrated, a uniform and con-
trollable pore-size reduction occurs 
(see figure). The researchers have 
shown that the material can be used  
to separate N2 (<¬†410 pm) from O2 
(<¬†390¬†pm). They have also shown that 
it is possible to reduce the nitrogen 
content of natural gas from 18% to less 
than 5% with a 90% recovery of 
methane.

he inclusion of air bags in modern 
automobiles has led to a signifi-
cant reduction in the number of inju-
ries as a result of car crashes. Air bags 
are stored in the steering wheel and 
dashboard of all cars, and many autos 
now have additional air bags that 
protect the occupant‚Äôs knees, head, 
and shoulders. In fact, some auto 
manufacturers now include air bags in 
the seat belts. Also, because deploy-
ment of an air bag can severely injure 
a child, all cars now have ‚Äúsmart‚Äù air 
bags that deploy with an inflation 
force that is proportional to the seat 
occupant‚Äôs weight.
The term ‚Äúair bag‚Äù is really a misno-
mer because air is not involved in the 
inflation process. Rather, an air bag 
inflates rapidly (in about 30 ms) due to 
the explosive production of N2¬†gas. 
Originally, sodium azide, which decom-
poses to produce N2,
2NaN31s2 S 2Na1s2 1 3N21g2
was used, but it has now been replaced 
by less toxic materials.
The sensing devices that trigger the 
air bags must react very rapidly. For 
example, consider a car hitting a con-
crete bridge abutment. When this hap-
pens, an internal accelerometer sends a 
message to the control module that a 
collision possibly is occurring. The 
microprocessor then analyzes the mea-
sured deceleration from several acceler-
ometers and door pressure sensors and 
decides whether air bag deployment is 
appropriate. All this happens within 8 to 
40 ms of the initial impact.
Because an air bag must provide the 
appropriate cushioning effect, the bag 
begins to vent even as it is being filled. 
In fact, the maximum pressure in the 
bag is 5 pounds per square inch (psi), 
even in the middle of a collision event. 
Air bags represent a case where an 
explosive chemical reaction saves lives 
rather than the reverse.

Collecting a Gas over Water
A mixture of gases results whenever a gas is collected by displacement of water. For 
example, Fig. 5.13 shows the collection of oxygen gas produced by the decomposition 
of solid potassium chlorate. In this situation, the gas in the bottle is a mixture of water 
vapor and the oxygen being collected. Water vapor is present because molecules of 
water escape from the surface of the liquid and collect in the space above the liquid. 
Molecules of water also return to the liquid. When the rate of escape equals the rate of

return, the number of water molecules in the vapor state remains constant, and thus the 
pressure of water vapor remains constant. This pressure, which depends on tempera-
ture, is called the vapor pressure of water.

We have so far considered the behavior of gases from an experimental point of view. 
Based on observations from different types of experiments, we know that at pressures 
of less than 1 atm most gases closely approach the behavior described by the ideal gas 
law. Now we want to construct a model to explain this behavior.
 
Before we do this, let‚Äôs briefly review the scientific method. Recall that a law is a 
way of generalizing behavior that has been observed in many experiments. Laws are 
very useful, since they allow us to predict the behavior of similar systems. For exam-
ple, if a chemist prepares a new gaseous compound, a measurement of the gas density 
at known pressure and temperature can provide a reliable value for the compound‚Äôs 
molar mass.
 
However, although laws summarize observed behavior, they do not tell us why
nature behaves in the observed fashion. This is the central question for scientists. 
To try to answer this question, we construct theories (build models). The models in 
chemistry consist of speculations about what the individual atoms or molecules

(microscopic particles) might be doing to cause the observed behavior of the mac-
roscopic systems (collections of very large numbers of atoms and molecules).
 
A model is considered successful if it explains the observed behavior in question 
and predicts correctly the results of future experiments. It is important to understand 
that a model can never be proved absolutely true. In fact, any model is an approxima-
tion by its very nature and is bound to fail at some point. Models range from the simple 
to the extraordinarily complex. We use simple models to predict approximate behavior 
and more complicated models to account very precisely for observed quantitative 
behavior. In this text we will stress simple models that provide an approximate picture 
of what might be happening and that fit the most important experimental results.
 
An example of this type of model is the kinetic molecular theory (KMT), a simple 
model that attempts to explain the properties of an ideal gas. This model is based on 
speculations about the behavior of the individual gas particles (atoms or molecules). 
The postulates of the kinetic molecular theory as they relate to the particles of an ideal 
gas can be stated as follows:
Postulates of the Kinetic Molecular Theory
1. The particles are so small compared with the distances between them that the volume of 
the individual particles can be assumed to be negligible (zero) (Fig. 5.14).
2. The particles are in constant motion. The collisions of the particles with the walls of the 
container are the cause of the pressure exerted by the gas.
3. The particles are assumed to exert no forces on each other; they are assumed neither to 
attract nor to repel each other.
4. The average kinetic energy of a collection of gas particles is assumed to be directly propor-
tional to the Kelvin temperature of the gas.
 
Of course, the molecules in a real gas have finite volumes and do exert forces on 
each other. Thus real gases do not conform to these assumptions. However, we will see 
that these postulates do indeed explain ideal gas behavior.
 
The true test of a model is how well its predictions fit the experimental observa-
tions. The postulates of the kinetic molecular model picture an ideal gas as consisting 
of particles having no volume and no attractions for each other, and the model assumes 
that the gas produces pressure on its container by collisions with the walls.
 
Let‚Äôs consider how this model accounts for the properties of gases as summarized 
by the ideal gas law: PV 5 nRT.

Pressure and Volume (Boyle‚Äôs Law)
We have seen that for a given sample of gas at a given temperature (n and T are con-
stant) that if the volume of a gas is decreased, the pressure increases:
P 5 1nRT2  1
V
‚éß
‚é®
‚é©
h 
Constant
This makes sense based on the kinetic molecular theory because a decrease in volume 
means that the gas particles will hit the wall more often, thus increasing pressure 
(Fig. 5.15).
Pressure and Temperature
From the ideal gas law, we can predict that for a given sample of an ideal gas at a con-
stant volume, the pressure will be directly proportional to the temperature:
P 5 anR
V bT
‚éß
‚é®
‚é©
 
 
h 
 
Constant
The KMT accounts for this behavior because when the temperature of a gas increases, 
the speeds of its particles increase, the particles hitting the wall with greater force and 
greater frequency. Since the volume remains the same, this would result in increased 
gas pressure (Fig. 5.16).
CRITICAL THINKING You have learned the postulates of the 
KMT. What if we could not assume the third postulate to be true? How would 
this affect the measured pressure of a gas?
Volume and Temperature (Charles‚Äôs Law)
The ideal gas law indicates that for a given sample of gas at a constant pressure, the 
volume of the gas is directly proportional to the temperature in kelvins:

This can be visualized from the KMT (Fig. 5.17). When the gas is heated to a higher

often and with more force. The only way to keep the pressure constant in this situa-
tion is to increase the volume of the container. This compensates for the increased 
particle speeds.
Volume and Number of Moles 
(Avogadro‚Äôs Law)
The ideal gas law predicts that the volume of a gas at a constant temperature and pres-
sure depends directly on the number of gas particles present:
V 5 aRT
P b  n
‚éß
‚é®
‚é©
 
 
h 
 
Constant
This makes sense in terms of the KMT because an increase in the number of gas par-
ticles at the same temperature would cause the pressure to increase if the volume were 
held constant (Fig. 5.18). The only way to return the pressure to its original value is to 
increase the volume.
It is important to recognize that the volume of a gas (at constant P and T) depends 
only on the number of gas particles present. The individual volumes of the particles are 
not a factor because the particle volumes are so small compared with the distances 
between the particles (for a gas behaving ideally).
Mixture of Gases (Dalton‚Äôs Law)
The observation that the total pressure exerted by a mixture of gases is the sum of the 
pressures of the individual gases is expected because the KMT assumes that all gas 
particles are independent of each other and that the volumes of the individual particles 
are unimportant. Thus the identities of the gas particles do not matter.

Deriving the Ideal Gas Law
We have shown qualitatively that the assumptions of the KMT successfully account 
for the observed behavior of an ideal gas. We can go further. By applying the principles 
of physics to the assumptions of the KMT, we can in effect derive the ideal gas law.
 
As shown in detail in Appendix 2, we can apply the definitions of velocity, momen-
tum, force, and pressure to the collection of particles in an ideal gas and derive the 
 following expression for pressure:
P 5 2
3 c nNA1 1
2mu22
V

where P is the pressure of the gas, n is the number of moles of gas, NA is Avogadro‚Äôs 
number, m is the mass of each particle, u2 is the average of the square of the velocities 
of the particles, and V is the volume of the container.
 
The quantity 1
2mu2 represents the average kinetic energy of a gas particle. If the 
average kinetic energy of an individual particle is multiplied by NA, the number of 
particles in a mole, we get the average kinetic energy for a mole of gas particles:
1KE2 avg 5 NA1 1

The fourth postulate of the kinetic molecular theory is that the average kinetic 
energy of the particles in the gas sample is directly proportional to the temperature in 
kelvin. Thus, since (KE)avg ~ T, we can write

Note that this expression has been derived from the assumptions of the kinetic molecu-
lar theory. How does it compare to the ideal gas law‚Äîthe equation obtained from 
experiment? Compare the ideal gas law,

with the result from the kinetic molecular theory,
PV

These expressions have exactly the same form if R, the universal gas constant, is con-
sidered the proportionality constant in the second case.
The agreement between the ideal gas law and the predictions of the kinetic molecu-
lar theory gives us confidence in the validity of the model. The characteristics we have 
assumed for ideal gas particles must agree, at least under certain conditions, with their 
actual behavior.
The Meaning of Temperature
We have seen from the kinetic molecular theory that the Kelvin temperature indicates 
the average kinetic energy of the gas particles. The exact relationship between tem-
perature and average kinetic energy can be obtained by combining the equations:
PV
n 5 RT 5 2
3
 1KE2 avg
which yields the expression
1KE2 avg 5 3
2RT
This is a very important relationship. It summarizes the meaning of the Kelvin tem-
perature of a gas: The Kelvin temperature is an index of the random motions of the 
particles of a gas, with higher temperature meaning greater motion. (As we will see in 
Chapter 10, temperature is an index of the random motions in solids and liquids as well 
as in gases.)
Root Mean Square Velocity
In the equation from the kinetic molecular theory, the average velocity of the gas par-
ticles is a special kind of average. The symbol u2 means the average of the squares of 
the particle velocities. The square root of u2 is called the root mean square velocity 
and is symbolized by urms:
urms 5 "u2
We can obtain an expression for urms from the equations
1KE2 avg 5 NA11

In this expression m represents the mass in kilograms of a single gas particle. When 
NA, the number of particles in a mole, is multiplied by m, the product is the mass of a 
mole of gas particles in kilograms. We will call this quantity M. Substituting M for 
NAm in the equation for urms, we obtain
urms 5 √Ö

M
Before we can use this equation, we need to consider the units for R. So far we have 
used 0.08206 L # atm/K # mol as the value of R. But to obtain the desired units (meters 
per second) for urms, R must be expressed in different units. As we will see in more 
detail in Chapter 6, the energy unit most often used in the SI system is the joule (J). A 
joule is defined as a kilogram meter squared per second squared (kg ? m2/s2). When R 
is converted to include the unit of joules, it has the value 8.3145 J/K ? mol. When R in 
these units is used in the expression !3RT/M, urms is obtained in the units of meters 
per second as desired.

So far we have said nothing about the range of velocities actually found in a gas 
sample. In a real gas, there are large numbers of collisions between particles. For 
example, as we will see in the next section, when an odorous gas such as ammonia is 
released in a room, it takes some time for the odor to permeate the air. This delay 
results from collisions between the NH3 molecules and the O2 and N2 molecules in the 
air, which greatly slow the mixing process.
 
If the path of a particular gas particle could be monitored, it would look very erratic, 
something like that shown in Fig. 5.19. The average distance a particle travels between 
collisions in a particular gas sample is called the mean free path. It is typically a very 
small distance (1 3 1027 m for O2 at STP). One effect of the many collisions among gas 
particles is to produce a large range of velocities as the particles collide and exchange 
kinetic energy. Although urms for oxygen gas at STP is approximately 500¬†m/s, the 
majority of O2 molecules do not have this velocity. The actual distribution of molecular 
velocities for oxygen gas at STP is shown in Fig. 5.20. This figure shows the relative 
number of gas molecules having each particular velocity.
 
We are also interested in the effect of temperature on the velocity distribution in a 
gas. Figure 5.21 shows the velocity distribution (called the Maxwell-Boltzmann distri-
bution) for nitrogen gas at three temperatures. Note that as the temperature is increased, 
the curve peak moves toward higher values and the range of velocities becomes much 
larger. The peak of the curve reflects the most probable velocity (the velocity found 
most often as we sample the movement of the various particles in the gas). Because the 
kinetic energy increases with temperature, it makes sense that the peak of the curve 
should move to higher values as the temperature of the gas is increased.
5.7 Effusion and Diffusion
We have seen that the postulates of the kinetic molecular theory, when combined with 
the appropriate physical principles, produce an equation that successfully fits the 
experimentally observed behavior of gases as they approach ideal behavior. Two phe-
nomena involving gases provide further tests of this model.
Diffusion is the term used to describe the mixing of gases. When a small amount of 
pungent-smelling ammonia is released at the front of a classroom, it takes some time 
before everyone in the room can smell it, because time is required for the ammonia to 
mix with the air. The rate of diffusion is the rate of the mixing of gases. Effusion is the

term used to describe the passage of a gas through a tiny orifice into an evacuated 
chamber, as shown in Fig. 5.22. The rate of effusion measures the speed at which the 
gas is transferred into the chamber.
Effusion
Thomas Graham (1805‚Äì1869), a Scottish chemist, found experimentally that the rate 
of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass of its par-
ticles. Stated in another way, the relative rates of effusion of two gases at the same 
temperature and pressure are given by the inverse ratio of the square roots of the 
masses of the gas particles:
Rate of effusion for gas 1
Rate of effusion for gas 2 5 "M2
"M1
where M1 and M2 represent the molar masses of the gases. This equation is called  
Graham‚Äôs law of effusion.
Effusion Rates
Calculate the ratio of the effusion rates of hydrogen gas (H2) and uranium hexafluo-
ride (UF6), a gas used in the enrichment process to produce fuel for nuclear reactors 
(Fig. 5.23).
 
SOLUTION 
First we need to compute the molar masses: Molar mass of H2 5 2.016 g/mol, and molar 
mass of UF6 5 352.02 g/mol. Using Graham‚Äôs law,

Does the kinetic molecular model for gases correctly predict the relative effusion 
rates of gases summarized by Graham‚Äôs law? To answer this question, we must recog-
nize that the effusion rate for a gas depends directly on the average velocity of its 
particles. The faster the gas particles are moving, the more likely they are to pass

This equation is identical to Graham‚Äôs law. Thus the kinetic molecular model does fit 
the experimental results for the effusion of gases.
Diffusion
Diffusion is frequently illustrated by the lecture demonstration represented in Fig. 5.24, 
in which two cotton plugs soaked in ammonia and hydrochloric acid are simultane-
ously placed at the ends of a long tube. A white ring of ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) 
forms where the NH3 and HCl molecules meet several minutes later:
NH31g2 1 HCl1g2 h NH4Cl1s2
 
White solid
As a first approximation, we might expect that the distances traveled by the two gases 
are related to the relative velocities of the gas molecules:
Distance traveled by NH3
Distance traveled by HCl 5 urms for NH3
urms for HCl 5 √Ö
MHCl
MNH3
5 √Ö
36.5
17 5 1.5
However, careful experiments produce an observed ratio of less than 1.5, indicating 
that a quantitative analysis of diffusion requires a more complex analysis.
 
The diffusion of the gases through the tube is surprisingly slow in light of the fact that 
the velocities of HCl and NH3 molecules at 258C are about 450 and 660 m/s, respectively. 
Why does it take several minutes for the NH3 and HCl molecules to meet? The answer is 
that the tube contains air and thus the NH3 and HCl molecules undergo many collisions 
with O2 and N2 molecules as they travel through the tube. Because so many collisions 
occur when gases mix, diffusion is quite complicated to describe theoretically.
 
5.8 Real Gases
An ideal gas is a hypothetical concept. No gas exactly follows the ideal gas law, 
although many gases come very close at low pressures and/or high temperatures. Thus 
ideal gas behavior can best be thought of as the behavior approached by real gases 
under certain conditions.

We have seen that a very simple model, the kinetic molecular theory, by making 
some rather drastic assumptions (no interparticle interactions and zero volume for the 
gas particles), successfully explains ideal behavior. However, it is important that we 
examine real gas behavior to see how it differs from that predicted by the ideal gas law 
and to determine what modifications are needed in the kinetic molecular theory to 
explain the observed behavior. Since a model is an approximation and will inevitably 
fail, we must be ready to learn from such failures. In fact, we often learn more about 
nature from the failures of our models than from their successes.
 
We will examine the experimentally observed behavior of real gases by measuring 
the pressure, volume, temperature, and number of moles for a gas and noting how the 
quantity PVynRT depends on pressure. Plots of PVynRT versus P are shown for sev-
eral gases in Fig. 5.25. For an ideal gas, PVynRT equals 1 under all conditions, but 
notice that for real gases, PVynRT approaches 1 only at very low pressures (typically 
below 1 atm). To illustrate the effect of temperature, PVynRT is plotted versus P for 
nitrogen gas at several temperatures in Fig. 5.26. Note that the behavior of the gas 
appears to become more nearly ideal as the temperature is increased. The most impor-
tant conclusion to be drawn from these figures is that a real gas typically exhibits 
behavior that is closest to ideal behavior at low pressures and high temperatures.
 
One of the most important procedures in science is correcting our models as we 
collect more data. We will understand more clearly how gases actually behave if we 
can figure out how to correct the simple model that explains the ideal gas law so that 
the new model fits the behavior we actually observe for gases. So the question is: 
How can we modify the assumptions of the kinetic molecular theory to fit the behav-
ior of real gases? The first person to do important work in this area was Johannes van 
der Waals (1837‚Äì1923), a physics professor at the University of Amsterdam who in 
1910 received a Nobel Prize for his work. To follow his analysis, we start with the 
ideal gas law,
P 5 nRT
V
Remember that this equation describes the behavior of a hypothetical gas consisting of 
volumeless entities that do not interact with each other. In contrast, a real gas consists 
of atoms or molecules that have finite volumes. Therefore, the volume available to a 
given particle in a real gas is less than the volume of the container because the gas 
particles themselves take up some of the space. To account for this discrepancy, van 
der Waals represented the actual volume as the volume of the container V minus a cor-
rection factor for the volume of the molecules nb, where n is the number of moles of 
gas and b is an empirical constant (one determined by fitting the equation to the experi-
mental results). Thus the volume actually available to a given gas molecule is given by 
the difference V 2 nb.
 
This modification of the ideal gas equation leads to the equation
Pr 5
nRT
V 2 nb
The volume of the gas particles has now been taken into account.
 
The next step is to allow for the attractions that occur among the particles in a real 
gas. The effect of these attractions is to make the observed pressure Pobs smaller than 
it would be if the gas particles did not interact:
Pobs 5 1Pr 2 correction factor2 5 a nRT
V 2 nb 2 correction factorb
This effect can be understood using the following model. When gas particles come 
close together, attractive forces occur, which cause the particles to hit the wall very 
slightly less often than they would in the absence of these interactions (Fig. 5.27).
 
The size of the correction factor depends on the concentration of gas molecules 
defined in terms of moles of gas particles per liter (nyV). The higher the concentration, 
P9 is corrected for the finite volume of the 
particles. The attractive forces have not yet 
been taken into account.
The attractive forces among molecules will 
be discussed in Chapter 10.

the more likely a pair of gas particles will be close enough to attract each other. For 
large numbers of particles, the number of interacting pairs of particles depends on the 
square of the number of particles and thus on the square of the concentration, or (nyV)2. 
This can be justified as follows: In a gas sample containing N particles, there are 
N 2 1 partners available for each particle (Fig. 5.28). Since the 1 c 2 pair is the same 
as the 2 c 1 pair, this analysis counts each pair twice. Thus, for N particles, there are 
N(N 2 1)y2 pairs. If N is a very large number, N 2 1 approximately equals N, giving 
N2y2 possible pairs. Thus the pressure, corrected for the attractions of the particles, has 
the form
Pobs 5 Pr 2 a a n

where a is a proportionality constant (which includes the factor of 1
2 from N2y2). The 
value of a for a given real gas can be determined from observing the actual behavior of 
that gas. Inserting the corrections for both the volume of the particles and the attrac-
tions of the particles gives the equation

The values of the weighting factors a and b are determined for a given gas by fitting 
experimental behavior. That is, a and b are varied until the best fit of the observed pres-
sure is obtained under all conditions. The values of a and b for various gases are given 
in Table 5.3.
Experimental studies indicate that the changes van der Waals made in the basic 
assumptions of the kinetic molecular theory correct the major flaws in the model. First, 
consider the effects of volume. For a gas at low pressure (large volume), the volume of 
the container is very large compared with the volumes of the gas particles. That is, in 
this case the volume available to the gas is essentially equal to the volume of the con-
tainer, and the gas behaves ideally. On the other hand, for a gas at high pressure (small 
container volume), the volume of the particles becomes significant so that the volume 
available to the gas is significantly less than the container volume. These cases are 
illustrated in Fig. 5.29. Note from Table 5.3 that the volume correction constant b gen-
erally increases with the size of the gas molecule, which gives further support to these 
arguments.
The fact that a real gas tends to behave more ideally at high temperatures also can be 
explained in terms of the van der Waals model. At high temperatures the particles are 
moving so rapidly that the effects of interparticle interactions are not very important.
We have now corrected for both the finite 
volume and the attractive forces of the 
particles.

The corrections to the kinetic molecular theory that van der Waals found necessary 
to explain real gas behavior make physical sense, which makes us confident that we 
understand the fundamentals of gas behavior at the particle level. This is significant 
because so much important chemistry takes place in the gas phase. In fact, the mixture 
of gases called the atmosphere is vital to our existence. In Section 5.10 we consider 
some of the important reactions that occur in the atmosphere.
5.9 Characteristics of Several 
Real Gases
We can understand gas behavior more completely if we examine the characteristics of 
several common gases. Note from Fig. 5.25 that the gases H2, N2, CH4, and CO2 show 
different behavior when the compressibility a PV
nRTb is plotted versus P. For example, 
notice that the plot for H2(g) never drops below the ideal value (1.0) in contrast to all the 
other gases. What is special about H2 compared to these other gases? Recall from Sec-
tion 5.8 that the reason that the compressibility of a real gas falls below 1.0 is that the 
actual (observed) pressure is lower than the pressure expected for an ideal gas due to the 
intermo lecular attractions that occur in real gases. This must mean that H2 molecules 
have very low attractive forces for each other. This idea is borne out by looking at the van 
der Waals a value for H2 in Table 5.3. Note that H2 has the lowest value among the gases 
H2, N2, CH4, and CO2. Remember that the value of a reflects how much of a correction 
must be made to adjust the observed pressure up to the expected ideal pressure:
Pideal 5 Pobserved 1 a a n
Vb
2
A low value for a reflects weak intermolecular forces among the gas molecules.
 
Also notice that although the compressibility for N2 dips below 1.0, it does not 
show as much deviation as that for CH4, which in turn does not show as much devia-
tion as the compressibility for CO2. Based on this behavior, we can surmise that the 
importance of intermolecular interactions increases in this order:
H2 , N2 , CH4 , CO2
This order is reflected by the relative a values for these gases in Table 5.3. In Section 
10.1, we will see how these variations in intermolecular interactions can be explained. 
The main point to be made here is that real gas behavior can tell us about the relative 
importance of intermolecular attractions among gas molecules.

CRITICAL THINKING You have learned that no gases behave 
perfectly ideally, but under conditions of high temperature and low pressure 
(high volume), gases behave more ideally. What if all gases always behaved 
perfectly ideally? How would the world be different?
5.10 Chemistry in the Atmosphere
The most important gases to us are those in the atmosphere that surrounds the earth‚Äôs 
surface. The principal components are N2 and O2, but many other important gases, 
such as H2O and CO2, are also present. The average composition of the earth‚Äôs atmo-
sphere near sea level, with the water vapor removed, is shown in Table 5.4. Because of 
gravitational effects, the composition of the earth‚Äôs atmosphere is not constant; heavier 
molecules tend to be near the earth‚Äôs surface, and light molecules tend to migrate to 
higher altitudes, with some eventually escaping into space. The atmosphere is a highly 
complex and dynamic system, but for convenience we divide it into several layers. 
Fig.¬†5.30 shows how the temperature changes with altitude. 
 
The chemistry occurring in the higher levels of the atmosphere is mostly deter-
mined by the effects of high-energy radiation and particles from the sun and other 
sources in space. In fact, the upper atmosphere serves as an important shield to prevent 
this  high-energy radiation from reaching the earth, where it would damage the rela-
tively fragile molecules sustaining life. In particular, the ozone in the upper atmo-
sphere helps prevent high-energy ultraviolet radiation from penetrating to the earth. 
Intensive research is in progress to determine the natural factors that control the ozone 
concentration and how it is affected by chemicals released into the atmosphere.
 
The chemistry occurring in the troposphere, the layer of atmosphere closest to the 
earth‚Äôs surface, is strongly influenced by human activities. Millions of tons of gases 
and particulates are released into the troposphere by our highly industrial civilization. 
Actually, it is amazing that the atmosphere can absorb so much material with relatively 
small permanent changes (so far).

Significant changes, however, are occurring. Severe air pollution is found around 
many large cities, and it is probable that long-range changes in our planet‚Äôs weather are 
taking place. We will discuss some of the long-range effects of pollution in Chapter 6. 
In this section we will deal with short-term, localized effects of pollution.
 
The two main sources of pollution are transportation and the production of electric-
ity. The combustion of petroleum in vehicles produces CO, CO2, NO, and NO2, along 
with unburned molecules from petroleum. When this mixture is trapped close to the 
ground in stagnant air, reactions occur, producing chemicals that are potentially irritat-
ing and harmful to living systems.
 
The complex chemistry of polluted air appears to center around the nitrogen oxides 
(NOx). At the high temperatures found in the gasoline and diesel engines of cars and 
trucks, N2 and O2 react to form a small quantity of NO that is emitted into the air with the 
exhaust gases (Fig. 5.31). This NO is immediately oxidized in air to NO2, which, in turn, 
absorbs energy from sunlight and breaks up into nitric oxide and free oxygen atoms:
NO21g2  8888n NO1g2 1 O1g2
Oxygen atoms are very reactive and can combine with O2 to form ozone:
O1g2 1 O21g2 h O31g2
Ozone is also very reactive and can react directly with other pollutants, or the ozone 
can absorb light and break up to form an energetically excited O2 molecule (O2*) and 
an  energetically excited oxygen atom (O*). The latter species readily reacts with a 
water molecule to form two hydroxyl radicals (OH):
O* 1 H2O h 2OH
The hydroxyl radical is a very reactive oxidizing agent. For example, OH can react 
with NO2 to form nitric acid:
OH 1 NO2 h HNO3
The OH radical also can react with the unburned hydrocarbons in the polluted air to 
produce chemicals that cause the eyes to water and burn and are harmful to the respira-
tory system.
 
The end product of this whole process is often referred to as photochemical smog, 
so called because light is required to initiate some of the reactions. The production of 
photochemical smog can be understood more clearly by examining as a group the 
reactions discussed above:
  
 NO21g2 h NO1g2 1 O1g2
  
 O1g2 1 O21g2 h O31g2
   NO1g2 1 1
2O21g2 h NO21g2
Net reaction:  
 3
2 O21g2 h O31g2
Note that the NO2 molecules assist in the formation of ozone without being themselves 
used up. The ozone formed then leads to the formation of OH and other pollutants.
 
We can observe this process by analyzing polluted air at various times during a day 
(see Fig. 5.31). As people drive to work between 6 and 8 a.m., the amounts of NO, 
NO2, and unburned molecules from petroleum increase. Later, as the decomposition of 
NO2 occurs, the concentration of ozone and other pollutants builds up. Current efforts 
to combat the formation of photochemical smog are focused on cutting down the 
amounts of molecules from  unburned fuel in automobile exhaust and designing 
engines that produce less nitric oxide.
 
The other major source of pollution results from burning coal to produce electricity. 
Much of the coal found in the Midwest contains significant quantities of sulfur, which, 
when burned, produces sulfur dioxide:
S 1in coal2 1 O21g2 h SO21g2

energy
The OH radical has no charge [it has one 
fewer electron than the hydroxide ion 
(OH2)].
Although represented here as O2, the 
actual oxidant for NO is OH or an organic 
peroxide such as CH3COO, formed by 
oxidation of organic pollutants.

A further oxidation reaction occurs when sulfur dioxide is changed to sulfur trioxide 
in the air:*
2SO21g2 1 O21g2 h 2SO31g2
The production of sulfur trioxide is significant because it can combine with droplets of 
water in the air to form sulfuric acid:
SO31g2 1 H2O1l2 h H2SO41aq2
 
Sulfuric acid is very corrosive to both living things and building materials. Another 
result of this type of pollution is acid rain. In many parts of the northeastern United 
States and southeastern Canada, acid rain has caused some freshwater lakes to become 
too acidic to support any life (Fig. 5.32).
 
The problem of sulfur dioxide pollution is made more complicated by the energy 
crisis. As petroleum supplies dwindle and the price increases, our dependence on coal 
will probably grow. As supplies of low-sulfur coal are used up, high-sulfur coal will be 
utilized. One way to use high-sulfur coal without further harming the air quality is to 
remove the sulfur dioxide from the exhaust gas by means of a system called a scrubber 
before it is emitted from the power plant stack. A common method of scrubbing is to 
blow powdered limestone (CaCO3) into the combustion chamber, where it is decom-
posed to lime and carbon dioxide:
CaCO31s2 h CaO1s2 1 CO21g2
The lime then combines with the sulfur dioxide to form calcium sulfite:
CaO1s2 1 SO21g2 h CaSO31s2
To remove the calcium sulfite and any remaining unreacted sulfur dioxide, an aqueous 
suspension of lime is injected into the exhaust gases to produce a slurry (a thick sus-
pension) (Fig. 5.33).
 
Unfortunately, there are many problems associated with scrubbing. The systems are 
complicated and expensive and consume a great deal of energy. The large quantities of 
calcium sulfite produced in the process present a disposal problem. With a typical 
scrubber, approximately 1 ton of calcium sulfite per year is produced per person served 
by the power plant. Since no use has yet been found for this calcium sulfite, it is usu-
ally buried in a landfill. As a result of these difficulties, air pollution by sulfur dioxide 
continues to be a major problem, one that is expensive in terms of damage to the envi-
ronment and human health as well as in monetary terms.
*This reaction is very slow unless solid particles are present. See Chapter 12 for a discussion.

balloon increases, making the density smaller. This lifts 
the balloon.
b. Hot air rises inside the balloon, and this lifts the balloon.
c. The temperature of a gas is directly related to its pressure. 
The pressure therefore increases, and this lifts the balloon.
d. Some of the gas escapes from the bottom of the balloon, 
thus decreasing the mass of gas in the balloon. This 
decreases the density of the gas in the balloon, which lifts 
the balloon.
e. Temperature is related to the root mean square velocity of 
the gas molecules. Thus the molecules are moving faster, 
hitting the balloon more, and thus lifting the balloon.
Justify your choice, and for the choices you did not pick, 
explain what is wrong with them.
10. Draw a highly magnified view of a sealed, rigid container 
filled with a gas. Then draw what it would look like if you 
cooled the gas significantly but kept the temperature above the 
boiling point of the substance in the container. Also draw what 
it would look like if you heated the gas significantly. Finally, 
draw what each situation would look like if you evacuated 
enough of the gas to decrease the pressure by a factor of 2.
11. If you release a helium balloon, it soars upward and eventually 
pops. Explain this behavior.
12. If you have any two gases in different containers that are the 
same size at the same pressure and same temperature, what is 
true about the moles of each gas? Why is this true?
13. Explain how Boyle‚Äôs law, Charles‚Äôs law, and Avogadro‚Äôs law 
are special cases of the ideal gas law.
14. You have helium gas in a two-bulbed container connected by 
a valve as shown below. Initially the valve is closed. When the 
valve is opened, will the total pressure in the apparatus be less 
than 5.00 atm, equal to 5.00 atm, or greater than 5.00 atm?

container, what happens to the density of the gas? Would the

tainer with a piston at constant pressure? (See Fig. 5.17.)

e. nothing
 6. If you put a drinking straw in water, place your finger over the 
opening, and lift the straw out of the water, some water stays 
in the straw. Explain.
 7. A chemistry student relates the following story: I noticed my 
tires were a bit low and went to the gas station. As I was fill-
ing the tires, I thought about the kinetic molecular theory 
(KMT). I noticed the tires because the volume was low, and I 
realized that I was increasing both the pressure and volume of 
the tires. ‚ÄúHmmm,‚Äù I thought, ‚Äúthat goes against what I 
learned in chemistry, where I was told pressure and volume 
are inversely proportional.‚Äù What is the fault in the logic of 
the chemistry student in this situation? Explain why we think 
pressure and volume to be inversely related (draw pictures 
and use the KMT).

Questions
 22. At room temperature, water is a liquid with a molar volume of 
18 mL. At 1058C and 1 atm pressure, water is a gas and has a 
molar volume of over 30 L. Explain the large difference in 
molar volumes.
 23. If a barometer were built using water (d 5 1.0 g/cm3) instead 
of mercury (d 5 13.6 g/cm3), would the column of water be 
higher than, lower than, or the same as the column of mercury 
at 1.00 atm? If the level is different, by what factor? Explain.
 24. A bag of potato chips is packed and sealed in Los Angeles, 
 California, and then shipped to Lake Tahoe, Nevada, during 
ski season. It is noticed that the volume of the bag of potato 
chips has increased upon its arrival in Lake Tahoe. What exter-
nal conditions would most likely cause the volume increase?

 26. As weather balloons rise from the earth‚Äôs surface, the pressure 
of the atmosphere becomes less, tending to cause the volume 
of the balloons to expand. However, the temperature is much 
lower in the upper atmosphere than at sea level. Would this 
temperature effect tend to make such a balloon expand or con-
tract? Weather balloons do, in fact, expand as they rise. What 
does this tell you?
 27. Which noble gas has the smallest density at STP? Explain.
 28. Consider two different containers, each filled with 2 moles of 
Ne(g). One of the containers is rigid and has constant volume. 
The other container is flexible (like a balloon) and is capable 
of changing its volume to keep the external pressure and inter-
nal pressure equal to each other. If you raise the temperature in 
both containers, what happens to the pressure and density of 
the gas inside each container? Assume a constant external 
pressure.
 29. In Example 5.11 of the text, the molar volume of N2(g) at STP 
is given as 22.42 L/mol N2. How is this number calculated? 
How does the molar volume of He(g) at STP compare to the 
molar volume of N2(g) at STP (assuming ideal gas behavior)? 
Is the molar volume of N2(g) at 1.000 atm and 25.0¬∞C equal 
to, less than, or greater than 22.42 L/mol? Explain. Is the 
molar volume of N2(g) collected over water at a total pressure 
of 1.000 atm and 0.0¬∞C equal to, less than, or greater than 
22.42¬†L/mol? Explain.
 30. You are holding two balloons of equal volume; one contains 
argon and the other contains neon. What is the approximate 
mass ratio between Ar and Ne in the two balloons?
 15. Explain the following seeming contradiction: You have two 
gases, A and B, in two separate containers of equal volume and 
at equal pressure and temperature. Therefore, you must have 
the same number of moles of each gas. Because the two tem-
peratures are equal, the average kinetic energies of the two 
samples are equal. Therefore, since the energy given such a 
system will be converted to translational motion (that is, move 
the molecules), the root mean square velocities of the two are 
equal, and thus the particles in each sample move, on average, 
with the same relative speed. Since A and B are different gases, 
they each must have a different molar mass. If A has a higher 
molar mass than B, the particles of A must be hitting the sides 
of the container with more force. Thus the pressure in the con-
tainer of gas A must be higher than that in the container with 
gas B. However, one of our initial assumptions was that the 
pressures were equal.
 16. You have a balloon covering the mouth of a flask filled with air 
at 1 atm. You apply heat to the bottom of the flask until the 
volume of the balloon is equal to that of the flask.
a. Which has more air in it, the balloon or the flask? Or do 
both have the same amount? Explain.
b. In which is the pressure greater, the balloon or the flask? 
Or is the pressure the same? Explain.
 17. How does Dalton‚Äôs law of partial pressures help us with our 
model of ideal gases? That is, what postulates of the kinetic 
mo lecular theory does it support?
 18. At the same conditions of pressure and temperature, ammonia 
gas is less dense than air. Why is this true?
 19. For each of the quantities listed below, explain which of the 
following properties (mass of the molecule, density of the gas 
sample, temperature of the gas sample, size of the molecule, 
and number of moles of gas) must be known to calculate the 
quantity.

container

pare  between the two containers.

tainer walls

at constant pressure and temperature, the volume of the prod-
uct gases collected is twice the volume of NH3 reacted. 
Explain. As NH3(g) is decomposed into nitrogen gas and 
hydrogen gas at constant volume and temperature, the total 
pressure increases by some factor. Why the increase in pres-
sure and by what factor does the total pressure increase when 
reactants are completely converted into products? How do the 
partial pressures of the product gases compare to each other 
and to the initial pressure of NH3?
 36. Which of the following statements is(are) true? For the false 
statements, correct them.
a. At constant temperature, the lighter the gas molecules, the 
faster the average velocity of the gas molecules.
b. At constant temperature, the heavier the gas molecules, 
the larger the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules.
c. A real gas behaves most ideally when the container vol-
ume is relatively large and the gas molecules are moving 
relatively quickly.
d. As temperature increases, the effect of interparticle inter-
actions on gas behavior is increased.
e. At constant V and T, as gas molecules are added into a 
container, the number of collisions per unit area increases 
resulting in a higher pressure.

inversely proportional to temperature at constant volume 
and moles of gas.

 146. One of the chemical controversies of the nineteenth century 
concerned the element beryllium (Be). Berzelius originally 
claimed that beryllium was a trivalent element (forming Be31

resulted in a calculated atomic mass of 13.5 for beryllium. In 
formulating his periodic table, Mendeleev proposed that 
beryllium was divalent (forming Be21 ions) and that it gave an 
oxide with the formula BeO. This assumption gives an atomic 
mass of 9.0. In 1894, A. Combes (Comptes Rendus 1894,  
p. 1221) reacted beryllium with the anion C5H7O22 and mea-
sured the density of the gaseous product. Combes‚Äôs data for

product will be Be(C5H7O2)2; if it is trivalent, the formula will 
be Be(C5H7O2)3. Show how Combes‚Äôs data help to confirm 
that beryllium is a divalent metal.

produced 31.8 mL N2 saturated with water vapor at 258C and

E
nergy is the essence of our very existence as individuals and as a society. The 
food that we eat furnishes the energy to live, work, and play, just as the coal and 
oil consumed by manufacturing and transportation systems power our modern indus-
trialized civilization.
In the past, huge quantities of carbon-based fossil fuels have been available for the 
taking. This abundance of fuels has led to a world society with a voracious appetite for 
energy, consuming millions of barrels of petroleum every day. We are now danger-
ously dependent on the dwindling supplies of oil, and this dependence is an important 
source of tension among nations in today‚Äôs world. In an incredibly short time, we have 
moved from a period of ample and cheap supplies of petroleum to one of high prices 
and uncertain supplies. If our present standard of living is to be maintained, we must 
find alternatives to petroleum. To do this, we need to know the relationship between 
chemistry and energy, which we explore in this chapter.
There are additional problems with fossil fuels. The waste products from burning 
fossil fuels significantly affect our environment. For example, when a carbon-based 
fuel is burned, the carbon reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, which is 
released into the atmosphere. Although much of this carbon dioxide is consumed in 
various natural processes such as photosynthesis and the formation of carbonate 
materials, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is steadily increasing. 
This increase is significant because atmospheric carbon dioxide absorbs heat radi-
ated from the earth‚Äôs surface and radiates it back toward the earth. Since this is an 
important mechanism for controlling the earth‚Äôs temperature, many scientists fear 
that an increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide will warm the earth, causing 
significant changes in climate. In addition, impurities in the fossil fuels react with 
components of the air to produce air pollution. We discussed some aspects of this 
problem in Chapter 5.
Just as energy is important to our society on a macroscopic scale, it is critically 
 important to each living organism on a microscopic scale. The living cell is a miniature 
chemical factory powered by energy from chemical reactions. The process of cellular 
respiration extracts the energy stored in sugars and other nutrients to drive the various 
tasks of the cell. Although the extraction process is more complex and more subtle, the 
energy obtained from ‚Äúfuel‚Äù molecules by the cell is the same as would be obtained 
from burning the fuel to power an internal combustion engine.
Whether it is an engine or a cell that is converting energy from one form to 
another, the processes are all governed by the same principles, which we will begin 
to explore in this chapter. Additional aspects of energy transformation will be cov-
ered in Chapter 17.
6.1 The Nature of Energy
Although the concept of energy is quite familiar, energy itself is rather difficult to 
define precisely. We will define energy as the capacity to do work or to produce heat. 
In this chapter we will concentrate specifically on the heat transfer that accompanies 
chemical processes.
 
One of the most important characteristics of energy is that it is conserved. The law 
of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted from one form to  
another but can be neither created nor destroyed. That is, the energy of the universe  
is constant. Energy can be classified as either potential or kinetic energy. Potential 
energy is energy due to position or composition. For example, water behind a dam has 
potential energy that can be converted to work when the water flows down through 
turbines, thereby creating electricity. Attractive and repulsive forces also lead to poten-
tial energy. The energy released when gasoline is burned results from differences in 
attractive forces between the nuclei and electrons in the reactants and products. The 
kinetic energy of an object is  energy due to the motion of the object and depends on 
the mass of the object m and its velocity v: KE 5 1
2mv2.

Energy can be converted from one form to another. For example, consider the two 
balls in Fig. 6.1(a). Ball A, because of its higher position initially, has more potential 
energy than ball B. When A is released, it moves down the hill and strikes B. Eventu-
ally, the arrangement shown in Fig. 6.1(b) is achieved. What has happened in going 
from the initial to the final arrangement? The potential energy of A has decreased, but 
since energy is conserved, all the energy lost by A must be accounted for. How is this 
energy distributed?
 
Initially, the potential energy of A is changed to kinetic energy as the ball rolls 
down the hill. Part of this kinetic energy is then transferred to B, causing it to be raised 
to a higher final position. Thus the potential energy of B has been increased. However, 
since the final position of B is lower than the original position of A, some of the energy 
is still unaccounted for. Both balls in their final positions are at rest, so the missing 
energy cannot be due to their motions. What has happened to the remaining energy?
 
The answer lies in the interaction between the hill‚Äôs surface and the ball. As ball A 
rolls down the hill, some of its kinetic energy is transferred to the surface of the hill as 
heat. This transfer of energy is called frictional heating. The temperature of the hill 
increases very slightly as the ball rolls down.
 
Before we proceed further, it is important to recognize that heat and temperature are 
decidedly different. As we saw in Chapter 5, temperature is a property that reflects the 
random motions of the particles in a particular substance. Heat, on the other hand, 
involves the transfer of energy between two objects due to a temperature difference. 
Heat is not a substance contained by an object, although we often talk of heat as if this 
were true. We will discuss the concept of heat in more detail shortly.
 
Note that in going from the initial to the final arrangements in Fig. 6.1, ball B gains 
potential energy because work was done by ball A on B. Work is defined as force act-
ing over a distance. Work is required to raise B from its original position to its final 
one. Part of the original energy stored as potential energy in A has been transferred 
through work to B, thereby increasing B‚Äôs potential energy. Thus there are two ways to 
transfer energy: through work and through heat.
 
In rolling to the bottom of the hill shown in Fig. 6.1, ball A will always lose the 
same amount of potential energy. However, the way that this energy transfer is divided 
between work and heat depends on the specific conditions‚Äîthe pathway. For exam-
ple, the surface of the hill might be so rough that the energy of A is expended com-
pletely through frictional heating; A is moving so slowly when it hits B that it cannot 
move B to the next level. In this case, no work is done. Regardless of the condition of 
the hill‚Äôs surface, the total energy transferred will be constant. However, the amounts 
of heat and work will  differ. Energy change is independent of the pathway; however, 
work and heat are both  dependent on the pathway.
 
This brings us to a very important concept: the state function or state property. A 
state function refers to a property of the system that depends only on its present state. 
A state function (property) does not depend in any way on the system‚Äôs past (or future). 
In other words, the value of a state function does not depend on how the system arrived 
at the present state; it depends only on the characteristics of the present state. This 
leads to a very important characteristic of a state function: A change in this function 
(property) in going from one state to another state is independent of the particular 
pathway taken between the two states.
 
A nonscientific analogy that illustrates the difference between a state function and 
a nonstate function is elevation on the earth‚Äôs surface and distance between two points. 
In traveling from Chicago (elevation 674 ft) to Denver (elevation 5280 ft), the change 
in elevation is always 5280 2 674 5 4606 ft regardless of the route taken between the 
two cities. The distance traveled, however, depends on how you make the trip. Thus 
elevation is a function that does not depend on the route (pathway), but distance is 
pathway dependent. Elevation is a state function and distance is not.
 
Of the functions considered in our present example, energy is a state function, but 
work and heat are not state functions.
Heat involves a transfer of energy.
Energy is a state function; work and heat 
are not.

The Process of Heat
We have defined heat as a transfer of energy between two objects due to a temperature 
difference. Experience shows that when two objects at different temperatures are in 
contact, they will eventually reach the same intermediate temperature. For example, 
suppose you and a friend are each enjoying a beverage. You are drinking a cold glass 
of lemonade while your friend has a hot cup of tea. If you allow the drinks to sit for a 
long enough period of time, the temperature of the tea will decrease and the tempera-
ture of the lemonade will increase. Eventually the temperatures of tea and the lemon-
ade will be the same as room temperature. Energy is transferred in the form of heat 
from the hot tea to the surroundings (air in the room) and from the surroundings to the 
cold lemonade. Thus, we see that energy is always transferred from the ‚Äúhot body‚Äù to 
the ‚Äúcold body.‚Äù How does this process occur?
 
To answer this, let‚Äôs consider a relatively simple system‚Äîtwo samples of gases, 
each at a different temperature and in contact as shown below. The wall separating the 
two samples is a thin membrane.
 
Recall from Chapter 5 that temperature is a measure of the kinetic energy of a 
sample of gas. That is, temperature is an index of the random motions of the particles 
of the gas. A higher temperature means that the gas has a greater average kinetic 
energy, which gives rise to a higher average velocity of the gas particles.
 
The gas particles in the left side of the container are at a higher temperature and thus 
moving at a greater average velocity than the particles in the right side (velocity is rep-
resented by the ‚Äútails‚Äù on the particles in Fig. 6.2). Consider what happens when a 
particle in the left side (‚Äúhot‚Äù) collides with the membrane at the same time and on the 
exact opposite side as a particle on the right side (‚Äúcold‚Äù). Energy will be transferred 
from the faster-moving particle on the left side to the slower-moving particle on the 
right side. The particle with the higher initial velocity will slow down, while the particle 
with the lower initial velocity will speed up. As this process continues, the average 
kinetic energy on the left side will decrease and the average kinetic energy on the right 
side will increase. Eventually, the average kinetic energy on each side will be equal, and 
the temperature of the gas samples will be the same. When this happens, the particles 
will still be in motion, but they will be moving with the same average velocity.
 
Although this is perhaps easier to visualize with gas particles striking a shared wall, 
a similar process occurs with solids and liquids. Atoms and molecules are always in 
constant motion (even if that motion is merely vibrating such as in a solid lattice). 
Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in solids and liq-
uids as well as in gases. For any ‚Äúhot body‚Äù in thermal contact with a ‚Äúcold body,‚Äù 
energy is transferred as the initially faster particles decrease in motion and the initially 
slower molecules increase in motion. Therefore, the samples will eventually reach 
thermal equilibrium. That is, the particles will have the same average kinetic energy 
and thus the same temperature.

temperatures in adjoining chambers.

Chemical Energy
The ideas we have illustrated using mechanical examples also apply to chemical sys-
tems. The combustion of methane, for example, is used to heat many homes in the 
United States:
CH41g2 1 2O21g2 h CO21g2 1 2H2O1g2 1 energy 1heat2
To discuss this reaction, we divide the universe into two parts: the system and the sur-
roundings. The system is the part of the universe on which we wish to focus attention; 
the surroundings include everything else in the universe. In this case we define the 
system as the reactants and products of the reaction. The surroundings consist of 
the¬†reaction container (a furnace, for example), the room, and anything else other than 
the reactants and products.
 
When a reaction results in the evolution of heat, it is said to be exothermic (exo- is 
a prefix meaning ‚Äúout of‚Äù); that is, energy flows out of the system. For example, in the 
combustion of methane, energy flows out of the system as heat. Reactions that absorb 
energy from the surroundings are said to be endothermic. When the heat flow is into 
a system, the process is endothermic. For example, the formation of nitric oxide from 
nitrogen and oxygen is endothermic:
N21g2 1 O21g2 1 energy 1heat2 h 2NO1g2
 
Where does the energy, released as heat, come from in an exothermic reaction? The 
answer lies in the difference in potential energies between the products and the reac-
tants. Which has lower potential energy, the reactants or the products? We know that 
total energy is conserved and that energy flows from the system into the surroundings 
in an exothermic reaction. This means that the energy gained by the surroundings must 
be equal to the energy lost by the system. In the combustion of methane, the energy 
content of the system decreases, which means that 1 mole of CO2 and 2 moles of 
H2O¬†molecules (the products) possess less potential energy than do 1 mole of CH4 and 
2¬†moles of O2 molecules (the reactants). The heat flow into the surroundings results 
from a lowering of the potential energy of the reaction system. This always holds true. 
In any exothermic reaction, some of the potential energy stored in the chemical bonds 
is being converted to thermal  energy (random kinetic energy) via heat.
 
The energy diagram for the combustion of methane is shown in Fig. 6.3, where 
D(PE) represents the change in potential energy stored in the bonds of the products as 
compared with the bonds of the reactants. In other words, this quantity represents the 
difference between the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants and the 
energy released when the bonds in the products are formed. In an exothermic process, 
the bonds in the products are stronger (on average) than those of the reactants. That is, 
more energy is released by forming the new bonds in the products than is consumed to

break the bonds in the reactants. The net result is that the quantity of energy D(PE) is 
transferred to the surroundings through heat.
 
For an endothermic reaction, the situation is reversed, as shown in Fig. 6.4. Energy 
that flows into the system as heat is used to increase the potential energy of the system. 
In this case the products have higher potential energy (weaker bonds on average) than 
the reactants.
 
The study of energy and its interconversions is called thermodynamics. The law of 
conservation of energy is often called the first law of thermodynamics and is stated 
as follows: The energy of the universe is constant.
 
The internal energy E of a system can be defined most precisely as the sum of the 
kinetic and potential energies of all the ‚Äúparticles‚Äù in the system. The internal energy 
of a system can be changed by a flow of work, heat, or both. That is,
DE 5 q 1 w
where DE represents the change in the system‚Äôs internal energy, q represents heat, and 
w represents work.
 
Thermodynamic quantities always consist of two parts: a number, giving the mag-
nitude of the change, and a sign, indicating the direction of the flow. The sign reflects 
the system‚Äôs point of view. For example, if a quantity of energy flows into the system 
via heat (an endothermic process), q is equal to 1x, where the positive sign indicates 
that the system‚Äôs energy is increasing. On the other hand, when energy flows out of the 
system via heat (an exothermic process), q is equal to 2x, where the negative sign 
indicates that the system‚Äôs energy is decreasing.
 
In this text the same conventions also apply to the flow of work. If the system does 
work on the surroundings (energy flows out of the system), w is negative. If the sur-
roundings do work on the system (energy flows into the system), w is positive. We 
define work from the system‚Äôs point of view to be consistent for all thermodynamic 
quantities. That is, in this convention the signs of both q and w reflect what happens to 
the system; thus we use DE 5 q 1 w.

In this text we always take the system‚Äôs point of view. This convention is not followed 
in every area of science. For example, engineers are in the business of designing machines 
to do work, that is, to make the system (the machine) transfer energy to its surroundings 
through work. Consequently, engineers define work from the surroundings‚Äô point of 
view. In their convention, work that flows out of the system is treated as positive because 
the energy of the surroundings has increased. The first law of thermodynamics is then 
written DE 5 q 2 w9, where w9 signifies work from the surroundings‚Äô point of view.
Internal Energy
Calculate DE for a system undergoing an endothermic process in which 15.6 kJ of heat 
flows and where 1.4 kJ of work is done on the system.
SOLUTION
We use the equation
DE 5 q 1 w
where q 5 115.6 kJ, since the process is endothermic, and w 5 11.4 kJ, since work 
is done on the system. Thus
DE 5 15.6 kJ 1 1.4 kJ 5 17.0 kJ
‚ñ† The system has gained 17.0 kJ of energy.
See Exercises 6.33 through 6.35
A common type of work associated with chemical processes is work done by a gas 
(through expansion) or work done to a gas (through compression). For example, in an 
automobile engine, the heat from the combustion of the gasoline expands the gases in 
the cylinder to push back the piston, and this motion is then translated into the motion 
of the car.
Suppose we have a gas confined to a cylindrical container with a movable piston as 
shown in Fig. 6.5, where F is the force acting on a piston of area A. Since pressure is 
defined as force per unit area, the pressure of the gas is
P 5 F
A
Work is defined as force applied over a distance, so if the piston moves a distance 
Dh, as shown in Fig. 6.5, then the work done is
Work 5 force 3 distance 5 F 3 Dh
Since P 5 FyA or F 5 P 3 A, then
Work 5 F 3 Dh 5 P 3 A 3 Dh
Since the volume of a cylinder equals the area of the piston times the height of the 
cylinder (see Fig. 6.5), the change in volume DV resulting from the piston moving a 
distance Dh is
DV 5 final volume 2 initial volume 5 A 3 Dh
Substituting DV 5 A 3 Dh into the expression for work gives
Work 5 P 3 A 3 Dh 5 PDV
This gives us the magnitude (size) of the work required to expand a gas DV against a 
pressure P.
What about the sign of the work? The gas (the system) is expanding, moving the 
piston against the pressure. Thus the system is doing work on the surroundings, so 
from the system‚Äôs point of view the sign of the work should be negative.
The convention in this text is to take the 
system‚Äôs point of view; q 5 2x denotes an 
exothermic process, and q 5 1x denotes 
an endothermic one.

For an expanding gas, DV is a positive quantity because the volume is increasing. 
Thus DV and w must have opposite signs, which leads to the equation
w 5 2PDV
Note that for a gas expanding against an external pressure P, w is a negative quantity 
as required, since work flows out of the system. When a gas is compressed, DV is a 
negative quantity (the volume decreases), which makes w a positive quantity (work 
flows into the system).
CRITICAL THINKING You are calculating DE in a chemistry 
problem. What if you confuse the system and the surroundings? How would this 
affect the magnitude of the answer you calculate? The sign?
PV Work
Calculate the work associated with the expansion of a gas from 46 L to 64 L at a con-
stant external pressure of 15 atm.
 
SOLUTION 
For a gas at constant pressure,
w 5 2PDV
In this case P 5 15 atm and DV 5 64 2 46 5 18 L. Hence
‚ñ† w 5 215 atm 3 18 L 5 2270 L # atm
Note that since the gas expands, it does work on its surroundings.
Reality Check Energy flows out of the gas, so w is a negative quantity.
See Exercises 6.39 through 6.41
 
In dealing with ‚ÄúPV work,‚Äù keep in mind that the P in PDV always refers to the exter-
nal pressure‚Äîthe pressure that causes a compression or that resists an expansion.
Internal Energy, Heat, and Work
A balloon is being inflated to its full extent by heating the air inside it. In the final 
stages of this process, the volume of the balloon changes from 4.00 3 106 L to 
4.50 3 106 L by the addition of 1.3 3 108 J of energy as heat. Assuming that the bal-
loon expands against a constant pressure of 1.0 atm, calculate DE for the process. (To 
convert between L ? atm and J, use 1 L ? atm 5 101.3 J.)
 
SOLUTION 
Where are we going?
To calculate DE
What do we know?
‚ùØ V1 5 4.00 3 106 L
‚ùØ q 5 11.3 3 108 J
‚ùØ P 5 1.0 atm
‚ùØ 1 L # atm 5 101.3 J
‚ùØ V2 5 4.50 3 106 L
w and PDV have opposite signs because 
when the gas expands (DV is positive), 
work flows into the surroundings (w is 
negative).
INTERACTIVE EXAMPLE 6.2
For an ideal gas, work can occur only when 
its volume changes. Thus, if a gas is heated 
at constant volume, the  pressure increases 
but no work occurs.

The negative sign makes sense because the gas is expanding and doing work on the 
surroundings. To calculate DE, we must sum q and w. However, since q is given in 
units of J and w is given in units of L ? atm, we must change the work to units of joules:
w 5 25.0 3 105 L # atm 3 101.3 J
L # atm 5 25.1 3 107 J
Then
‚ñ† DE 5 q 1 w 5 111.3 3 108 J2 1 125.1 3 107 J2 5 8 3 107 J
Reality Check Since more energy is added through heating than the gas expends doing 
work, there is a net increase in the internal energy of the gas in the balloon. Hence DE 
is positive.
See Exercises 6.42 through 6.44
6.2 Enthalpy and Calorimetry
Enthalpy
So far we have discussed the internal energy of a system. A less familiar property of a 
system is its enthalpy H, which is defined as
H 5 E 1 PV
where E is the internal energy of the system, P is the pressure of the system, and V is 
the volume of the system.
Since internal energy, pressure, and volume are all state functions, enthalpy is also 
a state function. But what exactly is enthalpy? To help answer this question, consider 
a process carried out at constant pressure and where the only work allowed is pressure‚Äì
volume work (w 5 2PDV). Under these conditions, the expression
DE 5 qP 1 w
becomes
DE 5 qP 2 PDV
or
qP 5 DE 1 PDV
where qP is the heat at constant pressure.
6.2
Enthalpy is a state function. A change in 
enthalpy does not depend on the pathway 
between two states.
Recall from the previous section that w and 
PDV have opposite signs:
w 5 2PDV

We will now relate qP to a change in enthalpy. The definition of enthalpy is  
H 5 E 1 PV. Therefore, we can say
Change in H 5 1change in E2 1 1change in PV2
or
DH 5 DE 1 D1PV2
Since P is constant, the change in PV is due only to a change in volume. Thus
D1PV2 5 PDV
and
DH 5 DE 1 PDV
This expression is identical to the one we obtained for qP:
qP 5 DE 1 PDV
Thus, for a process carried out at constant pressure and where the only work allowed 
is that from a volume change, we have
DH 5 qP
At constant pressure (where only PV work is allowed), the change in enthalpy DH of 
the system is equal to the energy flow as heat. This means that for a reaction studied at 
constant pressure, the flow of heat is a measure of the change in enthalpy for the sys-
tem. For this reason, the terms heat of reaction and change in enthalpy are used inter-
changeably for reactions studied at constant pressure.
 
For a chemical reaction, the enthalpy change is given by the equation
DH 5 Hproducts 2 Hreactants
 
In a case in which the products of a reaction have a greater enthalpy than the reac-
tants, DH will be positive. Thus heat will be absorbed by the system, and the reaction 
is endothermic. On the other hand, if the enthalpy of the products is less than that of 
the  reactants, DH will be negative. In this case the overall decrease in enthalpy is 
achieved by the generation of heat, and the reaction is exothermic.
Enthalpy
When 1 mole of methane (CH4) is burned at constant pressure, 890 kJ of energy is 
released as heat. Calculate DH for a process in which a 5.8-g sample of methane is 
burned at constant pressure.

Where are we going?
To calculate DH
What do we know?
‚ùØ qP 5 DH 5 2890 kJ/mol CH4
‚ùØ Mass 5 5.8 g CH4
‚ùØ Molar mass CH4 5 16.04 g
How do we get there?
What are the moles of CH4 burned?
5.8 g CH4 3 1 mol CH4
16.04 g CH4
5 0.36 mol CH4
DH 5 q only at constant pressure.
The change in enthalpy of a system has 
no easily interpreted meaning except at 
constant pressure, where DH 5 heat.
At constant pressure, exothermic means 
DH is negative; endothermic means DH is 
positive.

Thus, when a 5.8-g sample of CH4 is burned at constant pressure,

Reality Check In this case, a 5.8-g sample of CH4 is burned. Since this amount is 
smaller than 1 mole, less than 890 kJ will be released as heat.
See Exercises 6.49 through 6.52
Calorimetry
The device used experimentally to determine the heat associated with a chemical reac-
tion is called a calorimeter. Calorimetry, the science of measuring heat, is based on 
observing the temperature change when a body absorbs or discharges energy as heat. 
Substances respond differently to being heated. One substance might require a great 
deal of heat energy to raise its temperature by one degree, whereas another will exhibit 
the same temperature change after absorbing relatively little heat. The heat capacity 
C of a substance, which is a measure of this property, is defined as
C 5
heat absorbed
increase in temperature
 
When an element or a compound is heated, the energy required will depend on the 
amount of the substance present (for example, it takes twice as much energy to raise the 
temperature of 2 g of water by one degree than it takes to raise the temperature of 1 g of 
water by one degree). Thus, in defining the heat capacity of a substance, the amount of 
substance must be specified. If the heat capacity is given per gram of substance, it is 
called the specific heat capacity, and its units are J/8C ? g or J/K ? g. If the heat capacity 
is given per mole of the substance, it is called the molar heat capacity, and it has the 
units J/8C ? mol or J/K ? mol. The specific heat capacities of some common substances 
are given in Table 6.1. Note from this table that the heat capacities of metals are very 
different from that of water. It takes much less energy to change the temperature of a 
gram of a metal by 18C than for a gram of water.
 
Although the calorimeters used for highly accurate work are precision instruments, 
a very simple calorimeter can be used to examine the fundamentals of calorimetry. All 
we need are two nested Styrofoam cups with a cover through which a stirrer and ther-
mometer can be inserted (Fig. 6.6). This device is called a ‚Äúcoffee-cup calorimeter.‚Äù 
The outer cup is used to provide extra insulation. The inner cup holds the solution in 
which the reaction occurs.
 
The measurement of heat using a simple calorimeter such as that shown in Fig. 6.6 is 
an example of constant-pressure calorimetry, since the pressure (atmospheric pressure) 
remains constant during the process. Constant-pressure calorimetry is used in  determining 
the changes in enthalpy (heats of reactions) for reactions occurring in solution. Recall that 
under these conditions, the change in enthalpy equals the heat; that is, DH 5 qP .
 
For example, suppose we mix 50.0 mL of 1.0 M HCl at 25.08C with 50.0 mL of 1.0 M 
NaOH also at 258C in a calorimeter. After the reactants are mixed by stirring, the tempera-
ture is observed to increase to 31.98C. As we saw in Section 4.8, the net ionic equation for 
this reaction is
H1 1aq2 1 OH2 1aq2 h H2O1l2
 
When these reactants (each originally at the same temperature) are mixed, the tem-
perature of the mixed solution is observed to increase. Therefore, the chemical

required to raise the temperature of one

reaction must be releasing energy as heat. This released energy increases the random 
motions of the solution components, which in turn increases the temperature. The 
quantity of energy released can be determined from the temperature increase, the mass 
of solution, and the specific heat capacity of the solution. For an approximate result, 
we will assume that the calorimeter does not absorb or leak any heat and that the solu-
tion can be treated as if it were pure water with a density of 1.0 g/mL.
We also need to know the heat required to raise the temperature of a given amount 
of water by 18C. Table 6.1 lists the specific heat capacity of water as 4.18 J/8C ? g. This 
means that 4.18 J of energy is required to raise the temperature of 1 g of water by 18C.
From these assumptions and definitions, we can calculate the heat (change in 
enthalpy) for the neutralization reaction:
Energy 1as heat2 released by the reaction
 5 energy 1as heat2 absorbed by the solution
 5 specific heat capacity 3 mass of solution 3 increase in temperature
 5 s 3 m 3 DT
If two reactants at the same temperature 
are mixed and the resulting solution gets 
warmer, this means the reaction taking 
place is exothermic. An endothermic  
reaction cools the solution.
T
he voodoo lily is a beautiful,  
seductive‚Äîand foul-smelling‚Äî
plant. The exotic-looking lily features an 
elaborate reproductive mechanism‚Äî 
a purple spike that can reach nearly  
3 feet in length and is cloaked by a 
hoodlike leaf. But approach to the plant 
reveals bad news‚Äîit smells terrible!
Despite its antisocial odor, this putrid 
plant has fascinated biologists for many 
years because of its ability to generate 
heat. At the peak of its metabolic activ-
ity, the plant‚Äôs blossom can be as much 
as 158C above its ambient temperature. 
To generate this much heat, the meta-
bolic rate of the plant must be close to 
that of a flying hummingbird!
What‚Äôs the purpose of this intense 
heat production? For a plant faced with 
limited food supplies in the very com-
petitive tropical climate where it grows, 
heat production seems like a great waste 
of energy. The answer to this mystery is 
that the voodoo lily is pollinated mainly 
by carrion-loving insects. Thus the lily 
prepares a malodorous mixture of chem-
icals characteristic of rotting meat, which 
it then ‚Äúcooks‚Äù off into the surrounding 
air to attract flesh-feeding beetles and 
flies. Then, once the insects enter the 
pollination chamber, the high tempera-
tures there (as high as 1108F) cause the 
insects to remain very active to better 
carry out their pollination duties.
The voodoo lily is only one of many 
such thermogenic (heat-producing) 
plants. Another interesting example is 
the eastern skunk cabbage, which 
produces enough heat to bloom inside 
of a snow bank by creating its own ice 
caves. These plants are of special inter-
est to biologists because they provide 
opportunities to study metabolic reac-
tions that are quite subtle in ‚Äúnormal‚Äù 
plants. For example, recent studies 
have shown that salicylic acid, the 
active form of aspirin, is probably very 
important in producing the metabolic 
bursts in thermogenic plants.
Besides studying the dramatic heat 
effects in thermogenic plants, biologists 
are also interested in calorimetric studies 
of regular plants. For example, very 
precise calorimeters have been designed 
that can be used to study the heat pro-
duced, and thus the metabolic activities, 
of clumps of cells no larger than a bread 
crumb. Several scientists have suggested 
that a single calorimetric measurement 
taking just a few minutes on a tiny plant 
might be useful in predicting the growth 
rate of the mature plant throughout its 
lifetime. If true, this would provide a very 
efficient method for selecting the plants 
most likely to thrive as adults.
Because the study of the heat pro-
duction by plants is an excellent way to 
learn about plant metabolism, this 
continues to be a ‚Äúhot‚Äù area of research.

How much energy would have been released if twice these amounts of solutions had 
been mixed? The answer is that twice as much heat would have been produced. The heat 
of a reaction is an extensive property; it depends directly on the amount of substance, in 
this case on the amounts of reactants. In contrast, an intensive property is not related to 
the amount of a substance. For example, temperature is an intensive property.
 
Enthalpies of reaction are often expressed in terms of moles of reacting substances.

5.0 3 1022 mol H1 5 5.8 3 104 J/mol

enthalpy change per mole for the reaction
H1 1aq2 1 OH2 1aq2 h H2O1l2
is 58 kJ/mol. Since heat is evolved, DH 5 258 kJ/mol.
 
To summarize, we have found that when an object changes temperature, the heat 
can be calculated from the equation
q 5 s 3 m 3 DT
where s is the specific heat capacity, m is the mass, and DT is the change in tempera-
ture. Note that when DT is positive, q also has a positive sign. The object has absorbed 
heat, so its temperature increases.

perature of the mixture increases to 28.18C. Assuming that the calorimeter absorbs only 
a negligible quantity of heat, the specific heat capacity of the solution is 4.18 J/8C ? g, 
and the density of the final solution is 1.0 g/mL, calculate the enthalpy change per mole 
of BaSO4 formed.

The ions present before any reaction occurs are Ba21, NO32, Na1, and SO422. The Na1

Since 1.0 L of 1.0 M Ba(NO3)2 contains 1 mole of Ba21 ions and 1.0 L of 1.0 M 
Na2SO4  contains 1.0 mole of SO422 ions, 1.0 mole of solid BaSO4 is formed in this

Constant-volume calorimetry experiments can also be performed. For example, 
when a photographic flashbulb flashes, the bulb becomes very hot, because the reac-
tion of the zirconium or magnesium wire with the oxygen inside the bulb is exother-
mic. The reaction occurs inside the flashbulb, which is rigid and does not change 
volume. Under these conditions, no work is done (because the volume must change for 
pressure‚Äìvolume work to be performed). To study the energy changes in reactions 
under conditions of constant volume, a ‚Äúbomb calorimeter‚Äù (Fig. 6.7) is used. Weighed 
reactants are placed inside a rigid steel container (the ‚Äúbomb‚Äù) and ignited. The energy 
change is determined by measuring the increase in the temperature of the water and 
other calorimeter parts. For a constant-volume process, the change in volume DV is 
equal to zero, so work (which is 2PDV) is also equal to zero. Therefore,

Suppose we wish to measure the energy of combustion of octane (C8H18), a compo-
nent of gasoline. A 0.5269-g sample of octane is placed in a bomb calorimeter known 
to have a heat capacity of 11.3 kJ/8C. This means that 11.3 kJ of energy is required to

raise the temperature of the water and other parts of the calorimeter by 18C. The octane 
is  ignited in the presence of excess oxygen, and the temperature increase of the calo-
rimeter is 2.258C. The amount of energy released is calculated as follows:

The number of moles of octane is

114.2 g octane 5 4.614 3 1023 mol octane

released per mole is

6.3 Hess‚Äôs Law
Since enthalpy is a state function, the change in enthalpy in going from some initial 
state to some final state is independent of the pathway. This means that in going from 
a particular set of reactants to a particular set of products, the change in enthalpy is 
the same whether the reaction takes place in one step or in a series of steps. This prin-
ciple is known as Hess‚Äôs law and can be illustrated by examining the oxidation of 
nitrogen to produce nitrogen dioxide. The overall reaction can be written in one step, 
where the enthalpy change is represented by DH1.

This reaction also can be carried out in two distinct steps, with enthalpy changes des-
ignated by DH2 and DH3:

The principle of Hess‚Äôs law is shown schematically in Fig. 6.8.
Characteristics of Enthalpy Changes
To use Hess‚Äôs law to compute enthalpy changes for reactions, it is important to under-
stand two characteristics of DH for a reaction:
Characteristics of DH for a Reaction
 ¬ª If a reaction is reversed, the sign of DH is also reversed.
 ¬ª The magnitude of DH is directly proportional to the quantities of reactants and products in 
a reaction. If the coefficients in a balanced reaction are multiplied by an integer, the value 
of DH is multiplied by the same integer.
Both these rules follow in a straightforward way from the properties of enthalpy 
changes. The first rule can be explained by recalling that the sign of DH indicates the 
direction of the heat flow at constant pressure. If the direction of the reaction is reversed, 
the direction of the heat flow also will be reversed. To see this, consider the preparation 
of xenon tetrafluoride, which was the first binary compound made from a noble gas:
Xe1g2 1 2F21g2 h XeF41s2¬†¬†¬†¬†DH 5 2251 kJ
This reaction is exothermic, and 251 kJ of energy flows into the surroundings as heat. 
On the other hand, if the colorless XeF4 crystals are decomposed into the elements, 
according to the equation
XeF41s2 h Xe1g2 1 2F21g2
Reversing the direction of a reaction 
changes the sign of DH.

the opposite energy flow occurs because 251 kJ of energy must be added to the system 
to produce this endothermic reaction. Thus, for this reaction, DH 5 1251 kJ.
 
The second rule comes from the fact that DH is an extensive property, depending on 
the amount of substances reacting. For example, since 251 kJ of energy is evolved for 
the reaction
Xe1g2 1 2F21g2 h XeF41s2
then for a preparation involving twice the quantities of reactants and products, or
2Xe1g2 1 4F21g2 h 2XeF41s2
twice as much heat would be evolved:
DH 5 212251 kJ2 5 2502 kJ
CRITICAL THINKING What if Hess‚Äôs law were not true? What are 
some possible repercussions this would have?

Two forms of carbon are graphite, the soft, black, slippery material used in ‚Äúlead‚Äù 
pencils and as a lubricant for locks, and diamond, the brilliant, hard gemstone. Using 
the  enthalpies of combustion for graphite (2394 kJ/mol) and diamond (2396 kJ/mol), 
calculate DH for the conversion of graphite to diamond:
Cgraphite1s2 h Cdiamond1s2
 
SOLUTION 
Where are we going?
To calculate DH for the conversion of graphite to diamond
What do we know?
The combustion reactions are

‚ùØ  Cdiamond1s2 1 O21g2 h CO21g2¬†¬†¬†¬† DH 5 2396 kJ
How do we get there?
How do we combine the combustion equations to obtain the equation for the 
conversion of graphite to diamond?
Note that if we reverse the second reaction (which means we must change the sign of 
DH) and sum the two reactions, we obtain the desired reaction:
 Cgraphite1s2 1 O21g2 h CO21g2¬†¬†¬†¬†
 DH 5 2394 kJ
 CO21g2 h Cdiamond1s2 1 O21g2¬†¬†¬†¬† DH 5 212396 kJ2
 Cgraphite1s2 h Cdiamond1s2¬†¬†
 DH 5 2 kJ
‚ñ† The DH for the conversion of graphite to diamond is
DH 5 2 kJ/mol graphite
We obtain this value by summing the DH values for the equations as shown above. 
This process is endothermic since the sign of DH is positive.

SOLUTION 
To obtain DH for the required reaction, we must somehow combine equations (a), (b),  
(c), and (d) to produce that reaction and add the corresponding DH values. This can 
best be done by focusing on the reactants and products of the required reaction. The 
reactants are B(s) and H2(g), and the product is B2H6(g). How can we obtain the cor-
rect equation? Reaction (a) has B(s) as a reactant, as needed in the required equation. 
Thus reaction (a) will be used as it is. Reaction (b) has B2H6(g) as a reactant, but this

substance is needed as a product. Thus reaction (b) must be reversed, and the sign of 
DH must be changed accordingly. Up to this point we have

2B1s2 1 3H2O1g2 h B2H61g2 1 3
2O21g2¬†¬†¬†¬†DH 5 762 kJ
We are closer to the required reaction, but we still need to remove H2O(g) and O2(g) 
and introduce H2(g) as a reactant. We can do this using reactions (c) and (d). If we 
multiply reaction (c) and its DH value by 3 and add the result to the preceding equa-
tion, we have
 2B1s2 1 3H2O1g2 h B2H61g2 1 3

We can cancel the 3
2O2(g) on both sides, but we cannot cancel the H2O because it is 
gaseous on one side and liquid on the other. This can be solved by adding reaction (d), 
multiplied by 3:
 2B1s2 1 3H21g2 1 3H2O1g2 h B2H61g2 1 3H2O1l2¬†¬†¬†¬†
 DH 5 296 kJ

This gives the reaction required by the problem:
2B1s2 1 3H21g2 h B2H61g2¬†¬†¬†¬†DH 5 136 kJ
‚ñ† Thus DH for the synthesis of 1 mole of diborane from the elements is 136 kJ.
See Exercises 6.77 through 6.82
PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY
Hess‚Äôs Law
Calculations involving Hess‚Äôs law typically require that several reactions be manipulated 
and combined to finally give the reaction of interest. In doing this procedure you should
 
¬ª Work backward from the required reaction, using the reactants and products to 
decide how to manipulate the other given reactions at your disposal
 
¬ª Reverse any reactions as needed to give the required reactants and products
 
¬ª Multiply reactions to give the correct numbers of reactants and products
This process involves some trial and error, but it can be very systematic if you always 
allow the final reaction to guide you.
 
6.4 Standard Enthalpies of Formation
For a reaction studied under conditions of constant pressure, we can obtain the enthalpy 
change using a calorimeter. However, this process can be very difficult. In fact, in 
some cases it is impossible, since certain reactions do not lend themselves to such

study. An example is the conversion of solid carbon from its graphite form to its dia-
mond form:
Cgraphite1s2 h Cdiamond1s2
The value of DH for this process cannot be obtained by direct measurement in a calo-
rimeter because the process is much too slow under normal conditions. However, as 
we saw in Example 6.7, DH for this process can be calculated from heats of combus-
tion. This is only one example of how useful it is to be able to calculate DH values for 
chemical  reactions. We will next show how to do this using standard enthalpies of 
formation.
 
The standard enthalpy of formation (DH¬∞f ) of a compound is defined as the 
change in enthalpy that accompanies the formation of 1 mole of a compound from its 
elements with all substances in their standard states.
 
A degree symbol on a thermodynamic function, for example, DH8, indicates that the 
corresponding process has been carried out under standard conditions. The standard 
state for a substance is a precisely defined reference state. Because thermodynamic 
functions often depend on the concentrations (or pressures) of the substances involved, 
we must use a common reference state to properly compare the thermodynamic prop-
erties of two substances. This is especially important because, for most thermody-
namic properties, we can measure only changes in the property. For example, we have 
no method for determining absolute values of enthalpy. We can measure enthalpy 
changes (DH values) only by performing heat-flow experiments.
Conventional Definitions of Standard States
For a Compound
 ¬ª The standard state of a gaseous substance is a pressure of exactly 1 atmosphere.
 ¬ª For a pure substance in a condensed state (liquid or solid), the standard state is the pure 
liquid or solid.
 ¬ª For a substance present in a solution, the standard state is a concentration of exactly 1 M.
For an Element
 ¬ª The standard state of an element is the form in which the element exists under conditions 
of 1 atmosphere and 258C. (The standard state for oxygen is O2(g) at a pressure of 
1¬†atmosphere; the standard state for sodium is Na(s); the standard state for mercury  
is Hg(l); and so on.)
 
Several important characteristics of the definition of the enthalpy of formation will 
become clearer if we again consider the formation of nitrogen dioxide from the ele-
ments in their standard states:
1
2N21g2 1 O21g2 h NO21g2¬†¬†¬†¬†DH¬∞f 5 34 kJ/mol
Note that the reaction is written so that both elements are in their standard states, and 
1 mole of product is formed. Enthalpies of formation are always given per mole of 
product with the product in its standard state.
 
The formation reaction for methanol is written as
C1s2 1 2H21g2 1 1
2O21g2 h CH3OH1l2¬†¬†¬†¬†DH¬∞f 5 2239 kJ/mol
The standard state of carbon is graphite, the standard states for oxygen and hydrogen 
are the diatomic gases, and the standard state for methanol is the liquid.
The International Union of Pure and 
 Applied Chemists (IUPAC) has adopted  
1 bar (100,000 Pa) as the standard  pressure 
instead of 1 atm (101,305 Pa). Both standards 
are now in wide use.
Standard state is not the same as the 
standard temperature and pressure (STP) 
for a gas (discussed in Section 5.4).

The DH¬∞f  values for some common substances are shown in Table 6.2. More values 
are found in Appendix 4. The importance of the tabulated DH¬∞f  values is that enthalpies 
for many reactions can be calculated using these numbers. To see how this is done, we 
will calculate the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane:
CH41g2 1 2O21g2 h CO21g2 1 2H2O1l2
Enthalpy is a state function, so we can invoke Hess‚Äôs law and choose any convenient 
pathway from reactants to products and then sum the enthalpy changes along the cho-
sen pathway. A convenient pathway, shown in Fig. 6.9, involves taking the reactants 
apart to the respective elements in their standard states in reactions (a) and (b) and then 
forming the products from these elements in reactions (c) and (d). This general path-
way will work for any reaction, since atoms are conserved in a chemical reaction.
 
Note from Fig. 6.9 that reaction (a), where methane is taken apart into its elements,
CH41g2 h C1s2 1 2H21g2
is just the reverse of the formation reaction for methane:
C 1s2 1 2H21g2 h CH41g2¬†¬†¬†¬†DH¬∞f 5 275 kJ/mol
Since reversing a reaction means changing the sign of DH but keeping the magnitude 
the same, DH for reaction (a) is 2DHf8, or 75 kJ. Thus DH8(a) 5 75 kJ.
 
Next we consider reaction (b). Here oxygen is already an element in its standard 
state, so no change is needed. Thus DH8(b) 5 0.
 
The next steps, reactions (c) and (d), use the elements formed in reactions (a) and 
(b) to form the products. Note that reaction (c) is simply the formation reaction for 
carbon dioxide:
C 1s2 1 O21g2 h CO21g2¬†¬†¬†¬†DH¬∞f 5 2394 kJ/mol
and
DH¬∞1c2 5 DH¬∞f  for CO21g2 5 2394 kJ
Reaction (d) is the formation reaction for water:
H21g2 1 1
2 O21g2 h H2O1l2¬†¬†¬†¬†DH¬∞f 5 2286 kJ/mol
However, since 2 moles of water are required in the balanced equation, we must form 
2 moles of water from the elements:

Thus

We have now completed the pathway from the reactants to the products. The change 
in enthalpy for the reaction is the sum of the DH values (including their signs) for 
the steps:

 5 2891 kJ
This process is diagramed in Fig. 6.10. Notice that the reactants are taken apart and 
converted to elements [not necessary for O2(g)] that are then used to form products. 
You can see that this is a very exothermic reaction because very little energy is required 
to convert the reactants to the respective elements but a great deal of energy is released 
when these elements form the products. This is why this reaction is so useful for pro-
ducing heat to warm homes and offices.
 
Let‚Äôs examine carefully the pathway we used in this example. First, the reactants 
were broken down into the elements in their standard states. This process involved 
reversing the formation reactions and thus switching the signs of the enthalpies of 
formation. The products were then constructed from these elements. This involved 
formation reactions and thus enthalpies of formation. We can summarize this entire 
process as follows: The enthalpy change for a given reaction can be calculated by 
subtracting the enthalpies of formation of the reactants from the enthalpies of 
formation of the products. Remember to multiply the enthalpies of formation by 
integers as required by the balanced equation. This statement can be represented 
symbolically as follows:
 
DH¬∞reaction 5 SnpDH¬∞f  1products2 2 SnrDH¬∞f  1reactants2  
(6.1)
where the symbol S (sigma) means ‚Äúto take the sum of the terms,‚Äù and np and nr rep-
resent the moles of each product or reactant, respectively.
 
Elements are not included in the calculation because elements require no change in 
form. We have in effect defined the enthalpy of formation of an element in its standard 
state as zero, since we have chosen this as our reference point for calculating enthalpy 
changes in reactions.
Subtraction means to reverse the sign  
and add.

PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY
Enthalpy Calculations
 
¬ª When a reaction is reversed, the magnitude of DH remains the same, but its 
sign changes.
 
¬ª When the balanced equation for a reaction is multiplied by an integer, the 
value of DH for that reaction must be multiplied by the same integer.
 
¬ª The change in enthalpy for a given reaction can be calculated from the enthal-
pies of formation of the reactants and products:
DH¬∞reaction 5 SnpDH¬∞f 1products2 2 SnrDH¬∞f  1reactants2
 
¬ª Elements in their standard states are not included in the DHreaction calculations. 
That is, DHf8 for an element in its standard state is zero.
Enthalpies from Standard Enthalpies of Formation I
Using the standard enthalpies of formation listed in Table 6.2, calculate the standard 
enthalpy change for the overall reaction that occurs when ammonia is burned in air to 
form nitrogen dioxide and water. This is the first step in the manufacture of nitric acid.

SOLUTION 
We will use the pathway in which the reactants are broken down into elements in their 
standard states, which are then used to form the products (Fig. 6.11).
‚ùØ Decomposition of NH3(g) into elements [reaction (a) in Fig. 6.11]. The first 
step is to decompose 4 moles of NH3 into N2 and H2:

We now have the elements N2(g), H2(g), and O2(g), which can be combined 
to form the products of the overall reaction.
‚ùØ Synthesis of NO2(g) from elements [reaction (c) in Fig. 6.11]. The overall reac-

‚ùØ Synthesis of H2O(l) from elements [reaction (d) in Fig. 6.11]. Since the overall 
equation for the reaction has 6 moles of H2O(l), the required reaction is 6 times 
the formation reaction for H2O(l):

for an element in its standard state as zero. What if we define DHf8 for an element 
in its standard state as 10 kJ/mol? How would this affect your determination of 
DHreaction? Provide support for your answer with a sample calculation.

race cars. Using the data in Table 6.2, compare the standard enthalpy of combustion

Thus 1.45 3 103 kJ of heat is evolved when 2 moles of methanol burn. The molar mass

What is the enthalpy of combustion per gram?
This is the amount of heat evolved when 2 moles of octane burn. Since the molar mass 
of octane is 114.22 g/mol, the enthalpy of combustion per gram of octane is
21.09 3 104 kJ
21114.22 g2
5 247.7 kJ/g
‚ñ† The enthalpy of combustion per gram of octane is approximately twice that per 
gram of methanol. On this basis, gasoline appears to be superior to methanol 
for use in a racing car, where weight considerations are usually very important. 
Why, then, was methanol used in racing cars? The answer is that methanol 
burns much more smoothly than gasoline in high-performance engines, and 
this advantage more than compensates for its weight disadvantage.

converted over millions of years to fossil fuels. Although the United States currently 
depends heavily on petroleum for energy, this dependency is a relatively recent phe-
nomenon, as shown in Fig. 6.12. In this section we will discuss some sources of energy 
and their effects on the environment.
Petroleum and Natural Gas
Although how they were produced is not completely understood, petroleum and natu-
ral gas were most likely formed from the remains of marine organisms that lived 
approximately 500 million years ago. Petroleum is a thick, dark liquid composed 
mostly of compounds called hydrocarbons that contain carbon and hydrogen. (Carbon 
is unique among elements in the extent to which it can bond to itself to form chains of 
various lengths.) Table 6.3 gives the formulas and names for several common hydro-
carbons. Natural gas, usually associated with petroleum deposits, consists mostly of 
methane, but it also contains significant amounts of ethane, propane, and butane. Over 
the last several years it has become clear that there are tremendous reserves of natural 
gas deep in shale deposits. Estimates indicate that there may be as much as 200 trillion 
cubic meters of recoverable natural gas in these deposits around the globe. In the east-
ern United States, the 1-mile-deep Marsellus Shale deposit may contain as much as 
two trillion cubic meters of recoverable gas. The problem with these gas deposits is 
that the shale is very impermeable, and the gas does not flow out into wells on its own. 
A technique called hydraulic fracturing, or ‚Äúfracking,‚Äù is now being used to access 
these gas deposits. Fracking involves injecting a slurry of water, sand, and chemical 
additives under pressure through a well bore drilled into the shale. This produces frac-
tures in the rock that allow the gas to flow out into wells. With the increased use of 
fracking has come environmental concerns, including potential contamination of 
ground water, risks to air quality, and possible mishandling of wastes associated with 
the process. However, even in view of these potential hazards, it is expected that natu-
ral gas obtained from fracking may supply as much as half of the U.S. natural gas 
supply by the year 2020.
 
The composition of petroleum varies somewhat, but it consists mostly of hydrocar-
bons having chains that contain from 5 to more than 25 carbons. To be used efficiently, 
the petroleum must be separated into fractions by boiling. The lighter molecules (hav-
ing the lowest boiling points) can be boiled off, leaving the heavier ones behind. The 
commercial uses of various petroleum fractions are shown in Table 6.4.
 
The petroleum era began when the demand for lamp oil during the Industrial Revo-
lution outstripped the traditional sources: animal fats and whale oil. In response to this 
increased demand, Edwin Drake drilled the first oil well in 1859 at Titusville, Pennsyl-
vania. The petroleum from this well was refined to produce kerosene (fraction C10‚ÄìC18),

which served as an excellent lamp oil. Gasoline (fraction C5‚ÄìC10) had limited use and 
was  often discarded. However, this situation soon changed. The development of the 
electric light  decreased the need for kerosene, and the advent of the ‚Äúhorseless car-
riage‚Äù with its  gasoline-powered engine signaled the birth of the gasoline age.
 
As gasoline became more important, new ways were sought to increase the yield of 
gasoline obtained from each barrel of petroleum. William Burton invented a process at 
Standard Oil of Indiana called pyrolytic (high-temperature) cracking. In this process, 
the heavier molecules of the kerosene fraction are heated to about 7008C, causing them 
to break (crack) into the smaller molecules of hydrocarbons in the gasoline fraction. 
As cars became larger, more efficient internal combustion engines were designed. 
Because of the uneven burning of the gasoline then available, these engines ‚Äúknocked,‚Äù 
producing unwanted noise and even engine damage. Intensive research to find addi-
tives that would promote smoother burning produced tetraethyl lead, (C2H5)4Pb, a very 
effective ‚Äúantiknock‚Äù agent.
 
The addition of tetraethyl lead to gasoline became a common practice, and by 1960, 
gasoline contained as much as 3 grams of lead per gallon. As we have discovered so 
often in recent years, technological advances can produce environmental problems. To 
prevent air pollution from automobile exhaust, catalytic converters have been added to 
car exhaust systems. The effectiveness of these converters, however, is destroyed by 
lead. The use of leaded gasoline also greatly increased the amount of lead in the envi-
ronment, where it can be ingested by animals and humans. For these reasons, the use 
of lead in gasoline has been phased out, requiring extensive (and expensive) modifica-
tions of engines and of the gasoline refining process.
Coal
Coal was formed from the remains of plants that were buried and subjected to high 
pressure and heat over long periods of time. Plant materials have a high content of cel-
lulose, a complex molecule whose empirical formula is CH2O but whose molar mass 
is around 500,000 g/mol. After the plants and trees that flourished on the earth at vari-
ous times and places died and were buried, chemical changes gradually lowered the 
oxygen and hydrogen content of the cellulose molecules. Coal ‚Äúmatures‚Äù through four 
stages: lignite, subbituminous, bituminous, and anthracite. Each stage has a higher 
carbon-to-oxygen and carbon-to-hydrogen ratio; that is, the relative carbon content 
gradually increases. Typical elemental compositions of the various coals are given in 
Table 6.5. The energy available from the combustion of a given mass of coal increases 
as the  carbon content increases. Therefore, anthracite is the most valuable coal and 
lignite the least valuable.
 
Coal is an important and plentiful fuel in the United States, currently furnishing 
approximately 23% of our energy. As the supply of petroleum dwindles, the share of 
the energy supply from coal is expected to increase. However, coal is expensive and 
dangerous to mine underground, and the strip mining of fertile farmland in the Mid-
west or of scenic land in the West causes obvious problems. In addition, the burning of 
coal, especially high-sulfur coal, yields air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, which, in 
Coal has variable composition depending 
on both its age and location.

turn, can lead to acid rain, as we learned in Chapter 5. However, even if coal were pure 
carbon, the carbon dioxide produced when it was burned would still have significant 
effects on the earth‚Äôs climate.
Effects of Carbon Dioxide on Climate
The earth receives a tremendous quantity of radiant energy from the sun, about 30% of 
which is reflected back into space by the earth‚Äôs atmosphere. The remaining energy 
passes through the atmosphere to the earth‚Äôs surface. Some of this energy is absorbed 
by plants for photosynthesis and some by the oceans to evaporate water, but most of it 
is absorbed by soil, rocks, and water, increasing the temperature of the earth‚Äôs surface. 
This energy is in turn radiated from the heated surface mainly as infrared radiation, 
often called heat radiation.
 
The atmosphere, like window glass, is transparent to visible light but does not allow 
all the infrared radiation to pass back into space. Molecules in the atmosphere, princi-
pally H2O and CO2, strongly absorb infrared radiation and radiate it back toward the 
earth (Fig. 6.13), so a net amount of thermal energy is retained by the earth‚Äôs atmo-
sphere, causing the earth to be much warmer than it would be without its atmosphere. 
In a way, the atmosphere acts like the glass of a greenhouse, which is transparent to 
visible light but absorbs infrared radiation, thus raising the temperature inside the 
building. This greenhouse effect is seen even more spectacularly on Venus, where the 
dense atmosphere is thought to be responsible for the high surface temperature of that 
planet.
 
Thus the temperature of the earth‚Äôs surface is controlled to a significant extent by 
the water content of the atmosphere as well as greenhouse gases such as carbon diox-
ide. The effect of atmospheric moisture (humidity) is apparent in the Midwest. In sum-
mer, when the humidity is high, the heat of the sun is retained well into the night, 
giving very high nighttime temperatures. On the other hand, in winter, the coldest 
temperatures always occur on clear nights, when the low humidity allows efficient 
radiation of energy back into space.
 
The atmosphere‚Äôs water content is controlled by the water cycle (evaporation and 
precipitation), and the average remains constant over the years. However, as fossil 
fuels have been used more extensively, the carbon dioxide concentration has increased 
by about 16% from 1880 to 1980. Comparisons of satellite data have now produced 
evidence that the increase in carbon dioxide concentration has contributed to the 
warming of the earth‚Äôs atmosphere. The data compare the same areas in both 1979 and 
1997. The analysis shows that more infrared radiation was blocked by CO2, methane, 
and other greenhouse gases. This could increase the earth‚Äôs average temperature by as 
much as 38C, causing dramatic changes in climate and greatly affecting the growth of 
food crops.
 
How well can we predict long-term effects? Because weather has been studied for 
a period of time that is minuscule compared with the age of the earth, the factors that 
control the earth‚Äôs climate in the long range, such as changes in the sun, are not clearly 
understood. For example, we do not understand what causes the earth‚Äôs periodic ice 
ages. So it is difficult to estimate the impact of the increasing carbon dioxide levels.
 
In fact, the variation in the earth‚Äôs average temperature over the past century is 
somewhat confusing. In the northern latitudes during the past century, the average 
temperature rose by 0.88C over a period of 60 years, then cooled by 0.58C during the 
next 25 years, and finally warmed by 0.28C in the succeeding 15 years. Such fluctua-
tions do not match the steady increase in carbon dioxide. However, in southern lati-
tudes and near the equator during the past century, the average temperature showed a 
steady rise totaling 0.48C. This figure is in reasonable agreement with the predicted 
effect of the increasing carbon dioxide concentration over that period. Another signifi-
cant fact is that the past 10 years constitute the warmest decade on record, although the 
warming has not been as great as the models predicted for the increase in carbon diox-
ide concentration.
The electromagnetic spectrum, including 
visible and infrared radiation, is discussed 
in Chapter 7.
The average temperature of the earth‚Äôs 
surface is 298 K. It would be 255 K  without 
the ‚Äúgreenhouse gases.‚Äù

earth‚Äôs surface is strongly absorbed by 
CO2, H2O, and other molecules present in 
smaller amounts (for example, CH4 and 
N2O) in the atmosphere. In effect, the 
 atmosphere traps some of the energy, 
acting like the glass in a greenhouse and 
keeping the earth warmer than it would 
otherwise be.

Although the relationship between the carbon dioxide concentration in the 
atmosphere and the earth‚Äôs temperature is not known at present, one thing is clear: The 
increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide is quite dramatic 
(Fig. 6.14). We must consider the implications of this increase as we consider our 
future energy needs.
Methane is another greenhouse gas that is 21 times more potent than carbon diox-
ide. This fact is particularly significant for countries with lots of animals, because 
methane is produced by methanogenic archae that live in the animals‚Äô rumen. For 
example, sheep and cattle produce about 14% of Australia‚Äôs total greenhouse emis-
sions. To reduce this level, Australia has initiated a program to vaccinate sheep and 
cattle to lower the number of archae present in their digestive systems. It is hoped that 
this effort will reduce by 20% the amount of methane emitted by these animals.
6.6 New Energy Sources
As we search for the energy sources of the future, we need to consider economic, cli-
matic, and supply factors. There are several potential energy sources: the sun (solar), 
nuclear processes (fission and fusion), biomass (plants), and synthetic fuels. Direct use 
of the sun‚Äôs radiant energy to heat our homes and run our factories and transportation 
systems seems a sensible long-term goal. But what do we do now? Conservation of 
fossil fuels is one obvious step, but substitutes for fossil fuels also must be found. We 
will discuss some alternative sources of energy here. Nuclear power will be considered 
in Chapter 19.
Coal Conversion
One alternative energy source involves using a traditional fuel‚Äîcoal‚Äîin new ways. 
Since transportation costs for solid coal are high, more energy-efficient fuels are being 
developed from coal. One possibility is to produce a gaseous fuel. Substances like coal 
that contain large molecules have high boiling points and tend to be solids or thick 
liquids. To convert coal from a solid to a gas therefore requires reducing the size of the 
molecules; the coal structure must be broken down in a process called coal gasifica-
tion. This is done by treating the coal with oxygen and steam at high temperatures 
to break many of the  carbon‚Äìcarbon bonds. These bonds are replaced by carbon‚Äì 
hydrogen and carbon‚Äìoxygen bonds as the coal fragments react with the water and 
oxygen. The process is represented in Fig. 6.15. The desired product is a mixture of 
carbon monoxide and hydrogen called synthesis gas, or syngas, and methane (CH4) 
gas. Since all the components of this  product can react with oxygen to release heat in 
a combustion reaction, this gas is a useful fuel.
One of the most important considerations in designing an industrial process is effi-
cient use of energy. In coal gasification, some of the reactions are exothermic:

If such conditions as the rate of feed of coal, air, and steam are carefully controlled, the 
correct temperature can be maintained in the process without using any external energy 
source. That is, an energy balance is maintained.
 
Presently only a few plants in the United States use syngas produced on site to 
 produce electricity. These plants are being used to evaluate the economic feasibility of 
producing electrical power by coal gasification.
 
Although syngas can be used directly as a fuel, it is also important as a raw  
material to produce other fuels. For example, syngas can be converted directly to 
methanol:
CO1g2 1 2H21g2 h CH3OH1l2
Methanol is used in the production of synthetic fibers and plastics and also can be used 
as a fuel. In addition, it can be converted directly to gasoline. Approximately half of 
South Africa‚Äôs gasoline supply comes from methanol produced from syngas.
 
In addition to coal gasification, the formation of coal slurries is another new use of 
coal. A slurry is a suspension of fine particles in a liquid, and coal must be pulverized 
and mixed with water to form a slurry. The slurry can be handled, stored, and burned 
in ways similar to those used for residual oil, a heavy fuel oil from petroleum account-
ing for almost 15% of U.S. petroleum imports. One hope is that coal slurries might 
replace solid coal and residual oil as fuels for electricity-generating power plants. 
However, the water needed for slurries might place an unacceptable burden on water 
resources, especially in the western states.
Hydrogen as a Fuel
If you have ever seen a lecture demonstration where hydrogen‚Äìoxygen mixtures were 
ignited, you have witnessed a demonstration of hydrogen‚Äôs potential as a fuel. The 
combustion reaction is
H21g2 1 1
2 O21g2 h H2O1l2¬†¬†¬†¬†DH¬∞ 5 2286 kJ
As we saw in Example 6.6, the heat of combustion of H2(g) per gram is approximately 
2.5 times that of natural gas. In addition, hydrogen has a real advantage over fossil 
fuels in that the only product of hydrogen combustion is water; fossil fuels also pro-
duce carbon dioxide. However, even though it appears that hydrogen is a very logical

choice as a major fuel for the future, there are three main problems: the cost of produc-
tion, storage, and transport.
First let‚Äôs look at the production problem. Although hydrogen is very abundant on 
the earth, virtually none of it exists as the free gas. Currently, the main source of hydro-
gen gas is from the treatment of natural gas with steam:
CH41g2 1 H2O1g2 h 3H21g2 1 CO1g2

n the Midwest the wind blows across 
fields of corn, soybeans, wheat, and 
wind  turbines‚Äîwind turbines? It turns 
out that the wind that seems to blow 
almost continuously across the plains is 
now becoming the latest cash crop. 
One of these new-breed wind farmers 
is Daniel Juhl, who recently erected 
17¬†wind turbines on six acres of land 
near Woodstock, Minnesota. These 
turbines can generate as much as 
10¬†megawatts (MW) of electricity, which 
Juhl sells to the local electrical utility.
There is plenty of untapped wind 
power in the United States. Wind map-
pers rate regions on a scale of  
1 to 6 (with 6 being the best) to indicate 
the quality of the wind resource. Wind 
farms are now being developed in 
areas rated from 4 to 6. The farmers 
who own the land welcome the 
increased income derived from the 
wind blowing across their land. Econo-
mists estimate that each acre devoted 
to wind turbines can pay royalties to 
the farmers of as much as $8000 per 
year, or many times the revenue from 
growing corn on that same land. Juhl 
claims that farmers who construct the 
turbines themselves can realize as 
much as $20,000 per year per turbine. 
Globally, wind generation of electricity 
has nearly quadrupled in the last five 
years and is expected to increase by 
about 60% per year in the United 
States. The economic feasibility of wind- 
generated electricity has greatly 
improved in the past 30 years as the 
wind  turbines have become more 
efficient. Today‚Äôs turbines can produce 
electricity that costs about the same as 
that from other sources. The most 
impressive thing about wind power is 
the magnitude of the supply. Accord-
ing to the American Wind Energy Asso-
ciation in Washington, D.C., the 
wind-power potential in the United 
States is comparable or larger than the 
energy resources under the sands of 
Saudi Arabia.
The biggest hurdle that must be 
overcome before wind power can 
become a significant electricity producer 
in the United States is construction of 
the transmission  infrastructure‚Äî the 
power lines needed to move the electric-
ity from the rural areas to the cities 
where most of the power is used. For 
example, the hundreds of turbines 
planned in southwest Minnesota in a 
development called Buffalo Ridge could 
supply enough electricity to power 
1¬†million homes if transmission problems 
can be solved.
Another possible scenario for wind 
farms is to use the electrical power 
generated to decompose water to 
produce hydrogen gas that could be 
carried to cities by pipelines and used 
as a fuel. One real benefit of hydrogen 
is that it produces water as its only 
combustion product. Thus, it is essen-
tially pollution-free.
Within a few years, wind power 
could be a major source of electric-
ity. There could be a fresh wind 
blowing across the energy land-
scape of the United States in the 
near future.

Note that this reaction is highly endothermic; treating methane with steam is not an 
efficient way to obtain hydrogen for fuel. It would be much more economical to burn 
the methane directly.
 
A virtually inexhaustible supply of hydrogen exists in the waters of the world‚Äôs 
oceans. However, the reaction
H2O1l2 h H21g2 1 1
2 O21g2
requires 286 kJ of energy per mole of liquid water, and under current circumstances, 
large-scale production of hydrogen from water is not economically feasible. However, 
several methods for such production are currently being studied: electrolysis of water, 
thermal decomposition of water, thermochemical decomposition of water, and biologi-
cal decomposition of water.
 
Electrolysis of water involves passing an electric current through it. The present 
cost of electricity makes the hydrogen produced by electrolysis too expensive to be 
competitive as a fuel. However, if in the future we develop more efficient sources of 
electricity, this situation could change.
 
Recent research at the University of Minnesota by Lanny Schmidt and his cowork-
ers suggests that corn could be a feasible source of hydrogen. In this process the starch 
from the corn is fermented to produce alcohol, which is then decomposed in a special 
reactor at 1408C with a rhodium and cerium oxide catalyst to give hydrogen. These 
scientists indicate that enough hydrogen gas can be obtained from a few ounces of 
ethanol to generate electricity to run six 60-watt bulbs for an hour.
 
Thermal decomposition is another method for producing hydrogen from water. 
This involves heating the water to several thousand degrees, where it spontaneously 
decomposes into hydrogen and oxygen. However, attaining temperatures in this range 
would be very expensive even if a practical heat source and a suitable reaction con-
tainer were available.
 
In the thermochemical decomposition of water, chemical reactions, as well as heat, 
are used to ‚Äúsplit‚Äù water into its components. One such system involves the following 
reactions (the temperature required for each is given in parentheses):
 2HI h I2 1 H2¬†¬†¬†¬†
 1425¬∞C2
 2H2O 1 SO2 1 I2 h H2SO4 1 2HI¬†¬†¬†¬†
 190¬∞C2
 H2SO4 h SO2 1 H2O 1 1
2 O2¬†¬†¬†¬† 1825¬∞C2
 Net reaction: H2O h H2 1 1
2 O2
Note that the HI is not consumed in the net reaction. Note also that the maximum tem-
perature required is 8258C, a temperature that is feasible if a nuclear reactor is used as 
a heat source. A current research goal is to find a system for which the required tem-
peratures are low enough that sunlight can be used as the energy source.
 
But what about the organisms that decompose water without the aid of electricity 
or high temperatures? In the process of photosynthesis, green plants absorb carbon 
dioxide and water and use them along with energy from the sun to produce the sub-
stances needed for growth. Scientists have studied photosynthesis for years, hoping to 
get answers to  humanity‚Äôs food and energy shortages. At present, much of this research 
involves attempts to modify the photosynthetic process so that plants will release 
hydrogen gas from water instead of using the hydrogen to produce complex com-
pounds. Small-scale experiments have shown that under certain conditions plants do 
produce hydrogen gas, but the yields are far from being commercially useful. At this 
point the economical production of hydrogen gas remains unrealized.
 
The storage and transportation of hydrogen also present problems. First, on metal 
surfaces the H2 molecule decomposes to atoms. Since the atoms are so small, they can 
migrate into the metal, causing structural changes that make it brittle. This might lead 
to a pipeline failure if hydrogen were pumped under high pressure.
 
An additional problem is the relatively small amount of energy that is available per 
unit volume of hydrogen gas. Although the energy available per gram of hydrogen is 
Electrolysis will be discussed in  
Chapter 18.

significantly greater than that per gram of methane, the energy available per given 
volume of hydrogen is about one-third that available from the same volume of meth-
ane. This is demonstrated in Example 6.12.
 
Although the use of hydrogen as a fuel solves some of the problems associated with 
fossil fuels, it does present some potential environmental problems of its own. Studies 
by John M. Eiler and his colleagues at California Institute of Technology indicate that, 
if hydrogen becomes a major source of energy, accidental leakage of the gas into the 
atmosphere could pose a threat. The Cal Tech scientists calculate that leakage could 
raise the concentration of H2 in the atmosphere from its natural level of 0.5 part per 
million to more than 2 parts per million. As some of the H2 eventually finds its way 
into the upper atmosphere, it would react with O2 to form water, which would increase 
the number of ice crystals. This could lead to the destruction of some of the protective 
ozone because many of the chemical reactions that destroy ozone occur on the surfaces 
of ice crystals. However, as is the usual case with environmental issues, the situation is 
complicated. The scenario suggested by Eiler‚Äôs team may not happen because the 
leaked H2 could be consumed by soil microbes that use hydrogen as a nutrient. In fact, 
Eiler‚Äôs studies show that 90% of the H2 emitted into the atmosphere today from sources 
such as motor vehicles and forest fires is eventually absorbed by soil organisms.
 
The evaluation of hydrogen as a fuel illustrates how complex and interconnected 
the economic and environmental issues are.
Enthalpies of Combustion
Compare the energy available from the combustion of a given volume of methane and 
the same volume of hydrogen at the same temperature and pressure.
 
SOLUTION 
In Example 6.6 we calculated the heat released for the combustion of methane and 
hydrogen: 55 kJ/g CH4 and 141 kJ/g H2. We also know from our study of gases that  
1 mole of H2(g) has the same volume as 1 mole of CH4(g) at the same temperature 
and pressure (assuming ideal behavior). Thus, for molar volumes of both gases 
under the same conditions of temperature and pressure,
 Enthalpy of combustion of 1 molar volume of H21g2
Enthalpy of combustion of 1 molar volume of CH41g2
 5 enthalpy of combustion per mole of H2

‚ñ† Thus about three times the volume of hydrogen gas is needed to furnish the 
same energy as a given volume of methane.
See Exercise 6.98
 
Could hydrogen be considered as a potential fuel for automobiles? This is an 
intriguing question. The internal combustion engines in automobiles can be easily 
adapted to burn hydrogen. In fact, BMW is now experimenting with a fleet of cars 
powered by  hydrogen-burning internal combustion engines. However, the primary dif-
ficulty is the storage of enough hydrogen to give an automobile a reasonable range. 
This is illustrated by Example 6.13.

Comparing Enthalpies of Combustion
Assuming that the combustion of hydrogen gas provides three times as much energy 
per gram as gasoline, calculate the volume of liquid H2 (density 5 0.0710 g/mL) 
required to furnish the energy contained in 80.0 L (about 20 gal) of gasoline (den-
sity 5 0.740 g/mL). Calculate also the volume that this hydrogen would occupy as 
a gas at 1.00 atm and 258C.
 
SOLUTION 
Where are we going?
To calculate the volume of H2(l) required and its volume as a gas at the given conditions
What do we know?
‚ùØ Density for H2(l) 5 0.0710 g/mL
‚ùØ 80.0 L gasoline
‚ùØ Density for gasoline 5 0.740 g/mL
‚ùØ H2(g) ‚áí P 5 1.00 atm, T 5 258C 5 298 K
How do we get there?

5 59,200 g
How much H2(l) is needed?
Since H2 furnishes three times as much energy per gram as gasoline, only a third as 
much liquid hydrogen is needed to furnish the same energy:
Mass of H21l2 needed 5 59,200 g

5 19,700 g
Since density 5 mass/volume, then volume 5 mass/density, and the volume of H2(l) 
needed is

 5 2.77 3 105 mL 5 277 L
‚ñ† Thus 277 L of liquid H2 is needed to furnish the same energy of combustion as 
80.0 L of gasoline.
What is the volume of the H2(g)?
To calculate the volume that this hydrogen would occupy as a gas at 1.00 atm and 
258C, we use the ideal gas law:
PV 5 nRT
In this case

‚ñ† At 1 atm and 258C, the hydrogen gas needed to replace 20 gal of gasoline 
occupies a volume of 239,000 L.
See Exercises 6.99 and 6.100
 
You can see from Example 6.13 that an automobile would need a huge tank to hold 
enough hydrogen gas (at 1 atm) to have a typical mileage range. Clearly, hydrogen 
must be stored as a liquid or in some other way. Is this feasible? Because of its very 
low boiling point (20 K), storage of liquid hydrogen requires a superinsulated con-
tainer that can withstand high pressures. Storage in this manner would be both expen-
sive and hazardous because of the potential for explosion. Thus storage of hydrogen in 
the individual automobile as a liquid does not seem practical.
 
A much better alternative seems to be the use of metals that absorb hydrogen to 
form solid metal hydrides:
H21g2 1 M1s2 h MH21s2
To use this method of storage, hydrogen gas would be pumped into a tank containing 
the solid metal in powdered form, where it would be absorbed to form the hydride, 
whose volume would be little more than that of the metal alone. This hydrogen would 
then be available for combustion in the engine by release of H2(g) from the hydride as 
needed:
MH21s2 h M1s2 1 H21g2
Several types of solids that absorb hydrogen to form hydrides are being studied for use 
in hydrogen-powered vehicles. The most likely use of hydrogen in automobiles will be 
to power fuel cells. Ford, Honda, and Toyota are all experimenting with cars powered 
by hydrogen fuel cells.
Other Energy Alternatives
Many other energy sources are being considered for future use. The western states, 
especially Colorado, contain huge deposits of oil shale, which consists of a complex 
carbon-based material called kerogen contained in porous rock formations. These 
deposits have the potential of being a larger energy source than the vast petroleum 
deposits of the  Middle East. The main problem with oil shale is that the trapped fuel is 
not fluid and cannot be pumped. To recover the fuel, the rock must be heated to a tem-
perature of 2508C or higher to decompose the kerogen to smaller molecules that pro-
duce gaseous and liquid products. This process is expensive and yields large quantities 
of waste rock, which have a  negative environmental impact.
 
Ethanol (C2H5OH) is another fuel used to supplement gasoline. The most common 
method of producing ethanol is fermentation, a process in which sugar is changed to 
alcohol by the action of yeast. The sugar can come from  virtually any source, includ-
ing fruits and grains, although fuel-grade ethanol would probably come mostly from 
corn. Car engines can burn pure alcohol or gasohol, an alcohol‚Äìgasoline mixture (10% 
ethanol in gasoline), with little modification. Gasohol is now widely available in the 
United States. A fuel called E85, which is 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline, is also 
widely available for cars with ‚Äúflex-fuel‚Äù engines. The use of pure alcohol as a motor 
fuel is not feasible in most of the United States because it does not vaporize easily 
when temperatures are low. However, pure ethanol could be a very practical fuel in 
warm climates. For  example, in Brazil, large quantities of ethanol fuel are being pro-
duced for cars. It is hoped that in the future ethanol can be derived from sources of 
cellulose, such as switch grass, so that corn, which is a valuable food source, would not 
have to be used. However, the process to efficiently convert cellulose to ethanol has 
proved very difficult to develop.
Metal hydrides are discussed in Chapter 20.

Methanol (CH3OH), an alcohol similar to ethanol, which was used successfully for 
many years in race cars, is now being evaluated as a motor fuel in California. A major 
gasoline retailer has agreed to install pumps at 25 locations to dispense a fuel that is 
85% methanol and 15% gasoline for use in specially prepared automobiles. The Cali-
fornia  Energy Commission feels that methanol has great potential for providing a 
secure, long-term energy supply that would alleviate air quality problems. Arizona and 
Colorado are also considering methanol as a source of portable energy.
 
Another potential source of liquid fuels is oil squeezed from seeds (seed oil). For 
example, some farmers in North Dakota, South Africa, and Australia are now using 
sunflower oil to replace diesel fuel. Oil seeds, found in a wide variety of plants, can be 
processed to produce an oil composed mainly of carbon and hydrogen, which of course 
reacts with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, water, and heat. It is hoped that oil-seed 
plants can be developed that will thrive under soil and climatic conditions unsuitable 
for corn and wheat. The main advantage of seed oil as a fuel is that it is renewable. 
Ideally, fuel would be grown just like food crops.

techniques into one situation.

the two pathways illustrate that DE and DH are state func-

I
n the past 200 years, a great deal of experimental evidence has accumulated to sup-
port the atomic model. This theory has proved to be both extremely useful and 
physically reasonable. When atoms were first suggested by the Greek philosophers 
Democritus and Leucippus about 400 b.c., the concept was based mostly on intuition. 
In fact, for the following 20 centuries, no convincing experimental evidence was avail-
able to support the existence of atoms. The first real scientific data were gathered by 
Lavoisier and others from quantitative measurements of chemical reactions. The 
results of these stoichiometric experiments led John Dalton to propose the first system-
atic atomic theory. Dalton‚Äôs theory, although crude, has stood the test of time extremely 
well.
Once we came to ‚Äúbelieve in‚Äù atoms, it was logical to ask: What is the nature of an 
atom? Does an atom have parts, and if so, what are they? In Chapter 2 we considered 
some of the experiments most important for shedding light on the nature of the atom. 
Now we will see how the atomic theory has evolved to its present state.
One of the most striking things about the chemistry of the elements is the periodic 
repetition of properties. There are several groups of elements that show great similari-
ties in chemical behavior. As we saw in Chapter 2, these similarities led to the develop-
ment of the periodic table of the elements. In this chapter we will see that the modern 
theory of atomic structure accounts for periodicity in terms of the electron arrange-
ments in atoms.
However, before we examine atomic structure, we must consider the revolution that 
took place in physics in the first 30 years of the twentieth century. During that time, 
experiments were carried out, the results of which could not be explained by the theo-
ries of classical physics developed by Isaac Newton and many others who followed 
him. A radical new theory called quantum mechanics was developed to account for the 
behavior of light and atoms. This ‚Äúnew physics‚Äù provides many surprises for humans 
who are used to the macroscopic world, but it seems to account flawlessly (within the 
bounds of necessary approximations) for the behavior of matter.
As the first step in our exploration of this revolution in science, we will consider the 
properties of light, more properly called electromagnetic radiation.
7.1 Electromagnetic Radiation
One of the ways that energy travels through space is by electromagnetic radiation. 
The light from the sun, the energy used to cook food in a microwave oven, the X rays 
used by dentists, and the radiant heat from a fireplace are all examples of electromag-
netic radiation. Although these forms of radiant energy seem quite different, they all 
exhibit the same type of wavelike behavior and travel at the speed of light in a 
vacuum.
Waves have three primary characteristics: wavelength, frequency, and speed. 
Wavelength (symbolized by the lowercase Greek letter lambda, l) is the distance 
between two consecutive peaks or troughs in a wave (Fig. 7.1). The frequency
(symbolized by the lowercase Greek letter nu, n) is defined as the number of waves 
(cycles) per second that pass a given point in space. Since all types of electromag-
netic radiation travel at the speed of light, short-wavelength radiation must have a 
high frequency. You can see this in Fig. 7.1, where three waves are shown traveling 
between two points at constant speed. Note that the wave with the shortest wave-
length (l3) has the highest frequency and the wave with the longest wavelength (l1) 
has the lowest frequency.This implies an inverse relationship between wavelength 
and frequency, that is, l ~ 1yn, or
ln 5 c
where l is the wavelength in meters, n is the frequency in cycles per second, and c is 
the speed of light (2.9979 3 108 m/s).  In the SI system, cycles are understood, and the 
unit per second becomes 1/s, or s21, which is called the hertz (abbreviated Hz).

Electromagnetic radiation is classified as shown in Fig. 7.2. Radiation provides an 
important means of energy transfer. For example, the energy from the sun reaches the 
earth mainly in the form of visible and ultraviolet radiation, whereas the glowing coals 
of a fireplace transmit heat energy by infrared radiation. In a microwave oven, the 
water molecules in food absorb microwave radiation, which increases their motions. 
This energy is then transferred to other types of molecules via collisions, causing an 
increase in the food‚Äôs temperature. As we proceed in the study of chemistry, we will 
consider many of the classes of electromagnetic radiation and the ways in which they 
affect matter.

The brilliant red colors seen in fireworks are due to the emission of light with wave-
lengths around 650 nm when strontium salts such as Sr(NO3)2 and SrCO3 are heated. 
(This can be easily demonstrated in the lab by dissolving one of these salts in methanol 
that contains a little water and igniting the mixture in an evaporating dish.) Calculate 
the frequency of red light of wavelength 6.50 3 102 nm.

7.2 The Nature of Matter
It is probably fair to say that at the end of the nineteenth century, physicists were feeling 
rather smug. Theories could explain phenomena as diverse as the motions of the planets 
and the dispersion of visible light by a prism. Rumor has it that students were being 
discouraged from pursuing physics as a career because it was felt that all the major prob-
lems had been solved, or at least described in terms of the current physical theories.
At the end of the nineteenth century, the idea prevailed that matter and energy were 
distinct. Matter was thought to consist of particles, whereas energy in the form of light 
(electromagnetic radiation) was described as a wave. Particles were things that had 
mass and whose position in space could be specified. Waves were described as mass-
less and delocalized; that is, their position in space could not be specified. It also was 
assumed that there was no intermingling of matter and light. Everything known before 
1900 seemed to fit neatly into this view.
At the beginning of the twentieth century, however, certain experimental results 
suggested that this picture was incorrect. The first important advance came in 1900 
from the German physicist Max Planck (1858‚Äì1947). Studying the radiation profiles 
emitted by solid bodies heated to incandescence, Planck found that the results could 
not be explained  in terms of the physics of his day, which held that matter could 
absorb or emit any quantity of energy. Planck could account for these observations 
only by postulating that energy can be gained or lost only in whole-number multiples
of the quantity hn, where h is a constant called Planck‚Äôs constant, determined by 
experiment to have the value 6.626 3 10234 J ? s. That is, the change in energy for a 
system, DE, can be represented by the equation
DE 5 nhn
where n is an integer (1, 2, 3, . . .), h is Planck‚Äôs constant, and n is the frequency of the 
electromagnetic radiation absorbed or emitted.
Planck‚Äôs result was a real surprise. It had always been assumed that the energy of 
matter was continuous, which meant that the transfer of any quantity of energy was 
possible. Now it seemed clear that energy is in fact quantized and can occur only in 
discrete units of size hn. Each of these small ‚Äúpackets‚Äù of energy is called a quantum. 
A system can transfer energy only in whole quanta. Thus energy seems to have par-
ticulate properties.

When a strontium salt is dissolved in 
methanol (with a little water) and ignited, 
it gives a brilliant red flame. The red color 
is produced by emission of light when 
electrons, excited by the energy of the 
burning methanol, fall back to their 
ground states.

When alternating current at 110 volts is 
applied to a dill pickle, a glowing dis-
charge occurs. The current flowing 
between the electrodes (forks), which is 
supported by the Na1 and Cl2 ions 
present, apparently causes some sodium 
atoms to form in an excited state. When 
these atoms relax to the ground state, 
they emit visible light at 589 nm, produc-
ing the yellow glow reminiscent  
of sodium vapor lamps.

The Energy of a Photon
The blue color in fireworks is often achieved by heating copper(I) chloride (CuCl) to 
about 12008C. Then the compound emits blue light having a wavelength of 450 nm. What 
is the increment of energy (the quantum) that is emitted at 4.50 3 102 nm by CuCl?
 
SOLUTION 
The quantum of energy can be calculated from the equation
DE 5 hn
The frequency n for this case can be calculated as follows:
n 5 c
l 5 2.9979 3 108 m/s
4.50 3 1027 m

So
DE 5 hn 5 16.626 3 10234 J # s2 16.66 3 1014 s212 5 4.41 3 10219 J
A sample of CuCl emitting light at 450 nm can lose energy only in increments of  
4.41 3 10219 J, the size of the quantum in this case.
See Exercises 7.47 and 7.48
 
The next important development in the knowledge of atomic structure came when 
 Albert Einstein (Fig. 7.3) proposed that electromagnetic radiation is itself quantized. 
Einstein suggested that electromagnetic radiation can be viewed as a stream of ‚Äúpar-
ticles‚Äù called photons. The energy of each photon is given by the expression
Ephoton 5 hn 5 hc
l
where h is Planck‚Äôs constant, n is the frequency of the radiation, and l is the wave-
length of the radiation.
The Photoelectric Effect
Einstein arrived at this conclusion through his analysis of the photoelectric effect (for 
which he later was awarded the Nobel Prize). The photoelectric effect refers to the 
INTERACTIVE EXAMPLE 7.2

FIGURE 7.3 Albert Einstein (1879‚Äì1955) was born in Germany. Nothing in his early development 
suggested  genius; even at the age of 9 he did not speak clearly, and his parents feared that he might 
be  handicapped. When asked what profession Einstein should follow, his school principal replied, ‚ÄúIt 
doesn‚Äôt matter; he‚Äôll never make a success of anything.‚Äù  When he was 10, Einstein entered the Luitpold 
Gymnasium (high school), which was typical of German schools of that time in being harshly 
 disciplinarian. There he developed a deep suspicion of authority and a skepticism that encouraged 
him to question and doubt‚Äîvaluable qualities in a scientist. In 1905, while a patent clerk in 
 Switzerland, Einstein published a paper explaining the photoelectric effect via the quantum theory. For 
this revolutionary thinking, he received a Nobel Prize in 1921. Highly regarded by this time, he worked in 
Germany until 1933, when Hitler‚Äôs persecution of the Jews forced him to come to the United States. He 
worked at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, New Jersey, until his death in 1955.
 
Einstein was undoubtedly the greatest physicist of our age. Even if someone else had derived the 
theory of relativity, his other work would have ensured his ranking as the second greatest physicist of 
his time. Our concepts of space and time were radically changed by ideas he first proposed when he 
was 26 years old. From then until the end of his life, he attempted  unsuccessfully to find a single 
unifying theory that would explain all physical events.

phenomenon in which electrons are emitted from the surface of a metal when light 
strikes it. The following observations characterize the photoelectric effect.
1.
Studies in which the frequency of the light is varied show that no electrons are 
emitted by a given metal below a specific threshold frequency, n0.
2. For light with frequency lower than the threshold frequency, no electrons are 
emitted regardless of the intensity of the light.
3. For light with frequency greater than the threshold frequency, the number of 
electrons emitted increases with the intensity of the light.
T
he art of using mixtures of chemicals 
to  produce explosives is an ancient 
one. Black powder‚Äîa mixture of potas-
sium nitrate, charcoal, and  sulfur‚Äîwas 
being used in China well before 1000 A.D. 
and has been used subsequently 
through the centuries in military explo-
sives, in construction blasting, and for 
fireworks. The du Pont Company, now a 
major chemical manufacturer, started 
out as a manufacturer of black powder. 
In fact, the founder, Eleuth√®re du Pont, 
learned the manufacturing technique 
from none other than Lavoisier.
Before the nineteenth century, fire-
works were confined mainly to rockets 
and loud bangs. Orange and yellow 
colors came from the presence of char-
coal and iron filings. However, with the 
great advances in chemistry in the nine-
teenth century, new compounds found 
their way into  fireworks. Salts of copper, 
strontium, and barium added brilliant 
colors. Magnesium and aluminum met-
als gave a dazzling white light. Fireworks, 
in fact, have changed very little since 
then.
How do fireworks produce their 
brilliant colors and loud bangs? Actually, 
only a handful of different chemicals are 
responsible for most of the spectacular 
effects. To produce the noise and flashes, 
an oxidizer (an oxidizing agent) and a 
fuel (a reducing agent) are used. A com-
mon mixture involves potassium per-
chlorate (KClO4) as the oxidizer and 
aluminum and sulfur as the fuel. The 
perchlorate oxidizes the fuel in a very 
exothermic reaction, which produces a 
brilliant flash, due to the aluminum, and 
a loud report from the rapidly expanding 
gases produced. For a color effect, an 
element with a colored emission spec-
trum is included. Recall that the electrons 
in atoms can be raised to higher-energy 
orbitals when the atoms absorb energy. 
The excited atoms can then release this 
excess energy by emitting light of spe-
cific wavelengths, often in the visible 
region. In fireworks, the energy to excite 
the electrons comes from the reaction 
between the oxidizer and fuel.
Yellow colors in fireworks are due to 
the 589-nm emission of sodium ions. 
Red colors come from strontium salts 
emitting at 606 nm and from  
636 to 688 nm. This red color is familiar 
from highway safety flares. Barium salts 
give a green color in fireworks, due to a 
series of emission lines between 505 
and 535 nm. A really good blue color, 
however, is hard to obtain. Copper salts 
give a blue color, emitting in the 420- to 
460-nm region. But difficulties occur 
 because the oxidizing agent, potassium 
chlorate (KClO3),  reacts with copper 
salts to form copper chlorate, a highly 
explosive compound that is dangerous 
to store. (The use of KClO3 in fireworks 
has been largely abandoned because

4. For light with frequency greater than the threshold frequency, the kinetic energy 
of the emitted electrons increases linearly with the frequency of the light.
 
These observations can be explained by assuming that electromagnetic radiation is 
quantized (consists of photons), and that the threshold frequency represents the mini-
mum energy required to remove the electron from the metal‚Äôs surface.
Minimum energy required to remove an electron 5 E0 5 hn0
of its explosive hazards.) Paris green, a 
copper salt containing arsenic, was 
once used extensively but is now con-
sidered to be too toxic.
In recent years the colors produced 
by fireworks have become more 
intense because of the formation of 
metal chlorides during the burning 
process. These gaseous metal chloride 
molecules produce colors much more 
brilliant than do the metal atoms by 
themselves. For example, strontium 
chloride produces a much brighter  
red than do strontium atoms. Thus, 
chlorine-donating compounds are now 
included in many fireworks shells.
A typical aerial shell is shown in the 
diagram. The shell is launched from a 
mortar (a steel cylinder) using black 
powder as the propellant. Time-delayed 
fuses are used to fire the shell in stages. 
A list of chemicals commonly used in 
fireworks is given in the table.
Although you might think that the 
chemistry of fireworks is simple, the 
achievement of the vivid white flashes 
and the brilliant colors requires com-
plex combinations of chemicals. For 
example, because the white flashes 
produce high flame temperatures, the 
colors tend to wash out. Thus oxidizers 
such as KClO4 are commonly used with 
fuels that produce relatively low flame 
temperatures. An added difficulty, 
however, is that perchlorates are very 
sensitive to accidental ignition and are 
therefore quite hazardous. Another 
problem arises from the use of sodium 
salts. Because sodium produces an 
extremely bright yellow emission, 
sodium salts cannot be used when 
other colors are desired. Carbon-based 
fuels also give a yellow flame that 
masks other colors, and this limits the 
use of organic compounds as fuels. You 
can see that the manufacture of fire-
works that produce the desired effects 
and are also safe to handle requires 
careful selection of chemicals. And, of 
course, there is still the dream of a 
deep blue flame.

Because a photon with energy less than E0 (n , n0) cannot remove an electron, light 
with a frequency less than the threshold frequency produces no electrons (Fig. 7.4). On 
the other hand, for light where n . n0, the energy in excess of that required to remove 
the electron is given to the electron as kinetic energy (KE):

Because in this picture the intensity of light is a measure of the number of photons 
present in a given part of the beam, a greater intensity means that more photons are 
available to release electrons (as long as n . n0 for the radiation).
 
In a related development, Einstein derived the famous equation
E 5 mc2
in his special theory of relativity published in 1905. The main significance of this 
equation is that energy has mass. This is more apparent if we rearrange the equation in 
the following form:
m 5 E
c2 m Energy
 
h

Speed of light
Using this form of the equation, we can calculate the mass associated with a given 
quantity of energy. For example, we can calculate the apparent mass of a photon. For 
electromagnetic radiation of wavelength l, the energy of each photon is given by the 
expression
Ephoton 5 hc
l
Then the apparent mass of a photon of light with wavelength l is given by
m 5 E

The photon behaves as if it has mass under certain circumstances. In 1922 Ameri-
can physicist Arthur Compton (1892‚Äì1962) performed experiments involving colli-
sions of X rays and electrons that showed that photons do exhibit the apparent mass 
calculated from the preceding equation. However, it is clear that photons do not have 
mass in the classical sense. A photon has mass only in a relativistic sense‚Äîit has no 
rest mass.
 
We can summarize the important conclusions from the work of Planck and Einstein 
as follows:
Energy is quantized. It can occur only in discrete units called quanta.
Electromagnetic radiation, which was previously thought to exhibit only wave 
properties, seems to show certain characteristics of particulate matter as well. 
This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as the dual nature of light (Fig. 7.5).
 
Thus light, which previously was thought to be purely wavelike, was found to have 
certain characteristics of particulate matter. But is the opposite also true? That is, does 
matter that is normally assumed to be particulate exhibit wave properties? This question 
was raised in 1923 by a young French physicist named Louis de Broglie (1892‚Äì1987). 
To see how de Broglie supplied the answer to this question, recall that the relationship 
Note that the apparent mass of a photon 
depends on its wavelength. A photon does 
not have mass in a classical sense.

between mass and wavelength for electromagnetic radiation is m 5 hylc. For a particle 
with velocity y, the corresponding expression is
m 5 h
ly
Rearranging to solve for l, we have
l 5 h
my
This equation, called de Broglie‚Äôs equation, allows us to calculate the wavelength for 
a particle, as shown in Example 7.3.
Calculations of Wavelength
Compare the wavelength for an electron (mass 5 9.11 3 10231 kg) traveling at a speed 
of 1.0 3 107 m/s with that for a ball (mass 5 0.10 kg) traveling at 35 m/s.

We use the equation l 5 hymy, where
h 5 6.626 3 10234 J # s¬†¬†or¬†¬†6.626 3 10234 kg # m2/s

Notice from Example 7.3 that the wavelength associated with the ball is incredibly 
short. On the other hand, the wavelength of the electron, although still quite small, 
happens to be on the same order as the spacing between the atoms in a typical crystal. 
This is important because, as we will see presently, it provides a means for testing 
de Broglie‚Äôs equation.
 
Diffraction results when light is scattered from a regular array of points or lines. 
You may have noticed the diffraction of light from the ridges and grooves of a compact 
disc. The colors result because the various wavelengths of visible light are not all scat-
tered in the same way. The colors are ‚Äúseparated,‚Äù giving the same effect as light pass-
ing through a prism. Just as a regular arrangement of ridges and grooves produces 
diffraction, so does a regular array of atoms or ions in a crystal, as shown in Figure¬†7.6. 
For example, when X rays are directed onto a crystal of a particular nickel/titanium 
alloy, the scattered  radiation produces a diffraction pattern of bright spots and dark 
areas on a photographic plate (Fig. 7.6). This occurs because the scattered light can 
interfere constructively (the peaks and troughs of the beams are in phase) to produce a 
bright area [Fig. 7.6(a)] or destructively (the peaks and troughs are out of phase) to 
produce a dark spot [Fig. 7.6(b)].
Do not confuse n (frequency) with  
y (velocity).

A diffraction pattern can be explained only in terms of waves. Thus, this phenomenon 
provides a test for the postulate that particles such as electrons have wavelengths. As we 
saw in Example 7.3, an electron with a velocity of 107 m/s (easily achieved by accelera-
tion of the electron in an electric field) has a wavelength of about 10210 m, which is 
roughly the distance between the ions in a crystal such as sodium chloride. This is impor-
tant because diffraction occurs most efficiently when the spacing between the scattering 
points is about the same as the wavelength of the wave being diffracted. Thus, if elec-
trons really do have an associated wavelength, a crystal should diffract electrons. An 
experiment to test this idea was carried out in 1927 by C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer 
at Bell  Laboratories. When they directed a beam of electrons at a nickel crystal, they 
observed a diffraction pattern similar to that seen from the diffraction of X rays. This 
result verified de Broglie‚Äôs relationship, at least for electrons. Larger chunks of matter, 
such as balls, have such small wavelengths (see Example 7.3) that they are impossible to 
verify  experimentally. However, we believe that all matter obeys de Broglie‚Äôs equation.
 
Now we have come full circle. Electromagnetic radiation, which at the turn of the 
twentieth century was thought to be a pure waveform, was found to possess particulate 
properties. Conversely, electrons, which were thought to be particles, were found to 
have a wavelength associated with them. The significance of these results is that matter 
and  energy are not distinct. Energy is really a form of matter, and all matter shows the 
same types of properties. That is, all matter exhibits both particulate and wave proper-
ties. Large pieces of matter, such as baseballs, exhibit predominantly particulate prop-
erties. The associated wavelength is so small that it is not observed. Very small ‚Äúbits of 
matter,‚Äù such as photons, while showing some particulate properties, exhibit predomi-
nantly wave properties. Pieces of matter with intermediate mass, such as electrons, 
show clearly both the particulate and wave properties of matter.
7.3 The Atomic Spectrum 
of Hydrogen
As we saw in Chapter 2, key information about the atom came from several experi-
ments carried out in the early twentieth century, in particular Thomson‚Äôs discovery of 
the  electron and Rutherford‚Äôs discovery of the nucleus. Another important experiment 
was the study of the emission of light by excited hydrogen atoms. When a sample of

 hydrogen gas receives a high-energy spark, the H2 molecules absorb energy, and some 
of the HOH bonds are broken. The resulting hydrogen atoms are excited; that is, they 
contain excess energy, which they release by emitting light of various wavelengths to 
produce what is called the emission spectrum of the hydrogen atom.
 
To understand the significance of the hydrogen emission spectrum, we must first 
describe the continuous spectrum that results when white light is passed through a 
prism [Fig. 7.7(a)]. This spectrum, like the rainbow produced when sunlight is 
 dispersed by raindrops, contains all the wavelengths of visible light. In contrast, when 
the hydrogen emission spectrum in the visible region is passed through a prism 
[Fig. 7.7(b)], we see only a few lines, each of which corresponds to a discrete wave-
length. The hydrogen emission spectrum is called a line spectrum.
 
What is the significance of the line spectrum of hydrogen? It indicates that only 
certain energies are allowed for the electron in the hydrogen atom. In other words, the 
energy of the electron in the hydrogen atom is quantized. This observation ties in per-
fectly with the postulates of Max Planck discussed in Section 7.2. Changes in energy 
between discrete energy levels in hydrogen will produce only certain wavelengths of 
emitted light (Fig. 7.8). For example, a given change in energy from a high to a lower 
level would give a wavelength of light that can be calculated from Planck‚Äôs equation:

The discrete line spectrum of hydrogen shows that only certain energies are possible; 
that is, the electron energy levels are quantized. In contrast, if any energy level were 
allowed, the emission spectrum would be continuous.

CRITICAL THINKING We now have evidence that electron 
energy levels in the atoms are quantized. Some of this evidence is discussed in 
this chapter. What if energy levels in atoms were not quantized? What are some 
differences we would notice?
7.4 The Bohr Model
In 1913, a Danish physicist named Niels Bohr (1885‚Äì1962), aware of the experimental 
results we have just discussed, developed a quantum model for the hydrogen atom. 
Bohr proposed that the electron in a hydrogen atom moves around the nucleus only in 
certain allowed circular orbits. He calculated the radii for these allowed orbits by 
using the theories of classical physics and by making some new assumptions.
From classical physics Bohr knew that a particle in motion tends to move in a 
straight line and can be made to travel in a circle only by application of a force toward 
the center of the circle. Thus Bohr reasoned that the tendency of the revolving electron 
to fly off the atom must be just balanced by its attraction for the positively charged 
nucleus. But classical physics also decreed that a charged particle under acceleration 
should radiate energy. Since an electron revolving around the nucleus constantly 
changes its direction, it is constantly accelerating. Therefore, the electron should emit 
light and lose energy‚Äîand thus be drawn into the nucleus. This, of course, does not 
correlate with the existence of stable atoms.
Clearly, an atomic model based solely on the theories of classical physics was 
untenable. Bohr also knew that the correct model had to account for the experimen-
tal spectrum of hydrogen, which showed that only certain electron energies were 
allowed. The experimental data were absolutely clear on this point. Bohr found that 
his model would fit the experimental results if he assumed that the angular momen-
tum of the electron (angular momentum equals the product of mass, velocity, and 
orbital radius) could occur only in certain increments. It was not clear why this 
should be true, but with this assumption, Bohr‚Äôs model gave hydrogen atom energy 
levels consistent with the hydrogen emission spectrum. The model is represented 
pictorially in Fig. 7.9.
Although we will not show the derivation here, the most important equation to 
come from Bohr‚Äôs model is the expression for the energy levels available to the elec-
tron in the hydrogen atom:
E 5 22.178 3 10218 J aZ 2
n2 b 
(7.1)
in which n is an integer (the larger the value of n, the larger the orbit radius) and Z is 
the nuclear charge. Using Equation (7.1), Bohr was able to calculate hydrogen atom 
energy levels that exactly matched the values obtained by experiment.
 
The negative sign in Equation (7.1) simply means that the energy of the electron 
bound to the nucleus is lower than it would be if the electron were at an infinite dis-
tance (n = `) from the nucleus, where there is no interaction and the energy is zero:
E 5 22.178 3 10218 J aZ 2
` b 5 0
The energy of the electron in any orbit is negative relative to this reference state.
 
Equation (7.1) can be used to calculate the change in energy of an electron when the 
electron changes orbits. For example, suppose an electron in level n 5 6 of an excited 
hydrogen atom falls back to level n 5 1 as the hydrogen atom returns to its lowest 
 possible energy state, its ground state. We use Equation (7.1) with Z 5 1, since the

hydrogen  nucleus contains a single proton. The energies corresponding to the two 
states are as  follows:
For n 5 6:¬†¬†¬†¬†E6 5 22.178 3 10218 J a12
62b 5 26.050 3 10220 J
For n 5 1:¬†¬†¬†¬†E1 5 22.178 3 10218 J a12
12b 5 22.178 3 10218 J
Note that for n 5 1 the electron has a more negative energy than it does for n 5 6, 
which means that the electron is more tightly bound in the smallest allowed orbit.
 
The change in energy, DE, when the electron falls from n 5 6 to n 5 1 is
 DE 5 energy of final state 2 energy of initial state
 5 E1 2 E6 5 122.178 3 10218 J2 2 126.050 3 10220 J2
 5 22.117 3 10218 J
The negative sign for the change in energy indicates that the atom has lost energy and 
is now in a more stable state. The energy is carried away from the atom by the produc-
tion (emission) of a photon.
 
The wavelength of the emitted photon can be calculated from the equation
DE 5 h a c
lb¬†¬†or¬†¬†l 5 hc
DE
where DE represents the change in energy of the atom, which equals the energy of the 
emitted photon. We have
l 5 hc
DE 5 16.626 3 10234 J # s2 12.9979 3 108 m/s2
2.117 3 10218 J
5 9.383 3 1028 m
Note that for this calculation the absolute value of DE is used (we have not included 
the negative sign). In this case we indicate the direction of energy flow by saying that 
a photon of wavelength 9.383 3 1028 m has been emitted from the hydrogen atom. 
Simply plugging the negative value of DE into the equation would produce a negative 
value for l, which is physically meaningless.

Niels Hendrik David Bohr (1885‚Äì1962) as a 
boy lived in the shadow of his younger 
brother Harald, who played on the 1908 
Danish Olympic Soccer Team and later 
became a distinguished mathematician. 
In school, Bohr received his poorest marks 
in composition and struggled with writ-
ing during his entire life. In fact, he wrote 
so poorly that he was forced to dictate his 
Ph.D. thesis to his mother. Nevertheless, 
Bohr was a brilliant physicist. After receiv-
ing his Ph.D. in Denmark, he constructed 
a quantum model for the hydrogen atom 
by the time he was 27. Even though his 
model later proved to be incorrect, Bohr 
remained a central figure in the drive to 
understand the atom. He was awarded 
the Nobel Prize in physics in 1922.

See Exercises 7.63 and 7.64
At this time we must emphasize two important points about the Bohr model:
1.
The model correctly fits the quantized energy levels of the hydrogen atom and 
postulates only certain allowed circular orbits for the electron.
2.
As the electron becomes more tightly bound, its energy becomes more negative 
relative to the zero-energy reference state (corresponding to the electron being at 
infinite distance from the nucleus). As the electron is brought closer to the 
nucleus, energy is released from the system.
Using Equation (7.1), we can derive a general equation for the electron moving 
from one level (ninitial) to another level (nfinal):

At first Bohr‚Äôs model appeared to be very promising. The energy levels calculated 
by Bohr closely agreed with the values obtained from the hydrogen emission spec-
trum. However, when Bohr‚Äôs model was applied to atoms other than hydrogen, it did 
not work at all. Although some attempts were made to adapt the model using elliptical 
orbits, it was concluded that Bohr‚Äôs model is fundamentally incorrect. The model is, 
however, very important historically, because it showed that the observed quantization 
of energy in atoms could be explained by making rather simple assumptions. Bohr‚Äôs 
model paved the way for later theories. It is important to realize, however, that the cur-
rent theory of atomic structure is in no way derived from the Bohr model. Electrons do 
not move around the nucleus in circular orbits, as we shall see later in this chapter.
EXAMPLE 7.5
Although Bohr‚Äôs model fits the energy 
levels for hydrogen, it is a fundamentally 
incorrect model for the hydrogen atom.
T
he long-accepted value for the 
radius of the proton is 0.8768 fm 
(fm¬†5¬†10215 m). However, new experi-
ments suggest that this value might be 
about 4% too large. This doesn‚Äôt sound 
like much, but if proven correct it will 
raise havoc in the scientific community.
The possible problem with the 
currently accepted value of the proton 
radius results from work done by 
Randolf Pohl and his coworkers at the 
Max Planck Institute of Quantum 
Optics in Garching, Germany. These 
scientists created an exotic form of 
hydrogen in which they replaced the 
hydrogen electron by a muon. A muon 
is a particle that has the same charge 
as an electron but is 200 times more 
massive than the electron. Because of 
its greater mass, the muon has orbitals 
with smaller average radii than those 
of an electron. The German team 
attempted to excite the muon to 
higher energy levels using laser pulses. 
They set their laser to detect muon 
transitions assuming the proton radius 
was in the range from 0.87 to 0.91 
femtometers (fm), the value expected 
from current theories. After years of 
failing to see the expected energy 
transitions, the German scientists were 
within weeks of shutting down the 
experiment when they decided to 
assume a smaller value for the proton 
radius. They saw the expected transi-
tion when they tuned their laser at a 
value corresponding to a proton radius 
of 0.84184 fm. Although this value 
doesn‚Äôt seem too different from 
0.8768¬†fm, it has tremendous implica-
tions. A change in the radius of the 
proton will affect the value of the 
charge density of the proton, a value 
that affects the values of all of the 
fundamental physical constants since 
all of these constants are interrelated. 
Thus, more experiments are needed to 
determine the correct value of the 
proton radius. If the new, smaller value 
proves to be correct, it has important 
implications for the fundamental 
theory (quantum electrodynamics) 
of¬†matter. Perhaps this will lead to a 
better understanding of nature.

7.5 The Quantum Mechanical Model 
of the Atom
By the mid-1920s it had become apparent that the Bohr model could not be made to 
work. A totally new approach was needed. Three physicists were at the forefront of 
this effort: Werner Heisenberg (1901‚Äì1976), Louis de Broglie (1892‚Äì1987), and 
Erwin Schr√∂dinger (1887‚Äì1961). The approach they developed became known as 
wave mechanics or, more commonly, quantum mechanics. As we have already seen, de 
Broglie originated the idea that the electron, previously considered to be a particle, 
also shows wave properties. Pursuing this line of reasoning, Schr√∂dinger, an Austrian 
physicist, decided to attack the problem of atomic structure by giving emphasis to the 
wave properties of the electron. To Schr√∂dinger and de Broglie, the electron bound to 
the nucleus seemed similar to a standing wave, and they began research on a wave 
mechanical description of the atom.
The most familiar example of standing waves occurs in association with musical 
instruments such as guitars or violins, where a string attached at both ends vibrates to 
produce a musical tone. The waves are described as ‚Äústanding‚Äù because they are sta-
tionary; the waves do not travel along the length of the string. The motions of the string 
can be explained as a combination of simple waves of the type shown in Fig. 7.10. The 
dots in this figure indicate the nodes, or points of zero lateral (sideways) displacement, 
for a given wave. Note that there are limitations on the allowed wavelengths of the 
standing wave. Each end of the string is fixed, so there is always a node at each end. 
This means that there must be a whole number of half wavelengths in any of the 
allowed motions of the string (see Fig. 7.10). Standing waves can be illustrated using 
the wave generator shown in the photo.
A similar situation results when the electron in the hydrogen atom is imagined to be 
a standing wave. As shown in Fig. 7.11, only certain circular orbits have a circumfer-
ence into which a whole number of wavelengths of the standing electron wave will 
‚Äúfit.‚Äù All other orbits would produce destructive interference of the standing electron 
wave and are not allowed. This seemed like a possible explanation for the observed 
quantization of the hydrogen atom, so Schr√∂dinger worked out a model for the hydro-
gen atom in which the electron was assumed to behave as a standing wave.
It is important to recognize that Schr√∂dinger could not be sure that this idea would 
work. The test had to be whether or not the model would correctly fit the experimental 
data on hydrogen and other atoms. The physical principles for describing standing 
waves were well known in 1925 when Schr√∂dinger decided to treat the electron in this 
way. His mathematical treatment is too complicated to be detailed here. However, the 
form of Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs equation is
H^c 5 Ec
where c, called the wave function, is a function of the coordinates (x, y, and z) of 
the electron‚Äôs position in three-dimensional space and H^  represents a set of mathe-
matical instructions called an operator. In this case, the operator contains mathemat-
ical terms that produce the total energy of the atom when they are applied to the 
wave function. E represents the total energy of the atom (the sum of the potential 
energy due to the attraction between the proton and electron and the kinetic energy 
of the moving electron). When this equation is analyzed, many solutions are found.

Each solution consists of a wave function, c, that is characterized by a particular 
value of E. A specific wave function is often called an orbital.
 
To illustrate the most important ideas of the quantum (wave) mechanical model 
of the atom, we will first concentrate on the wave function corresponding to the lowest 
energy for the hydrogen atom. This wave function is called the 1s orbital. The first 
point of interest is to explore the meaning of the word orbital. As we will see, this is 
not a trivial matter. One thing is clear: An orbital is not a Bohr orbit. The electron in 
the hydrogen 1s orbital is not moving around the nucleus in a circular orbit. How, then, 
is the electron moving? The answer is quite surprising: We do not know. The wave 
function gives us no information about the detailed pathway of the electron. This is 
somewhat disturbing. When we solve problems involving the motions of particles in 
the macroscopic world, we are able to predict their pathways. For example, when two 
billiard balls with known velocities collide, we can predict their motions after the col-
lision. However, we cannot predict the electron‚Äôs motion from the 1s orbital function. 
Does this mean that the theory is wrong? Not necessarily: We have already learned that 
an electron does not behave much like a billiard ball, so we must examine the situation 
closely before we discard the theory.
 
To help us understand the nature of an orbital, we need to consider a principle dis-
covered by Werner Heisenberg, one of the primary developers of quantum mechanics. 
Heisenberg‚Äôs mathematical analysis led him to a surprising conclusion: There is a 
fundamental limitation to just how precisely we can know both the position and 
momentum of a particle at a given time. This is a statement of the Heisenberg uncer-
tainty principle. Stated mathematically, the uncertainty principle is
Dx # D1my2 $ h
4p
where Dx is the uncertainty in a particle‚Äôs position, D(my) is the uncertainty in a par-
ticle‚Äôs momentum, and h is Planck‚Äôs constant. Thus the minimum uncertainty in the 
product D x # D1my2  is hy4p. What this equation really says is that the more accurately 
we know a particle‚Äôs position, the less accurately we can know its momentum, and vice 
versa. This limitation is so small for large particles such as baseballs or billiard balls 
that it is unnoticed. However, for a small particle such as the electron, the limitation 
becomes quite important. Applied to the electron, the uncertainty principle implies 
that we cannot know the exact motion of the electron as it moves around the nucleus. 
It is therefore not appropriate to assume that the electron is moving around the nucleus 
in a well-defined orbit, as in the Bohr model.
The Physical Meaning of a Wave Function
Given the limitations indicated by the uncertainty principle, what then is the physical 
meaning of a wave function for an electron? That is, what is an atomic orbital? 
Although the wave function itself has no easily visualized meaning, the square of the 
function does have a definite physical significance. The square of the function indi-
cates the probability of finding an electron near a particular point in space. For exam-
ple, suppose we have two positions in space, one defined by the coordinates x1, y1, and 
z1 and the other by the coordinates x2, y2, and z2. The relative probability of finding the 
electron at positions 1 and 2 is given by substituting the values of x, y, and z for the two 
positions into the wave function, squaring the function value, and computing the fol-
lowing ratio:
3c1x1, y1, z12 42
3c1x2, y2, z22 42 5 N1
N2
The quotient N1yN2 is the ratio of the probabilities of finding the electron at positions¬†1 
and¬†2. For example, if the value of the ratio N1yN2 is 100, the electron is 100¬†times 
more likely to be found at position 1 than at position 2. The model gives no informa-
tion  concerning when the electron will be at either position or how it moves between 
Probability is the likelihood, or odds, that 
something will occur.

destructive interference occurs, as shown 
in (c). This is consistent with the fact that 
only certain electron energies are 
allowed; the atom is quantized. (Although 
this idea encouraged scientists to use a 
wave theory, it does not mean that the 
electron really travels in circular orbits.)

the  positions. This vagueness is consistent with the concept of the Heisenberg uncer-
tainty principle.
 
The square of the wave function is most conveniently represented as a probability 
distribution, in which the intensity of color is used to indicate the probability value 
near a given point in space. The probability distribution for the hydrogen 1s wave func-
tion (orbital) is shown in Fig. 7.12(a). The best way to think about this diagram is as a 
three- dimensional time exposure with the electron as a tiny moving light. The more 
times the electron visits a particular point, the darker the negative becomes. Thus the 
darkness of a point indicates the probability of finding an electron at that position. This 
diagram is also known as an electron density map; electron density and electron prob-
ability mean the same thing. When a chemist uses the term atomic orbital, he or she is 
probably picturing an electron density map of this type.
 
Another way of representing the electron probability distribution for the 1s wave 
function is to calculate the probability at points along a line drawn outward in any 
direction from the nucleus. The result is shown in Fig. 7.12(b). Note that the probabil-
ity of finding the electron at a particular position is greatest close to the nucleus and 
drops off rapidly as the distance from the nucleus increases. We are also interested in 
knowing the total probability of finding the electron in the hydrogen atom at a particu-
lar distance from the nucleus. Imagine that the space around the hydrogen nucleus is 
made up of a series of thin, spherical shells (rather like layers in an onion), as shown 
in Fig. 7.13(a). When the total probability of finding the electron in each spherical 
shell is plotted versus the distance from the nucleus, the plot in Fig. 7.13(b) is obtained. 
This graph is called the radial probability distribution.
 
The maximum in the curve occurs because of two opposing effects. The probability 
of finding an electron at a particular position is greatest near the nucleus, but the vol-
ume of the spherical shell increases with distance from the nucleus. Therefore, as we 
move away from the nucleus, the probability of finding the electron at a given position 
decreases, but we are summing more positions. Thus the total probability increases to 
a certain radius and then decreases as the electron probability at each position becomes 
very small. For the hydrogen 1s orbital, the maximum radial probability (the distance 
at which the electron is most likely to be found) occurs at a distance of 5.29 3 1022¬†nm 
or 0.529 √Ö from the nucleus. Interestingly, this is exactly the radius of the innermost 
orbit in the Bohr model. Note that in Bohr‚Äôs model the electron is assumed to have a 
circular path and so is always found at this distance. In the quantum mechanical model, 
the specific electron motions are unknown, and this is the most probable distance at 
which the electron is found.
 
One more characteristic of the hydrogen 1s orbital that we must consider is its size. 
As we can see from Fig. 7.12, the size of this orbital cannot be defined precisely, since 
the probability never becomes zero (although it drops to an extremely small value at 
large values of r). So, in fact, the hydrogen 1s orbital has no distinct size. However, it 
is useful to have a definition of relative orbital size. The definition most often used by 
chemists to describe the size of the hydrogen 1s orbital is the radius of the sphere that 
encloses 90% of the total electron probability. That is, 90% of the time the electron is 
inside this sphere.
1 √Ö 5 10210 m; the angstrom is most  often 
used as the unit for atomic radius because 
of its convenient size. Another convenient

So far we have described only the lowest-energy wave function in the hydrogen 
atom, the 1s orbital. Hydrogen has many other orbitals, which we will describe in the 
next section. However, before we proceed, we should summarize what we have said 
about the meaning of an atomic orbital. An orbital is difficult to define precisely at an 
introductory level. Technically, an orbital is a wave function. However, it is usually 
most helpful to picture an orbital as a three-dimensional electron density map. That is, 
an electron ‚Äúin‚Äù a particular atomic orbital is assumed to exhibit the electron probabil-
ity indicated by the  orbital map.
7.6 Quantum Numbers
When we solve the Schr√∂dinger equation for the hydrogen atom, we find many wave 
functions (orbitals) that satisfy it. Each of these orbitals is characterized by a series of 
numbers called quantum numbers, which describe various properties of the orbital:
The principal quantum number (n) has integral values: 1, 2, 3, . . . . The principal 
quantum number is related to the size and energy of the orbital. As n increases, 
the orbital becomes larger and the electron spends more time farther from the 
nucleus. An increase in n also means higher energy, because the electron is less 
tightly bound to the nucleus, and the energy is less negative.
The angular momentum quantum number (,) has integral values from 0 to n 2 1 
for each value of n. This quantum number is related to the shape of atomic orbit-
als. The value of , for a particular orbital is commonly assigned a letter: , 5 0 is 
called s; , 5 1 is called p; , 5 2 is called d; , 5 3 is called f. This system arises 
from early spectral studies and is summarized in Table 7.1.
The magnetic quantum number (m,) has integral values between , and 2,, 
including zero. The value of m, is related to the orientation of the orbital in space 
relative to the other orbitals in the atom.
 
The first four levels of orbitals in the hydrogen atom are listed with their quantum 
numbers in Table 7.2. Note that each set of orbitals with a given value of , (some-
times called a subshell) is designated by giving the value of n and the letter for ,. 
Thus an orbital where n 5 2 and , 5 1 is symbolized as 2p. There are three 2p orbit-
als, which have different orientations in space. We will describe these orbitals in the 
next section.

7.7 Orbital Shapes and Energies
We have seen that the meaning of an orbital is represented most clearly by a probabil-
ity distribution. Each orbital in the hydrogen atom has a unique probability distribu-
tion. We also saw that another means of representing an orbital is by the surface that 
surrounds 90% of the total electron probability. These three types of representations 
for the hydrogen 1s, 2s, and 3s orbitals are shown in Fig. 7.14. Note the characteristic 
spherical shape of each of the s orbitals. Note also that the 2s and 3s orbitals contain 
areas of high probability separated by areas of zero probability. These latter areas are 
called nodal  surfaces, or simply nodes. The number of nodes increases as n increases.

For s orbitals, the number of nodes is given by n 2 1. For our purposes, however, we 
will think of s orbitals only in terms of their overall spherical shape, which becomes 
larger as the value of n  increases.
 
The two types of representations for the 2p orbitals (there are no 1p orbitals) are 
shown in Fig. 7.15. Note that the p orbitals are not spherical like s orbitals but have two 
lobes separated by a node at the nucleus. The p orbitals are labeled according to the 
axis of the xyz coordinate system along which the lobes lie. For example, the 2p orbital 
with lobes centered along the x axis is called the 2px orbital.
 
At this point it is useful to remember that mathematical functions have signs. For 
example, a simple sine wave (see Fig. 7.1) oscillates from positive to negative and 
repeats this pattern. Atomic orbital functions also have signs. The functions for s orbit-
als are positive everywhere in three-dimensional space. That is, when the s orbital 
function is evaluated at any point in space, it results in a positive number. In contrast, 
the p orbital functions have different signs in different regions of space. For example, 
the pz orbital has a positive sign in all the regions of space in which z is positive and 
has a negative sign when z is negative. This behavior is indicated in Fig. 7.15(b) by the 
positive and negative signs inside their boundary surfaces. It is important to under-
stand that these are mathematical signs, not charges. Just as a sine wave has alternating 
positive and negative phases, so too p orbitals have positive and negative phases. The 
phases of the px, py, and pz orbitals are indicated in Fig. 7.15(b).
 
As you might expect from our discussion of the s orbitals, the 3p orbitals have a 
more complex probability distribution than that of the 2p orbitals (Fig. 7.16), but they 
can still be represented by the same boundary surface shapes. The surfaces just grow 
larger as the value of n increases.
 
There are no d orbitals that correspond to principal quantum levels n 5 1 and n¬†5¬†2. 
The d orbitals (, 5 2) first occur in level n 5 3. The five 3d orbitals have the shapes 
shown in Fig. 7.17. The d orbitals have two different fundamental shapes. Four of the 
orbitals (dxz, dyz, dxy, and dx22y2) have four lobes centered in the plane indicated in the 
orbital label. Note that dxy and dx22y2 are both centered in the xy plane; however, the lobes 
of dx22y2 lie along the x and y axes, while the lobes of dxy lie between the axes. The fifth 
orbital, dz2, has a unique shape with two lobes along the z axis and a belt centered in the 
xy plane. The d orbitals for levels n . 3 look like the 3d orbitals but have larger lobes.
 
The f orbitals first occur in level n 5 4, and as might be expected, they have shapes 
even more complex than those of the d orbitals. Figure 7.18 shows representations of 
the 4f orbitals (, 5 3) along with their designations. These orbitals are not involved in 
the bonding in any of the compounds we will consider in this text. Their shapes and 
labels are simply included for completeness.

So far we have talked about the shapes of the hydrogen atomic orbitals but not 
about their energies. For the hydrogen atom, the energy of a particular orbital is deter-
mined by its value of n. Thus all orbitals with the same value of n have the same 
energy‚Äîthey are said to be degenerate. This is shown in Fig. 7.19, where the energies 
for the orbitals in the first three quantum levels for hydrogen are shown.
 
Hydrogen‚Äôs single electron can occupy any of its atomic orbitals. However, in the 
lowest energy state, the ground state, the electron resides in the 1s orbital. If energy is 
put into the atom, the electron can be transferred to a higher-energy orbital, producing 
an excited state.

LET‚ÄôS REVIEW  A Summary of the Hydrogen Atom
 ¬ª In the quantum (wave) mechanical model, the electron is viewed as a standing wave. This 
representation leads to a series of wave functions (orbitals) that describe the possible 
energies and spatial distributions available to the electron.
 ¬ª In agreement with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the model cannot specify 
the detailed electron motions. Instead, the square of the wave function represents the 
probability distribution of the electron in that orbital. This allows us to picture orbitals in 
terms of probability distributions, or electron density maps.
 ¬ª The size of an orbital is arbitrarily defined as the surface that contains 90% of the total 
electron probability.
 ¬ª The hydrogen atom has many types of orbitals. In the ground state, the single electron 
resides in the 1s orbital. The electron can be excited to higher-energy orbitals if energy is 
put into the atom.
7.8 Electron Spin and the Pauli 
Principle
The concept of electron spin was developed by Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlen-
beck while they were graduate students at the University of Leyden in the Netherlands. 
They found that a fourth quantum number (in addition to n, ,, and m,) was necessary 
to account for the details of the emission spectra of atoms. The spectral data indicate 
that the electron has a magnetic moment with two possible orientations when the atom 
is placed in an external magnetic field. Since they knew from classical physics that a 
spinning charge produces a magnetic moment, it seemed reasonable to assume that the 
electron could have two spin states, thus producing the two oppositely directed mag-
netic  moments (Fig. 7.20). The new quantum number adopted to describe this phe-
nomenon, called the electron spin quantum number (ms), can have only one of two 
values, 11
2 and 21
2. We can interpret this to mean that the electron can spin in one of 
two opposite directions, although other interpretations also have been suggested.
 
For our purposes, the main significance of electron spin is connected with the postulate 
of Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli (1900‚Äì1958): In a given atom no two electrons 
can have the same set of four quantum numbers (n, <, m<, and ms). This is called the 
Pauli exclusion principle. Since electrons in the same orbital have the same values of 
n,¬†,, and¬†m,, this postulate says that they must have different values of ms. Then, since 
only two values of ms are allowed, an orbital can hold only two electrons, and they must 
have opposite spins. This principle will have important consequences as we  use the 
atomic model to account for the electron arrangements of the atoms in the periodic table.

7.9 Polyelectronic Atoms
The quantum mechanical model gives a description of the hydrogen atom that agrees 
very well with experimental data. However, the model would not be very useful if it 
did not account for the properties of all the other atoms as well.
To see how the model applies to polyelectronic atoms, that is, atoms with more 
than one electron, let‚Äôs consider helium, which has two protons in its nucleus and two 
electrons:
e2
21 e2
Three energy contributions must be considered in the description of the helium atom: 
(1) the kinetic energy of the electrons as they move around the nucleus, (2) the poten-
tial energy of attraction between the nucleus and the electrons, and (3) the potential 
energy of repulsion between the two electrons.
Although the helium atom can be readily described in terms of the quantum 
mechanical model, the Schr√∂dinger equation that results cannot be solved exactly. The 
difficulty arises in dealing with the repulsions between the electrons. Since the elec-
tron pathways are unknown, the electron repulsions cannot be calculated exactly. This 
is called the electron correlation problem.
The electron correlation problem occurs with all polyelectronic atoms. To treat 
these systems using the quantum mechanical model, we must make approximations. 
Most commonly, the approximation used is to treat each electron as if it were moving 
in a field of charge that is the net result of the nuclear attraction and the average repul-
sions of all the other electrons.
For example, consider the sodium atom, which has 11 electrons:
l l+
l le‚àí
Now let‚Äôs single out the outermost electron and consider the forces this electron feels. 
The electron clearly is attracted to the highly charged nucleus. However, the electron 
also feels the repulsions caused by the other 10 electrons. The net effect is that the 
electron is not bound nearly as tightly to the nucleus as it would be if the other elec-
trons were not present. We say that the electron is screened or shielded from the nuclear 
charge by the repulsions of the other electrons.
This picture of polyelectronic atoms leads to hydrogen-like orbitals for these atoms. 
They have the same general shapes as the orbitals for hydrogen, but their sizes and 
energies are different. The differences occur because of the interplay between nuclear 
attraction and the electron repulsions.
One especially important difference between polyelectronic atoms and the hydro-
gen atom is that for hydrogen all the orbitals in a given principal quantum level have 
the same energy (they are said to be degenerate). This is not the case for polyelectronic 
atoms, where we find that for a given principal quantum level the orbitals vary in 
energy as  follows:
Ens , Enp , End , Enf
In other words, when electrons are placed in a particular quantum level, they ‚Äúpre-
fer‚Äù the orbitals in the order s, p, d, and then f. Why does this happen? Although the 
concept of orbital energies is a complicated matter, we can qualitatively understand

why the 2s orbital has a lower energy than the 2p orbital in a polyelectronic atom by 
looking at the probability profiles of these orbitals (Fig. 7.21). Notice that the 2p 
orbital has its maximum probability closer to the nucleus than for the 2s. This might 
lead us to predict that the 2p would be preferable (lower energy) to the 2s orbital. 
However, notice the small hump of electron density that occurs in the 2s profile very 
near the nucleus. This means that although an electron in the 2s orbital spends most of 
its time a little farther from the nucleus than does an electron in the 2p orbital, it spends 
a small but very significant amount of time very near the nucleus. We say that the 2s 
electron penetrates to the nucleus more than once in the 2p orbital. This penetration 
effect causes an electron in a 2s orbital to be attracted to the nucleus more strongly than 
an electron in a 2p orbital. That is, the 2s orbital is lower in energy than the 2p orbitals 
in a polyelectronic atom.
 
The same thing happens in the other principal quantum levels as well. Fig-
ure¬†7.22 shows the radial probability profiles for the 3s, 3p, and 3d orbitals. Note 
again the hump in the 3s profile very near the nucleus. The innermost hump for the 
3p is farther out, which causes the energy of the 3s orbital to be lower than that of 
the 3p. Notice that the 3d orbital has its maximum probability closer to the nucleus 
than either the 3s or 3p does, but its absence of probability near the nucleus causes 
it to be highest in energy of the three orbitals. The relative energies of the orbitals 
for n¬†5¬†3 are
E3s , E3p , E3d
In general, the more effectively an orbital allows its electron to penetrate the shield-
ing electrons to be close to the nuclear charge, the lower is the energy of that 
orbital.
 
A summary diagram of the orders of the orbital energies for polyelectronic atoms is 
represented in Fig. 7.23. We will use these orbitals in Section 7.11 to show how the 
electrons are arranged in polyelectronic atoms.

7.10 The History of the Periodic Table
The modern periodic table contains a tremendous amount of useful information. In 
this section we will discuss the origin of this valuable tool; later we will see how the 
quantum mechanical model for the atom explains the periodicity of chemical proper-
ties. Certainly the greatest triumph of the quantum mechanical model is its ability to 
account for the arrangement of the elements in the periodic table.
The periodic table was originally constructed to represent the patterns observed in 
the chemical properties of the elements. As chemistry progressed during the eigh-
teenth and nineteenth centuries, it became evident that the earth is composed of a great 
many  elements with very different properties. Things are much more complicated than 
the simple model of earth, air, fire, and water suggested by the ancients. At first, the 
array of  elements and properties was bewildering. Gradually, however, patterns were 
noticed.
The first chemist to recognize patterns was Johann Dobereiner (1780‚Äì1849), who 
found several groups of three elements that have similar properties, for example, chlo-
rine, bromine, and iodine. However, as Dobereiner attempted to expand this model of 
triads (as he called them) to the rest of the known elements, it became clear that it was 
severely limited.
The next notable attempt was made by the English chemist John Newlands, who in 
1864 suggested that elements should be arranged in octaves, based on the idea that 
certain properties seemed to repeat for every eighth element in a way similar to the 
musical scale, which repeats for every eighth tone. Even though this model managed 
to group several elements with similar properties, it was not generally successful.
The present form of the periodic table was conceived independently by two chem-
ists: the German Julius Lothar Meyer (1830‚Äì1895) and Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev 
(1834‚Äì1907), a Russian (Fig. 7.24). Usually Mendeleev is given most of the credit, 
because it was he who emphasized how useful the table could be in predicting the 
existence and properties of still unknown elements. For example, in 1872 when 
Mendeleev first published his table (Fig. 7.25), the elements gallium, scandium, and 
germanium were unknown. Mendeleev correctly predicted the existence and proper-
ties of these elements from gaps in his periodic table. The data for germanium (which 
Mendeleev called ekasilicon) are shown in Table 7.3. Note the excellent agreement 
between the actual values and Mendeleev‚Äôs predictions, which were based on the prop-
erties of other members in the group of elements similar to germanium.
Using his table, Mendeleev also was able to correct several values for atomic 
masses. For example, the original atomic mass of 76 for indium was based on the 
assumption that indium oxide had the formula InO. This atomic mass placed indium, 
which has metallic properties, among the nonmetals. Mendeleev assumed the atomic 
mass was probably incorrect and proposed that the formula of indium oxide was 
7.10
FIGURE 7.24 Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev (1834‚Äì1907), born in Siberia as the youngest of 
17¬†children, taught chemistry at the University of St. Petersburg. In 1860 Mendeleev heard the Italian 
chemist Cannizzaro lecture on a reliable method for determining the correct atomic masses of the 
elements. This  important development paved the way for Mendeleev‚Äôs own brilliant contribution 
to¬†chemistry‚Äîthe periodic table. In 1861 Mendeleev returned to St. Petersburg, where he wrote a 
book on organic chemistry. Later Mendeleev also wrote a book on inorganic chemistry, and he was 
struck by the fact that the systematic approach characterizing organic chemistry was lacking in 
inorganic chemistry. In attempting to systematize inorganic chemistry, he eventually arranged the 
elements in the form of the periodic table.
 
Mendeleev was a versatile genius who was interested in many fields of science. He worked on 
many problems associated with Russia‚Äôs natural resources, such as coal, salt, and various metals. 
Being particularly interested in the petroleum industry, he visited the United States in 1876 to study 
the Pennsylvania oil fields. His interests also included meteorology and hot-air balloons. In 1887 he 
made an ascent in a balloon to study a total eclipse of the sun.

really In2O3. Based on this correct formula, indium has an atomic mass of approxi-
mately¬†113, placing the element among the metals. Mendeleev also corrected the 
atomic masses of beryllium and uranium.
 
Because of its obvious usefulness, Mendeleev‚Äôs periodic table was almost univer-
sally adopted, and it remains one of the most valuable tools at the chemist‚Äôs disposal. 
For example, it is still used to predict the properties of elements recently discovered, 
as shown in Table 7.4.
 
A current version of the periodic table is shown inside the front cover of this book. 
The only fundamental difference between this table and that of Mendeleev is that it 
lists the elements in order by atomic number rather than by atomic mass. The reason 
for this will become clear later in this chapter as we explore the electron arrangements 
of the atom. Another recent format of the table is discussed in the following section.

7.11 The Aufbau Principle 
and the Periodic Table
We can use the quantum mechanical model of the atom to show how the electron 
arrangements in the hydrogen-like atomic orbitals of the various atoms account for the 
organization of the periodic table. Our main assumption here is that all atoms have the 
same type of orbitals as have been described for the hydrogen atom. As protons are 
added one by one to the nucleus to build up the elements, electrons are similarly 
added to these hydrogen-like orbitals. This is called the aufbau principle.
Hydrogen has one electron, which occupies the 1s orbital in its ground state. The 
configuration for hydrogen is written as 1s1, which can be represented by the following 
 orbital diagram:
H: 1s1
1s
2s
2p
The arrow represents an electron spinning in a particular direction.
The next element, helium, has two electrons. Since two electrons with opposite 
spins can occupy an orbital, according to the Pauli exclusion principle, the electrons 
for helium are in the 1s orbital with opposite spins, producing a 1s2 configuration:
He: 1s2
1s
2s
2p
Lithium has three electrons, two of which can go into the 1s orbital before the 
orbital is filled. Since the 1s orbital is the only orbital for n 5 1, the third electron 
will occupy the lowest-energy orbital with n 5 2, or the 2s orbital, giving a 1s22s1 
configuration:
Li: 1s22s1
1s
2s
2p
 
The next element, beryllium, has four electrons, which occupy the 1s and 
2s¬†orbitals:
Be: 1s22s2
1s
2s
2p
 
Boron has five electrons, four of which occupy the 1s and 2s orbitals. The fifth 
electron goes into the second type of orbital with n 5 2, the 2p orbitals:
1s
2s
2p
B: 1s22s22p1
Since all the 2p orbitals have the same energy (are degenerate), it does not matter 
which 2p orbital the electron occupies.
 
Carbon is the next element and has six electrons. Two electrons occupy the 
1s¬†orbital, two occupy the 2s orbital, and two occupy 2p orbitals. Since there are three 
2p¬†orbitals with the same energy, the mutually repulsive electrons will occupy sepa-
rate 2p orbitals. This behavior is summarized by Hund‚Äôs rule (named for the German 
physicist F. H. Hund): The lowest energy configuration for an atom is the one hav-
ing the maximum number of unpaired electrons allowed by the Pauli principle in 
a particular set of degenerate orbitals. By convention, the unpaired electrons are 
represented as having parallel spins (with spin ‚Äúup‚Äù).
 
The configuration for carbon could be written 1s22s22p12p1 to indicate that the elec-
trons occupy separate 2p orbitals. However, the configuration is usually given as

etc.
(Z 5 atomic number)
For an atom with unfilled subshells, the 
lowest energy is achieved by electrons 
occupying separate orbitals with parallel 
spins, as far as allowed by the Pauli 
exclusion principle.

diagram for carbon is
1s
2s
2p
C: 1s22s22p2
Note that the unpaired electrons in the 2p orbitals are shown with parallel spins.
 
The configuration for nitrogen, which has seven electrons, is 1s22s22p3. The three 
electrons in the 2p orbitals occupy separate orbitals with parallel spins:
1s
2s
2p
N: 1s22s22p3
The configuration for oxygen, which has eight electrons, is 1s22s22p4. One of the 2p 
orbitals is now occupied by a pair of electrons with opposite spins, as required by the 
Pauli exclusion principle:
1s
2s
2p
O: 1s22s22p4
The orbital diagrams and electron configurations for fluorine (nine electrons) and 
neon (ten electrons) are as follows:
1s
2s
2p
Ne: 1s22s22p6
1s22s22p5
F:
With neon, the orbitals with n 5 1 and n 5 2 are now completely filled.
 
For sodium, the first ten electrons occupy the 1s, 2s, and 2p orbitals, and the elev-
enth electron must occupy the first orbital with n 5 3, the 3s orbital. The electron 
configuration for sodium is 1s22s22p63s1. To avoid writing the inner-level electrons, 
this configuration is often abbreviated as [Ne]3s1, where [Ne] represents the electron 
configuration of neon, 1s22s22p6.
 
The next element, magnesium, has the configuration 1s22s22p63s2, or [Ne]3s2. Then the 
next six elements, aluminum through argon, have configurations obtained by filling the 3p 
orbitals one electron at a time. Figure 7.26 summarizes the electron configurations of the 
first 18 elements by giving the number of electrons in the type of orbital  occupied last.
[Ne] is shorthand for 1s22s22p6.
A
lthough element 112 is not 
exactly a newborn (it was 
discovered in 1996), it has recently 
been given a name. The Interna-
tional Union of Pure and Applied 
Chemistry announced on February 
19, 2010, that the official name of 112 
is Copernicium (pronounced koh-
pur-NEE-see-um) and has the sym-
bol Cn. The name honors Nicolaus 
Copernicus, who is best known for 
first recognizing that the planetary 
system is sun-centered rather than 
Earth-centered.
Now scientists from the Paul Sherrer 
Institute in Switzerland and the Joint 
Institute for Nuclear Research in Russia 
have studied the properties of Cn. By 
firing a beam of 48Ca projectiles at a 
target of 242Pu (doped with Nd2O3), these 
scientists have produced just two atoms 
of Cn. Given the relatively long lifetime 
of Cn atoms (a few seconds), the 
researchers have been able to compare 
the properties of Cn, Hg, and Ar atoms. 
When these atoms were injected into a 
series of gold-covered detectors, it was 
found that, similar to Hg (and in contrast 
to Ar), Cn atoms were ‚Äúmildly‚Äù volatile 
and readily formed bonds with gold. 
Thus, as predicted by the periodic table, 
the element Cn, which has an expected 
electron configuration of [Rn]7s26d10, fits 
with the Zn, Cd, and Hg group of ele-
ments, all of which have the ns2(n21)d10 
configuration.

At this point it is useful to introduce the concept of valence electrons, the electrons 
in the outermost principal quantum level of an atom. The valence electrons of the 
nitrogen atom, for example, are the 2s and 2p electrons. For the sodium atom, the 
valence electron is the electron in the 3s orbital, and so on. Valence electrons are 
the¬†most important electrons to chemists because they are involved in bonding, as we 
will see in the next two chapters. The inner electrons are known as core electrons.
 
Note in Fig. 7.26 that a very important pattern is developing: The elements in the 
same group (vertical column of the periodic table) have the same valence electron 
 configuration. Remember that Mendeleev originally placed the elements in groups 
based on similarities in chemical properties. Now we understand the reason behind 
these groupings. Elements with the same valence electron configuration show similar 
chemical behavior.
 
The element after argon is potassium. Since the 3p orbitals are fully occupied in 
argon, we might expect the next electron to go into a 3d orbital (recall that for n 5 3 
the orbitals are 3s, 3p, and 3d). However, the chemistry of potassium is clearly very 
similar to that of lithium and sodium, indicating that the last electron in potassium 
occupies the 4s orbital instead of one of the 3d orbitals, a conclusion confirmed by 
many types of  experiments. The electron configuration of potassium is
K:¬†¬†1s22s22p63s23p64s1¬†¬†¬†¬†or¬†¬†¬†¬†3Ar44s1
 
The next element is calcium:
Ca:¬†¬†3Ar44s2
 
The next element, scandium, begins a series of 10 elements (scandium through 
zinc) called the transition metals, whose configurations are obtained by adding elec-
trons to the five 3d orbitals. The configuration of scandium is
Sc:¬†¬†3Ar44s23d1
That of titanium is
Ti:¬†¬†3Ar44s23d2
And that of vanadium is
V:¬†¬†3Ar44s23d3
 
Chromium is the next element. The expected configuration is [Ar]4s23d4. However, 
the observed configuration is
Cr:¬†¬†3Ar44s13d5
The explanation for this configuration of chromium is beyond the scope of this book. 
In fact, chemists are still disagreeing over the exact cause of this anomaly. Note, how-
ever, that the observed configuration has both the 4s and 3d orbitals half-filled. This is 
a good way to remember the correct configuration.
 
The next four elements, manganese through nickel, have the expected configurations:
Mn:¬†¬† 3Ar44s23d 5¬†¬†¬†¬†Co:¬†¬† 3Ar44s23d7

The configuration for copper is expected to be [Ar]4s23d 9. However, the observed 
configuration is
Cu:¬†¬†3Ar44s13d10
In this case, a half-filled 4s orbital and a filled set of 3d orbitals characterize the actual 
configuration.
 
Zinc has the expected configuration:

can be explained by the penetration effect. For example, the 4s orbital allows for 
so much more penetration to the vicinity of the nucleus that it becomes lower in 
energy than the 3d orbital. Thus, the 4s fills before the 3d. The same things can 
be said about the 5s and 4d, the 6s and 5d, and the 7s and 6d orbitals.
2. After lanthanum, which has the configuration [Xe]6s25d1, a group of 14 elements 
called the lanthanide series, or the lanthanides, occurs. This series of elements 
corresponds to the filling of the seven 4f orbitals. Note that sometimes an elec-
tron occupies a 5d orbital instead of a 4f orbital. This occurs because the energies 
of the 4f and 5d orbitals are very similar.
3. After actinium, which has the configuration [Rn]7s26d1, a group of 14 elements 
called the actinide series, or the actinides, occurs. This series corresponds to the 
filling of the seven 5f orbitals. Note that sometimes one or two electrons occupy 
the 6d orbitals instead of the 5f orbitals, because these orbitals have very similar 
energies.
4. The group labels for Groups 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, 6A, 7A, and 8A indicate the 
total number of valence electrons for the atoms in these groups. For example, all 
Lanthanides are elements in which the  
4f orbitals are being filled.
Actinides are elements in which the 5f 
orbitals are being filled.
The group label tells the total number of 
valence electrons for that group.

the elements in Group 5A have the configuration ns2np3. (The d electrons fill one 
period late and are usually not counted as valence electrons.) The meaning of the 
group labels for the transition metals is not as clear as for the Group A elements, 
and these will not be used in this text.
5. The groups labeled 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, 6A, 7A, and 8A are often called the 
main-group, or representative, elements. Every member of these groups has 
the same valence electron configuration.
CRITICAL THINKING You have learned that each orbital 
is allowed two electrons, and this pattern is evident on the periodic table. 
What if each orbital was allowed three electrons? How would this change the 
appearance of the periodic table?
 
The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), a body of scien-
tists organized to standardize scientific conventions, has recommended a new form for 
the periodic table, which the American Chemical Society has adopted (see the blue 
numbers in Fig. 7.29). In this new version, the group number indicates the number of 
s, p, and d electrons added since the last noble gas. We will not use the new format in 
this book, but you should be aware that the familiar periodic table may be soon replaced 
by this or a similar format.
 
The results considered in this section are very important. We have seen that the 
quantum mechanical model can be used to explain the arrangement of the elements in 
the periodic table. This model allows us to understand that the similar chemistry exhib-
ited by the members of a given group arises from the fact that they all have the same 
valence electron configuration. Only the principal quantum number of the valence 
orbitals changes in going down a particular group.
 
It is important to be able to give the electron configuration for each of the main-
group elements. This is most easily done by using the periodic table. If you understand 
how the table is organized, it is not necessary to memorize the order in which the orbit-
als fill.  Review Figs. 7.28 and 7.29 to make sure that you understand the correspon-
dence between the orbitals and the periods and groups.
 
Predicting the configurations of the transition metals (3d, 4d, and 5d elements), the 
lanthanides (4f elements), and the actinides (5f elements) is somewhat more difficult 
 because there are many exceptions of the type encountered in the first-row transition 
metals (the 3d elements). You should memorize the configurations of chromium and 
copper, the two exceptions in the first-row transition metals, since these elements are 
often encountered.
Electron Configurations
Give the electron configurations for sulfur (S), cadmium (Cd), hafnium (Hf), and 
radium (Ra) using the periodic table inside the front cover of this book.
 
SOLUTION 
Sulfur is element 16 and resides in Period 3, where the 3p orbitals are being filled (Fig. 
7.30). Since sulfur is the fourth among the ‚Äú3p elements,‚Äù it must have four 3p elec-
trons. Its configuration is
S:¬†¬†1s22s22p63s23p4¬†¬†or¬†¬†3Ne43s23p4
 
Cadmium is element 48 and is located in Period 5 at the end of the 4d transition 
metals (Fig. 7.30). It is the tenth element in the series and thus has 10 electrons in the 
4d orbitals, in addition to the 2 electrons in the 5s orbital. The configuration is
Cd:¬†¬†1s22s22p63s23p64s23d104p65s24d10¬†¬†or¬†¬†3Kr45s24d10
When an electron configuration is given in 
this text, the orbitals are listed in the order 
in which they fill.

Hafnium is element 72 and is found in Period 6 (Fig. 7.30). Note that it occurs just 
after the lanthanide series. Thus the 4f orbitals are already filled. Hafnium is the sec-
ond member of the 5d transition series and has two 5d electrons. The configuration is
‚ñ† Hf:¬†¬†1s22s22p63s23p64s23d104p65s24d105p66s24f145d2¬†¬†or¬†¬†3Xe46s24f 145d2
Radium is element 88 and is in Period 7 (and Group 2A) (Fig. 7.30). Thus radium 
has two electrons in the 7s orbital, and the configuration is
‚ñ† Ra:¬†¬†1s22s22p63s23p64s23d104p65s24d105p66s24f145d106p67s2¬†¬†or¬†¬†3Rn47s2

7.12 Periodic Trends in Atomic 
Properties
We have developed a fairly complete picture of polyelectronic atoms. Although the 
model is rather crude because the nuclear attractions and electron repulsions are sim-
ply lumped together, it is very successful in accounting for the periodic table of ele-
ments. We will next use the model to account for the observed trends in several 
important atomic properties: ionization energy, electron affinity, and atomic size.
Ionization Energy
Ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from a gaseous atom 
or ion:
X1g2 h X11g2 1 e2
where the atom or ion is assumed to be in its ground state.
To introduce some of the characteristics of ionization energy, we will consider the 
energy required to remove several electrons in succession from aluminum in the gas-
eous state. The ionization energies are
 Al1g2 h Al11g2 1 e2¬†¬†¬†¬†  I1 5 580 kJ/mol
 Al11g2 h Al211g2 1 e2¬†¬†¬†¬† I2 5 1815 kJ/mol
 Al211g2 h Al311g2 1 e2¬†¬†¬†¬† I3 5 2740 kJ/mol
 Al311g2 h Al411g2 1 e2¬†¬†¬†¬† I4 5 11,600 kJ/mol
Ionization energy results in the formation 
of a positive ion.

Several important points can be illustrated from these results. In a stepwise ionization 
process, it is always the highest-energy electron (the one bound least tightly) that is 
removed first. The first ionization energy I1 is the energy required to remove the 
highest-energy electron of an atom. The first electron removed from the aluminum 
atom comes from the 3p orbital (Al has the electron configuration [Ne]3s23p1). The 
second electron comes from the 3s orbital (since Al1 has the configuration [Ne]3s2). 
Note that the value of I1 is considerably smaller than the value of I2, the second ioniza-
tion energy.
 
This makes sense for several reasons. The primary factor is simply charge. Note 
that the first electron is removed from a neutral atom (Al), whereas the second electron 
is removed from a 11 ion (Al1). The increase in positive charge binds the electrons 
more firmly, and the ionization energy increases. The observation that the attraction 
between charged species is related to the magnitude of their charges is known as Cou-
lomb‚Äôs law, and we will revisit this law when we discuss the formation of ionic com-
pounds in Chapter 8. The same trend shows up in the third (I3) and fourth (I4) ionization 
energies, where the electron is removed from the Al21 and Al31 ions, respectively.
 
The increase in successive ionization energies for an atom also can be interpreted 
using our simple model for polyelectronic atoms. The increase in ionization energy 
from I1 to I2 makes sense because the first electron is removed from a 3p orbital that is 
higher in energy than the 3s orbital from which the second electron is removed. The 
largest jump in ionization energy by far occurs in going from the third ionization 
energy (I3) to the fourth (I4). This is so because I4 corresponds to removing a core 
electron (Al31 has the configuration 1s22s22p6), and core electrons are bound much 
more tightly than valence electrons.
 
Table 7.5 gives the values of ionization energies for all the Period 3 elements. Note 
the large jump in energy in each case in going from removal of valence electrons to 
removal of core electrons.
 
The values of the first ionization energies for the elements in the first six periods of 
the periodic table are graphed in Fig. 7.31. Note that in general as we go across a 
period from left to right, the first ionization energy increases. This is consistent with 
the idea that electrons added in the same principal quantum level do not completely 
shield the increasing nuclear charge caused by the added protons. With an increasing 
nuclear charge, the attraction for electrons is greater, as predicted by Coulomb‚Äôs law. 
Thus electrons in the same principal quantum level are generally more strongly bound 
as we move to the right on the periodic table, and there is a general increase in ioniza-
tion energy values as electrons are added to a given principal quantum level.

On the other hand, first ionization energy decreases in going down a group. This 
can be seen most clearly by focusing on the Group 1A elements (the alkali metals) and 
the Group 8A elements (the noble gases), as shown in Table 7.6. The main reason for 
the  decrease in ionization energy in going down a group is that the electrons being 
removed are, on average, farther from the nucleus. As n increases, the size of the 
orbital increases, and the electron is easier to remove.
 
In Fig. 7.31 we see that there are some discontinuities in ionization energy in going 
across a period. For example, for Period 2, discontinuities occur in going from beryl-
lium to boron and from nitrogen to oxygen. These exceptions to the normal trend can 
be explained in terms of electron repulsions. The decrease in ionization energy in 
going from beryllium to boron reflects the fact that the electrons in the filled 2s orbital 
provide some shielding for electrons in the 2p orbital from the nuclear charge. The 
decrease in ionization energy in going from nitrogen to oxygen reflects the extra elec-
tron repulsions in the doubly occupied oxygen 2p orbital.
 
The ionization energies for the representative elements are summarized in Fig. 7.32.

Trends in Ionization Energies
The first ionization energy for phosphorus is 1060 kJ/mol, and that for sulfur is 
1005 kJ/mol. Why?
 
SOLUTION 
Phosphorus and sulfur are neighboring elements in Period 3 of the periodic table and 
have the following valence electron configurations: Phosphorus is 3s23p3, and sulfur 
is 3s23p4.
 
Ordinarily, the first ionization energy increases as we go across a period, so we 
might expect sulfur to have a greater ionization energy than phosphorus. However, 
in this case the fourth p electron in sulfur must be placed in an already occupied 
orbital. The electron‚Äìelectron repulsions that result cause this electron to be more 
easily removed than might be expected.
See Exercises 7.119 and 7.120
Ionization Energies
Consider atoms with the following electron configurations:
 1s22s22p6
 1s22s22p63s1
 1s22s22p63s2
Which atom has the largest first ionization energy, and which one has the smallest 
second ionization energy? Explain your choices.
 
SOLUTION 
The atom with the largest value of I1 is the one with the configuration 1s22s22p6 (this is the 
neon atom), because this element is found at the right end of Period 2. Since the 2p 
electrons do not shield each other very effectively, I1 will be relatively large. The other 
configurations given include 3s electrons. These electrons are effectively shielded by 
the core electrons and are farther from the nucleus than the 2p electrons in neon. Thus 
I1 for these atoms will be smaller than for neon.
 
The atom with the smallest value of I2 is the one with the configuration 1s22s22p63s2 
(the magnesium atom). For magnesium, both I1 and I2 involve valence electrons. For 
the atom with the configuration 1s22s22p63s1 (sodium), the second electron lost (cor-
responding to I2) is a core electron (from a 2p orbital).
See Exercises 7.121 and 7.122
Photoelectron Spectroscopy (PES) for Atoms
We have seen general trends in ionization energy across rows and down columns of the 
periodic table. But how do we measure ionization energies? Recall from our discus-
sion of the photoelectric effect (see Section 7.2) that electrons can be ejected from a 
metal by shining light of sufficient energy on its surface. By gradually increasing the 
energy of the light used, we can determine the exact energy of the photon required to 
eject an electron and thus determine the binding energy of the electrons in the solid 
metal. A similar technique, called photoelectron spectroscopy (PES), can be used to

kinetic energies of the ejected electrons are measured. From this information we can 
determine the energy of the electron in the atom or molecule since:
Energy of electron 5 energy of photons used 2 kinetic energy of the electron
or
Eelectron 5 hn 2 KE
Helium gas usually is used as the source of high-energy photons in PES because, 
when excited, helium atoms emit photons with a wavelength of 58.4 nm (21.2 eV). 
These very-high-energy photons are energetic enough to eject electrons from many 
common atoms and molecules.
PES is useful for studying the electron energy levels of atoms. Usually PES is used 
to analyze for the presence of specific elements in samples by identifying known bind-
ing energies. For example, the O1s electrons occur in the PES spectrum at 530 eV and 
C1s appears at 285 eV. We can imagine an idealized schematic PES spectrum of an 
element such as phosphorus shown in Fig. 7.33. Because the actual spectrum is very 
complex and hard for a nonexpert to interpret, we have represented the data from the 
PES spectrum in a very simple manner. Note that the area of each peak is proportional 
to the number of electrons that have that particular energy.
The first ionization energies we have reported (such as shown in Fig. 7.32), are the 
binding energies of the most easily removed electron from a given atom. We can see 
how the trends we have discussed are consistent with PES data by considering an 
overlay of idealized spectra of boron and fluorine as shown in Fig. 7.34. Notice that the 
binding energy of the most easily removed electron from boron is less than that for 
fluorine, which matches the expected trend. In addition, the values of these binding 
energies are the same as the first ionization energies we have reported.
Electron Affinity
Electron affinity is the energy change associated with the addition of an electron to a 
gaseous atom:
X1g2 1 e2 h X21g2
Because two different conventions have been used, there is a good deal of confusion 
in the chemical literature about the signs for electron affinity values. Electron affinity 
has been defined in many textbooks as the energy released when an electron is added 
to a gaseous atom. This convention requires that a positive sign be attached to an 
exothermic addition of an electron to an atom, which opposes normal thermodynamic 
See Appendix 3 for further discussion on 
spectroscopy and various spectroscopic 
techniques.
Electron affinity is associated with the 
production of a negative ion.
The sign convention for electron affinity 
values follows the convention for energy 
changes used in Chapter 6.

conventions. Therefore, in this book we define electron affinity as a change in energy, 
which means that if the addition of the electron is exothermic, the corresponding 
value for electron affinity will carry a negative sign.
 
Figure 7.35 shows the electron affinity values for the atoms among the first 20 ele-
ments that form stable, isolated negative ions‚Äîthat is, the atoms that undergo the 
addition of an electron as shown above. As expected, all these elements have negative 
(exothermic) electron affinities. Note that the more negative the energy, the greater the 
quantity of energy released. Although electron affinities generally become more nega-
tive from left to right across a period, there are several exceptions to this rule in each 
period. The dependence of electron affinity on atomic number can be explained by 
considering the changes in electron repulsions as a function of electron configurations. 
For example, the fact that the nitrogen atom does not form a stable, isolated N2(g) ion, 
whereas carbon forms C2(g), reflects the difference in the electron configurations of 
these atoms. An electron added to nitrogen (1s22s22p3) to form the N2(g) ion (1s22s22p4) 
would have to occupy a 2p orbital that already contains one electron. The extra repul-
sion between the electrons in this doubly occupied orbital causes N2(g) to be unstable. 
When an electron is added to carbon (1s22s22p2) to form the C2(g) ion (1s22s22p3), no 
such extra repulsions occur.
 
In contrast to the nitrogen atom, the oxygen atom can add one electron to form the 
stable O2(g) ion. Presumably oxygen‚Äôs greater nuclear charge compared with that of 
nitrogen is sufficient to overcome the repulsion associated with putting a second elec-
tron into an already occupied 2p orbital. However, it should be noted that a second 
electron cannot be added to an oxygen atom [O2(g) 1 e2 yn O22(g)] to form an 
isolated oxide ion. This outcome seems strange in view of the many stable oxide com-
pounds (MgO, Fe2O3, and so on) that are known. As we will discuss in detail in Chap-
ter 8, the O22 ion is stabilized in ionic compounds by the large attractions that occur 
among the positive ions and the oxide ions.
 
When we go down a group, electron affinity should become more positive (less 
energy released), since the electron is added at increasing distances from the nucleus. 
Although this is generally the case, the changes in electron affinity in going down most 
groups are relatively small, and numerous exceptions occur. This behavior is demon-
strated by the electron affinities of the Group 7A elements (the halogens) shown in 
Table 7.7. Note that the range of values is quite small compared with the changes that 
typically occur across a period. Also note that although chlorine, bromine, and iodine 
show the expected trend, the energy released when an electron is added to fluorine is 
smaller than might be expected. This smaller energy release has been attributed to the 
small size of the 2p orbitals. Because the electrons must be very close together in these 
orbitals, there are unusually large electron‚Äìelectron repulsions. In the other halogens 
with their larger orbitals, the repulsions are not as severe.
Atomic Radius
Just as the size of an orbital cannot be specified exactly, neither can the size of an atom. 
We must make some arbitrary choices to obtain values for atomic radii. These values 
can be obtained by measuring the distances between atoms in chemical compounds.

For example, in the bromine molecule, the distance between the two nuclei is known 
to be 228 pm. The bromine atomic radius is assumed to be half this distance, or 114¬†pm 
(Fig. 7.36). These radii are often called covalent atomic radii because of the way they 
are determined (from the distances between atoms in covalent bonds).
 
For nonmetallic atoms that do not form diatomic molecules, the atomic radii are 
estimated from their various covalent compounds. The radii for metal atoms (called 
metallic radii) are obtained from half the distance between metal atoms in solid metal 
crystals.
 
The values of the atomic radii for the representative elements are shown in Fig.¬†7.37. 
Note that these values are significantly smaller than might be expected from the 90% 
electron density volumes of isolated atoms, because when atoms form bonds, their 
electron ‚Äúclouds‚Äù interpenetrate. However, these values form a self-consistent data set 
that can be used to discuss the trends in atomic radii.
 
Note from Fig. 7.37 that the atomic radii decrease in going from left to right across 
a period. This decrease can be explained in terms of the increasing effective nuclear 
charge (decreasing shielding) in going from left to right. This means that the valence 
electrons are drawn closer to the nucleus, decreasing the size of the atom.
 
Atomic radius increases down a group, because of the increases in the orbital sizes 
in successive principal quantum levels.

7.13 The Properties of a Group: 
The Alkali Metals
We have seen that the periodic table originated as a way to portray the systematic 
properties of the elements. Mendeleev was primarily responsible for first showing its 
usefulness in correlating and predicting the elemental properties. In this section we 
will summarize much of the information available from the table. We also will illus-
trate the usefulness of the table by discussing the properties of a representative group, 
the alkali metals.
Information Contained in the Periodic Table
1.
The essence of the periodic table is that the groups of representative elements 
exhibit similar chemical properties that change in a regular way. The quantum 
mechanical model of the atom has allowed us to understand the basis for the 
similarity of properties in a group‚Äîthat each group member has the same valence 
electron configuration. It is the number and type of valence electrons that pri-
marily determine an atom‚Äôs chemistry.
2.
One of the most valuable types of information available from the periodic table 
is the electron configuration of any representative element. If you understand the 
organization of the table, you will not need to memorize electron configurations 
for these  elements. Although the predicted electron configurations for transition 
metals are sometimes incorrect, this is not a serious problem. You should, how-
ever, memorize the configurations of two exceptions, chromium and copper, 
since these 3d transition elements are found in many important compounds.
3.
As we mentioned in Chapter 2, certain groups in the periodic table have special 
names. These are summarized in Fig. 7.38. Groups are often referred to by these 
names, so you should learn them.
4.
The most basic division of the elements in the periodic table is into metals and 
nonmetals. The most important chemical property of a metal atom is the ten-
dency to give up one or more electrons to form a positive ion; metals tend to have 
low ionization energies. The metallic elements are found on the left side of the 
table, as shown in Fig. 7.38. The most chemically reactive metals are found on 
the lower left-hand portion of the table, where the ionization energies are small-
est. The most distinctive chemical property of a nonmetal atom is the ability to 
gain one or more electrons to form an anion when reacting with a metal. Thus 
nonmetals are elements with large ionization energies and the most negative 
electron affinities. The nonmetals are found on the right side of the table, with the

most reactive ones in the upper right-hand corner, except for the noble gas ele-
ments, which are quite unreactive. The division into metals and nonmetals shown 
in Fig. 7.38 is only approximate. Many elements along the division line exhibit 
both metallic and nonmetallic properties under certain circumstances. These ele-
ments are often called metalloids, or sometimes semimetals.
The Alkali Metals
The metals of Group 1A, the alkali metals, illustrate very well the relationships among 
the properties of the elements in a group. Lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, 
cesium, and francium are the most chemically reactive of the metals. We will not dis-
cuss francium here because it occurs in nature in only very small quantities. Although 
hydrogen is found in Group 1A of the periodic table, it behaves as a nonmetal, in 
contrast to the other members of that group. The fundamental reason for hydrogen‚Äôs 
nonmetallic character is its very small size (see Fig. 7.37). The electron in the small 1s 
orbital is bound tightly to the nucleus.
 
Some important properties of the first five alkali metals are shown in Table 7.8. 
The data in Table 7.8 show that in going down the group, the first ionization energy 
decreases and the atomic radius increases. This agrees with the general trends dis-
cussed in Section 7.12.
Hydrogen will be discussed further in 
Chapter 20.

The overall increase in density in going down Group 1A is typical of all groups. 
This occurs because atomic mass generally increases more rapidly than atomic size. 
Thus there is more mass per unit volume for each succeeding element.
The smooth decrease in melting point and boiling point in going down Group 1A is 
not typical; in most other groups, more complicated behavior occurs. Note that the 
Other groups will be discussed in  
Chapters 20 and 21.

otassium is widely recognized as an 
essential element. In fact, our daily 
requirement for potassium is more 
than twice that for sodium. Because 
most foods contain potassium, serious 
deficiency of this element in humans is 
rare. However, potassium deficiency 
can be caused by kidney malfunction 
or by the use of certain diuretics. Potas-
sium deficiency leads to muscle weak-
ness, irregular heartbeat, and 
depression.
Potassium is found in the fluids of 
the body as the K1 ion, and its pres-
ence is essential to the operation of our 
nervous system. The passage of 
impulses along the nerves requires the 
flow of K1 (and Na1) through channels 
in the membranes of the nerve cells. 
Failure of this ion flow prevents nerve 
transmissions and results in death. For 
example, the black mamba snake kills 
its victims by injecting a venom that 
blocks the potassium channels in the 
nerve cells.
Although a steady intake of potas-
sium is essential to preserve life, ironi-
cally, too much potassium can be lethal. 
In fact, the deadly ingredient in the 
drug mixture used for executing crimi-
nals is potassium chloride. Injection of a 
large amount of a potassium chloride 
solution produces an  excess of K1 ion 
in the fluids surrounding the cells and 
 prevents the essential flow of K1 out 
the cells to allow nerve impulses to 
occur. This causes the heart to stop 
beating. Unlike other forms of execu-
tion, death by lethal injection of potas-
sium chloride does not harm the 
organs of the body. Thus condemned 
criminals who are executed in this 
manner could potentially donate their 
organs for transplants. However, this 
idea is very controversial.

melting point of cesium is only 298C. Cesium can be melted readily using only the heat 
from your hand. This is very unusual‚Äîmetals typically have rather high melting 
points. For example, tungsten melts at 34108C. The only other metals with low melting 
points are mercury (mp 2388C) and gallium (mp 308C).
 
The chemical property most characteristic of a metal is the ability to lose its valence 
electrons. The Group 1A elements are very reactive. They have low ionization energies 
and react with nonmetals to form ionic solids. A typical example involves the reaction 
of sodium with chlorine to form sodium chloride:
2Na1s2 1 Cl21g2 h 2NaCl1s2
where sodium chloride contains Na1 and Cl2 ions. This is an oxidation‚Äìreduction 
reaction in which chlorine oxidizes sodium. In the reactions between metals and non-
metals, it is typical for the nonmetal to behave as the oxidizing agent and the metal to 
behave as the reducing agent, as shown by the following reactions:
 2Na1s2 1 S1s2 h Na2S1s2
 
Contains Na1 and S22 ions
 6Li1s2 1 N21g2 h 2Li3N1s2
 
Contains Li1 and N32 ions
 2Na1s2 1 O21g2 h Na2O21s2
 
Contains Na1 and O222 ions
 
For reactions of the types just shown, the relative reducing powers of the alkali met-
als can be predicted from the first ionization energies listed in Table 7.8. Since it is 
much easier to remove an electron from a cesium atom than from a lithium atom, 
cesium should be the better reducing agent. The expected trend in reducing ability is
Cs . Rb . K . Na . Li
This order is observed experimentally for direct reactions between the solid alkali met-
als and nonmetals. However, this is not the order for reducing ability found when the 
alkali metals react in aqueous solution. For example, the reduction of water by an 
alkali metal is very vigorous and exothermic:
2M1s2 1 2H2O1l2 h H21g2 1 2M11aq2 1 2OH21aq2 1 energy
The order of reducing abilities observed for this reaction for the first three group mem-
bers is
Li . K . Na
In the gas phase, potassium loses an electron more easily than sodium, and sodium 
more easily than lithium. Thus it is surprising that lithium is the best reducing agent 
toward water.
 
This reversal occurs because the formation of the M1 ions in aqueous solution is 
strongly influenced by the hydration of these ions by the polar water molecules. The 
hydration energy of an ion represents the change in energy that occurs when water 
molecules attach to the M1 ion. The hydration energies for the Li1, Na1, and K1 ions 
(Table 7.9) indicate that the process is exothermic in each case. However, nearly twice 
as much energy is released by the hydration of the Li1 ion as for the K1 ion. This dif-
ference is caused by size effects; the Li1 ion is much smaller than the K1 ion, and thus 
its charge density (charge per unit volume) is also much greater. This means that the 
polar water molecules are more strongly attracted to the small Li1 ion. Because the 
Li1 ion is so strongly hydrated, its formation from the lithium atom occurs more read-
ily than the formation of the K1 ion from the potassium atom. Although a potassium 
atom in the gas phase loses its valence electron more readily than a lithium atom in the 
gas phase, the opposite is true in aqueous solution. This anomaly is an example of the 
importance of the polarity of the water molecule in aqueous reactions.
Oxidation‚Äìreduction reactions were  
discussed in Chapter 4.

There is one more surprise involving the highly exothermic reactions of the alkali 
metals with water. Experiments show that in water lithium is the best reducing agent, 
so we might expect that lithium should react the most vigorously with water. However, 
this is not true. Sodium and potassium react much more vigorously. Why is this so? 
The answer lies in the relatively high melting point of lithium. When sodium and 
potassium react with water, the heat evolved causes them to melt, giving a larger area 
of contact with water. Lithium, on the other hand, does not melt under these conditions 
and reacts more slowly. This illustrates the important principle (which we will discuss 
in detail in Chapter 12) that the energy change for a reaction and the rate at which it 
occurs are not necessarily related.
In this section we have seen that the trends in atomic properties summarized by the 
periodic table can be a great help in understanding the chemical behavior of the ele-
ments. This fact will be emphasized over and over as we proceed in our study of 
chemistry.

ultraviolet, microwaves, gamma rays, and visible. All of 
these types of EMR can be characterized by wave-
length, frequency, photon energy, and speed of travel.

magnetic radiation in order of increasing wavelength, 
frequency, photon energy, and speed.

model, what do we mean when we say something is 
quantized? How does the Bohr model of the hydrogen 
atom explain the hydrogen emission spectrum? Why is 
the Bohr model fundamentally incorrect?
 3. What experimental evidence supports the quantum 
theory of light? Explain the wave-particle duality of all 
matter. For what size particles must one consider both 
the wave and the particle properties?

 9. Using the element phosphorus as an example, write the 
equation for a process in which the energy change will 
correspond to the ionization energy and to the electron 
affinity.
 
Explain why the first ionization energy tends to 
increase as one proceeds from left to right across a 
period. Why is the first ionization energy of aluminum 
lower than that of magnesium, and the first ionization 
energy of sulfur lower than that of phosphorus?
 
Why do the successive ionization energies of an 
atom always increase? Note the successive ionization 
energies for silicon given in Table 7.5. Would you 
expect to see any large jumps between successive ion-
ization energies of silicon as you  removed all the elec-
trons, one by one, beyond those shown in the table?
 10. The radius trend and the ionization energy trend are exact 
opposites. Does this make sense? Define electron affinity. 
Electron affinity values are both exothermic (negative) 
and endothermic (positive). However, ionization energy 
values are  always endothermic (positive). Explain.
 6. How do 2p orbitals differ from each other? How do 2p 
and 3p orbitals differ from each other? What is a nodal 
surface in an atomic orbital? What is wrong with 1p, 1d, 
2d, 1f, 2f, and 3f orbitals? Explain what we mean when 
we say that a 4s electron is more penetrating than a 3d 
electron.
 7. Four blocks of elements in a periodic table refer to 
various atomic orbitals being filled. What are the four 
blocks and the corresponding orbitals? How do you get 
the energy ordering of the atomic orbitals from the 
periodic table? What is the  aufbau principle? Hund‚Äôs 
rule? The Pauli exclusion principle? There are two 
common exceptions to the ground-state electron con-
figuration for elements 1‚Äì36 as predicted by the peri-
odic table. What are they?
 8. What is the difference between core electrons and 
valence electrons? Why do we emphasize the valence 
electrons in an atom when discussing atomic proper-
ties? What is the relationship between valence electrons 
and elements in the same group of the periodic table?
Active Learning Questions
These questions are designed to be used by groups of students in 
class.

Particulate properties? Electromagnetic radiation can be dis-
cussed in terms of both particles and waves. Explain the 
experimental verification for each of these views.
 2. Defend and criticize Bohr‚Äôs model. Why was it reasonable that 
such a model was proposed, and what evidence was there that 
it ‚Äúworks‚Äù? Why do we no longer ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù in it?

ground state?
 108. The first-row transition metals from chromium through zinc 
all have some biological function in the human body (see 
Table 21.18). How many unpaired electrons are present in

 109. One bit of evidence that the quantum mechanical model is 
‚Äúcorrect‚Äù lies in the magnetic properties of matter. Atoms with 
unpaired electrons are attracted by magnetic fields and thus 
are said to exhibit paramagnetism. The degree to which this 
effect is observed is directly related to the number of unpaired 
electrons present in the atom. Consider the ground-state 
 electron configurations for Li, N, Ni, Te, Ba, and Hg. Which of 
these atoms would be expected to be paramagnetic, and how 
many unpaired electrons are present in each paramagnetic 
atom?
 110. How many unpaired electrons are present in each of the fol-
lowing in the ground state: O, O1, O2, Os, Zr, S, F, Ar?

A
s we examine the world around us, we find it to be composed almost entirely 
of compounds and mixtures of compounds: Rocks, coal, soil, petroleum, 
trees, and human bodies are all complex mixtures of chemical compounds in which 
different kinds of atoms are bound together. Substances composed of unbound atoms 
do exist in nature, but they are very rare. Examples are the argon in the atmosphere and 
the helium mixed with natural gas reserves.
The manner in which atoms are bound together has a profound effect on chemical 
and physical properties. For example, graphite is a soft, slippery material used as a 
lubricant in locks, and diamond is one of the hardest materials known, valuable both 
as a  gemstone and in industrial cutting tools. Why do these materials, both composed 
solely of carbon atoms, have such different properties? The answer, as we will see, lies 
in the bonding in these substances.
Silicon and carbon are next to each other in Group 4A of the periodic table. From 
our knowledge of periodic trends, we might expect SiO2 and CO2 to be very similar. 
But SiO2 is the empirical formula of silica, which is found in sand and quartz, and 
carbon dioxide is a gas, a product of respiration. Why are they so different? We will be 
able to answer this question after we have developed models for bonding.
Molecular bonding and structure play the central role in determining the course of all 
chemical reactions, many of which are vital to our survival. Later in this book we will 
demonstrate their importance by showing how enzymes facilitate complex chemical 
reactions, how genetic characteristics are transferred, and how hemoglobin in the blood 
carries oxygen throughout the body. All of these fundamental biological reactions hinge 
on the geometric structures of molecules, sometimes depending on very subtle differ-
ences in molecular shape to channel the chemical reaction one way rather than another.
Many of the world‚Äôs current problems require fundamentally chemical answers: 
disease and pollution control, the search for new energy sources, the development of 
new fertilizers to increase crop yields, the improvement of the protein content in vari-
ous staple grains, and many more. To understand the behavior of natural materials, we 
must  understand the nature of chemical bonding and the factors that control the struc-
tures of compounds. In this chapter we will present various classes of compounds that 
illustrate the different types of bonds and then develop models to describe the structure 
and bonding that characterize materials found in nature. Later these models will be 
useful in understanding chemical reactions.
 
8.1 Types of Chemical Bonds
What is a chemical bond? There is no simple and yet complete answer to this question. 
In Chapter 2 we defined bonds as forces that hold groups of atoms together and make 
them function as a unit.
 
There are many types of experiments we can perform to determine the fundamental 
nature of materials. For example, we can study physical properties such as melting 
point, hardness, and electrical and thermal conductivity. We can also study solubility 
characteristics and the properties of the resulting solutions. To determine the charge 
distribution in a molecule, we can study its behavior in an electric field. We can obtain 
information about the strength of a bonding interaction by measuring the bond energy, 
which is the energy required to break the bond.
 
There are several ways in which atoms can interact with one another to form aggre-
gates. We will consider several specific examples to illustrate the various types of 
chemical bonds.
 
Earlier, we saw that when solid sodium chloride is dissolved in water, the resulting 
solution conducts electricity, a fact that helps to convince us that sodium chloride is com-
posed of Na1 and Cl2 ions. Therefore, when sodium and chlorine react to form sodium 
chloride, electrons are transferred from the sodium atoms to the chlorine atoms to form 
Na1 and Cl2 ions, which then aggregate to form solid sodium chloride. Why does this 
happen? The best simple answer is that the system can achieve the lowest possible energy

by behaving in this way. The attraction of a chlorine atom for the extra electron and the 
very strong mutual attractions of the oppositely charged ions provide the driving forces 
for the process. The resulting solid sodium chloride is a very sturdy material; it has a melt-
ing point of approximately 8008C. The bonding forces that produce this great thermal 
stability result from the electrostatic attractions of the closely packed, oppositely charged 
ions. This is an example of ionic bonding. Ionic substances are formed when an atom that 
loses electrons relatively easily reacts with an atom that has a high affinity for electrons. 
That is, an ionic compound results when a metal reacts with a nonmetal.
 
The energy of interaction between a pair of ions can be calculated using Coulomb‚Äôs 
law in the form
E 5 12.31 3 10219 J # nm2 aQ1Q2
r
b
where E has units of joules, r is the distance between the ion centers in nanometers, 
and Q1 and Q2 are the numerical ion charges.
 
For example, in solid sodium chloride the distance between the centers of the Na1 
and Cl2 ions is 2.76 √Ö (0.276 nm), and the ionic energy per pair of ions is
E 5 12.31 3 10219 J # nm2 c
1112 1212
0.276 nm d 5 28.37 3 10219 J
where the negative sign indicates an attractive force. That is, the ion pair has lower 
energy than the separated ions.
 
Coulomb‚Äôs law also can be used to calculate the repulsive energy when two like-
charged ions are brought together. In this case the calculated value of the energy will 
have a positive sign.
 
We have seen that a bonding force develops when two different types of atoms react 
to form oppositely charged ions. But how does a bonding force develop between two 
identical atoms? Let‚Äôs explore this situation from a very simple point of view by con-
sidering the energy terms that result when two hydrogen atoms are brought close 
together, as shown in Fig. 8.1(a). When hydrogen atoms are brought close together,

id you ever wonder why the part of 
a pencil that makes the mark is 
called the ‚Äúlead‚Äù? Pencils have no lead in 
them now‚Äîand they never have. Appar-
ently the association between writing 
and the element lead arose during the 
Roman Empire, when lead rods were 
used as writing utensils because they 
leave a gray mark on paper. Many centu-
ries later, in 1564, a deposit of a black 
substance found to be very useful for 
writing was discovered in Borrowdale, 
England. This substance, originally called 
‚Äúblack lead,‚Äù was shown in 1879 by Swed-
ish chemist Carl Scheele to be a form of 
carbon and was subsequently named 
graphite (after the Greek graphein, 
meaning ‚Äúto write‚Äù).
Originally, chunks of graphite from 
Borrowdale, called marking stones, were 
used as writing instruments. Later, sticks 
of graphite were used. Because graphite 
is brittle, the sticks needed reinforce-
ment. At first they were wrapped in 
string, which was unwound as the core 
wore down. Eventually, graphite rods 
were tied between two wooden slats or 
inserted into hollowed-out wooden 
sticks to form the first crude pencils.
Although Borrowdale graphite was 
pure enough to use directly, most 
graphite must be mixed with other 
materials to be useful for writing instru-
ments. In 1795, the French chemist 
Nicolas-Jaques Cont√© invented a pro-
cess in which graphite is mixed with 
clay and water to produce pencil ‚Äúlead,‚Äù 
a recipe that is still used today. In mod-
ern pencil manufacture, graphite and 
clay are mixed and crushed into a fine 
powder to which water is added. After 
the gray sludge is blended for several 
days, it is dried, ground up again, and 
mixed with more water to give a gray 
paste. The paste is extruded through a 
metal tube to form thin rods, which are 
then cut into pencil-length pieces 
called ‚Äúleads.‚Äù These leads are heated in 
an oven to 10008C until they are smooth 
and hard. The ratio of clay to graphite is 
adjusted to vary the hardness of the 
lead‚Äîthe more clay in the mix, the 
harder the lead and the lighter the line 
it makes.
Pencils are made from a slat of 
wood with several grooves cut in it to 
hold the leads. A similar grooved slat is 
then placed on top and glued to form a 
‚Äúsandwich‚Äù from which individual 
pencils are cut, sanded smooth, and 
painted. Although many types of wood 
have been used over the years to make 
pencils, the current favorite is incense 
cedar from the Sierra Nevada Moun-
tains of California.
Modern pencils are simple but 
amazing instruments. The average 
pencil can write approximately 45,000 
words, which is equivalent to a line 35 
miles long. The graphite in a pencil is 
easily transferred to paper because 
graphite contains layers of carbon 
atoms bound together in a ‚Äúchicken-
wire‚Äù structure. Although the bonding 
within each layer is very strong, the 
bonding between layers is weak, giving 
graphite its slippery, soft nature. In this 
way, graphite is much different from 
diamond, the other common elemental 
form of carbon. In diamond the carbon 
atoms are bound tightly in all three 
dimensions, making it extremely 
hard‚Äîthe hardest natural substance.
Pencils are very useful‚Äîespecially 
for doing chemistry problems‚Äîbecause 
we can erase our mistakes. Most pencils 
used in the United States have erasers 
(first attached to pencils in 1858), 
although most European pencils do not. 
Laid end to end, the number of pencils 
made in the United States each year 
would circle the earth about 15 times. 
Pencils  illustrate how useful a simple 
substance like graphite can be.

there are two unfavorable potential energy terms, proton‚Äìproton repulsion and electron‚Äì
electron repulsion, and one favorable term, proton‚Äìelectron attraction. Under what con-
ditions will the H2 molecule be favored over the separated hydrogen atoms? That is, 
what conditions will favor bond formation? The answer lies in the strong tendency in 
nature for any system to achieve the lowest possible energy. A bond will form (that is, 
the two hydrogen atoms will exist as a molecular unit) if the system can lower its total 
energy in the process.
 
In this case, then, the hydrogen atoms will position themselves so that the system 
will achieve the lowest possible energy; the system will act to minimize the sum of the 
positive (repulsive) energy terms and the negative (attractive) energy term. The dis-
tance where the energy is minimal is called the bond length. The total energy of this 
system as a function of distance between the hydrogen nuclei is shown in Fig. 8.1(b). 
Note several important features of this diagram:
The energy terms involved are the net potential energy that results from the at-
tractions and repulsions among the charged particles and the kinetic energy due 
to the motions of the electrons.
The zero point of energy is defined with the atoms at infinite separation.
At very short distances the energy rises steeply because of the importance of the 
 repulsive forces when the atoms are very close together.
The bond length is the distance at which the system has minimum energy.
 
In the H2 molecule, the electrons reside primarily in the space between the two 
nuclei, where they are attracted simultaneously by both protons. This positioning is 
precisely what leads to the stability of the H2 molecule compared with two separated 
hydrogen atoms. The potential energy of each electron is lowered because of the 
increased attractive forces in this area. When we say that a bond is formed between the 
hydrogen atoms, we mean that the H2 molecule is more stable than two separated 
hydrogen atoms by a certain quantity of energy (the bond energy).
 
We can also think of a bond in terms of forces. The simultaneous attraction of each 
electron by the protons generates a force that pulls the protons toward each other and 
that just balances the proton‚Äìproton and electron‚Äìelectron repulsive forces at the dis-
tance corresponding to the bond length.
 
The type of bonding we encounter in the hydrogen molecule and in many other 
molecules in which electrons are shared by nuclei is called covalent bonding.
 
So far we have considered two extreme types of bonding. In ionic bonding the par-
ticipating atoms are so different that one or more electrons are transferred to form 
oppositely charged ions, which then attract each other. In covalent bonding two identi-
cal atoms share electrons equally. The bonding results from the mutual attraction of 
the two nuclei for the shared electrons. Between these extremes are intermediate cases 
in which the atoms are not so different that electrons are completely transferred but are 
different enough that unequal sharing results, forming what is called a polar covalent 
bond. An example of this type of bond occurs in the hydrogen fluoride (HF) molecule. 
When a sample of hydrogen fluoride gas is placed in an electric field, the molecules 
tend to orient themselves as shown in Fig. 8.2, with the fluoride end closest to the posi-
tive pole and the hydrogen end closest to the negative pole. This result implies that the 
HF molecule has the following charge distribution:
HiF
 d1    d2
where d (lowercase delta) is used to indicate a fractional charge. This same effect was 
noted in Chapter 4, where many of water‚Äôs unusual properties were attributed to the 
polar OOH bonds in the H2O molecule.
 
The most logical explanation for the development of the partial positive and nega-
tive charges on the atoms (bond polarity) in such molecules as HF and H2O is that the 
electrons in the bonds are not shared equally. For example, we can account for the 
A bond will form if the energy of the 
 aggregate is lower than that of the 
 separated atoms.
Potential energy was discussed in  
Chapter 6.
Ionic and covalent bonds are the extreme 
bond types.

polarity of the HF molecule by assuming that the fluorine atom has a stronger attrac-
tion for the shared electrons than the hydrogen atom. Likewise, in the H2O molecule 
the oxygen atom appears to attract the shared electrons more strongly than the hydro-
gen atoms do. Because bond polarity has important chemical implications, we find it 
useful to quantify the ability of an atom to attract shared electrons. In the next section 
we show how this is done.
8.2 Electronegativity
The different affinities of atoms for the electrons in a bond are described by a property 
called electronegativity: the ability of an atom in a molecule to attract shared elec-
trons to itself.
The most widely accepted method for determining values of electronegativity is 
that of Linus Pauling (1901‚Äì1995), an American scientist who won the Nobel Prizes 
for both chemistry and peace. To understand Pauling‚Äôs model, consider a hypothetical 
molecule HX. The relative electronegativities of the H and X atoms are determined by 
comparing the measured HOX bond energy with the ‚Äúexpected‚Äù HOX bond energy, 
which is an  average of the HOH and XOX bond energies:
Expected HiX bond energy 5 HiH bond energy 1 XiX bond energy
2
The difference (D) between the actual (measured) and expected bond energies is
D 5 1HiX2 act 2 1HiX2 exp
If H and X have identical electronegativities, (HOX)act and (HOX)exp are the same, 
and D is 0. On the other hand, if X has a greater electronegativity than H, the shared 
electron(s) will tend to be closer to the X atom. The molecule will be polar, with the 
following charge distribution:
HiX
 d1  d2
Note that this bond can be viewed as having an ionic as well as a covalent compo-
nent. The attraction between the partially (and oppositely) charged H and X atoms will 
lead to a greater bond strength. Thus (HOX)act will be larger than (HOX)exp. The 
greater the difference in the electronegativities of the atoms, the greater is the ionic 
component of the bond and the greater is the value of D. Thus the relative electronega-
tivities of H and X can be assigned from the D values.

8.2 Electronegativity

Electronegativity values have been determined by this process for virtually all the ele-
ments; the results are given in Fig. 8.3. Note that electronegativity generally increases going 
from left to right across a period and decreases going down a group for the representative 
 elements. The range of electronegativity values is from 4.0 for fluorine to 0.7 for cesium.
 
The relationship between electronegativity and bond type is shown in Table 8.1. For 
identical atoms (an electronegativity difference of zero), the electrons in the bond are 
shared equally, and no polarity develops. When two atoms with very different electro-
negativities interact, electron transfer can occur to form the ions that make up an ionic 
substance. Intermediate cases give polar covalent bonds with unequal electron sharing.
Relative Bond Polarities
Order the following bonds according to polarity: HOH, OOH, ClOH, SOH, 
and¬†FOH.
 
SOLUTION 
The polarity of the bond increases as the difference in electronegativity increases. From  
the electronegativity values in Fig. 8.3, the following variation in bond polarity is expected 
(the electronegativity value appears in parentheses below each element):
HiH , SiH , CliH , OiH , FiH

8.3 Bond Polarity and Dipole 
Moments
We have seen that when hydrogen fluoride is placed in an electric field, the molecules 
have a preferential orientation (see Fig. 8.2). This follows from the charge distribution 
in the HF molecule, which has a positive end and a negative end. A molecule such as 
HF that has a center of positive charge and a center of negative charge is said to be 
dipolar, or to have a dipole moment. The dipolar character of a molecule is often 
represented by an arrow pointing to the negative charge center with the tail of the 
arrow indicating the positive center of charge:
Œ¥+
Œ¥‚àí
H
F
Another way to represent the charge distribution in HF is by an electrostatic poten-
tial diagram (Fig. 8.4). For this representation the colors of visible light are used to 
show the variation in charge distribution. Red indicates the most electron-rich region 
of the molecule, and blue indicates the most electron-poor region.
Of course, any diatomic (two-atom) molecule that has a polar bond also will show 
a molecular dipole moment. Table 8.2 shows the dipole moments (in Debye units) of 
the various HX¬†molecules.  Note how the dipole moment depends on the electronega-
tivity of X. 
Polyatomic molecules also can exhibit dipolar behavior. For example, because the 
oxygen atom in the water molecule has a greater electronegativity than the hydrogen 
atoms, the molecular charge distribution is that shown in Fig. 8.5(a). Because of this 
charge distribution, the water molecule behaves in an  electric field as if it had two 
centers of charge‚Äîone positive and one negative‚Äîas shown in Fig. 8.5(b). The water

molecule (Fig. 8.6). Some molecules have polar bonds but do not have a dipole 
moment. This occurs when the individual bond polarities are arranged in such a way 
that they cancel each other out. An example is the CO2 molecule, which is a linear 
molecule that has the charge distribution shown in Fig. 8.7. In this case the opposing 
bond polarities  cancel out, and the carbon dioxide molecule does not have a dipole 
moment. There is no  preferential way for this molecule to line up in an electric field. 
(Try to find a preferred orientation to make sure you understand this concept.)
 
There are many cases besides that of carbon dioxide where the bond polarities 
oppose and exactly cancel each other. Some common types of molecules with polar 
bonds but no dipole moment are shown in Table 8.3.

Bond Polarity and Dipole Moment
For each of the following molecules, show the direction of the bond polarities and 
indicate which ones have a dipole moment: HCl, Cl2, SO3 (a planar molecule with the 
oxygen atoms spaced evenly around the central sulfur atom), CH4 [tetrahedral (see 
Table 8.3) with the carbon atom at the center], and H2S (V-shaped with the sulfur atom 
at the point).
 
SOLUTION 
The HCl molecule: In Fig. 8.3, we see that the electronegativity of chlorine (3.0) is  
greater than that of hydrogen (2.1). Thus the chlorine will be partially negative, and the 
hydrogen will be partially positive. The HCl molecule has a dipole moment:

8.4 Ions: Electron Configurations 
and Sizes
The description of the electron arrangements in atoms that emerged from the quantum 
mechanical model has helped a great deal in our understanding of what constitutes a 
stable compound. In virtually every case, the atoms in a stable compound have a noble 
gas arrangement of electrons. Nonmetallic elements achieve a noble gas electron con-
figuration either by sharing electrons with other nonmetals to form covalent bonds or 
by taking electrons from metals to form ions. In the second case, the nonmetals form 
anions, and the metals form cations. The generalizations that apply to electron con-
figurations in stable compounds are as follows:
Electron Configuration of Compounds
 ¬ª When two nonmetals react to form a covalent bond, they share electrons in a way that 
completes the valence electron configurations of both atoms. That is, both nonmetals 
attain noble gas electron configurations.
 ¬ª When a nonmetal and a representative-group metal react to form a binary ionic 
compound, the ions form so that the valence electron configuration of the nonmetal 
achieves the electron configuration of the next noble gas atom and the valence orbitals of 
the metal are emptied. In this way both ions achieve noble gas electron configurations.
8.4
Atoms in stable compounds usually have a 
noble gas electron configuration.

These generalizations apply to the vast majority of compounds and are important to 
remember. We will deal with covalent bonds more thoroughly later, but now we will 
consider what implications these rules hold for ionic compounds.
Predicting Formulas of Ionic Compounds
At the beginning of this discussion, it should be emphasized that when chemists use 
the term ionic compound, they are usually referring to the solid state of that compound. 
In the solid state, the ions are close together. That is, solid ionic compounds contain a 
large collection of positive and negative ions packed together in a way that minimizes 
the EME and BMB repulsions and maximizes the BME attractions. This situation 
stands in contrast to the gas phase of an ionic substance, where the ions are quite far 
apart on average. In the gas phase, a pair of ions may get close enough to interact, but 
large collections of ions do not exist. Thus, when we speak in this text of the stability 
of an ionic compound, we are referring to the solid state, where the large attractive 
forces present among oppositely charged ions tend to stabilize (favor the formation of) 
the ions. For example, as we mentioned in the preceding chapter, the O22 ion is not 
stable as an isolated, gas-phase species but, of course, is very stable in many solid ionic 
compounds. That is, MgO(s), which contains Mg21 and O22 ions, is very stable, but 
the isolated, gas-phase ion pair Mg21M O22 is not energetically favorable in compari-
son with the separate neutral gaseous atoms. Thus you should keep in mind that in this 
section, and in most other cases where we are describing the nature of ionic com-
pounds, the discussion usually refers to the solid state, where many ions are simultane-
ously interacting.
 
To illustrate the principles of electron configurations in stable, solid ionic com-
pounds, we will consider the formation of an ionic compound from calcium and oxy-
gen. We can predict what compound will form by considering the valence electron 
configurations of the two atoms:
Ca¬†¬† 3Ar44s2
O¬†¬†  3He42s22p4
From Fig. 8.3 we see that the electronegativity of oxygen (3.5) is much greater than 
that of calcium (1.0). Because of this large difference, electrons will be transferred 
from calcium to oxygen to form oxygen anions and calcium cations in the compound. 
How many electrons are transferred? We can base our prediction on the observation 
that noble gas configurations are generally the most stable. Note that oxygen needs 
two electrons to fill its 2s and 2p valence orbitals and to achieve the configuration of 
neon (1s22s22p6). And by losing two electrons, calcium can achieve the configuration 
of argon. Two electrons therefore transferred:
Ca 1 O h Ca21 1 O22
 
N 
 
2e2
 
To predict the formula of the ionic compound, we simply recognize that chemical 
compounds are always electrically neutral‚Äîthey have the same quantities of positive 
and negative charges. In this case we have equal numbers of Ca21 and O22 ions, and 
the empirical formula of the compound is CaO.
 
The same principles can be applied to many other cases. For example, consider the 
compound formed between aluminum and oxygen. Because aluminum has the con-
figuration [Ne]3s23p1, it loses three electrons to form the Al31 ion and thus achieves 
the neon configuration. Therefore, the Al31 and O22 ions form in this case. Since the 
compound must be electrically neutral, there must be three O22 ions for every two Al31 
ions, and the compound has the empirical formula Al2O3.
 
Table 8.4 shows common elements that form ions with noble gas electron configu-
rations in ionic compounds. In losing electrons to form cations, metals in Group 1A 
lose one electron, those in Group 2A lose two electrons, and those in Group 3A lose

three electrons. In gaining electrons to form anions, nonmetals in Group 7A (the halo-
gens) gain one electron, and those in Group 6A gain two electrons. Hydrogen typically 
behaves as a nonmetal and can gain one electron to form the hydride ion (H2), which 
has the electron configuration of helium.
 
There are some important exceptions to the rules discussed here. For example, tin 
forms both Sn21 and Sn41 ions, and lead forms both Pb21 and Pb41 ions. Also, bismuth 
forms Bi31 and Bi51 ions, and thallium forms Tl1 and Tl31 ions. There are no simple 
explanations for the behavior of these ions. For now, just note them as exceptions to 
the very useful rule that ions generally adopt noble gas electron configurations in ionic 
compounds. Our discussion here refers to representative metals. The transition metals 
exhibit more complicated behavior, forming a variety of ions that will be considered in 
Chapter 21.
Sizes of Ions
Ion size plays an important role in determining the structure and stability of ionic sol-
ids, the properties of ions in aqueous solution, and the biologic effects of ions. As with 
atoms, it is impossible to define precisely the sizes of ions. Most often, ionic radii are 
determined from the measured distances between ion centers in ionic compounds. 
This method, of course, involves an assumption about how the distance should be 
divided up between the two ions. Thus you will note considerable disagreement among 
ionic sizes given in various sources. Here we are mainly interested in trends and will 
be less concerned with  absolute ion sizes.
 
Various factors influence ionic size. We will first consider the relative sizes of an 
ion and its parent atom. Since a positive ion is formed by removing one or more elec-
trons from a neutral atom, the resulting cation is smaller than its parent atom. The 
opposite is true for negative ions; the addition of electrons to a neutral atom produces 
an anion significantly larger than its parent atom.
 
It is also important to know how the sizes of ions vary depending on the positions 
of the parent elements in the periodic table. Figure 8.8 shows the sizes of the most 
important ions (each with a noble gas configuration) and their position in the periodic 
table. Note that ion size increases down a group. The changes that occur horizontally 
are complicated because of the change from predominantly metals on the left-hand 
side of the periodic table to nonmetals on the right-hand side. A given period thus 
contains both elements that give up electrons to form cations and ones that accept 
electrons to form anions.
 
One trend worth noting involves the relative sizes of a set of isoelectronic ions‚Äî
ions containing the same number of electrons. Consider the ions O22, F2, Na1, Mg21, 
and Al31. Each of these ions has the neon electron configuration. How do the sizes of 
these ions vary? In general, there are two important facts to consider in predicting the 
relative sizes of ions: the number of electrons and the number of protons. Since these

ions are isoelectronic, the number of electrons is 10 in each case. Electron repulsions 
therefore should be about the same in all cases. However, the number of protons 
increases from 8 to 13 as we go from the O22 ion to the Al31 ion. Thus, in going from 
O22 to Al31, the 10 electrons experience a greater attraction as the positive charge on 
the nucleus increases. This causes the ions to become smaller. You can confirm this by 
looking at Fig. 8.8. In general, for a series of isoelectronic ions, the size decreases as 
the nuclear charge Z increases.
CRITICAL THINKING Ions have different radii than their parent 
atoms. What if ions stayed the same size as their parent atoms? How would this 
affect ionic bonding in compounds?

Arrange the ions Se22, Br2, Rb1, and Sr21 in order of decreasing size.
 
SOLUTION 
This is an isoelectronic series of ions with the krypton electron configuration. Since  
these ions all have the same number of electrons, their sizes will depend on the nuclear 
charge. The Z values are 34 for Se22, 35 for Br2, 37 for Rb1, and 38 for Sr21. Since the 
nuclear charge is greatest for Sr21, it is the smallest of these ions. The Se22 ion is 
largest:

8.5 Energy Effects in Binary Ionic 
Compounds
In this section we will introduce the factors that influence the stability and the struc-
tures of solid binary ionic compounds. We know that metals and nonmetals react by 
transferring electrons to form cations and anions that are mutually attractive. The 
resulting ionic solid forms because the aggregated oppositely charged ions have a 
lower energy than the original elements. Just how strongly the ions attract each 
other in the solid state is  indicated by the lattice energy‚Äîthe change in energy that 
takes place when separated gaseous ions are packed together to form an ionic 
solid:
M11g2 1 X21g2 h MX1s2
The lattice energy is often defined as the energy released when an ionic solid forms 
from its ions. However, in this book the sign of an energy term is always determined 
from the system‚Äôs point of view: negative if the process is exothermic, positive if 
endothermic. Thus, using this convention, the lattice energy has a negative sign.
We can illustrate the energy changes involved in the formation of an ionic solid 
by considering the formation of solid lithium fluoride from its elements:
Li1s2 1 1
2F21g2 h LiF1s2
To see the energy terms associated with this process, we take advantage of the fact that 
energy is a state function and break this reaction into steps, the sum of which gives the 
overall reaction.
1.
Sublimation of solid lithium. Sublimation involves taking a substance from the 
solid state to the gaseous state:
Li1s2 h Li1g2
The enthalpy of sublimation for Li(s) is 161 kJ/mol.
2.
Ionization of lithium atoms to form Li1 ions in the gas phase:
Li1g2 h Li11g2 1 e2
This process corresponds to the first ionization energy for lithium, which is 
520 kJ/mol.

3. Dissociation of fluorine molecules. We need to form a mole of fluorine atoms by 
breaking the FOF bonds in a half mole of F2 molecules:
1
2F21g2 h F1g2
The energy required to break this bond is 154 kJ/mol. In this case we are break-
ing the bonds in a half mole of fluorine, so the energy required for this step is  
(154 kJ)y2, or 77 kJ.
4. Formation of F2 ions from fluorine atoms in the gas phase:
F1g2 1 e2 h F21g2
The energy change for this process corresponds to the electron affinity of fluo-
rine, which is 2328 kJ/mol.
5. Formation of solid lithium fluoride from the gaseous Li1 and F2 ions:
Li11g2 1 F21g2 h LiF1s2
This corresponds to the lattice energy for LiF, which is 21047 kJ/mol.
 
Since the sum of these five processes yields the desired overall reaction, the sum of 
the individual energy changes gives the overall energy change:

This process is summarized by the energy diagram in Fig. 8.9. Note that the forma-
tion of solid lithium fluoride from its elements is highly exothermic, mainly because 
of the very large negative lattice energy. A great deal of energy is released when the 
ions combine to form the solid. In fact, note that the energy released when an electron 
is added to a fluorine atom to form the F2 ion (328 kJ/mol) is not enough to remove an 
electron from lithium (520 kJ/mol). That is, when a metallic lithium atom reacts with 
a nonmetallic fluorine atom to form separated ions,
Li1g2 1 F1g2 h Li11g2 1 F21g2
the process is endothermic and thus unfavorable. Clearly, then, the main impetus for 
the formation of an ionic compound rather than a covalent compound results from the

strong mutual attractions among the Li1 and F2 ions in the solid. The lattice energy is 
the dominant energy term.
 
The structure of solid lithium fluoride is represented in Fig. 8.10. Note the alternat-
ing arrangement of the Li1 and F2 ions. Also note that each Li1 is surrounded by six 
F2 ions, and each F2 ion is surrounded by six Li1 ions. This structure can be rational-
ized by assuming that the ions behave as hard spheres that pack together in a way that 
both maximizes the attractions among the oppositely charged ions and minimizes the 
repulsions among the identically charged ions.
 
All the binary ionic compounds formed by an alkali metal and a halogen have the 
structure shown in Fig. 8.10, except for the cesium salts. The arrangement of ions 
shown in Fig. 8.10 is often called the sodium chloride structure, after the most com-
mon substance that possesses it.
Lattice Energy Calculations
In discussing the energetics of the formation of solid lithium fluoride, we emphasized 
the importance of lattice energy in contributing to the stability of the ionic solid. Lat-
tice energy can be represented by a modified form of Coulomb‚Äôs law:
Lattice energy 5 k aQ1Q2
r
b
where k is a proportionality constant that depends on the structure of the solid and the 
electron configurations of the ions, Q1 and Q2 are the charges on the ions, and r is the 
shortest distance between the centers of the cations and anions. Note that the lattice 
energy has a negative sign when Q1 and Q2 have opposite signs. This result is expected, 
since bringing cations and anions together is an exothermic process. Also note that the 
process becomes more exothermic as the ionic charges increase and as the distances 
between the ions in the solid decrease.
 
The importance of the charges in ionic solids can be illustrated by comparing the 
energies involved in the formation of NaF(s) and MgO(s). These solids contain the 
isoelectronic ions Na1, F2, Mg21, and O22. The energy diagram for the formation of 
the two solids is given in Fig. 8.11. Note several important features:
The energy released when the gaseous Mg21 and O22 ions combine to form solid 
MgO is much greater (more than four times greater) than that released when the 
gaseous Na1 and F2 ions combine to form solid NaF.
The energy required to remove two electrons from the magnesium atom (735 kJ/mol 
for the first and 1445 kJ/mol for the second, yielding a total of 2180 kJ/mol) is 
much greater than the energy required to remove one electron from a sodium atom 
(495 kJ/mol).
Energy (737 kJ/mol) is required to add two electrons to the oxygen atom in the 
gas phase. Addition of the first electron is exothermic (2141 kJ/mol), but addition 
of the second electron is quite endothermic (878 kJ/mol). This latter energy must 
be obtained indirectly, since the O22(g) ion is not stable.
 
In view of the facts that twice as much energy is required to remove the second 
electron from magnesium as to remove the first and that addition of an electron to the 
gaseous O2 ion is quite endothermic, it seems puzzling that magnesium oxide contains 
Mg21 and O22 ions rather than Mg1 and O2 ions. The answer lies in the lattice energy. 
Note that the lattice energy for combining gaseous Mg21 and O22 ions to form MgO(s) 
is 3000 kJ/mol more negative than that for combining gaseous Na1 and F2 ions to 
form NaF(s). Thus the energy released in forming a solid containing Mg21 and O22 
ions rather than Mg1 and O2 ions more than compensates for the energies required for 
the processes that produce the Mg21 and O22 ions.
 
If there is so much lattice energy to be gained in going from singly charged to doubly 
charged ions in the case of magnesium oxide, why then does solid sodium fluoride 
Since the equation for lattice energy 
contains the product Q1Q2, the lattice 
energy for a solid with 21 and 22 ions 
should be four times that for a solid with 
11 and 12 ions. That is,
1122 1222

contain Na1 and F2 ions rather than Na21 and F22 ions? We can answer this question 
by recognizing that both Na1 and F2 ions have the neon electron configuration. Removal 
of an electron from Na1 requires an extremely large quantity of energy (4560 kJ/mol) 
because a 2p electron must be removed. Conversely, the addition of an electron to F2 
would require use of the relatively high-energy 3s orbital, which is also an unfavorable 
process. Thus we can say that for sodium fluoride the extra energy required to form the 
doubly charged ions is greater than the gain in lattice energy that would result.
 
This discussion of the energies involved in the formation of solid ionic compounds 
illustrates that a variety of factors operate to determine the composition and structure 
of these compounds. The most important of these factors involve the balancing of the 
energies required to form highly charged ions and the energy released when highly 
charged ions combine to form the solid.

8.6 Partial Ionic Character 
of¬†Covalent Bonds
Recall that when atoms with different electronegativities react to form molecules, the 
electrons are not shared equally. The possible result is a polar covalent bond or, in the 
case of a large electronegativity difference, a complete transfer of one or more elec-
trons to form ions. The cases are summarized in Fig. 8.12.
How well can we tell the difference between an ionic bond and a polar covalent 
bond? The only honest answer to this question is that there are probably no totally 
ionic bonds between discrete pairs of atoms. The evidence for this statement comes 
from calculations of the percent ionic character for the bonds of various binary com-
pounds in the gas phase. These calculations are based on comparisons of the measured 
dipole moments for molecules of the type XOY with the calculated dipole moments 
for the completely ionic case, X1Y2. The percent ionic character of a bond can be 
defined as
Percent ionic character of a bond 5 ameasured dipole moment of XiY
calculated dipole moment of X1Y2b 3 100%
Application of this definition to various compounds (in the gas phase) gives the results 
shown in Fig. 8.13, where percent ionic character is plotted versus the difference in the 
electronegativity values of X and Y. Note from this plot that ionic character increases 
with electronegativity difference, as expected. However, none of the bonds reaches 
100% ionic character, even though compounds with the maximum possible electro-
negativity differences are considered. Thus, according to this definition, no individual 
bonds are completely ionic. This conclusion is in contrast to the usual classification of 
many of these compounds (as ionic solids). All the compounds shown in Fig. 8.13 with 
more than 50% ionic character are normally considered to be ionic solids. Recall, 
however, the results in Fig. 8.13 are for the gas phase, where individual XY molecules 
exist. These results  cannot necessarily be assumed to apply to the solid state, where the 
existence of ions is  favored by the multiple ion interactions.
 
Another complication in identifying ionic compounds is that many substances 
 contain polyatomic ions. For example, NH4Cl contains NH41 and Cl2 ions, and 
Na2SO4 contains Na1 and SO422 ions. The bonds within the ammonium and sulfate 
ions are covalent bonds.
 
We will avoid these problems by adopting an operational definition of ionic com-
pounds: Any compound that conducts an electric current when melted will be classi-
fied as ionic.

8.7 The Covalent Chemical Bond: 
A¬†Model
Before we develop specific models for covalent chemical bonding, it will be helpful to 
summarize some of the concepts introduced in this chapter.
What is a chemical bond? Chemical bonds can be viewed as forces that cause a 
group of atoms to behave as a unit.
Why do chemical bonds occur? There is no principle of nature that states that 
bonds are favored or disfavored. Bonds are neither inherently ‚Äúgood‚Äù nor inherently 
‚Äúbad‚Äù as far as nature is concerned; bonds result from the tendency of a system to 
seek its lowest possible energy. From a simplistic point of view, bonds occur when 
collections of atoms are more stable (lower in energy) than the separate atoms. For 
example, approximately 1652 kJ of energy is required to break a mole of methane 
(CH4) molecules into separate C and H atoms. Or, taking the opposite view, 1652¬†kJ 
of energy is released when 1 mole of methane is formed from 1 mole of gaseous 
C¬†atoms and 4 moles of gaseous H atoms. Thus we can say that 1 mole of CH4 mol-
ecules in the gas phase is 1652 kJ lower in energy than 1 mole of carbon atoms plus 
4¬†moles of hydrogen atoms. Methane is therefore a stable molecule relative to its 
separated atoms.
 
We find it useful to interpret molecular stability in terms of a model called a chemi-
cal bond. To understand why this model was invented, let‚Äôs continue with methane, 
which consists of four hydrogen atoms arranged at the corners of a tetrahedron around 
a carbon atom:
H
H
C
H
H
Given this structure, it is natural to envision four individual COH interactions (we call 
them bonds). The energy of stabilization of CH4 is divided equally among the four 
bonds to give an average COH bond energy per mole of COH bonds:
1652 kJ/mol
4
5 413 kJ/mol
 
Next, consider methyl chloride, which consists of CH3Cl molecules having the 
structure
H
H

Cl
Experiments have shown that approximately 1578 kJ of energy is required to break 
down 1 mole of gaseous CH3Cl molecules into gaseous carbon, chlorine, and hydro-
gen atoms. The reverse process can be represented as
C1g2 1 Cl1g2 1 3H1g2 h CH3Cl1g2 1 1578 kJ/mol
A mole of gaseous methyl chloride is lower in energy by 1578 kJ than its separate 
gaseous atoms. Thus a mole of methyl chloride is held together by 1578 kJ of energy. 
Again, it is very useful to divide this energy into individual bonds. Methyl chloride can 
be visualized as containing one COCl bond and three COH bonds. If we assume 
arbitrarily that a COH interaction represents the same quantity of energy in any situ-

ation (that is, that the strength of a COH bond is independent of its molecular environ-
ment), we can do the following bookkeeping:
 1 mol CiCl bonds plus 3 mol CiH bonds 5 1578 kJ
 CiCl bond energy 1 31average CiH bond energy2 5 1578 kJ
 CiCl bond energy 1 31413 kJ/mol2 5 1578 kJ
 CiCl bond energy 5 1578 2 1239 5 339 kJ/mol
These assumptions allow us to associate given quantities of energy with COH and 
COCl bonds.
 
It is important to note that the bond concept is a human invention. Bonds provide a 
method for dividing up the energy evolved when a stable molecule is formed from its 
component atoms. Thus in this context a bond represents a quantity of energy obtained 
from the overall molecular energy of stabilization in a rather arbitrary way. This is not 
to say that the concept of individual bonds is a bad idea. In fact, the modern concept of 
the chemical bond, conceived by the American chemists G. N. Lewis and Linus 
Pauling, is one of the most useful ideas chemists have ever developed.
Models: An Overview
The framework of chemistry, like that of any science, consists of models‚Äîattempts to 
explain how nature operates on the microscopic level based on experiences in the mac-
roscopic world. To understand chemistry, one must understand its models and how 
they are used. We will use the concept of bonding to reemphasize the important char-
acteristics of models, including their origin, structure, and uses.
 
Models originate from our observations of the properties of nature. For example, 
the concept of bonds arose from the observations that most chemical processes involve 
collections of atoms and that chemical reactions involve rearrangements of the ways 
the atoms are grouped. Therefore, to understand reactions, we must understand the 
forces that bind atoms together.
 
In natural processes there is a tendency toward lower energy. Collections of atoms 
therefore occur because the aggregated state has lower energy than the separated atoms. 
Why? As we saw earlier in this chapter, the best explanations for the energy change involve 
atoms sharing electrons or atoms transferring electrons to become ions. In the case of elec-
tron sharing, we find it convenient to assume that individual bonds occur between pairs of 
atoms. Let‚Äôs explore the validity of this assumption and see how it is useful.
 
In a diatomic molecule such as H2, it is natural to assume that a bond exists between 
the atoms, holding them together. It is also useful to assume that individual bonds are 
present in polyatomic molecules such as CH4. Therefore, instead of thinking of CH4 as 
a unit with a stabilization energy of 1652 kJ per mole, we choose to think of CH4 as 
containing four COH bonds, each worth 413 kJ of energy per mole of bonds. Without 
this concept of individual bonds in molecules, chemistry would be hopelessly compli-
cated. There are millions of different chemical compounds, and if each of these com-
pounds had to be considered as an entirely new entity, the task of understanding 
chemical behavior would be overwhelming.
 
The bonding model provides a framework to systematize chemical behavior by 
enabling us to think of molecules as collections of common fundamental components. 
For example, a typical biomolecule, such as a protein, contains hundreds of atoms and 
might seem discouragingly complex. However, if we think of a protein as constructed 
of individual bonds, COC, COH, CON, COO, NOH, and so on, it helps tremen-
dously in predicting and understanding the protein‚Äôs behavior. The essential idea is 
that we expect a given bond to behave about the same in any molecular environment. 
Used in this way, the model of the chemical bond has helped chemists to systematize 
the reactions of the millions of existing compounds.
 
In addition to being useful, the bonding model is physically sensible. It makes sense 
that atoms can form stable groups by sharing electrons; shared electrons give a lower 
energy state because they are simultaneously attracted by two nuclei.
Bonding is a model proposed to explain 
molecular stability.

Also, as we will see in the next section, bond energy data support the existence of 
discrete bonds that are relatively independent of the molecular environment. It is very 
 important to remember, however, that the chemical bond is only a model. Although our 
concept of discrete bonds in molecules agrees with many of our observations, some 
molecular properties require that we think of a molecule as a whole, with the electrons 
free to move through the entire molecule. This is called delocalization of the electrons, 
a concept that will be discussed more completely in the next chapter.
LET‚ÄôS REVIEW  Fundamental Properties of Models
 ¬ª Models are human inventions, always based on an incomplete understanding of how 
nature works. A model does not equal reality.
 ¬ª Models are often wrong. This property derives from the first property. Models are based 
on speculation and are always oversimplifications.
 ¬ª Models tend to become more complicated as they age. As flaws are discovered in our 
models, we ‚Äúpatch‚Äù them and thus add more detail.
 ¬ª It is very important to understand the assumptions inherent in a particular model before 
you use it to interpret observations or to make predictions. Simple models usually involve 
very restrictive assumptions and can be expected to yield only qualitative information. 
Asking for a sophisticated explanation from a simple model is like expecting to get an 
accurate mass for a diamond using a bathroom scale.
 
For a model to be used effectively, we must understand its strengths and 
weaknesses and ask only appropriate questions. An illustration of this point is the 
simple aufbau principle used to account for the electron configurations of the elements. 
Although this model correctly predicts the configuration for most atoms, chromium 
and copper, for example, do not agree with the predictions. Detailed studies show that 
the configurations of chromium and copper result from complex electron interactions 
that are not taken into account in the simple model. However, this does not mean that 
we should discard the simple model that is so useful for most atoms. Instead, we must 
apply it with caution and not expect it to be correct in every case.
 ¬ª When a model is wrong, we often learn much more than when it is right. If a model 
makes a wrong prediction, it usually means we do not understand some fundamental 
characteristics of nature. We often learn by making mistakes. (Try to remember this when 
you get back your next chemistry test.)

8.8 Covalent Bond Energies 
and¬†Chemical Reactions
In this section we will consider the energies associated with various types of bonds and see 
how the bonding concept is useful in dealing with the energies of chemical reactions. One 
important consideration is to establish the sensitivity of a particular type of bond to its 
molecular environment. For example, consider the stepwise decomposition of methane:

(kJ/mol)

 CH31g2 S CH21g2 1 H1g2

 CH1g2 S C1g2 1 H1g2
339
Total 5  1652 
Average 5 1652

5  413
 
Although a COH bond is broken in each case, the energy required varies in a non-
systematic way. This example shows that the COH bond is somewhat sensitive to its 
 environment. We use the average of these individual bond dissociation energies even 
though this quantity only approximates the energy associated with a COH bond in a 
particular molecule. The degree of sensitivity of a bond to its environment also can be 
seen from experimental measurements of the energy required to break the COH bond 
in the following molecules:
Molecule
Measured COH Bond Energy 
(kJ/mol)
HCBr3
380
HCCl3
380
HCF3
430
C2H6
410
These data show that the COH bond strength varies significantly with its environment, 
but the concept of an average COH bond strength remains useful to chemists. The 
average values of bond energies for various types of bonds are listed in Table¬†8.5.
So far we have discussed bonds in which one pair of electrons is shared. This type of 
bond is called a single bond. As we will see in more detail later, atoms sometimes share 
two pairs of electrons, forming a double bond, or share three pairs of  electrons, forming 
a triple bond. The bond energies for these multiple bonds are also given in Table¬†8.5.
A relationship also exists between the number of shared electron pairs and the bond 
length. As the number of shared electrons increases, the bond length shortens. This 
relationship is shown for selected bonds in Table 8.6.
Bond Energy and Enthalpy
Bond energy values can be used to calculate approximate energies for reactions. To 
illustrate how this is done, we will calculate the change in energy that accompanies the 
following reaction:
H21g2 1 F21g2 h 2HF1g2
This reaction involves breaking one HOH and one FOF bond and forming two 
HOF bonds. For bonds to be broken, energy must be added to the system‚Äîan endo-
thermic process. Consequently, the energy terms associated with bond breaking have 
8.8
In this discussion we are ignoring the small 
difference between enthalpy and energy.

positive signs. The formation of a bond releases energy, an exothermic process, so the 
energy terms  associated with bond making carry a negative sign. We can write the 
enthalpy change for a reaction as follows:
DH 5  sum of the energies required to break old bonds (positive signs)  
plus the sum of the energies released in the formation of new  
bonds (negative signs)
This leads to the expression

8.9 The Localized Electron 
Bonding¬†Model
So far we have discussed the general characteristics of the chemical bonding model and 
have seen that properties such as bond strength and polarity can be assigned to individual 
bonds. In this section we introduce a specific model used to describe covalent bonds. We 
need a simple model that can be applied easily even to very complicated molecules and 
that can be used routinely by chemists to interpret and organize the wide variety of 
chemical phenomena. The model that serves this purpose is the localized electron (LE) 
model, which assumes that a molecule is composed of atoms that are bound together by 
sharing pairs of electrons using the atomic orbitals of the bound atoms. Electron pairs in 
the molecule are assumed to be localized on a particular atom or in the space between 
two atoms. Those pairs of electrons localized on an atom are called lone pairs, and those 
found in the space between the atoms are called bonding pairs.
As we will apply it, the LE model has three parts:
1.
Description of the valence electron arrangement in the molecule using Lewis 
structures (will be discussed in the next section).
2.
Prediction of the geometry of the molecule using the valence shell electron-pair 
repulsion (VSEPR) model (will be discussed in Section 8.13).
3.
Description of the type of atomic orbitals used by the atoms to share electrons or 
hold lone pairs (will be discussed in Chapter 9).
 
8.10 Lewis Structures
The Lewis structure of a molecule shows how the valence electrons are arranged 
among the atoms in the molecule. These representations are named after G. N. Lewis 
(Fig. 8.14). The rules for writing Lewis structures are based on observations of thou-
sands of molecules. From experiment, chemists have learned that the most important 
requirement for the formation of a stable compound is that the atoms achieve noble 
gas electron configurations.
We have already seen that when metals and nonmetals react to form binary ionic 
compounds, electrons are transferred and the resulting ions typically have noble gas 
electron configurations. An example is the formation of KBr, where the K1 ion has the 
[Ar] electron configuration and the Br2 ion has the [Kr] electron configuration. In 
writing Lewis structures, the rule is that only the valence electrons are included. Using 
dots to represent electrons, the Lewis structure for KBr is
K

No dots are shown on the K1 ion because it has no valence electrons. The Br2 ion is 
shown with eight electrons because it has a filled valence shell.

Lewis structures show only valence  electrons.

Next we will consider Lewis structures for molecules with covalent bonds, involv-
ing elements in the first and second periods. The principle of achieving a noble gas 
electron configuration applies to these elements as follows:
‚óè Hydrogen forms stable molecules where it shares two electrons. That is, it follows 
a duet rule. For example, when two hydrogen atoms, each with one electron, 
combine to form the H2 molecule, we have
H
H
H
H
By sharing electrons, each hydrogen in H2, in effect, has two electrons; that is, each 
 hydrogen has a filled valence shell.
H
H
‚óè Helium does not form bonds because its valence orbital is already filled; it is a 
noble gas. Helium has the electron configuration 1s2 and can be represented by the 
Lewis structure
He :
‚óè The second-row nonmetals carbon through fluorine form stable molecules when 
they are surrounded by enough electrons to fill the valence orbitals, that is, the 2s 
and the three 2p orbitals. Since eight electrons are required to fill these orbitals, 
these elements typically obey the octet rule; they are surrounded by eight electrons. 
An example is the F2 molecule, which has the following Lewis structure:
F atom with seven
valence electrons
F atom with seven

Note that each fluorine atom in F2 is, in effect, surrounded by eight electrons, two 
of which are shared with the other atom. This is a bonding pair of electrons, as 
discussed earlier. Each fluorine atom also has three pairs of electrons not involved 
in bonding. These are the lone pairs.
‚óè Neon does not form bonds because it already has an octet of valence electrons (it 
is a noble gas). The Lewis structure is
Ne
Note that only the valence electrons of the neon atom (2s22p6) are represented by 
the Lewis structure. The 1s2 electrons are core electrons and are not shown.
 
From the preceding discussion we can formulate the following rules for writing the 
Lewis structures of molecules containing atoms from the first two periods.
PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY
Steps for Writing Lewis Structures
1. Sum the valence electrons from all the atoms. Do not worry about keeping track of 
which electrons come from which atoms. It is the total number of electrons that is 
important.
2. Use a pair of electrons to form a bond between each pair of bound atoms.
3. Arrange the remaining electrons to satisfy the duet rule for hydrogen and the octet 
rule for the second-row elements.
Carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine 
 always obey the octet rule in stable 
 molecules.

To see how these steps are applied, we will draw the Lewis structures of a few mol-
ecules. We will first consider the water molecule and follow the previous steps.
1. We sum the valence electrons for H2O as shown:
1 1 1 1 6 5 8 valence electrons
 
h 
h

H 
H 
O
2. Using a pair of electrons per bond, we draw in the two OOH single bonds:
HiOiH
Note that a line instead of a pair of dots is used to indicate each pair of bonding 
 electrons. This is the standard notation.
3. We distribute the remaining electrons to achieve a noble gas electron configura-
tion for each atom. Since four electrons have been used in forming the two bonds, 
four electrons (8 2 4) remain to be distributed. Hydrogen is satisfied with two 
electrons (duet rule), but oxygen needs eight electrons to have a noble gas con-
figuration. Thus the remaining four electrons are added to oxygen as two lone 
pairs. Dots are used to represent the lone pairs:
Lone pairs
O
H

This is the correct Lewis structure for the water molecule. Each hydrogen has 
two electrons and the oxygen has eight, as shown below:

As a second example, let‚Äôs write the Lewis structure for carbon dioxide.

C

2. Parts of electrons are used to form a bond between the carbon and each oxygen,
OiCiO
the remaining electrons are distributed to achieve noble gas configurations on 
each atom. In this case we have 12 electrons (16 2 4) remaining after the bonds 
are drawn. The distribution of these electrons is determined by a trial-and-error 
process. We have 6 pairs of electrons to distribute. Suppose we try 3 pairs on 
each oxygen to give
O
C
O
3. Is this correct? To answer this question, we need to check two things:
1. The total number of electrons. There are 16 valence electrons in this struc-
ture, which is the correct number.
2. The octet rule for each atom. Each oxygen has 8 electrons, but the carbon has 
only 4. This cannot be the correct Lewis structure.
 
How can we arrange the 16 available electrons to achieve an octet for each atom? 
Suppose there are 2 shared pairs between the carbon and each oxygen:
8 electrons

Now each atom is surrounded by 8 electrons, and the total number of electrons is 16, 
as required. This is the correct Lewis structure for carbon dioxide, which has two 
double bonds and four lone pairs.
 
Finally, let‚Äôs consider the Lewis structure of the CN2 (cyanide) ion. Summing the 
valence electrons, we have
CN2
4 1 5 1 1 = 10
Note that the negative charge means an extra electron is present. After drawing a single 
bond (CON), we distribute the remaining electrons to achieve a noble gas configura-
tion for each atom. Eight electrons remain to be distributed. We can try various possi-
bilities, for example:
N
C
This structure is incorrect because C and N have only six electrons each instead of 
eight. The correct arrangement is
N

When writing Lewis structures, do not worry about which electrons come from 
which atoms in a molecule. The best way to look at a molecule is to regard it as a new 
entity that uses all the available valence electrons of the atoms to achieve the lowest 
possible energy.* The valence electrons belong to the molecule, rather than to the 
individual atoms. Simply distribute all valence electrons so that the various rules are 
satisfied, without regard for the origin of each particular electron.
8.11 Exceptions to the Octet Rule
The localized electron model is a simple but very successful model, and the rules we 
have used for Lewis structures apply to most molecules. However, with such a simple 
model, some exceptions are inevitable. Boron, for example, tends to form compounds 
*In a sense this approach corrects for the fact that the localized electron model overemphasizes that 
a molecule is simply a sum of its parts‚Äîthat is, that the atoms retain their individual identities in 
the molecule.

he element nitrogen exists at nor-
mal temperatures and pressures as 
a gas containing N2, a molecule with a 
very strong triple bond. In the gas 
phase, the diatomic molecules move 
around independently with almost no 
tendency to associate with each other. 
Under intense pressure, however, 
nitrogen changes to a dramatically 
different form. This conclusion was 
reached at the Carnegie Institution in 
Washington, D.C., by Mikhail Erements 
and his colleagues, who subjected 
nitrogen to a pressure of 2.4 million 
atmospheres in a special diamond anvil 
press. Under this tremendous pressure, 
the bonds of the N2 molecules break 
and a substance containing an aggre-
gate of  nitrogen atoms forms. In other 
words, under great pressure elemental 
nitrogen changes from a substance 
containing  diatomic molecules to one 
containing many nitrogen atoms 
bonded to each other. Interestingly, 
this substance remains intact even 
after the pressure is released‚Äîas long 
as the temperature remains at 100 K. 
This new form of  nitrogen has a very 
high potential energy relative to N2. 
Thus this  substance would be an 
extraordinarily powerful propellant or 
explosive if enough of it could be 
made. This new form of nitrogen is also 
a semiconductor for electricity; normal 
 nitrogen gas is an insulator.
The newly discovered form of nitro-
gen is significant for several reasons. 
For one thing, it may help us under-
stand the nature of the interiors of  
the giant gas planets such as Jupiter. 
Also, their success in changing nitrogen 
to an atomic solid encourages high-
pressure scientists who are trying to 
accomplish the same goal with hydro-
gen. It is surprising that nitrogen, 
which has diatomic molecules contain-
ing bonds more than twice as strong as 
those in hydrogen, will form an atomic 
solid at these pressures but hydrogen 
does not. Hydrogen remains a molecu-
lar solid at far greater pressures than 
nitrogen can endure.

in which the boron atom has fewer than eight electrons around it‚Äîit does not have a 
complete octet. Boron trifluoride (BF3), a gas at normal temperatures and pressures, 
reacts very  energetically with molecules such as water and ammonia that have avail-
able electron pairs (lone pairs). The violent reactivity of BF3 with electron-rich mole-
cules arises because the boron atom is electron-deficient. Boron trifluoride has 24 
valence electrons. The Lewis structure often drawn for BF3 is
B
F
F
F
Note that in this structure boron has only 6 electrons around it. The octet rule for boron 
can be satisfied by drawing a structure with a double bond, such as
B
F
F
F
 
Recent studies indicate that double bonding may be important in BF3. However, the 
boron atom in BF3 certainly behaves as if it is electron-deficient, as indicated by the reac-
tivity of BF3 toward electron-rich molecules, for example, toward NH3 to form H3NBF3:

In this stable compound, boron has an octet of electrons.
 
It is characteristic of boron to form molecules in which the boron atom is electron-
deficient. On the other hand, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine can be counted on 
to obey the octet rule.
 
Some atoms exceed the octet rule. This behavior is observed only for those ele-
ments in Period 3 of the periodic table and beyond. To see how this arises, we will 
consider the Lewis structure for sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), a well-known and very 
stable molecule. The sum of the valence electrons is
6 1 6172 5 48 electrons
Indicating the single bonds gives the structure on the left below:

We have used 12 electrons to form the SOF bonds, which leaves 36 electrons. Since 
 fluorine always follows the octet rule, we complete the six fluorine octets to give the struc-
ture on the right above. This structure uses all 48 valence electrons for SF6, but sulfur has 
12 electrons around it; that is, sulfur exceeds the octet rule. How can this happen?
 
To answer this question, we need to consider the different types of valence orbitals 
characteristic of second- and third-period elements. The second-row elements have 2s 
and 2p valence orbitals, and the third-row elements have 3s, 3p, and 3d orbitals. The 
3s and 3p orbitals fill with electrons in going from sodium to argon, but the 3d orbitals 
remain empty. For example, the valence orbital diagram for a sulfur atom is

The localized electron model assumes that the empty 3d orbitals can be used to accom-
modate extra electrons. Thus the sulfur atom in SF6 can have 12 electrons around it by 
using the 3s and 3p orbitals to hold 8 electrons, with the extra 4 electrons placed in the 
formerly empty 3d orbitals.
LET‚ÄôS REVIEW  Lewis Structures: Comments About the Octet Rule
 ¬ª The second-row elements C, N, O, and F should always be assumed to obey the octet rule.
 ¬ª The second-row elements B and Be often have fewer than eight electrons around them in 
their compounds. These electron-deficient compounds are very reactive.
 ¬ª The second-row elements never exceed the octet rule, since their valence orbitals (2s and 
2p) can accommodate only eight electrons.
 ¬ª Third-row and heavier elements often satisfy the octet rule but can exceed the octet rule 
by using their empty valence d orbitals.
 ¬ª When writing the Lewis structure for a molecule, satisfy the octet rule for the atoms first. If 
electrons remain after the octet rule has been satisfied, then place them on the elements 
having available d orbitals (elements in Period 3 or beyond).

the extra electrons. However, in molecules having more than one atom that can exceed 
Third-row elements can exceed the 
octet rule.
Whether the atoms that exceed the octet 
rule actually place the extra electrons in 
their d orbitals is a matter of controversy 
among theoretical chemists. We will not

The rule we will follow is that when it is necessary to exceed the octet rule for one 
of several third-row (or higher) elements, assume that the extra electrons should be 
placed on the central atom.

8.12 Resonance
Sometimes more than one valid Lewis structure (one that obeys the rules we have 
outlined) is possible for a given molecule. Consider the Lewis structure for the nitrate 
ion (NO32), which has 24 valence electrons. To achieve an octet of electrons around 
each atom, a structure like this is required:
‚àí
N
O
O
O
If this structure accurately represents the bonding in NO32, there should be two types 
of NOO bonds observed in the molecule: one shorter bond (the double bond) and two 
identical longer ones (the two single bonds). However, experiments clearly show that 
NO32 exhibits only one type of NOO bond with a length and strength between those 
expected for a single bond and a double bond. Thus, although the structure we have 
shown above is a valid Lewis structure, it does not correctly represent the bonding in 
NO32. This is a serious problem, and it means that the model must be modified.
 
Look again at the proposed Lewis structure for NO32. There is no reason for choos-
ing a particular oxygen atom to have the double bond. There are really three valid 
Lewis structures:
‚àí
‚àí
O
O
N
O
‚àí
N
O
N
O
O
O
O
O
Is any of these structures a correct description of the bonding in NO32? No, because 
NO32 does not have one double and two single bonds‚Äîit has three equivalent bonds. 
We can solve this problem by making the following assumption: The correct descrip-
tion of NO32 is not given by any one of the three Lewis structures but is given only by 
the superposition of all three.
 
The nitrate ion does not exist as any of the three extreme structures but exists as an 
average of all three. Resonance is invoked when more than one valid Lewis struc-
ture can be written for a particular molecule. The resulting electron structure of 
the molecule is given by the average of these resonance structures. This situation 
is usually represented by double-headed arrows as follows:
‚àí
N
O
‚àí
N
O
O
O
O
O
‚àí
N
O
O
O
Note that in all these resonance structures the arrangement of the nuclei is the same. 
Only the placement of the electrons differs. The arrows do not mean that the molecule 
‚Äúflips‚Äù from one resonance to another. They simply show that the actual structure is an 
average of the three resonance structures.
The concept of resonance is necessary because the localized electron model postu-
lates that electrons are localized between a given pair of atoms. However, nature does 
not really operate this way. Electrons are really delocalized‚Äîthey can move around 
the entire molecule. The valence electrons in the NO32 molecule distribute themselves 
to provide equivalent NOO bonds. Resonance is necessary to compensate for the 
defective assumption of the localized electron model. However, this model is so useful 
that we retain the concept of localized electrons and add resonance to allow the model 
to treat species such as NO32.

We will follow the usual procedure for obtaining the Lewis structure for the NO22 ion. In 
NO22 there are 5 1 2(6) 1 1 5 18 valence electrons. Indicating the single bonds gives

This is a resonance situation. Two equivalent Lewis structures can be drawn. The elec-
tronic structure of the molecule is correctly represented not by either resonance struc-
ture but by the average of the two. There are two equivalent NOO bonds, each one 
intermediate between a single and a double bond.
See Exercises 8.93 through 8.98
Odd-Electron Molecules
Relatively few molecules formed from nonmetals contain odd numbers of electrons. 
One common example is nitric oxide (NO), which is formed when nitrogen and oxy-
gen gases react at the high temperatures in automobile engines. Nitric oxide is emitted 
into the air, where it immediately reacts with oxygen to form gaseous nitrogen dioxide 
(NO2), another odd-electron molecule.
 
Since the localized electron model is based on pairs of electrons, it does not handle 
odd-electron cases in a natural way. To treat odd-electron molecules, a more sophisti-
cated model is needed.
Formal Charge
Molecules or polyatomic ions containing atoms that can exceed the octet rule often 
have many nonequivalent Lewis structures (see margin note), all of which obey the 
rules for writing Lewis structures. For example, as we will see in detail below, the 
sulfate ion has a Lewis structure with all single bonds and several Lewis structures that 
contain double bonds. How do we  decide which of the many possible Lewis structures 
best describes the actual bonding in sulfate? One method is to estimate the charge on 
each atom in the various possible Lewis structures and use these charges to select the 
most appropriate structure(s). We will see below how this is done, but first we must 
decide on a method to assign atomic charges in molecules.
 
In Chapter 4 we discussed one system for obtaining charges, called oxidation states. 
However, in assigning oxidation states, we always count both the shared electrons as 
 belonging to the more electronegative atom in a bond. This practice leads to highly 
exaggerated  estimates of charge. In other words, although oxidation states are useful 
for bookkeeping electrons in redox reactions, they are not realistic estimates of the 
actual charges on individual atoms in a molecule, so they are not suitable for judging 
the appropriateness of Lewis structures. Another definition of the charge on an atom in 
a molecule, the formal charge, can, however, be used to evaluate Lewis structures. As 
we will see below, the formal charge of an atom in a molecule is the difference 
between the number of  valence electrons on the free atom and the number of valence 
electrons assigned to the atom in the molecule.
EXAMPLE 8.9
NO2
‚Äì
Equivalent Lewis structures contain the 
same numbers of single and multiple 
bonds. For example, the resonance 
 structures for O3
O
O
O
and
O
O
O
are equivalent Lewis structures. These 
are equally important in describing the 
bonding in O3. Nonequivalent Lewis 
structures contain different numbers of 
single and multiple bonds.

Therefore, to determine the formal charge of a given atom in a molecule, we need 
to know two things:
1.
The number of valence electrons on the free neutral atom (which has zero net 
charge because the number of electrons equals the number of protons)
2.
The number of valence electrons ‚Äúbelonging‚Äù to the atom in a molecule
We then compare these numbers. If in the molecule the atom has the same number of 
valence electrons as it does in the free state, the positive and negative charges just bal-
ance, and it has a formal charge of zero. If the atom has one more valence electron in 
a molecule than it has as a free atom, it has a formal charge of 21, and so on. Thus the 
formal charge on an atom in a molecule is defined as
Formal charge 5 (number of valence electrons on free atom) 
2 (number of valence electrons assigned to the atom in the molecule)
 
To compute the formal charge of an atom in a molecule, we assign the valence 
electrons in the molecule to the various atoms, making the following assumptions:
1. Lone pair electrons belong entirely to the atom in question.
2. Shared electrons are divided equally between the two sharing atoms.
Thus the number of valence electrons assigned to a given atom is calculated as follows:
1Valence electrons2 assigned 5 1number of lone pair electrons2
1 1
2 1number of shared electrons2
We will illustrate the procedure for calculating formal charges by considering two 
of the possible Lewis structures for the sulfate ion, which has 32 valence electrons. For 
the Lewis structure

each oxygen atom has 6 lone pair electrons and shares 2 electrons with the sulfur atom.

For oxygen atoms with single bonds:
 Valence electrons assigned 5 6 1 1
2122 5 7
 Formal c harge 5 6 2 7 5 21
For oxygen atoms with double bonds:

For the sulfur atom:
 Valence electrons assigned 5 0 1 1
21122 5 6
 Formal c harge 5 6 2 6 5 0
 
We will use two fundamental assumptions about formal charges to evaluate Lewis 
structures:
1. Atoms in molecules try to achieve formal charges as close to zero as 
possible.
2. Any negative formal charges are expected to reside on the most electronega-
tive atoms.
We can use these principles to evaluate the two nonequivalent Lewis structures for 
sulfate given previously. Notice that in the structure with only single bonds, each oxy-
gen has a formal charge of 21, while the sulfur has a formal charge of 12. In contrast, 
in the structure with two double bonds and two single bonds, the sulfur and two oxygen 
atoms have a formal charge of 0, while two oxygens have a formal charge of 21. Based 
on the assumptions given above, the structure with two double bonds is preferred‚Äîit 
has lower formal charges and the 21 formal charges are on electronegative oxygen 
atoms. Thus, for the sulfate ion, we might expect resonance structures such as

Rules Governing Formal Charge
 ¬ª To calculate the formal charge on an atom:
1. Take the sum of the lone pair electrons and one-half the shared electrons. This is the 
number of valence electrons assigned to the atom in the molecule.
2. Subtract the number of assigned electrons from the number of valence electrons on 
the free, neutral atom to obtain the formal charge.
 ¬ª The sum of the formal charges of all atoms in a given molecule or ion must equal the overall 
charge on that species.
 ¬ª If nonequivalent Lewis structures exist for a species, those with formal charges closest 
to zero and with any negative formal charges on the most electronegative atoms are 
considered to best describe the bonding in the molecule or ion.

Based on the ideas of formal charge, we would predict that the Lewis structures with 
the lower values of formal charge would be most appropriate for describing the bond-
ing in XeO3.
See Exercises 8.105 and 8.106
 
As a final note, there are a couple of cautions about formal charge to keep in mind. 
First, although formal charges are closer to actual atomic charges in molecules than are 
oxidation states, formal charges still provide only estimates of charge‚Äîthey should 
not be taken as actual atomic charges. Second, the evaluation of Lewis structures using 
formal charge ideas can lead to erroneous predictions. Tests based on experiments 
must be used to make the final decisions on the correct description of the bonding in a 
molecule or polyatomic ion.
 
8.13 Molecular Structure: 
The VSEPR Model
The structures of molecules play a very important role in determining their chemical 
properties. As we will see later, this is particularly important for biological molecules; 
a slight change in the structure of a large biomolecule can completely destroy its use-
fulness to a cell or may even change the cell from a normal one to a cancerous one.

Many accurate methods now exist for determining molecular structure, the three-
dimensional arrangement of the atoms in a molecule. These methods must be used if 
 precise information about structure is required. However, it is often useful to be able 
to predict the approximate molecular structure of a molecule. In this section we con-
sider a simple model that allows us to do this. This model, called the valence shell 
electron-pair repulsion (VSEPR) model, is useful in predicting the geometries of 
molecules formed from nonmetals. The main postulate of this model is that the struc-
ture around a given atom is determined principally by minimizing electron-pair repul-
sions. The idea here is that the bonding and nonbonding pairs around a given atom will 
be positioned as far apart as possible. To see how this model works, we will first con-
sider the molecule BeCl2, which has the Lewis structure
Be
Cl
Cl
Note that there are two pairs of electrons around the beryllium atom. What arrange-
ment of these electron pairs allows them to be as far apart as possible to minimize the 
repulsions? Clearly, the best arrangement places the pairs on opposite sides of the 
beryllium atom at 180 degrees from each other:
180¬∞
Be
    
This is the maximum possible separation for two electron pairs. Once we have deter-
mined the optimal arrangement of the electron pairs around the central atom, we can 
specify the molecular structure of BeCl2, that is, the positions of the atoms. Since each 
electron pair on beryllium is shared with a chlorine atom, the molecule has a linear 
structure with a 180-degree bond angle:
Cl
Cl

Be
    
 
Next, let‚Äôs consider BF3, which has the Lewis structure

Here the boron atom is surrounded by three pairs of electrons. What arrangement will 
minimize the repulsions? The electron pairs are farthest apart at angles of 120 degrees:

will be

This is a planar (flat) and triangular molecule, which is commonly described as a 
trigonal planar structure.
BeCl2 has only four electrons around Be 
and is expected to be very reactive with 
electron-pair donors.

Next, let‚Äôs consider the methane molecule, which has the Lewis structure
C
H
H
H
H
There are four pairs of electrons around the central carbon atom. What arrangement of 
these electron pairs best minimizes the repulsions? First, let‚Äôs try a square planar 
arrangement:
90¬∞
C
    
The carbon atom and the electron pairs are centered in the plane of the paper, and the 
angles between the pairs are all 90 degrees.
 
Is there another arrangement with angles greater than 90 degrees that would put the 
electron pairs even farther away from each other? The answer is yes. The tetrahedral 
structure has angles of 109.5 degrees:
C
C
C
109.5¬∞
      
It can be shown that this is the maximum possible separation of four pairs around a 
given atom. This means that whenever four pairs of electrons are present around an 
atom, they should always be arranged tetrahedrally.
 
Now that we have the electron-pair arrangement that gives the least repulsion, we 
can determine the positions of the atoms and thus the molecular structure of CH4. In 
methane, each of the four electron pairs is shared between the carbon atom and a 
hydrogen atom. Thus the hydrogen atoms are placed as in Fig. 8.15, and the molecule 
has a tetrahedral structure with the carbon atom at the center.
 
Recall that the main idea of the VSEPR model is to find the arrangement of electron 
pairs around the central atom that minimizes the repulsions. Then we can determine 
the mo lecular structure from knowing how the electron pairs are shared with the 
peripheral atoms. Use the following steps to predict the structure of a molecule using 
the VSEPR model.
PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY
Steps to Apply the VSEPR Model
1. Draw the Lewis structure for the molecule.
2. Count the electron pairs and arrange them in the way that minimizes repulsion (that 
is, put the pairs as far apart as possible).
3. Determine the positions of the atoms from the way the electron pairs are shared.
4. Determine the name of the molecular structure from the positions of the atoms.

We will predict the structure of ammonia (NH3) using this stepwise approach.
1. Draw the Lewis structure:
N
H
H
H
2. Count the pairs of electrons and arrange them to minimize repulsions. The NH3 
molecule has four pairs of electrons: three bonding pairs and one nonbonding 
pair. From the discussion of the methane molecule, we know that the best 
arrangement of four electron pairs is a tetrahedral array [Fig. 8.16(a)].
3. Determine the positions of the atoms. The three H atoms share electron pairs  
[Fig. 8.16(b)].
4. Name the molecular structure. It is very important to recognize that the name 
of the molecular structure is always based on the positions of the atoms. The 
placement of the electron pairs determines the structure, but the name is based 
on the positions of the atoms. Thus it is incorrect to say that the NH3 molecule 
is tetrahedral. It has a tetrahedral arrangement of electron pairs but not a tetra-
hedral arrangement of atoms. The molecular structure of ammonia is a trigonal 
pyramid (one side is different from the other three) rather than a tetrahedron 
[Fig. 8.16(c)].

H
H
There are four pairs of electrons: two bonding pairs and two nonbonding pairs. To 
minimize repulsions, these are best arranged in a tetrahedral array [Fig. 8.17(a)]. 
Although H2O has a tetrahedral arrangement of electron pairs, it is not a tetrahedral 
molecule. The atoms in the H2O molecule form a V shape [Fig. 8.17(b) and (c)].
See Exercises 8.119 and 8.120
 
From Example 8.11 we see that the H2O molecule is V-shaped, or bent, because of 
the presence of the lone pairs. If no lone pairs were present, the molecule would be 
linear, the polar bonds would cancel, and the molecule would have no dipole moment. 
This would make water very different from the polar substance so familiar to us.

From the previous discussion, we would predict that the HOXOH bond angle 
(where X is the central atom) in CH4, NH3, and H2O should be the tetrahedral angle of 
109.5 degrees. Experimental studies, however, show that the actual bond angles are 
those given in Fig. 8.18. What significance do these results have for the VSEPR model? 
One possible point of view is that we should be pleased to have the observed angles so 
close to the tetrahedral angle. The opposite view is that the deviations are significant 
enough to require modification of the simple model so that it can more accurately 
handle similar cases. We will take the latter view.
 
Let us examine the following data:

One interpretation of the trend observed here is that lone pairs require more space than 
bonding pairs; in other words, as the number of lone pairs increases, the bonding pairs 
are increasingly squeezed together.
 
This interpretation seems to make physical sense if we think in the following terms. 
A bonding pair is shared between two nuclei, and the electrons can be close to either 
nucleus. They are relatively confined between the two nuclei. A lone pair is localized 
on only one nucleus, and both electrons will be close only to that nucleus, as shown 
schematically in Fig. 8.19. These pictures help us understand why a lone pair may 
require more space near an atom than a bonding pair.
 
As a result of these observations, we make the following addition to the original 
postulate of the VSEPR model: Lone pairs require more room than bonding pairs 
and tend to compress the angles between the bonding pairs.
 
So far we have considered cases with two, three, and four electron pairs around the 
central atom. These are summarized in Table 8.7.
 
Table 8.8 summarizes the structures possible for molecules in which there are four 
electron pairs around the central atom with various numbers of atoms bonded to it. 
Note that molecules with four pairs of electrons around the central atom can be tetra-
hedral (AB4), trigonal pyramidal (AB3), and V-shaped (AB2).

For five pairs of electrons, there are several possible choices. The one that produces 
minimum repulsion is a trigonal bipyramid. Note from Table 8.7 that this arrangement 
has two different angles, 90 degrees and 120 degrees. As the name suggests, the structure 
formed by this arrangement of pairs consists of two trigonal-based pyramids that share a 
common base. Table 8.9 summarizes the structures possible for molecules in which there 
are five electron pairs around the central atom with various numbers of atoms bonded to 
it. Note that molecules with five pairs of electrons around the central atom can be trigo-
nal bipyramidal (AB5), see-saw (AB4), T-shaped (AB3), and linear (AB2).
 
Six pairs of electrons can best be arranged around a given atom with 90-degree 
angles to form an octahedral structure, as shown in Table 8.7.
 
To use the VSEPR model to determine the geometric structures of molecules, you 
should memorize the relationships between the number of electron pairs and their best 
arrangement.

When phosphorus reacts with excess chlorine gas, the compound phosphorus penta-

ions. Predict the geometric structures of PCl5, PCl41, and PCl62.

Prediction of Molecular Structure III
Because the noble gases have filled s and p valence orbitals, they were not expected to 
be chemically reactive. In fact, for many years these elements were called inert gases 
because of this supposed inability to form any compounds. However, in the early 1960s 
several compounds of krypton, xenon, and radon were synthesized. For example, a 
team at the Argonne National Laboratory produced the stable colorless compound 
xenon tetra fluoride (XeF4). Predict its structure and whether it has a dipole moment.

The structure predicted for this molecule will depend on how the lone pairs and 
bonding pairs are arranged. Consider the two possibilities shown in Fig. 8.20. The 
bonding pairs are indicated by the presence of the fluorine atoms. Since the structure 
predicted differs in the two cases, we must decide which of these arrangements is

preferable. The key is to look at the lone pairs. In the structure in part (a), the lone 
pair‚Äìlone pair angle is 90 degrees; in the structure in part (b), the lone pairs are sepa-
rated by 180 degrees. Since lone pairs require more room than bonding pairs,  
a structure with two lone pairs at 90 degrees is unfavorable. Thus the arrangement in 
Fig. 8.20(b) is preferred, and the molecular structure is predicted to be square planar. 
Note that this molecule is not described as being octahedral. There is an octahedral 
arrangement of electron pairs, but the atoms form a square planar structure. 
 
Although each XeOF bond is polar (fluorine has a greater electronegativity than 
xenon), the square planar arrangement of these bonds causes the polarities to cancel.
 
Thus XeF4 has no dipole moment, as shown in the margin.
See Exercises 8.123 through 8.126

are at 120 degrees. Thus structure (c) is preferred. The resulting molecular structure

n this chapter we have stressed the 
importance of being able to predict 
the three-dimensional structure of a 
molecule. Molecular structure is impor-
tant because of its effect on chemical 
reactivity. This is especially true in 
biological systems, where reactions 
must be efficient and highly specific. 
Among the hundreds of types of mol-
ecules in the fluids of a typical biologi-
cal system, the appropriate reactants 
must find and react only with each 
other‚Äîthey must be very discriminat-
ing. This specificity depends largely on 
structure. The molecules are con-
structed so that only the appropriate 
partners can approach each other in a 
way that allows reaction.
Another area where molecular 
structure is central is in the use of 
molecules as a means of communica-
tion. Examples of a chemical communi-
cation occur in humans in the 
conduction of nerve impulses across 
synapses, the control of the manufac-
ture and storage of key chemicals in 
cells, and the senses of smell and taste. 
Plants and animals also use chemical 
communication. For example, ants lay 
down a chemical trail so that other ants 
can find a particular food supply. Ants 
also warn their fellow workers of 
approaching danger by emitting cer-
tain chemicals.
Molecules convey messages by 
fitting into appropriate receptor sites in 
a very specific way, which is deter-
mined by their structure. When a mol-
ecule occupies a receptor site, chemical 
processes are stimulated that produce 
the appropriate response. Sometimes 
receptors can be fooled, as in the use of 
artificial sweeteners‚Äîmolecules fit the 
sites on the taste buds that stimulate a 
‚Äúsweet‚Äù response in the brain, but they 
are not metabolized in the same way as 
natural sugars. Similar deception is 
useful in insect control. If an area is 
sprayed with synthetic female sex 
attractant molecules, the males of that 
species become so confused that 
mating does not occur.
A semiochemical is a molecule that 
delivers a message between members 
of the same or different species of plant 
or animal. There are three groups of 
these chemical messengers: allomones, 
kairomones, and pheromones. Each is 
of great ecological importance.
An allomone is defined as a chemi-
cal that somehow gives adaptive 
advantage to the producer. For 
example, leaves of the black walnut 
tree contain an herbicide, juglone, that 
appears after the leaves fall to the 
ground. Juglone is not toxic to grass or 
certain grains, but it is effective against 
plants such as apple trees that would 
compete for the available water and 
food supplies.
Antibiotics are also allomones, since 
the microorganisms produce them to 
inhibit other species from growing near 
them.
Many plants produce bad-tasting 
chemicals to protect themselves from 
plant-eating insects and animals. The 
familiar compound nicotine deters 
animals from eating the tobacco plant. 
The millipede sends an unmistakable 
‚Äúback off‚Äù message by squirting a 
predator with benzaldehyde and 
hydrogen cyanide.
Defense is not the only use of allo-
mones, however. Flowers use scent as a 
way to attract pollinating insects. Hon-
eybees, for instance, are guided to 
alfalfa and flowers by a series of sweet-
scented compounds.
Kairomones are chemical messen-
gers that bring advantageous news to 
the receiver, and the floral scents are 
kairomones from the honeybees‚Äô

The NO32 ion is known to be planar with 120-degree bond angles:
O
O

O
N
This planar structure is the one expected for three pairs of electrons around a central 
atom, which means that a double bond should be counted as one effective pair in 
viewpoint. Many predators are guided 
by kairomones emitted by their food. 
For example, apple skins exude a 
chemical that attracts the codling moth 
larva. In some cases kairomones help 
the underdog. Certain marine mollusks 
can pick up the ‚Äúscent‚Äù of their preda-
tors, the sea stars, and make their 
escape.
Pheromones are chemicals that 
affect receptors of the same species as 
the donor. That is, they are specific 
within a species. Releaser pheromones 
cause an immediate reaction in the 
receptor, and primer pheromones cause 
long-term effects. Examples of releaser 
pheromones are sex attractants of 
insects, generated in some species by 
the males and in others by the females. 
Sex pheromones also have been found 
in plants and mammals.
Alarm pheromones are highly vola-
tile compounds (ones easily changed 
to a gas) released to warn of danger. 
Honeybees produce isoamyl acetate 
(C7H14O2) in their sting glands. Because 
of its high volatility, this compound 
does not linger after the state of alert is 
over. Social behavior in insects is char-
acterized by the use of trail phero-
mones, which are used to indicate a 
food source. Social insects such as 
bees, ants, wasps, and termites use 
these substances. Since trail phero-
mones are less volatile compounds, the 
indicators persist for some time.
Primer pheromones, which cause 
long-term behavioral changes, are 
harder to isolate and identify. One 
example, however, is the ‚Äúqueen sub-
stance‚Äù produced by queen honeybees. 
All the eggs in a colony are laid by one 
queen bee. If she is removed from the 
hive or dies, the worker bees are acti-
vated by the absence of the queen 
substance and begin to feed royal jelly 
to bee larvae so as to raise a new 
queen. The queen substance also 
prevents the development of the work-
ers‚Äô ovaries so that only the queen 
herself can produce eggs.
Many studies of insect pheromones 
are now under way in the hope that 
they will provide a method of control-
ling insects that is more efficient and 
safer than the current chemical 
pesticides.
The queen bee secretes a chemical that prevents the worker bees from raising a competi-
tive sovereign.

using the VSEPR model. This makes sense because the two pairs of electrons 
involved in the double bond are not independent pairs. Both the electron pairs must 
be in the space between the nuclei of the two atoms to form the double bond. In 
other words, the double bond acts as one center of electron density to repel the other 
pairs of electrons. The same holds true for triple bonds. This leads us to another 
general rule: For the VSEPR model, multiple bonds count as one effective elec-
tron pair.
 
The molecular structure of nitrate also shows us one more important point: When 
a molecule exhibits resonance, any one of the resonance structures can be used to 
predict the molecular structure using the VSEPR model. These rules are illustrated 
in  Example 8.14.
Structures of Molecules with Multiple Bonds
Predict the molecular structure of the sulfur dioxide molecule. Is this molecule 
expected to have a dipole moment?
 
SOLUTION 
First, we must determine the Lewis structure for the SO2 molecule, which has 18 valence 
electrons. The expected resonance structures are
O
O
O
O
S
S
To determine the molecular structure, we must count the electron pairs around the 
sulfur atom. In each resonance structure the sulfur has one lone pair, one pair in a 
single bond, and one double bond. Counting the double bond as one pair yields three 
effective pairs around the sulfur. According to Table 8.7, a trigonal planar arrangement 
is required, which yields a V-shaped molecule:
O
O
S
120¬∞
Thus the structure of the SO2 molecule is expected to be V-shaped, with a 120-degree 
bond angle. The molecule has a dipole moment directed as shown:
O
O
S
Since the molecule is V-shaped, the polar bonds do not cancel.
See Exercises 8.127 and 8.128
 
It should be noted at this point that lone pairs that are oriented at least 120 degrees 
from other pairs do not produce significant distortions of bond angles. For example, 
the angle in the SO2 molecule is actually quite close to 120 degrees. We will follow the 
general principle that a 120-degree angle provides lone pairs with enough space so 
that distortions do not occur. Angles less than 120 degrees are distorted when lone 
pairs are present.

Molecules Containing No Single 
Central¬†Atom
So far we have considered molecules consisting of one central atom surrounded  
by other atoms. The VSEPR model can be readily extended to more complicated 
molecules, such as methanol (CH3OH). This molecule is represented by the follow-
ing Lewis structure:
C
H
H
H
H
O
The molecular structure can be predicted from the arrangement of pairs around the 
carbon and oxygen atoms. Note that there are four pairs of electrons around the car-
bon, which requires a tetrahedral arrangement [Fig. 8.22(a)]. The oxygen also has four 
pairs, which requires a tetrahedral arrangement. However, in this case the tetrahedron 
will be slightly distorted by the space requirements of the lone pairs [Fig. 8.22(b)]. The 
overall geometric arrangement for the molecule is shown in Fig. 8.22(c).
LET‚ÄôS REVIEW  Summary of the VSEPR Model
The rules for using the VSEPR model to predict molecular structure are as follows:
 ¬ª Determine the Lewis structure(s) for the molecule.
 ¬ª For molecules with resonance structures, use any of the structures to predict the 
molecular structure.
 ¬ª Sum the electron pairs around the central atom.
 ¬ª In counting pairs, count each multiple bond as a single effective pair.
 ¬ª The arrangement of the pairs is determined by minimizing electron-pair repulsions. These 
arrangements are shown in Table 8.7.
 ¬ª Lone pairs require more space than bonding pairs do. Choose an arrangement that gives 
the lone pairs as much room as possible. Recognize that the lone pairs may produce a slight 
distortion of the structure at angles less than 120 degrees.
The VSEPR Model‚ÄîHow Well Does It Work?
The VSEPR model is very simple. There are only a few rules to remember, yet the 
model correctly predicts the molecular structures of most molecules formed from non-
metallic elements. Molecules of any size can be treated by applying the VSEPR model 
to each appropriate atom (those bonded to at least two other atoms) in the molecule. 
Thus we can use this model to predict the structures of molecules with hundreds of 
atoms. It does, however, fail in a few instances. For example, phosphine (PH3), which 
has a Lewis structure analogous to that of ammonia,
N
H
H
H
P
H
H
H
would be predicted to have a molecular structure similar to that for NH3, with bond 
angles of approximately 107 degrees. However, the bond angles of phosphine are actu-
ally 94 degrees. There are ways of explaining this structure, but more rules have to be 
added to the model.

This again illustrates the point that simple models are bound to have exceptions. In 
introductory chemistry we want to use simple models that fit the majority of cases; we 
are willing to accept a few failures rather than complicate the model. The amazing 
thing about the VSEPR model is that such a simple model predicts correctly the struc-
tures of so many molecules.

 1. Distinguish between the terms electronegativity versus 
electron affinity, covalent bond versus ionic bond, and 
pure covalent bond versus polar covalent bond. Charac-
terize the types of bonds in terms of electronegativity 
difference. Energetically, why do ionic and covalent 
bonds form?
 2. When an element forms an anion, what happens to the 
radius? When an element forms a cation, what happens 
to the radius? Why? Define the term isoelectronic. 
When comparing sizes of ions, which ion has the larg-
est radius and which ion has the smallest radius in an 
isoelectronic series? Why?
 3. Define the term lattice energy. Why, energetically, do 
ionic compounds form? Figure 8.11 illustrates the 
energy changes involved in the formation of MgO(s) 
and NaF(s). Why is the lattice energy of MgO(s) so 
different from that of NaF(s)? Magnesium oxide is 
composed of Mg21 and O22 ions. Energetically, why 
does Mg21O22 form and not Mg1O2? Why doesn‚Äôt 
Mg31O32 form?
 4. Explain how bond energies can be used to estimate DH 
for a reaction. Why is this an estimate of DH? How do 
the product bond strengths compare to the reactant bond 
strengths for an exothermic reaction? For an endother-
mic reaction? What is the relationship between the 
number of bonds between two atoms and bond 
strength? Bond length?
 5. Give a rationale for the octet rule and the duet rule for 
H in terms of orbitals. Give the steps for drawing a 
Lewis structure for a molecule or ion. In general,  
molecules and ions always follow the octet rule unless 
it is impossible. The three types of exceptions are 
molecules/ ions with too few electrons, molecules/ions 
with an odd number of electrons, and molecules/ions 
with too many electrons. Which atoms sometimes have 
fewer than 8 electrons around them? Give an example. 
Which atoms sometimes have more than 8 electrons 
around them? Give some examples. Why are odd- 
electron species generally very reactive and uncom-
mon? Give an example of an odd-electron molecule.
 6. Explain the terms resonance and delocalized electrons. 
When a substance exhibits resonance, we say that none 
of the individual Lewis structures accurately portrays 
the bonding in the substance. Why do we draw reso-
nance structures?
 7. Define formal charge and explain how to calculate it. 
What is the purpose of the formal charge? Organic 
compounds are composed mostly of carbon and hydro-
gen, but also may have oxygen, nitrogen, and/or halo-
gens in the formula. Formal charge arguments work 
very well for organic compounds when drawing the best 
Lewis structure. How do C, H, N, O, and Cl satisfy the 
octet rule in organic compounds so as to have a formula 
charge of zero?

SO3, NF3, IF3, CF4, SF4, XeF4, PF5, IF5, and SCl6. These 
12 compounds are all examples of different molecular 
structures. Draw the Lewis structures for each and pre-
dict the molecular structure. Predict the bond angles and

geometries.
 8. Explain the main postulate of the VSEPR model. List 
the five base geometries (along with bond angles) that

repulsions. Why are bond angles sometimes slightly 
less than predicted in actual molecules as compared to 
what is predicted by the VSEPR model?
 9. Give two requirements that should be satisfied for a 
molecule to be polar. Explain why CF4 and XeF4 are 
nonpolar compounds (have no net dipole moments) 
while SF4 is polar (has a net dipole moment). Is CO2 
polar? What about COS? Explain.

I
n Chapter 8 we discussed the fundamental concepts of bonding and introduced the 
most widely used simple model for covalent bonding: the localized electron model. 
We saw the usefulness of a bonding model as a means for systematizing chemistry by 
allowing us to look at molecules in terms of individual bonds. We also saw that molec-
ular structure can be predicted by minimizing electron-pair repulsions. In this chapter 
we will examine bonding models in more detail, particularly focusing on the role of 
orbitals.
9.1 Hybridization and the Localized 
Electron Model
As we saw in Chapter 8, the localized electron model views a molecule as a collection 
of atoms bound together by sharing electrons between their atomic orbitals. The 
arrangement of valence electrons is represented by the Lewis structure (or structures, 
where resonance occurs), and the molecular geometry can be predicted from the 
VSEPR model. In this section we will describe the atomic orbitals used to share elec-
trons and hence to form the bonds.
sp3 Hybridization
Let us reconsider the bonding in methane, which has the Lewis structure and molecu-
lar geometry shown in Fig. 9.1. In general, we assume that bonding involves only the 
valence orbitals. This means that the hydrogen atoms in methane use 1s orbitals. The 
valence orbitals of a carbon atom are the 2s and 2p orbitals shown in Fig. 9.2. In think-
ing about how carbon can use these orbitals to bond to the hydrogen atoms, we can see 
two related problems:
1.
Using the 2p and 2s atomic orbitals will lead to two different types of COH 
bonds: (a) those from the overlap of a 2p orbital of carbon and a 1s orbital of 
hydrogen (there will be three of these) and (b) those from the overlap of a 2s 
orbital of carbon and a 1s orbital of hydrogen (there will be one of these). This is 
a problem because methane is known to have four identical COH bonds.

quantum level that contains electrons on a

three COH bonds formed with these orbitals to be oriented at 90-degree angles:

However, the methane molecule is known by experiment to be tetrahedral with 
bond angles of 109.5 degrees.
 
This analysis leads to one of two conclusions: Either the simple localized electron 
model is wrong or carbon adopts a set of atomic orbitals other than its ‚Äúnative‚Äù 2s and 
2p orbitals to bond to the hydrogen atoms in forming the methane molecule. The sec-
ond conclusion seems more reasonable. The 2s and 2p orbitals present on an isolated 
carbon atom may not be the best set of orbitals for bonding; a new set of atomic orbit-
als might better serve the carbon atom in forming molecules. To account for the known 
structure of methane, it makes sense to assume that the carbon atom has four equiva-
lent atomic orbitals, arranged tetrahedrally. In fact such a set of orbitals can be 
obtained quite readily by combining the carbon 2s and 2p orbitals, as shown schemati-
cally in Fig. 9.3. This mixing of the native atomic orbitals to form special orbitals for 
bonding is called hybridization., The four new orbitals are called sp3 orbitals because 
they are formed from one 2s and three 2p orbitals. We say that the carbon atom under-
goes sp3 hybridization or is sp3 hybridized. The four sp3 orbitals are identical in 
shape, each one having a large lobe and a small lobe (Fig. 9.4). The four orbitals are 
oriented in space so that the large lobes form a tetrahedral arrangement, as shown in 
Fig. 9.3.
 
The hybridization of the carbon 2s and 2p orbitals also can be represented by an 
orbital energy-level diagram (Fig. 9.5). Note that electrons have been omitted because 
Hybridization is a modification of the 
localized electron model to account for 
the observation that atoms often seem 
to use special atomic orbitals in forming 
molecules.
Note that the shapes of the hybrid  orbitals 
shown in Figure 9.3 are ‚Äúmushroom-like,‚Äù 
calculated from wave functions.

we do not need to be concerned with the electron arrangements on the individual  
atoms‚Äîit is the total number of electrons and the arrangement of these electrons in the 
molecule that are important. We are assuming that carbon‚Äôs atomic orbitals are rear-
ranged to accommodate the best electron arrangement for the molecule as a whole. 
The new sp3 atomic orbitals on carbon are used to share electron pairs with the 1s 
orbitals from the four hydrogen atoms (Fig. 9.6).
 
At this point let‚Äôs summarize the bonding in the methane molecule. The experimen-
tally known structure of this molecule can be explained if we assume that the carbon 
atom adopts a special set of atomic orbitals. These new orbitals are obtained by com-
bining the 2s and the three 2p orbitals of the carbon atom to produce four identically 
shaped orbitals that are oriented toward the corners of a tetrahedron and are used to 
bond to the hydrogen atoms. Thus the four sp3 orbitals on carbon in methane are pos-
tulated to account for its known structure.
 
Remember this principle: Whenever a set of equivalent tetrahedral atomic orbit-
als is required by an atom, this model assumes that the atom adopts a set of sp3 
orbitals; the atom becomes sp3 hybridized.
 
It is really not surprising that an atom in a molecule might adopt a different set of 
atomic orbitals (called hybrid orbitals) from those it has in the free state. It does not 
seem unreasonable that to achieve minimum energy, an atom uses one set of atomic 
orbitals in the free state and a different set in a molecule. This is consistent with the 
idea that a molecule is more than simply a sum of its parts. What the atoms in a mol-
ecule were like before the molecule was formed is not as important as how the elec-
trons are best arranged in the molecule. Therefore, this model assumes that the 
individual atoms respond as needed to achieve the minimum energy for the molecule.
CRITICAL THINKING What if the sp3 hybrid orbitals were higher 
in energy than the p orbitals in the free atom? How would this affect our model 
of bonding?
The Localized Electron Model I
Describe the bonding in the ammonia molecule using the localized electron model.
 
SOLUTION 
A complete description of the bonding involves three steps:
1. writing the Lewis structure
2. determining the arrangement of electron pairs using the VSEPR model
3. determining the hybrid atomic orbitals needed to describe the bonding in the 
molecule

The four electron pairs around the nitrogen atom require a tetrahedral arrangement 
to minimize repulsions. We have seen that a tetrahedral set of sp3 hybrid orbitals is 
obtained by combining the 2s and three 2p orbitals. In the NH3 molecule, three of  
the sp3 orbitals are used to form bonds to the three hydrogen atoms, and the fourth  
sp3 orbital holds the lone pair (Fig. 9.7).

Ethylene (C2H4) is an important starting material in the manufacture of plastics. The 
C2H4 molecule has 12 valence electrons and the following Lewis structure:
H
H
H
H
C
C
We saw in Chapter 8 that a double bond acts as one effective pair, so in the ethylene 
molecule each carbon is surrounded by three effective pairs. This requires a trigonal 
planar arrangement with bond angles of 120 degrees. What orbitals do the carbon 
atoms in this molecule employ? The molecular geometry requires a set of orbitals in 
one plane at angles of 120 degrees. Since the 2s and 2p valence orbitals of carbon do 
not have the required arrangement, we need a set of hybrid orbitals.
 
The sp3 orbitals we have just considered will not work because they are at angles of 
109.5 degrees rather than the required 120 degrees. In ethylene the carbon atom must 
hybridize in a different manner. A set of three orbitals arranged at 120-degree angles 
in the same plane can be obtained by combining one s orbital and two p orbitals, as 
shown in Fig. 9.8. The orbital energy-level diagram for this arrangement is shown in 
Fig. 9.9. Since one 2s and two 2p orbitals are used to form these hybrid orbitals, this is 
called sp2 hybridization. Note from Fig. 9.8 that the plane of the sp2 hybridized orbitals 
is determined by which p orbitals are used. Since in this case we have arbitrarily 
decided to use the px and py orbitals, the hybrid orbitals are centered in the xy plane.
 
In forming the sp2 orbitals, one 2p orbital on carbon has not been used. This remain-
ing p orbital (pz) is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the sp2 orbitals, as shown in 
Fig. 9.10.
 
Now we will see how these orbitals can be used to account for the bonds in ethyl-
ene. The three sp2 orbitals on each carbon can be used to share electrons (Fig. 9.11). 
In each of these bonds, the electron pair is shared in an area centered on a line running 
between the atoms. This type of covalent bond is called a sigma (s) bond. In the 
A double bond acts as one effective 
electron pair.
sp2 hybridization gives a trigonal planar 
arrangement of atomic orbitals.
Note in Fig. 9.10 and the figures that 
follow that the orbital lobes are artificially

relative orientations.

ethylene molecule, the s bonds are formed using sp2 orbitals on each carbon atom 
and the 1s orbital on each hydrogen atom.
 
How can we explain the double bond between the carbon atoms? In the s bond the 
electron pair occupies the space between the carbon atoms. The second bond must 
therefore result from sharing an electron pair in the space above and below the s bond. 
This type of bond can be formed using the 2p orbital perpendicular to the sp2 hybrid 
orbitals on each carbon atom (see Fig. 9.10). These parallel p orbitals can share an 
electron pair, which occupies the space above and below a line joining the atoms, to 
form a pi (p) bond (Fig. 9.12).
 
Note that s bonds are formed from orbitals whose lobes point toward each other, 
but p bonds result from parallel orbitals. A double bond always consists of one s 
bond, where the electron pair is located directly between the atoms, and one p bond, 
where the shared pair occupies the space above and below the s bond.
 
We can now completely specify the orbitals that this model assumes are used to 
form the bonds in the ethylene molecule. As shown in Fig. 9.13, the carbon atoms use 
sp2 hybrid orbitals to form the s bonds to the hydrogen atoms and to each other, and 
they use p orbitals to form the p bond with each other. Note that we have accounted 
fully for the Lewis structure of ethylene with its carbon‚Äìcarbon double bond and  
carbon‚Äìhydrogen single bonds.
 
This example illustrates an important general principle of this model: Whenever 
an atom is surrounded by three effective pairs, a set of sp2 hybrid orbitals is 
required.

sp Hybridization
Another type of hybridization occurs in carbon dioxide, which has the following Lewis 
structure:
O
O
C
In the CO2 molecule, the carbon atom has two effective pairs that will be arranged at 
an angle of 180 degrees. We therefore need a pair of atomic orbitals oriented in oppo-
site directions. This requires a new type of hybridization, since neither sp3 nor sp2 
hybrid orbitals will fit this case. To obtain two hybrid orbitals arranged at 180 degrees 
requires sp hybridization, involving one s orbital and one p orbital (Fig. 9.14).
 
In terms of this model, two effective pairs around an atom will always require 
sp  hybridization of that atom. The sp orbitals of carbon in carbon dioxide can be seen 
in Fig. 9.15, and the corresponding orbital energy-level diagram for their formation is 
given in Fig. 9.16. These sp hybrid orbitals are used to form the s bonds between the 
carbon and the oxygen atoms. Note that two 2p orbitals remain unchanged on the sp 
hybridized carbon. These are used to form the p bonds with the oxygen atoms.
 
In the CO2 molecule, each oxygen atom* has three effective pairs around it, requir-
ing a trigonal planar arrangement of the pairs. Since a trigonal set of hybrid orbitals 
requires sp2 hybridization, each oxygen atom is sp2 hybridized. One p orbital on each 
oxygen is unchanged and is used for the p bond with the carbon atom.
 
Now we are ready to use our model to describe the bonding in carbon dioxide. The 
sp orbitals on carbon form s bonds with the sp2 orbitals on the two oxygen atoms (see 
Fig. 9.15). The remaining sp2 orbitals on the oxygen atoms hold lone pairs. The  
p bonds between the carbon atom and each oxygen atom are formed by the overlap of 
parallel 2p orbitals. The sp hybridized carbon atom has two unhybridized p orbitals 
(Fig. 9.17). Each of these p orbitals is used to form a p bond with an oxygen atom 
More rigorous theoretical models of CO2 
indicate that each of the oxygen atoms 
uses two p orbitals simultaneously to form 
the pi bonds to the carbon atom, thus 
leading to unusually strong CPO bonds.
*We will assume that minimizing electron repulsions also is important for the peripheral atoms in 
a molecule and apply the VSEPR model to these atoms as well.

(Fig. 9.18). The total bonding picture for the CO2 molecule is shown in Fig. 9.19. Note 
that this picture of the bonding neatly explains the arrangement of electrons predicted 
by the Lewis structure.
 
Another molecule whose bonding can be described by sp hybridization is acetylene 
(C2H2), which has the systematic name ethyne. The Lewis structure for acetylene is
HiC{CiH
Because the triple bond counts as one effective repulsive unit, each carbon has two 
effective pairs, which requires a linear arrangement. Thus each carbon atom requires 
sp hybridization, leaving two unchanged p orbitals (see Fig. 9.16). One of the oppo-
sitely oriented (see Fig. 9.14) sp orbitals is used to form a bond to the hydrogen atom; 
the other sp orbital overlaps with the similar sp orbital on the other carbon to form  
the sigma bond. The two pi bonds are formed from the overlap of the two p orbitals 
on each carbon. This accounts for the triple bond (one sigma and two pi bonds) in 
acetylene.
The Localized Electron Model II
Describe the bonding in the N2 molecule.
 
SOLUTION 
The Lewis structure for the nitrogen molecule is
: N{N :
where each nitrogen atom is surrounded by two effective pairs. (Remember that a 
multiple bond counts as one effective pair.) This gives a linear arrangement (180 
degrees) requiring a pair of oppositely directed orbitals. This situation requires sp 
hybridization. Each nitrogen atom in the nitrogen molecule has two sp hybrid orbitals 
and two unchanged p orbitals [Fig. 9.20(a)]. The sp orbitals are used to form the  
s bond between the nitrogen atoms and to hold lone pairs [Fig. 9.20(b)]. The p orbitals 
are used to form the two p bonds [Fig. 9.20(c)]; each pair of overlapping parallel  
p orbitals holds one electron pair. Such bonding accounts for the electron arrangement 
given by the Lewis structure. The triple bond consists of a s bond (overlap of two  
sp orbitals) and two p bonds (each one from an overlap of two p orbitals). In addition, 
a lone pair occupies an sp orbital on each nitrogen atom.

To illustrate the treatment of a molecule in which the central atom exceeds the octet 
rule, consider the bonding in the phosphorus pentachloride molecule (PCl5). The 
Lewis structure
P
Cl
Cl

shows that the phosphorus atom is surrounded by five electron pairs. Since five pairs 
require a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement, we need a trigonal bipyramidal set of 
atomic orbitals on phosphorus. Such a set of orbitals is formed by dsp3 hybridization 
of one d¬†orbital, one s orbital, and three p orbitals (Fig. 9.21). Although this model is 
convenient, its use of the d orbitals does not give an accurate picture of the actual bond-
ing in this molecule. Recent research shows that a more complex model for the bonding 
in molecules that exceed the octet rule is needed. This new model does not employ 
d¬†orbitals for describing the bonding in these molecules. (A description of this model is 
beyond the scope of this text.) This problem reminds us once again that the simple 
models we use often contain oversimplifications. We will continue to employ this sim-
ple model even with its problems because of its convenience and widespread use.
 
In this model we assume that the phosphorus atom in the PCl5 molecule uses its five 
dsp3 orbitals to share electrons with the five chlorine atoms. Note that a set of five 
effective pairs around a given atom always requires a trigonal bipyramidal 
arrangement, which in turn implies dsp3 hybridization of that atom.
 
The Lewis structure for PCl5 shows that each chlorine atom is surrounded by four 
electron pairs. This requires a tetrahedral arrangement, which in turn requires a set of 
four sp3 orbitals on each chlorine atom.
 
Now we can describe the bonding in the PCl5 molecule shown in Fig. 9.22. The five 
POCl s bonds are formed by sharing electrons between a dsp3 orbital on the phospho-
rus atom and an orbital on each chlorine.
Although this simple model can be used 
to account for the bonding in these 
molecules,  it now seems clear that it 
mistakenly invokes the use of the d orbitals 
in the actual bonding of the molecule.

shows that the central iodine atom has five pairs of electrons (see Section 8.11). A set 
of five pairs requires a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement, which in turn requires a set 
of dsp3 orbitals. The outer iodine atoms have four pairs of electrons, which calls for a 
tetrahedral arrangement and sp3 hybridization.
 
Thus the central iodine is dsp3 hybridized. Three of these hybrid orbitals hold lone 
pairs, and two of them overlap with sp3 orbitals of the other two iodine atoms to form 
s bonds.

This requires an octahedral arrangement of pairs and in turn this model implies an octa-
hedral set of six hybrid orbitals, or d2sp3 hybridization, in which two d orbitals, one s 
orbital, and three p orbitals are combined (Fig. 9.23). Six electron pairs around an atom 
are  always arranged octahedrally and imply d2sp3 hybridization of the atom. Each of 
the d2sp3 orbitals on the sulfur atom is used to bond to a fluorine atom. Since there are 
four pairs on each fluorine atom, the fluorine atoms are assumed to be sp3 hybridized.

As seen in Example 8.13, XeF4 has six pairs of electrons around xenon that are arranged 
octahedrally to minimize repulsions. An octahedral set of six atomic orbitals is required 
by this model to hold these electrons, and the xenon atom is d2sp3 hybridized.

The Localized Electron Model: A Summary
The description of a molecule using the localized electron model involves three dis-
tinct steps.
PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY
Using the Localized Electron Model
1. Draw the Lewis structure(s).
2. Determine the arrangement of electron pairs using the VSEPR model.
3. Specify the hybrid orbitals needed to accommodate the electron pairs.
It is important to do the steps in this order. For a model to be successful, it must follow 
nature‚Äôs priorities. In the case of bonding, it seems clear that the tendency for a mole-
cule to minimize its energy is more important than the maintenance of the characteris-
tics of atoms as they exist in the free state. The atoms adjust to meet the ‚Äúneeds‚Äù of the 
molecule. When considering the bonding in a particular molecule, therefore, we 
always start with the molecule rather than the component atoms. In the molecule the 
electrons will be arranged to give each atom a noble gas configuration, where possible, 
and to minimize electron-pair repulsions. We then assume that the atoms adjust their 
orbitals by hybridization to allow the molecule to adopt the structure that gives the 
minimum energy.
 
In applying the localized electron model, we must remember not to overemphasize 
the characteristics of the separate atoms. It is not where the valence electrons originate 
that is important; it is where they are needed in the molecule to achieve stability. In the 
same vein, it is not the orbitals in the isolated atom that matter, but which orbitals the 
molecule requires for minimum energy.
 
The requirements for the various types of hybridization are summarized in Fig. 9.24 
on the following page.

Each atom has two effective pairs, which means that both are sp hybridized. The 
triple bond consists of a s bond produced by overlap of an sp orbital from each 
atom and two p bonds produced by overlap of 2p orbitals from each atom. The 
lone pairs are in sp orbitals. Since the CO molecule has only two atoms, it must 
be linear.

9.2 The Molecular Orbital Model
We have seen that the localized electron model is of great value in interpreting the 
structure and bonding of molecules. However, there are some problems with this 
model. For example, it incorrectly assumes that electrons are localized, and so the 
concept of resonance must be added. Also, the model does not deal effectively with 
molecules containing unpaired electrons. And finally, the model gives no direct infor-
mation about bond energies.

Another model often used to describe bonding is the molecular orbital model. To 
introduce the assumptions, methods, and results of this model, we will consider the sim-
plest of all molecules, H2, which consists of two protons and two electrons. A very stable 
molecule, H2 is lower in energy than the separated hydrogen atoms by 432 kJ/mol.
 
Since the hydrogen molecule consists of protons and electrons, the same compo-
nents found in separated hydrogen atoms, it seems reasonable to use a theory similar 
to the atomic theory discussed in Chapter 7, which assumes that the electrons in an 
atom exist in orbitals of a given energy. Can we apply this same type of model to the 
hydrogen  molecule? Yes. In fact, describing the H2 molecule in terms of quantum 
mechanics is quite straightforward.
 
However, even though it is formulated rather easily, this problem cannot be solved 
exactly. The difficulty is the same as that in dealing with polyelectronic atoms‚Äîthe 
electron correlation problem. Since we do not know the details of the electron move-
ments, we cannot deal with the electron‚Äìelectron interactions in a specific way. We 
need to make approximations that allow a solution of the problem but do not destroy 
the model‚Äôs physical integrity. The success of these approximations can be measured 
only by comparing predictions based on theory with experimental observations. In this 
case we will see that the simplified model works very well.
 
Just as atomic orbitals are solutions to the quantum mechanical treatment of atoms, 
molecular orbitals (MOs) are solutions to the molecular problem. Molecular orbitals 
have many of the same characteristics as atomic orbitals. Two of the most important 
are that they can hold two electrons with opposite spins and that the square of the 
molecular orbital wave function indicates electron probability.
 
We will now describe the bonding in the hydrogen molecule using this model. The 
first step is to obtain the hydrogen molecule‚Äôs orbitals, a process that is greatly simpli-
fied if we assume that the molecular orbitals can be constructed from the hydrogen 1s 
atomic orbitals.
 
When the quantum mechanical equations for the hydrogen molecule are solved, 
two molecular orbitals result, which can be represented as
MO1 5 1sA 1 1sB
MO2 5 1sA 2 1sB
where 1sA and 1sB represent the 1s orbitals from the two separated hydrogen atoms. 
This process is shown schematically in Fig. 9.25.
 
The orbital properties of most interest are size, shape (described by the electron 
probability distribution), and energy. These properties for the hydrogen molecular 
orbitals are represented in Fig. 9.26. From Fig. 9.26 we can note several important 
points:
1. The electron probability of both molecular orbitals is centered along the line 
passing through the two nuclei. For MO1 the greatest electron probability is 
between the  nuclei, and for MO2 it is on either side of the nuclei. This type of 
electron distribution is  described as sigma (s), as in the localized electron model. 
Accordingly, we refer to MO1 and MO2 as sigma (s) molecular orbitals.
Molecular orbital theory parallels the 
atomic theory discussed in Chapter 7.

The phases of the orbitals are shown by 
signs inside the boundary surfaces. When 
the orbitals are added, the matching 
phases produce constructive interference, 
which gives enhanced electron proba-
bility between the nuclei. This results in a 
bonding  molecular orbital. When one 
orbital is subtracted from the other, 
destructive  interference occurs between 
the opposite phases, leading to a node 
between the nuclei. This is an anti-
bonding MO.

9.2 The Molecular Orbital Model

2. In the molecule only the molecular orbitals are available for occupation by elec-
trons. The 1s atomic orbitals of the hydrogen atoms no longer exist, because the  
H2 molecule‚Äîa new entity‚Äîhas its own set of new orbitals.
3. MO1 is lower in energy than the 1s orbitals of free hydrogen atoms, while 
MO2 is higher in energy than the 1s orbitals. This fact has very important 
implications for the stability of the H2 molecule, since if the two electrons 
(one from each hydrogen atom) occupy the lower-energy MO1, they will have 
lower energy than they do in the two separate hydrogen atoms. This situation 
favors molecule formation, because nature tends to seek the lowest energy 
state. That is, the driving force for molecule formation is that the molecular 
orbital available to the two electrons has lower energy than the atomic orbitals 
these electrons occupy in the separated atoms. This situation is favorable to 
bonding, or probonding.
 
On the other hand, if the two electrons were forced to occupy the higher-
energy MO2, they would be definitely antibonding. In this case, these electrons 
would have lower energy in the separated atoms than in the molecule, and the 
separated state would be favored. Of course, since the lower-energy MO1 is avail-
able, the two electrons occupy that MO and the molecule is stable.
 
We have seen that the molecular orbitals of the hydrogen molecule fall into 
two classes: bonding and antibonding. A bonding molecular orbital is lower in 
energy than the atomic orbitals of which it is composed. Electrons in this type of 
orbital will favor the molecule; that is, they will favor bonding. An antibonding 
molecular orbital is higher in energy than the atomic orbitals of which it is 
composed. Electrons in this type of orbital will favor the separated atoms (they 
are antibonding). Figure 9.27  illustrates these ideas.
4. Figure 9.26 shows that for the bonding molecular orbital in the H2 molecule the 
electrons have the greatest probability of being between the nuclei. This is 
exactly what we would expect, since the electrons can lower their energies by 
being simultaneously attracted by both nuclei. On the other hand, the electron 
distribution for the  antibonding molecular orbital is such that the electrons are 
mainly outside the space between the nuclei. This type of distribution is not 
expected to provide any bonding force. In fact, it causes the electrons to be higher 
in energy than in the separated atoms. Thus the molecular orbital model produces 
electron distributions and energies that agree with our basic ideas of bonding. 
This fact reassures us that the model is physically reasonable.
5. The labels on molecular orbitals indicate their symmetry (shape), the parent 
atomic orbitals, and whether they are bonding or antibonding. Antibonding char-
acter is indicated by an asterisk. For the H2 molecule, both MOs have s symme-
try, and both are constructed from hydrogen 1s atomic orbitals. The molecular 
orbitals for H2 are therefore labeled as follows:
 MO1 5 s1s
 MO2 5 s1s*
6. Molecular electron configurations can be written in much the same way as atomic 
(electron) configurations. Since the H2 molecule has two electrons in the s1s 
molecular orbital, the electron configuration is s1s2.
7. Each molecular orbital can hold two electrons, but the spins must be opposite.
8. Orbitals are conserved. The number of molecular orbitals will always be the 
same as the number of atomic orbitals used to construct them.
Many of the above points are summarized in Fig. 9.28.
 
Now suppose we could form the H22 ion from a hydride ion (H2) and a hydrogen 
atom. Would this species be stable? Since the H2 ion has the configuration 1s2 
and the H atom has a 1s1 configuration, we will use 1s atomic orbitals to construct 
Bonding will result if the molecule has 
lower energy than the separated atoms.

the MO diagram for the H22 ion (Fig. 9.29). The electron configuration for H22 is 
(s1s)2(s1s*)1.
 
The key idea is that the H22 ion will be stable if it has a lower energy than its sepa-
rated parts. From Fig. 9.29 we see that in going from the separated H2 ion and H atom 
to the H22 ion, the model predicts that two electrons are lowered in energy and one 
electron is raised in energy. In other words, two electrons are bonding and one electron 
is antibonding. Since more electrons favor bonding, H22 is predicted to be a stable 
entity‚Äîa bond has formed. But how would we expect the bond strengths in the mol-
ecules of H2 and H22 to compare?
 
In the formation of the H2 molecule, two electrons are lowered in energy and no 
electrons are raised in energy compared with the parent atoms. When H22 is formed, 
two  electrons are lowered in energy and one is raised, producing a net lowering of the 
energy of only one electron. Thus the model predicts that H2 is twice as stable as H22 
with respect to their separated components. In other words, the bond in the H2 mole-
cule is  predicted to be about twice as strong as the bond in the H22 ion.
Bond Order
To indicate bond strength, we use the concept of bond order. Bond order is the differ-
ence between the number of bonding electrons and the number of antibonding elec-
trons divided by 2.
Bond order 5 number of bonding electrons 2 number of antibonding electrons
2
We divide by 2 because, from the localized electron model, we are used to thinking of 
bonds in terms of pairs of electrons.
Since the H2 molecule has two bonding electrons and no antibonding electrons, the 
bond order is
Bond order 5 2 2 0
2
5 1
The H22 ion has two bonding electrons and one antibonding electron; the bond order is
Bond order 5 2 2 1
2
5 1
2
Bond order is an indication of bond strength because it reflects the difference 
between the number of bonding electrons and the number of antibonding electrons. 
Larger bond order means greater bond strength.
We will now apply the molecular orbital model to the helium molecule (He2). Does 
this model predict that this molecule will be stable? Since the He atom has a 1s2 con-
figuration, 1s orbitals are used to construct the molecular orbitals, and the molecule will 
have four electrons. From the diagram shown in Fig. 9.30, it is apparent that two elec-
trons are raised in energy and two are lowered in energy. Thus the bond order is zero:
2 2 2
2
5 0
This implies that the He2 molecule is not stable with respect to the two free He atoms, 
which agrees with the observation that helium gas consists of individual He atoms.
9.3 Bonding in Homonuclear 
Diatomic Molecules
In this section we consider homonuclear diatomic molecules (those composed of two 
identical atoms) of elements in Period 2 of the periodic table. Since the lithium atom 
has a 1s22s1 electron configuration, it would seem that we should use the Li 1s and 2s 
orbitals to form the molecular orbitals of the Li2 molecule. However, the 1s orbitals on 
Although the model predicts that H22 
should be stable, this ion has never been 
observed, again emphasizing the perils of 
simple models.

the lithium atoms are much smaller than the 2s orbitals and therefore do not overlap in 
space to any appreciable extent (Fig. 9.31). Thus the two electrons in each 1s orbital 
can be assumed to be localized and not to participate in the bonding. To participate in 
molecular orbitals, atomic orbitals must overlap in space. This means that only the 
valence orbitals of the atoms contribute significantly to the molecular orbitals of a 
particular molecule.
 
The molecular orbital diagram of the Li2 molecule and the shapes of its bonding 
and antibonding MOs are shown in Fig. 9.32. The electron configuration for Li2 
(valence electrons only) is s2s2, and the bond order is
2 2 0

Li2 is a stable molecule (has lower energy than two separated lithium atoms). How-
ever, this does not mean that Li2 is the most stable form of elemental lithium. In fact, 
at normal temperature and pressure, lithium exists as a solid containing many lithium 
atoms bound to each other.
 
For the beryllium molecule (Be2), the bonding and antibonding orbitals both con-
tain two electrons. In this case the bond order is (2 2 2)y2 5 0, and since Be2 is not 
more stable than two separated Be atoms, no molecule forms. However, beryllium 
metal contains many beryllium atoms bonded to each other and is stable for reasons 
we will discuss in Chapter 10.
 
Since the boron atom has a 1s22s22p1 configuration, we describe the B2 molecule by 
considering how p atomic orbitals combine to form molecular orbitals. Recall that  
p orbitals have two lobes and that they occur in sets of three mutually perpendicular 
 orbitals [Fig. 9.33(a)]. When two B atoms approach each other, two pairs of p orbitals

can overlap in a parallel fashion [Fig. 9.33(b) and (c)] and one pair can overlap head-
on [Fig. 9.33(d)].
 
First, let‚Äôs consider the molecular orbitals from the head-on overlap. The bonding 
orbital is formed by reversing the sign of the right orbital so the positive phases of both 
 orbitals match between the nuclei to produce constructive interference. This leads to 
enhanced electron probability between the nuclei. The antibonding orbital is formed 
by the direct combination of the orbitals, which gives destructive interference of the 
positive phase of one orbital with the negative phase of the second orbital. This pro-
duces a node between the nuclei, which gives decreased electron probability. Note that 
the electrons in the bonding MO are, as expected, concentrated between the nuclei, 
and the electrons in the antibonding MO are concentrated outside the area between the 
two nuclei. Also, both these MOs are s molecular orbitals.

When the parallel p orbitals are combined with the positive and negative phases 
matched, constructive interference occurs, giving a bonding p orbital. When the orbit-
als have opposite phases (the signs of one orbital are reversed), destructive interference 
occurs, resulting in an antibonding p orbital.

Since the electron probability lies above and below the line between the nuclei, 
both the orbitals are pi (p) molecular orbitals. They are designated as p2p for the 
bonding MO and p2p* for the antibonding MO. A similar set of p molecular orbitals 
is formed from overlap of the parallel pz atomic orbitals.
 
Let‚Äôs try to make an educated guess about the relative energies of the s and p mo- 
lecular orbitals formed from the 2p atomic orbitals. Would we expect the electrons to 
prefer the s bonding orbital (where the electron probability is concentrated in the area 
between the nuclei) or the p bonding orbital? The s orbital would seem to have the 
lower energy, since the electrons are closest to the two nuclei. This agrees with the 
observation that s interactions are stronger than p interactions.

Figure 9.34 gives the molecular orbital energy-level diagram expected when the 
two sets of 2p orbitals on the boron atoms combine to form molecular orbitals. Note 
that there are two p bonding orbitals at the same energy (degenerate orbitals) formed 
from the two pairs of parallel p orbitals, and there are two degenerate p antibonding 
orbitals. The energy of the p2p orbitals is expected to be higher than that of the s2p 
orbital because s  interactions are generally stronger than p interactions.
 
To construct the total molecular orbital diagram for the B2 molecule, we make the 
assumption that the 2s and 2p orbitals combine separately (in other words, there is no 
2s22p mixing). The resulting diagram is shown in Fig. 9.35. Note that B2 has six 
valence  electrons. (Remember the 1s orbitals and electrons are assumed not to partici-
pate in the bonding.) This diagram predicts the bond order:
4 2 2
2
5 1
Therefore, B2 should be a stable molecule.
Paramagnetism
At this point we need to discuss an additional molecular property‚Äîmagnetism. Most 
 materials have no magnetism until they are placed in a magnetic field. However, in the 
presence of such a field, magnetism of two types can be induced. Paramagnetism 
causes the substance to be attracted into the inducing magnetic field. Diamagnetism 
causes the substance to be repelled from the inducing magnetic field. Figure 9.36 illus-
trates how paramagnetism is measured. The sample is weighed with the electromagnet 
turned off and then weighed again with the electromagnet turned on. An increase in 
weight when the field is turned on indicates the sample is paramagnetic. Studies have 
shown that  paramagnetism is associated with unpaired electrons and diamagnetism is 
associated with paired electrons. Any substance that has both paired and unpaired 
electrons will exhibit a net paramagnetism, since the effect of paramagnetism is much 
stronger than that of diamagnetism.
 
The molecular orbital energy-level diagram represented in Fig. 9.35 predicts that 
the B2 molecule will be diamagnetic, since the MOs contain only paired electrons. 
However, experiments show that B2 is actually paramagnetic with two unpaired elec-
trons. Why does the model yield the wrong prediction? This is yet another illustration 
of how models are developed and used. In general, we try to use the simplest possible 
model that accounts for all the important observations. In this case, although the sim-
plest model successfully describes the diatomic molecules up to B2, it certainly is 
suspect if it cannot describe the B2 molecule correctly. This means we must either 
discard the model or find a way to  modify it.
 
Let‚Äôs consider one assumption that we made. In our treatment of B2, we have 
assumed that the s and p orbitals combine separately to form molecular orbitals. Cal-
culations show that when the s and p orbitals are allowed to mix in the same molecular 
 orbital, a different energy-level diagram results for B2 (Fig. 9.37). Note that even 
though the s and p contributions to the MOs are no longer separate, we retain the 
simple orbital designations. The energies of p2p and s2p orbitals are reversed by p‚Äìs 
mixing, and the s2s and the s2s* orbitals are no longer equally spaced relative to the 
energy of the free 2s orbital.
 
When the six valence electrons for the B2 molecule are placed in the modified 
 energy-level diagram, each of the last two electrons goes into one of the degenerate p2p 
orbitals. This produces a paramagnetic molecule in agreement with experimental 
results. Thus when the model is extended to allow p‚Äìs mixing in molecular orbitals, it 
predicts the  correct magnetism. Note that the bond order is (4 2 2)y2 5 1, as before.
 
The remaining diatomic molecules of the elements in Period 2 can be described 
using similar ideas. For example, the C2 and N2 molecules use the same set of orbitals 
as for B2 (see Fig. 9.37). Because the importance of 2s‚Äì2p mixing decreases across the

period, the s2p and p2p orbitals revert to the order expected in the absence of 2s‚Äì2p 
mixing for the molecules O2 and F2 (Fig. 9.38).
CRITICAL THINKING What if p2p orbitals were lower in energy 
than s2p orbitals? What would you expect the B2 molecular orbital energy-level 
diagram to look like (without considering p‚Äìs mixing)? Compare your expected 
diagram to Figs. 9.34 and 9.35, and state the differences from each.
 
Several significant points arise from the orbital diagrams, bond strengths, and bond 
lengths summarized in Fig. 9.38 for the Period 2 diatomics:
1. There are definite correlations between bond order, bond energy, and bond 
length. As the bond order predicted by the molecular orbital model increases, the 
bond energy increases and the bond length decreases. This is a clear indication 
that the bond order predicted by the model accurately reflects bond strength, and 
it strongly supports the reasonableness of the MO model.
2. Comparison of the bond energies of the B2 and F2 molecules indicates that bond 
order cannot automatically be associated with a particular bond energy. Although 
both molecules have a bond order of 1, the bond in B2 appears to be about twice 
as strong as the bond in F2. As we will see in our later discussion of the halogens, 
F2 has an unusually weak single bond due to larger than usual electron‚Äìelectron 
repulsions (there are 14 valence electrons on the small F2 molecule).
3. Note the very large bond energy associated with the N2 molecule, which the 
molecular orbital model predicts will have a bond order of 3, a triple bond. The 
very strong bond in N2 is the principal reason that many nitrogen-containing 
compounds are used as high explosives. The reactions involving these explosives

give the very stable N2 molecule as a product, thus releasing large quantities of 
energy.
4. The O2 molecule is known to be paramagnetic. This can be very convincingly 
demonstrated by pouring liquid oxygen between the poles of a strong magnet 
(Fig. 9.39). The oxygen remains there until it evaporates. Significantly, the 
molecular orbital model correctly predicts oxygen‚Äôs paramagnetism, while the 
localized electron model predicts a diamagnetic molecule.
Photoelectron Spectroscopy (PES) 
for¬†Molecules
We introduced photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) in Section 7.12 when discussing ion-
ization energies of atoms. The PES spectrum of a molecule provides valuable informa-
tion about the energy levels in that molecule. For example, the PES spectrum of N2 
shows how the technique works. The actual PES spectrum itself is complex because of 
the coupling of the ionization energies of the electrons with the energies resulting from 
vibrations of the two nitrogen atoms. However, the results show three main areas of 
energy absorption at 15.6, 16.7, and 18.6 eV. We can interpret these results by looking 
at the molecular orbital diagram or N2 (see Fig. 9.38). Note from this diagram that N2 
has five filled molecular orbitals: s2s, s2s*, two p2p, and s2p. We can represent the 
energies required to remove these electrons in the diagram represented in Fig. 9.40.
Note from Fig. 9.40 that the energies of the bound electrons are negative and that 
zero corresponds to electrons that are free of the influence of the two N nuclei‚Äîthey 
are free electrons. Also note that no transition is represented for the s2s electrons. 
These electrons have such low energy that they require more than the 21.2 eV that can 
be furnished by the helium source.
As we can see from this example, PES furnishes valuable information about the 
energies of electrons in molecules. As a result, it is a very useful tool for characterizing 
and testing our theories of bonding in molecules.

The O2 molecule has 12 valence electrons (6 1 6); O21 has 11 valence electrons  
(6 1 6 2 1); and O22 has 13 valence electrons (6 1 6 1 1). We will assume that the 
ions can be treated using the same molecular orbital diagram as for the neutral dia-
tomic  molecule:

ments. The Ne2 molecule has 16 valence electrons (8 from each atom). Placing

table. We will assume that the diatomic molecules of the Period 3 elements can 
be treated in a way very similar to that which we have used so far. Thus we will 
draw the MO diagram for P2 analogous to that for N2. The only change will be 
that the molecular orbitals will be formed from 3s and 3p atomic orbitals. The  
P2 model has 10 valence electrons (5 from each phosphorus atom). The resulting

9.4 Bonding in Heteronuclear 
Diatomic Molecules
In this section we will deal with selected examples of heteronuclear (different atoms) 
diatomic molecules. A special case involves molecules containing atoms adjacent to 
each other in the periodic table. Since the atoms involved in such a molecule are so 
similar, we can use the molecular orbital diagram for homonuclear molecules. For 
example, we can predict the bond order and magnetism of nitric oxide (NO) by placing 
its 11 valence electrons (5 from nitrogen and 6 from oxygen) in the molecular orbital 
energy-level diagram shown in Fig. 9.41. The molecule should be paramagnetic and 
has a bond order of
8 2 3

5 2.5
Experimentally, nitric oxide is indeed found to be paramagnetic. Notice that this odd- 
electron molecule is described very naturally by the MO model. In contrast, the local-
ized  electron model, in the simple form used in this text, cannot be used readily to treat 
such molecules.

The Molecular Orbital Model III
Use the molecular orbital model to predict the magnetism and bond order of the NO1
and CN2 ions.
 
SOLUTION 
The NO1 ion has 10 valence electrons (5 1 6 2 1). The CN2 ion also has 10 valence 
 electrons (4 1 5 1 1). Both ions are therefore diamagnetic and have a bond order 
derived from the equation

5 3
The molecular orbital diagram for these two ions is the same (Fig. 9.42).
See Exercises 9.55 and 9.56
When the two atoms of a diatomic molecule are very different, the energy-level 
diagram for homonuclear molecules can no longer be used. A new diagram must be 
devised for each molecule. We will illustrate this case by considering the hydrogen fluo-
ride (HF) molecule. The electron configurations of the hydrogen and fluorine atoms are 
1s1 and 1s22s22p5, respectively. To keep things as simple as possible, we will assume 
that fluorine uses only one of its 2p orbitals to bond to hydrogen. Thus the molecular 
orbitals for HF will be composed of fluorine 2p and hydrogen 1s orbitals. Figure 9.43 
gives the partial molecular orbital energy-level diagram for HF, focusing only on the 
orbitals involved in the bonding. We are assuming that fluorine‚Äôs other valence electrons 
remain localized on the fluorine. The 2p orbital of fluorine is shown at a lower energy 
than the 1s orbital of hydrogen on the diagram because fluorine binds its valence elec-
trons more tightly. Thus the 2p electron on a free fluorine atom is at lower energy than 
the 1s electron on a free hydrogen atom. The diagram predicts that the HF molecule 
should be stable because both electrons are lowered in energy relative to their energy in 
the free hydrogen and fluorine atoms, which is the driving force for bond formation.
 
Because the fluorine 2p orbital is lower in energy than the hydrogen 1s orbital, the 
electrons prefer to be closer to the fluorine atom. That is, the s molecular orbital con-
taining the bonding electron pair shows greater electron probability close to the fluo-
rine (Fig. 9.44). The electron pair is not shared equally. This causes the fluorine atom 
to have a slight excess of negative charge and leaves the hydrogen atom partially posi-
tive. This is exactly the bond polarity observed for HF. Thus the molecular orbital 
model accounts in a straightforward way for the different electronegativities of hydro-
gen and fluorine and the resulting unequal charge distribution.
9.5 Combining the Localized Electron 
and Molecular Orbital Models
One of the main difficulties with the localized electron model is its assumption that 
electrons are localized. This problem is most apparent with molecules for which sev-
eral valid Lewis structures can be drawn. It is clear that none of these structures taken 
alone adequately describes the electronic structure of the molecule. The concept of 
resonance was invented to solve this problem. However, even with resonance included, 
the localized  electron model does not describe molecules and ions such as O3 and 
NO32 in a very  satisfying way.
 
It would seem that the ideal bonding model would be one with the simplicity of the 
localized electron model but with the delocalization characteristic of the molecular 
orbital model. We can achieve this by combining the two models to describe molecules 
that  require resonance. Note that for species such as O3 and NO32 the double bond

changes  position in the resonance structures (Fig. 9.45). Since a double bond involves 
one s and one p bond, there is a s bond between all bound atoms in each resonance 
structure. It is really the p bond that has different locations in the various resonance 
structures.
Therefore, we conclude that the s bonds in a molecule can be described as being 
localized with no apparent problems. It is the p bonding that must be treated as being 
delocalized. Thus for molecules that require resonance, we will use the localized elec-
tron model to describe the s bonding and the molecular orbital model to describe the 
p bonding. This allows us to keep the bonding model as simple as possible and yet 
give a more physically accurate description of such molecules.
We will illustrate the general method by considering the bonding in benzene, an 
important industrial chemical that must be handled carefully because it is a known 
carcinogen. The benzene molecule (C6H6) consists of a planar hexagon of carbon 
atoms with one hydrogen atom bound to each carbon atom [Fig. 9.46(a)]. In the 
In molecules that require resonance, 
it is the p bonding that is most clearly 
delocalized.

ne of the best things about 
New Mexico is the food. 
Authentic New Mexican cuisine 
uses liberal amounts of green and 
red chilies‚Äîoften called chili pep-
pers. Chilies apparently originated 
in parts of South America and were 
spread north by birds. When Colum-
bus came to North America, which 
he originally thought was  India, he 
observed the natives using chilies 
for spicing foods. When he took 
chilies back to Europe, Columbus 
mistakenly called them peppers and 
the name stuck.
The spicy payload of chilies is 
delivered mainly by the chemical 
capsaicin, which has the following 
structure:
Capsaicin was isolated as a pure sub-
stance by L. T. Thresh in 1846. Since 
then substituted capsaicins have also 
been found in chilies. The spicy power 
of chilies derives mostly from capsaicin 
and dihydrocapsaicin.
The man best known for explaining 
the ‚Äúheat‚Äù of chilies is Wilbur Scoville, 
who defined the Scoville unit for mea-
suring chili power. He arbitrarily estab-
lished the hotness of pure capsaicin as 
16 million. On this scale a typical green 
or red chili has a rating of about 2500 
Scoville units. You may have had an 
encounter with habanero chilies that 
left you looking for a firehose to put 
out the blaze in your mouth‚Äîhabane-
ros have a Scoville rating of about 
500,000!
Capsaicin has found many uses 
outside of cooking. It is used in pepper 
sprays and repellant sprays for many 
garden pests, although birds are unaf-
fected by capsaicin. Capsaicin also 
stimulates the body‚Äôs circulation and 
causes pain receptors to release endor-
phins, similar to the effect produced by 
intense exercise. Instead of jogging you 
may want to sit on the couch eating 
chilies. Either way you are going to 
sweat.

molecule all six COC bonds are known to be equivalent. To explain this fact, the local-
ized electron model must invoke resonance [Fig. 9.46(b)].
 
A better description of the bonding in benzene results when we use a combination 
of the models, as described above. In this description it is assumed that the s bonds of 
carbon involve sp2 orbitals (Fig. 9.47). These s bonds are all centered in the plane of 
the molecule.
 
Since each carbon atom is sp2 hybridized, a p orbital perpendicular to the plane of 
the ring remains on each carbon atom. These six p orbitals can be used to form p 
mo lecular orbitals [Fig. 9.48(a)]. The electrons in the resulting p molecular orbitals 
are delocalized above and below the plane of the ring [Fig. 9.48(b)]. This gives six 
equivalent COC bonds, as required by the known structure of the benzene molecule. 
The benzene structure is often written as
to indicate the delocalized p bonding in the molecule.
 
Very similar treatments can be applied to other planar molecules for which reso-
nance is required by the localized electron model. For example, the NO32 ion can be 
described using the p molecular orbital system shown in Fig. 9.49. In this molecule 
each atom is assumed to be sp2 hybridized, which leaves one p orbital on each atom 
perpendicular to the plane of the ion. These p orbitals can combine to form the p 
molecular orbital system.

Molecular orbitals are classified in two ways: energy and shape
‚ùØ Energy
‚ùØ A bonding MO is lower in energy than the atomic orbitals from which it is constructed. 
Electrons in this type of MO are lower in energy in the molecule than in the separated 
atoms and thus favor molecule formation.
‚ùØ An antibonding MO is higher in energy than the atomic orbitals from which it is con-
structed. Electrons in this type of MO are higher in energy in the molecule than in the 
separated atoms and thus do not favor molecule formation.
‚ùØ Shape (symmetry)
‚ùØ Sigma (s) MOs have their electron probability centered on a line passing through the 
nuclei
‚ùØ Pi (p) MOs have their electron probability concentrated above and below the line con-
necting the nuclei
Bond order is an index of bond strength
Bond order 5 number of bonding electrons 2 number of antibonding electrons

Active Learning Questions
These questions are designed to be used by groups of students in 
class.
 1. What are molecular orbitals? How do they compare with 
atomic orbitals? Can you tell by the shape of the bonding and 
antibonding orbitals which is lower in energy? Explain.
 2. Explain the difference between the s and p MOs for homo-
nuclear diatomic molecules. How are bonding and antibond-
ing orbitals different? Why are there two p MOs and one 
s MO? Why are the p MOs degenerate?
 3. Compare Figs. 9.35 and 9.37. Why are they different? Because 
B2 is known to be paramagnetic, the p2p and s2p molecular 
orbitals must be switched from the first prediction. What is the 
rationale for this? Why might one expect the s2p to be lower in 
energy than the p2p? Why can‚Äôt we use diatomic oxygen to 
help us decide whether the s2p or p2p is lower in energy?
 4. Which of the following would you expect to be more favor-
able energetically? Explain.
a. an H2 molecule in which enough energy is added to excite 
one electron from the bonding to the antibonding MO
b. two separate H atoms

als, and draw a picture showing all the bonds between the 
atoms, labeling each bond as s or p.
 6. Which is the more correct statement: ‚ÄúThe methane molecule 
(CH4) is a tetrahedral molecule because it is sp3 hybridized‚Äù or 
‚ÄúThe methane molecule (CH4) is sp3 hybridized because it is 
a tetrahedral molecule‚Äù? What, if anything, is the difference 
 between these two statements?

When is each useful?
 8. What are the relationships among bond order, bond energy, 
and bond length? Which of these quantities can be measured?

ties are quite different. Although as a first approximation we 
often use the same MO diagram for both, suggest how the 
MOs in N2 and CO might be different.
 10. Do lone pairs about a central atom affect the hybridization of 
the central atom? If so, how?

your configurations, give two property differences between

 ONCl1g2 h NO1g2 1 Cl1g2¬†¬†¬†¬† DH 5 158 kJ/mol

 100. Use the MO model to explain the bonding in BeH2. When con-
structing the MO energy-level diagram, assume that the Be‚Äôs

energy required to break a chemical bond, so we have come to 
think of the addition of energy as breaking bonds. However, in 
some cases the addition of energy can cause the formation of 
bonds. For example, in a sample of helium gas subjected to a 
high-energy source, some He2 molecules exist momentarily and 
then dissociate. Use MO theory (and diagrams) to explain why 
He2 molecules can come to exist and why they dissociate.

carbon atom or the oxygen atom to form bonds to metals?
b. Assign formal charges to the atoms in CO. Which atom

c. In the MO model, bonding MOs place more electron den-
sity near the more electronegative atom. (See the HF mol-
ecule in Figs. 9.43 and 9.44.) Antibonding MOs place more 
electron density near the less electronegative atom in the 
diatomic molecule. Use the MO model to predict which

ou have only to think about water to appreciate how different the three states 
of matter are. Flying, swimming, and ice skating are all done in contact with 
water in its various forms. Clearly, the arrangements of the water molecules must be 
significantly different in its gas, liquid, and solid forms.
In Chapter 5 we saw that a gas can be pictured as a substance whose component 
particles are far apart, are in rapid random motion, and exert relatively small forces on 
each other. The kinetic molecular model was constructed to account for the ideal 
behavior that most gases approach at high temperatures and low pressures.
Solids are obviously very different from gases. A gas has low density and high 
 compressibility and completely fills its container. Solids have much greater densities, 
are compressible only to a very slight extent, and are rigid‚Äîa solid maintains its shape 
irrespective of its container. These properties indicate that the components of a solid 
are close together and exert large attractive forces on each other.
The properties of liquids lie somewhere between those of solids and gases but not 
midway between, as can be seen from some of the properties of the three states of 
water. For example, compare the enthalpy change for the melting of ice at 08C (the 
heat of fusion) with that for vaporizing liquid water at 1008C (the heat of 
vaporization):
 H2O1s2 h H2O1l2¬†¬†¬†¬†  DH¬∞fus 5 6.02 kJ/mol
 H2O1l2 h H2O1g2¬†¬†¬†¬† DH¬∞vap 5 40.7 kJ/mol
These values show a much greater change in structure in going from the liquid to 
the gaseous state than in going from the solid to the liquid state. This suggests that 
there are extensive attractive forces among the molecules in liquid water, similar to but 
not as strong as those in the solid state.
The relative similarity of the liquid and solid states also can be seen in the densities 
of the three states of water. As shown in Table 10.1, the densities for liquid and solid 
water are quite close.* Compressibilities also can be used to explore the relationship 
among water‚Äôs states. At 258C, the density of liquid water changes from 0.9971 g/cm3 
at a pressure of 1 atm to 1.046 g/cm3 at 1065 atm. Given the large change in pressure, 
this is a very small variation in the density. Ice also shows little variation in density 
with increased pressure. On the other hand, at 4008C, the density of gaseous water 
changes from 3.26 3 1024 g/cm3 at 1 atm pressure to 0.157 g/cm3 at 242 atm‚Äîa huge 
variation.
The conclusion is clear. The liquid and solid states show many similarities and are 
strikingly different from the gaseous state, as shown schematically in Fig. 10.1. We 
must bear this in mind as we develop models for the structures of solids and liquids.
We will proceed in our study of liquids and solids by first considering the properties 
and structures of liquids and solids. Then we will consider the changes in state that 
occur between solid and liquid, liquid and gas, and solid and gas.

*Although the densities of solid and liquid water are quite similar, as is typical for most substances, 
water is quite unusual in that the density of its solid state is slightly less than that of its liquid state. 
For most substances, the density of the solid state is slightly greater than that of the liquid state.

10.1 Intermolecular Forces
In Chapters 8 and 9 we saw that atoms can form stable units called molecules by shar-
ing electrons. This is called intramolecular (within the molecule) bonding. In this 
chapter we consider the properties of the condensed states of matter (liquids and 
solids) and the forces that cause the aggregation of the components of a substance to 
form a liquid or a solid. These forces may involve covalent or ionic bonding, or they 
may involve weaker interactions usually called intermolecular forces (because they 
occur between, rather than within, molecules).
It is important to recognize that when a substance such as water changes from solid 
to liquid to gas, the molecules remain intact. The changes in states are due to changes 
in the forces among the molecules rather than in those within the molecules. In ice, as 
we will see later in this chapter, the molecules are virtually locked in place, although 
they can vibrate about their positions. If energy is added, the motions of the molecules 
increase, and they eventually achieve the greater movement and disorder characteristic 
of liquid water. The ice has melted. As more energy is added, the gaseous state is even-
tually reached, with the individual molecules far apart and interacting relatively little. 
However, the gas still consists of water molecules. It would take much energy to over-
come the covalent bonds and decompose the water molecules into their component 
atoms. This can be seen by comparing the energy needed to vaporize 1 mole of liquid 
water (40.7 kJ) with that needed to break the OOH bonds in 1 mole of water mole-
cules (934 kJ).
Dipole‚ÄìDipole Forces
As we saw in Section 8.3, molecules with polar bonds often behave in an electric 
field as if they had a center of positive charge and a center of negative charge. That 
is, they exhibit a dipole moment. Molecules with dipole moments can attract each 
other electrostatically by lining up so that the positive and negative ends are close 
to each other [Fig. 10.2(a)]. This is called a dipole‚Äìdipole attraction. In a con-
densed state such as a liquid, where many molecules are in close proximity, the 
dipoles find the best compromise between attraction and repulsion. That is, the 
molecules orient themselves to maximize the ‚äï,‚äù interactions and to minimize 
‚äï,‚äï and ‚äù,‚äù interactions [Fig.¬†10.2(b)].
Dipole‚Äìdipole forces are typically only about 1% as strong as covalent or ionic 
bonds, and they rapidly become weaker as the distance between the dipoles increases. 
At low pressures in the gas phase, where the molecules are far apart, these forces are 
relatively unimportant.
Particularly strong dipole‚Äìdipole forces, however, are seen among molecules in 
which hydrogen is bound to a highly electronegative atom, such as nitrogen, oxygen, 
or fluorine. Two factors account for the strengths of these interactions: the great polar-
ity of the bond and the close approach of the dipoles, allowed by the very small size of 
the hydrogen atom. Because dipole‚Äìdipole attractions of this type are so unusually 
strong, they are given a special name‚Äîhydrogen bonding. Figure 10.3 shows hydro-
gen bonding among water molecules, which occurs between the partially positive 
H¬†atoms and the lone pairs on adjacent water molecules.
Hydrogen bonding has a very important effect on physical properties. For example, 
the boiling points for the covalent hydrides of the elements in Groups 4A, 5A, 6A, 
and¬†7A are given in Fig. 10.4. Note that the nonpolar tetrahedral hydrides of Group 4A 
show a steady increase in boiling point with molar mass (that is, in going down the 
group), whereas, for the other groups, the lightest member has an unexpectedly high 
boiling point. Why? The answer lies in the especially large hydrogen bonding interac-
tions that exist among the smallest molecules with the most polar XOH bonds. These 
unusually strong hydrogen bonding forces are due primarily to two factors. One factor

Intermolecular forces were introduced 
in Chapter 5 to explain nonideal gas 
behavior.
Remember that temperature is a measure 
of the random motions of the particles in a 
substance.
Dipole‚Äìdipole forces are forces that act 
between polar molecules.

is the relatively large electronegativity values of the lightest elements in each group, 
which leads to especially polar XOH bonds. The second factor is the small size of the 
first element of each group, which allows for the close approach of the dipoles, further 
strengthening the intermolecular forces. Because the interactions among the molecules 
containing the lightest elements in Groups 5A and 6A are so strong, an unusually large 
quantity of energy must be supplied to overcome these interactions and separate the 
molecules to produce the gaseous state. These molecules will remain together in the 
liquid state even at high temperatures‚Äîhence the very high boiling points.
 
Hydrogen bonding is also important in organic molecules (molecules with a carbon 
chain backbone). For example, the alcohols methanol (CH3OH) and ethanol 
(CH3CH2OH) have much higher boiling points than would be expected from their 
molar masses because of the polar OOH bonds in these molecules, which produce 
hydrogen bonding.
Boiling point will be defined precisely in 
Section 10.8.

London Dispersion Forces
Even molecules without dipole moments must exert forces on each other. We know 
this because all substances‚Äîeven the noble gases‚Äîexist in the liquid and solid states 
under certain conditions. The forces that exist among noble gas atoms and nonpolar 
molecules are called London dispersion forces. To understand the origin of these 
forces, let‚Äôs consider a pair of noble gas atoms. Although we usually assume that the 
electrons of an atom are  uniformly distributed about the nucleus, this is apparently not 
true at every instant. As the electrons move about the nucleus, a momentary nonsym-
metrical electron distribution can develop that produces a temporary dipolar arrange-
ment of charge. The formation of this temporary dipole can, in turn, affect the electron 
distribution of a neighboring atom. That is, this instantaneous dipole that occurs acci-
dentally in a given atom can then induce a similar dipole in a neighboring atom 
[Fig.¬†10.5(a)]. This phenomenon leads to an interatomic attraction that is relatively 
weak and short-lived but that can be very  significant especially for large atoms (see 
below). For these interactions to become strong enough to produce a solid, the motions 
of the atoms must be greatly slowed down. This  explains, for instance, why the noble 
gas elements have such low freezing points (Table 10.2).
 
Note from Table 10.2 that the freezing point rises going down the group. The prin-
cipal cause for this trend is that as the atomic number increases, the number of elec-
trons increases, and there is an increased chance of the occurrence of momentary 
dipole interactions. We describe this phenomenon using the term polarizability, which 
indicates the ease with which the electron ‚Äúcloud‚Äù of an atom can be distorted to give 
a dipolar charge distribution. Thus we say that large atoms with many electrons exhibit 
a higher polarizability than small atoms. This means that the importance of London 
dispersion forces increases greatly as the number of electrons in the atom increases.
 
These same ideas also apply to nonpolar molecules such as H2, CH4, CCl4, and CO2 
[Fig. 10.5(b)]. Since none of these molecules has a permanent dipole moment, their 
principal means of attracting each other is through London dispersion forces.

Although we usually think of dipole‚Äìdipole forces (DDF) as being very strong, some-
times London dispersion forces (LDF) can dominate for molecules with many elec-
trons. An example of this situation is shown in Table 10.3 for the substances BI3, PCl3, 
and NH3. Note that BI3 has the highest boiling point because of the very strong London 
dispersion forces that occur among these large molecules. Also note that PCl3, which 
has both London dispersion forces and dipole‚Äìdipole forces, has a higher boiling point 
than NH3, which has very strong dipole‚Äìdipole (hydrogen bonding) forces and very 
weak London dispersion forces.

Distinguishing Between Chemical and Physical 
Changes at the Molecular Level
In Chapter 1 we defined physical and chemical changes mostly from a macroscopic 
perspective. A physical change was noted as a change in the form of the substance, but 
not in its chemical composition. A chemical change was defined as a change of sub-
stances into other substances with different properties and different composition. We 
can now look at these changes at the molecular level. Determining whether a process 
comes about because of disruption of intramolecular forces (chemical bonds) or inter-
molecular forces allows us to distinguish between chemical and physical changes. 
A typical example of a physical change is a phase change, such as the boiling of 
water. In this process, energy as heat is transferred to liquid water and the intermolecu-
lar forces (hydrogen bonding in this case) are overcome, resulting in the formation of
water vapor. We represent the equation for this process as:
H2O1l2 S H2O1g2
Notice that the molecules do not change; that is, at the beginning and end of the physi-
cal change the chemical composition, H2O, is the same. However, the molecules are 
held together by hydrogen bonding in the liquid but not in the vapor. Molecular level 
pictures of this process are shown below:
Ice
Water
Steam
So the change of water from the liquid to the gaseous phase is a physical process, 
because the H2O molecules remain intact during the process. If a process results by 
breaking and/or forming chemical bonds (or intramolecular forces), the process is a 
chemical change. For example, consider the combustion of methane (CH4) to form
carbon dioxide and water. The balanced equation is
CH4 1 2O2 S CO2 1 2H2O
388

For this reaction to occur, the chemical bonds between carbon and hydrogen in 
methane and between the oxygen atoms in diatomic oxygen must be broken, and 
chemical bonds between the carbon and oxygen in carbon dioxide and hydrogen 
and oxygen in water must be formed. Molecular level pictures of this process are 
shown below:
+
+
The distinction between physical and chemical changes is not always as clear as in 
the previous examples. For example, consider dissolving table salt, NaCl(s), in water. 
We can make an argument that this is a physical change by considering the equation 
for the process:
NaCl1s2 S NaCl1aq2
This equation is similar to the equation for the boiling of water in that the formula 
for the reactant and product is the same while only the form changes. It would appear, 
then, that the process of an ionic solid dissolving is a physical change. However, this 
conclusion is not as obvious if we look at a molecular view of the process, shown in 
Fig.¬†10.6.
For NaCl to go into solution, the ionic bonds holding the Na2 and Cl2 together must 
be broken. In addition, interactions are formed between the ions and the water mole-
cules. The strength of these forces (especially the ionic bonds) can be similar to the 
strengths of covalent chemical bonds. From this perspective, we could argue that this 
process is a chemical change.
Thus, a molecular-level perspective can help us distinguish between chemical and 
physical changes by considering whether intramolecular or intermolecular forces are dis-
rupted. However, we need to be careful to not oversimplify the issue, because some pro-
cesses fall in a gray area between a purely chemical change and a purely physical change.

Forces Between Polar and Nonpolar 
Molecules
Earlier in this chapter we discussed intermolecular forces between polar molecules 
(dipole‚Äìdipole interactions) and intermolecular forces between nonpolar molecules 
(London dispersion forces; these forces exist between polar molecules as well but are 
not as strong as the dipole‚Äìdipole interactions). While we have discussed the attraction 
between polar molecules and the attraction between nonpolar molecules, polar mole-
cules and nonpolar molecules exhibit an attraction for one another as well. Recall that 
a nonpolar molecule can form an instantaneous dipole that can induce a similar dipole 
in a neighboring molecule. Similarly, a permanent dipole on a polar molecule can 
induce a dipole on a neighboring nonpolar molecule. This is termed a dipole-induced 
dipole interaction. The strength of this interaction depends on the natures of both the 
polar molecule and the nonpolar molecule. The larger the magnitude of the dipole in a 
polar molecule, the better able it is to induce a dipole in a neighboring molecule. Just 
as we discussed with London dispersion forces, nonpolar molecules with a greater 
number of electrons have an increased polarizability, therefore increasing the ease 
with which a dipole is induced.
CRITICAL THINKING You have learned the difference between 
intermolecular forces and intramolecular bonds. What if intermolecular forces 
were stronger than intramolecular bonds? What differences could you observe 
in the world?
10.2 The Liquid State
Liquids and liquid solutions are vital to our lives. Of course, water is the most impor-
tant liquid. Besides being essential to life, water provides a medium for food prepara-
tion, for transportation, for cooling in many types of machines and industrial processes, 
for recreation, for cleaning, and for a myriad of other uses.
Liquids exhibit many characteristics that help us understand their nature. We have 
already mentioned their low compressibility, lack of rigidity, and high density com-
pared with gases. Many of the properties of liquids give us direct information about the 
forces that exist among the particles. For example, when a liquid is poured onto a solid 
surface, it tends to bead as droplets, a phenomenon that depends on the intermolecular 
forces.  Although molecules in the interior of the liquid are completely surrounded by 
other molecules, those at the liquid surface are subject to attractions only from the side 
and from below (Fig. 10.7). The effect of this uneven pull on the surface molecules 
tends to draw them into the body of the liquid and causes a droplet of liquid to assume 
the shape that has the minimum surface area‚Äîa sphere.
To increase a liquid‚Äôs surface area, molecules must move from the interior of the 
liquid to the surface. This requires energy, since some intermolecular forces must be 
overcome. The resistance of a liquid to an increase in its surface area is called the 
surface tension of the liquid. As we would expect, liquids with relatively large inter-
molecular forces, such as those with polar molecules, tend to have relatively high 
surface tensions.
Polar liquids typically exhibit capillary action, the spontaneous rising of a liquid 
in a narrow tube. Two different types of forces are responsible for this property: cohe-
sive forces, the intermolecular forces among the molecules of the liquid, and adhesive 
forces, the forces between the liquid molecules and their container. We have already 
seen how cohesive forces operate among polar molecules. Adhesive forces occur when 
a container is made of a substance that has polar bonds. For example, a glass surface 
contains many oxygen atoms with partial negative charges that are attractive to the 
10.2
For a given volume, a sphere has a smaller 
surface area than any other shape.
Surface tension: the resistance of a liquid to 
an increase in its surface area.
The composition of glass is discussed in 
Section 10.5.

FIGURE 10.7 A molecule in the 
interior of a liquid is attracted by the 
molecules surrounding it, whereas a 
molecule at the surface of a liquid is

on each side. Remember that the mole-
cules in a liquid are in constant  motion.

positive end of a polar molecule such as water. This ability of water to ‚Äúwet‚Äù glass 
makes it creep up the walls of the tube where the water surface touches the glass. This, 
however, tends to increase the surface area of the water, which is opposed by the cohe-
sive forces that try to minimize the surface. Thus because water has both strong cohe-
sive (intermolecular) forces and strong adhesive forces to glass, it ‚Äúpulls itself‚Äù up a 
glass capillary tube (a tube with a small diameter) to a height where the weight of the 
column of water just balances the water‚Äôs tendency to be attracted to the glass surface. 
The concave shape of the meniscus (Fig. 10.8) shows that water‚Äôs adhesive forces 
toward the glass are stronger than its cohesive forces. A nonpolar liquid such as mer-
cury (see Fig. 10.8) shows a convex meniscus. This behavior is characteristic of a liq-
uid in which the cohesive forces are stronger than the adhesive forces toward glass.
 
Another property of liquids strongly dependent on intermolecular forces is viscos-
ity, a measure of a liquid‚Äôs resistance to flow. As might be expected, liquids with large 
intermolecular forces tend to be highly viscous. For example, glycerol, whose struc-
ture is

has an unusually high viscosity due mainly to its high capacity to form hydrogen 
bonds using its OOH groups (see margin).
 
Molecular complexity also leads to higher viscosity because very large molecules 
can become entangled with each other. For example, gasoline, a nonviscous liquid, 
contains hydrocarbon molecules of the type CH3O(CH2)nOCH3, where n varies from 
about 3 to 8. However, grease, which is very viscous, contains much larger hydrocar-
bon molecules in which n varies from 20 to 25.
Structural Model for Liquids
In many respects, the development of a structural model for liquids presents greater 
challenges than the development of such a model for the other two states of matter. In 
the gaseous state, the particles are so far apart and are moving so rapidly that intermo-
lecular forces are negligible under most circumstances. This means that we can use a 
relatively simple model for gases. In the solid state, although the intermolecular forces 
are large, the molecular motions are minimal, and fairly simple models are again pos-
sible. The liquid state, however, has both strong intermolecular forces and significant 
molecular  motions. Such a situation precludes the use of really simple models for 
Viscosity: a measure of a liquid‚Äôs resistance 
to flow.

liquids. Recent advances in spectroscopy, the study of the manner in which substances 
interact with electromagnetic radiation, make it possible to follow the very rapid 
changes that occur in  liquids. As a result, our models of liquids are becoming more 
accurate. As a starting point, a typical liquid might best be viewed as containing a large 
number of regions where the arrangements of the components are similar to those 
found in the solid, but with more disorder, and a smaller number of regions where 
holes are present. The situation is highly dynamic, with rapid fluctuations occurring in 
both types of regions.
M
atter seems to be getting smarter 
these days. Increasingly, we have 
discovered materials that can remem-
ber their initial shape after being 
deformed or can sense and respond to 
their environment. In particular, valu-
able new materials have been formu-
lated whose properties can be changed 
instantly by applying a magnetic or 
electric field.
One example of such a substance  
is a fluid whose flow characteristics 
(rheology) can be changed from free 
flowing to almost solid in about 
0.01¬†second by the application of an 
electromagnetic field. This ‚Äúmagneto-
rheological‚Äù (MR) fluid was developed 
by Lord Corporation. Working in 
 collaboration with Delphi Corporation, 
the company is  applying the fluid in 
suspension control of General Motors 
automobiles such as Cadillacs and 
Corvettes. The so-called Magneride 
system has sensors that monitor the 
road surface and provide information 
about what suspension damping is 
needed. In response, a message is 
instantly sent to an electromagnetic  
coil in the shock absorbers, which 
adjusts the viscosity of the MR fluid to 
provide continuously variable damping. 
The result: an amazingly smooth ride 
and unerring road-holding ability.
The MR fluid is composed of a syn-
thetic oil in which particles of an iron-
containing compound are suspended. 
When the magnetic field is turned off, 
these particles flow freely in all direc-
tions (see the figure above). When the 
field is turned on, the particles aggre-
gate into chains that line up perpen-
dicular to the flow of the fluid, thereby 
increasing its viscosity in proportion to 
the strength of the applied field.
Many other applications of MR fluids 
besides auto  suspensions are under 
development. One very large-scale 
application is in Japan‚Äôs National 
Museum of Emerging Science and Inno-
vation, where an MR fluid is being used 
in dampers to protect the building 
against earthquake damage. Large 
MR-fluid dampers are also being used for 
stabilizing bridges such as the Dong Ting 
Lake Bridge in China‚Äôs Hunan province to 
steady it in high winds.

10.3 An Introduction to Structures 
and Types of Solids
There are many ways to classify solids, but the broadest categories are crystalline 
solids, those with a highly regular arrangement of their components, and amorphous 
solids, those with considerable disorder in their structures.
The regular arrangement of the components of a crystalline solid at the microscopic 
level produces the beautiful, characteristic shapes of crystals, such as those shown in 
Fig. 10.9. The positions of the components in a crystalline solid are usually repre-
sented by a lattice, a three-dimensional system of points designating the positions of 
the components (atoms, ions, or molecules) that make up the substance. The smallest 
repeating unit of the lattice is called the unit cell. Thus a particular lattice can be gen-
erated by  repeating the unit cell in all three dimensions to form the extended structure. 
Three common unit cells and their lattices are shown in Fig. 10.10. Note from 
Fig.¬†10.10 that the  extended structure in each case can be viewed as a series of repeat-
ing unit cells that share common faces in the interior of the solid.
Although we will concentrate on crystalline solids in this book, there are many 
important noncrystalline (amorphous) materials. An example is common glass, which 
is best pictured as a solution in which the components are ‚Äúfrozen in place‚Äù before they 
can achieve an ordered arrangement. Although glass is a solid (it has a rigid shape), a 
great deal of disorder exists in its structure.
X-Ray Analysis of Solids
The structures of crystalline solids are most commonly determined by X-ray diffraction. 
Diffraction occurs when beams of light are scattered from a regular array of points in 
which the spacings between the components are comparable with the wavelength of 
the light. Diffraction is due to constructive interference when the waves of parallel 
beams are in phase and to destructive interference when the waves are out of phase.
When X rays of a single wavelength are directed at a crystal, a diffraction pattern 
is obtained, as we saw in Fig. 7.6. The light and dark areas on the photographic plate 
occur because the waves scattered from various atoms may reinforce or cancel each 
other (Fig. 10.11). The key to whether the waves reinforce or cancel is the difference 
in distance traveled by the waves after they strike the atoms. The waves are in phase 
before they are reflected, so if the difference in distance traveled is an integral number 
of wavelengths, the waves will still be in phase.
Since the distance traveled depends on the distance between the atoms, the diffrac-
tion pattern can be used to determine the interatomic spacings. The exact relationship 
can be worked out using the diagram in Fig. 10.12, which shows two in-phase waves 
being reflected by atoms in two different layers in a crystal. The extra distance traveled

Equation (10.3) is called the Bragg equation after William Henry Bragg (1862‚Äì1942) 
and his son William Lawrence Bragg (1890‚Äì1972), who shared the Nobel Prize in 
physics in 1915 for their pioneering work in X-ray crystallography.
 
A diffractometer is a computer-controlled instrument used for carrying out the  
X-ray analysis of crystals. It rotates the crystal with respect to the X-ray beam and 
collects the data produced by the scattering of the X rays from the various planes of 
atoms in the crystal. The results are then analyzed by computer.
 
The techniques for crystal structure analysis have reached a level of sophistication 
that allows the determination of very complex structures, such as those important in 
biological systems. For example, the structures of several enzymes have been deter-
mined, thus enabling biochemists to understand how they perform their functions. We 
will explore this topic further in Chapter 12. Using X-ray diffraction, we can gather 
data on bond lengths and angles and in so doing can test the predictions of our models 
of molecular geometry.

Types of Crystalline Solids
There are many different types of crystalline solids. For example, although both sugar 
and salt dissolve readily in water, the properties of the resulting solutions are quite 
different. The salt solution readily conducts an electric current, whereas the sugar solu-
tion does not. This behavior arises from the nature of the components in these two 
solids. Common salt (NaCl) is an ionic solid; it contains Na1 and Cl2 ions. When solid 
sodium chloride dissolves in the polar water, sodium and chloride ions are distributed 
throughout the resulting solution and are free to conduct electric current. Table sugar 
(sucrose), on the other hand, is composed of neutral molecules that are dispersed 
throughout the water when the solid dissolves. No ions are present, and the resulting 
solution does not conduct electricity. These examples illustrate two important types  
of solids: ionic solids, represented by sodium chloride, and molecular solids, repre-
sented by sucrose. Ionic solids have ions at the points of the lattice that describes  
the structure of the solid. A molecular solid, on the other hand, has discrete covalently 
bonded molecules at each of its lattice points. Ice is a molecular solid that has an 
H2O¬†molecule at each point (Fig. 10.13).
 
A third type of solid is represented by elements such as carbon (which exists in the 
forms graphite, diamond, and the fullerenes), boron, silicon, and all metals. These 
substances all have atoms at the lattice points that describe the structure of the solid. 
Therefore, we call solids of this type atomic solids. Examples of these three types of 
solids are shown in Fig. 10.13.
 
To summarize, we find it convenient to classify solids according to what type of 
component occupies the lattice points. This leads to the classifications atomic solids 
(atoms at the lattice points), molecular solids (discrete, relatively small molecules at 
the lattice points), and ionic solids (ions at the lattice points). In addition, atomic solids 
are placed into the following subgroups based on the bonding that exists among the 
atoms in the solid: metallic solids, network solids, and Group 8A solids. In metallic 
solids, a special type of delocalized nondirectional covalent bonding occurs. In net-
work solids, the atoms bond to each other with strong directional covalent bonds that 
lead to giant molecules, or networks, of atoms. In the Group 8A solids, the noble gas 
elements are  attracted to each other with London dispersion forces. The classification 
of solids is summarized in Table 10.4.
 
The markedly different bonding present in the various atomic solids leads to dra-
matically different properties for the resulting solids. For example, although argon, 
Buckminsterfullerene, C60, is a particular 
member of the fullerene family.
The internal forces in a solid determine the 
properties of the solid.

copper, and diamond all are atomic solids, they have strikingly different properties. 
Argon (a Group 8A solid) has a very low melting point (21898C), whereas diamond 
(a network solid) and copper (a metallic solid) melt at high temperatures (about 3500 
and 10838C, respectively). Copper is an excellent conductor of electricity, whereas 
argon and diamond are both  insulators. Copper can be easily changed in shape; it is 
both malleable (can be formed into thin sheets) and ductile (can be pulled into a wire). 
Diamond, on the other hand, is the hardest natural substance known. We will explore 
the structure and bonding of atomic solids in the next two sections.
10.4 Structure and Bonding in Metals
Metals are characterized by high thermal and electrical conductivity, malleability, and 
ductility. As we will see, these properties can be traced to the nondirectional covalent 
bonding found in metallic crystals.
A metallic crystal can be pictured as containing spherical atoms packed together 
and bonded to each other equally in all directions. We can model such a structure by 
packing uniform, hard spheres in a manner that most efficiently uses the available 
space. Such an arrangement is called closest packing. The spheres are packed in 
layers (Fig.¬†10.14), in which each sphere is surrounded by six others. In the second 
layer, the spheres do not lie directly over those in the first layer. Instead, each one 
occupies an indentation (or dimple) formed by three spheres in the first layer. In the

crystals assumes that metal atoms are

third layer, the spheres can occupy the dimples of the second layer in two possible 
ways: They can occupy positions so that each sphere in the third layer lies directly 
over a sphere in the first layer [the aba arrangement; Fig. 10.14(a)], or they can 
occupy positions so that no sphere in the third layer lies over one in the first layer 
[the abc arrangement; Fig. 10.14(b)].
 
The aba arrangement has the hexagonal unit cell shown in Fig. 10.15, and the 
 resulting structure is called the hexagonal closest packed (hcp) structure. The abc 
 arrangement has a face-centered cubic unit cell (Fig. 10.16), and the  resulting  structure 
is called the cubic closest packed (ccp) structure. Note that in the hcp structure the 
spheres in every other layer occupy the same vertical position (ababab . . .), whereas 
in the ccp structure the spheres in every fourth layer occupy the same vertical position 
(abcabca . . .). A characteristic of both structures is that each sphere has 12  equivalent 
nearest neighbors: 6 in the same layer, 3 in the layer above, and 3 in the layer  below 
(that form the dimples). This is illustrated for the hcp structure in Fig. 10.17.
 
Knowing the net number of spheres (atoms) in a particular unit cell is important for 
many applications involving solids. To illustrate how to find the net number of spheres in 
a unit cell, we will consider a face-centered cubic unit cell (Fig. 10.18). Note that this unit

are 8 3 1

Calculating the Density of a Closest Packed Solid
Silver crystallizes in a cubic closest packed structure. The radius of a silver atom is 
144¬†pm. Calculate the density of solid silver.
 
SOLUTION 
Density is mass per unit volume. Thus we need to know how many silver atoms occupy a 
given volume in the crystal. The structure is cubic closest packed, which means the 
unit cell is face-centered cubic, as shown in the accompanying figure.

We must find the volume of this unit cell for silver and the net number of atoms it 
contains. Note that in this structure the atoms touch along the diagonals for each face 
and not along the edges of the cube. Thus the length of the diagonal is r¬†1¬†2r¬†1¬†r, 
or¬†4r. We use this fact to find the length of the edge of the cube by the Pythagorean 
theorem:
 d 2 1 d 2 5 14r2 2
 2d 2 5 16r 2
 d 2 5 8r 2
 d 5 "8r 2 5 r"8
Since r 5 144 pm for a silver atom,
d 5 1144 pm2 1"82 5 407 pm
The volume of the unit cell is d3, which is (407 pm)3, or 6.74 3 107 pm3. We convert 
this to cubic centimeters as follows:

Examples of metals that form cubic closest packed solids are aluminum, iron, cop-
per, cobalt, and nickel. Magnesium and zinc are hexagonal closest packed. Calcium 
and certain other metals can crystallize in either of these structures. Some metals, 
however, assume structures that are not closest packed. For example, the alkali metals 
have structures characterized by a body-centered cubic (bcc) unit cell (see Fig. 10.10), 
where the spheres touch along the body diagonal of the cube. In this structure, each 
sphere has 8 nearest neighbors (count the number of atoms around the atom at the 
center of the unit cell), as compared with 12 in the closest packed structures. Why a 
particular metal adopts the structure it does is not well understood.
Bonding Models for Metals
Any successful bonding model for metals must account for the typical physical prop-
erties of metals: malleability, ductility, and the efficient and uniform conduction of 
heat and electricity in all directions. Although the shapes of most pure metals can be 
changed  relatively easily, most metals are durable and have high melting points. These 
facts indicate that the bonding in most metals is both strong and nondirectional. That 
is, although it is difficult to separate metal atoms, it is relatively easy to move them, 
provided the atoms stay in contact with each other.
 
The simplest picture that explains these observations is the electron sea model, 
which envisions a regular array of metal cations in a ‚Äúsea‚Äù of valence electrons 
(Fig.¬†10.19). The mobile electrons can conduct heat and electricity, and the metal ions 
can be easily moved around as the metal is hammered into a sheet or pulled into a wire.
Malleable: can be pounded into thin 
sheets.
Ductile: can be drawn to form a wire.

A related model that gives a more detailed view of the electron energies and motions 
is the band model, or molecular orbital (MO) model, for metals. In this model, the 
electrons are assumed to travel around the metal crystal in molecular orbitals formed 
from the valence atomic orbitals of the metal atoms (Fig. 10.20).
 
Recall that in the MO model for the gaseous Li2 molecule (Section 9.3), two widely 
spaced molecular orbital energy levels (bonding and antibonding) result when two 
identical atomic orbitals interact. However, when many metal atoms interact, as in a 
metal crystal, the large number of resulting molecular orbitals become more closely 
spaced and finally form a virtual continuum of levels, called bands (see Fig. 10.20).
 
As an illustration, picture a magnesium metal crystal, which has an hcp structure. 
Since each magnesium atom has one 3s and three 3p valence atomic orbitals, a crystal 
with n magnesium atoms has available n(3s) and 3n(3p) orbitals to form the molecular 
orbitals (Fig. 10.21). Note that the core electrons are localized, as shown by their pres-
ence in the energy ‚Äúwell‚Äù around each magnesium atom. However, the valence elec-
trons occupy closely spaced molecular orbitals, which are only partially filled.
 
The existence of empty molecular orbitals close in energy to filled molecular orbit-
als explains the thermal and electrical conductivity of metal crystals. Metals conduct 
electricity and heat very efficiently because of the availability of highly mobile elec-
trons. For example, when an electric potential is placed across a strip of metal, for 
current to flow, electrons must be free to move. In the band model for metals, the 
electrons in partially filled bonds are mobile. These conduction electrons are free to 
travel throughout the metal crystal as dictated by the potential imposed on the metal. 
The molecular orbitals occupied by these conducting electrons are called conduction 
bands. These mobile electrons also account for the efficiency of the conduction of heat 
through metals. When one end of a metal rod is heated, the mobile electrons can rap-
idly transmit the thermal energy to the other end.
Metal Alloys
Because of the nature of the structure and bonding of metals, other elements can be 
introduced into a metallic crystal relatively easily to produce substances called alloys. 
An alloy is best defined as a substance that contains a mixture of elements and has 
metallic properties. Alloys can be conveniently classified into two types.
 
In a substitutional alloy some of the host metal atoms are replaced by other metal 
atoms of similar size. For example, in brass, approximately one-third of the atoms in 
the host  copper metal have been replaced by zinc atoms [Fig. 10.22(a)]. Sterling silver 
(93% silver and 7% copper), pewter (85% tin, 7% copper, 6% bismuth, and 2% anti-
mony), and plumber‚Äôs solder (95% tin and 5% antimony) are other examples of substi-
tutional alloys.

A
lthough we usually think of scien-
tists as dealing with esoteric and 
often toxic materials, sometimes they 
surprise us. For example, scientists  
at several prestigious universities 
have lately shown a lot of  interest  
in M & M candies.
To appreciate the scientists‚Äô inter-
est in M & Ms, we must consider the 
importance of packing atoms, mol-
ecules, or microcrystals in under-
standing the structures of solids. The 
most efficient use of space is the 
closest packing of uniform spheres, 
where 74% of the space is occupied by 
the spheres and 26% of space is left 
unoccupied. Although the structures 
of most pure metals can be explained 
in terms of closest packing, most 
other substances‚Äîsuch as many 
alloys and ceramics‚Äîconsist of ran-
dom arrays of microscopic  particles. 
For this reason, it is of interest to 
study how such objects pack in a 
random way.
When uniform spheres, such as 
marbles, are poured into a large con-
tainer, the resulting random packing of 
the spheres results in only 64% of the 
space being occupied by the spheres. 
Thus it was very surprising when 
Prince ton University chemist Salvatore 
Torquato and his colleagues at Cornell 
and North Carolina Central Universities 
discovered that, when the ellipsoidal-
shaped M & Ms are poured into a large 
container, the candies occupy 73.5% of 
the available space. In other words, the 
randomly packed M & Ms occupy space 
with almost the same efficiency as 
closest packed spheres do.
Why do randomly packed ellipsoids 
occupy space so much more efficiently 
than randomly packed spheres? The 
scientists speculate that because the 
ellipsoids can tip and rotate in ways 
that spheres cannot, they can pack 
more closely to their neighbors.
According to Torquato, these results 
are important because they will help us 
better understand the properties of 
disordered materials ranging from 
powders to glassy solids. He also says 
that M & Ms make ideal test objects 
because they are inexpensive and 
uniform and ‚Äúyou can eat the 
 experiment afterward.‚Äù

An interstitial alloy is formed when some of the interstices (holes) in the closest 
packed metal structure are occupied by small atoms [Fig. 10.22(b)]. Steel, the best- 
known interstitial alloy, contains carbon atoms in the holes of an iron crystal. The pres-
ence of the interstitial atoms changes the properties of the host metal. Pure iron is rela-
tively soft, ductile, and malleable due to the absence of directional bonding. The 
spherical metal atoms can be rather easily moved with respect to each other. However, 
when carbon, which forms strong directional bonds, is introduced into an iron crystal, 
the presence of the directional carbon‚Äìiron bonds makes the resulting alloy harder, 
stronger, and less ductile than pure iron. The amount of carbon directly affects the 
properties of steel. Mild steels, containing less than 0.2% carbon, are ductile and mal-
leable and are used for nails, cables, and chains. Medium steels, containing 0.2 to 
0.6% carbon, are harder than mild steels and are used in rails and structural steel 
beams. High-carbon steels, containing 0.6 to 1.5% carbon, are tough and hard and are 
used for springs, tools, and cutlery.
Many types of steel also contain elements in addition to iron and carbon. Such 
steels are often called alloy steels, and they can be viewed as being mixed interstitial 
(carbon) and substitutional (other metals) alloys. Bicycle frames, for example, are 
constructed from a wide variety of alloy steels. The compositions of the two brands of 
steel tubing most commonly used in expensive racing bicycles are given in Table 10.5.
10.5 Carbon and Silicon: 
Network Atomic Solids
Many atomic solids contain strong directional covalent bonds to form a solid that 
might best be viewed as a ‚Äúgiant molecule.‚Äù We call these substances network solids. 
In contrast to metals, these materials are typically brittle and do not efficiently conduct 
heat or electricity. To illustrate network solids, in this section we will discuss two very 
important elements, carbon and silicon, and some of their compounds.
The two most common forms of carbon, diamond and graphite, are typical network 
solids. In diamond, the hardest naturally occurring substance, each carbon atom is sur-
rounded by a tetrahedral arrangement of other carbon atoms to form a huge molecule 
[Fig. 10.23(a)]. This structure is stabilized by covalent bonds, which, in terms of the

localized electron model, are formed by the overlap of sp3 hybridized carbon ato mic 
orbitals.
 
It is also useful to consider the bonding among the carbon atoms in diamond in 
terms of the molecular orbital model. Energy-level diagrams for diamond and a typical 
metal are given in Fig. 10.24. Recall that the conductivity of metals can be explained 
by postulating that electrons are excited from filled levels into the very near empty 
levels, or conduction bands. However, note that in the energy-level diagram for dia-
mond there is a large gap between the filled and the empty levels. This means that 
electrons cannot be transferred easily to the empty conduction bands. As a result, dia-
mond is not expected to be a good electrical conductor. In fact, this prediction of the 
model agrees exactly with the observed behavior of diamond, which is known to be an 
electrical insulator‚Äîit does not conduct an electric current.
 
Graphite is very different from diamond. While diamond is hard, basically color-
less, and an insulator, graphite is slippery, black, and a conductor. These differences, 
of course, arise from the differences in bonding in the two types of solids. In contrast 
to the tetrahedral arrangement of carbon atoms in diamond, the structure of graphite is 
based on layers of carbon atoms arranged in fused six-membered rings [Fig. 10.23(b)]. 
Each carbon atom in a particular layer of graphite is surrounded by the three other 
carbon atoms in a trigonal planar arrangement with 120-degree bond angles. The 
localized electron model predicts sp2 hybridization in this case. The three sp2 orbitals 
on each carbon are used to form s bonds with three other carbon atoms. One 2p orbital 
remains unhybridized on each carbon and is perpendicular to the plane of carbon 
atoms, as shown in Fig. 10.25. These orbitals combine to form a group of closely 
spaced p mo lecular orbitals that are important in two ways. First, they contribute

raphite is a fascinating substance 
consisting of ‚Äúchicken-wire‚Äù layers 
of carbon atoms. Due to the strong 
carbon‚Äìcarbon bonds in each of its 
layers, graphite is even more thermody-
namically stable than diamond. 
Because of the unusual stability of 
graphite, scientists have long wondered 
whether graphene (the individual 
chicken-wire layers) could exist inde-
pendently. This question was answered 
by Andre Gein and Konstantin 
Novoselov,  two scientists working at 
the University of Manchester in the 
United Kingdom, when they were able 
to pull layers a single atom thick from 
graphite using Scotch tape. This work 
was deemed so important that Gein 
and Novoselov were awarded the Nobel 
Prize in physics in 2010.
Since the isolation of sheets of 
graphene by Gein and Novoselov, 
research in the properties and possible 
uses of this material has virtually 
exploded. Graphene has truly amazing 
properties. For example, it is believed 
to be the strongest material known, 
more than 100 times stronger than 
steel. Also, it is stiffer than diamond, yet 
it can be stretched like rubber.
Much of the interest in graphene 
centers on the fact that it is the best 
conductor of heat and electricity 
known. Electrons travel through gra-
phene at ultrafast speeds. In fact, elec-
trons in graphene exhibit the fractional 
quantum Hall effect: The electrons act 
collectively as if they are particles with 
only a fraction of the charge of an 
electron. Because of its exceptional 
thermal and electrical conductivities, 
graphene appears to be an ideal candi-
date for future electronic devices. Scien-
tists at IBM have already built 
graphene-based transistors that can 
switch on and off 26 billion times per 
second, far faster than conventional 
silicon-based devices.
One problem that has hampered the 
development of graphene-based devices 
is the difficulty in producing large sheets 
of graphene. Byung Hee Hong and his 
team, from South Korea, have recently 
reported making rectangular sheets of 
graphene measuring 30 inches along 
the diagonal. It appears that we are very 
close to making commercial electronic 
devices based on the amazing proper-
ties of graphene.

significantly to the stability of the graphite layers because of the p bond formation. 
Second, the p molecular orbitals with their delocalized electrons account for the elec-
trical conductivity of graphite. These closely spaced orbitals are exactly analogous to 
the conduction bands found in metal crystals.
Graphite is often used as a lubricant in locks (where oil is undesirable because it 
collects dirt). The slipperiness that is characteristic of graphite can be explained by 
noting that graphite has very strong bonding within the layers of carbon atoms but 
little bonding between the layers (the valence electrons are all used to form s and p
bonds among carbons within the layers). This arrangement allows the layers to slide 
past one another quite readily. Graphite‚Äôs layered structure is shown in Fig.¬†10.26. 
This is in contrast to diamond, which has uniform bonding in all directions in the 
crystal.
Because of their extreme hardness, diamonds are used extensively in industrial cut-
ting implements. Thus it is desirable to convert cheaper graphite to diamond. As we 
might expect from the higher density of diamond (3.5 g/cm3) compared with that of 
graphite (2.2 g/cm3), this transformation can be accomplished by applying very high 
pressures to graphite. The application of 150,000 atm of pressure at 28008C converts 
graphite virtually completely to diamond. The high temperature is required to break 
the strong bonds in graphite so the rearrangement can occur.

Silicon is an important constituent of the compounds that make up the earth‚Äôs crust. In 
fact, silicon is to geology as carbon is to biology. Just as carbon compounds are the basis 
for most biologically significant systems, silicon compounds are fundamental to most of 
the rocks, sands, and soils found in the earth‚Äôs crust. However, although carbon and silicon 
are next to each other in Group 4A of the periodic table, the carbon-based compounds of 
biology and the silicon-based compounds of geology have markedly  different structures. 
Carbon compounds typically contain long strings of  carbon‚Äìcarbon bonds, whereas the 
most stable silicon compounds involve chains with silicon‚Äìoxygen bonds.
 
The fundamental silicon‚Äìoxygen compound is silica, which has the empirical formula 
SiO2. Knowing the properties of the similar compound carbon dioxide, one might expect 
silica to be a gas that contains discrete SiO2 molecules. In fact, nothing could be further 
from the truth‚Äîquartz and some types of sand are typical of the materials composed of 
silica. What accounts for this difference? The answer lies in the bonding.
 
Recall that the Lewis structure of CO2 is
O
C
O
and that each CPO bond can be viewed as a combination of a s bond involving a 
 carbon sp hybrid orbital and a p bond involving a carbon 2p orbital. On the contrary, 
silicon cannot use its valence 3p orbitals to form strong p bonds with oxygen, mainly 
 because of the larger size of the silicon atom and its orbitals, which results in less 
 effective overlap with the smaller oxygen orbitals. Therefore, instead of forming  
p bonds, the silicon atom satisfies the octet rule by forming single bonds with four 
oxygen atoms, as shown in the representation of the structure of quartz in Fig. 10.27. 
Note that each silicon atom is at the center of a tetrahedral arrangement of oxygen 
atoms, which are shared with other silicon atoms. Although the empirical formula for 
quartz is SiO2, the structure is based on a network of SiO4 tetrahedra with shared oxy-
gen atoms rather than discrete SiO2 molecules. It is obvious that the differing abilities 
of carbon and silicon to form p bonds with oxygen have profound effects on the struc-
tures and properties of CO2 and SiO2.
 
Compounds closely related to silica and found in most rocks, soils, and clays are 
the silicates. Like silica, the silicates are based on interconnected SiO4 tetrahedra. 
However, in contrast to silica, where the O/Si ratio is 2;1, silicates have O/Si ratios 
greater than 2;1 and contain silicon‚Äìoxygen anions. This means that to form the neu-
tral solid silicates, cations are needed to balance the excess negative charge. In other 
words, silicates are salts containing metal cations and polyatomic silicon‚Äìoxygen 
anions. Examples of important silicate anions are shown in Fig. 10.28.
 
When silica is heated above its melting point (about 16008C) and cooled rapidly, an 
amorphous solid called a glass results (Fig. 10.29). Note that a glass contains a good 
deal of disorder, in contrast to the crystalline nature of quartz. Glass more closely 
resembles a very viscous solution than it does a crystalline solid. Common glass results 
The bonding in the CO2 molecule was 
described in Section 9.1.

when substances such as Na2CO3 are added to the silica melt, which is then cooled. The 
properties of glass can be varied greatly by varying the additives. For example, addition 
of B2O3 produces a glass (called borosilicate glass) that expands and contracts little 
under large temperature changes. Thus it is useful for labware and cooking utensils. The 
most common brand name for this glass is Pyrex. The addition of K2O produces an 
especially hard glass that can be ground to the precise shapes needed for eyeglass and 
contact lenses. The compositions of several types of glass are shown in Table 10.6.

Ceramics
Ceramics are typically made from clays (which contain silicates) and hardened by 
firing at high temperatures. Ceramics are nonmetallic materials that are strong, brittle, 
and resistant to heat and attack by chemicals.
 
Like glass, ceramics are based on silicates, but with that the resemblance ends. Glass 
can be melted and remelted as often as desired, but once a ceramic has been hardened, 
it is resistant to extremely high temperatures. This behavior results from the very differ-
ent structures of glasses and ceramics. A glass is a homogeneous, noncrystalline ‚Äúfrozen 
solution,‚Äù and a ceramic is heterogeneous. A ceramic contains two phases: minute crys-
tals of silicates that are suspended in a glassy cement.
 
To understand how ceramics harden, it is necessary to know something about the 
structure of clays. Clays are formed by the weathering action of water and carbon diox-
ide on the mineral feldspar, which is a mixture of silicates with empirical formulas such 
as K2O ? Al2O3 ? 6SiO2 and Na2O ? Al2O3 ? 6SiO2. Feldspar is really an aluminosilicate 
in which aluminum as well as silicon atoms are part of the oxygen-bridged polyanion. 
The weathering of feldspar produces kaolinite, consisting of tiny thin platelets with the 
empirical formula Al2Si2O5(OH)4. When dry, the platelets cling together; when water is 
present, they can slide over one another, giving clay its plasticity. As clay dries, the 
platelets begin to interlock again. When the remaining water is driven off during firing, 
the silicates and cations form a glass that binds the tiny crystals of kaolinite.
 
Ceramics have a very long history. Rocks, which are natural ceramic materials, 
served as the earliest tools. Later, clay vessels dried in the sun or baked in fires served 
as containers for food and water. These early vessels were no doubt crude and quite 
porous. With the discovery of glazing, which probably occurred about 3000 b.c. in 
Egypt, pottery became more serviceable as well as more beautiful. Prized porcelain is 
essentially the same material as crude earthenware, but specially selected clays and 
glazings are used for porcelain and the clay object is fired at a very high temperature.
 
Although ceramics have been known since antiquity, they are not obsolete materi-
als. On the contrary, ceramics constitute one of the most important classes of ‚Äúhigh-
tech‚Äù  materials. Because of their stability at high temperatures and resistance to 
corrosion, ceramics seem an obvious choice for constructing jet and automobile 
engines in which the greatest fuel efficiencies are possible at very high temperatures. 
But ceramics are brittle‚Äîthey break rather than bend‚Äîwhich limits their usefulness. 
However, more flexible ceramics can be obtained by adding small amounts of organic 
polymers. Taking their cue from natural ‚Äúorganoceramics‚Äù such as teeth and shells of 
sea creatures that contain small amounts of organic polymers, materials scientists have 
found that incorporating tiny amounts of long organic molecules into ceramics as they 
form produces materials that are much less subject to fracture. These materials should 
be useful for lighter, more durable engine parts, as well as for flexible superconducting 
wire and microelectronic devices. In addition, these organoceramics hold great prom-
ise for prosthetic devices such as artificial bones.
Semiconductors
Elemental silicon has the same structure as diamond, as might be expected from its 
position in the periodic table (in Group 4A directly under carbon). Recall that in dia-
mond there is a large energy gap between the filled and empty molecular orbitals (see 
Fig. 10.24). This gap prevents excitation of electrons to the empty molecular orbitals 
(conduction bands) and makes diamond an insulator. In silicon the situation is similar, 
but the energy gap is smaller. A few electrons can cross the gap at 258C, making silicon 
a semiconducting element, or semiconductor. In addition, at higher temperatures, 
where more energy is available to excite electrons into the conduction bands, the con-
ductivity of silicon increases. This is typical behavior for a semiconducting element 
and is in contrast to that of metals, whose conductivity decreases with increasing 
temperature.

The small conductivity of silicon can be enhanced at normal temperatures if the 
silicon crystal is doped with certain other elements. For example, when a small frac-
tion of silicon atoms is replaced by arsenic atoms, each having one more valence elec-
tron than silicon, extra electrons become available for conduction [Fig. 10.30(a)]. This 
produces an n-type semiconductor, a substance whose conductivity is increased by 
doping it with atoms having more valence electrons than the atoms in the host crystal. 
These extra electrons lie close in energy to the conduction bands and can be easily 
excited into these levels, where they can conduct an electric current [Fig. 10.31(a)].
 
We also can enhance the conductivity of silicon by doping the crystal with an 
 element such as boron, which has only three valence electrons, one fewer than silicon. 
 Because boron has one less electron than is required to form the bonds with the sur-
rounding silicon atoms, an electron vacancy, or hole, is created [Fig. 10.30(b)]. As an 
electron fills this hole, it leaves a new hole, and this process can be repeated. Thus the 
hole advances through the crystal in a direction opposite to the movement of the elec-
trons jumping to fill the hole. Another way of thinking about this phenomenon is that 
in pure silicon each atom has four valence electrons and the low-energy molecular 
orbitals are exactly filled. Replacing silicon atoms with boron atoms leaves vacancies 
in these molecular orbitals [see Fig. 10.31(b)]. This means that there is only one elec-
tron in some of the molecular orbitals, and these unpaired electrons can function as 
conducting electrons. Thus the substance becomes a better conductor. When semicon-
ductors are doped with atoms having fewer valence electrons than the atoms of the 
host crystal, they are called p-type semiconductors, so named because the positive 
holes can be viewed as the charge carriers.
 
Most important applications of semiconductors involve connection of a p-type and 
an n-type to form a p‚Äìn junction. Figure 10.32(a) shows a typical junction; the red 
dots represent excess electrons in the n-type semiconductor, and the white circles rep-
resent holes (electron vacancies) in the p-type semiconductor. At the junction, a small 
number of electrons migrate from the n-type region into the p-type region, where there 
are vacancies in the low-energy molecular orbitals. The effect of these migrations is to 
place a negative charge on the p-type region (since it now has a surplus of electrons) 
and a positive charge on the n-type region (since it has lost electrons, leaving holes in 
its low-energy molecular orbitals). This charge buildup, called the contact potential, or 
junction potential, prevents further migration of electrons.
 
Now suppose an external electric potential is applied by connecting the negative 
terminal of a battery to the p-type region and the positive terminal to the n-type region. 
The situation represented in Fig. 10.32(b) results. Electrons are drawn toward the posi-
tive terminal, and the resulting holes move toward the negative terminal‚Äîexactly 
opposite to the natural flow of electrons at the p‚Äìn junction. The junction resists the 
imposed current flow in this direction and is said to be under reverse bias. No current 
flows through the system.
 
On the other hand, if the battery is connected so that the negative terminal is con-
nected to the n-type region and the positive terminal is connected to the p-type region 
Electrons must be in singly occupied 
molecular orbitals to conduct a current.

[Fig. 10.32(c)], the movement of electrons (and holes) is in the favored direction. The 
junction has low resistance, and a current flows easily. The junction is said to be under 
forward bias.
A p‚Äìn junction makes an excellent rectifier, a device that produces a pulsating direct 
current (flows in one direction) from alternating current (flows in both directions alter-
nately). When placed in a circuit where the potential is constantly reversing, a p‚Äìn 
junction transmits current only under forward bias, thus converting the alternating 
current to direct current. Radios, computers, and other electronic devices formerly 
used bulky,  unreliable vacuum tubes as rectifiers. The p‚Äìn junction has revolutionized 
electronics; modern solid-state components contain p‚Äìn junctions in printed circuits.
10.6 Molecular Solids
So far we have considered solids in which atoms occupy the lattice positions. In some 
of these substances (network solids), the solid can be considered to be one giant mol-
ecule. In addition, there are many types of solids that contain discrete molecular units 
at each lattice position. A common example is ice, where the lattice positions are 
occupied by water molecules [see Fig. 10.13(c)]. Other examples are dry ice (solid 
carbon dioxide), some forms of sulfur that contain S8 molecules [Fig. 10.33(a)], and 
certain forms of phosphorus that contain P4 molecules [Fig. 10.33(b)]. These sub-
stances are characterized by strong  covalent bonding within the molecules but rela-
tively weak forces between the molecules. For example, it takes only 6 kJ of energy to 
melt 1 mole of solid water (ice) because only intermolecular (H2OOH2O) interactions 
must be overcome. However, 470 kJ of energy is required to break 1 mole of covalent 
OOH bonds. The differences between the covalent bonds within the molecules and 
Printed circuits are discussed in the 
Chemical Connections feature on the 
student website.

the forces between the molecules are apparent from the comparison of the interatomic 
and intermolecular distances in solids shown in Table 10.7.
 
The forces that exist among the molecules in a molecular solid depend on the nature 
of the molecules. Many molecules such as CO2, I2, P4, and S8 have no dipole moment, 
and the intermolecular forces are London dispersion forces. Because these forces are 
 often relatively small, we might expect all these substances to be gaseous at 258C, as is 
the case for carbon dioxide. However, as the size of the molecules increases, the Lon-
don forces become quite large, causing many of these substances to be solids at 258C.
 
When molecules do have dipole moments, their intermolecular forces are signifi-
cantly greater, especially when hydrogen bonding is possible. Water molecules are 
particularly well suited to interact with each other because each molecule has two 
polar OOH bonds and two lone pairs on the oxygen atom. This can lead to the associa-
tion of four hydrogen atoms with each oxygen: two by covalent bonds and two by 
dipole forces:

10.7 Ionic Solids
Ionic solids are stable, high-melting substances held together by the strong electro-
static forces that exist between oppositely charged ions. The principles governing the 
structures of ionic solids were introduced in Section 8.5. In this section we will review 
and extend these principles.
The structures of most binary ionic solids, such as sodium chloride, can be explained 
by the closest packing of spheres. Typically, the larger ions, usually the anions, are 
packed in one of the closest packing arrangements (hcp or ccp), and the smaller cations 
fit into holes among the closest packed anions. The packing is done in a way that maxi-
mizes the electrostatic attractions among oppositely charged ions and minimizes the 
repulsions among ions with like charges.
There are three types of holes in closest packed structures:
1.
Trigonal holes are formed by three spheres in the same layer [Fig. 10.34(a)].
2.
Tetrahedral holes are formed when a sphere sits in the dimple of three spheres in 
an adjacent layer [Fig. 10.34(b)].
3.
Octahedral holes are formed between two sets of three spheres in adjoining lay-
ers of the closest packed structures [Fig. 10.34(c)].
For spheres of a given diameter, the holes increase in size in the order
trigonal , tetrahedral , octahedral
In fact, trigonal holes are so small that they are never occupied in binary ionic com-
pounds. Whether the tetrahedral or octahedral holes in a given binary ionic solid are 
occupied  depends mainly on the relative sizes of the anion and cation. For example, in 
zinc sulfide the S22 ions (ionic radius 5 180 pm) are arranged in a cubic closest packed 
structure with the smaller Zn21 ions (ionic radius 5 70 pm) in the tetrahedral holes. 
The locations of the tetrahedral holes in the face-centered cubic unit cell of the ccp 
structure are shown in Fig. 10.35(a). Note from this figure that there are eight tetrahe-
dral holes in the unit cell. Also recall from the discussion in Section 10.4 that there are 
four net spheres in the face-centered cubic unit cell. Thus there are twice as many tet-
rahedral holes as packed anions in the closest packed structure. Zinc sulfide must have 
the same number of S22 ions and Zn21 ions to achieve electrical neutrality. Thus in  
the zinc sulfide structure only half the tetrahedral holes contain Zn21 ions, as shown in 
Fig. 10.35(c).
 
The structure of sodium chloride can be described in terms of a cubic closest packed 
array of Cl2 ions with Na1 ions in all the octahedral holes. The locations of the octa-
hedral holes in the face-centered cubic unit cell are shown in Fig. 10.36(a). The easiest 
octahedral hole to find in this structure is the one at the center of the cube. Note that 
this hole is surrounded by six spheres, as is required to form an octahedron. The 
remaining octahedral holes are shared with other unit cells and are more difficult to 
visualize. However, it can be shown that the number of octahedral holes in the ccp 
structure is the same as the number of packed anions. Figure 10.36(b) shows the 
10.7
Closest packed structures contain twice as 
many tetrahedral holes as packed spheres. 
Closest packed structures contain the same 
number of octahedral holes as packed 
spheres.

structure for sodium chloride that results from Na1 ions filling all the octahedral holes 
in a ccp array of Cl2 ions.
 
A great variety of ionic solids exists. Our purpose in this section is not to give an 
exhaustive treatment of ionic solids, but to emphasize the fundamental principles gov-
erning their structures. As we have seen, the most useful model for explaining the 
structures of these solids regards the ions as hard spheres that are packed to maximize 
attractions and minimize repulsions.
Determining the Number of Ions in a Unit Cell
Determine the net number of Na1 and Cl2 ions in the sodium chloride unit cell.
 
SOLUTION 
Note from Fig. 10.36(b) that the Cl2 ions are cubic closest packed and thus form a face-
centered cubic unit cell. There is a Cl2 ion on each corner and one at the center of each 
face of the cube. Thus the net number of Cl2 ions present in a unit cell is
8 1 1
8 2 1 6 1 1
2 2 5 4
The Na1 ions occupy the octahedral holes located in the center of the cube and midway 
along each edge. The Na1 ion in the center of the cube is contained entirely in the unit 
cell, whereas those on the edges are shared by four unit cells (four cubes share a common 
edge). Since the number of edges in a cube is 12, the net number of Na1 ions present is

10.8 Vapor Pressure and Changes 
of State
Now that we have considered the general properties of the three states of matter, we 
can explore the processes by which matter changes state. One very familiar example 
of a change in state occurs when a liquid evaporates from an open container. This is 
clear evidence that the molecules of a liquid can escape the liquid‚Äôs surface and form 
a gas, a process called vaporization, or evaporation. Vaporization is endothermic 
because energy is required to overcome the relatively strong intermolecular forces in 
the liquid. The energy required to vaporize 1 mole of a liquid at a pressure of 1 atm is 
called the heat of vaporization, or the enthalpy of vaporization, and is usually sym-
bolized as DHvap.
 
The endothermic nature of vaporization has great practical significance; in fact, one 
of the most important roles that water plays in our world is to act as a coolant. Because 
of the strong hydrogen bonding among its molecules in the liquid state, water has an 
unusually large heat of vaporization (40.7 kJ/mol). A significant portion of the sun‚Äôs 
energy that reaches earth is spent evaporating water from the oceans, lakes, and rivers 
rather than warming the earth. The vaporization of water is also crucial to the body‚Äôs 
temperature-control system through evaporation of perspiration.
Vapor Pressure
When a liquid is placed in a closed container, the amount of liquid at first decreases but 
eventually becomes constant. The decrease occurs because there is an initial net transfer 
of molecules from the liquid to the vapor phase (Fig. 10.37). This evaporation process 
occurs at a constant rate at a given temperature (Fig. 10.38). However, the reverse pro-
cess is different. Initially, as the number of vapor molecules increases, so does the rate 
of return of these molecules to the liquid. The process by which vapor molecules re-
form a liquid is called condensation. Eventually, enough vapor molecules are present 
above the liquid so that the rate of condensation equals the rate of evaporation (see 
10.8
Vapor is the usual term for the gas phase of 
a substance that exists as a solid or liquid 
at 258C and 1 atm.
DHvap for water at 1008C is 40.7 kJ/mol.

FIGURE 10.37 Behavior of a liquid 
in a closed container. (a) Initially, net 
evaporation occurs as  molecules are 
transferred from the liquid to the vapor 
phase, so the amount of liquid decreases. 
(b) As the number of vapor molecules 
increases, the rate of return to the liquid 
(condensation) increases, until finally the 
rate of condensation equals the rate of 
evaporation. The system is at equilibrium, 
and no further changes occur in the 
amounts of vapor or liquid.

Fig.¬†10.38). At this point no further net change occurs in the amount of liquid or vapor 
because the two opposite processes exactly balance each other; the system is at equi-
librium. Note that this system is highly dynamic on the molecular level‚Äîmolecules are 
constantly escaping from and entering the liquid at a high rate. However, there is no net 
change because the two opposite processes just balance each other.
 
The pressure of the vapor present at equilibrium is called the equilibrium vapor 
pressure, or more commonly, the vapor pressure of the liquid. A simple barometer 
can measure the vapor pressure of a liquid [Fig. 10.39(a)]. The liquid is injected at the 
bottom of the tube of mercury and floats to the surface because the mercury is so 
dense. A portion of the liquid evaporates at the top of the column, producing a vapor 
whose pressure pushes some mercury out of the tube. When the system reaches equi-
librium, the vapor pressure can be determined from the change in the height of the 
mercury column since

CRITICAL THINKING You have seen that the water molecule has 
a bent shape and therefore is a polar molecule. This accounts for many of water‚Äôs 
interesting properties. What if the water molecule was linear? How would this 
affect the properties of water, such as its surface tension, heat of vaporization, 
and vapor pressure? How would life be different?
 
The vapor pressures of liquids vary widely [Fig. 10.39(b)]. Liquids with high  vapor 
pressures are said to be volatile‚Äîthey evaporate rapidly from an open dish. The vapor 
pressure of a liquid is principally determined by the size of the intermolecular forces 
in the liquid. Liquids in which the intermolecular forces are large have relatively low 
vapor pressures because the molecules need high energies to escape to the vapor phase. 
For example, although water has a much lower molar mass than diethyl ether, the 
strong hydrogen-bonding forces that exist among water molecules in the liquid state 
cause water‚Äôs vapor pressure to be much lower than that of diethyl ether [Fig. 10.39(b)]. 
In general, substances with large molar masses have relatively low vapor pressures, 
mainly because of the large dispersion forces. The more electrons a substance has, the 
more polarizable it is, and the greater the dispersion forces are.
A system at equilibrium is dynamic on the 
molecular level but shows no macroscopic 
changes.

Measurements of the vapor pressure for a given liquid at several temperatures show 
that vapor pressure increases significantly with temperature. Figure 10.40 illustrates 
the distribution of molecular kinetic energy present in a liquid at two different tem-
peratures. To overcome the intermolecular forces in a liquid, a molecule must have 
sufficient kinetic energy. As the temperature of the liquid is increased, the fraction of 
molecules having the minimum energy needed to overcome these forces and escape 
to the vapor phase increases markedly. Thus the vapor pressure of a liquid increases 
dramatically with temperature. Values for water at several temperatures are given in 
Table¬†10.9.
 
The quantitative nature of the temperature dependence of vapor pressure can be 
represented graphically. Plots of vapor pressure versus temperature for water, ethanol, 
and diethyl ether are shown in Fig. 10.41(a). Note the nonlinear increase in vapor

pressure for all the liquids as the temperature is increased. We find that a straight line 
can be obtained by plotting ln(Pvap) versus 1yT, where T is the Kelvin temperature 
[Fig.¬†10.41(b)]. We can represent this behavior by the equation
 
ln1Pvap2 5 2

where DHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, R is the universal gas constant, and C is a 
constant characteristic of a given liquid. The symbol ln means that the natural loga-
rithm of the vapor pressure is taken.

Determining Enthalpies of Vaporization
Using the plots in Fig. 10.41(b), determine whether water or diethyl ether has the 
larger enthalpy of vaporization.
SOLUTION
When ln(Pvap) is plotted versus 1yT, the slope of the resulting straight line is

DHvap
R
Note from Fig. 10.41(b) that the slopes of the lines for water and diethyl ether are both 
negative, as expected, and that the line for ether has the smaller slope. Thus ether has 
the smaller value of DHvap. This makes sense because the hydrogen bonding in water 
causes it to have a relatively large enthalpy of vaporization.
See Exercise 10.91
 
Equation (10.4) is important for several reasons. For example, we can determine the 
heat of vaporization for a liquid by measuring Pvap at several temperatures and then 
evaluating the slope of a plot of ln(Pvap) versus 1yT. On the other hand, if we know the 
values of DHvap and Pvap at one temperature, we can use Equation (10.4) to calculate 
Pvap at another temperature. This can be done by recognizing that the constant C does 
not  depend on temperature. Thus at two temperatures T1 and T2 we can solve Equation 
(10.4) for C and then write the equality

Like liquids, solids have vapor pressures. Figure 10.42 shows iodine vapor forming 
solid iodine on the bottom of a cooled dish. Under normal conditions iodine sublimes; 
that is, it goes directly from the solid to the gaseous state without passing through the 
liquid state. Sublimation also occurs with dry ice (solid carbon dioxide).
Changes of State
What happens when a solid is heated? Typically, it will melt to form a liquid. If the 
heating continues, the liquid will at some point boil and form the vapor phase. This 
process can be represented by a heating curve: a plot of temperature versus time for a 
process where energy is added at a constant rate.
 
The heating curve for water is given in Fig. 10.43. As energy flows into the ice, the 
random vibrations of the water molecules increase as the temperature rises. Eventu-
ally, the molecules become so energetic that they break loose from their lattice posi-
tions, and the change from solid to liquid occurs. This is indicated by a plateau at 08C 
on the heating curve. At this temperature, called the melting point, all the added energy 
is used to disrupt the ice structure by breaking the hydrogen bonds, thus increasing the 
potential  energy of the water molecules. The enthalpy change that occurs at the melt-
ing point when a solid melts is called the heat of fusion, or more accurately, the 
enthalpy of fusion, DHfus. The melting points and enthalpies of fusion for several 
representative solids are listed in Table 10.10.
INTERACTIVE EXAMPLE 10.6
In solving this problem, we ignore the 
fact that DHvap is slightly temperature 
 dependent.
Ionic solids such as NaCl and NaF have 
very high melting points and enthalpies of 
fusion because of the strong ionic forces in 
these solids. At the other  extreme is O2(s), 
a molecular solid containing nonpolar 
molecules with weak  intermolecular forces. 
(See Table 10.10.)

The temperature remains constant until the solid has completely changed to liquid; 
then it begins to increase again. At 1008C the liquid water reaches its boiling point, and 
the temperature then remains constant as the added energy is used to vaporize the liq-
uid. When the liquid is completely changed to vapor, the temperature again begins to 
rise. Note that changes of state are physical changes; although intermolecular forces 
have been overcome, no chemical bonds have been broken. If the water vapor were 
heated to much higher temperatures, the water molecules would break down into the 
individual atoms. This would be a chemical change, since covalent bonds are broken. 
We no longer have water after this occurs.
 
The melting and boiling points for a substance are determined by the vapor pres-
sures of the solid and liquid states. Figure 10.44 shows the vapor pressures of solid and 
liquid water as functions of temperature near 08C. Note that below 08C the vapor pres-
sure of ice is less than the vapor pressure of liquid water. Also note that the vapor pres-
sure of ice has a larger temperature dependence than that of the liquid. That is, the 
vapor pressure of ice increases more rapidly for a given rise in temperature than does 
the vapor pressure of water. Thus as the temperature of the solid is increased, a point 
is eventually reached where the liquid and solid have identical vapor pressures. This 
is the melting point.
 
These concepts can be demonstrated experimentally using the apparatus illustrated 
in Fig. 10.45, where ice occupies one compartment and liquid water the other. Con-
sider the following cases.
Case 1
A temperature at which the vapor pressure of the solid is greater than that of the 
liquid. At this temperature the solid requires a higher pressure than the liquid does to 
be in equilibrium with the vapor. Thus as vapor is released from the solid to try to 
achieve equilibrium, the liquid will absorb vapor in an attempt to reduce the vapor 
pressure to its equilibrium value. The net effect is a conversion from solid to liquid 
through the vapor phase. In fact, no solid can exist under these conditions. The 
amount of solid will steadily decrease and the volume of liquid will increase. Finally, 
The melting and boiling points will be 
defined more precisely later in this section.

time) to vaporize liquid water than to melt ice. The slopes of the other lines are different because 
the different states of water have different molar heat capacities (the energy required to raise the

there will be only liquid in the right compartment, which will come to equilibrium 
with the water vapor, and no further changes will  occur in the system. This tempera-
ture must be above the melting point of ice, since only the liquid state can exist.
Case 2
A temperature at which the vapor pressure of the solid is less than that of the liquid. 
This is the opposite of the situation in case 1. In this case, the liquid requires a higher 
pressure than the solid does to be in equilibrium with the vapor, so the liquid will 
gradually disappear, and the amount of ice will increase. Finally, only the solid will 
remain, which will achieve equilibrium with the vapor. This temperature must be 
below the melting point of ice, since only the solid state can exist.
Case 3
A temperature at which the vapor pressures of the solid and liquid are identical. In this 
case, the solid and liquid states have the same vapor pressure, so they can coexist in the 
apparatus at equilibrium simultaneously with the vapor. This temperature represents 
the freezing point where both the solid and liquid states can exist.
We can now describe the melting point of a substance more precisely. The normal 
melting point is defined as the temperature at which the solid and liquid states have 
the same vapor pressure under conditions where the total pressure is 1 atmosphere.
Boiling occurs when the vapor pressure of a liquid becomes equal to the pressure of 
its environment. The normal boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which the 
vapor pressure of the liquid is exactly 1 atmosphere. This concept is illustrated in 
Fig. 10.46. At temperatures where the vapor pressure of the liquid is less than 1 atmo-
sphere, no bubbles of vapor can form because the pressure on the surface of the liquid 
is greater than the pressure in any spaces in the liquid where the bubbles are trying to 
form. Only when the liquid reaches a temperature at which the pressure of vapor in the 
spaces in the liquid is 1 atmosphere can bubbles form and boiling occur.
However, changes of state do not always occur exactly at the boiling point or melt-
ing point. For example, water can be readily supercooled; that is, it can be cooled 
below 08C at 1 atm pressure and remain in the liquid state. Supercooling occurs 
because, as it is cooled, the water may not achieve the degree of organization neces-
sary to form ice at 08C, and thus it continues to exist as the liquid. At some point the 
correct ordering occurs and ice rapidly forms, releasing energy in the exothermic pro-
cess and bringing the temperature back up to the melting point, where the remainder 
of the water freezes (Fig. 10.47).
A liquid also can be superheated, or raised to temperatures above its boiling point, 
especially if it is heated rapidly. Superheating can occur because bubble formation in

the interior of the liquid requires that many high-energy molecules gather in the same 
vicinity, and this may not happen at the boiling point, especially if the liquid is heated 
rapidly. If the liquid becomes superheated, the vapor pressure in the liquid is greater 
than the atmospheric pressure. Once a bubble does form, since its internal pressure is 
greater than that of the atmosphere, it can burst before rising to the surface, blowing 
the surrounding liquid out of the container. This is called bumping and has ruined 
many experiments. It can be avoided by adding boiling chips to the flask containing the 
liquid. Boiling chips are bits of porous ceramic material containing trapped air that 
escapes on heating, forming tiny bubbles that act as ‚Äústarters‚Äù for vapor bubble forma-
tion. This allows a smooth onset of boiling as the boiling point is reached.
10.9 Phase Diagrams
A phase diagram is a convenient way of representing the phases of a substance as a 
function of temperature and pressure. For example, the phase diagram for water 
(Fig.¬†10.48) shows which state exists at a given temperature and pressure. It is impor-
tant to recognize that a phase diagram describes conditions and events in a closed 
system of the type represented in Fig. 10.46, where no material can escape into the 
surroundings and no air is present. Notice that the diagram is not drawn to scale (nei-
ther axis is linear). This is done to emphasize certain features of the diagram that will 
be discussed below.

To show how to interpret the phase diagram for water, we will consider heating 
experiments at several pressures, shown by the dashed lines in Fig. 10.49.
Experiment 1
Pressure is 1 atm. This experiment begins with the cylinder shown in Fig. 10.46 com-
pletely filled with ice at a temperature of 2208C and the piston exerting a pressure of 
1 atm directly on the ice (there is no air space). Since at temperatures below 08C the 
vapor pressure of ice is less than 1 atm‚Äîwhich is the constant external pressure on the 
piston‚Äîno vapor is present in the cylinder. As the cylinder is heated, ice is the only 
component until the temperature reaches 08C, where the ice changes to liquid water as 
energy is added. This is the normal melting point of water. Note that under these condi-
tions no vapor exists in the  system. The vapor pressures of the solid and liquid are 
equal, but this vapor pressure is less than 1 atm, so no water vapor can exist. This is 
true on the solid/liquid line everywhere except at the triple point (see Experiment 3). 
When the solid has completely changed to liquid, the temperature again rises. At this 
point, the cylinder contains only liquid water. No vapor is present because the vapor 
pressure of liquid water under these conditions is less than 1 atm, the constant external 
pressure on the piston. Heating continues until the temperature of the liquid water 
reaches 1008C. At this point, the vapor pressure of liquid water is 1 atm, and boiling 
occurs, with the liquid changing to vapor. This is the normal boiling point of water. 
After the liquid has been completely converted to steam, the temperature again rises as 
the heating continues. The cylinder now contains only water vapor.
Experiment 2
Pressure is 2.0 torr. Again, we start with ice as the only component in the cylinder at 
2208C. The pressure exerted by the piston in this case is only 2.0 torr. As heating 
proceeds, the temperature rises to 2108C, where the ice changes directly to vapor, a 
process known as sublimation. Sublimation occurs when the vapor pressure of ice is 
equal to the external pressure, which in this case is only 2.0 torr. No liquid water 
appears under these conditions because the vapor pressure of liquid water is always 
greater than 2.0 torr, and thus it cannot exist at this pressure. If liquid water were 
placed in a cylinder under such a low pressure, it would vaporize immediately at tem-
peratures above 2108C or freeze at temperatures below 2108C.
Experiment 3
Pressure is 4.58 torr. Again, we start with ice as the only component in the cylinder at 
2208C. In this case the pressure exerted on the ice by the piston is 4.58 torr. As the 
cylinder is heated, no new phase appears until the temperature reaches 0.018C  
(273.16 K). At this point, called the triple point, solid and liquid water have identical

vapor pressures of 4.58 torr. Thus at 0.018C (273.16 K) and 4.58 torr all three states 
of water are present. In fact, only under these conditions can all three states of water 
coexist in a closed system.
Experiment 4
Pressure is 225 atm. In this experiment we start with liquid water in the cylinder at 
3008C; the pressure exerted by the piston on the water is 225 atm. Liquid water can be 
present at this temperature because of the high external pressure. As the temperature 
increases, something happens that we did not see in the first three experiments: The 
liquid gradually changes into a vapor but goes through an intermediate ‚Äúfluid‚Äù region, 
which is  neither true liquid nor vapor. This is quite unlike the behavior at lower tem-
peratures and pressures, say at 1008C and 1 atm, where the temperature remains con-
stant while a definite phase change from liquid to vapor occurs. This unusual behavior 
occurs because the conditions are beyond the critical point for water. The critical 
temperature can be defined as the temperature above which the vapor cannot be liq-
uefied no matter what pressure is applied. The critical pressure is the pressure required 
to produce liquefaction at the critical temperature. Together, the critical temperature 
and the critical pressure define the critical point. For water the critical point is 3748C 
and 218 atm. Note that the liquid/vapor line on the phase diagram for water ends at the 
critical point. Beyond this point the transition from one state to another involves the 
intermediate ‚Äúfluid‚Äù region just described.
Applications of the Phase Diagram for Water
There are several additional interesting features of the phase diagram for water. Note 
that the solid/liquid boundary line has a negative slope. This means that the melting 
point of ice decreases as the external pressure increases. This behavior, which is oppo-
site to that observed for most substances, occurs because the density of ice is less than 
that of liquid water at the melting point. The maximum density of water occurs at 48C; 
when liquid water freezes, its volume increases.
 
We can account for the effect of pressure on the melting point of water using the 
following reasoning. At the melting point, liquid and solid water coexist‚Äîthey are in 
dynamic equilibrium, since the rate at which ice is melting is just balanced by the rate 
at which the water is freezing. What happens if we apply pressure to this system? 
When subjected to increased pressure, matter reduces its volume. This behavior is 
most dramatic for gases but also occurs for condensed states. Since a given mass of ice 
at 08C has a larger volume than the same mass of liquid water, the system can reduce 
its volume in response to the increased pressure by changing to liquid. Thus at 08C and 
an external pressure greater than 1 atm, water is liquid. In other words, the freezing 
point of water is less than 08C when the pressure is greater than 1 atm.
 
Figure 10.50 illustrates the effect of pressure on ice. At the point X on the phase 
 diagram, ice is subjected to increased pressure at constant temperature. Note that as 
the pressure is increased, the solid/liquid line is crossed, indicating that the ice melts. 
This phenomenon may be important in ice skating. The narrow blade of the skate 
exerts a large pressure, since the skater‚Äôs weight is supported by the small area of the 
blade. Also, the frictional heating due to the moving skate contributes to the melting of 
the ice.* After the blade passes, the liquid refreezes as normal pressure and tempera-
ture return. Without this lubrication effect due to the thawing ice, ice skating would not 
be the smooth, graceful activity that many people enjoy.
 
Ice‚Äôs lower density has other implications. When water freezes in a pipe or an 
engine block, it will expand and break the container. This is why water pipes are insu-
lated in cold climates and antifreeze is used in water-cooled engines. The lower 
*The physics of ice skating is quite complex, and there is disagreement about whether the pressure or 
the frictional heating of the ice skate is most important. See ‚ÄúLetter to the Editor,‚Äù by R. Silberman,

density of ice also means that ice formed on rivers and lakes will float, providing a 
layer of insulation that helps prevent bodies of water from freezing solid in the winter. 
Aquatic life can therefore continue to live through periods of freezing temperatures.
 
A liquid boils at the temperature where the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the 
external pressure. Thus the boiling point of a substance, like the melting point, depends 
on the external pressure. This is why water boils at different temperatures at different 
elevations (Table 10.11), and any cooking carried out in boiling water will be affected 
by this variation. For example, it takes longer to hard-boil an egg in Leadville, Colo-
rado (elevation: 10,150 ft), than in San Diego, California (sea level), since water boils 
at a lower temperature in Leadville.
CRITICAL THINKING Ice is less dense than liquid water, as 
evidenced by the fact that ice floats in a glass of water. What if ice was more 
dense than liquid water? How would this affect the phase diagram for water?
 
As we mentioned earlier, the phase diagram for water describes a closed system. 
Therefore, we must be very cautious in using the phase diagram to explain the behav-
ior of water in a natural setting, such as on the earth‚Äôs surface. For example, in dry 
climates (low humidity), snow and ice seem to sublime‚Äîa minimum amount of slush 
is produced. Wet clothes put on an outside line at temperatures below 08C freeze and 
then dry while frozen. However, the phase diagram (Fig. 10.46) shows that ice should 
not be able to sublime at normal atmospheric pressures. What is happening in these 
cases? Ice in the natural environment is not in a closed system. The pressure is pro-
vided by the atmosphere rather than by a solid piston. This means that the vapor pro-
duced over the ice can escape from the immediate region as soon as it is formed. The 
vapor does not come to equilibrium with the solid, and the ice slowly disappears. 
Sublimation, which seems forbidden by the phase diagram, does in fact occur under 
these conditions, although it is not the sublimation under equilibrium conditions 
described by the phase diagram.
The Phase Diagram for Carbon Dioxide
The phase diagram for carbon dioxide (Fig. 10.51) differs from that for water. The 
solid/liquid line has a positive slope, since solid carbon dioxide is more dense than 
liquid carbon dioxide. The triple point for carbon dioxide occurs at 5.1 atm and 
256.68C, and the critical point occurs at 72.8 atm and 318C. At a pressure of 1 atm, 
solid carbon dioxide  sublimes at 2788C, a property that leads to its common name, dry

n 1955 Robert H. Wentorf, Jr., accom-
plished something that borders on 
alchemy‚Äîhe turned peanut butter 
into diamonds. He and his coworkers at 
the General Electric Research and 
Development Center also changed 
roofing pitch, wood, coal, and many 
other carbon-containing materials into 
diamonds, using a process involving 
temperatures of <20008C and pres-
sures of <105 atm. Although the first 
diamonds made by this process looked 
like black sand because of the impuri-
ties present, the process has now been 
developed to a point such that beauti-
ful, clear, gem-quality diamonds can be 
produced. General Electric now has the 
capacity to produce 150 million carats 
(30,000 kg) of diamonds annually (vir-
tually all of which is ‚Äúdiamond grit‚Äù 
used for industrial purposes such as 
abrasive coatings on cutting tools). The 
production of large, gem-quality dia-
monds by this process is still too 
expensive to compete with the natural 
sources of these stones. However, this 
may change as methods are developed 
for making diamonds at low pressures.
The high temperatures and pres-
sures used in the GE process for making 
diamonds make sense if one looks at 
the accompanying phase diagram for 
carbon. Note that graphite‚Äînot  
diamond‚Äîis the most stable form of 
carbon under ordinary conditions of 
temperature and pressure. However, 
diamond becomes more stable than 
graphite at very high pressures (as one 
would expect from the greater density 
of diamond). The high temperature 
used in the GE process is necessary to 
disrupt the bonds in graphite so that 
diamond (the most stable form of 
carbon at the high pressures used in 
the process) can form. Once the dia-
mond is produced, the elemental 
carbon is ‚Äútrapped‚Äù in this form at 
normal conditions (258C, 1 atm) because 
the reaction back to the graphite form 
is so slow. That is, even though graphite 
is more stable than diamond at 258C 
and 1 atm, diamond can exist almost 
indefinitely because the conversion to 
graphite is a very slow reaction. As a 
result, diamonds formed at the high 
pressures found deep in the earth‚Äôs 
crust can be brought to the earth‚Äôs 
surface by natural geologic processes 
and continue to exist for millions of 
years.*
We have seen that diamond formed 
in the laboratory at high pressures is 
‚Äútrapped‚Äù in this form, but this process 
is very expensive. Can diamond be 
formed at low pressures? The phase 
diagram for carbon says no. However, 
researchers have found that under the 
right conditions  diamonds can be 
‚Äúgrown‚Äù at low pressures. The process 
used is called chemical vapor deposition 
(CVD). CVD uses an energy source to 
release carbon atoms from a com-
pound such as methane into a steady 
flow of hydrogen gas (some of which is 
dissociated to produce hydrogen 
atoms). The carbon atoms then deposit 
as a diamond film on a surface main-
tained at a temperature between 600 
and 9008C. Why does diamond form on 
this surface rather than the favored 
graphite? Nobody is sure, but it has 
been suggested that at these relatively 
high temperatures the diamond struc-
ture grows faster than the graphite 
structure, so diamond is favored under 
these conditions. It also has been sug-
gested that the hydrogen atoms pres-
ent react much faster with graphite 
fragments than with diamond frag-
ments, effectively removing any graph-
ite from the growing film. Once it 
forms, of course, diamond is trapped. 
The major advantage of CVD is that 
there is no need for the extraordinarily 
high pressures used in the traditional 
process for synthesizing diamonds.
The first products with diamond 
films are already on the market. Audio-
philes can buy tweeters that have 
 diaphragms coated with a thin dia-
mond film that limits sound distortion. 
Watches with diamond-coated crystals 
are planned, as are diamond-coated 
windows in infrared scanning devices 
used in analytical instruments and 
 missile-guidance systems. These appli-
cations represent only the beginning 
for diamond-coated products.
*In Morocco, a 50-km-long slab called Beni 
Bousera contains chunks of graphite that 
were probably once diamonds formed in 
the deposit when it was buried 150 km 
underground. As this slab slowly rose to the 
surface over millions of years, the very slow 
reaction changing diamond to graphite had 
time to occur. On the other hand, in the 
diamond-rich kimberlite deposits in South 
Africa, which rise to the surface much faster, 
the diamonds have not had sufficient time 
to revert to graphite.

ice. No liquid phase occurs under normal atmospheric conditions, making dry ice a 
convenient refrigerant.
Carbon dioxide is often used in fire extinguishers, where it exists as a liquid at 258C 
under high pressures. Liquid carbon dioxide released from the extinguisher into the 
environment at 1 atm immediately changes to a vapor. Being heavier than air, this 
vapor smothers the fire by keeping oxygen away from the flame. The liquid/vapor 
transition is highly endothermic, so cooling also results, which helps to put out the fire.
The Difference Between Real and Ideal Gases
In Chapter 5 we discussed that no real gas exactly follows the ideal gas law, although 
many gases come very close at low pressure and/or high temperature. The van der 
Waals equation was developed to correct for the assumptions made in the kinetic 
molecular theory.
One assumption is that the particles of a gas are assumed to exert no forces on each 
other. We know that all gas particles exhibit attractive forces, termed intermolecular 
forces, and that the strength of these varies depending on the nature of the particles.
For example, consider He(g) and H2O(g). The helium atoms exhibit the relatively 
weak London dispersion forces, whereas water molecules exhibit the much stronger 
hydrogen bonding. We would expect, then, that helium gas would behave much more 
ideally than water vapor. This is supported by van der Waals constants. Recall that to 
account for the interparticle attractions of a gas, van der Waals added a correction fac-
tor to the observed pressure as follows:
Pideal 5 Pobs 1 aa n
Vb
2
Because gas particles attract one another, the particles will collide with the walls of 
the container slightly less often than they would ideally, so we need to add a correction 
factor to make up for this. Although the constant a in the correction factor was empiri-
cally determined by van der Waals, it turns out that the values of this constant gener-
ally serve as indexes of the strength of the intermolecular forces exhibited by the gas 
particles. For example, the value for the constant a for helium is 0.034, whereas that of 
water is 5.46. Thus, the correction factor for water, which exhibits hydrogen bonding, 
is much greater than that of helium, which exhibits the much weaker London disper-
sion forces.
Because the particles attract each other, we can surmise that at sufficiently low 
temperatures (or high pressures) the gas will condense. This behavior is demon-
strated by considering a plot of pressure versus volume for a real gas at various 
temperatures. 
A plot of P versus V for a gas behaving ideally is a hyperbola, as shown in Fig.¬†5.5. 
The shape of this plot will not change at different temperatures. But for a real gas, this 
is not the case.
Recall that the critical temperature (Tc) of a substance is the temperature above 
which the vapor cannot be liquefied no matter what pressure is applied. Let‚Äôs look at 
how the P versus V plot changes for a real gas at temperatures above, at, and below the 
critical temperature.
Note that at temperatures above the critical temperature, the plots looks similar to 
that of an ideal gas, although the shape changes as the temperature is lowered. At the 
critical temperature there is an inflection point, called the critical point (labeled Cp in 
Fig.¬†10.52). Below the critical temperature we can see that there is a region where the 
pressure decreases with decreasing volume. This is because the gas is condensing. In 
the region between points 1 and 2, the substance is in liquid/vapor equilibrium. At 
volumes below 1, only liquid remains and the pressure increases as the liquid is 
compressed.

statement best describes what occurs in the container?
a. Water evaporates until the air is saturated with water 
vapor; at this point, no more water evaporates.
b. Water evaporates until the air is overly saturated (super-

piece of nitinol wire will return to its original shape. The struc-
ture of nitinol consists of a simple cubic array of Ni atoms and 
an inner penetrating simple cubic array of Ti atoms. In the 
extended lattice, a Ti atom is found at the center of a cube of

  81. The CsCl structure is a simple cubic array of chloride ions 
with a cesium ion at the center of each cubic array (see Exer-
cise 71). Given that the density of cesium chloride is 3.97 g/
cm3, and assuming that the chloride and cesium ions touch 
along the body diagonal of the cubic unit cell, calculate the 
distance between the centers of adjacent Cs1 and Cl2 ions in 
the solid. Compare this value with the expected distance based 
on the sizes of the ions. The ionic radius of Cs1 is 169 pm, and 
the ionic radius of Cl2 is 181 pm.

Marathon Problem
This problem is designed to incorporate several concepts and 
techniques into one situation.
 160. General Zod has sold Lex Luthor what Zod claims to be a new 
copper-colored form of kryptonite, the only substance that can 
harm Superman. Lex, not believing in honor among thieves, 
decided to carry out some tests on the supposed kryptonite. 
From previous tests, Lex knew that kryptonite is a metal hav-
ing a specific heat capacity of 0.082 J/g ? 8C and a density of 
9.2 g/cm3.
 
Lex Luthor‚Äôs first experiment was an attempt to find the 
specific heat capacity of kryptonite. He dropped a 10 g 6 3 g 
sample of the metal into a boiling water bath at a temperature 
of 100.08C 6 0.28C. He waited until the metal had reached the 
bath temperature and then quickly transferred it to 100 g 6 
3 g of water that was contained in a calorimeter at an initial 
temperature of 25.08C 6 0.28C. The final temperature of the 
metal and water was 25.28C. Based on these results, is it pos-
sible to distinguish between copper and kryptonite? Explain.
 
When Lex found that his results from the first experiment 
were inconclusive, he decided to determine the density of the 
sample. He managed to steal a better balance and determined 
the mass of another portion of the purported kryptonite to be  
4 g 6 1 g. He dropped this sample into water contained in a 
25-mL graduated cylinder and found that it displaced a vol-
ume of 0.42 mL 6 0.02 mL. Is the metal copper or kryptonite? 
Explain.
 
Lex was finally forced to determine the crystal structure of 
the metal General Zod had given him. He found that the cubic 
unit cell contained four atoms and had an edge length of  
600. pm. Explain how this information enabled Lex to identify 
the metal as copper or kryptonite.
 
Will Lex be going after Superman with the kryptonite or 
seeking revenge on General Zod? What improvements could 
he have made in his experimental techniques to avoid per-
forming the crystal structure determination?
 152. You are asked to help set up a historical display in the park by 
stacking some cannonballs next to a Revolutionary War can-
non. You are told to stack them by starting with a triangle in

on the top centered over the middle of the triangular base.
a. How many cannonballs do you need?
b. What type of closest packing is displayed by the 
cannonballs?
c. The four corners of the pyramid of cannonballs form the 
 corners of what type of regular geometric solid?
 153. Some water is placed in a sealed glass container connected to 
a vacuum pump (a device used to pump gases from a con-
tainer), and the pump is turned on. The water appears to boil 
and then freezes. Explain these changes using the phase dia-
gram for water. What would happen to the ice if the vacuum 
pump was left on indefinitely?
 154. The molar enthalpy of vaporization of water at 373 K and  
1.00 atm is 40.7 kJ/mol. What fraction of this energy is used to 
change the internal energy of the water, and what fraction is 
used to do work against the atmosphere? (Hint: Assume that 
water vapor is an ideal gas.)
 155. For a simple cubic array, solve for the volume of an interior 
sphere (cubic hole) in terms of the radius of a sphere in the 
 array.
 156. Rubidium chloride has the sodium chloride structure at nor-
mal pressures but assumes the cesium chloride structure at 
high pressures. (See Exercise 71.) What ratio of densities is 
expected for these two forms? Does this change in structure 
make sense on the basis of simple models? The ionic radius is 
148 pm for Rb1 and 181 pm for Cl2.
Integrative Problems
These problems require the integration of multiple concepts to find 
the solutions.
 157. A 0.132-mole sample of an unknown semiconducting material 
with the formula XY has a mass of 19.0 g. The element X has 
an electron configuration of [Kr]5s24d10. What is this semi-
conducting material? A small amount of the Y atoms in the 
semiconductor is replaced with an equivalent amount of atoms 
with an electron configuration of [Ar]4s23d104p5. Does this 
correspond to n-type or p-type doping?
 158. A metal burns in air at 6008C under high pressure to form an 
oxide with formula MO2. This compound is 23.72% oxygen 
by mass. The distance between touching atoms in a cubic clos-
est packed crystal of this metal is 269.0 pm. What is this 
metal? What is its density?
 159. One method of preparing elemental mercury involves roasting 
cinnabar (HgS) in quicklime (CaO) at 600.8C followed by 
condensation of the mercury vapor. Given the heat of vapor-
ization of mercury (296 J/g) and the vapor pressure of mercury 
at 25.08C (2.56 3 1023 torr), what is the vapor pressure of the 
condensed mercury at 300.8C? How many atoms of mercury 
are present in the mercury vapor at 300.8C if the reaction is 
conducted in a closed 15.0-L container?

M
ost of the substances we encounter in daily life are mixtures: Wood, milk, 
 gasoline, champagne, seawater, shampoo, steel, and air are common exam-
ples. When the components of a mixture are uniformly intermingled‚Äîthat is, when a 
mixture is  homogeneous‚Äîit is called a solution. Solutions can be gases, liquids, or 
solids, as shown in Table 11.1. However, we will be concerned in this chapter with the 
properties of  liquid solutions,  particularly those containing water. As we saw in Chap-
ter 4, many essential chemical  reactions occur in aqueous solutions because water is 
capable of dissolving so many substances.
11.1 Solution Composition
Because a mixture, unlike a chemical compound, has a variable composition, the rela-
tive amounts of substances in a solution must be specified. The qualitative terms dilute 
(relatively little solute present) and concentrated (relatively large amount of solute) are 
often used to describe solution content, but we need to define solution composition 
more precisely to perform calculations. For example, in dealing with the stoichiometry 
of solution reactions in Chapter 4, we found it useful to describe solution composition 
in terms of molarity, or the number of moles of solute per liter of solution (symbolized 
by M).
Other ways of describing solution composition are also useful. Mass percent (some-
times called weight percent) is the percent by mass of the solute in the solution:
Mass percent 5 a mass of solute
mass of solutionb 3 100%
 
Another way of describing solution composition is the mole fraction (symbolized 
by the lowercase Greek letter chi, x), the ratio of the number of moles of a given com-
ponent to the total number of moles of solution. For a two-component solution, where 
nA and nB represent the number of moles of the two components,
Mole fraction of component A 5 xA 5
nA
nA 1 nB
Still another way of describing solution composition is molality (symbolized by 
m), the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent:
Molality 5
moles of solute
kilogram of solvent
11.1
A solute is the substance being dissolved. 
The solvent is the dissolving medium.
Molarity 5 moles of solute
liters of solution
When liquids are mixed, the liquid  present 
in the largest amount is called the solvent.
In very dilute aqueous solutions, the 
magnitude of the molality and the  molarity 
are almost the same.

CRITICAL THINKING You are given two aqueous solutions with 
different ionic solutes (Solution A and Solution B). What if you are told that 
Solution A has a greater concentration than Solution B by mass percent, but 
Solution B has a greater concentration than Solution A in terms of molality? Is 
this possible? If not, explain why not. If it is possible, provide example solutes for 
A and B and justify your answer with calculations.
 
Another concentration measure sometimes encountered is normality (symbolized 
by N). Normality is defined as the number of equivalents per liter of solution, where 
the definition of an equivalent depends on the reaction taking place in the solution. For 
an acid‚Äìbase reaction, the equivalent is the mass of acid or base that can furnish or 
accept exactly 1 mole of protons (H1 ions). In Table 11.2, note, for example, that the 
equivalent mass of sulfuric acid is the molar mass divided by 2, since each mole of 
H2SO4 can furnish 2 moles of protons. The equivalent mass of calcium hydroxide is 
also half the molar mass, since each mole of Ca(OH)2 contains 2 moles of OH2 ions 
that can react with 2 moles of protons. The equivalent is defined so that 1 equivalent of 
acid will react with exactly 1 equivalent of base.
 
For oxidation‚Äìreduction reactions, the equivalent is defined as the quantity of oxi-
dizing or reducing agent that can accept or furnish 1 mole of electrons. Thus 1 equiva-
lent of reducing agent will react with exactly 1 equivalent of oxidizing agent. The 
equivalent mass of an oxidizing or reducing agent can be calculated from the number 
of electrons in its half-reaction. For example, MnO42 reacting in acidic solution 
absorbs five electrons to produce Mn21:
MnO4
2 1 5e2 1 8H1 h Mn21 1 4H2O
Since the MnO42 ion present in 1 mole of KMnO4 consumes 5 moles of electrons, the 
equivalent mass is the molar mass divided by 5:
Equivalent mass of KMnO4 5 molar mass
5
5 158 g
5
5 31.6 g
Calculating Various Methods of Solution Composition 
from the Molarity
The electrolyte in automobile lead storage batteries is a 3.75 M sulfuric acid solution 
that has a density of 1.230 g/mL. Calculate the mass percent, molality, and normality 
of the sulfuric acid.
The definition of an equivalent depends on 
the reaction taking place in the solution.
The quantity we call equivalent mass here 
traditionally has been called equivalent 
weight.
Oxidation‚Äìreduction half-reactions were 
discussed in Section 4.10.

11.2 The Energies of Solution 
Formation
Dissolving solutes in liquids is very common. We dissolve salt in the water used to 
cook vegetables, sugar in iced tea, stains in cleaning fluid, gaseous carbon dioxide in 
water to make carbonated water, ethanol in gasoline to make gasohol, and so on.
Solubility is important in other ways. For example, because the pesticide DDT is fat-
soluble, it is retained and concentrated in animal tissues, where it causes detrimental 
effects. This is why DDT, even though it is effective for killing mosquitos, has been 
banned in the United States. Also, the solubility of various vitamins is important in deter-
mining correct dosages. The insolubility of barium sulfate means it can be used safely to 
improve X rays of the gastrointestinal tract, even though Ba21 ions are quite toxic.

What factors affect solubility? The cardinal rule of solubility is like dissolves like. 
We find that we must use a polar solvent to dissolve a polar or ionic solute and a non-
polar solvent to dissolve a nonpolar solute. Now we will try to understand why this 
behavior occurs. To simplify the discussion, we will assume that the formation of a 
liquid solution takes place in three distinct steps:
1. Separating the solute into its individual components (expanding the solute)
2. Overcoming intermolecular forces in the solvent to make room for the solute 
(expanding the solvent)
3. Allowing the solute and solvent to interact to form the solution
 
These steps are illustrated in Fig. 11.1. Steps 1 and 2 require energy, since forces 
must be overcome to expand the solute and solvent. Step 3 usually releases energy. In 
other words, Steps 1 and 2 are endothermic, and Step 3 is often exothermic. The 
enthalpy change associated with the formation of the solution, called the enthalpy 
(heat) of solution (DHsoln), is the sum of the DH values for the steps:
DHsoln 5 DH1 1 DH2 1 DH3
where DHsoln may have a positive sign (energy absorbed) or a negative sign (energy 
released) (Fig. 11.2).
Polar solvents dissolve polar solutes; 
nonpolar solvents dissolve nonpolar 
solutes.
The enthalpy of solution is the sum of the 
energies used in expanding both  solvent 
and solute and the energy of  solvent‚Äì
solute interaction.

To illustrate the importance of the various energy terms in the equation for DHsoln, 
we will consider two specific cases. First, we know that oil is not soluble in water. 
When oil tankers leak, the petroleum forms an oil slick that floats on the water and is 
eventually carried onto the beaches. We can explain the immiscibility of oil and water 
by considering the energy terms involved. Oil is a mixture of nonpolar molecules that 
interact through London dispersion forces, which depend on molecule size and num-
ber of electrons. We expect DH1 to be small for a typical nonpolar solute, but it will be 
relatively large for the large oil molecules. However, DH2 will be large and positive 
because it takes considerable energy to overcome the hydrogen-bonding forces among 
the water molecules to expand the solvent. As stated, the term DH3 is often exothermic. 
This is true even for interactions between polar and nonpolar molecules. Recall from 
Chapter 10 that a polar molecule can induce a dipole on a neighboring nonpolar mol-
ecule (this is termed a dipole-induced dipole interaction). However, the magnitude of 
this interaction is not as great as the magnitude of a dipole‚Äìdipole interaction. In the 
case of oil and water, then, the magnitude of DH3 will be smaller than the sum of DH1 
and DH2. Thus DHsoln will be large and positive because of the DH1 and DH2 terms. 
Since a large amount of energy would have to be expended to form an oil‚Äìwater solu-
tion, this process does not occur to any appreciable extent. These same  arguments hold 
true for any nonpolar solute and polar  solvent‚Äîthe combination of a nonpolar solute 
and a highly polar solvent is not expected to produce a solution.
 
As a second case, let‚Äôs consider the solubility of an ionic solute, such as sodium 
chloride, in water. Here the term DH1 is large and positive because the strong ionic 
forces in the crystal must be overcome, and DH2 is large and positive because hydro-
gen bonds must be broken in the water. Finally, DH3 is large and negative because of 
the strong interactions between the ions and the water molecules. In fact, the exother-
mic and endothermic terms essentially cancel, as shown from the known values:
 NaCl1s2 h Na11g2 1 Cl21g2
 DH1 5 786 kJ/mol
 H2O1l2 1 Na11g2 1 Cl21g2 h Na11aq2 1 Cl21aq2¬†¬†¬†¬† DHhyd 5 DH2 1 DH3
 5 2783 kJ/mol
Here the enthalpy (heat) of hydration (DHhyd) combines the terms DH2 (for expand-
ing the solvent) and DH3 (for solvent‚Äìsolute interactions). The heat of hydration rep-
resents the enthalpy change associated with the dispersal of a gaseous solute in water. 
Thus the heat of solution for dissolving sodium chloride is the sum of DH1 and DHhyd:
DHsoln 5 786 kJ/mol 2 783 kJ/mol 5 3 kJ/mol
 
Note that DHsoln is small but positive; the dissolving process requires a small amount 
of energy. Then why is NaCl so soluble in water? The answer lies in nature‚Äôs tendency 
toward higher probability of the mixed state. That is, processes naturally run in the 
direction that leads to the most probable state. For example, imagine equal numbers of 
orange and yellow spheres separated by a partition [Fig. 11.3(a)]. If we remove the 
partition and shake the container, the spheres will mix [Fig. 11.3(b)], and no amount 
of shaking will cause them to return to the state of separated orange and yellow. Why? 
The mixed state is simply much more likely to occur (more probable) than the original 
DH1 is expected to be small for nonpolar 
solutes but can be large for large  molecules 
with a great number of electrons.

separate state because there are many more ways of placing the spheres to give a mixed 
state than a separated state. This is a general principle. One factor that favors a process 
is an increase in probability.
 
But energy considerations are also important. Processes that require large amounts 
of energy tend not to occur. Since dissolving 1 mole of solid NaCl requires only a small 
amount of energy, the solution forms, presumably because of the large increase in the 
probability of the state when the solute and solvent are mixed.
 
The various possible cases for solution formation are summarized in Table 11.3. 
Note that in two cases, polar‚Äìpolar and nonpolar‚Äìnonpolar, the heat of solution is 
expected to be small. In these cases, the solution forms because of the increase in the 
probability of the mixed state. In the other cases (polar‚Äìnonpolar and nonpolar‚Äìpolar), 
the heat of solution is expected to be large and positive, and the large quantity of 
energy required acts to prevent the solution from forming. Although this discussion 
has greatly oversimplified the complex driving forces for solubility, these ideas are a 
useful starting point for understanding the observation that like dissolves like.
CRITICAL THINKING You and a friend are studying for a 
chemistry exam. What if your friend tells you, ‚ÄúSince exothermic processes are 
favored and the sign of the enthalpy change tells us whether or not a process is 
endothermic or exothermic, the sign of DHsoln tells us whether or not a solution 
will form‚Äù? How would you explain to your friend that this conclusion is not 
correct? What part, if any, of what your friend says is correct?
Differentiating Solvent Properties
Decide whether liquid hexane (C6H14) or 
liquid methanol (CH3OH) is the more appro-
priate solvent for the substances grease 
(C20H42) and potassium iodide (KI).
 
SOLUTION 
Hexane is a nonpolar solvent because it contains 
COH bonds. Thus hexane will work best for 
the nonpolar solute grease. Methanol has an 
OOH group that makes it significantly 
polar. Thus it will serve as the better solvent 
for the ionic solid KI.
See Exercises 11.51 through 11.53
The factors that act as driving forces for 
a process are discussed more fully in 
Chapter 17.

Chromatography
In Chapter 1 we introduced the technique of chromatography as a way of separating a 
mixture. Now that we have considered solution formation, we can better understand 
how chromatography works. There are many different methods of chromatography, 
but all include a system with two phases: a mobile phase and a stationary phase.
For the purposes of this discussion, we will consider thin layer chromatography 
(TLC), which uses a TLC plate as the stationary phase. This plate consists of a plastic 
sheet covered with a thin layer of silica gel. The silica gel is very polar and is capable 
of hydrogen bonding. The mixture to be analyzed is placed (‚Äúspotted‚Äù) on the plate, 
and the plate is dipped into a solvent (the mobile phase). The solvent travels up the 
plate due to capillary action, which is why it is termed the mobile phase.
For example, suppose we have a mixture of two polar compounds, A and B, and A 
is more polar than B. Also assume that the solvent we have chosen is slightly polar. In 
this case, A (more polar) will have a greater affinity for the silica gel on the plate than 
for the mobile solvent. Compound B (less polar) will have more affinity for the mobile 
phase than for the silica gel. Thus, the less polar component (B) will travel farther with 
the solvent, and the mixture will be separated (Fig. 11.4). This example shows how 
TLC depends on the relative polarities of substances to be separated.
11.3 Factors Affecting Solubility
Structure Effects
In the last section we saw that solubility is favored if the solute and solvent have simi-
lar polarities. Since it is the molecular structure that determines polarity, there should 
be a definite connection between structure and solubility. Vitamins provide an excel-
lent example of the relationship among molecular structure, polarity, and solubility.
Recently, there has been considerable publicity about the pros and cons of consum-
ing large quantities of vitamins. For example, large doses of vitamin C have been 
advocated to combat various illnesses, including the common cold. Vitamin E has been 
extolled as a youth-preserving elixir and a protector against the carcinogenic (cancer-
causing) effects of certain chemicals. However, there are possible detrimental effects 
from taking large amounts of some vitamins, depending on their solubilities.
Vitamins can be divided into two classes: fat-soluble (vitamins A, D, E, and K) and 
water-soluble (vitamins B and C). The reason for the differing solubility characteristics

can be seen by comparing the structures of vitamins A and C (Fig. 11.5). Vitamin¬†A, 
composed mostly of carbon and hydrogen atoms that have similar electronegativities, is 
virtually  non polar. This causes it to be soluble in nonpolar materials such as body fat, 
which is also largely composed of carbon and hydrogen, but not soluble in polar sol-
vents such as water. On the other hand, vitamin C has many polar OOH and COO 
bonds, making the molecule polar and thus water-soluble. We often describe nonpolar 
materials such as vitamin A as  hydro phobic (water-fearing) and polar substances such 
as vitamin C as  hydrophilic (water-loving).
 
Because of their solubility characteristics, the fat-soluble vitamins can build up in 
the fatty tissues of the body. This has both positive and negative effects. Since these 
vitamins can be stored, the body can tolerate for a time a diet deficient in vitamin A, 
D, E, or K. Conversely, if excessive amounts of these vitamins are consumed, their 
buildup can lead to the illness hypervitaminosis.
 
In contrast, the water-soluble vitamins are excreted by the body and must be con-
sumed regularly. This fact was first recognized when the British navy discovered that 
scurvy, a disease often suffered by sailors, could be prevented if the sailors regularly 
ate fresh limes (which are a good source of vitamin C) when aboard ship (hence the 
name ‚Äúlimey‚Äù for the British sailor).
Pressure Effects
While pressure has little effect on the solubilities of solids or liquids, it does signifi-
cantly increase the solubility of a gas. Carbonated beverages, for example, are always 
bottled at high pressures of carbon dioxide to ensure a high concentration of carbon 
dioxide in the liquid. The fizzing that occurs when you open a can of soda results from 
the escape of gaseous carbon dioxide because under these conditions the pressure of 
CO2 above the  solution is now much lower than that used in the bottling process.

The increase in gas solubility with pressure can be understood from Fig. 11.6. 
Figure 11.6(a) shows a gas in equilibrium with a solution; that is, the gas molecules are 
entering and leaving the solution at the same rate. If the pressure is suddenly  increased 
[Fig. 11.6(b)], the number of gas molecules per unit volume increases, and the gas 
enters the solution at a higher rate than it leaves. As the concentration of dissolved gas 
increases, the rate of the escape of the gas also increases until a new equilibrium is 
reached [Fig. 11.6(c)], where the solution contains more dissolved gas than before.
The relationship between gas pressure and the concentration of dissolved gas is 
given by Henry‚Äôs law:
C 5 kP
where C represents the concentration of the dissolved gas, k is a constant characteristic 
of a particular solution, and P represents the partial pressure of the gaseous solute 
above the solution. In words, Henry‚Äôs law states that the amount of a gas dissolved in 
a solution is directly proportional to the pressure of the gas above the solution.
Henry‚Äôs law is obeyed most accurately for dilute solutions of gases that do not dis-
sociate in or react with the solvent. For example, Henry‚Äôs law is obeyed by oxygen gas 
in water, but it does not correctly represent the behavior of gaseous hydrogen chloride 
in water because of the dissociation reaction
HCl1g2  88n H11aq2 1 Cl21aq2
Calculations Using Henry‚Äôs Law
A certain soft drink is bottled so that a bottle at 258C contains 
CO2¬†gas at a pressure of 5.0 atm over the liquid. Assuming that the 
partial pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere is 4.0 3 1024 atm, calcu-
late the equilibrium concentrations of CO2 in the soda both before 
and after the bottle is opened. The Henry‚Äôs law constant for CO2 in 
aqueous solution is 3.1 3 1022 mol/L ? atm at 258C.

John Dalton, formulated his law in 1801.
Henry‚Äôs law holds only when there is no 
chemical reaction between the solute and 
solvent.

Temperature Effects (for Aqueous Solutions)
Everyday experiences of dissolving substances such as sugar may lead you to think 
that solubility always increases with temperature. This is not the case. The dissolving 
of a solid occurs more rapidly at higher temperatures, but the amount of solid that can 
be dissolved may increase or decrease with increasing temperature. The effect of tem-
perature on the solubility in water of several solids is shown in Fig. 11.7. Note that 
although the solubility of most solids in water increases with temperature, the solubili-
ties of some substances (such as sodium sulfate and cerium sulfate) decrease with 
increasing temperature.
 
Predicting the temperature dependence of solubility is very difficult. For example, 
 although there is some correlation between the sign of DH8soln and the variation of solu-
bility with temperature, important exceptions exist.* The only sure way to determine 
the temperature dependence of a solid‚Äôs solubility is by experiment.
 
The behavior of gases dissolving in water appears less complex. The solubility of a 
gas in water typically decreases with increasing temperature,‚Ä† as is shown for several 
cases in Fig. 11.8. This temperature effect has important environmental implications 
because of the widespread use of water from lakes and rivers for industrial cooling. 
After being used, the water is returned to its natural source at a higher than ambient 
temperature (thermal pollution has occurred). Because it is warmer, this water con-
tains less than the normal concentration of oxygen and is also less dense; it tends to 
‚Äúfloat‚Äù on the colder water below, thus blocking normal oxygen absorption. This effect 
can be especially important in deep lakes. The warm upper layer can seriously decrease 
the amount of oxygen available to aquatic life in the deeper layers of the lake.
 
The decreasing solubility of gases with increasing temperature is also responsible 
for the formation of boiler scale. As we will see in more detail in Chapter 14, the 
 bicarbonate ion is formed when carbon dioxide is dissolved in water containing the 
 carbonate ion:
CO3 221aq2 1 CO21aq2 1 H2O1l2 h 2HCO3 21aq2
 
When the water also contains Ca21 ions, this reaction is especially important‚Äî 
calcium bicarbonate is soluble in water, but calcium carbonate is insoluble. When the 
 water is heated, the carbon dioxide is driven off. For the system to replace the lost 
 carbon dioxide, the reverse reaction must occur:
2HCO3 21aq2 h H2O1l2 1 CO21aq2 1 CO3 221aq2
*For more information see R. S. Treptow, ‚ÄúLe Ch√¢telier‚Äôs Principle Applied to the Temperature 
Dependence of Solubility,‚Äù J. Chem. Educ. 61 (1984): 499.
‚Ä†The opposite behavior is observed for most nonaqueous solvents.
DH8soln refers to the formation of a 1.0-M 
ideal solution and is not necessarily 
relevant to the process of dissolving a solid 
in a saturated solution. Thus DH8soln is of 
limited use in predicting the variation of 
solubility with temperature.

a period of time, the water is transferred

This reaction, however, also increases the concentration of carbonate ions, causing 
solid calcium carbonate to form. This solid is the boiler scale that coats the walls of 
containers such as industrial boilers and tea kettles. Boiler scale reduces the efficiency 
of heat transfer and can lead to blockage of pipes (Fig. 11.9).
11.4 The Vapor Pressures 
of Solutions
Liquid solutions have physical properties significantly different from those of the pure 
solvent, a fact that has great practical importance. For example, we add antifreeze to 
the water in a car‚Äôs cooling system to prevent freezing in winter and boiling in summer. 
We also melt ice on sidewalks and streets by spreading salt. These preventive measures 
work because of the solute‚Äôs effect on the solvent‚Äôs properties.
To explore how a nonvolatile solute affects a solvent, we will consider the experi-
ment represented in Fig. 11.10, in which a sealed container encloses a beaker contain-
ing an aqueous sulfuric acid solution and a beaker containing pure water. Gradually, 
the  volume of the sulfuric acid solution increases and the volume of the pure water 
decreases. Why? We can explain this observation if the vapor pressure of the pure 
solvent is greater than that of the solution. Under these conditions, the pressure of 
vapor necessary to achieve equilibrium with the pure solvent is greater than that 
required to reach equilibrium with the aqueous acid solution. Thus as the pure solvent 
emits vapor to attempt to reach equilibrium, the aqueous sulfuric acid solution absorbs 
vapor to try to lower the vapor pressure toward its equilibrium value. This process 
results in a net transfer of  water from the pure water through the vapor phase to the 
sulfuric acid solution. The  system can reach an equilibrium vapor pressure only when 
all the water is transferred to the  solution. This experiment is just one of many observa-
tions indicating that the presence of a nonvolatile solute lowers the vapor pressure of 
a solvent.
We can account for this behavior in terms of the simple model shown in Fig.¬†11.11. 
The dissolved nonvolatile solute decreases the number of solvent molecules per unit 
volume and it should proportionately lower the escaping tendency of the solvent 
molecules. For example, in a solution consisting of half nonvolatile solute molecules 
and half solvent molecules, we might expect the observed vapor pressure to be half

A nonvolatile solute has no tendency to 
escape from solution into the vapor phase.

that of the pure solvent, since only half as many molecules can escape. In fact, this is 
what is observed.
Detailed studies of the vapor pressures of solutions containing nonvolatile solutes 
were carried out by Fran√ßois M. Raoult (1830‚Äì1901). His results are described by the 
equation known as Raoult‚Äôs law:

n August 21, 1986, a cloud of gas 
suddenly boiled from Lake Nyos in 
Cameroon, killing nearly 2000 people. 
Although at first it was speculated that 
the gas was hydrogen sulfide, it now 
seems clear it was carbon dioxide. What 
would cause Lake Nyos to emit this 
huge, suffocating cloud of CO2? 
Although the answer may never be 
known for certain, many scientists 
believe that the lake suddenly ‚Äúturned 
over,‚Äù bringing to the surface water that 
contained huge quantities of dissolved 
carbon dioxide. Lake Nyos is a deep lake 
that is thermally stratified: Layers of 
warm, less dense water near the surface 
float on the colder, denser water layers 
near the lake‚Äôs bottom. Under normal 
conditions the lake stays this way; there 
is little mixing among the different 
layers. Scientists believe that over hun-
dreds or thousands of years, carbon 
dioxide gas had seeped into the cold 
water at the lake‚Äôs bottom and dis-
solved in great amounts because of the 
large pressure of CO2 present (in accor-
dance with Henry‚Äôs law). For some 
reason on August 21, 1986, the lake 
apparently suffered an overturn, pos-
sibly due to wind or to unusual cooling 
of the lake‚Äôs surface by monsoon 
clouds. This caused water that was 
greatly supersaturated with CO2 to 
reach the surface and release tremen-
dous quantities of gaseous CO2 that 
suffocated thousands of humans and 
animals before they knew what hit 
them‚Äîa tragic, monumental illustra-
tion of Henry‚Äôs law.
Since 1986 the scientists studying 
Lake Nyos and nearby Lake Monoun 
have observed a rapid recharging of 
the CO2 levels in the deep waters of 
these lakes, causing concern that 
another deadly gas release could occur 
at any time. Apparently the only way to 
prevent such a disaster is to pump 
away the CO2-charged deep water in 
the two lakes. Scientists at a conference 
to study this problem in 1994 recom-
mended such a solution, but it has not 
yet been funded by Cameroon.

where Psoln is the observed vapor pressure of the solution, xsolvent is the mole fraction 
of solvent, and P0
solvent is the vapor pressure of the pure solvent. Note that for a solution 
of half solute and half solvent molecules, xsolvent is 0.5, so the vapor pressure of the 
solution is half that of the pure solvent. On the other hand, for a solution in which 
three-fourths of the solution molecules are solvent, xsolvent 5 3

with a slope equal to P0

Calculate the expected vapor pressure at 258C for a solution prepared by dissolving 
158.0 g common table sugar (sucrose, molar mass 5 342.3 g/mol) in 643.5 cm3 of 
water. At 258C, the density of water is 0.9971 g/cm3 and the vapor pressure is 23.76 torr.

The phenomenon of the lowering of the vapor pressure gives us a convenient way 
to ‚Äúcount‚Äù molecules and thus provides a means for experimentally determining molar 
masses. Suppose a certain mass of a compound is dissolved in a solvent and the vapor 
pressure of the resulting solution is measured. Using Raoult‚Äôs law, we can determine 
the number of moles of solute present. Since the mass of this number of moles is 
known, we can calculate the molar mass.
We also can use vapor pressure measurements to characterize solutions. For exam-
ple, 1 mole of sodium chloride dissolved in water lowers the vapor pressure approxi-
mately twice as much as expected because the solid has two ions per formula unit, 
which separate when it dissolves. Thus vapor pressure measurements can give valu-
able information about the nature of the solute after it dissolves.
Calculating the Vapor Pressure of a Solution Containing 
Ionic Solute
Predict the vapor pressure of a solution prepared by mixing 35.0 g solid Na2SO4 (molar 
mass 5 142.05 g/mol) with 175 g water at 258C. The vapor pressure of pure water at 
258C is 23.76 torr.
 
SOLUTION 
First, we need to know the mole fraction of H2O.
 nH2O 5 175 g H2O 3 1 mol H2O
18.02 g H2O 5 9.71 mol H2O
 nNa2SO4 5 35.0 g Na2SO4 3
1 mol Na2SO4
142.05 g Na2SO4
5 0.246 mol Na2SO4
It is essential to recognize that when 1 mole of solid Na2SO4 dissolves, it produces  
2 moles of Na1 ions and 1 mole of SO422 ions. Thus the number of solute particles 
present in this solution is three times the number of moles of solute dissolved:

Nonideal Solutions
So far we have assumed that the solute is nonvolatile and so does not contribute to the 
vapor pressure over the solution. However, for liquid‚Äìliquid solutions where both 
components are volatile, a modified form of Raoult‚Äôs law applies:
PTOTAL 5 PA 1 PB 5 xAP 0

where PTOTAL represents the total vapor pressure of a solution containing A and B, xA

A and P0
B are the vapor pressures of pure

and of B in the vapor above the solution (Fig. 11.13).
 
A liquid‚Äìliquid solution that obeys Raoult‚Äôs law is called an ideal solution. 
Raoult‚Äôs law is to solutions what the ideal gas law is to gases. As with gases, ideal 
behavior for solutions is never perfectly achieved but is sometimes closely approached. 
The lowering of vapor pressure depends 
on the number of solute particles present 
in the solution.

Nearly ideal behavior is often observed when the solute‚Äìsolute, solvent‚Äìsolvent, and 
solute‚Äìsolvent interactions are very similar. That is, in solutions where the solute and 
solvent are very much alike, the solute simply acts to dilute the solvent. However, if 
the solvent has a special affinity for the solute, such as if hydrogen bonding occurs, 
the tendency of the solvent molecules to escape will be lowered more than expected. 
The observed vapor pressure will be lower than the value predicted by Raoult‚Äôs law; 
there will be a negative deviation from Raoult‚Äôs law.
 
When a solute and solvent release large quantities of energy in the formation of a 
solution, that is, when DHsoln is large and negative, we can assume that strong interac-
tions exist between the solute and solvent. In this case we expect a negative deviation 
from Raoult‚Äôs law, because both components will have a lower escaping tendency in 
the solution than in the pure liquids. This behavior is illustrated by an acetone‚Äìwater 
solution, where the molecules can hydrogen-bond effectively:

In contrast, if two liquids mix endothermically, it indicates that the solute‚Äìsolvent 
 interactions are weaker than the interactions among the molecules in the pure liquids. 
More energy is required to expand the liquids than is released when the liquids are 
mixed. In this case the molecules in the solution have a higher tendency to escape than 
expected, and positive deviations from Raoult‚Äôs law are observed (Fig. 11.14). An 
example of this case is provided by a solution of ethanol and hexane, whose Lewis 
structures are as follows:

As we discussed in Section 11.2, there are dipole-induced dipole interactions among the 
polar ethanol and the nonpolar hexane molecules. However, these interactions are not 
as effective as the interactions among ethanol molecules with other ethanol molecules 
and those among hexane molecules with other hexane molecules. Thus the enthalpy of 
solution is positive, as is the deviation from Raoult‚Äôs law.
Strong solute‚Äìsolvent interaction gives a 
vapor pressure lower than that predicted 
by Raoult‚Äôs law.

Finally, for a solution of very similar liquids, such as benzene and toluene (shown 
in margin), the enthalpy of solution is very close to zero, and thus the solution closely 
obeys Raoult‚Äôs law (ideal behavior).
 
A summary of the behavior of various types of solutions is given in Table 11.4.
Calculating the Vapor Pressure of a Solution Containing 
Two Liquids
A solution is prepared by mixing 5.81 g acetone (C3H6O, molar mass 5 58.1 g/mol) 
and 11.9 g chloroform (HCCl3, molar mass 5 119.4 g/mol). At 358C, this solution has 
a total vapor pressure of 260. torr. Is this an ideal solution? The vapor pressures of pure 
acetone and pure chloroform at 358C are 345 and 293 torr, respectively.
 
SOLUTION 
To decide whether this solution behaves ideally, we first calculate the expected vapor 
pressure using Raoult‚Äôs law:
PTOTAL 5 xAP0
A 1 xCP0
C
where A stands for acetone and C stands for chloroform. The calculated value can then 
be compared with the observed vapor pressure.
 
First, we must calculate the number of moles of acetone and chloroform:
5.81 g acetone 3 1 mol acetone
58.1 g acetone 5 0.100 mol acetone
11.9 g chloroform 3 1 mol chloroform
119 g chloroform 5 0.100 mol chloroform
Since the solution contains equal numbers of moles of acetone and chloroform, that is,
xA 5 0.500¬†¬†and¬†¬†xC 5 0.500
the expected vapor pressure is
‚ñ† PTOTAL 5 10.5002 1345 torr2 1 10.5002 1293 torr2 5 319 torr
Comparing this value with the observed pressure of 260. torr shows that the solution does 
not behave ideally. The observed value is lower than that expected. This negative devia-
tion from Raoult‚Äôs law can be explained in terms of the hydrogen-bonding interaction

11.5 Boiling-Point Elevation and 
Freezing-Point Depression
In the preceding section we saw how a solute affects the vapor pressure of a liquid 
solvent. Because changes of state depend on vapor pressure, the presence of a solute 
also  affects the freezing point and boiling point of a solvent. Freezing-point depres-
sion, boiling-point elevation, and osmotic pressure (discussed in Section 11.6) are 
called colligative properties. As we will see, they are grouped together because they 
depend only on the number, and not on the identity, of the solute particles in an ideal 
solution. Because of their direct relationship to the number of solute particles, the col-
ligative properties are very useful for characterizing the nature of a solute after it is 
dissolved in a solvent and for determining molar masses of substances.
Boiling-Point Elevation
The normal boiling point of a liquid occurs at the temperature where the vapor pres-
sure is equal to 1 atmosphere. We have seen that a nonvolatile solute lowers the vapor 
pressure of the solvent. Therefore, such a solution must be heated to a higher tempera-
ture than the boiling point of the pure solvent to reach a vapor pressure of 1 atmo-
sphere. This means that a nonvolatile solute elevates the boiling point of the solvent. 
Figure 11.15 shows the phase diagram for an aqueous solution containing a nonvola-
tile solute. Note that the  liquid/vapor line is shifted to higher temperatures than those 
for pure water.
As you might expect, the magnitude of the boiling-point elevation depends on the 
concentration of the solute. The change in boiling point can be represented by the 
equation
DT 5 Kbmsolute
where DT is the boiling-point elevation, or the difference between the boiling point of 
the solution and that of the pure solvent, Kb is a constant that is characteristic of the 
solvent and is called the molal boiling-point elevation constant, and msolute is the 
molality of the solute in the solution.
 
Values of Kb for some common solvents are given in Table 11.5. The molar mass of 
a solute can be determined from the observed boiling-point elevation, as shown in 
 Example 11.8.

Calculating the Molar Mass by Boiling-Point Elevation
A solution was prepared by dissolving 18.00 g glucose in 150.0 g water. The resulting 
 solution was found to have a boiling point of 100.348C. Calculate the molar mass  
of  glucose. Glucose is a molecular solid that is present as individual molecules in 
solution.

We make use of the equation
DT 5 Kbmsolute
where 
DT 5 100.34¬∞C 2 100.00¬∞C 5 0.34¬∞C
From Table 11.5, for water Kb 5 0.51. The molality of this solution then can be calcu-
lated by rearranging the boiling-point elevation equation to give
msolute 5 DT

0.34¬∞C
0.51¬∞C # kg/mol 5 0.67 mol/kg
The solution was prepared using 0.1500 kg water. Using the definition of molality, we 
can find the number of moles of glucose in the solution.
 msolute 5 0.67 mol/kg 5 mol solute
kg solvent 5
nglucose
0.1500 kg
 nglucose 5 10.67 mol/kg2 10.1500 kg2 5 0.10 mol
Thus 0.10 mole of glucose has a mass of 18.00 g, and 1.0 mole of glucose has a mass 
of 180 g (10 3 18.00 g). The molar mass of glucose is 180 g/mol.
See Exercise 11.72
Freezing-Point Depression
When a solute is dissolved in a solvent, the freezing point of the solution is lower than 
that of the pure solvent. Why? Recall that the vapor pressures of ice and liquid water 
are the same at 08C. Suppose a solute is dissolved in water. The resulting solution will 
not freeze at 08C because the water in the solution has a lower vapor pressure than 
that of pure ice. No ice will form under these conditions. However, the vapor pressure 
of ice decreases more rapidly than that of liquid water as the temperature decreases. 
Therefore, as the solution is cooled, the vapor pressure of the ice and that of the liquid

water in the solution will eventually become equal. The temperature at which this 
occurs is the new freezing point of the solution and is below 08C. The freezing point 
has been depressed.
 
We can account for this behavior in terms of the simple model shown in Fig. 11.16. 
The presence of the solute lowers the rate at which molecules in the liquid return to the 
solid state. Thus for an aqueous solution, only the liquid state is found at 08C. As the 
solution is cooled, the rate at which water molecules leave the solid ice decreases until 
this rate and the rate of formation of ice become equal and equilibrium is reached. This 
is the freezing point of the water in the solution.
 
Because a solute lowers the freezing point of water, compounds such as sodium 
chloride and calcium chloride are often spread on streets and sidewalks to prevent ice 
from forming in freezing weather. Of course, if the outside temperature is lower than 
the freezing point of the resulting salt solution, ice forms anyway. So this procedure is 
not effective at extremely cold temperatures.
 
The solid/liquid line for an aqueous solution is shown on the phase diagram for 
water in Fig. 11.15. Since the presence of a solute elevates the boiling point and 
depresses the freezing point of the solvent, adding a solute has the effect of extending 
the liquid range.
 
The equation for freezing-point depression is analogous to that for boiling-point 
 elevation:
DT 5 Kf msolute
where DT is the freezing-point depression, or the difference between the freezing point 
of the pure solvent and that of the solution, and Kf is a constant that is characteristic of 
a particular solvent and is called the molal freezing-point depression constant. Val-
ues of Kf for common solvents are listed in Table 11.5.
 
Like the boiling-point elevation, the observed freezing-point depression can be 
used to determine molar masses and to characterize solutions.
Freezing-Point Depression
What mass of ethylene glycol (C2H6O2, molar mass 5 62.1 g/mol), the main compo-

exactly 1 g/mL.
 
SOLUTION 
The freezing point must be lowered from 08C to 223.38C. To determine the molality of 
ethylene glycol needed to accomplish this, we can use the equation
DT 5 Kf msolute
where DT 5 23.38 and Kf 5 1.86 (from Table 11.5). Solving for the molality gives

mining its molar mass. A sample weighing 0.546 g was dissolved in 15.0 g benzene, 
and the freezing-point depression was determined to be 0.2408C. Calculate the molar

11.6 Osmotic Pressure
Osmotic pressure, another of the colligative properties, can be understood from 
Fig. 11.17. A solution and pure solvent are separated by a semipermeable membrane, 
which allows solvent but not solute molecules to pass through. As time passes, the

 volume of the solution increases and that of the solvent decreases. This flow of sol-
vent into the solution through the semipermeable membrane is called osmosis. 
Eventually the liquid levels stop changing, indicating that the system has reached 
equilibrium.  Because the liquid levels are different at this point, there is a greater 
hydrostatic pressure on the solution than on the pure solvent. This excess pressure is 
called the osmotic pressure.
 
We can take another view of this phenomenon, as illustrated in Fig. 11.18. Osmosis 
can be prevented by applying a pressure to the solution. The minimum pressure that 
stops the osmosis is equal to the osmotic pressure of the solution. A simple model to 
explain osmotic pressure can be constructed as shown in Fig. 11.19. The membrane 
allows only solvent molecules to pass through. However, the initial rates of solvent 
transfer to and from the solution are not the same. The solute particles interfere with 
the passage of solvent, so the rate of transfer is slower from the solution to the solvent 
than in the reverse direction. Thus there is a net transfer of solvent  molecules into the 
solution, which causes the solution volume to increase. As the solution level rises in 
the tube, the resulting pressure exerts an extra ‚Äúpush‚Äù on the solvent molecules in the 
solution, forcing them back through the membrane. Eventually, enough pressure 
develops so that the solvent transfer becomes equal in both directions. At this point, 
equilibrium is achieved and the levels stop changing.
 
Osmotic pressure can be used to characterize solutions and determine molar masses, 
as can the other colligative properties, but osmotic pressure is particularly useful 
because a small concentration of solute produces a relatively large osmotic pressure.

Experiments show that the dependence of the osmotic pressure on solution concen-
tration is represented by the equation
P 5 MRT
where P is the osmotic pressure in atmospheres, M is the molarity of the solution, R is 
the gas law constant, and T is the Kelvin temperature.
 
A molar mass determination using osmotic pressure is illustrated in Example 11.11.
CRITICAL THINKING Consider the model of osmotic pressure 
as shown in Fig. 11.19. What if both sides contained a different pure solvent, each 
with a different vapor pressure? What would the system look like at equilibrium? 
Assume the different solvent molecules are able to pass through the membrane.
Determining Molar Mass from Osmotic Pressure
To determine the molar mass of a certain protein, 1.00 3 1023 g of it was dissolved in 
enough water to make 1.00 mL of solution. The osmotic pressure of this solution was 
found to be 1.12 torr at 25.08C. Calculate the molar mass of the protein.
 
SOLUTION 
We use the equation
P 5 MRT
In this case we have
 P 5 1.12 torr 3

760 torr 5 1.47 3 1023 atm
 R 5 0.08206 L # atm/K # mol
 T 5 25.0 1 273 5 298 K
Note that the osmotic pressure must be converted to atmospheres because of the units of R.
 
Solving for M gives
M 5

Since 1.00 3 1023 g protein was dissolved in 1 mL solution, the mass of protein per 
liter of solution is 1.00 g. The solution‚Äôs concentration is 6.01 3 1025 mol/L. This 
concentration is produced from 1.00 3 1023 g protein per milliliter, or 1.00 g/L. Thus 
6.01 3 1025 mol protein has a mass of 1.00 g and

large, but it is relatively small for a protein.
See Exercises 11.81 and 11.82
 
In osmosis, a semipermeable membrane prevents transfer of all solute particles. A 
similar phenomenon, called dialysis, occurs at the walls of most plant and animal 
cells. However, in this case the membrane allows transfer of both solvent molecules 
and small solute molecules and ions. One of the most important applications of 
INTERACTIVE EXAMPLE 11.11
Measurements of osmotic pressure  
generally give much more accurate molar 
mass values than those from freezing-point 
or boiling-point changes.

dialysis is the use of artificial kidney machines to purify the blood. The blood is passed 
through a cellophane tube, which acts as the semipermeable membrane. The tube is 
immersed in a dialyzing solution (Fig. 11.20). This ‚Äúwashing‚Äù solution contains the 
same concentrations of ions and small molecules as blood but has none of the waste 
products normally removed by the kidneys. The resulting dialysis (movement of waste 
molecules into the washing solution) cleanses the blood.
 
Solutions that have identical osmotic pressures are said to be isotonic solutions. 
Fluids administered intravenously must be isotonic with body fluids. For example, if 
red blood cells are bathed in a hypertonic solution, which is a solution having an 
osmotic pressure higher than that of the cell fluids, the cells will shrivel because of a 
net transfer of water out of the cells. This phenomenon is called crenation. The oppo-
site phenomenon, called hemolysis, occurs when cells are bathed in a hypotonic solu-
tion, a solution with an osmotic pressure lower than that of the cell fluids. In this case, 
the cells rupture because of the flow of water into the cells.
 
We can use the phenomenon of crenation to our advantage. Food can be preserved 
by treating its surface with a solute that gives a solution that is hypertonic to bacteria 
cells. Bacteria on the food then tend to shrivel and die. This is why salt can be used to 
protect meat and sugar can be used to protect fruit.
Isotonic Solutions
What concentration of sodium chloride in water is needed to produce an aqueous solu-
tion isotonic with blood (P 5 7.70 atm at 258C)?

Reverse Osmosis
If a solution in contact with pure solvent across a semipermeable membrane is sub-
jected to an external pressure larger than its osmotic pressure, reverse osmosis occurs. 
The pressure will cause a net flow of solvent from the solution to the solvent 
(Fig. 11.21). In reverse osmosis, the semipermeable membrane acts as a ‚Äúmolecular 
filter‚Äù to remove solute particles. This fact is applicable to the desalination (removal 
of dissolved salts) of seawater, which is highly hypertonic to body fluids and thus is 
not drinkable.
 
As the population of the Sun Belt areas of the United States increases, more demand 
will be placed on the limited supplies of fresh water there. One obvious source of fresh 
water is from the desalination of seawater. Various schemes have been suggested, 
 including solar evaporation, reverse osmosis, and even a plan for towing icebergs from 
Antarctica. The problem, of course, is that all the available processes are expensive. 
 However, as water shortages increase, desalination is becoming necessary. For exam-
ple, the first full-time public desalination plant in the United States started operations 
on Catalina Island, just off the coast of California (Fig. 11.22). This plant, which can 
produce 132,000 gallons of drinkable water from the Pacific Ocean every day, operates 
by reverse osmosis. Powerful pumps, developing over 800 lb/in2 of pressure, are used 
to force seawater through synthetic semipermeable membranes.
 
Catalina Island‚Äôs plant may be just the beginning. The city of Santa Barbara opened 
a $40 million desalination plant in 1992 that can produce 8 million gallons of drinking 
water per day. The southern California city of Carlsbad opened a reverse osmosis 
desalination plant in 2012 that can produce 50 million gallons of drinking water daily 
from seawater. Desalination plants are also in the works for Huntington Beach, Cali-
fornia, and Camp Pendleton, a military base just north of Carlsbad.
 
A small-scale, manually operated reverse osmosis desalinator has been developed 
by the U.S. Navy to provide fresh water on life rafts. Potable water can be supplied by 
this desalinator at the rate of 1.25 gallons of water per hour‚Äîenough to keep 25 people 
alive. This compact desalinator, which weighs only 10 pounds, can now replace the 
bulky cases of fresh water formerly stored in Navy life rafts.

11.7 Colligative Properties 
of¬†Electrolyte Solutions
As we have seen previously, the colligative properties of solutions depend on the total 
concentration of solute particles. For example, a 0.10-m glucose solution shows a 
freezing-point depression of 0.1868C:
DT 5 Kf m 5 11.86¬∞C # kg/mol2 10.100 mol/kg2 5 0.186¬∞C
On the other hand, a 0.10-m sodium chloride solution should show a freezing-point 
depression of 0.378C, since the solution is 0.10 m Na1 ions and 0.10 m Cl2 ions. 
Therefore, the solution contains a total of 0.20 m solute particles, and DT 5 (1.868C ? 
kg/mol)(0.20 mol/kg) 5 0.378C.
 
The relationship between the moles of solute dissolved and the moles of particles in 
solution is usually expressed using the van‚Äôt Hoff factor, i:
i 5 moles of particles in solution
moles of solute dissolved
The expected value for i can be calculated for a salt by noting the number of ions per 
formula unit. For example, for NaCl, i is 2; for K2SO4, i is 3; and for Fe3(PO4)2, i¬†is¬†5. 
These calculated values assume that when a salt dissolves, it completely dissociates into 
its component ions, which then move around independently. This assumption is not 
always true. For example, the freezing-point depression observed for 0.10 m NaCl is 
1.87 times that for 0.10 m glucose rather than twice as great. That is, for a 0.10-m NaCl 
solution, the observed value for i is 1.87 rather than 2. Why? The best explanation is that 
ion pairing occurs in solution (Fig. 11.23). At a given instant a small percentage of the 
sodium and chloride ions are paired and thus count as a single particle. In general, ion 
pairing is most important in concentrated solutions. As the solution becomes more

dilute, the ions are farther apart and less ion pairing occurs. For example, in a 0.0010-m 
NaCl solution, the observed value of i is 1.97, which is very close to the expected value.
 
Ion pairing occurs to some extent in all electrolyte solutions. Table 11.6 shows 
expected and observed values of i for a given concentration of various electrolytes. 
Note that the deviation of i from the expected value tends to be greatest where the ions 
have multiple charges. This is expected because ion pairing ought to be most important 
for highly charged ions.
 
The colligative properties of electrolyte solutions are described by including the 
van‚Äôt Hoff factor in the appropriate equation. For example, for changes in freezing and 
boiling points, the modified equation is
DT 5 imK
where K represents the freezing-point depression or boiling-point elevation constant 
for the solvent.
 
For the osmotic pressure of electrolyte solutions, the equation is
P 5 iMRT
Osmotic Pressure
The observed osmotic pressure for a 0.10-M solution of Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 at 258C is 
10.8¬†atm. Compare the expected and experimental values for i.
 
SOLUTION 
The ionic solid Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 dissociates in water to produce 5 ions:
Fe1NH42 21SO42 2 88n Fe21 1 2NH4 1 1 2SO4 22
Thus the expected value for i is 5. We can obtain the experimental value for i by using 
the equation for osmotic pressure:
P 5 iMRT¬†¬†¬†¬†or¬†¬†¬†¬†i 5
P

where P 5 10.8 atm, M 5 0.10 mol/L, R 5 0.08206 L ? atm/K ? mol, and T 5 25¬†1 273¬†5

pairing.

11.8 Colloids
Mud can be suspended in water by vigorous stirring. When the stirring stops, most of 
the particles rapidly settle out, but even after several days some of the smallest parti-
cles remain suspended. Although undetected in normal lighting, their presence can be 
demonstrated by shining a beam of intense light through the suspension. The beam is 
visible from the side because the light is scattered by the suspended particles 
(Fig. 11.24). In a true solution, on the other hand, the beam is invisible from the side 
because the individual ions and molecules dispersed in the solution are too small to 
scatter visible light.
The scattering of light by particles is called the Tyndall effect and is often used to 
distinguish between a suspension and a true solution.
A suspension of tiny particles in some medium is called a colloidal dispersion, or a 
colloid. The suspended particles are single large molecules or aggregates of molecules 
11.8
I
n 1965, the University of Florida foot-
ball team, the Gators, participated in a 
research program to test a sports drink 
formula containing a mixture of carbo-
hydrates and electrolytes. The drink 
was used to help prevent dehydration 
caused by extreme workouts in the hot 
Florida climate. The Gators‚Äô success that 
season was in part attributed to their 
use of the sports drink  formula. In 1967, 
a modified form of this formula was 
marketed with the name Gatorade. 
Today, Gatorade leads sales in sports 
drinks, but many other brands have 
entered a  market where annual sales 
exceed $700 million!
During moderate- to high-intensity 
exercise, glycogen (a fuel reserve  
that helps maintain normal body pro-
cesses) can be depleted within  
60 to 90 minutes. Blood-sugar  levels 
drop as the glycogen reserves are used 
up, and lactic acid (a by-product of 
glucose metabolism) builds up in 
 muscle tissue, causing fatigue and 
muscle cramps. Muscles also generate a 
large amount of heat that must be 
dissipated. Water, which has a large 
specific heat capacity, is used to take 
heat away from these muscles. Sweat-
ing and evaporative cooling help the 
body maintain a constant  temperature, 
but at a huge cost. During a high-
intensity workout in hot weather, any-
where from 1 to 3 quarts of  water can 
be lost from sweating per hour. Sweat-
ing away more than 2% of your body 
weight‚Äîa quart for every 100 pounds‚Äî 
can put a large stress on the heart, 
increasing body temperature and 
decreasing performance.  Excessive 
sweating also results in the loss of 
sodium and  potassium ions‚Äîtwo very 
important electrolytes that are present 
in the fluids inside and outside cells.
All the major sports drinks contain 
three main  ingredients‚Äîcarbohydrates 
in the form of simple sugars such as 
sucrose, glucose, and fructose; electro-
lytes,  including sodium and potassium 
ions; and water. Because these are the 
three major substances lost through 
sweating, good scientific reasoning 
suggests that drinking sports drinks 
should improve performance. But just 
how effectively do sports drinks deliver 
on their promises?
Recent studies have confirmed that 
athletes who eat a balanced diet and 
drink plenty of water are just as well off 
as those who consume sports drinks.  
A sports drink may have only one 
advantage over drinking water‚Äîit 
tastes  better than water to most ath-
letes. And if a drink tastes  better, it will 
encourage more consumption, thus 
keeping cells hydrated.
Since most of the leading sports 
drinks contain the same ingredients in 
similar concentrations, taste may be the 
single most important factor in choosing 
your drink. If you are not interested in any 
particular sports drink, drink plenty of 
water. The key to quality performance is 
to keep your cells hydrated.

or ions ranging in size from 1 to 1000 nm. Colloids are classified according to the states 
of the dispersed phase and the dispersing medium. Table 11.7 summarizes various types 
of colloids.
What stabilizes a colloid? Why do the particles remain suspended rather than form-
ing larger aggregates and precipitating out? The answer is complicated, but the main 
factor seems to be electrostatic repulsion. A colloid, like all other macroscopic sub-
stances, is electrically neutral. However, when a colloid is placed in an electric field, 
the dispersed particles all migrate to the same electrode and thus must all have the 
same charge. How is this possible? The center of a colloidal particle (a tiny ionic crys-
tal, a group of  molecules, or a single large molecule) attracts from the medium a layer 
of ions, all of the same charge. This group of ions, in turn, attracts another layer of 
oppositely charged ions (Fig. 11.25). Because the colloidal particles all have an outer 
layer of ions with the same charge, they repel each other and do not easily aggregate 
to form particles that are large enough to precipitate.
The destruction of a colloid, called coagulation, usually can be accomplished 
either by heating or by adding an electrolyte. Heating increases the velocities of the 
colloidal particles, causing them to collide with enough energy that the ion barriers are 
penetrated and the particles can aggregate. Because this process is repeated many 
times, the particle grows to a point where it settles out. Adding an electrolyte neutral-
izes the adsorbed ion layers. This is why clay suspended in rivers is deposited where

two colloidal particles. In each the center

electrically neutral, they still repel each

layer of ions.
T
he ice-cold waters of the polar 
oceans are teeming with fish that 
seem immune to freezing. One might 
think that these fish have some kind of 
antifreeze in their blood. However, 
studies show that they are protected 
from freezing in a very different way 
from the way antifreeze protects our 
cars. As we have seen in this chapter, 
solutes such as sugar, salt, and ethylene 
glycol lower the temperature at which 
the solid and liquid phases of water can 
coexist. However, the fish could not 
tolerate high concentrations of solutes 
in their blood because of the  osmotic 
pressure effects. Instead, they are 
protected by proteins in their blood. 
These proteins allow the water in the 
bloodstream to be supercooled‚Äîexist 
below 08C‚Äîwithout forming ice. They 
apparently coat the surface of each tiny 
ice crystal as soon as it begins to form, 
preventing it from growing to a size 
that would cause biologic damage.
Although it might at first seem 
surprising, this research on polar fish 
has attracted the attention of ice cream 
manu facturers. Premium quality ice 
cream is smooth; it does not have large 
ice crystals in it. The makers of ice 
cream would like to incorporate these 
polar fish proteins, or molecules that 
behave similarly, into ice cream to 
prevent the growth of ice crystals 
during storage.
Fruit and vegetable growers have a 
similar interest: They also want to pre-
vent ice formation that damages their 
crops during an unusual cold wave. 
However, this is a very different kind of 
problem than keeping polar fish from 
freezing. Many types of fruits and 
vegetables are colonized by bacteria 
that manufacture a protein that encour-
ages freezing by acting as a nucleating 
agent to start an ice crystal. Chemists 
have identified the offending protein in 
the bacteria and the gene that is 
responsible for making it. They have 
learned to modify the genetic material 
of these bacteria in a way that removes 
their ability to make the protein that 
encourages ice crystal formation. If 
testing shows that these modified 
bacteria have no harmful effects on the 
crop or the environment, the original 
bacteria strain will be replaced with the 
new form so that ice crystals will not 
form so readily when a cold snap 
occurs.

the river reaches the ocean, forming the deltas characteristic of large rivers like the 
Mississippi. The high salt content of the seawater causes the colloidal clay particles to 
coagulate.
The removal of soot from smoke is another example of the coagulation of a colloid. 
When smoke is passed through an electrostatic precipitator (Fig. 11.26), the suspended 
solids are removed. The use of precipitators has produced an immense improvement in 
the air quality of heavily industrialized cities.

 1. The four most common ways to describe solution com-

molality. Define each of these solution composition 
terms. Why is molarity temperature-dependent, whereas 
the other three solution composition terms are 
temperature-independent?
 2. Using KF as an example, write equations that refer to

DHhyd and DHLE for KF, where DHLE¬†5 lattice energy. 
DHsoln for KF, as for other  soluble ionic compounds, is a

DHLE are relatively large negative numbers?

the calculated value? Is the discrepancy greater for 
concentrated or dilute solutions?
 10. What is a colloidal dispersion? Give some examples of 
colloids. The Tyndall  effect is often used to distinguish 
between a colloidal suspension and a true  solution. 
Explain. The destruction of a colloid is done through a 
process called coagulation. What is coagulation?
calculate DT for a freezing-point depression problem 
or a boiling-point elevation problem. Of the solvents 
listed in Table 11.5, which would have the largest 
freezing-point depression for a 0.50 molal solution? 
Which would have the smallest  boiling-point elevation 
for a 0.50 molal solution?
 
A common application of freezing-point depression 
and boiling-point elevation experiments is to provide a 
means to calculate the molar mass of a nonvolatile 
solute. What data are needed to calculate the molar 
mass of a nonvolatile solute? Explain how you would 
manipulate these data to calculate the molar mass of the 
nonvolatile solute.
 8. What is osmotic pressure? How is osmotic pressure 
calculated? Molarity units are used in the osmotic pres-
sure equation. When does the molarity of a solution

tion? If so, is the rate of evaporation increasing, decreas-
ing, or staying constant?

 nonvolatile solute in the solvent in one beaker, the two beakers 
contain different volatile liquids. That is, suppose one beaker

the boiling point and decrease the freezing point. A friend of 
yours explains it to you like this: ‚ÄúThe solute and solvent can be 
like salt in water. The salt gets in the way of freezing in that it 
blocks the water molecules from joining  together. The salt acts 
like a strong bond holding the water molecules together so that 
it is harder to boil.‚Äù What do you say to your friend?

tor. The next day when you each go to get the colas, whose 
will be more carbonated and why?
 9. Is molality or molarity dependent on temperature? Explain your

 10. Consider a beaker of salt water sitting open in a room. Over 
time, does the vapor pressure increase, decrease, or stay the 
same? Explain.

 80. Erythrocytes are red blood cells containing hemoglobin. In a 
saline solution they shrivel when the salt concentration is high 
and swell when the salt concentration is low. In a 258C aque-

T
he applications of chemistry focus largely on chemical reactions, and the 
commercial use of a reaction requires knowledge of several of its character-
istics, including its stoichiometry, energetics, and rate. A reaction is defined by its 
reactants and products, whose identity must be learned by experiment. Once the 
reactants and products are known, the equation for the reaction can be written and 
balanced, and stoichiometric calculations can be carried out. Another very important 
characteristic of a reaction is its spontaneity. Spontaneity refers to the inherent ten-
dency for the process to occur; however, it implies nothing about speed. Spontane-
ous does not mean fast. There are many spontaneous reactions that are so slow that 
no apparent reaction occurs over a period of weeks or years at normal temperatures. 
For example, there is a strong inherent tendency for gaseous hydrogen and oxygen 
to combine, that is,
2H21 g2 1 O21 g2 h 2H2O1 l 2
but in fact the two gases can coexist indefinitely at 258C. Similarly, the gaseous 
reactions
 H21 g2 1 Cl21 g2 h 2HCl1 g2
 N21 g2 1 3H21 g2 h 2NH31 g2
are both highly likely to occur from a thermodynamic standpoint, but we observe no 
reactions under normal conditions. In addition, the process of changing diamond to 
graphite is spontaneous but is so slow that it is not detectable.
To be useful, reactions must occur at a reasonable rate. To produce the 20 million 
tons of ammonia needed each year for fertilizer, we cannot simply mix nitrogen and 
hydrogen gases at 258C and wait for them to react. It is not enough to understand the 
stoichiometry and thermodynamics of a reaction; we also must understand the factors 
that govern the rate of the reaction. The area of chemistry that concerns reaction rates 
is called chemical kinetics.
One of the main goals of chemical kinetics is to understand the steps by which a 
reaction takes place. This series of steps is called the reaction mechanism.
Un derstanding the mechanism allows us to find ways to facilitate the reaction. For 
example, the Haber process for the production of ammonia requires high tempera-
tures to achieve commercially feasible reaction rates. However, even higher tem-
peratures (and more cost) would be required without the use of iron oxide, which 
speeds up the reaction.
In this chapter we will consider the main ideas of chemical kinetics. We will explore 
rate laws, reaction mechanisms, and simple models for chemical reactions.
12.1 Reaction Rates
To introduce the concept of the rate of a reaction, we will consider the decomposition 
of nitrogen dioxide, a gas that causes air pollution. Nitrogen dioxide decomposes to 
nitric oxide and oxygen as follows:
2NO21 g2 h 2NO1 g2 1 O21 g2
Suppose in a particular experiment we start with a flask of nitrogen dioxide at 3008C 
and measure the concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, nitric oxide, and oxygen as the 
nitrogen dioxide decomposes. The results of this experiment are summarized in 
Table¬†12.1, and the data are plotted in Fig. 12.1.
Note from these results that the concentration of the reactant (NO2) decreases with 
time and the concentrations of the products (NO and O2) increase with time (Fig. 12.2). 
Chemical kinetics deals with the speed at which these changes occur. The speed, or 
rate, of a process is defined as the change in a given quantity over a specific period of 
time. For chemical reactions, the quantity that changes is the amount or concentration

of a  reactant or product. So the reaction rate of a chemical reaction is defined as the 
change in concentration of a reactant or product per unit time:
 Rate 5 concentration of A at time t2 2 concentration of A at time t1
t2 2 t1
 5 D3A4
Dt
where A is the reactant or product being considered, and the square brackets indicate 
concentration in mol/L. As usual, the symbol D indicates a change in a given quantity. 
Note that a change can be positive (increase) or negative (decrease), thus leading to a 
positive or negative reaction rate by this definition. However, for convenience, we will 
always define the rate as a positive quantity, as we will see.
 
Now let us calculate the average rate at which the concentration of NO2 changes 
over the first 50 seconds of the reaction using the data given in Table 12.1.

Note that since the concentration of NO2 decreases with time, D[NO2] is a negative 
quantity. Because it is customary to work with positive reaction rates, we define the 
rate of this particular reaction as
Rate 5 2D3NO24
Dt
Since the concentrations of reactants always decrease with time, any rate expression 
involving a reactant will include a negative sign. The average rate of this reaction from 
0 to 50 seconds is then
 Rate 5 2D3NO24
Dt
 5 2124.2 3 1025 mol/1L # s22
 5 4.2 3 1025 mol/1L # s2
 
The average rates for this reaction during several other time intervals are given in 
Table 12.2. Note that the rate is not constant but decreases with time. The rates given 
in Table 12.2 are average rates over 50-second time intervals. The value of the rate at 
a particular time (the instantaneous rate) can be obtained by computing the slope of 
a line tangent to the curve at that point. Figure 12.1 shows a tangent drawn at t 5 100 
seconds. The slope of this line gives the rate at t 5 100 seconds as follows:

into account the coefficients in the balanced equation for the reaction, because the 
stoichiometry determines the relative rates of consumption of reactants and generation 
of products. For example, in the reaction we are considering,
2NO21 g2 h 2NO1 g2 1 O21 g2
both the reactant NO2 and the product NO have a coefficient of 2, so NO is produced 
at the same rate as NO2 is consumed. We can verify this from Fig. 12.1. Note that the 
curve for NO is the same shape as the curve for NO2, except that it is inverted, or 
flipped over. This means that, at any point in time, the slope of the tangent to the curve 
for NO will be the negative of the slope to the curve for NO2. (Verify this at the point 
t 5 100 seconds on both curves.) In the balanced equation, the product O2 has a coef-
ficient of 1, which means it is produced half as fast as NO, since NO has a coefficient 
of 2. That is, the rate of NO production is twice the rate of O2 production.
 
We also can verify this fact from Fig. 12.1. For example, at t 5 250 seconds,
 Slope of the tangent to the NO curve 5 6.0 3 1024 mol/L
70. s
 5 8.6 3 1026 mol/1L # s2
 Slope of the tangent to the O2 curve 5 3.0 3 1024 mol/L
70. s
 5 4.3 3 1026 mol/1L # s2
The slope at t 5 250 seconds on the NO curve is twice the slope of that point on the 
O2 curve, showing that the rate of production of NO is twice that of O2.
 
The rate information can be summarized as follows:
Rate of consumption 
of NO2

We have seen that the rate of a reaction is typically not constant. Most reaction rates 
change with time. This is so because the concentrations change with time (see Fig.¬†12.1).
 
Because the reaction rate changes with time, and because the rate is different (by 
factors that depend on the coefficients in the balanced equation) depending on which 
reactant or product is being studied, we must be very specific when we describe a rate 
for a chemical reaction.
 
12.2 Rate Laws: An Introduction
Chemical reactions are reversible. In our discussion of the decomposition of nitrogen 
dioxide, we have so far considered only the forward reaction, as shown here:
2NO21 g2 h 2NO1 g2 1 O21 g2
However, the reverse reaction also can occur. As NO and O2 accumulate, they can 
react to re-form NO2:
O21 g2 1 2NO1 g2 h 2NO21 g2
 
When gaseous NO2 is placed in an otherwise empty container, initially the domi-
nant reaction is
2NO21 g2 h 2NO1 g2 1 O21 g2
and the change in the concentration of NO2 (D[NO2]) depends only on the forward 
reaction. However, after a period of time, enough products accumulate so that the 
As we will see later, there is a certain type 
of rate that remains constant over time.
12.2
When forward and reverse reaction rates 
are equal, there will be no changes in the 
concentrations of reactants or products. 
This is called chemical equilibrium and is 
discussed fully in Chapter 13.
472
CHAPTER 12 Chemical Kinetics

reverse  reaction becomes important. Now D[NO2] depends on the difference in the 
rates of the forward and reverse reactions. This complication can be avoided if we 
study the rate of a reaction under conditions where the reverse reaction makes only a 
negligible contribution. Typically, this means that we must study a reaction at a point 
soon after the reactants are mixed, before the products have had time to build up to 
significant levels.
 
If we choose conditions where the reverse reaction can be neglected, the reaction 
rate will depend only on the concentrations of the reactants. For the decomposition of 
nitrogen dioxide, we can write
 
Rate 5 k3NO24n 
(12.1)
Such an expression, which shows how the rate depends on the concentrations of reac-
tants, is called a rate law. The proportionality constant k, called the rate constant, and 
n, called the order of the reactant, must both be determined by experiment. The order 
of a reactant can be an integer (including zero) or a fraction. For the relatively simple 
reactions we will consider in this book, the orders will often be positive integers.
 
Note two important points about Equation (12.1):
1. The concentrations of the products do not appear in the rate law because the reac-
tion rate is being studied under conditions where the reverse reaction does not 
contribute to the overall rate.
2. The value of the exponent n must be determined by experiment; it cannot be writ-
ten from the balanced equation.
 
Before we go further we must define exactly what we mean by the term rate in 
Equation (12.1). In Section 12.1 we saw that reaction rate means a change in concen-
tration per unit time. However, which reactant or product concentration do we choose 
in defining the rate? For example, for the decomposition of NO2 to produce O2 and NO 
considered in Section 12.1, we could define the rate in terms of any of these three spe-
cies. However, since O2 is produced only half as fast as NO, we must be careful to 
specify which species we are talking about in a given case. For instance, we might 
choose to define the reaction rate in terms of the consumption of NO2:
Rate 5 2D3NO24
Dt
5 k3NO24n
On the other hand, we could define the rate in terms of the production of O2:
Rater 5 D3O24
Dt
5 kr3NO24n
Note that because 2NO2 molecules are consumed for every O2 molecule produced,
 Rate 5 2 3 rater
or 
 k3NO24n 5 2kr3NO24n
and 
 k 5 2 3 kr
Thus the value of the rate constant depends on how the rate is defined.
 
In this text we will always be careful to define exactly what is meant by the rate for 
a given reaction so that there will be no confusion about which specific rate constant is 
being used.
Types of Rate Laws
Notice that the rate law we have used to this point expresses rate as a function of con-
centration. For example, for the decomposition of NO2 we have defined
Rate 5 2D3NO24
Dt
5 k3NO24n
Rate 5 k3NO24n
(12.1)
1.
The concentrations of the products do not appear in the rate law because the reac-
tion rate is being studied under conditions where the reverse reaction does not 
contribute to the overall rate.
2.
The value of the exponent n must be determined by experiment; it cannot be writ-
ten from the balanced equation.
473
12.2 Rate Laws: An Introduction

which tells us (once we have determined the value of n) exactly how the rate depends 
on the concentration of the reactant, NO2. A rate law that expresses how the rate 
depends on concentration is technically called the differential rate law, but it is often 
simply called the rate law. Thus when we use the term rate law in this text, we mean 
the expression that gives the rate as a function of concentration.
 
A second kind of rate law, the integrated rate law, also will be important in our 
study of kinetics. The integrated rate law expresses how the concentrations depend on 
time. Although we will not consider the details here, a given differential rate law is 
always related to a certain type of integrated rate law, and vice versa. That is, if we 
determine the differential rate law for a given reaction, we automatically know the 
form of the integrated rate law for the reaction. This means that once we determine 
experimentally either type of rate law for a reaction, we also know the other one.
 
Which rate law we choose to determine by experiment often depends on what types of 
data are easiest to collect. If we can conveniently measure how the rate changes as the 
concentrations are changed, we can readily determine the differential (rate/concentration) 
rate law. On the other hand, if it is more convenient to measure the concentration as a 
function of time, we can determine the form of the integrated (concentration/time) rate 
law. We will discuss how rate laws are actually determined in the next several sections.
 
Why are we interested in determining the rate law for a reaction? How does it help us? 
It helps us because we can work backward from the rate law to infer the steps by which 
the reaction occurs. Most chemical reactions do not take place in a single step but result 
from a series of sequential steps. To understand a chemical reaction, we must learn what 
these steps are. For example, a chemist who is designing an insecticide may study the 
reactions involved in the process of insect growth to see what type of molecule might 
interrupt this series of reactions. Or an industrial chemist may be trying to make a given 
reaction occur faster. To accomplish this, he or she must know which step is slowest, 
because it is that step that must be speeded up. Thus a chemist is usually not interested 
in a rate law for its own sake but because of what it reveals about the steps by which a 
reaction occurs. We will develop a process for finding the reaction steps in this chapter.
LET‚ÄôS REVIEW  Rate Laws: A Summary
 ¬ª There are two types of rate laws.
1. The differential rate law (often called simply the rate law) shows how the rate of a 
reaction depends on concentrations.
2. The integrated rate law shows how the concentrations of species in the reaction 
depend on time.
 ¬ª Because we typically consider reactions only under conditions where the reverse reaction is 
unimportant, our rate laws will involve only concentrations of reactants.
 ¬ª Because the differential and integrated rate laws for a given reaction are related in a well-
defined way, the experimental determination of either of the rate laws is sufficient.
 ¬ª Experimental convenience usually dictates which type of rate law is determined 
experimentally.
 ¬ª Knowing the rate law for a reaction is important mainly because we can usually infer the 
individual steps involved in the reaction from the specific form of the rate law.
12.3 Determining the Form 
of¬†the¬†Rate Law
The first step in understanding how a given chemical reaction occurs is to determine 
the form of the rate law. That is, we need to determine experimentally the power to 
which each reactant concentration must be raised in the rate law. In this section we will 
The name differential rate law comes from a 
mathematical term. We will regard it simply 
as a label. The terms differential rate law 
and rate law will be used interchangeably 
in this text.

explore ways to obtain the differential rate law for a reaction. First, we will consider 
the decomposition of dinitrogen pentoxide in carbon tetrachloride solution:
2N2O51soln2 h 4NO21soln2 1 O21 g2
Data for this reaction at 458C are listed in Table 12.3 and plotted in Fig. 12.3. In this 
reaction the oxygen gas escapes from the solution and thus does not react with the 
nitrogen dioxide, so we do not have to be concerned about the effects of the reverse 
reaction at any time over the life of the reaction. That is, the reverse reaction is negli-
gible at all times over the course of this reaction.
 
Evaluation of the reaction rates at concentrations of N2O5 of 0.90 M and 0.45 M, by 
taking the slopes of the tangents to the curve at these points (see Fig. 12.3), yields the 
following data:
[N2O5]
Rate (mol/L ? s)
0.90 M
5.4 3 1024
0.45 M
2.7 3 1024
Note that when [N2O5] is halved, the rate is also halved. This means that the rate of this 
reaction depends on the concentration of N2O5 to the first power. In other words, the 
(differential) rate law for this reaction is
Rate 5 2D3N2O54
Dt
5 k3N2O541 5 k3N2O54
Thus the reaction is first order in N2O5. Note that for this reaction the order is not the 
same as the coefficient of N2O5 in the balanced equation for the reaction. This reem-
phasizes the fact that the order of a particular reactant must be obtained by observing 
how the reaction rate depends on the concentration of that reactant.
 
We have seen that by determining the instantaneous rate at two different reactant 
concentrations, the rate law for the decomposition of N2O5 is shown to have the form
Rate 5 2D3A4
Dt
5 k3A4
where A represents N2O5.
Method of Initial Rates
One common method for experimentally determining the form of the rate law for a 
reaction is the method of initial rates. The initial rate of a reaction is the instanta-
neous rate determined just after the reaction begins (just after t 5 0). The idea is to

determine the instantaneous rate before the initial concentrations of reactants have 
changed significantly. Several experiments are carried out using different initial con-
centrations, and the initial rate is determined for each run. The results are then com-
pared to see how the initial rate depends on the initial concentrations. This allows the 
form of the rate law to be determined. We will illustrate the method of initial rates 
using the following equation:
NH4 11aq2 1 NO2 21aq2 h N21 g2 1 2H2O1 l 2
Table 12.4 gives initial rates obtained from three experiments involving different ini-
tial concentrations of reactants. The general form of the rate law for this reaction is
Rate 5 2D3NH4 14
Dt
5 k3NH4 14n3NO2 24m
We can determine the values of n and m by observing how the initial rate depends on 
the initial concentrations of NH41 and NO22. In Experiments 1 and 2, where the initial 
concentration of NH41 remains the same but the initial concentration of NO22 doubles, 
the observed initial rate also doubles. Since
Rate 5 k3NH4 14n3NO2 24m
we have for Experiment 1

We have shown that the values of n and m are both 1 and the rate law is
Rate 5 k3NH4 143NO2 24
This rate law is first order in both NO22 and NH41. Note that it is merely a coincidence 
that n and m have the same values as the coefficients of NH41 and NO22 in the bal-
anced equation for the reaction.
 
The overall reaction order is the sum of n and m. For this reaction, n 1 m 5 2. The 
reaction is second order overall.
 
The value of the rate constant k can now be calculated using the results of any of the 
three experiments shown in Table 12.4. From the data for Experiment 1, we know that

The reaction between bromate ions and bromide ions in acidic aqueous solution is 
given by the equation
BrO3 21aq2 1 5Br21aq2 1 6H11aq2 h 3Br21 l 2 1 3H2O1 l 2
Table 12.5 gives the results from four experiments. Using these data, determine the 
orders for all three reactants, the overall reaction order, and the value of the rate 
constant.
 
SOLUTION 
The general form of the rate law for this reaction is
Rate 5 k3BrO3 24n3Br24m3H14p
We can determine the values of n, m, and p by comparing the rates from the various 
experiments. To determine the value of n, we use the results from Experiments 1 and 
2, in which only [BrO32] changes:

only [Br2] changes:

The rate of this reaction is first order in BrO32 and Br2 and second order in H1. The 
overall reaction order is n 1 m 1 p 5 4.
 
The rate law can now be written
‚ñ† Rate 5 k3BrO3 243Br243H142
The value of the rate constant k can be calculated from the results of any of the four 
experiments. For Experiment 1, the initial rate is 8.0 3 1024 mol/L ? s and [BrO32] 5 
0.100 M, [Br2] 5 0.10 M, and [H1] 5 0.10 M. Using these values in the rate law gives

other experiments.

12.4 The Integrated Rate Law
The rate laws we have considered so far express the rate as a function of the reactant 
 concentrations. It is also useful to be able to express the reactant concentrations as a 
function of time, given the (differential) rate law for the reaction. In this section we 
show how this is done.
 
We will proceed by first looking at reactions involving a single reactant:
aA h products
all of which have a rate law of the form
Rate 5 2D3A4
Dt
5 k3A4n
We will develop the integrated rate laws individually for the cases n 5 1 (first  
order), n 5 2 (second order), and n 5 0 (zero order).

First-Order Rate Laws
For the reaction
2N2O51soln2 h 4NO21soln2 1 O21 g2
we have found that the rate law is
Rate 5 2D3N2O54
Dt
5 k3N2O54
Since the rate of this reaction depends on the concentration of N2O5 to the first power, 
it is a first-order reaction. This means that if the concentration of N2O5 in a flask were 
suddenly doubled, the rate of production of NO2 and O2 also would double. This rate 
law can be put into a different form using a calculus operation known as integration, 
which yields the expression
ln3N2O54 5 2kt 1 ln3N2O540
where ln indicates the natural logarithm, t is the time, [N2O5] is the concentration of 
N2O5 at time t, and [N2O5]0 is the initial concentration of N2O5 (at t 5 0, the start of the 
experiment). Note that such an equation, called the integrated rate law, expresses the 
concentration of the reactant as a function of time.
 
For a chemical reaction of the form
aA h products
where the kinetics are first order in [A], the rate law is
Rate 5 2D3A4
Dt
5 k3A4
and the integrated first-order rate law is
ln3A4 5 2kt 1 ln3A40 
(12.2)
There are several important things to note about Equation (12.2):
1.
The equation shows how the concentration of A depends on time. If the initial 
concentration of A and the rate constant k are known, the concentration of A at 
any time can be calculated.
2.
Equation (12.2) is of the form y 5 mx 1 b, where a plot of y versus x is a straight 
line with slope m and intercept b. In Equation (12.2),
y 5 ln3A4¬†¬†¬†¬†x 5 t¬†¬†¬†¬†m 5 2k¬†¬†¬†¬†b 5 ln3A40
Thus for a first-order reaction, plotting the natural logarithm of concentration 
versus time always gives a straight line. This fact is often used to test whether a 
reaction is first order. For the reaction
aA h products
the reaction is first order in A if a plot of ln[A] versus t is a straight line. Con-
versely, if this plot is not a straight line, the reaction is not first order in A.
3.
This integrated rate law for a first-order reaction also can be expressed in terms 
of a ratio of [A] and [A]0 as follows:
ln a
3A40
3A4 b 5 kt
Appendix 1.2 contains a review of 
logarithms.
ln3A4 5 2kt 1 ln3A40
(12.2)
An integrated rate law relates 
concentration to reaction time.
For a first-order reaction, a plot of ln[A] 
versus t is always a straight line.
1.
The equation shows how the concentration of A depends on time. If the initial 
concentration of A and the rate constant k are known, the concentration of A at
k
any time can be calculated.
2.
Equation (12.2) is of the form y 5 mx 1 b, where a plot of y versus x is a straight

y 5 ln3A4
x 5 t
m 5 2k
b 5 ln3A40
Thus for a first-order reaction, plotting the natural logarithm of concentration
versus time always gives a straight line. This fact is often used to test whether a
reaction is first order. For the reaction
aA h products
the reaction is first order in A if a plot of ln[A] versus t is a straight line. Con-
versely, if this plot is not a straight line, the reaction is not first order in A.

The values of ln[N2O5] at various times are given in the table above and shown in the

order in N2O5, since it follows the equation ln[N2O5] 5 2kt 1 ln[N2O5]0.

First-Order Rate Laws II
Using the data given in Example 12.2, calculate [N2O5] at 150 s after the start of the 
 reaction.
 
SOLUTION 
We know from Example 12.2 that [N2O5] 5 0.0500 mol/L at 100 s and [N2O5] 5 
0.0250¬†mol/L at 200 s. Since 150 s is halfway between 100 and 200 s, it is tempting to 
assume that we can simply use an arithmetic average to obtain [N2O5] at that time. This 
is inco rrect  because it is ln[N2O5], not [N2O5], that is directly proportional to t. To 
calculate [N2O5]  after 150 s, we use Equation (12.2):
ln3N2O54 5 2kt 1 ln3N2O540
where t 5 150. s, k 5 6.93 3 1023 s21 (as determined in Example 12.2), and [N2O5]0¬†5

Note that this value of [N2O5] is not halfway between 0.0500 and 0.0250 mol/L.
See Exercise 12.39
Half-Life of a First-Order Reaction
The time required for a reactant to reach half its original concentration is called the 
half-life of a reactant and is designated by the symbol t1y2. For example, we can cal-
culate the half-life of the decomposition reaction discussed in Example 12.2. The data 
plotted in Fig. 12.4 show that the half-life for this reaction is 100 seconds. We can see 
this by considering the following numbers:

(12.3)
This is the general equation for the half-life of a first-order reaction. Equation (12.3) 
can be used to calculate t1y2 if k is known or k if t1y2 is known. Note that for a first-order 
reaction, the half-life does not depend on concentration. That is, the half-life for a first-
order reaction is constant. We will see this is not the case for second-order and zero-
order reactions.

‚ñ† Thus it takes 40. minutes for this particular reaction to reach 75% completion.
 
Let‚Äôs consider another way of solving this problem using the definition of half-life. 
After one half-life the reaction has gone 50% to completion. If the initial concentration 
were 1.0 mol/L, after one half-life the concentration would be 0.50 mol/L. One more 
half-life would produce a concentration of 0.25 mol/L. Comparing 0.25 mol/L with the 
original 1.0 mol/L shows that 25% of the reactant is left after two half-lives. This is a 
general result. (What percentage of reactant remains after three half-lives?) Two half-
lives for this reaction is 2(20.0 min), or 40.0 min, which agrees with the preceding 
answer.
See Exercises 12.40 and 12.51 through 12.54

The resulting plots are shown in Fig. 12.5. Since the ln[C4H6] versus t plot 
[Fig. 12.5(a)] is not a straight line, the reaction is not first order. 
‚ñ† The reaction is, however, second order, as shown by the linearity of the 
1y[C4H6] versus t plot [Fig. 12.5(b)]. Thus we can now write the rate law for this 
second-order reaction:

12.4 The Integrated Rate Law

It is important to recognize the difference between the half-life for a first-order 
reaction and the half-life for a second-order reaction. For a second-order reaction, 
t1y2 depends on both k and [A]0; for a first-order reaction, t1y2 depends only on k.  
For a first-order reaction, a constant time is required to reduce the concentration of  
the reactant by half, and then by half again, and so on, as the reaction proceeds. From 
Example¬†12.5 we can see that this is not true for a second-order reaction. For that 
second-order reaction, we found that the first half-life (the time required to go from 
[C4H6] 5 0.010¬†M to [C4H6] 5 0.0050 M) is 1630 seconds. We can estimate the second 
half-life from the concentration data as a function of time. Note that to reach 0.0024 M 
C4H6 (approximately 0.0050y2) requires 5200 seconds of reaction time. Thus to  
get from 0.0050 M C4H6 to 0.0024 M C4H6 takes 3570 seconds (5200 2 1630).  
The second half-life is much longer than the first. This pattern is characteristic  
of second-order reactions. In fact, for a second-order reaction, each successive half-
life is double the preceding one (provided the effects of the reverse reaction can be 
ignored, as we are assuming here). Prove this to yourself by examining the equation 
t1y2 5 1y(k[A]0).
Zero-Order Rate Laws
Most reactions involving a single reactant show either first-order or second-order 
kinetics. However, sometimes such a reaction can be a zero-order reaction. The rate 
law for a zero-order reaction is
Rate 5 k3A40 5 k112 5 k
For a zero-order reaction, the rate is constant. It does not change with concentration as 
it does for first-order or second-order reactions.
 
The integrated rate law for a zero-order reaction is
 
3A4 5 2kt 1 3A40 
(12.7)
In this case a plot of [A] versus t gives a straight line of slope 2k (Fig.¬†12.6).
 
The expression for the half-life of a zero-order reaction can be obtained from the 
 integrated rate law. By definition, [A] 5 [A]0y2 when t 5 t1y2, so

5 2kt1/2 1 3A40
or 
kt1/2 5 3A40
2
Solving for t1y2 gives
 
t1/2 5 3A40
2k  
(12.8)
 
Zero-order reactions are most often encountered when a substance such as a metal 
surface or an enzyme is required for the reaction to occur. For example, the decompo-
sition reaction
2N2O1 g2 h 2N21 g2 1 O21 g2
occurs on a hot platinum surface. When the platinum surface is completely covered 
with N2O molecules, an increase in the concentration of N2O has no effect on the rate, 
since only those N2O molecules on the surface can react. Under these conditions, the 
rate is a constant because it is controlled by what happens on the platinum surface 
rather than by the total concentration of N2O (Fig. 12.7). This reaction also can occur 
at high temperatures with no platinum surface present, but under these conditions, it is 
not zero order.
For a second-order reaction, t1y2 is 
dependent on [A]0. For a first-order 
reaction, t1y2 is independent of [A]0.
For each successive half-life, [A]0 is halved. 
Since t1y2 5 1yk[A]0, t1y2 doubles.
A zero-order reaction has a constant rate.

CRITICAL THINKING Consider the simple reaction  
aA n products. You run this reaction and wish to determine its order. What if 
you made a graph of reaction rate versus time? Could you use this to determine 
the order? Sketch three plots of rate versus time for the reaction if it is zero, 
first, or second order. Sketch these plots on the same graph and compare them. 
Defend your answer.
Integrated Rate Laws for Reactions 
with¬†More Than One Reactant
So far we have considered the integrated rate laws for simple reactions with only one 
reactant. Special techniques are required to deal with more complicated reactions. 
Let‚Äôs consider the reaction
BrO3 21aq2 1 5Br21aq2 1 6H11aq2 h 3Br21 l 2 1 3H2O1 l 2
From experimental evidence we know that the rate law is
Rate 5 2D3BrO3 24
Dt
5 k3BrO3 243Br243H142
 
Suppose we run this reaction under conditions where [BrO32]0 5 1.0 3 1023 M, 
[Br2]0 5 1.0 M, and [H1]0 5 1.0 M. As the reaction proceeds, [BrO32] decreases sig-
nificantly, but because the Br2 ion and H1 ion concentrations are so large initially, 
relatively little of these two reactants is consumed. Thus [Br2] and [H1] remain 
approximately constant. In other words, under the conditions where the Br2 ion and 
H1 ion concentrations are much larger than the BrO32 ion concentration, we can 
assume that throughout the reaction
3Br24 5 3Br240¬†¬†and¬†¬†3H14 5 3H140
This means that the rate law can be written
Rate 5 k3Br2403H140 23BrO3 24 5 kr3BrO3 24
where, since [Br2]0 and [H1]0 are constant,
kr 5 k3Br2403H140 2

the same in both cases because the plat-
inum surface can accommodate only a 
certain number of molecules. As a result, 
this reaction is zero order.

is first order. However, since this law was obtained by simplifying a more complicated 
one, it is called a pseudo-first-order rate law. Under the conditions of this experiment, 
a plot of ln[BrO32] versus t will give a straight line where the slope is equal to 2k9. 
Since [Br2]0 and [H1]0 are known, the value of k can be calculated from the equation
kr 5 k3Br2403H140 2
which can be rearranged to give
k 5
kr
3Br2403H140 2
 
Note that the kinetics of complicated reactions can be studied by observing the 
behavior of one reactant at a time. If the concentration of one reactant is much smaller 
than the concentrations of the others, then the amounts of those reactants present in 
large concentrations will not change significantly and can be regarded as constant. The 
change in concentration with time of the reactant present in a relatively small amount 
can then be used to determine the order of the reaction in that component. This tech-
nique allows us to determine rate laws for complex reactions.
LET‚ÄôS REVIEW  Rate Laws: A Summary
1. To simplify the rate laws for reactions, we have always assumed that the rate is being 
studied under conditions where only the forward reaction is important. This produces 
rate laws that contain only reactant concentrations.
2. There are two types of rate laws.
a. The differential rate law (often called the rate law) shows how the rate depends 
on¬†the concentrations. The forms of the rate laws for zero-order, first-order, and 
second-order kinetics of reactions with single reactants are shown in ¬†Table 12.6.
b. The integrated rate law shows how concentration depends on time. The integrated 
rate laws corresponding to zero-order, first-order, and second-order kinetics of 
one-reactant reactions are given in Table 12.6.
3. Whether we determine the differential rate law or the integrated rate law depends on 
the type of data that can be collected conveniently and accurately. Once we have experi-
mentally determined either type of rate law, we can write the other for a given reaction.
4. The most common method for experimentally determining the differential rate law is 
the method of initial rates. In this method several experiments are run at different 
initial concentrations and the instantaneous rates are determined for each at the same 
value of t (as close to t 5 0 as possible). The point is to evaluate the rate before the 
concentrations change significantly from the initial values. From a comparison of the 
initial rates and the initial concentrations, the dependence of the rate on the concen-
trations of various reactants can be obtained‚Äîthat is, the order in each reactant can 
be determined.
5. To experimentally determine the integrated rate law for a reaction, concentrations are 
measured at various values of t as the reaction proceeds. Then the job is to see which 
integrated rate law correctly fits the data. Typically this is done visually by ascertaining 
which type of plot gives a straight line. A summary for one-reactant reactions is given 
in Table 12.6. Once the correct straight-line plot is found, the correct integrated rate 
law can be chosen and the value of k obtained from the slope. Also, the differential 
rate law for the reaction can then be written.
6. The integrated rate law for a reaction that involves several reactants can be treated by 
choosing conditions such that the concentration of only one reactant varies in a given 
experiment. This is done by having the concentration of one reactant remain small 
compared with the concentrations of all the others, causing a rate law such as

where k9 5 k[B]0m[C]0p and [B]0 @ [A]0 and [C]0 @ [A]0. The value of n is obtained by 
determining whether a plot of [A] versus t is linear (n 5 0), a plot of ln[A] versus t is 
linear (n 5 1), or a plot of 1y[A] versus t is linear (n 5 2). The value of k9 is determined 
from the slope of the appropriate plot. The values of m, p, and k can be found by 
determining the value of k9 at several different concentrations of B and C.

12.5 Reaction Mechanisms
Most chemical reactions occur by a series of steps called the reaction mechanism. To 
understand a reaction, we must know its mechanism, and one of the main purposes for 
studying kinetics is to learn as much as possible about the steps involved in a reaction. In 
this section we explore some of the fundamental characteristics of reaction mechanisms.
Consider the reaction between nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide:
NO21 g2 1 CO1 g2 h NO1 g2 1 CO21 g2
The rate law for this reaction is known from experiment to be
Rate 5 k3NO242
As we will see, this reaction is more complicated than it appears from the balanced 
equation. This is quite typical; the balanced equation for a reaction tells us the reac-
tants, the products, and the stoichiometry but gives no direct information about the 
reaction mechanism.
For the reaction between nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide, the mechanism is 
thought to involve the following steps:
 NO21 g2 1 NO21 g2 h
k1
NO31 g2 1 NO1 g2
 NO31 g2 1 CO1 g2 h
k2
NO21 g2 1 CO21 g2
where k1 and k2 are the rate constants of the individual reactions. In this mechanism, 
gaseous NO3 is an intermediate, a species that is neither a reactant nor a product but 
that is formed and consumed during the reaction sequence. This reaction is illustrated 
in Fig.¬†12.8.
12.5
A balanced equation does not tell us how 
the reactants become products.
An intermediate is formed in one step and 
used up in a subsequent step and so is 
never seen as a product.
489
12.5 Reaction Mechanisms

Each of these two reactions is called an elementary step, a reaction whose rate law 
can be written from its molecularity. Molecularity is defined as the number of species 
that must collide to produce the reaction indicated by that step. A reaction involving one 
molecule is called a unimolecular step. Reactions involving the collision of two and 
three species are termed bimolecular and termolecular, respectively. Termolecular 
steps are quite rare, because the probability of three molecules colliding simultaneously 
is very small. Examples of these three types of elementary steps and the corresponding 
rate laws are shown in Table 12.7. Note from Table 12.7 that the rate law for an elemen-
tary step follows directly from the molecularity of that step. For example, for a bimo-
lecular step the rate law is always second order, either of the form k[A]2 for a step with 
a single reactant or of the form k[A][B] for a step involving two reactants.
 
We can now define a reaction mechanism more precisely. It is a series of elementary 
steps that must satisfy two requirements:
1. The sum of the elementary steps must give the overall balanced equation for the 
 reaction.
2. The mechanism must agree with the experimentally determined rate law.
 
To see how these requirements are applied, we will consider the mechanism given 
above for the reaction of nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide. First, note that the 
sum of the two steps gives the overall balanced equation:
 NO21 g2 1 NO21 g2 h NO31 g2 1 NO1 g2
 NO31 g2 1 CO1 g2 h NO21 g2 1 CO21 g2
 NO21g2 1 NO21 g2 1 NO31 g2 1 CO1 g2 h NO31 g2 1 NO1 g2 1 NO21 g2 1 CO21 g2
 Overall r eaction:¬†¬†NO21 g2 1 CO1 g2 h NO1 g2 1 CO21 g2
The first requirement for a correct mechanism is met. To see whether the mechanism 
meets the second requirement, we need to introduce a new idea: the rate-determining 
step. Multistep reactions often have one step that is much slower than all the others. 
Reactants can become products only as fast as they can get through this slowest step. 
That is, the overall reaction can be no faster than the slowest, or rate-determining, step 
The prefix uni- means one, bi- means two, 
and ter- means three.
A unimolecular elementary step is always 
first order, a bimolecular step is always 
second order, and so on.
We can now define a reaction mechanism more precisely. It is a series of elementary 
steps that must satisfy two requirements:
1.
The sum of the elementary steps must give the overall balanced equation for the
reaction.
2.
The mechanism must agree with the experimentally determined rate law.
A reaction is only as fast as its slowest step.

in the sequence. An analogy for this situation is the pouring of water rapidly into a 
container through a funnel. The water collects in the container at a rate that is essen-
tially determined by the size of the funnel opening and not by the rate of pouring.
 
Which is the rate-determining step in the reaction of nitrogen dioxide and carbon 
monoxide? Let‚Äôs assume that the first step is rate-determining and the second step is 
 relatively fast:
 
 NO21 g2 1 NO21 g2 h NO31 g2 1 NO1 g2     Slow 1rate-determining2
 
 NO31 g2 1 CO1 g2 h NO21 g2 1 CO21 g2    Fast
What we have really assumed here is that the formation of NO3 occurs much more 
slowly than its reaction with CO. The rate of CO2 production is then controlled by the 
rate of formation of NO3 in the first step. Since this is an elementary step, we can write 
the rate law from the molecularity. The bimolecular first step has the rate law
Rate of formation of NO3 5 D3NO34
Dt
5 k13NO242
Since the overall reaction rate can be no faster than the slowest step,
Overall rate 5 k13NO242
Note that this rate law agrees with the experimentally determined rate law given ear-
lier. The mechanism we assumed above satisfies the two requirements stated earlier 
and may be the correct mechanism for the reaction.
 
How does a chemist deduce the mechanism for a given reaction? The rate law is 
always determined first. Then, using chemical intuition and following the two rules 
given on the previous page, the chemist constructs possible mechanisms and tries, with 
further experiments, to eliminate those that are least likely. A mechanism can never be 
proved absolutely. We can say only that a mechanism that satisfies the two require-
ments is possibly correct. Deducing mechanisms for chemical reactions can be diffi-
cult and requires skill and experience. We will only touch on this process in this text.
Reaction Mechanisms
The balanced equation for the reaction of the gases nitrogen dioxide and fluorine is
2NO21 g2 1 F21 g2 h 2NO2F1 g2
The experimentally determined rate law is
Rate 5 k3NO243F24
A suggested mechanism for this reaction is
 NO2 1 F2 h
k1
NO2F 1 F    Slow
 F 1 NO2 h
k2
NO2F
    Fast
Is this an acceptable mechanism? That is, does it satisfy the two requirements?
 
SOLUTION 
The first requirement for an acceptable mechanism is that the sum of the steps should give 
the balanced equation:
 NO2 1 F2 h NO2F 1 F
 F 1 NO2 h NO2F
 2NO2 1 F2 1 F h 2NO2F 1 F
 Overall r eaction:¬†¬†¬†¬†2NO2 1 F2 h 2NO2F
The first requirement is met.

The second requirement is that the mechanism must agree with the ex perimentally 
determined rate law. Since the proposed mechanism states that the first step is rate-
determining, the overall reaction rate must be that of the first step. The first step is 
bimolecular, so the rate law is
Rate 5 k13NO243F24
This has the same form as the experimentally determined rate law. The proposed 
mechanism is acceptable because it satisfies both requirements. (Note that we have not 
proved that it is the correct mechanism.)
See Exercises 12.63 and 12.64
 
Although the mechanism given in Example 12.6 has the correct stoichiometry and 
fits the observed rate law, other mechanisms may also satisfy these requirements. For 
example, the mechanism might be
 NO2 1 F2 h NOF2 1 O
    Slow
 NO2 1 O h NO3
    Fast
 NOF2 1 NO2 h NO2F 1 NOF    Fast
 NO3 1 NOF h NO2F 1 NO2     Fast
To decide on the most probable mechanism for the reaction, the chemist doing the 
study would have to perform additional experiments.
Mechanisms with Fast Forward 
and Reverse First Steps
A common type of reaction mechanism is one involving a first step in which both the 
forward and reverse reactions are very fast compared with the reactions in the second 
step. An example of this type of mechanism is that for the decomposition of ozone to 
oxygen. The balanced reaction is
2O3(g) n 3O2(g)
The observed rate law is
Rate 5 k3O342
3O24  
Note that this rate law is unusual in that it contains the concentration of a product. The 
mechanism proposed for this process is
O3 34 O2 1 O
O 1 O3 88n 2O2
The double arrows in the first step indicate that both the forward and reverse reactions 
are important. They have the rate constants k1 and k21, respectively.
 
For this mechanism we will assume that both the forward and reverse reactions of 
the first step are very fast compared with the reaction in the second step. This means 
that the second step is rate determining. Therefore, the rate for the overall reaction is 
equal to the rate of the second step:
Rate 5 k2[O][O3]
k1
k21
k2
The second step is relatively slow  
because of the very small concentration  
of O3 molecules.

This rate law does not have the same form as the experimentally determined rate 
law. For one thing, it contains the concentration of the intermediate, an oxygen atom. 
We can remove [O] and obtain a rate law that agrees with the experiment results by 
making an additional assumption. We assume that the rates of the forward and reverse 
reactions in the first step are equal. That is, we assume that the initial reversible fast 
step is at equilibrium (We will discuss the concept of chemical equilibrium in more 
detail in Chapter 13.). This makes sense because the rates of both the forward and 
reverse reactions for the first step are so much faster than the rate of the second step. 
For the first step,
Rate of forward reaction 5 k1[O3]
and 
Rate of reverse reaction 5 k21[O2][O]
Because the rates of the forward and reverse reactions in the first step are equal we 
have
k1[O3] 5 k21[O2][O]
We solve for [O]:
3O4 5 k13O34
k213O24
Now we substitute the expression for [O] into the rate law for the second step:
 Rate 5 k23O243O34 5 k2a k13O34
k213O24b 3O34 5 k2k13O342
k213O24
 5 k3O342
3O24
where k is a composite constant representing k2k1yk21.
 
This rate law, derived by postulating the two elementary steps and making assump-
tions about the relative rates of these steps, agrees with the experimental rate law. 
Since this mechanism (the elementary steps plus the assumptions) also gives the cor-
rect overall stoichiometry, it is an acceptable mechanism for the decomposition of 
ozone to oxygen.
Reaction Mechanisms II
The gas-phase reaction of chlorine with chloroform is described by the equation
Cl2(g) 1 CHCl3(g) 88n HCl(g) 1 CCl4(g)
The rate law determined from experiment has a noninteger order:
Rate 5 k[Cl2]1/2[CHCl3]
A proposed mechanism for this reaction follows:
 
Cl2(g) 3:4 2Cl(g) 
 Both fast with equal rates  
(fast equilibrium)
 
Cl(g) 1 CHCl3(g) 88n HCl(g) 1 CCl3(g) 
Slow
 
CCl3(g) 1 Cl(g) 88n CCl4(g) 
Fast
Is this an acceptable mechanism for the reaction?

SOLUTION 
Two questions must be answered. First, does the mechanism give the correct overall stoi-
chiometry? Adding the three steps does yield the correct balanced equation:
 Cl21g2 m 2Cl1g2
 Cl1g2 1 CHCl31g2 h HCl1g2 1 CCl31g2
 CCl31g2 1 Cl1g2 h CCl41g2
 Cl21g2 1 Cl1g2 1 CHCl31g2 1 CCl31g2 1 Cl1g2 h 2Cl1g2 1 HCl1g2 1 CCl31g2 1 CCl41g2
 Overall r eaction:¬†¬†Cl21g2 1 CHCl31g2 h HCl1g2 1 CCl41g2
 
Second, does the mechanism agree with the observed rate law? Since the overall 
reaction rate is determined by the rate of the slowest step,
Overall rate 5 rate of second step 5 k2[Cl][CHCl3]
Since the chlorine atom is an intermediate, we must find a way to eliminate [Cl] in the 
rate law. This can be done by recognizing that since the first step is at equilibrium, its 
forward and reverse rates are equal:
k1[Cl2] 5 k21[Cl]2
Solving for [Cl]2 gives
3Cl42 5 k13Cl24
k21

12.6 A Model for Chemical Kinetics
How do chemical reactions occur? We already have given some indications. For exam-
ple, we have seen that the rates of chemical reactions depend on the concentrations of 
the reacting species. The initial rate for the reaction
aA 1 bB h products
can be described by the rate law
Rate 5 k3A4n3B4m
where the order of each reactant depends on the detailed reaction mechanism. This 
explains why reaction rates depend on concentration. But what about some of the other 
factors affecting reaction rates? For example, how does temperature affect the speed of 
a reaction?
 
We can answer this question qualitatively from our experience. We have refrigera-
tors because food spoilage is retarded at low temperatures. The combustion of wood

occurs at a measurable rate only at high temperatures. An egg cooks in boiling water 
much faster at sea level than in Leadville, Colorado (elevation 10,000 ft), where the 
boiling point of water is approximately 908C. These observations and others lead us to 
conclude that chemical reactions speed up when the temperature is increased. Experi-
ments have shown that virtually all rate constants show an exponential increase with 
absolute temperature, as represented in Fig. 12.9.
 
In this section we discuss a model used to account for the observed characteristics of 
reaction rates. This model, called the collision model, is built around the central idea 
that molecules must collide to react. We have already seen how this assumption explains 
the concentration dependence of reaction rates. Now we need to consider whether this 
model can account for the observed temperature dependence of reaction rates.
 
The kinetic molecular theory of gases predicts that an increase in temperature raises 
molecular velocities and so increases the frequency of collisions between molecules. 
This idea agrees with the observation that reaction rates are greater at higher tempera-
tures. Thus there is qualitative agreement between the collision model and experimen-
tal observations. However, it is found that the rate of reaction is much smaller than the 
calculated collision frequency in a collection of gas particles. This must mean that only 
a small fraction of the collisions produces a reaction. Why?
 
This question was first addressed in the 1880s by Svante Arrhenius. He proposed 
the existence of a threshold energy, called the activation energy, that must be over-
come to produce a chemical reaction. Such a proposal makes sense, as we can see by 
considering the decomposition of BrNO in the gas phase:
2BrNO1 g2 h 2NO1 g2 1 Br21 g2
In this reaction two BrON bonds must be broken and one BrOBr bond must be 
formed. Breaking a BrON bond requires considerable energy (243 kJ/mol), which 
must come from somewhere. The collision model postulates that the energy comes 
from the kinetic energies possessed by the reacting molecules before the collision. 
This kinetic energy is changed into potential energy as the molecules are distorted dur-
ing a collision to break bonds and rearrange the atoms into the product molecules.
 
We can envision the reaction progress as shown in Fig. 12.10. The arrangement of 
atoms found at the top of the potential energy ‚Äúhill,‚Äù or barrier, is called the activated 
complex, or transition state. The conversion of BrNO to NO and Br2 is exothermic,

as indicated by the fact that the products have lower potential energy than the reactant. 
However, DE has no effect on the rate of the reaction. Rather, the rate depends on the 
size of the activation energy Ea.
 
The main point here is that a certain minimum energy is required for two BrNO 
molecules to ‚Äúget over the hill‚Äù so that products can form. This energy is furnished by 
the energy of the collision. A collision between two BrNO molecules with small 
kinetic energies will not have enough energy to get over the barrier. At a given tem-
perature only a certain fraction of the collisions possesses enough energy to be effec-
tive (to result in product formation).
 
We can be more precise by recalling from Chapter 5 that a distribution of velocities 
exists in a sample of gas molecules. Therefore, a distribution of collision energies also 
exists, as shown in Fig. 12.11 for two different temperatures. Figure 12.11 also shows 
the activation energy for the reaction in question. Only collisions with energy greater 
than the activation energy are able to react (get over the barrier). At the lower tempera-
ture, T1, the fraction of effective collisions is quite small. However, as the temperature 
is increased to T2, the fraction of collisions with the required activation energy increases 
dramatically. When the temperature is doubled, the fraction of effective collisions 
much more than doubles. In fact, the fraction of effective collisions increases exponen-
tially with temperature. This is encouraging for our theory; remember that rates of 
reactions are observed to increase exponentially with temperature. Arrhenius postu-
lated that the number of collisions having an energy greater than or equal to the activa-
tion energy is given by the expression:
Number of collisions with the activation energy 5 1total number of collisions2e2Ea/RT
where Ea is the activation energy, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the Kelvin 
temperature. The factor e2Ea /RT represents the fraction of collisions with energy Ea or 
greater at temperature T.
 
We have seen that not all molecular collisions are effective in producing chemical 
reactions because a minimum energy is required for the reaction to occur. There is, 
however, another complication. Experiments show that the observed reaction rate is 
considerably smaller than the rate of collisions with enough energy to surmount the 
barrier. This means that many collisions, even though they have the required energy, 
still do not produce a reaction. Why not?
 
The answer lies in the molecular orientations during collisions. We can illustrate 
this using the reaction between two BrNO molecules (Fig. 12.12). Some collision 
orientations can lead to reaction, and others cannot. Therefore, we must include a cor-
rection factor to allow for collisions with nonproductive molecular orientations.
 
To summarize, two requirements must be satisfied for reactants to collide success-
fully (to rearrange to form products):
1. The collision must involve enough energy to produce the reaction; that is, the 
collision energy must equal or exceed the activation energy.
2. The relative orientation of the reactants must allow formation of any new bonds 
necessary to produce products.
 
Taking these factors into account, we can represent the rate constant as
k 5 zpe2Ea /RT
where z is the collision frequency, p is called the steric factor (always less than 1) and 
reflects the fraction of collisions with effective orientations, and e2Ea /RT represents the 
fraction of collisions with sufficient energy to produce a reaction. This expression is 
most often written in form
 
k 5 Ae2Ea /RT 
(12.9)
which is called the Arrhenius equation. In this equation, A replaces zp and is called 
the frequency factor for the reaction.
The higher the activation energy, the 
slower the reaction at a given temperature.
To summarize, two requirements must be satisfied for reactants to collide success-
fully (to rearrange to form products):
1.
The collision must involve enough energy to produce the reaction; that is, the
collision energy must equal or exceed the activation energy.
2.
The relative orientation of the reactants must allow formation of any new bonds
necessary to produce products.

Arrhenius equation to a good approximation indicates that the collision model for 
chemical reactions is physically reasonable.

The most common procedure for finding Ea for a reaction involves measuring the 
rate constant k at several temperatures and then plotting ln(k) versus 1yT, as shown in 
Example 12.8. However, Ea also can be calculated from the values of k at only two 
 temperatures by using a formula that can be derived as follows from Equation (12.10).

We have seen that we can increase the rate of a reaction by increasing the concentra-
tions of one or more of the reactants and/or by increasing the temperature. Both of these 
observations can be explained by the collision model, which states that molecules must 
collide in order to react. It turns out that we can also increase the rate of a reaction 
involving a solid by increasing the surface area of one or more of the solid reactants. 
Thus, for example, wood chips burn more quickly in air than a large log does. This is 
also explained with the collision model because a larger surface area means that more 
of the reactant molecules are in contact with one another. Another way to speed up the 
rate of a reaction is by means of catalysis, which we will discuss in the next section.
12.7 Catalysis
We have seen that the rate of a reaction increases dramatically with temperature. If a 
particular reaction does not occur fast enough at normal temperatures, we can speed it 
up by raising the temperature. However, sometimes this is not feasible. For example, 
living cells can survive only in a rather narrow temperature range, and the human body 
is designed to operate at an almost constant temperature of 98.68F. But many of the 
complicated  biochemical reactions keeping us alive would be much too slow at this 
temperature without intervention. We exist only because the body contains many sub-
stances called  enzymes, which increase the rates of these reactions. In fact, almost 
every biologically important reaction is assisted by a specific enzyme.
Although it is possible to use higher temperatures to speed up commercially impor-
tant reactions, such as the Haber process for synthesizing ammonia, this is very expen-
sive. In a chemical plant an increase in temperature means significantly increased costs 
for energy. The use of an appropriate catalyst allows a reaction to proceed rapidly at a 
relatively low temperature and can therefore hold down production costs.
A catalyst is a substance that speeds up a reaction without being consumed itself. 
Just as virtually all vital biologic reactions are assisted by enzymes (biologic cata-
lysts), almost all industrial processes also involve the use of catalysts. For example, the 
production of sulfuric acid uses vanadium(V) oxide, and the Haber process uses a 
mixture of iron and iron oxide.
How does a catalyst work? Remember that for each reaction a certain energy barrier 
must be surmounted. How can we make a reaction occur faster without raising the 
temperature to increase the molecular energies? The solution is to provide a new path-
way for the reaction, one with a lower activation energy. This is what a catalyst does, 
as is shown in Fig. 12.13. Because the catalyst allows the reaction to occur with a 
lower activation energy, a much larger fraction of collisions is effective at a given tem-
perature, and the reaction rate is increased. This effect is illustrated in Fig. 12.14. Note 
from this diagram that although a catalyst lowers the activation energy Ea for a reac-
tion, it does not affect the energy difference DE between products and reactants.
 
Catalysts are classified as homogeneous or heterogeneous. A homogeneous cata-
lyst is one that is present in the same phase as the reacting molecules. A heteroge-
neous  catalyst exists in a different phase, usually as a solid.

This allows reactants to become products 
at a much higher rate, even though there 
is no temperature increase.

Heterogeneous Catalysis
Heterogeneous catalysis most often involves gaseous reactants being adsorbed on the 
surface of a solid catalyst. Adsorption refers to the collection of one substance on the 
surface of another substance; absorption refers to the penetration of one substance into 
another. Water is absorbed by a sponge.
An important example of heterogeneous catalysis occurs in the hydrogenation of 
unsaturated hydrocarbons, compounds composed mainly of carbon and hydrogen with 
some carbon‚Äìcarbon double bonds. Hydrogenation is an important industrial process 
used to change unsaturated fats, occurring as oils, to saturated fats (solid shortenings 
such as Crisco) in which the CPC bonds have been converted to COC bonds through 
addition of hydrogen.
A simple example of hydrogenation involves ethylene:

This reaction is quite slow at normal temperatures, mainly because the strong bond in 
the hydrogen molecule results in a large activation energy for the reaction. However, 
the reaction rate can be greatly increased by using a solid catalyst of platinum, palla-
dium, or nickel. The hydrogen and ethylene adsorb on the catalyst surface, where the 
reaction occurs. The main function of the catalyst apparently is to allow formation of 
metal‚Äìhydrogen interactions that weaken the HOH bonds and facilitate the reaction. 
The mechanism is  illustrated in Fig. 12.15.
LET‚ÄôS REVIEW  Heterogeneous Catalysis
Typically, heterogeneous catalysis involves four steps:
1. Adsorption and activation of the reactants
2. Migration of the adsorbed reactants on the surface
3. Reaction of the adsorbed substances
4. Escape, or desorption, of the products
Heterogeneous catalysis also occurs in the oxidation of gaseous sulfur dioxide to 
gaseous sulfur trioxide. This process is especially interesting because it illustrates both 
positive and negative consequences of chemical catalysis.
The negative side is the formation of damaging air pollutants. Recall that sulfur 
dioxide, a toxic gas with a choking odor, is formed whenever sulfur-containing fuels 
are burned. However, it is sulfur trioxide that causes most of the environmental dam-
age, mainly through the production of acid rain. When sulfur trioxide combines with a 
droplet of  water, sulfuric acid is formed:
H2O1 l 2 1 SO31 g2 h H2SO41aq2
This sulfuric acid can cause considerable damage to vegetation, buildings and statues, 
and fish populations.
Sulfur dioxide is not rapidly oxidized to sulfur trioxide in clean, dry air. Why, then, 
is there a problem? The answer is catalysis. Dust particles and water droplets catalyze 
the reaction between SO2 and O2 in the air.
 
On the positive side, the heterogeneous catalysis of the oxidation of SO2 is used to 
advantage in the manufacture of sulfuric acid, where the reaction of O2 and SO2 to 
form SO3 is catalyzed by a solid mixture of platinum and vanadium(V) oxide.
 
Heterogeneous catalysis is also utilized in the catalytic converters in automobile 
exhaust systems. The exhaust gases, containing compounds such as nitric oxide, carbon

monoxide, and unburned hydrocarbons, are passed through a converter containing 
beads of solid catalyst (Fig. 12.16). The catalyst promotes the conversion of carbon 
monoxide to carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide and water, and nitric 
oxide to nitrogen gas to lessen the environmental impact of the exhaust gases. However, 
this beneficial catalysis can, unfortunately, be accompanied by the unwanted catalysis 
of the oxidation of SO2 to SO3, which reacts with the moisture present to form sulfuric 
acid.
 
Because of the complex nature of the reactions that take place in the converter, a 
mixture of catalysts is used. The most effective catalytic materials are transition metal 
oxides and noble metals such as palladium and platinum.
Homogeneous Catalysis
A homogeneous catalyst exists in the same phase as the reacting molecules. There are 
many examples in both the gas and liquid phases. One such example is the unusual 
 catalytic behavior of nitric oxide toward ozone. In the troposphere, that part of the 
atmosphere closest to earth, nitric oxide catalyzes ozone production. However, in the 
upper atmosphere it catalyzes the decomposition of ozone. Both these effects are 
unfortunate environmentally.
 
In the lower atmosphere, NO is produced in any high-temperature combustion pro-
cess where N2 is present. The reaction
N21 g2 1 O21 g2 h 2NO1 g2
is very slow at normal temperatures because of the very strong NqN and OPO bonds. 
However, at elevated temperatures, such as those found in the internal combustion 
engines of automobiles, significant quantities of NO form. Some of this NO is con-
verted back to N2 in the catalytic converter, but significant amounts escape into the 
atmosphere to react with oxygen:
2NO1 g2 1 O21 g2 h 2NO21 g2
In the atmosphere, NO2 can absorb light and decompose as follows:
NO21 g2 h
Light
NO1 g2 1 O1 g2
The oxygen atom is very reactive and can combine with an oxygen molecule to form 
ozone:
O21 g2 1 O1 g2 h O31 g2
Ozone is a powerful oxidizing agent that can react with other air pollutants to form 
substances irritating to the eyes and lungs, and is itself very toxic.
Although O2 is represented here as the 
oxidizing agent for NO, the actual oxidizing 
agent is probably some type of peroxide 
compound produced by reaction of 
oxygen with pollutants. The direct reaction 
of NO and O2 is very slow.

Nitric oxide is again catalytic, but here its effect is to change O3 to O2. This is a poten-
tial problem because O3, which absorbs ultraviolet light, is necessary to protect us 
from the harmful effects of this high-energy radiation. That is, we want O3 in the upper 
atmosphere to block ultraviolet radiation from the sun but not in the lower atmosphere, 
where we would have to breathe it and its oxidation products.
 
The ozone layer is also threatened by Freons, a group of stable, noncorrosive com-
pounds, formerly used as refrigerants and as propellants in aerosol cans. The most 
 commonly used substance of this type was Freon-12 (CCl2F2). The chemical inertness of 
Freons makes them valuable but also creates a problem, since they remain in the environ-
ment a long time. Eventually, they migrate into the upper atmosphere to be decomposed 
by high-energy light. Among the decomposition products are chlorine atoms:
CCl2F21 g2 h
Light
CClF21 g2 1 Cl1 g2
These chlorine atoms can catalyze the decomposition of ozone:
 Cl1 g2 1 O31 g2 h ClO1 g2 1 O21 g2
 O1 g2 1 ClO1 g2 h Cl1 g2 1 O21 g2
 O1 g2 1 O31 g2 h 2O21 g2
 
The problem of Freons has been brought into strong focus by the discovery of a 
mysterious ‚Äúhole‚Äù in the ozone layer in the stratosphere over Antarctica. Studies per-
formed there to find the reason for the hole have found unusually high levels of chlo-
rine monoxide (ClO). This strongly implicates the Freons in the atmosphere as being 
responsible for the ozone destruction.
 
Because they pose environmental problems, Freons have been banned by interna-
tional agreement. Substitute compounds are now being used.
Acid Catalysis
Acids and bases can serve as catalysts in chemical reactions. In acid-catalyzed reac-
tions, for example, a reactant gains a proton (H1). The H1 ion, being positively 
charged, is attracted to the lone pairs on atoms such as O, N, or S in a molecule, or to 
p bonds in an alkene or alkyne.
 
A common industrial method for the production of ethanol is the acid-catalyzed 
reaction of ethylene and water:
CH2PCH2 1 H2O 888n CH3CH2OH
In this case, the H1 is attracted to the double bond on ethylene to make a new interme-
diate that is very reactive. This provides for a new pathway for the reaction that has 
lower activation energy and therefore proceeds more quickly than without the addition 
of the acid catalyst.

he most impressive examples of 
homogeneous catalysis occur in 
nature, where the complex reactions 
necessary for plant and animal life are 
made possible by enzymes. Enzymes 
are large molecules specifically tailored 
to facilitate a given type of reaction. 
Usually enzymes are proteins, an 
important class of biomolecules con-
structed from a-amino acids that have 
the general structure

where R represents any one of 20 differ-

parts‚Äù) called a protein. The general 
structure of a protein can be repre-

Since specific proteins are needed 
by the human body, the proteins in 
food must be broken into their con-
stituent amino acids, which are then 
used to construct new proteins in the 
body‚Äôs cells. The reaction in which a 
protein is broken down one amino acid 
at a time is shown in Fig. 12.17. Note that 
in this reaction a water molecule reacts 
with a protein molecule to produce an 
amino acid and a new protein contain-
ing one less amino acid. Without the 
enzymes found in human cells, this 
reaction would be much too slow  
to be useful. One of 
these enzymes is 
carboxypeptidase-A,  
a zinc-containing 
protein (Fig. 12.18).
Carboxypeptidase-A 
captures the protein  
to be acted on (called 
the substrate) in a 
special groove and 
positions the substrate 
so that the end is in the active site, 
where the catalysis occurs (Fig. 12.19). 
Note that the Zn21 ion bonds to the 
oxygen of the CPO (carbonyl) group. 
This polarizes the electron density in 
the carbonyl group, allowing the 
neighboring CON bond to be broken 
much more easily. When the reaction is 
completed, the remaining portion of 
the substrate protein and the newly 
formed amino acid are released by the 
enzyme.
The process just described for 
carboxypeptidase-A is characteristic of 
the behavior of other enzymes. Enzyme 
catalysis can be represented by the 
series of reactions shown below:
 E 1 S h E # S
 E # S h E 1 P
where E represents the enzyme, S¬†rep-
resents the substrate, E ? S¬†represents 
the enzyme‚Äìsubstrate complex, and 
P¬†represents the products. The 
enzyme and substrate form a com-
plex, where the reaction occurs. The 
enzyme then releases the product 
and is ready to repeat the process. The 
most amazing thing about enzymes is 
their efficiency. Because an enzyme 
plays its catalytic role over and over 
and very rapidly, only a tiny amount 
of enzyme is required. This makes the 
isolation of enzymes for study quite 
difficult.

‚ùØ The value of k can be determined from the plot of the appropriate function of [A] versus t
Reaction mechanism
‚ùØ Series of elementary steps by which an overall reaction occurs
‚ùØ Elementary step: rate law for the step can be written from the molecularity of the reaction
‚ùØ Two requirements for an acceptable mechanism:
‚ùØ The elementary steps sum to give the correct overall balanced equation
‚ùØ The mechanism agrees with the experimentally determined rate law
‚ùØ Simple reactions can have an elementary step that is slower than all of the other steps; this is 
called the rate-determining step.
Kinetic models
‚ùØ The simplest model to account for reaction kinetics is the collision model
‚ùØ Molecules must collide to react
‚ùØ The collision kinetic energy furnishes the potential energy needed to enable the reactants 
to rearrange to form products
‚ùØ A certain threshold energy called the activation energy (Ea) is necessary for a reaction to 
occur
‚ùØ The relative orientations of the colliding reactants are also a determining factor in the 
reaction rate
‚ùØ This model leads to the Arrhenius equation:
k 5 Ae2Ea /RT
‚ùØ A depends on the collision frequency and relative orientation of the molecules
‚ùØ The value of Ea can be found by obtaining the values of k at several temperatures
Catalyst
‚ùØ Speeds up a reaction without being consumed
‚ùØ Works by providing a lower-energy pathway for the reaction
‚ùØ Enzymes are biological catalysts
‚ùØ Catalysts can be classified as homogeneous or heterogeneous
‚ùØ Homogeneous: exist in the same phase as the reactants
‚ùØ Heterogeneous: exist in a different phase than the reactants
‚ùØ Acids and bases can serve as catalysts
 1. Define reaction rate. Distinguish between the initial 
rate, average rate, and  instantaneous rate of a chemi-
cal reaction. Which of these rates is usually fastest? 
The initial rate is the rate used by convention. Give a 
possible explanation as to why.
 2. Distinguish between the differential rate law and the 
integrated rate law. Which of these is often called just 
the ‚Äúrate law‚Äù? What is k in a rate law, and what are 
 orders in a rate law? Explain.
 3. One experimental procedure that can be used to deter-
mine the rate law of a reaction is the method of initial 
rates. What data are gathered in the method of initial 
rates, and how are these data manipulated to determine 
k and the orders of the species in the rate law? Are the 
units for k, the rate constant, the same for all rate laws? 
Explain. If a reaction is first order in A, what happens to 
the rate if [A] is tripled? If the initial rate for a reaction 
increases by a factor of 16 when [A] is quadrupled, 
what is the order of n? If a reaction is third order in A 
and [A] is doubled, what happens to the initial rate? If a 
reaction is zero order, what effect does [A] have on the 
initial rate of a reaction?

These questions are designed to be used by groups of students in 
class.

tive. Give examples to show the differences in these concepts.
 2. Describe at least two experiments you could perform to deter-
mine a rate law.

*In the Questions and the Exercises, the term rate law always refers to 
the differential rate law.
 5. Consider the following statements: ‚ÄúIn general, the rate of a 
chemical reaction increases a bit at first because it takes a 
while for the reaction to get ‚Äòwarmed up.‚Äô After that, however, 
the rate of the reaction decreases because its rate is dependent 
on the concentrations of the reactants, and these are decreas-
ing.‚Äù Indicate everything that is correct in these statements, 
and indicate everything that is incorrect. Correct the incorrect 
statements and explain.
 6. For the reaction A 1 B S C, explain at least two ways in 
which the rate law could be zero order in chemical A.
 7. A friend of yours states, ‚ÄúA balanced equation tells us how chem-
icals interact. Therefore, we can determine the rate law directly 
from the balanced equation.‚Äù What do you tell your friend?
 8. Provide a conceptual rationale for the differences in the half-
lives of zero-, first-, and second-order reactions.
 4. The initial rate for a reaction is equal to the slope of the 
tangent line at t < 0 in a plot of [A] versus time. From 
calculus, initial rate 5 2d3A4
dt
. Therefore, the differen-
tial rate law for a reaction is Rate 5 2d3A4
dt
5 k3A4n. 
Assuming you have some calculus in your background, 
derive the zero-, first-, and second-order integrated rate 
laws using the differential rate law.
 5. Consider the zero-, first-, and second-order integrated 
rate laws. If you have concentration versus time data 
for some species in a reaction, what plots would you 
make to ‚Äúprove‚Äù a reaction is either zero, first, or sec-
ond order? How would the rate constant, k, be deter-
mined from such a plot? What does the y-intercept 
equal in each plot? When a rate law contains the con-
centration of two or more species, how can plots be 
used to determine k and the orders of the species in the 
rate law?
 6. Derive expressions for the half-life of zero-, first-,  
and second-order reac tions using the integrated rate 
law for each order. How does each half-life depend  
on concentration? If the half-life for a reaction is  
20. seconds, what would be the second half-life 
assuming the reaction is either zero, first, or second 
order?
 7. Define each of the following.
a. elementary step
b. molecularity
c. reaction mechanism
d. intermediate
e. rate-determining step
 8. What two requirements must be met to call a mecha-

 reactions occur by a one-step mechanism? Explain.
 9. What is the premise underlying the collision model? 
How is the rate affected by each of the following?
a. activation energy
b. temperature
c. frequency of collisions
d. orientation of collisions
Sketch a potential energy versus reaction progress plot 
for an endothermic reaction and for an exothermic 
reaction. Show DE and Ea in both plots. When concen-
trations and temperatures are equal, would you expect 
the rate of the forward reaction to be equal to, greater 
than, or less than the rate of the reverse reaction if the 
reaction is exothermic? Endothermic?
 10. Give the Arrhenius equation. Take the natural log of 
both sides and place this equation in the form of a 
straight-line equation (y 5 mx 1 b). What data would 
you need and how would you graph those data to get a 
linear relationship using the Arrhenius equation? What 
does the slope of the straight line equal? What does the 
y-intercept equal? What are the units of R in the Arrhe-
nius equation? Explain how if you know the rate con-
stant value at two different temperatures, you can 
determine the activation energy for the reaction.
 11. Why does a catalyst increase the rate of a reaction? 
What is the difference between a homogeneous catalyst 
and a heterogeneous catalyst? Would a given reaction

I
n doing stoichiometry calculations we assumed that reactions proceed to comple-
tion, that is, until one of the reactants runs out. Many reactions do proceed essen-
tially to completion. For such reactions it can be assumed that the reactants are 
quantitatively converted to products and that the amount of limiting reactant that 
remains is negligible. On the other hand, there are many chemical reactions that stop 
far short of completion. An example is the dimerization of nitrogen dioxide:
NO21 g2 1 NO21 g2 h N2O41 g2
The reactant, NO2, is a dark brown gas, and the product, N2O4, is a colorless gas. 
When NO2 is placed in an evacuated, sealed glass vessel at 258C, the initial dark brown 
color decreases in intensity as it is converted to colorless N2O4. However, even over a 
long period of time, the contents of the reaction vessel do not become colorless. 
Instead, the intensity of the brown color eventually becomes constant, which means 
that the concentration of NO2 is no longer changing. This is illustrated on the molecu-
lar level in Fig. 13.1. This  observation is a clear indication that the reaction has stopped 
short of completion. In fact, the system has reached chemical equilibrium, the state 
where the concentrations of all reactants and products remain constant with time.
Any chemical reactions carried out in a closed vessel will reach equilibrium. For 
some reactions the equilibrium position so favors the products that the reaction appears 
to have gone to completion. We say that the equilibrium position for such reactions lies 
far to the right (in the direction of the products). For example, when gaseous hydrogen 
and oxygen are mixed in stoichiometric quantities and react to form water vapor, the 
reaction proceeds essentially to completion. The amounts of the reactants that remain 
when the system reaches equilibrium are so tiny as to be negligible. By contrast, some 
reactions occur only to a slight extent. For example, when solid CaO is placed in a 
closed vessel at 258C, the decomposition to solid Ca and gaseous O2 is virtually unde-
tectable. In cases like this, the equilibrium position is said to lie far to the left (in the 
direction of the reactants).
In this chapter we will discuss how and why a chemical system comes to equilibrium 
and the characteristics of equilibrium. In particular, we will discuss how to  calculate the 
concentrations of the reactants and products present for a given system at equilibrium.
 
13.1 The Equilibrium Condition
Since no changes occur in the concentrations of reactants or products in a reaction 
system at equilibrium, it may appear that everything has stopped. However, this is not 
the case. On the molecular level, there is frantic activity. Equilibrium is not static but 
is a highly dynamic situation. The concept of chemical equilibrium is analogous to the 
flow of cars across a bridge connecting two island cities. Suppose the traffic flow on 
the bridge is the same in both directions. It is obvious that there is motion, since one

can see the cars traveling back and forth across the bridge, but the number of cars in 
each city is not changing because equal numbers of cars are entering and leaving. The 
result is no net change in the car population.
 
To see how this concept applies to chemical reactions, consider the reaction between 
steam and carbon monoxide in a closed vessel at a high temperature where the reaction 
takes place rapidly:
H2O1 g2 1 CO1 g2 m H21 g2 1 CO21 g2
Assume that the same number of moles of gaseous CO and gaseous H2O are placed in 
a closed vessel and allowed to react. The plots of the concentrations of reactants and 
products versus time are shown in Fig. 13.2. Note that since CO and H2O were origi-
nally present in equal molar quantities, and since they react in a 1:1 ratio, the concen-
trations of the two gases are always equal. Also, since H2 and CO2 are formed in equal 
amounts, they are  always present in the same concentrations.
 
Figure 13.2 is a profile of the progress of the reaction. When CO and H2O are 
mixed, they immediately begin to react to form H2 and CO2. This leads to a decrease 
in the concentrations of the reactants, but the concentrations of the products, which 
were initially at zero, are increasing. Beyond a certain time, indicated by the dashed 
line in Fig. 13.2, the concentrations of reactants and products no longer change‚Äî 
equilibrium has been reached. Unless the system is somehow disturbed, no further 
changes in concentrations will occur. Note that although the equilibrium position lies 
far to the right, the concentrations of reactants never go to zero; the reactants will 
always be present in small but constant concentrations. This is shown on the micro-
scopic level in Fig. 13.3.
 
What would happen to the gaseous equilibrium mixture of reactants and products 
represented in Fig. 13.3, parts (c) and (d), if we injected some H2O(g) into the box? To 
answer this question, we need to be sure we understand the equilibrium condition: The 
concentrations of reactants and products remain constant at equilibrium because the 
 forward and reverse reaction rates are equal. If we inject some H2O molecules, what 
will happen to the forward reaction: H2O 1 CO S H2 1 CO2? It will speed up

because more H2O molecules means more collisions between H2O and CO molecules. 
This in turn will form more products and will cause the reverse reaction 
H2O 1 CO d H2 1 CO2 to speed up. Thus the system will change until the forward 
and reverse reaction rates again become equal. Will this new equilibrium position con-
tain more or fewer product molecules than are shown in Fig. 13.3(c) and (d)? Think 
about this carefully. If you are not sure of the answer now, keep reading. We will con-
sider this type of situation in more detail later in this chapter.
 
Why does equilibrium occur? We saw in Chapter 12 that molecules react by collid-
ing with one another, and the more collisions, the faster the reaction. This is why reac-
tion rates depend on concentrations. In this case the concentrations of H2O and CO are 
lowered by the forward reaction:
H2O 1 CO h H2 1 CO2
As the concentrations of the reactants decrease, the forward reaction slows down 
(Fig. 13.4). As in the bridge traffic analogy, there is also a reverse direction:
H2O 1 CO v H2 1 CO2
Initially in this experiment no H2 and CO2 were present, and this reverse reaction could 
not occur. However, as the forward reaction proceeds, the concentrations of H2 and CO2 
build up, and the rate of the reverse reaction increases (Fig. 13.4) as the forward reaction 
slows down. Eventually, the concentrations reach levels where the rate of the forward 
reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction. The system has reached equilibrium.
 
The equilibrium position of a reaction‚Äîleft, right, or somewhere in between‚Äîis 
determined by many factors: the initial concentrations, the relative energies of the reac-
tants and products, and the relative degree of ‚Äúorganization‚Äù of the reactants and prod-
ucts. Energy and organization come into play because nature tries to achieve minimum 
energy and maximum disorder, as we will show in detail in Chapter 16. For now, we will 
simply view the equilibrium phenomenon in terms of the rates of opposing reactions.
The Characteristics of Chemical Equilibrium
To explore the important characteristics of chemical equilibrium, we will consider the 
synthesis of ammonia from elemental nitrogen and hydrogen:
N21 g2 1 3H21 g2 m 2NH31 g2
This process is of great commercial value because ammonia is an important fertilizer 
for the growth of corn and other crops. Ironically, this beneficial process was discov-
ered in Germany just before World War I in a search for ways to produce nitrogen-
based explosives. In the course of this work, German chemist Fritz Haber (1868‚Äì1934) 
pioneered the large-scale production of ammonia.
 
When gaseous nitrogen, hydrogen, and ammonia are mixed in a closed vessel at 
258C, no apparent change in the concentrations occurs over time, regardless of the 
original amounts of the gases. Why? There are two possible reasons why the 
A double arrow (34) is used to show that 
a reaction can occur in either direction.
The relationship between equilibrium 
and thermodynamics is explored in 
 Section 16.8.
The United States produces about  
20 million tons of ammonia annually.
Molecules with strong bonds produce 
large activation energies and tend to  react 
slowly at 258C.

H2O(g) and CO(g) are mixed. The rates do 
not change in the same way with time 
 because the  forward reaction has a much 
larger rate constant than the  reverse 
reaction.
513
13.1 The Equilibrium Condition

concentrations of the reactants and products of a given chemical reaction remain 
unchanged when mixed.
1.
The system is at chemical equilibrium.
2.
The forward and reverse reactions are so slow that the system moves toward 
equilibrium at a rate that cannot be detected.
The second reason applies to the nitrogen, hydrogen, and ammonia mixture at 258C. 
As we saw in Chapters 8 and 9, the N2 molecule has a very strong triple bond (941 kJ/mol) 
and thus is very unreactive. Also, the H2 molecule has an unusually strong single bond 
(432 kJ/mol). Therefore, mixtures of N2, H2, and NH3 at 258C can exist with no apparent 
change over long periods of time, unless a catalyst is introduced to speed up the forward 
and reverse reactions. Under appropriate conditions, the system does reach equilibrium, 
as shown in Fig. 13.5. Note that because of the reaction stoichiometry, H2 disappears 
three times as fast as N2 does and NH3 forms twice as fast as N2 disappears.
13.2 The Equilibrium Constant
Science is fundamentally empirical‚Äîit is based on experiment. The development of 
the equilibrium concept is typical. From their observations of many chemical reactions, 
two Norwegian chemists, Cato Maximilian Guldberg (1836‚Äì1902) and Peter Waage 
(1833‚Äì1900), proposed in 1864 the law of mass action as a general description of the 
equilibrium condition. Guldberg and Waage postulated that for a reaction of the type
jA 1 kB m lC 1 mD
where A, B, C, and D represent chemical species and j, k, l, and m are their coefficients 
in the balanced equation, the law of mass action is represented by the following equi-
librium expression:
K 5 3C4l3D4m
3A4j3B4k
The square brackets indicate the concentrations of the chemical species at equilibrium, 
and K is a constant called the equilibrium constant.

It is very important to note at this point that the equilibrium constants are customar-
ily given without units. The reason for this is beyond the scope of this text, but it 
involves corrections for the nonideal behavior of the substances taking part in the reac-
tion. When these corrections are made, the units cancel out and the corrected K has no 
units. Thus we will not use units for K in this text.
Calculating the Values of K
The following equilibrium concentrations were observed for the Haber process for 
 synthesis of ammonia at 1278C:
 3NH34 5 3.1 3 1022 mol/L

LET‚ÄôS REVIEW  Conclusions About the Equilibrium Expression
 ¬ª The equilibrium expression for a reaction is the reciprocal of that for the reaction written 
in reverse.
 ¬ª When the balanced equation for a reaction is multiplied by a factor n, the equilibrium 
expression for the new reaction is the original expression raised to the nth power. Thus 
Knew 5 (Koriginal)n.
 ¬ª K values are customarily written without units.
 
The law of mass action is widely applicable. It correctly describes the equilibrium 
behavior of an amazing variety of chemical systems in solution and in the gas phase. 
Although, as we will see later, corrections must be applied in certain cases, such as for 
concentrated aqueous solutions and for gases at high pressures, the law of mass action 
provides a remarkably accurate description of all types of chemical equilibria.
 
Consider again the ammonia synthesis reaction. The equilibrium constant K always 
has the same value at a given temperature. At 5008C the value of K is 6.0 3 1022. 
Whenever N2, H2, and NH3 are mixed together at this temperature, the system will 
always come to an equilibrium position such that
3NH342
3N243H243 5 6.0 3 1022
This expression has the same value at 5008C, regardless of the amounts of the gases 
that are mixed together initially.
 
Although the special ratio of products to reactants defined by the equilibrium 
expression is constant for a given reaction system at a given temperature, the equilib-
rium concentrations will not always be the same. Table 13.1 gives three sets of data for 
the synthesis of ammonia, showing that even though the individual sets of equilibrium 
concentrations are quite different for the different situations, the equilibrium constant, 
which depends on the ratio of the concentrations, remains the same (within experi-
mental error). Note that subscript zeros indicate initial concentrations.
 
Each set of equilibrium concentrations is called an equilibrium position. It is 
essential to distinguish between the equilibrium constant and the equilibrium positions 
for a given reaction system. There is only one equilibrium constant for a particular 
system at a particular temperature, but there are an infinite number of equilibrium 
The law of mass action applies to solution 
and gaseous equilibria.
For a reaction at a given temperature, there 
are many equilibrium positions but only 
one value for K.

13.3 Equilibrium Expressions Involving 
Pressures
So far we have been describing equilibria involving gases in terms of concentrations. 
Equilibria involving gases also can be described in terms of pressures. The relationship 
between the pressure and the concentration of a gas can be seen from the ideal gas 
equation:
PV 5 nRT    or    P 5 a n
Vb RT 5 CRT
where C equals nyV, or the number of moles n of gas per unit volume V. Thus C rep-
resents the molar concentration of the gas.
 
For the ammonia synthesis reaction, the equilibrium expression can be written in 
terms of concentrations, that is,
K 5
3NH342
3N243H243 5
1CNH32
 2
1CN22 1CH2
 2 3 5 Kc
or in terms of the equilibrium partial pressures of the gases, that is,
Kp 5
1PNH32
 2
1PN22 1PH2
 2 3
Both the symbols K and Kc are used commonly for an equilibrium constant in terms of 
concentrations. We will always use K in this book. The symbol Kp represents an equi-
librium constant in terms of partial pressures.
Calculating Values of K p

Kc is used instead of K.

The relationship between K and Kp for a particular reaction follows from the fact 
that for an ideal gas, C 5 PyRT. For example, for the ammonia synthesis reaction,

Thus for this reaction, K is equal to Kp. This equality occurs because the sum of the 
coefficients on either side of the balanced equation is identical, so the terms in RT 
cancel out. In the equilibrium expression for the ammonia synthesis reaction, the sum 
of the powers in the numerator is different from that in the denominator, and K does 
not equal Kp.
 
For the general reaction
jA 1 kB m lC 1 mD
the relationship between K and Kp is
Kp 5 K1RT 2 Dn
where Dn is the sum of the coefficients of the gaseous products minus the sum of the 
coefficients of the gaseous reactants. This equation is quite easy to derive from the 
definitions of K and Kp and the relationship between pressure and concentration. For

either side of the balanced equation is identical.¬†.¬†.¬†.‚Äù What if you are told that for

13.4 Heterogeneous Equilibria
So far we have discussed equilibria only for systems in the gas phase, where all reac-
tants and products are gases. These are homogeneous equilibria. However, many 
equilibria involve more than one phase and are called heterogeneous equilibria. For 
example, the thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate in the commercial prepara-
tion of lime occurs by a reaction involving both solid and gas phases:
CaCO31s2 m CaO1s2 1 CO21 g2
h

CHAPTER 13 Chemical Equilibrium

However, experimental results show that the position of a heterogeneous equilib-
rium does not depend on the amounts of pure solids or liquids present (Fig. 13.6). The 
fundamental reason for this behavior is that the concentrations of pure solids and liq-
uids cannot change. Thus the equilibrium expression for the decomposition of solid 
calcium carbonate might be represented as
Kr 5 3CO24C1
C2
where C1 and C2 are constants representing the concentrations of the solids CaO and 
CaCO3, respectively. This expression can be rearranged to give
C2Kr
C1
5 K 5 3CO24
We can generalize from this result as follows: If pure solids or pure liquids are 
involved in a chemical reaction, their concentrations are not included in the equilib-
rium expression for the reaction. This simplification occurs only with pure solids or 
liquids, not with solutions or gases, since in these last two cases the concentrations can 
vary.
For example, in the decomposition of liquid water to gaseous hydrogen and 
oxygen,
2H2O1l2 m 2H21 g2 1 O21 g2
where
K 5 3H2423O24¬†¬†and¬†¬†Kp 5 1PH22

water is not included in either equilibrium expression because it is a pure liquid. How-
ever, if the reaction were carried out under conditions where the water is a gas rather 
than a liquid, that is,
2H2O1 g2 m 2H21 g2 1 O21 g2

13.5 Applications of the Equilibrium 
Constant
Knowing the equilibrium constant for a reaction allows us to predict several important 
features of the reaction: the tendency of the reaction to occur (but not the speed of the 
reaction), whether a given set of concentrations represents an equilibrium condition, and 
the equilibrium position that will be achieved from a given set of initial concentrations.
To introduce some of these ideas, we will first consider the reaction

equilibrium constant equal to 16.
 
In a given experiment, the two types of molecules are mixed together in the follow-
ing amounts:

After the system reacts and comes to equilibrium, what will the system look like? We 
know that at equilibrium the ratio
(N
)(N
)
(N
)
(N
)
= 16
must be satisfied, where each N represents the number of molecules of each type. We 
originally have 9 
 molecules and 12 
 molecules. As a place to start, let‚Äôs just 
assume that 5 
 molecules disappear for the system to reach equilibrium. Since equal 
numbers of the 
 and 
 molecules react, this means that 5 
 molecules also will 
disappear. This also means that 5 
 molecules and 5 
 molecules will be formed. We 
can summarize as follows:
Initial Conditions
9         molecules
12         molecules
0         molecules
0         molecules
New Conditions
9 ‚àí 5 = 4         molecules
12 ‚àí 5 = 7         molecules
0 + 5 = 5         molecules
0 + 5 = 5         molecules
Do the new conditions represent equilibrium for this reaction system? We can find out 
by taking the ratio of the numbers of molecules:
(N
(5)(5)
)(N
)
(N
(4)(7)
)
(N
)
=
= 0.9
Thus this is not an equilibrium position because the ratio is not 16, as required for 
equilibrium. In which direction must the system move to achieve equilibrium? Since 
the observed ratio is smaller than 16, we must increase the numerator and decrease the 
denominator: The system needs to move to the right (toward more products) to achieve 
equilibrium. That is, more than 5 of the original reactant molecules must disappear to 
reach equilibrium for this system. How can we find the correct number? Since we do 
not know the number of molecules that need to disappear to reach equilibrium, let‚Äôs 
call this number x. Now we can set up a table similar to the one we used earlier:
x         disappear
x         disappear
x         form
x         form

Initial Conditions
9         molecules
12         molecules

For the system to be at equilibrium, we know that the following ratio must be 
satisfied:
(x)(x)
(9 ‚àí x)(12 ‚àí x)
= 16 =
(N
)(N
)
(N
)
(N
)
The easiest way to solve for x here is by trial and error. From our previous discussion, 
we know that x is greater than 5. Also, we know that it must be less than 9 because we 
have only 9 
 molecules to start. We can‚Äôt use all of them or we will have a zero in 
the  denominator, which causes the ratio to be infinitely large. By trial and error, we 
find that x 5 8 because

The equilibrium mixture can be pictured as follows:
Note that it contains 8 
 molecules, 8 
 molecules, 1 
 molecule, and 4 
 
 molecules as required.
 
This pictorial example should help you understand the fundamental ideas of equi-
librium. Now we will proceed to a more systematic, quantitative treatment of chemical 
equilibrium.
The Extent of a Reaction
The inherent tendency for a reaction to occur is indicated by the magnitude of the 
equilibrium constant. A value of K much larger than 1 means that at equilibrium the 
reaction system will consist of mostly products‚Äîthe equilibrium lies to the right. 
Another way of saying this is that reactions with very large equilibrium constants go 
essentially to completion. On the other hand, a very small value of K means that the 
system at equilibrium will consist of mostly reactants‚Äîthe equilibrium position is far 
to the left. The given reaction does not occur to any significant extent.
 
It is important to understand that the size of K and the time required to reach equilibrium 
are not directly related. The time required to achieve equilibrium depends on the reaction 
rate, which is determined by the size of the activation energy. The size of K is determined 
by thermodynamic factors such as the difference in energy between products and reactants. 
This difference is represented in Fig. 13.7 and will be discussed in detail in Chapter 16.
Reaction Quotient
When the reactants and products of a given chemical reaction are mixed, it is useful to 
know whether the mixture is at equilibrium or, if not, the direction in which the system 
must shift to reach equilibrium. If the concentration of one of the reactants or products 
is zero, the system will shift in the direction that produces the missing component. 
However, if all the initial concentrations are nonzero, it is more difficult to determine 
the direction of the move toward equilibrium. To determine the shift in such cases, we 
use the reaction quotient, Q. The reaction quotient is obtained by applying the law of 
mass action using initial concentrations instead of equilibrium concentrations. For 
example, for the synthesis of ammonia
N21 g2 1 3H21 g2 m 2NH31 g2
the expression for the reaction quotient is
Q 5
3NH340
 2
3N2403H240
 3
where the subscript zeros indicate initial concentrations.
 
To determine in which direction a system will shift to reach equilibrium, we com-
pare the values of Q and K. There are three possible cases (Fig. 13.8):
1. Q is equal to K. The system is at equilibrium; no shift will occur.
2. Q is greater than K. In this case, the ratio of initial concentrations of products to 
initial concentrations of reactants is too large. To reach equilibrium, a net change 
of products to reactants must occur. The system shifts to the left, consuming 
products and forming reactants, until equilibrium is achieved.

tion energy Ea prevents the  reaction at 
258C. In other words, the magnitude of K 
for the reaction depends on DE, but the 
 reaction rate depends on Ea.

3. Q is less than K. In this case, the ratio of initial concentrations of products to 
initial concentrations of reactants is too small. The system must shift to the right, 
consuming reactants and forming products, to attain equilibrium.
Using the Reaction Quotient
For the synthesis of ammonia at 5008C, the equilibrium constant is 6.0 3 1022. Predict 
the direction in which the system will shift to reach equilibrium in each of the follow-
ing cases:

the concentrations of the products must be decreased and the concentrations of

Calculating Equilibrium Pressures  
and Concentrations
A typical equilibrium problem involves finding the equilibrium concentrations (or 
pressures) of reactants and products, given the value of the equilibrium constant and 
the initial concentrations (or pressures). However, since such problems sometimes 
become complicated mathematically, we will develop useful strategies for solving 
them by  considering cases for which we know one or more of the equilibrium concen-
trations (or pressures).
Calculating Equilibrium Pressures I
Dinitrogen tetroxide in its liquid state was used as one of the fuels on the lunar lander 
for the NASA Apollo missions. In the gas phase, it decomposes to gaseous nitrogen 
dioxide:
N2O41 g2 m 2NO21 g2
Consider an experiment in which gaseous N2O4 was placed in a flask and allowed to 
reach equilibrium at a temperature where Kp 5 0.133. At equilibrium, the pressure of 
N2O4 was found to be 2.71 atm. Calculate the equilibrium pressure of NO2(g).
 
SOLUTION 
We know that the equilibrium pressures of the gases NO2 and N2O4 must satisfy the 
 relationship

Since we know PN2O4, we can simply solve for PNO2:

8.70 3 1023 mole of PCl5(g). After the system had reached equilibrium, 2.00 3 1023 
mole of Cl2(g) was found in the flask. Gaseous PCl5 decomposes according to the

SOLUTION 
What is the equilibrium expression for this reaction?
K 5 3Cl243PCl34
3PCl54
To find the value of K, we must calculate the equilibrium concentrations of all species 
and then substitute these quantities into the equilibrium expression. The best method 
for finding the equilibrium concentrations is to begin with the initial concentrations, 
which we will define as the concentrations before any shift toward equilibrium has 
occurred. We will then modify these initial concentrations appropriately to find the 
equilibrium concentrations.

5 8.70 3 1023 M
What change is required to reach equilibrium?
Since no Cl2 was initially present but 2.00 3 1023 M Cl2 is present at equilibrium, 
2.00 3 1023 mole of PCl5 must have decomposed to form 2.00 3 1023 mole of Cl2 and 
2.00 3 1023 mole of PCl3. In other words, to reach equilibrium, the reaction shifted to 
the right:

Sometimes we are not given any of the equilibrium concentrations (or pressures), 
only the initial values. Then we must use the stoichiometry of the reaction to express 
concentrations (or pressures) at equilibrium in terms of the initial values. This is illus-
trated in Example 13.10.
Calculating Equilibrium Concentrations I
Carbon monoxide reacts with steam to produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen. At  
700 K the equilibrium constant is 5.10. Calculate the equilibrium concentrations of all 
species if 1.000 mol of each component is mixed in a 1.000-L flask.

1.000 L
5 1.000 M
Is the system at equilibrium, and if not, which way will it shift to reach the equilibrium 
position? These questions can be answered by calculating Q:
Q 5 3CO2403H240
3CO403H2O40
5 11.000 mol/L2 11.000 mol/L2
11.000 mol/L2 11.000 mol/L2 5 1.000
Since Q is less than K, the system is not at equilibrium initially but must shift to the 
right.
What are the equilibrium concentrations?
As before, we start with the initial concentrations and modify them to obtain the equi-
librium concentrations. We must ask this question: How much will the system shift to 
the right to attain the equilibrium condition? In Example 13.9 the change needed for 
the system to reach equilibrium was given. However, in this case we do not have this 
information.
 
Since the required change in concentrations is unknown at this point, we will define 
it in terms of x. Let‚Äôs assume that x mol/L CO must react for the system to reach equi-
librium. This means that the initial concentration of CO will decrease by x mol/L:
3CO4 5 3CO40 2 x
 
h 
h 
h 
 
Equilibrium Initial Change
Since each CO molecule reacts with one H2O molecule, the concentration of water 
vapor also must decrease by x mol/L:
3H2O4 5 3H2O40 2 x
As the reactant concentrations decrease, the product concentrations increase. Since all 
the coefficients are 1 in the balanced reaction, 1 mole of CO2 reacting with 1 mole of 
H2O will produce 1 mole of CO2 and 1 mole of H2. Or in the present case, to reach 
equilibrium, x mol/L CO will react with x mol/L H2O to give an additional x mol/L 
CO2 and x mol/L H2:
xCO 1 xH2O h xCO2 1 xH2

Thus the initial concentrations of CO2 and H2 will increase by x mol/L:
 3CO24 5 3CO240 1 x
 3H24 5 3H240 1 x
Now we have all the equilibrium concentrations defined in terms of the initial concen-
trations and the change x:
Initial  
Concentration  
(mol/L)
Change 
(mol/L)

[CO2]0 5 1.000
1x
1.000 1 x
[H2]0 5 1.000
1x
1.000 1 x
Note that the sign of x is determined by the direction of the shift. In this example, the 
system shifts to the right, so the product concentrations increase and the reactant con-
centrations decrease. Also note that because the coefficients in the balanced equation 
are all 1, the magnitude of the change is the same for all species.
 
Now since we know that the equilibrium concentrations must satisfy the equilib-
rium expression, we can find the value of x by substituting these concentrations into 
the expression
K 5 5.10 5 3CO243H24
3CO43H2O4 5 11.000 1 x2 11.000 1 x2
11.000 2 x2 11.000 2 x2 5 11.000 1 x2 2
11.000 2 x2 2
Since the right side of the equation is a perfect square, the solution of the problem can 
be simplified by taking the square root of both sides:
"5.10 5 2.26 5 1.000 1 x
1.000 2 x
Multiplying and collecting terms gives
x 5 0.387 mol/L
Thus the system shifts to the right, consuming 0.387 mol/L CO and 0.387 mol/L H2O 
and forming 0.387 mol/L CO2 and 0.387 mol/L H2.
 
Now the equilibrium concentrations can be calculated:
‚ñ†  3CO4 5 3H2O4 5 1.000 2 x 5 1.000 2 0.387 5 0.613 M
‚ñ†  3CO24 5 3H24 5 1.000 1 x 5 1.000 1 0.387 5 1.387 M
Reality Check These values can be checked by substituting them back into the equilib-
rium expression to make sure they give the correct value for K:
K 5 3CO243H24
3CO43H2O4 5 11.3872 2
10.6132 2 5 5.12
This result is the same as the given value of K (5.10) within round-off error, so the 
 answer must be correct.

gen and fluorine has an equilibrium constant of 1.15 3 102 at a certain temperature. In

Since Q is much less than K, the system must shift to the right to reach equilibrium.
What change in the concentrations is necessary?
Since this is presently unknown, we will define the change needed in terms of x. Let x 
equal the number of moles per liter of H2 consumed to reach equilibrium. The stoichi-
ometry of the reaction shows that x mol/L F2 also will be consumed and 2x mol/L HF 
will be formed:
 
H21 g2  1 F21 g2  h  2HF1 g2
x mol/L 1 x mol/L h 2x mol/L

13.6 Solving Equilibrium Problems
We have already considered most of the strategies needed to solve equilibrium prob-
lems. The typical procedure for analyzing a chemical equilibrium problem can be 
summarized as follows:
PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY
Solving Equilibrium Problems
1. Write the balanced equation for the reaction.
2. Write the equilibrium expression using the law of mass action.
3. List the initial concentrations.
4. Calculate Q, and determine the direction of the shift to equilibrium.
5. Define the change needed to reach equilibrium, and define the equilibrium 
concentrations by applying the change to the initial concentrations.
6. Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the equilibrium expression, and solve 
for the unknown.
7. Check your calculated equilibrium concentrations by making sure they give the 
correct value of K.
So far we have been careful to choose systems in which we can solve for the 
unknown by taking the square root of both sides of the equation. However, this type of 
system is not really very common, and we must now consider a more typical problem. 
Suppose for a synthesis of hydrogen fluoride from hydrogen and fluorine, 3.000 moles 
of H2 and 6.000 moles of F2 are mixed in a 3.000-L flask. Assume that the equilibrium 
constant for the synthesis reaction at this temperature is 1.15 3 102. We calculate the 
equilibrium concentration of each component as follows:
1. What is the balanced equation for the reaction?
H21 g2 1 F21 g2 m 2HF1 g2

4. What is Q?
There is no need to calculate Q because no HF is present initially, and we know 
that the system must shift to the right to reach equilibrium.
5. What change is required to reach equilibrium?
If we let x represent the number of moles per liter of H2 consumed to reach equi-
librium, we can represent the equilibrium concentrations as follows:

3H243F24 5
12x2 2
11.000 2 x2 12.000 2 x2
Since the right side of this equation is not a perfect square, we cannot take the 
square root of both sides, but must use some other procedure.
First, do the indicated multiplication:
11.000 2 x2 12.000 2 x2 11.15 3 1022 5 12x2 2
or 
11.15 3 1022x2 2 3.00011.15 3 1022x 1 2.00011.15 3 1022 5 4x2
and collect terms
11.11 3 1022x2 2 13.45 3 1022x 1 2.30 3 102 5 0
This is a quadratic equation of the general form
ax2 1 bx 1 c 5 0
where the roots can be obtained from the quadratic formula:
x 5 2b 6 "b2 2 4ac
2a
In this example, a 5 1.11 3 102, b 5 23.45 3 102, and c 5 2.30 3 102. Substi-
tuting these values into the quadratic formula gives two values for x:
x 5 2.14 mol/L¬†¬†and¬†¬†x 5 0.968 mol/L
Both of these results cannot be valid (since a given set of initial concentrations 
leads to only one equilibrium position). How can we choose between them? 
Since the expression for the equilibrium concentration of H2 is
3H24 5 1.000 M 2 x
Use of the quadratic formula is explained in 
Appendix 1.4.
532
CHAPTER 13 Chemical Equilibrium

the value of x cannot be 2.14 mol/L (because subtracting 2.14 M from 1.000 M 
gives a negative concentration of H2, which is physically impossible). Thus the 
correct value for x is 0.968 mol/L, and the equilibrium concentrations are as 
follows:
‚ñ†  3H24 5 1.000 M 2 0.968 M 5 3.2 3 1022 M
‚ñ†  3F24 5 2.000 M 2 0.968 M 5 1.032 M
‚ñ†  3HF4 5 210.968 M2 5 1.936 M
Reality Check
7. We can check these concentrations by substituting them into the equilibrium 
expression:
3HF42
3H243F24 5
11.9362 2
13.2 3 10222 11.0322 5 1.13 3 102
This value is in close agreement with the given value for K (1.15 3 102), so the 
calculated equilibrium concentrations are correct.
 
This procedure is further illustrated for a problem involving pressures in 
Example 13.12.
Calculating Equilibrium Pressures
Assume that gaseous hydrogen iodide is synthesized from hydrogen gas and iodine 
vapor at a temperature where the equilibrium constant is 1.00 3 102. Suppose HI at 
5.000 3 1021 atm, H2 at 1.000 3 1022 atm, and I2 at 5.000 3 1023 atm are mixed in a 
5.000-L flask. Calculate the equilibrium pressures of all species.

Since Q is greater than K, the system will shift to the left to reach equilibrium.
 
So far we have used moles or concentrations in stoichiometric calculations. 
 However, it is equally valid to use pressures for a gas-phase system at constant 
 temperature and volume because in this case pressure is directly proportional to 
the number of moles:
P 5 n aRT
V b
 m88 Constant if constant T and V
Thus we can represent the change needed to achieve equilibrium in terms of 
pressures.

Treating Systems That Have Small

We have seen that fairly complicated calculations are often necessary to solve equilib-
rium problems. However, under certain conditions, simplifications are possible that 
greatly reduce the mathematical difficulties. For example, gaseous NOCl decomposes 
to form the gases NO and Cl2. At 358C the equilibrium constant is 1.6 3 1025. In an

Since there are no products initially, the system will move to the right to reach equi-
librium. We will define x as the change in concentration of Cl2 needed to reach equi-
librium. The changes in the concentrations of NOCl and NO can then be obtained from 
the balanced equation:

Multiplying and collecting terms will give an equation with terms containing x3, x2, 
and x, which requires complicated methods to solve directly. However, we can avoid 
this situation by recognizing that since K is so small (1.6 3 1025), the system will not 
proceed far to the right to reach equilibrium. That is, x represents a relatively small 
number. The consequence of this fact is that the term (0.50 2 2x) can be approximated 
by 0.50. That is, when x is small,
0.50 2 2x < 0.50
Making this approximation allows us to simplify the equilibrium expression:
1.6 3 1025 5

0.50 2 2x 5 0.50 2 211.0 3 10222 5 0.48
The difference between 0.50 and 0.48 is 0.02, or 4% of the initial concentration of 
NOCl, a relatively small discrepancy that will have little effect on the outcome. That 
is, since 2x is very small compared with 0.50, the value of x obtained in the approxi-
mate solution should be very close to the exact value. We use this approximate value 
of x to calculate the equilibrium concentrations:

Since the given value of K is 1.6 3 1025, these calculated concentrations are correct.
 
This problem was much easier to solve than it appeared at first because the small 
value of K and the resulting small shift to the right to reach equilibrium allowed 
simplification.
CRITICAL THINKING You have learned how to treat systems 
that have small equilibrium constants by making approximations to simplify the 
math. What if the system has a very large equilibrium constant? What can you 
do to simplify the math for this case? Use the example from the text, but change 
the value of the equilibrium constant to 1.6 3 105 and rework the problem. Why 
can you not use approximations for the case in which K 5 1.6?
 
13.7 Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs Principle
It is important to understand the factors that control the position of a chemical equilib-
rium. For example, when a chemical is manufactured, the chemists and chemical engi-
neers in charge of production want to choose conditions that favor the desired product 
as much as possible. That is, they want the equilibrium to lie far to the right. When 
Fritz Haber was developing the process for the synthesis of ammonia, he did extensive 
studies on how temperature and pressure affect the equilibrium concentration of 
ammonia. Some of his results are given in Table 13.2. Note that the equilibrium amount 
of NH3 increases with an increase in pressure but decreases as the temperature is 
increased. Thus the amount of NH3 present at equilibrium is favored by conditions of 
low temperature and high pressure.
 
However, this is not the whole story. Carrying out the process at low temperatures 
is not feasible because then the reaction is too slow. Even though the equilibrium tends 
to shift to the right as the temperature is lowered, the attainment of equilibrium would 
be much too slow at low temperatures to be practical. This emphasizes once again that 
we must study both the thermodynamics and the kinetics of a reaction before we really 
 understand the factors that control it.
 
We can qualitatively predict the effects of changes in concentration, pressure, and 
temperature on a system at equilibrium by using Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs principle, which 
states that if a change is imposed on a system at equilibrium, the position of the 
equilibrium will shift in a direction that tends to reduce that change. Although this 
rule sometimes oversimplifies the situation, it works remarkably well.

The Effect of a Change in Concentration
To see how we can predict the effect of change in concentration on a system at equi-
librium, we will consider the ammonia synthesis reaction. Suppose there is an equilib-
rium position described by these concentrations:
3N24 5 0.399 M¬†¬†¬†¬†3H24 5 1.197 M¬†¬†¬†¬†3NH34 5 0.202 M
What will happen if 1.000 mol/L N2 is suddenly injected into the system? We can  
answer this question by calculating the value of Q. The concentrations before the sys-
tem adjusts are
 3N240 5 0.399 M 1 1.000 M 5 1.399 M
 
h 
 
Added N2
 3H240 5 1.197 M
 3NH340 5 0.202 M
Note we are labeling these as ‚Äúinitial concentrations‚Äù because the system is no longer 
at equilibrium. Then

3N2403H240
 3 5
10.2022 2
11.3992 11.1972 3 5 1.70 3 1022
Since we are not given the value of K, we must calculate it from the first set of equilib-
rium concentrations:
K 5
3NH342
3N243H243 5
10.2022 2
10.3992 11.1972 3 5 5.96 3 1022
As expected, Q is less than K because the concentration of N2 was increased.
 
The system will shift to the right to come to the new equilibrium position. Rather 
than do the calculations, we simply summarize the results:
Equilibrium Position I
Equilibrium Position II
[N2] 5 0.399 M
1.000 mol/L
of N2 added
[N2] 5 1.348 M
[H2] 5 1.197 M
[H2] 5 1.044 M
[NH3] 5 0.202 M
[NH3] 5 0.304 M
Note from these data that the equilibrium position does in fact shift to the right: The 
concentration of H2 decreases, the concentration of NH3 increases, and, of course, 
since nitrogen is added, the concentration of N2 shows an increase relative to the 
amount present in the original equilibrium position. (However, notice that the nitrogen 
showed a decrease relative to the amount present immediately after addition of the 
1.000 mole of N2.)
 
We can understand this shift by thinking about reaction rates. When we add N2 
molecules to the system, the number of collisions between N2 and H2 will increase, 
thus increasing the rate of the forward reaction and in turn increasing the rate of forma-
tion of NH3 molecules. More NH3 molecules will in turn lead to a higher rate for the 
reverse reaction. Eventually, the forward and reverse reaction rates will again become 
equal, and the system will reach its new equilibrium position.
 
We can predict this shift qualitatively by using Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs principle. Since the 
change imposed is the addition of nitrogen, Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs principle predicts that  
the system will shift in a direction that consumes nitrogen. This reduces the effect of 
the addition. Thus Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs principle correctly predicts that adding nitrogen will 
cause the equilibrium to shift to the right (Fig. 13.9).

If ammonia had been added instead of nitrogen, the system would have shifted to 
the left to consume ammonia. So another way of stating Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs principle is to 
say that if a component (reactant or product) is added to a reaction system at equi-
librium (at constant T and P or constant T and V), the equilibrium position will 
shift in the direction that lowers the concentration of that component. If a compo-
nent is removed, the opposite effect occurs.
Using Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs Principle I
Arsenic can be extracted from its ores by first reacting the ore with oxygen (called 
roasting) to form solid As4O6, which is then reduced using carbon:
As4O61s2 1 6C1s2 m As41 g2 1 6CO1 g2
Predict the direction of the shift of the equilibrium position in response to each of the 
following changes in conditions.
a. Addition of carbon monoxide
b. Addition or removal of carbon or tetraarsenic hexoxide (As4O6)
c. Removal of gaseous arsenic (As4)
 
SOLUTION 
a. Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs principle predicts that the shift will be away from the substance whose 
concentration is increased. The equilibrium position will shift to the left when 
carbon monoxide is added.
b. Since the amount of a pure solid has no effect on the equilibrium position, chang-
ing the amount of carbon or tetraarsenic hexoxide will have no effect.
c. If gaseous arsenic is removed, the equilibrium position will shift to the right to 
form more products. In industrial processes, the desired product is often continu-
ously removed from the reaction system to increase the yield.
See Exercise 13.71
The system shifts in the direction that 
compensates for the imposed change.

The Effect of a Change in Pressure
Basically, there are three ways to change the pressure of a reaction system involving 
gaseous components:
1. Add or remove a gaseous reactant or product.
2. Add an inert gas (one not involved in the reaction).
3. Change the volume of the container.
We have already considered the addition or removal of a reactant or product. When an 
 inert gas is added, there is no effect on the equilibrium position. The addition of an 
inert gas increases the total pressure but has no effect on the concentrations or 
partial pressures of the reactants or products. That is, in this case the added mole-
cules do not participate in the reaction in any way and thus cannot affect the equilib-
rium in any way. Thus the system remains at the original equilibrium position.
 
When the volume of the container is changed, the concentrations (and thus the 
partial pressures) of both reactants and products are changed. We could calculate Q 
and predict the direction of the shift. However, for systems involving gaseous compo-
nents, there is an easier way: We focus on the volume. The central idea is that when 
the volume of the container holding a gaseous system is reduced, the system 
responds by reducing its own volume. This is done by decreasing the total num-
ber of gaseous molecules in the system. This is illustrated by the NO2yN2O4 system 
shown in Fig. 13.10.
 
To see that this is true, we can rearrange the ideal gas law to give
V 5 aRT
P b n
or at constant T and P,
V ~ n
That is, at constant temperature and pressure, the volume of a gas is directly propor-
tional to the number of moles of gas present.

Suppose we have a mixture of the gases nitrogen, hydrogen, and ammonia at equi-
librium (Fig. 13.11). If we suddenly reduce the volume, what will happen to the equi-
librium position? The reaction system can reduce its volume by reducing the number 
of molecules present. This means that the reaction
N21 g2 1 3H21 g2 m 2NH31 g2
will shift to the right, since in this direction four molecules (one of nitrogen and three of 
hydrogen) react to produce two molecules (of ammonia), thus reducing the total number 
of gaseous molecules present. The new equilibrium position will be farther to the right 
than the original one. That is, the equilibrium position will shift toward the side of the 
reaction involving the smaller number of gaseous molecules in the balanced equation.
The opposite is also true. When the container volume is increased, the system will shift 
so as to increase its volume. An increase in volume in the ammonia synthesis system will 
produce a shift to the left to increase the total number of gaseous molecules present.
CRITICAL THINKING You and a friend are studying for a 
chemistry exam. What if your friend says, ‚ÄúAdding an inert gas to a system of 
gaseous components at equilibrium never changes the equilibrium position‚Äù? 
How do you explain to your friend that this holds true for a system at constant 
volume but is not necessarily true for a system at constant pressure? When 
would it hold true for a system at constant pressure?
Using Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs Principle II
Predict the shift in equilibrium position that will occur for each of the following pro-
cesses when the volume is reduced.
a. The preparation of liquid phosphorus trichloride by the reaction
P41s2 1 6Cl21 g2 m 4PCl31 l 2
b. The preparation of gaseous phosphorus pentachloride according to the equation
PCl31 g2 1 Cl21 g2 m PCl51 g2
c. The reaction of phosphorus trichloride with ammonia:
PCl31 g2 1 3NH31 g2 m P1NH22 31 g2 1 3HCl1 g2
SOLUTION 
a. Since P4 and PCl3 are a pure solid and a pure liquid, respectively, we need to consider 
only the effect of the change in volume on Cl2. The volume is decreased, so the 
position of the equilibrium will shift to the right, since the reactant side contains 
six gaseous molecules and the product side has none.

container volume is decreased.

b. Decreasing the volume will shift the given reaction to the right, since the product 
side contains only one gaseous molecule while the reactant side has two.
c. Both sides of the balanced reaction equation have four gaseous molecules. A 
change in volume will have no effect on the equilibrium position. There is no 
shift in this case.
See Exercise 13.74
The Effect of a Change in Temperature
It is important to realize that although the changes we have just discussed may alter the 
equilibrium position, they do not alter the equilibrium constant. For example, the addi-
tion of a reactant shifts the equilibrium position to the right but has no effect on the 
value of the equilibrium constant; the new equilibrium concentrations satisfy the origi-
nal equilibrium constant.
 
The effect of temperature on equilibrium is different, however, because the value of 
K changes with temperature. We can use Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs principle to predict the direc-
tion of the change.
 
The synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen is exothermic. We can rep-
resent this by treating energy as a product:
N21 g2 1 3H21 g2 m 2NH31 g2 1 92 kJ
If energy is added to this system at equilibrium by heating it, Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs principle 
predicts that the shift will be in the direction that consumes energy, that is, to the left. 
Note that this shift decreases the concentration of NH3 and increases the concentrations 
Of course, energy is not a chemical  
product of this reaction, but thinking of 
it in this way makes it easy to apply Le 
Ch√¢telier‚Äôs principle.

of N2 and H2, thus decreasing the value of K. The experimentally observed change in K 
with temperature for this reaction is indicated in Table 13.3. The value of K decreases 
with  increased temperature, as predicted.
 
On the other hand, for an endothermic reaction, such as the decomposition of cal-
cium carbonate,
556 kJ 1 CaCO31s2 m CaO1s2 1 CO21 g2
an increase in temperature will cause the equilibrium to shift to the right and the value 
of K to increase.
 
In summary, to use Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs principle to describe the effect of a temperature 
change on a system at equilibrium, treat energy as a reactant (in an endothermic pro-
cess) or as a product (in an exothermic process), and predict the direction of the shift 
in the same way as when an actual reactant or product is added or removed. Although 
Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs principle cannot predict the size of the change in K, it does correctly 
predict the direction of the change.
Using Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs Principle III
For each of the following reactions, predict how the value of K changes as the tempera-
ture is increased.
a. N21 g2 1 O21 g2 m 2NO1 g2¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  DH¬∞ 5 181 kJ
b. 2SO21 g2 1 O21 g2 m 2SO31 g2¬†¬†¬†¬†DH¬∞ 5 2198 kJ
 
SOLUTION 
a. This is an endothermic reaction, as indicated by the positive value for DH8. Energy 
can be viewed as a reactant, and K increases (the equilibrium shifts to the right) 
as the  temperature is increased.
b. This is an exothermic reaction (energy can be regarded as a product). As the 
temperature is increased, the value of K decreases (the equilibrium shifts to the 
left).
See Exercises 13.79 and 13.80
 
We have seen how Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs principle can be used to predict the effect of several 
types of changes on a system at equilibrium. To summarize these ideas, Table 13.4 
shows how various changes affect the equilibrium position of the endothermic reaction

 1. Characterize a system at chemical equilibrium with 
respect to each of the following:

b. the overall composition of the reaction mixture
For a general reaction 3A1 g2 1 B1 g2 h 2C1 g2 , if

how is the value of Kp for the reversed equation related 
to the value of Kp for the initial equation?
 5. What are homogeneous equilibria? Heterogeneous 
equilibria? What is the difference in writing K expres-
sions for homogeneous versus heterogeneous reactions? 
Summarize which species are included in the K expres-
sion and which species are not included.
 6. Distinguish between the terms equilibrium constant 
and reaction quotient. When Q 5 K, what does this 
say about a reaction? When Q , K, what does this say 
about a reaction? When Q . K, what does this say 
about a reaction?
 7. Summarize the steps for solving equilibrium problems 
(see the beginning of Section 13.6). In general, when 
solving an equilibrium problem, you should always set 
up an ICE table. What is an ICE table?
 8. A common type of reaction we will study is that having 
a very small K value (K ,, 1). Solving for equilibrium 
concentrations in an equilibrium problem usually 
requires many mathematical operations to be performed. 
However, the math  involved when solving equilibrium 
problems for reactions having small K values (K ,, 1) 
is simplified. What assumption is made when solving the 
equilibrium concentrations for reactions with small K 
values? Whenever assumptions are made, they must be 
checked for validity. In general, the ‚Äú5% rule‚Äù is used to 
check the validity of assuming x (or 2x, 3x, and so on) is 
very small compared to some number. When x (or 2x, 
3x, and so on) is less than 5% of the number the assump-
tion was made against, then the assumption is said to be 
valid. If the 5% rule fails, what do you do to solve for 
the equilibrium concentrations?
 9. What is Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs principle? Consider the reaction 
2NOCl(g) 34 2NO(g) 1 Cl2(g). If this reaction is at 
equilibrium, what happens when the  following changes 
occur?
a. NOCl(g) is added.
b. NO(g) is added.
c. NOCl(g) is removed.
d. Cl2(g) is removed.
e. The container volume is decreased.
For each of these changes, what happens to the value of 
K for the reaction as equilibrium is reached again? Give 
an example of a reaction for which the  addition or 
removal of one of the reactants or products has no effect 
on the  equilibrium position.
 
In general, how will the equilibrium position of a 
gas-phase reaction be affected if the volume of the 
reaction vessel changes? Are there reactions that will 
not have their equilibria shifted by a change in volume? 
Explain. Why does changing the pressure in a rigid 
container by adding an inert gas not shift the equilib-
rium position for a gas-phase reaction?
 10. The only ‚Äústress‚Äù (change) that also changes the value 
of K is a change in temperature. For an exothermic 
reaction, how does the equilibrium position change as 
temperature increases, and what happens to the value  
of K? Answer the same questions for an endothermic 
reaction. If the value of K increases with a decrease in 
temperature, is the reaction exothermic or endothermic? 
Explain.

and D, all gases) reacting in a closed flask according to the 
equation:

answer with calculations.

 3. For the reaction H21 g2 1 I21 g2 m 2HI1 g2 , consider two 
possibilities: (a) you mix 0.5 mole of each reactant, allow the 
system to come to equilibrium, and then add another mole of 
H2 and allow the system to reach equilibrium again, or (b) you 
mix 1.5 moles of H2 and 0.5 mole of I2 and allow the system to 
reach equilibrium. Will the final equilibrium mixture be differ-
ent for the two  procedures? Explain.
 4. Given the reaction A1 g2 1 B1 g2 m C1 g2 1 D1 g2 , consider 
the following situations:
i. You have 1.3 M A and 0.8 M B initially.
ii. You have 1.3 M A, 0.8 M B, and 0.2 M C initially.
iii. You have 2.0 M A and 0.8 M B initially.
Order the preceding situations in terms of increasing equilibrium 
concentration of D. Explain your order. Then give the order in 
terms of increasing equilibrium concentration of B and explain.
 5. Consider the reaction A1 g2 1 2B1 g2 m C1 g2 1 D1 g2  in a 
1.0-L rigid flask. Answer the following questions for each 
situation (a‚Äìd):
i. Estimate a range (as small as possible) for the 
requested substance. For example, [A] could be 
between 95 M and 100 M.
ii. Explain how you decided on the limits for the esti-
mated range.
iii. Indicate what other information would enable you to 
narrow your estimated range.
iv. Compare the estimated concentrations for a through d, 
and explain any differences.
a. If at equilibrium [A] 5 1 M, and then 1 mole of C is 
added, estimate the value for [A] once equilibrium is 
reestablished.
b. If at equilibrium [B] 5 1 M, and then 1 mole of C is 
added, estimate the value for [B] once equilibrium is 
reestablished.

added, estimate the value for [C] once equilibrium is 
reestablished.
d. If at equilibrium [D] 5 1 M, and then 1 mole of C is 
added, estimate the value for [D] once equilibrium is 
reestablished.
 6. Consider the reaction A1 g2 1 B1 g2 m C1 g2 1 D1 g2 . A 
friend asks the following: ‚ÄúI know we have been told that if a 
mixture of A, B, C, and D is at equilibrium and more of A is 
added, more C and D will form. But how can more C and D 
form if we do not add more B?‚Äù What do you tell your friend?
 7. Consider the following statements: ‚ÄúConsider the reaction 
A(g) 1 B(g) m C(g), for which at equilibrium [A] 5 2 M, 
[B] 5 1 M, and [C] 5 4 M. To a 1-L container of the system at 
equilibrium, you add 3 moles of B. A possible equilibrium 
condition is [A] 5 1 M, [B] 5 3 M, and [C] 5 6 M because in 
both cases K 5 2.‚Äù Indicate everything that is correct in these 
statements and everything that is incorrect. Correct the incor-
rect statements, and explain.
 8. Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs principle is stated (Section 13.7) as follows: ‚ÄúIf 
a change is imposed on a system at equilibrium, the position of 
the equilibrium will shift in a direction that tends to reduce that 
change.‚Äù The system N21g2 1 3H21g2 m 2NH31g2  is used as 
an example in which the addition of nitrogen gas at equilib-
rium results in a decrease in H2 concentration and an increase 
in NH3 concentration. In the experiment the volume is assumed 
to be constant. On the other hand, if N2 is added to the reaction 
system in a container with a piston so that the pressure can be 
held constant, the amount of NH3 actually could decrease and 
the concentration of H2 would increase as equilibrium is rees-
tablished. Explain how this can happen. Also, if you consider 
this same system at equilibrium, the addition of an inert gas, 
holding the pressure constant, does affect the equilibrium posi-
tion. Explain why the addition of an inert gas to this system in 
a rigid container does not affect the equilibrium position.
 9. The value of the equilibrium constant K depends on which of 
the following (more than one answer may be correct)?
a. the initial concentrations of the reactants
b. the initial concentrations of the products
c. the temperature of the system
d. the nature of the reactants and products 
Explain.

H2(g) and 1.0 mole of CO2(g) are put into another flask with

tem in order for a system to reach equilibrium? Explain why 
equilibrium is not reached in an open system.

n this chapter we reencounter two very important classes of compounds, acids and 
bases. We will explore their interactions and apply the fundamentals of chemical 
equilibria discussed in Chapter 13 to systems involving proton-transfer reactions.
Acid‚Äìbase chemistry is important in a wide variety of everyday applications. There 
are complex systems in our bodies that carefully control the acidity of our blood, since 
even small deviations may lead to serious illness and death. The same sensitivity exists 
in other life forms. If you have ever had tropical fish or goldfish, you know how impor-
tant it is to monitor and control the acidity of the water in the aquarium.
Acids and bases are also important in industry. For example, the vast quantity of 
sulfuric acid manufactured in the United States each year is needed to produce fertil-
izers, polymers, steel, and many other materials.
The influence of acids on living things has assumed special importance in the 
United States, Canada, and Europe in recent years as a result of the phenomenon of 
acid rain. This problem is complex and has diplomatic and economic overtones that 
make it all the more difficult to solve.
14.1 The Nature of Acids and Bases
Acids were first recognized as a class of substances that taste sour. Vinegar tastes sour 
because it is a dilute solution of acetic acid; citric acid is responsible for the sour taste 
of a lemon. Bases, sometimes called alkalis, are characterized by their bitter taste and 
slippery feel. Commercial preparations for unclogging drains are highly basic.
The first person to recognize the essential nature of acids and bases was Svante 
Arrhenius. Based on his experiments with electrolytes, Arrhenius postulated that

acids produce hydrogen ions in aqueous solution, while bases produce hydroxide 
ions. At the time, the Arrhenius concept of acids and bases was a major step forward 
in quantifying acid‚Äìbase chemistry, but this concept is limited because it applies only 
to aqueous solutions and allows for only one kind of base‚Äîthe hydroxide ion. A 
more general definition of acids and bases was suggested by the Danish chemist 
Johannes Br√∏nsted (1879‚Äì1947) and the English chemist Thomas Lowry (1874‚Äì
1936). In terms of the Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry model, an acid is a proton (H1) donor, 
and a base is a proton acceptor. For example, when gaseous HCl dissolves in water, 
each HCl molecule donates a proton to a water molecule and so qualifies as a 
 Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry acid. The molecule that accepts the proton, in this case water, is  
a Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry base.
 
To understand how water can act as a base, we need to remember that the oxygen of 
the water molecule has two unshared electron pairs, either of which can form a  covalent 
bond with an H1 ion. When gaseous HCl dissolves, the following reaction  occurs:

Note that the proton is transferred from the HCl molecule to the water molecule to 
form H3O1, which is called the hydronium ion*. This reaction is represented in 
Fig.¬†14.1 using molecular models.
 
The general reaction that occurs when an acid is dissolved in water can best be 
represented as

This representation emphasizes the significant role of the polar water molecule in pull-
ing the proton from the acid. Note that the conjugate base is everything that remains 
of the acid molecule after a proton is lost. The conjugate acid is formed when the 
proton is transferred to the base. A conjugate acid‚Äìbase pair consists of two sub-
stances related to each other by the donating and accepting of a single proton. In Equa-
tion (14.1) there are two conjugate acid‚Äìbase pairs: HA and A2 as well as H2O and 
H3O1. This reaction is represented by molecular models in Fig. 14.2.
 
It is important to note that Equation (14.1) really represents a competition for the 
proton between the two bases H2O and A2. If H2O is a much stronger base than A2, 
that is, if H2O has a much greater affinity for H1 than does A2, the equilibrium position 
will be far to the right; most of the acid dissolved will be in the ionized form. Con-
versely, if A2 is a much stronger base than H2O, the equilibrium position will lie far to 
the left. In this case most of the acid dissolved will be present at equilibrium as HA.

The equilibrium expression for the reaction given in Equation (14.1) is
Ka 5 3H3O143A24
3HA4
5 3H143A24
3HA4
 
(14.2)
where Ka is called the acid dissociation constant. Both H3O1(aq) and H1(aq) are 
commonly used to represent the hydrated proton. In this book we will often use simply 
H1, but you should remember that it is hydrated in aqueous solutions.
 
In Chapter 13 we saw that the concentration of a pure solid or a pure liquid is 
always omitted from the equilibrium expression. In a dilute solution we can assume 
that the concentration of liquid water remains essentially constant when an acid is 
dissolved. Thus the term [H2O] is not included in Equation (14.2), and the equilib-
rium expression for Ka has the same form as that for the simple dissociation into 
ions:
HA1aq2 m H11aq2 1 A21aq2
You should not forget, however, that water plays an important role in causing the acid 
to ionize.
 
Note that Ka is the equilibrium constant for the reaction in which a proton is removed 
from HA to form the conjugate base A2. We use Ka to represent only this type of 
 reaction. Knowing this, you can write the Ka expression for any acid, even one that is 
totally unfamiliar to you. As you do Example 14.1, focus on the definition of the reac-
tion corresponding to Ka.
Acid Dissociation (Ionization) Reactions
Write the simple dissociation (ionization) reaction (omitting water) for each of the fol-
lowing acids.
a. hydrochloric acid (HCl)
b. acetic acid (HC2H3O2)
c. the ammonium ion (NH41)
d. the anilinium ion (C6H5NH31)
e. the hydrated aluminum(III) ion [Al(H2O)6]31

a. HCl1aq2 m H11aq2 1 Cl21aq2
b. HC2H3O21aq2 m H11aq2 1 C2H3O2

c. NH4

d. C6H5NH3
11aq2 m H11aq2 1 C6H5NH21aq2
e. Although this formula looks complicated, writing the reaction is simple if you 
concentrate on the meaning of Ka. Removing a proton, which can come only 
from one of the water molecules, leaves one OH2 and five H2O molecules 
attached to the Al31 ion. So the reaction is
Al1H2O2 6
311aq2 m H11aq2 1 Al1H2O2 5OH211aq2

In this chapter we will always represent an 
acid as simply dissociating. This does not 
mean we are using the Arrhenius model 
for acids. Since water does not  affect the 
equilibrium position, it is simply easier 
to leave it out of the acid  dissociation 
reaction.

The Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry model is not limited to aqueous solutions; it can be extended 
to reactions in the gas phase. For example, we discussed the reaction between gaseous 
hydrogen chloride and ammonia when we studied diffusion (see Section 5.7):
NH31 g2 1 HCl1 g2 m NH4Cl1s2
In this reaction, a proton is donated by the hydrogen chloride to the ammonia, as

Note that this is not considered an acid‚Äìbase reaction according to the Arrhenius con-
cept. Figure 14.3 shows a molecular representation of this reaction.
14.2 Acid Strength
The strength of an acid is defined by the equilibrium position of its dissociation (ion-
ization) reaction:
HA1aq2 1 H2O1l2 m H3O11aq2 1 A21aq2
A strong acid is one for which this equilibrium lies far to the right. This means that 
almost all the original HA is dissociated (ionized) at equilibrium [Fig. 14.4(a)]. There 
is an important connection between the strength of an acid and that of its conjugate 
base. A strong acid yields a weak conjugate base‚Äîone that has a low affinity for a 
proton. A strong acid also can be described as an acid whose conjugate base is a much 
weaker base than water (Fig. 14.5). In this case the water molecules win the competi-
tion for the H1 ions.
 
Conversely, a weak acid is one for which the equilibrium lies far to the left. Most 
of the acid originally placed in the solution is still present as HA at equilibrium. That 
is, a weak acid dissociates only to a very small extent in aqueous solution [see Fig. 
14.2
A strong acid has a weak conjugate base.

14.4(b)]. In contrast to a strong acid, a weak acid has a conjugate base that is a much 
stronger base than water. In this case a water molecule is not very successful in pulling 
an H1 ion from the conjugate base. The weaker the acid, the stronger its conjugate 
base. The various ways of describing the strength of an acid are summarized in 
Table¬†14.1.
 
The common strong acids are sulfuric acid [H2SO4(aq)], hydrochloric acid 
[HCl(aq)], nitric acid [HNO3(aq)], and perchloric acid [HClO4(aq)]. Sulfuric acid is 
actually a diprotic acid, an acid having two acidic protons. The acid H2SO4 is a strong 
acid, virtually 100% dissociated (ionized) in water:
H2SO41aq2 h H11aq2 1 HSO4
21aq2
The HSO42 ion, however, is a weak acid:
HSO4
21aq2 m H11aq2 1 SO4
221aq2
 
Most acids are oxyacids, in which the acidic proton is attached to an oxygen atom. 
The strong acids mentioned above, except hydrochloric acid, are typical examples. 
Many common weak acids, such as phosphoric acid (H3PO4), nitrous acid (HNO2), 
and hypochlorous acid (HOCl), are also oxyacids. Organic acids, those with a carbon 
atom backbone, commonly contain the carboxyl group:
O
O
H
C
Acids of this type are usually weak. Examples are acetic acid (CH3COOH), often writ-
ten HC2H3O2, and benzoic acid (C6H5COOH). Note that the remainder of the hydro-
gens in these molecules are not acidic‚Äîthey do not form H1 in water.
 
There are some important acids in which the acidic proton is attached to an atom 
other than oxygen. The most significant of these are the hydrohalic acids HX, where X 
represents a halogen atom.
 
Table 14.2 contains a list of common monoprotic acids (those having one acidic 
proton) and their Ka values. Note that the strong acids are not listed. When a strong 
acid molecule such as HCl, for example, is placed in water, the position of the disso-
ciation equilibrium
HCl1aq2 m H11aq2 1 Cl21aq2
lies so far to the right that [HCl] cannot be measured accurately. This prevents an accu-
rate calculation of Ka:

Remember that water is a stronger base than the conjugate base of a strong acid but a 
weaker base than the conjugate base of a weak acid. This leads to the following order:
Cl2 , H2O , conjugate bases of weak acids
 
Weakest bases 888888n Strongest bases
We can order the remaining conjugate bases by recognizing that the strength of an acid 
is inversely related to the strength of its conjugate base. Since from Table 14.2 we have
Ka for HF . Ka for HNO2 . Ka for HCN
the base strengths increase as follows:
F2 , NO2
2 , CN2
The combined order of increasing base strength is
Cl2 , H2O , F2 , NO2
2 , CN2

Water as an Acid and a Base
A substance is said to be amphoteric if it can behave either as an acid or as a base. 
Water is the most common amphoteric substance. We can see this clearly in the auto-
ionization of water, which involves the transfer of a proton from one water molecule 
to another to produce a hydroxide ion and a hydronium ion:

In this reaction, one water molecule acts as an acid by furnishing a proton, and the

The autoionization reaction for water
2H2O1l2 m H3O11aq2 1 OH21aq2
leads to the equilibrium expression
Kw 5 3H3O143OH24 5 3H143OH24
where Kw, called the ion-product constant (or the dissociation constant for water), 
always refers to the autoionization of water.
 
Experiment shows that at 258C in pure water,
3H14 5 3OH24 5 1.0 3 1027 M
which means that at 258C
 Kw 5 3H143OH24 5 11.0 3 10272 11.0 3 10272
 5 1.0 3 10214
LET‚ÄôS REVIEW  Using Kw
It is important to recognize the meaning of Kw. In any aqueous solution at 258C, no matter 
what it contains, the product of [H1] and [OH2] must always equal 1.0 3 10214. There are 
three possible situations:
 ¬ª a neutral solution, where [H1] 5 [OH2]
 ¬ª an acidic solution, where [H1] . [OH2]
 ¬ª a basic solution, where [OH2] . [H1]
In each case, however, at 258C,

We normally consider the pH of solutions at 258C. However, it is important to realize 
that Kw is temperature dependent.  For example, at 378C (normal body temperature) 
the value of Kw 5 2.42 3 10214. This means for a neutral solution at 378C
3H143OH24 5 2.42 3 10214 
and 
3H14 5 3OH24 5 1.55 3 1027
So the pH for a neutral solution at 378C is 6.81.
Calculating [H1] and [OH2]
Calculate [H1] or [OH2] as required for each of the following solutions at 258C, and 
state whether the solution is neutral, acidic, or basic.
a. 1.0 3 1025 M OH2
b. 1.0 3 1027 M OH2
c. 10.0 M H1
 
SOLUTION 
a. Kw 5 [H1][OH2] 5 1.0 3 10214. Since [OH2] is 1.0 3 1025 M, solving for [H1] 
gives
3H14 5 1.0 3 10214
3OH24
5 1.0 3 10214
1.0 3 1025 5 1.0 3 1029 M
‚ñ† Since [OH2] . [H1], the solution is basic.
b. As in part a, solving for [H1] gives
3H14 5 1.0 3 10214
3OH24
5 1.0 3 10214
1.0 3 1027 5 1.0 3 1027 M
‚ñ† Since [H1] 5 [OH2], the solution is neutral.
c. Solving for [OH2] gives
3OH24 5 1.0 3 10214
3H14
5 1.0 3 10214
10.0
5 1.0 3 10215 M
‚ñ† Since [H1] . [OH2], the solution is acidic.
See Exercises 14.49 and 14.50
 
Since Kw is an equilibrium constant, it varies with temperature. The effect of tem-
perature is considered in Example 14.4.
Autoionization of Water
At 608C, the value of Kw is 1 3 10213.
a. Using Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs principle, predict whether the reaction
2H2O1l2 m H3O11aq2 1 OH21aq2
is exothermic or endothermic.
b. Calculate [H1] and [OH2] in a neutral solution at 608C.

SOLUTION 
a. Kw increases from 1 3 10214 at 258C to 1 3 10213 at 608C. Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs principle 
states that if a system at equilibrium is heated, it will adjust to consume energy. 
‚ñ† Since the value of Kw increases with temperature, we must think of energy as a 
reactant, and so the process must be endothermic.
b. At 608C,
3H143OH24 5 1 3 10213
For a neutral solution,

See Exercise 14.51
14.3 The pH Scale
Because [H1] in an aqueous solution is typically quite small, the pH scale provides a 
 convenient way to represent solution acidity. The pH is a log scale based on 10, where
pH 5 2log3H14
Thus for a solution where
 3H14 5 1.0 3 1027 M
 pH 5 2127.002 5 7.00
At this point we need to discuss significant figures for logarithms. The number of 
decimal places in the log is equal to the number of significant figures in the origi-
nal number. Thus
2 significant figures
 3H14 5 1.0 3 1029 M
 pH 5 9.00
2 decimal places
Similar log scales are used for representing other quantities; for example,
 pOH 5 2log3OH24
 pK 5 2log K
Since pH is a log scale based on 10, the pH changes by 1 for every power of 10 
change in [H1]. For example, a solution of pH 3 has an H1 concentration 10 times that 
of a solution of pH 4 and 100 times that of a solution of pH 5. Also note that because 
pH is defined as 2log[H1], the pH decreases as [H1] increases. The pH scale and the 
pH values for several common substances are shown in Fig. 14.6.
 
The pH of a solution is usually measured using a pH meter, an electronic device 
with a probe that can be inserted into a solution of unknown pH. The probe contains 
an acidic aqueous solution enclosed by a special glass membrane that allows migration 
of H1 ions. If the unknown solution has a different pH from the solution in the probe, 
an electric  potential results, which is registered on the meter (Fig. 14.7).
CRITICAL THINKING What if you lived on a planet identical to 
the earth but for which room temperature was 508C? How would the pH scale 
be different?
14.3
The pH scale is a compact  
way to  represent solution  
acidity.

A
rnold Beckman died at age 104 in 
May 2004. Beckman‚Äôs leadership in 
science and business spans virtually 
the entire twentieth century. He was 
born in 1900 in Cullom, Illinois, a town 
of 500 people that had no electricity or 
telephones. Beckman says, ‚ÄúIn Cullom 
we were forced to improvise. I think it 
was a good thing.‚Äù
The son of a blacksmith, Beckman 
had his interest in science awakened at 
age nine. At that time, in the attic of his 
house he discovered J. Dorman Steele‚Äôs 
Fourteen Weeks in Chemistry, a book 
containing instructions for doing chem-
istry experiments. Beckman became so 
fascinated with chemistry that his 
father built him a small ‚Äúchemistry shed‚Äù 
in the backyard for his tenth birthday.
Beckman‚Äôs interest in chemistry was 
fostered by his high school teachers, 
and he eventually attended the Univer-
sity of Illinois, Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. He 
graduated with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in 
chemical engineering in 1922 and 
stayed one more year to get a master‚Äôs 
degree. He then went to Caltech, where 
he earned a Ph.D. and became a faculty 
member.
Beckman was always known for his 
inventiveness. As a youth he designed 
a pressurized fuel system for his Model 
T Ford to overcome problems with its 
normal gravity feed fuel system‚Äîyou 
had to back it up steep hills to keep it 
from starving for fuel. In 1927 he 
applied for his first patent: a buzzer to 
alert drivers that they were speeding.
In 1935 Beckman invented some-
thing that would cause a revolution in 
scientific instrumentation. A college 
friend who worked in a laboratory in 
the California citrus industry needed an 
accurate, convenient way to measure 
the acidity of orange juice. In response, 
Beckman invented the pH meter, which 
he initially called the acidimeter. This 
compact, sturdy device was an immedi-
ate hit. It signaled a new era in scientific 
instrumentation. In fact, business was 
so good that Beckman left Caltech to 
head his own company.
Over the years Beckman invented 
many other devices, including an 
improved potentiometer and an instru-
ment for measuring the light absorbed 
by molecules. At age 65 he  retired as 
president of Beckman Instruments 
(headquartered in Fullerton, California). 
After a merger the company became 
Beckman Coulter; it had sales of more 
than $2 billion in 2003.
After stepping down as president of 
Beckman Instruments, Beckman began 
a new career‚Äîdonating his wealth for 
the improvement of science. In 1984 he 
and Mabel, his wife of 58 years, 
donated $40 million to his alma 
mater‚Äîthe University of Illinois‚Äîto 
fund the Beckman Institute. The Beck-
mans have also funded many other 
research  institutes, including one at 
Caltech, and formed a foundation that 
currently gives $20 million each year to 
various scientific endeavors.
Arnold Beckman was a man known 
for his incredible creativity, but even 
more he was recognized as a man of 
absolute integrity. Beckman has impor-
tant words for us: ‚ÄúWhatever you do, be 
enthusiastic about it.‚Äù

Now that we have considered all the fundamental definitions relevant to acid‚Äìbase 
solutions, we can proceed to a quantitative description of the equilibria present in these 
solutions. The main reason that acid‚Äìbase problems sometimes seem difficult is that a 
typical aqueous solution contains many components, so the problems tend to be com-
plicated. However, you can deal with these problems successfully if you use the fol-
lowing general strategies:
PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY
Solving Acid‚ÄìBase Problems
 
¬ª Think chemistry. Focus on the solution components and their reactions. It will 
almost always be possible to choose one reaction that is the most important.
 
¬ª Be systematic. Acid‚Äìbase problems require a step-by-step approach.
 
¬ª Be flexible. Although all acid‚Äìbase problems are similar in many ways, impor-
tant differences do occur. Treat each problem as a separate entity. Do not try to 
force a given problem into matching any you have solved before. Look for 
both the similarities and the differences.
 
¬ª Be patient. The complete solution to a complicated problem cannot be seen 
immediately in all its detail. Pick the problem apart into its workable steps.
 
¬ª Be confident. Look within the problem for the solution, and let the problem 
guide you. Assume that you can think it out. Do not rely on memorizing solu-
tions to problems. In fact, memorizing solutions is usually detrimental because 
you tend to try to force a new problem to be the same as one you have seen 
before. Understand and think; don‚Äôt just memorize.
14.4 Calculating the pH of Strong 
Acid Solutions
When we deal with acid‚Äìbase equilibria, we must focus on the solution components 
and their chemistry. For example, what species are present in a 1.0-M solution of HCl? 
Since hydrochloric acid is a strong acid, we assume that it is completely dissociated. 
Thus although the label on the bottle says 1.0 M HCl, the solution contains virtually no 
HCl molecules. Typically, container labels indicate the substance(s) used to make up 
antilog(n) 5 log21(n)

the solution but do not necessarily describe the solution components after dissolution. 
Thus a 1.0-M HCl solution contains H1 and Cl2 ions rather than HCl molecules.
 
The next step in dealing with aqueous solutions is to determine which components 
are significant and which can be ignored. We need to focus on the major species, those 
solution components present in relatively large amounts. In 1.0 M HCl, for example, 
the major species are H1, Cl2, and H2O. Since this is a very acidic solution, OH2 is 
present only in tiny amounts and is classified as a minor species. In attacking acid‚Äì
base problems, the importance of writing the major species in the solution as the 
first step cannot be overemphasized. This single step is the key to solving these 
problems successfully.
 
To illustrate the main ideas involved, let us calculate the pH of 1.0 M HCl. We first 
list the major species: H1, Cl2, and H2O. Since we want to calculate the pH, we will 
 focus on those major species that can furnish H1. Obviously, we must consider H1 
from the dissociation of HCl. However, H2O also furnishes H1 by autoionization, 
which is often represented by the simple dissociation reaction
H2O1l2 m H11aq2 1 OH21aq2
However, is autoionization an important source of H1 ions? In pure water at 258C, 
[H1] is 1027 M. In 1.0 M HCl solution, the water will produce even less than 1027 M 
H1, since by Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs principle the H1 from the dissociated HCl will drive the 
position of the water equilibrium to the left. Thus the amount of H1 contributed by 
water is negligible compared with the 1.0 M H1 from the dissociation of HCl. There-
fore, we can say that [H1] in the solution is 1.0 M. The pH is then
pH 5 2log3H14 5 2log11.02 5 0
pH of Strong Acids
a. Calculate the pH of 0.10 M HNO3.
b. Calculate the pH of 1.0 3 10210 M HCl.
 
SOLUTION 
a. Since HNO3 is a strong acid, the major species in solution are
H1,¬†¬†NO 2
3 ,¬†¬†and¬†¬†H2O
The concentration of HNO3 is virtually zero, since the acid completely dissoci-
ates in water. Also, [OH2] will be very small because the H1 ions from the acid 
will drive the equilibrium
H2O1l2 m H11aq2 1 OH21aq2
to the left. That is, this is an acidic solution where [H1] @ [OH2], 
so [OH2]¬†!¬†1027 M. The sources of H1 are
1. H1 from HNO3 (0.10 M)
2. H1 from H2O
The number of H1 ions contributed by the autoionization of water will be very 
small compared with the 0.10 M contributed by the HNO3 and can be neglected. 
Since the dissolved HNO3 is the only important source of H1 ions in this solution,
‚ñ† 3H14 5 0.10 M¬†¬†and¬†¬†pH 5 2log10.102 5 1.00
b. Normally, in an aqueous solution of HCl the major species are H1, Cl2, and H2O. 
However, in this case the amount of HCl in solution is so small that it has no 
effect; the only major species is H2O.  
‚ñ† Thus the pH will be that of pure water, or pH 5 7.00.

14.5 Calculating the pH of Weak Acid 
Solutions
Since a weak acid dissolved in water can be viewed as a prototype of almost any 
equilibrium occurring in aqueous solution, we will proceed carefully and systematically. 
Although some of the procedures we develop here may seem unnecessary, they will 
become essential as the problems become more complicated. We will develop the neces-
sary strategies by calculating the pH of a 1.00-M solution of HF (Ka 5 7.2¬†3¬†1024).
 
The first step, as always, is to write the major species in the solution. From its 
small Ka¬†value, we know that hydrofluoric acid is a weak acid and will be dissociated 
only to a slight extent. Thus when we write the major species, the hydrofluoric acid 
will be represented in its dominant form, as HF. The major species in solution are HF 
and¬†H2O.
 
The next step (since this is a pH problem) is to decide which of the major species 
can furnish H1 ions. Actually, both major species can do so:
 HF1aq2 m H11aq2 1 F21aq2¬†¬†¬†¬†
 Ka 5 7.2 3 1024
 H2O1 l 2 m H11aq2 1 OH21aq2¬†¬†¬†¬† Kw 5 1.0 3 10214
In aqueous solutions, however, typically one source of H1 can be singled out as 
 dominant. By comparing Ka for HF with Kw for H2O, we see that hydrofluoric acid, 
although weak, is still a much stronger acid than water. Thus we will assume that 
hydrofluoric acid will be the dominant source of H1. We will ignore the tiny contri-
bution by water.
 
Therefore, it is the dissociation of HF that will determine the equilibrium concen-
tration of H1 and hence the pH:
HF1aq2 m H11aq2 1 F21aq2
The equilibrium expression is
Ka 5 7.2 3 1024 5 3H143F24
3HF4
 
To solve the equilibrium problem, we follow the procedures developed in Chapter 
13 for gas-phase equilibria. First, we list the initial concentrations, the concentrations 
before the reaction of interest has proceeded to equilibrium. Before any HF dissoci-
ates, the concentrations of the species in the equilibrium are
3HF40 5 1.00 M¬†¬†3F240 5 0¬†¬†3H140 5 1027 M < 0
(Note that the zero value for [H1]0 is an approximation, since we are neglecting the H1 
ions from the autoionization of water.)
 
The next step is to determine the change required to reach equilibrium. Since some 
HF will dissociate to come to equilibrium (but this amount is presently unknown), we 
let x be the change in the concentration of HF that is required to achieve equilibrium. 
That is, we assume that x mol/L HF will dissociate to produce x mol/L H1 and x mol/L 
F2 as the system adjusts to its equilibrium position. Now the equilibrium concentra-
tions can be defined in terms of x:
 3HF4 5 3HF40 2 x 5 1.00 2 x
 3F24 5 3F240 1 x 5 0 1 x 5 x
 3H14 5 3H140 1 x < 0 1 x 5 x

This expression produces a quadratic equation that can be solved using the quadratic 
formula, as for the gas-phase systems in Chapter 13. However, since Ka for HF is so 
small, HF will dissociate only slightly, and x is expected to be small. This will allow 
us to simplify the calculation. If x is very small compared to 1.00, the term in the 
denominator can be approximated as follows:
1.00 2 x < 1.00
The equilibrium expression then becomes
7.2 3 1024 5
1x2 1x2
1.00 2 x < 1x2 1x2

which yields

 x < "7.2 3 1024 5 2.7 3 1022
 
How valid is the approximation that [HF] 5 1.00 M? Because this question will 
arise often in connection with acid‚Äìbase equilibrium calculations, we will consider it 
carefully. The validity of the approximation depends on how much accuracy we 
demand for the calculated value of [H1]. Typically, the Ka values for acids are known 
to an accuracy of only about 6 5%. It is reasonable therefore to apply this figure when 
determining the validity of the approximation
3HA40 2 x < 3HA40
 
We will use the following test. First, we calculate the value of x by making the 
approximation
Ka 5
x2
3HA40 2 x <

3HA40
where 
x2 < Ka3HA40¬†¬†and¬†¬†x < "Ka3HA40
We then compare the sizes of x and [HA]0. If the expression
x
3HA40
3 100%
is less than or equal to 5%, the value of x is small enough that the approximation
3HA40 2 x < 3HA40
will be considered valid.
 
In our example,
 x 5 2.7 3 1022 mol/L
 3HA40 5 3HF40 5 1.00 mol/L

This problem illustrates all the important steps for solving a typical equilibrium 
problem involving a weak acid. These steps are summarized as follows:
PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY
Solving Weak Acid Equilibrium Problems
1. List the major species in the solution.
2. Choose the species that can produce H1, and write balanced equations for the 
reactions producing H1.
3. Using the values of the equilibrium constants for the reactions you have written, 
decide which equilibrium will dominate in producing H1.
4. Write the equilibrium expression for the dominant equilibrium.
5. List the initial concentrations of the species participating in the dominant 
equilibrium.
6. Define the change needed to achieve equilibrium; that is, define x.
7. Write the equilibrium concentrations in terms of x.
8. Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the equilibrium expression.
9. Solve for x the ‚Äúeasy‚Äù way, that is, by assuming that [HA]0 2 x < [HA]0.
10. Use the 5% rule to verify whether the approximation is valid.
11. Calculate [H1] and pH.
CRITICAL THINKING Consider two aqueous solutions of 
different weak acids, HA and HB. What if all you know about the two acids is that 
the Ka value for HA is greater than that for HB? Can you tell which of the acids is 
stronger than the other? Can you tell which of the acid solutions has the lower 
pH? Defend your answers.
The pH of Weak Acids
The hypochlorite ion (OCl2) is a strong oxidizing agent often found in household 
bleaches and disinfectants. It is also the active ingredient that forms when swimming- 
pool water is treated with chlorine. In addition to its oxidizing abilities, the hypo-
chlorite ion has a relatively high affinity for protons (it is a much stronger base  
than Cl2, for example) and forms the weakly acidic hypochlorous acid (HOCl,  
Ka 5 3.5 3 1028). Calculate the pH of a 0.100-M aqueous solution of hypochlorous 
acid.
 
SOLUTION 
 1. We list the major species. Since HOCl is a weak acid and remains mostly undis-
sociated, the major species in a 0.100-M HOCl solution are
HOCl¬†¬†and¬†¬†H2O
 2. Both species can produce H1:
 HOCl1aq2 m H11aq2 1 OCl21aq2¬†¬†¬†¬† Ka 5 3.5 3 1028
 H2O1 l 2 m H11aq2 1 OH21aq2¬†¬†¬†¬†  Kw 5 1.0 3 10214

 3. Since HOCl is a significantly stronger acid than H2O, it will dominate in the 
production of H1.
 4. We therefore use the following equilibrium expression:
Ka 5 3.5 3 1028 5 3H143OCl24
3HOCl4
 5. The initial concentrations appropriate for this equilibrium are
 3HOCl40 5 0.100 M
 3OCl240 5 0
 3H140 < 0¬†¬†¬†¬†1We neglect the contribution from H2O.2
 6. Since the system will reach equilibrium by the dissociation of HOCl, let x be the 
amount of HOCl (in mol/L) that dissociates in reaching equilibrium.
 7. The equilibrium concentrations in terms of x are
 3HOCl4 5 3HOCl40 2 x 5 0.100 2 x
 3OCl24 5 3OCl240 1 x 5 0 1 x 5 x
 3H14 5 3H140 1 x < 0 1 x 5 x
 8. Substituting these concentrations into the equilibrium expression gives
Ka 5 3.5 3 1028 5
1x2 1x2
0.100 2 x
 9. Since Ka is so small, we can expect a small value for x. Thus we make the 
approximation [HA]0 2 x < [HA]0, or 0.100 2 x < 0.100, which leads to the 
expression
Ka 5 3.5 3 1028 5
x2
0.100 2 x <
x2
0.100
Solving for x gives
x 5 5.9 3 1025
10. The approximation 0.100 2 x < 0.100 must be validated. To do this, we com-
pare x to [HOCl]0:

Since this value is much less than 5%, the approximation is considered valid.
11. We calculate [H1] and pH:

The pH of a Mixture of Weak Acids
Sometimes a solution contains two weak acids of very different strengths. This case  
is considered in Example 14.9. Note that the steps are again followed (though not 
labeled).
The same systematic approach applies to 
all solution equilibria.

The pH of Weak Acid Mixtures
Calculate the pH of a solution that contains 1.00 M HCN (Ka 5 6.2 3 10210) and 
5.00 M HNO2 (Ka 5 4.0 3 1024). Also calculate the concentration of cyanide ion 
(CN2) in this solution at equilibrium.
 
SOLUTION 
Since HCN and HNO2 are both weak acids and are largely undissociated, the major  
species in the solution are
HCN,    HNO2,    and    H2O
All three of these components produce H1:
 HCN1aq2 m H11aq2 1 CN21aq2¬†¬†¬†¬†  Ka 5 6.2 3 10210
 HNO21aq2 m H11aq2 1 NO2

 H2O1 l 2 m H11aq2 1 OH21aq2¬†¬†¬†¬†  Kw 5 1.0 3 10214
A mixture of three acids might lead to a very complicated problem. However, the situ-
ation is greatly simplified by the fact that even though HNO2 is a weak acid, it is much 
stronger than the other two acids present (as revealed by the K values). Thus HNO2 can 
be assumed to be the dominant producer of H1, and we will focus on the equilibrium 
expression
Ka 5 4.0 3 1024 5 3H143NO2

The initial concentrations, the definition of x, and the equilibrium concentrations are

Therefore,

We also want to calculate the equilibrium concentration of cyanide ion in this solu-
tion. The CN2 ions in this solution come from the dissociation of HCN:
HCN1aq2 m H11aq2 1 CN21aq2
Although the position of this equilibrium lies far to the left and does not contribute 
significantly to [H1], HCN is the only source of CN2. Thus we must consider the 
extent of the dissociation of HCN to calculate [CN2]. The equilibrium expression for 
the preceding reaction is
Ka 5 6.2 3 10210 5 3H143CN24
3HCN4
We know [H1] for this solution from the results of the first part of the problem. It is 
important to understand that there is only one kind of H1 in this solution. It does not 
matter from which acid the H1 ions originate. The equilibrium [H1] we need to insert 
into the HCN equilibrium expression is 4.5 3 1022 M, even though the H1 was con-
tributed almost entirely from the dissociation of HNO2. What is [HCN] at equilibrium? 
We know [HCN]0 5 1.00 M, and since Ka for HCN is so small, a negligible amount of 
HCN will dissociate. Thus
3HCN4 5 3HCN40 2 amount of HCN dissociated < 3HCN40 5 1.00 M
Since [H1] and [HCN] are known, we can find [CN2] from the equilibrium expression:
Ka 5 6.2 3 10210 5 3H143CN24
3HCN4
5 14.5 3 10222 3CN24
1.00
‚ñ† 3CN24 5 16.2 3 102102 11.002
4.5 3 1022
5 1.4 3 1028 M
 
Note the significance of this result. Since [CN2] 5 1.4 3 1028 M and HCN is the 
only source of CN2, this means that only 1.4 3 1028 mol/L of HCN dissociated. This 
is a very small amount compared with the initial concentration of HCN, which is 
exactly what we would expect from its very small Ka value, and [HCN] 5 1.00 M as 
assumed.
See Exercises 14.73 and 14.74
Percent Dissociation
It is often useful to specify the amount of weak acid that has dissociated in achieving 
equilibrium in an aqueous solution. The percent dissociation is defined as follows:
Percent dissociation 5 amount dissociated 1mol/L2
initial concentration 1mol/L2 3 100% 
(14.5)
For example, we found earlier that in a 1.00-M solution of HF, [H1] 5 2.7 3 1022 M. 
To reach equilibrium, 2.7 3 1022 mol/L of the original 1.00 M HF dissociates, so
Percent dissociation 5 2.7 3 1022 mol/L
1.00 mol/L
3 100% 5 2.7%
 
For a given weak acid, the percent dissociation increases as the acid becomes more 
dilute. For example, the percent dissociation of acetic acid (HC2H3O2, Ka 5 1.8 3 
1025) is significantly greater in a 0.10-M solution than in a 1.0-M solution, as demon-
strated in Example 14.10.
Percent dissociation is also known as 
percent ionization.

Calculating Percent Dissociation
Calculate the percent dissociation of acetic acid (Ka 5 1.8 3 1025) in each of the fol-
lowing solutions:
a. 1.00 M HC2H3O2
b. 0.100 M HC2H3O2
 
SOLUTION 
a. Since acetic acid is a weak acid, the major species in this solution are HC2H3O2 and 
H2O. Both species are weak acids, but acetic acid is a much stronger acid than 
water. Thus the dominant equilibrium will be
HC2H3O21aq2 m H11aq2 1 C2H3O2

and the equilibrium expression is

The results in Example 14.10 show two important facts. The concentration of 
H1 ion at equilibrium is smaller in the 0.10-M acetic acid solution than in the 1.0-M 
acetic acid solution, as we would expect. However, the percent dissociation is signifi-
cantly greater in the 0.10-M solution than in the 1.0-M solution. This is a general 
result. For solutions of any weak acid HA, [H1] decreases as [HA]0 decreases, but the 
percent dissociation increases as [HA]0 decreases. This phenomenon can be explained 
as  follows.
 
Consider the weak acid HA with the initial concentration [HA]0, where at 
equilibrium
 3HA4 5 3HA40 2 x < 3HA40
 3H14 5 3A24 5 x
Thus 
Ka 5 3H143A24

Now suppose enough water is added suddenly to dilute the solution by a factor of 10. 
The new concentrations before any adjustment occurs are

Since Q is less than Ka, the system must adjust to the right to reach the new equilibrium 
position. Thus the percent dissociation increases when the acid is diluted. This behav-
ior is summarized in Fig. 14.8. In Example 14.11 we see how the percent dissociation 
can be used to calculate the Ka value for a weak acid.
Calculating Ka from Percent Dissociation
Lactic acid (HC3H5O3) is a chemical that accumulates in muscle tissue during exertion. 
In a 0.100-M aqueous solution, lactic acid is 3.7% dissociated. Calculate the value of 
Ka for this acid.
 
SOLUTION 
From the small value for the percent dissociation, it is clear that HC3H5O3 is a weak acid. 
Thus the major species in the solution are the undissociated acid and water:
HC3H5O3¬†¬†and¬†¬†H2O
However, even though HC3H5O3 is a weak acid, it is a much stronger acid than water 
and will be the dominant source of H1 in the solution. The dissociation reaction is
HC3H5O31aq2 m H11aq2 1 C3H5O3
21aq2
and the equilibrium expression is
Ka 5 3H143C3H5O3

3HC3H5O34
The more dilute the weak acid solution, the 
greater is the percent dissociation.

PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY
Solving Acid‚ÄìBase Problems
1. List the major species in solution.
2. Look for reactions that can be assumed to go to completion‚Äîfor example, a strong 
acid dissociating or H1 reacting with OH2.
3. For a reaction that can be assumed to go to completion:
a. Determine the concentration of the products.
b. Write down the major species in solution after the reaction.
4. Look at each major component of the solution and decide if it is an acid or a base.
5. Pick the equilibrium that will control the pH. Use known values of the dissociation 
constants for the various species to help decide on the dominant equilibrium.
a. Write the equation for the reaction and the equilibrium expression.
b. Compute the initial concentrations (assuming the dominant equilibrium has not 
yet occurred, that is, no acid dissociation, and so on).
c. Define x.
d. Compute the equilibrium concentrations in terms of x.
e. Substitute the concentrations into the equilibrium expression, and solve for x.
f. Check the validity of the approximation.
g. Calculate the pH and other concentrations as required.
Although these steps may seem somewhat cumbersome, especially for simpler 
problems, they will become increasingly helpful as the aqueous solutions become more 
complicated. If you develop the habit of approaching acid‚Äìbase problems systematically, 
the more complex cases will be much easier to manage.

14.6 Bases
According to the Arrhenius concept, a base is a substance that produces OH2 ions in 
aqueous solution. According to the Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry model, a base is a proton accep-
tor. The bases sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) fulfill both 
criteria. They contain OH2 ions in the solid lattice and, behaving as strong electro-
lytes, dissociate completely when dissolved in aqueous solution:
NaOH1s2 h Na11aq2 1 OH21aq2
leaving virtually no undissociated NaOH. Thus a 1.0-M NaOH solution really contains 
1.0 M Na1 and 1.0 M OH2. Because of their complete dissociation, NaOH and KOH 
are called strong bases in the same sense as we defined strong acids.
 
All the hydroxides of the Group 1A elements (LiOH, NaOH, KOH, RbOH, and 
CsOH) are strong bases, but only NaOH and KOH are common laboratory reagents, 
because the lithium, rubidium, and cesium compounds are expensive. The alkaline 
earth (Group 2A) hydroxides‚ÄîCa(OH)2, Ba(OH)2, and Sr(OH)2‚Äîare also strong 
bases. For these compounds, 2 moles of hydroxide ion are produced for every mole of 
metal hydroxide dissolved in aqueous solution.
 
The alkaline earth hydroxides are not very soluble and are used only when the 
solubility factor is not important. In fact, the low solubility of these bases can some-
times be an advantage. For example, many antacids are suspensions of metal hydrox-
ides, such as aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide. The low solubility of 
these compounds prevents a large hydroxide ion concentration that would harm the 
tissues of the mouth, esophagus, and stomach. Yet these suspensions furnish plenty of 
hydroxide ion to react with the stomach acid, since the salts dissolve as this reaction 
proceeds.
 
Calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, often called slaked lime, is widely used in industry 
because it is inexpensive and plentiful. For example, slaked lime is used in scrubbing 
stack gases to remove sulfur dioxide from the exhaust of power plants and factories. In 
the scrubbing process a suspension of slaked lime is sprayed into the stack gases to 
react with sulfur dioxide gas according to the following steps:
 SO21 g2 1 H2O1 l 2 m H2SO31aq2
 Ca1OH2 21aq2 1 H2SO31aq2 m CaSO31s2 1 2H2O1 l 2
Slaked lime is also widely used in water treatment plants for softening hard water, 
which involves the removal of ions, such as Ca21 and Mg21, that hamper the action of 
detergents. The softening method most often employed in water treatment plants is the 
lime‚Äìsoda process, in which lime (CaO) and soda ash (Na2CO3) are added to the 
water. As we will see in more detail later in this chapter, the CO322 ion reacts with 
water to produce the HCO32 ion. When the lime is added to the water, it forms slaked 
lime, that is,
CaO1s2 1 H2O1 l 2 h Ca1OH2 21aq2
which then reacts with the HCO32 ion from the added soda ash and the Ca21 ion in the 
hard water to produce calcium carbonate:
Ca1OH2 21aq2 1 Ca211aq2 1 2HCO3
21aq2 h 2CaCO31s2 1 2H2O1 l 2
 
p 
 
From hard water
 
Thus, for every mole of Ca(OH)2 consumed, 1 mole of Ca21 is removed from the 
hard water, thereby softening it. Some hard water naturally contains bicarbonate ions. 
In this case, no soda ash is needed‚Äîsimply adding the lime produces the softening.
 
Calculating the pH of a strong base solution is relatively simple, as illustrated in 
Example 14.12.

In a basic solution at 258C, pH . 7.
Calcium carbonate is also used in 
scrubbing, as discussed in Section 5.10.

Although autoionization of water also produces OH2 ions, the pH will be dominated 
by the OH2 ions from the dissolved NaOH. Thus in the solution,

Note that this is a basic solution for which

The added OH2 from the salt has shifted the water autoionization equilibrium
H2O1 l 2 m H11aq2 1 OH21aq2
to the left, significantly lowering [H1] compared with that in pure water.
See Exercises 14.89 through 14.92
 
Many types of proton acceptors (bases) do not contain the hydroxide ion. However, 
when dissolved in water, these substances increase the concentration of hydroxide ion 
because of their reaction with water. For example, ammonia reacts with water as 
follows:
NH31aq2 1 H2O1 l 2 m NH4
11aq2 1 OH21aq2
The ammonia molecule accepts a proton and thus functions as a base. Water is the acid 
in this reaction. Note that even though the base ammonia contains no hydroxide ion, it 
still increases the concentration of hydroxide ion to yield a basic solution.
 
Bases such as ammonia typically have at least one unshared pair of electrons that is 
capable of forming a bond with a proton. The reaction of an ammonia molecule with a 
water molecule can be represented as follows:

where Kb always refers to the reaction of a base with water to form the conjugate 
acid and the hydroxide ion.
 
Bases of the type represented by B in Equation (14.6) compete with OH2, a very 
strong base, for the H1 ion. Thus their Kb values tend to be small (for example, for 
ammonia, Kb 5 1.8 3 1025), and they are called weak bases. The values of Kb for 
some common weak bases are listed in Table 14.3.
 
Typically, pH calculations for solutions of weak bases are very similar to those for 
weak acids, as illustrated by Examples 14.13 and 14.14.

The pH of Weak Bases I
Calculate the pH for a 15.0-M solution of NH3 (Kb 5 1.8 3 1025).
 
SOLUTION 
Since ammonia is a weak base, as can be seen from its small Kb value, most of the dis -
solved NH3 will remain as NH3. Thus the major species in solution are
NH3¬†¬†and¬†¬†H2O
Both these substances can produce OH2 according to the reactions

 Kw 5 1.0 3 10214
However, the contribution from water can be neglected, since Kb @ Kw. The equilib-
rium for NH3 will dominate, and the equilibrium expression to be used is

Example 14.13 illustrates how a typical weak base equilibrium problem should be 
solved. Note two additional important points:
1.
We calculated [H1] from Kw and then calculated the pH, but another method is 
available. The pOH could have been calculated from [OH2] and then used in 
Equation (14.3):
 pKw 5 14.00 5 pH 1 pOH
 pH 5 14.00 2 pOH
2.
In a 15.0-M NH3 solution, the equilibrium concentrations of NH41 and OH2 are 
each 1.6 3 1022 M. Only a small percentage,
1.6 3 1022

of the ammonia reacts with water. Bottles containing 15.0 M NH3 solution are 
often labeled 15.0 M NH4OH, but as you can see from these results, 15.0 M NH3 
is actually a much more accurate description of the solution contents.
A table of Kb values for bases is also given 
in Appendix 5.3.

e have seen that many bases 
have nitrogen atoms with one 
lone pair and can be viewed as substi-
tuted ammonia molecules, with the 
general formula RxNH(32x). Compounds 
of this type are called amines. Amines 
are widely distributed in animals and 
plants, and complex amines often 
serve as messengers or regulators. For 
example, in the human nervous sys-
tem, there are two amine stimulants, 
norepinephrine and adrenaline.

Ephedrine, widely used as a decon-

the peyote cactus, for centuries.

Many other drugs, such as codeine 
and quinine, are amines, but they are 
usually not used in their pure amine 
forms. Instead, they are treated with an 
acid to become acid salts. An example 
of an acid salt is ammonium chloride, 
obtained by the reaction
NH3 1 HCl h NH4Cl
Amines also can be protonated in 
this way. The resulting acid salt, written 
as AHCl (where A represents the 
amine), contains AH1 and Cl2. In gen-
eral, the acid salts are more stable and 
more soluble in water than the parent 
amines. For instance, the parent amine 
of the well-known local anesthetic 
novocaine is insoluble in water, whereas 
the acid salt is much more soluble.

Since methylamine (CH3NH2) is a weak base, the major species in solution are

14.7 Polyprotic Acids
Some important acids, such as sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and phosphoric acid (H3PO4), can 
furnish more than one proton and are called polyprotic acids. A polyprotic acid always 
dissociates in a stepwise manner, one proton at a time. For example, the diprotic (two-
proton) acid carbonic acid (H2CO3), which is so important in maintaining a constant 
pH in human blood, dissociates in the following steps:
 H2CO31aq2 m H11aq2 1 HCO3

5 5.6 3 10211
The successive Ka values for the dissociation equilibria are designated Ka1 and Ka2. 
Note that the conjugate base HCO32 of the first dissociation equilibrium becomes the 
acid in the second step.
 
Carbonic acid is formed when carbon dioxide gas is dissolved in water. In fact, the 
first dissociation step for carbonic acid is best represented by the reaction
CO21aq2 1 H2O1 l 2 m H11aq2 1 HCO3

since relatively little H2CO3 actually exists in solution. However, it is convenient to 
consider CO2 in water as H2CO3 so that we can treat such solutions using the familiar 
dissociation reactions for weak acids.
 
Phosphoric acid is a triprotic acid (three protons) that dissociates in the following 
steps:

For a typical weak polyprotic acid,
Ka1 . Ka2 . Ka3
That is, the acid involved in each step of the dissociation is successively weaker, as 
shown by the stepwise dissociation constants given in Table 14.4. These values indi-
cate that the loss of a second or third proton occurs less readily than loss of the first 
proton. This is not surprising; as the negative charge on the acid increases, it becomes 
more difficult to remove the positively charged proton.
 
Although we might expect the pH calculations for solutions of polyprotic acids to 
be complicated, the most common cases are surprisingly straightforward. To illustrate, 
we will consider a typical case, phosphoric acid, and a unique case, sulfuric acid.
Phosphoric Acid
Phosphoric acid is typical of most polyprotic acids in that the successive Ka values are 
very different. For example, the ratios of successive Ka values (from Table 14.4) are
 
Ka1
Ka2
 5 7.5 3 1023
6.2 3 1028 5 1.2 3 105
 
Ka2
Ka3
 5 6.2 3 1028
4.8 3 10213 5 1.3 3 105
Thus the relative acid strengths are
H3PO4 @ H2PO42 @ HPO422
This means that in a solution prepared by dissolving H3PO4 in water, only the first dis-
sociation step makes an important contribution to [H1]. This greatly simplifies the pH 
calculations for phosphoric acid solutions, as is illustrated in Example 14.15.
A table of Ka values for polyprotic acids is 
also given in Appendix 5.2.
For a typical polyprotic acid in water, only 
the first dissociation step is important in 
determining the pH.

SOLUTION 
The major species in solution are

None of the dissociation products of H3PO4 is written, since the Ka values are all so

These results show that the second and third dissociation steps do not make an 
important contribution to [H1]. This is apparent from the fact that [HPO422] is 
6.2 3 10‚Äì8 M, which means that only 6.2 3 1028 mol/L H2PO42 has dissociated. The 
value of [PO432] shows that the dissociation of HPO422 is even smaller. We must, 
however, use the second and third dissociation steps to calculate [HPO422] and [PO432], 
since these steps are the only sources of these ions.
See Exercises 14.107 and 14.108
CRITICAL THINKING What if the three values of Ka for 
phosphoric acid were closer to each other in value? Why would this complicate 
the calculation of the pH for an aqueous solution of phosphoric acid?

Sulfuric acid is unique among the common acids in that it is a strong acid in its first 
dissociation step and a weak acid in its second step:

Example 14.16 illustrates how to calculate the pH for sulfuric acid solutions.
The pH of Sulfuric Acid
Calculate the pH of a 1.0-M H2SO4 solution.
 
SOLUTION 
The major species in the solution are
H1,¬†¬†HSO 2
4 ,¬†¬†and¬†¬†H2O
where the first two ions are produced by the complete first dissociation step of H2SO4. 
The concentration of H1 in this solution will be at least 1.0 M, since this amount is 
produced by the first dissociation step of H2SO4. We must now answer this question: 
Does the HSO42 ion dissociate enough to produce a significant contribution to the 
concentration of H1? This question can be answered by calculating the equilibrium 
concentrations for the dissociation reactions of HSO42:
HSO4
21aq2 m H11aq2 1 SO4

Note that [H1]0 is not equal to zero, as it usually is for a weak acid, because the first 
dissociation step has already occurred. Substituting the equilibrium concentrations 
into the expression for Ka2 and making the usual approximation give

Since 1.2 3 1022 is 1.2% of 1.0, the approximation is valid according to the 5% rule. 
Note that x is not equal to [H1] in this case. Instead,

Example 14.16 illustrates the most common case for sulfuric acid in which only the 
first dissociation makes an important contribution to the concentration of H1. In solu-
tions more dilute than 1.0 M (for example, 0.10 M H2SO4), the dissociation of HSO42 
is important, and solving the problem requires use of the quadratic formula, as shown 
in Example 14.17.

If we make the usual approximation, then 0.0100 1 x < 0.0100 and 0.0100 2 x <

The calculated value of x is

This value is larger than 0.010, clearly a ridiculous result. Thus we cannot make the 
usual approximation and must instead solve the quadratic equation. The expression
1.2 3 1022 5 10.0100 1 x2 1x2
10.0100 2 x2
leads to

Note that in this case the second dissociation step produces about half as many H1 ions 
as the initial step does.
 
This problem also can be solved by successive approximations, a method illustrated 
in Appendix 1.4.
See Exercise 14.112
LET‚ÄôS REVIEW  Characteristics of Weak Polyprotic Acids
 ¬ª Typically, successive Ka values are so much smaller than the first value that only the first 
dissociation step makes a significant contribution to the equilibrium concentration of H1. 
This means that the calculation of the pH for a solution of a typical weak polyprotic acid is 
identical to that for a solution of a weak monoprotic acid.
 ¬ª Sulfuric acid is unique in being a strong acid in its first dissociation step and a weak acid 
in its second step. For relatively concentrated solutions of sulfuric acid (1.0 M or higher), 
the large concentration of H1 from the first dissociation step represses the second step, 
which can be neglected as a contributor of H1 ions. For dilute solutions of sulfuric acid, 
the second step does make a significant contribution, and the quadratic equation must 
be used to obtain the total H1 concentration.

14.8 Acid‚ÄìBase Properties of Salts
Salt is simply another name for ionic compound. When a salt dissolves in water, we 
assume that it breaks up into its ions, which move about independently, at least in 
dilute solutions. Under certain conditions, these ions can behave as acids or bases. In 
this section we explore such reactions.
Salts That Produce Neutral Solutions
Recall that the conjugate base of a strong acid has virtually no affinity for protons in 
water. This is why strong acids completely dissociate in aqueous solution. Thus, when 
anions such as Cl2 and NO32 are placed in water, they do not combine with H1 and 
have no effect on the pH. Cations such as K1 and Na1 from strong bases have no affin-
ity for H1, nor can they produce H1, so they too have no effect on the pH of an aqueous 
solution. Salts that consist of the cations of strong bases and the anions of strong 
acids have no effect on [H1] when dissolved in water. This means that aqueous solu-
tions of salts such as KCl, NaCl, NaNO3, and KNO3 are neutral (have a pH of 7).
Salts That Produce Basic Solutions
In an aqueous solution of sodium acetate (NaC2H3O2), the major species are
Na1,¬†¬†C2H3O2
2,¬†¬†and¬†¬†H2O
What are the acid‚Äìbase properties of each component? The Na1 ion has neither acid 
nor base properties. The C2H3O22 ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, a weak acid. 
This means that C2H3O22 has a significant affinity for a proton and is a base. Finally, 
water is a weakly amphoteric substance.
 
The pH of this solution will be determined by the C2H3O22 ion. Since C2H3O22 is 
a base, it will react with the best proton donor available. In this case, water is the only 
source of protons, and the reaction between the acetate ion and water is
 
C2H3O2
21aq2 1 H2O1 l 2 m HC2H3O21aq2 1 OH21aq2  
(14.7)
Note that this reaction, which yields a base solution, involves a base reacting with 
water to produce hydroxide ion and a conjugate acid. We have defined Kb as the equi-
librium constant for such a reaction. In this case,
Kb 5 3HC2H3O243OH24
3C2H3O2
24
 
The value of Ka for acetic acid is well known (1.8 3 1025). But how can we obtain 
the Kb value for the acetate ion? The answer lies in the relationships among Ka, Kb, and 
Kw. Note that when the expression for Ka for acetic acid is multiplied by the expression 
for Kb for the acetate ion, the result is Kw:
Ka 3 Kb 5 3H143C2H3O2
24
3HC2H3O24
3 3HC2H3O243OH24
3C2H3O2
24
5 3H143OH24 5 Kw
This is a very important result. For any weak acid and its conjugate base,
Ka 3 Kb 5 Kw
We can obtain a different form of this equation by taking 2log of both sides of the 
above equation. This gives the equation
pKa 1 pKb 5 pKw
At 258C, Kw 5 1.0 3 10214, so pKw 5 14.00. In solutions at 258C, we can use the 
relationship 
pKa 1 pKb 5 14.00

Thus when either Ka or Kb is known, the other can be calculated. For the acetate ion, 
since Kw 5 Kb 3 Ka (acetic acid), the Kb for acetate is:
Kb 5

Ka 1for HC2H3O22 5 1.0 3 10214
1.8 3 1025 5 5.6 3 10210
This is the Kb value for the reaction described by Equation (14.7). Note that it is 
obtained from the Ka value of the parent weak acid, in this case acetic acid. The sodium 
acetate solution is an example of an important general case. For any salt whose cation 
has neutral properties (such as Na1 or K1) and whose anion is the conjugate base 
of a weak acid, the aqueous solution will be basic. The Kb value for the anion can be 
obtained from the relationship Kb 5 KwyKa. Equilibrium calculations of this type are 
illustrated in  Example 14.18.

The major species in solution are

Since HF is a weak acid, the F2 ion must have a significant affinity for protons, and the 
dominant reaction will be
F21aq2 1 H2O1 l 2 m HF1aq2 1 OH21aq2
which yields the Kb expression
Kb 5 3HF43OH24

Base Strength in Aqueous Solutions
To emphasize the concept of base strength, let us consider the basic properties of the 
cyanide ion. One relevant reaction is the dissociation of hydrocyanic acid in water:
HCN1aq2 1 H2O1 l 2 m H3O11aq2 1 CN21aq2¬†¬†¬†¬†Ka 5 6.2 3 10210
Since HCN is such a weak acid, CN2 appears to be a strong base, showing a very high 
affinity for H1 compared to H2O, with which it is competing. However, we also need 
to look at the reaction in which cyanide ion reacts with water:
CN21aq2 1 H2O1 l 2 m HCN1aq2 1 OH21aq2
where 
Kb 5 Kw
Ka
5 1.0 3 10214
6.2 3 10210 5 1.6 3 1025
In this reaction CN2 appears to be a weak base; the Kb value is only 1.6 3 1025. What 
accounts for this apparent difference in base strength? The key idea is that in the reac-
tion of CN2 with H2O, CN2 is competing with OH2 for H1, instead of competing with 
H2O, as it does in the HCN dissociation reaction. These equilibria show the following 
relative base strengths:
OH2 . CN2 . H2O
 
Similar arguments can be made for other ‚Äúweak‚Äù bases, such as ammonia, the ace-
tate ion, the fluoride ion, and so on.
Salts That Produce Acidic Solutions
Some salts produce acidic solutions when dissolved in water. For example, when solid 
NH4Cl is dissolved in water, NH41 and Cl2 ions are present, with NH41 behaving as a 
weak acid:
NH4
11aq2 m NH31aq2 1 H11aq2
The Cl2 ion, having virtually no affinity for H1 in water, does not affect the pH of the 
solution.
 
In general, salts in which the anion is not a base and the cation is the conjugate 
acid of a weak base produce acidic solutions.
Salts as Weak Acids I
Calculate the pH of a 0.10-M NH4Cl solution. The Kb value for NH3 is 1.8 3 1025.
 
SOLUTION 
The major species in solution are
NH4
1,¬†¬†Cl2,¬†¬†and¬†¬†H2O
Note that both NH41 and H2O can produce H1. The dissociation reaction for the NH41 
ion is
NH4

for which 
Ka 5 3NH343H14

Note that although the Kb value for NH3 is given, the reaction corresponding to Kb is 
not appropriate here, since NH3 is not a major species in the solution. Instead, the 
given value of Kb is used to calculate Ka for NH41 from the relationship

Although NH41 is a very weak acid, as indicated by its Ka value, it is stronger than H2O 
and will dominate in the production of H1. Thus we will focus on the dissociation 
reaction of NH41 to calculate the pH in this solution.

See Exercise 14.118
 
A second type of salt that produces an acidic solution is one that contains a highly 
charged metal ion. For example, when solid aluminum chloride (AlCl3) is dissolved in 
water, the resulting solution is significantly acidic. Although the Al31 ion is not itself a 
Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry acid, the hydrated ion Al(H2O)631 formed in water is a weak acid:
Al1H2O2 6
311aq2 m Al1OH2 1H2O2 5
211aq2 1 H11aq2
The high charge on the metal ion polarizes the OOH bonds in the attached water mol-
ecules, making the hydrogens in these water molecules more acidic than those in free 
water molecules. Typically, the higher the charge on the metal ion, the stronger the 
acidity of the hydrated ion.
Salts as Weak Acids II
Calculate the pH of a 0.010-M AlCl3 solution. The Ka value for Al(H2O)631 is 
1.4 3 1025.
 
SOLUTION 
The major species in solution are
Al1H2O2 6
31,¬†¬†Cl2,¬†¬†and¬†¬†H2O
Since the Al(H2O)631 ion is a stronger acid than water, the dominant equilibrium is

So far we have considered salts in which only one of the ions has acidic or basic 
properties. For many salts, such as ammonium acetate (NH4C2H3O2), both ions can 
affect the pH of the aqueous solution. Because the equilibrium calculations for these 
cases can be quite complicated, we will consider only the qualitative aspects of such 
problems. We can predict whether the solution will be basic, acidic, or neutral by com-
paring the Ka value for the acidic ion with the Kb value for the basic ion. If the Ka value 
for the acidic ion is larger than the Kb value for the basic ion, the solution will be 
acidic. If the Kb value is larger than the Ka value, the solution will be basic. Equal Ka 
and Kb values mean a neutral solution. These facts are summarized in Table 14.5.
The Acid‚ÄìBase Properties of Salts
Predict whether an aqueous solution of each of the following salts will be acidic, basic, 
or neutral.
a. NH4C2H3O2    b.  NH4CN    c.  Al2(SO4)3
 
SOLUTION 
a. The ions in solution are NH41 and C2H3O22. As we mentioned previously, Ka for 
NH41 is 5.6 3 10210 and Kb for C2H3O22 is 5.6 3 10210. Thus Ka for NH41 is 
equal to Kb for C2H3O22, and the solution will be neutral (pH 5 7).
b. The solution will contain NH41 and CN2 ions. The Ka value for NH41 is  
5.6 3 10210 and
Kb 1for CN22 5
Kw
Ka 1for HCN2 5 1.6 3 1025
Since Kb for CN2 is much larger than Ka for NH41, CN2 is a much stronger base 
than NH41 is an acid. This solution will be basic.
c. The solution will contain Al(H2O)631 and SO422 ions. The Ka value for 
Al(H2O)631 is 1.4 3 1025, as given in Example 14.20. We must calculate Kb for 
SO422. The HSO42 ion is the conjugate acid of SO422, and its Ka value is Ka2 for 
sulfuric acid, or 1.2 3 1022. Therefore,
 Kb 1for SO4

Kw
Ka2 1for sulfuric acid2
 5 1.0 3 10214
1.2 3 1022 5 8.3 3 10213
 
This solution will be acidic, since Ka for Al(H2O)631 is much greater than Kb 
for SO422.

14.9 The Effect of Structure 
on¬†Acid‚ÄìBase Properties
We have seen that when a substance is dissolved in water, it produces an acidic solu-
tion if it can donate protons and produces a basic solution if it can accept protons. 
What structural properties of a molecule cause it to behave as an acid or as a base?
Any molecule containing a hydrogen atom is potentially an acid. However, many 
such molecules show no acidic properties. For example, molecules containing COH 
bonds, such as chloroform (CHCl3) and nitromethane (CH3NO2), do not produce 
acidic aqueous solutions because a COH bond is both strong and nonpolar and thus 
there is no tendency to donate protons. On the other hand, although the HOCl bond in 
gaseous hydrogen chloride is slightly stronger than a COH bond, it is much more 
polar, and this molecule readily dissociates when dissolved in water.
 
Thus there are two main factors that determine whether a molecule containing an 
XOH bond will behave as a Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry acid: the strength of the bond and the 
polarity of the bond.
 
To explore these factors let‚Äôs consider the relative acid strengths of the hydrogen 
halides. The bond polarities vary as shown
HiF . HiCl . HiBr . HiI
 
h 
h 
 
Most polar 
Least polar
because electronegativity decreases going down the group. Based on the high polarity 
of the HOF bond, we might expect hydrogen fluoride to be a very strong acid. In fact, 
among HX molecules, HF is the only weak acid (Ka 5 7.2 3 1024) when dissolved in 
water. The HOF bond is unusually strong, as shown in Table 14.7, and thus is difficult 
to break. This contributes significantly to the reluctance of the HF molecules to dis-
sociate in water.
 
Another important class of acids are the oxyacids, which as we saw in Section 14.2 
characteristically contain the grouping HOOOX. Several series of oxyacids are listed 
with their Ka values in Table 14.8. Note from these data that for a given series the acid 
strength increases with an increase in the number of oxygen atoms attached to the 
central atom. For example, in the series containing chlorine and a varying number of 
oxygen atoms, HOCl is a weak acid, but the acid strength is successively greater as the 
number of oxygen atoms increases. This happens because the very electronegative 
oxygen atoms are able to draw electrons away from the chlorine atom and the OOH 
bond (Fig. 14.9). The net effect is to both polarize and weaken the OOH bond; this 
effect becomes more important as the number of attached oxygen atoms increases. 
14.9
Further aspects of acid strengths are 
discussed in Section 20.13.

This means that a proton is most readily produced by the molecule with the largest 
number of attached oxygen atoms (HClO4).
 
This type of behavior is also observed for hydrated metal ions. Earlier in this chap-
ter we saw that highly charged metal ions such as Al31 produce acidic solutions. The 
acidity of the water molecules attached to the metal ion is increased by the attraction 
of electrons to the positive metal ion:
H
H
O
Al3+
The greater the charge on the metal ion, the more acidic the hydrated ion becomes.
 
For acids containing the HOOOX grouping, the greater the ability of X to draw 
electrons toward itself, the greater the acidity of the molecule. Since the electronega-
tivity of X reflects its ability to attract the electrons involved in bonding, we might 
expect acid strength to depend on the electronegativity of X. In fact, there is an excel-
lent correlation between the electronegativity of X and the acid strength for oxyacids, 
as shown in Table 14.9.

attached to the chlorine atom increases, 
they become more effective at with-
drawing electron density from the OOH 
bond, thereby weakening and polarizing 
it. This increases the tendency for the 
molecule to produce a proton, and so its 
acid strength increases.

14.10 Acid‚ÄìBase Properties of Oxides
We have just seen that molecules containing the grouping HOOOX can behave as 
acids and that the acid strength depends on the electron-withdrawing ability of X. 
But substances with this grouping also can behave as bases if the hydroxide ion 
instead of a proton is produced. What determines which behavior will occur? The 
answer lies mainly in the nature of the OOX bond. If X has a relatively high electro-
negativity, the OOX bond will be covalent and strong. When the compound contain-
ing the HOOOX grouping is dissolved in water, the OOX bond will remain intact. 
It will be the polar and relatively weak HOO bond that will tend to break, releasing 
a proton. On the other hand, if X has a very low electronegativity, the OOX bond 
will be ionic and subject to being broken in polar water. Examples are the ionic sub-
stances NaOH and KOH that dissolve in water to give the metal cation and the 
hydroxide ion.
We can use these principles to explain the acid‚Äìbase behavior of oxides when they 
are dissolved in water. For example, when a covalent oxide such as sulfur trioxide is 
dissolved in water, an acidic solution results because sulfuric acid is formed:
SO31 g2 1 H2O1 l 2 h H2SO41aq2
The structure of H2SO4 is shown in the margin. In this case, the strong, covalent OOS 
bonds remain intact and the HOO bonds break to produce protons. Other common 
covalent oxides that react with water to form acidic solutions are sulfur dioxide, car-
bon dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide, as shown by the following reactions:
 SO21 g2 1 H2O1 l 2 h H2SO31aq2
 CO21 g2 1 H2O1 l 2 h H2CO31aq2
 2NO21 g2 1 H2O1 l 2 h HNO31aq2 1 HNO21aq2
Thus when a covalent oxide dissolves in water, an acidic solution forms. These oxides 
are called acidic oxides.
 
On the other hand, when an ionic oxide dissolves in water, a basic solution results, 
as shown by the following reactions:
 CaO1s2 1 H2O1 l 2 h Ca1OH2 21aq2
 K2O1s2 1 H2O1 l 2 h 2KOH1aq2
These reactions can be explained by recognizing that the oxide ion has a high affinity 
for protons and reacts with water to produce hydroxide ions:
O221aq2 1 H2O1 l 2 h 2OH21aq2
Thus the most ionic oxides, such as those of the Group 1A and 2A metals, produce 
basic solutions when they are dissolved in water. As a result, these oxides are called 
basic oxides. 
 
14.11 The Lewis Acid‚ÄìBase Model
We have seen that the first successful conceptualization of acid‚Äìbase behavior was 
 proposed by Arrhenius. This useful but limited model was replaced by the more gen-
eral Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry model. An even more general model for acid‚Äìbase behavior was 
suggested by G. N. Lewis in the early 1920s. A Lewis acid is an electron-pair accep-
tor, and a Lewis base is an electron-pair donor. Another way of saying this is that a 
Lewis acid has an empty atomic orbital that it can use to accept (share) an electron pair 
from a molecule that has a lone pair of electrons (Lewis base). The three models for 
acids and bases are summarized in Table 14.10.
14.10
A compound containing the HOOOX 
group will produce an acidic solution 
in water if the OOX bond is strong and 
covalent. If the OOX bond is ionic, the 
compound will produce a basic solution 
in water.

Note that Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry acid‚Äìbase reactions (proton donor‚Äìproton acceptor 
reactions) are encompassed by the Lewis model. For example, the reaction between a 
proton and an ammonia molecule, that is,

hydroxide ion:

The real value of the Lewis model for acids and bases is that it covers many reac-
tions that do not involve Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry acids. For example, consider the gas-phase

Here the electron-deficient BF3 molecule (there are only six electrons around the 
boron) completes its octet by reacting with NH3, which has a lone pair of electrons 
(Fig. 14.10). In fact, as mentioned in Chapter 8, the electron deficiency of boron tri-
fluoride makes it very reactive toward any electron-pair donor. That is, it is a strong 
Lewis acid.
 
The hydration of a metal ion, such as Al31, also can be viewed as a Lewis acid‚Äìbase 
reaction:

14.12 Strategy for Solving Acid‚ÄìBase 
Problems: A Summary
In this chapter we have encountered many different situations involving aqueous solu-
tions of acids and bases, and in the next chapter we will encounter still more. In solving 
for the equilibrium concentrations in these aqueous solutions, it is tempting to create 
a pigeonhole for each possible situation and to memorize the procedures necessary to 
deal with that particular case. This approach is just not practical and usually leads to frus-
tration: Too many pigeonholes are required‚Äîthere seems to be an infinite number of cases. 
But you can handle any case successfully by taking a systematic,  patient, and thought-
ful approach. When analyzing an acid‚Äìbase equilibrium problem, do not ask yourself 
how a memorized solution can be used to solve the problem. Instead, ask this question: 
What are the major species in the solution and what is their chemical behavior?
The most important part of doing a complicated acid‚Äìbase equilibrium problem is 
the analysis you do at the beginning of a problem.
What major species are present?
Does a reaction occur that can be assumed to go to completion?
What equilibrium dominates the solution?
Let the problem guide you. Be patient.

To summarize, the conjugate base of a weak acid is a 
weak base and the conjugate acid of a weak base is a 
weak acid (weak gives you weak). Assuming Ka for a 
monoprotic strong acid is 1 3 106, calculate Kb for the 
conjugate base of this strong acid. Why do conjugate 
bases of strong acids have no basic properties in water? 
List the conjugate bases of the six common strong 
acids. To tie it all together, some  instructors have stu-
dents think of Li1, K1, Rb1, Cs1, Ca21, Sr21, and Ba21 
as the conjugate acids of the strong bases LiOH, KOH, 
RbOH, CsOH, Ca(OH)2, Sr(OH)2, and Ba(OH)2. 
Although not technically correct, the conjugate acid 
strength of these cations is similar to the conjugate 
base strength of the strong acids. That is, these cations 
have no acidic properties in water; similarly, the conju-
gate bases of strong acids have no basic properties 
(strong gives you worthless). Fill in the blanks with the 
correct response. The conjugate base of a weak acid is a 
 base. The conjugate acid of a weak 
base is a 
 acid. The conjugate base  
of a strong acid is a 
 base. The conju-
gate acid of a strong base is a 
 acid. 
(Hint: Weak gives you weak and strong gives you 
worthless.)
 9. What is a salt? List some anions that behave as weak 
bases in water. List some anions that have no basic 
properties in water. List some cations that behave as 
weak acids in water. List some cations that have no 
acidic properties in water. Using these lists, give some 
formulas for salts that have only weak base properties 
in water. What strategy would you use to solve for the 
pH of these basic salt solutions? Identify some salts that 
have only weak acid properties in water. What strategy 
would you use to solve for the pH of these acidic salt 
 solutions? Identify some salts that have no acidic or 
basic properties in water (produce neutral solutions). 
When a salt contains both a weak acid ion and a weak 
base ion, how do you predict whether the solution pH is 
acidic, basic, or neutral?

atom?

these factors?

assumptions are generally made? What is the 5% rule? 
If the 5% rule fails, how do you calculate the pH of a

 6. Two strategies are also followed when solving for the 
pH of a base in water. What is the strategy for calculat-

bases mentioned in the text that should be committed  
to memory. Why is calculating the pH of Ca(OH)2 solu-
tions a little more difficult than calculating the pH of 
NaOH solutions?
 
Most bases are weak bases. The presence of what 
element most commonly results in basic properties for 
an organic compound? What is present on this element 
in compounds that allows it to accept a proton?

for some weak bases. What strategy is used to solve for 
the pH of a weak base in water? What assumptions are 
made when solving for the pH of weak base solutions? 
If the 5% rule fails, how do you calculate the pH of a 
weak base in water?
 7. Table 14.4 lists the stepwise Ka values for some poly-
protic acids. What is the difference between a monopro-
tic acid, a diprotic acid, and a triprotic acid? Most 
polyprotic acids are weak acids; the major exception is 
H2SO4. To solve for the pH of a solution of H2SO4, you 
must generally solve a strong acid problem as well as a 
weak acid problem. Explain. Write out the reactions 
that refer to Ka1 and Ka2 for H2SO4.
 
For H3PO4, Ka1 5 7.5 3 1023, Ka2 5 6.2 3 1028,

 8. For conjugate acid‚Äìbase pairs, how are Ka and Kb 
related? Consider the reaction of acetic acid in water

where Ka 5 1.8 3 1025.
a. Which two bases are competing for the proton?
b. Which is the stronger base?
c. In light of your answer to part b, why do we classify 
the acetate ion (CH3CO22) as a weak base? Use an 
appropriate reaction to justify your answer.
In general, as base strength increases, conjugate acid 
strength decreases. Explain why the conjugate acid of 
the weak base NH3 is a weak acid.

of NaOH(aq). Because sodium hydroxide is a base, can we 
say there is no H1, since having H1 would imply that the solu-
tion is acidic?
 8. Consider a solution prepared by mixing a weak acid HA, HCl, 
and NaA. Which of the following statements best describes 
what happens?
a. The H1 from the HCl reacts completely with the A2 from 
the NaA. Then the HA dissociates somewhat.
b. The H1 from the HCl reacts somewhat with the A2 from 
the NaA to make HA, while the HA is dissociating. Even-
tually you have equal amounts of everything.
c. The H1 from the HCl reacts somewhat with the A2 from 
the NaA to make HA while the HA is dissociating. Even-
tually all the reactions have equal rates.
d. The H1 from the HCl reacts completely with the A2 from 
the NaA. Then the HA dissociates somewhat until ‚Äútoo 
much‚Äù H1 and A2 are formed, so the H1 and A2 react to 
form HA, and so on. Eventually equilibrium is reached.

what is wrong with them.

base? Explain how the anion could behave simultaneously as 
an acid and a base.
 11. Acids and bases can be thought of as chemical opposites 
(acids are proton donors, and bases are proton acceptors). 
Therefore, one might think that Ka 5 1yKb. Why isn‚Äôt this the 
case? What is the relationship between Ka and Kb? Prove it 
with a derivation.
 12. Consider the equation:
HA(aq) 1 H2O(l) N H3O1(aq) 1 A‚Äì(aq).

uch important chemistry, including almost all the chemistry of the natural 
world, occurs in aqueous solution. We have already introduced one very sig-
nificant class of aqueous reactions, those of acids and bases. In this chapter we will 
explore more applications of acid‚Äìbase equilibria. In particular, we will examine buffered 
solutions, which contain components that enable the solution to be resistant to a change in 
pH. Buffered systems are especially important in living systems, which can survive only 
in a relatively narrow pH range. For example, although human blood contains many 
buffering systems, the most important of these consists of a mixture of carbonic acid 
(,0.0012 M) and bicarbonate ion (,0.024 M). These concentrations produce a pH of 7.4 
for normal blood. Because our cells are so sensitive to pH, it is important that this pH value 
be maintained. So when reactions occur in our bodies, such as the formation of lactic acid 
(HC3H5O3) when our muscles are exerted, the buffering systems must be capable of neu-
tralizing the effects of this acid to maintain the pH at 7.4. We will see in this chapter 
how a buffered solution can deal with added acid without a significant change in pH.
In this chapter we will also study acid‚Äìbase titrations to explore how the pH changes 
when a base is added to an acid and vice versa. This process is important because titra-
tions are often used to determine the amount of acid or base present in an unknown 
 sample. In addition, we will see how indicators can be used to mark the end point of 
an acid‚Äìbase titration.
15.1 Solutions of Acids or Bases 
Containing a Common Ion
In Chapter 14 we were concerned with calculating the equilibrium concentrations of 
species (particularly H1 ions) in solutions containing an acid or a base. In this section 
we will discuss solutions that contain not only the weak acid HA but also its salt NaA. 
Although this appears to be a new type of problem, we will see that this case can be 
handled rather easily using the procedures developed in Chapter 14.
 
Suppose we have a solution containing the weak acid hydrofluoric acid (HF,  
Ka 5 7.2 3 1024) and its salt sodium fluoride (NaF). Recall that when a salt dissolves 
in water, it breaks up completely into its ions‚Äîit is a strong electrolyte:
NaF1s2  888n Na11aq2 1 F21aq2
Since hydrofluoric acid is a weak acid and only slightly dissociated, the major species 
in the solution are HF, Na1, F2, and H2O. The common ion in this solution is F2, since 
it is produced by both hydrofluoric acid and sodium fluoride. What effect does the 
presence of the dissolved sodium fluoride have on the dissociation equilibrium of 
hydrofluoric acid?
 
To answer this question, we compare the extent of dissociation of hydrofluoric acid 
in two different solutions, the first containing 1.0 M HF and the second containing  
1.0 M HF and 1.0 M NaF. By Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs principle, we would expect the dissocia-
tion equilibrium for HF
HF1aq2 m H11aq2 1 F21aq2
in the second solution to be driven to the left by the presence of F2 ions from the NaF. 
Thus the extent of dissociation of HF will be less in the presence of dissolved NaF:
HF1aq2 m H11aq2 1 F21aq2

H+ ions present.

The shift in equilibrium position that occurs because of the addition of an ion already 
involved in the equilibrium reaction is called the common ion effect. This effect 
makes a solution of NaF and HF less acidic than a solution of HF alone.
 
The common ion effect is quite general. For example, solid NH4Cl added to a 
1.0-M NH3 solution produces additional ammonium ions:
NH4Cl1s2 h
H2O
NH4
11aq2 1 Cl21aq2
and this causes the position of the ammonia‚Äìwater equilibrium to shift to the left:
NH31aq2 1 H2O1l2 m NH4
11aq2 1 OH21aq2
This reduces the equilibrium concentration of OH2 ions.
 
The common ion effect is also important in solutions of polyprotic acids. The pro-
duction of protons by the first dissociation step greatly inhibits the succeeding disso-
ciation steps, which, of course, also produce protons, the common ion in this case. We 
will see later in this chapter that the common ion effect is also important in dealing 
with the solubility of salts.
Equilibrium Calculations
The procedures for finding the pH of a solution containing a weak acid or base plus a 
common ion are very similar to the procedures, which we covered in Chapter 14, for 
solutions containing the acids or bases alone. For example, in the case of a weak acid, 
the only important difference is that the initial concentration of the anion A2 is not 
zero in a solution that also contains the salt NaA. Example 15.1 illustrates a typical 
example using the same general approach we developed in Chapter 14.
Acidic Solutions Containing Common Ions
In Section 14.5 we found that the equilibrium concentration of H1 in a 1.0-M HF solu-
tion is 2.7 3 1022 M, and the percent dissociation of HF is 2.7%. Calculate [H1] and 
the percent dissociation of HF in a solution containing 1.0 M HF (Ka 5 7.2¬†3¬†1024) 
and 1.0 M NaF.
 
SOLUTION 
As the aqueous solutions we consider become more complex, it is more important 
than ever to be systematic and to focus on the chemistry occurring in the solution 
before thinking about mathematical procedures. The way to do this is always to write 
the major species first and consider the chemical properties of each one.
 
In a solution containing 1.0 M HF and 1.0 M NaF, the major species are
HF,¬†¬†F2,¬†¬†Na1,¬†¬†and¬†¬†H2O
We know that Na1 ions have neither acidic nor basic properties and that water is a very 
weak acid (or base). Therefore, the important species are HF and F2, which participate 
in the acid dissociation equilibrium that controls [H1] in this solution. That is, the 
position of the equilibrium
HF1aq2 m H11aq2 1 F21aq2
will determine [H1] in the solution. The equilibrium expression is
Ka 5 3H143F24
3HF4
5 7.2 3 1024
The common ion effect is an application of 
Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs principle.

1.0-M HF solution, where [H1] 5 2.7 3 1022 M and the percent dissociation is 2.7%. 
The large difference shows clearly that the presence of the F2 ions from the dissolved 
NaF greatly inhibits the dissociation of HF. The position of the acid dissociation equi-
librium has been shifted to the left by the presence of F2 ions from NaF.
See Exercises 15.27 and 15.28
15.2 Buffered Solutions
The most important application of acid‚Äìbase solutions containing a common ion is for 
buffering. A buffered solution is one that resists a change in its pH when either 
hydroxide ions or protons are added. The most important practical example of a buff-
ered solution is our blood, which can absorb the acids and bases produced in biologic 
reactions without changing its pH. A constant pH for blood is vital because cells can 
survive only in a very narrow pH range.
A buffered solution may contain a weak acid and its salt (for example, HF and NaF) 
or a weak base and its salt (for example, NH3 and NH4Cl). By choosing the appropriate 
components, a solution can be buffered at virtually any pH.
 
In treating buffered solutions in this chapter, we will start by considering the equi-
librium calculations. We will then use these results to show how buffering works. That 
is, we will answer the question: How does a buffered solution resist changes in pH 
when an acid or a base is added?
15.2
The most important buffering system in 
the blood involves HCO32 and H2CO3.

As you do the calculations associated with buffered solutions, keep in mind that 
these are merely solutions containing weak acids or bases, and the procedures required 
are the same ones we have already developed. Be sure to use the systematic approach 
introduced in Chapter 14.
The pH of a Buffered Solution I
A buffered solution contains 0.50 M acetic acid (HC2H3O2, Ka 5 1.8 3 1025) and 
0.50 M sodium acetate (NaC2H3O2). Calculate the pH of this solution.

dissociation equilibrium, which involves both HC2H3O2 and C2H3O22, will control the 
pH of the solution:

pH Changes in Buffered Solutions
Calculate the change in pH that occurs when 0.010 mole of solid NaOH is added to  
1.0 L of the buffered solution described in Example 15.2. Compare this pH change 
with that which occurs when 0.010 mole of solid NaOH is added to 1.0 L water.
 
SOLUTION 
Since the added solid NaOH will completely dissociate, the major species in solution 
before any reaction occurs are HC2H3O2, Na1, C2H3O22, OH2, and H2O. Note that the 
solution contains a relatively large amount of the very strong base hydroxide ion, 
which has a great affinity for protons. The best source of protons is the acetic acid, and 
the reaction that will occur is
OH21aq2 1 HC2H3O21aq2 h H2O1l2 1 C2H3O2
 21aq2
Although acetic acid is a weak acid, the hydroxide ion is such a strong base that the 
reaction above will proceed essentially to completion (until the OH2 ions are 
consumed).
 
The best approach to this problem involves two distinct steps: (1) assume that the 
reaction goes to completion, and carry out the stoichiometric calculations, and then (2) 
carry out the equilibrium calculations.
1. The stoichiometry problem. The stoichiometry for the reaction is shown below.

Note that 0.010 mole of HC2H3O2 has been converted to 0.010 mole of C2H3O22 by 
the added OH2.
2. The equilibrium problem. After the reaction between OH2 and HC2H3O2 is com-
plete, the major species in solution are
HC2H3O2,¬†¬†Na1,¬†¬†C2H3O2
 2,¬†¬†and¬†¬†H2O
The dominant equilibrium involves the dissociation of acetic acid.
 
This problem is then very similar to that in Example 15.2. The only difference is 
that the addition of 0.010 mole of OH2 has consumed some HC2H3O2 and produced 
some C2H3O22, yielding the following ICE table:

Examples 15.2 and 15.3 represent typical buffer problems that involve all the con-
cepts that you need to know to handle buffered solutions containing weak acids. Pay 
special attention to the following points:
1. Buffered solutions are simply solutions of weak acids or bases containing a com-
mon ion. The pH calculations on buffered solutions require exactly the same 
procedures introduced in Chapter 14. This is not a new type of problem.
2. When a strong acid or base is added to a buffered solution, it is best to deal with 
the stoichiometry of the resulting reaction first. After the stoichiometric calcula-
tions are completed, then consider the equilibrium calculations. This procedure 
can be presented as follows:
(H+/OH‚àí added)
Modified pH
Step 1
Do stoichiometry calculations to 
determine new concentrations.
Assume reaction with H+/OH‚àí
goes to completion.
Step 2
Do equilibrium calculations.

Buffering: How Does It Work?
Examples 15.2 and 15.3 demonstrate the ability of a buffered solution to absorb 
hydroxide ions without a significant change in pH. But how does a buffer work? Sup-
pose a buffered solution contains relatively large quantities of a weak acid HA and its 
conjugate base A2. When hydroxide ions are added to the solution, since the weak acid 
represents the best source of protons, the following reaction occurs:
OH21aq2 1 HA1aq2 h A21aq2 1 H2O1l2

The net result is that OH2 ions are not allowed to accumulate but are replaced by A2 ions.

The stability of the pH under these conditions can be understood by examining the 
equilibrium expression for the dissociation of HA:
Ka 5 3H143A24
3HA4
or, rearranging,
3H14 5 Ka
3HA4
3A24
In other words, the equilibrium concentration of H1, and thus the pH, is determined by 
the ratio [HA]y[A2]. When OH2 ions are added, HA is converted to A2, and the ratio 
[HA]y[A2] decreases. However, if the amounts of HA and A2 originally present are 
very large compared with the amount of OH2 added, the change in the [HA]y[A2] 
ratio will be small.
 
In Examples 15.2 and 15.3,
 3HA4
3A24 5 0.50
0.50 5 1.0   Initially
 3HA4
3A24 5 0.49
0.51 5 0.96  After adding 0.01 mol/L OH2
The change in the ratio [HA]y[A2] is very small. Thus the [H1] and the pH remain 
essentially constant.
 
The essence of buffering, then, is that [HA] and [A2] are large compared with the 
amount of OH2 added. Thus when the OH2 is added, the concentrations of HA and A2 
change, but only by small amounts. Under these conditions, the [HA]y[A2] ratio and 
thus the [H1] remain virtually constant.
OH‚àí added
The OH‚àí added changes 
HA to A‚àí, but [HA] and 
[A‚àí] are large compared 
to the [OH‚àí] added.

Similar reasoning applies when protons are added to a buffered solution of a weak 
acid and a salt of its conjugate base. Because the A2 ion has a high affinity for H1, the 
added H1 ions react with A2 to form the weak acid:
H11aq2 1 A21aq2 h HA1aq2
and free H1 ions do not accumulate. In this case there will be a net change of A2 to 
HA. However, if [A2] and [HA] are large compared with the [H1] added, little change 
in the pH will occur.
In a buffered solution the pH is governed 
by the ratio [HA]y[A2].

(15.1)
is often useful for calculating [H1] in a buffered solution, since [HA] and [A2] are 
known. For example, to calculate [H1] in a buffered solution containing 0.10 M HF 
(Ka¬†5 7.2¬†3¬†1024) and 0.30 M NaF, we simply substitute into Equation (15.1):

Another useful form of Equation (15.1) can be obtained by taking the negative log of 
both sides:

That is, 
pH 5 pKa 2 log a

or, where inverting the log term reverses the sign:
 
pH 5 pKa 1 log a
3A24
3HA4b 5 pKa 1 log a
3base4
3acid4 b 
(15.2)
This log form of the expression for Ka is called the Henderson‚ÄìHasselbalch equation 
and is useful for calculating the pH of solutions when the ratio [HA]y[A2] is known.
 
For a particular buffering system (conjugate acid‚Äìbase pair), all solutions that 
have the same ratio [A2]y[HA] will have the same pH. For example, a buffered solu-
tion containing 5.0 M HC2H3O2 and 3.0 M NaC2H3O2 will have the same pH as one 
containing 0.050 M HC2H3O2 and 0.030 M NaC2H3O2. This can be shown as follows:

Note that in using this equation we have assumed that the equilibrium concentra-

validity of the approximations
3A24 5 3A240 1 x < 3A240¬†¬†and¬†¬†3HA4 5 3HA40 2 x < 3HA40
where x is the amount of acid that dissociates. Since the initial concentrations of HA 
and A2 are relatively large in a buffered solution, this assumption is generally 
acceptable.
The pH of a Buffered Solution II
Calculate the pH of a solution containing 0.75 M lactic acid (Ka 5 1.4 3 1024) and 
0.25 M sodium lactate. Lactic acid (HC3H5O3) is a common constituent of biologic 
systems. For example, it is found in milk and is present in human muscle tissue during 
exertion.
 
SOLUTION 
The major species in solution are
HC3H5O3,¬†¬†Na1,¬†¬†C3H5O3
2,¬†¬†and¬†¬†H2O
Since Na1 has no acid‚Äìbase properties and H2O is a weak acid or base, the pH will be 
controlled by the lactic acid dissociation equilibrium:
HC3H5O31aq2 m H11aq2 1 C3H5O3
21aq2
Ka 5 3H143C3H5O3
 24
3HC3H5O34

Since [HC3H5O3]0 and [C3H5O32]0 are relatively large,
3HC3H5O34 < 3HC3H5O340 5 0.75 M
and 
3C3H5O3

The approach needed to perform pH calculations for these systems is virtually identi-
cal to that used above. This makes sense because, as is true of all buffered solutions,  
a weak acid (BH1) and a weak base (B) are present. A typical case is illustrated in 
 Example 15.5.
The pH of a Buffered Solution III
A buffered solution contains 0.25 M NH3 (Kb 5 1.8 3 1025) and 0.40 M NH4Cl. Cal-
culate the pH of this solution.
 
SOLUTION 
The major species in solution are
NH3,¬†¬†NH4
1,¬†¬†Cl2,¬†¬†and¬†¬†H2O

Since Cl2 is such a weak base and water is a weak acid or base, the important equilib-
rium is

11aq2 1 OH21aq2
and

This case is typical of a buffered solution in that the initial and equilibrium concen-
trations of buffering materials are essentially the same.
 ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION 
There is another way of looking at this problem. Since the solution contains relatively  
large quantities of both NH41 and NH3, we can use the equilibrium
NH31aq2 1 H2O1 l 2 m NH4
11aq2 1 OH21aq2
to calculate [OH2] and then calculate [H1] from Kw as we have just done. Or we can 
use the dissociation equilibrium for NH41, that is,
NH4
11aq2 m NH31aq2 1 H11aq2
to calculate [H1] directly. Either choice will give the same answer, since the same 
equilibrium concentrations of NH3 and NH41 must satisfy both equilibria.

Adding Strong Acid to a Buffered Solution I
Calculate the pH of the solution that results when 0.10 mole of gaseous HCl is added 
to 1.0 L of the buffered solution from Example 15.5.
 
SOLUTION 
Before any reaction occurs, the solution contains the following major species:
NH3,¬†¬†NH4
1,¬†¬†Cl2,¬†¬†H1,¬†¬†and¬†¬†H2O
 
From added HCl
What reaction can occur? We know that H1 will not react with Cl2 to form HCl. In 
contrast to Cl2, the NH3 molecule has a great affinity for protons [this is demonstrated 
by the fact that NH41 is such a weak acid (Ka 5 5.6 3 10210)]. Thus NH3 will react 
with H1 to form NH41:
NH31aq2 1 H11aq2 h NH4
11aq2
Since this reaction can be assumed to go essentially to completion to form the very 
weak acid NH41, we will do the stoichiometry calculations before we consider the 
equilibrium calculations. That is, we will let the reaction run to completion and then 
consider the  equilibrium.

LET‚ÄôS REVIEW  Summary of the Most Important Characteristics  
of Buffered Solutions
 ¬ª Buffered solutions contain relatively large concentrations of a weak acid and the 
corresponding weak base. They can involve a weak acid HA and the conjugate base A2 or 
a weak base B and the conjugate acid BH1.
 ¬ª When H1 is added to a buffered solution, it reacts essentially to completion with the weak 
base present:
H1 1 A2 h HA¬†¬†or¬†¬†H1 1 B h BH1
 ¬ª When OH2 is added to a buffered solution, it reacts essentially to completion with the 
weak acid present:
OH2 1 HA h A2 1 H2O¬†¬†or¬†¬†OH2 1 BH1 h B 1 H2O
 ¬ª The pH in the buffered solution is determined by the ratio of the concentrations of the 
weak acid and weak base. As long as this ratio remains virtually constant, the pH will 
remain virtually constant. This will be the case as long as the concentrations of the 
buffering materials (HA and A2 or B and BH1) are large compared with the amounts of H1 
or OH2 added.
15.3 Buffering Capacity
The buffering capacity of a buffered solution represents the amount of protons or 
hydroxide ions the buffer can absorb without a significant change in pH. A buffer with 
a large capacity contains large concentrations of buffering components and so can 
absorb a relatively large amount of protons or hydroxide ions and show little pH 
change. The pH of a buffered solution is determined by the ratio [A2]y[HA]. The 
capacity of a buffered solution is determined by the magnitudes of [HA] and [A2].

A buffer with a large capacity contains 
large concentrations of the buffering 
components.

Adding Strong Acid to a Buffered Solution II
Calculate the change in pH that occurs when 0.010 mole of gaseous HCl is added to 
1.0 L of each of the following solutions:
 Solution A:¬†¬†5.00 M HC2H3O2¬†¬†and¬†¬†5.00 M NaC2H3O2
 Solution B:¬†¬†0.050 M HC2H3O2¬†¬†and¬†¬†0.050 M NaC2H3O2
For acetic acid, Ka 5 1.8 3 1025.
 
SOLUTION 
For both solutions the initial pH can be determined from the Henderson‚ÄìHasselbalch 
equation:
pH 5 pKa 1 log a
3C2H3O2
24
3HC2H3O24b
In each case, [C2H3O22] 5 [HC2H3O2]. Therefore, the initial pH for both A and B is
pH 5 pKa 1 log112 5 pKa 5 2log11.8 3 10252 5 4.74
 
After the addition of HCl to each of these solutions, the major species before any 
reaction occurs are
HC2H3O2,¬†¬†Na1,¬†¬†C2H3O2
 2,¬†¬†H1,¬†¬†Cl2,¬†¬†and¬†¬†H2O
 
From the added HCl
Will any reactions occur among these species? Note that we have a relatively large 
quantity of H1, which will readily react with any effective base. We know that Cl2 will 
not react with H1 to form HCl in water. However, C2H3O22 will react with H1 to form 
the weak acid HC2H3O2:
H11aq2 1 C2H3O2
21aq2 h HC2H3O21aq2
Because HC2H3O2 is a weak acid, we assume that this reaction runs to completion;  
the 0.010 mole of added H1 will convert 0.010 mole of C2H3O22 to 0.010 mole of 
HC2H3O2.
 
For solution A (since the solution volume is 1.0 L, the number of moles equals the 
molarity), the following calculations apply:

Although the pH change for solution B is small, a change did occur, which is in con-
trast to solution A.
 
These results show that solution A, which contains much larger quantities of buffer-
ing components, has a much higher buffering capacity than solution B.
See Exercises 15.43 and 15.44
 
We have seen that the pH of a buffered solution depends on the ratio of the concen-
trations of buffering components. When this ratio is least affected by added protons or 
 hydroxide ions, the solution is the most resistant to a change in pH. To find the ratio 
that gives optimal buffering, let‚Äôs suppose we have a buffered solution containing a 
large  concentration of acetate ion and only a small concentration of acetic acid. Addi-
tion of protons to form acetic acid will produce a relatively large percent change in the 
concentration of acetic acid and so will produce a relatively large change in the ratio 
[C2H3O22]y[HC2H3O2] (Table 15.1). Similarly, if hydroxide ions are added to remove 
some acetic acid, the percent change in the concentration of acetic acid is again large. 
The same effects are seen if the initial concentration of acetic acid is large and that of 
acetate ion is small.
 
Because large changes in the ratio [A2]y[HA] will produce large changes in pH, we 
want to avoid this situation for the most effective buffering. This type of reasoning 
leads us to the general conclusion that optimal buffering occurs when [HA] is equal  
to [A2]. It is for this condition that the ratio [A2]y[HA] is most resistant to change 
when H1 or OH2 is added to the buffered solution. This means that when choosing the 
buffering components for a specific application, we want [A2]y[HA] to equal 1. It fol-
lows that since
pH 5 pKa 1 log a
3A24
3HA4b 5 pKa 1 log112 5 pKa
the pKa of the weak acid to be used in the buffer should be as close as possible  
to the  desired pH. For example, suppose we need a buffered solution with a pH of 
4.00. The most effective buffering will occur when [HA] is equal to [A2]. From the 
Henderson‚ÄìHasselbalch equation,

That is, 4.00 5 pKa 1 log(1) 5 pKa 1 0  and  pKa 5 4.00
Thus the best choice of a weak acid is one that has pKa 5 4.00 or Ka 5 1.0 3 1024.
CRITICAL THINKING The text states that ‚Äúthe pKa for a weak acid 
to be used in the buffer should be as close as possible to the desired pH.‚Äù What is 
the problem with choosing a weak acid whose pKa is not close to the desired pH 
when making a buffer?
Preparing a Buffer
A chemist needs a solution buffered at pH 4.30 and can choose from the following 
acids (and their sodium salts):
a. chloroacetic acid (Ka 5 1.35 3 1023)
b. propanoic acid (Ka 5 1.3 3 1025)
c. benzoic acid (Ka 5 6.4 3 1025)
d. hypochlorous acid (Ka 5 3.5 3 1028)
Calculate the ratio [HA]y[A2] required for each system to yield a pH of 4.30. Which 
system will work best?
 
SOLUTION 
A pH of 4.30 corresponds to
3H14 5 1024.30 5 antilog124.302 5 5.0 3 1025 M
Since Ka values rather than pKa values are given for the various acids, we use Equation 
(15.1)
3H14 5 Ka
3HA4
3A24
rather than the Henderson‚ÄìHasselbalch equation. We substitute the required [H1] and 
Ka for each acid into Equation (15.1) to calculate the ratio [HA]y[A2] needed in each 
case.

‚ñ† Since [HA]y[A2] for benzoic acid is closest to 1, the system of benzoic acid and 
its sodium salt will be the best choice among those given for buffering a solution at 
pH¬†4.30. This example demonstrates the principle that the optimal buffering system 
has a pKa value close to the desired pH. The pKa for benzoic acid is 4.19.

15.4 Titrations and pH Curves
As we saw in Chapter 4, a titration is commonly used to determine the amount of acid 
or base in a solution. This process involves a solution of known concentration (the 
titrant) delivered from a buret into the unknown solution until the substance being 
analyzed is just consumed. The stoichiometric (equivalence) point is often signaled by 
the color change of an indicator. In this section we will discuss the pH changes that 
occur during an acid‚Äìbase titration. We will use this information later to show how an 
appropriate indicator can be chosen for a particular titration.
The progress of an acid‚Äìbase titration is often monitored by plotting the pH of the 
solution being analyzed as a function of the amount of titrant added. Such a plot is 
called a pH curve or titration curve.
Strong Acid‚ÄìStrong Base Titrations
The net ionic reaction for a strong acid‚Äìstrong base titration is
H11aq2 1 OH21aq2 h H2O1 l 2
To compute [H1] at a given point in the titration, we must determine the amount of H1
that remains at that point and divide by the total volume of the solution. Before we 
proceed, we need to consider a new unit, which is especially convenient for titrations. 
Since titrations usually involve small quantities (burets are typically graduated in 
milliliters), the mole is inconveniently large. Therefore, we will use the millimole 
(abbreviated mmol), which, as the prefix indicates, is a thousandth of a mole:
1 mmol 5 1 mol
1000 5 1023 mol
So far we have defined molarity only in terms of moles per liter. We can now define it 
in terms of millimoles per milliliter, as shown below:
Molarity 5 mol solute
L solution 5
mol solute
1000
L solution
1000
5 mmol solute
mL solution
A 1.0-M solution thus contains 1.0 mole of solute per liter of solution or, equivalently, 
1.0 mmol of solute per milliliter of solution. Just as we obtain the number of moles of 
solute from the product of the volume in liters and the molarity, we obtain the number 
of millimoles of solute from the product of the volume in milliliters and the molarity:
Number of mmol 5 volume 1in mL2 3 molarity

¬ú CASE STUDY ¬ù Strong Acid‚ÄìStrong Base Titration
We will illustrate the calculations involved in a strong acid‚Äìstrong base titration by 
considering the titration of 50.0 mL of 0.200 M HNO3 with 0.100 M NaOH. We will 
calculate the pH of the solution at selected points during the course of the titration, 
where specific volumes of 0.100 M NaOH have been added.
A. No NaOH has been added.
Since HNO3 is a strong acid (is completely dissociated), the solution contains the 
major species
H1,¬†¬†NO3
2,¬†¬†and¬†¬†H2O
and the pH is determined by the H1 from the nitric acid. Since 0.200 M HNO3 contains

Enough OH2 has been added to react exactly with the H1 from the nitric acid. This is 
the stoichiometric point, or equivalence point, of the titration. At this point the major 
species in solution are
Na1,¬†¬†NO3
 2,¬†¬†and¬†¬†H2O
Since Na1 has no acid or base properties and NO32 is the anion of the strong acid 
HNO3 and is therefore a very weak base, neither NO32 nor Na1 affects the pH, and the 
solution is neutral (the pH is 7.00).
F. 150.0 mL (total) of 0.100 M NaOH has been added.
The stoichiometric calculations for the titration reaction are as follows:

G. 200.0 mL (total) of 0.100 M NaOH has been added.
Proceeding as for point F, the pH is found to be 12.60.
 
The results of these calculations are summarized by the pH curve shown in Fig. 
15.1. Note that the pH changes very gradually until the titration is close to the equiva-
lence point, where a dramatic change occurs. This behavior is due to the fact that early 
in the titration there is a relatively large amount of H1 in the solution, and the addition 
of a given amount of OH2 thus produces a small change in pH. However, near the 
equivalence point [H1] is relatively small, and the addition of a small amount of OH2 
produces a large change.
 
The pH curve in Fig. 15.1, typical of the titration of a strong acid with a strong base, 
has the following characteristics:
Before the equivalence point, [H1] (and hence the pH) can be calculated by divid-
ing the number of millimoles of H1 remaining by the total volume of the solution 
in milliliters.
At the equivalence point, the pH is 7.00.
After the equivalence point, [OH2] can be calculated by dividing the number 
of millimoles of excess OH2 by the total volume of the solution. Then [H1] is 
obtained from Kw.
 
The titration of a strong base with a strong acid requires reasoning very similar to 
that used above, except, of course, that OH2 is in excess before the equivalence point 
and H1 is in excess after the equivalence point. The pH curve for the titration of  
100.0 mL of 0.50 M NaOH with 1.0 M HCl is shown in Fig. 15.2.

in the titration where an amount of base 
has been added to exactly react with all 
the acid originally present.

Titrations of Weak Acids with Strong Bases
We have seen that since strong acids and strong bases are completely dissociated, the 
calculations to obtain the pH curves for titrations involving the two are quite straight-
forward. However, when the acid being titrated is a weak acid, there is a major differ-
ence: To calculate [H1] after a certain amount of strong base has been added, we must 
deal with the weak acid dissociation equilibrium. We have dealt with this same situa-
tion earlier in this chapter when we treated buffered solutions. Calculation of the pH 
curve for a titration of a weak acid with a strong base really amounts to a series of 
buffer problems. In performing these calculations it is very important to remember that 
even though the acid is weak, it reacts essentially to completion with hydroxide ion, a 
very strong base.
 
This process always involves a two-step procedure.
PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY
Calculating the pH Curve for a Weak Acid‚ÄìStrong Base Titration
1. A stoichiometry problem. The reaction of hydroxide ion with the weak acid is 
assumed to run to completion, and the concentrations of the acid remaining and the 
conjugate base formed are determined.
2. An equilibrium problem. The position of the weak acid equilibrium is determined, 
and the pH is calculated.
 
It is essential to do these steps separately. Note that the procedures necessary to do 
these calculations have all been used before.

¬ú CASE STUDY ¬ù Weak Acid‚ÄìStrong Base Titration
As an illustration, we will consider the titration of 50.0 mL of 0.10 M acetic acid 
(HC2H3O2, Ka 5 1.8 3 1025) with 0.10 M NaOH. As before, we will calculate the pH 
at various points representing volumes of added NaOH.
A. No NaOH has been added.
This is a typical weak acid calculation of the type introduced in Chapter 14. The pH is 
2.87. (Check this yourself.)
B. 10.0 mL of 0.10 M NaOH has been added.
The major species in the mixed solution before any reaction takes place are
HC2H3O2,¬†¬†OH2,¬†¬†Na1,¬†¬†and¬†¬†H2O

Since HC2H3O2 is a much stronger acid than H2O, and since C2H3O22 is the conjugate 
base of HC2H3O2, the pH will be determined by the position of the acetic acid dissocia-

This is a special point in the titration because it is halfway to the equivalence point. 
The original solution, 50.0 mL of 0.10 M HC2H3O2, contained 5.0 mmol HC2H3O2. 
Thus 5.0 mmol OH2 is required to reach the equivalence point. That is, 50 mL NaOH 
is required, since
150.0 mL2 10.10 M2 5 5.0 mmol
After 25.0 mL NaOH has been added, half the original HC2H3O2 has been converted 
to C2H3O22. At this point in the titration [HC2H3O2]0 is equal to [C2H3O22]0. We can

This is another important result: The pH at the equivalence point of a titration of 
a weak acid with a strong base is always greater than 7. This is so because the anion 
of the acid, which remains in solution at the equivalence point, is a base. In contrast, 
for the titration of a strong acid with a strong base, the pH at the equivalence point is 
7.0, because the anion remaining in this case is not an effective base.

Stoichiometry Problem
After the reaction is complete, the solution contains the major species
Na1,¬†¬†C2H3O 2
2,¬†¬†OH2,¬†¬†and¬†¬†H2O
 
There are two bases in this solution, OH2 and C2H3O22. However, C2H3O22 is a 
weak base compared with OH2. Therefore, the amount of OH2 produced by reaction 
of C2H3O22 with H2O will be small compared with the excess OH2 already in solution. 
You can verify this conclusion by looking at point E, where only 5.3 3 1026 M OH2 
was produced by C2H3O22. The amount in this case will be even smaller, since the 
excess OH2 will push the Kb equilibrium to the left.
 
Thus the pH is determined by the excess OH2:

The procedure needed here is very similar to that for point F. The pH is 12.30. (Check 
this yourself.)
 
The pH curve for this titration is shown in Fig. 15.3. It is important to note the dif-
ferences between this curve and that in Fig. 15.1. For example, the shapes of the plots 
are quite different before the equivalence point, although they are very similar after 
that point. (The shapes of the strong and weak acid curves are the same after the 
equivalence points because excess OH2 controls the pH in this region in both cases.) 
Near the beginning of the titration of the weak acid, the pH increases more rapidly than 
The pH at the equivalence point of a 
titration of a weak acid with a strong base 
is always greater than 7.

it does in the strong acid case. It levels off near the halfway point and then increases 
rapidly again. The leveling off near the halfway point is caused by buffering effects. 
Earlier in this chapter we saw that optimal buffering occurs when [HA] is equal to 
[A2]. This is exactly the case at the halfway point of the titration. As we can see from 
the curve, the pH changes least rapidly in this region of the titration.
 
The other notable difference between the curves for strong and weak acids is the 
value of the pH at the equivalence point. For the titration of a strong acid, the equiva-
lence point occurs at pH 7. For the titration of a weak acid, the pH at the equivalence 
point is greater than 7 because of the basicity of the conjugate base of the weak acid.
 
It is important to understand that the equivalence point in an acid‚Äìbase titration is 
defined by the stoichiometry, not by the pH. The equivalence point occurs when enough 
titrant has been added to react exactly with all the acid or base being titrated.
Titration of a Weak Acid
Hydrogen cyanide gas (HCN), a powerful respiratory inhibitor, is highly toxic. It is a 
very weak acid (Ka 5 6.2 3 10210) when dissolved in water. If a 50.0-mL sample of 
0.100 M HCN is titrated with 0.100 M NaOH, calculate the pH of the solution
a. after 8.00 mL of 0.100 M NaOH has been added.
b. at the halfway point of the titration.

be  obtained from the original volume and molarity:

or 
Volume of NaOH 5 25.0 mL

5.00 mmol CN2. The major species in solution at the equivalence point are

Two important conclusions can be drawn from a comparison of the titration of  
50.0 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid covered earlier in this section and that of 50.0 mL of  
0.1 M hydrocyanic acid analyzed in Example 15.9. First, the same amount of 0.1 M 
NaOH is required to reach the equivalence point in both cases. The fact that HCN is 
a much weaker acid than HC2H3O2 has no bearing on the amount of base required. It 
is the amount of acid, not its strength, that determines the equivalence point. Second, 
the pH value at the  equivalence point is affected by the acid strength. For the titration 
of acetic acid, the pH at the equivalence point is 8.72; for the titration of hydrocyanic 
acid, the pH at the equivalence point is 10.96. This difference occurs because the CN2 
ion is a much stronger base than the C2H3O22 ion. Also, the pH at the halfway point 
of the titration is much higher for HCN than for HC2H3O2, again because of the 
greater base strength of the CN2 ion (or, equivalently, the smaller acid strength of 
HCN).
 
The strength of a weak acid has a significant effect on the shape of its pH curve. 
Figure 15.4 shows pH curves for 50-mL samples of 0.10 M solutions of various acids 
titrated with 0.10 M NaOH. Note that the equivalence point occurs in each case when 
the same volume of 0.10 M NaOH has been added but that the shapes of the curves are 
dramatically different. The weaker the acid, the greater the pH value at the equivalence 
point. In particular, note that the vertical region that surrounds the equivalence point 
becomes shorter as the acid being titrated becomes weaker. We will see in the next 
section that the choice of an indicator is more limited for such a titration.
 
Besides being used to analyze for the amount of acid or base in a solution,  titrations 
can be used to determine the values of equilibrium constants, as shown in Example 
15.10.
The amount of acid present, not its 
strength, determines the equivalence 
point.

Calculation of Ka
Calculating Ka
A chemist has synthesized a monoprotic weak acid and wants to determine its Ka 
value. To do so, the chemist dissolves 2.00 mmol of the solid acid in 100.0 mL water 
and titrates the resulting solution with 0.0500 M NaOH. After 20.0 mL NaOH has been 
added, the pH is 6.00. What is the Ka value for the acid?

Titrations of Weak Bases with Strong Acids
Titrations of weak bases with strong acids can be treated using the procedures we 
introduced previously. As always, you should think first about the major species in 
solution and decide whether a reaction occurs that runs essentially to completion. If 
such a reaction does occur, let it run to completion and do the stoichiometric calcula-
tions. Finally, choose the dominant equilibrium and calculate the pH.

¬ú CASE STUDY ¬ù Weak Base‚ÄìStrong Acid Titration
The calculations involved for the titration of a weak base with a strong acid will be 
illustrated by the titration of 100.0 mL of 0.050 M NH3 with 0.10 M HCl.
A. Before the addition of any HCl.
1. Major species:
NH3¬†¬†and¬†¬†H2O
NH3 is a base and will seek a source of protons. In this case H2O is the only 
available source.
2. No reactions occur that go to completion, since NH3 cannot readily take a 
proton from H2O. This is evidenced by the small Kb value for NH3.
3. The equilibrium that controls the pH involves the reaction of ammonia with 
water:
NH31aq2 1 H2O1 l 2 m NH 4
11aq2 1 OH21aq2
Use Kb to calculate [OH2]. Although NH3 is a weak base (compared with 
OH2), it produces much more OH2 in this reaction than is produced from the 
autoionization of H2O.
B. Before the equivalence point.
1. Major species (before any reaction occurs):
NH3,¬†¬†H1,¬†¬†Cl2,¬†¬†and¬†¬†H2O

2. The NH3 will react with H1 from the added HCl:
NH31aq2 1 H11aq2 m NH4
11aq2
This reaction proceeds essentially to completion because the NH3 readily 
reacts with a free proton. This case is much different from the previous case, 
where H2O was the only source of protons. The stoichiometric calculations 
are then carried out using the known volume of 0.10 M HCl added.
3. After the reaction of NH3 with H1 is run to completion, the solution contains 
the following major species:
NH3,¬†¬†NH4
1,¬†¬†Cl2,¬†¬†and¬†¬†H2O

Note that the solution contains NH3 and NH41, and the equilibria involving

or the reaction of NH3 with H2O

C. At the equivalence point.
1. By definition, the equivalence point occurs when all the original NH3 is con-
verted to NH41. Thus the major species in solution are
NH4
 1,¬†¬†Cl2,¬†¬†and¬†¬†H2O
2. No reactions occur that go to completion.
3. The dominant equilibrium (the one that controls the [H1]) will be the disso-
ciation of the weak acid NH41, for which

3. Although NH41 will dissociate, it is such a weak acid that [H1] will be deter-
mined simply by the excess H1:

CRITICAL THINKING You have read about titrations of strong 
acids with strong bases, weak acids with strong bases, and weak bases with 
strong acids. What if you titrated a weak acid with a weak base? Sketch a 
pH curve and defend its shape. Label the equivalence point and discuss the 
possibilities for the pH value at the equivalence point.
15.5 Acid‚ÄìBase Indicators
There are two common methods for determining the equivalence point of an acid‚Äìbase 
titration:
1.
Use a pH meter (see Fig. 14.7) to monitor the pH and then plot the titration curve. 
The center of the vertical region of the pH curve indicates the equivalence point 
(for example, see Figs. 15.1 through 15.5).
2.
Use an acid‚Äìbase indicator, which marks the end point of a titration by chang-
ing color. Although the equivalence point of a titration, defined by the stoichiom-
etry, is not necessarily the same as the end point (where the indicator changes 
color), careful selection of the indicator will ensure that the error is negligible.
The most common acid‚Äìbase indicators are complex molecules that are themselves 
weak acids (represented by HIn). They exhibit one color when the proton is attached 
to the molecule and a different color when the proton is absent. For example, phenol-
phthalein, a commonly used indicator, is colorless in its HIn form and pink in its In2, 
or basic, form. The actual structures of the two forms of phenolphthalein are shown in 
Fig. 15.6.
To see how molecules such as phenolphthalein function as indicators, consider 
the following equilibrium for some hypothetical indicator HIn, a weak acid with 
Ka 5 1.0 3 1028.

By rearranging, we get

This ratio shows that the predominant form of the indicator is HIn, resulting in a red 
solution. As OH2 is added to this solution in a titration, [H1] decreases and the equi-
librium shifts to the right, changing HIn to In2. At some point in a titration, enough of 
the In2 form will be present in the solution so that a purple tint will be noticeable. That 
is, a color change from red to reddish purple will occur.
 
How much In2 must be present for the human eye to detect that the color is differ-
ent from the original one? For most indicators, about a tenth of the initial form must be 
converted to the other form before a new color is apparent. We will assume, then, that 
in the titration of an acid with a base, the color change will occur at a pH where

Bromthymol blue, an indicator with a Ka value of 1.0 3 1027, is yellow in its HIn form 
and blue in its In2 form. Suppose we put a few drops of this indicator in a strongly 
acidic solution. If the solution is then titrated with NaOH, at what pH will the indicator 
color change first be visible?

  The Henderson‚ÄìHasselbalch equation is very useful in determining the pH at which 
an indicator changes color. For example, application of Equation (15.2) to the Ka 
expression for the general indicator HIn yields
pH 5 pKa 1 log a
3In24
3HIn4b
where Ka is the dissociation constant for the acid form of the indicator (HIn). Since we 
assume that the color change is visible when
3In24
3HIn4 5 1
10
we have the following equation for determining the pH at which the color change occurs:
pH 5 pKa 1 log1 1
10 2 5 pKa 2 1
For bromthymol blue (Ka 5 1 3 1027, or pKa 5 7), the pH at the color change is
pH 5 7 2 1 5 6
as we calculated in Example 15.11.
 
When a basic solution is titrated, the indicator HIn will initially exist as In2 in solu-
tion, but as acid is added, more HIn will be formed. In this case the color change will 
be visible when there is a mixture of 10 parts In2 and 1 part HIn. That is, a color 
change from blue to blue-green will occur (see Fig. 15.7) due to the presence of some 
of the yellow HIn molecules. This color change will be first visible when
3In24
3HIn4 5 10

Note that this is the reciprocal of the ratio for the titration of an acid. Substituting this 
 ratio into the Henderson‚ÄìHasselbalch equation gives
pH 5 pKa 1 log1 10
1  2 5 pKa 1 1
For bromthymol blue (pKa 5 7), we have a color change at
pH 5 7 1 1 5 8
 
In summary, when bromthymol blue is used for the titration of an acid, the starting 
form will be HIn (yellow), and the color change occurs at a pH of about 6. When 
bromthymol blue is used for the titration of a base, the starting form is In2 (blue), and the 
color change occurs at a pH of about 8. Thus the useful pH range for bromthymol blue is
pKa1bromthymol blue2 6 1 5 7 6 1
or from 6 to 8. This is a general result. For a typical acid‚Äìbase indicator with dissocia-
tion constant Ka, the color transition occurs over a range of pH values given by  
pKa 6 1. The useful pH ranges for several common indicators are shown in Fig. 15.8.

When we choose an indicator for a titration, we want the indicator end point (where 
the color changes) and the titration equivalence point to be as close as possible. Choos-
ing an indicator is easier if there is a large change in pH near the equivalence point of 
the titration. The dramatic change in pH near the equivalence point in a strong acid‚Äì
strong base titration (see Figs. 15.1 and 15.2) produces a sharp end point; that is, the 
complete color change (from the acid-to-base or base-to-acid colors) usually occurs 
over one drop of added titrant.
 
What indicator should we use for the titration of 100.00 mL of 0.100 M HCl with 
0.100 M NaOH? We know that the equivalence point occurs at pH 7.00. In the ini-
tially acidic solution, the indicator will be predominantly in the HIn form. As OH2 
ions are added, the pH increases rather slowly at first (see Fig. 15.1) and then rises 
rapidly at the equivalence point. This sharp change causes the indicator dissociation 
equilibrium
HIn m H1 1 In2
to shift suddenly to the right, producing enough In2 ions to give a color change. Since 
we are titrating an acid, the indicator is predominantly in the acid form initially. There-
fore, the first observable color change will occur at a pH where
3In24
3HIn4 5 1
10
Thus
pH 5 pKa 1 log1 1
10 2 5 pKa 2 1
If we want an indicator that changes color at pH 7, we can use this relationship to find 
the pKa value for a suitable indicator:
pH 5 7 5 pKa 2 1¬†¬†or¬†¬†pKa 5 7 1 1 5 8
Thus an indicator with a pKa value of 8 (Ka 5 1 3 1028) changes color at about pH 7 
and is ideal for marking the end point for a strong acid‚Äìstrong base titration.
 
How crucial is it for a strong acid‚Äìstrong base titration that the indicator change 
color exactly at pH 7? We can answer this question by examining the pH change near 
the equivalence point of the titration of 100 mL of 0.10 M HCl and 0.10 M NaOH. 
The data for a few points at or near the equivalence point are shown in Table 15.3. 
Note that in going from 99.99 to 100.01 mL of added NaOH solution (about half of a 
drop), the pH changes from 5.3 to 8.7‚Äîa very dramatic change. This behavior leads 
to the following general conclusions about indicators for a strong acid‚Äìstrong base 
titration:
Indicator color changes will be sharp, occurring with the addition of a single drop 
of titrant.
There is a wide choice of suitable indicators. The results will agree within one drop 
of titrant, using indicators with end points as far apart as pH 5 and pH 9 (Fig. 15.9).
 
The titration of weak acids is somewhat different. Figure 15.4 shows that the weaker 
the acid being titrated, the smaller the vertical area around the equivalence point. This 
allows much less flexibility in choosing the indicator. We must choose an indicator 
whose useful pH range has a midpoint as close as possible to the pH at the equivalence 
point. For example, we saw earlier that in the titration of 0.1 M HC2H3O2 with 0.1 M 
NaOH the pH at the equivalence point is 8.7 (see Fig. 15.3). A good indicator choice 
would be phenolphthalein, since its useful pH range is 8 to 10. Thymol blue (changes 
color, pH 8‚Äì9) also would be acceptable, but methyl red would not. The choice of an 
indicator is illustrated graphically in Fig. 15.10.

well before the equivalence point (so the

able indicator for this titration.
15.6 Polyprotic Acid Titrations
In Chapter 14 we discussed polyprotic acids, or acids that can furnish more than one 
proton. The acid titrations we have considered so far have involved only monoprotic 
acids. When a polyprotic acid is titrated, the pH curve has similar features to those of 
a monoprotic acid, but enough differences exist to warrant special coverage.
Recall from Chapter 14 that a polyprotic acid dissociates in a stepwise manner, one 
proton at a time. In a titration of a polyprotic acid, the various acidic protons are 
titrated in succession as well.
For example, as sodium hydroxide is used to titrate phosphoric acid, the first reac-
tion that takes place can be represented as 
H3PO4(aq) 1 OH2(aq) n H2PO42(aq) 1 H2O(l)
 
This reaction occurs until the H3PO4 is consumed (to reach the first equivalence 
point). Therefore, at the first equivalence point the solution contains the major species 
Na1, H2PO42, and H2O. Then, as more sodium hydroxide is added, the reaction
H2PO42(aq) 1 OH2(aq) n HPO422(aq) 1 H2O(l)
occurs to give a solution that contains Na1, HPO422, and H2O as the major species at 
the second equivalence point. As sodium hydroxide is added beyond the second equiv-
alence point, the reaction that occurs can be represented as
HPO422(aq) 1 OH2(aq) n PO432(aq) 1 H2O(l)
 
Although we will not fully discuss the calculations involved in obtaining the pH 
curve for a polyprotic acid, the calculations are closely related to those for a monopro-
tic acid. The same principles apply, but we must be very careful in identifying which 
of the various equilibria is appropriate to use in a given case. The secret to success here 
is, as always, identifying the major species in solution at any given point in the titra-
tion. We summarize the various cases in Table 15.4 for a triprotic acid H3A with dis-
sociation constants Ka1, Ka 2, and Ka3.

Recall that at the halfway point in the titration of a monoprotic weak acid with a 
strong base, the pH of the solution is equal in value to the pKa of the weak acid. 
Through similar reasoning, it turns out that we can use a pH curve for the titration of a 
polyprotic acid with a strong base to determine the Ka values of the given acid. We can 
see this in a pH curve for the titration of the generic triprotic acid H3A with NaOH 
(Fig. 15.11).
 
Note that the pH can be easily determined at the first two equivalence points by 
using the average of the corresponding pKa values. It turns out as well that the pH 
values at the half-equivalence points can be estimated as equal to the corresponding  
pK values. Thus, pH < pKa1 for the first half-equivalence point, pH < pKa 2 at the sec-
ond half-equivalence point, and pH < pKa3 at the third half-equivalence point.
 
We can also use pH curves to easily determine the number of acidic protons on a 
particular acid. Recall that the pH curve for the titration of a monoprotic acid (one 
acidic proton, HA) has one equivalence point. The previous discussion shows that a 
pH curve for a triprotic acid (three acidic protons, H3A) has three equivalence points. 
As expected, the pH curve for the titration of a diprotic acid (two acidic protons, H2A) 
has two equivalence points. A typical pH curve for the titration curve for a diprotic 
acid is given in Fig. 15.12.
 
Note that we can determine the pH values at various points on the curve by using 
the appropriate pKa values, just as we saw with the titration of a triprotic acid.

Is it necessary that the concentrations of the weak

Explain. What is the pH of a buffer when the weak acid

A buffer generally contains a weak acid and its weak 
conjugate base, or a weak base and its weak conjugate 
acid, in water. You can solve for the pH by setting up 
the equilibrium problem using the Ka reaction of the 
weak acid or the Kb reaction of the conjugate base. Both

7. Sketch the titration curve for a weak acid titrated by a 
strong base. When performing calculations concerning 
weak acid‚Äìstrong base titrations, the general two-step 
procedure is to solve a stoichiometry problem first, 
then to solve an equilibrium problem to determine the 
pH. What reaction takes place in the stoichiometry 
part of the problem? What is assumed about this 
reaction?
At the various points in your titration curve, list the 
major species present after the strong base (NaOH, for 
example) reacts to completion with the weak acid, HA. 
What equilibrium problem would you solve at the 
various points in your titration curve to calculate the 
pH? Why is pH . 7.0 at the equivalence point of a 
weak acid‚Äìstrong base titration? Does the pH at the 
halfway point to equivalence have to be less than 7.0? 
What does the pH at the halfway point equal? Compare 
and contrast the titration curves for a strong acid‚Äì
strong base titration and a weak acid‚Äìstrong base 
titration.
8. Sketch the titration curve for a weak base titrated by a 
strong acid. Weak base‚Äìstrong acid titration problems 
also follow a two-step procedure. What reaction takes 
place in the stoichiometry part of the problem? What is 
assumed about this reaction? At the various points in 
your titration curve, list the major species present after 
the strong acid (HNO3, for example) reacts to comple-
tion with the weak base, B. What equilibrium problem 
would you solve at the various points in your titration 
curve to calculate the pH? Why is pH , 7.0 at the 
equivalence point of a weak base‚Äìstrong acid titration? 
If pH 5 6.0 at the halfway point to equivalence, what 
is the Kb value for the weak base titrated? Compare 
and contrast the titration curves for a strong base‚Äì
strong acid titration and a weak base‚Äìstrong acid 
titration.
 9. What is an acid‚Äìbase indicator? Define the equivalence 
(stoichiometric) point and the end point of a titration. 
Why should you choose an indicator so that the two 
points coincide? Do the pH values of the two points 
have to be within 60.01 pH unit of each other? 
Explain.
 10. Why does an indicator change from its acid color to its 
base color over a range of pH values? In general, when 
do color changes start to occur for indicators? Can the 
indicator thymol blue contain only a single OCO2H 
group and no other acidic or basic functional group? 
Explain.
reactions give the same answer for the pH of the solu-
tion. Explain.
 
A third method that can be used to solve for the pH 
of a buffer solution is the Henderson‚ÄìHasselbalch 
equation. What is the Henderson‚ÄìHasselbalch equa-
tion? What assumptions are made when using this 
equation?
 3. One of the most challenging parts of solving acid‚Äìbase 
problems is writing out the correct equation. When a 
strong acid or a strong base is added to solutions, they 
are great at what they do and we always react them first. 
If a strong acid is added to a buffer, what reacts with the 
H1 from the strong acid and what are the products? If a 
strong base is added to a buffer, what reacts with the 
OH2 from the strong base and what are the products? 
Problems involving the reaction of a strong acid or 
strong base are assumed to be stoichiometry problems 
and not equilibrium problems. What is assumed when a 
strong acid or strong base reacts to make it a stoichiom-
etry problem?
 4. A good buffer generally contains relatively equal 
 concentrations of weak acid and conjugate base.  
If you wanted to buffer a solution at pH 5 4.00 or  
pH 5 10.00, how would you decide which weak acid‚Äì
conjugate base or weak base‚Äìconjugate acid pair to 
use? The second characteristic of a good buffer is good 
buffering capacity. What is the capacity of a buffer? 
How do the following buffers differ in capacity? How 
do they differ in pH?
0.01 M acetic acid/0.01 M sodium acetate
0.1 M acetic acid/0.1 M sodium acetate
1.0 M acetic acid/1.0 M sodium acetate
5. Draw the general titration curve for a strong acid 
titrated by a strong base. At the various points in the 
titration, list the major species present before any reac-
tion takes place and the major species present after any 
reaction takes place. What reaction takes place in a 
strong acid‚Äìstrong base titration? How do you calculate 
the pH at the various points along the curve? What is 
the pH at the equivalence point for a strong acid‚Äìstrong 
base titration? Why?
6. Instead of the titration of a strong acid by a strong base 
considered in Question 5, consider the titration of a 
strong base by a strong acid. Compare and contrast  
a strong acid‚Äìstrong base titration with a strong base‚Äì 
strong acid titration.

Active Learning Questions
These questions are designed to be used by groups of students in 
class.
 1. What are the major species in solution after NaHSO4 is dis-
solved in water? What happens to the pH of the solution as 
more NaHSO4 is added? Why? Would the results vary if bak-

 2. A friend asks the following: ‚ÄúConsider a buffered solution 
made up of the weak acid HA and its salt NaA. If a strong base 
like NaOH is added, the HA reacts with the OH2 to form A2. 
Thus the amount of acid (HA) is decreased, and the amount of 
base (A2) is increased. Analogously, adding HCl to the buff-
ered solution forms more of the acid (HA) by reacting with the 
base (A2). Thus how can we claim that a buffered solution 
resists changes in the pH of the solution?‚Äù How would you 
explain buffering to this friend?

M
ost of the chemistry of the natural world occurs in aqueous solution. We 
have already introduced one very significant class of aqueous equilibria, 
acid‚Äìbase reactions. In this chapter we will consider more applications of aqueous 
equilibria, those involving the solubility of salts and those involving the formation of 
complex ions.
The interplay of acid‚Äìbase, solubility, and complex ion equilibria is often important 
in natural processes, such as the weathering of minerals, the uptake of nutrients by 
plants, and tooth decay. For example, limestone (CaCO3) will dissolve in water made 
acidic by dissolved carbon dioxide:
 CO21aq2 1 H2O1 l 2 m H11aq2 1 HCO3
21aq2
 H11aq2 1 CaCO31s2 m Ca211aq2 1 HCO3
21aq2
This two-step process and its reverse account for the formation of limestone caves 
and the stalactites and stalagmites found therein. In the forward direction of the pro-
cess, the acidic water (containing carbon dioxide) dissolves the underground lime-
stone deposits, thereby forming a cavern. The reverse process occurs as the water drips 
from the ceiling of the cave, and the carbon dioxide is lost to the air. This causes solid 
calcium carbonate to form, producing stalactites on the ceiling and stalagmites where 
the drops hit the cave floor.
In this chapter we will discuss the formation of solids from an aqueous solution and 
the resulting equilibria. We will also show how selective precipitation and the forma-
tion of complex ions can be used to do qualitative analysis.
16.1 Solubility Equilibria and the 
Solubility Product
Solubility is a very important phenomenon. The fact that substances such as sugar and 
table salt dissolve in water allows us to flavor foods easily. The fact that calcium sulfate 
is less soluble in hot water than in cold water causes it to coat tubes in boilers, reducing 
thermal efficiency. Tooth decay involves solubility: When food lodges between the 
teeth, acids form that dissolve tooth enamel, which contains a mineral called hydroxy-
apatite, Ca5(PO4)3OH. Tooth decay can be reduced by treating teeth with  fluoride (see 
Chemical Connections, p. 645). Fluoride replaces the hydroxide in hydroxyapatite to 
produce the corresponding fluorapatite, Ca5(PO4)3F, and calcium  fluoride, CaF2, both 
of which are less soluble in acids than the original enamel. Another important conse-
quence of solubility involves the use of a suspension of barium sulfate to improve the 
clarity of X rays of the gastrointestinal tract. The very low solubility of barium sulfate, 
which contains the toxic ion Ba21, makes ingestion of the compound safe.
 
In this section we will consider the equilibria associated with solids dissolving to 
form aqueous solutions. We will assume that when a typical ionic solid dissolves in 
water, it dissociates completely into separate hydrated cations and anions. For exam-
ple, calcium fluoride dissolves in water as follows:
CaF21s2 h
H2O
Ca211aq2 1 2F21aq2
When the solid salt is first added to the water, no Ca21 and F2 ions are present. How-
ever, as the dissolution proceeds, the concentrations of Ca21 and F2 increase, making 
it more and more likely that these ions will collide and re-form the solid phase. Thus 
two competing processes are occurring‚Äîthe dissolution reaction and its reverse:
Ca211aq2 1 2F21aq2 h CaF21s2
Ultimately, dynamic equilibrium is reached:
CaF21s2 m Ca211aq2 1 2F21aq2
At this point no more solid dissolves (the solution is said to be saturated).
16.1
For simplicity, we will ignore the effects of 
ion associations in these solutions.
641
Copyright 2018 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.  WCN 02-200-203

 
We can write an equilibrium expression for this process according to the law of 
mass action:
Ksp 5 3Ca2143F242
where [Ca21] and [F2] are expressed in mol/L. The constant Ksp is called the solubility 
product constant or simply the solubility product for the equilibrium expression.
 
Since CaF2 is a pure solid, it is not included in the equilibrium expression. The fact 
that the amount of excess solid present does not affect the position of the solubility 
equilibrium might seem strange at first; more solid means more surface area exposed 
to the solvent, which would seem to result in greater solubility. This is not the case, 
however. When the ions in solution re-form the solid, they do so on the surface of the 
solid. Thus doubling the surface area of the solid not only doubles the rate of dissolv-
ing, but also doubles the rate of re-formation of the solid. The amount of excess solid 
present therefore has no effect on the equilibrium position. Similarly, although either 
increasing the surface area by grinding up the solid or stirring the solution speeds up 
the attainment of equilibrium, neither procedure changes the amount of solid dissolved 
at equilibrium. Neither the amount of excess solid nor the size of the particles present 
will shift the position of the solubility equilibrium.
 
It is very important to distinguish between the solubility of a given solid and its solu-
bility product. The solubility product is an equilibrium constant and has only one value 
for a given solid at a given temperature. Solubility, on the other hand, is an  equilibrium 
position. In pure water at a specific temperature a given salt has a particular solubility. 
On the other hand, if a common ion is present in the solution, the  solubility varies 
according to the concentration of the common ion. However, in all cases the product of 
the ion concentrations must satisfy the Ksp expression. The Ksp values at 258C for many 
common ionic solids are listed in Table 16.1. The units are customarily omitted.
 
Solving solubility equilibria problems requires many of the same procedures we 
have used to deal with acid‚Äìbase equilibria, as illustrated in Examples 16.1 and 16.2.
Calculating Ksp from Solubility I
Copper(I) bromide has a measured solubility of 2.0 3 1024 mol/L at 258C. Calculate 
its Ksp value.
 
SOLUTION 
In this experiment the solid was placed in contact with water. Thus, before any reaction 
occurred, the system contained solid CuBr and H2O. The process that occurs is the 
dissolving of CuBr to form the separated Cu1 and Br2 ions:
CuBr1s2 m Cu11aq2 1 Br21aq2
where 
Ksp 5 3Cu143Br24
Initially, the solution contains no Cu1 or Br2, so the initial concentrations are
3Cu140 5 3Br240 5 0
The equilibrium concentrations can be obtained from the measured solubility of CuBr, 
which is 2.0 3 1024 mol/L. This means that 2.0 3 1024 mole of solid CuBr dissolves 
per 1.0 L of solution to come to equilibrium with the excess solid. The reaction is

Calculating Ksp from Solubility II
Calculate the Ksp value for bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3), which has a solubility of  
1.0 3 10215 mol/L at 258C.
 
SOLUTION 
The system initially contains H2O and solid Bi2S3, which dissolves as follows:
Bi2S31s2 m 2Bi311aq2 1 3S221aq2
Therefore, 
Ksp 5 3Bi31423S2243
Since no Bi31 and S22 ions were present in solution before the Bi2S3 dissolved,
3Bi3140 5 3S2240 5 0
Thus the equilibrium concentrations of these ions will be determined by the amount of 
salt that dissolves to reach equilibrium, which in this case is 1.0 3 10215 mol/L. Since 
each Bi2S3 unit contains 2Bi31 and 3S22 ions:
1.0 3 10215 mol/L Bi2S31s2  
 
h 211.0 3 10215 mol/L2 Bi311aq2 1 311.0 3 10215 mol/L2 S221aq2

See Exercises 16.27 through 16.30
 
We have seen that the experimentally determined solubility of an ionic solid can be 
used to calculate its Ksp value.* The reverse is also possible: The solubility of an ionic 
solid can be calculated if its Ksp value is known.
Calculating Solubility from Ksp
The Ksp value for copper(II) iodate, Cu(IO3)2, is 1.4 3 1027 at 258C. Calculate its solu-
bility at 258C.
 
SOLUTION 
The system initially contains H2O and solid Cu(IO3)2, which dissolves according to the 
following equilibrium:
Cu1IO32 21s2 m Cu211aq2 1 2IO3
 21aq2
Therefore, 
Ksp 5 3Cu2143IO3
 242
To find the solubility of Cu(IO3)2, we must find the equilibrium concentrations of the 
Cu21 and IO32 ions. We do this in the usual way by specifying the initial concentra-
tions (before any solid has dissolved) and then defining the change required to reach 
equilibrium. Since in this case we do not know the solubility, we will assume that 
x mol/L of the solid dissolves to reach equilibrium. The 1:2 stoichiometry of the salt 
means that
x mol/L Cu1IO32 21s2 h x mol/L Cu211aq2 1 2x mol/L IO3
 21aq2
INTERACTIVE EXAMPLE 16.2
Sulfide is a very basic anion and really 
exists in water as HS2. We will not  consider 
this complication.
Solubilities must be expressed in mol/L in 
Ksp calculations.
*This calculation assumes that all the dissolved solid is present as separated ions. In some cases, such 
as CaSO4, large numbers of ion pairs exist in solution, so this method yields an incorrect value for Ksp.

f dental chemistry continues to pro-
gress at the present rate, tooth decay 
may soon be a thing of the past. Cavi-
ties are holes that develop in tooth 
enamel, which is composed of the 
mineral hydroxyapatite, Ca5(PO4)3OH. 
Recent research has shown that there is 
constant dissolving and re-forming of 
the tooth mineral in the saliva at the 
tooth‚Äôs surface. Demineralization (dis-
solving of tooth enamel) is mainly 
caused by weak acids in the saliva 
created by bacteria as they metabolize 
carbohydrates in food. (The solubility 
of Ca5(PO4)3OH in acidic saliva should 
come as no surprise to you if you 
understand how pH affects the solubil-
ity of a salt with basic anions.)
In the first stages of tooth decay, 
parts of the tooth  surface become 
porous and spongy and develop Swiss-
cheese-like holes that, if untreated, 
eventually turn into cavities (see 
photo). However, recent results indicate 
that if the affected tooth is bathed in a 
solution containing appropriate 
amounts of Ca21, PO432, and F2, it 
remineralizes. Because the F2 replaces 
OH2 in the tooth mineral (Ca5(PO4)3OH 
is changed to Ca5(PO4)3F), the reminer-
alized area is more resistant to future 
decay, since fluoride is a weaker base 
than hydroxide ion. In addition, it has 
been shown that the presence of Sr21 
in the remineralizing fluid significantly 
increases resistance to decay.
If these results hold up under fur-
ther study, the work of dentists will 
change dramatically. Dentists will be 
much more involved in preventing 
damage to teeth than in repairing 
damage that has already occurred. One 
can picture the routine use of a remin-
eralization rinse that will repair prob-
lem areas before they become cavities. 
Dental drills could join leeches as a 
medical anachronism.

Relative Solubilities
A salt‚Äôs Ksp value gives us information about its solubility. However, we must be care-
ful in using Ksp values to predict the relative solubilities of a group of salts. There are 
two possible cases:
1. The salts being compared produce the same number of ions. For example, consider
 AgI1s2¬†¬†¬†¬†
 Ksp 5 1.5 3 10216
 CuI1s2¬†¬†¬†¬†
 Ksp 5 5.0 3 10212
 CaSO41s2¬†¬†¬†¬† Ksp 5 6.1 3 1025
Each of these solids dissolves to produce two ions:
Salt m cation 1 anion
Ksp 5 3cation43anion4
If x is the solubility in mol/L, then at equilibrium
3Cation4 5 x
3Anion4 5 x
Ksp 5 3cation43anion4 5 x2
x 5 "Ksp 5 solubility
Therefore, in this case we can compare the solubilities for these solids by com-
paring the Ksp values:
CaSO41s2¬†¬† . CuI1s2 . ¬†¬†AgI1s2
 
Most soluble; 
Least soluble;  
 
largest Ksp 
smallest Ksp
2. The salts being compared produce different numbers of ions. For example, consider
 CuS1s2¬†¬†¬†¬†  Ksp 5 8.5 3 10245
 Ag2S1s2¬†¬†¬†¬† Ksp 5 1.6 3 10249
 Bi2S31s2¬†¬†¬†¬† Ksp 5 1.1 3 10273
Because these salts produce different numbers of ions when they dissolve, the 
Ksp values cannot be compared directly to determine relative solubilities. In fact, 
if we calculate the solubilities (using the procedure in Example 16.3), we obtain 
the results summarized in Table 16.2. The order of solubilities is
Bi2S31s2¬†¬† . Ag2S1s2 . ¬†¬†CuS1s2
 
Most soluble 
Least soluble
which is opposite to the order of the Ksp values.
 
Remember that relative solubilities can be predicted by comparing Ksp values only 
for salts that produce the same total number of ions.

Common Ion Effect
So far we have considered ionic solids dissolved in pure water. We will now see what 
happens when the water contains an ion in common with the dissolving salt. For exam-
ple, consider the solubility of solid silver chromate (Ag2CrO4, Ksp 5 9.0 3 10212) in a 
0.100-M solution of AgNO3. Before any Ag2CrO4 dissolves, the solution contains the 
 major species Ag1, NO32, and H2O, with solid Ag2CrO4 on the bottom of the con-
tainer. Since NO32 is not found in Ag2CrO4, we can ignore it. The relevant initial 
concentrations (before any Ag2CrO4 dissolves) are
3Ag140 5 0.100 M 1from the dissolved AgNO32
3CrO4
2240 5 0
The system comes to equilibrium as the solid Ag2CrO4 dissolves according to the 
reaction
Ag2CrO41s2 m 2Ag11aq2 1 CrO4
 221aq2
for which 
Ksp 5 3Ag1423CrO4
 224 5 9.0 3 10212
 
We assume that x mol/L of Ag2CrO4 dissolves to reach equilibrium, which means 
that
x mol/L Ag2CrO41s2 h 2x mol/L Ag11aq2 1 x mol/L CrO4
 22
Now we can specify the equilibrium concentrations in terms of x:
 
3Ag14 5 3Ag140 1 change 5 0.100 1 2x
3CrO4
 224 5 3CrO4
 2240 1 change 5 0 1 x 5 x
Substituting these concentrations into the expression for Ksp gives
9.0 3 10212 5 3Ag1423CrO4
 224 5 10.100 1 2x2 21x2
The mathematics required here appear to be complicated, since the multiplication of 
terms on the right-hand side produces an expression that contains an x3 term. However, 
as is usually the case, we can make simplifying assumptions. Since the Ksp value for 
Ag2CrO4 is small (the position of the equilibrium lies far to the left), x is expected to 
be small compared with 0.100 M. Therefore, 0.100 1 2x < 0.100, which allows sim-
plification of the expression:
9.0 3 10212 5 10.100 1 2x2 21x2 < 10.1002 21x2
Then 
x < 9.0 3 10212
10.1002 2
5 9.0 3 10210 mol/L
Since x is much less than 0.100 M, the approximation is valid (by the 5% rule). Thus
Solubility of Ag2CrO4 in 0.100 M AgNO3 5 x 5 9.0 3 10210 mol/L
and the equilibrium concentrations are
3Ag14 5 0.100 1 2x 5 0.100 1 219.0 3 102102 5 0.100 M
3CrO4
 224 5 x 5 9.0 3 10210 M
 
Now we compare the solubilities of Ag2CrO4 in pure water and in 0.100 M AgNO3:
 Solubility of Ag2CrO4 in pure water 5 1.3 3 1024 mol/L
 Solubility of Ag2CrO4 in 0.100 M AgNO3 5 9.0 3 10210 mol/L
Note that the solubility of Ag2CrO4 is much less in the presence of Ag1 ions from 
AgNO3. This is another example of the common ion effect. The solubility of a solid is 
lowered if the solution already contains ions common to the solid.

CRITICAL THINKING What if all you know about two salts is that 
the value of Ksp for salt A is greater than that of salt B? Why can we not compare 
relative solubilities of the salts? Use numbers to show how salt A could be more 
soluble than salt B, and how salt B could be more soluble than salt A.
Solubility and Common Ions
Calculate the solubility of solid CaF2 (Ksp 5 4.0 3 10211) in a 0.025-M NaF solution.
 
SOLUTION

H2O. The solubility equilibrium for CaF2 is

 x < 6.4 3 1028
The approximation is valid (by the 5% rule), and

Thus 6.4 3 1028 mole of solid CaF2 dissolves per liter of the 0.025-M NaF solution.
See Exercises 16.41 through 16.46
pH and Solubility
The pH of a solution can greatly affect a salt‚Äôs solubility. For example, magnesium 
hydroxide dissolves according to the equilibrium
Mg1OH2 21s2 m Mg211aq2 1 2OH21aq2
Addition of OH2 ions (an increase in pH) will, by the common ion effect, force the 
equilibrium to the left, decreasing the solubility of Mg(OH)2. On the other hand, an 
addition of H1 ions (a decrease in pH) increases the solubility, because OH2 ions are 
removed from solution by reacting with the added H1 ions. In response to the lower 
concentration of OH2, the equilibrium position moves to the right. This is why a sus-
pension of solid Mg(OH)2, known as milk of magnesia, dissolves as required in the 
stomach to combat  excess acidity.

This idea also applies to salts with other types of anions. For example, the solubility 
of silver phosphate (Ag3PO4) is greater in acid than in pure water because the  
PO432 ion is a strong base that reacts with H1 to form the HPO422 ion. The reaction
H11aq2 1 PO4
 321aq2 h HPO4
 221aq2
occurs in acidic solution, thus lowering the concentration of PO432 and shifting the 
solubility equilibrium
Ag3PO41s2 m 3Ag11aq2 1 PO4
 321aq2
to the right. This, in turn, increases the solubility of silver phosphate.
Silver chloride (AgCl), however, has the same solubility in acid as in pure water. 
Why? Since the Cl2 ion is a very weak base (that is, HCl is a very strong acid), no HCl 
molecules are formed. Thus the addition of H1 to a solution containing Cl2 does not 
affect [Cl2] and has no effect on the solubility of a chloride salt.
 
The general rule is that if the anion X2 is an effective base‚Äîthat is, if HX is a weak 
acid‚Äîthe salt MX will show increased solubility in an acidic solution. Examples of 
common anions that are effective bases are OH2, S22, CO322, C2O422, and CrO422. Salts 
containing these anions are much more soluble in an acidic solution than in pure water.
 
As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, one practical result of the increased 
 solubility of carbonates in acid is the formation of huge limestone caves such as Mam-
moth Cave in Kentucky and Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico. Carbon dioxide dis-
solved in groundwater makes it acidic, increasing the solubility of calcium carbonate 
and eventually producing huge caverns. As the carbon dioxide escapes to the air, the 
pH of the dripping water goes up and the calcium carbonate precipitates, forming sta-
lactites and stalagmites.
CRITICAL THINKING You and a friend are studying for a 
chemistry exam. What if your friend tells you that since acids are very reactive, all 
salts are more soluble in aqueous solutions of acids than in water? How would 
you explain to your friend that this is not true? Use a specific example to defend 
your answer.
16.2 Precipitation and Qualitative 
Analysis
So far we have considered solids dissolving in solutions. Now we will consider the 
reverse process‚Äîthe formation of a solid from solution. When solutions are mixed, 
various reactions can occur. We have already considered acid‚Äìbase reactions in some 
detail. In this section we show how to predict whether a precipitate will form when two 
solutions are mixed. We will use the ion product, which is defined just like the expres-
sion for Ksp for a given solid except that initial concentrations are used instead of equi-
librium  concentrations. For solid CaF2, the expression for the ion product Q is written
Q 5 3Ca21403F240
 2
 
If we add a solution containing Ca21 ions to a solution containing F2 ions, a pre-
cipitate may or may not form, depending on the concentrations of these ions in the 
resulting mixed solution. To predict whether precipitation will occur, we consider the 
relationship between Q and Ksp.
If Q is greater than Ksp, precipitation occurs and will continue until the concentra-
tions are reduced to the point that they satisfy Ksp.
If Q is less than Ksp, no precipitation occurs.
16.2
Q is used here in a very similar way to the 
use of the reaction quotient in Chapter 13.

of 2.00 3 1022 M KIO3. Will Ce(IO3)3 (Ksp 5 1.9 3 10210) precipitate from this 
solution?
 
SOLUTION 
First, we calculate [Ce31]0 and [IO32]0 in the mixed solution before any reaction occurs:
 3Ce3140 5 1750.0 mL2 14.00 3 1023 mmol/mL2
1750.0 1 300.02 mL

240
 3 5 12.86 3 10232 15.71 3 10232 3 5 5.32 3 10210
‚ñ† Since Q is greater than Ksp, Ce(IO3)3 will precipitate from the mixed solution.
See Exercises 16.53 through 16.56
 
Sometimes we want to do more than simply predict whether precipitation will 
occur; we may want to calculate the equilibrium concentrations in the solution after 
pre cipitation occurs. For example, let us calculate the equilibrium concentrations of 
Pb21 and I2 ions in a solution formed by mixing 100.0 mL of 0.0500 M Pb(NO3)2 and 
200.0 mL of 0.100 M NaI. First, we must determine whether solid PbI2 (Ksp 5 1.4 3 1028) 
forms when the solutions are mixed. To do so, we need to calculate [Pb21]0 and [I2]0 
before any  reaction occurs:
 3Pb2140 5 mmol Pb21
mL solution 5 1100.0 mL2 10.0500 mmol/mL2
300.0 mL
5 1.67 3 1022 M

mmol I2
mL solution 5 1200.0 mL2 10.100 mmol/mL2
300.0 mL
5 6.67 3 1022 M
The ion product for PbI2 is
Q 5 3Pb21403I240
 2 5 11.67 3 10222 16.67 3 10222 2 5 7.43 3 1025
Since Q is greater than Ksp, a precipitate of PbI2 will form.
 
Since the Ksp for PbI2 is quite small (1.4 3 1028), only very small quantities of Pb21 
and I2 can coexist in aqueous solution. In other words, when Pb21 and I2 are mixed, 
most of these ions will precipitate out as PbI2. That is, the reaction
Pb211aq2 1 2I21aq2 h PbI21s2
(which is the reverse of the dissolution reaction) goes essentially to completion.
 
If, when two solutions are mixed, a reaction occurs that goes virtually to comple-
tion, it is essential to do the stoichiometry calculations before considering the equilib-
rium calculations. Therefore, in this case we let the system go completely in the 
direction toward which it tends. Then we will let it adjust back to equilibrium. If we let 
Pb21 and I2 react to completion, we have the following concentrations:

Next we must allow the system to adjust to equilibrium. At equilibrium [Pb21] is 
not actually zero because the reaction does not go quite to completion. The best way 
to think about this is that once the PbI2 is formed, a very small amount redissolves to 
reach equilibrium. Since I2 is in excess, the PbI2 is dissolving into a solution that con-
tains 10.0 mmol I2 per 300.0 mL solution, or 3.33 3 1022 M I2.
 
We could state this problem as follows: What is the solubility of solid PbI2 in a  
3.33 3 1022 M-NaI solution? The lead iodide dissolves according to the equation
PbI21s2 m Pb211aq2 1 2I21aq2
The concentrations are as follows:

Substituting into the expression for Ksp gives
Ksp 5 1.4 3 1028 5 3Pb2143I242 5 1x2 13.33 3 1022 1 2x2 2 < 1x2 13.33 3 10222 2
Then 
 3Pb214 5 x 5 1.3 3 1025 M
 3I24 5 3.33 3 1022 M
Note that 3.33 3 1022 @ 2x, so the approximation is valid. These Pb21 and I2 concen-
trations thus represent the equilibrium concentrations present in a solution formed by 
mixing 100.0 mL of 0.0500 M Pb(NO3)2 and 200.0 mL of 0.100 M NaI.
Precipitation
A solution is prepared by mixing 150.0 mL of 1.00 3 1022 M Mg(NO3)2 and 250.0 mL 
of 1.00 3 1021 M NaF. Calculate the concentrations of Mg21 and F2 at equilibrium 
with solid MgF2 (Ksp 5 6.4 3 1029).
 
SOLUTION 
The first step is to determine whether solid MgF2 forms. To do this, we need to calculate 
the concentrations of Mg21 and F2 in the mixed solution and find Q:
 3Mg2140 5 mmol Mg21

 2 5 13.75 3 10232 16.25 3 10222 2 5 1.46 3 1025
Since Q is greater than Ksp, solid MgF2 will form.

Note that excess F2 remains after the precipitation reaction goes to completion. The 
concentration is

Although we have assumed that the Mg21 is completely consumed, we know that 
[Mg21] will not be zero at equilibrium. We can compute the equilibrium [Mg21] by 
letting MgF2 redissolve to satisfy the expression for Ksp. How much MgF2 will dis-
solve in a 5.50 3 1022-M NaF solution? We proceed as usual:

Selective Precipitation
Mixtures of metal ions in aqueous solution are often separated by selective precipita-
tion, that is, by using a reagent whose anion forms a precipitate with only one or a few 
of the metal ions in the mixture. For example, suppose we have a solution containing 
both Ba21 and Ag1 ions. If NaCl is added to the solution, AgCl precipitates as a white 
solid, but since BaCl2 is soluble, the Ba21 ions remain in solution.
Selective Precipitation
A solution contains 1.0 3 1024 M Cu1 and 2.0 3 1023 M Pb21. If a source of I2 
is added gradually to this solution, will PbI2 (Ksp 5 1.4 3 1028) or CuI (Ksp 5 
5.3 3 10212) precipitate first? Specify the concentration of I2 necessary to begin pre-
cipitation of each salt.
 
SOLUTION 
For PbI2, the Ksp expression is
1.4 3 1028 5 Ksp 5 3Pb2143I242
Since [Pb21] in this solution is known to be 2.0 3 1023 M, the greatest concentration 
of I2 that can be present without causing precipitation of PbI2 can be calculated from 
the Ksp expression:
 1.4 3 1028 5 3Pb2143I242 5 12.0 3 10232 3I242
 3I24 5 2.6 3 1023 M

Any I2 in excess of this concentration will cause solid PbI2 to form.
 
Similarly, for CuI, the Ksp expression is
5.3 3 10212 5 Ksp 5 3Cu143I24 5 11.0 3 10242 3I24
and 
‚ñ† 3I24 5 5.3 3 1028 M
A concentration of I2 in excess of 5.3 3 1028 M will cause formation of solid CuI.
 
As I2 is added to the mixed solution, CuI will precipitate first, since the [I2] required 
is less. Therefore, Cu1 would be separated from Pb21 using this reagent.
See Exercises 16.61 through 16.64
 
Since metal sulfide salts differ dramatically in their solubilities, the sulfide ion is 
often used to separate metal ions by selective precipitation. For example, consider a 
solution containing a mixture of 1023 M Fe21 and 1023 M Mn21. Since FeS (Ksp 5 
3.7 3 10219) is much less soluble than MnS (Ksp 5 2.3 3 10213), careful addition of 
S22 to the mixture will precipitate Fe21 as FeS, leaving Mn21 in solution.
 
One real advantage of the sulfide ion as a precipitating reagent is that because it is 
basic, its concentration can be controlled by regulating the pH of the solution. H2S is 
a diprotic acid that dissociates in two steps:
 H2S m H1 1 HS2¬†¬†¬†¬† Ka1 5 1.0 3 1027
 HS2 m H1 1 S22¬†¬†¬†¬†  Ka2 < 10219
Note from the small Ka2 value that S22 ions have a high affinity for protons. In an 
acidic solution (large [H1]), [S22] will be relatively small, since under these conditions 
the dissociation equilibria will lie far to the left. On the other hand, in basic solutions 
[S22] will be relatively large, since the very small value of [H1] will pull both equilib-
ria to the right, producing S22.
 
This means that the most insoluble sulfide salts, such as CuS (Ksp 5 8.5 3 10245) 
and HgS (Ksp 5 1.6 3 10254), can be precipitated from an acidic solution, leaving the 
more soluble ones, such as MnS (Ksp 5 2.3 3 10213) and NiS (Ksp 5 3 3 10221), still 
dissolved. The manganese and nickel sulfides can then be precipitated by making the 
solution slightly basic. This procedure is diagramed in Fig. 16.1.
We can compare Ksp values to find  relative 
solubilities because FeS and MnS produce 
the same number of ions in  solution.

OH2 is added to lower [H1], the value of [S22] increases, 
and MnS and NiS precipitate.

16.2 Precipitation and Qualitative Analysis

Qualitative Analysis
The classic scheme for qualitative analysis 
of a mixture containing all the common cat-
ions (listed in Fig. 16.2) involves first sepa-
rating them into five major groups based on 
solubilities. (These groups are not directly 
related to the groups of the periodic table.) 
Each group is then treated further to sepa-
rate and identify the individual ions. We will 
be concerned here only with separation of 
the major groups.
Group I‚ÄîInsoluble chlorides
When dilute aqueous HCl is added to a 
solution containing a mixture of the com-
mon cations, only Ag1, Pb21, and Hg221 
will precipitate out as insoluble chlorides. 
All other chlorides are soluble and remain 
in solution. The Group I precipitate is re-
moved, leaving the other ions in solution 
for treatment with sulfide ion.
Group II‚ÄîSulfides insoluble in acid solution
After the insoluble chlorides are removed, the solution is still acidic, since HCl 
was added. If H2S is added to this solution, only the most insoluble sulfides  
(those of Hg21, Cd21, Bi31, Cu21, and Sn41) will precipitate, since [S22] is rela-
tively low because of the high concentration of H1. The more soluble sulfides 
will remain dissolved under these conditions, and the precipitate of the insoluble 
salt is removed.
Group III‚ÄîSulfides insoluble in basic solution
The solution is made basic at this stage, and more H2S is added. As we saw   
earlier, a basic solution produces a higher [S22], which leads to precipitation of  
the more soluble sulfides. The cations precipitated as sulfides at this stage are  
Co21, Zn21, Mn21, Ni21, and Fe21. If any Cr31 and Al31 ions are present, they 
also will precipitate, but as insoluble hydroxides (remember the solution is now  
basic). The precipitate is separated from the solution containing the rest of the 
ions.
Group IV‚ÄîInsoluble carbonates
At this point, all the cations have been precipitated except those from Groups 1A 
and 2A of the periodic table. The Group 2A cations form insoluble carbonates and 
can be precipitated by the addition of CO322. For example, Ba21, Ca21, and Mg21 
form solid carbonates and can be removed from the solution.
Group V‚ÄîAlkali metal and ammonium ions
The only ions remaining in solution at this point are the Group 1A cations and the 
NH41 ion, all of which form soluble salts with the common anions. The Group 1A 
cations are usually identified by the characteristic colors they produce when heated 
in a flame. These colors are due to the emission spectra of these ions.
 
The qualitative analysis scheme for cations based on the selective precipitation pro-
cedure described above is summarized in Fig. 16.2.
Note at this point in the analysis that 
some solutions containing Na1 have been 
added. Thus the flame test for Na1 must be 
performed on the original solution.

16.3 Equilibria Involving Complex Ions
A complex ion is a charged species consisting of a metal ion surrounded by ligands. A 
ligand is simply a Lewis base‚Äîa molecule or ion having a lone electron pair that can 
be donated to an empty orbital on the metal ion to form a covalent bond. Some com-
mon ligands are H2O, NH3, Cl2, and CN2. The number of ligands attached to a metal 
ion is called the coordination number. The most common coordination numbers are 
6, for example, in Co(H2O)621 and Ni(NH3)621; 4, for example, in CoCl422 and 
Cu(NH3)421; and 2, for example, in Ag(NH3)21; but others are known.
 
The properties of complex ions will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 21. For 
now, we will just look at the equilibria involving these species. Metal ions add ligands 
one at a time in steps characterized by equilibrium constants called formation con-
stants or stability constants. For example, when solutions containing Ag1 ions and 
NH3 molecules are mixed, the following reactions take place:
 Ag11aq2 1 NH31aq2 m Ag1NH32 11aq2¬†¬†¬†¬† K1 5 2.1 3 103
 Ag1NH32 11aq2 1 NH31aq2 m Ag1NH32 2
 11aq2¬†¬†¬†¬† K2 5 8.2 3 103
where K1 and K2 are the formation constants for the two steps. In a solution containing 
Ag1 and NH3, all the species NH3, Ag1, Ag(NH3)1, and Ag(NH3)21 exist at equilib-
rium. Calculating the concentrations of all these components can be complicated. 
However, usually the total concentration of the ligand is much larger than the total 
concentration of the metal ion, and approximations can greatly simplify the problems.
 
For example, consider a solution prepared by mixing 100.0 mL of 2.0 M NH3 with 
100.0 mL of 1.0 3 1023 M AgNO3. Before any reaction occurs, the mixed solution 
contains the major species Ag1, NO32, NH3, and H2O. What reaction or reactions will 
occur in this solution? From our discussions of acid‚Äìbase chemistry, we know that one 
reaction is
NH31aq2 1 H2O1 l 2 m NH4
 11aq2 1 OH21aq2
However, we are interested in the reaction between NH3 and Ag1 to form complex 
ions, and since the position of the preceding equilibrium lies far to the left (Kb for 
NH3 is 1.8 3 1025), we can neglect the amount of NH3 used up in the reaction with 
water. Therefore, before any complex ion formation, the concentrations in the mixed 
solution are
3Ag140 5 1100.0 mL2 11.0 3 1023 M2
1200.0 mL2
5 5.0 3 1024 M
r 
Total volume
3NH340 5 1100.0 mL2 12.0 M2
1200.0 mL2
5 1.0 M
As mentioned already, the Ag1 ion reacts with NH3 in a stepwise fashion to form 
AgNH31 and then Ag(NH3)21:
 Ag11aq2 1 NH31aq2 m Ag1NH32 11aq2¬†¬†¬†¬† K1 5 2.1 3 103
 Ag1NH32 11aq2 1 NH31aq2 m Ag1NH32 2
 11aq2¬†¬†¬†¬† K2 5 8.2 3 103
Since both K1 and K2 are large, and since there is a large excess of NH3, both reactions 
can be assumed to go essentially to completion. This is equivalent to writing the net 
 reaction in the solution as follows:
Ag1 1 2NH3 h Ag1NH32 2

as Ag1 is required
5.0 3 1024 M
 
Note that in this case we have used molarities when performing the stoichiometry 
calculations and we have assumed this reaction to be complete, using all the original 
Ag1 to form Ag(NH3)21. In reality, a very small amount of the Ag(NH3)21 formed will 
dissociate to produce small amounts of Ag(NH3)1 and Ag1. However, since the amount 
of Ag(NH3)21 dissociating will be so small, we can safely assume that [Ag(NH3)21] is 
5.0 3 1024 M at equilibrium. Also, we know that since so little NH3 has been con-
sumed, [NH3] is 1.0 M at equilibrium. We can use these concentrations to calculate 
[Ag1] and [Ag(NH3)1] using the K1 and K2 expressions.
 
To calculate the equilibrium concentration of Ag(NH3)1, we use
K2 5 8.2 3 103 5
3Ag1NH32 2
 14
3Ag1NH32 143NH34

So far we have assumed that Ag(NH3)21 is the dominant silver-containing species 
in solution. Is this a valid assumption? The calculated concentrations are
 3Ag1NH32 2
 14 5 5.0 3 1024 M
 3Ag1NH32 14 5 6.1 3 1028 M
 3Ag14 5 2.9 3 10211 M
These values clearly support the conclusion that
3Ag1NH32 2
 14 @ 3Ag1NH32 14 @ 3Ag14
Thus the assumption that Ag(NH3)21 is the dominant Ag1-containing species is valid, 
and the calculated concentrations are correct.
 
This analysis shows that although complex ion equilibria have many species pres-
ent and look complicated, the calculations are actually quite straightforward, espe-
cially if the ligand is present in large excess.
Essentially all the Ag1 ions originally 
 present end up in Ag(NH3)21.

Since [S2O322]0 @ [Ag1]0, and since K1 and K2 are large, both formation reactions can 
be assumed to go to completion, and the net reaction in the solution is as follows:

Note that Ag1 is limiting and that the amount of S2O322 consumed is negligible. Also 
note that since all these species are in the same solution, the molarities can be used to 
do the stoichiometry problem.
 
Of course, the concentration of Ag1 is not zero at equilibrium, and there is some 
Ag(S2O3)2 in the solution. To calculate the concentrations of these species, we must 
use the K1 and K2 expressions. We can calculate the concentration of Ag(S2O3)2 
from K2:
 3.9 3 104 5 K2 5
3Ag1S2O32 2

We can calculate [Ag1] from K1:

 224 5 3.8 3 1029

 3Ag14 5 1.8 3 10218 M
 
These results show that [Ag(S2O3)232] @ [Ag(S2O3)2] @ [Ag1]
Thus the assumption is valid that essentially all the original Ag1 is converted to 
Ag(S2O3)232 at equilibrium.

Complex Ions and Solubility
Often ionic solids that are very nearly water-insoluble must be dissolved somehow in 
aqueous solutions. For example, when the various qualitative analysis groups are pre-

group. Consider a solution of cations that contains Ag1, Pb21, and Hg221, among oth-
ers. When dilute aqueous HCl is added to this solution, the Group I ions will form the 
insoluble chlorides AgCl, PbCl2, and Hg2Cl2. Once this mixed precipitate is separated 
from the solution, it must be redissolved to identify the cations individually. How can 
this be done? We know that some solids are more soluble in acidic than in neutral solu-
tions. What about chloride salts? For example, can AgCl be dissolved by using a strong 
acid? The answer is no, because Cl2 ions have virtually no affinity for H1 ions in aque-
ous solution. The position of the dissolution equilibrium
AgCl1s2 m Ag11aq2 1 Cl21aq2
is not affected by the presence of H1.
 
How can we pull the dissolution equilibrium to the right, even though Cl2 is an 
extremely weak base? The key is to lower the concentration of Ag1 in solution by 
forming complex ions. For example, Ag1 reacts with excess NH3 to form the stable 
complex ion Ag(NH3)21. As a result, AgCl is quite soluble in concentrated ammonia 
solutions. The relevant reactions are
 AgCl1s2 m Ag11aq2 1 Cl21aq2¬†¬†¬†¬† Ksp 5 1.6 3 10210

 K2 5 8.2 3 103
The Ag1 ion produced by dissolving solid AgCl combines with NH3 to form 
Ag(NH3)21, which causes more AgCl to dissolve, until the point at which
3Ag143Cl24 5 Ksp 5 1.6 3 10210
Here [Ag1] refers only to the Ag1 ion that is present as a separate species in solution. 
It is not the total silver content of the solution, which is
3Ag4total dissolved 5 3Ag14 1 3Ag1NH32 14 1 3Ag1NH32 2
 14
 
For reasons discussed in the previous section, virtually all the Ag1 from the dis-
solved AgCl ends up in the complex ion Ag(NH3)21. Thus we can represent the dis-
solving of solid AgCl in excess NH3 by the equation
AgCl1s2 1 2NH31aq2 m Ag1NH32 2
 11aq2 1 Cl21aq2
Since this equation is the sum of the three stepwise reactions given above, the equilib-
rium constant for the reaction is the product of the constants for the three reactions. 
(Demonstrate this to yourself by multiplying together the three expressions for Ksp, K1, 
and K2.) The equilibrium expression is

Using this expression, we will now calculate the solubility of solid AgCl in a  
10.0-M NH3 solution. If we let x be the solubility (in mol/L) of AgCl in the solution, 
we can then write the following expressions for the equilibrium concentrations of the 
pertinent species:
 3Cl24 5 x
 3Ag1NH32 2
 14 5 x
 3NH34 5 10.0 2 2x v
When reactions are added, the 
 equilibrium constant for the overall 
process is the product of the constants 
for the individual reactions.

In this chapter we have considered two strategies for dissolving a water-insoluble 
ionic solid. If the anion of the solid is a good base, the solubility is greatly increased 
by acidifying the solution. In cases where the anion is not sufficiently basic, the ionic 
solid often can be dissolved in a solution containing a ligand that forms stable complex 
ions with its cation.
 
Sometimes solids are so insoluble that combinations of reactions are needed to dis-
solve them. For example, to dissolve the extremely insoluble HgS (Ksp 5 10254), it is 
necessary to use a mixture of concentrated HCl and concentrated HNO3, called aqua 
regia. The H1 ions in the aqua regia react with the S22 ions to form H2S, and Cl2 reacts 
with Hg21 to form various complex ions, including HgCl422. In addition, NO32 oxi-
dizes S22 to elemental sulfur. These processes lower the concentrations of Hg21 and 
S22 and thus promote the solubility of HgS.
 
Since the solubility of many salts increases with temperature, simple heating is 
sometimes enough to make a salt sufficiently soluble. For example, earlier in this  
section we considered the mixed chloride precipitates of the Group I ions‚ÄîPbCl2, 
AgCl, and Hg2Cl2. The effect of temperature on the solubility of PbCl2 is such that we 
can precipitate PbCl2 with cold aqueous HCl and then redissolve it by heating the solu-
tion to near boiling. The silver and mercury(I) chlorides remain precipitated, since 
they are not significantly soluble in hot water. However, solid AgCl can be dissolved 
using aqueous ammonia. The solid Hg2Cl2 reacts with NH3 to form a mixture of ele-
mental mercury and HgNH2Cl:
Hg2Cl21s2 1 2NH31aq2 h HgNH2Cl1s2 1 Hg1 l 2 1 NH4
11aq2 1 Cl21aq2
 
White 
Black
The mixed precipitate appears gray. This is an oxidation‚Äìreduction reaction in which 
one mercury(I) ion in Hg2Cl2 is oxidized to Hg21 in HgNH2Cl and the other mercury(I) 
ion is reduced to Hg, or elemental mercury.
 
The treatment of the Group I ions is summarized in Fig. 16.3. Note that the pres-
ence of Pb21 is confirmed by adding CrO422, which forms bright yellow lead(II) chro-
mate (PbCrO4). Also note that H1 added to a solution containing Ag(NH3)21 reacts 
with the NH3 to form NH41, destroying the Ag(NH3)21 complex. Silver chloride then 
re-forms:
2H11aq2 1 Ag1NH32 2
 11aq2 1 Cl21aq2 h 2NH4
 11aq2 1 AgCl1s2
Note that the qualitative analysis of cations by selective precipitation involves all the 
types of reactions we have discussed and represents an excellent application of the 
principles of chemical equilibrium.

Ksp, refer? Table 16.1 lists Ksp values for several ionic 
solids. For any of these ionic compounds, you should be 
able to calculate the solubility. What is the solubility of 
a salt, and what procedures do you follow to calculate

 6. Mixtures of metal ions in aqueous solution can some-
times be separated by selective precipitation. What is 
selective precipitation? If a solution contained 0.10 M 
Mg21, 0.10 M Ca21, and 0.10 M Ba21, how could addi-
tion of NaF be used to separate the cations out of 
solution‚Äîthat is, what would precipitate first, then 
second, then third? How could addition of K3PO4 be 
used to separate out the cations in a solution that is  
1.0 M Ag1, 1.0 M Pb21, and 1.0 M Sr21?
 7. Figure 16.2 summarizes the classic method for separat-
ing a mixture of common cations by selective precipita-
tion. Explain the chemistry involved with each of the 
four steps in the diagram.
 8. What is a complex ion? The stepwise formation con-
stants for the complex ion Cu(NH3)421 are  
K1 < 1 3 103, K2 < 1 3 104, K3 < 1 3 103, and  
K4 < 1 3 103. Write the reactions that refer to each of 
these formation constants. Given that the values of the 
formation constants are large, what can you deduce 
about the equilibrium concentration of Cu(NH3)421 
versus the equilibrium concentration of Cu21?
 9. When 5 M ammonia is added to a solution containing 
Cu(OH)2(s), the precipitate will eventually dissolve in 
solution. Why? If 5 M HNO3 is then added, the 
Cu(OH)2 precipitate re-forms. Why? In general, what 
effect does the ability of a cation to form a complex ion 
have on the solubility of salts containing that cation?

T
he first law of thermodynamics is a statement of the law of conservation of 
energy: Energy can be neither created nor destroyed. In other words, the energy 
of the universe is constant. Although the total energy is constant, the various forms of 
energy can be interchanged in physical and chemical processes. For example, if you 
drop a book, some of the initial potential energy of the book is changed to kinetic 
energy, which is then transferred to the atoms in the air and the floor as random motion. 
The net effect of this process is to change a given quantity of potential energy to 
exactly the same quantity of thermal energy. Energy has been converted from one form 
to another, but the same quantity of energy exists before and after the process.
Now let‚Äôs consider a chemical example. When methane is burned in excess oxygen, 
the major reaction is
CH41 g2 1 2O21 g2 h CO21 g2 1 2H2O1 g2 1 energy
This reaction produces a quantity of energy, which is released as heat. This energy 
flow results from the lowering of the potential energy stored in the bonds of CH4 and 
O2 as they react to form CO2 and H2O. This is illustrated in Fig. 17.1. Potential energy 
has been converted to thermal energy, but the energy content of the universe has 
remained constant in accordance with the first law of thermodynamics.
The first law of thermodynamics is used mainly for energy bookkeeping, that is, to 
answer such questions as
How much energy is involved in the change?
Does energy flow into or out of the system?
What form does the energy finally assume?
Although the first law of thermodynamics provides the means for accounting for 
energy, it gives no hint as to why a particular process occurs in a given direction. This 
is the main question to be considered in this chapter.
17.1 Spontaneous Processes 
and Entropy
A process is said to be spontaneous if it occurs without outside intervention. Sponta-
neous processes may be fast or slow. As we will see in this chapter, thermodynamics 
can tell us the direction in which a process will occur but can say nothing about the 
speed of the process. As we saw in Chapter 12, the rate of a reaction depends on many 
factors, such as activation energy, temperature, concentration, and catalysts, and we 
were able to explain these effects using a simple collision model. In describing a 
chemical reaction, the discipline of chemical kinetics focuses on the pathway between 
reactants and products; thermodynamics considers only the initial and final states and 
does not require knowledge of the pathway between reactants and products (Fig. 17.2).
In summary, thermodynamics lets us predict whether a process will occur but gives 
no information about the amount of time required for the process. For example, accord-
ing to the principles of thermodynamics, a diamond should change spontaneously to 
graphite. The fact that we do not observe this process does not mean the prediction is 
wrong; it simply means the process is very slow. Thus we need both thermodynamics 
and kinetics to describe reactions fully.
The first law of thermodynamics: The 
energy of the universe is constant.
17.1
Spontaneous does not mean fast 
(a spontaneous process is said to be 
‚Äúthermodynamically favored‚Äù).
The process of diamond turning to  
graphite, while thermodynamically  
favored, is said to be under kinetic  
control; that is, it does not proceed  
at a noticeable rate.

To explore the idea of spontaneity, consider the following physical and chemical 
processes:
A ball rolls down a hill but never spontaneously rolls back up the hill.
If exposed to air and moisture, steel rusts spontaneously. However, the iron oxide 
in rust does not spontaneously change back to iron metal and oxygen gas.
A gas fills its container uniformly. It never spontaneously collects at one end of 
the container.
Heat flow always occurs from a hot object to a cooler one. The reverse process 
never occurs spontaneously.
Wood burns spontaneously in an exothermic reaction to form carbon dioxide and 
water, but wood is not formed when carbon dioxide and water are heated together.
At temperatures below 08C, water spontaneously freezes, and at temperatures above 
08C, ice spontaneously melts.
What thermodynamic principle will provide an explanation of why, under a given set 
of conditions, each of these diverse processes occurs in one direction and never in the 
reverse? In searching for an answer, we could explain the behavior of a ball on a hill in 
terms of gravity. But what does gravity have to do with the rusting of a nail or the 
freezing of water? Early developers of thermodynamics thought that exothermicity 
might be the key‚Äîthat a process would be spontaneous if it were exothermic. Although

this factor does appear to be important, since many spontaneous processes are exother-
mic, it is not the total answer. For example, the melting of ice, which occurs spontane-
ously at temperatures greater than 08C, is an endothermic process.
 
What common characteristic causes the processes listed above to be spontaneous in 
one direction only? After many years of observation, scientists have concluded that the 
characteristic common to all spontaneous processes is an increase in a property called 
 entropy, denoted by the symbol S. The driving force for a spontaneous process is an 
 increase in the entropy of the universe.
 
What is entropy? Although there is no simple definition that is completely accurate, 
entropy can be viewed as a measure of molecular randomness or disorder. The natural 
progression of things is from order to disorder, from lower entropy to higher entropy. 
To illustrate the natural tendency toward disorder, you only have to think about the 
condition of your room. Your room naturally tends to get messy (disordered), because 
an ordered room requires everything to be in its place. There are simply many more 
ways for things to be out of place than for them to be in their places.
 
As another example, suppose you have a deck of playing cards ordered in some 
particular way. You throw these cards into the air and pick them all up at random. 
Looking at the new sequence of the cards, you would be very surprised to find that it 
matched the original order. Such an event would be possible, but very improbable. 
There are billions of ways for the deck to be disordered, but only one way to be ordered 
according to your definition. Thus the chances of picking the cards up out of order are 
much greater than the chance of picking them up in order. It is natural for disorder to 
increase.
 
Entropy is a thermodynamic function that describes the number of arrangements 
 (positions and/or energy levels) that are available to a system existing in a given state. 
Entropy is closely associated with probability. The key concept is that the more ways 
a particular state can be achieved, the greater is the likelihood (probability) of finding 
that state. In other words, nature spontaneously proceeds toward the states that have 
the highest probabilities of existing. This conclusion is not surprising at all. The diffi-
culty comes in connecting this concept to real-life processes. For example, what does 
the spontaneous rusting of steel have to do with probability? Understanding the con-
nection between entropy and spontaneity will allow us to answer such questions. We 
will begin to explore this connection by considering a very simple process, the expan-
sion of an ideal gas into a vacuum, as represented in Fig. 17.3. Why is this process 
spontaneous? The driving force is probability. Because there are more ways of having 
Probability refers to likelihood.

the gas evenly spread throughout the container than there are ways for it to be in any 
other possible state, the gas spontaneously attains the uniform distribution.
 
To understand this conclusion, we will greatly simplify the system and consider the 
possible arrangements of only four gas molecules in the two-bulbed container (Fig. 
17.4). How many ways can each arrangement (state) be achieved? Arrangements I and 
V can be achieved in only one way‚Äîall the molecules must be in one end. Arrange-
ments II and IV can be achieved in four ways, as shown in Table 17.1. Each configura-
tion that gives a particular arrangement is called a microstate. Arrangement I has one 
microstate, and arrangement II has four microstates. Arrangement III can be achieved 
in six ways (six microstates), as shown in Table 17.1. Which arrangement is most 
likely to occur? The one that can be achieved in the greatest number of ways. Thus 
arrangement III is most probable. The relative probabilities of arrangements III, II, and 
I are 6;4;1. We have discovered an  important principle: The probability of occurrence 
of a particular arrangement (state)  depends on the number of ways (microstates) in 
which that arrangement can be achieved.
 
The consequences of this principle are dramatic for large numbers of molecules. 
One gas molecule in the flask in Fig. 17.4 has one chance in two of being in the left 
bulb. We say that the probability of finding the molecule in the left bulb is 1
2. For two 
molecules in the flask, there is one chance in two of finding each molecule in the left 
bulb, so there is one chance in four (1
2 3 1
2 5 1
4) that both molecules will be in the left 
bulb. As the number of molecules increases, the relative probability of finding all of 
them in the left bulb decreases, as shown in Table 17.2. For 1 mole of gas, the probabil-
ity of finding all the molecules in the left bulb is so small that this arrangement would 
‚Äúnever‚Äù occur.
 
Thus a gas placed in one end of a container will spontaneously expand to fill the 
entire vessel evenly because, for a large number of gas molecules, there is a huge

number of microstates in which equal numbers of molecules are in both ends. On the 
other hand, the opposite process,
although not impossible, is highly improbable, since only one  microstate leads to this 
arrangement. Therefore, this process does not occur spontaneously.
 
The type of probability we have been considering in this example is called posi-
tional probability because it depends on the number of configurations in space (posi-
tional microstates) that yield a particular state. A gas expands into a vacuum to give a 
uniform distribution because the expanded state has the highest positional probability, 
that is, the largest entropy, of the states available to the system.
 
Positional probability is also illustrated by changes of state. In general, positional 
entropy increases in going from solid to liquid to gas. A mole of a substance has a 
much smaller volume in the solid state than it does in the gaseous state. In the solid 
state, the molecules are close together, with relatively few positions available to them; 
in the gaseous state, the molecules are far apart, with many more positions available to 
them. The liquid state is closer to the solid state than it is to the gaseous state in these 
terms. We can summarize these comparisons as follows:
Sgas
Sliquid
Ssolid
Solid, liquid, and gaseous states were 
compared in Chapter 10.
Solids are more ordered than liquids or 
gases and thus have lower entropy.

Positional entropy is also very important in the formation of solutions. In Chapter 11 
we saw that solution formation is favored by the natural tendency for substances to 
mix. We can now be more precise. The entropy change associated with the mixing of 
two pure substances is expected to be positive. An increase in entropy is expected 
because there are many more microstates for the mixed condition than for the sepa-
rated condition. This effect is due principally to the increased volume available to a 
given ‚Äúparticle‚Äù after mixing occurs. For example, when two liquids are mixed to form 
a solution, the molecules of each liquid have more available volume and thus more 
available positions. Therefore, the increase in positional entropy associated with mix-
ing favors the formation of solutions.
Positional Entropy
For each of the following pairs, choose the substance with the higher positional entropy 
(per mole) at a given temperature.
a. Solid CO2 and gaseous CO2
b. N2 gas at 1 atm and N2 gas at 1.0 3 1022 atm
 
SOLUTION 
a. Since a mole of gaseous CO2 has the greater volume by far, the molecules have many 
more available positions than in a mole of solid CO2. Thus gaseous CO2 has the 
higher positional entropy.
b. A mole of N2 gas at 1 3 1022 atm has a volume 100 times that (at a given tem-
perature) of a mole of N2 gas at 1 atm. Thus N2 gas at 1 3 1022 atm has the 
higher positional entropy.
See Exercise 17.35
Predicting Entropy Changes
Predict the sign of the entropy change for each of the following processes.
a. Solid sugar is added to water to form a solution.
b. Iodine vapor condenses on a cold surface to form crystals.
 
SOLUTION 
a. The sugar molecules become randomly dispersed in the water when the solution 
forms and thus have access to a larger volume and a larger number of possible 
positions. The positional disorder is increased, and there will be an increase in 
entropy. DS is positive, since the final state has a larger entropy than the initial 
state, and DS 5 Sfinal 2 Sinitial.
b. Gaseous iodine is forming a solid. This process involves a change from a rela-
tively large volume to a much smaller volume, which results in lower positional 
disorder. For this process DS is negative (the entropy decreases).
See Exercise 17.36
The tendency to mix is due to the increased 
volume available to the particles of each 
component of the mixture. For example, 
when two liquids are mixed, the molecules 
of each liquid have more available volume 
and thus more available positions.

17.2 Entropy and the Second Law 
of Thermodynamics
We have seen that processes are spontaneous when they result in an increase in disor-
der. Nature always moves toward the most probable state available to it. We can state 
this principle in terms of entropy: In any spontaneous process there is always an 
increase in the entropy of the universe. This is the second law of thermodynamics. 
Contrast this with the first law of thermodynamics, which tells us that the energy of the 
universe is constant. Energy is conserved in the universe, but entropy is not. In fact, the 
second law can be paraphrased as follows: The entropy of the universe is increasing.
As in Chapter 6, we find it convenient to divide the universe into a system and the 
surroundings. Thus we can represent the change in the entropy of the universe as
DSuniv 5 DSsys 1 DSsurr
where DSsys and DSsurr represent the changes in entropy that occur in the system and 
surroundings, respectively.
17.2
The total energy of the universe is 
constant, but the entropy is increasing.
I
n this text we have emphasized the 
meaning of the second law of thermo-
dynamics‚Äîthat the entropy of the 
universe is always increasing. Although 
the results of all our experiments sup-
port this conclusion, this does not mean 
that order cannot appear spontaneously 
in a given part of the universe. The best 
example of this phenomenon involves 
the assembly of cells in living organisms. 
Of course, when a process that creates 
an ordered system is examined in detail, 
it is found that other parts of the pro-
cess involve an increase in disorder such 
that the sum of all the entropy changes 
is positive. In fact, scientists are now 
finding that the search for maximum 
entropy in one part of a system can be a 
powerful force for organization in 
another part of the system.
To understand how entropy can be 
an organizing force, look at the accom-
panying figure. In a system containing 
large and small ‚Äúballs‚Äù as shown in the 
figure, the small balls can ‚Äúherd‚Äù the 
large balls into clumps in the corners 
and near the walls. This clears out the 
maximum space for the small balls so 
that they can move more freely, thus 
maximizing the entropy of the system, 
as demanded by the second law of 
thermodynamics.
In essence, the ability to maximize 
entropy by sorting  different-sized 
objects creates a kind of attractive force, 
called a depletion, or excluded-volume, 
force. These ‚Äúentropic forces‚Äù operate for 
objects in the size range of approxi-
mately 1028 to approximately 1026 m. For 
entropy-induced ordering to occur, the 
particles must be constantly jostling 
each other and must be constantly 
agitated by solvent molecules, thus 
making gravity unimportant.
There is increasing evidence that 
entropic ordering is important in many 
biological systems. For example, this 
phenomenon seems to be responsible 
for the clumping of sickle-cell hemo-
globin in the presence of much smaller 
proteins that act as the ‚Äúsmaller balls.‚Äù 
Entropic forces also have been linked 
to the clustering of DNA in cells with-
out nuclei, and Allen Minton of the 
National Institutes of Health in 
Bethesda, Maryland, is studying the 
role of entropic forces in the binding of 
proteins to cell membranes.
Entropic ordering also appears in 
nonbiological settings, especially in the 
ways polymer molecules clump 
together. For example, polymers added 
to paint to improve the flow character-
istics of the paint actually caused it to 
 coagulate because of depletion forces.
Thus, as you probably have con-
cluded already, entropy is a complex 
issue. As entropy drives the universe to 
its ultimate death of maximum chaos, it 
provides some order along the way.

To predict whether a given process will be spontaneous, we must know the sign of 
DSuniv. If DSuniv is positive, the entropy of the universe increases, and the process is 
spontaneous in the direction written. If DSuniv is negative, the process is spontaneous in 
the opposite direction. If DSuniv is zero, the process has no tendency to occur, and the 
system is at equilibrium. To predict whether a process is spontaneous, we must con-
sider the entropy changes that occur both in the system and in the surroundings and 
then take their sum.
CRITICAL THINKING What if DSuniv was a state function? How 
would the world be different?
The Second Law
In a living cell, large molecules are assembled from simple ones. Is this process con-
sistent with the second law of thermodynamics?
SOLUTION
To reconcile the operation of an order-producing cell with the second law of thermo-
dynamics, we must remember that DSuniv, not DSsys, must be positive for a process to 
be spontaneous. A process for which DSsys is negative can be spontaneous if the associ-
ated DSsurr is both larger and positive. The operation of a cell is such a process.
See Questions 17.11 and 17.12
17.3 The Effect of Temperature 
on Spontaneity
To explore the interplay of DSsys and DSsurr in determining the sign of DSuniv, we will 
first discuss the change of state for 1 mole of water from liquid to gas,
H2O1 l 2 h H2O1 g2
considering the water to be the system and everything else the surroundings.
What happens to the entropy of water in this process? A mole of liquid water (18 g) 
has a volume of approximately 18 mL. A mole of gaseous water at 1 atmosphere and 
1008C occupies a volume of approximately 31 L. Clearly, there are many more posi-
tions available to the water molecules in a volume of 31 L than in 18 mL, and the 
vaporization of water is favored by this increase in positional probability. That is, for 
this process the entropy of the system increases; DSsys has a positive sign.
 
What about the entropy change in the surroundings? Although we will not prove it 
here, entropy changes in the surroundings are determined primarily by the flow of 
energy into or out of the system as heat. To understand this, suppose an exothermic 
process transfers 50 J of energy as heat to the surroundings, where it becomes thermal 
energy, that is, kinetic energy associated with the random motions of atoms. Thus this 
flow of energy into the surroundings increases the random motions of atoms there and 
thereby increases the entropy of the surroundings. The sign of DSsurr is positive. When 
an endothermic process occurs in the system, it produces the opposite effect. Heat 
flows from the surroundings to the system, and the random motions of the atoms  
in the surroundings decrease, decreasing the entropy of the surroundings. The vapor-
ization of water is an endothermic process. Thus, for this change of state, DSsurr is 
negative.

Remember it is the sign of DSuniv that tells us whether the vaporization of water is 
spontaneous. We have seen that DSsys is positive and favors the process and that DSsurr
is negative and unfavorable. Thus the components of DSuniv are in opposition. Which 
one controls the situation? The answer depends on the temperature. We know that at 
a pressure of 1 atmosphere, water changes spontaneously from liquid to gas at all 
temperatures above 1008C. Below 1008C, the opposite process (condensation) is 
spontaneous.
 
Since DSsys and DSsurr are in opposition for the vaporization of water, the tempera-
ture must have an effect on the relative importance of these two terms. To understand 
why this is so, we must discuss in more detail the factors that control the entropy 
changes in the surroundings. The central idea is that the entropy changes in the 
surroundings are primarily determined by heat flow. An exothermic process in the 
system increases the entropy of the surroundings, because the resulting energy flow 
increases the random motions in the surroundings. This means that exothermicity is 
an important driving force for spontaneity. In earlier chapters we have seen that a 
system tends to undergo changes that lower its energy. We now understand the reason 
for this tendency. When a system at constant temperature moves to a lower energy, the 
energy it gives up is transferred to the surroundings, leading to an increase in entropy 
there.
 
The significance of exothermicity as a driving force depends on the temperature at 
which the process occurs. That is, the magnitude of DSsurr depends on the temperature 
at which the heat is transferred. We will not attempt to prove this fact here. Instead, we 
offer an analogy. Suppose that you have $50 to give away. Giving it to a millionaire 
would not create much of an impression‚Äîa millionaire has money to spare. However, 
to a poor college student, $50 would represent a significant sum and would be received 
with considerable joy. The same principle can be applied to energy transfer via the 
flow of heat. If 50 J of energy is transferred to the surroundings, the impact of that 
event depends greatly on the temperature. If the temperature of the surroundings is 
very high, the atoms there are in rapid motion. The 50 J of energy will not make a large 
percent change in these motions. On the other hand, if 50 J of energy is transferred to 
the surroundings at a very low temperature, where atomic motion is slow, the energy 
will cause a large percent change in these motions. The impact of the transfer of a 
given quantity of energy as heat to or from the surroundings will be greater at 
lower temperatures.
 
For our purposes, there are two important characteristics of the entropy changes 
that occur in the surroundings:
1. The sign of DSsurr depends on the direction of the heat flow. At constant tempera-
ture, an exothermic process in the system causes heat to flow into the surround-
ings, increasing the random motions and thus the entropy of the surroundings. 
For this case, DSsurr is positive. The opposite is true for an endothermic process 
in a system at constant temperature. Note that although the driving force described 
here really results from the change in entropy, it is often described in terms of 
energy: Nature tends to seek the lowest possible energy.
2. The magnitude of DSsurr depends on the temperature. The transfer of a given 
quantity of energy as heat produces a much greater percent change in the ran-
domness of the surroundings at a low temperature than it does at a high tempera-
ture. Thus DSsurr depends directly on the quantity of heat transferred and inversely 
on temperature. In other words, the tendency for the system to lower its energy 
becomes a more important driving force at lower temperatures.

In a process occurring at constant

These ideas are summarized as follows:
 Exothermic process:¬†¬†¬†¬† DSsurr 5 1quantity of heat 1J2
temperature 1K2
 Endothermic process:¬†¬†¬†¬† DSsurr 5 2quantity of heat 1J2

We can express DSsurr in terms of the change in enthalpy DH for a process occurring 
at constant pressure, since
Heat flow 1constant P2 5 change in enthalpy 5 DH
Recall that DH consists of two parts: a sign and a number. The sign indicates the direc-
tion of flow, where a plus sign means into the system (endothermic) and a minus sign 
means out of the system (exothermic). The number indicates the quantity of energy.
 
Combining all these concepts produces the following definition of DSsurr for a reac-
tion that takes place under conditions of constant temperature (in kelvins) and pressure:
DSsurr 5 2DH
T
The minus sign is necessary because the sign of DH is determined with respect to the 
reaction system, and this equation expresses a property of the surroundings. This 
means that if the reaction is exothermic, DH has a negative sign, but since heat flows 
into the surroundings, DSsurr is positive.
Determining DSsurr
In the metallurgy of antimony, the pure metal is recovered via different reactions, 
depending on the composition of the ore. For example, iron is used to reduce antimony 
in sulfide ores:
 Sb2S31s2 1 3Fe1s2 h 2Sb1s2 1 3FeS1s2¬†¬†¬†¬† DH 5 2125 kJ
Carbon is used as the reducing agent for oxide ores:
 Sb4O61s2 1 6C1s2 h 4Sb1s2 1 6CO1 g2¬†¬†¬†¬† DH 5 778 kJ
Calculate DSsurr for each of these reactions at 258C and 1 atm.
 
SOLUTION 
We use
DSsurr 5 2DH

For the sulfide ore reaction,
DSsurr 5 22125 kJ

Note that DSsurr is positive, as it should be, since this reaction is exothermic and heat 
flow occurs to the surroundings, increasing the randomness of the surroundings.
 
For the oxide ore reaction,
DSsurr 5 2778 kJ

In this case DSsurr is negative because heat flow occurs from the surroundings to the 
system.

We have seen that the spontaneity of a process is determined by the entropy change 
it produces in the universe. We also have seen that DSuniv has two components, DSsys
and DSsurr. If for some process both DSsys and DSsurr are positive, then DSuniv is positive, 
and the process is spontaneous. If, on the other hand, both DSsys and DSsurr are negative, 
the process does not occur in the direction indicated but is spontaneous in the opposite 
direction. Finally, if DSsys and DSsurr have opposite signs, the spontaneity of the process 
depends on the sizes of the opposing terms. These cases are summarized in Table 17.3.
 
We can now understand why spontaneity is often dependent on temperature and 
thus why water spontaneously freezes below 08C and melts above 08C. The term DSsurr 
is  temperature-dependent. Since
DSsurr 5 2DH
T
at constant pressure, the value of DSsurr changes markedly with temperature. The magni-
tude of DSsurr will be very small at high temperatures and will increase as the temperature 
decreases. That is, exothermicity is most important as a driving force at low temperatures.
 
17.4 Free Energy
So far we have used DSuniv to predict the spontaneity of a process. However, another 
thermodynamic function is also related to spontaneity and is especially useful in deal-
ing with the temperature dependence of spontaneity. This function is called the free 
energy, which is symbolized by G and defined by the relationship
G 5 H 2 TS
where H is the enthalpy, T is the Kelvin temperature, and S is the entropy.
 
For a process that occurs at constant temperature, the change in free energy (DG) is 
given by the equation
DG 5 DH 2 TDS
Note that all quantities here refer to the system. From this point on we will follow the 
usual convention that when no subscript is included, the quantity refers to the system.
 
To see how this equation relates to spontaneity, we divide both sides of the equation 
by 2T to produce
2DG
T 5 2DH
T 1 DS
Remember that at constant temperature and pressure
DSsurr 5 2DH

So we can write

We have shown that
DSuniv 5 2DG
T ¬†¬†¬†¬†at constant T and P
This result is very important. It means that a process carried out at constant tempera-
ture and pressure will be spontaneous only if DG is negative. A process (at constant  
T and P) is spontaneous in the direction in which the free energy decreases (2DG 
means 1DSuniv).
 
Now we have two functions that can be used to predict spontaneity: the entropy of 
the universe, which applies to all processes, and free energy, which can be used for 
processes carried out at constant temperature and pressure. Since so many chemical 
reactions occur under the latter conditions, free energy is the more useful to chemists.
 
Let‚Äôs use the free energy equation to predict the spontaneity of the melting of ice:
H2O1s2 h H2O1 l 2
for which 
DH¬∞ 5 6.03 3 103 J/mol¬†¬†and¬†¬†DS¬∞ 5 22.1 J/K # mol
Results of the calculations of DSuniv and DG8 at 2108C, 08C, and 108C are shown in 
Table 17.4. These data predict that the process is spontaneous at 108C; that is, ice melts 
at this temperature because DSuniv is positive and DG8 is negative. The opposite is true 
at 2108C, where water freezes spontaneously.
 
Why is this so? The answer lies in the fact that DSsys (DS8) and DSsurr oppose each 
other. The term DS8 favors the melting of ice because of the increase in positional 
 entropy, and DSsurr favors the freezing of water because it is an exothermic process. At 
 temperatures below 08C, the change of state occurs in the exothermic direction because 
DSsurr is larger in magnitude than DSsys. But above 08C the change occurs in the direc-
tion in which DSsys is favorable, since in this case DSsys is larger in magnitude than 
DSsurr. At 08C the opposing tendencies just balance, and the two states coexist; there is 
no driving force in either direction. An equilibrium exists between the two states of 
water. Note that DSuniv is equal to 0 at 08C.
 
We can reach the same conclusions by examining DG8. At 2108, DG8 is positive 
because the DH8 term is larger than the TDS8 term. The opposite is true at 108C. At 
08C, DH8 is equal to TDS8 and DG8 is equal to 0. This means that solid H2O and liquid 
H2O have the same free energy at 08C (DG8 5 Gliquid 2 Gsolid), and the system is at 
equilibrium.
 
We can understand the temperature dependence of spontaneity by examining the 
behavior of DG. For a process occurring at constant temperature and pressure,
DG 5 DH 2 TDS
 
If DH and DS favor opposite processes, spontaneity will depend on temperature in 
such a way that the exothermic direction will be favored at low temperatures. For 
example, for the process
H2O1s2 h H2O1 l 2

*Note that at 108C, DS8 (DSsys) controls, and the process occurs even though it is endothermic. At 2108C, the magnitude of DSsurr is larger than that of 
DS8, so the process is spontaneous in the opposite (exothermic) direction.

DH is positive and DS is positive. The natural tendency for this system to lower its 
energy is in opposition to its natural tendency to increase its positional randomness. At 
low temperatures, DH dominates, and at high temperatures, DS dominates. The various 
possible cases are summarized in Table 17.5.
CRITICAL THINKING Consider an ideal gas in a container fitted 
with a frictionless, massless piston. What if weight is added to the top of the 
piston? We would expect the gas to be compressed at constant temperature. 
For this to be true, DS would be negative (since the gas is compressed) and 
DH would be zero (since the process is at constant temperature). This would 
make DG positive. Does this mean the isothermal compression of the gas is not 
spontaneous? Defend your answer.

What is the normal boiling point of liquid Br2?
 
SOLUTION 
The vaporization process will be spontaneous at all temperatures where DG8 is negative. 
Note that DS8 favors the vaporization process because of the increase in positional 
entropy, and DH8 favors the opposite process, which is exothermic. These opposite 
tendencies will exactly balance at the boiling point of liquid Br2, since at this tempera-
ture liquid and gaseous Br2 are in equilibrium (DG8 5 0). We can find this temperature 
by setting DG8 5 0 in the equation

opposite process occurs spontaneously below this temperature. At 333 K, liquid and

liquid and gaseous phases of bromine coexist. This is the normal boiling point.
See Exercises 17.41 through 17.43
17.5 Entropy Changes in Aqueous 
Solutions
In Chapter 11 we discussed the concept of like dissolves like. This implies that an ionic 
solute [such as table salt, NaCl(s)] should dissolve in a polar solvent [such as water]. 
The process of forming a solution was given as a series of three steps as shown in Figs. 
11.1 and 11.2, and the overall DH¬∞soln for dissolving NaCl(s) in water was found to be 
positive (requires energy). Recall that to predict whether a given process (at constant 
temperature and pressure) is spontaneous, we must consider the change in free energy:
DG 5 DH 2 TDS
 
It is an experimental fact that NaCl(s) dissolves in water to form 1.0 M NaCl. Thus, 
DG¬∞ for this process must be negative. Since DH¬∞soln is positive and unfavorable, DS¬∞soln 
must be positive and large enough to make DG¬∞ negative (through the 2TDS¬∞ term). It 
is certainly not surprising that DS¬∞soln would be positive for this process. In considering 
the three steps of dissolution of a solute mentioned in Chapter 11, we would expect 
DS1 and DS2 to be positive since the solute and solvent are ‚Äúexpanded‚Äù in these steps. 
Also, DS3 would be expected to be positive in a general case because a solute is ran-
domly dispersed in the relatively large volume of solvent.
 
Thus, we might generalize for an ionic (or polar) solute dissolving in a polar solvent 
as follows: because DH¬∞soln contains large positive and negative contributions, it is diffi-
cult to predict the sign of DH¬∞soln. However, even if DH¬∞soln is positive, it is not expected to 
be so large that it would overwhelm the expected positive value of DS¬∞soln for this process. 
The overall effect is to make DG¬∞soln negative, thus the solution forms spontaneously.
 
However, as we noted in Chapter 10, water is not a typical liquid, with most of its 
unusual properties arising from the extensive hydrogen bonding present among the 
molecules. Because of water‚Äôs unique nature, we must be very cautious in using simple 
arguments to account for the solvent properties of water.
 
To illustrate the unusual nature of water as a solvent, consider the following values 
of DS¬∞soln for KCl(s), LiF(s), and CaS(s) forming aqueous solutions.
Process
DS¬∞soln (J/Kmol)
KCl(s) n K1(aq) 1 Cl2(aq)
75
LiF(s) n Li1(aq) 1 F2(aq)
236
CaS(s) n Ca21(aq) 1 S22(aq)
2138
Note that when KCl(s) is dissolved in water to form a 1.0 M solution, the value of 
DS¬∞soln is positive, as expected from the previous discussion. However, note that DS¬∞soln
is negative for the other two salts. Why? How could the random dispersal in water of 
ions formerly present in a highly ordered solid produce a negative entropy change?

Obviously, something must be occurring in the solution process that leads to 
increased order, which in some cases is large enough to dominate DS¬∞soln. There is little 
doubt that this ordering effect arises from the hydration of the ions. In describing aque-
ous solutions containing ionic solutes in Chapter 4, we discussed the fact that the polar 
water molecules are attracted to the ions to form hydrated species. The assembling of 
a group of water molecules around the ions is an order-producing phenomenon and 
would be expected to make a negative contribution to DS¬∞soln. Studies show that the 
more charge density an ion possesses, the greater this hydration effect will be. This 
idea is borne out by the data in the table above. For example, note that DS¬∞soln for KCl(s) 
is positive, but the value for LiF(s) is negative. This probably results from the smaller 
sizes (and larger charge densities) of Li1 and F2 compared with K1 and Cl2. The 
smaller ions presumably are able to bind to the hydrating water molecules more firmly 
and thus show a more negative value for DS¬∞soln. The charges on the ions are also impor-
tant. Note that CaS(s) exhibits a value for DS¬∞soln that is more negative than that for 
LiF(s), as might be expected for the more highly charged Ca21 and S22 ions.
 
As we can see, enthalpy changes alone are not enough to predict solubility‚Äîwe 
must also consider entropic effects. However, the dissolution process is so complex 
that successfully predicting whether a particular solute will dissolve in a given solvent 
is almost impossible. The only way to be certain about the solubility of a given solute 
in a solvent is to do the experiment.
 
17.6 Entropy Changes in Chemical 
Reactions
The second law of thermodynamics tells us that a process will be spontaneous if the 
entropy of the universe increases when the process occurs. We saw in Section 17.4 that 
for a process at constant temperature and pressure, we can use the change in free 
energy of the system to predict the sign of DSuniv and thus the direction in which it is 
spontaneous. So far we have applied these ideas only to physical processes, such as 
changes of state and the formation of solutions. However, the main business of chem-
istry is studying chemical reactions, and, therefore, we want to apply the second law 
to reactions.
 
First, we will consider the entropy changes accompanying chemical reactions that 
occur under conditions of constant temperature and pressure. As for the other types of 
processes we have considered, the entropy changes in the surroundings are determined 
by the heat flow that occurs as the reaction takes place. However, the entropy changes 
in the system (the reactants and products of the reaction) are determined by positional 
probability.
 
For example, in the ammonia synthesis reaction
N21 g2 1 3H21 g2 h 2NH31 g2
four reactant molecules become two product molecules, lowering the number of inde-
pendent units in the system, which leads to less positional disorder.

Fewer molecules mean fewer possible configurations. To help clarify this idea, con-
sider a special container with a million compartments, each large enough to hold a 
hydrogen molecule. Thus there are a million ways one H2 molecule can be placed in 
this container. But suppose we break the HOH bond and place the two independent  
H atoms in the same container. A little thought will convince you that there are many 
more than a million ways to place the two separate atoms. The number of arrange-
ments possible for the two independent atoms is much greater than the number for the 
molecule. Thus for the process
H2 h 2H
positional entropy increases.
 
Does positional entropy increase or decrease when the following reaction takes 
place?
4NH31 g2 1 5O21 g2 h 4NO1 g2 1 6H2O1 g2
In this case 9 gaseous molecules are changed to 10 gaseous molecules, and the posi-
tional entropy increases. There are more independent units as products than as reac-
tants. In general, when a reaction involves gaseous molecules, the change in 
positional entropy is dominated by the relative numbers of molecules of gaseous 
reactants and products. If the number of molecules of the gaseous products is greater 
than the number of molecules of the gaseous reactants, positional entropy typically 
increases, and DS will be positive for the reaction.
Predicting the Sign of DS8
Predict the sign of DS8 for each of the following reactions.
a. The thermal decomposition of solid calcium carbonate:
CaCO31s2 h CaO1s2 1 CO21 g2
b. The oxidation of SO2 in air:
2SO21 g2 1 O21 g2 h 2SO31 g2
 
SOLUTION 
a. Since in this reaction a gas is produced from a solid reactant, the positional entropy 
increases, and DS8 is positive.
b. Here three molecules of gaseous reactants become two molecules of gaseous 
products. Since the number of gas molecules decreases, positional entropy 
decreases, and DS8 is negative.
See Exercises 17.45 and 17.46
 
In thermodynamics it is the change in a certain function that usually is important. 
The change in enthalpy determines if a reaction is exothermic or endothermic at con-
stant pressure. The change in free energy determines if a process is spontaneous at 
constant temperature and pressure. It is fortunate that changes in thermodynamic func-
tions are sufficient for most purposes, since absolute values for many thermodynamic 
characteristics of a system, such as enthalpy or free energy, cannot be determined.
 
However, we can assign absolute entropy values. Consider a solid at 0 K, where 
 molecular motion virtually ceases. If the substance is a perfect crystal, its internal 
arrangement is absolutely regular [Fig. 17.5(a)]. There is only one way to achieve this 
 perfect order: Every particle must be in its place. For example, with N coins there is 
only one way to achieve the state of all heads. Thus a perfect crystal represents the 
lowest possible entropy; that is, the entropy of a perfect crystal at 0 K is zero. This is a 
statement of the third law of thermodynamics.
INTERACTIVE EXAMPLE 17.6
A perfect crystal at 0 K is an unattainable 
ideal, taken as a standard but never 
 actually observed.

As the temperature of a perfect crystal is increased, the random vibrational motions 
increase, and disorder increases within the crystal [Fig. 17.5(b)]. Thus the entropy of 
a substance increases with temperature. Since S is zero for a perfect crystal at 0 K,  
the entropy value for a substance at a particular temperature can be calculated by 
knowing the temperature dependence of entropy. (We will not show such calculations 
here.)
 
The standard entropy values (S8) of many common substances at 298 K and  
1 atm are listed in Appendix 4. From these values you will see that the entropy of a 
substance does indeed increase in going from solid to liquid to gas. One especially 
interesting feature of this table is the very low S8 value for diamond. The structure of 
diamond is highly ordered, with each carbon strongly bound to a tetrahedral arrange-
ment of four other carbon atoms (see Section 10.5, Fig. 10.22). This type of structure 
allows very little disorder and has a very low entropy, even at 298 K. Graphite has a 
slightly higher entropy because its layered structure allows for a little more disorder.
 
Because entropy is a state function of the system (it is not pathway-dependent), the 
entropy change for a given chemical reaction can be calculated by taking the differ-
ence between the standard entropy values of products and those of the reactants:
DS¬∞reaction 5 SnpS¬∞products 2 Snr S¬∞reactants
where, as usual, S represents the sum of the terms. It is important to note that entropy 
is an extensive property (it depends on the amount of substance present). This means 
that the number of moles of a given reactant (nr) or product (np) must be taken into 
account.

a substance is heated from 0 K to 298 K at 1 
atm pressure.

The reaction considered in Example 17.8 involves 3 moles of hydrogen gas on the 
reactant side and 3 moles of water vapor on the product side. Would you expect DS to 
be large or small for such a case? We have assumed that DS depends on the relative 
 numbers of molecules of gaseous reactants and products. Based on this assumption,

CHAPTER 17 Spontaneity, Entropy, and Free Energy

DS should be near zero for this reaction. However, DS is large and positive. Why is this 
so? The large value for DS results from the difference in the entropy values for hydro-
gen gas and water vapor. The reason for this difference can be traced to the difference 
in molecular structure. Because it is a nonlinear, triatomic molecule, H2O has more 
rotational and vibrational motions (Fig. 17.6) than does the diatomic H2 molecule. 
Thus the standard entropy value for H2O(g) is greater than that for H2(g). Generally, 
the more  complex the molecule, the higher the standard entropy value.
17.7 Free Energy and Chemical 
Reactions
For chemical reactions we are often interested in the standard free energy change 
(DG8), the change in free energy that will occur if the reactants in their standard states 
are converted to the products in their standard states. For example, for the ammonia 
synthesis reaction at 258C,
N21 g2 1 3H21 g2 m 2NH31 g2
DG¬∞ 5 233.3 kJ 
(17.1)
This DG8 value represents the change in free energy when 1 mole of nitrogen gas at  
1 atm reacts with 3 moles of hydrogen gas at 1 atm to produce 2 moles of gaseous NH3 
at 1 atm.
 
It is important to recognize that the standard free energy change for a reaction is not 
measured directly. For example, we can measure heat flow in a calorimeter to deter-
mine DH8, but we cannot measure DG8 this way. The value of DG8 for the ammonia 
synthesis in Equation (17.1) was not obtained by mixing 1 mole of N2 and 3 moles of 
H2 in a flask and measuring the change in free energy as 2 moles of NH3 formed. For 
one thing, if we mixed 1 mole of N2 and 3 moles of H2 in a flask, the system would go 
to equilibrium rather than to completion. Also, we have no instrument that measures 
free energy. However, while we cannot directly measure DG8 for a reaction, we can 
calculate it from other measured quantities, as we will see later in this section.

cule with fewer possible motions.

Why is it useful to know DG8 for a reaction? As we will see in more detail later in 
this chapter, knowing the DG8 values for several reactions allows us to compare the 
relative tendency of these reactions to occur. The more negative the value of DG8, the 
further a reaction will go to the right to reach equilibrium. We must use standard-state 
free energies to make this comparison because free energy varies with pressure or 
concentration. Thus, to get an accurate comparison of reaction tendencies, we must 
compare all reactions under the same pressure or concentration conditions. We will 
have more to say about the significance of DG8 later.
 
There are several ways to calculate DG8. One common method uses the equation
DG¬∞ 5 DH¬∞ 2 TDS¬∞
which applies to a reaction carried out at constant temperature. For example, for the 
reaction
C1s2 1 O21 g2 h CO21 g2
the values of DH8 and DS8 are known to be 2393.5 kJ and 3.05 J/K, respectively, and 
DG8 can be calculated at 298 K as follows:
 DG¬∞ 5 DH¬∞ 2 TDS¬∞
 5 23.935 3 105 J 2 1298 K2 13.05 J/K2
 5 23.944 3 105 J

Calculating DH8, DS8, and DG8
Consider the reaction
2SO21 g2 1 O21 g2 h 2SO31 g2
carried out at 258C and 1 atm. Calculate DH8, DS8, and DG8 using the following data:

The value of DH8 can be calculated from the enthalpies of formation using the equation

tion discussed in Section 17.6:

The value of DG8 tells us nothing about 
the rate of a reaction, only its eventual 
equilibrium position.

A second method for calculating DG for a reaction takes advantage of the fact that, 
like enthalpy, free energy is a state function. Therefore, we can use procedures for 
finding DG that are similar to those for finding DH using Hess‚Äôs law.
 
To illustrate this method for calculating the free energy change, we will obtain DG8 
for the reaction
 
2CO1 g2 1 O21 g2 h 2CO21 g2  
(17.2)
from the following data:
 
 2CH41 g2 1 3O21 g2 h 2CO1 g2 1 4H2O1 g2¬†¬†¬†¬† DG¬∞ 5 21088 kJ (17.3)
 
 CH41 g2 1 2O21 g2 h CO21 g2 1 2H2O1 g2¬†¬†¬†¬†  DG¬∞ 5 2801 kJ  (17.4)
Note that CO(g) is a reactant in Equation (17.2). This means that Equation (17.3) must 
be reversed, since CO(g) is a product in that reaction as written. When a reaction is 
reversed, the sign of DG8 is also reversed. In Equation (17.4), CO2(g) is a product, as 
it is in Equation (17.2), but only one molecule of CO2 is formed. Thus Equation (17.4) 
must be multiplied by 2, which means the DG8 value for Equation (17.4) also must be 
multiplied by 2. Free energy is an extensive property, since it is defined by two exten-
sive properties, H and S.

same way as the DH values.

equation to Equation (17.5):

               5 23 kJ
 
Since DG8 is negative for this process, diamond should spontaneously change to 
graphite at 258C and 1 atm. However, the reaction is so slow under these conditions 
that we do not observe the process. This is another example of kinetic rather than ther-
modynamic control of a reaction. We can say that diamond is kinetically stable with 
respect to graphite even though it is thermodynamically unstable.
See Exercises 17.63 and 17.64
 
In Example 17.10 we saw that the process
Cdiamond1s2 h Cgraphite1s2
is spontaneous but very slow at 258C and 1 atm. The reverse process can be made to 
occur at high temperatures and pressures. Diamond has a more compact structure and 
thus a higher density than graphite, so exerting very high pressure causes it to become 
thermodynamically favored. If high temperatures are also used to make the process 
fast enough to be feasible, diamonds can be made from graphite. The conditions typi-
cally used involve temperatures greater than 10008C and pressures of about 105 atm. 
About half of all industrial diamonds are made this way.
 
A third method for calculating the free energy change for a reaction uses standard 
free energies of formation. The standard free energy of formation (DG8f) of a sub-
stance is defined as the change in free energy that accompanies the formation of 1 mole 
of that substance from its constituent elements with all reactants and products in their 
standard states. For the formation of glucose (C6H12O6), the appropriate reaction is
6C1s2 1 6H21 g2 1 3O21 g2 h C6H12O61s2
The standard free energy associated with this process is called the free energy of for-
mation of glucose. Values of the standard free energy of formation are useful in calcu-
lating DG8 for specific chemical reactions using the equation
DG¬∞ 5 SnpDG¬∞f 1products2 2 SnrDG¬∞f 1reactants2
 
Values of DGf8 for many common substances are listed in Appendix 4. Note that, 
analogous to the enthalpy of formation, the standard free energy of formation of an 
element in its standard state is zero. Also note that the number of moles of each reac-
tant (nr) and product (np) must be used when calculating DG8 for a reaction.
INTERACTIVE EXAMPLE 17.10
The standard state of an element is its most 
stable state of 25¬∞C and 1 atm.
Calculating DG8 is very similar to 
calculating DH8, as shown in Section 6.4.

Free Energy and Spontaneity
A chemical engineer wants to determine the feasibility of making ethanol (C2H5OH) 
by reacting water with ethylene (C2H4) according to the equation
C2H41 g2 1 H2O1 l 2 h C2H5OH1 l 2
Is this reaction spontaneous under standard conditions?
 
SOLUTION 
To determine the spontaneity of this reaction under standard conditions, we must deter-
mine DG8 for the reaction. We can do this using standard free energies of formation at 
258C from Appendix 4:
 DG¬∞f 1C2H5OH1

Although the reaction considered in Example 17.12 is spontaneous, other features 
of the reaction must be studied to see if the process is feasible. For example, the chemi-
cal engineer will need to study the kinetics of the reaction to determine whether it  
is fast enough to be useful and, if it is not, whether a catalyst can be found to enhance 
the rate. In doing these studies, the engineer must remember that DG8 depends on 
temperature:
DG¬∞ 5 DH¬∞ 2 TDS¬∞
Thus, if the process must be carried out at high temperatures to be fast enough to be 
feasible, DG8 must be recalculated at that temperature from the DH8 and DS8 values for 
the reaction.
Nonspontaneous Reactions 
In order for a reaction to be spontaneous (thermodynamically favored), the value of 
DG must be less than zero (negative) at constant pressure and temperature. But reac-
tions for which DG . 0 can be made to proceed. We can cause these so-called thermo-
dynamically unfavorable reactions to occur by either applying external energy or by 
coupling these unfavorable reactions to thermodynamically favorable ones.
 
As we will see in Chapter 18 that we can use electrical energy to produce a chemi-
cal change by means of an electrolytic cell. In addition, electromagnetic radiation may 
be used because the absorption of photons can initiate a reaction. This is what happens 
when carbon dioxide is converted to glucose through photosynthesis:
6CO2(g) 1 6H2O(l) n C6H12O6(aq) 1 O2(g)
 
For this reaction, DG¬∞ 5 12880 kJ/mol, making it thermodynamically unfavorable. 
However, light energy is used to initiate a series of steps that provide energy to carry out 
the reaction above. Note, then, that it is not the light energy itself that is used to carry 
out the reaction. For example, in photosynthesis, the absorption of photons in the visi-
ble range causes the formation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from adenosine diphos-
phate (ADP). When the plant converts ATP back to ADP, a great deal of energy is 
released, which is then used to convert carbon dioxide to glucose. Thus, a thermody-
namically favorable reaction drives the thermodynamically unfavorable reaction. We 
say these reactions are coupled. Many biological systems use the energy derived from 
the conversion of ATP to ADP to run thermodynamically unfavorable reactions.
 
For reactions to be coupled, the reactions must have common intermediates. We 
have seen this idea in Section 16.3 when considering the dissolving of AgCl(s) in NH3. 
The series of relevant reactions are:
 
AgCl(s) 34 Ag1(aq) 1 Cl2(aq) 
Ksp 5 1.6 3 10210
 
Ag1 1 NH3 34 Ag(NH3)1 
K1 5 2.1 3 103
Ag(NH3)1 1 NH3 34 Ag(NH3)21 
K2 5 8.2 3 103
The overall reaction is given as:
AgCl(s) 1 2NH3 34 Ag(NH3)21 1 Cl2  K 5 2.8 3 1023
where K 5 Ksp 3 K1 3 K2.
 
We can see that the dissolution of AgCl(s) in water (as shown in the first reaction in 
the series) is very unfavorable. Recall that DG¬∞ 5 2RTln(K). Thus, for AgCl(s) dis-
solving in water, DG¬∞ 5 155.9 kJ/mol, which is thermodynamically unfavorable.
 
For the second and third reactions in the series, DG¬∞ 5 219.0 kJ/mol and 
222.3 kJ/mol, respectively. These reactions are thermodynamically favorable.
 
For the overall reaction of dissolving AgCl(s) in NH3, DG¬∞ 5 114.6 kJ/mol. 
Although this is still not thermodynamically favorable, it is more favorable (that is, 
less positive) than the reaction of dissolving AgCl(s) in water.

We can also drive the overall reaction to the right by using an excess of NH3, as 
described by Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs principle. As seen in Section 16.3, the solubility of AgCl(s) 
in NH3 is more than 36,000 times as soluble in 10.0 M NH3 as it is in water. Thus, even 
though the reaction is thermodynamically unfavorable, we can still obtain a relatively 
large amount of products depending on our initial conditions.
17.8 The Dependence of Free Energy 
on Pressure
In this chapter we have seen that a system at constant temperature and pressure will 
proceed spontaneously in the direction that lowers its free energy. This is why reac-
tions proceed until they reach equilibrium. The equilibrium position represents 
the lowest free  energy value available to a particular reaction system. The free 
energy of a reaction system changes as the reaction proceeds, because free energy 
is dependent on the pressure of a gas or on the concentration of species in solution. 
We will deal only with the  pressure dependence of the free energy of an ideal gas. 
The dependence of free energy on concentration can be developed using similar 
reasoning.
To understand the pressure dependence of free energy, we need to know how pres-
sure affects the thermodynamic functions that comprise free energy, that is, enthalpy 
and entropy (recall that G 5 H 2 TS). For an ideal gas, enthalpy is not pressure-
dependent. However, entropy does depend on pressure because of its dependence  
on volume. Consider 1 mole of an ideal gas at a given temperature. At a volume of  
10.0 L, the gas has many more positions available for its molecules than if its volume 
is 1.0 L. The positional entropy is greater in the larger volume. In summary, at a given 
temperature for 1 mole of ideal gas
Slarge volume . Ssmall volume
or, since pressure and volume are inversely related,
Slow pressure . Shigh pressure
We have shown qualitatively that the entropy and therefore the free energy of an 
ideal gas depend on its pressure. Using a more detailed argument, which we will not 
consider here, it can be shown that
G 5 G¬∞ 1 RT ln1P2
where G8 is the free energy of the gas at a pressure of 1 atm, G is the free energy of the 
gas at a pressure of P atm, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the Kelvin 
temperature.
 
To see how the change in free energy for a reaction depends on pressure, we will 
consider the ammonia synthesis reaction

where Q is the reaction quotient (from the law of mass action), T is the temperature 
(K), R is the gas law constant and is equal to 8.3145 J/K ? mol, DG8 is the free energy 
change for the reaction with all reactants and products at a pressure of 1 atm, and 
DG is the free energy change for the reaction for the specified pressures of reactants 
and products.
Calculating DG8
One method for synthesizing methanol (CH3OH) involves reacting carbon monoxide 
and hydrogen gases:
CO1 g2 1 2H21 g2 h CH3OH1 l 2
Calculate DG at 258C for this reaction where carbon monoxide gas at 5.0 atm and 
hydrogen gas at 3.0 atm are converted to liquid methanol.

To calculate DG for this process, we use the equation
DG 5 DG¬∞ 1 RT ln1Q2

Note that this is the value of DG8 for the reaction of 1 mole of CO with 2 moles of 
H2 to produce 1 mole of CH3OH. We might call this the value of DG8 for one ‚Äúround‚Äù 
of the reaction or for 1 mole of the reaction. Thus the DG8 value might better be written 
as 22.9 3 104 J/mol of reaction, or 22.9 3 104 J/mol rxn.

Note that DG is significantly more negative than DG8, implying that the reaction is 
more spontaneous at reactant pressures greater than 1 atm. We might expect this result 
from Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs principle.
See Exercises 17.71 and 17.72
The Meaning of DG for a Chemical Reaction
In this section we have learned to calculate DG for chemical reactions under various 
conditions. For example, in Example 17.13 the calculations show that the formation of 
CH3OH(l) from CO(g) at 5.0 atm reacting with H2(g) at 3.0 atm is spontaneous. What 
does this result mean? Does it mean that if we mixed 1.0 mole of CO(g) and 2.0 moles 
of H2(g) together at pressures of 5.0 and 3.0 atm, respectively, that 1.0 mole of 
CH3OH(l) would form in the reaction flask? The answer is no. This answer may sur-
prise you in view of what has been said in this section. It is true that 1.0 mole of 
CH3OH(l) has a lower free energy than 1.0 mole of CO(g) at 5.0 atm plus 2.0 moles of 
H2(g) at 3.0 atm. However, when CO(g) and H2(g) are mixed under these conditions, 
there is an even lower free energy available to this system than 1.0 mole of pure 
CH3OH(l). For reasons we will discuss shortly, the system can achieve the lowest pos-
sible free energy by going to equilibrium, not by going to completion. At the equilib-
rium position, some of the CO(g) and H2(g) will remain in the reaction flask. So even 
though 1.0 mole of pure CH3OH(l) is at a lower free energy than 1.0 mole of CO(g) 
and 2.0 moles of H2(g) at 5.0 and 3.0 atm, respectively, the reaction system will stop 
short of forming 1.0 mole of CH3OH(l). The reaction stops short of completion because 
the equilibrium mixture of CH3OH(l), CO(g), and H2(g) exists at the lowest possible 
free  energy available to the system.
 
To illustrate this point, we will explore a mechanical example. Consider balls roll-
ing down the two hills shown in Fig. 17.7. Note that in both cases point B has a lower 
potential energy than point A.
 
In Fig. 17.7(a) the ball will roll to point B. This diagram is analogous to a phase 
change. For example, at 258C ice will spontaneously change completely to liquid 
Note in this case that DG is defined for  
‚Äú1 mole of the reaction,‚Äù that is, for 1 mole 
of CO(g) reacting with 2 moles of H2(g) to 
form 1 mole of CH3OH(l). Thus DG, DG8, and 
RT ln(Q) all have units of J/mol of reaction. 
In this case the units of R are actually J/K ? 
mol of reaction, although they are usually 
not written this way.

17.8 The Dependence of Free Energy on Pressure

water, because the latter has the lowest free energy. In this case liquid water is the only 
choice. There is no intermediate mixture of ice and water with lower free energy.
The situation is different for a chemical reaction system, as illustrated in Fig. 17.7(b). 
In Fig. 17.7(b) the ball will not get to point B because there is a lower potential energy 
at point C. Like the ball, a chemical system will seek the lowest possible free energy, 
which, for reasons we will discuss below, is the equilibrium position.
Therefore, although the value of DG for a given reaction system tells us whether the 
products or reactants are favored under a given set of conditions, it does not mean that 
the system will proceed to pure products (if DG is negative) or remain at pure reactants 
(if DG is positive). Instead, the system will spontaneously go to the equilibrium posi-
tion, the lowest possible free energy available to it. In the next section we will see that 
the value of DG8 for a particular reaction tells us exactly where this position will be.
 
17.9 Free Energy and Equilibrium
When the components of a given chemical reaction are mixed, they will proceed, rap-
idly or slowly depending on the kinetics of the process, to the equilibrium position. In 
Chapter 13 we defined the equilibrium position as the point at which the forward and 
reverse reaction rates are equal. In this chapter we look at equilibrium from a thermo-
dynamic point of view, and we find that the equilibrium point occurs at the lowest 
value of free energy available to the reaction system. As it turns out, the two definitions 
give the same equilibrium state, which must be the case for both the kinetic and ther-
modynamic models to be valid.
 
To understand the relationship of free energy to equilibrium, let‚Äôs consider the fol-
lowing simple hypothetical reaction:
A1 g2 m B1 g2
where 1.0 mole of gaseous A is initially placed in a reaction vessel at a pressure of 
2.0¬†atm. The free energies for A and B are diagramed as shown in Fig. 17.8(a). As A 
reacts to form B, the total free energy of the system changes, yielding the following 
results:
 Free energy of A 5 GA 5 G¬∞A 1 RT ln1PA2
 Free energy of B 5 GB 5 G¬∞B 1 RT ln1PB2
 Total free energy of system 5 G 5 GA 1 GB
As A changes to B, GA will decrease because PA is decreasing [Fig. 17.8(b)]. In con-
trast, GB will increase because PB is increasing. The reaction will proceed to the right 
as long as the total free energy of the system decreases (as long as GB is less than GA). 
At some point the pressures of A and B reach the values PeA and PeB that make GA equal 
to GB. The system has reached equilibrium [Fig. 17.8(c)]. Since A at pressure PeA and

B at pressure PeB have the same free energy (GA equals GB), DG is zero for A at pres-
sure PeA changing to B at pressure PeB. The system has reached minimum free energy. 
There is no longer any driving force to change A to B or B to A, so the system remains 
at this position (the pressures of A and B remain constant).
 
Suppose that for the experiment described above, the plot of free energy versus the 
mole fraction of A reacted is defined as shown in Fig. 17.9(a). In this experiment, mini-
mum free energy is reached when 75% of A has been changed to B. At this point, the 
pressure of A is 0.25 times the original pressure, or
10.252 12.0 atm2 5 0.50 atm
The pressure of B is
10.752 12.0 atm2 5 1.5 atm
Since this is the equilibrium position, we can use the equilibrium pressures to calculate 
a value for K for the reaction in which A is converted to B at this temperature:
K 5 P B 
e
P A  
e 5 1.5 atm
0.50 atm 5 3.0
 
Exactly the same equilibrium point would be achieved if we placed 1.0 mole of 
pure B(g) in the flask at a pressure of 2.0 atm. In this case B would change to A until 
equilibrium (GB 5 GA) is reached. This is shown in Fig. 17.9(b).
 
The overall free energy curve for this system is shown in Fig. 17.9(c). Note that any 
mixture of A(g) and B(g) containing 1.0 mole of gas (A plus B) at a total pressure of  
2.0 atm will react until it reaches the minimum in the curve.
 
In summary, when substances undergo a chemical reaction, the reaction proceeds to 
the minimum free energy (equilibrium), which corresponds to the point where
Gproducts 5 Greactants¬†¬†or¬†¬†DG 5 Gproducts 2 Greactants 5 0
For the reaction A(g) m B(g), the 
pressure is constant during the reaction, 
since the same number of gas molecules is 
always present.

We can now establish a quantitative relationship between free energy and the value 
of the equilibrium constant. We have seen that
DG 5 DG¬∞ 1 RT ln1Q2
and at equilibrium DG equals 0 and Q equals K.
So 
DG 5 0 5 DG¬∞ 1 RT ln1K2
or 
DG¬∞ 5 2RT ln1K2
We must note the following characteristics of this very important equation.
Case 1: DG8 5 0. When DG8 equals zero for a particular reaction, the free energies 
of the reactants and products are equal when all components are in the standard 
states (1 atm for gases). The system is at equilibrium when the pressures of all 
reactants and products are 1 atm, which means that K equals 1.
Case 2: DG8 , 0. In this case DG8 (G8products 2 G8reactants) is negative, which means 
that
G¬∞products , G¬∞reactants
If a flask contains the reactants and products, all at 1 atm, the system will not be 
at equilibrium. Since (G8products is less than G8reactants, the system will adjust to the 
right to reach equilibrium. In this case K will be greater than 1, since the pressures 
of the products at equilibrium will be greater than 1 atm and the pressures of the 
reactants at equilibrium will be less than 1 atm.
Case 3: DG8 . 0. Since DG8 (G8products 2 G8reactants) is positive,
G¬∞reactants , G¬∞products
If a flask contains the reactants and products, all at 1 atm, the system will not be 
at equilibrium. In this case the system will adjust to the left (toward the reactants, 
which have a lower free energy) to reach equilibrium. The value of K will be less 
than 1, since at equilibrium the pressures of the reactants will be greater than  
1 atm and the pressures of the products will be less than 1 atm.
 
These results are summarized in Table 17.6 and Figure 17.10. The value of K for a 
specific reaction can be calculated from the equation
DG¬∞ 5 2RT ln1K2
as is shown in Examples 17.14 and 17.15.

Since DG 5 0, the reactants and products have the same free energies at these 
partial pressures. The system is already at equilibrium, and no shift will occur.
b. The partial pressures given here are all 1.00 atm, which means that the system is

The negative value for DG8 means that in their standard states the products have a 
lower free energy than the reactants. Thus the system will move to the right to 
reach equilibrium. That is, K is greater than 1.

We can rearrange this equation to give
ln1K2 5 2DH¬∞
RT 1 DS¬∞
R
5 2DH¬∞
R
 a1
Tb 1 DS¬∞
R
Note that this is a linear equation of the form y 5 mx 1 b, where y 5 ln(K), m 5 2DH8y 
R 5 slope, x 5 1yT, and b 5DS8yR 5 intercept. This means that if values of K for a 
given reaction are determined at various temperatures, a plot of ln(K) versus 1yT will 
be linear, with slope 2DH8yR and intercept DS8yR. This result assumes that both DH8 
and DS8 are independent of temperature over the temperature range considered. This 
assumption is a good approximation over a relatively small temperature range.
17.10 Free Energy and Work
One of the main reasons we are interested in physical and chemical processes is 
that we want to use them to do work for us, and we want this work done as efficiently 
and economically as possible. We have already seen that at constant temperature and 
pressure, the sign of the change in free energy tells us whether a given process is spon-
taneous. This is very useful information because it prevents us from wasting effort on 
a process that has no inherent tendency to occur. Although a thermodynamically favor-
able chemical reaction may not occur to any appreciable extent because it is too slow, 
it makes sense in this case to try to find a catalyst to speed up the reaction. On the other 
hand, if the reaction is prevented from occurring by its thermodynamic characteristics, 
we would be wasting our time looking for a catalyst.
In addition to its qualitative usefulness (telling us whether a process is spontane-
ous), the change in free energy is important quantitatively because it can tell us how 
much work can be done with a given process. The maximum possible useful work 
obtainable from a process at constant temperature and pressure is equal to the 
change in free energy:
wmax 5 DG
This relationship explains why this function is called the free energy. Under certain 
conditions, DG for a spontaneous process represents the energy that is free to do useful 
work. On the other hand, for a process that is not spontaneous, the value of DG tells us 
the minimum amount of work that must be expended to make the process occur.
Knowing the value of DG for a process thus gives us valuable information about 
how close the process is to 100% efficiency. For example, when gasoline is burned in 
a car‚Äôs engine, the work produced is about 20% of the maximum work available.
For reasons we will only briefly introduce in this book, the amount of work we actu-
ally obtain from a spontaneous process is always less than the maximum possible 
amount.
To explore this idea more fully, let‚Äôs consider an electric current flowing through the 
starter motor of a car. The current is generated from a chemical change in a battery, and 
we can calculate DG for the battery reaction and so determine the energy available to do 
work. Can we use all this energy to do work? No, because a current flowing through a 
wire causes frictional heating, and the greater the current, the greater the heat. This heat 
represents wasted energy‚Äîit is not useful for running the starter motor. We can mini-
mize this energy waste by running very low currents through the motor circuit. How-
ever, zero current flow would be necessary to eliminate frictional heating entirely, and 
we cannot derive any work from the motor if no current flows. This represents the dif-
ficulty in which nature places us. Using a process to do work requires that some of the 
energy be wasted, and usually the faster we run the process, the more energy we waste.
Achieving the maximum work available from a spontaneous process can occur 
only via a hypothetical pathway. Any real pathway wastes energy. If we could 
discharge the battery infinitely slowly by an infinitesimal current flow, we would 
achieve the maximum useful work. Also, if we could then recharge the battery using 
17.10
wmax 5 DG
Note that ‚ÄúPV work‚Äù is not counted as 
useful work here.

an infinitesimally small current, exactly the same amount of energy would be used to 
return the battery to its original state. After we cycle the battery in this way, the uni-
verse (the system and surroundings) is exactly the same as it was before the cyclic 
process. This is a reversible process (Fig. 17.11).
However, if the battery is discharged to run the starter motor and then recharged 
using a finite current flow, as is the case in reality, more work will always be required 
to recharge the battery than the battery produces as it discharges. This means that even 
though the battery (the system) has returned to its original state, the surroundings have 
not, because the surroundings had to furnish a net amount of work as the battery was 
cycled. The universe is different after this cyclic process is performed, and this func-
tion is called an irreversible process. All real processes are irreversible.
In general, after any real cyclic process is carried out in a system, the surroundings 
have less ability to do work and contain more thermal energy. In any real cyclic pro-
cess in the system, work is changed to heat in the surroundings, and the entropy 
of the universe increases. This is another way of stating the second law of 
thermodynamics.
Thus thermodynamics tells us the work potential of a process and then tells us that 
we can never achieve this potential. In this spirit, thermodynamicist Henry Bent has 
paraphrased the first two laws of thermodynamics as follows:
First law: You can‚Äôt win, you can only break even.
Second law: You can‚Äôt break even.
The ideas we have discussed in this section are applicable to the energy crisis that will 
probably increase in severity over the next 25 years. The crisis is obviously not one of 
supply; the first law tells us that the universe contains a constant supply of energy. The 
problem is the availability of useful energy. As we use energy, we degrade its useful-
ness. For example, when gasoline reacts with oxygen in the combustion reaction, the 
change in potential energy results in heat flow. Thus the energy concentrated in the 
bonds of the gasoline and oxygen molecules ends up spread over the surroundings as 
thermal energy, where it is much more difficult to harness for useful work. This is a way 
in which the  entropy of the universe increases: Concentrated energy becomes spread 
out‚Äîmore disordered and less useful. Thus the crux of the energy problem is that we are 
rapidly consuming the concentrated energy found in fossil fuels. It took millions of years 
to concentrate the sun‚Äôs energy in these fuels, and we will consume these same fuels in 
a few hundred years. Thus we must use these energy sources as wisely as possible.
CRITICAL THINKING What if the first law of thermodynamics 
was true but the second law was not? How would the world be different?
When energy is used to do work, 
it  becomes less organized and less 
concentrated and thus less useful.

FIGURE 17.11 A battery can do 
work by sending current to a starter 
motor. The battery can then be recharged 
by forcing current through it in the oppo-
site direction. If the current flow in both 
processes is infinitesimally small, w1 5 w2. 
This is a reversible process. But if the 
current flow is finite, as it would be in any 
real case, w2 . w1. This is an irreversible 
process (the universe is different after 
the cyclic process occurs). All real 
processes are irreversible.

tion? How would you use Hess‚Äôs law to calculate DS8 
for a reaction? What does the superscript 8 indicate?
 
Predicting the sign of DS8 for a reaction is an impor-
tant skill to master. For a gas-phase reaction, what do 
you concentrate on to predict the sign of DS8? For a 
phase change, what do you concentrate on to predict the 
sign of DS8? That is, how are S8solid, S8liquid, and S8gas

late DG8rxn? How can you use DH8 and DS8 values to 
calculate DG8rxn? Of the functions DH8, DS8, and DG8, 
which depends most strongly on temperature? When 
DG8 is calculated at temperatures other than 258C, what 
assumptions are generally made concerning DH8 and 
DS8?
 7. If you calculate a value for DG8 for a reaction using the 
values of DG8f in Appendix 4 and get a negative number, 
is it correct to say that the reaction is always spontane-
ous? Why or why not? Free energy changes also depend 
on concentration. For gases, how is G related to the 
pressure of the gas? What are standard pressures for 
gases and standard concentrations for solutes? How do 
you calculate DG for a reaction at nonstandard condi-
tions? The equation to determine DG at nonstandard 
conditions has Q in it: What is Q? A reaction is sponta-
neous as long as DG is negative; that is, reactions 
always proceed as long as the products have a lower 
free energy than the reactants. What is so special about 
equilibrium? Why don‚Äôt reactions move away from 
equilibrium?

 11. The synthesis of glucose directly from CO2 and H2O and the 
synthesis of proteins directly from amino acids are both non-
spontaneous processes under standard conditions. Yet it is 
necessary for these to occur for life to exist. In light of the 
second law of thermodynamics, how can life exist?
 12. When the environment is contaminated by a toxic or poten-
tially toxic substance (for example, from a chemical spill or 
the use of insecticides), the substance tends to disperse. How

needed to code for all the substances produced in the body. Like-
wise, the digital data sent from Voyager II contained one redun-
dant bit out of every two bits of information. The Hubble space

E
lectrochemistry constitutes one of the most important interfaces between chemis-
try and everyday life. Every time you start your car, turn on your calculator, use 
your smartphone, or listen to a radio at the beach, you are depending on electrochemical 
reactions. Our society sometimes seems to run almost entirely on batteries. Certainly the 
advent of small, dependable batteries along with silicon-chip technology has made pos-
sible the tiny calculators, portable audio players, and cell phones that we take for granted.
Electrochemistry is important in other less obvious ways. For example, the corro-
sion of iron, which has tremendous economic implications, is an electrochemical pro-
cess. In addition, many important industrial materials such as aluminum, chlorine, and 
sodium hydroxide are prepared by electrolytic processes. In analytical chemistry, elec-
trochemical techniques use electrodes that are specific for a given molecule or ion, 
such as H1 (pH meters), F2, Cl2, and many others. These increasingly important meth-
ods are used to analyze for trace pollutants in natural waters or for the tiny quantities 
of chemicals in human blood that may signal the development of a specific disease.
Electrochemistry is best defined as the study of the interchange of chemical and 
 electrical energy. It is primarily concerned with two processes that involve oxidation‚Äì 
reduction reactions: the generation of an electric current from a spontaneous chemical 
 reaction and, the opposite process, the use of a current to produce chemical change.
18.1 Galvanic Cells
To understand how a redox reaction can be used to generate a current, let‚Äôs consider 
the reaction between MnO42 and Fe21:
8H11aq2 1 MnO4
 21aq2 1 5Fe211aq2 h Mn211aq2 1 5Fe311aq2 1 4H2O1 l 2
In this reaction, Fe21 is oxidized and MnO42 is reduced; electrons are transferred from 
Fe21 (the reducing agent) to MnO42 (the oxidizing agent).
 
It is useful to break a redox reaction into half-reactions, one involving oxidation 
and one involving reduction. For the previous reaction, the half-reactions are
Reduction:¬†¬† 8H1 1 MnO4
 2 1 5e2 h Mn21 1 4H2O
Oxidation:¬†¬† 51Fe21 h Fe31 1 e22
The multiplication of the second half-reaction by 5 indicates that this reaction must 
occur five times for each time the first reaction occurs. The balanced overall reaction 
is the sum of the half-reactions.
When MnO42 and Fe21 are present in the same solution, the electrons are trans-
ferred directly when the reactants collide. Under these conditions, no useful work is 
obtained from the chemical energy involved in the reaction, which instead is released 
as heat. How can we harness this energy? The key is to separate the oxidizing agent 
from the reducing agent, thus requiring the electron transfer to occur through a wire. 
The current produced in the wire by the electron flow can then be directed through a 
device, such as an electric motor, to provide useful work.
 
For example, consider the system illustrated in Fig. 18.1. If our reasoning has been 
correct, electrons should flow through the wire from Fe21 to MnO42. However, when 
we construct the apparatus as shown, no flow of electrons is apparent. Why? Careful 
observation shows that when we connect the wires from the two compartments, cur-
rent flows for an instant and then ceases. The current stops flowing because of charge 
buildups in the two compartments. If electrons flowed from the right to the left com-
partment in the apparatus as shown, the left compartment (receiving electrons) would 
become negatively charged, and the right compartment (losing electrons) would 
become positively charged. Creating a charge separation of this type requires a large 
amount of energy. Thus sustained electron flow cannot occur under these conditions.
 
However, we can solve this problem very simply. The solutions must be connected 
so that ions can flow to keep the net charge in each compartment zero. This connection 
18.1

might involve a salt bridge (a U-tube filled with an electrolyte) or a porous disk in a 
tube connecting the two solutions (Fig. 18.2). Either of these devices allows ions to 
flow without extensive mixing of the solutions. When we make the provision for ion 
flow, the circuit is complete. Electrons flow through the wire from reducing agent to 
oxidizing agent, and ions flow from one compartment to the other to keep the net 
charge zero.
 
We now have covered all the essential characteristics of a galvanic cell, a device in 
which chemical energy is changed to electrical energy. (The opposite process is called 
electrolysis and will be considered in Section 18.7.)
 
The reaction in an electrochemical cell occurs at the interface between the electrode 
and the solution where the electron transfer occurs. The electrode compartment in 
which oxidation occurs is called the anode; the electrode compartment in which 
reduction occurs is called the cathode (Fig. 18.3).
Cell Potential
A galvanic cell consists of an oxidizing agent in one compartment that pulls electrons 
through a wire from a reducing agent in the other compartment. The ‚Äúpull,‚Äù or driving 
force, on the electrons is called the cell potential (%cell), or the electromotive force 
(emf) of the cell. The unit of electrical potential is the volt (abbreviated V), which is 
defined as 1 joule of work per coulomb of charge transferred.
A galvanic cell uses a spontaneous redox 
reaction to produce a current that can be 
used to do work.
Oxidation occurs at the anode. Reduction 
occurs at the cathode.

How can we measure the cell potential? One possible instrument is a crude voltme-
ter, which works by drawing current through a known resistance. However, when 
current flows through a wire, the frictional heating that occurs wastes some of the 
potentially useful energy of the cell. A traditional voltmeter will therefore measure a 
potential that is less than the maximum cell potential. The key to determining the 
maximum potential is to do the measurement under conditions of zero current so that 
no energy is wasted. Traditionally, this has been accomplished by inserting a variable-
voltage device (powered from an external source) in opposition to the cell potential. 
The voltage on this instrument (called a potentiometer) is adjusted until no current 
flows in the cell circuit. Under such conditions, the cell potential is equal in magnitude 
and opposite in sign to the voltage setting of the potentiometer. This value represents 
the maximum cell potential, since no energy is wasted heating the wire. More recently, 
advances in electronic technology have allowed the design of digital voltmeters that 
draw only a negligible amount of current (Fig. 18.4). Since these instruments are more 
convenient to use, they have replaced potentiometers in the modern laboratory.
18.2 Standard Reduction Potentials
The reaction in a galvanic cell is always an oxidation‚Äìreduction reaction that can be 
broken down into two half-reactions. It would be convenient to assign a potential to 
each half-reaction so that when we construct a cell from a given pair of half-reactions 
we can obtain the cell potential by summing the half-cell potentials. For example, the 
observed potential for the cell shown in Fig. 18.5(a) is 0.76 V, and the cell reaction* is
2H11aq2 1 Zn1s2 h Zn211aq2 1 H21 g2
A volt is 1 joule of work per coulomb of 
charge transferred: 1 V 5 1 J/C.
18.2
The name galvanic cell honors Luigi  Galvani 
(1737‚Äì1798), an Italian scientist generally 
credited with the discovery of electricity. 
These cells are sometimes called voltaic cells 
after Alessandro Volta (1745‚Äì1827), another 
Italian, who first constructed cells of this 
type around 1800.
*In this text we will follow the convention of indicating the physical states of the reactants and 
products only in the overall redox reaction. For simplicity, half-reactions will not include the physi-
cal states.

For this cell, the anode compartment contains a zinc metal electrode with Zn21 and 
SO422 ions in aqueous solution. The anode reaction is the oxidation half-reaction:
Zn h Zn21 1 2e2
The zinc metal, in producing Zn21 ions that go into solution, is giving up electrons, 
which flow through the wire. For now, we will assume that all cell components are in 
their standard states, so in this case the solution in the anode compartment will contain 
1 M Zn21. The cathode reaction of this cell is the reduction half-reaction:
2H1 1 2e2 h H2
The cathode consists of a platinum electrode (used because it is a chemically inert 
conductor) in contact with 1 M H1 ions and bathed by hydrogen gas at 1 atm. Such an 
electrode, called the standard hydrogen electrode, is shown in Fig. 18.5(b).
 
Although we can measure the total potential of this cell (0.76 V), there is no way  to 
measure the potentials of the individual electrode processes. Thus, if we want po tentials 
for the half-reactions (half-cells), we must arbitrarily divide the total cell potential. For 
example, if we assign the reaction
2H1 1 2e2 h H2
where 
3H14 5 1 M¬†¬†and¬†¬†PH2 5 1 atm
a potential of exactly zero volts, then the reaction
Zn h Zn21 1 2e2
will have a potential of 0.76 V because

The scientific community has universally accepted the half-reaction potentials 
based on the assignment of 0 V to the process 2H1 1 2e2 S H2 (under standard 
 conditions where ideal behavior is assumed). However, before we can use these values 
to  calculate cell potentials, we need to understand several essential characteristics of 
half-cell potentials.
 
The accepted convention is to give the potentials of half-reactions as reduction 
processes. For example:
 2H1 1 2e2 h H2
 Cu21 1 2e2 h Cu
 Zn21 1 2e2 h Zn
The %8 values corresponding to reduction half-reactions with all solutes at 1 M and all 
gases at 1 atm are called standard reduction potentials. Standard reduction poten-
tials for the most common half-reactions are given in Table 18.1 and Appendix 5.5.
The standard hydrogen potential is the 
reference potential against which all  
half-reaction potentials are assigned.
All half-reactions are given as reduction 
processes in standard tables.

Combining two half-reactions to obtain a balanced oxidation‚Äìreduction reaction 
 often requires two manipulations:
1. One of the reduction half-reactions must be reversed (since redox reactions must 
involve a substance being oxidized and a substance being reduced). The half- 
reaction with the largest positive potential will run as written (as a reduction), 
and the other half-reaction will be forced to run in reverse (will be the oxidation 
reaction). The net potential of the cell will be the difference between the two. 
Since the reduction process occurs at the cathode and the oxidation process 
occurs at the anode, we can write
%¬∞cell 5 %¬∞ 1cathode2 2 %¬∞ 1anode2
Because subtraction means ‚Äúchange the sign and add,‚Äù in the examples done here 
we will change the sign of the oxidation (anode) reaction when we reverse it and 
add it to the reduction (cathode) reaction.
2. Since the number of electrons lost must equal the number gained, the half- 
reactions must be multiplied by integers as necessary to achieve the balanced 
equation. However, the value of %8 is not changed when a half-reaction is multi-
plied by an integer. Since a standard reduction potential is an intensive property 
(it does not depend on how many times the reaction occurs), the potential is not 
multiplied by the integer  required to balance the cell reaction.
Consider a galvanic cell based on the redox reaction
Fe311aq2 1 Cu1s2 h Cu211aq2 1 Fe211aq2
The pertinent half-reactions are
 
Fe31 1 e2 h Fe21¬†¬†¬†¬† %¬∞ 5 0.77 V 
(1)
 
Cu21 1 2e2 h Cu¬†¬†¬†¬†  %¬∞ 5 0.34 V 
(2)
To balance the cell reaction and calculate the standard cell potential, reaction (2) must 
be reversed:
Cu h Cu21 1 2e2¬†¬†¬†¬†2%¬∞ 5 20.34 V
 
Note the change in sign for the %8 value. Now, since each Cu atom produces two 
electrons but each Fe31 ion accepts only one electron, reaction (1) must be multiplied 
by 2:
2Fe31 1 2e2 h 2Fe21¬†¬†¬†¬†%¬∞ 5 0.77 V
Note that %8 is not changed in this case.
 
Now we can obtain the balanced cell reaction by summing the appropriately mod-
ified half-reactions:
 2Fe31 1 2e2 h 2Fe21¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†
 % 1cathode2 5 20.77 V
 Cu h Cu21 1 2e2¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†
 2% 1anode2 5 20.34 V
 Cell r eaction:¬†¬†Cu1s2 1 2Fe311aq2 h Cu211aq2 1 2Fe211aq2¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† %¬∞cell 5 %¬∞ 1cathode2 2 %¬∞ 1anode2
  
 5 0.77 V 2 0.34 V 5 0.43 V
CRITICAL THINKING What if you want to ‚Äúplate out‚Äù copper 
metal from an aqueous Cu21 solution? Use Table 18.1 to determine several metals 
you can place in the solution to plate copper metal from the solution. Defend 
your choices. Why can Zn not be plated out from an aqueous solution of Zn21 
using the choices in Table 18.1?
When a half-reaction is reversed, the sign 
of %8 is reversed.
When a half-reaction is multiplied by an 
integer, %8 remains the same.

Line Notation
We now will introduce a handy line notation used to describe electrochemical cells. In 
this notation the anode components are listed on the left and the cathode components 
are listed on the right, separated by double vertical lines (indicating the salt bridge or 
porous disk). For example, the line notation for the cell described in Example 18.1(a) is
Mg1s2 0 Mg211aq2 0 0 Al311aq2 0 Al1s2
In this notation a phase difference (boundary) is indicated by a single vertical line. 
Thus, in this case, vertical lines occur between the solid Mg metal and the Mg21 in

aqueous solution and between solid Al and Al31 in aqueous solution. Also note that the 
substance constituting the anode is listed at the far left and the substance constituting 
the cathode is listed at the far right.
 
For the cell described in Example 18.1(b), all the components involved in the 
 oxidation‚Äìreduction reaction are ions. Since none of these dissolved ions can serve as 
an electrode, a nonreacting (inert) conductor must be used. The usual choice is plati-
num. Thus, for the cell described in Example 18.1(b), the line notation is
Pt1s2 0 ClO3
21aq2, ClO4
21aq2, H11aq2 0 0 H11aq2, MnO4
21aq2, Mn211aq2 0 Pt1s2
Complete Description of a Galvanic Cell
Next we want to consider how to describe a galvanic cell fully, given just its half- 
reactions. This description will include the cell reaction, the cell potential, and the 
physical setup of the cell. Let‚Äôs consider a galvanic cell based on the following 
half-reactions:
 Fe21 1 2e2 h Fe¬†¬†¬†¬†
 %¬∞ 5 20.44 V
 MnO4
 2 1 5e2 1 8H1 h Mn21 1 4H2O¬†¬†¬†¬† %¬∞ 5
1.51 V
In a working galvanic cell, one of these reactions must run in reverse. Which one?
 
We can answer this question by considering the sign of the potential of a working 
cell: A cell will always run spontaneously in the direction that produces a positive cell 
potential. Thus, in the present case, it is clear that the half-reaction involving iron must 
be reversed, since this choice leads to a positive cell potential:
 Fe h Fe21 1 2e2¬†¬†
 2%¬∞ 5 0.44 V  Anode reaction
 MnO4
 2 1 5e2 1 8H1 h Mn21 1 4H2O¬†¬†¬†¬† %¬∞ 5 1.51 V  Cathode reaction
where 
%¬∞cell 5 %¬∞ 1cathode2 2 %¬∞ 1anode2 5 1.51 V 1 0.44 V 5 1.95 V
The balanced cell reaction is obtained as follows:
 51Fe h Fe21 1 2e22
 21MnO4
 2 1 5e2 1 8H1 h Mn21 1 4H2O2
 2MnO4
 21aq2 1 5Fe1s2 1 16H11aq2 h 5Fe211aq2 1 2Mn211aq2 1 8H2O1 l 2
 
Now consider the physical setup of the cell, shown schematically in Fig. 18.7. In 
the left compartment the active components in their standard states are pure metallic 
iron (Fe) and 1.0 M Fe21. The anion present depends on the iron salt used. In this com-
partment the anion does not participate in the reaction but simply balances the charge. 
The half- reaction that takes place at this electrode is
Fe h Fe21 1 2e2
which is an oxidation reaction, so this compartment is the anode. The electrode con-
sists of pure iron metal.
 
In the right compartment the active components in their standard states are 1.0 M 
MnO42, 1.0 M H1, and 1.0 M Mn21, with appropriate unreacting ions (often called 
counterions) to balance the charge. The half-reaction in this compartment is
MnO4
 2 1 5e2 1 8H1 h Mn21 1 4H2O
which is a reduction reaction, so this compartment is the cathode. Since neither MnO42 
nor Mn21 ions can serve as the electrode, a nonreacting conductor such as platinum 
must be used.
 
The next step is to determine the direction of electron flow. In the left compartment 
the half-reaction involves the oxidation of iron:
Fe h Fe21 1 2e2
A galvanic cell runs spontaneously in the 
direction that gives a positive value for 
%cell.

In the right compartment the half-reaction is the reduction of MnO42:
MnO4

Thus the electrons flow from Fe to MnO42 in this cell, or from the anode to the cath-
ode, as is always the case. The line notation for this cell is

 21aq2, Mn211aq2 0 Pt1s2
LET‚ÄôS REVIEW  Description of a Galvanic Cell
A complete description of a galvanic cell usually includes four items:
 ¬ª The cell potential (always positive for a galvanic cell where  
%8cell 5 %8 (cathode) 2 %8 (anode)) and the balanced cell reaction.
 ¬ª The direction of electron flow, obtained by inspecting the half-reactions and using the 
direction that gives a positive %cell.
 ¬ª Designation of the anode and cathode.
 ¬ª The nature of each electrode and the ions present in each compartment. A chemically 
inert conductor is required if none of the substances participating in the half-reaction is a 
conducting solid.

‚ñ† Since Ag1 receives electrons and Fe21 loses electrons in the cell reaction, the 
electrons will flow from the compartment containing Fe21 to the compartment 
 containing Ag1.
‚ñ† Oxidation occurs in the compartment containing Fe21 (electrons flow from 
Fe21 to Ag1). Hence this compartment functions as the anode. Reduction 
occurs in the  compartment containing Ag1, so this compartment functions as 
the cathode.
‚ñ† The electrode in the AgyAg1 compartment is silver metal, and an inert conduc-
tor, such as platinum, must be used in the Fe21yFe31 compartment. Appropriate 
counterions are assumed to be present. The diagram for this cell is shown in 
Fig. 18.8. The line notation for this cell is

18.3 Cell Potential, Electrical Work, 
and Free Energy
So far we have considered electrochemical cells in a very practical fashion without 
much theoretical background. The next step will be to explore the relationship between 
thermodynamics and electrochemistry.
The work that can be accomplished when electrons are transferred through a wire 
depends on the ‚Äúpush‚Äù (the thermodynamic driving force) behind the electrons. This 
driving force (the emf) is defined in terms of a potential difference (in volts) between 
two points in the circuit. Recall that a volt represents a joule of work per coulomb of 
charge transferred:
emf 5 potential difference 1V2 5 work 1J2
charge 1C2
Thus 1 joule of work is produced or required (depending on the direction) when 
1 coulomb of charge is transferred between two points in the circuit that differ by a 
potential of 1 volt.
In this book, work is viewed from the point of view of the system. Thus work flowing 
out of the system is indicated by a minus sign. When a cell produces a current, the cell 
potential is positive, and the current can be used to do work‚Äîto run a motor, for 
instance. Thus the cell potential % and the work w have opposite signs:
% 5 2w
q
Therefore, 
2w 5 q%
 
From this equation it can be seen that the maximum work in a cell would be obtained 
at the maximum cell potential:
2wmax 5 q%max¬†¬†or¬†¬†wmax 5 2q%max
However, there is a problem. To obtain electrical work, current must flow. When 
current flows, some energy is inevitably wasted through frictional heating, and the 
maximum work is not obtained. This reflects the important general principle intro-
duced in Section 17.10: In any real, spontaneous process some energy is always 
wasted‚Äîthe actual work realized is always less than the calculated maximum. 
This is a consequence of the fact that the entropy of the universe must increase in any 
spontaneous process. Recall from Section 17.10 that the only process from which 
maximum work could be realized is the hypothetical reversible process. For a galvanic 
cell this would involve an infinitesimally small current flow and thus an infinite amount 
of time to do the work. Even though we can never achieve the maximum work through 
the actual discharge of a galvanic cell, we can measure the maximum potential. There 
is negligible current flow when a cell potential is measured with a  potentiometer or an 
efficient digital voltmeter. No current flow implies no waste of energy, so the potential 
measured is the maximum.
Although we can never actually realize the maximum work from a cell reaction, 
the value for it is still useful in evaluating the efficiency of a real process based on 
the cell reaction. For example, suppose a certain galvanic cell has a maximum poten-
tial (at zero current) of 2.50 V. In a particular experiment 1.33 moles of electrons 
were passed through this cell at an average actual potential of 2.10 V. The actual 
work done is

where % represents the actual potential difference at which the current flowed (2.10 V 
or 2.10 J/C) and q is the quantity of charge in coulombs transferred. The charge on  
1 mole of electrons is a constant called the faraday (abbreviated F), which has the 
value 96,485 coulombs of charge per mole of electrons. Thus q equals the number of 
moles of electrons times the charge per mole of electrons:
q 5 nF 5 1.33 mol e2 3 96,485 C/mol e2
Then, for the preceding experiment, the actual work is
 w 5 2q% 5 211.33 mol e2 3 96,485 C/mol e22 12.10 J/C2
 5 22.69 3 105 J

mum potential is used:

23.21 3 105 J 3 100% 5 83.8%
 
Next we want to relate the potential of a galvanic cell to free energy. In Section 
17.10 we saw that for a process carried out at constant temperature and pressure,  
the change in free energy equals the maximum useful work obtainable from that 
process:
wmax 5 DG
For a galvanic cell,
wmax 5 2q%max 5 DG
Since 
q 5 nF
we have 
DG 5 2q%max 5 2nF%max
From now on the subscript on %max will be deleted, with the understanding that any 
potential given in this book is the maximum potential. Thus
DG 5 2nF%
For standard conditions,
DG¬∞ 5 2nF%¬∞
This equation states that the maximum cell potential is directly related to the free 
 energy difference between the reactants and the products in the cell. This relation-
ship is important because it provides an experimental means to obtain DG for a reac-
tion. It also confirms that a galvanic cell will run in the direction that gives a positive 
value for %cell; a positive %cell value corresponds to a negative DG value, which is the 
condition for spontaneity.

Calculating DG8 for a Cell Reaction
Using the data in Table 18.1, calculate DG8 for the reaction

Is this reaction spontaneous?

We can calculate DG8 from the equation

required per mole of reactants and products. Thus n 5 2 mol e2, F 5 96,485 C/mol e2,

The sum of these half-reactions gives the required reaction:

That is, gold will not dissolve in 1 M HNO3 to give 1 M Au31. In fact, a mixture 
(1;3 by volume) of concentrated nitric and hydrochloric acids, called aqua regia, is 
required to dissolve gold.

18.4 Dependence of Cell Potential 
on Concentration
So far we have described cells under standard conditions. In this section we consider 
the dependence of the cell potential on concentration. Under standard conditions (all 
concentrations 1 M), the cell with the reaction
Cu1s2 1 2Ce411aq2 h Cu211aq2 1 2Ce311aq2
has a potential of 1.36 V. What will the cell potential be if [Ce41] is greater than 1.0 M? 
An  increase in the concentration of Ce41 will favor the forward reaction and thus 
increase the driving force on the electrons. The cell potential will increase. On the 
other hand, an increase in the concentration of a product (Cu21 or Ce31) will oppose 
the forward reaction, thus decreasing the cell potential.
 
These ideas are illustrated in Example 18.5.
The Effects of Concentration on %
For the cell reaction
2Al1s2 1 3Mn211aq2 h 2Al311aq2 1 3Mn1s2¬†¬†¬†¬†%¬∞cell 5 0.48 V
predict whether %cell is larger or smaller than %8cell for the following cases.
a. [Al31] 5 2.0 M, [Mn21] 5 1.0 M
b. [Al31] 5 1.0 M, [Mn21] 5 3.0 M
 
SOLUTION 
a. A product concentration has been raised above 1.0 M. This will oppose the cell 
 reaction and will cause %cell to be less than %8cell (%cell , 0.48 V).
b. A reactant concentration has been increased above 1.0 M, and %cell will be greater 
than %8cell (%cell . 0.48 V).
See Exercise 18.65
Concentration Cells
Because cell potentials depend on concentration, we can construct galvanic cells 
where both compartments contain the same components but at different concentra-
tions. For example, in the cell in Fig. 18.9, both compartments contain aqueous 
AgNO3, but with different molarities. Let‚Äôs consider the potential of this cell and 
the direction of electron flow. The half-reaction relevant to both compartments of 
this cell is
Ag1 1 e2 h Ag¬†¬†¬†¬†%¬∞ 5 0.80 V
If the cell had 1 M Ag1 in both compartments,
%¬∞cell 5 0.80 V 2 0.80 V 5 0 V
However, in the cell described here, the concentrations of Ag1 in the two compart-
ments are 1 M and 0.1 M. Because the concentrations of Ag1 are unequal, the half-cell 
potentials will not be identical, and the cell will exhibit a positive voltage. In which 
direction will the electrons flow in this cell? The best way to think about this question 
is to recognize that nature will try to equalize the concentrations of Ag1 in the two 
compartments. This can be done by transferring electrons from the compartment con-
taining 0.1 M Ag1 to the one containing 1 M Ag1 (left to right in Fig. 18.9). This

electron transfer will produce more Ag1 in the left compartment and consume Ag1 (to 
form Ag) in the right compartment.
 
A cell in which both compartments have the same components but at different con-
centrations is called a concentration cell. The difference in concentration is the only 
factor that produces a cell potential in this case, and the voltages are typically small.
Concentration Cells
Determine the direction of electron flow, and designate the anode and cathode for the 
cell represented in Fig. 18.10.
SOLUTION
The concentrations of Fe21 ion in the two compartments can (eventually) be equalized 
by transferring electrons from the left compartment to the right. This will cause Fe21
to be formed in the left compartment, and iron metal will be deposited (by reducing 
Fe21 ions to Fe) on the right electrode. Since electron flow is from left to right, oxida-
tion occurs in the left compartment (the anode) and reduction occurs in the right (the 
cathode).
See Exercise 18.66
The Nernst Equation
The dependence of the cell potential on concentration results directly from the depen-
dence of free energy on concentration. Recall from Chapter 17 that the equation
DG 5 DG¬∞ 1 RT ln1Q2
where Q is the reaction quotient, was used to calculate the effect of concentration on 
DG. Since DG 5 2nF% and DG8 5 2nF%8, the equation becomes
2nF% 5 2nF%¬∞ 1 RT ln1Q2
Dividing each side of the equation by 2nF gives
% 5 %¬∞ 2 RT
nF ln1Q2  
(18.1)
Equation (18.1), which gives the relationship between the cell potential and the con-
centrations of the cell components, is commonly called the Nernst equation, after the 
German chemist Walther Hermann Nernst (1864‚Äì1941).

the third law of thermodynamics. He won 
the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1920.

silver electrode dissolves (producing Ag1 ions) to raise 
the concentration of Ag1 in solution.

The Nernst equation is often given in a form that is valid at 258C:
% 5 %¬∞ 2 0.0591
n
 log1Q2
Using this relationship, we can calculate the potential of a cell in which some or all of 
the components are not in their standard states.
 
For example, %8cell is 0.48 V for the galvanic cell based on the reaction
2Al1s2 1 3Mn211aq2 h 2Al311aq2 1 3Mn1s2
Consider a cell in which
3Mn214 5 0.50 M¬†¬†and¬†¬†3Al314 5 1.50 M
The cell potential at 258C for these concentrations can be calculated using the Nernst 
equation:
%cell 5 %¬∞cell 2 0.0591
n

We know that
%¬∞cell 5 0.48 V
and 
Q 5 3Al3142
3Mn2143 5 11.502 2

Since the half-reactions are
Oxidation:¬†¬†¬†¬† 2Al h 2Al31 1 6e2
Reduction:¬†¬†¬†¬† 3Mn21 1 6e2 h 3Mn
we know that
n 5 6
Thus 
 %cell 5 0.48 2 0.0591
6
 log1182
 5 0.48 2 0.0591
6
 11.262 5 0.48 2 0.01 5 0.47 V
Note that the cell voltage decreases slightly because of the nonstandard concentra-
tions.  In this case, since the reactant concentration is lower than 1.0 M and the product 
concentration is higher than 1.0 M, %cell is less than %8cell.
 
The potential calculated from the Nernst equation is the maximum potential before 
any current flow has occurred. As the cell discharges and current flows from anode to 
cathode, the concentrations will change, and as a result, %cell will change. In fact, the 
cell will spontaneously discharge until it reaches equilibrium, at which point
Q 5 K 1the equilibrium constant2¬†¬†and¬†¬†%cell 5 0
 
A ‚Äúdead‚Äù battery is one in which the cell reaction has reached equilibrium, and 
there is no longer any chemical driving force to push electrons through the wire. In 
other words, at equilibrium, the components in the two cell compartments have the 
same free energy, and DG 5 0 for the cell reaction at the equilibrium concentrations. 
The cell no longer has the ability to do work.

electrolytic cell? Does this mean the cell is ‚Äúdead‚Äù? What if % 5 0? Explain your 
answer in each case.

Ion-Selective Electrodes
Because the cell potential is sensitive to the concentrations of the reactants and prod-
ucts involved in the cell reaction, measured potentials can be used to determine the 
concentration of an ion. A pH meter (see Fig. 14.7) is a familiar example of an instru-
ment that  measures concentration using an observed potential. The pH meter has three 
main components: a standard electrode of known potential, a special glass electrode 
that changes potential depending on the concentration of H1 ions in the solution into 
which it is dipped, and a potentiometer that measures the potential between the elec-
trodes. The potentiometer reading is automatically converted electronically to a direct 
reading of the pH of the solution being tested.
 
The glass electrode (Fig. 18.12) contains a reference solution of dilute hydrochloric 
acid in contact with a thin glass membrane. The electrical potential of the glass elec-
trode depends on the difference in [H1] between the reference solution and the solu-
tion into which the electrode is dipped. Thus the electrical potential varies with the pH 
of the solution being tested.
 
Electrodes that are sensitive to the concentration of a particular ion are called ion- 
selective electrodes, of which the glass electrode for pH measurement is just one 
example. Glass electrodes can be made sensitive to such ions as Na1, K1, or NH41 by 
changing the composition of the glass. Other ions can be detected if an appropriate 
crystal replaces the glass membrane. For example, a crystal of lanthanum(III) fluoride 
(LaF3) can be used in an electrode to measure [F2]. Solid silver sulfide (Ag2S) can 
be used to measure [Ag1] and [S22]. Some of the ions that can be detected by ion- 
selective electrodes are listed in Table 18.2.

solutions.

18.5 Batteries
A battery is a galvanic cell or, more commonly, a group of galvanic cells connected in 
series, where the potentials of the individual cells add to give the total battery potential. 
Batteries are a source of direct current and have become an essential source of portable 
power in our society. In this section we examine the most common types of batteries. 
Some new batteries currently being developed are described at the end of the chapter.
Lead Storage Battery
Since about 1915 when self-starters were first used in automobiles, the lead storage 
battery has been a major factor in making the automobile a practical means of trans-
portation. This type of battery can function for several years under temperature 
extremes from 2308F to 1208F and under incessant punishment from rough roads.

The typical automobile lead storage battery has six cells connected in series. Each 
cell contains multiple electrodes in the form of grids (Fig. 18.13) and produces approx-
imately 2 V, to give a total battery potential of about 12 V. Note from the cell reaction 
that sulfuric acid is consumed as the battery discharges. This lowers the density of the 
electrolyte solution from its initial value of about 1.28 g/cm3 in the fully charged bat-
tery. As a result, the condition of the battery can be monitored by measuring the den-
sity of the sulfuric acid solution. The solid lead sulfate formed in the cell reaction 
during discharge adheres to the grid surfaces of the electrodes. The battery is recharged 
by forcing current through it in the opposite direction to reverse the cell reaction. A 
car‚Äôs battery is continuously charged by an alternator driven by the automobile engine.
 
An automobile with a dead battery can be ‚Äújump-started‚Äù by connecting its battery to 
the battery in a running automobile. This process can be dangerous, however, because 
the resulting flow of current causes electrolysis of water in the dead battery, producing 
hydrogen and oxygen gases (see Section 18.7 for details). Disconnecting the jumper 
cables after the disabled car starts causes an arc that can ignite the gaseous mixture. If 
this happens, the battery may explode, ejecting corrosive sulfuric acid. This problem can 
be avoided by connecting the ground jumper cable to a part of the engine remote from 
the battery. Any arc produced when this cable is disconnected will then be harmless.
 
Traditional types of storage batteries require periodic ‚Äútopping off‚Äù because the 
water in the electrolyte solution is depleted by the electrolysis that accompanies the 
charging process. Recent types of batteries have electrodes made of an alloy of cal-
cium and lead that inhibits the electrolysis of water. These batteries can be sealed, 
since they require no addition of water.
 
It is rather amazing that in the 100 years in which lead storage batteries have been 
used, no better system has been found. Although a lead storage battery does provide 
excellent service, it has a useful lifetime of 3 to 5 years in an automobile. While it 
might seem that the battery could undergo an indefinite number of discharge/charge 
cycles, physical damage from road shock and chemical side-reactions eventually cause 
the battery to fail.
Other Batteries
The calculators, electronic games, digital watches, and portable audio players that are 
so familiar to us are all powered by small, efficient batteries. The common dry cell 
battery was invented more than 100 years ago by Georges Leclanch√© (1839‚Äì1882), a 
French chemist. In its acid version, the dry cell battery contains a zinc inner case that 
acts as the anode and a carbon rod in contact with a moist paste of solid MnO2, solid 
NH4Cl, and carbon that acts as the cathode (Fig. 18.14). The half-reactions are com-
plex but can be approximated as follows:
Anode reaction:¬†¬†
 Zn h Zn21 1 2e2
Cathode reaction:¬†¬† 2NH4
 1 1 2MnO2 1 2e2 h Mn2O3 1 2NH3 1 H2O
This cell produces a potential of about 1.5 V.
 
In the alkaline version of the dry cell battery, the solid NH4Cl is replaced with KOH 
or NaOH. In this case the half-reactions can be approximated as follows:
Anode reaction:¬†¬†
 Zn 1 2OH2 h ZnO 1 H2O 1 2e2
Cathode reaction:¬†¬† 2MnO2 1 H2O 1 2e2 h Mn2O3 1 2OH2

The alkaline dry cell lasts longer mainly because the zinc anode corrodes less rapidly 
under basic conditions than under acidic conditions.
 
Other types of useful batteries include the silver cell, which has a Zn anode and a 
cathode that uses Ag2O as the oxidizing agent in a basic environment. Mercury cells, 
often used in calculators, have a Zn anode and a cathode involving HgO as the oxidiz-
ing agent in a basic medium (Fig. 18.15).
 
An especially important type of battery is the nickel‚Äìcadmium battery, in which the 
electrode reactions are
Anode reaction:¬†¬†
 Cd 1 2OH2 h Cd1OH2 2 1 2e2
Cathode reaction:¬†¬† NiO2 1 2H2O 1 2e2 h Ni1OH2 2 1 2OH2
As in the lead storage battery, the products adhere to the electrodes. Therefore, a nickel‚Äì 
cadmium battery can be recharged an indefinite number of times.
 
Lithium-ion batteries involve the migration of Li1 ions from the cathode to the 
anode, where they intercalate (enter the interior) as the battery is charged. At the same 
time, charge-balancing electrons travel to the anode through the external circuit in the 
charger. On discharge, the opposite process occurs. The cathode of the first successful 
lithium-ion batteries originally contained LiCoO2 and a lithium-intercalated carbon 
(LiC6) anode. More recently manufacturers have included transition metals such as 
nickel and manganese in the cathode in addition to cobalt. The mixed-metal cathodes 
have greater charge capacity and power output and shorter recharge times.
 
Lithium-ion batteries are used in a wide variety of applications, including cell 
phones, laptop computers, power tools, and even electric drive systems in automobiles 
and motorcycles.
Fuel Cells
A fuel cell is a galvanic cell for which the reactants are continuously supplied. To 
illustrate the principles of fuel cells, let‚Äôs consider the exothermic redox reaction of 
methane with oxygen:
CH41 g2 1 2O21 g2 h CO21 g2 1 2H2O1 g2 1 energy
Usually the energy from this reaction is released as heat to warm homes and to run 
machines. However, in a fuel cell designed to use this reaction, the energy is used to 
produce an electric current: The electrons flow from the reducing agent (CH4) to the 
oxidizing agent (O2) through a conductor.
 
The U.S. space program has supported extensive research to develop fuel cells. The 
space shuttle uses a fuel cell based on the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen to form 
water:
2H21 g2 1 O21 g2 h 2H2O1 l 2
A schematic of a fuel cell that uses this reaction is shown in Fig. 18.16. The half- 
reactions are

A cell of this type weighing about 500 pounds has been designed for space vehicles, 
but this fuel cell is not practical enough for general use as a source of portable power. 
However, current research on portable electrochemical power is now proceeding at a 
rapid pace. In fact, cars powered by fuel cells are now being tested on the streets.
Fuel cells are also finding use as permanent power sources. For example, a power 
plant built in New York City contains stacks of hydrogen‚Äìoxygen fuel cells, which can 
be rapidly put on-line in response to fluctuating power demands. The hydrogen gas is 
obtained by decomposing the methane in natural gas. A plant of this type also has been 
constructed in Tokyo.
In addition, new fuel cells are under development that can use fuels such as meth-
ane and diesel directly without having to produce hydrogen first.
T
he promise of an energy-efficient, 
environmentally sound source of 
electrical power has spurred an intense 
interest in fuel cells in recent years. 
Although fuel cells have long been 
used in the U.S. space program, no 
practical fuel cell for powering automo-
biles has been developed. However, we 
are now on the verge of practical fuel-
cell‚Äìpowered cars. The Toyota FCV, 
which is powered by a hydrogen‚Äì 
oxygen fuel cell, is now available in the 
United States. Toyota reports that this 
vehicle, which costs about $70,000, has 
a range of 400 miles on a single fill-up 
of hydrogen gas and emits only water 
vapor. The main advantages of fuel-cell 
driven cars are the much smaller size 
and lower weight of the fuel cell com-
pared to conventional battery packs 
and the shorter fill-up time of about  
3 minutes compared to the hours 
required for battery recharging. The 
main disadvantages of fuel-cell vehi-
cles are their relatively high cost and 
the lack of hydrogen refueling stations. 
To combat the latter issue, California 
has provided $50 million to fund about 
30 new hydrogen refueling stations.
Besides providing power for auto-
mobiles, fuel cells are being considered 
for powering small electronic devices 
such as cameras, cell phones, and 
laptop computers. Many of these micro 
fuel cells currently use methanol as the 
fuel  (reducing agent) rather than H2. 
However, these direct-methanol fuel 
cells are rife with problems. A major 
difficulty is water management. Water 
is needed at the anode to react with 
the methanol and is produced at the 
cathode. Water is also needed to 
moisten the electrolyte to promote 
charge migration.
Although the direct-methanol fuel 
cell is currently the leader among micro 
fuel-cell designs, its drawbacks have 
encouraged the development of other 
designs. For  example,  Richard Masel at 
the University of Illinois at  Urbana‚Äì
Champaign has designed a micro fuel 
cell that uses formic acid as the fuel. 
Masel and others are also experiment-
ing with mini hot chambers external to 
the fuel cell that break down hydrogen-
rich fuels into hydrogen gas, which is 
then fed into the tiny fuel cells.
To replace batteries, fuel cells must 
be demonstrated to be economically 
feasible, safe, and dependable. Today, 
rapid progress is being made to over-
come the current problems. A recent 
estimate indicates that by late in this 
decade annual sales of the little power 
plants may reach 200 million units per 
year. It appears that after years of hype 
about the virtues of fuel cells, we are 
finally going to realize their potential.

18.6 Corrosion
Corrosion can be viewed as the process of returning metals to their natural state‚Äîthe 
ores from which they were originally obtained. Corrosion involves oxidation of the 
metal. Since corroded metal often loses its structural integrity and attractiveness, this 
spontaneous process has great economic impact. Approximately one-fifth of the iron 
and steel produced annually is used to replace rusted metal.
Metals corrode because they oxidize easily. Table 18.1 shows that, with the excep-
tion of gold, those metals commonly used for structural and decorative purposes all 
have standard reduction potentials less positive than that of oxygen gas. When any of 
these half- reactions is reversed (to show oxidation of the metal) and combined with the 
reduction half-reaction for oxygen, the result is a positive %8 value. Thus the oxidation 
of most metals by oxygen is spontaneous (although we cannot tell from the potential 
how fast it will occur).
In view of the large difference in reduction potentials between oxygen and most 
metals, it is surprising that the problem of corrosion does not completely prevent the 
use of metals in air. However, most metals develop a thin oxide coating, which tends 
to protect their internal atoms against further oxidation. The metal that best demon-
strates this phenomenon is aluminum. With a reduction potential of 21.7 V, aluminum 
should be easily oxidized by O2. According to the apparent thermodynamics of the 
reaction, an aluminum airplane could dissolve in a rainstorm. The fact that this very 
active metal can be used as a structural material is due to the formation of a thin, adher-
ent layer of aluminum oxide (Al2O3), more properly represented as Al2(OH)6, which 
greatly inhibits further corrosion. The potential of the ‚Äúpassive,‚Äù oxide-coated alumi-
num is 20.6 V, a value that causes it to behave much like a noble metal.
 
Iron also can form a protective oxide coating. This coating is not an infallible shield 
against corrosion, however; when steel is exposed to oxygen in moist air, the oxide that 
forms tends to scale off and expose new metal surfaces to corrosion.
 
The corrosion products of noble metals such as copper and silver are complex and 
affect the use of these metals as decorative materials. Under normal atmospheric 
 conditions, copper forms an external layer of greenish copper carbonate called patina. 
Silver tarnish is silver sulfide (Ag2S), which in thin layers gives the silver surface a 
richer appearance. Gold, with a positive standard reduction potential of 1.50 V, signifi-
cantly larger than that for oxygen (1.23 V), shows no appreciable corrosion in air.
Corrosion of Iron
Since steel is the main structural material for bridges, buildings, and automobiles, 
controlling its corrosion is extremely important. To do this, we must understand the 
corrosion mechanism. Instead of being a direct oxidation process as we might expect, 
the corrosion of iron is an electrochemical reaction, as shown in Fig. 18.17.
Steel has a nonuniform surface because the chemical composition is not completely 
homogeneous. Also, physical strains leave stress points in the metal. These nonunifor-
mities cause areas where the iron is more easily oxidized (anodic regions) than it is at 
18.6
Some metals, such as copper, gold, silver, 
and platinum, are relatively difficult to 
oxidize. These are often called noble metals.

 others (cathodic regions). In the anodic regions each iron atom gives up two electrons 
to form the Fe21 ion:
Fe h Fe21 1 2e2
The electrons that are released flow through the steel, as they do through the wire of a 
galvanic cell, to a cathodic region, where they react with oxygen:
O2 1 2H2O 1 4e2 h 4OH2
The Fe21 ions formed in the anodic regions travel to the cathodic regions through the 
moisture on the surface of the steel, just as ions travel through a salt bridge in a gal-
vanic cell. In the cathodic regions Fe21 ions react with oxygen to form rust, which is 
hydrated iron(III) oxide of variable composition:
4Fe211aq2 1 O21 g2 1 14 1 2n2H2O1 l 2 h 2Fe2O3 # nH2O1s2 1 8H11aq2
 
Rust
 
Because of the migration of ions and electrons, rust often forms at sites that are 
remote from those where the iron dissolved to form pits in the steel. The degree of 
hydration of the iron oxide affects the color of the rust, which may vary from black to 
yellow to the familiar reddish brown.
 
The electrochemical nature of the rusting of iron explains the importance of mois-
ture in the corrosion process. Moisture must be present to act as a kind of salt bridge 
between anodic and cathodic regions. Steel does not rust in dry air, a fact that explains 
why cars last much longer in the arid Southwest than in the relatively humid Midwest. 
Salt also accelerates rusting, a fact all too easily recognized by car owners in the colder 
parts of the United States, where salt is used on roads to melt snow and ice. The sever-
ity of rusting is greatly increased because the dissolved salt on the moist steel surface 
increases the conductivity of the aqueous solution formed there and thus accelerates 
the electrochemical corrosion process. Chloride ions also form very stable complex 
ions with Fe31, and this factor tends to encourage the dissolving of the iron, again 
accelerating the corrosion.
Prevention of Corrosion
Prevention of corrosion is an important way of conserving our natural resources of 
energy and metals. The primary means of protection is the application of a coating, 
most commonly paint or metal plating, to protect the metal from oxygen and moisture. 
Chromium and tin are often used to plate steel (see Section 18.8) because they oxidize 
to form a durable, effective oxide coating. Zinc, also used to coat steel in a process 
called galvanizing, forms a mixed oxide‚Äìcarbonate coating. Since zinc is a more 
active metal than iron, as the potentials for the oxidation half-reactions show,
 Fe h Fe21 1 2e2¬†¬†¬†¬† 2%¬∞ 5 0.44 V
 Zn h Zn21 1 2e2¬†¬†¬†¬† 2%¬∞ 5 0.76 V
any oxidation that occurs dissolves zinc rather than iron. Recall that the reaction with 
the most positive standard potential has the greatest thermodynamic tendency to occur. 
Thus zinc acts as a ‚Äúsacrificial‚Äù coating on steel.
 
Alloying is also used to prevent corrosion. Stainless steel contains chromium and 
nickel, both of which form oxide coatings that change steel‚Äôs reduction potential to 
one characteristic of the noble metals. In addition, a new technology is now being 
developed to create surface alloys. That is, instead of forming a metal alloy such as 
stainless steel, which has the same composition throughout, a cheaper carbon steel 
is treated by ion bombardment to produce a thin layer of stainless steel or other 
desirable alloy on the surface. In this process, a ‚Äúplasma‚Äù or ‚Äúion gas‚Äù of the alloy-
ing ions is formed at high temperatures and is then directed onto the surface of the 
metal.
727

Cathodic protection is a method most often used to protect steel in buried fuel 
tanks and pipelines. An active metal, such as magnesium, is connected by a wire to the 
pipeline or tank to be protected (Fig. 18.18). Because the magnesium is a better reduc-
ing agent than iron, electrons are furnished by the magnesium rather than by the iron, 
keeping the iron from being oxidized. As oxidation occurs, the magnesium anode dis-
solves, and so it must be replaced periodically. Ships‚Äô hulls are protected in a similar 
way by attaching bars of titanium metal to the steel hull. In salt water the titanium acts 
as the anode and is oxidized instead of the steel hull (the cathode).
18.7 Electrolysis
A galvanic cell produces current when an oxidation‚Äìreduction reaction proceeds spon-
taneously. A similar apparatus, an electrolytic cell, uses electrical energy to produce 
chemical change. The process of electrolysis involves forcing a current through a cell 
to produce a chemical change for which the cell potential is negative; that is, electrical 
work causes an otherwise nonspontaneous chemical reaction to occur. Electrolysis has 
great practical importance; for example, charging a battery, producing aluminum 
metal, and chrome plating an object are all done electrolytically.
To illustrate the difference between a galvanic cell and an electrolytic cell, consider 
the cell shown in Fig. 18.19(a) as it runs spontaneously to produce 1.10 V. In this gal-
vanic cell, the reaction at the anode is
Zn h Zn21 1 2e2
whereas at the cathode the reaction is
Cu21 1 2e2 h Cu
Figure 18.19(b) shows an external power source forcing electrons through the cell 
in the opposite direction to that in (a). This requires an external potential greater than 
1.10 V, which must be applied in opposition to the natural cell potential. This device is 
an electrolytic cell. Notice that since electron flow is opposite in the two cases, the 
anode and cathode are reversed between (a) and (b). Also, ion flow through the salt 
bridge is opposite in the two cells.
Now we will consider the stoichiometry of electrolytic processes, that is, how much 
chemical change occurs with the flow of a given current for a specified time. Suppose 
we wish to determine the mass of copper that is plated out when a current of 10.0 amps 
(an ampere [amp], abbreviated A, is 1 coulomb of charge per second) is passed for 
30.0 minutes through a solution containing Cu21. Plating means depositing the neutral 
metal on the electrode by reducing the metal ions in solution. In this case each Cu21 
ion requires two electrons to become an atom of copper metal:
Cu211aq2 1 2e2 h Cu1s2
This reduction process will occur at the cathode of the electrolytic cell.

An electrolytic cell uses electrical energy 
to produce a chemical change that would 
otherwise not occur spontaneously.

can calculate the number of moles of electrons required to carry 1.80 3 104 cou-
lombs of charge:
1.80 3 104 C 3 1 mol e2
96,485 C 5 1.87 3 1021 mol e2
This means that 0.187 mole of electrons flowed into the Cu21 solution.

of electrons produces 1

Electrolysis of Water
We have seen that hydrogen and oxygen combine spontaneously to form water and 
that the accompanying decrease in free energy can be used to run a fuel cell to produce 
electricity. The reverse process, which is of course nonspontaneous, can be forced by 
electrolysis:

4H2O
or 
2H2O h 2H2 1 O2
Note that these potentials assume an anode chamber with 1 M H1 and a cathode cham-
ber with 1 M OH2. In pure water, where [H1] 5 [OH2] 5 1027 M, the potential for the 
overall process is 21.23 V.
 
In practice, however, if platinum electrodes connected to a 6-V battery are dipped 
into pure water, no reaction is observed because pure water contains so few ions that 
only a negligible current can flow. However, addition of even a small amount of a 
soluble salt causes an immediate evolution of bubbles of hydrogen and oxygen, as 
illustrated in Fig. 18.20.
INTERACTIVE EXAMPLE 18.9
Example 18.9 describes only the half-cell 
of interest. There also must be an anode at 
which oxidation is occurring.

Electrolysis of Mixtures of Ions
Suppose a solution in an electrolytic cell contains the ions Cu21, Ag1, and Zn21. If the 
voltage is initially very low and is gradually turned up, in which order will the metals 
be plated out onto the cathode? This question can be answered by looking at the stan-
dard  reduction potentials of these ions:
 Ag1 1 e2 h Ag¬†¬†¬†¬† %¬∞ 5 0.80 V
 Cu21 1 2e2 h Cu¬†¬†¬†¬† %¬∞ 5 0.34 V

Remember that the more positive the %8 value, the more the reaction has a tendency to 
proceed in the direction indicated. Of the three reactions listed, the reduction of Ag1 
occurs most easily, and the order of oxidizing ability is
Ag1 . Cu21 . Zn21
This means that silver will plate out first as the potential is increased, followed by cop-
per, and finally zinc.
Relative Oxidizing Abilities
An acidic solution contains the ions Ce41, VO21, and Fe31. Using the %8 values listed 
in Table 18.1, give the order of oxidizing ability of these species, and predict which 
one will be reduced at the cathode of an electrolytic cell at the lowest voltage.
 
SOLUTION 
The half-reactions and %8 values are
 Ce41 1 e2 h Ce31¬†¬†¬†¬†
 %¬∞ 5 1.70 V
 VO2
 1 1 2H1 1 e2 h VO21 1 H2O¬†¬†¬†¬† %¬∞ 5 1.00 V
 Fe31 1 e2 h Fe21¬†¬†¬†¬†
 %¬∞ 5 0.77 V
The order of oxidizing ability is therefore
Ce41 . VO2
 1 . Fe31
‚ñ† The Ce41 ion will be reduced at the lowest voltage in an electrolytic cell.
See Exercise 18.103
 
The principle described in this section is very useful, but it must be applied with 
some caution. For example, in the electrolysis of an aqueous solution of sodium chlo-
ride, we should be able to use %8 values to predict the products. Of the major species 
in the solution (Na1, Cl2, and H2O), only Cl2 and H2O can be readily oxidized. The 
half-reactions (written as oxidization processes) are
 2Cl2 h Cl2 1 2e2¬†¬†¬†¬†
 2%¬∞ 5 21.36 V
 2H2O h O2 1 4H1 1 4e2¬†¬†¬†¬†2 %¬∞ 5 21.23 V
Since water has the more positive potential, we would expect to see O2 produced at the 
anode because it is easier (thermodynamically) to oxidize H2O than Cl2. Actually, this 
does not happen. As the voltage is increased in the cell, the Cl2 ion is the first to be 
oxidized. A much higher potential than expected is required to oxidize water. The volt-
age required in excess of the expected value (called the overvoltage) is much greater 
for the production of O2 than for Cl2, which explains why chlorine is produced first.
 
The causes of overvoltage are very complex. Basically, the phenomenon is caused 
by difficulties in transferring electrons from the species in the solution to the atoms on 
the electrode across the electrode‚Äìsolution interface. Because of this situation, %8 val-
ues must be used cautiously in predicting the actual order of oxidation or reduction of 
species in an electrolytic cell.

hen the galleon Atocha was 
destroyed on a reef by a hurri-
cane in 1622, it was bound for Spain 
carrying approximately 47 tons of 
copper, gold, and silver from the  
New World. The bulk of the treasure 
was silver bars and coins packed in 
wooden chests. When treasure  
hunter Mel Fisher salvaged the  
silver in 1985, corrosion and marine 
growth had transformed the shiny 
metal into something that looked  
like coral. Restoring the silver to its 
original condition required an under-
standing of the chemical changes  
that had occurred in 350 years of 
being submerged in the ocean. Much 
of this chemistry we have already 
considered at various places in this 
text.
As the wooden chests containing 
the silver decayed, the oxygen supply 
was depleted, favoring the growth of 
certain bacteria that use the sulfate 
ion rather than oxygen as an oxidizing 
agent to generate energy. As these 
bacteria consume sulfate ions, they 
release hydrogen sulfide gas that 
reacts with silver to form black silver 
sulfide:
2Ag(s) 1 H2S(aq) h Ag2S(s) 1 H2(g)
Thus, over the years, the surface of the 
silver became covered with a tightly 
adhering layer of corrosion, which 
fortunately protected the silver under-
neath and thus prevented total conver-
sion of the silver to silver sulfide.
Another change that took place as 
the wood decomposed was the forma-
tion of carbon dioxide. This shifted the 
equilibrium that is present in the 
ocean,
CO2(aq) 1 H2O(l) m  
 
HCO32(aq) 1 H1(aq)
to the right, producing higher concen-
trations of HCO32. In turn, the HCO32 
reacted with Ca21 ions present in the 
seawater to form calcium carbonate:
Ca21(aq) 1 HCO32(aq) m  
 
CaCO3(s) 1 H1(aq)
Calcium carbonate is the main compo-
nent of limestone. Thus, over time, the 
corroded silver coins and bars became 
encased in limestone.
Both the limestone formation and 
the corrosion had to be dealt with. Since 
CaCO3 contains the basic anion CO322, 
acid dissolves limestone:
2H1(aq) 1 CaCO3(s) h  
 
Ca21(aq) 1 CO2(g) 1 H2O(l)
Soaking the mass of coins in a buffered 
acidic bath for several hours allowed 
the individual pieces to be separated, 
and the black Ag2S on the surfaces was 
revealed. An abrasive could not be 
used to remove this corrosion; it would 
have destroyed the details of the 
engraving‚Äîa very valuable feature of 
the coins to a historian or a collector‚Äî
and it would have washed away some 
of the silver. Instead, the corrosion 
reaction was reversed through electro-
lytic reduction. The coins were con-
nected to the cathode of an electrolytic 
cell in a dilute sodium hydroxide solu-
tion as represented in the figure.
As electrons flow, the Ag1 ions in 
the silver sulfide are reduced to silver 
metal:
Ag2S 1 2e2 h Ag 1 S22
As a by-product, bubbles of hydrogen 
gas from the reduction of water form 
on the surface of the coins:
2H2O 1 2e2 h H2(g) 1 2OH2
The agitation caused by the bubbles 
loosens the flakes of metal sulfide and 
helps clean the coins.
These procedures have made it 
possible to restore the treasure to very 
nearly its condition when the Atocha 
sailed many years ago.

18.8 Commercial Electrolytic 
Processes
The chemistry of metals is characterized by their ability to donate electrons to form 
ions. Because metals are typically such good reducing agents, most are found in nature 
in ores, mixtures of ionic compounds often containing oxide, sulfide, and silicate 
anions. The noble metals, such as gold, silver, and platinum, are more difficult to oxi-
dize and are often found as pure metals.
Production of Aluminum
Aluminum is one of the most abundant elements on earth, ranking third behind oxygen 
and silicon. Since aluminum is a very active metal, it is found in nature as its oxide in 
an ore called bauxite (named after Les Baux, France, where it was discovered in 1821). 
Production of aluminum metal from its ore proved to be more difficult than production 
of most other metals. In 1782 Lavoisier recognized aluminum to be a metal ‚Äúwhose 
affinity for oxygen is so strong that it cannot be overcome by any known reducing 
agent.‚Äù As a result, pure aluminum metal remained unknown. Finally, in 1854 a pro-
cess was found for producing metallic aluminum using sodium, but aluminum 
remained a very expensive  rarity. In fact, it is said that Napoleon III served his most 
honored guests with aluminum forks and spoons, while the others had to settle for gold 
and silver utensils.
The breakthrough came in 1886 when two men, Charles M. Hall in the United 
States and Paul Heroult in France, almost simultaneously discovered a practical elec-
trolytic process for producing aluminum (Fig. 18.21). The key factor in the Hall‚Äì 
Heroult  process is the use of molten cryolite (Na3AlF6) as the solvent for the  aluminum 
oxide.
 
Electrolysis is possible only if ions can move to the electrodes. A common method 
for producing ion mobility is dissolving the substance to be electrolyzed in water. This 
is not possible in the case of aluminum because water is more easily reduced than 
Al31, as the following standard reduction potentials show:
 Al31 1 3e2 h Al¬†¬†¬†¬†
 %¬∞ 5 21.66 V
 2H2O 1 2e2 h H2 1 2OH2¬†¬†¬†¬† %¬∞ 5 20.83 V
Thus aluminum metal cannot be plated out of an aqueous solution of Al31.
 
Ion mobility also can be produced by melting the salt. But the melting point of solid 
Al2O3 is much too high (20508C) to allow practical electrolysis of the molten oxide. A 
mixture of Al2O3 and Na3AlF6, however, has a melting point of 10008C, and the result-
ing molten mixture can be used to obtain aluminum metal electrolytically. Because of 
this discovery by Hall and Heroult, the price of aluminum plunged (Table 18.3), and 
its use became economically feasible.
 
Bauxite is not pure aluminum oxide (called alumina); it also contains the oxides of 
iron, silicon, and titanium, and various silicate materials. To obtain the pure hydrated 
alumina (Al2O3 ? nH2O), the crude bauxite is treated with aqueous sodium hydroxide. 
Being amphoteric, alumina dissolves in the basic solution:
Al2O31s2 1 2OH21aq2 h 2AlO2
21aq2 1 H2O1 l 2
The other metal oxides, which are basic, remain as solids. The solution containing the 
aluminate ion (AlO22) is separated from the sludge of the other oxides and is acidified 
with carbon dioxide gas, causing the hydrated alumina to reprecipitate:
2CO21 g2 1 2AlO2
21aq2 1 1n 1 12H2O1 l 2 h 2HCO3
21aq2 1 Al2O3 # nH2O1s2
 
The purified alumina is then mixed with cryolite and melted, and the aluminum ion 
is reduced to aluminum metal in an electrolytic cell of the type shown in Fig. 18.22. 
18.8
FIGURE 18.21 Charles Martin Hall 
(1863‚Äì1914) was a student at Oberlin 
College in Ohio when he first became 
interested in aluminum. One of his profes-
sors commented that anyone who could 
manufacture aluminum cheaply would 
make a fortune, and Hall decided to give it 
a try. The 21-year-old Hall worked in a 
wooden shed near his house with an iron 
frying pan as a container, a blacksmith‚Äôs 
forge as a heat source, and galvanic cells 
constructed from fruit jars. Using these 
crude galvanic cells, Hall found that he 
could produce aluminum by passing a 
current through a molten Al2O3/Na3AlF6 
mixture. By a strange coincidence, Paul 
Heroult, a Frenchman who was born and 
died in the same years as Hall, made the 
same discovery at about the same time.

Because the electrolyte solution contains a large number of aluminum-containing ions, 
the chemistry is not completely clear. However, the alumina probably reacts with the 
cryolite anion as follows:
Al2O3 1 4AlF 6
 32 h 3Al2OF 6 
 22 1 6F2
The electrode reactions are thought to be

Anode reaction:¬†¬†¬†¬† 2Al2OF 6
 22 1 12F2 1 C h 4AlF 6
 32 1 CO2 1 4e2
The overall cell reaction can be written as
2Al2O3 1 3C h 4Al 1 3CO2
 
The aluminum produced in this electrolytic process is 99.5% pure. To be useful as 
a structural material, aluminum is alloyed with metals such as zinc (used for trailer and 
aircraft construction) and manganese (used for cooking utensils, storage tanks, and 
highway signs). The production of aluminum consumes about 5% of all the electricity 
used in the United States.
Electrorefining of Metals
Purification of metals is another important application of electrolysis. For example, 
impure copper from the chemical reduction of copper ore is cast into large slabs that 
serve as the anodes for electrolytic cells. Aqueous copper sulfate is the electrolyte, and 
thin sheets of ultrapure copper function as the cathodes (Fig. 18.23).
 
The main reaction at the anode is
Cu h Cu21 1 2e2
Other metals such as iron and zinc are also oxidized from the impure anode:
 Zn h Zn21 1 2e2
 Fe h Fe21 1 2e2
Noble metal impurities in the anode are not oxidized at the voltage used; they fall to 
the bottom of the cell to form a sludge, which is processed to remove the valuable 
silver, gold, and platinum.
 
The Cu21 ions from the solution are deposited onto the cathode

ates at a current flow of up to 250,000 A.

Metal Plating
Metals that readily corrode can often be protected by the application of a thin coating 
of a metal that resists corrosion. Examples are ‚Äútin‚Äù cans, which are actually steel cans 
with a thin coating of tin, and chrome-plated steel bumpers for automobiles.
 
An object can be plated by making it the cathode in a tank containing ions of the 
plating metal. The silver plating of a spoon is shown schematically in Fig. 18.24(b). In 
an actual plating process, the solution also contains ligands that form complexes with 
the silver ion. By lowering the concentration of Ag1 in this way, a smooth, even coat-
ing of silver is obtained.

Electrolysis of Sodium Chloride
Sodium metal is mainly produced by the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride. 
Because solid NaCl has a rather high melting point (8008C), it is usually mixed with 
solid CaCl2 to lower the melting point to about (6008C). The mixture is then electro-
lyzed in a Downs cell, as illustrated in Fig. 18.25, where the reactions are
Anode reaction:¬†¬†
 2Cl2 h Cl2 1 2e2
Cathode reaction:¬†¬† Na1 1 e2 h Na
At the temperatures in the Downs cell, the sodium is liquid and is drained off, then 
cooled, and cast into blocks. Because it is so reactive, sodium must be stored in an inert 
solvent, such as mineral oil, to prevent its oxidation.
 
Electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride (brine) is an important industrial process 
for the production of chlorine and sodium hydroxide. In fact, this process is the second 
largest consumer of electricity in the United States, after the production of aluminum. 
Sodium is not produced in this process under normal circumstances because H2O is 
more easily reduced than Na1, as the standard reduction potentials show:
 Na1 1 e2 h Na¬†¬†¬†¬†
 %¬∞ 5 22.71 V
 2H2O 1 2e2 h H2 1 2OH2¬†¬†¬†¬† %¬∞ 5 20.83 V
Hydrogen, not sodium, is produced at the cathode.
 
For the reasons we discussed in Section 18.7, chlorine gas is produced at the anode. 
Thus the electrolysis of brine produces hydrogen and chlorine:
Anode reaction:¬†¬†¬†¬†
 2Cl2 h Cl2 1 2e2
Cathode reaction:¬†¬†¬†¬† 2H2O 1 2e2 h H2 1 2OH2
It leaves a solution containing dissolved NaOH and NaCl.
Addition of a nonvolatile solute lowers the 
melting point of the solvent, molten NaCl 
in this case.

The contamination of the sodium hydroxide by NaCl can be virtually eliminated 
using a special mercury cell for electrolyzing brine (Fig. 18.26). In this cell, mercury 
is the conductor at the cathode, and because hydrogen gas has an extremely high over-
voltage with a mercury electrode, Na1 is reduced instead of H2O. The resulting sodium 
metal dissolves in the mercury, forming a liquid alloy, which is then pumped to a 
chamber where the dissolved sodium reacts with water to produce hydrogen:
2Na1s2 1 2H2O1 l 2 h 2Na11aq2 1 2OH21aq2 1 H21 g2
Relatively pure solid NaOH can be recovered from the aqueous solution, and the 
regenerated mercury is then pumped back to the electrolysis cell. This process, called 
the chlor‚Äìalkali process, was the main method for producing chlorine and sodium 
hydroxide in the United States for many years. However, because of the environmental 
problems associated with the mercury cell, it has been largely displaced in the chlor‚Äì
alkali industry by other technologies. In the United States, nearly 75% of the chlor‚Äì 
alkali production is now carried out in diaphragm cells. In a diaphragm cell the cath-
ode and anode are separated by a diaphragm that allows passage of H2O molecules, 
Na1 ions, and, to a limited extent, Cl2 ions. The diaphragm does not allow OH2 ions 
to pass through it. Thus the H2 and OH2 formed at the cathode are kept separate from 
the Cl2 formed at the anode. The major disadvantage of this process is that the aqueous 
effluent pumped from the cathode compartment contains a mixture of sodium hydrox-
ide and unreacted sodium chloride, which must be separated if pure sodium hydroxide 
is a desired product.
 
In the past 30 years, a new process has been developed in the chlor‚Äìalkali industry 
that uses a membrane to separate the anode and cathode compartments in brine elec-
trolysis cells. The membrane is superior to a diaphragm because the membrane is 
impermeable to anions. Only cations can flow through the membrane. Because neither 
Cl2 nor OH2 ions can pass through the membrane separating the anode and cathode 
compartments, NaCl contamination of the NaOH formed at the cathode does not  
occur. Although membrane technology is now just becoming prominent in the United 
States, it is the  dominant method for chlor‚Äìalkali production in Japan.

process that has negative effects. What happens in the 
corrosion of a metal such as iron? What must be present 
for the corrosion of iron to take place? How can mois-
ture and salt increase the severity of corrosion? Explain 
how the following protect metals from corrosion:
a. paint
b. durable oxide coatings
c. galvanizing
d. sacrificial metal
e. alloying
f. cathodic protection
 9. What characterizes an electrolytic cell? What is an 
ampere? When the current applied to an electrolytic cell 
is multiplied by the time in seconds, what quantity is 
determined? How is this quantity converted to moles of 
electrons required? How are moles of electrons required 
converted to moles of metal plated out? What does plat-
ing mean? How do you predict the cathode and the anode 
half-reactions in an electrolytic cell? Why is the elec-
trolysis of molten salts much easier to predict in terms of 
what occurs at the anode and cathode than the electroly-
sis of aqueous dissolved salts? What is overvoltage?
 10. Electrolysis has many important industrial applications. 
What are some of these applications? The electrolysis of 
molten NaCl is the major process by which sodium metal is 
produced. However, the electrolysis of aqueous NaCl does 
not produce sodium metal under normal circumstances. 
Why? What is purification of a metal by electrolysis?
 5. The Nernst equation allows determination of the cell poten-
tial for a galvanic cell at nonstandard conditions. Write out 
the Nernst equation. What are nonstandard conditions? 
What do %, %8, n, and Q stand for in the Nernst equation? 
What does the Nernst equation reduce to when a redox 
reaction is at equilibrium? What are the signs of DG¬∞ and 
%8 when K , 1? When K . 1? When K 5 1? Explain the 
following statement: % determines spontaneity, while 
%8 determines the equilibrium position. Under what 
conditions can you use %8 to predict spontaneity?
 6. What are concentration cells? What is %8 in a concen-
tration cell? What is the driving force for a concentra-
tion cell to produce a voltage? Is the higher or the 
lower ion concentration solution present at the anode? 
When the anode ion concentration is decreased and/or 
the cathode ion concentration is increased, both give 
rise to larger cell potentials. Why? Concentration cells 
are commonly used to calculate the value of equilib-
rium constants for various reactions. For example, the 
silver concentration cell illustrated in Fig. 18.9 can be 
used to determine the Ksp value for AgCl(s). To do so, 
NaCl is added to the anode compartment until no more 
precipitate forms. The [Cl2] in solution is then deter-
mined somehow. What happens to %cell when NaCl is 
added to the anode compartment? To calculate the Ksp 
value, [Ag1] must be calculated. Given the value of 
%cell, how is [Ag1] determined at the anode?
 7. Batteries are galvanic cells. What happens to %cell as a 
battery discharges? Does a battery represent a system at 
equilibrium? Explain. What is %cell when a battery 
reaches equilibrium? How are batteries and fuel cells 
alike? How are they different? The U.S. space program

the difference between a galvanic and an electrolytic cell.
 24. The general rule for salt bridges is that anions flow to the 
anode and cations flow to the cathode. Explain why this is 
true.
 25. When magnesium metal is added to a beaker of HCl(aq), a gas 
is produced. Knowing that magnesium is oxidized and that 
hydrogen is reduced, write the balanced equation for the reac-
tion. How many electrons are transferred in the balanced 
equation? What quantity of useful work can be obtained when 
Mg is added directly to the beaker of HCl? How can you har-
ness this reaction to do useful work?
 26. How can one construct a galvanic cell from two substances, 
each having a negative standard reduction potential?
 27. The free energy change for a reaction, DG, is an extensive 
property. What is an extensive property? Surprisingly, one 
can calculate DG from the cell potential, %, for the reaction. 
This is surprising because % is an intensive property. How can 
the extensive property DG be calculated from the intensive 
property %?
 28. What is wrong with the following statement: The best concen-
tration cell will consist of the substance having the most posi-
tive standard reduction potential. What drives a concentration 
cell to produce a large voltage?
 29. When jump-starting a car with a dead battery, the ground 
jumper should be attached to a remote part of the engine block.

 10. Explain the following relationships: DG and w, cell potential 
and w, cell potential and DG, cell potential and Q. Using these 
relationships, explain how you could make a cell in which 
both electrodes are the same metal and both solutions contain 
the same compound, but at different concentrations. Why does 
such a cell run spontaneously?
 11. Explain why cell potentials are not multiplied by the coeffi-
cients in the balanced redox equation. (Use the relationship 
between DG and cell potential to do this.)

zero? When is %8 equal to zero? (Consider ‚Äúregular‚Äù galvanic 
cells as well as concentration cells.)

As the concentration of Ag1 is increased? What happens to %8 
in these cases?
 14. Look up the reduction potential for Fe31 to Fe21. Look up the 
reduction potential for Fe21 to Fe. Finally, look up the reduc-
tion potential for Fe31 to Fe. You should notice that adding the 
reduction potentials for the first two does not give the potential 
for the third. Why not? Show how you can use the first two 
potentials to calculate the third potential.
 15. If the cell potential is proportional to work and the standard 
reduction potential for the hydrogen ion is zero, does this 
mean that the reduction of the hydrogen ion requires no work?

work because standard reduction potentials are dependent on 
concentration. Explain.

S
ince the chemistry of an atom is determined by the number and arrangement 
of its electrons, the properties of the nucleus are not of primary importance to 
chemists. In the simplest view, the nucleus provides the positive charge to bind the 
electrons in atoms and molecules. However, a quick reading of any daily newspaper 
will show you that the nucleus and its properties have an important impact on our 
society. This chapter considers those aspects of the nucleus about which everyone 
should have some knowledge.
Several aspects of the nucleus are immediately impressive: its very small size, its 
very large density, and the magnitude of the energy that holds it together. The radius 
of a typical nucleus appears to be about 10213 cm. This can be compared to the radius 
of a typical atom, which is on the order of 1028 cm. A visualization will help you 
appreciate the small size of the nucleus: If the nucleus of the hydrogen atom were 
the size of a Ping-Pong ball, the electron in the 1s orbital would be, on average, 
0.5¬†kilometer (0.3 mile) away. The density of the nucleus is equally impressive‚Äî
approximately 1.6 3 1014 g/cm3. A sphere of nuclear material the size of a Ping-
Pong ball would have a mass of 2.5 billion tons! In addition, the energies involved 
in nuclear processes are typically millions of times larger than those associated with 
normal chemical reactions. This fact makes nuclear processes very attractive for 
feeding the voracious energy appetite of our civilization.
Atomos, the Greek root of the word atom, means ‚Äúindivisible.‚Äù It was originally 
believed that the atom was the ultimate indivisible particle of which all matter was 
composed. However, as we discussed in Chapter 2, Lord Rutherford showed in 1911 
that the atom is not homogeneous, but rather has a dense, positively charged center 
surrounded by electrons. Subsequently, scientists have learned that the nucleus of the 
atom can be subdivided into particles called neutrons and protons. In fact, in the past 
two decades it has become apparent that even the protons and neutrons are composed 
of smaller particles called quarks.
For most purposes, the nucleus can be regarded as a collection of nucleons (neu-
trons and protons), and the internal structures of these particles can be ignored. As we 
discussed in Chapter 2, the number of protons in a particular nucleus is called the 
atomic number (Z), and the sum of the neutrons and protons is the mass number (A). 
Atoms that have identical atomic numbers but different mass number values are called 
isotopes. However, we usually do not use the singular form isotope to refer to a par-
ticular member of a group of isotopes. Rather, we use the term nuclide. A nuclide is a 
unique atom, represented by the symbol
A
ZX
where X represents the symbol for a particular element. For example, the following  
nuclides constitute the isotopes of carbon: carbon-12 112¬†6C2, carbon-13 113¬†6C2, and 
carbon-14 114¬†6C2 .
19.1 Nuclear Stability and Radioactive 
Decay
Nuclear stability is the central topic of this chapter and forms the basis for all the 
important applications related to nuclear processes. Nuclear stability can be consid-
ered from both a kinetic and a thermodynamic point of view. Thermodynamic stabil-
ity, as we will use the term here, refers to the potential energy of a particular nucleus 
as compared with the sum of the potential energies of its component protons and neu-
trons. We will use the term kinetic stability to describe the probability that a nucleus 
will undergo decomposition to form a different nucleus‚Äîa process called radioactive 
decay. We will  consider radioactivity in this section.
The atomic number Z is the number of 
protons in a nucleus; the mass number A 
is the sum of protons and neutrons in a 
nucleus.
The term isotopes refers to a group of 
nuclides with the same atomic number. 
Each individual atom is properly called a 
nuclide, not an isotope.

Many nuclei are radioactive; that is, they decompose, forming another nucleus and 
producing one or more particles. An example is carbon-14, which decays as follows:
14
6C h 14
7N 1
0
21e
where 
0
21e represents an electron, which is called a beta particle, or b particle, in 
nuclear terminology. This equation is typical of those representing radioactive decay 
in that both A and Z must be conserved. That is, the Z values must give the same sum 
on both sides of the equation (6 5 7 2 1), as must the A values (14 5 14 1 0).
 
Of the approximately 2000 known nuclides, only 279 are stable with respect to 
radioactive decay. Tin has the largest number of stable isotopes‚Äî10.
 
It is instructive to examine how the numbers of neutrons and protons in a nucleus are 
related to its stability with respect to radioactive decay. Figure 19.1 shows a plot of the 
positions of the stable nuclei as a function of the number of protons (Z) and the number 
of neutrons (A 2 Z). The stable nuclides are said to reside in the zone of stability.
 
The following are some important observations concerning radioactive decay:
‚óè All nuclides with 84 or more protons are unstable with respect to radioactive decay.
‚óè Light nuclides are stable when Z equals A 2 Z, that is, when the neutron-to-proton 
ratio is 1. However, for heavier elements the neutron-to-proton ratio required for 
stability is greater than 1 and increases with Z.
‚óè Certain combinations of protons and neutrons seem to confer special stability. For 
example, nuclides with even numbers of protons and neutrons are more often stable 
than those with odd numbers, as shown by the data in Table 19.1.
‚óè There are also certain specific numbers of protons or neutrons that produce espe-
cially stable nuclides. These magic numbers are 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126. This 
behavior parallels that for atoms in which certain numbers of electrons (2, 10, 18, 
36, 54, and 86) produce special chemical stability (the noble gases).

Types of Radioactive Decay
Radioactive nuclei can undergo decomposition in various ways. These decay processes 
fall into two categories: those that involve a change in the mass number of the decaying 
nucleus and those that do not. We will consider the former type of process first.
 
An alpha particle, or a particle, is a helium nucleus 14
2He2 . Alpha-particle pro-
duction is a very common mode of decay for heavy radioactive nuclides. For example, 
238
¬†92U, the predominant (99.3%) isotope of natural uranium, decays by a-particle 
production:
238
92U h 4
2He 1 234
90Th
Another a-particle producer is 230
¬†90Th:
230
90Th h 4
2He 1 226
88Ra
 
Another decay process in which the mass number of the decaying nucleus changes 
is spontaneous fission, the splitting of a heavy nuclide into two lighter nuclides with 
similar mass numbers. Although this process occurs at an extremely slow rate for most 
nuclides, it is important in some cases, such as for 254
¬†98Cf, where spontaneous fission is 
the predominant mode of decay.
 
The most common decay process in which the mass number of the decaying nucleus 
remains constant is b-particle production. For example, the thorium-234 nuclide 
produces a b particle and is converted to protactinium-234:
234
90Th h 234
91Pa 1
0
21e
Iodine-131 is also a b-particle producer:
131
53I h
0
21e 1 131
54Xe
The b particle is assigned the mass number 0, since its mass is tiny compared with that 
of a proton or neutron. Because the value of Z is 21 for the b particle, the atomic 
number for the new nuclide is greater by 1 than for the original nuclide. Thus the net 
effect of b-particle production is to change a neutron to a proton. We therefore expect 
nuclides that lie above the zone of stability (those nuclides whose neutron/proton 
ratios are too high) to be b-particle producers.
 
It should be pointed out that although the b particle is an electron, the emitting 
nucleus does not contain electrons. As we shall see later in this chapter, a given quan-
tity of energy (which is best regarded as a form of matter) can become a particle 
(another form of matter) under certain circumstances. The unstable nuclide creates an 
electron as it releases energy in the decay process. The electron thus results from the 
decay process rather than being present before the decay occurs. Think of this as some-
what like talking: Words are not stored inside us but are formed as we speak. Later in 
this chapter we will discuss in more detail this very interesting phenomenon where 
matter in the form of particles and matter in the form of energy can interchange.
a-Particle production involves a change 
in A for the decaying nucleus; b-particle 
production has no effect on A.

A gamma ray, or g ray, refers to a high-energy photon. Frequently, g-ray produc-
tion accompanies nuclear decays and particle reactions, such as in the a-particle decay 
of 238
¬†92U:
238
¬†92U h 4
2He 1 234
¬†90Th 1 2 0
0g
where two g rays of different energies are produced in addition to the a particle. The 
emission of g rays is one way a nucleus with excess energy (in an excited nuclear 
state) can relax to its ground state.
 
Positron production occurs for nuclides that are below the zone of stability (those 
nuclides whose neutron/proton ratios are too small). The positron is a particle with the 
same mass as the electron but opposite charge. An example of a nuclide that decays by 
positron production is sodium-22:
22
11Na h 0
1e 1 22
10Ne
Note that the net effect is to change a proton to a neutron, causing the product nuclide 
to have a higher neutron/proton ratio than the original nuclide.
 
Besides being oppositely charged, the positron shows an even more fundamental 
difference from the electron: It is the antiparticle of the electron. When a positron col-
lides with an electron, the particulate matter is changed to electromagnetic radiation in 
the form of high-energy photons:
0
21e 1 0
1e h 2 0
0g
This process, which is characteristic of matter‚Äìantimatter collisions, is called annihi-
lation and is another example of the interchange of the forms of matter.
 
Electron capture is a process in which one of the inner-orbital electrons is cap-
tured by the nucleus, as illustrated by the process

This reaction would have been of great interest to the alchemists, but unfortunately it 
does not occur at a rate that would make it a practical means for changing mercury to 
gold. Gamma rays are always produced along with electron capture to release excess 
energy. The various types of radioactive decay are summarized in Table 19.2.
CRITICAL THINKING What if a nuclide were to undergo two 
successive decays such that it became the original nuclide? Which decays could 
account for this? Provide an example.

Nuclear Equations I
Write balanced equations for each of the following processes.
a. 
11¬†6C produces a positron.
b. 
214
¬†83Bi produces a b particle.
c. 
237
¬†93Np produces an a particle.
 
SOLUTION 
a. We must find the product nuclide represented by A
ZX in the following equation:
11¬†6C h 0
1e 1 A
ZX
 
h 
 
Positron
We can find the identity of A
ZX by recognizing that the total of the Z and A values 
must be the same on both sides of the equation. Thus for X, Z must be 6 2 1 5 5 
and A must be 11 2 0 5 11. Therefore, A
ZX is 11¬†5B. (The fact that Z¬†is¬†5 tells us 
that the nuclide is boron.) Thus the balanced equation is
11¬†6C h 0
1e 1 11¬†5B
b. Knowing that a b particle is represented by 
0
21e and that Z and A are conserved, 
we can write
214
¬†83Bi h
0
21e 1 214
¬†84X
so A
ZX must be 214
¬†84Po.
c. Since an a particle is represented by 4
2He, the balanced equation must be
237
¬†93Np h 4
2He 1 233
¬†91Pa
See Exercises 19.15, 19.18, and 19.19

a. 
195
79Au 1 ? n 195
78Pt
b. 
38
19K n 38
18Ar 1 ?
 
SOLUTION 
a. Since A does not change and Z decreases by 1, the missing particle must be an 
electron:
195
¬†79Au 1
0
21e h 195
¬†78Pt
This is an example of electron capture.
b. To conserve Z and A, the missing particle must be a positron:
38
19K h 38
18Ar 1 0
1e
Thus potassium-38 decays by positron production.
See Exercises 19.16, 19.17, and 19.20
 
Often a radioactive nucleus cannot reach a stable state through a single decay pro-
cess. In such a case, a decay series occurs until a stable nuclide is formed. A well-
known example is the decay series that starts with 238
¬†92U and ends with 206
¬†82Pb, as shown 
in Fig. 19.2. Similar series exist for 235
¬†92U:

and for 232

19.2 The Kinetics of Radioactive 
Decay
In a sample containing radioactive nuclides of a given type, each nuclide has a certain 
probability of undergoing decay. Suppose that a sample of 1000 atoms of a certain 
nuclide produces 10 decay events per hour. This means that over the span of an hour, 
1 out of every 100 nuclides will decay. Given that this probability of decay is charac-
teristic for this type of nuclide, we could predict that a 2000-atom sample would give 
20 decay events per hour. Thus, for radioactive nuclides, the rate of decay, which is 
the negative of the change in the number of nuclides per unit time
a2DN
Dt b
is directly proportional to the number of nuclides N in a given sample:
Rate 5 2DN
Dt ~ N
The negative sign is included because the number of nuclides is decreasing. We now 
insert a proportionality constant k to give
Rate 5 2DN
Dt 5 kN
This is the rate law for a first-order process, as we saw in Chapter 12. As shown in 
Section 12.4, the integrated first-order rate law is
ln a N
N0
b 5 2kt
where N0 represents the original number of nuclides (at t 5 0) and N represents the 
number remaining at time t.

Half-Life
The half-life (t1y2) of a radioactive sample is defined as the time required for the num-
ber of nuclides to reach half the original value (N0y2). We can use this definition in 
connection with the integrated first-order rate law (as we did in Section 12.4) to pro-
duce the following expression for t1y2:
t1/2 5 ln122
k
5 0.693
k
Thus, if the half-life of a radioactive nuclide is known, the rate constant can be easily 
calculated, and vice versa.
Kinetics of Nuclear Decay I
Technetium-99m is used to form pictures of internal organs in the body and is often 
used to assess heart damage. The m for this nuclide indicates an excited nuclear state 
that decays to the ground state by gamma emission. The rate constant for decay of 
99m
43Tc is known to be 1.16 3 1021/h. What is the half-life of this nuclide?
 
SOLUTION 
The half-life can be calculated from the expression
‚ñ†  t1/2 5 0.693
k
5
0.693
1.16 3 1021/h
 5 5.98 h
Thus it will take 5.98 h for a given sample of technetium-99m to decrease to half the 
 original number of nuclides.
See Exercise 19.31
 
As we saw in Section 12.4, the half-life for a first-order process is constant. This is 
shown for the b-particle decay of strontium-90 in Fig. 19.3; it takes 28.9 years for each 
halving of the amount of 90
38Sr. Contamination of the environment with 90
38Sr poses seri-
ous health hazards because of the similar chemistry of strontium and calcium (both are 
in Group 2A). Strontium-90 in grass and hay is incorporated into cow‚Äôs milk along 
with calcium and is then passed on to humans, where it lodges in the bones. Because 
of its relatively long half-life, it persists for years in humans, causing radiation damage 
that may lead to cancer.

Kinetics of Nuclear Decay II
The half-life of molybdenum-99 is 66.0 h. How much of a 1.000-mg sample of 99
42Mo 
is left after 330 h?
 
SOLUTION 
The easiest way to solve this problem is to recognize that 330 h represents five half-lives 
for 99
42Mo:
330 5 5 3 66.0
We can sketch the change that occurs, as is shown in Fig. 19.4. Thus, after 330 h,  
0.031 mg 99
42Mo remains.
See Exercises 19.33 and 19.34
 
The half-lives of radioactive nuclides vary over a tremendous range. For example, 
144
60 Nd has a half-life of 2.3 3 1015 years, while 214
¬†84Po has a half-life of 2 3 1024 sec-

19.3 Nuclear Transformations
In 1919 Lord Rutherford observed the first nuclear transformation, the change of one 
element into another. He found that by bombarding 14¬†7N with a particles, the nuclide 
17¬†8O could be produced:
14¬†7N 1 4
2He h 17¬†8O 1 1
1H
Fourteen years later, Irene Curie and her husband Frederick Joliot observed a similar 
transformation from aluminum to phosphorus:
27
13Al 1 4
2He h 30
15P 1 1
0n
where 1
0n represents a neutron.
 
Over the years, many other nuclear transformations have been achieved, mostly 
using particle accelerators, which, as the name reveals, are devices used to give par-
ticles very high velocities. Because of the electrostatic repulsion between the target 
nucleus and a positive ion, accelerators are needed when positive ions are used as 
bombarding particles. The particle, accelerated to a very high velocity, can overcome 
the repulsion and penetrate the target nucleus, thus effecting the transformation. A 
schematic diagram of one type of particle accelerator, the cyclotron, is shown in 
Fig.¬†19.5. The ion is introduced at the center of the cyclotron and is accelerated in an 
expanding spiral path by use of alternating electric fields in the presence of a magnetic 
field. The linear accelerator illustrated in Fig. 19.6 uses changing electric fields to 
achieve high velocities on a linear pathway.
 
In addition to positive ions, neutrons are often used as bombarding particles to 
effect nuclear transformations. Because neutrons are uncharged and thus not repelled 
electrostatically by a target nucleus, they are readily absorbed by many nuclei, leading 
to new nuclides. The most common source of neutrons for this purpose is a fission 
reactor (see Section 19.6).

FIGURE 19.6 Schematic diagram of a linear accelerator, which uses a changing electric field to

are negatively charged, and the even-numbered tubes are positively charged. The positive ion is 
thus attracted into tube 1. As the ion leaves tube 1, the tube polarities are reversed. Now tube 1 is 
positive, repelling the positive ion, and tube 2 is negative, attracting the positive ion. This process 
continues, eventually producing high particle velocity.

velocity increases. When the particle 
has sufficient speed, it exits the accel-
erator and is directed at the target 
nucleus.

T
he discovery of element 117 (Ts) 
provides an excellent illustration 
of the importance of teamwork in 
modern scientific activities. Although 
element 117 was prepared in Dubna, 
Russia, the target nuclides were pre-
pared at Oak Ridge National Labora-
tory (ORNL) in Tennessee, and data 
analysis on the discovery was carried 
out at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory 
in California.
The birth of element 117 started 
at ORNL where a 250-day irradiation 
experiment produced 22 mg of 
 berkelium-249, which has a 320-day 
half-life. This process was followed by 
a 90-day effort to separate and purify 
the berkelium, after which the berke-
lium was sent to the Joint Institute for 
Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Rus-
sia. JINR has an accelerator beam that 
enabled calcium-48 to be directed at 
the berkelium-249 target. This 150-day 
process resulted in the production of 
six atoms of element 117 by the follow-
ing nuclear reactions:

The periodic table shows Ts as the 
heaviest element in the halogen fam-
ily. However, because only six atoms of 
Ts were produced and they existed for 
only about 0.01 second, no evidence 
is available at present of the chemical 
behavior of Ts.

By using neutron and positive-ion bombardment, scientists have been able to extend 
the periodic table. Prior to 1940, the heaviest known element was uranium (Z 5 92), 
but in 1940, neptunium (Z 5 93) was produced by neutron bombardment of 238
¬†92U. The 
process initially gives 239
¬†92U, which decays to 239
¬†93Np by b-particle production:

In the years since 1940, the elements with atomic numbers greater than 92, called 
the transuranium elements,* have been synthesized. Many of these elements have 
very short half-lives, as shown in Table 19.4. As a result, only a few atoms of some 
have ever been formed. This, of course, makes the chemical characterization of these 
elements  extremely difficult.
 
19.4 Detection and Uses 
of Radioactivity
Although various instruments measure radioactivity levels, the most familiar of them 
is the Geiger‚ÄìM√ºller counter, or Geiger counter (Fig. 19.7). This instrument takes 
advantage of the fact that the high-energy particles from radioactive decay processes

produce ions when they travel through matter. The probe of the Geiger counter is filled 
with argon gas, which can be ionized by a rapidly moving particle. This reaction is 
demonstrated by the equation:
Ar1 g2  88888n Ar11 g2 1 e2
Normally, a sample of argon gas will not conduct a current when an electrical potential 
is applied. However, the formation of ions and electrons produced by the passage of 
the high-energy particle allows a momentary current to flow. Electronic devices detect 
this current flow, and the number of these events can be counted. Thus the decay rate 
of the radioactive sample can be determined.
 
Another instrument often used to detect levels of radioactivity is a scintillation 
counter, which takes advantage of the fact that certain substances, such as zinc sulfide, 
give off light when they are struck by high-energy radiation. A photocell senses the 
flashes of light that occur as the radiation strikes and thus measures the number of 
decay events per unit of time.
Dating by Radioactivity
Archaeologists, geologists, and others involved in reconstructing the ancient history of 
the earth rely heavily on radioactivity to provide accurate dates for artifacts and rocks. 
A method that has been very important for dating ancient articles made from wood or 
cloth is  radiocarbon dating, or carbon-14 dating, a technique originated in the 1940s 
by Willard Libby, an American chemist who received a Nobel Prize for his efforts in 
this field.
 
Radiocarbon dating is based on the radioactivity of the nuclide 14¬†6C, which decays 
via b-particle production:
14¬†6C h
0
21e 1 14¬†7N
Carbon-14 is continuously produced in the atmosphere when high-energy neutrons 
from space collide with nitrogen-14:
14¬†7N 1 1
0n h 14¬†6C 1 1
1H
Thus carbon-14 is continuously produced by this process, and it continuously 
decomposes through b-particle production. Over the years, the rates for these two 
processes have become equal, and like a participant in a chemical reaction at equi-
librium, the amount of 14¬†6C that is present in the atmosphere remains approximately 
constant.
 
Carbon-14 can be used to date wood and cloth artifacts because the 14¬†6C, along with 
the other carbon isotopes in the atmosphere, reacts with oxygen to form carbon diox-
ide. A living plant consumes carbon dioxide in the photosynthesis process and incor-
porates the carbon, including 14¬†6C, into its molecules. As long as the plant lives, the  
14¬†6Cy12¬†6C¬†ratio in its molecules remains the same as in the atmosphere because of the 
continuous uptake of carbon. However, as soon as a tree is cut to make a wooden bowl 
or a flax plant is harvested to make linen, the 14¬†6Cy12¬†6C¬†ratio begins to decrease because 
of the radio active decay of 14¬†6C (the 12¬†6C nuclide is stable). Since the half-life of 14¬†6C is 
5730 years, a wooden bowl found in an archaeological dig showing a 14¬†6Cy12¬†6C¬† ratio 
that is half that found in currently living trees is approximately 5730 years old. This 
reasoning assumes that the current 14¬†6Cy12¬†6C¬† ratio is the same as that found in ancient 
times.
 
Dendrochronologists, scientists who date trees from annual growth rings, have used 
data collected from long-lived species of trees, such as bristlecone pines and sequoias, 
to show that the 14¬†6C content of the atmosphere has changed significantly over the ages. 
These data have been used to derive correction factors that allow very accurate dates 
to be determined from the observed 14¬†6Cy12¬†6C¬†ratio in an artifact, especially for artifacts 
10,000 years old or younger. Recent measurements of uranium-to-thorium ratios in

Radioactive nuclides are often called

dating.

ancient coral indicate that dates in the 20,000- to 30,000-year range may have errors as 
large as 3000 years. As a result, efforts are now being made to recalibrate the 14¬†6C dates 
over this period.
14C Dating
The remnants of an ancient fire in a cave in Africa showed a 14¬†6C decay rate of 3.1¬†counts 
per minute per gram of carbon. Assuming that the decay rate of 14¬†6C in freshly cut wood 
(corrected for changes in the 14¬†6C content of the atmosphere) is 13.6 counts per minute 
per gram of carbon, calculate the age of the remnants. The half-life of 14¬†6C is 5730 
years.
 
SOLUTION 
The key to solving this problem is to realize that the decay rates given are directly propor-
tional to the number of 14¬†6C nuclides present. Radioactive decay follows first-order 
kinetics:
Rate 5 kN
Thus
 
  Number of nuclides

‚ñ†  Solving this equation gives t 5 12,000 years; the campfire in the cave occurred 
about 12,000 years ago.
See Exercises 19.43 and 19.44
 
One drawback of radiocarbon dating is that a fairly large piece of the object (from 
a half to several grams) must be burned to form carbon dioxide, which is then analyzed 
for radioactivity. Another method for counting 14¬†6C nuclides avoids destruction of a 
significant portion of a valuable artifact. This technique, requiring only about 1023 g, 
uses a mass spectrometer (see Chapter 3), in which the carbon atoms are ionized and 
accelerated through a magnetic field that deflects their path. Because of their different 
masses, the various ions are deflected by different amounts and can be counted sepa-
rately. This allows a very accurate determination of the 14¬†6Cy12¬†6C¬†ratio in the sample.
 
In their attempts to establish the geologic history of the earth, geologists have made 
extensive use of radioactivity. For example, since 238
¬†92U decays to the stable 206
¬†82Pb

nuclide, the ratio of 206
¬†82Pb to 238
¬†92U in a rock can, under favorable circumstances, be used 
to  estimate the age of the rock. The radioactive nuclide 176
¬†71Lu, which decays to 176
¬†72Hf, 
has a half-life of 37 billion years (only 186 nuclides out of 10 trillion decay each 
year!). Thus this nuclide can be used to date very old rocks. With this technique, sci-
entists have estimated that the earth‚Äôs crust formed 4.3 billion years ago.
Dating by Radioactivity
A rock containing 238
¬†92U and 206
¬†82Pb was examined to determine its approximate age. 
Analysis showed the ratio of 206
¬†82Pb¬†atoms to 238
¬†92U atoms to be 0.115. Assuming that  
no lead was originally present, that all the 206
¬†82Pb formed over the years has remained  
in the rock, and that the number of nuclides in intermediate stages of decay between 
238
¬†92U¬†and¬† 206
¬†82Pb is negligible, calculate the age of the rock. The half-life of 238
¬†92U is 
4.5¬†3¬†109 years.

This problem can be solved using the integrated first-order rate law:
ln a N

where NyN0 represents the ratio of 238
¬†92U atoms now found in the rock to the number 
present when the rock was formed. We are assuming that each 206
¬†82Pb nuclide present 
must have come from decay of a 238
¬†92U atom:
238
¬†92U h 206
¬†82Pb
Thus

Medical Applications of Radioactivity
Although the rapid advances of the medical sciences in recent decades are due to many 
causes, one of the most important has been the discovery and use of radiotracers, 
 radioactive nuclides that can be introduced into organisms in food or drugs and whose 
pathways can be traced by monitoring their radioactivity. For example, the incorpora-
tion of nuclides such as 14¬†6C and 32
15P into nutrients has produced important information 
about metabolic pathways.
INTERACTIVE EXAMPLE 19.6
Because the half-life of 238
¬†92U is very 
long compared with those of the other 
members of the decay series (see 
Table¬†19.3) to reach 206
¬†82Pb, the number of 
nuclides present in intermediate stages 
of decay is negligible. That is, once a 238
¬†92U 
nuclide starts to decay, it reaches 206
¬†82Pb 
relatively fast.

Iodine-131 has proved very useful in the diagnosis and treatment of illnesses of the

 uptake of the iodine by the thyroid gland is monitored with a scanner (Fig. 19.8).
 
Thallium-201 can be used to assess the damage to the heart muscle in a person who 
has suffered a heart attack, because thallium is concentrated in healthy muscle tissue. 
 Technetium-99m is also taken up by normal heart tissue and is used for damage assess-
ment in a similar way.
 
Radiotracers provide sensitive and noninvasive methods for learning about biologi-
cal systems, for detection of disease, for monitoring the action and effectiveness of 
drugs, and for early detection of pregnancy, and their usefulness should continue to 
grow. Some useful radiotracers are listed in Table 19.5.
19.5 Thermodynamic Stability of the 
Nucleus
We can determine the thermodynamic stability of a nucleus by calculating the change 
in potential energy that would occur if that nucleus were formed from its constituent 
protons and neutrons. For example, let‚Äôs consider the hypothetical process of forming 
a 16¬†8O nucleus from eight neutrons and eight protons:
8 1

1H h 16¬†8O

The energy change associated with this process can be calculated by comparing the 
sum of the masses of eight protons and eight neutrons with that of the oxygen 
nucleus:
 Mass of 18 1
0n 1 8 1

Mass of 16
8O 2 mass of 18 1
0n 1 8 1
1H2 5 22.269 3 10225 g
The difference in mass for formation of 1 mole of 16¬†8O nuclei is therefore
122.269 3 10225 g/nucleus2 16.022 3 1023 nuclei/mol2 5 20.1366 g/mol
Thus 0.1366 g of mass would be lost if 1 mole of oxygen-16 were formed from protons 
and neutrons. What is the reason for this difference in mass, and how can this informa-
tion be used to calculate the energy change that accompanies this process?
 
The answers to these questions can be found in the work of Albert Einstein. As we 
discussed in Section 7.2, Einstein‚Äôs theory of relativity showed that energy should be 
considered a form of matter. His famous equation
E 5 mc2
where c is the speed of light, gives the relationship between a quantity of energy and 
its mass. When a system gains or loses energy, it also gains or loses a quantity of mass, 
given by Eyc2. Thus the mass of a nucleus is less than that of its component nucleons 
because the process is so exothermic.
 
Einstein‚Äôs equation in the form
Energy change 5 DE 5 Dmc2
where Dm is the change in mass, or the mass defect, can be used to calculate DE for 
the hypothetical formation of a nucleus from its component nucleons.
Nuclear Binding Energy I
Calculate the change in energy if 1 mole of 16¬†8O nuclei was formed from neutrons and 
protons.
 
SOLUTION 
We have already calculated that 0.1366 g of mass would be lost in the hypothetical process 
of assembling 1 mole of 16¬†8O nuclei from the component nucleons. We can calculate 
the change in energy for this process from
DE 5 Dmc2
where
c 5 3.00 3 108 m/s¬†¬†and¬†¬†Dm 5 20.1366 g/mol 5 21.366 3 1024  kg/mol
Thus
‚ñ† DE 5 121.366 3 1024 kg/mol2 13.00 3 108 m/s2 2 5 21.23 3 1013 J/mol
The negative sign for the DE value indicates that the process is exothermic. Energy, 
and thus mass, is lost from the system.
See Exercises 19.47 through 19.49
Energy is a form of matter.
The energy changes associated with 
normal chemical reactions are small 
enough that the corresponding mass 
changes are not detectable.

The energy changes observed for nuclear processes are extremely large compared 
with those observed for chemical and physical changes. Thus nuclear processes con-
stitute a potentially valuable energy resource.
 
The thermodynamic stability of a particular nucleus is normally represented as 
energy released per nucleon. To illustrate how this quantity is obtained, we will con-
tinue to consider 16¬†8O. First, we calculate DE per nucleus by dividing the molar value 
from Example 19.7 by Avogadro‚Äôs number:
DE per 16
8O nucleus 5
21.23 3 1013 J/mol
6.022 3 1023 nuclei/mol 5 22.04 3 10211 J/nucleus
In terms of a more convenient energy unit, a million electronvolts (MeV), where
 1 MeV 5 1.60 3 10213 J
 DE per 16
8O nucleus 5 122.04 3 10211 J/nucleus2 a
1 MeV
1.60 3 10213 Jb
 5 21.28 3 102 MeV/nucleus
 
Next, we can calculate the value of DE per nucleon by dividing by A, the sum of 
neutrons and protons:
 DE per nucleon for 16
8O 5 21.28 3 102 MeV/nucleus
16 nucleons/nucleus
 5 27.98 MeV/nucleon
This means that 7.98 MeV of energy per nucleon would be released if 16¬†8O were formed 
from neutrons and protons. The energy required to decompose this nucleus into its 
components has the same numeric value but a positive sign (since energy is required). 
This is called the binding energy per nucleon for 16¬†8O.
 
The values of the binding energy per nucleon for the various nuclides are shown in 
Fig. 19.9. Note that the most stable nuclei (those requiring the largest energy per 
nucleon to decompose the nucleus) occur at the top of the curve. The most stable 
nucleus known is 56
26Fe, which has a binding energy per nucleon of 8.79 MeV.

Nuclear Binding Energy II
Calculate the binding energy per nucleon for the 4
2He nucleus (atomic masses: 4
2He 5 
4.0026 amu; 1
1H 5 1.0078 amu).
 
SOLUTION 
First, we must calculate the mass defect (Dm) for 4
2He. Since atomic masses (which 
include the electrons) are given, we must decide how to account for the electron mass:
 4.0026 5 mass of  4
2He atom 5 mass of  4

  p 
 
Electron mass

 5 20.0304 u
Note that in this case the electron mass cancels out in taking the difference. This  
will always happen in this type of calculation if the atomic masses are used both for 
the nuclide of interest and for 1
1H. Thus 0.0304 of mass is lost per 4
2He nucleus formed.

19.6 Nuclear Fission and Nuclear 
Fusion
The graph shown in Fig. 19.9 has very important implications for the use of nuclear 
processes as sources of energy. Recall that energy is released, that is, DE is negative, 
when a process goes from a less stable to a more stable state. The higher a nuclide is 
on the curve, the more stable it is. This means that two types of nuclear processes will 
be exothermic (Fig. 19.10):
1.
Combining two light nuclei to form a heavier, more stable nucleus. This process 
is called fusion.
2.
Splitting a heavy nucleus into two nuclei with smaller mass numbers. This pro-
cess is called fission.
Because of the large binding energies involved in holding the nucleus together, both of 
these processes involve energy changes more than a million times larger than those 
associated with chemical reactions.
Nuclear Fission
Nuclear fission was discovered in the late 1930s when 235
¬†92U nuclides bombarded with 
neutrons were observed to split into two lighter elements:
1
0n 1 235
92U h
141
56Ba 1 92
36Kr 1 3 1
0n
This process, shown schematically in Fig. 19.11, releases 3.5 3 10211 J of energy per 
event, which translates to 2.1 3 1013 J per mole of 235
¬†92U. Compare this figure with that 
for the combustion of methane, which releases only 8.0 3 105 J of energy per mole. 
The fission of 235
¬†92U produces about 26 million times more energy than the combustion 
of methane.
 
The process shown in Fig. 19.11 is only one of the many fission reactions that 235
¬†92U 
can undergo. Another is
1
0n 1 235
92U h 137
52Te 1 97
40Zr 1 2 1
0n
In fact, over 200 different isotopes of 35 different elements have been observed among 
the fission products of 235
¬†92U.
 
In addition to the product nuclides, neutrons are produced in the fission reactions of 
235
¬†92U. This makes it possible to have a self-sustaining fission process‚Äîa chain reac-
tion (Fig. 19.12). For the fission process to be self-sustaining, at least one neutron 
from each fission event must go on to split another nucleus. If, on average, less than 
one neutron causes another fission event, the process dies out and the reaction is said

to be subcritical. If exactly one neutron from each fission event causes another fission 
event, the process sustains itself at the same level and is said to be critical. If more 
than one neutron from each fission event causes another fission event, the process 
rapidly escalates and the heat buildup causes a violent explosion. This situation is 
described as supercritical.
 
To achieve the critical state, a certain mass of fissionable material, called the critical 
mass, is needed. If the sample is too small, too many neutrons escape before they have 
a chance to cause a fission event, and the process stops. This is illustrated in Fig.¬†19.13.
 
During World War II, an intense research effort called the Manhattan Project was 
carried out by the United States to build a bomb based on the principles of nuclear fis-
sion. This program produced the fission bombs that were used with devastating effects

on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Basically, a fission bomb operates by 
suddenly combining subcritical masses of fissionable material to form a supercritical 
mass, thereby producing an explosion of incredible intensity.
Nuclear Reactors
Because of the tremendous energies involved, it seemed desirable to develop the fis-
sion process as an energy source to produce electricity. To accomplish this, reactors 
were designed in which controlled fission can occur. The resulting energy is used to 
heat water to produce steam to run turbine generators, in much the same way that a 
coal-burning power plant generates energy. A schematic diagram of a nuclear power 
plant is shown in Fig. 19.14.
 
In the reactor core, shown in Fig. 19.15, uranium that has been enriched to approx-
imately 3% 235
¬†92U (natural uranium contains only 0.7% 235
¬†92U) is housed in cylinders. A 
moderator surrounds the cylinders to slow down the neutrons so that the uranium fuel 
can capture them more efficiently. Control rods, composed of substances that absorb 
neutrons, are used to regulate the power level of the reactor. The reactor is designed so 
that should a malfunction occur, the control rods are automatically inserted into the 
core to stop the reaction. A liquid (usually water) is circulated through the core to 
extract the heat generated by the energy of fission; the energy can then be passed on 
via a heat exchanger to water in the turbine system.
 
Although the concentration of 235
¬†92U in the fuel elements is not great enough to allow 
a supercritical mass to develop in the core, a failure of the cooling system can lead to 
temperatures high enough to melt the core. As a result, the building housing the core 
must be designed to contain the core even if meltdown occurs. A great deal of contro-
versy now exists about the efficiency of the safety systems in nuclear power plants. 
Accidents such as the one at the Three Mile Island facility in Pennsylvania in 1979 and 
in Chernobyl,* Ukraine, in 1986 have led to questions about the wisdom of continuing 
to build fission-based power plants.

Breeder Reactors
One potential problem facing the nuclear power industry is the supply of 235
¬†92U. Some 
 scientists have suggested that we have nearly depleted those uranium deposits rich 
enough in 235
¬†92U to make production of fissionable fuel economically feasible. Because 
of this possibility, breeder reactors have been developed, in which fissionable fuel is 
actually  produced while the reactor runs. In the breeder reactors now being studied, the 
major component of natural uranium, nonfissionable 238
¬†92U, is changed to fissionable 
239
¬†94Pu. The reaction involves absorption of a neutron, followed by production of two  
b particles:

92U h 239
93Np 1

21e
 239
93Np h 239
94Pu 1

21e
As the reactor runs and 235
¬†92U is split, some of the excess neutrons are absorbed by 238
¬†92U 
to produce 239
¬†94Pu. The 239
¬†94Pu is then separated out and used to fuel another reactor. Such 
a reactor thus ‚Äúbreeds‚Äù nuclear fuel as it operates.
 
Although breeder reactors are now used in France, the United States is proceeding 
slowly with their development because of their controversial nature. One problem 
involves the hazards in handling plutonium, which flames on contact with air and is 
very toxic.
Fusion
Large quantities of energy are also produced by the fusion of two light nuclei. In fact, 
stars produce their energy through nuclear fusion. Our sun, which presently consists of 
73% hydrogen, 26% helium, and 1% other elements, gives off vast quantities of energy 
from the fusion of protons to form helium:

1H 1 1

Intense research is under way to develop a feasible fusion process because of 
the ready availability of many light nuclides (deuterium, 2
1H, in seawater, for 
example) that can serve as fuel in fusion reactors. The major stumbling block is 
that high temperatures are required to initiate fusion. The forces that bind nucleons 
together to form a nucleus are effective only at very small distances (,10213 cm). 
Thus, for two protons to bind together and thereby release energy, they must get 
very close together. But protons, because they are identically charged, repel each 
other electrostatically. This means that to get two protons (or two deuterons) close 
enough to bind together (the nuclear binding force is not electrostatic), they must 
be ‚Äúshot‚Äù at each other at speeds high enough to overcome the electrostatic 
repulsion.
 
The electrostatic repulsion forces between two 2
1H nuclei are so great that a 
temperature of 4 3 107 K is required to give them velocities large enough to  
cause them to collide with sufficient energy that the nuclear forces can bind the 
particles together and thus release the binding energy. This situation is represented 
in Fig.¬†19.16.

the nuclear binding forces to become 
effective, thus ‚Äúfusing‚Äù the particles into a 
new nucleus and releasing large quanti-
ties of energy. The binding force is at least 
100 times the electrostatic repulsion.

Currently, scientists are studying two types of systems to produce the extremely 
high temperatures required: high-powered lasers and heating by electric currents. At 
present, many technical problems remain to be solved, and it is not clear which method 
will prove more useful or when fusion might become a practical energy source. How-
ever, there is still hope that fusion will be a major energy source sometime in the 
future.
CRITICAL THINKING Nuclear fission processes can provide a lot 
of energy, but they also can be dangerous. What if Congress decided to outlaw 
all processes that involve fission? How would that change our society?
19.7 Effects of Radiation
Everyone knows that being hit by a train is very serious. The problem is the energy 
transfer involved. In fact, any source of energy is potentially harmful to organisms. 
Energy transferred to cells can break chemical bonds and cause malfunctioning of 
the cell systems. This fact is behind the concern about the ozone layer in the earth‚Äôs 
upper atmosphere, which screens out high-energy ultraviolet radiation from the sun. 
Radioactive  elements, which are sources of high-energy particles, are also poten-
tially hazardous, although the effects are usually quite subtle. The reason for the 
subtlety of radiation damage is that even though high-energy particles are involved, 
the quantity of energy actually deposited in tissues per event is quite small. How-
ever, the resulting damage is no less real, although the effects may not be apparent 
for years.
Radiation damage to organisms can be classified as somatic or genetic damage. 
Somatic damage is damage to the organism itself, resulting in sickness or death. The 
effects may appear almost immediately if a massive dose of radiation is received; for 
smaller doses, damage may appear years later, usually in the form of cancer. Genetic 
damage is damage to the genetic machinery, which produces malfunctions in the off-
spring of the organism.
The biological effects of a particular source of radiation depend on several factors:
1.
The energy of the radiation. The higher the energy content of the radiation, the 
more damage it can cause. Radiation doses are measured in rads (which is short 
for radiation absorbed dose), where 1 rad corresponds to 1022 J of energy depos-
ited per kilogram of tissue.
2. The penetrating ability of the radiation. The particles and rays produced in radio-
active processes vary in their abilities to penetrate human tissue: g rays are highly 
penetrating, b particles can penetrate approximately 1 cm, and a particles are 
stopped by the skin.
3. The ionizing ability of the radiation. Extraction of electrons from biomolecules 
to form ions is particularly detrimental to their functions. The ionizing ability of 
radiation varies dramatically. For example, g rays penetrate very deeply but 
cause only occasional ionization. On the other hand, a particles, although not 
very penetrating, are very effective at causing ionization and produce a dense 
trail of damage. Thus ingestion of an a-particle producer, such as plutonium, is 
particularly damaging.
4. The chemical properties of the radiation source. When a radioactive nuclide is 
ingested into the body, its effectiveness in causing damage depends on its resi-
dence time. For example, 85
36Kr and 90
38Sr are both b-particle producers. However, 
since krypton is chemically inert, it passes through the body quickly and does not 
have much time to do damage. Strontium, being chemically similar to calcium, 
can collect in bones, where it may cause leukemia and bone cancer.

Section 20.11.

Because of the differences in the behavior of the particles and rays produced by 
 radioactive decay, both the energy dose of the radiation and its effectiveness in causing 
biological damage must be taken into account. The rem (which is short for roentgen 
 equivalent for man) is defined as follows:
Number of rems 5 1number of rads2 3 RBE
where RBE represents the relative effectiveness of the radiation in causing biological 
damage.
 
Table 19.6 shows the physical effects of short-term exposure to various doses of 
radiation, and Table 19.7 gives the sources and amounts of radiation exposure for a 
typical person in the United States. Note that natural sources contribute about twice as 
much as human activities to the total exposure. However, although the nuclear industry 
contributes only a small percentage of the total exposure, the major controversy asso-
ciated with nuclear power plants is the potential for radiation hazards. These arise 
mainly from two sources: accidents allowing the release of radioactive materials and 
improper disposal of the radioactive products in spent fuel elements. The radioactive 
products of the fission of 235
¬†92U, although only a small percentage of the total products, 
have half-lives of several hundred years and remain dangerous for a long time. Various 
schemes have been advanced for the disposal of these wastes. The one that seems to 
hold the most promise is the incorporation of the wastes into ceramic blocks and the 
burial of these blocks in geologically stable formations. At present, however, no dis-
posal method has been accepted, and nuclear wastes continue to accumulate in tempo-
rary storage facilities.
 
Even if a satisfactory method for permanent disposal of nuclear wastes is found, 
there will continue to be concern about the effects of exposure to low levels of radia-
tion. Exposure is inevitable from natural sources such as cosmic rays and radioactive 
minerals, and many people are also exposed to low levels of radiation from reactors, 
radioactive tracers, or diagnostic X rays. Currently, we have little reliable information 
on the long-term effects of low-level exposure to radiation.
 
Two models of radiation damage, illustrated in Fig. 19.17, have been proposed: the 
linear model and the threshold model. The linear model postulates that damage from

radiation is proportional to the dose, even at low levels of exposure. Thus any exposure 
is dangerous. The threshold model, on the other hand, assumes that no significant dam-
age occurs below a certain exposure, called the threshold exposure. Note that if the 
linear model is correct, radiation exposure should be limited to a bare minimum (ide-
ally at the natural levels). If the threshold model is correct, a certain level of radiation 
exposure beyond natural levels can be tolerated. Most scientists feel that since there is 
little evidence available to evaluate these models, it is safest to assume that the linear 
hypothesis is correct and to minimize radiation exposure.

numbers of neutrons and protons. What happens to the 
neutron-to-proton ratio for stable nuclides as the num-
ber of protons increases? Nuclides that are not already 
in the zone of stability undergo radioactive processes to

depend on several  factors. List some of these factors. 
Even though 85Kr and 90Sr are both b-particle emitters, 
the dangers associated with the decay of 90Sr are much 
greater than those linked to 85Kr. Why? Although g rays 
are far more penetrating than a particles, the latter are 
more likely to cause damage to an organism. Why? 
Which type of radiation is more effective at promoting 
the ionization of biomolecules?
 8. Define fission and fusion. How does the energy associ-
ated with fission or fusion processes compare to the 
energy changes associated with chemical reactions? 
Fusion processes are more likely to occur for lighter 
elements, whereas fission processes are more likely to 
occur for heavier elements. Why? (Hint: Refer to Fig. 
19.10.) The major stumbling block for turning fusion 
reactions into a feasible source of power is the high tem-

 7. What are transuranium elements and how are they 
synthesized?
 8. Scientists have estimated that the earth‚Äôs crust was formed  
4.3 billion years ago. The radioactive nuclide 176Lu, which 
decays to 176Hf, was used to estimate this age. The half-life of 
176Lu is 37 billion years. How are ratios of 176Lu to 176Hf uti-
lized to date very old rocks?
 9. Why are the observed energy changes for nuclear processes so 
much larger than the energy changes for chemical and physi-
cal processes?
 10. Natural uranium is mostly nonfissionable 238U; it contains 
only about 0.7% of fissionable 235U. For uranium to be useful 
as a nuclear fuel, the relative amount of 235U must be increased 
to about 3%. This is accomplished through a gas diffusion pro-
cess. In the diffusion process, natural uranium reacts with flu-
orine to form a mixture of 238UF6(g) and 235UF6(g). The 
fluoride mixture is then enriched through a multistage diffu-
sion process to produce a 3% 235U nuclear fuel. The diffusion 
process utilizes Graham‚Äôs law of effusion (see Chapter 5, Sec-
tion 5.7). Explain how Graham‚Äôs law of effusion allows natu-
ral uranium to be enriched by the gaseous diffusion process.
 11. Much of the research on controlled fusion focuses on the prob-
lem of how to contain the reacting material. Magnetic fields 
appear to be the most promising mode of containment. Why is 
containment such a problem? Why must one resort to mag-
netic fields for containment?
 12. Describe the relative penetrating powers of alpha, beta, and 
gamma radiation.
 13. Explain the difference between somatic damage from radia-
tion and genetic damage. Which type causes immediate dam-
age to the exposed individual?
 14. A recent study concluded that any amount of radiation expo-
sure can cause biological damage. Explain the differences 
between the two models of radiation damage, the linear model 
and the threshold model.

 73. During World War II, tritium (3H) was a component of fluores-
cent watch dials and hands. Assume you have such a watch 
that was made in January 1944. If 17% or more of the original 
tritium was needed to read the dial in dark places, until what 
year could you read the time at night? (For 3H, t1y2 5 12.3 yr.)
 74. A positron and an electron can annihilate each other on collid-
ing, producing energy as photons:

Assuming that both g rays have the same energy, calculate the 
wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation produced.
 75. A small atomic bomb releases energy equivalent to the deto-
nation of 20,000 tons of TNT; a ton of TNT releases 4 3 109 J 
of energy when exploded. Using 2 3 1013 J/mol as the energy 
released by fission of 235U, approximately what mass of 235U 
undergoes fission in this atomic bomb?
 76. During the research that led to production of the two atomic 
bombs used against Japan in World War II, different mecha-
nisms for obtaining a supercritical mass of fissionable material 
were investigated. In one type of bomb, a ‚Äúgun‚Äù shot one piece 
of  fissionable material into a cavity containing another piece 
of fissionable material. In the second type of bomb, the fis-
sionable material was surrounded with a high explosive that, 
when detonated, compressed the fissionable material into a 
smaller volume. Discuss what is meant by critical mass, and 
explain why the ability to achieve a critical mass is essential to 
sustaining a nuclear reaction.
 77. Using the kinetic molecular theory (see Section 5.6), calculate 
the root mean square velocity and the average kinetic energy 
of 2
1H nuclei at a temperature of 4 3 107 K. (See Exercise¬†56 
for the appropriate mass values.)
 78. Consider the following reaction, which can take place in par-
ticle accelerators:
1
1H 1 1
0n h 2 1

Calculate the energy change for this reaction. Is energy 
released or absorbed? What is a possible source for this 
energy?
 79. Photosynthesis in plants can be represented by the following 
overall equation:
6CO21 g2 1 6H2O1 l 2 h
Light
C6H12O61s2 1 6O21 g2
Algae grown in water containing some 18O (in H218O) evolve 
oxygen gas with the same isotopic composition as the oxygen 
in the water. When algae growing in water containing only 16O 
were  furnished carbon dioxide containing 18O, no 18O was 
found to be evolved from the oxygen gas produced. What con-
clusions about photosynthesis can be drawn from these 
experiments?
 80. Strontium-90 and radon-222 both pose serious health risks. 
90Sr decays by b-particle production and has a relatively long 
half-life (28.9 years). Radon-222 decays by a-particle produc-
tion and has a relatively short half-life (3.82 days). Explain 
why each decay process poses health risks.

These multiconcept problems (and additional ones) are found 
interactively online with the same type of assistance a student 
would get from an instructor.

Assume that no 87Sr was present when the rock was formed. 
The atomic masses for 87Rb and 87Sr are 86.90919 u and

Challenge Problems
 87. Naturally occurring uranium is composed mostly of 238U and 
235U, with relative abundances of 99.28% and 0.72%, respec-
tively. The half-life for 238U is 4.5 3 109 years, and the half-
life for 235U is 7.1 3 108 years. Assuming that the earth was 
formed 4.5 billion years ago, calculate the relative abundances 
of the 238U and 235U isotopes when the earth was formed.
 88. The curie (Ci) is a commonly used unit for measuring nuclear 
radioactivity: 1 curie of radiation is equal to 3.7 3 1010 decay 
events per second (the number of decay events from 1 g 
radium in 1 s). A 1.7-mL sample of water containing tritium 
was injected into a 150-lb person. The total activity of radia-
tion injected was 86.5 mCi. After some time to allow the tri-
tium activity to equally distribute throughout the body, a 
sample of blood plasma  containing 2.0 mL water at an activity 
of 3.6 mCi was removed. From these data, calculate the mass 
percent of water in this 150-lb person.
 89. A 0.10-cm3 sample of a solution containing a radioactive 
nuclide (5.0 3 103 counts per minute per milliliter) is injected 
into a rat. Several minutes later 1.0 cm3 of blood is removed. 
The blood shows 48 counts per minute of radioactivity. Calcu-
late the volume of blood in the rat. What assumptions must be 
made in performing this calculation?
 90. Zirconium is one of the few metals that retains its structural 
integrity upon exposure to radiation. The fuel rods in most 
nuclear reactors therefore are often made of zirconium. 
Answer the following questions about the redox properties of 
zirconium based on the half-reaction
ZrO2 # H2O 1 H2O 1 4e2 h Zr 1 4OH2¬†¬†%¬∞ 5 22.36 V
a. Is zirconium metal capable of reducing water to form 
hydrogen gas at standard conditions?
b. Write a balanced equation for the reduction of water by 
zirconium.
c. Calculate %¬∞, DG8, and K for the reduction of water by 
zirconium metal.
d. The reduction of water by zirconium occurred during the 
accidents at Three Mile Island in 1979. The hydrogen 
produced was successfully vented and no chemical explo-
sion occurred. If 1.00 3 103 kg Zr reacts, what mass of H2 
is produced? What volume of H2 at 1.0 atm and 1000.8C 
is produced?
e. At Chernobyl in 1986, hydrogen was produced by the 
reaction of superheated steam with the graphite reactor 
core:
C1s2 1 H2O1 g2 h CO1 g2 1 H21 g2
It was not possible to prevent a chemical explosion at Cher-
nobyl. In light of this, do you think it was a correct decision to 
vent the hydrogen and other radioactive gases into the atmo-
sphere at Three Mile Island? Explain.

cess called the carbon‚Äìnitrogen cycle occurs in the sun:

nuclei in the overall reaction? (The atomic masses of 1
1H 
and 4
2He are 1.00782 u and 4.00260 u, respectively.)
 92. The most significant source of natural radiation is radon-222. 
222Rn, a decay product of 238U, is continuously generated in 
the earth‚Äôs crust, allowing gaseous Rn to seep into the base-
ments of buildings. Because 222Rn is an a-particle producer 
with a relatively short half-life of 3.82 days, it can cause bio-
logical damage when inhaled.
a. How many a particles and b particles are produced when 
238U decays to 222Rn? What nuclei are produced when 
222Rn decays?
b. Radon is a noble gas so one would expect it to pass 
through the body quickly. Why is there a concern over 
inhaling 222Rn?
c. Another problem associated with 222Rn is that the decay 
of 222Rn produces a more potent a-particle producer  
(t1y2 5 3.11 min) that is a solid. What is the identity of the 
solid? Give the balanced equation of this species decaying 
by a-particle production. Why is the solid a more potent  
a-particle producer?
d. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recom-
mends that 222Rn levels not exceed 4 pCi per liter of air  
(1 Ci 5 1 curie 5 3.7 3 1010 decay events per second;  
1 pCi 5 1 3 10212 Ci). Convert 4.0 pCi per liter of air 
into concentrations units of 222Rn atoms per liter of air 
and moles of 222Rn per liter of air.
 93. To determine the Ksp value of Hg2I2, a chemist obtained a solid 
sample of Hg2I2 in which some of the iodine is present as 
radioactive 131I. The count rate of the Hg2I2 sample is 
5.0¬†3¬†1011 counts per minute per mole of I. An excess amount 
of Hg2I2(s) is placed into some water, and the solid is allowed 
to come to equilibrium with its respective ions. A 150.0-mL 
sample of the saturated solution is withdrawn and the radioac-
tivity measured at 33 counts per minute. From this informa-
tion, calculate the Ksp value for Hg2I2.

 94. Estimate the temperature needed to achieve the fusion of deu-
terium to make an a particle. The energy required can be 
 estimated from Coulomb‚Äôs law [use the form E 5 9.0 3 109 
(Q1Q2yr), using Q 5 1.6 3 10219 C for a proton, and r 5 2 3 
10215 m for the helium nucleus; the unit for the proportionality 
constant in Coloumb‚Äôs law is J ? myC2].

 96. Radioactive cobalt-60 is used to study defects in vitamin B12 
absorption because cobalt is the metallic atom at the center of 
the vitamin B12 molecule. The nuclear synthesis of this cobalt 
isotope involves a three-step process. The overall reaction is 
iron-58 reacting with two neutrons to produce cobalt-60 along 
with the emission of another particle. What particle is emitted 
in this nuclear synthesis? What is the binding energy in J per 
nucleon for the cobalt-60 nucleus (atomic masses: 60Co 5 
59.9338 u; 1H 5 1.00782 u)? What is the de Broglie wave-
length of the emitted particle if it has a velocity equal to 0.90c, 
where c is the speed of light?
Integrative Problems
These problems require the integration of multiple concepts to find 
the solutions.
 95. A reported synthesis of the transuranium element bohr ium 
(Bh) involved the bombardment of berkelium-249 with neon-
22 to produce bohrium-267. Write a nuclear reaction for this 
synthesis. The half-life of bohrium-267 is 15.0 seconds. If 199 
atoms of bohrium-267 could be synthesized, how much time 
would elapse before only 11 atoms of bohrium-267 remain? 
What is the expected electron configuration of elemental 
bohrium?

S
o far in this book we have covered the major principles and explored the most 
important models of chemistry. In particular, we have seen that the chemical 
properties of the elements can be explained very successfully by the quantum mechan-
ical model of the atom. In fact, the most convincing evidence of that model‚Äôs validity 
is its ability to relate the observed periodic properties of the elements to the number of 
valence electrons in their atoms.
We have learned many properties of the elements and their compounds, but we have 
not discussed extensively the relationship between the chemical properties of a spe-
cific element and its position on the periodic table. In this chapter we will explore the 
chemical similarities and differences among the elements in the several groups of the 
periodic table and will try to interpret these data using the wave mechanical model of 
the atom. In the process we will illustrate a great variety of chemical properties and 
further demonstrate the practical importance of chemistry.
20.1 A Survey of the Representative 
Elements
The traditional form of the periodic table is shown in Fig. 20.1. Recall that the repre-
sentative elements, whose chemical properties are determined by the valence-level s 
and p electrons, are designated Groups 1A through 8A. The transition metals, in the 
center of the table, result from the filling of d orbitals. The elements that correspond to 
the filling of the 4f and 5f orbitals are listed separately as the lanthanides and actinides, 
respectively.
The heavy black line in Fig. 20.1 separates the metals from the nonmetals. Some 
elements just on either side of this line, such as silicon and germanium, exhibit both 
metallic and nonmetallic properties. These elements are often called metalloids, or 
semimetals. The fundamental chemical difference between metals and nonmetals is 
that metals tend to lose their valence electrons to form cations, which usually have the 
valence electron configuration of the noble gas from the preceding period. On the other 
hand, nonmetals tend to gain electrons to form anions that exhibit the electron configu-
ration of the noble gas in the same period. Metallic character is observed to increase in 
going down a given group, which is consistent with the trends in ionization energy, 
electron affinity, and electronegativity discussed earlier (see Sections 7.12 and 8.2).
Atomic Size and Group Anomalies
Although the chemical properties of the members of a group have many similarities, 
there are also important differences. The most dramatic differences usually occur 
between the first and second member. For example, hydrogen in Group 1A is a non-
metal, whereas lithium is a very active metal. This extreme difference results primarily 
from the very large difference in the atomic radii of hydrogen and lithium, as shown in  
Fig. 20.2. Since the small hydrogen atom has a much greater attraction for electrons 
than do the larger members of Group 1A, it forms covalent bonds with nonmetals. In 
contrast, the other members of Group 1A lose their valence electrons to nonmetals to 
form 11 cations in ionic compounds.
 
The effect of size is also evident in other groups. For example, the oxides of the 
metals in Group 2A are all quite basic except for the first member of the series; beryl-
lium oxide (BeO) is amphoteric. The basicity of an oxide depends on its ionic charac-
ter. Ionic oxides contain the O22 ion, which reacts with water to form two OH2 ions. 
All the oxides of the Group 2A metals are highly ionic except for beryllium oxide, 
which has considerable covalent character. The small Be21 ion can effectively polarize 
the electron ‚Äúcloud‚Äù of the O22 ion, thereby producing significant electron sharing. We 
see the same pattern in Group 3A, where only the small boron atom behaves as a 
20.1
Metallic character increases going down a 
group in the periodic table.

nonmetal, or sometimes as a semimetal, whereas aluminum and the other members are 
active metals.
 
In Group 4A the effect of size is reflected in the dramatic differences between the 
chemical properties of carbon and silicon. The chemistry of carbon is dominated by 
molecules containing chains of CiC bonds, but silicon compounds mainly contain 
SiiO bonds rather than SiiSi bonds. Silicon does form compounds with chains of 
SiiSi bonds, but these compounds are much more reactive than the corresponding 
carbon  compounds. The reasons for the difference in reactivity between the carbon and 
silicon compounds are quite complex but are likely related to the differences in the 
sizes of the carbon and silicon atoms.
 
Carbon and silicon also differ markedly in their abilities to form p bonds. As we 
discussed in Section 9.1, carbon dioxide is composed of discrete CO2 molecules with 
the Lewis structure

where the carbon and oxygen atoms achieve the [Ne] configuration by forming p 
bonds. In contrast, the structure of silica (empirical formula SiO2) is based on SiO4 
tetrahedra with SiiOiSi bridges, as shown in Fig. 20.3. The silicon 3p valence

bonds; therefore, discrete SiO2 molecules with the Lewis structure

are not stable. Instead, the silicon atoms achieve a noble gas configuration by forming 
four SiiO single bonds.
 
The importance of p bonding for the relatively small elements of the second period 
also explains the different elemental forms of the members of Groups 5A and 6A. For 
example, elemental nitrogen exists as very stable N2 molecules with the Lewis struc-
ture : N{N :. Elemental phosphorus forms larger aggregates of atoms, the simplest 
being the tetrahedral P4 molecules found in white phosphorus (see Fig. 20.18). Like 
silicon atoms, the relatively large phosphorus atoms do not form strong p bonds but 
prefer to achieve a noble gas configuration by forming single bonds to several other 
phosphorus atoms. In contrast, its very strong p bonds make the N2 molecule the most 
stable form of elemental nitrogen. Similarly, in Group 6A the most stable form of 
elemental oxygen is the O2 molecule with a double bond. However, the larger sulfur 
atom forms bigger aggregates, such as the cyclic S8 molecule (see Fig. 20.22), which 
contain only single bonds.
 
The relatively large change in size in going from the first to the second member of 
a group also has important consequences for the Group 7A elements. For example,

 fluorine has a smaller electron affinity than chlorine. This violation of the expected 
trend can be attributed to the fact that the small size of the fluorine 2p orbitals causes 
unusually large electron‚Äìelectron repulsions. The relative weakness of the bond in the 
F2 molecule can be explained in terms of the repulsions among the lone pairs, shown 
in the Lewis structure:
F
F
The small size of the fluorine atoms allows close approach of the lone pairs, which 
leads to much greater repulsions than those found in the Cl2 molecule with its much 
larger atoms.
 
Thus the relatively large increase in atomic radius in going from the first to the 
second member of a group causes the first element to exhibit properties quite different 
from the others.
Abundance and Preparation
Table 20.1 shows the distribution of elements in the earth‚Äôs crust, oceans, and atmo-
sphere. The major element is, of course, oxygen, which is found in the atmosphere as 
O2, in the oceans as H2O, and in the earth‚Äôs crust primarily in silicate and carbonate 
minerals. The second most abundant element, silicon, is found throughout the earth‚Äôs 
crust in the silica and silicate minerals that form the basis of most sand, rocks, and soil. 
The most abundant metals, aluminum and iron, are found in ores, in which they are 
combined with nonmetals, most commonly oxygen. One notable fact revealed by 
Table 20.1 is the small incidence of most transition metals. Since many of these rela-
tively rare elements are assuming  increasing importance in our high-technology soci-
ety, it is possible that the control of transition metal ores may ultimately have more 
significance in world politics than will control of petroleum supplies.
 
The distribution of elements in living materials is very different from that found in 
the earth‚Äôs crust. Table 20.2 shows the distribution of elements in the human body. 
Oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen form the basis for all biologically important 
molecules. The other elements, even though they are found in relatively small amounts, 
are often crucial for life. For example, zinc is found in over 150 different biomolecules 
in the human body.
 
Only about one-fourth of the elements occur naturally in the free state. Most are 
found in a combined state. The process of obtaining a metal from its ore is called met-
allurgy. Since the metals in ores are found in the form of cations, the chemistry of 
metallurgy always involves reduction of the ions to the elemental metal (with an oxida-
tion state of zero). A variety of reducing agents can be used, but carbon is the usual 
choice because of its wide availability and relatively low cost.
Carbon is the cheapest and most readily 
available industrial reducing agent for 
metallic ions.

Electrolysis is often used to reduce the most active metals. In Chapter 18 we con-
sidered the electrolytic production of aluminum metal. The alkali metals are also pro-
duced by electrolysis, usually of their molten halide salts.
 
The preparation of nonmetals varies widely. Elemental nitrogen and oxygen are 
usually obtained from the liquefaction of air, which is based on the principle that a gas 
cools as it expands. After each expansion, part of the cooler gas is compressed, whereas 
the rest is used to carry away the heat of the compression. The compressed gas is then 
allowed to expand again. This cycle is repeated many times. Eventually, the remaining 
gas becomes cold enough to form the liquid state. Because liquid nitrogen and liquid 
oxygen have different boiling points, they can be separated by the distillation of liquid 
air. Both substances are important industrial chemicals, with nitrogen ranking second 
in terms of amount manufactured in the United States (approximately 60 billion 
pounds per year) and oxygen ranking third (over 40 billion pounds per year). Hydro-
gen can be obtained from the electrolysis of water, but more commonly it is obtained 
from the decomposition of the methane in natural gas. Sulfur is found underground in 
its elemental form and is recovered by the Frasch process (see Section 20.12). The 
halogens are obtained by oxidation of the anions from halide salts (see Section 20.13).
The preparation of sulfur and the halogens 
is discussed later in this chapter.

20.2 The Group 1A Elements
The Group 1A elements with their ns1 valence electron configurations are all very 
active metals (they lose their valence electrons very readily), except for hydrogen, 
which behaves as a nonmetal. We will discuss the chemistry of hydrogen in the next 
section. Many of the properties of the alkali metals have been given previously (see 
Section 7.13). The sources and methods of preparation of pure alkali metals are given 
in Table 20.3. The ionization energies, standard reduction potentials, ionic radii, and 
melting points for the alkali metals are listed in Table 20.4.
 
In Section 7.13 we saw that the alkali metals all react vigorously with water to 
release hydrogen gas:
2M1s2 1 2H2O1 l 2 h 2M11aq2 1 2OH21aq2 1 H21 g2
We will reconsider this process briefly because it illustrates several important con-
cepts. From the ionization energies, we might expect lithium to be the weakest of the 
alkali metals as a reducing agent in water. However, the standard reduction potentials 
indicate that it is the strongest. This reversal results mainly from the very large energy 
of hydration of the small Li1 ion. Because of its relatively high charge density, the Li1
ion very effectively attracts water molecules. A large quantity of energy is released in 
the process,  favoring the formation of the Li1 ion and making lithium a strong reduc-
ing agent in aqueous solution.
 
We also saw in Section 7.13 that lithium, although it is the strongest reducing agent, 
reacts more slowly with water than sodium or potassium. From the discussions in 
Chapters 12 and 17, we know that the equilibrium position for a reaction (in this case 
indicated by the %¬∞ values) is controlled by thermodynamic factors but that the rate of 
a reaction is controlled by kinetic factors. There is no direct connection between these 
factors. Lithium reacts more slowly with water than sodium or potassium because as a 
solid lithium has a higher melting point than either of the other elements. Since lithium

does not become molten from the heat of reaction with water as sodium and potassium 
do, it has a smaller area of contact with the water.
Table 20.5 summarizes some important reactions of the alkali metals.
The alkali metal ions are very important for the proper functioning of biological 
systems such as nerves and muscles; Na1 and K1 ions are present in all body cells and 
fluids. In human blood plasma, the concentrations are
3Na14 < 0.15 M¬†¬†¬†¬†and¬†¬†¬†¬†3K14 < 0.005 M
In the fluids inside the cells, the concentrations are reversed:
3Na14 < 0.005 M¬†¬†¬†¬†and¬†¬†¬†¬†3K14 < 0.16 M
Since the concentrations are so different inside and outside the cells, an elaborate 
mechanism involving selective ligands is needed to transport Na1 and K1 ions through 
the cell membranes.
 
20.3 The Chemistry of Hydrogen
Under ordinary conditions of temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odor-
less gas composed of H2 molecules. Because of its low molar mass and nonpolarity, 
hydrogen has a very low boiling point (22538C) and melting point (22608C). Hydro-
gen gas is highly flammable; mixtures of air containing from 18% to 60% hydrogen by 
volume are explosive. In a common lecture demonstration, hydrogen and oxygen 
gases are bubbled into soapy water. The resulting bubbles are then ignited with a can-
dle on a long stick, producing a loud explosion.
 
The major industrial source of hydrogen gas is the reaction of methane with water 
at high temperatures (800‚Äì10008C) and pressures (10‚Äì50 atm) in the presence of a 
metallic catalyst (often nickel):
CH41 g2 1 H2O1 g2  8888888n CO1 g2 1 3H21 g2
Large quantities of hydrogen are also formed as a by-product of gasoline production, 
when hydrocarbons with high molecular masses are broken down (or cracked) to pro-
duce smaller molecules more suitable for use as a motor fuel.
 
Very pure hydrogen can be produced by the electrolysis of water (see Section 18.7), 
but this method currently is not economically feasible for large-scale production 
because of the relatively high cost of electricity.
 
The major industrial use of hydrogen is in the production of ammonia by the Haber 
process. Large quantities of hydrogen are also used for hydrogenating unsaturated

Chemically, hydrogen behaves as a typical nonmetal, forming covalent compounds 
with other nonmetals and forming salts with very active metals. Binary compounds 
containing hydrogen are called hydrides, of which there are three classes. The ionic 
(or saltlike) hydrides are formed when hydrogen combines with the most active met-
als, those from Groups 1A and 2A. Examples are LiH and CaH2, which can best be 
characterized as containing hydride ions (H2) and metal cations. Because the presence 
of two electrons in the small 1s orbital produces large electron‚Äìelectron repulsions 
and because the nucleus has only a 11 charge, the hydride ion is a strong reducing 
agent. For example, when ionic hydrides are placed in water, a violent reaction takes 
place. This reaction results in the formation of hydrogen gas, as seen in the equation
LiH1s2 1 H2O1 l 2 h H21 g2 1 Li11aq2 1 OH21aq2
 
Covalent hydrides are formed when hydrogen combines with other nonmetals. We 
have encountered many of these compounds already: HCl, CH4, NH3, H2O, and so on. 
The most important covalent hydride is water. The polarity of the H2O molecule leads 
to many of water‚Äôs unusual properties. Water has a much higher boiling point than is 
expected from its molar mass. It has a large heat of vaporization and a large heat capac-
ity, both of which make it a very useful coolant. Water has a higher density as a liquid 
than as a solid because of the open structure of ice, which results from maximizing the 
hydrogen bonding (Fig. 20.5). Because water is an excellent solvent for ionic and polar 
 substances, it provides an effective medium for life processes. In fact, water is one of 
the few covalent hydrides that is nontoxic to organisms.
 
The third class of hydrides is the metallic, or interstitial, hydrides, which are 
formed when transition metal crystals are treated with hydrogen gas. The hydrogen 
molecules dissociate at the metal‚Äôs surface, and the small hydrogen atoms migrate into 
the crystal structure to occupy holes, or interstices. These metal‚Äìhydrogen mixtures 
are more like solid solutions than true compounds. Palladium can absorb about 900 
times its own volume of hydrogen gas. In fact, hydrogen can be purified by placing it 
Boiling points of covalent hydrides were 
discussed in Section 10.1.

under slight pressure in a vessel containing a thin wall of palladium. The hydrogen 
diffuses into and through the metal wall, leaving the impurities behind.
Although hydrogen can react with transition metals to form compounds such as 
UH3 and FeH6, most of the interstitial hydrides have variable compositions (often 
called nonstoichiometric compositions) with formulas such as LaH2.76 and VH0.56. The 
compositions of the nonstoichiometric hydrides vary with the length of exposure of the 
metal to hydrogen gas.
 
When interstitial hydrides are heated, much of the absorbed hydrogen is lost as 
hydrogen gas. Because of this behavior, these materials offer possibilities for storing 
hydrogen for use as a portable fuel. The internal combustion engines in current auto-
mobiles can burn hydrogen gas with little modification, but storage of enough hydro-
gen to provide an acceptable mileage range remains a problem. One possible solution 
might be to use a fuel tank containing a porous solid that includes a transition metal. 
The hydrogen gas could be pumped into the solid to form the interstitial hydride. The 
hydrogen gas could then be released when the engine requires additional energy. This 
system is now being tested by several automobile companies.
20.4 The Group 2A Elements
The Group 2A elements (with the valence electron configuration ns2) are very reactive, 
losing their two valence electrons to form ionic compounds that contain M21 cations. 
These elements are commonly called the alkaline earth metals because of the basic-
ity of their oxides:
MO1s2 1 H2O1 l 2 h M211aq2 1 2OH21aq2
Only the amphoteric beryllium oxide (BeO) also shows some acidic properties, such 
as dissolving in aqueous solutions containing hydroxide ions:
BeO1s2 1 2OH21aq2 1 H2O1 l 2 h Be1OH2 4
 221aq2
 
The more active alkaline earth metals react with water as the alkali metals do, pro-
ducing hydrogen gas:
M1s2 1 2H2O1 l 2 h M211aq2 1 2OH21aq2 1 H21 g2
Calcium, strontium, and barium react vigorously at 258C. The less easily oxidized 
beryllium and magnesium show no observable reaction with water at 258C, although 
magnesium reacts with boiling water. Table 20.6 summarizes various properties, 
sources, and methods of preparation of the alkaline earth metals.
See Section 6.6 for a discussion of the 
feasibility of using hydrogen gas as a fuel.

The alkaline earth metals have great practical importance. Calcium and magnesium 
ions are essential for human life. Calcium is found primarily in the structural minerals 
composing bones and teeth. Magnesium (as the Mg21 ion) plays a vital role in metabo-
lism and in muscle functions. Because magnesium metal has a relatively low density 
and displays moderate strength, it is a useful structural material, especially if alloyed 
with aluminum.
 
Table 20.7 summarizes some important reactions involving the alkaline earth 
metals.
 
Relatively large concentrations of Ca21 and Mg21 ions are often found in natural 
water supplies. These ions in this so-called hard water interfere with the action of 
detergents and form precipitates with soap. In Section 7.6 we saw that Ca21 is often 
removed by precipitation as CaCO3 in large-scale water softening. In individual homes 
Ca21, Mg21, and other cations are removed by ion exchange. An ion-exchange resin 
consists of large molecules (polymers) that have many ionic sites. A cation-exchange 
resin is represented schematically in Fig. 20.6(a), showing Na1 ions bound ionically to 
the SO32 groups that are covalently attached to the resin polymer. When hard water is 
passed over the resin, Ca21 and Mg21 bind to the resin in place of Na1, which is 
released into the solution [Fig. 20.6(b)]. Replacing Mg21 and Ca21 by Na1 [Fig. 
20.6(c)] ‚Äúsoftens‚Äù the water because the sodium salts of soap are soluble.

20.5 The Group 3A Elements
The Group 3A elements (valence electron configuration ns2np1) generally show the 
increase in metallic character in going down the group that is characteristic of the rep-
resentative elements. Some physical properties, sources, and methods of preparation 
of the Group 3A elements are summarized in Table 20.8.
 
Boron is a typical nonmetal, and most of its compounds are covalent. The most 
interesting compounds of boron are the covalent hydrides called boranes. We might 
expect BH3 to be the simplest hydride, since boron has three valence electrons to share 
with three  hydrogen atoms. However, this compound is unstable, and the simplest 
known member of the series is diborane (B2H6), with the structure shown in Fig. 
20.7(a). In this molecule the terminal BOH bonds are normal covalent bonds, each 
involving one electron pair. The bridging bonds are three-center bonds similar to those 
in solid BeH2. Another interesting borane contains the square pyramidal B5H9 mole-
cule [Fig. 20.7(b)], which has four three-center bonds situated around the base of the

pyramid. Because the boranes are extremely electron-deficient, they are highly reac-
tive. The boranes react very exothermically with oxygen and were once evaluated as 
potential fuels for rockets in the U.S. space program.
 
Aluminum, the most abundant metal on earth, has metallic physical properties, such 
as high thermal and electrical conductivities and a lustrous appearance; however, its 
bonds to nonmetals are significantly covalent. This covalency is responsible for the 
amphoteric nature of Al2O3, which dissolves in acidic or basic solution, and for the 
acidity of Al(H2O)631 (see Section 14.8):
Al1H2O2 6

One especially interesting property of gallium is its unusually low melting point of 
29.88C, which is in contrast to the 6608C melting point of aluminum. Also, since gal-
lium‚Äôs boiling point is about 24008C, it has the largest liquid range of any metal. This 
makes it useful for thermometers, especially to measure high temperatures. Gallium, 
like water, expands when it freezes. The chemistry of gallium is quite similar to that of 
aluminum. For example, Ga2O3 is amphoteric.
 
The chemistry of indium is similar to that of aluminum and gallium except that com-
pounds containing the 11 ion are known, such as InCl and In2O, in addition to those 
with the more common 31 ion. The chemistry of thallium is completely metallic.
 
Table 20.9 summarizes some important reactions of the Group 3A elements.
 
20.6 The Group 4A Elements
Group 4A (with the valence electron configuration ns2np2) contains two of the most 
important elements on earth: carbon, the fundamental constituent of the molecules nec-
essary for life, and silicon, which forms the basis of the geological world. The change 
from nonmetallic to metallic properties seen in Group 3A is also apparent in going 
down Group 4A from carbon, a typical nonmetal, to silicon and germanium, usually 
considered semimetals, to the metals tin and lead. Table 20.10 summarizes some physi-
cal properties, sources, and methods of preparation of the elements in this group.
 
All the Group 4A elements can form four covalent bonds to nonmetals‚Äîfor exam-
ple, CH4, SiF4, GeBr4, SnCl4, and PbCl4. In each of these tetrahedral molecules, the 
central atom is described as sp3 hybridized by the localized electron model.
 
We have seen that carbon also differs markedly from the other members of Group 
4A in its ability to form p bonds. This accounts for the completely different structures 
and properties of CO2 and SiO2. Note from Table 20.11 that COC bonds and SiOO 
bonds are stronger than SiOSi bonds. This partly explains why the chemistry of carbon 
is dominated by COC bonds, whereas that of silicon is dominated by SiOO bonds.

Carbon occurs in the allotropic forms graphite, diamond, and fullerenes, whose 
structures were given in Section 10.5. The most important chemistry of carbon is 
organic chemistry, which is described in detail in Chapter 22.
 
Silicon, the second most abundant element in the earth‚Äôs crust, is a semimetal found 
widely distributed in silica and silicates (see Section 10.5). About 85% of the earth‚Äôs 
crust is composed of these substances. Although silicon is found in some steel and alu-
minum alloys, its major use is in semiconductors for electronic devices (see Chapter 10).
 
Germanium, a relatively rare element, is a semimetal used mainly in the manufac-
ture of semiconductors for transistors and similar electronic devices.
 
Tin is a soft, silvery metal that can be rolled into thin sheets (tin foil) and has been 
used for centuries in various alloys such as bronze (20% Sn and 80% Cu), solder (33% 
Sn and 67% Pb), and pewter (85% Sn, 7% Cu, 6% Bi, and 2% Sb). Tin exists as three 
allotropes: white tin, stable at normal temperatures; gray tin, stable at temperatures 
below 13.28C; and brittle tin, found at temperatures above 1618C. When tin is exposed 
to low temperatures, it gradually changes to powdery gray tin and crumbles away; this 
is known as tin disease.
 
Currently, tin is used mainly as a protective coating for steel, especially for cans 
used as food containers. The thin layer of tin, applied electrolytically, forms a protec-
tive oxide coating that prevents further corrosion.
 
Lead is easily obtained from its ore, galena (PbS). Because lead melts at such a low 
temperature, it may have been the first pure metal obtained from its ore. We know that 
lead was used as early as 3000 b.c. by the Egyptians. It was later used by the Romans 
to make eating utensils, glazes on pottery, and even intricate plumbing systems. The 
Romans also prepared a sweetener called sapa by boiling down grape juice in lead-
lined vessels. The sweetness of this syrup was partly caused by the formation of 
lead(II) acetate (formerly called sugar of lead), a very sweet-tasting compound. The 
problem with these practices is that lead is very toxic. In fact, the Romans had so much 
contact with lead that it may have contributed to the demise of their civilization. Anal-
ysis of bones from that era shows significant levels of lead.
 
Although lead poisoning has been known since at least the second century b.c., 
lead continues to be a problem. For example, many children have been exposed to 
lead by eating chips of lead-based paint. Because of this problem, lead-based paints 
are no longer used for children‚Äôs furniture, and many states have banned lead-based 
paint for interior use. Lead poisoning can also occur when acidic foods and drinks 
leach the lead from lead-glazed pottery dishes that were improperly fired and when 
liquor is stored in leaded crystal decanters, producing toxic levels of lead in the 
drink in a relatively short time. In addition, the widespread use of tetraethyl lead 
A new form of elemental carbon, the 
fullerenes, was discussed in Chapter 2.

[(C2H5)4Pb] as an antiknock agent in gasoline has increased the lead levels in  
our environment. Concern about the effects of this lead pollution has caused the 
U.S. government to require the gradual replacement of the lead in gasoline with 
other antiknock agents. The largest commercial use of lead (over one million tons 
annually) is for electrodes in the lead storage batteries used in automobiles (see 
Section¬†18.5).
 
Table 20.12 summarizes some important reactions of the Group 4A elements.
L
udwig van Beethoven, arguably the 
greatest composer who ever lived, 
led a troubled life fraught with sick-
ness, deafness, and personality aberra-
tions. Now we may know the source of 
these difficulties: lead  poisoning. Scien-
tists have recently reached this conclu-
sion through analysis of Beethoven‚Äôs 
hair. When Beethoven died in 1827 at 
age 56, many mourners took samples 
of the great man‚Äôs hair. In fact, it was 
said at the time that he was practically 
bald by the time he was buried. The 
hair that was  recently analyzed con-
sisted of 582 strands‚Äî3 to 6 inches 
long‚Äîbought for the Center of 
Beethoven Studies for $7300 in 1994 
from Sotheby‚Äôs auction house in 
London.
According to William Walsh of the 
Health Research Institute (HRI) in sub-
urban Chicago, Beethoven‚Äôs hair 
showed a lead concentration 100 times 
the normal levels. The scientists con-
cluded that Beethoven‚Äôs exposure to 
lead came as an adult, possibly from 
the mineral water he drank and swam 
in when he visited spas.
The lead poisoning may well explain 
Beethoven‚Äôs volatile temper‚Äîthe 
composer was subject to tower-
ing rages and sometimes had the 
look of a wild animal. In rare cases 
lead poisoning has been known 
to cause deafness, but the 
researchers remain unsure if this 
problem led to Beethoven‚Äôs hear-
ing loss.
According to Walsh, the scien-
tists at HRI were originally looking 
for mercury, a common treatment 
for syphilis in the early nineteenth 
century, in Beethoven‚Äôs hair. The 
absence of mercury supports the 
consensus of scholars that 
Beethoven did not have this 
disease. Not surprisingly, 
Beethoven himself wanted to 
know what made him so ill. In a 
letter to his brothers in 1802, he 
asked them to have doctors find the 
cause of his frequent abdominal pain 
after his death.

20.7 The Group 5A Elements
The Group 5A elements (with the valence electron configuration ns2np3), which are 
prepared as shown in Table 20.13, exhibit remarkably varied chemical properties. As 
usual, metallic character increases going down the group, as is apparent from the elec-
tronegativity values (Table 20.13). Nitrogen and phosphorus are nonmetals that can 
gain three electrons to form 32 anions in salts with active metals; examples are mag-
nesium nitride (Mg3N2) and beryllium phosphide (Be3P2). The chemistry of these two 
important elements is discussed in the next two sections.
 
Bismuth and antimony tend to be metallic, readily losing electrons to form cations. 
Although these elements have five valence electrons, so much energy is required to 
remove all five that no ionic compounds containing Bi51 or Sb51 ions are known.
 
The Group 5A elements can form molecules or ions that involve three, five, or six 
covalent bonds to the Group 5A atom. Examples involving three single bonds are NH3, 
PH3, NF3, and AsCl3. Each of these molecules has a lone pair of electrons (and thus 
can behave as a Lewis base) and a pyramidal shape as predicted by the VSEPR model 
(Fig.¬†20.8).
 
All the Group 5A elements except nitrogen can form molecules with five covalent 
bonds (of general formula MX5). Nitrogen cannot form such molecules because of its 
small size. The MX5 molecules have a trigonal bipyramidal shape (Fig. 20.9) as pre-
dicted by the VSEPR model, and the central atom can be described as dsp3 hybridized.
 
Although the MX5 molecules have a trigonal bipyramidal structure in the gas phase, 
the solids of many of these compounds contain a 1:1 mixture of the ions MX41 and 
MX62 (Fig. 20.10). The MX41 cation is tetrahedral (the atom represented by M is sp3 
hybridized), and the MX62 anion is octahedral (the atom represented by M is d2sp3

hybridized). Examples are PCl5 (which in the solid state contains PCl41 and PCl62) 
and AsF3Cl2 (which in the solid state contains AsCl41 and AsF62).
 
As discussed in Section 20.1, the ability of the Group 5A elements to form p bonds 
decreases dramatically after nitrogen. This explains why elemental nitrogen exists as 
N2 molecules containing two p bonds, whereas the other elements in the group exist as 
larger aggregates containing single bonds. For example, in the gas phase the elements 
phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony consist of P4, As4, and Sb4 molecules, respectively.
20.8 The Chemistry of Nitrogen
At the earth‚Äôs surface virtually all elemental nitrogen exists as the N2 molecule with its 
very strong triple bond (941 kJ/mol). Because of this large bond strength, the N2 mol-
ecule is so unreactive that it can coexist with most other elements under normal condi-
tions without undergoing any appreciable reaction. This property makes nitrogen gas 
very useful as a medium for experiments involving substances that react with oxygen 
or water. Such experiments can be done using an inert atmosphere box of the type 
shown in Fig. 20.11.
 
The strength of the triple bond in the N2 molecule is important both thermodynami-
cally and kinetically. Thermodynamically, the great stability of the N{N bond means 
that most binary compounds containing nitrogen decompose exothermically to the 
elements, for example:
 N2O1 g2 h N21 g2 1 1
2O21 g2¬†¬†¬†¬†  DH¬∞ 5 282 kJ
 NO1 g2 h 1
2N21 g2 1 1
2O21 g2¬†¬†¬†¬† DH¬∞ 5 290 kJ
 NO21 g2 h 1
2N21 g2 1 O21 g2¬†¬†¬†¬†  DH¬∞ 5 234 kJ
 N2H41 g2 h N21 g2 1 2H21 g2¬†¬†¬†¬†  DH¬∞ 5 295 kJ
 NH31 g2 h 1
2N21 g2 1 3
2H21 g2¬†¬†¬†¬† DH¬∞ 5 146 kJ
Of these compounds, only ammonia is thermodynamically more stable than its com-
ponent elements. That is, only for ammonia is energy required to decompose the mol-
ecule to its elements. For the remaining molecules, energy is released when 
decomposition to the elements occurs, as a result of the great stability of N2.
 
The importance of the thermodynamic stability of N2 can be clearly seen in the 
power of nitrogen-based explosives, such as nitroglycerin (C3H5N3O9), which has the 
following skeletal structure:

When ignited or subjected to sudden impact, nitroglycerin decomposes very rapidly 
and exothermically:
4C3H5N3O91 l 2 h 6N21 g2 1 12CO21 g2 1 10H2O1 g2 1 O21 g2 1 energy
An explosion occurs; that is, large volumes of gas are produced in a fast, highly exo-
thermic reaction. Note that 4 moles of liquid nitroglycerin produce 29 (6 1 12 1 10 1 1) 
moles of gaseous products. This alone produces a large increase in volume. However, 
also note that the products, which include N2, are very stable molecules with strong 
bonds. Their formation is therefore accompanied by the release of large quantities of 
energy as heat, which increases the gaseous volume. The hot, rapidly expanding gases 
produce a pressure surge and damaging shock wave.
 
Most high explosives are organic compounds that, like nitroglycerin, contain nitro 
(ONO2) groups and produce nitrogen and other gases as products. Another example is 
trinitrotoluene (TNT), a solid at normal temperatures, which decomposes as follows:
2C7H5N3O61s2 h 12CO1 g2 1 5H21 g2 1 3N21 g2 1 2C1s2 1 energy
Note that 2 moles of solid TNT produce 20 moles of gaseous products plus energy.
 
The effect of bond strength on the kinetics of reactions involving the N2 molecule 
is illustrated by the synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen, a reaction we 
have discussed many times before. Because a large quantity of energy is required to 
disrupt the N{N bond, the ammonia synthesis reaction occurs at a negligible rate at 
room temperature, even though the equilibrium constant is very large (K < 108). Of 
course, the most direct way to increase the rate of a reaction is to raise the temperature. 
However, since this reaction is very exothermic,
N21 g2 1 3H21 g2 h 2NH31 g2¬†¬†¬†¬†DH¬∞ 5 292 kJ
the value of K decreases significantly with a temperature increase (at 5008C, K < 1022).
 
Obviously, the kinetics and the thermodynamics of this reaction are in opposition. 
A compromise must be reached, involving high pressure to force the equilibrium to the 
right and high temperature to produce a reasonable rate. The Haber process for manu-
facturing ammonia represents such a compromise (Fig. 20.12). The process is carried 
out at a pressure of about 250 atm and a temperature of approximately 4008C. Even 
higher temperatures would be required if a catalyst consisting of a solid iron oxide 
mixed with small amounts of potassium oxide and aluminum oxide were not used to 
facilitate the reaction.
 
Nitrogen is essential to living systems. The problem with nitrogen is not one of 
 supply‚Äîwe are surrounded by it‚Äîbut rather one of changing it from the inert N2 mol-
ecule to a form usable by plants and animals. The process of transforming N2 to other 
nitrogen-containing compounds is called nitrogen fixation. The Haber process is one 
example of nitrogen fixation. The ammonia produced can be applied to the soil as a 
 fertilizer, since plants can readily use the nitrogen in ammonia to make the nitrogen-
containing biomolecules essential for their growth.
 
Nitrogen fixation also results from the high-temperature combustion process in 
automobile engines. The nitrogen in the air is drawn into the engine and reacts at a 
significant rate with oxygen to form nitric oxide (NO), which further reacts with oxy-
gen from the air to form nitrogen dioxide (NO2). This nitrogen dioxide, which contrib-
utes to photochemical smog in many urban areas (see Section 12.8), reacts with 
moisture in the air and eventually reaches the soil to form nitrate salts, which are plant 
nutrients.
 
Nitrogen fixation also occurs naturally. For example, lightning provides the energy 
to disrupt N2 and O2 molecules in the air, producing highly reactive nitrogen and oxy-
gen atoms. These atoms in turn attack other N2 and O2 molecules to form nitrogen 
 oxides that eventually become nitrates. Although lightning has traditionally been cred-
ited with forming about 10% of the total fixed nitrogen, recent studies indicate that 
lightning may account for as much as half of the fixed nitrogen available on earth. 
Another natural nitrogen fixation process involves bacteria that reside in the root

nodules of plants such as beans, peas, and alfalfa. These nitrogen-fixing bacteria 
readily allow the conversion of nitrogen to ammonia and to other nitrogen-containing 
compounds useful to plants. The efficiency of these bacteria is intriguing: They pro-
duce ammonia at soil temperatures and 1 atm pressure, whereas the Haber process 
requires severe conditions of 4008C and 250 atm. For obvious reasons, researchers are 
studying these bacteria intensively.
 
When plants and animals die and decompose, the elements they consist of are 
returned to the environment. In the case of nitrogen, the return of the element to the 
atmosphere as nitrogen gas, called denitrification, is carried out by bacteria that 
change nitrates to nitrogen. The complex nitrogen cycle is summarized in Fig. 20.13. 
It has been estimated that as much as 10 million tons more nitrogen per year is cur-
rently being fixed by natural and human processes than is being returned to the atmo-
sphere. This fixed nitrogen is accumulating in soil, lakes, rivers, and oceans, where it 
promotes the growth of  algae and other undesirable organisms.
Nitrogen Hydrides
By far the most important hydride of nitrogen is ammonia. A toxic, colorless gas with 
a pungent odor, ammonia is manufactured in huge quantities (approximately 40 billion 
pounds per year), mainly for use in fertilizers.
 
The pyramidal ammonia molecule has a lone pair of electrons on its nitrogen atom 
(see Fig. 20.8) and polar NOH bonds. This structure leads to a high degree of intermo-
lecular interaction by hydrogen bonding in the liquid state, thereby producing an 
unusually high boiling point (233.48C) for a substance with such a low molar mass. 
Note, however, that the hydrogen bonding in liquid ammonia is clearly not as impor-
tant as that in liquid water, which has about the same molar mass but a much higher 
boiling point. The water molecule has two polar bonds involving hydrogen and two 
lone pairs‚Äîthe right combination for optimum hydrogen bonding‚Äîin contrast to the 
one lone pair and three polar bonds of the ammonia molecule.
 
As we saw in Chapter 14, ammonia behaves as a base, reacting with acids to pro-
duce ammonium salts. For example,
NH31 g2 1 HCl1 g2 h NH4Cl1s2
 
A second nitrogen hydride of major importance is hydrazine (N2H4). The Lewis

indicates that each nitrogen atom should be sp3 hybridized with bond angles close to 
109.58 (the tetrahedral angle), since the nitrogen atom is surrounded by four electron 
pairs. The observed structure with bond angles of 1128 (Fig. 20.14) agrees reasonably

well with these predictions. Hydrazine, a colorless liquid with an ammoniacal odor, 
freezes at 28C and boils at 113.58C. This boiling point is quite high for a compound 
with a molar mass of 32; this suggests that considerable hydrogen bonding occurs 
among the polar hydrazine molecules.
 
Hydrazine is a powerful reducing agent and has been widely used as a rocket pro-
pellant. For example, its reaction with oxygen is highly exothermic:
N2H41 l 2 1 O21 g2 h N21 g2 1 2H2O1 g2¬†¬†¬†¬†DH¬∞ 5 2622 kJ
Since hydrazine also reacts vigorously with the halogens, fluorine is often used instead 
of oxygen as the oxidizer in rocket engines. Substituted hydrazines, where one or more 
of the hydrogen atoms are replaced by other groups, are also useful rocket fuels. For 
example, monomethylhydrazine,

is used with the oxidizer dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) to power the U.S. space shuttle 
orbiter. The reaction is
5N2O41 l 2 1 4N2H31CH32 1 l 2 h 12H2O1 g2 1 9N21 g2 1 4CO21 g2
Because of the large number of gaseous molecules produced and the exothermic nature 
of this reaction, a very high thrust per mass of fuel is achieved. The reaction is also 
 self-starting‚Äîit begins immediately when the fuels are mixed‚Äîwhich is a useful 
property for rocket engines that must be started and stopped frequently.
 
The use of hydrazine as a rocket propellant is a rather specialized application. The 
main industrial use of hydrazine is as a ‚Äúblowing‚Äù agent in the manufacture of plastics. 
Hydrazine decomposes to form nitrogen gas, which causes foaming in the liquid plas-
tic and results in a porous texture. Another major use of hydrazine is in the production 
of agricultural pesticides. Of the many hundreds of hydrazine derivatives (substituted 
hydrazines) that have been tested, 40 are used as fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, 
or plant growth regulators.
Nitrogen Oxides
Nitrogen forms a series of oxides in which its oxidation state ranges from 11 to 15, 
as shown in Table 20.14.
 
Dinitrogen monoxide (N2O), more commonly called nitrous oxide or laughing gas, 
has an inebriating effect and has been used as a mild anesthetic by dentists. Because of 
its high solubility in fats, nitrous oxide is widely used as a propellant in aerosol cans 
of whipped cream. It is dissolved in the liquid inside the can at high pressure and forms 
bubbles that produce foaming as the liquid is released from the can. A significant 
amount of N2O exists in the atmosphere, mostly produced by soil microorganisms, and 
its concentration appears to be gradually increasing. Because it can strongly absorb 
infrared radiation, nitrous oxide plays a small but probably significant role in control-
ling the earth‚Äôs temperature in the same way that atmospheric carbon dioxide and 
water vapor do (see the discussion of the greenhouse effect in Section 6.5). Some sci-
entists fear that the rapid decrease of tropical rain forests resulting from the develop-
ment of countries such as Brazil will significantly affect the rate of production of N2O 
by soil organisms and thus will have important effects on the earth‚Äôs temperature.
 
Nitrogen monoxide (NO), commonly called nitric oxide, has been found to be an impor-
tant regulator in biological systems. Nitric oxide is a colorless gas under normal  conditions 
and can be produced in the laboratory by reacting 6 M nitric acid with  copper metal:

Since the NO molecule has an odd number of electrons, it is most conveniently 
described in terms of the molecular orbital model. The molecular orbital energy-level 
diagram is shown in Fig. 20.15. Note that the NO molecule should be paramagnetic 
and have a bond order of 2.5, predictions that are supported by experimental observa-
tions. Since the NO molecule has one high-energy electron, it is not surprising that it 
can be rather easily oxidized to form NO1, the nitrosyl ion. Because an antibonding 
electron is removed in going from NO to NO1, the resulting ion should have a stronger 
bond (the predicted bond order is 3) than the molecule. This is borne out by experi-
ment. The bond lengths and bond energies for nitric oxide and the nitrosyl ion are 
shown in Table 20.15.
 
Nitric oxide is thermodynamically unstable and decomposes to nitrous oxide and 
nitrogen dioxide:
3NO1 g2 h N2O1 g2 1 NO21 g2
 
Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which is also an odd-electron molecule, has a V-shaped 
structure. The reddish brown, paramagnetic NO2 molecule readily dimerizes to form 
dinitrogen tetroxide,
2NO21 g2 m N2O41 g2
which is diamagnetic and colorless. The value of the equilibrium constant is approxi-
mately 1 for this process at 558C, and since the dimerization is exothermic, K decreases 
as the temperature increases.

The least common of the nitrogen oxides are dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3), a blue 
liquid that readily dissociates to gaseous nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide, and dinitro-
gen pentoxide (N2O5), which under normal conditions is a solid that is best viewed as 
a mixture of NO21 and NO32 ions. Although N2O5 molecules can exist in the gas 
phase, they readily dissociate to nitrogen dioxide and oxygen:
2N2O51 g2 m 4NO21 g2 1 O21 g2
This reaction follows first-order kinetics, as discussed in Section 12.4.
Oxyacids of Nitrogen
Nitric acid is an important industrial chemical (approximately 8 million tons pro-
duced annually) used in the manufacture of many products, such as nitrogen-based 
explosives and ammonium nitrate for use as a fertilizer.
 
Nitric acid is produced commercially by the oxidation of ammonia in the Ostwald 
process (Fig. 20.16). In the first step of this process, ammonia is oxidized to nitric oxide:
4NH31 g2 1 5O21 g2 h 4NO1 g2 1 6H2O1 g2¬†¬†¬†¬†DH¬∞ 5 2905 kJ
Although this reaction is highly exothermic, it is very slow at 258C. A side reaction 
occurs between nitric oxide and ammonia:
4NH31 g2 1 6NO1 g2 h 5N21 g2 1 6H2O1 g2
which is particularly undesirable because it traps the nitrogen in the very unreactive  
N2 molecules. The desired reaction can be accelerated and the effects of the competing 
reaction can be minimized if the ammonia oxidation is carried out by using a catalyst 
of a platinum‚Äìrhodium alloy heated to 9008C. Under these conditions, there is a 97% 
conversion of the ammonia to nitric oxide.
 
In the second step, nitric oxide is reacted with oxygen to produce nitrogen dioxide:
2NO1 g2 1 O21 g2 h 2NO21 g2¬†¬†¬†¬†DH¬∞ 5 2113 kJ
This oxidation reaction has a rate that decreases with increasing temperature. Because 
of this very unusual behavior, the reaction is carried out at approximately 258C and is 
kept at this temperature by cooling with water.
 
The third step in the Ostwald process is the absorption of nitrogen dioxide by water:

The gaseous NO produced in the reaction is recycled so that it can be oxidized to NO2. 
The aqueous nitric acid from this process is about 50% HNO3 by mass, which can be 
 increased to 68% by distillation to remove some of the water. The maximum concen-
tration attainable by this method is 68% because nitric acid and water form an azeo-
trope at this concentration. The solution can be further concentrated to 95% HNO3 by 
treatment with concentrated sulfuric acid, which strongly absorbs water; H2SO4 is 
often used as a dehydrating (water-removing) agent.
 
Nitric acid is a colorless, fuming liquid (bp 5 838C) with a pungent odor; it decom-
poses in sunlight by the following reaction:
4HNO31 l 2 h
hv
4NO21 g2 1 2H2O1 l 2 1 O21 g2
As a result, nitric acid turns yellow as it ages because of the dissolved nitrogen diox-
ide. The common laboratory reagent called concentrated nitric acid is 15.9 M HNO3 
(70.4% HNO3 by mass) and is a very strong oxidizing agent. The resonance structures 
and mo lecular structure of HNO3 are shown in Fig. 20.17. Note that the hydrogen is 
bound to an oxygen atom rather than to nitrogen as the formula might suggest.
 
Nitrous acid (HNO2) is a weak acid,
HNO21aq2 m H11aq2 1 NO2
21aq2¬†¬†¬†¬†Ka 5 4.0 3 1024
that forms pale yellow nitrite (NO22) salts. In contrast to nitrates, which are often used 
as explosives, nitrites are quite stable even at high temperatures.
An azeotrope is a solution that, like a pure 
liquid, distills at a constant temperature 
without a change in composition.
N
itrous oxide (N2O), more properly 
called dinitrogen monoxide, is a 
compound with many interesting uses. 
It was discovered in 1772 by Joseph 
Priestley (who is also given credit for 
discovering oxygen gas), and its intoxi-
cating effects were noted almost 
immediately. In 1798, the 20-year-old 
Humphry Davy became director of the 
Pneumatic Institute, which was set up 
to investigate the medical effects of 
various gases. Davy tested the effects 
of N2O on himself, reporting that  
after inhaling 16 quarts of the gas in  
7 minutes, he became ‚Äúabsolutely 
intoxicated.‚Äù
Over the next century ‚Äúlaughing 
gas,‚Äù as nitrous oxide became known, 
was developed as an anesthetic, par-
ticularly for dental procedures. Nitrous 
oxide is still used as an anesthetic, 
although it has been primarily replaced 
by more modern drugs.
One major use of nitrous oxide today 
is as the propellant in cans of ‚Äúinstant‚Äù 
whipped cream. The high solubility of 
N2O in the whipped cream mixture 
makes it an excellent candidate for 
pressurizing the cans of whipping cream.
Another current use of nitrous oxide 
is to produce ‚Äúinstant horsepower‚Äù for 
street racers. Because the reaction of 
N2O with O2 to form NO actually 
absorbs heat, this reaction has a cool-
ing effect when placed in the fuel 
mixture in an automobile engine. This 
cooling effect lowers combustion 
temperatures, thus allowing the fuel‚Äì
air mixture to be significantly more 
dense (the density of a gas is inversely 
proportional to temperature). The 
effect can produce a burst  
of additional power in excess of  
200 horsepower. Because engines are 
not designed to run steadily at such 
high power levels, the nitrous oxide is 
injected from a tank when extra power 
is desired.

20.9 The Chemistry of Phosphorus
Although phosphorus lies directly below nitrogen in Group 5A of the periodic table, 
its chemical properties are significantly different from those of nitrogen. The differ-
ences arise mainly from four factors: nitrogen‚Äôs ability to form much stronger p bonds, 
the greater electronegativity of nitrogen, the larger size of phosphorus atoms, and the 
potential availability of empty valence d orbitals on phosphorus.
The chemical differences between nitrogen and phosphorus are apparent in their 
elemental forms. In contrast to the diatomic form of elemental nitrogen, which is sta-
bilized by strong p bonds, there are several solid forms of phosphorus that all contain 
aggregates of atoms. White phosphorus, which contains discrete tetrahedral P4 mole-
cules [Fig. 20.18(a)], is very reactive; it bursts into flames on contact with air (it is said 
to be pyrophoric). Consequently, white phosphorus is commonly stored under water. 
White phosphorus is quite toxic; the P4 molecules are very damaging to tissue, particu-
larly the cartilage and bones of the nose and jaw. The much less reactive forms, called 
black  phosphorus and red phosphorus, are network solids (see Section 10.5). Black 
phosphorus has a regular crystalline structure [Fig. 20.18(b)], but red phosphorus is 
amorphous and is thought to consist of chains of P4 units [Fig. 20.18(c)]. Red phos-
phorus can be obtained by heating white phosphorus in the absence of air at 1 atm. 
Black phosphorus is obtained from either white or red phosphorus by heating at high 
pressures.
 
Even though phosphorus has a lower electronegativity than nitrogen, it will form 
phosphides (ionic substances containing the P32 anion) such as Na3P and Ca3P2. Phos-
phide salts react vigorously with water to produce phosphine (PH3), a toxic, colorless 
gas:
2Na3P1s2 1 6H2O1 l 2 h 2PH31 g2 1 6Na11aq2 1 6OH21aq2
Phosphine is analogous to ammonia, although it is a much weaker base (Kb < 10226) 
and is much less soluble in water.
 
Phosphine has the Lewis structure
H
H

P
and a pyramidal molecular structure, as we would predict from the VSEPR model. 
However, it has bond angles of 948 rather than 1078, as found in the ammonia mole-
cule. The reasons for this are complex; therefore, we will simply regard phosphine as 
an exception to the simple version of the VSEPR model that we use.
Phosphorus Oxides and Oxyacids
Phosphorus reacts with oxygen to form oxides in which its oxidation states are 15 and 
13. The oxide P4O6 is formed when elemental phosphorus is burned in a limited sup-
ply of oxygen, and P4O10 is produced when the oxygen is in excess. Picture these 
oxides (shown in Fig. 20.19) as being constructed by adding oxygen atoms to the 
fundamental P4 structure. The intermediate states, P4O7, P4O8, and P4O9, which con-
tain one, two, and three terminal oxygen atoms, respectively, are also known.

The terminal oxygens are the nonbridging 
oxygen atoms.

Tetraphosphorus decoxide (P4O10), which was formerly represented as P2O5 and 
called phosphorus pentoxide, has a great affinity for water and thus is a powerful dehy-
drating agent. For example, it can be used to convert HNO3 and H2SO4 to their parent 
oxides, N2O5 and SO3, respectively.
 
When tetraphosphorus decoxide dissolves in water, phosphoric acid (H3PO4), also 
called orthophosphoric acid, is produced:
P4O101s2 1 6H2O1 l 2 h 4H3PO41aq2
Pure phosphoric acid is a white solid that melts at 428C. Aqueous phosphoric acid is a 
much weaker acid (Ka1 < 1022) than nitric acid or sulfuric acid and is a poor oxidizing 
agent.
 
When the oxide P4O6 is placed in water, phosphorous acid (H3PO3) is formed [Fig. 
20.20(a)]. Although the formula suggests a triprotic acid, phosphorous acid is a 
diprotic acid. The hydrogen atom bonded directly to the phosphorus atom is not acidic 
in aqueous solution; only those hydrogen atoms bonded to the oxygen atoms in H3PO3 
can be released as protons.
 
A third oxyacid of phosphorus is hypophosphorous acid (H3PO2) [Fig. 20.20(b)], 
which is a monoprotic acid.
Phosphorus in Fertilizers
Phosphorus is essential for plant growth. Although most soil contains large amounts of 
phosphorus, it is often present in insoluble minerals, making it inaccessible to the 
plants. Soluble phosphate fertilizers are manufactured by treating phosphate rock  
with sulfuric acid to make superphosphate of lime, a mixture of CaSO4 ? 2H2O and 
Ca(H2PO4)2 ? H2O. If phosphate rock is treated with phosphoric acid, Ca(H2PO4)2, 
known as triple phosphate, is  produced. The reaction of ammonia with phosphoric 
acid gives ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NH4H2PO4), a very efficient fertilizer 
that furnishes both phosphorus and nitrogen.

20.10 The Group 6A Elements
Although in Group 6A (Table 20.16) there is the usual tendency for metallic properties 
to increase going down the group, none of the Group 6A elements behaves as a typical 
metal. The most common chemical behavior of a Group 6A element involves reacting 
with a metal to achieve a noble gas electron configuration by adding two electrons to 
become a 22 anion in ionic compounds. In fact, for most metals, the oxides and sul-
fides constitute the most common minerals.
 
The Group 6A elements can form covalent bonds with other nonmetals. For exam-
ple, they combine with hydrogen to form a series of covalent hydrides of the general 
formula H2X. Those members of the group that have valence d orbitals available (all 
except oxygen) commonly form molecules in which they are surrounded by more than 
eight electrons. Examples are SF4, SF6, TeI4, and SeBr4.
 
The two heaviest members of Group 6A can lose electrons to form cations.  Although 
they do not lose all six valence electrons because of the high energies that would be 
 required, tellurium and polonium appear to exhibit some chemistry involving their 41 
cations. However, the chemistry of these Group 6A cations is much more limited than 
that of the Group 5A elements bismuth and antimony.
 
In recent years there has been a growing interest in the chemistry of selenium, an 
element found throughout the environment in trace amounts. Selenium‚Äôs toxicity has 
long been known, but some medical studies have shown an inverse relationship 
between the incidence of cancer and the selenium levels in soil. It has been suggested 
that the greater dietary intake of selenium by people living in areas with relatively high 
selenium levels somehow furnishes protection from cancer. These studies are only 
preliminary, but selenium is definitely known to be physiologically important (it is 
involved in the activity of vitamin E and certain enzymes). Selenium (as well as tel-
lurium) is also a semiconductor and therefore finds some application in the electronics 
industry.
 
Polonium was discovered in 1898 by Marie and Pierre Curie in their search for the 
sources of radioactivity in pitchblende. Polonium has 27 isotopes and is highly toxic 
and very radioactive. It has been suggested that the isotope 210Po, a natural contami-
nant of tobacco and an a-particle producer (see Section 19.1), might be at least partly 
responsible for the incidence of cancer in smokers.
20.11 The Chemistry of Oxygen
It is hard to overstate the importance of oxygen, the most abundant element in and near 
the earth‚Äôs crust. Oxygen is present in the atmosphere as oxygen gas and ozone; in soil 
and rocks in oxide, silicate, and carbonate minerals; in the oceans in water; and in our 
bodies in water and a myriad of other molecules. In addition, most of the energy we

need to live and run our civilization comes from the exothermic reactions of oxygen 
with  carbon-containing molecules.
 
The most common elemental form of oxygen (O2) constitutes 21% of the volume 
of the earth‚Äôs atmosphere. Since nitrogen has a lower boiling point than oxygen, 
nitrogen can be boiled away from liquid air, leaving oxygen and small amounts of 
argon, another component of air. Liquid oxygen is a pale blue liquid that freezes at 
22198C and boils at 21838C. The paramagnetism of the O2 molecule can be demon-
strated by pouring liquid oxygen between the poles of a strong magnet, where it 
‚Äústicks‚Äù until it boils away (see Fig. 9.39). The paramagnetism of the O2 molecule can 
be accounted for by the molecular orbital model (Fig. 9.38), which also explains its 
bond strength.
 
The other form of elemental oxygen is ozone (O3), a molecule that can be repre-
sented by the resonance structures
O
O
O
O
O
O
The bond angle in the O3 molecule is 1178, in reasonable agreement with the predic-
tion of the VSEPR model (three effective pairs require a trigonal planar arrangement). 
That the bond angle is slightly less than 1208 can be explained by concluding that more 
space is required for the lone pair than for the bonding pairs.
 
Ozone can be prepared by passing an electrical discharge through pure oxygen gas. 
The electrical energy disrupts the bonds in some O2 molecules, thereby producing 
oxygen atoms, which react with other O2 molecules to form O3. Ozone is much less 
stable than oxygen at 258C and 1 atm. For example, K < 10256 for the equilibrium
3O21 g2 m 2O31 g2
 
A pale blue, highly toxic gas, ozone is a much more powerful oxidizing agent than 
oxygen. The strong oxidizing power of ozone makes it useful for killing bacteria in 
swimming pools, hot tubs, and aquariums. It is also increasingly being used in munic-
ipal water treatment and for washing produce after it comes out of the fields. One of 
the main advantages of using ozone for water purification is that it does not leave 
potentially toxic residues behind. On the other hand, chlorine, which is widely used 
for water purification, leaves residues of chloro compounds, such as chloroform 
(CHCl3), which may cause cancer after long-term exposure. Although ozone effec-
tively kills the bacteria in water, one problem with ozonolysis is that the water supply 
is not protected against recontamination, since virtually no ozone remains after the 
initial treatment. In contrast, for chlorination, significant residual chlorine remains 
after treatment.
 
The oxidizing ability of ozone can be detrimental, especially when it is present in 
the pollution from automobile exhausts (see Section 5.10).
 
Ozone exists naturally in the upper atmosphere of the earth. The ozone layer is 
especially important because it absorbs ultraviolet light and thus acts as a screen to 
prevent this radiation, which can cause skin cancer, from penetrating to the earth‚Äôs 
surface. When an ozone molecule absorbs this energy, it splits into an oxygen mole-
cule and an oxygen atom:
O3 h
hv
O2 1 O
If the oxygen molecule and atom collide, they will not stay together as ozone unless a 
‚Äúthird body,‚Äù such as a nitrogen molecule, is present to help absorb the energy released 
by bond formation. The third body absorbs this energy as kinetic energy; its tempera-
ture is increased. Therefore, the energy originally absorbed as ultraviolet radiation is 
eventually changed to thermal energy. Thus the ozone prevents the harmful high- 
energy ultraviolet light from reaching the earth.
Scientists have become concerned that 
Freons and nitrogen dioxide are promoting 
the destruction of the ozone layer  
(see Section 12.8).

20.12 The Chemistry of Sulfur
Sulfur is found in nature both in large deposits of the free element and in widely 
distributed ores, such as galena (PbS), cinnabar (HgS), pyrite (FeS2), gypsum 
(CaSO4 ? 2H2O), epsomite (MgSO4 ? 7H2O), and glauberite (Na2SO4 ? CaSO4).
 
About 60% of the sulfur produced in the United States comes from the underground 
deposits of elemental sulfur found in Texas and Louisiana. This sulfur is recovered by 
using the Frasch process developed by Herman Frasch in the 1890s. Superheated 
water is pumped into the deposit to melt the sulfur (mp 5 1138C), which is then forced 
to the  surface by air pressure (Fig. 20.21). The remaining 40% of sulfur produced in 
the United States either is a by-product of the purification of fossil fuels before com-
bustion to prevent pollution or comes from the sulfur dioxide (SO2) scrubbed from the 
exhaust gases when sulfur-containing fuels are burned.
 
In contrast to oxygen, elemental sulfur exists as S2 molecules only in the gas phase 
at high temperatures. Because sulfur atoms form much stronger s bonds than p 
bonds, S2 is less stable at 258C than larger aggregates such as S6 and S8 rings and Sn
chains (Fig. 20.22). The most stable form of sulfur at 258C and 1 atm is called rhom-
bic sulfur [Fig. 20.23(a)], which contains stacked S8 rings. If rhombic sulfur is melted 
and heated to 1208C, it forms monoclinic sulfur as it slowly cools [Fig. 20.23(b)]. The 
monoclinic form also contains S8 rings, but the rings are stacked differently than in 
rhombic sulfur.

Sulfur Oxides
From its position below oxygen in the periodic table, we might expect the simplest 
stable oxide of sulfur to have the formula SO. However, sulfur monoxide, which can 
be produced in small amounts when gaseous sulfur dioxide (SO2) is subjected to an 
electrical discharge, is very unstable. The difference in the stabilities of the O2 and SO 
molecules probably reflects the much stronger p bonding between oxygen atoms than 
between a sulfur and an oxygen atom.
 
Sulfur burns in air with a bright blue flame to give sulfur dioxide (SO2), a colorless 
gas with a pungent odor, which condenses to a liquid at 2108C and 1 atm. Sulfur diox-
ide is a V-shaped molecule, which is a very effective antibacterial agent often used to 
preserve stored fruit.
 
Sulfur dioxide reacts with oxygen to produce sulfur trioxide (SO3):
2SO21 g2 1 O21 g2 h 2SO31 g2
However, this reaction is very slow in the absence of a catalyst. One of the mysteries 
 during early research on air pollution was how the sulfur dioxide produced from the 
combustion of sulfur-containing fuels is so rapidly converted to sulfur trioxide in the 
atmosphere. It is now known that dust and other particles can act as heterogeneous 
catalysts for this process (see Section 12.8).
Oxyacids of Sulfur
Sulfur dioxide dissolves in water to form an acidic solution. The reaction is often rep-
resented as
SO21 g2 1 H2O1 l 2 h H2SO31aq2
where H2SO3 is called sulfurous acid. However, very little H2SO3 actually exists in the 
solution. The major form of sulfur dioxide in water is SO2, and the acid dissociation 
equilibria are best represented as
 SO21aq2 1 H2O1 l 2 m H11aq2 1 HSO3

 HSO3
21aq2 m H11aq2 1 SO3
221aq2¬†¬†¬†¬†  Ka2 5 1.0 3 1027
This situation is analogous to the behavior of carbon dioxide in water (see Section 
14.7). Although H2SO3 cannot be isolated, salts of SO322 (sulfites) and HSO32 (hydro-
gen sulfites) are well known.
The scrubbing of sulfur dioxide from  
exhaust gases was discussed in  
Section 5.10.

Sulfur trioxide reacts violently with water to produce the diprotic acid sulfuric acid:
SO31 g2 1 H2O1 l 2 h H2SO41aq2
Manufactured in greater amounts than any other chemical, sulfuric acid is usually 
produced by the contact process. About 60% of the sulfuric acid manufactured in the 
United States is used to produce fertilizers from phosphate rock. The other 40% is used 
in lead storage batteries, in petroleum refining, in steel manufacturing, and for various 
other purposes in the chemical industry.
Because sulfuric acid has a high affinity for water, it is often used as a dehydrating 
agent. Gases that do not react with sulfuric acid, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon 
dioxide, are often dried by bubbling them through concentrated solutions of the acid. 
Sulfuric acid is such a powerful dehydrating agent that it will remove hydrogen and 
oxygen from a substance in a 2:1 ratio even when the substance contains no molecular 
water. For example, concentrated sulfuric acid reacts vigorously with common table 
sugar (sucrose), leaving a charred mass of carbon (Fig. 20.24):

20.13 The Group 7A Elements
In our coverage of the representative elements we have progressed from the groups of 
metallic elements (Groups 1A and 2A), through groups in which the lighter members 
are nonmetals and the heavier members are metals (Groups 3A, 4A, and 5A), to a 
group containing all nonmetals (Group 6A‚Äîalthough some might prefer to call polo-
nium a metal). The Group 7A elements, the halogens (with the valence electron con-
figuration ns2np5), are all nonmetals whose properties generally vary smoothly going 
down the group. The only notable exceptions are the unexpectedly low value for the 
electron affinity of  fluorine and the unexpectedly small bond energy of the F2 molecule 
(see Section 20.1). Table 20.17 summarizes the trends in some physical properties of 
the halogens.
 
Because of their high reactivities, the halogens are not found as free elements in 
nature. Instead, they are found as halide ions (X2) in various minerals and in sea water 
(Table 20.18).
 
Although astatine is a member of Group 7A, its chemistry is of no practical impor-
tance because all its known isotopes are radioactive. The longest-lived isotope, 210At, 
has a half-life of only 8.3 hours.
 
The halogens, particularly fluorine, have very high electronegativity values (see 
Table 20.17). They tend to form polar covalent bonds with other nonmetals and ionic 
bonds with metals in their lower oxidation states. When a metal ion is in a higher oxi-
dation state, such as 13 or 14, the metal‚Äìhalogen bonds are polar and covalent. For 
example, TiCl4 and SnCl4 are both covalent compounds that are liquids under normal 
conditions.

Hydrogen Halides
The hydrogen halides can be prepared by a reaction of the elements
H21 g2 1 X21 g2 h 2HX1 g2
This reaction occurs with explosive vigor when fluorine and hydrogen are mixed. On 
the other hand, hydrogen and chlorine can coexist with little apparent reaction for rela-
tively long periods in the dark. However, ultraviolet light causes an explosively fast 
reaction, and this is the basis of a popular lecture demonstration, the ‚Äúhydrogen‚Äì 
chlorine cannon.‚Äù Bromine and iodine also react with hydrogen, but more slowly.
 
Some physical properties of the hydrogen halides are listed in Table 20.19. Note the 
very high boiling point for hydrogen fluoride, which results from extensive hydrogen 
bonding among the very polar HF molecules (Fig. 20.25). Fluoride ion has such a high 
 affinity for protons that in concentrated aqueous solutions of hydrogen fluoride, the ion 
[F---H---F]2 exists, in which an H1 ion is centered between two F2 ions.
 
When dissolved in water, the hydrogen halides behave as acids, and all except 
hydrogen fluoride are completely dissociated. Because water is a much stronger base 
than the Cl2, Br2, or I2 ion, the acid strengths of HCl, HBr, and HI cannot be differ-
entiated in water. However, in a less basic solvent, such as glacial (pure) acetic acid, 
the acids show different strengths:

from a thermodynamic point of view. Recall that acid strength is reflected by the mag-
nitude of Ka‚Äîa small Ka value means a weak acid. Also recall that the value of an 
equilibrium constant is related to the standard free energy change for the reaction,
DG¬∞ 5 2RT ln1K2
As DG8 becomes more negative, K becomes larger; a decrease in free energy favors a 
given reaction. As we saw in Chapter 17, free energy depends on enthalpy, entropy, 
and temperature. For a process at constant temperature,
DG¬∞ 5 DH¬∞ 2 TDS¬∞
Thus, to explain the various acid strengths of the hydrogen halides, we must focus on 
the factors that determine DH8 and DS8 for the acid dissociation reaction.
 
What energy terms are important in determining DH8 for the dissociation of HX in 
water? (Keep in mind that large, positive contributions to the value of DH8 will tend to 
make DG8 more highly positive, Ka smaller, and the acid weaker.) One important factor 
is  certainly the HOX bond strength. Note from Table 20.19 that the HOF bond is 
much stronger than the other HOX bonds. This factor tends to make HF a weaker acid 
than the others.
 
Another important contribution to DH8 is the enthalpy of hydration (see Section 
11.2) of X2 (Table 20.20). As we would expect, the smallest of the halide ions, F2, has 
the most negative value‚Äîits hydration is the most exothermic. This term favors the 
dissociation of HF into its ions more so than it does for the other HX molecules.
 
So far we have two conflicting factors: The large HF bond energy tends to make HF 
a weaker acid than the other hydrogen halides, but the enthalpy of hydration favors the 
dissociation of HF more than that of the others. When we compare data for HF and 
HCl, the difference in bond energy (138 kJ/mol) is slightly smaller than the difference 
in the enthalpies of hydration for the anions (144 kJ/mol). If these were the only impor-
tant factors, HF should be a stronger acid than HCl because the large enthalpy of 
hydration of F2 more than compensates for the large HF bond strength.
 
As it turns out, the deciding factor appears to be entropy. Note from Table 20.20 
that the entropy of hydration for F2 is much more negative than the entropy of hydra-
tion for the other halides because of the high degree of ordering that occurs as the 
water molecules associate with the small F2 ion. Remember that a negative change in 
entropy is unfavorable. Thus, although the enthalpy of hydration favors dissociation of 
HF, the entropy of hydration strongly opposes it.
 
When all these factors are taken into account, DG8 for the dissociation of HF in 
water is positive; that is, Ka is small. In contrast, DG8 for dissociation of the other HX 
molecules in water is negative (Ka is large). This example illustrates the complexity of 
the processes that occur in aqueous solutions and the importance of entropy effects in 
that medium.
 
In practical terms, hydrochloric acid is the most important of the hydrohalic  
acids, the aqueous solutions of the hydrogen halides. About 3 million tons of hydro-
chloric acid are produced annually for use in cleaning steel before galvanizing and in 
the manufacture of many other chemicals.
 
Hydrofluoric acid is used to etch glass by reacting with the silica in glass to form 
the volatile gas SiF4:
SiO21s2 1 4HF1aq2 h SiF41 g2 1 2H2O1 l 2
Oxyacids and Oxyanions
All the halogens except fluorine combine with various numbers of oxygen atoms to 
form a series of oxyacids, as shown in Table 20.21. The strengths of these acids vary 
in direct proportion to the number of oxygen atoms attached to the halogen, with the 
acid strength increasing as more oxygens are added.
Hydration becomes more exothermic as 
the charge density of an ion increases. 
Thus, for ions of a given charge, the 
smallest is most strongly hydrated.
When H2O molecules cluster around an 
ion, an ordering effect occurs; thus DS8hyd 
is negative.
Stomach acid is 0.1 M HCl.

The only member of the chlorine series that has been obtained in the pure state is 
perchloric acid (HOClO3), a strong acid and a powerful oxidizing agent. Because per-
chloric acid reacts explosively with many organic materials, it must be handled with 
great caution. The other oxyacids of chlorine are known only in solution, although 
salts containing their anions are well known (Fig. 20.26).
 
Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is formed when chlorine gas is dissolved in cold water:
Cl21aq2 1 H2O1 l 2 m HOCl1aq2 1 H11aq2 1 Cl21aq2
Note that in this reaction chlorine is both oxidized (from 0 in Cl2 to 11 in HOCl) and 
reduced (from 0 in Cl2 to 21 in Cl2). Such a reaction, in which a given element is both 
oxidized and reduced, is called a disproportionation reaction. Hypochlorous acid 
and its salts are strong oxidizing agents; their solutions are widely used as household 
bleaches and disinfectants.
 
Chlorate salts, such as KClO3, are also strong oxidizing agents and are used as 
weed killers and as oxidizers in fireworks (see Chapter 7) and explosives.
 
Fluorine forms only one oxyacid, hypofluorous acid (HOF), but it forms at least 
two oxides. When fluorine gas is bubbled into a dilute solution of sodium hydroxide, 
the compound oxygen difluoride (OF2) is formed:
4F21 g2 1 3H2O1 l 2 h 6HF1aq2 1 OF21 g2 1 O21 g2
Oxygen difluoride is a pale yellow gas (bp 5 21458C) that is a strong oxidizing agent. 
The oxide dioxygen difluoride (O2F2) is an orange solid that can be prepared by an 
electric discharge in an equimolar mixture of fluorine and oxygen gases:
F21 g2 1 O21 g2  8888n O2F21s2
The name for OF2 is oxygen difluoride 
rather than difluorine oxide because  
fluorine has a higher electronegativity than 
oxygen and thus is named as the anion.

20.14 The Group 8A Elements
The Group 8A elements, the noble gases, are characterized by filled s and p valence 
orbitals (electron configurations of 2s2 for helium and ns2np6 for the others). Because 
of their completed valence shells, these elements are very unreactive. In fact, no noble 
gas compounds were known prior to 1962. Selected properties of the Group 8A ele-
ments are summarized in Table 20.22.
 
Helium was identified by its characteristic emission spectrum as a component of the 
sun before it was found on earth. The major sources of helium on earth are natural gas 
deposits, where helium was formed from the a-particle decay of radioactive elements. 
The a particle is a helium nucleus that can easily pick up electrons from the environ-
ment to form a helium atom. Although helium forms no compounds, it is an important 
substance that is used as a coolant, as a pressurizing gas for rocket fuels, as a diluent 
in the gases used for deep-sea diving and spaceship atmospheres, and as the gas in 
lighter-than-air airships (blimps).
 
Like helium, neon forms no compounds, but it is a very useful element. For exam-
ple, neon is widely used in luminescent lighting (neon signs). Argon, which recently 
has been shown to form chemical bonds under special circumstances, is used to pro-
vide the noncorrosive atmosphere in incandescent light bulbs, which prolongs the life 
of the tungsten filament.
 
Krypton and xenon have been observed to form many stable chemical compounds. 
The first of these was prepared in 1962 by Neil Bartlett (1932-2008), an English chem-
ist who made an ionic compound that he thought had the formula XePtF6. Subsequent 
studies indicated that the compound might be better represented as XeFPtF6 and con-
tains the XeF1 and PtF62 ions.
 
Less than a year after Bartlett‚Äôs report, a group at Argonne National Laboratory 
near Chicago prepared xenon tetrafluoride by reacting xenon and fluorine gases in a 
nickel reaction vessel at 4008C and 6 atm:
Xe1 g2 1 2F21 g2 h XeF41s2
Xenon tetrafluoride forms stable colorless crystals. Two other xenon fluorides, XeF2 
and XeF6, were synthesized by the group at Argonne, and a highly explosive xenon 
oxide (XeO3) was also found. The xenon fluorides react with water to form hydrogen 
fluoride and oxycompounds. For example:
 XeF61s2 1 3H2O1 l 2 h XeO31aq2 1 6HF1aq2
 XeF61s2 1 H2O1 l 2 h XeOF41aq2 1 2HF1 aq2
 
In the past 35 years, other xenon compounds have been prepared. Examples are 
XeO4 (explosive), XeOF4, XeOF2, and XeO3F2. These compounds contain discrete 
molecules with covalent bonds between the xenon atom and the other atoms. A few 
compounds of krypton, such as KrF2 and KrF4, have also been observed. The struc-
tures of several known xenon compounds are shown in Fig. 20.27. Radon also has 
been shown to form compounds similar to those of xenon and krypton.

gray tin given in this chapter, which form would you expect to 
have the more ordered structure (have the smaller positional 
probability)?
 107. Lead forms compounds in the 12 and 14 oxidation states. All 
lead(II) halides are known (and are known to be ionic). Only 
PbF4 and PbCl4 are known among the possible lead(IV) 
halides. Presumably lead(IV) oxidizes bromide and iodide 
ions, producing the lead(II) halide and the free halogen:
PbX4 h PbX2 1 X2
Suppose 25.00 g of a lead(IV) halide reacts to form 16.12 g of 
a lead(II) halide and the free halogen. Identify the halogen.
 108. Many structures of phosphorus-containing compounds are 
drawn with some P w  O bonds. These bonds are not the typical 
p bonds we‚Äôve considered, which involve the overlap of two p 
orbitals. Instead, they result from the overlap of a d orbital on 
the phosphorus atom with a p orbital on oxygen. This type of 
p bonding is sometimes used as an explanation for why H3PO3 
has the first structure below rather than the second:
P

Draw a picture showing how a d orbital and a p orbital overlap 
to form a p bond.
 109. Use bond energies (see Table 8.5) to show that the preferred 
products for the decomposition of N2O3 are NO2 and NO rather 
than O2 and N2O. (The NOO single bond energy is 201 kJ/mol.) 
(Hint: Consider the reaction kinetics.)

Marie Curie in 1898. Radium was initially isolated from the 
uranium ore pitchblende, in which it is present as approxi-
mately 1.0 g per 7.0 metric tons of pitchblende. How many 
atoms of radium can be isolated from 1.75 3 108 g pitch-
blende (1 metric ton 5 1000 kg)? One of the early uses of 
radium was as an additive to paint so that watch dials coated 
with this paint would glow in the dark. The longest-lived iso-
tope of radium has a half-life of 1.60 3 103 years. If an antique

ransition metals have many uses in our society. Iron is used for steel; copper for 
electrical wiring and water pipes; titanium for paint; silver for photographic 
paper; manganese, chromium, vanadium, and cobalt as additives to steel; platinum for 
industrial and automotive catalysts; and so on.
One indication of the importance of transition metals is the great concern shown by 
the U.S. government for continuing the supply of these elements. In recent years the 
United States has been a net importer of about 60 ‚Äústrategic and critical‚Äù minerals, 
including cobalt, manganese, platinum, palladium, and chromium. All these metals 
play a vital role in the U.S. economy and defense, and approximately 90% of the 
required amounts must be imported (Table 21.1).
In addition to being important in industry, transition metal ions play a vital role in 
living organisms. For example, complexes of iron provide for the transport and storage 
of oxygen, molybdenum and iron compounds are catalysts in nitrogen fixation, zinc is 
found in more than 150 biomolecules in humans, copper and iron play a crucial role in 
the  respiratory cycle, and cobalt is found in essential biomolecules such as vitamin B12.
In this chapter we will explore the general properties of transition metals, paying 
particular attention to the bonding, structure, and properties of the complex ions of 
these metals.
21.1 The Transition Metals: A Survey
General Properties
One striking characteristic of the representative elements is that their chemistry 
changes markedly across a given period as the number of valence electrons changes. 
The chemical similarities occur mainly within the vertical groups. In contrast, the 
transition metals show great similarities within a given period as well as within a 
given vertical group. This difference occurs because the last electrons added for transi-
tion metals are inner electrons: d electrons for the d-block transition metals and f elec-
trons for the lanthanides and actinides. These inner d and f electrons cannot participate 
as easily in bonding as can the valence s and p electrons. Thus the chemistry of the 
transition elements is not affected as greatly by the gradual change in the number of 
electrons as is the chemistry of the representative elements.
Group designations are traditionally given on the periodic table for the d-block 
transition metals (Fig. 21.1). However, these designations do not relate as directly to 
the chemical behavior of these elements as they do for the representative elements (the 
A groups), so we will not use them.

As a class, the transition metals behave as typical metals, possessing metallic luster 
and relatively high electrical and thermal conductivities. Silver is the best conductor of 
heat and electric current. However, copper is a close second, which explains copper‚Äôs 
wide use in the electrical systems of homes and factories.
 
Despite their many similarities, the transition metals do vary considerably in certain 
properties. For example, tungsten has a melting point of 34008C and is used for fila-
ments in light bulbs; mercury is a liquid at 258C. Some transition metals such as iron 
and  titanium are hard and strong and make very useful structural materials; others such 
as copper, gold, and silver are relatively soft. The chemical reactivity of the transition 
metals also varies significantly. Some react readily with oxygen to form oxides. Of 
these metals, some, such as chromium, nickel, and cobalt, form oxides that adhere 
tightly to the metallic surface, protecting the metal from further oxidation. Others, 
such as iron, form oxides that scale off, constantly exposing new metal to the corrosion 
process. On the other hand, the noble metals‚Äîprimarily gold, silver, platinum, and 
palladium‚Äîdo not readily form oxides.
 
In forming ionic compounds with nonmetals, the transition metals exhibit several 
typical characteristics:
More than one oxidation state is often found. For example, iron combines with 
chlorine to form FeCl2 and FeCl3.

The cations are often complex ions, species where the transition metal ion is sur-
rounded by a certain number of ligands (molecules or ions that behave as Lewis 
bases). For example, the compound [Co(NH3)6]Cl3 contains the Co(NH3)631 cation 
and Cl2 anions.

Most compounds are colored, because the transition metal ion in the complex ion 
can absorb visible light of specific wavelengths.
Many compounds are paramagnetic (they contain unpaired electrons).
 
In this chapter we will concentrate on the first-row transition metals (scandium 
through zinc) because they are representative of the other transition series and because 
they have great practical significance. Some important properties of these elements are 
summarized in Table 21.2 and are discussed in the next section.
Electron Configurations
The electron configurations of the first-row transition metals were discussed in Section 
7.11. The 3d orbitals begin to fill after the 4s orbital is complete, that is, after calcium 
([Ar]4s2). The first transition metal, scandium, has one electron in the 3d orbitals; the

second, titanium, has two; and the third, vanadium, has three. We would expect chro-
mium, the fourth transition metal, to have the electron configuration [Ar]4s23d4. How-
ever, the actual configuration is [Ar]4s13d5, which shows a half-filled 4s orbital and a 
half-filled set of 3d orbitals (one electron in each of the five 3d orbitals). It is tempting 
to say that the configuration results because half-filled ‚Äúshells‚Äù are especially stable. 
Although there are some reasons to think that this explanation might be valid, it is an 
oversimplification. For instance, tungsten, which is in the same vertical group as chro-
mium, has the configuration [Xe]6s24f 145d4, where half-filled s and d shells are not 
found. There are several similar cases.
 
Basically, the chromium configuration occurs because the energies of the 3d and 4s 
orbitals are very similar for the first-row transition elements. We saw in Section 7.11 
that when electrons are placed in a set of degenerate orbitals, they first occupy each 
orbital singly to minimize electron repulsions. Since the 4s and 3d orbitals are virtually 
degenerate in the chromium atom, we would expect the configuration
 
4s __h 
3d __h  __h __h __h __h
rather than
 
4s __
hg 
3d __h __h __h __h __
since the second arrangement has greater electron‚Äìelectron repulsions and thus a 
higher energy.
 
The only other unexpected configuration among the first-row transition metals is 
that of copper, which is [Ar]4s13d10 rather than the expected [Ar]4s23d9.
 
In contrast to the neutral transition metals, where the 3d and 4s orbitals have very 
similar energies, the energy of the 3d orbitals in transition metal ions is significantly 
less than that of the 4s orbital. This means that the electrons remaining after the ion is 
formed occupy the 3d orbitals, since they are lower in energy. First-row transition 
metal ions do not have 4s electrons. For example, manganese has the configuration 
[Ar]4s23d5, while that of Mn21 is [Ar]3d5. The neutral titanium atom has the configura-
tion [Ar]4s23d2, while that of Ti31 is [Ar]3d1.
Chromium has the electron configuration 
[Ar]4s13d5.
A set of orbitals with the same energy is 
said to be degenerate.
Copper has the electron configuration 
[Ar]4s13d10.
In transition metal ions, the 3d orbitals are 
lower in energy than the 4s orbitals.

Oxidation States and Ionization Energies
The transition metals can form a variety of ions by losing one or more electrons. The 
common oxidation states of these elements are shown in Table 21.2. Note that for the 
first five metals the maximum possible oxidation state corresponds to the loss of all 
the 4s and 3d electrons. For example, the maximum oxidation state of chromium 
([Ar]4s13d5) is 16. Toward the right end of the period, the maximum oxidation states 
are not observed; in fact, the 21 ions are the most common. The higher oxidation 
states are not seen for these metals because the 3d orbitals become lower in energy as 
the nuclear charge increases, and the electrons become increasingly difficult to remove. 
From Table 21.2 we see that ionization energy increases gradually going from left to 
right across the period. However, the third ionization energy (when an electron is 
removed from a 3d orbital) increases faster than the first ionization energy, clear evi-
dence of the significant decrease in the energy of the 3d orbitals going across the 
period (Fig. 21.2).
Standard Reduction Potentials
When a metal acts as a reducing agent, the half-reaction is
M h Mn1 1 ne2
This is the reverse of the conventional listing for half-reactions in tables. Thus, to rank 
the transition metals in order of reducing ability, it is most convenient to reverse the 
reactions and the signs given in Table 21.2. The metal with the most positive potential 
is then the best reducing agent. The transition metals are listed in order of reducing 
ability in Table 21.3.
 
Since %¬∞ is zero for the process
2H1 1 2e2 h H2
all the metals except copper can reduce H1 ions to hydrogen gas in 1 M aqueous solu-
tions of strong acid:
M1s2 1 2H11aq2 h H21 g2 1 M211aq2
As Table 21.3 shows, the reducing abilities of the first-row transition metals generally 
decrease going from left to right across the period. Only chromium and zinc do not 
follow this trend.

The 4d and 5d Transition Series
In comparing the 3d, 4d, and 5d transition series, it is instructive to consider the atomic 
radii of these elements (Fig. 21.3). Note that there is a general, although not regular, 
decrease in size going from left to right for each of the series. Also note that although 
there is a significant increase in radius in going from the 3d to the 4d metals, the 4d and 
5d metals are remarkably similar in size. This latter phenomenon is the result of the 
lanthanide contraction. In the lanthanide series, consisting of the elements between 
lanthanum and hafnium (see Fig. 21.1), electrons are filling the 4f orbitals. Since the 
4f orbitals are buried in the interior of these atoms, the additional electrons do not add 
to the atomic size. In fact, the increasing nuclear charge (remember that a proton is 
added to the nucleus for each electron) causes the radii of the lanthanide elements to 
decrease significantly going from left to right. This lanthanide contraction just offsets 
the normal increase in size due to going from one principal quantum level to another. 
Thus the 5d elements, instead of being significantly larger than the 4d elements, are 
almost identical to them in size. This leads to a great similarity in the chemistry of the 
4d and 5d elements in a given vertical group. For example, the chemical properties of 
hafnium and zirconium are remarkably similar, and they always occur together in 
nature. Their separation, which is probably more difficult than the separation of any 
other pair of elements, often requires fractional distillation of their compounds.
In general, the differences between the 4d and 5d elements in a group increase 
gradually going from left to right. For example, niobium and tantalum are also quite 
similar, but less so than zirconium and hafnium.
Although generally less well known than the 3d elements, the 4d and 5d transition 
metals have certain very useful properties. For example, zirconium and zirconium oxide 
(ZrO2) have great resistance to high temperatures and are used, along with niobium and 
molybdenum alloys, for space vehicle parts that are exposed to high temperatures dur-
ing re-entry into the earth‚Äôs atmosphere. Niobium and molybdenum are also important 
alloying materials for certain types of steel. Tantalum, which has a high resistance to 
attack by body fluids, is often used for replacement of bones. The platinum group 
 metals‚Äîruthenium,  osmium, rhodium, iridium, palladium, and platinum‚Äîare all quite 
similar and are widely used as catalysts for many types of industrial processes.
21.2 The First-Row Transition Metals
We have seen that the transition metals are similar in many ways but also show impor-
tant differences. We will now explore some of the specific properties of each of the 3d 
transition metals.
Scandium is a rare element that exists in compounds mainly in the 13 oxidation 
state‚Äîfor example, in ScCl3, Sc2O3, and Sc2(SO4)3. The chemistry of scandium 
Niobium was originally called columbium 
and is still occasionally referred to by that 
name.

strongly resembles that of the lanthanides, with most of its compounds being colorless 
and diamagnetic. This is not surprising; as we will see in Section 21.6, the color and 
magnetism of transition metal compounds usually arise from the d electrons on the 
metal ion, and Sc31 has no d electrons. Scandium metal, which can be prepared by 
electrolysis of molten ScCl3, is not widely used because of its rarity, but it is found in 
some electronic devices, such as high-intensity lamps.
 
Titanium is widely distributed in the earth‚Äôs crust (0.6% by mass). Because of its 
relatively low density and high strength, titanium is an excellent structural material, 
especially in jet engines, where light weight and stability at high temperatures are 
required. Nearly 5000 kg of titanium alloys is used in each engine of a Boeing 747 
jetliner. In addition, the resistance of titanium to chemical attack makes it a useful 
material for pipes, pumps, and reaction vessels in the chemical industry.
 
The most familiar compound of titanium is no doubt responsible for the white color 
of this paper. Titanium dioxide, or more correctly, titanium(IV) oxide (TiO2), is a 
highly opaque substance used as the white pigment in paper, paint, linoleum, plastics, 
synthetic fibers, whitewall tires, and cosmetics (sunscreens, for example). Over one 
million tons is used annually in these and other products. Titanium(IV) oxide is widely 
dispersed in nature, but the main ores are rutile (impure TiO2) and ilmenite (FeTiO3). 
Rutile is processed by treatment with chlorine to form volatile TiCl4, which is sepa-
rated from the impurities and burned to form TiO2:
TiCl41 g2 1 O21 g2 h TiO21s2 1 2Cl21 g2
Ilmenite is treated with sulfuric acid to form a soluble sulfate:
FeTiO31s2 1 2H2SO41aq2 h Fe211aq2 1 TiO211aq2 1 2SO4
221aq2 1 2H2O1 l 2
When this aqueous mixture is allowed to stand, under vacuum, solid FeSO4 ? 7H2O 
forms first and is removed. The mixture is then heated, and the insoluble titanium(IV) 
oxide hydrate (TiO2 ? H2O) forms. The water of hydration is driven off by heating to 
form pure TiO2:
TiO2 # H2O1s2 h
Heat
TiO21s2 1 H2O1 g2
 
In its compounds, titanium is most often found in the 14 oxidation state. Examples 
are TiO2 and TiCl4, the latter a colorless liquid (bp 5 1378C) that fumes in moist air to 
produce TiO2:
TiCl41 l 2 1 2H2O1 l 2 h TiO21s2 1 4HCl1 g2
Titanium(III) compounds can be produced by reduction of the 14 state. In aqueous 
solution, Ti31 exists as the purple Ti(H2O)631 ion, which is slowly oxidized to 
titanium(IV) by air. Titanium(II) is not stable in aqueous solution but does exist in the 
solid state in compounds such as TiO and the dihalides of general formula TiX2.
 
Vanadium is widely spread throughout the earth‚Äôs crust (0.02% by mass). It is used 
mostly in alloys with other metals such as iron (80% of vanadium is used in steel) and 
titanium. Vanadium(V) oxide (V2O5) is used as an industrial catalyst in the production 
of materials such as sulfuric acid.
 
Pure vanadium can be obtained from the electrolytic reduction of fused salts, such 
as VCl2, to produce a metal similar to titanium that is steel gray, hard, and corrosion 
resistant. Often the pure element is not required for alloying. For example, ferrovana-
dium, produced by the reduction of a mixture of V2O5 and Fe2O3 with aluminum, is 
added to iron to form vanadium steel, a hard steel used for engine parts and axles.
 
The principal oxidation state of vanadium is 15, found in compounds such as the 
orange V2O5 (mp 5 6508C) and the colorless VF5 (mp 5 19.58C). The oxidation states 
from 15 to 12 all exist in aqueous solution (Table 21.4). The higher oxidation states, 
15 and 14, do not exist as hydrated ions of the type Vn1(aq) because the highly 
charged ion causes the attached water molecules to be very acidic. The H1 ions are lost 
to give the oxycations VO21 and VO21. The hydrated V31 and V21 ions are easily oxi-
dized and thus can function as reducing agents in aqueous solution.
The manufacture of sulfuric acid was 
 discussed at the end of Chapter 3.
The most common oxidation state for 
vanadium is 15.

Although chromium is relatively rare, it is a very important industrial material. The 
chief ore of chromium is chromite (FeCr2O4), which can be reduced by carbon to give 
ferrochrome,
FeCr2O41s2 1 4C1s2 h Fe1s2 1 2Cr1s2 1 4CO1 g2
Ferrochrome
which can be added directly to iron in the steelmaking process. Chromium metal, 
which is often used to plate steel, is hard and brittle and maintains a bright surface by 
developing a tough invisible oxide coating.
Chromium commonly forms compounds in which it has the oxidation state 12, 
13, or 16, as shown in Table 21.5. The Cr21 (chromous) ion is a powerful reducing 
agent in aqueous solution. In fact, traces of O2 in other gases can be removed by bub-
bling through a Cr21 solution:
4Cr211aq2 1 O21 g2 1 4H11aq2 h 4Cr311aq2 1 2H2O1 l 2
The chromium(VI) species are excellent oxidizing agents, especially in acidic solu-
tion, where chromium(VI) as the dichromate ion (Cr2O722) is reduced to the Cr31 ion:

 221aq2 1 14H11aq2 1 6e2 h 2Cr311aq2 1 7H2O1 l 2¬†¬†¬†¬†%¬∞ 5 1.33 V
The oxidizing ability of the dichromate ion is strongly pH-dependent, increasing as 
[H1] increases, as predicted by Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs principle. In basic solution, chromium(VI) 
exists as the chromate ion, a much less powerful oxidizing agent:

The structures of the Cr2O722 and CrO422 ions are shown in Fig. 21.4.

itanium dioxide, more properly 
called titanium(IV) oxide, is a very 
important material. Approximately  
1.5 million tons of the substance is 
produced each year in the United 
States for use as a pigment in paper 
and paints and as a component of 
sunscreens.
Scientists, however, have found a 
different use for TiO2. When surfaces are 
coated with titanium dioxide, they 
become resistant to dirt and bacteria. 
For example, the Pilkington Glass Com-
pany makes glass coated with TiO2 that 
cleans itself. All the glass needs is sun 
and rain to keep itself clean. The self-
cleaning action arises from two effects. 
First, the coating of TiO2 acts as a cata-
lyst in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) 
light to break down carbon-based 
pollutants to carbon dioxide and water. 
Second, because TiO2 reduces surface 
tension, rainwater ‚Äúsheets‚Äù instead of 
forming droplets on the glass, thereby 
washing away the grime on the surface 
of the glass. Although this self-cleaning 
glass is bad news for window washers, 
it could save millions of dollars in main-
tenance costs for owners of commercial 
buildings.
Because the TiO2-treated glass 
requires UV light for its action, it does 
not work well for interior surfaces 
where UV light is present only in small 
amounts. However, a team of Japanese 
researchers has found that if the TiO2 
 coating is doped with nitrogen atoms, 
it will catalyze the breakdown of dirt in 
the presence of visible light as well as 
UV light. Studies also show that this 
N-doped TiO2 surface coating kills 
many types of bacteria in the presence 
of  visible or ultraviolet light. This dis-
covery could lead to products such as 
self-sterilizing bathroom tiles, counters, 
and toilets. In addition, because the 
TiO2 on the surface of glass has such a 
strong attraction for water molecules 
(greatly lowering the surface tension), 
water does not bead up to form drop-
lets. Just as this effect produces sheet-
ing action on exterior glass, so it 
prevents interior windows and mirrors 
from ‚Äúfogging up.‚Äù
Titanium dioxide, a cheap and plen-
tiful material, may prove to be worth its 
weight in gold as a surface coating.

Red chromium(VI) oxide (CrO3) dissolves in water to give a strongly acidic, red-
orange solution:
2CrO31s2 1 H2O1 l 2 h 2H11aq2 1 Cr2O7
 221aq2
It is possible to precipitate bright orange dichromate salts, such as K2Cr2O7, from these 
solutions. When made basic, the solution turns yellow, and chromate salts such as 
Na2CrO4 can be obtained. A mixture of chromium(VI) oxide and concentrated sulfuric 
acid, commonly called cleaning solution, is a powerful oxidizing medium that can 
remove organic materials from analytical glassware, yielding a very clean surface.
 
Manganese is relatively abundant (0.1% of the earth‚Äôs crust), although no signifi-
cant sources are found in the United States. The most common use of manganese is in 
the production of an especially hard steel used for rock crushers, bank vaults, and 
armor plate. One interesting source of manganese is from manganese nodules found 
on the ocean floor. These roughly spherical ‚Äúrocks‚Äù contain mixtures of manganese 
and iron oxides as well as smaller amounts of other metals such as cobalt, nickel, and 
copper. Apparently, the nodules were formed at least partly by the action of marine 
organisms. Because of the abundance of these nodules, there is much interest in devel-
oping economical methods for their recovery and processing.
 
Manganese can exist in all oxidation states from 12 to 17, although 12 and 17 
are the most common. Manganese(II) forms an extensive series of salts with all the 
common anions. In aqueous solution Mn21 forms Mn(H2O)621, which has a light pink 
color. Manganese(VII) is found in the intensely purple permanganate ion (MnO42). 
Widely used as an analytical reagent in acidic solution, the MnO42 ion behaves as a 
strong oxidizing agent, with the manganese becoming Mn21:

Several typical compounds of manganese are shown in Table 21.6.
 
Iron is the most abundant heavy metal (4.7% of the earth‚Äôs crust) and the most 
important to our civilization. It is a white, lustrous, not particularly hard metal that is 
very reactive toward oxidizing agents. For example, in moist air it is rapidly oxidized 
by oxygen to form rust, a mixture of iron oxides.
 
The chemistry of iron involves mainly its 12 and 13 oxidation states. Typical 
compounds are listed in Table 21.7. In aqueous solutions iron(II) salts are generally 
light green because of the presence of Fe(H2O)621. Although the Fe(H2O)631 ion is 
 colorless, aqueous solutions of iron(III) salts are usually yellow to brown in color due 
to the presence of Fe(OH)(H2O)521, which results from the acidity of Fe(H2O)631 
(Ka 5 6 3 1023):
Fe1H2O2 6

Although cobalt is relatively rare, it is found in ores such as smaltite (CoAs2) and 
cobaltite (CoAsS) in large enough concentrations to make its production economically 
feasible. Cobalt is a hard, bluish white metal mainly used in alloys such as stainless steel 
and stellite, an alloy of iron, copper, and tungsten that is used in surgical instruments.

The chemistry of cobalt involves mainly its 12 and 13 oxidation states, although 
compounds containing cobalt in the 0, 11, or 14 oxidation state are known. Aqueous 
solutions of cobalt(II) salts contain the Co(H2O)621 ion, which has a characteristic rose 
color. Cobalt forms a wide variety of coordination compounds, many of which will be 
discussed in later sections of this chapter. Some typical cobalt compounds are listed in 
Table 21.8.
 
Nickel, which ranks twenty-fourth in elemental abundance in the earth‚Äôs crust, is 
found in ores, where it is combined mainly with arsenic, antimony, and sulfur. Nickel 
metal, a silvery white substance with high electrical and thermal conductivities, is 
quite resistant to corrosion and is often used for plating more active metals. Nickel is 
also widely used in the production of alloys such as steel.
 
Nickel in compounds is almost exclusively in the 12 oxidation state. Aqueous solu-
tions of nickel(II) salts contain the Ni(H2O)621 ion, which has a characteristic emerald 
green color. Coordination compounds of nickel(II) will be discussed later in this chap-
ter. Some typical nickel compounds are listed in Table 21.9.
 
Copper, widely distributed in nature in ores containing sulfides, arsenides, chlo-
rides, and carbonates, is valued for its high electrical conductivity and its resistance to 
corrosion. It is widely used for plumbing, and 50% of all copper produced annually is 
used for electrical applications. Copper is a major constituent in several well-known 
alloys (Table 21.10).
 
Although copper is not highly reactive (it will not reduce H1 to H2, for example), 
the reddish metal does slowly corrode in air, producing the characteristic green patina 
consisting of basic copper sulfate
3Cu1s2 1 2H2O1 l 2 1 SO21 g2 1 2O21 g2 h Cu31OH2 4SO41s2
 
Basic copper sulfate
and other similar compounds.
 
The chemistry of copper principally involves the 12 oxidation state, but many 
compounds containing copper(I) are also known. Aqueous solutions of copper(II) salts 
are a characteristic bright blue color due to the presence of the Cu(H2O)621 ion. Table 
21.11 lists some typical copper compounds.
 
Although trace amounts of copper are essential for life, copper in large amounts is 
quite toxic; copper salts are used to kill bacteria, fungi, and algae. For example, paints 
containing copper are used on ship hulls to prevent fouling by marine organisms.
 
Widely dispersed in the earth‚Äôs crust, zinc is refined mainly from sphalerite (ZnS), 
which often occurs with galena (PbS). Zinc is a white, lustrous, very active metal that 
behaves as an excellent reducing agent and tarnishes rapidly. About 90% of the zinc 
produced is used for galvanizing steel. Zinc forms colorless salts in the 12 oxidation 
state.
Copper roofs and bronze statues, such 
as the Statue of Liberty, turn green in air 
 because Cu3(OH)4SO4 and Cu4(OH)6SO4 form.

21.3 Coordination Compounds
Transition metal ions characteristically form coordination compounds, which are usu-
ally colored and often paramagnetic. A coordination compound typically consists of 
a complex ion, a transition metal ion with its attached ligands (see Section 15.8), and 
counterions, anions or cations as needed to produce a compound with no net charge. 
The substance [Co(NH3)5Cl]Cl2 is a typical coordination compound. The brackets 
indicate the composition of the complex ion, in this case Co(NH3)5Cl21, and the two 
Cl2 counterions are shown outside the brackets. Note that in this compound one Cl2
acts as a ligand along with the five NH3 molecules. In the solid state this compound 
consists of the large Co(NH3)5Cl21 cations and twice as many Cl2 anions, all packed 
together as efficiently as possible. When dissolved in water, the solid behaves like  
any ionic solid; the cations and anions are assumed to separate and move about 
independently:
3Co1NH32 5Cl4Cl21s2 h
H2O
Co1NH32 5Cl211aq2 1 2Cl21aq2
Coordination compounds have been known since about 1700, but their true nature 
was not understood until the 1890s when a young Swiss chemist named Alfred 
Werner (1866‚Äì1919) proposed that transition metal ions have two types of valence 
(combining ability). One type of valence, which Werner called the secondary 
valence, refers to the ability of a metal ion to bind to Lewis bases (ligands) to form 
complex ions. The other type, the primary valence, refers to the ability of the metal 
ion to form ionic bonds with oppositely charged ions. Thus Werner explained that 
the compound, originally written as CoCl3 ? 5NH3, was really [Co(NH3)5Cl]Cl2, 
where the Co31 ion has a primary valence of 3, satisfied by the three Cl2 ions, and a 
secondary valence of 6, satisfied by the six ligands (five NH3 and one Cl2). We now 
call the primary valence the oxidation state and the secondary valence the coordi-
nation number, which reflects the number of bonds formed between the metal ion 
and the ligands in the complex ion.
Coordination Number
The number of bonds formed by metal ions to ligands in complex ions varies from two 
to eight depending on the size, charge, and electron configuration of the transition 
metal ion. As shown in Table 21.12, 6 is the most common coordination number, fol-
lowed closely by 4, with a few metal ions showing a coordination number of 2. Many 
metal ions show more than one coordination number, and there is really no simple way 
to predict what the coordination number will be in a particular case. The typical geom-
etries for the various common coordination numbers are shown in Fig. 21.5. Note that 
six ligands produce an octahedral arrangement around the metal ion. Four ligands can 
form either a tetrahedral or a square planar arrangement, and two ligands give a linear 
structure.

Ligands
A ligand is a neutral molecule or ion having a lone electron pair that can be used to 
form a bond to a metal ion. The formation of a metal‚Äìligand bond therefore can be 
described as the interaction between a Lewis base (the ligand) and a Lewis acid (the 
metal ion). The resulting bond is often called a coordinate covalent bond.
 
A ligand that can form one bond to a metal ion is called a monodentate ligand, or 
a unidentate ligand (from root words meaning ‚Äúone tooth‚Äù). Examples of unidentate 
ligands are shown in Table 21.13.
 
Some ligands have more than one atom with a lone electron pair that can be used to 
bond to a metal ion. Such ligands are said to be chelating ligands, or chelates (from 
the Greek word chele for ‚Äúclaw‚Äù). A ligand that can form two bonds to a metal ion is 
called a bidentate ligand. A very common bidentate ligand is ethylenediamine (abbre-
viated en), which is shown coordinating to a metal ion in Fig. 21.6(a). Note the rela-
tionship between this ligand and the unidentate ligand ammonia [Fig. 21.6(b)]. 
Oxalate, another typical bidentate ligand, is shown in Table 21.13.
 
Ligands that can form more than two bonds to a metal ion are called polydentate 
ligands. Some ligands can form as many as six bonds to a metal ion. The best-known 
example is ethylenediaminetetraacetate (abbreviated EDTA), which is shown in Table 
21.13. This ligand virtually surrounds the metal ion (Fig. 21.7), coordinating through 
six atoms (a hexadentate ligand). As might be expected from the large number of coor-
dination sites, EDTA forms very stable complex ions with most metal ions and is used 
as a ‚Äúscavenger‚Äù to remove toxic heavy metals such as lead from the human body. It is 
also used as a reagent to analyze solutions for their metal ion content. EDTA is found

in countless consumer products, such as soda, beer, salad dressings, bar soaps, and 
most cleaners. In these products EDTA ties up trace metal ions that would otherwise 
catalyze decomposition and produce unwanted precipitates.
 
Some even more complicated ligands are found in biological systems, where metal 
ions play crucial roles in catalyzing reactions, transferring electrons, and transporting 
and storing oxygen. A discussion of these complex ligands will follow in Section 21.7.
Nomenclature
In Werner‚Äôs lifetime, no system was used to name coordination compounds. Names of 
the compounds were commonly based on colors and names of discoverers. As the field 
expanded and more coordination compounds were identified, an orderly system of 
nomenclature became necessary. A simplified version of this system is summarized by 
the following rules.
Rules for Naming Coordination Compounds
 
¬ª As with any ionic compound, the cation is named before the anion.
 
¬ª In naming a complex ion, the ligands are named before the metal ion.
 
¬ª In naming ligands, an o is added to the root name of an anion. For example, 
the halides as ligands are called fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo; hydroxide is 
hydroxo; cyanide is cyano; and so on. For a neutral ligand, the name of the 
molecule is used, with the exception of H2O, NH3, CO, and NO, as illustrated 
in Table 21.14.
 
¬ª The prefixes mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexa- are used to denote the 
number of simple ligands. The prefixes bis-, tris-, tetrakis-, and so on are also 
used, especially for more complicated ligands or ones that already contain di-, 
tri-, and so on.
 
¬ª The oxidation state of the central metal ion is designated by a Roman numeral 
in parentheses.
 
¬ª When more than one type of ligand is present, they are named alphabetically.* 
Prefixes do not affect the order.
 
¬ª If the complex ion has a negative charge, the suffix -ate is added to the name 
of the metal. Sometimes the Latin name is used to identify the metal (Table 
21.15).
 
The application of these rules is shown in Example 21.1.
*In an older system the negatively charged ligands were named first, then neutral ligands, with 
positively charged ligands named last. We will follow the newer convention in this text.

Naming Coordination Compounds I
Give the systematic name for each of the following coordination compounds.
a. [Co(NH3)5Cl]Cl2
b. K3Fe(CN)6
c. [Fe(en)2(NO2)2]2SO4
 
SOLUTION 
a.  To determine the oxidation state of the metal ion, we examine the charges of all  
ligands and counterions. The ammonia molecules are neutral and each of the 
chloride ions has a 12 charge, so the cobalt ion must have a 31 charge to pro-
duce a neutral compound. Thus cobalt has the oxidation state 13, and we use 
cobalt(III) in the name.
 
The ligands include one Cl2 ion and five NH3 molecules. The chloride ion is 
designated as chloro, and each ammonia molecule is designated as ammine. The 
prefix penta- indicates that there are five NH3 ligands present. The name of the 
complex cation is therefore pentaamminechlorocobalt(III). Note that the ligands 
are named alphabetically, disregarding the prefix. Since the counterions are chlo-
ride ions, the compound is named as a chloride salt:
Pentaamminechlorocobalt(III) chloride
 
Cation 
Anion
b. First, we determine the oxidation state of the iron by considering the other 
charged species. The compound contains three K1 ions and six CN2 ions. There-
fore, the iron must carry a charge of 31, giving a total of six positive charges to 
balance the six negative charges. The complex ion present is thus Fe(CN)632. The 
cyanide ligands are each designated cyano, and the prefix hexa- indicates that six 
are present. Since the complex ion is an anion, we use the Latin name ferrate. 
The oxidation state is indicated by (III) at the end of the name. The anion name is 
therefore hexacyanoferrate(III). The cations are K1 ions, which are simply named 
potassium. Putting this together gives the name
Potassium hexacyanoferrate(III)
 
Cation 
Anion
(The common name of this compound is potassium ferricyanide.)
c. We first determine the oxidation state of the iron by looking at the other charged 
species: four NO22 ions and one SO422 ion. The ethylenediamine is neutral. Thus 
the two iron ions must carry a total positive charge of 6 to balance the six nega-
tive charges. This means that each iron has a 13 oxidation state and is designated 
as iron(III).
 
Since the name ethylenediamine already contains di, we use bis- instead of 
di- to indicate the two en ligands. The name for NO22 as a ligand is nitro, and the 
prefix di- indicates the presence of two NO22 ligands. Since the anion is sulfate, 
the compound‚Äôs name is
Bis(ethylenediamine)dinitroiron(III) sulfate
 
Cation 
Anion
Because the complex ion is a cation, the Latin name for iron is not used.

Naming Coordination Compounds II
Given the following systematic names, give the formula of each coordination 
compound.
a. Triamminebromoplatinum(II) chloride
b. Potassium hexafluorocobaltate(III)
SOLUTION
a. Triammine signifies three ammonia ligands, and bromo indicates one bromide ion as 
a ligand. The oxidation state of platinum is 12, as indicated by the Roman 
numeral II. Thus the complex ion is [Pt(NH3)3Br]1. One chloride ion is needed to 
balance the 11 charge of this cation. The formula of the compound is 
[Pt(NH3)3Br]Cl. Note that brackets enclose the complex ion.
b. The complex ion contains six fluoride ligands attached to a Co31 ion to give 
CoF632. Note that the -ate ending indicates that the complex ion is an anion. The 
cations are K1 ions, and three are required to balance the 32 charge on the com-
plex ion. Thus the formula is K3[CoF6].
See Exercises 21.39 and 21.40
21.4 Isomerism
When two or more species have the same formula but different properties, they are said 
to be isomers. Although isomers contain exactly the same types and numbers of atoms, 
the arrangements of the atoms differ, and this leads to different properties. We will 
consider two main types of isomerism: structural isomerism, where the isomers con-
tain the same atoms but one or more bonds differ, and stereoisomerism, where all the 
bonds in the isomers are the same but the spatial arrangements of the atoms are differ-
ent. Each of these classes also has subclasses (Fig. 21.8), which we will now consider.
Structural Isomerism
The first type of structural isomerism we will consider is coordination isomerism, in 
which the composition of the complex ion varies. For example, [Cr(NH3)5SO4]Br and 
[Cr(NH3)5Br]SO4 are coordination isomers. In the first case, SO422 is coordinated to 
Cr31, and Br2 is the counterion; in the second case, the roles of these ions are reversed.

Another example of coordination isomerism is the [Co(en)3][Cr(ox)3] and [Cr(en)3] 
[Co(ox)3] pair, where ox represents the oxalate ion, a bidentate ligand shown in Table 
21.13.
 
In a second type of structural isomerism, linkage isomerism, the composition of 
the complex ion is the same, but the point of attachment of at least one of the ligands 
differs. Two ligands that can attach to metal ions in different ways are thiocyanate 
(SCN2), which can bond through lone electron pairs on the nitrogen or the sulfur 
atom, and the nitrite ion (NO22), which can bond through lone electron pairs on the 
nitrogen or the oxygen atom. For example, the following two compounds are linkage 
isomers:
3Co1NH32 41NO22Cl4Cl
Tetraamminechloronitrocobalt(III) chloride
(yellow)
3Co1NH32 41ONO2Cl4Cl
Tetraamminechloronitritocobalt(III) chloride
(red)
In the first case, the NO22 ligand is called nitro and is attached to Co31 through the 
nitrogen atom; in the second case, the NO22 ligand is called nitrito and is attached to 
Co31 through an oxygen atom (Fig. 21.9).
Stereoisomerism
Stereoisomers have the same bonds but different spatial arrangements of the atoms. 
One type, geometrical isomerism, or cis‚Äìtrans isomerism, occurs when atoms or 
groups of atoms can assume different positions around a rigid ring or bond. An impor-
tant example is the compound Pt(NH3)2Cl2, which has a square planar structure. The 
two possible arrangements of the ligands are shown in Fig. 21.10. In the trans isomer, 
the ammonia molecules are across (trans) from each other. In the cis isomer, the 
ammonia molecules are next (cis) to each other.
 
Geometrical isomerism also occurs in octahedral complex ions. For example, the 
compound [Co(NH3)4Cl2]Cl has cis and trans isomers (Fig. 21.11).
 
A second type of stereoisomerism is called optical isomerism because the isomers 
have opposite effects on plane-polarized light. When light is emitted from a source

such as a glowing filament, the oscillating electric fields of the photons in the beam are 
oriented randomly, as shown in Fig. 21.12. If this light is passed through a polarizer, 
only the photons with electric fields oscillating in a single plane remain, constituting 
plane-polarized light.
 
In 1815, a French physicist, Jean Biot (1774‚Äì1862), showed that certain crystals 
could rotate the plane of polarization of light. Later it was found that solutions of cer-
tain compounds could do the same thing (Fig. 21.13). Louis Pasteur (1822‚Äì1895) was 
the first to understand this behavior. In 1848 he noted that solid sodium ammonium 
tartrate (NaNH4C4H4O4) existed as a mixture of two types of crystals, which he pains-
takingly separated with tweezers. Separate solutions of these two types of crystals 
rotated plane-polarized light in exactly opposite directions. This led to a connection 
between optical activity and molecular structure.
 
We now realize that optical activity is exhibited by molecules that have nonsuper-
imposable mirror images. Your hands are nonsuperimposable mirror images (Fig. 
21.15). The two hands are related like an object and its mirror image; one hand cannot 
be turned to make it identical to the other. Many molecules show this same feature, 
such as the complex ion [Co(en)3]31 shown in Fig. 21.16. Objects that have nonsuper-
imposable mirror images are said to be chiral (from the Greek word cheir, meaning 
‚Äúhand‚Äù).
 
The isomers of [Co(en)3]31 (Fig. 21.17) are nonsuperimposable mirror images 
called enantiomers, which rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions and are 
thus optical isomers. The isomer that rotates the plane of light to the right (when 
viewed down the beam of oncoming light) is said to be dextrorotatory, designated by 
d. The isomer that rotates the plane of light to the left is levorotatory (l). An equal

S
ome of the most important 
advancements of science are the 
results of accidental discoveries‚Äîfor 
example, penicillin, Teflon, and the 
sugar substitutes cyclamate and aspar-
tame. Another important chance dis-
covery occurred in 1964, when a group 
of scientists using platinum electrodes 
to apply an electric field to a colony of 
E. coli bacteria noticed that the bacteria 
failed to divide but continued to grow, 
forming long, fibrous cells. Further 
study revealed that cell division was 
inhibited by small concentrations of 
cis-Pt(NH3)2Cl2 and cis-Pt(NH3)2Cl4 
formed electrolytically in the solution.
Cancerous cells multiply very rapidly 
because cell division is uncontrolled. 
Thus these and similar platinum com-
plexes were evaluated as antitumor 
agents, which inhibit the division of 
cancer cells. The results showed that 
cis-Pt(NH3)2Cl2 was active against a wide 
variety of tumors, including testicular 
and ovarian tumors, which are very 
resistant to treatment by more tradi-
tional methods. However, although the 
cis complex showed significant 
antitumor activity, the corresponding 
trans complex had no effect on tumors. 
This shows the importance of isomer-
ism in biological systems. When drugs 
are synthesized, great care must be 
taken to obtain the correct isomer.
Although cis-Pt(NH3)2Cl2 has proven 
to be a valuable drug, unfortunately it 
has some troublesome side effects, the 
most serious being kidney damage. As 
a result, the search continues for even 
more effective antitumor agents. Prom-
ising candidates are shown in Fig. 21.14. 
Note that they are all cis complexes.

mixture of the d and l forms in solution, called a racemic mixture, does not rotate the 
plane of the polarized light at all because the two opposite effects cancel each other.
 
Geometrical isomers are not necessarily optical isomers. For instance, the trans 
isomer of [Co(en)2Cl2]1 shown in Fig. 21.17 is identical to its mirror image. Since this 
isomer is superimposable on its mirror image, it does not exhibit optical isomerism 
and is not chiral. On the other hand, cis-[Co(en)2Cl2]1 is not superimposable on its 
mirror image; a pair of enantiomers exists for this complex ion (the cis isomer is 
chiral).
 
Most important biomolecules are chiral, and their reactions are highly structure 
dependent. For example, a drug can have a particular effect because its molecules can

bind to chiral molecules in the body. To bind correctly, however, the correct optical iso-
mer of the drug must be administered. Just as the right hand of one person requires the 
right hand of another to perform a handshake, a given isomer in the body requires a spe-
cific isomer of the drug to bind together. Because of this, the syntheses of drugs, which 
are usually very complicated molecules, must be carried out in a way that produces the 
correct ‚Äúhandedness,‚Äù a requirement that greatly adds to the synthetic difficulties.
Geometrical and Optical Isomerism
Does the complex ion [Co(NH3)Br(en)2]21 exhibit geometrical isomerism? Does it 
exhibit optical isomerism?
 
SOLUTION 
The complex ion exhibits geometrical isomerism because the ethylenediamine ligands 
can be across from or next to each other:

The cis isomer of the complex ion also exhibits optical isomerism because its mirror

cannot be turned in any way to make them superimposable. Thus these mirror-image

light in opposite directions.

21.5 Bonding in Complex Ions: The 
Localized Electron Model
In Chapters 8 and 9 we considered the localized electron model, a very useful model 
for describing the bonding in molecules. Recall that a central feature of this model is 
the formation of hybrid atomic orbitals that are used to share electron pairs to form 
s bonds between atoms. This same model can be used to account for the bonding in 
complex ions, but there are two important points to keep in mind:
1.
The VSEPR model for predicting structure generally does not work for complex 
ions. However, we can safely assume that a complex ion with a coordination 
number of 6 will have an octahedral arrangement of ligands, and complexes with 
EXAMPLE 21.3

two ligands will be linear. On the other hand, complex ions with a coordination 
number of 4 can be either tetrahedral or square planar, and there is no completely 
reliable way to predict which will occur in a particular case.
2. The interaction between a metal ion and a ligand can be viewed as a Lewis acid‚Äì
base reaction with the ligand donating a lone pair of electrons to an empty orbital 
of the metal ion to form a coordinate covalent bond:

L

 The hybrid orbitals used by the metal ion depend on the number and arrangement 
of the ligands. For example, accommodating the lone pairs from the six ammonia 
molecules in the octahedral Co(NH3)631 ion requires a set of six empty hybrid 
atomic orbitals in an octahedral arrangement. As we discussed in Section 9.1, an 
octahedral set of orbitals is formed by the hybridization of two d, one s, and three 
p orbitals to give a set of six d2sp3 orbitals (Fig. 21.18).
 
The hybrid orbitals required on a metal ion in a four-coordinate complex depend on 
whether the structure is tetrahedral or square planar. For a tetrahedral arrangement of 
ligands, an sp3 hybrid set is required (Fig. 21.19). For example, in the tetrahedral 
CoCl422 ion, the Co21 can be described as sp3 hybridized. A square planar arrangement 
of ligands requires a dsp2 hybrid orbital set on the metal ion (Fig. 21.19). For example, 
in the square planar Ni(CN)422 ion, the Ni21 is described as dsp2 hybridized.
 
A linear complex requires two hybrid orbitals 180 degrees from each other. This 
arrangement is given by an sp hybrid set (see Fig. 21.19). Thus, in the linear Ag(NH3)21 
ion, the Ag1 can be described as sp hybridized.
 
Although the localized electron model can account in a general way for metal‚Äì 
ligand bonds, it is rarely used today because it cannot readily account for important 
properties of complex ions, such as magnetism and color. Thus we will not pursue the 
model any further.

21.6 The Crystal Field Model
The main reason the localized electron model cannot fully account for the properties 
of complex ions is that it gives no information about how the energies of the d orbitals 
are affected by complex ion formation. This is critical because, as we will see, the 
color and magnetism of complex ions result from changes in the energies of the metal 
ion d orbitals caused by the metal‚Äìligand interactions.
The crystal field model focuses on the energies of the d orbitals. In fact, this model 
is not so much a bonding model as it is an attempt to account for the colors and mag-
netic properties of complex ions. In its simplest form, the crystal field model assumes 
that the ligands can be approximated by negative point charges and that metal‚Äìligand 
bonding is entirely ionic.
Octahedral Complexes
We will illustrate the fundamental principles of the crystal field model by applying it 
to an octahedral complex. Figure 21.20 shows the orientation of the 3d orbitals relative 
to an octahedral arrangement of point-charge ligands. The important thing to note is 
that two of the orbitals, dz2 and dx22y2, point their lobes directly at the point-charge 
ligands and three of the orbitals, dxz, dyz, and dxy, point their lobes between the point 
charges.
 
To understand the effect of this difference, we need to consider which type of orbital 
is lower in energy. Because the negative point-charge ligands repel negatively charged 
electrons, the electrons will first fill the d orbitals farthest from the ligands to minimize 
repulsions. In other words, the dxz, dyz, and dxy orbitals (known as the t2g set) are at a 
lower energy in the octahedral complex than are the dz2 and dx22y2 orbitals (the eg set). 
This is shown in Fig. 21.21. The negative point-charge ligands increase the energies of 
all the d orbitals. However, the orbitals that point at the ligands are raised in energy 
more than those that point between the ligands.
 
It is this splitting of the 3d orbital energies (symbolized by D) that explains the 
color and magnetism of complex ions of the first-row transition metal ions. For

sets as shown. The difference in  energy 
 between the two sets is designated as

example, in an octahedral complex of Co31 (a metal ion with six 3d electrons), there 
are two possible ways to place the electrons in the split 3d orbitals (Fig. 21.22). If the 
splitting produced by the ligands is very large, a situation called the strong-field case, 
the electrons will pair in the lower-energy t2g orbitals. This gives a diamagnetic com-
plex in which all the electrons are paired. On the other hand, if the splitting is small 
(the weak-field case), the electrons will occupy all five orbitals before pairing occurs. 
In this case the complex has four unpaired electrons and is paramagnetic.
 
The crystal field model allows us to account for the differences in the magnetic 
properties of Co(NH3)631 and CoF632. The Co(NH3)631 ion is known to be diamagnetic 
and thus corresponds to the strong-field case, also called the low-spin case, since it 
yields the minimum number of unpaired electrons. In contrast, the CoF632 ion, which is 
known to have four unpaired electrons, corresponds to the weak-field case, also known 
as the high-spin case, since it gives the maximum number of unpaired electrons.
CRITICAL THINKING What if you are told the number of 
unpaired electrons for a coordinate covalent ion and are asked to tell if the 
ligand produced a strong or weak field? Give an example of a coordinate 
covalent ion for which you could decide if it produced a strong or weak field and 
one for which you couldn‚Äôt, and explain your answers.
Crystal Field Model I
The Fe(CN)632 ion is known to have one unpaired electron. Does the CN2 ligand pro-
duce a strong or weak field?
 
SOLUTION 
Since the ligand is CN2 and the overall complex ion charge is 32, the metal ion must  
be Fe31, which has a 3d5 electron configuration. The two possible arrangements of the 
five electrons in the d orbitals split by the octahedrally arranged ligands are

From studies of many octahedral complexes, we can arrange ligands in order of 
their ability to produce d-orbital splitting. A partial listing of ligands in this spectro-
chemical series is

The ligands are arranged in order of decreasing D values toward a given metal ion.
 
It also has been observed that the magnitude of D for a given ligand increases as the 
charge on the metal ion increases. For example, NH3 is a weak-field ligand toward 
Co21 but acts as a strong-field ligand toward Co31. This makes sense; as the metal ion 
charge increases, the ligands will be drawn closer to the metal ion because of the 
increased charge density. As the ligands move closer, they cause greater splitting of the 
d orbitals and  produce a larger D value.
Crystal Field Model II
Predict the number of unpaired electrons in the complex ion Cr(CN)642.
 
SOLUTION 
The net charge of 42 means that the metal ion present must be Cr21 (26 1 2 5 24), 
which has a 3d4 electron configuration. Since CN2 is a strong-field ligand (see the 
spectrochemical series), the correct crystal field diagram for Cr(CN)642 is

The complex ion will have two unpaired electrons. Note that the CN2 ligand produces 
such a large splitting that all four electrons will occupy the t2g set even though two of 
the electrons must be paired in the same orbital.
See Exercises 21.57 and 21.58
 
We have seen how the crystal field model can account for the magnetic properties of 
octahedral complexes. The same model also can explain the colors of these complex 
ions. For example, Ti(H2O)631, an octahedral complex of Ti31, which has a 3d1 electron 
configuration, is violet because it absorbs light in the middle of the visible region of the 
spectrum (Fig. 21.23). When a substance absorbs certain wavelengths of light in the 
visible region, the color of the substance is determined by the wavelengths of visible 
light that remain. We say that the substance exhibits the color complementary to those 
absorbed. The Ti(H2O)631 ion is violet because it absorbs light in the yellow-green 
region, thus letting red light and blue light pass, which gives the observed violet color. 
This is shown schematically in Fig. 21.24. Table 21.16 shows the general relationship 
between the wavelengths of visible light absorbed and the approximate color observed.

T
he beautiful pure color of gems, so 
valued by cultures everywhere, 
arises from trace transition metal ion 
impurities in minerals that would oth-
erwise be colorless. For example, the 
stunning red of a ruby, the most valu-
able of all gemstones, is caused by Cr31 
ions, which replace about 1% of the 
Al31 ions in the mineral corundum, 
which is a form of aluminum oxide 
(Al2O3) that is nearly as hard as dia-
mond. In the corundum structure the 
Cr31 ions are surrounded by six oxide 
ions at the vertices of an octahedron. 
This leads to the characteristic octahe-
dral splitting of chromium‚Äôs 3d orbitals, 
such that the Cr31 ions absorb strongly 
in the blue-violet and yellow-green 
regions of the visible spectrum but 
transmit red light to give the character-
istic ruby color. (On the other hand, if 
some of the Al31 ions in the corundum 
are replaced by a mixture of Fe21, Fe31, 
and Ti41 ions, the gem is a sapphire 
with its brilliant blue color; or if some of 
the Al31 ions are replaced by Fe31 ions, 
the stone is a yellow topaz.)
Emeralds are derived from the 
mineral beryl, a beryllium aluminum 
silicate (empirical formula 3BeO ? Al2O3 
? 6SiO2). When some of the Al31 ions in 
beryl are replaced by Cr31 ions, the 
characteristic green color of emerald 
results. In this environment the split-
ting of the Cr31 3d orbitals causes it to 
strongly absorb yellow and blue-violet 
light and to transmit green light.
A gem closely related to ruby and 
emerald is alexandrite, named after 
Alexander II of Russia. This gem is 
based on the mineral chrysoberyl, a 
beryllium aluminate with the empirical 
formula BeO ? Al2O3 in which approxi-
mately 1% of the Al31 ions are replaced 
by Cr31 ions. In the chrysoberyl 
 environment Cr31 absorbs strongly in 
the yellow region of the spectrum. 
Alexandrite has the interesting prop-
erty of changing colors depending on 
the light source. When the first alexan-
drite stone was discovered deep in a 
mine in the Russian Ural Mountains in 
1831, it appeared to be a deep red color 
in the firelight of the miners‚Äô lamps. 
However, when the stone was brought 
to the surface, its color was blue. This 
seemingly magical color change occurs 
because the firelight of a miner‚Äôs hel-
met is rich in the yellow and red wave-
lengths of the visible spectrum but 
does not contain much blue. Absorp-
tion of the yellow by the stone pro-
duces a reddish color. However, 
daylight has much more intensity in 
the blue region than firelight. Thus the 
extra blue in the light transmitted by 
the stone gives it bluish color in 
daylight.
Once the structure of a natural gem 
is known, it is usually not very difficult 
to make the gem artificially. For exam-
ple, rubies and sapphires are made on a 
large scale by fusing Al(OH)3 with the 
appropriate transition metal salts at 
approximately 12008C to make the 
‚Äúdoped‚Äù corundum. With these tech-
niques gems of astonishing size can be 
manufactured: Rubies as large as 10 lb 
and sapphires up to 100 lb have been 
synthesized. Smaller synthetic stones 
produced for jewelry are virtually iden-
tical to the corresponding natural 
stones, and it takes great skill for a 
gemologist to tell the difference.

The reason that the Ti(H2O)631 ion absorbs a specific wavelength of visible light 
can be traced to the transfer of the lone d electron between the split d orbitals, as shown 
in Fig. 21.25. A given photon of light can be absorbed by a molecule only if the wave-
length of the light provides exactly the energy needed by the molecule. In other words, 
the wavelength absorbed is determined by the relationship
DE 5 hc
l
where DE represents the energy spacing in the molecule (we have used simply D in 
this chapter) and l represents the wavelength of light needed. Because the d-orbital 
splitting in most octahedral complexes corresponds to the energies of photons in the 
visible region, octahedral complex ions are usually colored.
 
Since the ligands coordinated to a given metal ion determine the size of the d-orbital 
splitting, the color changes as the ligands are changed. This occurs because a change 
in D means a change in the wavelength of light needed to transfer electrons between 
the t2g and eg orbitals. Several octahedral complexes of Cr31 and their colors are listed 
in Table 21.17.
Other Coordination Geometries
Using the same principles developed for octahedral complexes, we will now consider 
complexes with other geometries. For example, Fig. 21.26 shows a tetrahedral arrange-
ment of point charges in relation to the 3d orbitals of a metal ion. There are two impor-
tant facts to note:
1. None of the 3d orbitals ‚Äúpoint at the ligands‚Äù in the tetrahedral arrangement, as 
the dx22y2 and dz2 orbitals do in the octahedral case. Thus the tetrahedrally arranged 
ligands do not differentiate the d orbitals as much in the tetrahedral case as in the 
octahedral case. That is, the difference in energy between the split d orbitals will

the tetrahedral splitting is 4

metal ion:

2. Although not exactly pointing at the ligands, the dxy, dxz, and dyz orbitals are 
closer to the point charges than are the dz2 and dx22y2 orbitals. This means that the 
tetrahedral d-orbital splitting will be opposite to that for the octahedral arrange-
ment. The two arrangements are contrasted in Fig. 21.27. Because the d-orbital 
splitting is relatively small for the tetrahedral case, the weak-field case (high-spin 
case) always applies. There are no known ligands powerful enough to produce 
the strong-field case in a tetrahedral complex.

The crystal field model also applies to square planar and linear complexes. The 
crystal field diagrams for these cases are shown in Fig. 21.28. The ranking of orbitals 
in these diagrams can be explained by considering the relative orientations of the point 
charges and the orbitals. The diagram in Fig. 21.27 for the octahedral arrangement can 
be used to obtain these orientations. We can obtain the square planar complex by 
removing the two point charges along the z axis. This will greatly lower the energy of 
dz2, leaving only dx22y2, which points at the four remaining ligands as the highest- 
energy orbital. We can obtain the linear complex from the octahedral arrangement by 
leaving the two ligands along the z axis and removing the four in the xy plane. This 
means that only the dz2 points at the ligands and is highest in energy.
CRITICAL THINKING Figure 21.28(a) shows a crystal field diagram 
for a square planar complex oriented in the xy plane. What if you oriented the 
complex in the xz plane? Sketch the crystal field diagram and contrast it with 
Fig. 21.28(a).
21.7 The Biological Importance of 
Coordination Complexes
The ability of metal ions to coordinate with and release ligands and to easily undergo 
oxidation and reduction makes them ideal for use in biological systems. For example, 
metal ion complexes are used in humans for the transport and storage of oxygen, as 
electron-transfer agents, as catalysts, and as drugs. Most of the first-row transition 
metals are essential for human health, as summarized in Table 21.18. We will concen-
trate on iron‚Äôs role in biological systems, since several of its coordination complexes 
have been studied extensively.

Iron plays a central role in almost all living cells. In mammals, the principal source 
of energy comes from the oxidation of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Although 
oxygen is the oxidizing agent for these processes, it does not react directly with these 
molecules. Instead, the electrons from the breakdown of these nutrients are passed 
along a complex chain of molecules, called the respiratory chain, eventually reaching 
the O2 molecule. The principal electron-transfer molecules in the respiratory chain are 
iron-containing species called cytochromes, consisting of two main parts: an iron 
complex called a heme and a protein. The structure of the heme complex is shown in 
Fig. 21.29. Note that it contains an iron ion (it can be either Fe21 or Fe31) coordinated

to a rather complicated planar ligand called a porphyrin. As a class, porphyrins all 
contain the same central ring structure but have different substituent groups at the 
edges of the rings. The various porphyrin molecules act as tetradentate ligands for 
many metal ions, including iron, cobalt, and magnesium. In fact, chlorophyll, a sub-
stance essential to the process of photosynthesis, is a magnesium‚Äìporphyrin complex 
of the type shown in Fig. 21.30.
 
In addition to participating in the transfer of electrons from nutrients to oxygen, 
iron plays a principal role in the transport and storage of oxygen in mammalian blood 
and tissues. Oxygen is stored in a molecule called myoglobin, which consists of a 
heme complex and a protein in a structure very similar to that of the cytochromes.  
In myoglobin, the Fe21 ion is coordinated to four nitrogen atoms of the porphyrin 
ring and to a nitrogen atom of the protein chain, as shown in Fig. 21.31. Since  
Fe21 is normally six-coordinate, this leaves one position open for attachment of an  
O2 molecule.
 
One especially interesting feature of myoglobin is that it involves an O2 molecule 
attaching directly to Fe21. However, if gaseous O2 is bubbled into an aqueous solution 
containing heme, the Fe21 is immediately oxidized to Fe31. This oxidation of the Fe21

in heme does not happen in myoglobin. This fact is of crucial importance because Fe31 
does not form a coordinate covalent bond with O2, and myoglobin would not function 
if the bound Fe21 could be oxidized. Since the Fe21 in the ‚Äúbare‚Äù heme complex can 
be oxidized, it must be the protein that somehow prevents the oxidation. How? Based 
on much research, the answer seems to be that the oxidation of Fe21 to Fe31 involves 
an oxygen bridge between two iron ions (the circles indicate the ligands):
O
O
Fe2+
Fe2+
The bulky protein around the heme group in myoglobin prevents two molecules from 
getting close enough to form the oxygen bridge, and so oxidation of the Fe21 is 
prevented.
 
The transport of O2 in the blood is carried out by hemoglobin, a molecule consist-
ing of four myoglobin-like units, as shown in Fig. 21.32. Each hemoglobin can there-
fore bind four O2 molecules to form a bright red diamagnetic complex. The 
diamagnetism  occurs because oxygen is a strong-field ligand toward Fe21, which has 
a 3d6 electron configuration. When the oxygen molecule is released, water molecules 
occupy the sixth  coordination position around each Fe21, giving a bluish paramagnetic 
complex (H2O is a weak-field ligand toward Fe21) that gives venous blood its charac-
teristic bluish tint.
 
Hemoglobin dramatically demonstrates how sensitive the function of a biomole-
cule is to its structure. In certain people, in the synthesis of the proteins needed for 
hemoglobin, an improper amino acid is inserted into the protein in two places. This 
may not seem very serious, since there are several hundred amino acids present. How-
ever, because the incorrect amino acid has a nonpolar substituent instead of the polar 
one found on the proper amino acid, the hemoglobin drastically changes its shape. The

red blood cells are then sickle-shaped rather than disk-shaped, as shown in Fig. 21.33. 
The misshapen cells can aggregate, causing clogging of tiny capillaries. This condi-
tion, known as sickle cell anemia, is the subject of intense research.
 
Our knowledge of the workings of hemoglobin allows us to understand the effects 
of high altitudes on humans. The reaction between hemoglobin and oxygen can be 
represented by the following equilibrium:
Hb1aq2 1 4O21 g2 m Hb1O22 41aq2
 
Hemoglobin 
Oxyhemoglobin
At high altitudes, where the oxygen content of the air is lower, the position of this 
equilibrium will shift to the left, according to Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs principle. Because less 
oxyhemoglobin is formed, fatigue, dizziness, and even a serious illness called high-
altitude sickness can result. One way to combat this problem is to use supplemental 
oxygen, as most high-altitude mountain climbers do. However, this is impractical for 
people who live at high elevations. In fact, the human body adapts to the lower oxygen 
concentrations by making more hemoglobin, causing the equilibrium to shift back to 
the right. Someone moving from Chicago to Boulder, Colorado (5300 feet), would 
notice the effects of the new altitude for a couple of weeks, but as the hemoglobin level 
increased, the effects would disappear. This change is called high-altitude acclimatiza-
tion, which explains why athletes who want to compete at high elevations should prac-
tice there for several weeks prior to the event.
 
Our understanding of the biological role of iron also allows us to explain the toxici-
ties of substances such as carbon monoxide and the cyanide ion. Both CO and CN2 are 
very good ligands toward iron and so can interfere with the normal workings of the 
iron complexes in the body. For example, carbon monoxide has about 200 times the 
affinity for the Fe21 in hemoglobin as oxygen does. The resulting stable complex, 
carboxyhemo globin, prevents the normal uptake of O2, thus depriving the body of 
needed oxygen.  Asphyxiation can result if enough carbon monoxide is present in the 
air. The mechanism for the toxicity of the cyanide ion is somewhat different. Cyanide 
coordinates strongly to  cytochrome oxidase, an iron-containing cytochrome enzyme 
that catalyzes the  oxidation‚Äìreduction reactions of certain cytochromes. The coordi-
nated cyanide thus prevents the electron-transfer process and rapid death results. 
Because of its behavior, cyanide is called a respiratory inhibitor.

21.8 Metallurgy and Iron and Steel 
Production
In the preceding section we saw the importance of iron in biological systems. Of 
course, iron is also very important in many other ways in our world. In this section we 
will discuss the isolation of metals from their natural sources and the formulation of 
metals into useful materials, with special emphasis on the role of iron.
Metals are very important for structural applications, electrical wires, cooking uten-
sils, tools, decorative items, and many other purposes. However, because the main 
chemical characteristic of a metal is its ability to give up electrons, almost all metals 
in nature are found in ores, combined with nonmetals such as oxygen, sulfur, and the 
halogens. To recover and use these metals, we must separate them from their ores and 
reduce the metal ions. Then, because most metals are unsuitable for use in the pure 
state, we must form alloys that have the desired properties. The process of separating 
a metal from its ore and preparing it for use is known as metallurgy. The steps in this 
process are typically
1.
Mining
2.
Pretreatment of the ore
3.
Reduction to the free metal
4.
Purification of the metal (refining)
5.
Alloying
An ore can be viewed as a mixture containing minerals (relatively pure metal com-
pounds) and gangue (sand, clay, and rock). Some typical minerals are listed in Table 
21.19. Although silicate minerals are the most common in the earth‚Äôs crust, they are 
typically very hard and difficult to process, making metal extraction relatively expen-
sive. Therefore, other ores are used when available.

After mining, an ore must be treated to remove the gangue and to concentrate the 
mineral. The ore is first pulverized and then processed in a variety of devices, includ-
ing cyclone separators (Fig. 21.34), inclined vibrating tables, and flotation tanks.
 
In the flotation process, the crushed ore is fed into a tank containing a water‚Äìoil‚Äì 
detergent mixture. Because of the difference in the surface characteristics of the min-
eral particles and the silicate rock particles, the oil wets the mineral particles. A stream 
of air blown through the mixture causes tiny bubbles to form on the oil-covered pieces, 
which then float to the surface, where they can be skimmed off.
 
After the mineral has been concentrated, it is often chemically altered in preparation 
for the reduction step. For example, nonoxide minerals are often converted to oxides 
before reduction. Carbonates and hydroxides can be converted by simple heating:
 CaCO31s2 h
Heat
CaO1s2 1 CO21 g2
 Mg1OH2 21s2 h
Heat
MgO1s2 1 H2O1 g2
Sulfide minerals can be converted to oxides by heating in air at temperatures below 
their melting points, a process called roasting:
2ZnS1s2 1 3O21 g2 h
Heat
2ZnO1s2 1 2SO21 g2
As we have seen earlier, sulfur dioxide causes severe problems if released into the 
atmosphere, and modern roasting operations collect this gas and use it in the manufac-
ture of sulfuric acid.
 
The method chosen to reduce the metal ion to the free metal, a process called smelt-
ing, depends on the affinity of the metal ion for electrons. Some metals are good 
enough oxidizing agents that the free metal is produced in the roasting process. For 
example, the roasting reaction for cinnabar is
HgS1s2 1 O21 g2 h
Heat
Hg1 l 2 1 SO21 g2
where the Hg21 is reduced by electrons donated by the S22 ion, which is then further 
oxidized by O2 to form SO2.
 
The roasting of a more active metal produces the metal oxide, which must be 
reduced to obtain the free metal. The most common reducing agents are coke (impure 
carbon), carbon monoxide, and hydrogen. The following are some common examples 
of the reduction process:
 Fe2O31s2 1 3CO1 g2 h
Heat
2Fe1 l 2 1 3CO21 g2
 WO31s2 1 3H21 g2 h
Heat
W1 l 2 1 3H2O1 g2
 ZnO1s2 1 C1s2 h
Heat
Zn1 l 2 1 CO1 g2
 
The most active metals, such as aluminum and the alkali metals, must be reduced 
electrolytically, usually from molten salts (see Section 18.8).
 
The metal obtained in the reduction step is invariably impure and must be refined. 
The methods of refining include electrolytic refining (see Section 18.8), oxidation of 
impurities (as for iron, see below), and distillation of low-boiling metals such as mer-
cury and zinc. One process used when highly pure metals are needed is zone refining. 
In this process a bar of the impure metal travels through a heater (Fig. 21.35), which

The more dense mineral particles are 
thrown toward the walls by centrifugal 
force and fall down the funnel. The lighter 
particles (gangue) tend to stay closer to 
the center and are drawn out through the

causes melting and recrystallizing of the metal as the bar cools. Purification of the 
metal occurs because as the crystal re-forms, the metal ions are likely to fit much better 
in the crystal lattice than are the atoms of impurities. Thus the impurities tend to be 
excluded and carried to the end of the bar. Several repetitions of this process give a 
very pure metal bar.
Hydrometallurgy
The metallurgical processes we have considered so far are usually called pyrometal-
lurgy (pyro means ‚Äúat high temperatures‚Äù). These traditional methods require large 
quantities of energy and have two other serious problems: atmospheric pollution 
(mainly by sulfur dioxide) and relatively high costs that make treatment of low-grade 
ores economically unfeasible.
 
In the past hundred years, a different process, hydrometallurgy (hydro means 
‚Äúwater‚Äù), has been used to extract metals from ores by use of aqueous chemical solu-
tions, a process called leaching. The first two uses of hydrometallurgy were for the 
extraction of gold from low-grade ores and for the production of aluminum oxide, or 
alumina, from bauxite, an aluminum-bearing ore.
 
Gold is sometimes found in ores in the elemental state, but it usually occurs in rela-
tively small concentrations. A process called cyanidation treats the crushed ore with 
an aqueous cyanide solution in the presence of air to dissolve the gold by forming the 
complex ion Au(CN)22:
4Au1s2 1 8CN21aq2 1 O21 g2 1 2H2O1 l 2 h 4Au1CN2 2
21aq2 1 4OH21aq2
Pure gold is then recovered by reaction of the solution of Au(CN)22 with zinc powder 
to reduce Au1 to Au:
2Au1CN2 2
21aq2 1 Zn1s2 h 2Au1s2 1 Zn1CN2 4
221aq2
 
The extraction of alumina from bauxite (the Bayer process) leaches the ore with 
sodium hydroxide at high temperatures and pressures to dissolve the amphoteric alu-
minum oxide:
Al2O31s2 1 2OH21aq2 h 2AlO2
21aq2 1 H2O1 l 2
This process leaves behind solid impurities such as SiO2, Fe2O3, and TiO2, which are 
not appreciably soluble in basic solution. After the solid impurities are removed, the 
pH of the solution is lowered, causing the pure aluminum oxide to re-form. It is then 
electrolyzed to produce aluminum metal (see Section 18.8).
 
As illustrated by these processes, hydrometallurgy involves two distinct steps: 
selective leaching of a given metal ion from the ore and recovery of the metal ion from 
the solution by selective precipitation as an ionic compound.
 
The leaching agent can simply be water if the metal-containing compound is a 
 water-soluble chloride or sulfate. However, most commonly, the metal is present in a 
water- insoluble substance that must somehow be dissolved. The leaching agents used 
in such cases are usually aqueous solutions containing acids, bases, oxidizing agents, 
salts, or some combination of these. Often the dissolving process involves the forma-
tion of complex ions. For example, when an ore containing water-insoluble lead sul-
fate is treated with an aqueous sodium chloride solution, the soluble complex ion 
PbCl422 is formed:
PbSO41s2 1 4Na11aq2 1 4Cl21aq2 h 4Na11aq2 1 PbCl4
221aq2 1 SO4
221aq2
 
Formation of a complex ion also occurs in the cyanidation process for the recovery 
of gold. However, since the gold is present in the ore as particles of metal, it must first 
be oxidized by oxygen to produce Au1, which then reacts with CN2 to form the solu-
ble Au(CN)22 species. Thus, in this case, the leaching process involves a combination 
of oxidation and complexation.
Precipitation reactions are discussed in 
Section 16.2.
845

Sometimes just oxidation is used. For example, insoluble zinc sulfide can be con-
verted to soluble zinc sulfate by pulverizing the ore and suspending it in water to form 
a slurry through which oxygen is bubbled:
ZnS1s2 1 2O21 g2 h Zn211aq2 1 SO4
221aq2
 
One advantage of hydrometallurgy over the traditional processes is that sometimes 
the leaching agent can be pumped directly into the ore deposits in the earth. For exam-
ple, aqueous sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) can be injected into uranium-bearing ores to 
form water-soluble complex carbonate ions.
 
Recovering the metal ions from the leaching solution involves forming an insoluble 
solid containing the metal ion to be recovered. This step may involve addition of an 
anion to form an insoluble salt, reduction to the solid metal, or a combination of reduc-
tion and precipitation of a salt. Examples of these processes are shown in Table 21.20. 
Because of its suitability for treating low-grade ores economically and without signifi-
cant pollution, hydrometallurgy is becoming more popular for recovering many impor-
tant metals such as copper, nickel, zinc, and uranium.
The Metallurgy of Iron
Iron is present in the earth‚Äôs crust in many types of minerals. Iron pyrite (FeS2) is widely 
distributed but is not suitable for production of metallic iron and steel because it is almost 
impossible to remove the last traces of sulfur. The presence of sulfur makes the resulting 
steel too brittle to be useful. Siderite (FeCO3) is a valuable iron mineral that can be con-
verted to iron oxide by heating. The iron oxide minerals are hematite (Fe2O3), the more 
abundant, and magnetite (Fe3O4, really FeO ? Fe2O3). Taconite ores contain iron oxides 
mixed with silicates and are more difficult to process than the others. However, taconite 
ores are being increasingly used as the more desirable ores are consumed.
 
To concentrate the iron in iron ores, advantage is taken of the natural magnetism of 
Fe3O4 (hence its name, magnetite). The Fe3O4 particles can be separated from the 
gangue by magnets. The ores that are not magnetic are often converted to Fe3O4; 
hematite is partially reduced to magnetite, while siderite is first converted to FeO ther-
mally, then oxidized to Fe2O3, and then reduced to Fe3O4:
 FeCO31s2 h

 4FeO1s2 1 O21 g2 h 2Fe2O31s2
 3Fe2O31s2 1 C1s2 h 2Fe3O41s2 1 CO1 g2
Sometimes the nonmagnetic ores are concentrated by flotation processes.

The most commonly used reduction process for iron takes place in the blast fur-
nace (Fig. 21.36). The raw materials required are concentrated iron ore, coke, and 
limestone (which serves as a flux to trap impurities). The furnace, which is approxi-
mately 25 feet in diameter, is charged from the top with a mixture of iron ore, coke, 
and limestone. A very strong blast (,350 mi/h) of hot air is injected at the bottom, 
where the oxygen reacts with the carbon in the coke to form carbon monoxide, the 
reducing agent for the iron. The temperature of the charge increases as it travels down 
the furnace, with reduction of the iron to iron metal occurring in steps:
 3Fe2O3 1 CO h 2Fe3O4 1 CO2
 Fe3O4 1 CO h 3FeO 1 CO2
 FeO 1 CO h Fe 1 CO2
Iron can reduce carbon dioxide,
Fe 1 CO2 h FeO 1 CO
so complete reduction of the iron occurs only if the carbon dioxide is destroyed by 
adding excess coke:
CO2 1 C h 2CO
The limestone (CaCO3) in the charge loses carbon dioxide, or calcines, in the hot fur-
nace and combines with silica and other impurities to form slag, which is mostly 
molten calcium silicate, CaSiO3,
CaO 1 SiO2 h CaSiO3
and alumina (Al2O3). The slag floats on the molten iron and is skimmed off. The gas 
that escapes from the top of the furnace contains carbon monoxide, which is combined 
with air to form carbon dioxide. The energy released in this exothermic reaction is col-
lected in a heat exchanger and used in heating the furnace.
 
The iron collected from the blast furnace, called pig iron, is quite impure. It con-
tains ,90% iron, ,5% carbon, ,2% manganese, ,1% silicon, ,0.3% phosphorus,

and ,0.04% sulfur (from impurities in the coke). The production of 1 ton of pig iron 
requires approximately 1.7 tons of iron ore, 0.5 ton of coke, 0.25 ton of limestone, and 
2 tons of air.
 
Iron oxide also can be reduced in a direct reduction furnace, which operates at 
much lower temperatures (1300‚Äì20008F) than a blast furnace and produces a solid 
‚Äúsponge iron‚Äù rather than molten iron. Because of the milder reaction conditions, the 
direct reduction furnace requires a higher grade of iron ore (with fewer impurities) 
than that used in a blast furnace. The iron from the direct reduction furnace is called 
DRI (directly reduced iron) and contains ,95% iron, with the balance mainly silica 
and alumina.
Production of Steel
Steel is an alloy and can be classified as carbon steel, which contains up to about 1.5% 
carbon, or alloy steel, which contains carbon plus other metals such as Cr, Co, Mn, 
and Mo. The wide range of mechanical properties associated with steel is determined 
by its chemical composition and by the heat treatment of the final product.
 
The production of iron from its ore is fundamentally a reduction process, but the 
conversion of iron to steel is basically an oxidation process in which unwanted impuri-
ties are eliminated. Oxidation is carried out in various ways, but the two most common 
are the open hearth process and the basic oxygen process.
 
In the oxidation reactions of steelmaking, the manganese, phosphorus, and silicon 
in the impure iron react with oxygen to form oxides, which in turn react with appropri-
ate fluxes to form slag. Sulfur enters the slag primarily as sulfides, and excess carbon 
forms carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide. The flux chosen depends on the major 
impurities present. If manganese is the chief impurity, an acidic flux of silica is used:
MnO1s2 1 SiO21s2 h
Heat
MnSiO31 l 2
If the main impurity is silicon or phosphorus, a basic flux, usually lime (CaO) or mag-
nesia (MgO), is needed to give reactions such as
 SiO21s2 1 MgO1s2 h
Heat
MgSiO31 l 2
 P4O101s2 1 6CaO1s2 h
Heat
2Ca31PO42 21 l 2
Whether an acidic or a basic slag will be needed is a factor that must be considered 
when a furnace is constructed so that its refractory linings will be compatible with the 
slag. Silica bricks would deteriorate quickly in the presence of basic slag, and magne-
sia or lime bricks would dissolve in acid slag.
 
The open hearth process (Fig. 21.37) uses a dishlike container that holds 100 to 
200 tons of molten iron. An external heat source is required to keep the iron molten, 
and a concave roof over the container reflects heat back toward the iron surface. A blast 
of air or oxygen is passed over the surface of the iron to react with impurities. Silicon

and manganese are oxidized first and enter the slag, followed by oxidation of carbon 
to carbon monoxide, which causes agitation and foaming of the molten bath. The exo-
thermic oxidation of carbon raises the temperature of the bath, causing the limestone 
flux to calcine:
CaCO3 h
Heat
CaO 1 CO2
The resulting lime floats to the top of the molten mixture (an event called the lime 
boil), where it combines with phosphates, sulfates, and silicates. Next comes the refin-
ing process, which involves continued oxidation of carbon and other impurities. 
Because the melting point increases as the carbon content decreases, the bath tempera-
tures must be increased during this phase of the operation. If the carbon content falls 
below that desired in the final product, coke or pig iron may be added.
 
The final composition of the steel is ‚Äúfine-tuned‚Äù after the charge is poured. For 
example, aluminum is sometimes added at this stage to remove trace amounts of oxy-
gen via the reaction
4Al 1 3O2 h 2Al2O3
Alloying metals such as vanadium, chromium, titanium, manganese, and nickel are 
also added to give the steel the properties needed for a specific application.
 
The processing of a batch of steel by the open hearth process is quite slow, taking 
up to 8 hours. The basic oxygen process is much faster. Molten pig iron and scrap iron 
are placed in a barrel-shaped container (Fig. 21.38) that can hold as much as 300 tons 
of material. A high-pressure blast of oxygen is directed at the surface of the molten 
iron, oxidizing impurities in a manner very similar to that used in the open hearth pro-
cess. Fluxes are added after the oxygen blow begins. One advantage of this process is 
that the exothermic oxidation reactions proceed so rapidly that they produce enough 
heat to raise the temperature nearly to the boiling point of iron without an external heat 
source. Also, at these high temperatures only about an hour is needed to complete the 
oxidation processes.
 
The electric arc method, which was once used only for small batches of specialty 
steels, is being utilized more and more in the steel industry. In this process an electric 
arc between carbon electrodes is used to melt the charge. This means that no fuel-
borne impurities are added to the steel, since no fuel is needed. Also, higher tempera-
tures are possible than in the open hearth or basic oxygen processes, and this leads to 
more effective removal of sulfur and phosphorus impurities. Oxygen is added in this 
process so that the oxide impurities in the steel can be controlled effectively.
Heat Treatment of Steel
One way of producing the desired physical properties in steel is by controlling the 
chemical composition (Table 21.21). Another method for tailoring the properties of 
steel involves heat treatment. Pure iron exists in two different crystalline forms, 
depending on the temperature. At any temperature below 9128C, iron has a body- 
centered cubic structure and is called a-iron. Between 9128C and 13948C, iron has a 
face-centered cubic structure called austentite, or g-iron. At 13948C, iron changes to 
d-iron, a body-centered cubic structure identical to a-iron.
 
When iron is alloyed with carbon, which fits into holes among the iron atoms to 
form the interstitial alloy carbon steel, the situation becomes even more complex. For 
example, the temperature at which a-iron changes to austentite is lowered by about 
2008C. Also, at high temperatures iron and carbon react by an endothermic reversible 
reaction to form an iron carbide called cementite:
3Fe 1 C 1 energy m Fe3C
 
(Heat) 
Cementite
By Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs principle, we can predict that cementite will become more stable 
relative to iron and carbon as the temperature is increased. This is the observed result.
Refer to Section 10.3 for a review of packing 
and crystal lattices.

Thus steel is really a mixture of iron metal in one of its crystal forms, carbon, and 
cementite. The proportions of these components are very important in determining the 
physical properties of steel.
When steel is heated to temperatures in the region of 10008C, much of the carbon 
is converted to cementite. If the steel is then allowed to cool slowly, the equilibrium 
shown above shifts to the left, and small crystals of carbon precipitate, giving a steel 
that is relatively ductile. If the cooling is very rapid, the equilibrium does not have time 
to adjust. The cementite is trapped, and the steel has a high cementite content, making 
it quite brittle. The proportions of carbon crystals and cementite can be ‚Äúfine-tuned‚Äù to 
give the desired properties by heating to intermediate temperatures followed by rapid 
cooling, a process called tempering. The rate of heating and cooling determines not 
only the amounts of cementite present but also the size of its crystals and the form of 
crystalline iron present.

 72. One of the classic methods for the determination of the man-
ganese content in steel involves converting all the manganese 
to the deeply colored permanganate ion and then measuring 
the absorption of light. The steel is first dissolved in nitric 
acid, producing the manganese(II) ion and nitrogen dioxide 
gas. This  solution is then reacted with an acidic solution con-
taining periodate ion; the products are the permanganate and 
iodate ions. Write balanced chemical equations for both of 
these steps.

 98. Henry Taube, 1983 Nobel Prize winner in chemistry, has stud-

Chromium(III) and cobalt(III) complexes are substitutionally 
inert (no exchange of ligands) under conditions of the experi-
ment. Chromium(II) and cobalt(II) complexes can exchange 
ligands very rapidly. One of the products of the reaction is

the same dehydrating agent resulted in a mass loss of 18 mg. 
The third salt did not lose any mass when treated with the 
same dehydrating agent. Addition of excess aqueous silver 
nitrate to 100.0-mL portions of 0.100 M solutions of each salt 
resulted in the formation of different masses of silver chloride; 
one solution yielded 1430 mg AgCl; another, 2870 mg AgCl; 
the third, 4300 mg AgCl. Two of the salts are green and one is 
violet.
 
Suggest probable structural formulas for these salts, 
defending your answer on the basis of the preceding observa-
tions. State which salt is most likely to be violet. Would a 
study of the magnetic properties of the salts be helpful in 
determining the structural formulas? Explain.

wo Group 4A elements, carbon and silicon, form the basis of most natural 
substances. Silicon, with its great affinity for oxygen, forms chains and rings 
containing SiOOOSi bridges to produce the silica and silicates that form the basis 
for most rocks, sands, and soils. What silicon is to the geological world, carbon is to 
the biological world. Carbon has the unusual ability of bonding strongly to itself to 
form long chains or rings of carbon atoms. In addition, carbon forms strong bonds 
to¬† other nonmetals such as hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and the halogens. 
Because of these bonding properties, there are a myriad of carbon compounds; sev-
eral million are now known, and the number continues to grow rapidly. Among these 
many compounds are the biomolecules, those responsible for maintaining and repro-
ducing life.
The study of carbon-containing compounds and their properties is called organic 
chemistry. Although a few compounds involving carbon, such as its oxides and car-
bonates, are considered to be inorganic substances, the vast majority are organic com-
pounds that typically contain chains or rings of carbon atoms.
Originally, the distinction between inorganic and organic substances was based on 
whether a compound was produced by living systems. For example, until the early 
nineteenth century it was believed that organic compounds had some sort of ‚Äúlife 
force‚Äù and could be synthesized only by living organisms. This view was dispelled in 
1828 when the German chemist Friedrich W√∂hler (1800‚Äì1882) prepared urea from the 
inorganic salt ammonium cyanate by simple heating:
Ammonium cyanate

Heat
Urea is a component of urine, so it is clearly an organic material; yet here was clear 
evidence that it could be produced in the laboratory as well as by living things.
Organic chemistry plays a vital role in our quest to understand living systems. 
Beyond that, the synthetic fibers, plastics, artificial sweeteners, and drugs that are such 
an accepted part of modern life are products of industrial organic chemistry. In addi-
tion, the energy on which we rely so heavily to power our civilization is based mostly 
on the organic materials found in coal and petroleum.
Because organic chemistry is such a vast subject, we can provide only a brief intro-
duction to it in this book. We will begin with the simplest class of organic compounds, 
the hydrocarbons, and then show how most other organic compounds can be consid-
ered to be derivatives of hydrocarbons.
22.1 Alkanes: Saturated Hydrocarbons
As the name indicates, hydrocarbons are compounds composed of carbon and hydro-
gen. Those compounds whose carbon‚Äìcarbon bonds are all single bonds are said to be 
saturated, because each carbon is bound to four atoms, the maximum number. Hydro-
carbons containing carbon‚Äìcarbon multiple bonds are described as being unsatu-
rated, since the carbon atoms involved in a multiple bond can react with additional 
atoms, as shown by the addition of hydrogen to ethylene:

Note that each carbon in ethylene is bonded to three atoms (one carbon and two hydro-
gens) but that each can bond to one additional atom if one bond of the carbon‚Äìcarbon 
double bond is broken.

The simplest member of the saturated hydrocarbons, which are also called the 
alkanes, is methane (CH4). As discussed in Section 9.1, methane has a tetrahedral 
structure and can be described in terms of a carbon atom using an sp3 hybrid set of 
orbitals to bond to the four hydrogen atoms (Fig. 22.1). The next alkane, the one con-
taining two carbon atoms, is ethane (C2H6), as shown in Fig. 22.2. Each carbon in 
ethane is surrounded by four atoms and thus adopts a tetrahedral arrangement and 
sp3¬†hybridization, as predicted by the localized electron model.
 
The next two members of the series are propane (C3H8) and butane (C4H10), 
shown in Fig. 22.3. Again, each carbon is bonded to four atoms and is described as 
sp3¬†hybridized.
 
Alkanes in which the carbon atoms form long ‚Äústrings‚Äù or chains are called nor-
mal, straight-chain, or unbranched hydrocarbons. As can be seen from Fig. 22.3, 
the chains in normal alkanes are not really straight but zigzag, since the tetrahedral 
COCOC angle is 109.58. The normal alkanes can be represented by the structure

where n is an integer. Note that each member is obtained from the previous one by 
inserting a methylene (CH2) group. We can condense the structural formulas by omit-
ting some of the COH bonds. For example, the general formula for normal alkanes 
shown above can be condensed to
CH3i1CH22niCH3
 
The first ten normal alkanes and some of their properties are listed in Table 22.1.

nonane, which has nine carbon atoms, is represented by C9H(2 3 9) 1 2, or C9H20. Also 
note from Table 22.1 that the melting points and boiling points increase as the molar 
masses increase, as we would expect.
Isomerism in Alkanes
Butane and all succeeding members of the alkanes exhibit structural isomerism. 
Recall from Section 21.4 that structural isomerism occurs when two molecules have 
the same atoms but different bonds. For example, butane can exist as a straight-chain 
molecule (normal butane, or n-butane) or with a branched-chain structure (called iso-
butane), as shown in Fig. 22.4. Because of their different structures, these molecules 
exhibit different properties. For example, the boiling point of n-butane is 20.58C, 
whereas that of isobutane is 2128C.

Nomenclature
Because there are literally millions of organic compounds, it would be impossible to 
remember common names for all of them. We must have a systematic method for nam-
ing them. The following rules are used in naming alkanes.
Rules for Naming Alkanes
1. The names of the alkanes beyond butane are obtained by adding the suffix -ane to the 
Greek root for the number of carbon atoms (pent- for five, hex- for six, and so on). For a 
branched hydrocarbon, the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms determines the 
root name for the hydrocarbon. For example, in the alkane
Six carbons 
CH2
CH2
CH3
CH2
CH
CH2
CH3
CH3
the longest chain contains six carbon atoms, and this compound is named as a hexane.
2. When alkane groups appear as substituents, they are named by dropping the -ane and 
adding -yl. For example, OCH3 is obtained by removing a hydrogen from methane and 
is called methyl, OC2H5 is called ethyl, OC3H7 is called propyl, and so on. The compound 
above is therefore an ethylhexane (Table 22.2).
3. The positions of substituent groups are specified by numbering the longest chain of carbon 
atoms sequentially, starting at the end closest to the branching. For example, the compound

is called 3-methylhexane. Note that the top set of numbers is correct since the left end 
of the molecule is closest to the branching, and this gives the smallest number for the 
position of the substituent. Also, note that a hyphen is written between the number and 
the substituent name.
4. The location and name of each substituent are followed by the root alkane name. The 
substituents are listed in alphabetical order, and the prefixes di-, tri-, and so on, are used 
to indicate multiple, identical substituents.

Isomerism and Nomenclature
Draw the structural isomers for the alkane C6H14 and give the systematic name for 
each one.
 
SOLUTION 
We will proceed systematically, starting with the longest chain and then rearranging the 
carbons to form the shorter, branched chains.
1. CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3    Hexane
Note that although a structure such as
Six carbon atoms

may look different it is still hexane, since the longest carbon chain has six atoms.

Since the longest chain consists of five carbons, this is a substituted pentane: 
2-methylpentane. The 2 indicates the position of the methyl group on the chain. 
Note that if we numbered the chain from the right end, the methyl group would 
be on carbon 4. Because we want the smallest possible number, the numbering 
shown is correct.
3. The methyl substituent can also be on carbon 3 to give

Since the longest chain now has four carbons, the root name is butane. Since 
there are two methyl groups, we use the prefix di-. The numbers denote that the 
two methyl groups are positioned on the second and third carbons in the butane 
chain. Note that when two or more numbers are used, they are separated by a 
comma.
5. The two methyl groups can also be attached to the same carbon atom as shown 
here:

We might also try ethyl-substituted butanes, such as
Pentane

However, note that this is instead a pentane (3-methylpentane), since the longest 
chain has five carbon atoms. Thus it is not a new isomer. Trying to reduce the 
chain to three atoms provides no further isomers either. For example, the structure
CH2

is actually 2,2-dimethylbutane.
 
Thus there are only five distinct structural isomers of C6H14: hexane, 2-methylpen-
tane, 3-methylpentane, 2,3-dimethylbutane, and 2,2-dimethylbutane.

Reactions of Alkanes
Because they are saturated compounds and because the COC and COH bonds are 
relatively strong, the alkanes are fairly unreactive. For example, at 258C they do not 
react with acids, bases, or strong oxidizing agents. This chemical inertness makes 
them valuable as lubricating materials and as the backbone for structural materials 
such as plastics.
 
At a sufficiently high temperature alkanes do react vigorously and exothermically 
with oxygen, and these combustion reactions are the basis for their widespread use as 
fuels. For example, the reaction of butane with oxygen is
2C4H101 g2 1 13O21 g2 h 8CO21 g2 1 10H2O1 g2
 
The alkanes can also undergo substitution reactions, primarily where halogen 
atoms replace hydrogen atoms. For example, methane can be successively chlorinated 
as follows:
 CH4 1 Cl2 h
hv
¬†¬†¬†¬†  
 CH3Cl  ¬†¬†¬†¬† 1 HCl
 
Chloromethane
 CH3Cl 1 Cl2 h

(carbon tetrachloride)
Note that the products of the last two reactions have two names; the systematic name 
is given first, followed by the common name in parentheses. (This format will be used 
throughout this chapter for compounds that have common names.) Also, note that 
ultraviolet light (hv) furnishes the energy to break the ClOCl bond to produce chlorine 
atoms:
Cl2 h Cl # 1 Cl #
A chlorine atom has an unpaired electron, as indicated by the dot, which makes it very 
reactive and able to attack the COH bond.
 
Substituted methanes with the general formula CFxCl4 2 x containing both chlorine 
and fluorine as substituents are called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and are also known 
as Freons. These substances are very unreactive and have been extensively used as 
coolant fluids in refrigerators and air conditioners. Unfortunately, their chemical inert-
ness allows Freons to remain in the atmosphere so long that they eventually reach 
altitudes where they are a threat to the protective ozone layer (see Section 12.8), and 
the use of these compounds is being rapidly phased out.
The hv above the arrow represents 
 ultraviolet light.

Alkanes can also undergo dehydrogenation reactions in which hydrogen atoms 
are removed and the product is an unsaturated hydrocarbon. For example, in the pres-
ence of chromium(III) oxide at high temperatures, ethane can be dehydrogenated, 
yielding ethylene:
CH3CH3 888n CH2wCH2 1 H2
 
Ethylene
Cyclic Alkanes
Besides forming chains, carbon atoms also form rings. The simplest of the cyclic 
alkanes (general formula CnH2n) is cyclopropane (C3H6), shown in Fig. 22.5(a). Since 
the carbon atoms in cyclopropane form an equilateral triangle with 608 bond angles, 
their sp3 hybrid orbitals do not overlap head-on as in normal alkanes [Fig. 22.5(b)]. 
This results in unusually weak, or strained, COC bonds; thus the cyclopropane mol-
ecule is much more reactive than straight-chain propane. The carbon atoms in cyclobu-
tane (C4H8) form a square with 888 bond angles, and cyclobutane is also quite 
reactive.
 
The next two members of the series, cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12), 
are quite stable, because their rings have bond angles very close to the tetrahedral 
angles, which allows the sp3 hybrid orbitals on adjacent carbon atoms to overlap head-
on and form normal COC bonds, which are quite strong. To attain the tetrahedral 
angles, the cyclohexane ring must ‚Äúpucker‚Äù‚Äîthat is, become nonplanar. Cyclohexane 
can exist in two forms, the chair and the boat forms, as shown in Fig. 22.6. The two 
hydrogen atoms above the ring in the boat form are quite close to each other, and the 
resulting repulsion between these atoms causes the chair form to be preferred. At 258C 
more than 99% of cyclohexane exists in the chair form.
 
For simplicity, the cyclic alkanes are often represented by the following 
structures:
Thus the structure CH3 represents methylcyclopropane.
 
The nomenclature for cycloalkanes follows the same rules as for the other alkanes 
except that the root name is preceded by the prefix cyclo-. The ring is numbered to 
yield the smallest substituent numbers possible.

22.2 Alkenes and Alkynes
Multiple carbon‚Äìcarbon bonds result when hydrogen atoms are removed from alkanes. 
Hydrocarbons that contain at least one carbon‚Äìcarbon double bond are called alkenes 
and have the general formula CnH2n. The simplest alkene (C2H4), commonly known as 
ethylene, has the Lewis structure
C
H
H
H
H
C
As discussed in Section 9.1, each carbon in ethylene can be described as sp2 hybrid-
ized. The COC s bond is formed by sharing an electron pair between sp2 orbitals, and 
the p bond is formed by sharing a pair of electrons between p orbitals (Fig. 22.7).
 
The systematic nomenclature for alkenes is quite similar to that for alkanes.
1. The root hydrocarbon name ends in -ene rather than -ane. Thus the systematic 
name for C2H4 is ethene and the name for C3H6 is propene.
2. In alkenes containing more than three carbon atoms, the location of the double 
bond is indicated by the lowest-numbered carbon atom involved in the bond. 
Thus CH2 w CHCH2CH3 is called 1-butene, and CH3CH w CHCH3 is called 
2-butene.

Note from Fig. 22.7 that the p orbitals on the two carbon atoms in ethylene must be 
lined up (parallel) to allow formation of the p bond. This prevents rotation of the two 
CH2 groups relative to each other at ordinary temperatures, in contrast to alkanes, where 
free rotation is possible (Fig. 22.8). The restricted rotation around doubly bonded car-
bon atoms means that alkenes exhibit cis‚Äìtrans isomerism. For example, there are two 
stereoisomers of 2-butene (Fig. 22.9). Identical substituents on the same side of the 
double bond are designated cis and those on opposite sides are labeled trans.
 
Alkynes are unsaturated hydrocarbons containing at least one triple carbon‚Äìcarbon 
bond. The simplest alkyne is C2H2 (commonly called acetylene), which has the sys-
tematic name ethyne. As discussed in Section 9.1, the triple bond in acetylene can be 
described as one s bond between two sp hybrid orbitals on the two carbon atoms and 
two p bonds involving two 2p orbitals on each carbon atom (Fig. 22.10).
 
The nomenclature for alkynes involves the use of -yne as a suffix to replace the  
-ane of the parent alkane. Thus the molecule CH3CH2C { CCH3 has the name 
2-pentyne.

involved in this bond.
See Exercises 22.27, 22.28, and 22.46
Reactions of Alkenes and Alkynes
Because alkenes and alkynes are unsaturated, their most important reactions are addi-
tion reactions. In these reactions p bonds, which are weaker than the COC s bonds, 
are broken, and new s bonds are formed to the atoms being added. For example, 
hydrogenation reactions involve the addition of hydrogen atoms:
CH2wCHCH3 1 H2 8888n CH3CH2CH3
 
1-Propene 
Propane
For this reaction to proceed rapidly at normal temperatures, a catalyst of platinum, 
palladium, or nickel is used. The catalyst serves to help break the relatively strong 
HOH bond, as was discussed in Section 12.7. Hydrogenation of alkenes is an impor-
tant industrial process, particularly in the manufacture of solid shortenings where 
unsaturated fats (fats containing double bonds), which are generally liquid, are con-
verted to solid saturated fats.

Halogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons involves addition of halogen atoms. 
For example,
CH2wCHCH2CH2CH3 1 Br2 h CH2BrCHBrCH2CH2CH3
1-Pentene
1,2-Dibromopentane
Another important reaction involving certain unsaturated hydrocarbons is polym-
erization, a process in which many small molecules are joined together to form a large 
molecule. Polymerization will be discussed in Section 22.5.
22.3 Aromatic Hydrocarbons
A special class of cyclic unsaturated hydrocarbons is known as the aromatic 
hydrocarbons. The simplest of these is benzene (C6H6), which has a planar ring 
structure, as shown in Fig. 22.11(a). In the localized electron model of the bonding 
in benzene, resonance structures of the type shown in Fig. 22.11(b) are used to 
account for the known equivalence of all the carbon‚Äìcarbon bonds. But as we dis-
cussed in Section¬†9.5, the best description of the benzene molecule assumes that sp2
hybrid orbitals on each carbon are used to form the COC and COH s bonds, while 
the remaining 2p orbital on each carbon is used to form p molecular orbitals. The 
delocalization of these p electrons is usually indicated by a circle inside the ring 
[Fig. 22.11(c)].
The delocalization of the p electrons makes the benzene ring behave quite differ-
ently from a typical unsaturated hydrocarbon. As we have seen previously, unsaturated 
hydrocarbons generally undergo rapid addition reactions. However, benzene does not. 
Instead, it undergoes substitution reactions in which hydrogen atoms are replaced by 
other atoms. For example,
Cl2
FeCl3
Chlorobenzene
HCl
Cl
+

HNO3
H2SO4
Nitrobenzene
+
H2O

In each case the substance shown over the arrow is needed to catalyze these substitu-
tion reactions.
 
Substitution reactions are characteristic of saturated hydrocarbons, and addition 
 reactions are characteristic of unsaturated ones. The fact that benzene reacts more like 
a saturated hydrocarbon indicates the great stability of the delocalized p electron 
system.

The nomenclature of benzene derivatives is similar to the nomenclature for satu-
rated ring systems. If there is more than one substituent present, numbers are used to 
indicate substituent positions. For example, the compound

is named 1,2-dichlorobenzene. Another nomenclature system uses the prefix ortho- 
(o-) for two adjacent substituents, meta- (m-) for two substituents with one carbon 
between them, and para- (p-) for two substituents opposite each other. When benzene 
is used as a substituent, it is called the phenyl group. Examples of some aromatic 
compounds are shown in Fig. 22.12.
 
Benzene is the simplest aromatic molecule. More complex aromatic systems can be 
viewed as consisting of a number of ‚Äúfused‚Äù benzene rings. Some examples are given

22.4 Hydrocarbon Derivatives
The vast majority of organic molecules contain elements in addition to carbon and 
hydrogen. However, most of these substances can be viewed as hydrocarbon deriva-
tives, molecules that are fundamentally hydrocarbons but that have additional atoms 
or groups of atoms called functional groups. The common functional groups are 
listed in Table 22.4. Because each functional group exhibits characteristic chemistry, 
we will consider the groups separately.
Alcohols
Alcohols are characterized by the presence of the hydroxyl group (OOH). Some com-
mon alcohols are listed in Table 22.5. The systematic name for an alcohol is obtained 
by replacing the final -e of the parent hydrocarbon with -ol. The position of the OOH 
group is specified by a number (where necessary) chosen so that it is the smallest of the 
substituent numbers. Alcohols are classified according to the number of hydrocarbon 
fragments bonded to the carbon where the OOH group is attached (see below), where 
R, R9, and R0 (which may be the same or different) represent hydrocarbon fragments.

Alcohols usually have much higher boiling points than might be expected from 
their molar masses. For example, both methanol and ethane have a molar mass of 30, 
but the boiling point for methanol is 658C while that for ethane is 2898C. This differ-
ence can be understood if we consider the types of intermolecular attractions that 
occur in these liquids. Ethane molecules are nonpolar and exhibit only weak London 
dispersion interactions. However, the polar OOH group of methanol produces exten-
sive hydrogen bonding similar to that found in water (see Section 10.1), which results 
in the relatively high boiling point.
 
Although there are many important alcohols, the simplest ones, methanol and etha-
nol, have the greatest commercial value. Methanol, also known as wood alcohol 
because it was formerly obtained by heating wood in the absence of air, is prepared 
industrially (approximately 4 million tons annually in the United States) by the hydro-
genation of carbon monoxide:
CO 1 2H2 88888n CH3OH
Methanol is used as a starting material for the synthesis of acetic acid and for many 
types of adhesives, fibers, and plastics. It is also used (and such use may increase) as a 
motor fuel. Methanol is highly toxic to humans and can lead to blindness and death if 
ingested.
 
Ethanol is the alcohol found in beverages such as beer, wine, and whiskey; it is 
produced by the fermentation of glucose in corn, barley, grapes, and so on:
C6H12O6 h
Yeast
2CH3CH2OH 1 2CO2
 
Glucose 
Ethanol
The reaction is catalyzed by the enzymes found in yeast. This reaction can proceed 
only until the alcohol content reaches about 13% (the percentage found in most wines), 
at which point the yeast can no longer survive. Beverages with higher alcohol content 
are made by distilling the fermentation mixture.
 
Ethanol, like methanol, can be burned in the internal combustion engines of auto-
mobiles and is now commonly added to gasoline to form gasohol (see Section 6.6). It 
is also used in industry as a solvent and for the preparation of acetic acid. One common 
method for the production of ethanol in the chemical industry is by reaction of water 
with  ethylene:
CH2w CH2 1 H2O 8888n CH3CH2OH

ber indicates the position of the carbonyl group where necessary. Examples of common 
aldehydes and ketones are shown in Fig. 22.13. Note that since the aldehyde functional 
group always occurs at the end of the carbon chain, the aldehyde carbon is assigned the 
number 1 when substituent positions are listed in the name.

Ketones often have useful solvent properties (acetone is found in nail polish 
remover, for example) and are frequently used in industry for this purpose. Aldehydes 
typically have strong odors. Vanillin is responsible for the pleasant odor in vanilla 
beans; cinnamaldehyde produces the characteristic odor of cinnamon. On the other 
hand, the unpleasant odor in rancid butter arises from the presence of butyraldehyde.
 
Aldehydes and ketones are most often produced commercially by the oxidation of  
alcohols. For example, oxidation of a primary alcohol yields the corresponding aldehyde:
CH3CH2OH

O

Oxidation of a secondary alcohol results in a ketone:

that gives an acid of the general formula RCOOH. Typically, these molecules are weak 
acids in aqueous solution (see Section 14.5). Organic acids are named from the parent 
alkane by dropping the final -e and adding -oic. Thus CH3COOH, commonly called 
acetic acid, has the systematic name ethanoic acid, since the parent alkane is ethane. 
Other examples of carboxylic acids are shown in Fig. 22.14.
 
Many carboxylic acids are synthesized by oxidizing primary alcohols with a strong 
oxidizing agent. For example, ethanol can be oxidized to acetic acid by using  potassium 
permanganate:
CH3CH2OH
CH3COOH
KMnO4(aq)
 
A carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol to form an ester and a water molecule. For 
example, the reaction of acetic acid with ethanol produces ethyl acetate and water:

Esters often have a sweet, fruity odor that is in contrast to the often pungent odors of the

and that of oranges is caused by n-octyl acetate,

The systematic name for an ester is formed by changing the -oic ending of the parent 
acid to -oate. The parent alcohol chain is named first with a -yl ending. For example, 
the systematic name for n-octyl acetate is n-octylethanoate (from ethanoic acid).

Amines
Amines are probably best viewed as derivatives of ammonia in which one or more 
NOH bonds are replaced by NOC bonds. The resulting amines are classified as  
primary if one NOC bond is present, secondary if two NOC bonds are present,  
and tertiary if all three NOH bonds in NH3 have been replaced by NOC bonds  
(Fig. 22.15). Examples of some common amines are given in Table 22.6.
 
Common names are often used for simple amines; the systematic nomenclature for 
more complex molecules uses the name amino- for the ONH2 functional group. For 
example, the molecule
CH3CHCH2CH3
NH2
is named 2-aminobutane.
 
Many amines have unpleasant ‚Äúfishlike‚Äù odors. For example, the odors associated 
with decaying animal and human tissues are caused by amines such as putrescine 
(H2NCH2CH2CH2NH2) and cadaverine (H2NCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2NH2).
 
Aromatic amines are used primarily to make dyes. Since many of them are carcino-
genic, they must be handled with great care.

22.5 Polymers
Polymers are large, usually chainlike molecules that are built from small molecules 
called monomers. Polymers form the basis for synthetic fibers, rubbers, and plastics 
and have played a leading role in the revolution that has been brought about in daily 
life by chemistry. It has been estimated that about 50% of the industrial chemists in the 
United States work in some area of polymer chemistry, a fact that illustrates just how 
important polymers are to our economy and standard of living.
The Development and Properties of Polymers
The development of the polymer industry provides a striking example of the impor-
tance of serendipity in the progress of science. Many discoveries in polymer chemistry 
arose from accidental observations that scientists followed up.
The age of plastics might be traced to a day in 1846 when Christian Schoenbein, a 
chemistry professor at the University of Basel in Switzerland, spilled a flask contain-
ing nitric and sulfuric acids. In his hurry to clean up the spill, he grabbed his wife‚Äôs 
cotton apron, which he then rinsed out and hung up in front of a hot stove to dry. 
Instead of drying, the apron flared and burned.
Very interested in this event, Schoenbein repeated the reaction under more con-
trolled conditions and found that the new material, which he correctly concluded to be 
nitrated cellulose, had some surprising properties. As he had experienced, the nitrated 
cellulose is extremely flammable and, under certain circumstances, highly explosive. 
In addition, he found that it could be molded at moderate temperatures to give objects 
that were, upon cooling, tough but elastic. Predictably, the explosive nature of the 
substance was initially of more interest than its other properties, and cellulose nitrate 
rapidly became the basis for smokeless gunpowder. Although Schoenbein‚Äôs discovery 
cannot be described as a truly synthetic polymer (because he simply found a way to 
modify the natural polymer cellulose), it formed the basis for a large number of indus-
tries that grew up to produce photographic films, artificial fibers, and molded objects 
of all types.
The first synthetic polymers were produced as by-products of various organic reac-
tions and were regarded as unwanted contaminants. Thus the first preparations of 
many of the polymers now regarded as essential to our modern lifestyle were thrown 
away in disgust. One chemist who refused to be defeated by the ‚Äútarry‚Äù products 
obtained when he reacted phenol with formaldehyde was the Belgian-American chem-
ist Leo H. Baekeland (1863‚Äì1944). Baekeland‚Äôs work resulted in the first completely 
synthetic plastic (called Bakelite), a substance that when molded to a certain shape 
under high pressure and temperature cannot be softened again or dissolved. Bakelite is 
a thermoset polymer. In contrast, cellulose nitrate is a thermoplastic polymer; that 
is, it can be remelted after it has been molded.
The discovery of Bakelite in 1907 spawned a large plastics industry, producing 
telephones, billiard balls, and insulators for electrical devices. During the early days of 
polymer chemistry, there was a great deal of controversy over the nature of these mate-
rials. Although the German chemist Hermann Staudinger speculated in 1920 that poly-
mers were very large molecules held together by strong chemical bonds, most chemists 
of the time assumed that these materials were much like colloids, in which small mol-
ecules are aggregated into large units by forces weaker than chemical bonds.
One chemist who contributed greatly to the understanding of polymers as giant 
molecules was Wallace H. Carothers of the DuPont Chemical Company. Among his 
accomplishments was the preparation of nylon. The nylon story further illustrates the 
importance of serendipity in scientific research. When nylon is first prepared, the 
resulting product is a sticky material with little structural integrity. Because of this, it 
was initially put aside as having no apparently useful characteristics. However, Julian 
Hill, a chemist in the Carothers research group, one day put a small ball of this nylon

on the end of a stirring rod and drew it away from the remaining sticky mass, forming 
a string. He noticed the silky appearance and strength of this thread and realized that 
nylon could be drawn into useful fibers.
The reason for this behavior of nylon is now understood. When nylon is first formed, 
the individual polymer chains are oriented randomly, like cooked spaghetti, and the 
substance is highly amorphous. However, when drawn out into a thread, the chains 
tend to line up (the nylon becomes more crystalline), which leads to increased hydro-
gen bonding between adjacent chains. This increase in crystallinity, along with the 
resulting increase in hydrogen-bonding interactions, leads to strong fibers and thus to 
a highly useful material. Commercially, nylon is produced by forcing the raw material 
through a spinneret, a plate containing small holes, which forces the polymer chains to 
line up.
Another property that adds strength to polymers is crosslinking, the existence of 
covalent bonds between adjacent chains. The structure of Bakelite is highly cross-
linked, which accounts for the strength and toughness of this polymer. Another exam-
ple of crosslinking occurs in the manufacture of rubber. Raw natural rubber consists of 
chains of the type

and is a soft, sticky material unsuitable for tires. However, in 1839 Charles Goodyear 
(1800‚Äì1860), an American chemist, accidentally found that if sulfur is added to rubber 
Charles Goodyear tried for many years  
to change natural rubber into a useful 
product. In 1839 he accidentally dropped 
some rubber containing sulfur on a hot 
stove. Noting that the rubber did not melt 
as expected, Goodyear pursued this lead 
and developed vulcanization.
W
allace H. Carothers, a brilliant 
organic chemist who was princi-
pally responsible for the development 
of nylon and the first synthetic rubber 
(Neoprene), was born in 1896 in 
Burlington, Iowa. As a youth, Carothers 
was fascinated by tools and mechani-
cal devices and spent many hours 
experimenting. In 1915 he entered 
Tarkio College in Missouri. Carothers 
so excelled in chemistry that even 
before his graduation, he was made a 
chemistry instructor.
Carothers eventually moved to the 
University of Illinois at Urbana‚Äì 
Champaign, where he was appointed 
to the faculty when he completed his 
Ph.D. in organic chemistry in 1924.  
He moved to Harvard University in 
1926, and then to DuPont in 1928 to 
participate in a new program in 
fundamental research. At DuPont, 
Carothers headed the organic chemis-
try division, and during his ten years 
there played a prominent role in laying 
the foundations of polymer chemistry.
By the age of 33, Carothers had 
become a world-famous chemist 
whose advice was sought by almost 
everyone working in polymers. He was 
the first industrial chemist to be 
elected to the prestigious National 
Academy of Sciences.
Carothers was an avid reader of 
poetry and a lover of classical music. 
Unfortunately, he also suffered from 
severe bouts of depression that finally 
led to his suicide in 1937 in a Philadel-
phia hotel room, where he drank a 
cyanide solution. He was 41 years old. 
Despite the brevity of his career, 
Carothers was truly one of the finest 
American chemists of all time. His great 
intellect, his love of chemistry, and his 
insistence on perfection produced his 
special genius.

and the resulting mixture is heated (a process called vulcanization), the resulting rubber 
is still elastic (reversibly stretchable) but is much stronger. This change in character occurs 
because sulfur atoms become bonded between carbon atoms on different chains. These 
sulfur atoms form bridges between the polymer chains, thus linking the chains together.
Types of Polymers
The simplest and one of the best-known polymers is polyethylene, which is constructed 
from ethylene monomers:

where n represents a large number (usually several thousand). Polyethylene is a tough, 
flexible plastic used for piping, bottles, electrical insulation, packaging films, garbage 
bags, and many other purposes. Its properties can be varied by using substituted ethyl-
ene monomers. For example, when tetrafluoroethylene is the monomer, the polymer 
Teflon is obtained:

Teflon
The discovery of Teflon, a very important substituted polyethylene, is another illus-
tration of the role of chance in chemical research. In 1938 a DuPont chemist named 
Roy Plunkett was studying the chemistry of gaseous tetrafluoroethylene. He synthe-
sized about 100 pounds of the chemical and stored it in steel cylinders. When one of 
the cylinders failed to produce tetrafluoroethylene gas when the valve was opened, the 
cylinder was cut open to reveal a white powder. This powder turned out to be a poly-
mer of tetrafluoroethylene, which was eventually developed into Teflon. Because of 
the resistance of the strong COF bonds to chemical attack, Teflon is an inert, tough, 
and nonflammable material widely used for electrical insulation, nonstick coatings on 
cooking utensils, and bearings for low-temperature applications.
O
ne of the most amazing character-
istics of insects is their ability to 
cling to almost any surface, whether it 
is vertical or upside down. However, 
the walls of the Nepenthes pitcher plant 
are so slippery that any insect that 
lands on those walls slips to its death in 
the digestive juices at the bottom of 
the ‚Äúpitcher.‚Äù One can envision this type 
of slippery surface being useful in 
human activities, such as in pipes for 
handling biomedical fluids and fuels. 
Slippery surfaces also could be useful 
in repelling ice inside freezers or on 
ship hulls used in polar regions.
Joanna Aizenberg and her col-
leagues at Harvard University have 
designed a synthetic system that mim-
ics the slippery pitcher plant surface. 
Their omniphobic (repels virtually all 
liquids) surface, which they call SLIPS, is 
prepared from a porous network of 
Teflon nanofibers that is infused with a 
special oil-and-water fluid. It is the layer 
of fluid on the surface of the Teflon 
‚Äúsponge‚Äù that makes SLIPS so slippery. 
Another advantage of SLIPS is its self-
healing property. If any damage occurs 
to the surface, more fluid flows from 
the interior to heal cracks or dents. The 
surface can be maintained indefinitely 
because a reservoir of fluid sustains the 
fluid.
SLIPS is a great example of how 
useful it can be to mimic nature‚Äôs 
problem-solving skills.

Other polyethylene-type polymers are made from monomers containing chloro, 
methyl, cyano, and phenyl substituents, as summarized in Table 22.7. In each case the 
double carbon‚Äìcarbon bond in the substituted ethylene monomer becomes a single 
bond in the polymer. The different substituents lead to a wide variety of properties.
 
The polyethylene polymers illustrate one of the major types of polymerization reac-
tions, called addition polymerization, in which the monomers simply ‚Äúadd together‚Äù 
to produce the polymer. No other products are formed. The polymerization process is 
initiated by a free radical (a species with an unpaired electron) such as the hydroxyl 
radical (HO?). The free radical attacks and breaks the p bond of an ethylene molecule 
to form a new free radical,

Repetition of this process thousands of times creates a long-chain polymer. Termina-
tion of the growth of the chain occurs when two radicals react to form a bond, a pro-
cess that consumes two radicals without producing any others.
 
Another common type of polymerization is condensation polymerization, in 
which a small molecule, such as water, is formed for each extension of the polymer 
chain. The most familiar polymer produced by condensation is nylon. Nylon is a  
copolymer, since two different types of monomers combine to form the chain; a  
homopolymer is the result of polymerizing a single type of monomer. One common 
form of nylon is produced when hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid react by split-
ting out a water molecule to form a CON bond:

The molecule formed, called a dimer (two monomers joined), can undergo further 
condensation reactions since it has an amino group at one end and a carboxyl group at 
the other. Thus both ends are free to react with another monomer. Repetition of this 
process leads to a long chain of the type

which is the basic structure of nylon. The reaction to form nylon occurs quite readily 
and is often used as a lecture demonstration (Fig. 22.16). The properties of nylon can 
be varied by changing the number of carbon atoms in the chain of the acid or amine 
monomer.
 
More than 1 million tons of nylon is produced annually in the United States for use 
in clothing, carpets, rope, and so on. Many other types of condensation polymers are 
also produced. For example, Dacron is a copolymer formed from the condensation 
reaction of ethylene glycol (a dialcohol) and p-terephthalic acid (a dicarboxylic acid):

Polymers Based on Ethylene
A large section of the polymer industry involves the production of macromolecules 
from ethylene or substituted ethylenes. As discussed previously, ethylene molecules 
polymerize by addition after the double bond has been broken by some initiator:

This process continues by adding new ethylene molecules to eventually give polyeth-
ylene, a thermoplastic material.
 
There are two forms of polyethylene: low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and high-
density polyethylene (HDPE). The chains in LDPE contain many branches and thus 
do not pack as tightly as those in HDPE, which consist of mostly straight-chain 
molecules.
 
Traditionally, LDPE has been manufactured under conditions of high pressure 
(<20,000 psi) and high temperature (5008C). These severe reaction conditions require 
specially designed equipment, and for safety reasons the reaction usually has been run 
behind a reinforced concrete barrier. More recently, lower reaction pressures and tem-
peratures have become possible through the use of catalysts. One catalytic system 
using triethylaluminum, Al(C2H5)3, and titanium(IV) chloride was developed by Karl 
Ziegler in Germany and Giulio Natta in Italy. Although this catalyst is very efficient, it 
catches fire on contact with air and must be handled very carefully. A safer catalytic 
system was developed at Phillips Petroleum Company. It uses a chromium(III) oxide 
(Cr2O3) and aluminosilicate catalyst and has mainly taken over in the United States. 
The product of the catalyzed reaction is highly linear (unbranched) and is often called 
linear low-density polyethylene. It is very similar to HDPE.
 
The major use of LDPE is in the manufacture of the tough, transparent film that is 
used in packaging so many consumer goods. Two-thirds of the approximately 10 bil-
lion pounds of LDPE produced annually in the United States are used for this purpose. 
The major use of HDPE is for blow-molded products, such as bottles for consumer 
products (Fig. 22.17).
 
The useful properties of polyethylene are due primarily to its high molecular weight 
(molar mass). Although the strengths of the interactions between specific points on the 
nonpolar chains are quite small, the chains are so long that these small attractions 
accumulate to a very significant value, so that the chains stick together very tena-
ciously. There is also a great deal of physical tangling of the lengthy chains. The com-
bination of these interactions gives the polymer strength and toughness. However, a 
material like polyethylene can be melted and formed into a new shape (thermoplastic 
behavior),  because in the melted state the molecules can readily flow past one another.
psi is the abbreviation for pounds per 
square inch: 15 psi < 1 atm.
Molecular weight (not molar mass) is the 
common terminology in the polymer 
industry.

Since a high molecular weight gives a polymer useful properties, one might think that 
the goal would be to produce polymers with chains as long as possible. However, this is 
not the case‚Äîpolymers become much more difficult to process as the molecular weights 
increase. Most industrial operations require that the polymer flow through pipes as it is 
processed. But as the chain lengths increase, viscosity also increases. In practice, the 
 upper limit of a polymer‚Äôs molecular weight is set by the flow requirements of the manu-
facturing process. Thus the final product often reflects a compromise between the opti-
mal properties for the application and those needed for ease of processing.
 
Although many polymer properties are greatly influenced by molecular weight, some 
other important properties are not. For example, chain length does not affect a polymer‚Äôs 
resistance to chemical attack. Physical properties such as color, refractive index, hardness, 
density, and electrical conductivity are also not greatly influenced by molecular weight.
 
We have already seen that one way of altering the strength of a polymeric material 
is to vary the chain length. Another method for modifying polymer behavior involves 
varying the substituents. For example, if we use a monomer of the type
C
H
H

the properties of the resulting polymer depend on the identity of X. The simplest 
example is polypropylene, whose monomer is

The chain arrangement has a significant effect on the polymer‚Äôs properties. Most 
polypropylene is made using the Ziegler-Natta catalyst, Al(C2H5)3 ? TiCl4, which pro-
duces highly isotactic chains that pack together quite closely. As a result, polypropyl-
ene is more crystalline, and therefore stronger and harder, than polyethylene. The 
major uses of polypropylene are for molded parts (40%), fibers (35%), and packaging 
films (10%). Polypropylene fibers are especially useful for athletic wear because they 
do not absorb water from perspiration, as cotton does. Rather, the moisture is drawn 
away from the skin to the surface of the polypropylene garment, where it can evapo-
rate. The annual U.S. production of polypropylene is about 7 billion pounds.
 
Another related polymer, polystyrene, is constructed from the monomer styrene,

thus incorporating bits of butadiene rubber into the polystyrene matrix. The resulting 
polymer is very tough and is often used as a substitute for wood in furniture.
 
Another polystyrene-based product is acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), a tough, 
hard, and chemically resistant plastic used for pipes and for items such as radio housings, 
telephone cases, and golf club heads, for which shock resistance is an essential property.

22.6 Natural Polymers
Proteins
We have seen that many useful synthetic materials are polymers. Thus it should not be 
surprising that a great many natural materials are also polymers: starch, hair, silicate 
chains in soil and rocks, silk and cotton fibers, and the cellulose in woody plants, to 
name only a few.

22.6 Natural Polymers

In this section we will consider a class of natural polymers, the proteins, which 
make up about 15% of our bodies and have molecular weights (molar masses) that 
range from about 6000 to over 1,000,000 grams per mole. Proteins perform many 
functions in the human body. Fibrous proteins provide structural integrity and 
strength for many types of tissue and are the main components of muscle, hair, and 
cartilage. Other proteins, usually called globular proteins because of their roughly 
spherical shape, are the ‚Äúworker‚Äù  molecules of the body. These proteins transport and 
store oxygen and  nutrients, act as catalysts for the thousands of reactions that make life 
possible, fight  invasion by foreign objects, participate in the body‚Äôs many regulatory 
systems, and transport electrons in the complex process of metabolizing nutrients.
 
The building blocks of all proteins are the a-amino acids, where R may represent 
H, CH3, or a more complex substituent. These molecules are called a-amino acids 
because the amino group (ONH2) is always attached to the a-carbon, the one next to 
the carboxyl group (OCO2H). The 20 amino acids most commonly found in proteins 
are shown in Fig. 22.18.
 
Note from Fig. 22.18 that the amino acids are grouped into polar and nonpolar 
classes, determined by the R groups, or side chains. Nonpolar side chains contain 
mostly carbon and hydrogen atoms, whereas polar side chains contain large numbers 
of nitrogen and oxygen atoms. This difference is important, because polar side 
chains are hydrophilic (water-loving), but nonpolar side chains are hydrophobic 
(water-fearing), and this characteristic greatly affects the three-dimensional struc-
ture of the  resulting protein.
 
The protein polymer is built by condensation reactions between amino acids. For 
example,

The product shown before is called a dipeptide. This name is used because the 
structure
C

is called a peptide linkage by biochemists. (The same grouping is called an amide by 
organic chemists.) Additional condensation reactions lengthen the chain to produce a 
polypeptide, eventually yielding a protein.
 
You can imagine that with 20 amino acids, which can be assembled in any order, 
there is essentially an infinite variety possible in the construction of proteins. This flex-
ibility allows an organism to tailor proteins for the many types of functions that must 
be carried out.
 
The order, or sequence, of amino acids in the protein chain is called the primary 
structure, conveniently indicated by using three-letter codes for the amino acids (see 
Fig. 22.18), where it is understood that the terminal carboxyl group is on the right and 
the terminal amino group is on the left. For example, one possible sequence for a tri-
peptide containing the amino acids lysine, alanine, and leucine is

At the pH in biological fluids, the amino 
acids shown in Fig. 22.18 exist in a different 
form, with the proton of the OCOOH group 
transferred to the ONH2 group. For example, 
glycine would be in the form H31NCH2COO2.
The peptide linkage is also found in nylon 
(see Section 22.5).

Note from Example 22.7 that there are six sequences possible for a polypeptide 
with three given amino acids. There are three possibilities for the first amino acid 
(any one of the three given amino acids), there are two possibilities for the second 
amino acid (one has already been accounted for), but there is only one possibility left 
for the third amino acid. Thus the number of sequences is 3 3 2 3 1 5 6. The prod-
uct 3 3 2 3 1 is often written 3! (and is called 3 factorial). Similar reasoning shows 
that for a polypeptide with four amino acids, there are 4!, or 4 3 3 3 2 3 1 5 24, 
possible sequences.

A striking example of the importance of the primary structure of polypeptides can 
be seen in the differences between oxytocin and vasopressin. Both of these molecules 
are nine-unit polypeptides that differ by only two amino acids (Fig. 22.19), yet they 
perform completely different functions in the human body. Oxytocin is a hormone that 
triggers contraction of the uterus and milk secretion. Vasopressin raises blood pressure 
levels and regulates kidney function.
 
A second level of structure in proteins, beyond the sequence of amino acids, is the 
arrangement of the chain of the long molecule. The secondary structure is deter-
mined to a large extent by hydrogen bonding between lone pairs on an oxygen atom in 
the carbonyl group of an amino acid and a hydrogen atom attached to a nitrogen of 
another amino acid:

Such interactions can occur within the chain coils to form a spiral structure called 
an a-helix, as shown in Figs. 22.20 and 22.21. This type of secondary structure gives 
the protein elasticity (springiness) and is found in the fibrous proteins in wool, hair, 
and tendons. Hydrogen bonding can also occur between different protein chains, join-
ing them together in an arrangement called a pleated sheet, as shown in Fig. 22.22. 
Silk contains this arrangement of proteins, making its fibers flexible yet very strong

and resistant to stretching. The pleated sheet is also found in muscle fibers. The hydro-
gen bonds in the a-helical protein are called intrachain (within a given protein chain), 
and those in the pleated sheet are said to be interchain (between protein chains).
 
As you might imagine, a molecule as large as a protein has a great deal of flexibility 
and can assume a variety of overall shapes. The specific shape that a protein assumes 
depends on its function. For long, thin structures, such as hair, wool and silk fibers, and 
tendons, an elongated shape is required. This may involve an a-helical secondary 
 structure, as found in the protein a-keratin in hair and wool or in the collagen found in

tendons [Fig. 22.23(a)], or it may involve a pleated-sheet secondary structure, as found 
in silk [Fig. 22.23(b)]. Many of the proteins in the body having nonstructural functions 
are globular, such as myoglobin (see Fig. 21.31). Note that the secondary structure of 
myoglobin is basically a-helical. However, in the areas where the chain bends to give 
the protein its compact globular structure, the a-helix breaks down to give a secondary 
configuration known as the random-coil arrangement.
 
The overall shape of the protein, long and narrow or globular, is called its tertiary 
structure and is maintained by several different types of interactions: hydrogen bond-
ing, dipole‚Äìdipole interactions, ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and London dispersion 
forces between nonpolar groups. These bonds, which represent all the bonding types 
discussed in this text, are summarized in Fig. 22.24.
 
The amino acid cysteine

plays a special role in stabilizing the tertiary structure of many proteins because the 
OSH groups on two cysteines can react in the presence of an oxidizing agent to form 
a SOS bond called a disulfide linkage:

A practical application of the chemistry of disulfide bonds is permanent waving of 
hair, as summarized in Fig. 22.25. The SOS linkages in the protein of hair are broken 
by treatment with a reducing agent. The hair is then set in curlers to change the tertiary 
protein structure to the desired shape. Then treatment with an oxidizing agent causes 
new SOS bonds to form, which allow the hair protein to retain the new structure.
 
The three-dimensional structure of a protein is crucial to its function. The process 
of breaking down this structure is called denaturation (Fig. 22.26). For example, the 
denaturation of egg proteins occurs when an egg is cooked. Any source of energy can 
cause denaturation of proteins and is thus potentially dangerous to living organisms. 
For example, ultraviolet and X-ray radiation or nuclear radioactivity can disrupt pro-
tein structure, which may lead to cancer or genetic damage. Protein damage is also 
caused by chemicals like benzene, trichloroethane, and 1,2-dibromoethane. The met-
als lead and mercury, which have a very high affinity for sulfur, cause protein denatur-
ation by disrupting disulfide bonds between protein chains.
 
The tremendous flexibility in the various levels of protein structure allows the tai-
loring of proteins for a wide range of specific functions. Proteins are the ‚Äúworkhorse‚Äù 
molecules of living organisms.

CRITICAL THINKING
What if you contracted a disease that prevents all hydrogen bonding in 
proteins? Could you live with such a condition?
Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates form another class of biologically important molecules. They serve as 
a food source for most organisms and as a structural material for plants. Because many 
carbohydrates have the empirical formula CH2O, it was originally believed that these 
substances were hydrates of carbon, thus accounting for the name.
 
Most important carbohydrates, such as starch and cellulose, are polymers com-
posed of monomers called monosaccharides, or simple sugars. The monosaccha-
rides are polyhydroxy ketones and aldehydes. The most important contain five carbon 
atoms (pentoses) or six carbon atoms (hexoses). One important hexose is fructose, a 
sugar found in honey and fruit. Its structure is

isomers. For example, the simplest sugar, glyceraldehyde,

which has one chiral carbon, has two optical isomers, as shown in Fig. 22.28.
 
In fructose each of the three chiral carbon atoms satisfies the requirement of being 
surrounded by four different groups. This leads to a total of 23, or 8, isomers that differ 
in their ability to rotate polarized light. The particular isomer whose structure is shown 
in Table 22.8 is called d-fructose. Generally, monosaccharides have one isomer that is 
more common in nature than the others. The most important pentoses and hexoses are 
shown in Table 22.8.

mong today‚Äôs best-selling cosmet-
ics are self-tanning lotions. Many 
light-skinned people want to look like 
they have just spent a vacation in the 
Caribbean, but they recognize the 
dangers of too much sun‚Äîit causes 
premature aging and may lead to skin 
cancer. Chemistry has come to the 
rescue in the form of lotions that pro-
duce an authentic-looking tan. All of 
these lotions have the same active 
ingredient: dihydroxyacetone (DHA). 
DHA, which has the structure

is a nontoxic, simple sugar that occurs 
as an intermediate in carbohydrate 
metabolism in higher-order plants and

prepared by bacterial fermentation of 
glycerine,

The tanning effects of DHA were 
discovered by accident in the 1950s at 
Children‚Äôs Hospital at the University of 
Cincinnati, where DHA was being used 
to treat children with glycogen storage 
disease. When the DHA was acciden-
tally spilled on the skin, it produced 
brown spots.
The mechanism of the browning 
process involves the Maillard reaction, 
which was discovered by Louis-Camille 
Maillard in 1912. In this process amino 
acids react with sugars to create 
brown or golden brown products. The 
same reaction is responsible for much 
of the browning that occurs during 
the manufacture and storage of foods. 
It is also the reason that beer is golden 
brown.
The browning of skin occurs in the 
stratum corneum‚Äîthe outermost, 
dead layer‚Äîwhere the DHA reacts with 
free amino (ONH2) groups of the pro-
teins found there.
DHA is present in most tanning 
lotions at concentrations between 2% 
and 5%, although some products 
designed to give a deeper tan are more 
concentrated. Because the lotions 
themselves turn brown above pH 7, the 
tanning lotions are buffered at pH 5.
Thanks to these new products, 
tanning is now both safe and easy.

We must look for carbon atoms that have four different substituents. The top carbon has 
only three substituents and thus cannot be chiral. The three carbon atoms shown in

Although we have so far represented the monosaccharides as straight-chain mole-
cules, they usually cyclize, or form a ring structure, in aqueous solution. Figure 22.29 
shows this reaction for fructose. Note that a new bond is formed between the oxygen 
of the terminal hydroxyl group and the carbon of the ketone group. In the cyclic form 
fructose is a five-membered ring containing a COOOC bond. The same type of  
reaction can occur between a hydroxyl group and an aldehyde group, as shown for  
d-glucose in Fig. 22.30. In this case a six-membered ring is formed.

More complex carbohydrates are formed by combining monosaccharides. For 
example, sucrose, common table sugar, is a disaccharide formed from glucose and 
fructose by elimination of water to form a COOOC bond between the rings, which 
is called a glycoside linkage (Fig. 22.31). When sucrose is consumed in food, the 
above reaction is reversed. An enzyme in saliva catalyzes the breakdown of this 
disaccharide.
 
Large polymers consisting of many monosaccharide units, called polysaccharides, 
can form when each ring forms two glycoside linkages, as shown in Fig. 22.32. Three 
of the most important of these polymers are starch, cellulose, and glycogen. All these 
substances are polymers of glucose, differing from each other in the nature of the gly-
coside linkage, the amount of branching, and molecular weight (molar mass).
 
Starch, a polymer of a-d-glucose, consists of two parts: amylose, a straight-chain 
polymer of a-glucose [see Fig. 22.32(a)], and amylopectin, a highly branched polymer 
of a-glucose with a molecular weight that is 10 to 20 times that of amylose. Branching 
occurs when a third glycoside linkage attaches a branch to the main polymer chain.

Starch, the carbohydrate reservoir in plants, is the form in which glucose is stored 
by the plant for later use as cellular fuel. Glucose is stored in this high-molecular-
weight form because it results in less stress on the plant‚Äôs internal structure by osmotic 
pressure. Recall from Section 11.6 that it is the concentration of solute molecules (or 
ions) that determines the osmotic pressure. Combining the individual glucose mole-
cules into one large chain keeps the concentration of solute molecules relatively low, 
minimizing the osmotic pressure.
 
Cellulose, the major structural component of woody plants and natural fibers (such 
as cotton), is a polymer of b-d-glucose and has the structure shown in Fig. 22.32(b). 
Note that the b-glycoside linkages in cellulose give the glucose rings a different relative 
orientation than is found in starch. Although this difference may seem minor, it has very 
important consequences. The human digestive system contains a-glycosidases, 
enzymes that can catalyze breakage of the a-glycoside bonds in starch. These enzymes 
are not effective on the b-glycoside bonds of cellulose, presumably because the differ-
ent structure results in a poor fit between the enzyme‚Äôs active site and the carbohydrate. 
The enzymes necessary to cleave b-glycoside linkages, the b-glycosidases, are found in 
bacteria that exist in the digestive tracts of termites, cows, deer, and many other ani-
mals. Thus, unlike humans, these animals can derive nutrition from cellulose.
 
Glycogen, the main carbohydrate reservoir in animals, has a structure similar to 
that of amylopectin but with more branching. It is this branching that is thought to 
facilitate the rapid breakdown of glycogen into glucose when energy is required.
Nucleic Acids
Life is possible only because each cell, when it divides, can transmit the vital informa-
tion about how it works to the next generation. It has been known for a long time that this 
process involves the chromosomes in the nucleus of the cell. Only since 1953, however, 
have scientists understood the molecular basis of this intriguing cellular ‚Äútalent.‚Äù
 
The substance that stores and transmits the genetic information is a polymer called 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), a huge molecule with a molecular weight as high as 
several billion grams per mole. Together with other similar nucleic acids called the 
ribonucleic acids (RNA), DNA is also responsible for the synthesis of the various 
proteins needed by the cell to carry out its life functions. The RNA molecules, which 
are found in the cytoplasm outside the nucleus, are much smaller than DNA polymers, 
with molecular weights of only 20,000 to 40,000 grams per mole.

The monomers of the nucleic acids, called nucleotides, are composed of three dis-
tinct parts:
1. a five-carbon sugar, deoxyribose in DNA and ribose in RNA (Fig. 22.33)
2. a nitrogen-containing organic base of the type shown in Fig. 22.34
3. a phosphoric acid molecule (H3PO4)
The base and the sugar combine as shown in Fig. 22.35(a) to form a unit that in turn 
reacts with phosphoric acid to create the nucleotide, which is an ester [Fig. 22.35(b)].

The nucleotides become connected through condensation reactions that eliminate 
water to give a polymer of the type represented in Fig. 22.36; such a polymer can con-
tain a billion units.
 
The key to DNA‚Äôs functioning is its double-helical structure with complementary 
bases on the two strands. The bases form hydrogen bonds to each other, as shown in 
Fig. 22.37. Note that the structures of cytosine and guanine make them perfect partners 
for hydrogen bonding, and they are always found as pairs on the two strands of DNA. 
Thymine and adenine form similar hydrogen-bonding pairs.
 
There is much evidence to suggest that the two strands of DNA unwind during cell 
division and that new complementary strands are constructed on the unraveled strands 
(Fig. 22.38). Because the bases on the strands always pair in the same way‚Äîcytosine 
with guanine and thymine with adenine‚Äîeach unraveled strand serves as a template 
for attaching the complementary bases (along with the rest of the nucleotide). This 
process results in two double-helix DNA structures that are identical to the original 
one. Each new double strand contains one strand from the original DNA double helix 
and one newly synthesized strand. This replication of DNA allows for the transmission 
of genetic information as the cells divide.
 
The other major function of DNA is protein synthesis. A given segment of the 
DNA, called a gene, contains the code for a specific protein. These codes transmit the 
primary structure of the protein (the sequence of amino acids) to the construction 
‚Äúmachinery‚Äù of the cell. There is a specific code for each amino acid in the protein, 
which ensures that the correct amino acid will be inserted as the protein chain grows. 
A code consists of a set of three bases called a codon.
 
DNA stores the genetic information, while RNA molecules are responsible for 
transmitting this information to the ribosomes, where protein synthesis actually occurs. 
This complex process involves, first, the construction of a special RNA molecule

called messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA is built in the cell nucleus on the appro-
priate section of DNA (the gene); the double helix is ‚Äúunzipped,‚Äù and the complemen-
tarity of the bases is used in a process similar to that used in DNA replication. The 
mRNA then migrates into the cytoplasm of the cell where, with the assistance of the 
ribosomes, the protein is synthesized.
 
Small RNA fragments, called transfer RNA (tRNA), are tailored to find specific 
amino acids and then to attach them to the growing protein chain as dictated by the 
codons in the mRNA. Transfer RNA has a lower molecular weight than messenger 
RNA. It consists of a chain of 75 to 80 nucleotides, including the bases adenine, cyto-
sine, guanine, and uracil, among others. The chain folds back onto itself in various 
places as the complementary bases along the chain form hydrogen bonds. The tRNA 
decodes the genetic message from the mRNA, using a complementary triplet of bases 
called an anticodon. The nature of the anticodon governs which amino acid will be 
brought to the protein under construction.
 
The protein is built in several steps. First, a tRNA molecule brings an amino acid to 
the mRNA [the anticodon of the tRNA must complement the codon of the mRNA 
(Fig.¬†22.39)]. Once this amino acid is in place, another tRNA moves to the second 
codon site of the mRNA with its specific amino acid. The two amino acids link via a 
peptide bond, and the tRNA on the first codon breaks away. The process is repeated 
down the chain, always matching the tRNA anticodon with the mRNA codon.

What is the other reactant in a combustion reaction, and 
what are the products, assuming the organic compound 
contains only C, H, and perhaps O?
 
The following are some other organic reactions cov-
ered in Section 22.4. Give an example to illustrate each 
type of reaction.
a. Adding H2O to an alkene (in the presence of H1) 
yields an alcohol.
b. Primary alcohols are oxidized to aldehydes, which 
can be further oxidized to carboxylic acids.
c. Secondary alcohols are oxidized to ketones.
d. Reacting an alcohol with a carboxylic acid (in the 
presence of H1) produces an ester.
 9. Define and give an example of each of the following.
a. addition polymer
b. condensation polymer
c. copolymer
d. homopolymer
e. polyester
f. polyamide
Distinguish between a thermoset polymer and a thermo-
plastic polymer. How do the physical properties of 
polymers depend on chain length and extent of chain 
branching? Explain how crosslinking agents are used to 
change the physical properties of polymers. Isotactic 
polypropylene makes stronger fibers than atactic poly-
propylene. Explain. In which polymer, polyethylene or 
polyvinyl chloride, would you expect to find the stron-
ger intermolecular forces (assuming the average chain 
lengths are equal)?
 10. Give the general formula for an amino acid. Some 
amino acids are labeled hydrophilic and some are 
labeled hydrophobic. What do these terms refer to? 
Aqueous solutions of amino acids are buffered solu-
tions. Explain. Most of the amino acids in Fig. 22.18 
are optically active. Explain. What is a peptide bond? 
Show how glycine, serine, and alanine react to form a 
tripeptide. What is a protein, and what are the mono-
mers in proteins? Distinguish between the primary, 
secondary, and tertiary structures of a protein. Give 
examples of the types of forces that maintain each type 
of structure. Describe how denaturation affects the 
function of a protein.
 11. What are carbohydrates, and what are the monomers in 
carbohydrates? The monosaccharides in Table 22.8 are 
all optically active. Explain. What is a disaccharide? 
Which monosaccharide units make up the disaccharide 
sucrose? What do you call the bond that forms between 
the monosaccharide units? What is the difference 
between starch, cellulose, and glycogen?
 6. Distinguish between isomerism and resonance. Distin-
guish between structural and geometrical isomerism. 
When writing the various structural isomers, the most 
difficult task is identifying which are different isomers 
and which are identical to a previously written structure‚Äî 
that is, which are compounds that differ only by the 
rotation of a carbon single bond. How do you distin-
guish between structural isomers and those that are 
identical?
 
Alkenes and cycloalkanes are structural isomers of 
each other. Give an example of each using C4H8. 
Another common feature of alkenes and cycloalkanes is 
that both have restricted rotation about one or more 
bonds in the compound, so both can exhibit cis‚Äìtrans 
isomerism. What is required for an alkene or cycloal-
kane to exhibit cis‚Äìtrans isomerism? Explain the differ-
ence between cis and trans isomers.
 
Alcohols and ethers are structural isomers of each 
other, as are aldehydes and ketones. Give an example of 
each to illustrate. Which functional group in Table 22.4 
can be structural isomers of carboxylic acids?
 
What is optical isomerism? What do you look for to 
determine whether an organic compound exhibits opti-
cal isomerism? 1-Bromo-1-chloroethane is optically 
active whereas 1-bromo-2-chloroethane is not optically 
active. Explain.
 7. What type of intermolecular forces do hydrocarbons 
exhibit? Explain why the boiling point of n-heptane is 
greater than that of n-butane. A general rule for a group 
of hydrocarbon isomers is that as the amount of branch-
ing increases, the boiling point decreases. Explain why 
this would be true.
 
The functional groups listed in Table 22.4 all exhibit 
London dispersion forces, but they also usually exhibit 
additional dipole‚Äìdipole forces. Explain why this is the 
case for each functional group. Although alcohols and 
ethers are structural isomers of each other, alcohols 
always boil at significantly higher temperatures than 
similar-size ethers. Explain. What would you expect 
when comparing the boiling points of similar-size car-
boxylic acids to esters? CH3CH2CH3, CH3CH2OH, 
CH3CHO, and HCOOH all have about the same molar 
mass, but they boil at very different temperatures. Why? 
Place these compounds in order by increasing boiling 
point.
 8. Distinguish between substitution and addition reactions. 
Give an example of each type of reaction. Alkanes and 
aromatics are fairly stable compounds. To make them 
react, a special catalyst must be present. What catalyst 
must be present when reacting Cl2 with an alkane or 
with benzene? Adding Cl2 to an alkene or alkyne does 
not require a special catalyst. Why are alkenes and 
alkynes more reactive than al kanes and aromatic com-
pounds? All organic compounds can be combusted.

the replication of the DNA molecule during cell divi-

 carbon‚Äìcarbon double and triple bonds, with H forming a 
bond to one of the carbon atoms in the multiple bond and Cl,

 101. Oxygen is carried from the lungs to tissues by the protein 
hemoglobin in red blood cells. Sickle cell anemia is a disease 
resulting from abnormal hemoglobin molecules in which a 
valine is substituted for a single glutamic acid in normal

have been detected in humans. Unlike sickle cell anemia (see 
Exercise 101), not all of these mutations are as serious. In one

 157. Ethyl caprate is an ester used in the manufacture of wine bou-
quets. It is sometimes called ‚Äúcognac essence.‚Äù Combustion 
analysis of a sample of ethyl caprate shows it to be 71.89%¬†C, 
12.13% hydrogen, and 15.98% O by mass. Hydrolysis (reac-
tion with water) of the ester produces ethanol and a carboxylic

 159. The isoelectric point of an amino acid is the pH at which the 
molecule has no net charge. For glycine, that point would be 
the pH at which virtually all glycine molecules are in the form 
1H3NCH2CO22. This form of glycine is amphoteric since it 
can act as both an acid and a base. If we assume that the prin-
cipal equilibrium at the isoelectric point has the best acid 
reacting with the best base present, then the reaction is
 
 
21H3NCH2CO2
2 m H2NCH2CO2
2 1 1H3NCH2CO2H (i)
Assuming this reaction is the principal equilibrium, then the 
following relationship must hold true:

A1.1 Exponential Notation
The numbers characteristic of scientific measurements are often very large or very 
small; thus it is convenient to express them using powers of 10. For example, the num-
ber 1,300,000 can be expressed as 1.3 3 106, which means multiply 1.3 by 10 six 
times, or
1.3 3 106 3 1.3 3 10 3 10 3 10 3 10 3 10 3 10
 
106 5 1 million
Note that each multiplication by 10 moves the decimal point one place to the right:
 1.3 3 10 5 13.
 13 3 10 5 130.
 130 3 10 5 1300.
(
Thus the easiest way to interpret the notation 1.3 3 106 is that it means move the  
decimal point in 1.3 to the right six times:
1.3 3 106 5 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 5 1,300,000
 
1 2 3 4 5 6
 
Using this notation, the number 1985 can be expressed as 1.985 3 103. Note that 
the usual convention is to write the number that appears before the power of 10 as a 
number between 1 and 10. To end up with the number 1.985, which is between 1 and 
10, we had to move the decimal point three places to the left. To compensate for that, 
we must multiply by 103, which says that to get the intended number we start with 
1.985 and move the decimal point three places to the right; that is:
1.985 3 103 5 1 9 8 5.

So far we have considered numbers greater than 1. How do we represent a number 
such as 0.0034 in exponential notation? We start with a number between 1 and 10 and 
 divide by the appropriate power of 10:
0.0034 5
3.4
10 3 10 3 10 5 3.4
103 5 3.4 3 1023

Division by 10 moves the decimal point one place to the left. Thus the number
0. 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 4
 
7 6 5 4 3 2 1
can be written as 1.4 3 1027.
 
To summarize, we can write any number in the form
N 3 106n
where N is between 1 and 10 and the exponent n is an integer. If the sign preceding n 
is positive, it means the decimal point in N should be moved n places to the right. If a 
negative sign precedes n, the decimal point in N should be moved n places to the left.
Multiplication and Division
When two numbers expressed in exponential notation are multiplied, the initial num-
bers are multiplied and the exponents of 10 are added:
1M 3 10m2 1N 3 10n2 5 1MN2 3 10m1n
For example (to two significant figures, as required),
13.2 3 1042 12.8 3 1032 5 9.0 3 107
When the numbers are multiplied, if a result greater than 10 is obtained for the initial 
number, the decimal point is moved one place to the left and the exponent of 10 is in-
creased by 1:
15.8 3 1022 14.3 3 1082  5 24.9 3 1010
 5 2.49 3 1011
 5 2.5  3 1011¬†¬†1two significant figures2
 
Division of two numbers expressed in exponential notation involves normal divi-
sion of the initial numbers and subtraction of the exponent of the divisor from that of 
the dividend. For example,
4.8 3 108
2.1 3 103 5 4.8
2.1 3 1018232 5 2.3 3 105
 
Divisor
If the initial number resulting from the division is less than 1, the decimal point is 
moved one place to the right and the exponent of 10 is decreased by 1. For example,
 6.4 3 103
8.3 3 105 5 6.4
8.3 3 1013252 5 0.77 3 1022
 
 5 7.7 3 1023
Addition and Subtraction
To add or subtract numbers expressed in exponential notation, the exponents of the 
numbers must be the same. For example, to add 1.31 3 105 and 4.2 3 104, we must 
rewrite one number so that the exponents of both are the same. The number 1.31 3 105 
can be written 13.1 3 104, since moving the decimal point one place to the right can 
be compensated for by decreasing the exponent by 1. Now we can add the numbers:
 13.1 3 104
 1 4.2 3 104
 17.3 3 104
.

In correct exponential notation the result is expressed as 1.73 3 105.
 
To perform addition or subtraction with numbers expressed in exponential notation, 
only the initial numbers are added or subtracted. The exponent of the result is the same as 
those of the numbers being added or subtracted. To subtract 1.8 3 102 from 8.99 3 103, 
we write
 8.99 3 103
 20.18 3 103
 8.81 3 103
Powers and Roots
When a number expressed in exponential notation is taken to some power, the initial 
number is taken to the appropriate power and the exponent of 10 is multiplied by that 
power:
1N 3 10n2 m 5 N m 3 10m#n
For example,*
 17.5 3 1022 3 5 7.53  3 103#2
 5 422  3 106
 5 4.22 3 108
 5 4.2  3 108¬†¬†1two significant figures2
 
When a root is taken of a number expressed in exponential notation, the root of the 
initial number is taken and the exponent of 10 is divided by the number representing 
the root:
"N 3 10n 5 1n 3 10n2 1/2 5 "N 3 10n/2
For example,
 12.9 3 1062 1/2 5 "2.9 3 106/2
 
 5 1.7 3 103
Because the exponent of the result must be an integer, we may sometimes have to 
change the form of the number so that the power divided by the root equals an integer. 
For example,
 "1.9 3 103 5 11.9 3 1032 1/2 5 10.19 3 1042 1/2
 5 "0.19 3 102
 5 0.44 3 102
 5 4.4 3 101
In this case, we moved the decimal point one place to the left and increased the expo-
nent from 3 to 4 to make ny2 an integer.
 
The same procedure is followed for roots other than square roots. For example,
 "
3 6.9 3 105 5 16.9 3 1052 1/3 5 10.69 3 1062 1/3
 5 "
3 0.69 3 102

A1.2 Logarithms
A logarithm is an exponent. Any number N can be expressed as follows:
N 5 10 x
For example,
 1000 5 103
 100 5 102
 10 5 101
 1 5 100
The common, or base 10, logarithm of a number is the power to which 10 must be 
taken to yield the number. Thus, since 1000 5 103,
log 1000 5 3
Similarly,
 log 1 00 5 2
 log 1 0 5 1
 log 1 5 0
For a number between 10 and 100, the required exponent of 10 will be between 1 and 
2. For example, 65 5 101.8129; that is, log 65 5 1.8129. For a number between 100  
and 1000, the exponent of 10 will be between 2 and 3. For example, 650 5 102.8129 and 
log 650 5 2.8129.
 
A number N greater than 0 and less than 1 can be expressed as follows:
N 5 102x 5
1
10 x
For example,
 0.001 5
1
1000 5 1
103 5 1023
 0.01 5
1
100 5 1
102 5 1022
 0.1 5 1
10 5 1
101 5 1021
Thus
 log 0 .001 5 23
 log 0 .01 5 22
 log 0 .1 5 21
 
Although common logs are often tabulated, the most convenient method for obtain-
ing such logs is to use an electronic calculator. On most calculators the number is first 
entered and then the log key is punched. The log of the number then appears in the 
display.* Some examples are given below. You should reproduce these results on your 
calculator to be sure that you can find common logs correctly.

Note that the number of digits after the decimal point in a common log is equal to the 
number of significant figures in the original number.
 
Since logs are simply exponents, they are manipulated according to the rules for 
exponents. For example, if A 5 10 x and B 5 10 y, then their product is
A # B 5 10 x # 10 y 5 10 x1y
and
log AB 5 x 1 y 5 log A 1 log B
For division, we have
A
B 5 10 x
10 y 5 10 x2y
and
log A
B 5 x 2 y 5 log A 2 log B
For a number raised to a power, we have
An 5 110 x2 n 5 10nx
and
log An 5 nx 5 n log A
It follows that
log 1
An 5 log A2n 5 2n log A
or, for n 5 1,
log 1
A 5 2log A
 
When a common log is given, to find the number it represents, we must carry out 
the process of exponentiation. For example, if the log is 2.673, then N 5 102.673. The 
process of exponentiation is also called taking the antilog, or the inverse logarithm. 
This operation is usually carried out on calculators in one of two ways. The majority 
of calculators require that the log be entered first and then the keys  inv  and  log 
pressed in succession. For example, to find N 5 102.673 we enter 2.673 and then press 
inv  and  log . The number 471 will be displayed; that is, N 5 471. Some calculators 
have a  10x  key. In that case, the log is entered first and then the  10x  key is pressed. 
Again, the number 471 will be displayed.
 
Natural logarithms, another type of logarithm, are based on the number 2.7183, 
which is referred to as e. In this case, a number is represented as N 5 ex 5 2.7183x. For 
example,
N 5 7.15 5 ex
ln 7.15 5 x 5 1.967
To find the natural log of a number using a calculator, the number is entered and then 
the  ln  key is pressed. Use the following examples to check your technique for finding 
natural logs with your calculator:

If a natural logarithm is given, to find the number it represents, exponentiation to 
the base e (2.7183) must be carried out. With many calculators this is done using a key 
marked   ex   (the natural log is entered, with the correct sign, and then the   ex   key is 
pressed). The other common method for exponentiation to base e is to enter the natural 
log and then press the  inv  and   ln   keys in succession. The following examples will 
help you check your technique:

Since natural logarithms are simply exponents, they are also manipulated according 
to the mathematical rules for exponents given earlier for common logs.
 
A1.3 Graphing Functions
In interpreting the results of a scientific experiment, it is often useful to make a graph. 
If possible, the function to be graphed should be in a form that gives a straight line. The 
equation for a straight line (a linear equation) can be represented by the general form
y 5 mx 1 b
where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, m is the slope, and b 
is the intercept with the y axis.
 
To illustrate the characteristics of a linear equation, the function y 5 3x 1 4 is plot-
ted in Fig. A.1. For this equation m 5 3 and b 5 4. Note that the y intercept occurs 
when x 5 0. In this case the intercept is 4, as can be seen from the equation (b 5 4).
 
The slope of a straight line is defined as the ratio of the rate of change in y to that in x:
m 5 slope 5 Dy
Dx
For the equation y 5 3x 1 4, y changes three times as fast as x (since x has a coefficient 
of 3). Thus the slope in this case is 3. This can be verified from the graph. For the tri-
angle shown in Fig. A.1,

Thus
Slope 5 Dy
Dx 5 24
8 5 3
 
The preceding example illustrates a general method for obtaining the slope of a line 
from the graph of that line. Simply draw a triangle with one side parallel to the y axis 
and the other parallel to the x axis as shown in Fig. A.1. Then determine the lengths of 
the sides to give y and x, respectively, and compute the ratio DyyDx.
 
Sometimes an equation that is not in standard form can be changed to the form  
y 5 mx 1 b by rearrangement or mathematical manipulation. An example is the equa-
tion k 5 Ae2Ea/RT described in Section 12.7, where A, Ea, and R are constants; k is the 
dependent variable; and 1yT is the independent variable. This equation can be changed 
to standard form by taking the natural logarithm of both sides,
ln k 5 ln Ae2Ea /RT 5 ln A 1 ln e2Ea /RT 5 ln A 2 Ea
RT
noting that the log of a product is equal to the sum of the logs of the individual terms 
and that the natural log of e2Ea/RT is simply the exponent 2EayRT. Thus, in standard 
form, the equation k 5 Ae2Ea/RT is written
ln k 5 2Ea
R a1
Tb 1 ln A

A plot of ln k versus 1yT (Fig. A.2) gives a straight line with slope 2EayR and intercept 
ln A.
 
Other linear equations that are useful in the study of chemistry are listed in standard 
form in Table A.1.
 
A1.4 Solving Quadratic Equations
A quadratic equation, a polynomial in which the highest power of x is 2, can be writ-
ten as
ax2 1 bx 1 c 5 0
One method for finding the two values of x that satisfy a quadratic equation is to use 
the quadratic formula:

 Slope  =  ‚àíEa

where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x2, x, and the constant, respectively. For 
 example, in determining [H1] in a solution of 1.0 3 1024 M acetic acid the following 
 expression arises:
1.8 3 1025 5
x2
1.0 3 1024 2 x
which yields
x2 1 11.8 3 10252x 2 1.8 3 1029 5 0
where a 5 1, b 5 1.8 3 1025, and c 5 21.8 3 1029. Using the quadratic formula, we 
have
 x 5 2b 6 "b2 2 4ac
2a
 5 21.8 3 1025 6 "3.24 3 10210 2 142 112 121.8 3 10292

 5 21.8 3 1025 6 8.7 3 1025

Thus
x 5 6.9 3 1025
2
5 3.5 3 1025
and
x 5 210.5 3 1025
2
5 25.2 3 1025
Note that there are two roots, as there always will be, for a polynomial in x2. In this 
case x represents a concentration of H1 (see Section 14.3). Thus the positive root is the 
one that solves the problem, since a concentration cannot be a negative number.
 
A second method for solving quadratic equations is by successive approximations, 
a systematic method of trial and error. A value of x is guessed and substituted into the 
equation everywhere x (or x2) appears, except for one place. For example, for the 
equation
x2 1 11.8 3 10252x 2 1.8 3 1029 5 0
we might guess x 5 2 3 1025. Substituting that value into the equation gives
x2 1 11.8 3 10252 12 3 10252 2 1.8 3 1029 5 0
or
x2 5 1.8 3 1029 2 3.6 3 10210 5 1.4 3 1029
Thus
x 5 3.7 3 1025
Note that the guessed value of x (2 3 105) is not the same as the value of x that is cal-
culated (3.7 3 1025) after inserting the estimated value. This means that x 5 2 3 1025 
is not the correct solution, and we must try another guess. We take the calculated value 
(3.7 3 1025) as our next guess:
x2 1 11.8 3 10252 13.7 3 10252 2 1.8 3 1029 5 0
x2 5 1.8 3 1029 2 6.7 3 10210 5 1.1 3 1029

Thus
x 5 3.3 3 1025
Now we compare the two values of x again:
 Guessed:¬†
 x 5 3.7 3 1025
 Calculated:¬† x 5 3.3 3 1025
These values are closer but not close enough. Next we try 3.3 3 1025 as our guess:
x2 1 11.8 3 10252 13.3 3 10252 2 1.8 3 1029 5 0
x2 5 1.8 3 1029 2 5.9 3 10210 5 1.2 3 1029
Thus

Again we compare:
 Guessed:¬†
 x 5 3.3 3 1025
 Calculated:¬† x 5 3.5 3 1025
Next we guess x 5 3.5 3 1025 to give
x2 1 11.8 3 10252 13.5 3 10252 2 1.8 3 1029 5 0
x2 5 1.8 3 1029 2 6.3 3 10210 5 1.2 3 1029
Thus
x 5 3.5 3 1025
Now the guessed value and the calculated value are the same; we have found the cor-
rect solution. Note that this agrees with one of the roots found with the quadratic for-
mula in the first method.
 
To further illustrate the method of successive approximations, we will solve Ex-
ample 14.17 using this procedure. In solving for [H1] for 0.010 M H2SO4, we obtain 
the  following expression:
1.2 3 1022 5 x 10.010 1 x2
0.010 2 x
which can be rearranged to give
x 5 11.2 3 10222 a0.010 2 x
0.010 1 xb
We will guess a value for x, substitute it into the right side of the equation, and then 
calculate a value for x. In guessing a value for x, we know it must be less than 0.010, 
since a larger value will make the calculated value for x negative and the guessed and 
calculated values will never match. We start by guessing x 5 0.005.
 
The results of the successive approximations are shown in the following table:

Note that the first guess was close to the actual value and that there was oscillation 
between 0.004 and 0.005 for the guessed and calculated values. For trial 3, an average 
of these values was used as the guess, and this led rapidly to the correct value (0.0045 
to the correct number of significant figures). Also, note that it is useful to carry extra 
digits until the correct value is obtained. That value can then be rounded off to the cor-
rect number of significant figures.
 
The method of successive approximations is especially useful for solving polyno-
mials containing x to a power of 3 or higher. The procedure is the same as for qua-
dratic equations: Substitute a guessed value for x into the equation for every x term 
but one, and then solve for x. Continue this process until the guessed and calculated 
values agree.
 
A1.5 Uncertainties in Measurements
Like all the physical sciences, chemistry is based on the results of measurements. 
Every measurement has an inherent uncertainty, so if we are to use the results of 
measurements to reach conclusions, we must be able to estimate the sizes of these 
uncertainties.
 
For example, the specification for a commercial 500-mg acetaminophen (the active 
painkiller in Tylenol) tablet is that each batch of tablets must contain 450 to 550 mg of 
 acetaminophen per tablet. Suppose that chemical analysis gave the following results 
for a batch of acetaminophen tablets: 428 mg, 479 mg, 442 mg, and 435 mg. How can 
we use these results to decide if the batch of tablets meets the specification? Although 
the details of how to draw such conclusions from measured data are beyond the scope 
of this text, we will consider some aspects of how this is done. We will focus here on 
the types of experimental  uncertainty, the expression of experimental results, and a 
simplified method for estimating  experimental uncertainty when several types of mea-
surement contribute to the final result.
Types of Experimental Error
There are two types of experimental uncertainty (error). A variety of names are applied 
to these types of errors:
 
Precision g  random error 
; indeterminate error
 
Accuracy g  systematic error ; determinate error
The difference between the two types of error is well illustrated by the attempts to hit 
a target shown in Fig. 1.8 in Chapter 1.
 
Random error is associated with every measurement. To obtain the last significant 
figure for any measurement, we must always make an estimate. For example, we in-
terpolate between the marks on a meter stick, a buret, or a balance. The precision of 
replicate measurements (repeated measurements of the same type) reflects the size of 
the random errors. Precision refers to the reproducibility of replicate measurements.
 
The accuracy of a measurement refers to how close it is to the true value. An inac-
curate result occurs as a result of some flaw (systematic error) in the measurement: 
the presence of an interfering substance, incorrect calibration of an instrument, opera-
tor error, and so on. The goal of chemical analysis is to eliminate systematic error, but 
random errors can only be minimized. In practice, an experiment is almost always 
done to find an unknown value (the true value is not known‚Äîsomeone is trying to 
obtain that value by doing the experiment). In this case the precision of several repli-
cate determinations is used to assess the accuracy of the result. The results of the 
replicate experiments are expressed as an average (which we assume is close to the 
true value) with an error limit that gives some indication of how close the average 
value may be to the true value. The error limit represents the uncertainty of the experi-
mental result.

Expression of Experimental Results
If we perform several measurements, such as for the analysis for acetaminophen in 
painkiller tablets, the results should express two things: the average of the measure-
ments and the size of the uncertainty.
 
There are two common ways of expressing an average: the mean and the median. 
The mean 1x2  is the arithmetic average of the results, or
Mean 5 x 5 a
n
i51
xi
n 5 x1 1 x2 1 c1 xn
n
where S means take the sum of the values. The mean is equal to the sum of all the 
measurements divided by the number of measurements. For the acetaminophen results 
given previously, the mean is
x 5 428 1 479 1 442 1 435
4
5 446 mg
 
The median is the value that lies in the middle among the results. Half the measure-
ments are above the median and half are below the median. For results of 465 mg, 485 mg, 
and 492 mg, the median is 485 mg. When there is an even number of results, the median 
is the average of the two middle results. For the acetaminophen results, the median is
442 1 435
2
5 438 mg
 
There are several advantages to using the median. If a small number of measure-
ments is made, one value can greatly affect the mean. Consider the results for the 
analysis of acetaminophen: 428 mg, 479 mg, 442 mg, and 435 mg. The mean is 446 mg, 
which is larger than three of the four weights. The median is 438 mg, which lies near 
the three values that are relatively close to one another.
 
In addition to expressing an average value for a series of results, we must express the 
uncertainty. This usually means expressing either the precision of the measurements or 
the observed range of the measurements. The range of a series of measurements is de-
fined by the smallest value and the largest value. For the analytical results on the acet-
aminophen tablets, the range is from 428 mg to 479 mg. Using this range, we can ex-
press the results by saying that the true value lies between 428 mg and 479 mg. That is, 
we can express the amount of acetaminophen in a typical tablet as 446 6 33 mg, where 
the error limit is chosen to give the observed range (approximately).
 
The most common way to specify precision is by the standard deviation, s, which 
for a small number of measurements is given by the formula
s 5 ¬£ a
n
i51
1xi 2 x 2 2
n 2 1
¬ß
1/2
where xi is an individual result, x is the average (either mean or median), and n is the 
total number of measurements. For the acetaminophen example, we have
s 5 c
1428 2 4462 2 1 1479 2 4462 2 1 1442 2 4462 2 1 1435 2 4462 2
4 2 1
d
1/2
5 23
Thus we can say the amount of acetaminophen in the typical tablet in the batch of 
tablets is 446 mg with a sample standard deviation of 23 mg. Statistically this means 
that any additional measurement has a 68% probability (68 chances out of 100) of be-
ing between 423 mg (446 2 23) and 469 mg (446 1 23). Thus the standard deviation 
is a measure of the precision of a given type of determination.
 
The standard deviation gives us a means of describing the precision of a given type 
of determination using a series of replicate results. However, it is also useful to be 
able to  estimate the precision of a procedure that involves several measurements by 
combining the precisions of the individual steps. That is, we want to answer the

following question:  How do the uncertainties propagate when we combine the results 
of several different types of measurements? There are many ways to deal with the 
propagation of uncertainty. We will discuss only one simple method here.
A Simplified Method for Estimating  
Experimental Uncertainty
To illustrate this method, we will consider the determination of the density of an ir-
regularly shaped solid. In this determination we make three measurements. First, we 
measure the mass of the object on a balance. Next, we must obtain the volume of the 
solid. The easiest method for doing this is to partially fill a graduated cylinder with a 
liquid and record the volume. Then we add the solid and record the volume again. The 
difference in the measured volumes is the volume of the solid. We can then calculate 
the density of the solid from the equation
D 5
M
V2 2 V1
where M is the mass of the solid, V1 is the initial volume of liquid in the graduated 
cylinder, and V2 is the volume of liquid plus solid. Suppose we get the following 
results:
 M 5 23.06 g
 V1 5 10.4 mL
 V2 5 13.5 mL
The calculated density is
23.06 g
13.5 mL 2 10.4 mL 5 7.44 g/mL
 
Now suppose that the precision of the balance used is 60.02 g and that the volume 
measurements are precise to 60.05 mL. How do we estimate the uncertainty of the 
density? We can do this by assuming a worst case. That is, we assume the largest un-
certainties in all measurements, and see what combinations of measurements will give 
the largest and smallest possible results (the greatest range). Since the density is the 
mass divided by the volume, the largest value of the density will be that obtained using 
the largest possible mass and the smallest possible volume:
Largest possible mass 5 23.06 1 .02
o
Dmax 5
23.08
13.45 2 10.45 5 7.69 g/mL
 
p

Largest possible V1
The smallest value of the density is

Dmin 5
23.04
13.35 2 10.35 5 7.20 g/mL
 
p 
r
 
Largest possible V2 
Smallest possible V1
Thus the calculated range is from 7.20 to 7.69 and the average of these values is  
7.44. The error limit is the number that gives the high and low range values when 
added and subtracted from the average. Therefore, we can express the density as 
7.44 6 0.25 g/mL, which is the average value plus or minus the quantity that gives the 
range calculated by assuming the largest uncertainties.

Analysis of the propagation of uncertainties is useful in drawing qualitative conclu-
sions from the analysis of measurements. For example, suppose that we obtained the 
preceding results for the density of an unknown alloy and we want to know if it is one 
of the following alloys:
 Alloy A:¬†D 5 7.58 g/mL
 Alloy B:¬†D 5 7.42 g/mL
 Alloy C:¬†D 5 8.56 g/mL
We can safely conclude that the alloy is not C. But the values of the densities for alloys 
A and B are both within the inherent uncertainty of our method. To distinguish be-
tween A and B, we need to improve the precision of our determination: The obvious 
choice is to improve the precision of the volume measurement.
 
The worst-case method is very useful in estimating uncertainties when the results 
of several measurements are combined to calculate a result. We assume the maximum 
uncertainty in each measurement and calculate the minimum and maximum possible 
result. These extreme values describe the range and thus the error limit.

The Quantitative Kinetic Molecular Model
APPENDIX 2
We have seen that the kinetic molecular model successfully accounts for the properties 
of an ideal gas. This appendix will show in some detail how the postulates of the ki-
netic molecular model lead to an equation corresponding to the experimentally ob-
tained ideal gas equation.
 
Recall that the particles of an ideal gas are assumed to be volumeless, to have no 
attraction for each other, and to produce pressure on their container by colliding with 
the container walls.
 
Suppose there are n moles of an ideal gas in a cubical container with sides each of 
length L. Assume each gas particle has a mass m and that it is in rapid, random, straight-
line motion colliding with the walls, as shown in Fig. A.3. The collisions will be as-
sumed to be elastic‚Äîno loss of kinetic energy occurs. We want to compute the force 
on the walls from the colliding gas particles and then, since pressure is force per unit 
area, to obtain an expression for the pressure of the gas.
 
Before we can derive the expression for the pressure of a gas, we must first discuss 
some characteristics of velocity. Each particle in the gas has a particular velocity u that 
can be divided into components ux, uy, and uz, as shown in Fig. A.4. First, using ux and 
uy and the Pythagorean theorem, we can obtain uxy as shown in Fig. A.4(c):

Now let‚Äôs consider how an ‚Äúaverage‚Äù gas particle moves. For example, how often 
does this particle strike the two walls of the box that are perpendicular to the x axis? It 
is important to realize that only the x component of the velocity affects the particle‚Äôs 
impacts on these two walls, as shown in Fig. A.5(a). The larger the x component of the 
velocity, the faster the particle travels between these two walls, and the more impacts 
per unit of time it will make on these walls. Remember, the pressure of the gas is due 
to these collisions with the walls.

The collision frequency (collisions per unit of time) with the two walls that are 
perpendicular to the x axis is given by
 1Collision frequency2 x 5 velocity in the x direction

L
 
Next, what is the force of a collision? Force is defined as mass times acceleration 
(change in velocity per unit of time):
F 5 ma 5 m aDu
Dt b
where F represents force, a represents acceleration, Du represents a change in velocity, 
and Dt represents a given length of time.
 
Since we assume that the particle has constant mass, we can write
F 5 mDu
Dt
5 D1mu2
Dt
The quantity mu is the momentum of the particle (momentum is the product of mass 
and velocity), and the expression F 5 D(mu)/Dt implies that force is the change in 
momentum per unit of time. When a particle hits a wall perpendicular to the x axis, as 
shown in Fig. A.5(b), an elastic collision results in an exact reversal of the x compo-
nent of velocity. That is, the sign, or direction, of ux reverses when the particle collides 
with one of the walls perpendicular to the x axis. Thus the final momentum is the nega-
tive, or opposite, of the initial momentum. Remember that an elastic collision means 
that there is no change in the magnitude of the velocity. The change in momentum in 
the x direction is then

But we are interested in the force the gas particle exerts on the walls of the box. Since 
we know that every action produces an equal but opposite reaction, the change in mo-
mentum with respect to the wall on impact is 2(22mux), or 2mux.
 
Recall that since force is the change in momentum per unit of time,
Forcex 5 D1mux2

for the walls perpendicular to the x axis.

So far we have considered the pressure on the walls due to a single, ‚Äúaverage‚Äù par-

particles in a given gas sample can be expressed as follows:

Next we want to express the pressure in terms of the kinetic energy of the gas mol-
ecules. Kinetic energy (the energy due to motion) is given by 1

This agreement between experiment and theory supports the validity of the assump-

Spectral Analysis
APPENDIX 3
Although volumetric and gravimetric analyses are still very commonly used, spectros-
copy is the technique most often used for modern chemical analysis. Spectroscopy is 
the study of electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by a given chemical spe-
cies. Since the quantity of radiation absorbed or emitted can be related to the quantity 
of the absorbing or emitting species present, this technique can be used for quantitative 
analysis. There are many spectroscopic techniques, as electromagnetic radiation spans 
a wide range of energies to include X rays; ultraviolet, infrared, and visible light; and 
microwaves, to name a few of its familiar forms. We will consider here only one pro-
cedure, which is based on the absorption of visible light.
 
If a liquid is colored, it is because some component of the liquid absorbs visible 
light. In a solution the greater the concentration of the light-absorbing substance, the 
more light absorbed, and the more intense the color of the solution.
 
The quantity of light absorbed by a substance can be measured by a spectrophotom-
eter, shown schematically in Fig. A.6. This instrument consists of a source that emits 
all wavelengths of light in the visible region (wavelengths of ,400 to 700 nm); a 
monochromator, which selects a given wavelength of light; a sample holder for the 
solution being measured; and a detector, which compares the intensity of incident light 
I0 to the intensity of light after it has passed through the sample I. The ratio IyI0, called 
the transmittance, is a measure of the fraction of light that passes through the sample. 
The amount of light absorbed is given by the absorbance A, where
A 5 2log I
I0
The absorbance can be expressed by the Beer‚ÄìLambert law:
A 5 Plc
where P is the molar absorptivity or the molar extinction coefficient (in L/mol ? cm), 
l is the distance the light travels through the solution (in cm), and c is the concentration 
of the absorbing species (in mol/L). The Beer‚ÄìLambert law is the basis for using spec-
troscopy in quantitative analysis. If P and l are known, measuring A for a solution al-
lows us to calculate the concentration of the absorbing species in the solution.
 
Suppose we have a pink solution containing an unknown concentration of Co2(aq) 
ions. A sample of this solution is placed in a spectrophotometer, and the absorbance is 
measured at a wavelength where P for Co21(aq) is known to be 12 L/mol ? cm. The 
absorbance A is found to be 0.60. The width of the sample tube is 1.0 cm. We want to 
determine the concentration of Co21(aq) in the solution. This problem can be solved 
by a straightforward application of the Beer‚ÄìLambert law,

to the intensity of the light after it has passed through the sample (l).

To obtain the unknown concentration of an absorbing species from the measured

However, a more accurate value of the product Pl can be obtained by plotting A versus 
c for a series of solutions. Note that the equation A 5 Plc gives a straight line with 
slope Pl when A is plotted against c.
 
For example, consider the following typical spectroscopic analysis. A sample of 
steel from a bicycle frame is to be analyzed to determine its manganese content. The 
procedure involves weighing out a sample of the steel, dissolving it in strong acid, 
treating the resulting solution with a very strong oxidizing agent to convert all the 
manganese to permanganate ion (MnO42), and then using spectroscopy to determine 
the concentration of the intensely purple MnO42 ions in the solution. To do this, how-
ever, the value of Pl for MnO42 must be determined at an appropriate wavelength. The 
absorbance values for four solutions with known MnO42 concentrations were mea-
sured to give the following data:

A plot of absorbance versus concentration for the solutions of known concentration is 
shown in Fig. A.7. The slope of this line (change in Aychange in c) is 2.48 3 103 L/mol. 
This quantity represents the product Pl.
 
A sample of the steel weighing 0.1523 g was dissolved and the unknown amount 
of manganese was converted to MnO42 ions. Water was then added to give a solution 
with a final volume of 100.0 mL. A portion of this solution was placed in a spectro-
photometer, and its absorbance was found to be 0.780. Using these data, we want to 
calculate the percent manganese in the steel. The MnO42 ions from the manganese in

the dissolved steel sample show an absorbance of 0.780. Using the Beer‚ÄìLambert law, 
we calculate the concentration of MnO42 in this solution:
c 5 A
Pl 5
0.780
2.48 3 103 L/mol 3 3.15 3 1024 mol/L
 
There is a more direct way for finding c. Using a graph such as that in Fig. A.7 
(often called a Beer‚Äôs law plot), we can read the concentration that corresponds to  
A 5 0.780. This interpolation is shown by dashed lines on the graph. By this method, 
c 5  3.15 3 1024 mol/L, which agrees with the value obtained above.
 
Recall that the original 0.1523-g steel sample was dissolved, the manganese was 
converted to permanganate, and the volume was adjusted to 100.0 mL. We now know 
that [MnO4] in that solution is 3.15 3 1024 M. Using this concentration, we can calcu-
late the total number of moles of MnO42 in that solution:
 mol M nO4
2 5 100.0 mL 3
1 L
1000 mL 3 3.15 3 1024 mol
L
 5 3.15 3 1025 mol
Since each mole of manganese in the original steel sample yields a mole of MnO4, 
that is,
1 mol Mn
Oxidation
88888888n 1 mol MnO42
the original steel sample must have contained 3.15 3 1025 mole of manganese. The 
mass of manganese present in the sample is
3.15 3 1025 mol Mn 3 54.938 g of Mn
1 mol Mn
5 1.73 3 1023 g of Mn
Since the steel sample weighed 0.1523 g, the present manganese in the steel is
1.73 3 1023 g of Mn
1.523 3 1021 g of sample 3 100 5 1.14%
 
This example illustrates a typical use of spectroscopy in quantitative analysis. The 
steps commonly involved are as follows:
1. Preparation of a calibration plot (a Beer‚Äôs law plot) by measuring the absorbance 
values of a series of solutions with known concentrations
2. Measurement of the absorbance of the solution of unknown concentration
3. Use of the calibration plot to determine the unknown concentration

Molecular Spectroscopy: An Introduction
APPENDIX 7
Spectroscopy can be defined as the study of the interaction of electromagnetic radia-
tion with matter. Spectroscopy provides a nondestructive and highly sensitive method 
for obtaining information about the identity, structure, and properties of substances. 
We have already discussed the emission spectrum of the hydrogen atom in Chapter 7 
and the importance of the information it provides about hydrogen‚Äôs quantized energy 
levels. Spectroscopy is also very useful for the study of molecules. Molecules can ab-
sorb electromagnetic radiation to furnish energy for many different processes, all 
which have quantized energy levels.
 
For example, a molecule can absorb or emit a photon and go from a lower electronic 
energy state to a higher electronic energy state or vice versa. This ‚Äúelectronic transi-
tion‚Äù can be described approximately as a change from one electronic arrangement to 
another. Typically, electronic transitions require photons in the ultraviolet (UV) or vis-
ible regions of the spectrum. One example of the use of this type of spectroscopy is 
illustrated by photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) discussed in Sections 7.12 and 9.3.
 
Molecules can also undergo vibrational energy transitions. For example, the atoms 
in a molecule vibrate around their equilibrium positions, giving rise to quantized vi-
brational energy levels. These spacings correspond to the energies of photons in the 
infrared (IR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum. 
 
In addition, molecules can rotate, and the spacings of quantized rotational energy 
levels correspond to the energies of photons in the microwave region. In fact, it is the 
rotational excitation of the water molecules in food and the transfer of this energy to 
other molecules that form the basis of microwave cooking.
 
We will consider electronic spectroscopy and vibrational spectroscopy in more detail.
Electronic Spectroscopy
The electronic spectrum of a molecule, which typically occurs in the ultraviolet (UV) 
or visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, provides information about the 
spacings of electronic energy levels in the molecule. This allows us to better determine 
the electronic structure of a molecule. The electronic spectrum plots the quantity of 
radiation absorbed versus the wavelength of the radiation, showing peaks (maxima) at 
wavelengths where the photons have an energy that matches an energy gap in the 
molecule.
 
The majority of electronic transitions in molecules occurs in the UV region of the 
spectrum because the energy separations of electron states typically correspond to the 
energies of the photons in the UV region. However, some molecules have electronic 
energy separations that correspond to radiation in the visible region. One such class of 
compounds includes the coordination compounds that contain transitional metal ions. 
Thus, for example, dissolving copper(II) sulfate ions in water gives rise to a character-
istic blue solution. Coordination compounds are discussed in Chapter 21. Another 
class of compounds that absorbs in the visible region of the spectrum involves mole-
cules with long chains of carbon molecules that have alternating double bonds, such as 
carotene. The molecular structure of beta-carotene is given in Fig. A.8.
 
Substances with alternating double bonds are called conjugated molecules. It turns 
out that as the conjugated system gets longer, the electronic energies get closer to-
gether and the light absorbed corresponds to longer wavelengths.
 
White light consists of all of the colors of the rainbow (see Fig. 7.7), so when par-
ticular colors are absorbed by a given molecule, the substance appears colored. The 
color that results is the one given by the ‚Äúsum‚Äù of the colors that remain unabsorbed. 
For example, carotene absorbs visible light in the violet and blue regions. It appears 
orange in color because the colors not absorbed ‚Äúadd up‚Äù to produce orange. In fact, 
carotene is the substance that gives carrots their bright orange color. The electronic 
absorption spectrum of beta-carotene is shown in Fig. A.9.

Electronic spectroscopy also provides a sensitive and accurate method for deter-
mining the amount of absorbing species present in a sample (quantitative analysis). 
This technique is described in Appendix 3.
Vibrational Spectroscopy
As we have seen, a molecule can be approximated as a collection of atoms held to-
gether by bonds. In describing the vibrations in a molecule, we can compare the bond 
between a given pair of atoms to a spring attached to two masses. As the atoms move 
apart in a vibrational motion, the bond‚Äîlike a spring‚Äîprovides a restoring force that 
pulls the atoms back toward each other. Vibrational transitions in molecules usually 
require energies that correspond to the IR region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The 
data are often represented in ‚Äúwave numbers‚Äù; a wave number is the reciprocal of the 
wavelength (in centimeters) required to cause the vibrational transition.
 
A particular bonded pair of atoms has a characteristic vibrational frequency (wave 
number) that is relatively insensitive to its molecular environment. Thus, a signal that 
appears in the IR spectrum at that characteristic frequency provides good evidence that 
this particular atom pair is present in the molecule. For example, a COH pair in a 
molecule will always show a vibrational signal at about 3000 cm21 (the range of wave 
numbers is actually 2850‚Äì3300 cm21 depending on the specific molecular environ-
ment). On the other hand, the OOH group in a molecule will show a vibrational bond 
at about 3600 cm21. Typical frequency ranges for the stretching motions of several 
common bonds are given in the table below.

It turns out that several characteristic vibrational motions, called normal modes, are 
possible, not simply stretching motions. As an example, the normal modes of vibration 
for the SO2 molecule are shown in Fig. A.10.
 
The IR spectrum of a molecule can be a great aid in identifying which atom group-
ings (that is, the types of bonds) are present in a molecule and thus can provide valu-
able information for identifying a specific molecule. 
 
For example, consider methanol (CH3OH), which has the following structure:
 
The IR spectrum of methanol is:

Notice that we can identify the bond present due to the stretching motions. The 
spectrum has other peaks due to different modes of vibration (such as those we saw 
with the SO2 molecule) and hydrogen bonding between the molecules.

lowing two measured quantities, 999,999 62 and 999,996 62. The differ-
ence is 3 6 4. Because of the larger uncertainty, subtracting two similar

The answers listed here are from the Complete Solutions Guide, in which 
rounding is carried out at each intermediate step in a calculation in order to 
show the correct number of significant figures for that step. Therefore, an 
answer given here may differ in the last digit from the result obtained by car-

Chapter 1
19.¬†A law summarizes what happens, e.g., law of conservation of mass in a 
chemical reaction or the ideal gas law, PV 5 nRT. A theory (model) is an 
attempt to explain why something happens. Dalton‚Äôs atomic theory explains 
why mass is conserved in a chemical reaction. The kinetic molecular theory 
explains why pressure and volume are inversely related at constant tempera-
ture and moles of gas.   21.¬†The fundamental steps are (1) making observa-
tions; (2) formulating hypotheses; (3) performing experiments to test the 
hypotheses. The key to the scientific method is performing experiments to 
test hypotheses. If after the test of time, the hypotheses seem to account sat-
isfactorily for some aspect of natural behavior, then the set of tested hypoth-
eses turns into a theory (model). However, scientists continue to perform 
experiments to refine or replace existing theories.   23.¬†A qualitative obser-
vation expresses what makes something what it is; it does not involve a num-
ber; e.g., the air we breathe is a mixture of gases, ice is less dense than water, 
rotten milk stinks. The SI units are mass in grams, length in meters, and 
volume in the derived units of m3. The assumed uncertainty in a number is 
61 in the last significant figure of the number. The precision of an instru-
ment is related to the number of significant figures associated with an ex-
perimental reading on that instrument. Different instruments for measuring 
mass, length, or volume have varying degrees of precision. Some instru-
ments only give a few significant figures for a measurement while others will 
give more significant figures.   25.¬†Significant figures are the digits we as-
sociate with a number. They contain all of the certain digits and the first un-
certain digit (the first estimated digit). What follows is one thousand indi-
cated to varying numbers of significant figures: 1000 or 1 3 103 (1 S.F.);  
1.0 3 103 (2 S.F.); 1.00 3 103 (3 S.F.); 1000. or 1.000 3 103 (4 S.F.). To 
perform the calculation, the addition/subtraction significant rule is applied to 
1.5 2 1.0. The result of this is the one significant figure answer of 0.5. Next, 
the multiplication/division rule is applied to 0.5/0.50. A one significant num-
ber divided by a two significant number yields an answer with one significant 
figure (answer 5 1).   27.¬†The slope of the TF vs. TC plot is 1.8 (5 9/5) and 
the y-intercept is 328F. The slope of TC vs. TK plot is 1 and the y-intercept 
is 22738C.  29. The density of a gas is much smaller than the density of a

19.¬†A compound will always contain the same numbers (and types) of atoms. 
A given amount of hydrogen will react only with a specific amount of oxy-
gen. Any excess oxygen will remain unreacted.   21.¬†Law of conservation of 
mass: mass is neither created nor destroyed. The mass before a chemical re-
action always equals the mass after a chemical reaction. Law of definite pro-
portion: a given compound always contains exactly the same proportion of 
elements by mass. Water is always 1¬†g H for every 8¬†g oxygen. Law of mul-
tiple proportions: When two elements form a series of compounds, the ratios 
of the mass of the second element that combine with one gram of the first 
element can always be reduced to small whole numbers. For CO2 and CO 
discussed in Section 2.2, the mass ratios of oxygen that react with 1¬†g of 
carbon in each compound are in a 2:1 ratio.   23.¬†J. J. Thomson‚Äôs study of 
cathode-ray tubes led him to postulate the existence of negatively charged 
particles, which we now call electrons. Ernest Rutherford and his alpha bom-
bardment of metal foil experiments led him to postulate the nuclear atom‚Äî
an atom with a tiny dense center of positive charge (the nucleus) with elec-
trons moving about the nucleus at relatively large distances away; the 
distance is so large that an atom is mostly empty space.   25.¬†The number 
and arrangement of electrons in an atom determines how the atom will react 
with other atoms. The electrons determine the chemical properties of an 
atom. The number of neutrons present determine the isotope identity and the 
mass number.   27.¬†2; the ratio increases   29.¬†Metallic character increases 
as one goes down a family and decreases from left to right across the periodic 
table.   31.¬†In the paste, sodium chloride will dissolve to form separate Na1 
and Cl2 ions. With the ions present and able to move about, electrical im-
pulses will be conducted.    33.¬†a.¬†This represents ionic bonding, which is 
the electrostatic attraction between anions and cations. b.¬†This represents 
covalent bonding, where electrons are shared between two atoms. This could 
be the space-filling model for H2O or SF2 or NO2, etc.   35.¬†Statements a and 
b are true. Element 118 is a noble gas and will be a nonmetal. For statement 
c, hydrogen has mostly nonmetallic properties. For statement d, a family of 
elements is also known as a group of elements. For statement e, two items 
are incorrect. When a metal reacts with a nonmetal, an ionic compound is 
produced and the formula of the compound would be AX2 (since alkaline 
earth metals for 12 ions and halogens form 21 ions in ionic compounds). 
The correct statement would be: When alkaline earth metal, A, reacts with 
a halogen, X, the formula of the ionic compound formed should be AX2. 
37.¬†a. The composition of a substance depends on the number of atoms  
of each element making up the compound (depends on the formula of  
the compound) and not on the composition of the mixture from which  
it was formed. b.¬† Avogadro‚Äôs hypothesis implies that volume ratios  
are equal to molecule ratios at constant temperature and pressure. 
H21g2 1 Cl21g2  n 2HCl1g2 ; from the balanced equation, the volume of 
HCl¬†produced will be twice the volume of H2 (or Cl2) reacted.   39.¬†299¬†g 
41.¬†The ratio of the masses of carbon that combine with 1¬†g of oxygen is 
0.751
0.375 5 2
1 . Note that this supports the law of multiple proportions because 
this carbon ratio is a small whole number.   43.¬†For CO and CO2, it is easiest 
to concentrate on the mass of oxygen that combines with 1¬†g of carbon. From 
the formulas (two oxygen atoms per carbon atom in CO2 vs. one oxygen 
atom per carbon atom in CO), CO2 will have twice the mass of oxygen that 
combines per gram of carbon as compared to CO. For CO2 and C3O2, it is 
easiest to concentrate on the mass of carbon that combines with 1¬†g of oxy-
gen. From the formulas (three carbon atoms per two oxygen atoms in C3O2 
vs. one carbon atom per two oxygen atoms in CO2), C3O2 will have three 
times the mass of carbon that combines per gram of oxygen as compared to 
CO2. As expected, the mass ratios are whole numbers as predicted by the law 
of multiple proportions.   45.¬†Mass is conserved in a chemical reaction be-
cause atoms are conserved. Chemical reactions involve the reorganization of 
atoms, so formulas change in a chemical reaction, but the number and types 
of atoms do not change. Because the atoms do not change in a chemical reac-

17. a.¬† Polarity is a term applied to covalent compounds. Polar covalent 
 compounds have an unequal sharing of electrons in bonds that results in an 
unequal charge distribution in the overall molecule. Polar molecules have a 
partial negative end and a partial positive end. These are not full charges as 
in ionic compounds, but are charges much less in magnitude. Water is a polar 
molecule and dissolves other polar solutes readily. The oxygen end of water 
(the partial negative end of the polar water molecule) aligns with the partial 
positive end of the polar solute while the hydrogens of water (the partial 
positive end of the polar water molecule) align with the partial negative end 
of the solute. These opposite charged attractions stabilize polar solutes in 
water. This process is called hydration. Nonpolar solutes do not have perma-
nent partial negative and partial positive ends; nonpolar solutes are not stabi-
lized in water and do not dissolve. b.¬†KF is a soluble ionic compound so it is 
a strong electrolyte. KF(aq) actually exists as separate hydrated K1 ions and 
hydrated F2 ions in solution: C6H12O6 is a polar covalent molecule that is a 
nonelectrolyte. C6H12O6 is hydrated as described in part a.¬†c. RbCl is a solu-
ble ionic compound so it exists as separate hydrated Rb1 ions and hydrated 
Cl2 ions in solution. AgCl is an insoluble ionic compound so the ions stay

25. The atomic mass of any particular isotope is a relative mass to a specific 
standard. The standard is one atom of the carbon-12 isotope weighing exactly 
12.0000 u. One can determine from experiment how much heavier or lighter 
any specific isotope is than 12C. From this information, we assign an atomic 
mass value to that isotope. For example, experiment tells one that 16O is about 
4/3 heavier than 12C, so a mass of 4/3(12.00) 5 16.00¬†u is assigned to 16O. The 
atomic mass listed in the periodic table is also an average mass. Most elements 
in nature occur as a mixture of isotopes. The atomic mass of an element is the 
average mass of all the isotopes that make up a specific element, weighted by 
abundance.   27.¬†Each person would have 90 trillion dollars.   29.¬†Only in b 
are the empirical formulas the same for both compounds illustrated. In b, gen-
eral formulas of X2Y4 and XY2 are illustrated, and both have XY2 for an em-
pirical formula.   31.¬†The mass percent of a compound is a constant no matter 
what amount of substance is present. Compounds always have constant com-
position.   33.¬†c   35.¬†The theoretical yield is the stoichiometric amount of 
product that should form if the limiting reactant is completely consumed and 
the reaction has 100% yield.   37.¬†The information needed is mostly the coef-
ficients in the balanced equation and the molar masses of the reactants and 
products. For percent yield, we would need the actual yield of the reaction and 
the amounts of reactants used.

d. HNO3 is a strong acid and exists as separate hydrated H1 ions and hy-

solution can also contain a nonelectrolyte dissolved in water, e.g., concen-
trated sugar water. Acids are either strong or weak electrolytes. Some ionic 
compounds are not soluble in water, so they are not labeled as a specific type 
of electrolyte.   21.¬†Bromides: NaBr, KBr, and NH4Br (and others) would be

K2SO4, and (NH4)2SO4 (and others) would be soluble and BaSO4, CaSO4, 
and PbSO4 (or Hg2SO4) would be insoluble. Hydroxides: NaOH, KOH, and 
Ca(OH)2 (and others) would be soluble and Al(OH)3, Fe(OH)3, and Cu(OH)2 
(and others) would be insoluble. Phosphates: Na3PO4, K3PO4, and (NH4)3PO4

23. The Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry definitions are best for our purposes. An acid is a 
proton donor and a base is a proton acceptor. A proton is an H1 ion. Neutral 
hydrogen has 1 electron and 1 proton, so an H1 ion is just a proton. An acid‚Äì
base reaction is the transfer of an H1 ion (a proton) from an acid to a base.  
25. a.¬†The species reduced is the element that gains electrons. The reducing 
agent causes reduction to occur by itself being oxidized. The reducing agent 
is generally listed as the entire formula of the compound/ion that contains the 
element oxidized. b.¬†The species oxidized is the element that loses electrons. 
The oxidizing agent causes oxidation to occur by itself being reduced. The 
oxidizing agent is generally listed as the entire formula of the compound/ion 
that contains the element reduced. c.¬†For simple binary ionic compounds, the 
actual charges on the ions are the oxidation states. For covalent compounds, 
nonzero oxidation states are imaginary charges the elements would have if 
they were held together by ionic bonds (assuming the bond is between two 
different nonmetals). Nonzero oxidation states for elements in covalent com-
pounds are not actual charges. Oxidation states for covalent compounds are 
a bookkeeping method to keep track of electrons in a reaction.

stant, so at constant moles of gas, either a temperature change or a pressure 
change results in the smaller volume. If the temperature is constant, an in-
crease in the external pressure would cause the volume to decrease. Gases are 
mostly empty space, so gases are easily compressible. If the pressure is con-
stant, a decrease in temperature would cause the volume to decrease. As the 
temperature is lowered, the gas particles move with a slower average velocity 
and don‚Äôt collide with the container walls as frequently and as forcefully. As 
a result, the internal pressure decreases. In order to keep the pressure constant, 
the volume of the container must decrease in order to increase the gas particle 
collisions per unit area.

standing on the surface of the liquid is equal to the pressure exerted by air on 
the rest of the surface of the liquid, then the height of the column of liquid  
is a measure of atmospheric pressure. Because water is 13.6 times less  
dense than mercury, the column of water must be 13.6 times longer than  
that of mercury to match the force exerted by the columns of liquid standing 
on the surface. 25. The P versus 1yV plot is incorrect. The plot should be

The volume of 1.000 mole of any gas is 22.42 L, assuming the gas behaves 
ideally. Therefore, the molar volume of He(g) and N2(g) at STP both equal 
22.42 L/mol. If the temperature increases to 25.0¬∞C (298.2 K), the molar 
volume of a gas will be larger than 22.42 L/mol because volume and tem-
perature are directly related at constant pressure. If 1.000 mole of a gas is 
collected over water at a total pressure of 1.000 atm, the partial pressure of 
the collected gas will be less than 1.000 atm because water vapor is present 
(Ptotal 5 Pgas 1  PH2O). At some partial pressure below 1.000 atm, the molar 
volume of a gas will be larger than 22.42 L/mol because volume and pressure 
are inversely related at constant temperature.  31.¬†  a.¬† As temperature in-

V and T, P is directly proportional to the moles of gas present. As the moles 
of gas double, the pressure will double. The partial pressure of N2 will be 1y2 
the initial pressure of NH3 and the partial pressure of H2 will be 3/2 the initial

the equations, wavelength and frequency are inversely related, photon energy 
and frequency are directly related, and photon energy and wavelength are in-
versely related. The unit of 1 joule (J) 5 1 kg m2/s2. This is why you must 
change mass units to kg when using the de Broglie equation.   25.¬†The photo-
electric effect refers to the phenomenon in which electrons are emitted from 
the surface of a metal when light strikes it. The light must have a certain mini-
mum frequency (energy) in order to remove electrons from the surface of a 
metal. Light having a frequency below the minimum results in no electrons 
being emitted, whereas light at or higher than the minimum frequency does 
cause electrons to be emitted. For light having a frequency higher than the 
minimum frequency, the excess energy is transferred into kinetic energy for the

to  Denver or one could fly from Chicago to Atlanta to Los Angeles and then

tion of the airplane, time traveling, airplane snacks eaten, etc. State functions 
are path-independent; they only depend on the initial and final states. Some 
state functions for an airplane trip from Chicago to Denver would be longi-

ide is a poisonous gas to humans.   29.¬†150¬†J   31.¬†a.¬†Potential energy is 
energy due to position. Initially, ball A has a higher potential energy than ball 
B because the position of ball A is higher than that of ball B. In the final 
position, ball B has the higher position, so ball B has the higher potential 
energy. b.¬†As ball A rolled down the hill, some of the potential energy lost by 
A was converted to random motion of the components of the hill (frictional 
heating). The remainder of the lost potential energy was added to B to ini-
tially increase its kinetic energy and then to increase its potential energy.

There are extra electron‚Äìelectron repulsions in Se because two electrons are 
in the same 4p orbital, resulting in a lower ionization energy than expected. 
121.¬†a.¬†As we remove succeeding electrons, the electron being removed is 
closer to the nucleus, and there are fewer electrons left repelling it. The re-
maining electrons are more strongly attracted to the nucleus, and it takes 
more energy to remove these electrons. b.¬†Al: 1s22s22p63s23p1. For I4, we 
begin removing an electron with n 5 2. For I3, we remove an electron with 
n¬†5 3 (the last valence electron). In going from n 5 3 to n 5 2, there is a  
big jump in ionization energy because the n 5 2 electrons are closer to 
the nucleus on average than the n 5 3 electrons. Since the n 5 2 electrons 
are closer, on average, to the nucleus, they are held more tightly and require 
a much larger amount of energy to remove compared to the n 5 3 electrons.

trons.   123.¬†a.¬†C, Br; b.¬†N, Ar; c.¬†C, Br   125. Al (244), Si (2120), P¬†(274),

emitted electron. Albert Einstein explained the photoelectric effect by applying 
quantum theory.   27.¬†Example 7.3 calculates the de Broglie wavelength of a 
ball and of an electron. The ball has a wave length on the order of 10234 m.¬†This 
is incredibly short and, as far as the wave-particle duality is concerned, the 
wave properties of large objects are insignificant. The electron, with its tiny 
mass, also has a short wavelength: on the order of 10210 m.¬†However, this 
wavelength is significant as it is on the same order as the spacing between at-
oms in a  typical crystal. For very tiny objects like electrons, the wave proper-
ties are important. The wave properties must be considered, along with the 
particle properties, when hypothesizing about the electron motion in an atom. 
29. The Bohr model was an important step in the development of the current 
quantum mechanical model of the atom. The idea that electrons can occupy 
only certain, allowed energy levels is illustrated nicely (and relatively easily). 
We talk about the Bohr model to present the idea of quantized energy levels.    
31. When the p and d orbital functions are evaluated at various points in space, 
the results sometimes have positive values and sometimes have negative val-
ues. The term phase is often associated with the 1 and 2 signs. For example, 
a sine wave has alternating positive and negative phases. This is analogous to 
the positive and negative values (phases) in the p and d orbitals.   33.¬†a.¬†m‚Ñì; 
b.¬†n; c.¬†ms; d.¬†‚Ñì   35.¬†If one more electron is added to a half-filled subshell, 
electron‚Äìelectron repulsions will increase because two electrons must now oc-
cupy the same atomic orbital. This may slightly decrease the stability of the 
atom.   37.¬†The valence electrons are strongly attracted to the nucleus for ele-
ments with large ionization energies. One would expect these species to read-
ily accept another electron and have very exothermic electron affinities. The 
noble gases are an exception; they have a large ionization energy but an endo-
thermic electron affinity. Noble gases have a filled valence shell. The added 
electron must go into a higher n¬†value atomic orbital, which would have a sig-
nificantly higher energy. This is unfavorable.   39.¬†For hydrogen and hydrogen-
like (one electron) ions, all orbitals with the same value of n have the same 
energy. For  polyatomic atoms/ions, the energy of the orbitals also depends 
on¬†,. Because there are more nondegenerate energy levels for polyatomic atoms/
ions as compared with hydrogen, there are many more possible electronic tran-
sitions resulting in more complicated line spectra.   41.¬†Yes, the maximum 
number of unpaired electrons in any configuration corresponds to a minimum 
in electron‚Äìelectron repulsions.   43.¬†a.¬† n; b.¬† n¬† and¬† ‚Ñì   45.¬†4.5¬† 3¬† 1014¬† s‚Äì1

19.¬†a. This diagram represents a polar covalent bond as in HCl. In a polar 
covalent bond, there is an electron-rich region (indicated by the red color) and 
an electron-poor region (indicated by the blue color). In HCl, the more elec-
tronegative Cl atom has a slightly greater ability to attract the bonding elec-
trons, which in turn produces a dipole moment. b.¬†This diagram represents an 
ionic bond as in NaCl. Here, the electronegativity differences between the Na 
and Cl are so great that the valence electron of sodium is transferred to the 
chlorine atom. This results in the formation of a cation, an anion, and an ionic 
bond. c.¬†This diagram represents a pure covalent bond as in H2. Both atoms 
attract the bonding electrons equally, so there is no bond dipole formed. This 
is illustrated in the electrostatic potential diagram as there is no one region 
that is red nor one region that is blue (there is no specific partial negative end 
and no specific partial positive end).   21.¬†(NH4)2SO4 and Ca3(PO4)2 are com-
pounds with both ionic and covalent bonds.   23.¬†Electronegativity increases 
left to right across the periodic table and decreases from top to bottom. 
Hydrogen has an electronegativity value between B and C in the second row, 
and identical to P in the third row. Going further down the periodic table, 
H¬†has an electronegativity value between As and Se (row 4) and identical to 
Te (row 5). It is important to know where hydrogen fits into the electronega-
tivity trend, especially for rows 2 and 3. If you know where H fits into the 
trend, then you can predict bond dipole directions for nonmetals bonded to 
hydrogen.   25.¬†For ions, concentrate on the number of protons and the number 
of electrons present. The species whose nucleus holds the electrons most tightly 
will be smallest. For example, compare the size of an anion to the neutral atom. 
The anion has more electrons held by the same number of protons in the 
nucleus. These electrons will not be held as tightly, resulting in a bigger size for 
the anion as compared to the neutral atom. For isoelectronic ions, the same 
number of electrons are held by different numbers of protons in the various ions. 
The ion with the most  protons holds the electrons tightest and has smallest size.   
27.¬†Fossil fuels contain a lot of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Combustion of 
fossil fuels (reaction with O2) produces CO2 and H2O. Both these compounds 
have very strong bonds. Because much stronger product bonds are formed than 
reactant bonds broken, combustion reactions are very exothermic.

Electronegativity predicts the opposite polarization with the partial negative 
end of the molecule around the more electronegative oxygen atom. The two 
opposing effects seem to partially cancel to give a much less polar molecule 
than expected.

The additional electron in P2 will have to go into an orbital that already has 
one electron. There will be greater repulsions between the paired electrons in

electron repulsions are much greater in O2 than in S2 because the electron

spectrum. The peak at the lowest binding energy corresponds to the peak 
with the easiest electrons to remove. This will be the 2p electrons. The peak 
at the highest energy corresponds to the 1s orbital electrons since they will 
have the largest binding energy. The area under each peak is directly related 
to the number of electrons in each orbital. Since all orbitals in carbon have 
two electrons, each peak area will be equal. This is shown on the PES spec-
trum for carbon: three peaks with equal area.   135.¬† potassium peroxide,

about the same. However, the ratios for Na, Al, and S are higher. For Na, the 
second IE is extremely high because the electron is taken from n 5 2 (the first 
electron is taken from n 5 3). For Al, the first electron requires a bit less energy 
than expected by the trend due to the fact it is a 3p electron. For S, the first 
electron requires a bit less energy than expected by the trend due to  electrons 
being paired in one of the p orbitals.   185.¬†a.¬†Zeff 5 43.33; b.¬†Silver is element

most electronegative element there is, fluorine, and a negative formal charge 
on a much less electronegative element, boron. This is just the opposite of what 
we expect: negative formal charge on F and positive formal charge on B. The

Note: OH, CH, H2C, CH2, and CH3 are short-hand notation. In this notation, 
single bonds to the various H atoms are assumed. Most of the bond angles in 
the molecule are predicted to be 109.5 degrees because most of the carbon 
atoms exhibit tetrahedral geometry. The exceptions are the two carbons with 
the *. These two carbons exhibit trigonal planar geometry and are predicted 
to have 120-degree bond angles. Because most of the carbon atoms exhibit

11. In hybrid orbital theory, some or all of the valence atomic orbitals of the 
central atom in a molecule are mixed together to form hybrid orbitals; these 
hybrid orbitals point to where the bonded atoms and lone pairs are oriented. 
The s bonds are formed from the hybrid orbitals overlapping head to head 
with an appropriate orbital on the bonded atom. The p bonds in hybrid orbital 
theory are formed from unhybridized p atomic orbitals. The p orbitals overlap 
side to side to form the p bond where the p electrons occupy the space above 
and below a line joining the atoms p the internuclear axis). Assuming the 
z-axis is the internuclear axis, then the pz atomic orbital will always be hybrid-
ized whether the hybridization is sp, sp2, sp3, dsp3 or d2sp3. For sp hybridiza-
tion, the px and py atomic orbitals are unhybridized; they are used to form two 
p bonds to the bonded atom(s). For sp2 hybridization, either the px or py 
atomic orbital is hybridized (along with the s and pz orbitals); the other p or-
bital is used to form a p bond to a bonded atom. For sp3 hybridization, the  
s and all of the p orbitals are hybridized; no unhybridized p atomic orbitals are 
present, so typical p bonds do not form with sp3 hybridization. For dsp3 and 
d2sp3  hybridization, we just mix in one or two d orbitals into the hybridization 
process. Which specific d orbitals are used is not important to our discussion. 
13.¬†We use d orbitals when we have to; i.e., we use d orbitals when the central 
atom on a molecule has more than eight electrons around it. The d orbitals are 
necessary to accommodate the electrons over eight. Row 2 elements never 
have more than eight electrons around them so they never hybridize d orbitals. 
We rationalize this by saying there are no d orbitals close in energy to the 
valence 2s and 2p orbitals (2d orbitals are forbidden energy levels). However, 
for row 3 and heavier elements, there are 3d, 4d, 5d, etc. orbitals that will be 
close in energy to the valence s and p orbitals. It is row 3 and heavier nonmet-
als that hybridize d orbitals when they have to. For sulfur, the valence elec-
trons are in 3s and 3p orbitals. Therefore, 3d orbitals are closest in energy and 
are available for hybridization. Arsenic would hybridize 4d orbitals to go with 
the  valence 4s and 4p orbitals while iodine would hybridize 5d orbitals since 
the valence electrons are in n 5 5.

The darker green orbitals about carbon are sp hybrid orbitals. The lighter 
green orbitals about each oxygen are sp2 hybrid orbitals, and the gold orbit-
als about all of the atoms are unhybridized p atomic orbitals. In each double 
bond in CO2, one s and one p bond exists. The two carbon‚Äîoxygen s 
bonds are formed from overlap of sp hybrid orbitals from carbon with a sp2 
hybrid orbital from each oxygen. The two carbon‚Äîoxygen p¬†bonds are 
formed from side-to-side overlap of the unhybridized p atomic orbitals from  
carbon with an unhybridized p atomic orbital from each oxygen. These two 
p¬†bonds are oriented perpendicular to each other as illustrated in the figure. 
17. Bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals are both solutions to the 
quantum mechanical treatment of the molecule. Bonding orbitals form when 
in-phase orbitals combine to give constructive interference. This results in 
enhanced electron probability located between the two nuclei. The end result 
is that a bonding MO is lower in energy than the atomic orbitals of which it 
is composed. Antibonding orbitals form when out-of-phase orbitals com-
bine. The mismatched phases produce destructive  interference leading 
to a node in the electron probability between the two  nuclei. With electron 
distribution pushed to the outside, the energy of an  antibonding orbital is 
higher than the energy of the atomic orbitals of which it is composed.  
19.¬†The localized electron model does not deal effectively with molecules con-
taining unpaired electrons. We can draw all of the possible resonance structures 
for NO, but still not have a good feel for whether the bond in NO is weaker or 
stronger than the bond in NO2. MO theory can handle odd electron species 
without any modifications. In addition, hybrid orbital theory does not predict 
that NO2 is paramagnetic. The MO theory correctly makes this prediction.
cesses (removing 2 electrons from Mg, and so on). The bond energy for O2 
(247 kJ/mol) and electron affinity (737 kJ/mol) are the same when making 
CO. However, the energy needed to ionize carbon to form a C21 ion must be 
too large. Figure 7.32 shows that the first ionization energy for carbon is 
about 350 kJ/mol greater than the first IE for magnesium. If all other num-
bers were equal, the overall energy change would be 250 kJ/mol (see Fig. 
8.11). It is not unreasonable to assume that the second ionization energy for 
carbon is more than 250 kJ/mol greater than the second ionization energy for 
magnesium. This would result in a positive DH value for the formation of CO 
as an ionic compound. One wouldn‚Äôt expect CO to be ionic if the energetics 
were unfavorable.   161.¬†As the halogen atoms get larger, it becomes more 
difficult to fit three halogen atoms around the small nitrogen atom, and the 
NX3 molecule becomes less stable.   163.¬†reaction i: 22636 kJ; reaction ii:

We would expect 1208 bond angles about the carbon atom labeled 1 and

angles should be slightly smaller than 109.58 due to the lone pair of electrons

Localized electron model: The central oxygen atom is sp2 hybridized, which 
is used to form the two s bonds and hold the lone pair of electrons. An un-
changed (unhybridized) p atomic orbital forms the p bond with the neigh-
boring oxygen atoms. The actual structure of O3 is an average of the two 
resonance structures. Molecular orbital model: There are two localized s 
bonds and a p bond that is delocalized over the entire surface of the mole-
cule. The delocalized p bond results from overlap of a p atomic oribtal on 
each oxygen atom in O3.

All of the carbon atoms in the rings have a trigonal planar arrangement of 
electron pairs, so these five carbon atoms are sp2 hybridized. The other 
three carbon atoms are sp3 hybridized because they have a tetrahedral ar-
rangement of electron pairs. The three nitrogen atoms that are bonded to a 
OCH3 group all have the CON bond formed from overlap of an sp3 hybrid 
orbital from carbon with an sp3 hybrid orbital from nitrogen. Note that each 
of these nitrogen atoms has a tetrahedral arrangement of electron pairs, 
hence they are sp3 hybridized. There are eight lone pairs of electrons, and 
the molecule has four p bonds (each double bond contains one p bond).

electron is removed, which will increase the bond order to 2.5 [5 (8 2 3)/2]. 
The bond order increases as an electron is removed, so the bond strengthens.

25.¬†C2H5OH1l2  nC2H5OH1g2  is an endothermic process. Heat is absorbed 
when liquid ethanol vaporizes; the internal heat from the body provides this 
heat, which results in the cooling of the body.   27.¬†Sublimation will occur, 
allowing water to escape as H2O(g).   29.¬† The strength of intermolecular 
forces determines relative boiling points. The types of intermolecular forces 
for covalent compounds are London dispersion forces, dipole forces, and hy-
drogen bonding. Because the three compounds are assumed to have similar 
molar mass and shape, the strength of the London dispersion forces will be 
about equal among the three compounds. One of the compounds will be non-
polar so it only has London dispersion forces. The other two compounds will 
be polar so they have additional dipole forces and will boil at a higher tem-
perature than the nonpolar compound. One of the polar compounds will have 
an H covalently bonded to either N, O, or F. This gives rise to the strongest 
type of covalent intermolecular force, hydrogen bonding. This compound ex-
hibiting hydrogen bonding will have the highest boiling point while the polar 
compound with no hydrogen bonding will boil at an intermediate tempera-
ture.   31.¬†a.¬†Both CO2 and H2O are molecular solids. Both have an ordered 
array of the individual molecules, with the molecular units occupying the 
lattice points. A difference within each solid lattice is the strength of the inter-
molecular forces. CO2 is nonpolar and only exhibits  London dispersion 
forces. H2O exhibits the relatively strong hydrogen bonding interactions. The 
difference in strength is evidenced by the solid phase change that occurs at 
1¬†atm. CO2 sublimes at a relatively low temperature of 2788C. In sublima-
tion, all of the intermolecular forces are broken. However, H2O doesn‚Äôt have 
a solid phase change until 08C, and in this phase change from ice to water, 
only a fraction of the intermolecular forces are broken. The higher tempera-
ture and the fact that only a portion of the intermolecular forces are broken are 
attributed to the strength of the intermolecular forces in H2O as compared to 
CO2. Related to the intermolecular forces are the relative densities of the solid 
and liquid phases for these two compounds. CO2(s) is denser than CO2(l) 
while H2O(s) is less dense than H2O(l). For CO2(s) and for most solids, the 
molecules pack together as close as possible, which is why solids are usually 
more dense than the liquid phase. Water is an exception to this. Water mole-
cules are particularly well suited to interact with each other because each 
 molecule has two polar OOH bonds and two lone pairs on each oxygen. This 
can lead to the association of four hydrogen atoms with each oxygen: two by 
covalent bonds and two by dipoles. To keep this symmetric arrangement 
(which maximizes the hydrogen bonding interactions), the H2O(s) molecules 
occupy positions that create empty space in the lattice. This translates into a 
smaller density for H2O(s) (less mass per unit volume). b.¬†Both NaCl and 
CsCl are ionic compounds with the anions at the lattice points of the unit cell 
and the cations occupying the empty spaces created by the anions (called 
holes). In NaCl, the Cl2 anions occupy the lattice points of a face-centered 
unit cell with the Na1 cations occupying the octahedral holes. Octahedral 
holes are the empty spaces created by six Cl2 ions. CsCl has the Cl2 ions at 
the lattice points of a simple cubic unit cell with the Cs1 cations occupying 
the middle of the cube.   33.¬†Chalk is composed of the ionic compound cal-
cium carbonate (CaCO3). The electrostatic forces in ionic compounds are 
much stronger than the intermolecular forces in covalent compounds. There-
fore, CaCO3 should have a much higher boiling point than the covalent com-
pounds found in motor oil and in H2O. Motor oil is composed of nonpolar 
COC and COH bonds. The intermolecular forces in motor oil are therefore 
London dispersion forces. We generally consider these forces to be weak. 
However, with compounds that have large molar masses, these London dis-
persion forces add up significantly and can overtake the relatively strong 
hydrogen bonding interactions in water.   35.¬†In the ln(Pvap) versus 1yT plot, 
the slope of the straight line is equal to 2DHvap/R.  Because DHvap is always

, l # 127 nm; c.¬†The ionization energy of a substance is the energy it takes 
to completely remove an electron. N2: (s2s)2(s2s*)2(p2p)4(s2p)2; the electron 
removed from N2 is in the s2p molecular orbital, which is lower in energy than 
the 2p atomic orbital from which the electron in atomic nitrogen is removed. 
Since the electron removed from N2 is lower in energy than the electron re-
moved in N, then the ionization energy of N2 is greater than the ionization 
energy of N.  99.¬†Both reactions apparently involve only the breaking of the 
NOCl bond. However, in the reaction ONCl n NO 1 Cl some energy is re-
leased in forming the stronger NO bond, lowering the value of DH. Therefore, 
the apparent NOCl bond energy is artificially low for this reaction. The first 
reaction involves only the breaking of the NOCl bond.   101.¬†The ground 
state MO electron configuration for He2 is (s1s)2(s1s*)2 giving a bond order of 
0. Therefore, He2 molecules are not predicted to be stable (and are not stable) 
in the lowest-energy ground state. However, in a high-energy environment, 
the electron(s) from the antibonding orbitals in He2 can be promoted into 
higher-energy bonding orbitals, thus giving a nonzero bond order and a ‚Äúrea-
son‚Äù to form. For example, a possible excited-state MO electron configuration 
for He2 would be (s1s)2(s1s*)1(s2s)1, giving a bond order of (3 2 1)/2 5 1. 
Thus excited He2 molecules can form, but they spontaneously break apart as 
the electron(s) fall back to the ground state, where the bond order equals zero. 
103.¬†The species with the smallest ionization energy has the highest energy 
electron. O2, N222, N22, and O21 all have at least one electron in the high-
energy p2p* orbitals. Because N222 has the highest ratio of electrons to pro-
tons, the p2p* electrons are least attracted to the nuclei and easiest to remove, 
translating into the smallest ionization energy.   105.¬†a.¬†The CO bond is polar, 
with the negative end at the more electronegative oxygen atom. We would 
expect metal cations to be attracted to and to bond to the oxygen end of CO 
on the basis of electronegativity. b.¬†The formal charge on C is 21, and the 
formal charge on O is 11. From formal charge, we would expect metal cat-
ions to bond to the carbon (with the negative formal charge). c.¬†In molecular 
orbital theory, only orbitals with proper symmetry overlap to form bonding 
orbitals. The metals that form bonds to CO are usually transition metals, all of 
which have outer electrons in the d orbitals. The only molecular orbitals of 
CO that have proper symmetry to overlap with d orbitals are the p2p* orbitals, 
whose shape is similar to that of the d orbitals. Since the antibonding molecu-
lar orbitals have more carbon character, one would expect the bond to form 
through carbon.   107.¬†a.¬†Li2 bond order 5 1; B2 bond order 5 1; b.¬†4 elec-

stances together in the solid and liquid phases. Hydrogen bonding is a specific 
type of intermolecular force. In this figure, the dotted lines represent the hy-
drogen bonding interactions that hold individual H2O molecules together in

verted to diamond by applying pressure.   109.¬†Because the density of the 
liquid phase is greater than the density of the solid phase, the slope of the 
solid/liquid boundary line is negative (as in H2O). With a negative slope,  
the melting points increase with a decrease in pressure so the normal melting 
point of X should be greater than 2258C.   111. The covalent bonds within a 
molecule are much stronger than the intermolecular forces between mole-
cules. Consider water, which exhibits a very strong type of dipole force 
called hydrogen bonding. When water boils at 1008C, hydrogen bonding in-
termolecular forces that hold the H2O molecules together in the liquid phase 
are broken, resulting in H2O(l) converting to H2O(g). At 1008C, the covalent 
bonds within each water molecule are not broken; if they were to be broken, 
then H2(g) and O2(g) would be the produced. It takes a lot more energy than 
what is provided at 1008C to break the covalent bonds within a water mole-
cule; the intramolecular forces within a covalent compound are much stron-
ger than the intermolecular forces between molecules.   113.¬†As the physical

line of the water phase diagram to below the freezing point, we find that su-
percooled water will have a higher vapor pressure than ice at 210¬∞C (see 
Fig. 10.44). To achieve equilibrium, there must be a constant vapor pressure. 
Over time, supercooled water will be transformed through the vapor into ice 
in an attempt to equilibrate the vapor pressure. Eventually there will only be 
ice at 210¬∞C along with H2O(g) at the vapor pressure given by the solid‚Äì 
vapor line in the phase diagram.   129.¬†4.65 kg/h   131. CO2 and XeF4 are

molecules with LD forces. PCl3 and SCl2 are polar molecules with LD and 
dipole forces. In these 8 molecular substances the intermolecular forces are 
weak and the melting points low. AlCl3 is intermediate. The melting point 
indicates there are stronger forces present than in the nonmetal halides,  
but not as strong as for an ionic solid. AlCl3 illustrates a gradual transition 
from ionic to covalent bonding; from an ionic solid to discrete molecules.

silicon with phosphorus produces an n-type semiconductor. The phosphorus 
adds electrons at energies near the conduction band of silicon.  Electrons do 
not need as much energy to move from filled to unfilled energy levels so con-
duction increases. Doping silicon with gallium produces a p-type semicon-
ductor. Because gallium has fewer valence electrons than silicon, holes (un-
filled energy levels) at energies in the previously filled molecular  orbitals are 
created, which induces greater electron movement (greater  conductivity).

69.¬†a.¬†These two molecules are named acetone (CH3COCH3) and water. As 
discussed in Section 11.4 on nonideal solutions, acetone‚Äìwater solutions ex-
hibit negative deviations from Raoult‚Äôs law. Acetone and water have the abil-
ity to hydrogen bond with each other, which gives the solution stronger inter-
molecular forces compared to the pure states of both solute and solvent. In 
the pure state, acetone cannot hydrogen bond with itself, so the middle dia-
gram illustrating negative deviations from Raoult‚Äôs law is the correct choice 
for acetone‚Äìwater solutions. b.¬† These two molecules are named ethanol 
(CH3CH2OH) and water. Ethanol‚Äìwater solutions show positive deviations 
from Raoult‚Äôs law. Both substances can hydrogen bond in the pure state, and 
they can continue this in solution. However, the solute‚Äìsolvent interactions 
are weaker for ethanol‚Äìwater solutions due to the significant nonpolar part of 
ethanol (CH3OCH2 is the nonpolar part of ethanol). This nonpolar part of 
ethanol weakens the intermolecular forces in solution, so the first diagram 
illustrating positive deviations from Raoult‚Äôs law is the correct choice for 
ethanol‚Äìwater solutions. c.¬†These two molecules are named heptane (C7H16) 
and hexane (C6H14). Heptane and hexane are very similar nonpolar sub-
stances; both are composed entirely of nonpolar COC bonds and relatively 
nonpolar COH bonds, and both have a similar size and shape. Solutions of 
heptane and hexane should be ideal, so the third diagram illustrating no de-
viation from Raoult‚Äôs law is the correct choice for heptane‚Äìhexane solutions. 
d.¬†These two molecules are named heptane (C7H16) and water. The interac-
tions between the nonpolar heptane molecules and the polar water molecules 
will certainly be weaker in solution compared to the pure solvent and pure 
solute interactions. This results in positive deviations from Raoult‚Äôs law (the 
first diagram).   71.¬†101.58C   73.¬†14.8¬†g C3H8O3   75.¬†Tf 5 229.98C, Tb 5

of the gas molecules in solution will have kinetic energy greater than the at-
tractive forces between the gas molecules and the solvent molecules. More 
gas molecules will escape to the vapor phase, and the solubility of the gas 
will decrease.   21.¬†The levels of the liquids in each beaker will become 
constant when the concentration of solute is the same in both beakers. Be-
cause the solute is less volatile, the beaker on the right will have a larger 
volume when the concentrations become equal. There will be a larger net 
transfer of water molecules into the the right beaker than the net transfer of 
solute molecules to the left beaker. Eventually the rate that solute and H2O 
leave and return to each beaker will become equal when the concentrations 
become equal.   23.¬†No. For an ideal solution, DHsoln 5 0.   25.¬†Normality is 
the number of equivalents per liter of solution. For an acid or a base, an 
equivalent is the mass of acid or base that can furnish 1 mole of protons  
(if an acid) or accept 1 mole of protons (if a base). A proton is an H1 ion. 
Molarity is defined as the moles of solute per liter of solution. When  
the number of equivalents equals the number of moles of solute, then  
normality 5 molarity. This is true for acids that only have one acidic proton 
in them and for bases that accept only one proton per formula unit. Examples 
of acids where equivalents 5 moles solute are HCl, HNO3, HF, and HC2H3O2. 
Examples of bases where equivalents 5 moles solute are NaOH, KOH, and 
NH3. When equivalents 2 moles solute, then normality 2 molarity. This is 
true for acids that donate more than one proton (H2SO4, H3PO4, H2CO3, etc.) 
and for bases that react with more than one proton per formula unit [Ca(OH)2, 
Ba(OH)2, Sr(OH)2, etc.].   27.¬†Only statement b is true. A substance freezes 
when the vapor pressures of the liquid and solid phases are the same. When 
a solute is added to water, the vapor pressure of the solution at 08C is less 
than the vapor pressure of the solid; the net result is for any ice present to 
convert to liquid in order to try to equalize the vapor pressures (which never 
can occur at 08C). A lower temperature is needed to equalize the vapor pres-
sures of water and ice, hence the freezing point is depressed. For statement 
a, the vapor pressure of a solution is directly related to the mole fraction of 
solvent (not solute) by Raoult‚Äôs law. For statement c, colligative properties 
depend on the number of solute particles present and not on the identity of 
the solute. For statement d, the boiling point of water is increased because 
the sugar solute decreases the vapor pressure of the water; a higher tempera-
ture is required for the vapor pressure of the solution to equal the external 
pressure so boiling can occur.  29.¬†Adding a solute to a solvent increases the 
boiling point and decreases the freezing point of the solvent. Thus, the sol-
vent is a liquid over a wider range of temperatures when a solute is dissolved. 
31.¬†The vapor pressure, boiling point, and osmotic pressure will be the same 
between the two different solutions.   33.¬†Isotonic solutions are those that 
have identical osmotic pressures. Crenation and hemolysis refer to phenom-
ena that occur when red blood cells are bathed in solutions having a mis-
match in osmotic pressure between the inside and the outside of the cell. 
When red blood cells are in a solution having a higher osmotic pressure than

the rate by affecting the value of the rate constant k.¬†The value of the rate 
constant is dependent on temperature. It also depends on the activation en-
ergy. A catalyst will change the value of k because the activation energy 
changes. Increasing the concentration (partial pressure) of either O2 or NO 
does not affect the value of k, but it does increase the rate of the reaction 
because both concentrations appear in the rate law.  15.¬†In a unimolecular 
reaction, a single reactant molecule decomposes to products. In a bimolecu-
lar reaction, two molecules collide to give products. The probability of the 
simultaneous collision of three molecules with enough energy and orienta-
tion is very small, making termolecular steps very unlikely.    17.¬†When the 
rate doubles as the concentration quadruples, the order is 1y2. For a reactant 
that has an order of 21, the rate will decrease by a factor of 1y2 when the 
concentrations are doubled.   19.¬†Two reasons are: 1) the collision must in-
volve enough energy to produce the reaction; i.e., the collision energy must 
equal or exceed the activation energy. 2) the relative orientation of the reac-
tants must allow formation of any new bonds necessary to produce prod-
ucts.   21.¬†Enzymes are very efficient catalysts. As is true for all catalysts, 
enzymes speed up a reaction by providing an alternative pathway for reactants 
to convert to products. This alternative pathway has a smaller activation en-
ergy and, hence, a faster rate. Also true is that catalysts are not used up in the 
overall chemical reaction. Once an enzyme comes in contact with the correct 
reagent, the chemical reaction quickly occurs, and the enzyme is then free to 
catalyze another reaction. Because of the efficiency of the reaction step, only 
a relatively small amount of enzyme is needed to catalyze a specific reaction, 
no matter how complex the reaction.   23.¬†The rate of a reaction is indepen-
dent of the enthalpy change for the reaction. The combustion of carbohy-
drates has a lower activation energy, which is why it is the faster process.

k[NO]2[Cl2]. If we assume the first step is rate determining, we would expect 
the rate law to be Rate 5 k1[NO][Cl2]. This isn‚Äôt correct. However, if we as-
sume the second step to be rate determining, then Rate 5 k2[NOCl2][NO]. To 
see if this agrees with experiment, we must substitute for the intermediate 
NOCl2 concentration. Assuming a fast-equilibrium first step (rate reverse 5 
rate forward):

substituting into the rate equation:

This is a possible mechanism with the second step the rate-determining 
step because the derived rate law agrees with the experimentally deter-
mined rate law.
sitely charged ions forming another charged layer on the outside. Overall, 
there are equal numbers of charged and oppositely charged ions, so the col-
loidal particles are electrically neutral. However, since the outer layers are 
the same charge, the particles repel each other and do not easily aggregate for 
precipitation to occur. Heating increases the velocities of the colloidal parti-
cles. This causes the particles to collide with enough energy to break the ion 
barriers, allowing the colloids to aggregate and eventually precipitate out. 
Adding an electrolyte neutralizes the adsorbed ion layers, which allows col-
loidal particles to aggregate and then precipitate out.   101.¬†No, the solution 
is not behaving ideally. If the solution were behaving ideally, the freezing 
point would be 21.9¬∞C.   103.¬† a. Water boils when the vapor pressure 
equals the pressure above the water. In an open pan, Patm < 1.0 atm. In a

The higher the cooking temperature, the faster the cooking time. b.¬†When 
water freezes from a solution, it freezes as pure water, leaving behind a more 
concentrated salt solution. c.¬†On the CO2 phase diagram, the triple point is 
above 1 atm and CO2(g) is the stable phase at 1 atm and room temperature. 
CO2(l) can‚Äôt exist at normal atmospheric pressures, which explains why dry 
ice sublimes rather than boils. In a fire extinguisher, P . 1 atm and CO2(l)

11. One experimental method to determine rate laws is the method of initial 
rates. Several experiments are carried out using different initial concentra-
tions of reactants, and the initial rate is determined for each experiment. The 
results are then compared to see how the initial rate depends on the initial 
concentrations. This allows the orders in the rate law to be determined. The 
value of the rate constant is determined from the experiments once the orders 
are known. The second experimental method utilizes the fact that the inte-
grated rate laws can be put in the form of a straight-line equation. Concentra-
tion versus time data are collected for a reactant as a reaction is run. These 
data are then manipulated and plotted to see which manipulation gives a 
straight line. From the straight-line plot we get the order of the reactant, and 
the slope of the line is mathematically related to k, the rate constant.   13.¬†All 
of these choices would affect the rate of the reaction, but only b and c affect

Note that the heights of the second and third humps must be lower than the 
first-step activation energy. However, the height of the third hump could be 
higher than the second hump. One cannot determine this absolutely from the

13.¬†No, equilibrium is a dynamic process. Both the forward and reverse reac-
tions are occurring at equilibrium, just at equal rates. Thus the forward and 
reverse reactions will distribute 14C atoms between CO and CO2.   15.¬† A 
large value for K (K @ 1) indicates there are relatively large concentrations of 
product gases and/or solutes as compared with the concentrations of reactant 
gases and/or solutes at equilibrium. A reaction with a large K value is a good 
source of products.   17.¬†4 molecules H2O, 2 molecules CO, 4 molecules H2, 
and 4 molecules CO2 are present at equilibrium.   19.¬†K and Kp are equilib-
rium constants as determined by the law of mass action. For K, the units used 
for concentrations are mol/L, and for Kp, partial pressures in units of atm are 
used (generally). Q is called the reaction quotient. Q has the exact same form 
as K or Kp, but instead of equilibrium concentrations, initial concentrations 
are used to calculate the Q value. Q is of use when it is compared to the K 
value. When Q 5¬†K (or when Qp 5 Kp), the reaction is at equilibrium. When 
Q 2 K, the reaction is not at equilibrium and one can determine what has to 
be the net change for the system to get to equilibrium.   21.¬†We always try to 
make good assumptions that simplify the math. In some problems, we can set 
up the problem so that the net change, x, that must occur to reach equilibrium 
is a small number. This comes in handy when you have expressions like  
0.12 2¬†x or 0.727 1 2x. When x is small, we assume that it makes little dif-
ference when subtracted from or added to some relatively big number. When 
this is true, 0.12 2 x < 0.12 and 0.727 1 2x < 0.727. If the assumption holds 
by the 5% rule, then the assumption is assumed valid. The 5% rule refers to x 
(or 2x or 3x, etc.) that was assumed small compared to some number. If x (or 
2x or 3x, etc.) is less than 5% of the number the assumption was made against, 
then the assumption will be assumed valid. If the 5% rule fails to work, one 
can generally use a math procedure called the method of successive approxi-
mations to solve the quadratic or cubic equation. 23. There will be a net in-
crease in the amount of N2O present once equilibrium is reestablished. As 
N2O(g) is added, the reaction will shift right to use up some of the added 
N2O. However, only some of the added N2O will react, not all. The net effect 
is for the amount of N2O to increase once equilibrium is reestablished. As far 
as the K value is concerned, as long as the temperature didn‚Äôt change, K will 
remain a constant value.

product, then we could conclude that this is a possible mechanism. If we got 
some other product, e.g., CH3CHD2, then we would conclude that the mecha-
nism is wrong. Even though this mechanism correctly predicts the products of 
the reaction, we cannot say conclusively that this is the correct mechanism; 
we might be able to conceive of other mechanisms that would give the same 
product as our proposed one.   83.¬†The rate depends on the number of reac-
tant molecules adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst. This quantity is pro-
portional to the concentration of reactant. However, when all the catalyst 
surface sites are occupied, the rate becomes independent of the concentration

donates a proton. NH22 is the conjugate base of the NH3 acid. In the reverse 
reaction, NH22 accepts a proton. Conjugate acid‚Äìbase pairs differ only by an 
H1 in the formula.   29.¬†a.¬†These would be 0.10¬†M solutions of strong acids 
like HCl, HBr, HI, HNO3, H2SO4, or HClO4. b.¬†These are salts of the conju-
gate acids of the bases in Table 14.3. These conjugate acids are all weak ac-
ids. Three examples would be 0.10¬†M solutions of NH4Cl, CH3NH3NO3, and 
C2H5NH3Br. Note that the anions used to form these salts are conjugate bases 
of strong acids; this is because they have no acidic or basic properties in 
water (with the exception of HSO42, which has weak acid properties).  
c. These would be 0.10¬†M solutions of strong bases like LiOH, NaOH, KOH, 
RbOH, CsOH, Ca(OH)2, Sr(OH)2, and Ba(OH)2. d.¬†These are salts of the 
conjugate bases of the neutrally charged weak acids in Table 14.2. The con-
jugate bases of weak acids are weak bases themselves. Three examples 
would be 0.10¬†M solutions of NaClO2, KC2H3O2, and CaF2. The cations used 
to form these salts are Li1, Na1, K1, Rb1, Cs1, Ca21, Sr21, and Ba21 since 
these cations have no acidic or basic properties in water. Notice that these are 
the cations of the strong bases that you should memorize. e.¬†There are two 
ways to make a neutral salt. The easiest way is to combine a conjugate base 
of a strong acid (except for HSO42) with one of the cations from the strong 
bases. These ions have no acidic/basic properties in water so salts of these 
ions are neutral. Three examples would be 0.10¬†M solutions of NaCl, KNO3, 
and SrI2. Another type of strong electrolyte that can produce neutral solu-
tions are salts that contain an ion with weak acid properties combined with 
an ion of opposite charge having weak base properties. If the Ka for the weak 
acid ion is equal to the Kb for the weak base ion, then the salt will produce a 
neutral solution. The most common example of this type of salt is ammo-
nium acetate, NH4C2H3O2. For this salt, Ka for NH41 5 Kb for C2H3O22 5

33.¬†a. H2SO3; b.¬†HClO3; c. H3PO3; NaOH and KOH are ionic compounds 
composed of either Na1 or K1 cations and OH2 anions. When soluble ionic 
compounds dissolve in water, they form the ions from which they are formed. 
The acids in this problem are all covalent compounds. When these acids dis-
solve in water, the covalent bond between oxygen and hydrogen breaks to form 
H1 ions.  35. a.¬† This expression holds true for solutions of monoprotic 
strong acids having a concentration greater than 1.0 3 1026 M. For example, 
0.10¬†M HCl, 7.8¬†M HNO3, and 3.6 3 1024¬†M HClO4 are solutions where this 
expression holds true. b. This expression holds true for solutions of weak 
acids where the two normal assumptions hold. The two assumptions are that 
the contribution of H1 from  water is negligible and that the acid is less than 
5% dissociated in water (from the assumption that x is small compared to 
some number). This expression will generally hold true for solutions of weak 
acids having a Ka value less than 1 3 1024, as long as there is a significant 
amount of weak acid present. Three  example solutions are 1.5¬†M HC2H3O2, 
0.10¬†M HOCl, and 0.72¬†M HCN. c. This expression holds true for strong 
bases that donate 2 OH2 ions per formula unit. As long as the concentration 
of the base is above 5 3 1027 M, this expression will hold true. Three ex-
amples are 5.0 3 1023¬† M Ca(OH)2, 2.1 3 1024¬† M Sr(OH)2, and 9.1 3

where the two normal assumptions hold. The assumptions are that the  
OH2 contribution from water is negligible and that the base is less than  
5% ionized in water. For the 5% rule to hold, you generally need bases with 
Kb , 1 3 1024 and concentrations of weak base greater than 0.10 M. Three 
examples are 0.10¬†M NH3, 0.54¬†M C6H5NH2, and 1.1¬†M C5H5N. 37.¬†One 
reason HF is a weak acid is that the H‚ÄîF bond is unusually strong and thus, 
is difficult to break. This contributes to the reluctance of the HF molecules to

crease the volume of the container. This is because the container is a constant-
pressure system, and if the number of moles increases at constant T and P, 
the volume must increase. An increase in volume will dilute the concentra-
tions of all gaseous reactants and gaseous products. Because there are more 
moles of product gases than reactant gases (3 moles vs. 2 moles), the dilution 
will decrease the numerator of K more than the denominator will decrease. 
This causes Q , K and the reaction shifts right to get back to equilibrium. 
Because temperature was unchanged, the value of K will not change. K is a 
constant as long as temperature is constant.   125.¬†192 g; 1.3 atm  127.¬†33

11. When an acid dissociates, ions are produced. A common ion is when one 
of the product ions in a particular equilibrium is added from an outside 
source. For a weak acid dissociating to its conjugate base and H1, the com-
mon ion would be the conjugate base; this would be added by dissolving a 
soluble salt of the conjugate base into the acid solution. The presence of the 
conjugate base from an outside source shifts the equilibrium to the left so 
less acid  dissociates.   13.¬†The more weak acid and conjugate base present, 
the more H1 and/or OH2 that can be absorbed by the buffer without signifi-
cant pH change. When the concentrations of weak acid and conjugate base 
are equal (so that pH 5 pKa), the buffer system is equally efficient at absorb-
ing either H1 or OH2. If the buffer is overloaded with weak acid or with 
conjugate base, then the buffer is not equally efficient at absorbing either H1 
or OH2.   15.¬†a.¬†Let‚Äôs call the acid HA, which is a weak acid. When HA is 
present in the beakers, it exists in the undissociated form, making it a weak 
acid. A strong acid would exist as separate H1 and A2 ions. b.¬†beaker c ‚Üí 
beaker a ‚Üí beaker e ‚Üí beaker b ‚Üí beaker d c.¬†pH 5 pKa when a buffer 
solution is present that has equal concentrations of the weak acid and conju-
gate base. This is beaker e.¬†d. The equivalence point is when just enough 
OH2 has been added to exactly react with all of the acid present initially. 
This is beaker b.¬†e. Past the equivalence point, the pH is dictated by the con-
centration of excess OH2 added from the strong base. We can ignore the 
amount of hydroxide added by the weak conjugate base that is also present. 
This is beaker d.   17.¬†The three key points to emphasize in your sketch are 
the initial pH, the pH at the halfway point to equivalence, and the pH at the 
equivalence point. For the two weak bases titrated, pH 5 pKa at the halfway 
point to equivalence (50.0 mL HCl added) because [weak base] 5 [conju-
gate acid] at this point. For the initial pH, the strong base has the highest pH 
(most basic), while the weakest base has the lowest pH (least basic). At the 
equivalence point, the strong base titration has pH 5 7.0. The weak bases 
titrated have acidic pHs at the equivalence point because the conjugate acids 
of the weak bases titrated are the major species present. The weakest base 
has the strongest conjugate acid so its pH will be lowest (most acidic) at the 
equivalence point.

best buffer has approximately equal concentrations of weak acid and conju-

buffer is 2log(7.5 3 1023) 5 2.12. A pH of 7.15 is too high for an 
H3PO4yH2PO42 buffer to be effective. At this high of a pH, there would be so 
little H3PO4 present that we could hardly consider it a buffer; this solution 
would not be effective in resisting pH changes, especially when a strong base 
is added.  97. Removal of NaHCO3 (HCO3‚Äì) causes the buffer equilibrium 
to shift right to produce more H1. This causes the blood to become more 
acidic, so pH decreases. Treatment involves the IV addition of HCO3‚Äì.

11.¬†Ksp values can only be compared to determine relative solubilities when 
the salts produce the same number of ions. Here, Ag2S and CuS do not pro-
duce the same number of ions when they dissolve, so each has a different 
mathematical relationship between the Ksp value and the molar solubility. To 
determine which salt has the larger molar solubility, you must do the actual 
calculations and compare the two molar solubility values.   13.¬†i.¬†This is the 
result when you have a salt that breaks up into two ions. Examples of these 
salts would be AgCl, SrSO4, BaCrO4, and ZnCO3. ii. This is the result when 
you have a salt that breaks up into three ions, either two cations and one an-
ion or one cation and two anions. Some examples are SrF2, Hg2I2, and 
Ag2SO4. iii. This is the result when you have a salt that breaks up into four 
ions, either three cations and one anion (Ag3PO4) or one cation and three 
19. At 50.0 mL of NaOH added, this is the first halfway point to equivalence 
where H3AsO4 and H2AsO4‚Äì are the major species present (along with H2O). 
At this point, we have a buffer solution in which [H3AsO4] 5 [H2AsO4‚Äì] and 
pH 5 pKa1 5 ‚Äìlog(5.5 3 10‚Äì3) 5 2.26. At 150.0 mL of NaOH added, this is 
the second halfway point to equivalence at which H2AsO4‚Äì and HAsO42‚Äì are 
the major species present (along with H2O). At this point, we have a buffer 
solution in which [H2AsO4‚Äì] 5 [HAsO42‚Äì] and pH 5 pKa2 5 ‚Äìlog(1.7 3 
10‚Äì7) 5 6.77. At the third halfway point to equivalence, [HAsO42‚Äì] 5 
[AsO43‚Äì] and pH 5 pKa3. This third halfway point will be at 250.0 mL of 
NaOH added.  21. Only the third beaker represents a buffer solution. A 
weak acid and its conjugate base both must be present in large quantities in 
order to have a buffer solution. This is only the case in the third beaker. The 
first beaker represents a beaker full of strong acid that is 100% dissociated. 
The second beaker represents a weak acid solution. In a weak acid solution, 
only a small fraction of the acid is dissociated. In this representation, 1/10 of 
the weak acid has dissociated. The only B2 present in this beaker is from the 
dissociation of the weak acid. A buffer solution has B2 added from another 
source.   23. When strong acid or strong base is added to a sodium bicarbon-
ate/sodium carbonate buffer mixture, the strong acid/base is neutralized. The 
reaction goes to completion resulting in the strong acid/base being replaced 
with a weak acid/base. This results in a new buffer solution. The reactions 
are H1(aq) 1 CO322(aq) n HCO32(aq); OH2(aq) 1 HCO32(aq) n 
CO322(aq) 1 H2O(l)   25.¬†a.¬†2.96; b.¬†8.94; c.¬†7.00; d.¬†4.89   27.¬†1.1% vs. 1.3

ions to form the soluble complex ion Ag(NH3)21. As this complex ion forms, 
Ag1 is removed from solution, which causes AgCl(s) to dissolve. When 
enough NH3 is added, then all of the silver chloride precipitate will dissolve. 
The equation is AgCl1s2 1 2NH31aq2 S Ag1NH32 2
11aq2 1 Cl21aq2 . Test 
tube 3: added H1 reacts with the weak base NH3 to form NH41. As NH3 is

re-form AgCl(s). The equations are Ag(NH3)21(aq) 1 2H1(aq) n Ag1(aq)

will have no effect on the AgBr(s) solubility in pure water. Neither H1 nor

HBr, so it is a terrible base. However, added HNO3 will reduce the solubility 
of AgBr(s) in the ammonia solution. NH3 is a weak base (Kb 5 1.8 3 1025). 
Added H1 will react with NH3 to form NH41. As NH3 is removed, a smaller 
amount of the Ag(NH3)21 complex ion will form, resulting in a smaller

11. Living organisms need an external source of energy to carry out these 
processes. For all processes combined, DSuniv must be greater than zero (the 
2nd law).   13.¬†As any process occurs, DSuniv will increase; DSuniv cannot de-
crease. Time also goes in one direction, just as DSuniv goes in one direction. 
15.¬† This reaction is kinetically slow but thermodynamically favorable  
(DG , 0). Thermodynamics only tells us if a reaction can occur. To answer 
the question will the reaction occur, one also needs to consider the kinetics 
(speed of reaction). The ultraviolet light provides the activation energy for this 
slow reaction to occur.   17.¬†DSsurr 5 2DH/T; heat flow (DH) into or out of 
the system dictates DSsurr. If heat flows into the surroundings, the random mo-
tions of the surroundings increase, and the entropy of the surroundings in-
creases. The opposite is true when heat flows from the surroundings into the 
system (an endothermic reaction). Although the driving force described here 
really results from the change in entropy of the surroundings, it is often de-
scribed in terms of energy. Nature tends to seek the lowest possible en-
ergy.  19.¬†a. increases; b. no change; c. decreases   21.¬†Note that these sub-
anions (ignoring the hydroxides, there are no examples of this type of salt in 
Table 16.1). iv. This is the result when you have a salt that breaks up into five 
ions, either three cations and two anions [Sr3(PO4)2] or two cations and three 
anions (no examples of this type of salt are in Table 16.1).   15.¬†For the Ksp 
reaction of a salt dissolving into its respective ions, the common ion would 
be if one of the ions in the salt was added from an outside source. When a 
common ion is present, the Ksp equilibrium shifts to the left resulting in less 
of the salt dissolving into its ions.   17.¬†Some people would automatically 
think that an increase in temperature would increase the solubility of a salt. 
This is not always the case because some salts show a decrease in solubility 
as temperature increases. The two major methods used to increase solubility 
of a salt both involve removing one of the ions in the salt by reaction. If the 
salt has an ion with basic properties, adding H1 will increase the solubility 
of the salt because the added H1 will react with the basic ion, thus removing 
it from solution. More salt dissolves in order to make up for the lost ion. 
Some examples of salts with basic ions are AgF, CaCO3, and Al(OH)3. The 
other way to remove an ion is to form a complex ion. For example, the Ag1 
ion in silver salts forms the complex ion Ag(NH3)21 as ammonia is added. 
Silver salts increase their solubility as NH3 is added because the Ag1 ion is 
removed through complex ion formation.  19. For conjugate acid‚Äìbase 
pairs, the weaker the acid, the stronger is the conjugate base. Because HX is 
a stronger acid (has a larger Ka value) than HY, Y2 will be a stronger base 
than X2. In acidic solution, Y2 will have a greater affinity for the H1 ions. 
Therefore, AgY(s) will be more soluble in acidic solution because more Y2 
will be removed through reaction with H1, which will cause more AgY(s)  
to dissolve.   21.¬† In 2.0¬† M NH3, the  soluble complex ion Ag(NH3)21 
forms, which increases the solubility of AgCl(s). The reaction is 
AgCl(s) 1 2NH3(aq) m  Ag(NH3)21(aq) 1 Cl2 (aq). In 2.0 M NH4NO3, 
NH3 is only formed by the dissociation of the weak acid NH41. There is not 
enough NH3 produced by this reaction to dissolve AgCl(s) by the formation 
of the complex ion.   23.¬†a. AgC2H3O21s2 m Ag11aq2  1 C2H3O2

the salt can act as a base in water, then the solubility of the salt will increase 
as the solution becomes more acidic. Added H1 will react with the base, 
forming the conjugate acid. As the basic anion is removed, more of the salt 
will dissolve to replenish the basic anion. The salts with basic anions are 
Ag3PO4, CaCO3, CdCO3, and Sr3(PO4)2. Hg2Cl2 and PbI2 do not have any pH 
dependence  because Cl2 and I2 are terrible bases (the conjugate bases of 
strong acids).

101.¬†DS is more favorable (less negative) for reaction 2 than for reaction 1, 
resulting in K2 . K1. In reaction 1, seven particles in solution form one 
 particle. In reaction 2, four particles form one, which results in a smaller 
decrease in positional probability than for reaction 1.   103.¬† 725¬† K 
105. A negative value for DS8 indicates a process that has a decrease in posi-
tional probability. Processes b, c, and d all are expected to have negative 
values for DS8. In these processes, the number of moles of gaseous molecules 
decreases as reactants are converted to products. Whenever this occurs, posi-
tional probability decreases. Processes a and e have positive DS8 values. In 
process a, the number of gaseous molecules increase as reactants are con-
verted to products, so positional probability increases. In process e, the liq-
uid state has a larger positional probability compared to the solid state. 
107. DS8 5 49 J/K; DSsurr = 2140 J/K  109. 74.4 kJ/mol  111. a. False; the 
moles of gaseous molecules decrease in this reaction, so DS8 is negative 
 (unfavorable). From the problem DG8 is negative, which can only occur if 
DH8 is negative (exothermic). b. True. c. False; heat is a product in this exo-
thermic reaction. As heat is added (temperature increases), this reaction will 
shift left by Le Ch√¢telier‚Äôs principle. This results in a decrease in the value  
of K. At equilibrium at the higher temperature, reactant concentrations will 
increase and the product concentration will decrease. Therefore, the ratio  
of [PCl5]/[PCl3] will decrease with an increase in temperature. d. False; 
when the signs of DH8 and ŒîS8 are both negative, the reaction will only  
be spontaneous at temperatures below some value (at low temperatures) 
where the favorable DH8 term dominates. e. True; when DG8 , 0, K must be 
greater than 1.   113.¬†a. Vessel 1: At 08C, this system is at equilibrium, so 
DSuniv 5 0 and DS 5 DSsurr. Because the vessel is perfectly insulated, q 5 0 
so DSsurr 5 0 5 DSsys. b.¬†Vessel 2: The presence of salt in water lowers the 
freezing point of water to a temperature below 08C. In vessel 2 the conver-
sion of ice into water will be spontaneous at 08C, so DSuniv > 0. Because  
the vessel is perfectly insulated, DSsurr 5 0. Therefore, DSsys must be positive 
(DS > 0) in order for DSuniv to be positive.   115.¬†DH8 5 286 kJ; DG8 5 326 kJ;

stances are not in the solid state but are in the aqueous state; water molecules 
are also present. There is an apparent increase in ordering when these ions are 
placed in water. The hydrating water molecules must be in a highly ordered 
state when surrounding these anions.   23.¬†One can determine DS8 and DH8 
for the reaction using the standard entropies and standard enthalpies of forma-
tion in Appendix 4, then use the equation DG8 5 DH8 2 TDS8. One can also 
use the standard free energies of formation in Appendix 4. And finally, one 
can use Hess‚Äôs law to calculate DG8. Here, reactions having known DG8 val-
ues are manipulated to determine DG8 for a different reaction. For tempera-
tures other than 258C, DG8 is estimated using the DG8 5 DH8 2 TDS8 equa-
tion. The assumptions made are that the DH8 and DS8 values determined from 
Appendix 4 data are temperature independent. We use the same DH8 and DS8 
values as determined when T 5 258C, then plug in the new temperature in 
kelvins into the equation to estimate DG8 at the new temperature.   25.¬†The 
light source for the first reaction is necessary for kinetic reasons. The first re-
action is just too slow to occur unless a light source is available. The kinetics 
of a reaction are independent of the thermodynamics of a reaction. Even 
though the first reaction is more favorable thermodynamically (assuming 
standard conditions), it is unfavorable for kinetic reasons. The second reaction 
has a negative DG8 value and is a fast reaction, so the second reaction occurs 
very quickly. When considering if a reaction will occur, thermodynamics and 
kinetics must both be considered.  27. Only statement e is true.   29.¬†a, b, c

and electrical energy. A redox (oxidation‚Äìreduction) reaction is a reaction in 
which one or more electrons are transferred. In a galvanic cell, a spontaneous 
redox reaction occurs which produces an electric current. In an electrolytic 
cell, electricity is used to force a nonspontaneous redox reaction to occur. 
25.¬†Magnesium is an alkaline earth metal; Mg will oxidize to Mg21. The 
oxidation state of hydrogen in HCl is 11. To be reduced, the oxidation state 
of H must decrease. The obvious choice for the hydrogen product is H2(g) 
where hydrogen has a zero oxidation state. The balanced reaction is: Mg(s) 1 
2HCl(aq) n MgCl2(aq) 1 H2(g). Mg goes from the 0 to the 12 oxidation 
state by losing two electrons. Each H atom goes from the 11 to the 0 oxida-
tion state by gaining one electron. Since there are two H atoms in the bal-
anced equation, then a total of two electrons are gained by the H atoms. 
Hence, two electrons are transferred in the balanced reaction. When the elec-
trons are transferred directly from Mg to H1, no work is obtained. In order to 
harness this reaction to do useful work, we must control the flow of electrons 
through a wire. This is accomplished by making a galvanic cell, which sepa-
rates the reduction reaction from the oxidation reaction in order to control the 
flow of electrons through a wire to produce a voltage.   27.¬†An extensive 
property is one that depends on how many times the reaction occurs. The free 
energy change for a reaction depends on whether 1 mole of product is pro-
duced or 2 moles of product is produced or 1 million moles of product is 
produced. This is not the case for cell potentials, which do not depend on 
how many times the reaction occurs. The equation that relates DG to E is 
DG 5 2nFE. It is the n term that converts the intensive property E into the 
extensive property DG. n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in 
the balanced  reaction that DG is associated with.   29. A potential hazard 
when jump-starting a car is that the electrolysis of H2O(l) can occur. When 
H2O(l) is electrolyzed, the products are the explosive gas mixture of H2(g) 
and O2(g). A spark produced during jump-starting a car could ignite any 
H2(g) and O2(g) produced. Grounding the jumper cable far from the battery 
minimizes the risk of a spark nearby the battery where H2(g) and O2(g) could 
be collecting.   31.¬†You need to know the identity of the metal so you know 
which molar mass to use. You need to know the oxidation state of metal ion 
in the salt so the moles of electrons transferred can be determined. And fi-
nally, you need to know the amount of current and the time the current was 
passed through the electrolytic cell. If you know these four quantities, then 
the mass of metal plated out can be calculated.   33. Only statement e is true. 
The attached metals that are more easily oxidized than iron are called sacri-
ficial metals. For statement a, corrosion is a spontaneous process, like the 
ones harnessed to make galvanic cells. For statement b, corrosion of steel is 
the oxidation of iron coupled with the reduction of oxygen. For statement c, 
cars rust more easily in high-moisture areas (the humid areas) because water 
is a reactant in the reduction half- reaction as well as providing a medium for 
ion migration (a salt bridge of sorts). For statement d, salting roads adds ions 
to the corrosion process, which increases the conductivity of the aqueous 
solution and, in turn, accelerates corrosion.  35.¬†The reducing agent causes 
reduction to occur; it does this by containing the species that is oxidized. 
Oxidation occurs at the anode, so the reducing agent will be in the anode 
compartment. The oxidizing agent causes oxidation to occur; it does this by 
containing the species that is reduced. Reduction occurs at the cathode, so 
the oxidizing agent will be in the cathode compartment. Electron flow is 
always from the anode compartment to the cathode compartment.

1. The gravity of the earth cannot keep the light H2 molecules in the atmo-
sphere.   3. Calcium is found in the structural material that makes up bones 
and teeth. Magnesium plays a vital role in metabolism and in muscle func-
tion.   5. For Groups 1A‚Äì3A, the small size of H (as compared to Li), Be (as 
compared to Mg), and B (as compared to Al) seems to be the reason why 
these elements have nonmetallic properties, while others in Groups 1A‚Äì3A 
are strictly metallic. The small size of H, Be, and B also causes these species 
to polarize the electron cloud in nonmetals, thus forcing a sharing of elec-
trons when bonding occurs. For Groups 4A‚Äì6A, a major difference between 
the first and second members of a group is the ability to form p bonds. The 
smaller elements form stable p bonds, while the larger elements do not ex-
hibit good overlap between parallel p orbitals and, in turn, do not form strong 
p bonds. For Group 7A, the small size of F as compared to Cl is used to ex-
plain the low electron affinity of F and the weakness of the FOF bond.   7. In 
order to maximize hydrogen bonding interactions in the solid phase, ice is 
forced into an open structure. This open structure is why H2O(s) is less dense 
than H2O(l).   9.¬†Group 1A and 2A metals are all easily oxidized. They must 
be produced in the absence of materials (H2O, O2) that are capable of oxidiz-

1. The characteristic frequencies of energies emitted in a nuclear reaction 
suggest that discrete energy levels exist in the nucleus. The extra stability of 
certain numbers of nucleons and the predominance of nuclei with even num-
bers of nucleons suggest that the nuclear structure might be described by us-
ing quantum numbers.   3. Radiotracers generally have short half-lives. The 
radioactivity from the radiotracers is monitored to study a specific area of the 
body. However, we don‚Äôt want long-lived radioactivity in order to minimize 
potential damage to healthy tissue by the radioactivity.  5. b-particle pro-
duction has the net effect of turning a neutron into a proton. Radioactive 
nuclei having too many neutrons typically undergo b-particle decay. Posi-
tron production has the net effect of turning a proton into a neutron. Nuclei 
having too many protons typically undergo positron decay.  7. The trans-
uranium elements are the elements having more protons than uranium. They 
are synthesized by bombarding heavier nuclei with neutrons and positive 
ions in a particle accelerator.   9. DE 5 Dmc2; The key difference is the mass 
change when going from reactants to products. In chemical reactions, the 
mass change is indiscernible. In nuclear processes, the mass change is dis-
cernible. It is the conversion of this discernible mass change into energy that 
results in the huge energies associated with nuclear processes.   11.¬† The 
temperatures of fusion reactions are so high that all physical containers 
would be destroyed. At these high temperatures, most of the electrons are 
stripped from the atoms. A plasma of gaseous ions is formed that can be 
controlled by magnetic fields.   13. Somatic damage is immediate damage to 
the organism itself, resulting in sickness or death. Genetic damage is damage 
to the genetic material, which can be passed on to future generations. The 
organism will not feel immediate consequences from genetic damage, but its 
offspring may be damaged.  15.¬†a.¬†31H n 32He 1 210e; b.¬†83Li n 84Be 1 210e,

and positron production are both possible decay mechanisms that increase 
the neutron-to-proton ratio. Alpha-particle production also increases the 
neutron-to-proton ratio, but it is not likely for these light nuclei. 12B and 13B 
contain too many neutrons or too few protons. Beta-particle production  
lowers the neutron-to-proton ratio, so we expect these to be beta-emitters.

H3PO4 has three oxygen-bonded hydrogens, and it is a triprotic acid. H3PO3 
has only two of the hydrogens bonded to oxygen, and it is a diprotic acid. The

ing them.   11. The reaction N2(g) 1 3H2(g) m  2NH3(g) is exothermic. 
Thus, the value of the equilibrium constant K decreases as the temperature 
increases. Lower temperatures are favored for maximum yield of ammonia. 
However, at lower temperatures the rate is slow; without a catalyst the rate is 
too slow for the process to be feasible. The discovery of a catalyst increased 
the rate of reaction at a lower temperature favored by thermodynamics. 
13.¬†Boranes are covalent compounds produced between boron and hydrogen. 
The B‚ÄîH bonds in boranes are relatively weak and are very reactive.  
When boranes are reacted with oxygen, the product bonds are much stron-
ger than the reactant bonds. When this is the case, very exothermic reactions 
result, which are the bases for good rocket fuels.   15.¬†a. DH8 5 207¬†kJ,

excess oxygen, Li2O forms, which is composed of Li1 and O22 ions. This is 
called an oxide salt. When sodium reacts with oxygen, Na2O2 forms, which 
is composed of Na1 and O222ions. This is called a peroxide salt. When  
potassium (or rubidium or cesium) reacts with oxygen, KO2 forms, which is 
composed of K1 and O22 ions. For your information, this is called a super-
oxide salt. So the three types of alkali metal oxides that can form differ  
in the oxygen anion part of the formula (O22 vs. O222 vs. O22). Each of 
these anions have unique bonding arrangements and oxidation states. 
21.¬†The small size of the Li1 cation results in a much greater attraction to 
water. The attraction to water is not so great for the other alkali metal ions. 
Thus lithium salts tend to absorb water.   23.¬†CaCO3(s) 1 H2SO4(aq) n

39.¬†Compounds containing SiOSi single and multiple bonds are rare, unlike 
compounds of carbon. The bond strengths of the SiOSi and COC single 
bonds are similar. The difference in bonding properties must be for other 
reasons. One reason is that silicon does not form strong pi bonds, unlike 
carbon. Another reason is that silicon forms particularly strong sigma bonds 
to oxygen, resulting in compounds with SiOO bonds instead of SiOSi 
bonds.   41.¬†O

 The darker green orbitals about carbon are sp hy-

exist. The two carbon‚Äìoxygen s bonds are formed from overlap of sp hybrid 
orbitals from carbon with an sp2 hybrid orbital from each oxygen. The two

bridized p atomic orbitals from carbon with an unhybridized p atomic orbital

13.¬†From Table 21.16, the red octahedral Co(H2O)621 complex ion absorbs 
blue-green light (l < 490 nm), whereas the blue tetrahedral CoCl422 complex 
ion absorbs orange light (l < 600 nm). Because tetrahedral complexes have a 
d-orbital splitting much less than octahedral complexes, one would expect the 
tetrahedral complex to have a smaller energy difference between split d orbit-
als. This translates into longer-wavelength light absorbed (E 5 hc/l) for tetra-
hedral complex ions compared to octahedral complex ions. Information from 
Table 21.16 confirms this.   15.¬†SCN2, NO22, and OCN2 can form linkage 
isomers; all are able to bond to the metal ion in two different ways.   17. Sc31 
has no electrons in d orbitals. Ti31 and V31 have d electrons present. The color 
of transition metal complexes results from electron transfer between split d

gen content of air is lower, so less oxyhemoglobin is formed which diminishes 
the transport of oxygen in the blood. A serious illness called high-altitude sick-
ness can result from the decrease of O2 in the blood. High- altitude acclimatiza-
tion is the phenomenon that occurs in the human body in  response to the lower 
amounts of oxyhemoglobin in the blood. This response is to produce more he-
moglobin, and, hence, increase the oxyhemoglobin in the blood. High-altitude 
acclimatization takes several weeks to take hold for people moving from lower 
altitudes to higher altitudes.  23. a. Sc: [Ar]4s23d1; b. Ru: [Kr]5s24d6 (ex-

OF4 would not form. This compound would require oxygen to have more than 
8 valence electrons around it. This never occurs for oxygen; oxygen does not 
have low-energy d orbitals it can use to expand its octet.   71.¬†The oxyacid

Acid‚Äìbase: A proton is transferred from an acid, H2O, to a base, H2, forming 
the conjugate base of water, OH2, and the conjugate acid of H2, H2. Oxidation‚Äì
reduction: The oxidation state of hydrogen is 21 in NaH, 11 in H2O, and zero 
in H2. Hydrogen is oxidized when it goes from NaH to H2 (from 21 S 0) and 
hydrogen is reduced when it goes from H2O to H2 (from 11 S 0). In  
this reaction, an electron is transferred from the hydride ion to a hydrogen in 
water when forming H2.   85.¬†a. AgCl(s) 8n Ag(s) 1 Cl; the reactive chlorine

5. The lanthanide elements are located just before the 5d transition metals. 
The lanthanide contraction is the steady decrease in the atomic radii of the 
lanthanide elements when going from left to right across the periodic table. 
As a result of the lanthanide contraction, the sizes of the 4d and 5d elements 
are very similar. This leads to a greater similarity in the chemistry of the 4d 
and 5d elements in a given vertical group.   7. No; both the trans and the cis 
forms of Co(NH3)4Cl21 have mirror images that are superimposable. For the 
cis form, the mirror image only needs a 908 rotation to produce the original 
structure. Hence, neither the trans nor the cis form is optically active.

spin (weak-field) Cr21 complexes have four unpaired electrons and low- 
spin (strong-field) Cr21 complexes have two unpaired electrons. Ni21: 
[Ar]3d8; octahedral Ni21 complexes will always have two unpaired elec-
trons, whether high or low spin. Therefore, Ni21 complexes cannot be used 
to distinguish weak- from strong-field ligands by examining magnetic prop-
erties. Alternatively, the ligand field strengths can be measured using visible

3-methylhexane is correct.
All six of these are the same compound. They only differ from each other by 
rotations about one or more carbon‚Äìcarbon single bonds. Only one isomer of 
C7H16 is present in all of these names: 3-methylhexane.
5. Hydrocarbons are nonpolar substances exhibiting only London disper-
sion forces. Size and shape are the two most important structural features 
relating to the strength of London dispersion forces. For size, the bigger the 
molecule (the larger the molar mass), the stronger the London dispersion 
forces and the higher the boiling point. For shape, the more branching pres-
ent in a compound, the weaker the London dispersion forces and the lower 
the boiling point.   7. The amide functional group is:
N
H
O
A
C
O O O
B
When the amine end of one amino acid reacts with the carboxylic acid end 
of another amino acid, the two amino acids link together by forming an am-
ide functional group. A polypeptide has many amino acids linked together, 
with each linkage made by the formation of an amide functional group. Be-
cause all linkages result in the presence of the amide functional group, the 
resulting polymer is called a polyamide. For nylon, the monomers also link 
together by forming the amide functional group (the amine end of one mono-
mer reacts with a carboxylic acid end of another monomer to give the amide 
functional group linkage). Hence nylon is also a polyamide. The correct or-
der of strength is polyhydrocarbon , polyester ,  polyamide. The differ-
ence in strength is related to the types of intermolecular forces present. All of 
these polymers have London dispersion forces. However, polyhydrocarbons 
only have London dispersion forces. The polar ester group in polyesters and 
the polar amide group in polyamides give rise to additional dipole forces. 
The polyamide has the ability to form relatively strong hydrogen bonding 
interactions, hence why it would form the strongest fibers.

gram that would result in a diamagnetic species.   97.¬†a. 20.26 V; b.¬†From 
standard reduction potentials, Co31 (%¬∞ 5 1.82 V) is a much stronger oxidiz-
ing agent than Co(en)331 (%¬∞ 5 20.26 V); c.¬†In aqueous solution, Co31 forms 
the hydrated transition metal complex, Co(H2O)631. In both complexes, 
Co(H2O)631 and Co(en)331, cobalt exists as Co31, which has 6¬†d electrons. If 
we assume a strong-field case for each complex ion, then the d-orbital split-
ting diagram for each has the six electrons paired in the lower-energy t2g or-
bitals. When each complex ion gains an electron, the electron enters the 
higher-energy eg orbitals. Since en is a stronger-field ligand than H2O, then 
the d-orbital splitting is larger for Co(en)331, and it takes more energy to add 
an electron to Co(en)331 than to Co(H2O)631. Therefore, it is more favorable 
for Co(H2O)631 to gain an electron than for Co(en)331 to gain an electron. 
99.¬†No, in all three cases six bonds are formed between Ni21 and nitrogen. 
So DH values should be similar. DS8 for formation of the complex ion is most 
negative for 6 NH3 molecules reacting with a metal ion (7 independent spe-
cies become 1). For penten reacting with a metal ion, 2 independent species 
become 1, so DS8 is the least negative. Thus the chelate effect occurs because 
the more bonds a chelating agent can form to the metal, the less unfavorable 
DS8 becomes for the formation of the complex ion, and the larger the forma-
tion constant.

1. Carbon has the unusual ability to form bonds to itself, whether they are 
single, double, or triple bonds, as well as the ability to form long chains or 
rings of carbon atoms. Carbon also forms strong bonds to other nonmetals 
such as hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, and the halogens. Because of 
this bonding ability, carbon can form millions of compounds, including bio-
molecules, which are the basis for the existence of life.

11. a. A polyester forms when an alcohol functional group reacts with a 
carboxylic acid functional group. The monomer for a homopolymer polyes-
ter must have an alcohol functional group and a carboxylic acid functional 
group  present in the structure. b. A polyamide forms when an amine func-
tional group reacts with a carboxylic acid functional group. For a copolymer 
polyamide, one monomer would have at least two amine functional groups 
present and the other monomer would have at least two carboxylic acid func-
tional groups  present. For polymerization to occur, each monomer must have 
two reactive functional groups present. c. To form an addition polymer, a 
carbon‚Äìcarbon double bond must be present. To form a polyester, the mono-
mer would need the alcohol and carboxylic acid functional groups present. 
To form a polyamide, the monomer would need the amine and carboxylic 
acid functional groups  present. The two possibilities are for the monomer to 
have a carbon‚Äìcarbon double bond, an alcohol functional group, and a car-
boxylic acid functional group all present, or to have a carbon‚Äìcarbon double 
bond, an amine functional group, and a carboxylic acid functional group 
present.
13. Denaturation is the breakdown of the three-dimensional structure of pro-
tein. Both the secondary and the tertiary structures of the protein are dis-
rupted in denaturation. The primary structure (the order in which the amino 
acids link to each other) is not affected by denaturation.

69. For the iron-catalyzed reaction, one of the ortho or para hydrogens in 
benzene is replaced by chlorine. When an iron catalyst is not present, the 
benzene hydrogens are unreactive. To substitute for an alkane hydrogen, 
light must be present. For toluene, the light-catalyzed reaction substitutes a 
chlorine for a hydrogen in the methyl group attached to the benzene ring.

127. 2238C: CH3OOOCH3; 78.58C: CH3OCH2OOH   129.¬† Alcohols 
consist of two parts, the polar OH group and the nonpolar hydrocarbon chain 
 attached to the OH group. As the length of the nonpolar hydrocarbon chain 
increases, the solubility of the alcohol decreases. In methyl alcohol (metha-
nol), the polar OH group can override the effect of the nonpolar CH3 group, 
and methyl alcohol is soluble in water. In stearyl alcohol, the molecule con-
sists mostly of the long nonpolar hydrocarbon chain, so it is insoluble in 
water.   131.¬†n-hexane, 698C; pentanal, 1038C; 1-pentanol, 1378C; butanoic 
acid, 1648C.   133.¬†2-propanone; propanoic acid   135.¬†In nylon, hydrogen-
bonding interactions occur due to the presence of NiH bonds in the poly-
mer. For a given polymer chain length, there are more NiH groups in 
nylon-46 as compared to nylon-6. Hence, nylon-46 forms a stronger polymer 
compared to  nylon-6 due to the increased hydrogen-bonding interactions.

85. Divinylbenzene has two reactive double bonds that are used during for-
mation of the polymer. The key is for the double bonds to insert themselves 
into two different polymer chains. When this occurs, the two chains are 
bonded together (are crosslinked). The chains cannot move past each other 
because of the crosslinks making the polymer more rigid.   87.¬†a.¬†The poly-
mer from 1,2-diaminoethane and terephthalic acid is stronger because of the 
possibility of hydrogen bonding between chains. b.¬†The polymer of

is more rigid because the chains are stiffer due to the rigid benzene rings in 
the chains. c.¬†Polyacetylene is nHCqCH n O ( CHPCHO)n. Polyacetylene

in space of the protein‚Äôs polypeptide chain. The most common secondary 
structures are the a-helix and the pleated sheet. The a-helix secondary struc-
ture gives a protein elasticity; examples are wool, hair, and tendons. The 
pleated sheet secondary structure has hydrogen bonding interactions between 
protein chains. As several protein chains interact with each other through hy-
drogen bonding, fibers result that are very strong and are resistant to stretching. 
Examples of proteins having pleated sheet secondary structures are silk and 
muscle fibers.   99.¬†Ionic: his, lys, or arg with asp or glu; hydrogen bonding: 
ser, glu, tyr, his, arg, asn, thr, asp, gln, or lys with any amino acid; covalent: cys

pro, phe, ile, trp, met, leu, val);  dipole‚Äìdipole: tyr, thr, and ser with each other 
101. Glutamic acid has a polar R group and valine has a nonpolar R group. 
The change in polarity of the R groups could affect the tertiary structure of 
hemoglobin and  affect the ability of hemoglobin to bond to oxygen.

The two polymers differ in the substitution pattern on the benzene rings. The 
Kevlar chain is straighter, and there is more efficient hydrogen bonding be-
tween Kevlar chains than between Nomex chains.   139.¬†a.¬†The bond angles 
in the ring are about 608. VSEPR predicts bond angles close to 1098. The 
bonding electrons are much closer together than they prefer, resulting in 
strong  electron‚Äìelectron repulsions. Thus ethylene oxide is unstable (reac-
tive). b.¬†The ring opens up during polymerization and the monomers link 
together through the formation of OOC bonds.
