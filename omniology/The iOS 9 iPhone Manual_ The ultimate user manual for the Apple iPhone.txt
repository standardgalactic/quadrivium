Are you getting the most from your iPhone? Perhaps it’s capable of more than you think. 
You buy your movies and music from iTunes but do you share them with your household 
at no extra cost? You send and receive emails and messages but did you know that you can 
communicate in groups too? You set yourself reminders but did you realise that you can set 
them to trigger at certain locations as well as at certain times? The iOS 9 iPhone Manual shows 
you how to do all this and more. We take you through the initial set up, get you onto the 
Internet for web browsing and email whilst showing you how to make the most out of it as a 
telephone. There are illustrated tutorials for its built-in apps and advanced guides to its more 
obscure functions such as Handoff, Continuity and the Siri digital assistant.
The best just got better.

Introduction

iPhone Controls & 
Connections Explained
With the latest iPhones, Apple has incorporated some new tweaks to 
the configuration and layout of the external controls; and the input and 
output connections. We take a look at these changes here, with this guide 
to the iPhone, its twin cameras and its hardware features.
Press and hold to turn off your device and 
repeat to activate when the iPhone is turned 
off. Alternatively a quick tap will instantly put 
your iDevice into sleep mode, no matter 
what activity it is currently performing.
On/Off  - Sleep/Wake
Used during hands-free conversations 
and for application interaction.
Top Microphone
Used for FaceTime and other video call 
applications and software. The iPhone 6s 
and iPhone 6s Plus feature a new 5MP 
FaceTime HD front-facing camera and 
True Tone flash, which uses the display as 
a flash in low light conditions.
Front Camera
Exit any application by tapping this button 
to return to the home screen. A double-
tap enables multi-tasking, and a press 
and hold accesses Siri. The Home button 
also serves as the Touch ID on the latest 
iPhones by placing your finger here. If 
you are using the iPhone 6 Plus or 6s Plus, 
double tap the Touch ID button to shift 
the screen into the lower half. A further tap 
returns you to full screen mode.
Home
Used for speaker-driven, hands-free calls and 
general sound output.

Tap the upper button to increase the 
volume levels of your current activity, 
from call volume to gaming. Tap the lower 
button to decrease volume – in both cases 
a single tap will decrease/increase the 
volume by one increment.
Volume Up/down
Flick this switch to the down position to 
override all sound level settings and mute 
all audio output. Return to the up side to 
restore current sound preferences.
Silent
Brings a little light to your indoor or poorly 
lit photographs; alternative uses such as a 
flashlight are enabled via the Control Centre.
LED Flash
The main camera on the iPhone is used 
to capture incredibly high quality still 
photographs and 1080p full HD video. The 
new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus go even further, 
with a 12MP camera, 4k video and new 
Live Photos, snaps with a touch of motion.
Back Camera
Turn your iPhone into an iPod or use when 
you are seeking a little privacy playing 
games or watching movies etc.
Headphone Jack
Used when making standard voice calls and 
for application interaction.
Bottom Microphone
Insert the Nano-SIM card supplied 
by your network provider here.
SIM Card Tray
The latest iPhones offer stunning high 
definition screens, with Retina HD resolution. 
The largest models, the iPhone 6 Plus and 6s 
Plus, boast a 5.5-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit IPS 
screen, with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 at 401 
pixels per inch. That’s over two million pixels.
Display
The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus both 
run off Apple’s new A9 chip which is 70% 
faster at processing and 90% faster at 
graphics than the A8 processors used in 
the previous generation.
Processor
iPhone 6 Plus/6s Plus: 3.07 inches, iPhone 6/6s: 2.64 inches, 
iPhone SE: 2.31 inches

Several sizes of sim card are available for mobile phones. For your iPhone, you 
need the smallest, the Nano-SIM, seen here on the right.
Sim Cards
If you’re setting up your new iPhone straight out of the box, follow 
this guide as we take you through the extremely important first-
time setup. With our help you will soon be up and running. Follow this 
guide to learn how to set up all the core functions of your iPhone, from 
switching it on for the first time to making your first phone call.
In order to activate your iPhone, 
you must first insert the Nano-SIM 
card provided by your network provider. 
To do this, follow these steps.
Use the SIM eject tool that is 
provided with your iPhone and 
insert it into the small hole next to the 
SIM slot. The tray then pops out as shown.
Inserting Your Nano-SIM Card
Your Nano-SIM card, although very small, gives you access to the entire world! Without it your iPhone 
cannot function as a phone at all, so you need to make sure you use your Nano-SIM correctly. Here’s how.

Place the SIM card in and slide 
the tray back in the slot. Push it in 
firmly so it snaps into place. Your iPhone 
should recognise it.

Mastering the Basics with Your iPhone

The Initial Setup with Your iPhone
With the easy-to-use, PC free option, you don’t need to connect to a computer when setting up your 
new iPhone. Instead, all you need is a reliable Wi-Fi connection and to follow a few simple steps.
When you first power up your 
new device you’re greeted with 
the screen shown above, saying ‘Hello’ 
in several languages. To move on, move 
the slider bar to the right.
You’re on the Welcome screen. 
Find your choice of language, then 
tap on it to continue. On the next screen, 
find your country or region, and once 
again, tap it to proceed.
Next you’re asked to connect to a 
Wi-Fi network. You need to know 
your Wi-Fi network password. Enter it 
and tap the Join option to take your 
iPhone onto your network.
The next screen you see asks 
you to confirm if you wish to use 
location services, which is essential for 
features such as Maps. Choose your 
preferred option to proceed.
Next enter the passcode used 
to unlock your iPhone or tap 
Passcode Options to add a different type 
code or skip it altogether. We really don’t 
recommend you skip it.
You must now choose how to set 
up your iPhone. If it’s your first 
iPhone, choose the New iPhone option. 
If not you can restore from an iTunes or 
iCloud backup.

You have to agree to Apple’s Terms and Conditions before you can use your 
Apple ID on your iPhone. If you’re interested in reading them but can’t wait to 
get started, click on the Send by Email link you can see on the screen in Step 11. 
You can then have the Terms and Conditions emailed to you for later perusal.
Note on Terms and Conditions
If you decide to set it up as a new 
iPhone, you’re asked to log in 
with your Apple ID, if you have one. If 
you don’t have one, tap the ‘Don’t Have 
an Apple ID’ link to set one up.
If you choose to set up a new 
Apple ID or retrieve your details, 
you’re sent here. Follow the required 
link or tap Set Up Later in Settings if you 
don’t want to set it up now.
If you don’t have an existing 
Apple ID you’ll need to set one 
up, as it’s used to purchase apps, music 
and more; so you might as well do it 
now. Follow the on-screen commands.

Now you have your Apple ID or 
have an existing Apple ID, you can 
enter it here and tap Next to move on 
to the next step in the set up process, 
which is Terms and Conditions.
Before you can complete the set 
up and use your new iPhone, you 
need to read and then agree to Apple’s 
Terms and Conditions and tap the 
Agree link to proceed to the next step.
You’re then asked if you want 
to turn on Siri, Apple’s personal 
digital assistant. Do so if you wish; if 
you don’t, you can always do so later 
by using the option in the Settings app.

You can also use the PC Free setup installation on any compatible iOS device if 
you have previously erased all content and settings. This is via the Reset menu 
found in the General options of the Settings app.
Erasing Contents and Settings
From here you can choose to 
provide Apple with anonymous 
diagnostic and usage data. Tap Continue, 
then choose whether or not to send app 
data to developers. It’s up to you.
You’re now greeted with this 
screen, which shows your iPhone 
is set up and ready to use. Tap the Get 
Started link to proceed to the next 
screen, which is your home screen.
If you get a pop-up window like 
this as soon as you start using 
your phone, an update to iOS has been 
released. You can choose to download 
and install it by tapping Install Now.

15
If you choose to install an iOS 
update later, a second pop-up 
window invites you to install between 
2am and 4am. Leave the iPhone 
connected to a power supply overnight.
Another pop-up you might see is 
this one, inviting you to install the 
iCloud Drive app on your home screen. 
We recommend you do so, as it gives 
easy access to your iCloud data.
If you need to change any settings 
put in place initially, then do this 
in the Settings app. Siri for example, is 
found under the General link. Passcode 
and iCloud are found there too.

You have started the process of 
setting up your Apple ID. First, 
select your date of birth using the date 
wheels shown here. Then enter your 
name, email address and password.
You will need to tap Agree when 
the pop-up appears on screen. By

How to Set Up
an Apple ID
If you don’t already have a working Apple ID, you need to set one 
up before you can download applications from the App Store, 
use FaceTime, buy music and movies from iTunes and use many of the 
iPhone’s features and services. Without an Apple ID, you won’t come close 
to getting the most from your exciting Apple smartphone. 
Setting Up Your Apple ID on Your iPhone
In this guide we teach you how to set up and then use your unique and essential Apple ID, which is 
your passport to explore the amazing online world that awaits behind your iPhone’s screen.

Remember this required data is 
used to protect you, so please 
ensure that you are happy with the 
answers given and the password you 
have chosen. Maybe take a note of them. 
Next you will be faced with a very 
complex 
and 
detailed 
iTunes 
user policy document. You will need to 
consent to this before you can progress 
any further. Tap Agree at the bottom.
You 
should 
now 
enter 
your 
payment details so that you can 
make purchases from iTunes and the 
App Store. Carefully enter your payment 
details and your billing address.
You have now successfully set 
up your Apple ID and you will 
be returned to the iTunes & App Store 
Settings page. Enter the Apple ID and 
password details you previously set up. 
Having entered your details, tap 
the Sign In button located below 
your Apple ID and Password boxes, 
and you have finished setting up your 
unique identification.
To test your Apple ID is correct 
and activated, open the App 
Store, tap on any free app and 
download it using your new Apple ID. 
If it downloads, your details are correct.

Getting Started 
with Your Touch ID
Setting Up Touch ID
Setting up your Touch ID is a seemingly easy process but one that has to be performed perfectly 
before it can be activated. So please follow this guide carefully from start to finish. 
From the home screen tap the 
Settings app icon to bring up this 
menu screen; you will need to scroll down 
through the listings of options.
Having scrolled down the main 
listings of the Settings app you will 
come across the Touch ID & Passcode link. 
Tap this once.
Tap the Fingerprints link. At this 
point you can then add a new 
fingerprint or additional fingerprints for 
other users.

Your iPhone has an additional feature built into the home button, 
the Touch ID fingerprint scanner. The Touch ID will give you access 
to your iPhone, enable purchases and much more with a touch of your 
fingertip. With this guide learn that the integration of the Touch ID goes 
much deeper than your iPhone’s lock screen. 
16
BDM’s: The iOS 9 iPhone Manual
Mastering the Basics with Your iPhone

Tap Add a Fingerprint to begin the 
process of setting up your unique 
Touch ID. It’s a once only process; you 
only have to register your fingerprint once, 
unless you want to make a change later.
Place your finger on the touch 
sensor (Home button), then lift and 
replace it until it has been successfully 
scanned in and applied to the Touch ID. 
You’re told when it’s ready.
If you want to change or delete one 
or more of the fingerprints that have 
been applied to the Touch ID, tap the Edit 
link in the top right and then tap the red 
icon by the fingerprints stored below.

Using Touch ID
There is much more to the Touch ID than simply maintaining the security of your iPhone. Here we will 
look at this and the other options this fingerprint scanner offers. 
Unlocking Your iPhone
Once 
you 
have 
registered 
your 
fingerprint with the Touch ID, unlocking 
your iPhone is easy. By placing your 
fingertip on the Home button when 
your iPhone is displaying the lock screen, 
you can bypass the passcode screen and 
open your iPhone directly to the home 
screen. NOTE: After restarting your device 
you cannot gain access using the Touch 
ID, you must enter your passcode.
Making Purchases from the 
App Store on Your iPhone
Open the App Store app and browse as 
normal, and when you wish to make a 
purchase you will be required to enter your 
Apple ID username and password as per 
usual. Any further purchases or downloads 
to your iPhone can be accessed, confirmed 
and downloaded by just placing your 
finger on the Home button.
Downloading from iTunes on 
Your iPhone with Touch ID
Open the iTunes app and browse as normal, 
and when you find an item you want to 
download you will be required to enter 
your Apple ID username and password as 
per usual. Any further downloads to your 
iPhone can be accessed, confirmed and 
downloaded by just placing your finger on 
the Home button and letting the Touch ID 
do the rest.

The touchscreen is at the heart of the way you use your iPhone. There’s 
more to using a capacitive, multi-touch screen than you might at first 
think. It certainly isn’t just about tapping and dragging and if you have a 
new iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus, there’s a new ‘press’ gesture called 3D 
Touch that helps you get even more out of your iPhone and iOS 9.
Touchscreen Actions
The iPhone’s touchscreen is incredibly versatile, and it supports multitouch gestures. Here we show 
you how it’s used, and how you can interact with your phone using the screen.
Touch 
The touchscreen is sensitive to the tiny electrical charges in 
our bodies. This means you only have to tap the screen, not 
press down hard with your finger. To activate items on the 
screen such as applications and settings icons, type letters and 
symbols using the on-screen keyboard, or to press on-screen 
buttons, you simply (gently) touch them with your finger. 
Touch and Hold  
Touch and hold is useful in a number of different situations. 
You can touch and hold an item on the screen by touching it 
and not lifting your finger until an action occurs. This could be 
opening a menu, allowing you to customise the home screen 
or an icon lifting off the screen and showing that it is able to be 
moved. Here we’re moving the Health Kit app.

Drag  
One of the best things about the iPhone 
is the way you can customise the home 
screen. To drag items around the screen, 
hold an item until it wobbles and then, 
without lifting your finger, slide it across 
the screen until you reach the required 
position. Lift your finger off the screen 
and the item drops into that location (if 
it’s free). You can drag one item on top of 
another to create a folder, into which you 
can then add more items.
Swipe or Scroll 
Many of the menus or web pages that 
you can access on the iPhone require you 
to scroll. To swipe or slide, quickly move 
your finger across the surface of the 
screen, without pausing when you first 
touch it. For example, the main Photos 
app lets you slide the screen left to right 
to scroll through your pics, and in some 
Calendar views you can swipe quickly 
across the screen to change the range of 
time visible.
Double-Tap  
There are several places where a double-
tap results in an action. Tap twice quickly 
on a web page, map, or other screen to 
zoom in. You can double-tap a section 
of a web page in the browser to zoom 
that section to fit the width of the 
screen. Double-tapping after pinching to 
zoom in some applications, such as the 
browser, reflows a column of text to fit 
the width of the screen.
Pinch to Zoom 
In some applications (such as Maps, 
Safari, and Photos), you can zoom in and 
out by placing two fingers on the screen 
at once and pinching them together (to 
zoom out) or spreading them apart (to 
zoom in). This also works to zoom in and 
out in the Camera app.
Rotate the Screen 
On most iPhone apps, the screen rotates 
with the device as you turn it from 
portrait to landscape and back again. If 
you want to fix your screen so it doesn’t 
change, turn it the way you want to fix 
it and lock it using the Control Centre, as 
explained elsewhere in this book
3D Touch
The latest iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus 
models feature 3D Touch. By applying 
a little pressure to the screen you can 
preview content such as emails and web 
sites without opening them, review pics 
without leaving the Camera app and 
speed things up with Quick Actions.

Using the
iPhone’s Keyboard
Accessing the keyboard is achieved 
by simply tapping an area of the 
iPhone’s screen that requires a text input; 
for example, the Safari search bar, a note 
in the Notes app or a blank email.
Once you have accessed the 
keyboard, you can enter your text 
by simply tapping on the keys as you 
would on any similar typing device. It’s 
really easy and intuitive to use.
To add digits and punctuation 
to your text, just tap the 123 key 
located on the lower-left side of the 
keyboard. An additional tap on the key 
above will bring up more symbols. 
From opening the keyboard itself to using your voice to input your text instead of typing it, we show 
you how to unlock the excellent features the iPhone’s virtual keyboard offers.
The keyboard is second only to the touchscreen when it comes to 
your interaction with the iPhone. If you familiarise yourself with it, 
your use of the iPhone will become that much easier and quicker. This guide 
teaches you how to make the most of the keyboard and the additional 
features such as Emoticons, voice input and additional languages.

When you aren’t entering text into 
a search bar - where precise input 
is required - you will be able to access the 
Tap to Select Predictive Text option, which 
is displayed in a bar above the keyboard. 
When sending messages or emails, 
this predictive text feature will learn 
your choice of language and will suggest 
the correct word for the tone or the 
recipient of the email.
This predictive text feature will 
also recognise if you are replying 
to a “Yes” or “No” message. As before, 
simply tap to select the answer that suits 
your reply. 
Notice the Microphone icon to 
the left of the space bar. This is the 
Voice Dictation key. Tap this and simply 
speak the text you wish to enter; it will 
appear on-screen in real time. 
Additional keyboards can be 
accessed via this main keyboard 
display. Tap the Emoticon/Globe icon 
to switch between them. You can also 
(de)activate predictive text from this link.
To 
add 
third-party 
keyboards, 
download the keyboard app from 
the App Store. From Settings, go to: 
General > Keyboard > Keyboards > Add 
New Keyboard and select the app.

As its name suggests, the Control Centre 
places you in quick and easy control of 
the central functionality of the iPhone. Having 
accessed this shortcut menu, you’re one screen 
tap away from using key applications.
Accessing the
Control Centre
Using the
Control Centre
To open the Control Centre from anywhere on your iPhone, 
simply swipe from the Home button to the upper area of the 
iPhone’s screen and this menu appears, as shown here.
There are many accessories and more than a 
few applications that require access to your 
iPhone via Bluetooth. Pairing a device using a 
Bluetooth connection is a quick and easy way to 
link your iPhone to another device without the 
need for Wi-Fi or mobile data. To switch on your 
Bluetooth connection, tap this icon; as usual, to 
disable it simply repeat the process.
Bluetooth
By tapping this icon you switch on Airplane 
Mode. This mode switches off all of your 
phone’s access to incoming signals, such as 
4G, Wi-Fi etc., signals which could cause issues 
with the aircraft’s instruments while you are 
flying. To turn off Airplane mode, when you are 
back on terra firma simply open the Control 
Centre and tap this icon for a second time. 
Airplane Mode
When you’re out and about your phone will 
constantly search for nearby Wi-Fi connections, 
which places a strain on the battery, so turning 
off Wi-Fi can help to extend battery duration. 
To switch off all Wi-Fi connections to your 
iPhone simply tap this icon on the Control 
Centre; to re-activate Wi-Fi tap it once again.  
Wi-Fi
Although the Auto Brightness option that 
comes as standard with the iPhone will 
almost always find the perfect screen setting 
based upon the ambient light level, there 
may be times, particularly when you are in 
bright sunlight, when you wish to tweak the 
brightness settings yourself. Using this slider 
you can do just that. 
Brightness
The iPhone has a powerful LED flash mounted 
next to the camera on the rear of the device, 
but its uses go beyond adding some extra 
light to your photography. By opening the 
Control Centre and tapping this icon you 
will activate the flash LEDs and they will 
remain on, lighting your way should you find 
yourself in need of a little extra illumination.

The Control Centre
AirPlay lets you stream audio and video 
to your Apple TV, or just audio to an 
AirPlay-compatible speaker system or 
headphones. Wi-Fi must be switched on 
for AirPlay to work. Tap the AirPlay icon, 
then on the next screen, choose the Apple 
TV or AirPlay-compatible sound system you 
wish to stream to. Some AirPlay devices 
have to be on the same Wi-Fi network as 
the iPhone, but those that support peer-
to-peer AirPlay don’t need a network at all.
AirPlay
If you have set up your Do Not Disturb preferences, as covered 
in the tutorial elsewhere in this publication, you can instantly 
switch on this mode via the Control Centre by tapping this 
icon. Remember, if you have this mode switched on you will 
not receive calls or messages, so ensure you use this quick link 
on the Control Centre only when needed.
Do Not Disturb
There are occasions when you may want to lock your iPhone in 
either landscape (sideways) or portrait (upright) orientation. Maybe 
you prefer browsing the Internet in landscape mode, or taking a 
photograph in portrait mode, and you don’t want the iPhone to 
automatically switch to the other view. To avoid this simply tap this 
icon while holding your device in the position you wish.  
To access this app open the Control 
Centre and tap the icon and the 
application will open. If you are using 
the Calculator in portrait mode you will 
access the basic functionality, but if you 
turn your iPhone to landscape mode you 
will reveal a host of scientific options and 
controls, adding another dimension to 
an already excellent app.  
Calculator
AirDrop is a quick, easy and secure way to 
share a file with another iOS or Mac OSX 
user using your Bluetooth or networked 
connections. From the Control Centre 
you can not only activate AirDrop sharing 
but you can also customise the potential 
recipients and senders, choosing from 
either Contacts Only or Everyone, with a 
only a few swipes and taps.
AirDrop
If we were to pick one feature of the 
Control Centre we have used more than 
any other, it has to be this. With a swipe 
of the screen, followed by a single tap, you 
can instantly return to listening to your 
favourite podcast or latest iTunes purchase. 
You can also adjust the volume, or skip to 
the next track all from the Control Centre, 
which is sweet music for us all.

The countless features of the iPhone’s 
excellent camera will be covered in depth 
later in this book, so you won’t need any 
further motivation to make use of that 
particular feature. If your iPhone is showing 
the lock screen you can access the camera 
by swiping upward. When your iPhone is 
in use you can access the camera via this 
shortcut link.
Camera
We cover the Clock app and its features 
in more depth in a tutorial later in the 
book. The Control Centre offers a quick 
link to one of the most useful features of 
the Clock app, the Timer mode. By tapping 
this icon you open the application on its 
Timer setting. The uses for this mode are 
many, from boiling an egg to timing a 
journey, making it a fine inclusion.
Timer
The blue light emitted from tablets 
and smartphones can interfere with 
your natural sleep patterns. Night Shift 
reduces the amount of blue light your 
screen outputs so you don’t inhibit 
your sleep when using your phone 
late at night. You can switch it on and 
off directly from the Control Centre or 
schedule it using the Settings app.

With all the games, apps, videos, Internet browsing, email and 
photography available on your iPhone, one might be excused for 
forgetting it can also make and receive telephone calls. In this next section 
we take you through making and answering calls, and show you a few of 
the iPhone’s clever phone-related features such as placing calls on hold.
Dialling a Number from the Keypad
Tap the Phone app icon and then 
select the keypad link from the 
five options at the bottom of the screen. 
Enter the phone number by tapping 
the on-screen digits; the number will be 
displayed at the top of the screen.
If this number is important and 
will be used often, before you go 
any further click the icon with the plus 
sign to the left of the Call button to add 
the number to your contacts list. If not 
tap Call.
The call automatically connects 
when your contact answers the 
phone at their end. To end the call, tap 
the End Call button, the red one, and 
you’re returned to the keypad screen.
Even though it doesn’t have physical number buttons, it’s easy to dial a telephone number on your iPhone’s 
touch-sensitive screen interface. Here’s a guide to making and receiving telephone calls, and more.

Making a Call from Your Contacts List
To save time, add people or places that you call regularly to your Contacts list. This way, you can call 
them quickly with just a few simple taps instead of dialling the number.
Tap the Phone icon and select the 
Contacts link. Scroll up and down 
until you find the number you wish to 
dial. Alternatively, enter the name of your 
contact into the Search bar.
Once you have found the contact 
you wish to call, simply tap their 
name to be taken to their contact page. 
To dial them up, tap their phone number 
to place your call.
When 
you’ve 
finished 
your 
conversation, tap the End Call 
button, the red one with the telephone 
receiver icon, to hang up.  Alternatively, 
wait for your contact to do the same.
Receiving a call will override any 
other activity, and will continue 
to do so until the call has ended. When 
you receive a call you will either see the 
name of the contact or the number will 
be displayed. If the number is withheld, 
the word “Blocked” will appear.
To answer the call, if your iPhone 
is in sleep mode, you move the 
slider to the far right to accept the call. 
If you receive a call when you are using 
your iPhone, you have the option to 
Decline it by pressing the red button 
or accept via the green one.
Should you wish to go hands-
free for the duration of this call, 
simply press the Speaker button on 
the upper right. This will switch the 
outgoing sound to the main speakers, 
allowing you to talk without holding 
the phone in the traditional manner.
Answering a Call
When you receive a call, you have a number of options depending on whether you want to answer it or 
not. Here’s how to answer a call that’s coming in on your iPhone, again from the touchscreen.

Placing a Call on Hold
The following tutorial takes you through the two processes of placing a current or secondary incoming 
call on hold, to allow you to complete a conversation or another task.
During a call, you can place the 
caller on hold by pressing Mute, 
pausing 
the 
conversation 
without 
actually hanging up the phone. To return 
to the call, tap Mute again.
Should a second caller contact 
you when you’re already on a 
call, you have the option to Send to 
Voicemail, which immediately cuts off 
the second caller.
By selecting the Hold & Accept 
option, you place the original 
caller on hold, allowing you to answer 
the second call before returning to the 
first one.
If you find a telephone number on 
a web page in Safari, the number 
is in a button. Tap on it to place the call.
You see this confirmation request. 
Tap Call to ring the desired number 
without having to type it in.
The call is placed, just as it would 
be if you’d typed it yourself or 
tapped a number in your Contacts.
Dialling a Number from a Secondary Source
If you find a phone number on a web page or an email, it provides you with the means to instantly call 
it just by tapping on it. It’s simple, logical and incredibly user-friendly. Here’s how it works...

Mastering the Basics with Your iPhone

Placing Calls from a Message or Note
A big advantage with the fully integrated software of the iPhone is how seamlessly it works accessing 
phone numbers from notes, messages or emails and making calls directly from those apps.
Should you receive a message 
containing a phone number, you 
can place a call to it by tapping the 
highlighted, underlined number and the 
call will instantly be placed.
Should you find a note or document 
which contains a phone number, 
you can also place a call to it by tapping 
the highlighted or underlined number 
and then tapping Call.
You will now place the call in the 
same manner as you have done 
previously. Please note that you receive 
no confirmation warning when you’re 
using this method of calling.
To listen to your Voicemail, 
tap the Phone app and click 
Voicemail at the bottom of the screen. 
A call is made to your voicemail service, 
so you can listen to your messages.
If you want to passcode protect 
your voicemail messages, go to 
Settings > Phone and scroll down to 
the Change Voicemail Password link. 
You can then set a passcode.
To customise your message, tap 
the Voicemail button. If there’s a 
Greeting link on the next screen, follow 
it. If not, listen to your voice mails and 
follow the recorded instructions.
Setting Up and Using Your Voicemail Service
If someone rings when you’re not in a position to answer your phone, the call goes through to voicemail. 
Here’s how to set it up with a custom recorded message and review your messages.

You can quickly access the Do Not 
Disturb options. To do this you 
must open the Settings link from your 
home screen and then tap the Do Not 
Disturb link on this screen.
On this next screen, you can 
configure the Do Not Disturb mode. 
Here you can switch it on manually, or set 
it to activate and deactivate according to 
a schedule. 
To change the times, turn on the 
Scheduled button and then tap 
the from/to time. You can then use the 
wheels to change the Do Not Disturb 
schedule. When finished, tap to go back 
to the main app Settings.
There are times when you won’t be able to take calls, and for these times, the iPhone’s Do Not Disturb 
feature is invaluable. Here’s how to activate and use it, giving you some temporary peace and quiet.
You can activate Do Not Disturb from the main Settings screen, but 
to make the most of the feature, you need to dig a little deeper. 
The new Do Not Disturb feature of iOS allows users to block all incoming 
notifications; and to stop calls, texts and other intrusions. It’s great if you 
need some peace and quiet for a while, but don’t want to switch off.

Push Notifications
The app also lets you allow calls 
from specific groups. This means 
that you can silence calls from unknown 
callers, while allowing calls from friends, 
family or even a single specific person.
Another option is Repeated Calls. 
When activated, it lets callers 
through if they call twice in the space of 
three minutes; useful for anyone trying 
to reach you in an emergency.
When Do Not Disturb is on, a small 
moon icon appears in the status 
bar, to the left of the Bluetooth and 
Location icons. It’s significantly fainter 
though, so don’t miss it.
In Do Not Disturb mode, your 
iPhone won’t light up, ring or 
vibrate while on the lock screen but 
alarms still sound.
The iPhone will continue to receive 
the notifications, but it won’t notify 
you of them. 
To turn an app’s notifications on or 
off, go to Settings > Notifications 
and tap an item in the list.
Push notifications appear in the Notification Centre and alert you to new information, even when 
the associated app isn’t running. Notifications vary by app, but may include text or sound alerts, 
and a numbered badge on the app icon on the home screen.

The iPhone connects to the Internet automatically whenever you 
use the App Store, Mail, iTunes Store, Safari, YouTube or any other 
app that requires it. There are two ways of taking your iPhone online; via 
a Wi-Fi connection or via a 3G/4G mobile network. In this guide, we show 
you how to set up both, and also how to check your Wi-Fi signal strength. 
Joining a Wi-Fi Network
Getting onto
the Internet
To activate Wi-Fi on your iPhone 
go to Settings > Wi-Fi and turn it 
on. The iPhone then searches for all the 
networks in range. If you are at home, pick 
your home network and enter the security 
details to be allowed access.
If you are at a public hotspot 
that has no security, you can just 
connect. If it’s password protected, which 
is far more likely, you need to get the 
account details from whoever is providing 
the Wi-Fi service.
From now on whenever you 
are in range of this Wi-Fi service 
the iPhone will automatically connect, 
without any prompting. If more than one 
is in range, the iPhone will rejoin the last 
network it joined.
These days almost everyone has a Wi-Fi network. It’s easy to get your iPhone on your home network and 
also on Wi-Fi public hotspots when out and about. Here’s how to take your iPhone onto the Internet.

BDM’s: The iOS 9 iPhone Manual
Mastering the Basics with Your iPhone

Joining a Mobile 4G or 3G Network
Before you can use your iPhone on a 3G/4G network, you will need to sign up to a mobile service 
provider. Check your local retailers for price plans, data allowance and availability.
When the iPhone connects to the 
Internet using the mobile data 
network, you will see the 3G, 4G, EDGE or 
GPRS icon in the status bar at the top of 
the screen, on the left-hand side.
If you travel outside your usual 
mobile network coverage, you can 
still use the 3G or 4G functionality. To do 
this, turn Data Roaming on but be aware 
that roaming charges may apply.
You can monitor your mobile 
network data usage by going to 
Settings > Mobile Data and then scrolling 
down to Mobile Data Usage. The data 
settings vary depending on the carrier.

Using Wi-Fi Assist on Your iPhone
Introduced with iOS 9, Wi-Fi Assist automatically switches to a data connection if the Wi-Fi network it’s 
currently on is unstable or slow. Here’s how to use this feature and how to switch it off.
To switch the Wi-Fi Assist feature 
on and off on your iPhone, go to 
Settings > Mobile Data and scroll all the 
way to the bottom of the screen. It’s on by 
default but can be turned off if you wish 
to preserve your data allowance.
To avoid huge data bills, Wi-Fi 
Assist won’t switch to mobile data 
if you’re data roaming. It only works with 
apps that are currently being used and 
not in the background, and it won’t work 
with some apps that stream video.
To check the strength of your 
current Wi-Fi connection, look 
at the icon at the top of the screen. The 
more bars that are solid, as opposed to 
greyed out, the stronger the iPhone’s Wi-
Fi connection.

Your Mail app can send and receive emails from all of your email 
accounts. It’s easy to set up and use an iCloud, Gmail, Yahoo, AOL or 
Outlook account. If you want to add your Internet Service Provider’s own 
email account, it’s a little more complicated. Here, with our full guide, we 
take you through the easy way of setting up each type of email account. 
Setting Up Accounts
Tap the Settings icon and scroll 
down the panel and select Mail. 
From here tap the Add Account option. 
From this screen tap on the iCloud link 
and enter your Apple ID and Password; 
these are the details you entered when 
you first set up your iPhone. Tap Next to 
automatically verify your details.
You now see a pop-up message. 
Confirm you wish to give iCloud 
access to your location and use Find My 
iPhone. It’s best to accept them both. Find 
my iPhone is an excellent service, as we’ll 
see later, and could save you a lot of hassle 
if your phone is lost or stolen. It even 
shows you where it is on a map.
You’re then taken to this screen, 
where you can select which apps 
use the iCloud. Slide the Mail link to the 
On position. Deactivate any applications 
you don’t want to sync with iCloud (you 
can always reactivate them later), and 
then tap Save in the top right corner to 
complete the setup.
For most of the popular email services, such as Gmail, the iPhone will automatically enter most of the 
settings needed for you to access your account. That said, it is still a little complicated if you are unsure 
of how to set up an account on the iPhone, so follow these steps for each of the key providers.

Setting Up Email on 
Your iPhone
As you might expect, setting up Apple’s own iCloud email on your iPhone is simplicity itself. You need 
do little more than input your Apple ID and your password. Here’s how to do it.

BDM’s: The iOS 9 iPhone Manual
Mastering the Basics with Your iPhone

Setting Up Gmail, Yahoo, AOL and Hotmail Accounts
To access accounts from these email providers you must have already set up an active account with 
them. To do this you will need to visit their respective websites and follow the on-screen instructions.
Tap the Settings icon on your 
iPhone’s home screen; it’s the grey 
icon that looks like a cog. Scroll down 
until you see Mail, Contacts, Calendars. 
Tap this option, and on the next screen, 
tap Add Account, which is found in the 
Accounts section at the top of the screen.
From this screen, tap on either the 
Gmail, Yahoo, AOL or Microsoft 
Hotmail link (the process is the same). On 
this screen you need to enter your name, 
email address and your password for this 
account. Finally enter a description of the 
account. Click the Next link to continue. 
From this screen, you can select 
which features of your email account 
you also wish to sync with your iPhone. 
When you have made your selections, and 
are happy to continue, all you have to do 
to complete the process is tap the Save link 
and you are ready to go.
To start the process of collecting 
email on your iPhone, if your 
account is hosted with another provider 
than those listed on this screen or is 
hosted via Microsoft Exchange, you
will need to tap either the Other or the 
Microsoft Exchange link respectively.
You will have to visit the support 
website of your email provider and 
seek out their help in setting up either 
a POP or IMAP email account on your 
iPhone. As these details are all different 
for each provider, we can, alas, only send 
you in their direction for help.
Once you have obtained all the 
required information from your 
email provider, you then enter your 
details as requested and when complete 
you are ready to go. There is a lot of 
information to input here, so take care to 
do it correctly.
Setting Up Other Types of Email Account

Email on the go has revolutionised business and personal 
communication. The iPhone has a powerful and versatile email app 
that can handle multiple email addresses spread over multiple accounts 
and services, and keep track of all your contacts as well. This essential 
guide shows you how to access and manage your email account(s). 
Using the Mail Application 
Tap the Mail icon to get started. This 
brings up a list of email providers as 
shown in the screenshot here. Choose the 
relevant one. For example, if you have a 
Yahoo! email account, select Yahoo! If your 
email host isn’t displayed just tap Other to 
set up manually.
If you’re setting up a web-based 
account such as iCloud or Google 
Mail, you’re shown a screen where you can 
enter your name and/or email address and 
the password for the account in question. 
Do so and tap Sign In. Your account is set up 
and synced automatically.
To sync more email accounts go 
into Settings, select Mail, Contacts, 
Calendars and choose Add Account. 
You’ll then need to enter the name, 
address and password for the new 
account as before and it will be added to 
your list of inboxes when you open Mail.
Email is now a common part of daily life, so it’s essential you know how to make the most of Mail, 
Apple’s amazing iPhone email client. Let’s take a look at its features and functions.

Replying To or Forwarding an Email
When you receive an email you can choose to reply to it, or forward it on to somebody else. You can 
do this from your iPhone just as easily as you can from your desktop computer. Here’s how you do it...
Open your inbox and select the 
email you wish to reply to from the 
list of received mails; the newest being at 
the top. Now click the left pointing arrow 
icon at the bottom of the screen, to bring 
up the Options tab.
From here you can choose to 
Reply, Forward or Print your email.
NOTE: Forwarding an email allows you to 
resend the email to another person and 
follows the same process as detailed to 
reply to an email.
Hit Reply or Forward; the only 
difference being that forwarding 
an email will require you to add in the 
contact details of the recipient, whereas 
replying does not for obvious reasons.
Enter the text you wish to add and then hit 
the Send button to finish the process.

Tap the pen-and-paper icon to 
open a blank email. Enter an 
address manually by tapping the address 
field and typing. Mail’s auto-complete 
suggests addresses from your Contacts; 
choose one, or keep typing. Alternatively, 
tap the ‘plus’ symbol to choose an 
address from your Contacts.
The Mail icon on the home 
screen displays the total number 
of unread emails you have in a red 
circle on the app icon, as seen here. 
When you open Mail, your inboxes are 
displayed along with the number of 
unread emails in each. Select an inbox 
to open and read your emails.
When you open an email you’ll 
see several icons at the bottom of 
the screen. To move the email to a new 
location, tap the folder icon. To delete 
it tap the bin. To search for a particular 
email, click on the text field at the top 
of the screen. Enter keywords here to 
search for them.

Sending an Email
Now you are set up and ready to go with your email accounts, it’s time to send your first email. Let’s 
take a look at how to write and send an email on your iPhone, with the iOS Mail app.
Tap the Email icon on your home 
screen to open the application. 
Unless you’ve moved it, you can find it 
in the dock at the bottom of the screen.
Next tap the pencil-and-paper icon 
on the bottom right to open a new 
blank email. It’s ready for you to type the 
address to send it to, the subject and 
your message.
Enter the email address of the 
contact to whom you wish to 
send the mail in the “To:” bar at the top 
of the screen.
Enter your subject line and the 
contents of your email via the 
keyboard, and then press the Send 
button to send your email to its recipient.
A progress bar is shown at 
the bottom of the screen. This 
advances as the email is sent. When it 
reaches the right-hand side, it’s gone.
A sound confirms your email has 
been sent, and it appears in your 
Sent box, which can be accessed from the 
Accounts links on the Mailboxes page.

Quickly Delete Your Emails
It is very easy to let your email app’s mailbox get out of hand and disorganised, making it all too easy to 
misplace important emails. This simple guide shows you how to easily delete unwanted emails.
You can quickly delete emails by 
swiping left on the inbox display 
and tapping the red Delete button. 
Alternatively tap the Edit button. Tap 
each email to delete and then Trash.
 To empty your Trash box, go back 
from your Inbox to the Accounts 
page and select the Trash link. Then tap 
Edit and finally Delete All. These emails 
cannot be restored. 
If you wish to keep an email, or 
simply wish to read it at a later 
time, you can swipe to the left and tap 
the blue Mark as Read button, and the 
email will added to your listings.

The small circular arrow icon, used 
to refresh your email inbox, has now 
disappeared in iOS. It has been replaced 
by Pull to Refresh, a feature that has been 
available in other apps (such as the Twitter 
app) for a while now. To refresh, simply 
drag your finger down the email list and 
release it when the stretchy icon snaps.
Pull to
Refresh Email
Checking for 
New Mail
The Email app will automatically check 
your various email accounts for new 
messages every time you open it. You 
can also set it to automatically check at 
specified intervals. Go to the Settings 
menu, look in Mail, Contacts, Calendars, 
and set the new interval in the Fetch New 
Data option.
Text Input
via Siri
To use Siri to input your text into your 
message by simply speaking the words 
and having them automatically converted 
into text, press the small Microphone icon 
in the bottom left corner and dictate the 
message. The words appear on screen 
for you to check. When you have finished 
your message, hit the Send button.

Adding VIP Senders to Mail
Open the Email app and find a 
message from someone you want 
to make a VIP Sender. Tap their name in the 
“from” field and you will be shown more 
details about them.
As well as the familiar contact 
options, you will see a new button 
to Add to VIP. Tap this and a small star will 
appear next to their email address to show 
they have been added.
Any new emails from people added 
as a VIP will now automatically be 
kept in a new VIP mailbox. You can remove 
VIP status by clicking their name in the 
“from” field and selecting Remove VIP.
The iPhone and iOS now features a great way to automatically separate emails from important contacts 
with VIP Senders. Now you can always find those important emails when you need them!
Inserting Photos or Videos
Open the email app and tap the 
New Message icon. Write the 
message you want to send and decide 
where you want to insert the image or 
video (the process is the same for both 
photos and videos).
Touch and hold on the message 
at the point at which you want 
to insert the media. An action menu 
appears, giving you several options. 
Tap the Insert Photo or Video button as 
shown in the screenshot here.
You can also send multiple images 
by opening the Photos app and 
while viewing thumbnails, tap Edit. Select 
the photos or videos, and then tap Share. 
The size limit of attachments is determined 
by your carrier.
You can attach photos, videos or other such data files to your emails on your iPhone, and send them to 
friends, family and colleagues. The latest version of the Mail app makes it really easy to do too.

Remove or Replace the Signature from Outgoing Email
Start out by selecting Settings 
from your home screen. Select 
Mail, Contacts, Calendars from the list on 
the left side of the Settings window, and 
then tap the Signature (which by default 
will be “Sent from my iPhone”).
Use the delete button on your 
iPhone keyboard to remove the 
signature (or use the Clear button). Now 
enter your own personal signature, or 
leave the window blank to not use a 
signature at all.
Tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars in 
the left column again. Now in the 
Signature section you see your new, custom 
signature (or none at all if you didn’t use 
one). The next time you compose an email 
on your iPhone, your new, custom signature 
is used instead of the default.
By default, the Mail app adds the signature line ‘Sent from my iPhone’ to all your emails. If you’d rather 
set that to your own customised email signature, or have no signature at all, follow these instructions.
To 
search 
for 
email 
messages 
you’ve 
sent 
or received and are now 
stored on your iPhone, 
open a mailbox, scroll to 
the top, then enter the 
text for which you want 
to search in the Search 
field. You can search the 
From, To, or the Subject 
field in the mailbox that’s 
currently open. For mail 
accounts that support 
searching messages on 
the server, tap All to 
search From, To, Subject, 
and the message body.
Temporarily Stop Email
To temporarily stop using 
an email account, without 
deleting the account itself 
or erasing its details, go to 
Settings > Mail, Contacts, 
Calendars, 
choose 
an 
account and then turn 
off mail service for the 
account. When the service 
is 
turned 
off, 
iPhone 
doesn’t display or sync that 
information until you turn 
it back on again. This is a 
good way to stop receiving 
work 
email 
while 
on 
holiday, for example.

Quickly Delete Multiple Emails in iOS
It is very easy to let your mailbox get out of hand and disorganised, making it hard to find what you’re 
looking for. This simple guide shows you how to delete unwanted emails, quickly and easily.
Open your email app on your 
iPhone and have a look through 
your emails. There are probably lots 
you want to get rid of, right? To select 
and delete several at once, tap the Edit 
button at the top of the screen.
Click on any emails you want to 
delete from the list and a red tick 
will appear. When you have selected all 
the emails you want to get rid of, tap the 
Delete button at the bottom of the list.
If you are using Gmail (which 
allows the creation of folders) you 
can also choose to archive the emails by 
tapping the button to the right of Delete 
labelled Move.
Organising
Your Emails
It’s easy to be swamped with emails, which makes losing something 
important that much more likely. Chances are you’d rather delete 
the messages you don’t want to keep. The best solution is to delete these 
emails as you get them, but this can be complicated if you have several 
accounts, so deleting emails in batches is often a better alternative.

Deleting Gmail Messages
If you have set up Gmail on your iPhone, you might have noticed that there is no Delete button to be 
seen, either in the mailbox list or on the message screen. The Delete button that was seen on earlier 
versions of iOS has been replaced by an Archive button, making Gmail on iPhone more like the full 
browser-based version. If you prefer to be able to delete your unwanted messages from the iPhone 
interface, you can quickly add the Delete button back in.
From the home screen, open the 
main Settings app, and scroll down 
to the Mail, Contacts and Calendars 
option. Open it, then tap on the Gmail 
account, and tap the Account link at the 
top of the screen. Tap Advanced, and 
under Move Discarded Messages To, tap 
Delete Mailbox.
You can also delete emails by 
swiping right on the inbox 
display and tapping the red Delete 
button. Finally to empty your Trash 
box, go back from your Inbox to the 
Accounts page and select the Trash 
link, then tap Edit and then finally 
Delete All.
When you go back into Gmail 
and tap Edit, you will see the 
Archive button has been replaced by 
a Delete button. By marking emails 
and tapping the Delete button you 
will completely remove your email 
from your inbox to your trash box, not 
your archive.
To speed up the delete process, 
open the main Settings app and 
then Mail, Contacts, Calendars. Turn off the 
option labelled Ask Before Deleting.
You can also delete emails, albeit 
singularly, by swiping right on 
the inbox display and tapping the red 
Delete button.
Finally to empty your Trash box, 
go back from your Inbox to the 
Accounts page and select the Trash link, 
then tap Edit and then finally Delete All.

There are lots of iPhone web browsers available for download in 
the App Store, but the one that comes pre-installed on your device 
is Apple’s own Safari, and it’s all that most people ever need. If you’ve used 
Safari before, you’re sure to feel at home right away. But if this is your first 
time going online with the Safari browser, we’re here to guide you. 
Using the Safari App
Safari is Apple’s very own web browser. The iPhone version should prove immediately familiar if 
you’ve used it on a Mac, but if you’re new to Safari, here’s a quick run-through of its basics.
As it is one of the key functions of 
your iPhone, you will want to keep 
the Safari application on your main home 
screen or as one of the apps on the dock. 
To open the Safari application, simply tap 
the Safari icon on the home screen.
To enter a web address manually, 
tap the text field at the top of the 
screen to bring up the keyboard and 
then type in the address. It is better to 
use the iPhone in the horizontal position 
for this. Hit Go when you’re done.
You can also search Google, your 
Bookmarks and Internet history 
by scrolling down to the links displayed 
below the Top Hit. The Google links are 
shown by a small icon.

one time. Simply tap the icon on the 
bottom right of the screen, then tap the

brings up the keyboard. If you’re filling in 
a text field and need to refer back to the 
web page, tap anywhere outside of the 
keyboard to hide it.
You 
can 
set 
Safari 
up 
to 
automatically fill in online forms, 
saving you time when signing up with 
websites. Go to Settings, select Safari 
and turn on Autofill. Turn on the option

Using the Reading List
If you stumble on something but haven’t time to read it, there’s an easy way of saving it for later. Safari’s 
Reading List feature lets you save a web page and come back to it and read it later.
Open the Safari application and 
browse the Internet as normal, 
until an interesting article or a striking 
image catches your eye.
When you find something of 
interest, tap the up-pointing arrow 
icon on the bottom bar to bring up the 
sharing options.
From this menu tap the Add to 
Reading List option and the page 
will be saved for later perusal.
To access your reading list tap the 
Bookmark icon (the open book), 
and from the screen shown here, tap the 
Glasses icon at the top.
From this link you will see the listings 
of all sites you have added to the list, 
offering an icon and few lines of content 
description to tweak your memory.
Click one and you will be taken 
directly to the page in question. 
It’s a great way of saving pages for 
later reading.

Using Safari’s Private Browsing Mode
Sometimes, you might want to browse the Internet without having the sites you visited recorded in 
your browsing history. Doing so is easy with the iPhone’s Private Browsing Mode.
Activating 
Private 
Browsing 
Mode is easy. First, tap the icon 
that looks like two pages, one on top 
of another, in the bottom right corner. 
Now tap the Private link in the bottom 
left, as shown here.
When in Private Browsing Mode 
Safari looks black, as shown above. 
In this mode Safari won’t remember the 
pages you visit, your search history or 
your AutoFill information. It’s all private.
To get out of Private Browsing 
Mode, tap the icon showing two 
pages again and then tap the Private 
button, as shown in the screenshot 
above. Normal browsing is resumed 
once more.

Messages gives you instant group chatting, picture and file sharing 
and more. It will change the way you communicate with friends and 
family. It’s easy to stay in touch using Messages, and chatting between iOS 
devices is also completely free. With the many features on offer, you will 
want to learn how to get the most from this key part of your iPhone. 
Using Messages Made Easy
The first thing you’ll need to do is 
make sure Messages is turned on. 
To do this tap the Settings icon on your 
iPhone’s home screen. Select Messages 
from the list that appears. You may have 
to scroll down to find it.
On the Messages settings screen 
you’ll see an On/Off switch. Slide 
it to the On position to enable iMessage. 
Wait a few moments as iMessage 
initialises. A message should appear to let 
you know it’s in the process of activating.
After activating iMessages you can 
configure user options. Activate 
Send as SMS. By activating the Filter 
Unknown Senders option, all messages 
from people not in your Contacts go into 
a separate folder in Messages.
Over these steps we take you through the process of using the extremely helpful message functionality 
on your iPhone. It’s great for keeping in touch with friends, family and colleagues.

Text Message Forwarding lets you 
send and receive text messages on 
your other Apple devices, assuming they 
meet the system requirements. Tap on 
it for a list of your Macs and iOS gear. To 
activate one, flick the switch. A number 
is shown on the device, which you must 
input on your iPhone.
Read Receipts are notifications 
sent out by your device to your 
contacts to let them know when you’ve 
read messages they’ve sent to you in 
Messages. You may not want people 
to know immediately that you’ve read 
their message but thankfully Apple has 
included the option to turn them off.
Send As SMS enables you to send 
an iMessage via SMS without the 
need for an active Wi-Fi or 3G connection. 
iMessage needs a Wi-Fi or 3G connection 
to work but if none is available, switching 
on Send As SMS enables Messages to 
send an iMessage via your phone service 
provider as a text message.
Send & Receive is where you set up 
how you receive your iMessages. 
When using an iPhone your phone 
number is set as your Receive At address. 
There are more options, including 
adding email addresses for people with 
multiple devices running Messages.
To add an email address you need 
to have an Apple ID. When you 
attempt to add a new email address 
you’ll be prompted to enter this, then 
the email address you want to add to 
iMessage. Once verified, the address 
becomes active.
Now we’ve set up, let’s send a 
message. Go back to the home 
screen, and open Messages. To send a 
new message, tap the pencil and paper 
button at the top right of the screen. This 
brings up the New Message screen, as 
shown here.

In the To field you need to type 
the number or email address of 
the person you want to message. If the 
number or address isn’t registered for 
iMessage the contact will turn green, 
which means that the message will be 
sent as a text message. 
When you enter the details of a 
contact who’s using iMessage, 
the text field shows ‘iMessage’, showing 
you that your message is being sent via 
iMessage and is therefore sent via the 
Internet for free. Type in your message 
and when you’re done and then tap Send.
The delivery status icon lets you 
know when your message has 
been sent. If the recipient of the message 
has Read Receipts turned on then this 
changes to Read once they’ve looked at 
the message. If iMessage was used the 
speech bubbles are blue instead of green.
You can see when the other 
person is typing (not their reply to 
you, but that they’re using the keyboard), 
as three dots in a speech bubble appear 
in the bottom left of the message field.
You can add photos to your 
iMessage by tapping the Camera 
icon to the left of the message text field. 
NOTE: A larger image will take long to 
upload and download, so be mindful.
You can add multiple recipients. 
When 
group 
messaging, 
the 
name of the sender appears above each 
message so you can easily keep track of 
who said what.

If you receive a message when 
your iPhone is in sleep mode it will 
appear as a standard iOS notification. 
Just tap on the message notification to 
go straight to the conversation screen 
and reply.
You can also reply directly to 
any missed messages using the 
Notification Centre. Simply pull down 
on the home screen and check the 
Notification Centre for messages; to reply 
tap the message. 
One last thing that is easy to 
overlook but could hold back 
your use of iMessage, is making sure 
iMessage is activated on compatible 
devices you and your contacts are using. 
Make sure you do this to get the most 
out of iMessage.

Sharing Your Location Using iMessage
How often have you received a message from a friend or partner asking you where you are, or for 
directions on how to get there? Apple have added a neat shortcut to iMessage for just these moments.
After receiving a message, or while 
preparing one to send, tap the 
Details button in the top right corner; 
then tap Share My Current Location and 
select one of the three options. 
If you want to send the location 
of a specific place, tap the Details 
button in the top right corner and then 
tap Share My Location to send a Map link 
to your contact. 
If you receive a Maps location link 
or wish to check the location of 
one you have previously sent, simply tap 
on the Sent/Received link to open it in 
Maps. For directions tap the link below. 
Open a standard iMessage, fill in the 
names of the recipient(s) and then 
tap the Camera icon. As well as the standard 
attachment options you can also select 
from a collection of your latest photos. 
Select the photos by scrolling 
through them and tapping any 
you wish to send. They’re ticked in the 
bottom right corner. When you are ready, 
tap the Send Photo button to finish. 
You 
can 
also 
view 
all 
sent 
videos and images from a single 
conversation by selecting the Details link 
and scrolling through the options to the 
Attachments link at the bottom. 
Send Multiple Photos and Videos at Once
With Messages, you can send more than one photograph or video attached to a single text message. You can 
also review all the images and videos sent during a conversation, all in one place. This guide shows you how.

Capturing Still Photographs and Video Explained
To start, tap the Camera Icon. To 
flip between the front and back 
cameras, tap the camera icon (top 
right). To switch between video and 
stills, use the slider under the image; 
moving between Time-lapse, Slo-mo, 
Video, Photo, Square and Pano.
With the regular camera, you 
can zoom using two fingers; 
spread to zoom in and pinch together 
to zoom out. To take a photo, tap the 
large white button. Press and hold it to 
use Burst Mode, which takes multiple 
images per second.
A preview of the last photo or video 
you took is displayed at the bottom 
left of the screen. Tap it to see how it came 
out and delete it if it’s not to your liking. 
To return to the regular camera view and 
take some more snaps, tap Done.
The iPhone has two great built-in cameras. In this guide we take you through the basic uses of these 
amazing cameras, from taking photographs and video clips to adding realtime effects and other features.

To record a video, set the slider to 
Video. Tap the red button to start 
recording. While recording, tap the white 
button to take a still photo. Tap the red 
button, now a square, to stop recording.
You can also shoot in Slo-mo (slow 
motion). To record your video 
repeat the same process; when viewing 
the video you can edit the slo-mo section 
using the slider at the top of the screen.
The final option available when 
scrolling to the left is the Time-
lapse feature. Tap the shutter and you 
will take frame-long videos at set time 
intervals. This shows the passing of time.
The Square option gives you a 
square-shaped photo. It’s ideally 
suited for taking a single image that will 
be used as an ID photo for a passport, 
driving licence or a web avatar.
The Pano option describes the 
panoramic camera feature. By 
pressing the shutter and moving the 
iPhone along the on-screen marker, you 
can take an amazing horizontal image.
Notice your flash and HDR options 
to the top left of the screen. You 
can choose to set them to either Auto, 
On or Off. If set to On or Auto, an icon will 
appear above the shutter.

The New Live Photos Feature
If you have a new iPhone 6s, 6s Plus or an iPhone SE, there’s a great new feature in the Camera app. It’s 
called Live Photos and it captures a small amount of video and sound with your picture.
A Live Photo is a still image with 
a difference. As well as a regular 
12-megapixel photo, the Live Photos 
feature (which is only available on the 
iPhone SE, 6s or 6s Plus) captures a few 
seconds of video and sound, from before 
and after the still is taken.
To use Live Photos, turn the slider 
below the image to Photo, then 
tap the concentric circles icon in the 
centre of the top bar. Live Photos is now 
on. Tap the shutter button as usual to 
take your photo. Tapping the Live Photos 
icon again turns it off.
When looking at your Live Photos, 
touch any part of the picture and 
it comes alive, showing you the few 
seconds of video captured either side 
of the still image. It works like this if you 
use your Live Photo as a lock screen 
picture too.

Using the iCloud Photo Library
The best feature of the iCloud Photo Library is that once it has been activated you don’t have to actually 
do anything to use it; whatever you do within the Photos app will be mirrored in the iCloud. 
If you choose to reorganise or 
rename your Photo Albums, the 
next time you connect to the iCloud 
these changes will be automatically 
made to your Photo Library too. 
Edit any of your images and 
these edits will be applied to your 
iCloud Photo Library; these edits can also 
be removed from their iCloud-based 
versions too. 
If you accidentally delete one or 
more files from your iPhone, these 
images will remain on the iCloud Photo 
Library, where they can be restored to 
your iPhone.

Restoring Deleted Photography
Alas, we have forgotten how many times we have accidentally deleted photos from our iPhones so that 
they are lost forever. Thankfully you can restore deleted files for a limited 30-day time period.  
If you have searched your Photo app 
for the image(s) in question and you 
can’t find them, or if you simply tapped 
the wrong button and deleted them by 
mistake, don’t panic. 
Tap the Albums link at the bottom 
of the screen and scroll down to the 
bottom of the listings to find the Recently 
Deleted album. Tap the icon to open this 
folder and explore the contents. 
Find the file you want and tap the 
Select button in the top right; tap 
the image/video and then tap and confirm 
the Recover link in the lower left corner. 
The file will be returned to the main app.

Editing Techniques Made Easy
Apple has equipped the latest version of iOS with a photo editing suite, found directly within the 
Photos app. Here’s how to get the most from it, and really bring your photo to life.
Open the Photos App and select 
the image you wish to edit from 
the Camera Roll. To bring up the key 
editing tools, press the Edit button in the 
top right corner.
If an image can’t be edited, you’re 
given the chance to duplicate 
it and edit the copy, as shown here. 
Simply tap the ‘Duplicate and Edit’ link 
to proceed.
The top right icon is Auto Enhance 
and sets the levels for you. The top 
left icon removes red-eye. Tap it, then tap 
the red eye and the problem is solved.
The first icon on the bottom bar is 
the crop tool, which enables you 
to resize and reposition the composition 
of an image. By using the dial below 
the image  you can rotate the photo. 
Alternatively you can rotate it, or resize it, 
by using the options to the left and right 
of the Reset button. 
The rotation tool to the left 
will rotate your selected image 
through four 90 degree motions. The 
second option enables you to quickly 
resize the image  by selecting one of a 
selection of dimensions. You can also 
move the image independently to focus 
on the subject. 
The icon with the three merging 
circles in the bottom centre of the 
screen enables you to add a colour filter 
to your choice of image. To apply any of 
these preset filters simply scroll through 
them and tap the one you wish to use 
and it will be automatically applied to 
your image. To finish tap Done.

The 
final 
icon, 
the 
Smart 
Adjustment tool, offers you a series 
of options to tweak the Light, Colour and 
Black & White aspects of your images. 
Select the area you wish to adjust from 
the three main options, by tapping the 
arrow icon located to the right of each of 
the three options. 
You will now be given a series of 
options which are used to adjust 
key parts of each of the three customised 
areas. Although these options will have 
very different results, the way these 
adjustments are changed is the same. 
Using the slider, manually adjust the 
image to your preference. 
All of the changes that have 
been made to an image can be 
undone. The image can be returned to 
its original form by tapping the Revert 
button which is located at the bottom 
right corner. Once you are sure you wish 
to undo your adjustments, confirm via 
the pop-up option.

Using the
Notes App
The new-look Notes takes the iPhone’s note-taking app to a whole 
new level. With more features than ever before, Notes is becoming 
as versatile as it is convenient. It lets you use your iPhone as a notebook, 
and sync your notes using iCloud, so you can write a note on your iPad 
or Mac, and have it in your pocket on your iPhone when you’re out.
The Notes App – The Basics
When you first open the Notes 
app, you’re greeted with a list of 
previously-saved notes. If you haven’t 
made any yet, this list will, of course, be 
empty. To create a new note, first tap 
the New button in the top right corner 
of the screen.
Tap on your new note and the 
iPhone’s virtual keyboard comes 
into view. You can now type the note. 
When finished, press Done to hide the 
keyboard and show some controls. Tap 
Back to return to the list; your new note 
is saved, with its first line as the subject.
To delete a note when in the list 
view, swipe it left and tap the 
Delete button that’s revealed. To delete 
an open note, tap the dustbin icon at the 
bottom of the screen, which is shown 
when the keyboard is not in view, then 
tap the Delete Note link that pops up.
Notes is is a very handy application as it’s always to hand whenever you’ve got your iPhone with you. 
Here’s a quick run-through of the basics, such as opening and deleting notes and making new ones.

To add a photo, tap and hold the 
place in the note where you want 
the picture to appear. When you lift your 
finger, a pop-up menu is shown. Select 
Insert Photo and choose a pic from your 
Photos app. The photo appears where 
you held your finger.
Highlight a word by double-
tapping it. Drag the handles at 
either end to select a larger section of 
text if you wish. A pop-up menu appears, 
giving you the chance to cut, copy or 
paste your selection. Tap the respective 
links to edit your text in this way.
From the pop-up menu covered 
in Step 5, tap the triangle on the 
right for more options. You can replace 
the selection with text you’ve previously 
cut, define the word using the iPhone’s 
dictionary or tap the ‘BIU’ link to make 
the text bold, italic or underlined. 
To search your notes, on the list 
screen, drag down to expose the 
search field at the top of the screen. Type 
what it is you’re looking for, and every 
note that contains that word or phrase is 
shown. Tap the X icon to the right of the 
search bar to clear the search field.
Tap the Folders button in the top 
left corner for a list of the folders in 
which your notes are stored. If you want 
to sync notes via iCloud, they have to be 
in the iCloud section. This is divided into 
Notes, Personal and Work, so you can 
separate them if you wish.
You can share a note using the 
Share button. Just open the note 
you wish to share, tap the Share icon 
in the top right corner of the screen 
and choose a sharing option, such as 
Message, Email or AirDrop. You can print 
or copy it from this menu too.

advanced editing techniques, text styles and even adding pictures to your notes.

Other formatting options include 
turning the highlighted text into 
a title, heading, a bulleted list, a dashed 
list or a numbered list. You can combine 
these options with the bold, underline 
and italic buttons; here we’ve made a 
bold, underlined title.
Tap on the Camera icon and, 
unsurprisingly, you get the chance 
to add a photograph or video to your 
note. You can pick a picture from your 
existing photo library, or you can tap Take 
a Photo or Video to use the camera, taking 
pictures directly from the Notes app.
The squiggly line icon gives access 
to the sketch facility. It’s hardly an 
in-depth art app, but you can choose to 
draw with a virtual pen, pencil or marker, 
rub out or undo, draw a straight line with 
a virtual ruler and choose between eight 
colours to use.
Tap the plus sign in a circle, found 
above the keyboard on the right, 
and new feature icons are shown. Tapping 
the ‘X’ icon in the right-hand side of the 
screen, found where the plus icon was 
before, closes this features bar once more.
To create a checklist, type the list 
then select its text. It doesn’t have 
to be the entire note; you can leave a 
headline or make a list within a note. Tap 
the circle with a tick icon. The selected text 
is turned into a checklist. Tap a circle and 
a tick is added.
Highlight a piece of text and tap 
the next icon; the one showing 
the capital and lower-case letter ‘A’, and 
you’re shown formatting options. At the 
foot of these options there are icons for 
bold, italics and underlining; previously 
only available from a press-and-hold 
menu.
New Notes Features
The new features added to Notes with iOS 9 greatly increase the scope of the popular note-taking 
app. Naturally, you can still sync it over iCloud too. Let’s take a look at these exciting new features.

You can share directly to Notes 
from other apps. For example 
in the Safari app, to share a link to a 
website: tap the Share button, choose 
Add to Notes from the pop-up menu and 
a new window lets you add it to a new 
or existing note. Tap Choose Note and 
navigate to the note to which you wish 
to add the link. To create a new note just 
tap Save, as this is the default option.
Syncing Notes via iCloud
You can sync your notes using your iCloud account, so the same note appears on all your Apple devices, 
and stays up to date with your edits too. Locked, password-protected notes are also locked on all devices.
All devices you want to sync 
your notes with must be logged 
into the same iCloud account. On your 
iPhone, go to Settings > iCloud to log in. 
On a Mac, open System Preferences from 
the Apple menu, and click on iCloud. 
Sign in on each, and make sure Notes is 
checked for syncing.
To be synced, a note must be in 
the iCloud folder in your Notes 
app. If it isn’t, on the page that lists your 
notes, swipe it to the left and then tap 
Move. Move it to your iCloud folder on 
the next screen. If you go to Settings > 
Notes, you can make iCloud the default 
starting place for notes created with Siri.
To use the new iOS 9 features 
with your existing notes, you must 
upgrade them. The link is on the Folders 
screen in Notes. Once upgraded, you can 
only use those notes on iOS 9 devices and 
Macs running El Capitan, so make sure 
you’re not running iOS 8 or Yosemite on 
a device you want to sync.

Password-Protecting Notes
You can now password-protect a note, so it can only be opened and 
read with the correct passcode or with your Touch ID.
To set up password protection, go 
to Settings > Notes > Password 
and set up a password. Flick the switch 
to enable Touch ID if you wish to open 
a locked note using your fingerprint but 
you need to set up a password as well. 
You can also set a hint to remind you if 
you forget your password or reset your 
password completely; tap the link and 
then enter your Apple ID when instructed.
To password-protect a note, open 
the note you want to protect and 
tap the Sharing icon. From the pop-up 
window tap Lock Note. You must then 
enter the password you chose in Step 1. 
The note is now locked and can only be 
opened with your password or Touch ID. 
To remove a lock, open the note and use 
the Sharing icon again; the Lock Note icon 
now says Remove Lock.

Getting Rid of Duplicate Entries in Your Contacts List
You can ‘unify’ contacts that appear 
multiple times in your synced 
accounts by opening one of their profiles 
and tapping the Edit button. 
Now scroll to the bottom of the 
screen and tap the Link Contact 
option. Then choose the contact you

Prioritising People that You Contact the Most
If you have a lot of contacts in your iPhone, you might want to put your most regular contacts in a 
single place. This is especially true if you use your smartphone for professional as well as personal calls.
You can create a favourites list for 
all your contacts. Just open their 
contact details and tap Favourites.
Now add this contact to your Voice 
Call or FaceTime favourites (or 
both) by selecting from these options.
You can now quickly access these 
contacts as you wish from the 
favourites list. 
There may be occasions when you find you have the same individual appearing in various guises on 
your Contacts list. This is how you can end this minor annoyance and unify the duplicated contacts.

If you don’t want people contacting you unexpectedly, you can go into the Settings menu and then from this location 
you turn FaceTime off by switching the slider to the Off position.
FaceTime is for real-time video and audio calling. You can 
communicate face to face with anyone else who has FaceTime 
installed on their computer or device. It’s especially good for keeping in 
touch with friends and family who you don’t see very often, and it won’t 
eat into your credit or monthly minute allowance. Here’s how to use it.
You can add contacts to your

number or an email address. You can stay 
signed in and available to take FaceTime 
calls at all times.
Now select the contact from 
your listings and press the 
FaceTime camera link displayed beside 
their number to place a video call. You 
select the FaceTime phone icon to 
place an audio-only call. 
You may have to wait a moment

in the small window, while your contact 
appears in full screen. To end the call 
simply hit the large End button.
FaceTime System Requirements
To use FaceTime you need an Apple ID, an Internet connection and a contact who also has FaceTime 
enabled on a Mac, iPhone, iPod or iPad. Macs must, of course, have a webcam built-in or external.

Do you scribble long lists of things you need to do on pieces of 
paper, then lose them? If so, this iPhone app could be just what 
you need. With Reminders, you can maintain lists of important jobs and 
tasks and sync your reminders using iCloud, organise your reminders into 
separate lists, mark jobs as completed and even re-use completed tasks.
Reminders Application Explained
Open the application and click to 
the Lists view via the link at the top 
of the screen. From here you can add a 
reminder by clicking the Reminders for 
the same day by pressing the “+” icon. To 
change the priority of the task or edit the 
details, tap the arrow to the right of it.
If you need to set a reminder for 
a future date – birthdays, events, 
etc. – you can scroll through each day 
in turn using the scrolling date dial in 
the lower area of the screen. When you 
find the correct date, tap the screen to 
set that date with the current reminder. 
To view all of your reminders in 
one listing, tap the Alarm Clock 
icon in the top right corner of the home 
screen. To view all of the items in the list, 
simply scroll up and down through the 
list and tap any one of them to open it for 
a closer look, or to edit it.
Using this app is easy when you know how. You will find yourself using this more and more as you get 
a tighter grip on your routine. You need never forget to complete an important task again.

Searching Completed Tasks
On occasion, you might need to search through tasks you’ve already completed, perhaps to reuse a 
reminder or to check a detail. Thankfully it’s really easy to do, using the Reminders app’s search field.
To search for previously entered 
reminders from this application 
tap the search bar at the top of the 
main Reminders home screen.
You will now bring up the Search 
option. Enter your text here via 
the keyboard and the results will be 
yours in seconds.
Open the Reminders app and 
select the Show Completed link at 
the bottom of the page to reveal all the 
reminders you’ve previously used.
Tap the Edit option at the top right 
of the screen, then tap the red icon 
beside the reminder you wish to re-use. 
Finally tap the More option. 
Another fantastic addition to the functionality of this application is the ability to re-use already completed 
reminders from your listings. It’s great for jobs you need to do more than once.

Create Geotagged 
Reminders
As well as giving you alerts at a certain time, the Reminders app also 
lets you create entries that are GPS location-based (or Geotagged), 
sounding the notification alarm when you reach a certain place, such as 
the local shop or a train station. Just the thing if you need to remind 
yourself to grab a bottle of milk as you pass a shop.
First, you need to create the 
reminder. Open the Reminders 
app and tap the + button to start a new 
entry. For this example we’ll continue 
with the “Buy Milk” theme. Type a title 
for the reminder and tap Return.
Before you go any further, you need 
to make sure that the location at 
which you wish to trigger the alert is in 
your Contacts list. This is achieved by first 
finding it using your Maps app. Do so now.
Open the Maps app and search 
for the location you want. When 
found, it will show on the location with a 
pin and a title. Tap the arrow next to the 
title and select Add to Contacts from the 
next screen. 
Creating Location-Based Reminders
With location-based reminders, you need never forget to pick up the milk or renew your season ticket 
again. Now as you walk near your local store or train station, your iPhone reminds you of your task.
1

BDM’s: The iOS 9 iPhone Manual
With the location added to your 
Contacts, you can close the Maps 
app and return to the Reminders app. 
Tap the ‘i’ button next to the reminder to 
view its details. Switch on Remind me at 
a Location as shown here, then tap the 
Location link below.
If you’re going to use a location-
based reminder, you must allow 
the Reminders app access to your 
current location as suggested here. 
How else will it know when you’ve 
reached the location that triggers the 
reminder? Tap Allow to proceed.
Tap the address at which you 
wish to trigger the reminder. It 
will be listed here, as you added it to 
your Contacts book at the beginning of 
this tutorial. You can also choose to be 
reminded when you arrive at or when 
you leave the location in question.
Here we’re creating a reminder 
for when we reach a shop, so we 
want the reminder alert to sound when 
arrive at the store in question. Tap When 
I Arrive to select that option. Click Done 
to return to the details screen and Done 
again to  finish setting the reminder.
If you want to further edit your 
reminder, go to the list, tap the 
reminder in question and then tap the 
‘i’ icon that appears to the right of the 
its title. Alternatively, slide the reminder 
to the left until you see the Delete and 
More options and then tap More.
Saving Locations
To save time when setting geotagged 
reminders, add your most commonly 
visited 
locations 
to 
your 
Contacts 
when you have a few minutes spare. 
Places such as your office, the gym, the 
supermarket you pass on your way home 
from work and the local petrol station. If 
you think you will be using Reminders a 
lot, it is also a good idea to make sure that 
the details of your friends and family in 
Contacts include their home addresses.

Apple’s Maps app boasts navigation tools that rival any GPS route 
planner. In this guide we take you through the Maps app, and show 
you an easier way to get to where you are going. We also show you its 
interesting and informative 3D perspectives, its advanced route finding 
features and how to find nearby services using the Maps app.
Finding Places With Maps
Open the Maps app. To find your 
current location tap the the button 
with an arrow in it at the bottom left of 
the screen. To determine the direction 
you’re facing, tap the arrow button at the 
bottom left a second time.
To search for a specific location, 
type the address, postcode or road 
name into the search field at the top 
of the screen. If there’s more than one 
match you’re shown a list. Finally tap on 
the correct result.
To get more information on a 
selected location, tap the blue 
button next to its name. From the pop-
up box, you can get directions, bookmark 
it or assign it to a contact. To change the 
view, tap the bottom right icon.
You can use the Maps app to find addresses, businesses, landmarks and much more. It’s great for 
finding your way around a strange town, whether on holiday or on a business trip.

By tapping the ‘i’ icon, you can 
then choose from Standard or 
Satellite, which displays a photographic 
map, or Hybrid, which displays the 
photographic map with street and town 
names overlaid onto it.
You can search for a business by 
entering the business name or 
for example type ‘hairdressers’ into the 
search field at the top of the screen. Pins 
then appear on the map indicating all 
matching businesses in the area.
For directions and contact numbers 
for each business, tap the blue 
information button next to the pin. Zoom 
in and out at any time by pinching the 
screen. To move around the maps, drag 
with your finger in any direction.
Before you can properly view the 
maps in 3D, you need to switch 
to Satellite view. Tap the “i” icon in the 
bottom corner of the map and select 
your view preference. If you want to hide 
the street names, tap Hide Labels too.
To now switch to 3D view, tap 
the 3D Map link, which is the 
third option here. You might notice the 
camera angle shifts when you do this, 
but if you’re zoomed out, you hardly 
notice any difference.
Zoom in to the map and you will 
start to see contours, hills and 
valleys rendered before your very eyes. 
The 3D feature can slow things down 
if you are using a slow WiFi or 3G/4G 
connection, but not by much.
Viewing Maps in 3D
It might seem the least useful of the many Maps features, but 3D maps are certainly great to look at. 
Here’s a guide to adding that elusive third dimension to your street views.
3D Buildings
The 3D feature of the new Maps app really comes alive when you are viewing a big 
city such as London or New York. When you are viewing a city, you can actually see 
buildings rising out of the map. You can zoom around Big Ben or fly up the side of 
the Empire State Building. It is probably impossible to extend this amazing feature 
to every building you can see, but it would be a pretty impressive thing!

Route Planning and Navigation
The route planning element of Maps is one of the most useful features of the app. With it you can plan 
your journey from your current location to your destination, whether walking or driving.
To 
get 
directions, 
tap 
the 
Directions 
button 
and 
enter 
your destination. Select your mode of 
transport too. You can also select any 
location currently pinned, tap the blue 
button next to the name and select 
directions to or directions from.
Maps calculates the best route 
and displays it as a blue line. 
Distance and travel time is shown at the 
top of the screen. If there are alternative 
routes available, these are displayed as 
lighter blue lines. These are certainly 
worth trying.
Switch 
between 
routes 
by 
tapping one of the light blue 
routes to select it. Distance and travel 
times update. You can view a step-
by-step breakdown of the route by 
tapping the small three line icon at the 
bottom of the screen.
When you’re happy with your 
route, tap Start at the foot of the 
screen. The map zooms in at the start of 
your route and a large motorway style 
sign appears at the top. These show the 
distance to the next point of interest.
You can zoom in on the map 
at any time. Simply double-tap 
anywhere along the route line. To zoom 
back out, you need to use the pinch-
to-zoom method. To turn off spoken 
instructions mute the phone.
You can access an overview of 
the route by tapping Overview 
at the top right. Here you can see a 
written list of directions by tapping the 
list icon in the bottom left corner. You 
can also scroll through the entire trip.

Transport Mode 
The new Transport feature in Maps is great for users of public transport. Although it’s currently only 
available in select cities, it can help you travel by train, bus and even ferry.
To access the public transport map, 
tap the ‘i’ icon (bottom right). Tap 
Transport at the top of this pop-up box for 
local public transport options. Tap on the 
name of a train or subway station and a 
pop-up showing its name appears.
Tap on this for a list of forthcoming 
departures from that station. You 
can plan a journey on more than one 
method of public transport, including 
buses (including short walks between 
stops), trains and ferries. First enter your 
start and end locations as usual.
Tap the estimated time at the 
bottom of the screen and a route 
using public transport is presented as 
shown. You can tap Start and get step-
by-step instructions on getting from A 
to B, as you would walking or making a 
road journey.
Buildings such as subway stations 
have been surveyed, so Maps 
shows all the entrances and exits to that 
station. The way you search for nearby 
services in Maps has also had a revamp, 
and is now offered in search categories.
Tap one of the search icons and 
it sub-divides into more specific 
categories. When you’ve found the store 
or service provider you want, tap on it for 
more information. The new Maps services 
are incorporated into Siri too.
The new Transport service isn’t 
available everywhere yet but when 
iOS 9 launched, cities like London, San 
Francisco, New York, Berlin, Toronto and 
around 300 cities in China were already 
covered. More will follow.

With the iPhone’s Calendar software you need never miss an 
appointment again. In fact you can organise your entire life. You can 
create, edit and delete events, search for specific events and sync up with 
other calendar software from your computer. You can also set event alerts, 
sounding an alarm at a pre-set time before a meeting or appointment.
Exploring the Calendar App
Tap the Calendar icon from the 
iPhone’s home screen and this 
will open the Calendar app. Tap the 
Calendars button to see a selectable 
listing which features all your synced 
calendars. You will also find all the key 
options when it comes to appointments 
and any invites to other iOS users, which 
we will cover later in this guide.  
To turn different calendars on and 
off just tap on them. Active calendars 
have a tick next to them. Tap Done at any 
time to enter the main calendar view 
where you’ll find events from all active 
calendars displayed. You can go back and 
activate or deactivate calendars at any time 
by tapping the Calendars button to the top 
left of the screen.
To add an event tap the plus 
symbol to the top right of the 
screen. Enter a title and location for the 
event in the field provided, choose a start 
and end date and time, set whether the 
event is to repeat either daily, weekly, 
every two weeks, monthly or yearly and 
decide whether you want to be alerted 
in advance. 
A decent calendar is essential for organising your life. With the iPhone’s Calendar app and this guide, 
you need never miss an appointment, birthday, event, date or important meeting again.

 If you choose to receive an alert, 
you can determine how long in 
advance you want to receive the alert 
from the start of the event. You can also 
enter any notes or details in the bottom 
field which you feel are useful. When all 
details have been confirmed, tap Done 
to finish.
To edit an event, tap the event 
and then tap the Edit button that 
appears at the top right of the screen. 
From here you can tap on any of the 
fields to change the details. To delete 
an event tap it, tap the Edit button then 
tap the red Delete Event button at the 
bottom of the screen.
To invite one or more of your 
Contacts to this event, simply 
tap the + icon and add any recipients 
from your contacts listings. Once your 
list is complete, your contacts will be 
contacted automatically. They will then 
also be reminded of the event, providing 
they have accepted your invite.
To sync the calendar on your 
phone with other calendars on 
your computer via iTunes, connect your 
iPhone to your computer and choose 
iPhone Info.
To sync calendars over the air, 
you’ll need to turn Calendars on in 
your Google, Yahoo!, iCloud or Microsoft 
Exchange accounts. 
Now you will access all of your 
important information from one 
single place, which will make your life 
that little easier to plan. 
Syncing Calendars with Desktop Apps
While your Calendar app is a fantastic addition to your home screen, you may have previously used 
other similar applications on your desktop computer, so here we look at merging the two.

In iOS 9, the old Newsstand app is replaced by a new application, 
News. This new app is a little like the popular third-party application 
Flipboard, in that it collates news from various sources into your own 
personalised digital magazine. You can customise it to show features 
and articles on subjects you’re particularly interested in too.

way you did with your suggestions.
Tapping the magnifying glass in 
the top-right corner gives you 
the chance to search for tracks, albums 
and artists. You can choose to search 
either Apple Music, that is, Apple’s 
online library, or your own music which 
you’ve stored on your iPhone. Predictive 
suggestions are offered.
Tap the Connect icon at the 
bottom of the screen, and you 
can select artists to follow, based on 
suggestions made by the app. You can 
also see who you’re already following. 
This gives easy access to the artist’s back 
catalogue, and you can add comments 
too, where available.
Tap the Radio icon to access Apple 
Music’s range of radio stations. This 
includes the new Beats 1 station, which 
is exclusive to the service. It’s available 
worldwide, and broadcasts 24/7. Scroll 
down the screen to see music stations 
offered according to genres.
You can add songs and albums 
from Apple Music to your own 
music library. To add an album, tap 
the ‘+’ icon next to the album sleeve. It 
becomes a tick, and is then available in

Playing Videos
To begin playing one of the videos on your iPhone, touch the 
Videos icon on the home screen and then choose a category 
from the options that are shown. Once in your chosen category, 
select a video to watch and touch the filename to begin 
playback. If the video has chapters encoded, you will have the 
option to skip to any of them after selecting the video.
With its stunning, crisp HD screen, the iPhone is perfect for watching 
videos. You can choose to play your own videos captured on your 
iPhone, or you can buy or rent movies from iTunes. Make the most of the 
Videos app and learn how to find, play and share clips.
Sync Videos
As with apps and music, you can easily sync 
videos to your iPhone from iTunes. Connect 
your iPhone to your PC or Mac and wait for 
iTunes to open. If you have iTunes set not to 
auto-sync, you can choose which videos to sync 
to your iPhone from the left column. If you’re 
using a Mac you can also sync videos from 
Photos. iTunes will also allow you to convert 
videos into a compatible format if the original 
won’t sync.
Video Playback Controls
While your video is playing, you can switch the screen 
aspect by simply turning the iPhone to landscape. This 
will display almost all videos better (taking advantage of 
the full screen). Touching the screen at any time during 
playback will bring up the progress slider at the top and 
the control panel near the bottom. You can skip through 
the video by moving the progress slider and skip or pause 
using the control panel. Both will disappear again after a 
few seconds if not being used.
Watch iPhone Videos on a TV
You can connect your iPhone to most modern TVs using either 
Wi-Fi, an AV Cable or an iPhone dock connector and watch your 
videos on the big screen. This process is generally very simple: 
just plug in, browse to the correct AV channel on your TV and play 
the video on your iPhone.

tap More in the bottom right 
corner and select Genius. You can then 
review music, TV shows and films that 
are recommended to you based on your 
past purchases and your library. The

In the iTunes Store you’ll find 
movies to rent at a range of prices. 
Popular and new movies generally cost 
more to rent than older movies, but you 
can find plenty of good films to watch for 
just £0.99. You need to let your chosen 
movie download fully before you watch it 
(no streaming).
Navigate to the movie you want to 
buy or rent, and then tap either the 
Buy or the Rent button. If you buy a movie, 
but then delete it from your phone as you 
need the space for something else, you 
can download it again later; you won’t 
have to pay for it twice.
All rented movies will automatically 
delete 
themselves 
from 
your 
collection after a set amount of time. This 
time limit usually runs from the moment 
the movie starts to play, so make sure 
that you have enough time to watch your 
rented movie before you download and 
play it.

Previously a free download, with iOS 8, iBooks became an 
integrated app that’s supplied with your iPhone. And what an 
app it is. With iBooks, you can turn your iOS device into a very capable 
ebook reader, which is especially useful if you have an iPhone 6 Plus, 
with its larger screen. Let’s take a look at how you buy and enjoy ebooks.
Using the
iBooks App
Finding and Purchasing eBooks
You need to be signed into your 
iTunes account before you can 
use the built-in iBookstore. Sign in if 
prompted. To browse, you can pick a 
category such as; featured, top-selling, the 
New York Times Best-Seller, and browse 
by author, topic or title. If you find a book 
you like the look of, tap the cover to get 
additional information.
To find a book using the iBooks 
application, tap the Search icon 
and enter its name or author in the search 
field. When you’ve found the book you 
want, tap on the price then tap Buy Book 
or Get Book, depending on whether 
it’s free or not. Tap OK and confirm the 
purchase and the download process to 
your iPhone automatically begins.
When books are downloaded to 
your iPhone they are automatically 
synced with iCloud. If you ever sync your 
iPhone with your computer and a book 
no longer appears on your iPhone, it 
will automatically transfer over. This also 
acts as a form of a non-iCloud backup 
in case you accidentally delete the book 
off your iPhone.
Finding the book you want to read and buying it with your iTunes store account is easy with iBooks. 
Here’s a guide to buying your digital books, and downloading them on your iPhone.

BDM’s: The iOS 9 iPhone Manual
Using Your iPhone’s Key Apps

You need to be signed into your 
iTunes store account to use iBooks.
When you have downloaded the book 
you want, it will appear on the bookshelf 
of the iBooks App; all you need to do is 
tap it to begin reading. The iBooks App 
will automatically remember the last 
location of the book you were reading so 
no need to make a mental note.
Once you have a book on your 
iPhone, tap on it to open it. To 
turn the pages, flick or tap near the 
edge of the page; this works on either 
side, in case you want to go back a 
page. When you have finished reading 
and decide to exit the book, iBooks will 
automatically remember where you 
were for next time.
You can use iTunes to sync 
books to your iPhone. Once you 
have connected your iPhone, 
the Books Pane allows you to 
choose which books you want 
to sync. As well as the books 
you have downloaded via the 
iBookstore, you can download 
books in ePub format from many 
different websites and as long as 
they are DRM-free, they can also 
be placed onto your iPhone to 
read. You can also add PDFs to 
the iBooks app and read them 
on your iPhone.
To add an ePub book, just 
download the book on your 
computer, then add it to your 
iTunes 
library. 
Connect 
the 
iPhone to your computer, select 
the books you want to sync in 
the Books pane in iTunes, then 
sync your iPhone.
To skip ahead in your book, tap in 
the middle of the current page to 
bring up the controls that appear at the 
bottom of the screen. Now drag the slider 
to the page number or chapter that  you 
want to go to and then let go. To return 
to the table of contents, tap near the 
centre of the current page to show the 
controls and then tap Contents.
From here you can tap on any of 
the content to jump straight to 
that section of the book, or you can tap 
on Resume to go back to the page you 
were on. Even though iBooks remembers 
where you left off when you closed the 
book, you are also able to set bookmarks. 
To do this tap and hold on a word on the 
page then select Bookmark.
To remove the bookmark again, tap 
and hold the bookmarked word 
and tap Delete. If you want to read your 
iBook lying down, make sure you use the 
screen rotation lock accessed from the 
Control Centre, as this will prevent it from 
switching between landscape or portrait 
when the iPhone is tilted slightly. See the 
tutorial on Control Centre for instructions.

Using the
Game Center App
Playing games on your own is fun, but playing them with friends is 
even better. If you want to make the most of your iPhone gaming, 
you need to set up a Game Center account, so you can challenge friends 
and family to beat your highest scores. Here we show you how to set up 
your Game Center account and get a little more from your gaming.
Setting Up a Game Center Account
Open Game Center and set up 
your account. You need to come 
up with a unique handle for yourself; this 
will be your Game Center ID. You can 
then add friends to your Game Center 
Friends List using their Game Center 
handle or their email address.
If you want to buy games that are 
compatible with Game Center, 
the app lets you search specifically for 
games that are supported by the Game 
Center app. You’re taken to the App Store 
automatically, where you can browse, 
read reviews and buy titles as normal.
With Game Center set up you 
can add your scores to online 
leaderboards, challenge friends, make 
new friends and receive notifications of 
special events and further developments 
in the gaming world. At last, you don’t 
have to game alone!
Before you can challenge other gamers to matches and store your highest scores, you must set up a 
Game Center account. It’s free, and only takes a few minutes. Here’s how it’s done.

main screen.
Either choose an existing photo 
that’s already stored on your 
iPhone, or take a brand new one using

are happy with it hit the Choose 
button. To change your photo, repeat 
this process.
To inject a little more of your personality into your Game Center profile you can also upload a photo. 
For this short guide we will take you through each step of the process.
Challenging a Friend to Play
Select the Friends link from the 
bottom of the screen and tap the 
profile of the gamer you wish to challenge 
to a match of your favourite game.
From the Games In Common 
section, tap the name of the game 
you’re going to challenge your friend to 
best you at. Can they beat your scores?
Select 
from 
your 
scores 
or 
achievements for that game 
by tapping it and then issue your 
challenge by hitting Send Challenge.
This is how you access one of the best features of the Game Center app; the ability to challenge your 
friends to go one-on-one at your shared games. Can you beat their highest score?

Subscribing to Podcasts
Subscribing to podcasts is a great way of keeping up to date with the latest news, gossip and music 
from comedians, celebrities, DJs and more. Here’s how to do it using the iPhone’s Podcasts app.
When you first open the Podcasts 
app, you are greeted with the My 
Podcasts screen. To start choosing and 
subscribing to podcasts, browse or search 
through the listings. 
You see the Featured podcast. 
This is divided into categories 
to make it easier to find your favourite 
podcasts but has a search feature for 
when you want to be more specific.
You can preview a podcast by 
tapping on the episode title whilst 
browsing. If you are previewing a vodcast, 
a small video player will open from within 
the app itself.

the 
Subscribe 
button 
in 
the 
information window. The app will switch 
back to the Library screen and you will see

Subscribing to a podcast doesn’t 
mean the same as downloading a 
podcast. You can only listen to subscribed 
episodes when you have downloaded the 
podcast first. 
After 
downloading 
a 
podcast 
episode, tap the My Podcasts icon 
in the bottom left corner. From the next

With Apple Pay, you can leave your wallet at home and shop with 
your iPhone! Instead of picking through your purse or wallet trying 
to find the correct credit card, you can store your payment cards on your 
iPhone 6 or later versions and use them to make payments at the tills. 
Here’s how to set up and use this exciting new Apple service.

BDM’s: The iOS 9 iPhone Manual
Using Your iPhone’s Key Apps
Using the Wallet 
App and Apple Pay
How to Store Credit and Debit Card Information
Before you can use Apple’s great new Apple Pay at the tills, you need to store your credit or debit card 
information on your iPhone. This short guide teaches how you do just that, quickly and easily.
To use Apple Pay, you need at least 
an iPhone 6, 6 Plus or SE, or an 
Apple Watch connected to a compatible 
iOS device. That is: iPhone 5, 5C or 5S; 
iPhone 6 or 6 Plus; iPhone 6s or 6s Plus or 
an iPhone SE. You can also make Apple 
Pay payments online with an iPad Pro, 
iPad Air 2 or an iPad Mini 3.
 
Credit or debit cards are added 
to Apple Pay through the Wallet 
app. To add a new card, use your iSight 
camera to take a photograph of the card 
in question. Just keep it in the frame 
as advised on screen, and the card 
is photographed and its information 
stored. Alternatively, you can type the 
information in manually. 
Your credit and debit cards are 
then stored in Wallet, ready to 
use with Apple Pay. You can add the 
credit or debit card from your iTunes 
account simply by typing in the card’s 
security code. The first card you enter 
becomes the default payment card, 
but you can change this in Settings if 
you wish.

Wallet App and Apple Pay
Using Apple Pay on the iPhone
Using Apple Pay in the shops is as easy as setting it up with new 
cards. You simply wave your iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, or your Apple Watch 
in tandem with one of the Apple Watch-compatible iOS devices 
listed earlier, over the contactless payments terminal. At the same 
time, keep your finger on the Home button so your fingerprint can 
be scanned using Touch ID. Here’s how it works. 
When you have your credit and 
debit cards stored in your Wallet 
app, using the Apple Pay service is 
easy. Simply wave your iPhone over the 
contactless payments reader, with your 
finger held over your Touch ID reader so 
your identity can be confirmed using the 
fingerprint scanner. 
 
There’s no need to open the Wallet 
app to use Apple Pay. You don’t 
even have to unlock your iPhone; the 
service works even if it’s in sleep mode 
and the display is blank. You do not 
have to look at your screen to know the 
payment has been accepted either. It’s 
confirmed with a vibration and a beep.
Apple Pay is private and secure. 
Apple doesn’t store details of your 
transactions, and recent purchases are 
available for you to review in your Wallet 
app. If you lose your iPhone, you can 
suspend Apple Pay using Find My iPhone 
on a compatible device. Simply put it into 
Lost Mode.

Apple Pay is a major breakthrough in in-store payment. Instead 
of using a plastic credit or debit card, and verifying it with your 
signature or a four-figure PIN number, you store your cards’ 
information on your iPhone. When scanning it at the till, you 
verify your identity by placing a finger on the Home button, 
where it reads your fingerprint using Touch ID. Thanks to the 
iPhone 6’s Near Field Communication antenna, you don’t need 
to open an app, or even unlock the screen. Just hold your 
iPhone near the contactless reader and everything is carried 
out automatically. It’s a major breakthrough in contactless 
payment technology, and could revolutionise the way we pay 
for things in stores. 
What is Apple Pay?
Is there anything you can’t do with your iPhone?
According to Apple’s Eddie Cue, very soon after its initial release 
there were already over 220,000 contactless payment points 
where Apple Pay can be used and more are following all the 
time. Apple is working with large retailers including Macy’s, 
Bloomingdales, Walgreens, Duane Reade, Staples, Subway, 
McDonalds, DisneyStores, Nike, Toys R Us, Sephora, Petco and 
Whole Foods. Obviously you can use Apple Pay in Apple Stores 
as well. It was up and running in the United States first but 
it’s now been rolled out in Britain and Europe and also other 
territories. Apple Pay is easy to set up and use. Just follow our 
guide and you’ll soon be ready to go and finally do some wallet-
free shopping.

Now you can shop with your smartphone.

“How are you today?” We are asked that question on a daily basis but 
how many of us can offer an honest answer? The Health application 
gives us all a chance to keep a close eye on, and more importantly gain a 
deeper understanding of, our current state of health. Here’s a guide to setting 
up and using Apple’s Health application, and linking third party devices.
When you first open the Health app 
you will see this blank Dashboard 
screen; for the purpose of this guide we 
will only teach you how to input your basic 
data to fill the Dashboard with your info. 
To begin entering your basic 
information you will need to tap 
the Health Data button at the bottom of 
the screen; from this link you will find a 
host of data input options. 
For this guide we will only be 
entering data that we are able 
to get without the help of a medical 
professional, so let’s start by tapping the 
Me link from the options shown here.

Setting Up the Health Application 
The Health app is extremely complex and requires a huge amount of input on the user’s part; therefore, 
as with any attempt to monitor and/or improve your health, we suggest you seek out a medical 
professional for their help before you start. So with this in mind we will take a look at how you add your 
information and set up the Health app, not how to interpret the results.

process for each piece of data 
you input to the Health app. When you 
have completed this process, tap the

To make use of the Dashboard 
screen you will need to enter 
some variable data, the kind of data 
where the changes can be shown in

tap Body Measurements.
Tap the Weight option and enter 
your current weight by tapping 
the Weight link. Tap on the Add Data 
Point and enter the required details; then 
tap Weight to go back.

The Clock app might not be the most spectacular feature of your 
iPhone, but it does a lot more than simply tell the time. With our 
guide, you can set alarms, check the time in cities all over the world and 
even use it as a stopwatch or countdown timer. Just the thing if you’re 
travelling light, and you don’t want to pack a separate alarm clock.
Setting Alarms
Tap the Alarm tab at the bottom 
of the clock screen to start editing 
your alarms. To set a new alarm, tap the + 
button at the top right of the screen. This 
opens an Add Alarm window. Use the 
two wheels to pick a time for the alarm to 
sound. You can also choose which days 
the alarm will play, the alarm sound you 
want, whether the alarm can be snoozed 
and what the alarm is called. 
Your new alarm will be displayed 
at the top of the screen, as well 
as on the 24-hour display below. If you 
have more than one alarm set up, you 
can select each on this 24-hour display. 
You can also alter the time and day 
the alarm will sound by touching and 
holding it on the 24-hour display. You 
can then drag the alarm to whatever 
time and day you want. 
You can turn each alarm on or off 
independently 
by 
highlighting 
each one and then tapping the On/Off 
button. Alternatively you can remove 
or edit an alarm. Tap Edit and either tap 
the time you want to amend or tap the 
minus button to delete the alarm from 
your listings. 
NOTE: Once an alarm has been deleted it 
will be unavailable. 
Your iPhone will quickly become part of your life, and what better use is there for it than getting you up 
in the morning? Let’s take a look at how to set an alarm and make it repeat.

Download and tap the app icon 
on the home screen and you will 
be greeted by the log-in screen. You 
should use the Apple ID associated with 
the iPhone you are using (the Apple ID 
username should already be filled). 
The first time you use the app 
you’re asked if you wish to allow 
push notifications and use your current

to allow Location Services.
Tap the Me tab at the bottom of 
the screen to set up your location

your memo, simply tap the Delete link 
instead. The process will then return to 
the starting point.

iCloud and iCloud Drive are a huge leap forward. From photographs, 
apps, music and videos to simple notes; if it’s important it can be 
saved to your iCloud account and synced with iCloud Drive. Now if you 
lose your iPhone, your data is safe and can be restored, and you can work 
on the same document across multiple devices.
Signing Up for iCloud
If you’ve already linked to iCloud during your iPhone’s setup, skip to the ‘Customising iCloud’ section. 
If you didn’t, carry on and we’ll take you through this process from start to finish.
From the Settings app scroll 
down and tap the iCloud link. On 
the next screen enter your Apple ID 
details or if you are a first time user, you 
can sign up for an account via the Get A 
Free Apple ID link at the bottom of the 
screen. Once you have completed the 
registration and/or signed in, you’re 
asked if want to merge your account 
with iCloud. Click the Merge link.
You now get a second request, 
asking you to allow the iPhone 
to use Location Services. Make your 
selection to proceed. A positive reply 
is not necessary but is suggested. From 
this page, you can choose which file 
types and apps you wish to link to your 
iCloud account. You get 5GB of storage 
for free and can buy more if you wish, 
as we explain later.
Click on the Storage link and tap on 
it. Here you can check your storage 
volumes and also choose to activate the 
iCloud Backup option. This way when 
you plug your iPhone in to charge, as 
long as it is connected to a Wi-Fi account 
it automatically backs up to your iCloud 
account. To use this feature, slide the 
switch to On and agree to bypass iTunes 
back up.

Customising iCloud
Tap Settings and then tap the 
iCloud link. Choose which content 
you wish to share over iCloud. By 
switching a slider to the ‘On’ position, all 
new content to be sent to or generated 
by the app in question is automatically 
uploaded to iCloud during sync. Which 
apps you sync with iCloud in this way is 
entirely up to you of course.
By activating the Documents and 
Data iCloud sharing option, all data 
generated by your iPhone will also be 
uploaded to the iCloud. Another option 
on this screen allows you to use Cellular 
Data to upload to the iCloud on the go. 
As files can be large we advise you to 
check your data allowance with your 
network provider before agreeing to this. 
From the main iCloud screen you 
can choose to use the Backup 
option. Tap this link and then tap on 
the Back Up Now option from this 
second page. By selecting this option 
you can automatically back up all new

iCloud is a huge leap both in terms of data storage and how you manage the content on your iOS 
device. iCloud links to a large array of iPhone applications and although all of these links will prove 
exceptionally useful, you may want to only use the applications that will directly benefit you. For this 
guide we will take you through each stage of optimising your iCloud usage.

Shared Photo Streams
Shared Photo Streams allows you to create a gallery of images and share them with friends and family 
via iCloud, Apple TV or the web. People who view the photos can Like and comment on them.
This feature is turned off by default,

Photo Stream turned on to use it. 
Open the Photos application and 
tap the Shared link at the bottom

iCloud now lets you synchronise the browser on your iPhone with those on other Apple devices you own. 
Any bookmarks or tabs saved on one device are then available on all linked devices.

Setting Up iCloud Drive
Before we tell you about the amazing sharing features that iCloud Drive will open up to you, let’s take 
you through the initial setup. Here’s a guide to getting started with iCloud.
Go to Settings > iCloud and tap 
the iCloud Drive link. You get a 
message asking you to confirm your 
various Apple devices are running 
recent 
enough 
versions 
of 
their 
operating systems.
Once confirmed, you can now 
access the iCloud Drive options 
screen. Here you can choose which apps 
you allow to share content across your 
various iOS and OS X devices.
In iOS 9, you can add an iCloud 
Drive application to your desktop. 
If you haven’t already, go to Settings 
> iCloud > iCloud Drive and switch on 
Show on Home Screen.

In Settings > iCloud scroll down 
to Storage. Your current storage is 
listed. Tap the Buy More Storage link to 
be taken to this screen, where you can 
switch to a paid-for monthly tariff. If you 
change your mind later, return to this 
screen and switch to a cheaper, or free 
tariff with less storage.
To delete files go to Settings 
> iCloud > Storage > Manage 
Storage, to get to a screen listing 
backups and apps, and how much space 
their documents are taking. To delete a 
document from all iCloud devices, tap on 
the app that created it and on the next 
screen, swipe it left and tap Delete.
To remove a backup you no longer 
need, perhaps for a device you’ve 
sold or just no longer use, tap it and then 
on the next screen tap Delete Backup to 
erase the backup; this stops that device 
backing up to iCloud Drive in the future. 
Make sure you don’t delete a backup you 
need though.
Inside these folders are the documents saved to your iCloud 
Drive. In the Pages folder, we see the Cafe leaflet we saved 
before, along with our other Pages documents. Drag them out of the 
iCloud Drive folder if you want to remove them from iCloud Drive.
For this tutorial, we use Pages, but it holds true for all the apps in 
the iWork and iLife suites. We’ve created a document in Pages 
on the Mac, using OS X, and now it’s time to save it. Select Save from 
the pull-down menu under File, or press CMD-S.
Type a name for the document in the Save As field. As you can 
see, the Pages folder in iCloud Drive is the default location to 
save it to; although you could put it somewhere else instead if you 
wish. We want it in iCloud Drive, so we’ll just press Save.
If you open a Finder window and select iCloud Drive from 
the sidebar or Go, menu you can explore and navigate your 
iCloud folder just like you would a regular Mac folder. There are 
folders for all the apps you’re currently using with iCloud Drive.
Using iCloud Drive
Having set up your iPhone on iCloud Drive, you can now seamlessly link your iPhone directly to your 
other Apple devices such as an iPad or a Mac, or even a Windows computer.

iCloud comes with 5GB of storage space for free and you can buy more if you wish. You can also delete 
unwanted files directly from your iPhone, freeing up valuable cloud space. Here’s how to do it.

Back on the iPhone, open the 
Pages iOS app. It’s free with new 
iOS devices, but if you don’t have it 
already, it’s only £6.99 or $9.99 from the 
App Store. If you haven’t already, opt 
to use iCloud for Pages when invited 
to do so.
Tap the Documents link, and you’re 
taken to your iCloud Drive Pages 
documents folder. This is always kept in 
sync with the iCloud Drive folder on your 
PC or Mac, so anything you’ve produced 
on your computer is also shown here. As 
you can see, the Cafe leaflet we produced 
and saved earlier is there.
You can open a Pages document 
produced 
on 
your 
computer 
in Pages for iOS, and vice versa. Any 
edits you make on your iPhone are 
automatically synced to your Mac or 
PC. You can start a piece of work on one 
device, then switch to another and pick 
up where you left off.

Continuity is a range of new features that further integrates your 
iPhone, iPad and Mac. Its features include Handoff, which lets you 
start something on one device then continue on another; Phone Calls on 
your Mac, iPad and iPod touch; SMS Text Messaging from your Mac, iPad 
or iPod touch, even to non-Apple phones; and a new look at Wi-Fi Sharing.
Using Continuity
& Handoff
Continuity Phone Calls
Using Continuity, it’s possible to 
make and receive your iPhone’s 
calls on your iPad. Your iPhone needs to 
be running iOS 8 or later, and both your 
iPhone and your iPad (or iPod touch) 
need to be on the same Wi-Fi network. 
On both devices, open Settings, and tap 
Wi-Fi to check network compatibility.
You also need to make sure both 
devices are signed in to FaceTime 
using the same Apple ID. Check this 
under Settings > FaceTime. If your 
mobile phone service provider offers 
Wi-Fi calls, this must be off; see Settings 
> Phone > Wi-Fi Calls. If it isn’t there, you 
don’t need to worry.

You can also make and receive 
iPhone calls on your Mac. You 
must be running Yosemite or later, it 
needs to be on the same network as 
your iPhone, and you must be signed 
in using the same Apple ID. Just click on 
the Audio icon in Contacts or FaceTime 
to make the call.

With Continuity, you can make and receive iPhone calls on other Apple devices, as long as they’re 
recent enough and are all signed into the same iCloud account. Here’s how it’s done.

We’ve been able to share our iPhone’s 3G/4G Internet 
connection using Personal Hotspot since iOS 5, but with Wi-Fi 
Instant Hotspot it becomes a persistent connection. On your iPad, go 
to Settings > Wi-Fi and your iPhone is listed as a Personal Hotspot. 
No setting up is required at all.
Tap the iPhone in your Wi-Fi list and a connection is made. You 
are now on the Internet using your phone’s 3G or 4G service. 
If you had Personal Hotspot turned off on the iPhone, making this 
connection using Continuity automatically turns it on. It’s great for 
using your Mac or Wi-Fi-only iPad online without a Wi-Fi signal.
Wi-Fi Instant Hotspot

With Continuity, Macs running Yosemite and iPads running 
iOS 8 can send and receive SMS messages (not just Apple 
iMessages) through your iPhone. Again, they must be on the same 
network and signed into the same iCloud account. 
iMessages, the blue bubbles, have synced with Macs, iPod 
touches and iPads for some time;  now though, regular SMS 
messages sent by non-Apple devices and appearing in green bubbles 
are also synced. All of your messages appear on all of your devices.
Text Message Forwarding
You can now make phone calls from your iPad or iPhone 
touch by opening the Contacts app, finding the contact 
you want to call and then tapping the telephone icon next to the 
number you wish to ring. The call is made through your iPhone but 
using the mic and speakers in your other Apple device.
You can also receive calls on your iPad or iPhone touch. When 
someone calls you on your iPhone, your second iOS device 
rings too. To answer the call on the iPad or iPhone touch, use the 
Slide to Answer slider that appears. It’s really handy for taking calls 
while your iPhone is in your stereo dock or recharging.

As well as phone calls, you can also send and receive text messages on your other Apple devices. These 
now include regular SMS messages, not just Apple’s own iMessages.
Using your iPhone as a Wi-Fi hotspot, so you can take your computer or tablet online via your iPhone’s 
Internet connection, is not a new feature. But with Continuity, it’s always on.

Using the Handoff Feature
Before you can begin to use Handoff across your compatible hardware network, you will need to 
ensure that your device is compatible. Below we will show you how to start using Handoff.
120
BDM’s: The iOS 9 iPhone Manual
Advanced Guides for iPhone
Check your iPhone or other 
iOS device is recent enough to 
support Handoff. You need an iPhone 
5 or later. If you want to use an iPad, it 
must be 4th Gen or any iPad Air, Pro or 
mini. An iPod touch must be 5th Gen 
or later. iOS devices must be running 
iOS 8 or later; Macs need to be running 
Yosemite or later.
Both devices must be signed into 
the same iCloud account. To do 
this, open the Settings application, and 
tap iCloud in the left-hand column. Enter 
your iCloud ID and password, and then 
tap Sign In. Make sure you do this on all 
the devices on which you intend to use 
Handoff feature.
You also need to make sure 
Bluetooth is turned on. Again, 
open the Settings app, and this time 
tap Bluetooth in the left-hand column. 
If the switch in the right column 
labelled ‘Bluetooth’ is in the Off 
position, switch it on. Again, you must 
do this on all the devices on which you 
intend to use Handoff.
1
2
3
Handoff must also be switched 
on. To check whether this is the 
case, in the Settings app, tap General 
and then tap Handoff & Suggested 
Apps. Handoff is on by default. If you 
want to switch it off again later, this is 
where you do it; there’s no need to sign 
out of iCloud or turn off Bluetooth just 
to stop Handoff working.
4
5
6
Open one of the applications 
listed in the boxout. These are 
the applications that are currently 
compatible with Handoff, but more 
will no doubt follow over time. Begin 
using the app in the usual way. Surf the 
web, write an email, work on a Pages 
document or use one of the other Apple 
apps that currently offer Handoff.
If you are unsure which model 
of iPhone or iPad you’re using, 
open the Settings app and from the 
listings select General followed by 
About. Then take note of the number 
listed under Model. Now open Safari, 
and check at Apple’s support website, 
http://bit.ly/1Fnn9Tm.

Using AirDrop
First, swipe up from the bottom 
of your screen to open Control 
Centre. Make sure Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are 
switched on, then tap on AirDrop to open 
your options window.
You can select to turn AirDrop 
off, sharing only with contacts or 
sharing with everyone. The latter option 
will require you to accept any shared files, 
thus maintaining security.
Select a file you want to share, tap 
the Share icon (the box with the 
up-pointing arrow), and select the device 
you want to send it to from the AirDrop 
section.
The AirDrop feature is an excellent addition to iOS that makes sharing files and links far easier than ever 
before. Now both iOS and OS X users can quickly and securely send files wirelessly.

Put the device down without 
closing the app, and go to the 
device on which you wish to continue 
your task. On the lock screen you will 
see, in the bottom left corner, an icon 
representing the app in question, in 
this case Mail. Swipe this icon upwards 
and, if necessary, enter your lock code 
to continue where you left off on your 
second device.
You can also access Handoff from 
the Multitasking display. Double-
tap the Home button and all the apps 
currently open are shown. In a box 
underneath the open apps, you’ll see 
the active Handoff application. Tap the 
app to continue using it. Opening a 
document on a second device using 
Handoff closes it on the first device, 
which is just as well given the confusion 
it would otherwise cause.

According to Apple, the following 
applications are currently compatible 
with the new Handoff feature, on both 
OS X and iOS:
The feature isn’t limited to Apple apps. 
Developers can also make their own 
software compatible with Handoff, which 
will prove very useful for applications 
that are available on both OS X and iOS.

Siri is a fantastic feature of the iPhone that turns your smartphone 
into your very own personal assistant, and it’s been overhauled for 
iOS 9. What follows below is a short guide that takes you through the task 
of activating and using Siri, and using some of its more advanced features 
like setting alarms, checking appointments and identifying a song.
Turning off ‘Hey Siri’
If you find you’re activating Siri accidentally and would prefer to turn off the ‘Hey Siri’ feature described in Step 3, go to Settings > 
General > Siri and turn off the Allow “Hey Siri” switch. You can switch it on again later if you wish.
122
BDM’s: The iOS 9 iPhone Manual
Advanced Guides for iPhone
The Siri Personal 
Digital Assistant
To talk to Siri, hold down the Home 
button on your iPhone. You’ll hear 
two quick beeps and, “What can I help 
you with?” will appear on the screen. 
Begin speaking and the Microphone 
icon lights up to let you know that 
Siri can hear you. If the Microphone icon is 
not lit, tap it to talk to Siri again.
When your device is on charge, but 
still in earshot, you can access Siri 
by simply and clearly saying “Hey Siri”, 
and then asking your follow-up request.
1

How to Activate and Speak to Siri
Siri is only ever a click away, and these simple steps show you how easy it is to have the Siri assistant 
start working for you on your iPhone. But what will you ask her first?

Check Appointments
Siri can tell you if you have any 
appointments on any particular date, 
or even within a time frame. Say to Siri 
something like “What’s my schedule 
for April?” and it tells you how many 
appointments you have in that month 
and lists them on screen. If you want 
to be more specific, say “What are my 
appointments today?” or “What’s my 
schedule for June 19th?”
Look Things Up
Siri works with normal web search, 
Wikipedia search and Wolfram Alpha. To 
look things up, speak to Siri as you would 
to anyone you were asking a question of. 
Which planet is the largest? Why does 
snow fall? Siri will use the source it thinks 
best able to answer the question. If you 
want to use a particular search engine, 
simply say the name before the question: 
“Wolfram, how far is it to the Sun?”
Add Things Up
Siri is particularly good at maths 
questions, from general things like 
“What is six multiplied by nine?” to more 
real-world problems such as splitting 
a restaurant bill, “What is 96 divided by 
five?” If that isn’t impressive enough for 
you, try something harder like “What is 
the square root of 45,051?”
Create a Secure Password
Say “Wolfram, password.” Wolfram 
generates a difficult-to-crack random 
eight-character password. You can then 
scroll down for a list of alternatives. 
Scroll further down and you can 
even see how difficult the password 
is to crack for hackers using known 
decryption methods.
Turn Alarms On or Off
Siri is designed to make common tasks 
easier, but there are some things that 
you just might not think about asking 
your personal assistant to do. Rather than 
fumbling about late at night to turn your 
morning alarm on or off, simply raise the 
phone to your ear, wait for the beeps and 
say “Turn on (or off) my alarm”. Siri will 
confirm the action.
Identify a Song
As well as being able to search for content 
on the web, Siri lets you identify a song 
using the Shazam audio recognition 
software. While a song is playing, activate 
Siri and ask, “What is this song?” Siri 
searches and finds the title, then links 
you to iTunes.
123
BDM’s: The iOS 9 iPhone Manual
Siri Personal Digital Assistant
www.ebook3000.com

Play Music
Siri can find and play your music at your 
command. You can tell Siri to play music 
in a few different ways. The simplest is to 
say “Play <track name>”. You can also use 
commands such as “Play drum and bass” 
or “Play my exercise playlist”. Assuming 
you have some music defined as drum 
and bass or a playlist called Exercise, they 
start to play.
Get Directions
Siri really comes into its own as a personal 
assistant when you need directions. Just 
ask “How do I get home?”, “Show me 
the way to <address>” or “Which way 
is it to work?”, and Siri summons the 
Maps app, giving you directions. You 
can even ask, “Where is the nearest pub”, 
or train station, or other such facility, 
and if Siri finds an appropriate venue, 
follow up with “How do I get there?” Siri 
understands perfectly.
Send SMS Messages
Once you get used to how you need to 
speak to Siri, sending messages using 
the assistant becomes easy and even 
fun. When dictating a message (or 
email, note, etc.) you need to remember 
to speak the punctuation. To send a 
message, you can either say “Tell my wife 
I’ll be home late” or “Send a message to 
John”. In the latter case, Siri then asks 
what you want the message to say.
Searching your Photos
With iOS 9, Siri can search your Photos 
app. Ask it to “Show me photos I took 
recently”, “Show me photos I took on [a 
date]”, or “Show me photos I took at [a 
place]” and the digital assistant displays 
all the pictures that meet this criteria. 
Here we asked for the photos we took at 
Torbay Harbour.
Show Me Pictures of...
Siri can search the web for pictures if you 
wish. Just ask (for example), “Show me 
pictures of a sunset”, and Siri searches 
the web for suitable pics, and shows 
them to you. Scroll up the results and tap 
to search alternative sources. Tap on a 
picture for a bigger preview and double-
tap to open it in Safari.
Remind Me...
Another feature added for iOS 9 is deeper 
Reminders integration. If you say to Siri 
(for example), “Remind me to buy milk 
when I get to Sainsbury’s”, the digital 
assistant creates a new location-aware 
reminder that triggers when you get to 
the store in question. If there’s more than 
one store nearby, you’re asked which you 
wish to use.
124
BDM’s: The iOS 9 iPhone Manual
Advanced Guides for iPhone

Siri and Apple Music
If you subscribe to the Apple Music 
service, you can use Siri in even more 
inventive ways when playing your 
sounds. A command such as “Play the 
most popular songs of last year” is 
understood and acted on, and you can 
also give instructions like “Play songs like 
this one”, “Add this song to my library” 
and “After this song, play [name of song]”.
Sports Results
Do you want to know how your favourite 
team did in their last match? Or the 
results of the last Formula 1 race? Or who 
your team is playing next week? Just ask 
Siri, and you will be told. Remember, Siri 
learns as you go, so the more you use it, 
the better the results it offers.
Have a Laugh!
Finally, it’s worth remembering that Siri 
doesn’t always take itself too seriously. 
You can have a great time asking silly 
questions, some of which it has a ready 
answer for. Try asking “What is zero 
divided by zero” for an amusing response. 
Tell Siri you’re drunk, and it suggests you 
call a taxi, and ask “How many [anything] 
does it take to screw in a lightbulb?” for a 
breakdown of this famous joke.
The Weather
Siri is also integrated with the Weather 
app now. All you have to do is ask a 
question like, “What will the weather be 
like tonight?”, or “Will it rain tomorrow?”, 
and you get your answer. You can also 
ask more complicated questions like, 
“What will the weather do in Edinburgh 
on 1st September?”, and as long as 
you’re not asking too far ahead, again 
you’re told.
Siri Dictation Commands 
Siri also understands dictation as 
well as words, so if you are dictating 
an email, for instance, this useful 
list of dictation commands that Siri 
recognises will prove very useful.  
New line - Move to the next line 
New paragraph - Start a new

Using the iPhone’s 
Notifications
iOS’s notification system makes it simple to keep track of new 
notifications and act on them, whether it’s immediately or at a later 
time. Every notification is stored in one place and can be accessed at any 
time with a single swipe of the finger. In this section we are going to take 
you through a comprehensive step-by-step guide of the entire process.
Using the Notification Centre Made Easy
Since it serves as your reminders 
and communication hub on your 
iPhone, you can access the Notification 
Centre quickly and easily at any time, no 
matter which app you’re in, simply by 
swiping your finger down from the top of 
the screen.  
The Notification Centre is pulled 
into view and you’ll be able to see 
all your current notifications. To instantly 
act on any notification in the list, all you 
have to do is tap on it. This will take you 
directly to the relevant app that has sent 
out the notification.
To clear notifications that you 
don’t want to deal with, all you 
need to do is tap the cross next to the 
appropriate one and then tap Clear 
when prompted. This will remove the 
notification, enabling you to keep 
Notification Centre tidy and uncluttered.
Before delving deeper into the functionality of the Notification Centre, let’s go through accessing and 
viewing your notifications themselves. It’s amazing how much information is at your fingertips.

Organising Your Notifications
Now you know where and how to access Notification Centre, but there are several options you can use 
to further tailor it to your liking. Here’s how to customise it to suit the way you use your iPhone.
Open Settings, and then tap 
Notifications. Here you can set 
how your notifications are ordered. 
With the top option set to Recent, flick 
the switch on or off to group incoming 
notifications according to the app that 
sent them. Tap Sort Order and you can 
switch to setting the app order manually.
Choose Manual and an icon 
showing three lines appears next 
to each listed app. Tap and hold this 
icon and drag the apps into the order 
which you want them to be listed. When 
you’re happy with your arrangement, 
tap the link in the top left corner to go 
back to Notifications.
Tap on an individual app for more 
options. The Allow Notifications 
switch lets you turn off notifications for that 
particular app. You can also adjust how 
many notifications appear in Notification 
Centre, whether they’re shown on the 
Lock screen, whether there’s a sound alert 
when received and more.

Replying Directly to Notifications from the Lock Screen
If you receive a notification when 
your device is locked, it appears as 
usual on the screen and is accompanied 
by the usual alert sound. However with 
the latest versions of iOS, you don’t have 
to unlock your iPhone to deal with it.
To access the message (for 
this example we will be using 
an iMessage text but the method 
remains the same for other apps), 
swipe to the left having placed your 
finger on the notification. 
You can now reply or confirm the 
notification using the standard 
input method. Once complete or sent, 
your device will return to the Lock 
screen and the reply will be stored in 
the host app. 
You can access your notifications directly from the Lock screen, without having to unlock your device 
and then open the host app where the notification came from. It’s this easy to do.

Accessing Notifications when In-App
You can also access your notifications if you are currently running an application on your device; so if 
you are playing a game and receive a message, you can reply to it without spoiling your game.
There are a host of applications 
which 
send 
notifications 
that 
can be accessed while using another 
application; apps such as Mail, Messages, 
Calendar, Reminders and more.
When you receive your notification 
you can quickly access it by placing 
your finger on the notification and 
swiping in a downward motion to reveal 
your available options. 
Open the Mail application and 
check through your mail as 
usual. When a mail contains additional 
contact details that you don’t already 
have in your Contacts app, you will 
receive this notification.
You have two options: Ignore, 
which when tapped will close 
this notification without taking any 
action; or Add to Contacts, which will 
update your current contacts with this 
new information. 
You can also request to receive 
a notification when the recipient 
replies to your email; do this by tapping 
the blue bell icon in the right-hand side 
of the subject bar. It turns to a solid blue 
bell, instead of an outline.
Once you have made your choice 
of reply or action, the notification 
will automatically close and you will be 
able to get back to what you were doing 
with your awesome Apple device. 
Using Application-Based Notifications
When using the Mail application you will receive notifications from the app itself. Once again, when 
used correctly this feature adds hugely to the seamless and user-friendly iPhone user experience.

You can integrate your favourite social networking accounts with 
your iPhone, so that you can post to them directly from your apps. 
You need to have an account with Facebook, Twitter, Vimeo and/or Flickr 
so if you haven’t already, go to the relevant service’s website and sign up 
for one. Then return to your iPhone and integrate that account with iOS.
Using Social Media 
Integration
First of all open the Settings 
app and scroll down the left-
hand sidebar until you see four social 
networking services listed in a group, just 
below Apple’s apps. These are Twitter, 
Facebook, Flickr and Vimeo.
Tap on the social networking 
service you wish to integrate with 
your iPhone and enter your Username 
and Password for that site as instructed. 
You can also download its dedicated app 
if you wish.
After integrating a social network 
with your iPhone, you can access 
its services directly from some apps. For 
example, you can share a photo to your 
Facebook timeline or Tweet a website 
directly from Safari.

Go to Settings > General > 
Spotlight Search. You’ll see a 
complete listing of all the linked search 
functions that Spotlight Search uses. To 
remove any from this list, use the switch 
to the right of their names.
To access the Spotlight Search, 
on the home screen, place your 
finger on the screen and drag it down. 
Make sure you don’t place that finger 
right at the top of the screen, or you get 
Notifications instead of Spotlight.
Start to type what it is you’re 
searching for in the search field 
at the top of the screen. As you type, 
suggestions are offered. The most likely 
results are shown at the top of the 
results; tap one to open it.

If you’re looking for a contact using 
the Spotlight Search, you can tap 
the FaceTime, Message or Phone Call 
icon next to the name, and initiate a call 
or open a new message. Spotlight opens 
the app in question for you.
Touch and drag the screen to close 
the keyboard, and tap the search 
field to get it back. As you type, results 
are displayed from almost every app on 
the iPhone. At the bottom, there are links 
to search the web, App Store or Maps.
The Spotlight Search offers you a way to search not only your 
iPhone and your files but also the world around you, and it’s been 
overhauled for iOS 9. Here’s how to get the most from this feature.

How to Use the 
Multitasking Screen
The multitasking screen has undergone a radical change for iOS 9. 
The recent and favourite contacts are gone (use Spotlight instead), 
and it’s had a visual makeover, but it’s still as effective and easy to use as 
ever. Here’s how to use the iOS 9 Multitasking Screen to switch between or 
close down open apps, and see what’s running on your iPhone.
This is the multitasking screen. 
Currently open apps are shown 
here. Swipe left and right to scroll 
through them and tap a specific app to 
open it. The icons and app names are 
now shown at the top.
As well as switching between open 
apps without going through the 
home screen, you can also close an app 
by dragging it upwards, off the top of the 
screen. This is especially useful if an app 
has frozen or become unresponsive.
Unlike in previous versions of the 
multitasking screen, the home 
screen is found on the right of the open 
apps. Scroll all the way to the right to find 
the home screen again. You can tap it to 
go to the home screen s but can’t flick it 
up to close it.

Accessing and Using the Multitasking Screen
Just like in previous versions of iOS, in iOS 9, you access the multitasking Screen by double-tapping on the 
Home button. But what you see when you get there is very different. Let’s take a look.

Find My iPhone and 
Security Options
Find My iPhone is an important addition to iOS and iCloud, 
and could help you find a lost or even stolen iPhone using your 
computer or another iOS device. For the purpose of this feature, we will 
take you through the entire setup process and walk you through a lost 
device scenario. We sincerely hope that you never have to use any of the 
following, but it’s better to be forearmed should the very worst happen.
Initial Setup and Integration
Before you can move on you will 
need to confirm that you have 
activated Find My iPhone from the iCloud 
options page from the Settings menu. 
Tap the Find My iPhone application 
and you will be taken to this log in 
screen. Enter your Apple ID and password 
and you will be signed into the application. 
You can see all iOS devices linked 
to your Apple ID. A green display to 
the left of the name indicates the device is 
traceable via your iPhone.
iPhone Setup 
During initial setup, you can choose to install and use the Find My iPhone application when instructed. 
Alternatively, you could download the app directly from the App Store before you start.

Using Passcode Lock
The most basic but easily 
overlooked way to protect 
your iPhone is to simply add 
a passcode to your home 
screen. You will have already 
done so during the first time 
setup process, but this can 
be changed at any time. To 
do this click on the Settings 
app and scroll down and tap 
the Touch ID and Passcode 
link. Here you will find the 
passcode setting options, 
you will be asked to enter 
a four-digit passcode which 
you will enter each time 
you access your device. 
Once you have entered your 
choice of code, you will be 
asked to confirm it is correct.
Creating a More Secure Passcode
Although the simple four-digit 
passcode may be a deterrent 
to many wrongdoers, you can 
also choose from a number 
of 
other 
options, 
which 
are 
accessed 
by 
tapping 
the Passcode Options link 
from the password input 
screen. You will be given 
three 
options, 
Custom 
Alphanumeric Code, Custom 
Numeric Code and 6-Digit 
Numeric Code. The former is 
detailed in the previous mini-
guide while the remaining 
options enable you to extend 
the length of the password 
to a total of 30 characters, 
mixing 
either 
words 
and 
digits or just digits.
Improving Your iPhone’s Security
These short tutorials may help you to make your iPhone a little less attractive in the eyes of a potential 
iPhone thief and at the very least offer you a little extra peace of mind. 
Stop Location 
Recording
If you’d rather your iPhone didn’t record 
your location, you can switch this feature 
off. Open the Settings app and tap 
Privacy. From there, tap Location Services, 
and turn off the switch at the top of 
the screen labelled ‘Location Services’. 
You can also restrict access to Location 
Services on a per-app basis here.
Computer Setup 
If you don’t have another iOS device, you can trace a lost iPhone on 
a Mac or PC, maybe from a public library or a police station.
You can access Find My iPhone from any Mac or PC with a web browser and an 
Internet connection. From your computer, go to www.icloud.com. Enter your Apple 
ID and password and you’re taken to the hub screen.
Click the Find My iPhone link and re-enter your Apple ID password. On this screen you 
see all your Macs and iOS devices linked to your Apple ID; once again, a green display to 
the left of their name indicates that the device is traceable.

Finding Your iPhone
Now you have signed up for Find My iPhone on both your desktop and your iDevice itself,  we’ll take 
you through the worst-case scenario; finding out that your iPhone has been lost or stolen. 
Tap the Find My iPhone app and 
sign in using your Apple ID. This is 
very important if you’re using someone 
else’s iPhone. Now select the device that 
is missing from the list shown here. 
Tap the missing device and see its 
location, shown via Maps. Tap the 
blue right arrow on the map indicator for 
several options. We focus on Play Sound 
or Lost Mode and Erase.
To locate your device if it’s within 
earshot, tap the Play Sound link 
and then tap Send. Your device makes 
a noise, enabling you to find it; just the 
thing if it’s lost in the house.
To lock the device so it is password- 
protected and no-one can access 
your information, click the Remote Lock 
option and then the Confirm option. 
The Erase option is your last resort. 
By clicking this link and confirming 
your intentions you will completely wipe 
your iPhone, rendering it useless. 
Finding Your 
iPhone From 
Your Desktop 
Computer
From your desktop computer, access 
the Internet and visit www.icloud.com. 
Enter your Apple ID and password and 
you will be taken to the hub screen. 
Now click the Find My iPhone link 
from the on-screen options and re-

Setting Up Lost Mode
Added in iOS 6, this feature allows you to immediately lock a lost iDevice using a code, and then 
display a message on the lock screen that contains a contact phone number. 
You obviously need to have the 
Find My iPhone feature set up and 
enabled to use Lost Mode. To do this, open 
Settings > iCloud > Find my iPhone and 
turn on the service. You will need to sign in 
using your Apple id. 
If you lose your iPhone, log in to 
https://www.icloud.com/#find and 
wait until your device is shown on the 
map. Click on your device and you will 
see several options, including Turn on 
Lost Mode. 
Click on the Lost Mode option and 
you will be prompted to lock your 
missing iPhone with a four-digit code. This 
code will allow you to unlock the device 
when you get it back, so make sure you 
use a code you will remember. 
The next thing to do is to add a 
phone number that you can be 
contacted on. This displays on the lock 
screen of the iPhone and will mean the 
finder can contact you to arrange its return 
to you. 
Finally, you will be asked to write 
a short message to whoever finds 
the iPhone. There will be a simple pre-
written message in place for you to use, 
or you can write your own. Keep it short 
and to the point. 
The iPhone is locked. Anyone 
finding and trying to activate 
it sees your message and the phone 
number you included. They can then call 
you, using your iPhone, by tapping the 
Call link on the screen.

Using the
Night Shift Feature
If you use your iPhone late at night, maybe for the odd game of Candy 
Crush in bed or checking your emails one last time before you turn 
in, the blue light emitted from the screen can make it harder to drop off. 
Thankfully, the new Night Shift mode can tone down the screen’s blue light, 
making it appear more yellow and ease your sleep.
To activate Night Shift, go to 
Settings > Display & Brightness 
and activate the Blue Light Reduction 
function. This reduces the amount of 
blue light your screen outputs, so making 
it easier to sleep.
Switch on the Manually Enable 
Until Tomorrow switch to turn it on 
for the rest of the day. Turn on Scheduled 
to have it come on automatically at times 
set by yourself or from sunset to sunrise 
if you prefer.
You can also switch it on and off

Stopping
In-App Purchases
In-App Purchases or IAPs, are sales made from within an app instead of 
on the App Store. An increasing number of apps include the ability to 
upgrade or unlock features from within the app itself via in-app purchasing. If 
you regularly lend your iPhone to someone else or have young children, you 
might want to turn this option off.
Go to Settings > General > 
Restrictions. 
Tap 
the 
Enable 
Restrictions link at the top of the screen, 
then enter and confirm a four-digit PIN. 
Make this code something memorable, 
as you’ll need it if you want to change 
your restrictions options in the future.
With restrictions enabled you can 
change several settings which can 
help with the security of your iPhone and 
apps. However, the one we are interested 
in for the moment is the option labelled 
In-App Purchases, just above the Allowed 
Content section.
Turn this option off by touching 
the switch. In-app purchasing is 
now disabled on your iPhone and cannot 
be turned on again unless someone 
knows your four-digit PIN. If you want 
to turn it back on yourself, return to this 
screen and flick the switch again.

Updating iOS on 
Your iPhone
iOS is the operating system on which the iPhone runs. Apple regularly 
releases updates to it, bringing new features and essential maintenance 
improvements like bug fixes. If you want to make the most of your iPhone, 
and why wouldn’t you, it’s essential to keep your version of iOS up to date. 
Here’s a guide on how to do it.
To check for a new version 
of iOS, open Settings and tap 
General, then Software Update. Your 
iPhone checks with Apple’s servers to 
see if there’s a newer version than the 
one you’re currently running. If one is 
available, you can install it now.
If there is tap the Download and 
Install link. You may need to plug 
your iPhone into a mains power supply 
if the battery is low. After entering your 
passcode you’re shown the Terms and 
Conditions, to which you must agree.
The update downloads. When 
it’s finished tap Install Now. The 
update installs and your phone restarts; 
don’t turn off your phone while this is 
going on. Enter your passcode and Apple 
ID when prompted and you’re done.

page, updating apps you’ve already installed is free and also easy to do. Here’s 
how to keep your iPhone’s software up to date by regularly updating your 
installed applications.
When you have installed apps for 
which updates are available, the

Removing Data & 
Saving Storage Space
Running out of memory storage is annoying, and might stop you 
downloading data or capturing images or video. Therefore keeping on 
top of your data storage should be a priority for all users. What follows are our 
tips on how to remove unwanted and unneeded data from your iPhone, to 
free up valuable space and keep your iPhone in tip-top shape at all times.
To view how much storage each 
app uses, open the Settings app 
and from the General link, tap on Usage. 
Now tap on Manage Storage to see a list 
of apps on your iPhone. To delete one 
of them, first tap the small arrow to the 
right of the app description.
From the next screen, you can see 
the size of the app’s Documents 
and Data too. If you’re sure you want 
rid of it, tap the Delete App link at the 
bottom. You’re asked to confirm you 
wish to delete the app. Do so and it 
disappears from your home screen.
You can also delete apps you no 
longer use from the home screen. 
Just tap and hold an app until the icons 
wobble, and show an X icon in the top 
left corner. Tap this icon to delete its 
app. Apple’s apps that offer no such icon 
cannot be deleted.

Filling your device with video clips is a 
sure-fire way to waste storage space. To 
delete your unwanted videos from the 
Video App, tap the Edit button on the 
top right of the screen and then tap the 
small black icon on the top right of the 
video itself. Confirm you wish to delete 
and the clip will be removed from your 
iPhone, but will remain in iCloud to be 
downloaded as and when you wish.
Using Alternative 
Cloud Storage
iCloud isn’t the only cloud storage option. 
Dropbox (shown here) or Google+ both 
let you upload your photos and videos 
to their storage servers, so you can delete 
your images and video clips from your 
iPhone after exporting them. You can also 
import your photos and videos directly to 
your desktop computer using such tools 
as iPhoto and Windows Image Importer.
Stream Don’t Download
Data Streaming is an alternative method 
of using your media content (audio 
and visual) with no impact on your 
iPhone’s storage. Using iCloud as your 
base and ensuring you have a solid data 
connection, you can access your video 
and music by tapping the song or clip 
you want to play and streaming the data 
to your iPhone. If you wish to play a song/
clip again after it has ended, you need 
to stream it once more. Check that you 
have no limits on your data allowance 
from your service provider first.
Messages
Deleting a Message is really easy. First 
of all, from the home screen, find the 
Messages app and open it. Scroll until 
you find the conversation you wish 
to delete, and then slide your finger 
along it, from right to left. A box opens 
offering a Delete link. Tap it and the 
conversation disappears.
Delete Messages & Emails
Emails and Messages can take up a large amount of storage, especially if they contain large attachments 
such as pictures or videos. Here’s how to delete those you no longer need.

Maximise Your 
Battery Life
Maximising the life of your iPhone battery isn’t just about making it 
last longer between each charge; it is also about making sure that 
in 12 months’ time, the battery is still able to hold a decent charge and 
you don’t have to pay for a replacement battery or replacement phone. 
Follow these simple tips to make your iPhone battery last longer.
Reduce Mail Fetch Frequency
Applications such as Mail can be set 
to fetch data at specific intervals. The 
more frequently it does so, the quicker 
your battery drains. To fetch new data 
manually go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, 
Calendars > Fetch New Data and tap 
Manually. To increase the fetch interval, 
go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars 
> Fetch New Data and tap Hourly. This is 
a global setting and applies to all apps 
that don’t support push services.
Lower Screen Brightness
Although the screen might look better at 
close to full brightness, keeping it turned 
up in this way drains the battery life 
fairly quickly if using the phone for long 
periods. Use the slider in the Settings 
menu to reduce the brightness. You 
can also set the iPhone to automatically 
set the brightness depending on the 
ambient light level at the time but this 
can use more battery power than simply 
setting the brightness at a fixed level.
Turn Off Location Services
Certain apps and programmes use GPS 
to gather periodic location information, 
which uses battery power every time it 
is updated on your phone. Turning off 
the Location Services used by Maps etc. 
when you aren’t using them can save 
a lot of battery life. Open Settings and 
tap the Privacy link and turn Location 
Services off. If you need to find your 
location, simply turn Location Services 
back on as and when you need them.

Enable Airplane Mode
The poorer the network coverage is, the 
harder the iPhone has to work to pick 
up a signal. if you are in an area with 
very low or no signal at all, switching 
to Airplane Mode reduces the amount 
of power being used by turning off all 
wireless and network connections. You 
can’t make or receive calls in this mode, 
so make sure you turn it back on when 
you return to civilisation.
Turn Off Mobile Data
If you are in an area with little or no 3G 
or 4G coverage or if you are at home and 
have a good Wi-Fi connection, disable 
3G in the settings. Although it can help 
speed up downloads, the 3G radio can 
use a lot of battery. All you have to do 
is go to Settings > Mobile Data and flick 
the switch marked ‘Mobile Data’. You can 
always turn it back on again when you 
need it.
Disable Push Notifications
Certain applications use push notifications 
to alert you to new emails or updates. 
Turning off push notifications, Settings > 
Notifications, will not stop new information 
being delivered when you open a 
particular app but it will save battery life. If 
you don’t want to turn push notifications 
off completely, at least look to see if you 
can reduce the regularity of notifications.
Turn Off Wi-Fi & Bluetooth
If you’re not currently using your Wi-Fi or 
your Bluetooth connections, turn them 
off. The easiest way is to swipe upwards 
from the bottom of the screen for the 
Control Centre and tap the Bluetooth or 
Wi-Fi icons to switch them off.
Set Phone Lock
To change the phone lock time, open 
Settings > General and scroll down to Auto-
Lock. Check that this is set to 1 Minute. If 
you forget to lock the phone manually, it 
will now only stay on for a minute rather 
than wasting power for longer.
Low Power Mode
iOS 9’s Low Power Mode can be turned 
on manually by going to Settings > 
Battery. When power is low, a notification 
offers the chance to switch it on too. In 
Low Power Mode the battery icon turns 
yellow and features such as mail fetch, 
background app refresh and some visual 
effects are switched off, giving around 
three hours extra battery time.

Additional Accessibility 
Many new electronic devices now offer a small range of accessibility 
features for users with visual or hearing impairments or other 
disabilities. The iPhone, along with iOS, contains not only the usual 
options for increasing text size or changing the contrast of the screen, but 
also includes subtitles, captions and an innovative voice over feature, and 
much more. Here’s how to make the iPhone more accessible to everyone. 
Accessing the 
Accessibility 
Features
To use the features detailed in 
this guide, open the Settings 
app, select the General link and 
from this link tap Accessibility. 
Vision Accessibility Options
For those of us that require a little extra help due to issues with 
our vision there are many options which can make the iPhone user 
experience that much easier. 
VoiceOver
VoiceOver actually changes the way you control your iPhone, 
making it possible for someone with little or no sight to navigate 
around the device with greater accuracy. 
When you interact with an element 
on the screen, a black rectangle 
appears around it, so sighted users can 
follow along. When you prefer privacy, 
you can activate a screen curtain to turn 
off the display so no one can see it, even as 
you’re controlling it. And when VoiceOver 
is talking, the volume of any background 
audio, from music or video, automatically 
lowers, so you can hear VoiceOver clearly. 
Because VoiceOver is integrated into 
iOS, it works with all the built-in apps, 
including Safari, Mail, App Store, iTunes, 
Music, Calendar, Reminders and Notes. You 
can also create custom labels for buttons in 
any app, including third-party apps. You can 
also use this function to have the contents 
of any notifications spoken to you. You 
can find this setting at the bottom of the 
VoiceOver screen.

Zoom
Zoom, as the name suggests, allows you to magnify anything 
on the iPhone screen. Turn this feature on and the display will 
automatically zoom in. Here’s how it’s set up and used.
From 
the 
Accessibility 
settings 
screen, flick the switch marked 
‘Zoom’. You can then control the zoom 
level by tapping anywhere on the screen 
with three fingers. If you need to move the 
screen around to see areas which are now 
out of sight because of the zoom level, drag 
the screen using the three-finger touch. To 
change the level of zoom, double-tap with 
three fingers and then drag them over the 
screen on the second tap.
Zoom is useful when there’s lot of 
text on your iPhone. Being able to 
quickly zoom the screen can be handy, and 
unless you’re also using other accessibility 
features (which sometimes also use 
the three-finger tap), it’s unlikely you’ll 
accidentally turn zoom on when you don’t 
need it. A simple double-tap with three 
fingers instantly zooms in 200 per cent, but 
you can adjust the magnification between 
100 and 500 per cent.

Invert Colours
Inverting the colours on the iPhone 
changes the display to something 
like the night mode found on many 
e-reader apps. 
By switching the light areas (usually 
background) to dark, and the text to 
white, users with vision problems may 
find it easier and less of a strain to see 
and read. It does, however, make some 
screens look slightly strange (including 
the home screen). 
Speak Selection
In a similar way to VoiceOver, Speak 
Selection gives you the option to have 
some text read aloud to you. The main 
difference is that Speak Selection only 
reads text that is selected or highlighted 
by the user. This means that it won’t 
speak every menu heading you touch 
or any icon you tap, but it will read out 
text you highlight in a Word document, 
for example. To use Speak Selection, 
activate it in the Settings and then 
open the document, note or website 
you want to have spoken. Highlight a 
section of text as you would normally, 
and then tap Speak from the action 
menu that appears. 
You can change the language and the 
accent of the voice that Speak Selection 
uses in the Accessibility Settings. You 
can also choose to the have the words 
highlighted as they are read out, to give 
you an easy visual clue to the progress of 
the audio. 
Speak Auto-text
Used on its own or in conjunction with 
Speak Selection, Speak Auto-text will 
automatically speak aloud any auto-
corrections and auto-capitalisations in 
the text documents, notes or emails 
you compose.

Hearing Aids
Hearing Accessibility Options
For any users who are hearing-impaired, the iPhone’s Accessibility features offer numerous helpful 
options to make apps and other phone functions easier for you to use.
Larger Type
With Larger Dynamic Type enabled, any app which supports the feature will automatically 
adjust the font size to the level you select in the Accessibility Settings. As you adjust the 
size slider in the Settings, the text on that page will increase or decrease in size to show 
you the change you can expect to see. 
Apps which support Larger Dynamic 
Type include Mail, Safari, iBooks, Notes, 
Reminders, Keynote, Numbers, Pages and 
the Calendar. You may find that some 
third-party apps do not support this 
feature, but many of the most popular 
and better-known apps do. 
Bold Text
Bold Text is a system-wide change which 
makes all of the text on the device bolder 
and easier to read. When you apply this 
feature, the iPhone will need to restart 
before the change is able to be seen. 
Applying the Bold Text feature will not 
make a huge difference, but it will make 
menu text, etc., easier to read in most cases. 
More Vision 
Settings
LED Flash for Alerts
Phone Noise Cancellation
By using this feature you can reduce the 
ambient noise depending on the side you 
hold your iPhone when you are making or 
receiving calls. Simply move the slider to 
adjust the audio to the right or left side, 
based on how you hold your iPhone. 
Increase Contrast
This will improve the contrast on 
some backgrounds to increase 
the screen’s legibility.
Reduce Motion
This will reduce the motion of 
the user interface, including the 
parallax effect of icons and alerts. 
On/Off Labels
This simply adds a small label to 
any on/off switch, to make it easier 
to check if a setting is enabled. 
From this link hearing aid users can link 
their compatible device directly to their 
iPhone using the Bluetooth connection. 
Users can also enable Hearing Aid mode, 
which may improve the quality of some 
hearing aids. 
By activating this feature when your 
iPhone rings, the ringtone will be 
accompanied with flashing lights from 
the LED camera flash.

Mono Audio
This allows you to change the audio 
output of the iPhone to mono rather than 
stereo, which is useful if you are hard of 
hearing in one ear only. Depending on 
which ear you have difficulties with, you 
can change which channel the audio 
comes from using the slider below the 
switch on the Accessibility Settings page.
Subtitles & Captioning
This feature applies closed captioning or 
subtitles for the deaf or hard of hearing 
on any video or streaming media content 
that supports it. You can choose the 
style of the subtitles in the Accessibility 
Settings menu to suit your preference, or 
you can create your own style. 
Guided Access 
Guided Access helps you to stay focused 
on a task while using your iPhone. Guided 
Access limits your device to a single app 
and lets you control which app features 
are available. You can use Guided Access 
to temporarily restrict your iOS device 
to a particular app, disable areas of the 
screen that aren’t relevant to a task, or 
areas where an accidental gesture might 
cause a distraction and even disable the 
hardware buttons. 
AssistiveTouch
AssistiveTouch helps you use your 
iPhone if you have difficulty touching 
the screen or pressing the buttons. 
You can use AssistiveTouch to perform 
gestures that are difficult for you. You 
can also use a compatible adaptive 
accessory (such as a joystick) together 
with AssistiveTouch to control your 
iOS device.
To enable AssistiveTouch on your 
device, tap Settings > General > 
Accessibility > AssistiveTouch. 
Enable 
Triple-click 
Home 
(three 
consecutive Home button presses) to 
quickly toggle AssistiveTouch on or 
off by tapping Settings > General > 
Accessibility > Triple-click Home. If you 
need to adjust the speed required to 
activate Double and Triple-click Home 
you can go to Settings > General > 
Accessibility > Home-click Speed.
To enable Guided Access, tap Settings > 
General > Accessibility > Guided Access. 
From there you can turn Guided Access on 
or off, set a passcode that controls the use 
of Guided Access and prevents someone 
from leaving an active session, and set 
whether the device can go to sleep during 
a session. To start a Guided Access session, 
open the app you want to run, triple-click 
the Home button and adjust settings for 
the session, then click Start.
This allows you to alter text size, font, text 
colour, opacity and several other settings. 
You can check how the style looks by 
tapping the arrow icon at the top corner 
of the image on the Settings page. 
Home-click Speed
A lot of the accessibility features require 
you to activate them using the Triple-click 
Home method. This can sometimes be 
difficult to perform properly, particularly 
if you have a disability which affects the 
hands and fingers. You can, however, 
change the speed that the button needs 
to be pressed using this option. You can 
choose from default, slow and slowest. 
Accessibility Shortcut
If you have several accessibility options 
enabled, you may need to choose which 
of them is activated when you triple-
click the Home button. Not all of the 
accessibility settings require triple-click, 
but VoiceOver, Invert Colours, Zoom, 
Switch Control and AssistiveTouch all 
do. Simply tap the Accessibility Shortcut 
option and choose the feature you 
want to be able to control using Triple-
click Home. All of the other features can 
still be used, but they will need to be 
controlled using the main Settings rather 
than a shortcut.

Solving Issues with Hardware
Although your iPhone is very reliable, every now and then a problem might occur with your hardware. 
Thankfully they’re usually easy to fix. Here’s a guide to solving some of its more common problems.
With a little bit of tinkering, most problems with the iPhone can be solved by 
the average user. Here’s a guide to fixing some of its more common ailments.
Your Handy iPhone 
Troubleshooting Guide
Restarting the iPhone
If 
you 
notice 
minor 
problems 
with 
your 
iPhone, 
apps 
closing 
for no reason, button 
lag, etc., you should try 
restarting it before you 
try anything else. Hold 
down 
the 
Sleep/Wake 
button until the red slider 
appears and turn the 
phone off. Wait for 30 
seconds and then press 
and hold the Sleep/Wake 
button to turn it back on. 
Resetting the iPhone
If the problem continues, 
try resetting the iPhone. 
Resetting is more drastic 
than restarting. To reset 
the iPhone, press and hold 
the Sleep/Wake button 
and the Home button 
at the same time. Keep 
them both held for at least 
ten seconds, when the 
Apple logo appears and 
the phone then resets to 
factory conditions. 
Fix Home Button Lag
As the only physical button 
on the front of your iPhone, 
the Home button gets used a 
lot. Not only does the button 
return you to the home 
screen but it’s also used 
to access the multitasking 
screen. There can be times 
when it lags or even needs 
a couple of presses before it 
responds. It’s worth trying a 
couple of easy fixes to see if 
they solve the problem.
Sleep/Wake Button 
If the Sleep/Wake button 
does not seem to be 
working as it should, you 
should first try resetting 
the iPhone. Press and hold 
the Sleep/Wake button for 
a few seconds until a red 
slider appears, and then 
slide the slider to turn 
the phone off. Now press 
and hold the Sleep/Wake 
button until the Apple 
logo appears again.

Troubleshooting Calls and Connections
Having trouble making a call or sending a text? Struggling to get your phone to connect to the Internet? 
Here is a step-by-step guide to troubleshooting connection issues. 
Check Your Signal
Check your signal on the status bar. If 
it’s poor, try changing your location. 
Make sure the iPhone isn’t in Airplane 
mode.  If you’re not on Wi-Fi and you 
need the Internet, check your cellular 
data connection next to the carrier 
name at the top of the screen (you 
should see 3G, E or O).
Reinsert Your SIM
Remove the SIM card by inserting a 
SIM eject tool or a paper clip into the 
hole on the SIM tray. Push it straight 
in until the tray pops out. Remove 
the SIM card from the tray, make sure 
it’s clean and put it back in again. 
Push firmly to fully reinsert the tray 
into the slot.
Reset Network Settings
You can also try resetting your 
network settings. Tap Settings > 
General > Reset, then scroll down and 
tap Reset Network Settings. Be aware 
that this will clear your current cellular 
and Wi-Fi network settings, including 
saved networks, Wi-Fi passwords, and 
VPN settings. 
Update Your App
If an app stops working, see if there’s 
an updated version available for your 
iPhone. Open the App Store and tap 
Updates. If updates are available, 
tap Update All. When prompted, 
enter your iTunes Store account 
information to download and install 
the app updates. It’s sometimes worth 
restarting having updated apps.
Force Apps to Close
If a particular app is playing up, you can 
force it to close in a couple of different 
ways. The first and easiest way is to 
double click the Home button, find 
the app in the Multitasking panel that 
opens at the bottom of the screen and 
hold your finger on it until it starts to 
jiggle. Tap the delete icon that appears 
in the top corner to close the app. 
Verify iOS Requirements
To make sure the app is compatible 
with your iPhone software, check the 
requirements in the App Store and 
check your iOS version using Settings 
> General > About. If the app requires 
a newer version of the iOS than the 
one you are using, you’ll have to 
update iOS on your iPhone before you 
can update your app.
