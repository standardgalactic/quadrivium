The Spanish 
Civil War in a 
European Context
W
hy does the Spanish Civil War, a conflict 
that officially ended 80 years ago, still 
divide historians and the population at 
large? And beyond Spain, what can a single case tell 
us about civil wars and about Europe on the brink of 
the most destructive war in its history? This course 
aims to answer these questions in five sections. In 
the first section, we look at the war’s origins. The 
second explores the internal dynamics of the war. In 
the third, we analyze why and how the war attracted 
the attention of most of the great powers. Fourth, we 
follow the evolution of the war itself. And finally, we 
examine the afterlife of the war in public memory and 
history.

A Failed Coup Becomes a War
In July 1936, Spanish military leaders conspired to overthrow the 
democratically elected Spanish Republic. Their stated goal was to restore 
order and authority to what they claimed was an unraveling political 
system. With the aid of Nazi planes, they launched an audacious airlift of 
colonial troops from Morocco to the mainland, accompanied by violent 
uprisings across the country as the rebels called on all the military garrisons 
in Spain to join them. They expected this show of force to bring the 
Republic to its knees without a fight.
Instead, a combination of loyal troops and hastily organized volunteer 
militia units defeated the uprising in most but not all places. Within 
a couple of weeks, it was clear that neither side had been completely 
victorious or defeated. Soon there were two armies and two states claiming 
sovereignty over Spain.
What began as a failed coup turned into a three-year-long total war that 
would not officially end until April 1939, just months before the Nazi 
invasion of Poland signaled the outbreak of the Second World War. It 
would leave few Spaniards unscathed.
In political terms, it ended the Second Republic, Spain’s first major 
democratic experiment, and inaugurated a 40-year repressive right-wing 
regime that lasted until the late 1970s. It left the legacy of a fratricidal 
conflict that continues to shape current politics and society.
The civil war has often been viewed as simply a dress rehearsal for the 
bigger European struggle between communism, democracy, and fascism. 
It was one of several civil wars on Europe’s periphery in the first half of the 
20th century, but it was also its own internal Spanish conflict that emerged 
out of the particular problems of Spanish history. Even decades later, the 
civil war still inflames passions and scholarly debates.
Indeed, the Spanish Civil War is the key turning point in what we can call 
competing moral narratives, which are stories that make sense of the past to 
explain the present and provide a road map to the future. The conservative 
moral narrative argues that the rebels saved Spain and Christian civilization 
from communist totalitarianism. The left version insists that a fascist

victory pushed Spain off the path of modernity for the next 40 years. Both 
narratives are alive in Spain today, and there’s no consensus narrative about 
the significance of the Spanish Civil War or the lessons learned.
Early Colonial Pacification Campaigns
Spain’s civil war fit into a trajectory of increasingly lethal military 
operations that began in the colonial world in the late 19th century and 
inside Europe in the First World War, culminating in the Second World 
War. Scholars have used the term total war to define this trend toward these 
kinds of military conflicts. In the purest terms, a truly total war would be 
“without limits.”
The descent into total warfare was characterized by new weapons of mass 
destruction, from the machine gun to aerial bombing, gas chambers, and 
nuclear bombs. At the same time, the vilification of the enemy in radical 
exclusionary terms justified the growing civilianization of warfare, in which 
noncombatants became direct targets.
When did this total war dynamic begin? Some scholars emphasize the 
brutalizing impact of colonial pacification campaigns from the end of 
the 19th century, which included mass killings and herding subjugated 
populations into concentration camps. In German southwest Africa, the 
suppression between 1904 and 1907 of a revolt by Herero tribespeople 
against the colonial power resulted in the death of between 75% and 80% 
of the population.
In Spanish-controlled Cuba, the colonial government tried to crush the 
independence movement of the late 1890s with a brutal pacification 
campaign that included the massive, forced relocation of half a million 
people into camps, resulting in the deaths of up to 170,000 civilians.
During the Second Boer War between 1899 to 1902, British armies 
employed a scorched-earth policy to eradicate the human and matériel 
support infrastructure for the enemy’s guerrilla war. To this end, the British 
forces depopulated entire regions.

In these colonial spaces, a combination of biological racism and lack of 
oversight created special conditions that precipitated mass killing and 
the death of noncombatants. It is compelling to see these “dirty wars” as 
precedents that eased the path for future escalation in Europe itself.
Dynamic of Destruction
Within Europe, it was the battlefield experience of World War I, where 
tens of thousands of men could die in a day, that transgressed the former 
boundaries of warfare. Some have argued that the normalization of 
mass death brutalized both the veterans and the home front, creating 
a permanent war culture that normalized violent solutions to political 
problems after the war. This war culture then seeped into postwar politics, 
the argument goes, and encouraged exclusionary radical political projects 
like fascism and communism that accepted the elimination of the “other” 
as a legitimate goal.
The first half of the 20th century saw an unfolding “dynamic of 
destruction,” a concept coined by the historian Alan Kramer in his book 
about the First World War. This dynamic transformed the face of warfare 
toward ever greater devastation and death. Even though Spain did not 
participate in the two world wars, its civil war drew from and exemplified 
this dynamic, perhaps most evident in the accelerating violence against 
civilians. In terms of civilian casualties, the Spanish Civil War holds an 
intermediate place between the First and Second World Wars.
What explains this explosion of mass killing? The radicalizing dynamic 
of warfare itself is one factor. This was evident even in the fascist states 
of Nazi Germany and Italy, where civilian killings skyrocketed under the 
loosened constraints of wartime. Some of this radicalization emerged from 
the decisions made on the ground, whether in the Spanish Republican rear 
guard or in the German army on the Russian front in World War II. Fear, 
peer pressure, hatred, and the suspension of normal authority opened the 
floodgates. Civilian deaths tended to be higher in situations where state 
power had either collapsed or weakened.

1. The Spanish Civil War in a European Context
In the wake of the exhumations and the identification of at least 2,000 
mass graves, the question of how to name the mass violence has become 
especially pertinent. Some historians have described the repression as a 
war of extermination, genocide, or holocaust. Others have argued that 
terms like terror, crimes against humanity, war of occupation, or politicide 
can communicate the level of repression with greater precision, without 
minimizing it.
Because the dictatorship covered up its 
atrocities for 40 years, the full extent 
of the brutality of the Spanish war has 
only emerged in recent years. Most recent 
estimates put the number of executions 
by the Nationalists between 130,000 and 
150,000, about 100,000 of these during the 
war, with 50,000 to 60,000 carried out by 
the Republican side.

In comparative terms, scholars still argue about whether the Nazi genocidal 
project belongs to its own category of mass violence that emerged out of a 
process of extreme radicalization unique to the Nazi state. The other option 
is that it was on a continuum of the escalating violence of total warfare that 
began with the Herero massacre. Using terms like holocaust and genocide 
would imply at least continuity and perhaps affiliation with the Nazi 
project. Rejecting those terms would acknowledge the novelty and rupture 
of Nazi violence.
International Intervention
The mass murder in Spain was distinct from the Nazi case because it took 
place in the context of a civil war, which generated its own violent logic. 
While civil wars were not new, the trend toward total war transformed the 
dynamics of civil wars in the 20th century. They took place in peripheral 
countries and sparked external intervention or involvement that was linked 
to the broader geopolitical and ideological struggles of the era.
These civil wars exemplified the struggle between left-wing revolution, 
liberal democracy, and authoritarianism or fascism. There were complex 
alliances where popular front coalitions between liberal democrats and 
revolutionaries complicated the left-right paradigm. These alliances also 
generated a field of experimentation that blurred the boundaries between 
democracy and socialism.
Scholars still debate whether the popular front in Spain or elsewhere 
offered an unprecedented path to an inclusive “new style” social democracy, 
or whether it was simply a camouflage for Stalinist revolution, or perhaps 
an unstable tension between both forces. This debate influenced the great 
powers’ decision to intervene or not.
In both Spain and Greece, the Western democratic powers saw revolution, 
not popular democracy, in their popular fronts. Only during the Yugoslavian 
civil war of 1941 to 1943, when anti-fascist Soviet and Western powers were 
briefly allied, did the international context favor intervention on behalf of 
the popular front forces. In all of these wars, external intervention or a lack 
thereof was a decisive element in determining the victor.

Unique Elements of the Spanish Civil War
Of all these civil wars, the Spanish Civil War was the only one with a 
purely domestic origin. And a key source of this strife was rooted in a 
religious war between Catholics and anticlericals, which produced the 
most religious violence of any of the civil wars. The war itself also unfolded 
as a conventional military operation, which sets it apart from the largely 
guerrilla struggle in Greece and Yugoslavia.
Equally significant was the distinct context in which the Spanish Civil War 
ended in 1939. At war’s end, the right-wing regime that had won was under 
no pressure to pursue an inclusive postwar settlement, either from its fascist 
allies or from the democratic powers, whose attention was turned to the 
outbreak of war in Poland.
After the end of World War II, supporters of the overthrown Republic hoped 
the Allied powers would intervene in their favor, but their last hopes were 
dashed. Instead, Spain would break with the trajectory of post–World War II 
Western democratic Europe and join Portugal and later Greece in a southern 
European zone of right-wing dictatorship that lasted until the 1970s.
Even among the southern European dictatorships, the Spanish regime had 
a more profound legacy of violence and repression because of its origin in a 
civil war. Thus, the Spanish trajectory was closer to the Russian experience 
of civil war and left-wing dictatorship than it was to the other right-wing 
southern European dictatorships, which did not emerge out of civil wars. 
Because of these circumstances, Spain’s civil war did not really end in April 
1939 when the fighting stopped. Some would argue it didn’t really end 
until the death of the dictator decades later.

Two Spains? 
Long-Term Origins 
of War
I
n this lecture, we delve into the preexisting 
cleavages that were rooted in Spain’s own unique 
past. We consider the role that differing views on 
national identity, modernization, and religion played 
in the origin of the civil war. And we look at the 
peninsula’s geography to see how these divisions 
showed up in the years leading up to the war.

2. Two Spains? Long-Term Origins of War

Two Spains
In 1922, when King Alfonso XIII visited a poor village in rural Spain, he 
reportedly said that he was horrified and could see no more. His visit gives 
us an image of two vastly different Spains existing in uneasy parallel—the 
modern, urban monarch in marked contrast to an impoverished rural 
landscape that he had never seen.
Fifteen years later, during the civil war, Ernest Hemingway and other 
foreign supporters of the Republic made a documentary, The Spanish Earth, 
that showed the modern irrigation system that the Republic was installing 
to lift people out of poverty. The implicit message was that the Republic 
represented the forces of modern Spain that were fighting a noble struggle 
against an arrogant, traditional elite resistant to change and indifferent to 
the fate of those that had been left behind in premodern squalor.
These images of Spain before and during civil war thematically echo 
what has been, until recently, the dominant explanation for the war. It 
identifies a process of flawed development and long-term divisions that led 
inevitably to the civil war of the 1930s. This long-term view was rooted 
in a pessimistic vision of modern Spanish history following the Spanish-
American War.
In that conflict, Spain lost its last major colonies to the United States in the 
humiliating so-called disaster of 1898. The Generation of ’98 interpreted 
the US victory as evidence of Spanish decadence and backwardness. Spain 
had failed to follow the normal path of modernization and was losing its 
status as a global and imperial power.
Inside Spain, critics bemoaned the 
existence of “two Spains,” one more 
modern and the other still steeped 
in tradition, who were divided by 
geography, class, religion, politics, and 
two ways of life—rural and urban. The 
metaphor of the two Spains stuck, and 
the civil war only seemed to confirm the 
diagnosis.
Most historians 
today would argue 
that the two sides 
in the Spanish Civil 
War didn’t really 
consolidate until 
the war itself 
forced everyone to 
align themselves. 

11
2. Two Spains? Long-Term Origins of War
But the metaphor doesn’t really hold up as an origin story for the civil war. 
There were never really two coherent Spains. That division is more of a 
product of the war than its cause. But postwar historians tended to read 
backward from the end of the war when the country really was divided 
into victors and vanquished—a binary division that the Franco regime 
continually reinforced for the next four decades.
Competing Identities
In general, scholars are more skeptical that any complex event was caused 
only by long-term structural factors; instead, they could only be part 
of a multifactorial analysis that has to explain the specific context in 
which deep-rooted divisions are mobilized for war. The challenge, then, 
is to weigh the importance of long-term versus short-term causes in the 
breakdown of Spain’s democracy, while acknowledging that both played 
a role.
One way to approach this issue starts with the scholarly debates about what 
factors aid or undermine the consolidation of new democratic regimes. 
Can democratic institutions hold together populations divided by religion, 
cultural values, ethnic and racial identities, and economic inequality? These 
cleavages might not lead inevitably to civil war. But structural divisions 
make it easier for political opponents to mobilize around competing 
identities and fears that their way of life is under threat if the other side 
wins an election.
In the 19th century, conservatives rejected the idea that Spain had 
to modernize. They were proud of a traditional identity rooted in 
Catholicism, monarchy, and the heroic religious conquest of Spain from 
the Moorish rulers in the medieval era. Liberals like the Generation of 
’98 argued that this Catholic identity was part of an archaic past that was 
holding Spain back. Instead, Spain’s future lay in the modern political ideas 
from the French Revolution, epitomized by the 1812 Constitution of Cádiz, 
Spain’s first democratic constitution.

2. Two Spains? Long-Term Origins of War
12
After the war, the battling national histories continued. The conservative 
victors who established the Franco dictatorship argued that they had 
fought the war to defend a traditional Spain rooted in rural and Christian 
values, whose way of life was under threat from an enemy that pretended 
to be Spanish but was really the puppet of international communism. This 
framework served the Franco regime well as it reinvented itself during the 
Cold War as an anti-communist ally of the West.
The alternative narrative among the defeated accepted the general two-
Spains framework but viewed the defeat through the structural lens of 
Spain’s so-called failed modernization. That modernization in Spain was 
being held back from within purportedly explained the greater strength of 
the anti-modern forces in the civil war.
The liberal version of this narrative assumed that there was a uniform 
process of becoming modern. Spain’s failure to follow the “normal” path 
of economic and social development weakened the modern political forces 
and explained their defeat in the civil war.

13
2. Two Spains? Long-Term Origins of War
Uneven Development
The most recent consensus on economic development in Spain over 
the century before the civil war is that there was uneven and gradual 
development rather than backwardness or failure to develop. If we look 
at the entire European context, Spain followed an intermediate pace 
of industrialization, urbanization, and technological development that 
accelerated in the decades before the Republic of the 1930s.
The unevenness of Spain’s process likely did contribute to structural 
divisions. Industrialization was concentrated in three main regions: 
Asturias, the Basque Country, and Catalonia. In the process, each of these 
regions produced many of the classic features of modernization. Urban 
centers grew. A commercial and industrial middle and upper class emerged, 
as well as a large working class. Many of the latter joined trade unions to 
defend their interests, as occurred across Europe. In addition, these areas 
had higher levels of literacy, education, and living standards, but with 
strong class divisions in the quality of life.
A more unusual feature of these areas is that they are all located on the 
geographic periphery. This fact helped to consolidate a more binary image 
of the two Spains, divided into a modern periphery that was open to the 
outside world and an isolated backward center resistant to change.

14
Divisions within the Heartland
There is an element of truth to the center-versus-periphery metaphor. The 
interior of the country was largely rural and agricultural, and Spain’s arid 
climate and low rainfall kept agricultural productivity low, which served as 
a contrast to the more dynamic industrial periphery.
Where the metaphor breaks down is that there were also deep divisions 
within the rural and agricultural heartland. In simple terms, there were 
two main types of agrarian communities, defined by distinct landholding 
patterns. In the center and north of the peninsula, in Castille and Leon, 
small and medium-sized farms dominated. Here, generally prosperous rural 
communities enjoyed higher standards of living and literacy and were held 
together by strong Catholic beliefs.
In contrast, the southwestern agricultural regions of Extremadura and 
Andalusia were dominated by huge properties, or latifundia, which 
were owned by a small number of wealthy landowners who hired 
landless laborers, or braceros, to work the land. Low wages and seasonal 
employment created the worst conditions for workers in any area of Spain, 
as well as the greatest level of inequality and poverty. Many braceros 
embraced revolutionary politics and rejected the Catholic Church as being 
complicit in upholding the status quo.
The Spanish Republic came into power in 1931 with a mission to solve the 
agrarian problem. The stark disparity between the pious wealthy farmers 
of the North and the anticlerical landless laborers of the South made for 
divisive structural knots that were hard to untangle.
Religious Divisions
Compared to the other European civil wars of the 20th century, religious 
violence in the Spanish Civil War was far more extensive. This might seem 
puzzling at first, if we consider that governments since the 15th century 
had successfully extinguished religious pluralism from the peninsula. 

15
2. Two Spains? Long-Term Origins of War
But there was never any effort to separate church and state as in the US 
Constitution. So how did such an apparently unifying feature of Spanish 
culture become one of its most divisive by the 1930s?
The backdrop of the story is the global rift that opened in Europe with the 
French Revolution, between new secular liberal democratic politics and a 
Catholic Church that increasingly allied itself with absolutist, aristocratic, 
and anti-liberal forces throughout the 19th century. This rift had very 
different political implications depending on the balance of religious and 
political forces in each country. The Spanish case was distinct in that the 
church maintained its close relationship with the Spanish state until the 
Second Republic.
The problem was that the more the church was associated with the 
conservative monarchical Spanish state, the less it seemed to represent 
those left out of an elitist and hierarchical system. Many Spaniards who 
considered themselves political progressives or reformers increasingly 
viewed the church as an archaic political institution that was holding Spain 
back from progress.
This growing alienation expressed itself in a decline in religiosity 
among these populations. More aggressively, an underground culture of 
anticlericalism permeated opposition newspapers and ran the gamut of 
political persuasion, from Republicans to socialists to anarchists. There 
were a few outbreaks of anticlerical violence before the 1930s.
Anticlericalism was not about banning 
religious practice or supporting atheism; 
it aimed to mitigate what they viewed 
as the excessive power of the clerics 
in public life. Anticlericals agreed 
that Spain could never fully modernize 
while the church maintained its grip on 
political and public life. A lot of their 
propaganda and cartoons demonized clerics.

Conclusion
What seems uncontestable is that these preexisting cleavages made it more 
difficult for the democratic Republic to unify a working majority that 
could stabilize and consolidate the democracy. And when the war broke 
out, these same divisions predisposed Spaniards to pick sides. Those who 
lived in urban areas of the periphery or belonged to the working classes 
sympathized with the Republican side, while practicing Catholics, farmers, 
and the upper classes were more likely to favor the Nationalist side.
But what the structural rifts don’t explain are the political decisions that 
pushed toward polarization and led the rebels to take up arms against 
a legitimate elected government. In the scholarly debates about why 
democracies fail, most would emphasize human agency over structural 
factors.
Thus, while it’s easy to look back from 1936 and assume that all the 
cleavages foregrounded by the war made it inevitable, human actors made 
the decisions that augmented and mobilized these cleavages into mandates 
for civil war. In the next lecture, we’ll turn to these short-term origins of 
the war.

Origins of War
T
his lecture examines the five-year period 
leading up to the Spanish Civil War. It outlines 
the competing visions and agendas for the 
new democracy and the conflicts and resistance that 
resulted. The process of progressive polarization 
culminated in the fraught elections of 1936, which 
were framed as a life-and-death showdown between 
fascism and democracy, according to the left coalition, 
or between Christian civilization and communism, 
according to conservatives.

3. The Second Republic: Short-Term Origins of War
Spain’s New Democracy
On April 14, 1931, celebrations across 
Spain marked the inauguration of a 
democratic Republic. King Alfonso 
XIII had hoped to restore the 
constitutional monarchy following a 
period of rule by a dictator. But the 
elections saw an overwhelming vote 
against monarchist candidates and 
for political parties that promised 
democracy and a Republic. The king 
resigned and left the country, dying in 
exile a decade later.
The Second Republic was proclaimed, 
and national elections were held in 
June to choose a new parliament that 
would write a democratic constitution. 
So, what happened between 1931 
and 1936 that pushed the democracy to the edge of civil war? How did the 
decisions made by leaders and other political actors affect the ability of the 
new democracy to consolidate?
To consolidate, a democracy needs to create an institutional framework 
that a solid majority believes represents their interests and aspirations. 
Equally, the people have to be willing to accept defeat if their party loses 
the election, because they trust that the system will give them another 
opportunity in the future. In political science lingo, the major political 
parties have to be “unconditionally” committed to the procedural “rules 
of the game,” whatever their substantive goals, as Juan Linz argued in his 
classic 1978 study on democratic breakdown. In other words, there’s a 
distinction between the mechanics and procedures, on which there has to 
be broad agreement, and the specific policies and laws, on which groups 
can disagree.

Applying these criteria to the Second Republic, we can see many red 
flags: First, the constitution was written by and for one political sector 
of the population; second, most of the major political parties were only 
conditional supporters of the democratic system; and third, no political 
group could construct a stable majority coalition.
The First Biennium
The Republic is usually divided into three periods, each inaugurated by 
national elections: the first in June 1931, the second in November 1933, 
and the third in February 1936. There were efforts in the first and second 
periods, or biennia, to establish alternative majority coalitions that could 
consolidate the democracy, but neither held together.
The First Biennium was defined by the ambitious social reform agenda 
of the majority center-left coalition, which included women’s rights, 
universal education, land reform, worker rights, regional autonomy, and 
secularization. The coalition included a number of small Republican 
parties, the most important led by the new prime minister, Manuel Azaña, 
as well as the Socialist Party, which received the most votes. The Socialist 
Party’s conditional support of the democratic system was based on the 
substance of its policies.
Manuel Azaña was the epitome of the progressive intellectual. He identified 
three problems to be addressed: the problem of local autonomies, the social 
problem, and the religious problem. The mission of the First Biennium 
coalition was to transform Spain “to its roots,” but through democratic 
means, using both the constitution and subsequent legislation.
Resolving the problem of local autonomies meant giving regions like 
Catalonia and the Basque Country their own regional governments with 
some delegated powers, like the states in the US federal system. Resolving 
the social problem required reducing the huge gap between rich and 
poor. And the religious problem, which referred to the church’s excessive 
influence in Spanish public institutions, would be addressed by a process of 
secularization.

3. The Second Republic: Short-Term Origins of War
Rejections to the Constitution
For those in the center-left coalition, the agenda included fundamental 
reforms necessary to democratize and modernize the country. But for those 
outside the coalition, the constitution was “exclusive” and “intolerant,” with 
devout Catholics feeling most excluded. Many conservative clerics rejected 
even the basic propositions of modern democracies.
The upper classes also felt threatened and excluded by the worker-focused 
constitution and the Socialist-led labor legislation that was explicitly 
indifferent or even hostile to the capitalist bourgeois class. And while the 
Republican coalition didn’t set out to exclude the significant population of 
small employers and farmers, their invisibility in the pro-worker and anti-
capitalist rhetoric made them feel marginalized and vulnerable.
It’s easy to see in these excluded groups the constituency of the new 
conservative party called the CEDA, formed in 1933 as a political voice for 
these interests. The bigger question is whether these groups could trust that 
the constitutional framework was flexible enough to accommodate their 
interests.
Although the agenda of the First Biennium leaders excluded some groups, 
it was a powerful vision that perhaps did represent a majority. But equally 
importantly, the First Biennium failed to consolidate a majority coalition 
because it couldn’t meet the high expectations of its own constituents, 
particularly its working-class voters.
The First Biennium’s new constitution 
ended state funding for the church and 
ordered the closure of religious schools, 
to be replaced with a new universal 
system of public and secular education. 
For the first time, there was no mention 
or acknowledgment of the special role of 
Catholicism in the Spanish nation. 

3. The Second Republic: Short-Term Origins of War
22
Here’s where both the structural divisions between rich and poor and 
the conditional support of the Socialist Party converged. The Socialist 
Party staked its participation in the democratic government on delivering 
substantive improvements for its working-class members. But in a country 
like Spain with a high level of poverty and inequality, it’s difficult to 
achieve a dramatic transformation within the plodding pace of a multiparty 
parliamentary system. The agrarian reform that angered and terrified 
owners didn’t deliver for the workers either, and other factors contributed to 
limited concrete improvements for many workers’ lives.
Not surprisingly, some of those workers questioned the promise of the 
social democracy that was at the heart of the First Biennium agenda. It 
was easy to imagine the power of revolution to create a new economically 
egalitarian society designed by and for workers, embodied by the idealized 
vision of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. The Socialist Party itself was 
internally divided about the evolutionary versus revolutionary paths. That’s 
precisely what made them conditional supporters of democracy in the 
interwar era.
Another working-class organization, the anarcho-syndicalist CNT, both 
competed with the Socialists for followers and advocated a more aggressive 
strategy of pressuring the Republic with strikes and insurrections. It was 
divided between radicals and reformists, who were willing to work with the 
democratic state if it could deliver basic reforms. Relationships between the 
Socialists and the CNT were very complex, but the main point is that the 
reformist or social democratic wings of the worker movements would be 
bolstered or weakened by tangible social results that significantly improved 
the workers’ standard of living.
The Second Biennium
The collapse of the Socialist-Republican coalition around these tensions 
led to the elections of November 1933 and the Second Biennium. Now 
a center-right government would take over, with an opportunity to build 
an alternative majority coalition of all the groups excluded in the First 
Biennium.

23
3. The Second Republic: Short-Term Origins of War
The largest party was the newly created CEDA, the Confederación 
Española de Derechas Autónomas, or “Spanish Confederation of the 
Autonomous Right,” led by José María Gil Robles. The CEDA was 
another conditional party, non-Republican but willing to work within a 
democratic republic as long as it reflected their priorities. Among them 
were a “complete revision” of the constitution, gutting social reforms, 
and maintaining Spain’s official Catholic identity by protecting religious 
education, religious orders, and restoring state funding of the church.
At the same time, there was an ultra-conservative flank of the party that 
admired Mussolini and imitated fascist language and images. The self-
defined fascist party, the Falange, received only a handful of votes and 
played little role until the civil war.
The other main party in this center-right coalition was the Radical 
Republican Party, led by Alejandro Lerroux. This was a solidly liberal 
democratic party with a base of middle- and lower-middle-class employers 
and businessmen who were frightened by socialism but perhaps more urban 
and less fervent Catholics than the rural and religious CEDA voters.
In many ways, the Second Biennium’s problems were the mirror image 
of the first. The governing coalition was internally divided, and its 
policies inflamed and mobilized the opposition parties. The Socialists 
tried to launch a national insurrection in October 1934, to defend the 
“true” Republic against what they exaggerated as the “fascist” direction 
of the conservative government. The insurrection was a failure, and the 
aftermath, which included a brutal repression by the government, helped 
reunite the left coalition in preparation for the next election.
On the other side of the political spectrum, conservatives interpreted the 
insurrection as an attempted communist revolution. That perspective also 
helped mobilize their voters and raise the stakes in the next election. But 
the center-right coalition also had its internal weaknesses.
And finally, the CEDA did little to stabilize a conservative democratic 
majority. Instead, its ambivalent rhetoric defended authoritarianism as 
a legitimate alternative to impose its agenda of “religion, the fatherland, 
the family, order, property, and work” against the exaggerated threat of 
communist disorder.

24
Polarized Political Landscape
In the final election of the Republic in February 1936, Spanish voters were 
faced with a polarized choice between two major coalitions. The right 
claimed to defend Christian civilization against atheism and communism, 
while the left popular front claimed to defend democracy against fascism, 
even though there were few self-defined fascists or communists in Spain at 
that point.
In a closely divided election, the left coalition won, but it was never able to 
consolidate a government. Many workers had lost patience with waiting for 
the slow process of government reforms to kick in, and some took matters 
into their own hands, declaring collective ownership of large farms through 
direct occupation. Public order was also disrupted by urban labor conflicts, 
anticlerical violence against church property, and street battles between 
fascist and left-wing groups.
Much of the defeated opposition were not willing to abide by the 
democratic rules of the game from the outset. The CEDA had only 
promised to collaborate with a democracy that was to its liking, and 
after its defeat, support for the CEDA plummeted. The military began 
conspiring to overthrow the Republic right after the election. Others began 
to shift from the CEDA to fill the ranks of what had been, up to that point, 
the tiny fascist Falange.
It’s appropriate to ask whether it was plausible in the context of the 
experimental democracies of the 1930s—or Spain’s own deep structural 
divisions—to expect them to have followed the rules of the game. The 
friction between long-term structural cleavages and short-term political 
actions that excluded and demonized opponents eventually created a 
polarized environment. Each side believed that their entire way of life was 
at stake.
The big hypothetical question is whether they could have worked it out if 
the military had not stepped in. The conservative narrative promoted by 
the military leaders asserted that the democracy was in free fall, on the edge 
of communist revolution. The left narrative puts full blame on the military 
coup as the proximate cause of the war. We’ll turn to that next time.

The Opening 
Act: 1936’s 
Military Coup
O
n July 17, 1936, the military garrisons in the 
Spanish colonial outposts in Morocco rose 
in revolt against the Republican government. 
Days later, a number of military garrisons within Spain 
joined the revolt. But not all went as planned. Some 
uprisings were defeated by a combination of worker 
militias and loyal police and military units. Within a 
couple of weeks, it was clear that the coup had failed, 
leaving a divided territory. In this lecture, we look 
at how the coup came together and why it failed, 
unleashing civil war.

4. The Opening Act: 1936’s Military Coup
Francisco Franco was 
promoted to the rank of 
general in 1922, at the age 
of 33—the youngest general 
in Europe since Napoleon.
Key Military Conspirators
After declaring support for the 
coup that began on July 17, General 
Francisco Franco flew to Morocco to 
take charge of the Spanish colonial 
Army of Africa. On July 24, the 
insurgents constituted the Junta de 
Defensa Nacional, “National Defense 
Committee,” in the city of Burgos, 
to “assume all the powers of the State 
and be the legitimate representative of 
the country to foreign powers.”
Francisco Franco
Francisco Franco
The conspiracy was a fundamentally military operation, organized by 
a group of military leaders led by General Emilio Mola. They had been 
meeting since just after the February popular front election, which brought 
the left coalition to power. The older officers, like Gonzalo Queipo 
de Llano, Joaquín Fanjul, and José Sanjurjo, had fought against the 
independence of Cuba in 1896 to 1898, while younger ones, like Emilio 
Mola, Manuel Goded, and Francisco Franco, earned their promotions in 
battle in the Rif War in Morocco in the 1910s and early 1920s.
The colonial connections of this younger group of conspirators secured 
the loyalty of the Army of Africa, 40,000 troops stationed in Morocco 
in July of 1936. It was the best-trained and most disciplined division in 
the Spanish army. While the networks and loyalties among this group of 
conspirators were key to the organizing momentum of the coup, it also 
benefited from broader discontent within the military.

4. The Opening Act: 1936’s Military Coup
28
Opposition to the Republic among sectors of the military had been 
growing since the First Biennium, provoked by a combination of 
professional grievances, conservative monarchist politics, and Spanish 
nationalism. Many military members also bristled against the 
reorganization of the military, which aimed to bring it more firmly under 
civilian control and reduce what Prime Minister Azaña believed was a 
top-heavy officer corps.
The military had a long history of intervention in politics that began in 
the early 19th century, when most changes of government were sparked 
by a so-called pronunciamiento, literally “pronouncement.” Army leaders 
announced that they had withdrawn their support for the current 
administration and insisted on the formation of a new civilian government, 
but from the opposing party. The pronunciamiento tradition was, therefore, 
different from what we would call a military coup today, in which the army 
overthrows a civilian government and sets up a military dictatorship.
In the First Biennium, Prime Minister Azaña’s military reforms sparked 
discontent. Monarchists and military leaders joined in an early coup 
attempt in August 1932, led by General José Sanjurjo. The coup was easily 
defeated, and Sanjurjo and Manuel Goded, among other leaders, were 
imprisoned and relieved of their posts. But during the Second Biennium, 
leaders amnestied all of the conspirators and reinstated most of them in 
their positions.
In October 1934, Goded, along with General Franco, led the brutal 
military operation to repress the left-wing rebellion in Asturias, which fed 
a conservative narrative that the Republic was unraveling as a result of left-
wing chaos. The conservative CEDA leader Gil Robles was named Minister 
of War in 1935, and from his position, he nominated a number of right-
wing military officers to key positions, including appointing Franco as the 
Chief of the General Staff. Lower down the ranks, a clandestine military 
organization called the Spanish Military Union, or UME, had formed at 
the end of 1933, which expressed many of the same grievances.

Planning the Coup
The military conspirators were another group of conditional supporters of 
the rules of the game, who withdrew their support from the institutions of 
the Republic when their political candidates lost. The key turning point 
was the February 1936 elections.
A core group, including Franco and Mola, met on March 8 to “agree on a 
rising to re-establish internal order and the international prestige of Spain.” 
It’s important to note that, at this point, there was no single leader among 
the half a dozen or so top generals. Over the next few months, other key 
military leaders like Gonzalo Queipo de Llano, head of the Carabinero 
forces, or border police, were brought on board to launch simultaneous 
uprisings in military garrisons across the country. Another conspirator was 
General Sanjurjo, who was not directly involved in the planning since he 
was living in exile in Portugal due to his role in the 1932 failed coup.
In addition, the conspirators negotiated to gain the support of nonmilitary 
right-wing organizations like the Carlists and the Falange, each of which 
included paramilitary forces. Since the February election, the Falange, 
which was the small fascist party, had been growing with conservatives who 
abandoned legitimate political parties after they were defeated. Falangists 
and Carlists each had very different goals and visions for the future, but 
they shared an opposition to the Republic.
By the end of June, most of the plans were in place, and the militias stood 
by, awaiting the call to arms. The popular front Republican government 
knew there was danger of a military revolt, and the new government tried 
to reverse some of the right-wing appointments that Gil Robles had made. 
Franco was fired as Chief of the General Staff and posted to the Canary 
Islands. Goded was sent to the Balearic Islands and Mola to Pamplona. 
Joaquín Fanjul was left without any post, living in Madrid. But these 
moves did not deter the conspiracy, and the Republican government 
did not follow up with more concrete measures to defend itself against a 
possible military defection.

The Final Spark
The final spark that convinced the plotters to act was the political 
assassination of an important right-wing politician, José Calvo Sotelo, on 
July 13, by members of the Republican Assault Guard in Madrid. The 
murder was an act of revenge for the killing of one of their Assault Guard 
colleagues, José del Castillo, the day before.
Between February and July 13, historians have identified at least 250 deaths 
due to this type of political violence, which fed the conspirators’ narrative 
of unraveling public order and chaos, even though their own followers 
contributed to the violence. What seems clear from the outset is that the 
military leaders were following in the long tradition of military intervention 
to “save” Spain from purported chaos and inept politicians, but they had no 
clear vision for the future.
Following the successful uprising of the colonial army in Morocco on July 
17, commanders across the peninsula led their garrisons to rise up and 
support the call to rebel. Goded, Fanjul, and Mola led uprisings in their 
locations of exile.
About a third of all garrisons successfully rebelled, while the rest either 
remained loyal or were defeated in battle. Fanjul in Madrid and Goded, 
now in Barcelona, were captured in the initial battles that defeated the 
rebels, and both were tried and shot in August of 1936. It was expected 
that General Sanjurjo would return to Spain and take command of the 
rebellion. Instead, his plane exploded on the runway in Portugal.
At the July 24 convocation of the Junta de Defensa Nacional, the two 
remaining senior generals, Mola and Franco, were each given command 
of the main armies in the North and the South. Crucial to the viability 
of the army of the South was the colonial Army of Africa, under Franco’s 
command but still on the other side of the Strait of Gibraltar.
On July 26, representatives of the Junta met with Hitler and other Nazi 
officials in Germany to ask for help in transporting these troops to the 
peninsula. Although the air force leader, Goering, was apparently not 

31
4. The Opening Act: 1936’s Military Coup
enthusiastic, Hitler was and approved the purchase of planes. From July 29, 
the planes made as many as four flights a day from Morocco over several 
months, carrying out the first big military airlift in history.
The Nazi foreign aid was even more essential once it was clear that the 
coup had failed. A successful coup would have left the rebels in control 
of the Spanish state and government, along with all of its financial and 
institutional resources. But the Republican government in Madrid had 
defeated the uprising in the capital and still maintained about two-thirds 
of the territory and most of the population and industry when the dust 
settled from the initial rebellions. So, the rebels, despite their claims to be 
the “legitimate representative,” were an outlaw force that would depend 
on loans and credit from friendly powers, in this case fascist Italy and 
Germany.
Why Did the Coup Fail?
The simple answer to why the coup failed is that, despite the high-ranking 
defections, the military and police forces, such as the Civil Guard and 
the Assault Guards, turned out to be deeply divided about the coup. As a 
result, the outcome of the uprisings in each location closely correlated with 
the position taken by the local troops and police units.
Some historians argue that without the 
initial infusion of the Army of Africa, 
the coup would have failed altogether. 
According to this plausible claim, the 
foreign aid from the Nazi regime was an 
essential factor in their victory, almost 
literally from the first day.

4. The Opening Act: 1936’s Military Coup
32
Another less easily measured factor in the partial Republican victory was 
the support of the local population. There has been a long-held heroic 
myth that the ad hoc militias were the decisive element in early Republican 
victories, but most historians now agree that the military impact of 
these untrained volunteer units was secondary at most. In Republican 
strongholds like Sevilla and Zaragoza, where enthusiastic worker militias 
tried to fend off a united military assault, they were crushed. But in 
Valencia and Madrid, where militias collaborated with police and loyal 
troops, the uprisings were easily defeated.
In general, the uprising succeeded in the conservative agrarian heartland 
where the right-wing coalition had won large majorities, while it failed 
in most major cities, industrial centers, and coastal regions, which voted 
for the left. This tell us is that the military uprising did not emerge out of 
nowhere. It reflected and amplified both the short-term political and the 
long-term structural cleavages of a divided Spain.
At the same time, deep divisions alone do not automatically lead to 
civil war. It was the military conspirators’ decision to renounce the 
constitutional rules of the game, requiring them to defend the existing 
legal order, that ultimately doomed the fragile new democracy. Their 
justification that they were stepping in to “save” Spain from chaos belies 
the reality that their defection unleashed the floodgates of an infinitely 
more destructive level of chaos.
A general principle in regime changes 
is that if the military is united in 
withdrawing its support from the current 
regime, that regime cannot survive. On the 
other extreme, even popular revolutionary 
movements are highly unlikely to topple 
governments if the military holds firm in 
support of the status quo.

T
he partial failure of the military coup unleashed 
a period of chaos and uncertainty that opened 
the floodgates of communal violence. Although 
the war dragged on for another three years, the 
summer of 1936 was the deadliest for the civilian 
population, who were caught in the crossfire. In 
this lecture, we examine the violence committed by 
both sides as the country shifted from peacetime to 
civil war.

35
5. A Hot Summer: The War’s First Months
Disorganized Violence
The coup and defection of part of the military in the first days after the 
uprising in Morocco on July 17 had led to the virtual collapse of the 
Republican state and army, along with the constraints of the rule of law. 
The resulting vacuum of power during these first few months transformed 
much of the country into a “wild west” landscape where multiple armed 
forces imposed their own frontier justice.
While there were long-simmering hatreds, class hatreds, and a tradition 
of anticlericalism that help explain the choice of victims, they only go so 
far to explain the scope and the geography of violence. Hatred can only 
be transformed into mass killing where the usual constraints of public 
order have been removed, which is exactly what happened in July of 1936. 
Thus, the temporary collapse of state institutions that maintained security 
and order in the wake of the unsuccessful coup helped create what social 
scientists call an opportunity structure of violence.
In the weeks after the uprising, the militias consolidated and diversified 
into ad hoc local governing committees. They took charge of everything 
from food provisioning to military and police operations in villages, 
towns, and cities across the Republican zone. Outside the normal rule 
of law, the local and sometimes provincial committees took justice 
into their own hands, levying summary death sentences against clergy, 
landowners, and conservative politicians—groups perceived to be part of 
the counterrevolutionary enemy.
Between 60% and 80% of all the civilian 
deaths during the war occurred during 
the “hot” summer of 1936. Around 100,000 
civilians were massacred on both sides 
during this period.

5. A Hot Summer: The War’s First Months
36
On the rebel side, the initial dynamic of disorganized violence against 
civilians shared similar elements. Some of the killings were perpetrated by 
the local volunteer militias of Falangists and Carlists, which looted and 
terrorized mostly working-class neighborhoods because they could.
But regular army units also committed atrocities, particularly those from 
the colonial Army of Africa. The rebel units targeted workers as “class 
enemies,” along with anyone who belonged to one of the Republican parties 
or trade unions affiliated with the popular front. They also considered 
intellectuals and teachers associated with the secularizing education project 
of the Republic as enemies, regardless of specific political affiliation.
Nationalist Violence
As the dynamic of disorganized violence unfolded across rebel territories, 
the leaders of the rebellion also developed an official policy that 
justified civilian killings as part of a rhetoric to eliminate the “foreign” 
communist virus from Spain and “purify” the national community. In 
the meantime, local factors determined how the parallel uprisings of the 
rebel forces unfolded on the ground. In the southern theater, the presence 
of Army of Africa troops was a key factor in the immediate explosion of 
noncombat violence.
One of the worst concentrated civilian 
massacres of the war occurred in Badajoz, 
where American journalist Jay Allen 
witnessed some of the killing. Allen’s 
stories in the Chicago Tribune would cause 
an international furor. In his July 27 
interview with Franco, the general said 
that there would be “no compromise,” and 
that Spain would be pacified “at any 
cost.” 

37
5. A Hot Summer: The War’s First Months
In Cádiz, the Moroccan troops helped defeat the limited Republican 
resistance. Following their surrender, the main killings occurred, which 
made clear that merely taking power was not the primary motive. 
Government officials were arrested and charged with rebellion, even 
though they had been loyal to the legitimate government. Later, they were 
taken en masse from the prisons during the night and executed out of the 
public eye—a practice that became known as a saca, which literally means 
to “pull out.”
There was also plenty of defiant public violence, often spearheaded by 
the militias. In Cádiz, a combination of Falangists, Moroccan units, 
and Civil Guards carried out house-to-house searches in working-class 
neighborhoods, targeting known trade union members and other leftists.
The men were dragged out and either summarily shot in the street, arrested 
and tortured, or marched with others to the outskirts where they were 
ordered to dig their own mass grave and then shot. Women were raped and 
had their heads shaved as “collaborators,” a practice that was particularly 
common among the Moroccan troops.
At the same time as this grassroots, wild terror progressed, the new 
commander of the Second Military Division based in Seville, Gonzalo 
Queipo de Llano, issued orders that generalized and extended these 
tactics in the region of western Andalusia, where the insurgents still faced 
significant resistance. Queipo was able to conquer the city of Seville with 
the help of the Army of Africa units. He then sent the troops through the 
province, ordering “energetic” and rapid “pacification,” so that the troops 
would be freed up for the assault on the capital city of Madrid.
Queipo also justified retributive violence, which embraced the exemplary 
role of public executions. On July 24, he announced that when the army 
entered a town in which Republican “acts of cruelty” had been committed 
before their arrival, “all the leaders of any existing Marxist or communist 
organization will be executed without any legal procedure.” If these 
leaders could not be apprehended, an “equal number of arbitrarily selected 
affiliates to the same organizations” would be executed.

5. A Hot Summer: The War’s First Months
38
On August 1, the first column of the Army of Africa left Seville for 
Madrid, followed by others, which moved slowly through the provinces 
of Andalusia and Extremadura, targeting political officials, educators, 
and working-class neighborhoods, and leaving a swath of mass graves in 
their wake.
Over the next few months, the nature of the repression on the rebel side 
changed, but not the scope. As the military operations in the South and 
the North merged into a single command, under the leadership of General 
Franco, the high command moved to bring all units, including the militias, 
under centralized control. As part of this centralization, they sought to 
replace the kinds of wild public mass killings that had been routine in the 
South with a more secretive, systematic, and controlled process, but with 
the same outcome.
Throughout the fall of 1936, the rebels continued to pursue a campaign 
of mass extermination against individuals from popular front political 
organizations and trade unions without any formal judicial process. It was 
not until early 1937 that the rebel state began to shift its repressive strategy 
to military trial and prison, a pattern that continued into the early 1940s.
Republican Violence
In the much larger Republican territory, similar patterns of wild civilian 
killings emerged in the hot summer of 1936. Militia units untethered 
to state or military authorities adopted a rhetoric of cleansing and 
demonization of the enemy to justify summary executions as part of their 
revolutionary project to reshape Spain into an egalitarian workers’ paradise.
Other motives included a combination of rage, retribution, fear, and 
ideology. Militias targeted wealthy landowners and businessmen as class 
enemies along with members of conservative political organizations, all of 
whom were lumped into a single category of “fascist” enemies of the people. 
Religious personnel were also targeted, including priests, monks, friars, 
and nuns.

39
5. A Hot Summer: The War’s First Months
As in the rebel zone, some of the executions were carried out in public. 
Vigilante patrols, often aided by “blacklists” provided by residents, 
detained individuals who belonged to the suspect categories. In some small 
communities, residents congregated in the public square for “popular 
trials.” In other cases, suspects were jailed and then taken out at night and 
shot secretly before their trials. Sometimes prisoners were killed in direct 
retribution for rebel atrocities, as occurred after the Badajoz massacre.
Some of the worst vigilante justice occurred in the capital city of Madrid, 
which developed a siege mentality as the population awaited the arrival 
of the Army of Africa. Fears and rumors of “fifth column” traitors 
ready to collaborate with the nationalist troops created a heightened 
sense of vulnerability. The result: increased efforts to root out suspected 
traitors. More than 60 detention centers were established around the city, 
dedicated to detaining, judging, and executing suspects, often on the spot. 
Thousands of civilians were killed in this extrajudicial process.
One of the Republicans’ most high-profile targets was the clergy. In total, 
the war would claim an estimated 6,800 clerical victims, almost half of 
whom were killed in the summer of 1936. Members of the clergy, sacred 
icons, and religious structures were targeted as class and political enemies 
as well as religious ones. Anticlerical violence was the brutal realization of a 
vision that saw no place for the church in its revolutionary future. Whatever 
preexisting Nationalist sympathies the Spanish church may have had were 
only strengthened by the sight of murdered clergy and burning churches.
No other Republican violence so 
dramatically undermined their cause 
than their anticlerical violence. Within 
Spain, the church found a sympathetic 
ally in the Nationalists. Abroad, Catholic 
organizations in the Western democratic 
countries lobbied their governments not to 
help the atheistic Republic. 

5. A Hot Summer: The War’s First Months
40
On the Republican side, ideologically motivated killings were committed 
by all political groups in the popular front. Sometimes they did so with 
the approval, complicity, or indifference of local and provincial authorities. 
At the same time, there is no evidence that the Republican government 
coordinated a plan of extermination as the other camp did. Instead, 
violence seems to have exploded amid a state of lawlessness that allowed 
fear and hatred to escalate into lethal actions.
Broad Lessons
The first lesson we take from the violence unleashed by the military coup 
is the radicalizing dynamic of warfare itself, which normalizes killing as a 
solution to conflict. Thus, while only a few hundred politically motivated 
assassinations were carried out in the spring of 1936, tens of thousands of 
civilians were killed once the floodgates of war opened.
The second lesson is that, while warring states certainly played a role in 
mass killings, civilian death tolls could be higher in situations where state 
power had either weakened or collapsed. At least some of the civilianization 
of warfare emerged from decisions made not by conventional authorities 
but on the ground, whether in the Republican or Nationalist rear guards.
The last lesson is about the special haunting legacy of mass civilian 
violence during a civil war, at least some of which was carried out by local 
residents against their neighbors. This intimate and devastating fracture 
of community coexistence in towns and cities across the country partly 
explains Spain’s ongoing struggle to come to terms with its dirty past 
almost a century later.

The Two Sides: 
Nationalists and 
Republicans
B
y the end of the summer 1936, Spanish 
society was riven in two, and the Nationalist 
and Republican sides had consolidated into 
opposing camps. Defined monolithically by their 
opponents as either “reds” or “fascists,” each side was 
in fact a diverse mix of groups with a variety of goals 
and aspirations. In this lecture, we explore the diversity 
of each side and the common principles or values that 
bridged—or tried to bridge—these differences.

43
6. The Two Sides: Nationalists and Republicans
The Falange and the Nationalist Platform
On the Nationalist side, the military leaders of the coup had not given 
much thought to articulating a political program, beyond “saving” Spain 
from anarchy and perhaps setting up what Mola called a “republican 
military dictatorship.” They had planned a military operation, not 
a political revolution. The task of crafting a program that could 
bring together a diverse set of groups under a single umbrella was not 
straightforward. But over the summer of 1936, a platform of Catholicism, 
Spanish nationalism, and elements of fascist symbolism began to coalesce.
The Spanish fascist party was small compared to its Italian and German 
counterparts, but membership ballooned from 5,000 in February 1936 
to 1 million by August. After failing as an electoral force, the fascist 
movement, which celebrated violence as a foundational principle, 
blossomed in the new lawless context where uncontrolled violence and 
radicalism ruled. The movement in Spain was really more of a product of 
the coup and ensuing war than its cause, in contrast to Italy or Germany.
The founder of the Spanish fascist movement and the leader of the Sección 
Femenina, a women’s branch that provided auxiliary support for the war 
effort, were the son and daughter of the 1920s dictator Miguel Primo de 
Rivera. Pilar Primo de Rivera would become the most powerful woman 
in the Nationalist camp and a true fascist believer, along with her brother. 
José Antonio began his own political life affiliated with one of the small 
monarchist parties in the Second Republic in 1931. But he soon became 
impatient with participating on the margins of democratic politics and 
moved from the conservative right to the radical revolutionary right, 
especially after watching Hitler’s rise to power in Germany in January 
1933, which he hoped to imitate in Spain.
José Antonio wrote the manifesto of the Falange, the so-called “Twenty-
Seven Points,” in 1934, and he continued to lead the party until his capture 
in July 1936 and then execution by the Republicans in November. Like the 
Italian fascists, the platform promised an economic “third way,” between 
divisive Marxism that pitted classes against each other and the exploitative 
capitalist system.

6. The Two Sides: Nationalists and Republicans
44
Some of its principles and aspirations would eventually be incorporated into 
the rebel program, but equally important would be the adoption of their 
symbols. For instance, the open-hand fascist salute would be embraced as a 
ubiquitous Nationalist gesture.
A Crusade for Christian Spain
The embrace of Catholicism by the Spanish Falange would be an important 
bridge to the otherwise very different Carlist forces. The Carlist movement 
had emerged in the early 19th century as an ultra-Catholic, monarchist 
organization that railed against the forces of liberalism and secularism.
Carlists did not want to build a new order. They were embedded in tight-
knit rural communities that wanted to preserve their traditional way of life, 
and at the core of that way of life was religious devotion. They were the 
first to frame this struggle as another crusade against the infidels, similar 
to what their ancestors had waged against the so-called Moors—a term 
invented to define the North African Muslim populations who invaded 
and occupied the peninsula for nearly a millennium. The gradual Christian 
reconquest of the peninsula from the 8th to the 15th centuries was a 
foundational myth of conservative Spanish nationalism.
The language of religious crusade, which played no part in the conspirators’ 
initial communications, would become one of the cornerstones of the 
rebel platform and propaganda. It was, of course, more than ironic that 
the Nationalists utilized Muslim Moroccan and other foreign troops in 
their crusade for Christian Spain, but this uncomfortable reality was 
only pointed out by the Republicans, who tried to exploit it in their own 
propaganda.
Individual clergy had supported the uprising from the start, but it was 
not until July of 1937 that the Spanish bishops issued a collective letter 
officially joining what they framed as a life-and-death battle for Catholic 
Spain. In addition to Catholicism, the Nationalists adopted a version of 
the old Monarchist flag as their banner. So, by the end of the summer, 
the Nationalists had a name, a flag, a salute, and an umbrella ideology of 
National Catholicism to justify the war they had started.

Franco Becomes Leader
What they still did not have in the summer of 1936 was a leader. It was 
not until the October 1, 1936, declaration by the Junta Directiva that the 
choice became clear. Francisco Franco would be appointed head of state.
That outcome was a combination of his scheming and his good fortune. 
Remember that several of the top military conspirators either died or were 
captured in the first weeks of the war. Other potential nonmilitary rivals 
were also either dead or in prison.
But Franco was also a strategist. Most members of the Junta at the October 
1 meeting thought they were anointing Franco as generalissimo, or 
supreme military leader. Instead, Franco’s advisors convinced the others 
that he needed political authority to lead the Nationalists to victory. The 
proclamation made him head of state, and Franco became the caudillo—a 
Spanish translation of “führer.”
In Franco’s speech at his investiture, he made vague references to respecting 
the church, protecting workers against the domination of capital, 
promoting the independence of the peasants, and replacing voting with 
a “better way of expressing the popular will.” While each of these points 
gestured to one of the Nationalists’ constituencies, it was the authoritarian 
hierarchy of “One State. One Country. One Chief,” as posters proclaimed, 
that most effectively unified the Nationalist camp.
The Popular Front
In some ways, those who remained loyal to the Republican government had less 
work to define who they were or to justify their cause. They mostly represented 
a continuation of the legally elected popular front coalition of February 1936.
The popular front in Spain was a diverse coalition that included liberal and 
social democrats, Marxist socialists, anarchists, and what was at first a small 
Communist Party. Their goals were also diverse. The glue that held this 
broad spectrum together was the umbrella of anti-fascism and the need to 
band together against the fascist enemy in the name of the Spanish people.

47
6. The Two Sides: Nationalists and Republicans
The most important figure on the Republican side was Manuel Azaña, who 
was now the president instead of prime minister, and leader of the main 
liberal democratic party, Izquierda Republicana. But the most powerful 
forces on the ground were the socialists and the anarcho-syndicalist CNT, 
which defended worker revolution, not liberal democracy.
As a result of the coup, the collapse of state authority, and the arming of 
the militias, the center of gravity within the popular front coalition shifted 
dramatically. The liberal democratic Republican parties were no longer the 
core of the coalition. Instead, the worker parties and unions, whose large 
membership base formed the armed militias and local ad hoc governing 
committees, occupied center stage.
There were probably more than 1.5 million workers affiliated with one 
of the union movements in the spring of 1936, which were much more 
than associations to defend labor interests. The dense formal and informal 
networks constructed by the unions over the previous decades, especially 
in working-class communities, formed the basic structure on which local 
authority would be reconstituted from the ground up during the chaotic 
summer of 1936.
The popular front was a broader European 
phenomenon that came together in the wake 
of the fascist victory in Germany in 1933, 
around the belief that all the opposition 
parties from liberal democrats to 
communists had to unite to prevent fascist 
takeover elsewhere. However, popular front 
coalitions only governed briefly in France 
and in Spain, and in neither country 
was it able to prevent an authoritarian 
takeover.

The coup and the ensuing war also unleashed the simmering tension 
between democrats and revolutionaries. During the peacetime Second 
Republic, the socialist and anarcho-syndicalist movements debated 
internally about whether to support implementation of social reforms 
within the democratic system or try to overthrow the system to establish 
the egalitarian worker society of the future. Neither the CNT nor the 
UGT/PSOE had any plans to unleash a revolution in the spring of 1936. 
The key turning point was the July coup and not the February election, as 
the military conspirators claimed.
The Spanish Communist Party
Despite the conspirators’ rhetoric about imminent communist revolution, 
there were few real communists in Spain before the civil war. The party 
had formed back in 1921, along with most of the European communist 
parties, which split off from the insufficiently revolutionary Marxist 
socialist movement in the wake of the Bolshevik Revolution.
Until the civil war, the Spanish Communist Party, or PCE, had been 
a marginal political force, basically because the political space for the 
Communist Party on the revolutionary left of the spectrum was already 
occupied by the anarchist movement. In Spain, it was the anarcho-
syndicalist CNT that promoted the uncompromising “revolution now” 
position that international communists, as represented by the Third 
International federation, defended throughout the 1920s and early 1930s.
It’s ironic that the coup waged in the name of 
preventing communist revolution actually created 
the conditions that enabled it. In the vacuum 
of power, the working-class organizations, 
particularly the CNT, now seized the chance to act 
on their revolutionary dreams of a proletarian 
utopia.

6. The Two Sides: Nationalists and Republicans
In 1935, however, the Third International began promoting the concept 
of a broad anti-fascist popular front, which allowed Spain’s party to join 
the victorious popular front electoral coalition in February 1936, when 
the PCE elected 17 deputies to the Cortes, Spain’s elected legislative 
body. They were still far from a mass movement and very far from the 
membership boasted by the CNT and UGT/PSOE.
What really opened the door to mass expansion of the PCE was the influx 
of Soviet foreign aid from October of 1936, just as fascist foreign aid 
had bolstered the Falange. The constellation of foreign aid on both sides 
helped shape the balance of forces and specifically raised the profile of 
two movements that had been marginal in Spanish politics before the war: 
fascism and communism.
But it wasn’t just the foreign aid that raised the status of the Communist 
Party in the Republican camp. The Communists continued to push the 
concept of the broad popular front coalition and opposed radical revolution 
as divisive and detrimental to the war effort. Ironically, this position gained 
them the support of many non-working-class Republicans, who opposed 
fascism but were frightened by economic collectivization. By the end of 
1937, membership in the party had ballooned to 1 million.
In the next lecture, we’ll explore some of the many visions of what the anti-
fascist future would look like.

Republican 
Revolution and 
Local Power
W
ith the decentralization of power that 
occurred during the summer of 1936, the 
diverse Republican side saw a unique 
opportunity to put the revolutionary dreams of its 
left-wing groups into practice. While there was no 
coordinated plan for what this new Spain would look 
like, the vacuum of power opened the space for myriad 
grassroots initiatives, from economic collectivization to 
overturning social hierarchies to creating new forms of 
culture. The result was the most extensive unplanned 
revolutionary process in early-20th-century Europe. 
This lecture presents the multiple and contradictory 
faces of the revolutionary process, which was at once 
terrifying, alienating, inspiring, and fascinating.

7. Republican Revolution and Local Power
Economic Redistribution
Because of the revolution’s improvisational and decentralized nature, 
it is misleading to talk about it as a single phenomenon. And yet many 
Spaniards believed that the end goal was not simply defeating the fascists 
but constructing a new social, economic, and political order from the 
ground up.
On an economic level, there was no uniform process of economic 
expropriation or collectivization. Instead, the economy remained a hybrid 
of private and collective enterprises. In Barcelona, it has been estimated 
that as many as 3,000 businesses, including 70% of large factories, were 
collectivized, while many of their owners and managers fled, including the 
American directors of the General Motors auto plant.
In other cities, however, lower levels of collectivization were combined 
with cooperative arrangements, in which small businesses were run in 
partnership between owners and workers. Even within a single region, there 
could be dramatic variation, depending on the balance of local political 
forces or even the attitudes of individual leaders.
In general, the most committed revolutionaries were the anarchists of the 
CNT. Their ideology of local power and worker control was tailor-made for 
this historical moment. But even within the CNT there was disagreement 
over whether the small shop owner or farmer, the so-called petty 
bourgeoisie, was a potential ally or was lumped with the capitalist enemy.
Industrial collectivization was the most systematic in Catalonia. There, 
the regional Generalitat government coordinated with the dominant CNT 
unions to issue a formal decree. It declared that businesses with more 
than 100 employees or with owners who supported the rebels would be 
collectivized, with the assembly of workers choosing a council that would 
administer production. Smaller establishments could remain in private 
hands and be administered by the owners with the collaboration of a 
workers’ control committee.

7. Republican Revolution and Local Power
54
In December 1936, a general assembly was held at the National Palace of 
Montjuich to discuss implementation of the collectivization plan. Between 
15,000 and 20,000 workers attended. While there was much excitement on 
the ground, it’s unlikely that everyone was on board for the calls to sacrifice 
“special comforts” and work longer hours in service to the communal 
struggle, as several other speakers urged.
Reading between the lines of posters, broadsheets, and newspapers that 
pleaded, scolded, and shamed, it seems clear that at least some workers 
were less interested in sacrifice for the revolution and more consumed with 
their individual goals and aspirations. One poster that read “Comrade! 
Work more and better” provides a good example of such pleading, with the 
obvious implication that many were not working hard enough in the minds 
of revolutionary leaders.
Unfortunately for the Republicans, the ideal region for collectivization 
would have been the latifundia territory of the South, where there were 
few owners and many landless laborers, but this had fallen quickly into 
Nationalist territory at the hands of the Army of Africa. Instead, the 
Republic was faced with more complex landholding patterns with a mix of 
small farmers and large landlords.
Local decisions about how to treat small owners led to a huge range in 
levels of collectivization. Overall, about 40% of the agricultural land in 
Republican territory was expropriated and collectivized. The main region 
of agrarian collectivization was eastern Aragon, where an estimated 800 
collectives operated by 400,000 people were established. Although most of 
these collectivizations had started in individual villages, by the fall of 1936 
the CNT had set up a central body, the rural Regional Defense Council of 
Aragon, to manage the collectives, food production, and distribution.
The experience of collectivization among the rural population obviously 
differed between landless laborers and peasant owners. Even during the 
war, there were fierce debates on the Republican side about whether the 
process was coercive or liberating. Few were opposed to expropriation of 
large landowners, many of whom had fled or had been killed, but the role 
of small farms was more controversial. Defenders of collectivization insisted 
that they were putting libertarian communism into practice.

7. Republican Revolution and Local Power
Antiauthoritarian Military Structure
In the chaos and desperation of the parallel garrison uprisings, the 
Republican government had distributed arms to the trade unions, which 
had formed ad hoc militia units. In the revolutionary context, these militias 
were embraced by some as a permanent alternative to the hierarchical 
and authoritarian military culture of the old society. Even after the initial 
division of the military into loyal and rebel units, distrust of the regular 
soldiers lingered on the Republican side. The military had often repressed 
strikes and demonstrations during the Republic, and many workers still 
harbored some suspicion toward the military.
The revolution also challenged 
gender roles, most famously 
symbolized by the iconic image 
of the miliciana: the woman 
dressed in blue overalls 
with a rifle slung over her 
shoulder. This challenge to 
traditional gender norms did 
not last, but the miliciana 
became part of the mythology 
that the Republic had liberated 
women while the Nationalists kept 
them subordinated. 

7. Republican Revolution and Local Power
56
During the first few months after the coup, there was an uneasy relationship 
between the autonomous militias and the regular army units, reinforced 
by conscription and recruitment, but sometimes the militias refused to 
follow orders or abandoned their posts. This led some to call for a more 
centralized, conventional Republican military to coordinate the war effort.
But many revolutionaries feared that a centralized, hierarchical military 
would amount to a continuation of the old state and society. Instead, they 
wanted to keep the militias, which for them was not simply a practical issue 
but a building block of the new egalitarian society.
Revolutionizing Spanish Culture
In neighborhoods, the physical geography was altered as churches were 
burned or repurposed as garages or militia barracks, and luxury buildings, 
like private clubs or mansions, were occupied by worker organizations, 
which hung their revolutionary banners from the windows and plastered 
posters on the walls. Symbolically, the workers who had lived in the poor 
peripheral neighborhoods of cities took ownership of the wealthy city 
centers and streets. In Barcelona, the hospitality workers’ union took 
over several dozen eating establishments and turned them into “peoples’ 
restaurants.”
Beyond optics, revolutionaries thought a lot about the cultural foundation 
of the new society, although once again there was no specific blueprint. 
There was, however, a long tradition on the left of reverence for education 
and culture as tools of empowerment, and this was integral to the 
revolutionary project. On the one hand, revolutionaries wanted workers 
to have access to the same cultural benefits once restricted to those who 
could afford tickets. Lack of culture was equated with fascism, brutally 
symbolized by the Nationalist assassination of the poet and playwright 
Federico García Lorca.
On the other hand, there were also debates about whether the 
dissemination of this traditional high culture was suited for the new 
society. The Soviet Union provided one model of socialist realism, in 
which revolutionary art should glorify the worker experience and the noble 

57
7. Republican Revolution and Local Power
proletarian while discarding the remnants of so-called bourgeois culture 
and bourgeois role models. This aesthetic is evident in virtually all of the 
propaganda posters produced by the various Republican organizations. 
However, there was no wholesale adoption of a workerist cultural aesthetic, 
as in the Soviet Union. Instead, the Republican side boasted what we might 
call a cultural hybridity.
In reality, the only common thread of revolutionary culture in Spain was 
its militant secularism or anticlericalism. Many scholars have sought to 
interpret the dramatic symbolism of iconoclastic violence and explain why 
revolutionaries directed their energies into what can seem from the outside 
like gratuitous sacrilegious rituals. For example, before setting a church 
alight, the perpetrators would often pull out all the sacred icons and pile 
them in the street. Statues and icons were “executed,” dragged through 
the streets, disfigured, or simply burned in a public bonfire. Corpses of 
long-dead clergy were exhumed, mutilated, and publicly displayed. In some 
cases, religious artifacts were even removed from private homes.
While the perpetrators of this religious symbolic warfare were a minority, 
it was pervasive enough to make it one of the special features of the 
revolutionary experience for many Spaniards. Given the deep roots of 
Catholic culture in the old society, we can at least begin to understand 
why it became a target for many who aspired to create an entirely new 
social order.
Impacts of the Revolutionary Process
The role of the revolutionary process in the civil war was complex, and it 
clearly had a contradictory impact on the Republican cause. On the one 
hand, these radical projects probably did inspire many workers to fight 
harder for the Republic. In the 1930s, Spanish workers could believe they 
were on the vanguard of the world revolution, which was widely expected 
and anticipated by their comrades across Europe and the Americas in the 
wake of the Bolshevik Revolution.

7. Republican Revolution and Local Power
58
On the other hand, the specter of proletarian revolution no doubt pushed 
some initial Republican sympathizers into the Nationalist camp. Many 
in the middle classes were alienated and frightened or felt coerced into 
a collectivization process in which they had the most to lose. But even 
workers with no property to lose were not always enthusiastic about 
working hard for the community instead of themselves, or about the 
coercive and violent side of the revolution. There was also the practical 
question of how radical economic transformation may have disrupted 
production and consumption.
There was clearly a link between revolutionary dreams and revolutionary 
violence. Most revolutionary processes carry the contradictory seeds of 
constructing a beautiful new society while legitimating the violence needed 
to clear away the old. In practice, however, the urgent dream of a new 
egalitarian society came with a destructive side—in this case, the wild 
killing of landlords, employers, and other capitalists, as well as the effort to 
destroy all remnants of the Catholic Church.
The revolution was never institutionalized or consolidated. By the end 
of 1937, it was effectively dismantled, with the dissolution of militias, 
collectivized farms, and worker-controlled factories, as the anarchists’ 
local autonomy was crushed. The social revolution may or may not have 
undermined the war effort, as the majority argued. But the relative ease of 
its dismantling demonstrated its fragile foundations.

In the early 21st century, the idea of a revolutionary transformation 
of society has lost most of the positive connotations it had for many 
in the early 20th century, given the terror and violence inflicted in 
the course of various revolutionary experiments. In this context, is 
it possible to develop empathy and understanding within a critical

Rebuilding 
a Fractured 
Republican State
A
fter the summer of 1936, the Republic entered 
a new phase that began a slow process of 
reconstituting state authority over all of the 
ad hoc provincial and local governing bodies that had 
sprung up in the vacuum of power opened by the 
coup. The main goals were to create a more legitimate 
and inclusive government that could restore central 
authority and pursue a coordinated and more effective 
war effort. This lecture looks at the successes and 
challenges of the new government during this time.

61
8. Rebuilding a Fractured Republican State
Change in Leadership
When the war broke out, the balance of power had shifted away from 
liberal democratic Republicans and toward the socialist and anarchist 
working-class parties and trade unions, which wielded de facto power in 
many localities. The imperativeness to form a new government was obvious 
to everyone. Prime Minister José Giral’s cabinet, made up exclusively of the 
liberal democratic Republican parties, simply didn’t represent the reality on 
the ground. When his government resigned in September 1936, he asked 
President Azaña to form a new, more inclusive government. Giral would 
continue to serve the Republic.
The new government, led by 
Socialist prime minister Francisco 
Largo Caballero, embarked on a 
three-pronged plan. Its objectives 
were to
	
X integrate the voluntary 
militias into a regular 
military structure;
	
X reconstitute state 
institutions at all levels, 
from the judiciary to local 
governments; and
	
X channel economic resources 
into the war instead of local 
revolutions.
Largo Caballero seemed well suited to the new context. A longtime trade 
union organizer and Socialist Party leader, he was the main voice of the 
party’s more radical wing. He had served as labor minister in the 1931 
Azaña government and had been the main architect of the legislation that 
included higher wages, agrarian reform, and collective bargaining, but he 
became disillusioned with the meager results of social democracy and had 
begun talking about pushing forward to the socialist revolution even before 
the war.

The new government was the first and only in Spanish history to be led by 
a worker and labor leader. The hope was that Largo Caballero’s credibility 
among the trade union rank and file would help him both restore authority 
and legitimacy to the government and convince militia members to give up 
their independence to join the army.
Government of National Unity
The new government of national unity, as it was called, began with 
a promising diversity that included communists, Republicans, and 
representatives of the Basque and Catalan parties, along with a majority 
of socialists from Prime Minster Largo Caballero’s own party. Beyond the 
mere fact of inclusion, this government was a unique political experiment. 
It was the first coalition government to join liberal and social democrats 
with revolutionary parties. Hope prevailed that the new coalition 
government was the wave of the future.
Giral and two of his cabinet members stayed on to provide continuity and 
represent the liberal democratic Republican parties. The Basque Nationalist 
representative agreed to join in exchange for a promise to quickly pass an 
autonomy statute for the Basque Country, similar to what Catalonia had 
enjoyed since 1932.
The Communist Party was also invited to join the government for the 
first time. Two ministers held the education and agriculture portfolios. 
Although the Communist Party had joined the popular front electoral 
coalitions across Europe, including in France, this was the first time that 
they joined a government outside the Soviet Union.
The Communist Party in Spain, the PCE, tried to promote a strategy of 
popular front unity. They wanted centralized direction of the war and the 
suppression of local revolutionary powers that, in their minds, distracted 
from the main goal of winning the war. As a result of its position, the 
PCE carved out a significant constituency between the revolutionary trade 
unions on the one side and the weak liberal democratic Republican parties 
on the other.

63
8. Rebuilding a Fractured Republican State
The last and perhaps most surprising group to join this government of 
unity were the anarchists. At first the CNT refused to participate directly, 
but the majority of its leaders ultimately concluded that the emergency of 
the war and the fascist threat justified the unprecedented compromise of 
participating in a government. Thus, four anarchist ministers accepted 
invitations to join the government in November as ministers of trade, 
industry, justice, and health.
One of them was the first female minister in Spain, and one of the 
first in Europe, following Aleksandra Kollontay, who had served in the 
first Bolshevik government in the new Soviet Union in 1918. Federica 
Montseny, minister of health, was the daughter of two of Spain’s most 
famous anarchist intellectuals and publicists. She was an inspiring orator 
and one of the best-known CNT leaders in Spain during the Republic. 
Her decision to join the government carried a lot of moral weight for other 
anarchists struggling with what, for them, was an agonizing conundrum.
Restoring Central Authority
Even with its broad inclusiveness, the new government faced huge 
challenges, beginning with the dire military situation. November marked 
the beginning of the Nationalist siege of Madrid, and one of the new 
government’s first decisions was to move to Valencia, where it remained 
until the end of the war. Franco concentrated all his forces on the capital 
with a plan to bring the war to a swift end by capturing the city and 
crushing Republican resistance.
This evidence helped to convince most of the Republican coalition as well 
as the militia units of the need for a more centralized army structure, which 
became one of the main goals of the new government. Largo Caballero 
created a new central high command and appointed Vicente Rojo, a 
lieutenant colonel, to the new position. Rojo took the lead in the defense of 
Madrid but also organized the fronts into four theaters of operations: the 
center army, Aragon in the northeast, the northern army, and Andalusia in 
the south.

8. Rebuilding a Fractured Republican State
64
Rojo ordered the creation of mixed battalions to break up the units that 
had been formed by socialist, anarchist, or communist unions. By early 
1937, the militarization had largely been completed, although the new 
People’s Army retained some of the symbolism of a revolutionary force.
On the political and administrative front, the government’s goal was 
to rebuild central authority and the institutional hierarchy that would 
enforce it. One task was to replace the hodgepodge of self-appointed local 
committees with formal municipal councils that would proportionally 
represent all the local forces. These councils would then be subordinated 
to the provincial civil governors, who in turn took orders from Madrid. By 
early 1937, this structure was mostly in place.
Another major goal was to reestablish a formal judicial structure that would 
rein in the revolutionary tribunals and wild killings that had produced 
so many civilian deaths in the summer of 1936. Continuing the work of 
Giral’s government, the new government established a full network of 
tribunals. Given the dramatic decline in civilian executions after November 
on the Republican side, there is evidence of some degree of normalization 
in the judicial process. However, the special tribunals did not restore 
the liberal democratic due process of the peacetime Republic, either. In 
addition, Catalonia and the Basque Country operated their own court 
systems as part of their autonomous powers, so there was still no uniform 
justice system.
Challenges to Central Authority
By the spring of 1937, the new government had made substantial progress 
in reining in much of the chaos and violence. However, it was still far from 
united or even well coordinated, which explains why it unraveled in the 
midst of what observers called the civil war within the civil war.
On an administrative level, state authority was still limited by regional 
centers of power that remained more or less autonomous. In part, this was 
a feature of the autonomous statutes in Catalonia and, since October 1936, 
the Basque Country. The Generalitat government in Catalonia had full 

65
8. Rebuilding a Fractured Republican State
power over police, public order, and economic organization, which meant 
that the majority of Spain’s industry was not under central government 
control.
In addition to those regions, there was an ad hoc Regional Defense Council 
of Aragon, which had been set up by anarchist militia units in October 
1936 to coordinate the rural collectives and military operations. When the 
CNT entered the government, Largo Caballero responded by legalizing 
the council and trying to integrate it into the new government structure. 
Despite his efforts, it remained largely independent, with its own police 
force, justice system, and economic control over the agricultural collectives.
With all these regional centers of power, it remained difficult for the 
central government to impose uniform policies or institutions on the entire 
Republican territory. The government also could not bridge the major 
political differences within the Republican coalition. The communist 
and Republican parties viewed the anarchist CNT as disruptive and too 
undisciplined to achieve the kind of centralized authority they viewed as 
essential to win the war.
Consequently, they pushed to oust the CNT from the coalition. They also 
wanted to expel the trade union wing of the Socialist Party and create a 
more conventional government of just political parties. And the communist 
ministers were pushing for a merger of the communist and socialist parties 
under a single leadership. The internal criticisms got stronger after a major 
military defeat in February 1937, when the anarchist-defended city of 
Málaga fell to the Nationalists.
May Days
These simmering tensions came to a head in Barcelona during the so-called 
May Days. Barcelona epitomized the challenge of anarchist revolutionary 
power and regional autonomy. On May 3, fighting began when the 
government decided to evict the CNT from the building that had been 
their regional headquarters since July 1936. Over the course of several 
days, armed groups fought each other across barricades, with official 
casualty figures of 400 dead and 1,000 wounded. The government brought 

8. Rebuilding a Fractured Republican State
66
in military columns from the front to crush the resistance of mostly 
CNT armed groups as well as a small dissident communist party called 
the POUM.
In the aftermath, it would become clear that the government of unity 
couldn’t fulfill its unifying promise, and it would soon collapse. The 
political transition also led to the dissolution of the Regional Defense 
Council of Aragon, the ouster of the CNT and UGT trade unions from the 
government, and the increasing marginalization of the anarchists, which 
accompanied the dissolution of their local revolutionary power.
There have been endless debates about who was most to blame for this 
dispiriting internecine violence, but there is no question that the Republic 
never fully recovered from this self-inflicted wound. One of the main 
debates about the Republican defeat continues to be how much its potential 
victory was hobbled by these internal divisions versus by a lack of foreign 
aid imposed by the nonintervention pact.
It might be accurate to say that internal divisions were more important 
during the first and second phases of the Republic, up to the low point of 
May 1937. After that, international dynamics held increasing sway over the 
outcome of the war.

n the year between his appointment as head of

revolved around his absolute authority. In this lecture, 
we examine the formation of a rebel state and Franco’s

Franco’s Rise to Power
When the Nationalist campaign to take the capital city of Madrid in 
November 1936 failed, the military leadership knew they had come to 
a turning point that required a more institutional structure. They had 
already begun the process of consolidating authority around the leadership 
of General Francisco Franco. He was appointed both supreme military and 
political leader by early October. But with the stalemate of the war, Franco 
decided not to wait to begin the process of constructing a new Nationalist 
state to further legitimate the shaky authority of the insurgents. Franco was 
the unquestioned architect of what he called the New State, which would 
revolve around his personal rule as el caudillo, or “the leader.”
Francisco Franco came from an upper-class military family that had 
produced six generations of naval officers. Having entered the army instead 
of the navy, he rose through the ranks in the colonial army in Morocco and 
became one of the youngest generals ever in 1926, at age 33. On a personal 
level, he seemed to be a genuinely devout Catholic, monarchist, and fervent 
Spanish nationalist. There is no evidence that he was attracted by the 
antiestablishment, radical fascist ideas that aimed to overturn the existing 
order that he cherished. He stepped into the breach at a moment of crisis 
and decided he was the one to take charge.
Leaning into his reputation as a successful military commander, he 
gathered astute political advisers to make the transition from military to 
political leader. Nevertheless, the transition was a gradual one, consistent 
with Franco’s cautious personality. Throughout the first summer, he still 
responded to foreign reporters that the rebellion was not being waged 
against the institutions of the Republic and that he envisioned at most a 
brief dictatorship to restore order.
But as his military accomplishments pushed him into the forefront of 
the Nationalist leadership, his circle of personal advisers—including his 
brother, his brother-in-law, and his wife—all encouraged his ambition. In 
fact, the combination of his lack of political experience or affiliation with 
any of the distinct Nationalist ideological groupings made him an ideal 
unifying candidate.

Creation of the Movimiento
Beyond his exalted sense of personal mission, Franco’s consolidation of 
power was aided by an astute pragmatism that helped bring the diverse 
groups in the coalition on board. Although he demanded unquestioned 
obedience, he also tolerated some limited ideological diversity.
The best example of this leadership style was Franco’s creation of a new 
single party that combined hierarchy and limited pluralism. Thus, the 
various political currents within the rebel camp, ranging from Falangists, 
Carlists, and Alfonsine monarchists to Catholics, were forcibly merged 
in April 1937 into the Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas 
de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista (Traditionalist Spanish Phalanx of 
the Juntas of the National Syndicalist Offensive). It was an ungainly 
but strategically inclusive name, which symbolically acknowledged the 
discrete components. In practice, it became known as the Movimiento, or 
“Movement,” to signify the unification of all the forces of the uprising or 
“National Movement.”
This entity was dominated by the two main sources of volunteers, the 
Falange and the Traditionalist Communion (or Carlists). There was also 
a branch called the Sección Femenina, the “Women’s Section,” which 
formulated a conservative vision of womanhood to counter the Republican 
“modern” woman.

The basic unifying themes were the defense of Catholicism and nationalism, 
but the visual and symbolic and institutional culture was a mixture of 
fascist symbols, Carlist rhetoric about the new reconquest of Spain from the 
infidels, and Catholic rituals officiated by the ecclesiastical hierarchy.
Creation of the New State
After the creation of the Movimiento, the first Francoist government was 
formed in January 1938 to set about creating the institutional framework 
for the authoritarian “New State” that would parallel its Republican 
counterpart until the end of the war. It continued to expand into new 
regions until the declaration of victory in April 1939 finally made it the 
only political authority in Spain.
Franco was the president and head of state, and all ministers had to swear 
fealty to him and the Nationalist state. His brother Nicolás was appointed 
general secretary, which was essentially a second-in-command whose 
absolute loyalty Franco could rely on. The cabinet included representatives 
of all the political groups and was made up mainly of civilians, including 
his Falangist brother-in-law as minister of the interior.
Among the first important laws passed in 1938 were the reinstatement of 
the death penalty, which had been abolished by the Republic; the abolition 
of the Catalan autonomy statute; a draconian press censorship law; and a 
new education framework that gave absolute power to the church to design 
curricula for secondary schools.
The following year, a few months before the end of the war, the 
government passed one of the most consequential pieces of legislation: 
the Law of Political Responsibilities. It effectively backdated treasonable 
offenses to anyone who had supported the legal Republic in July 1936, 
justifying an even broader scope of postwar repression and retribution.
The New State also included more specifically fascist-inspired rhetoric 
and institutions, including its very definition as “authoritarian, national 
syndicalist and imperialist.” More substantively, the regime adopted the 
Fuero de Trabajo, or the labor charter. Modeled on the Italian fascist 
labor system, it was emblematic of the economic “third way” that fascists 

9. Francisco Franco Forms a Nationalist State
72
claimed to carve out between collectivist Marxism and exploitative 
capitalism. It proposed a cooperative relationship between employers and 
workers in which all would work together for the common good of the 
national economy.
This cooperative relationship was symbolized by the national vertical 
syndicates. These were essentially 28 trade unions associated with different 
economic sectors. Affiliation was mandatory for all “producers”—that is, 
owners, managers, and workers. The basic framework protected private 
property for the owners but, at least in theory, included a mandate to 
dispense “social justice” to the workers, with benefits like vacations, 
pensions, and a minimum wage, as well as healthy and safe working 
conditions. In practice, though, the vertical syndicates served as tools of 
the employers, who still had all the power, while strikes and independent 
unions were forbidden and harshly repressed.
A Hybrid Regime
Because of the hybrid identity of the new state, there’s still debate about 
how to categorize it among the spectrum of right-wing authoritarian 
regimes of the era. While fascist ideas were diluted by integration into a 
more inclusive unified party, they were still part of the program. Franco 
adapted them for his own purposes, appropriating fascist rhetoric and 
establishing fascistic institutions like the Fuero de Trabajo.
At the same time, he equally drew on the traditionalist rhetoric of divine 
authority and religious crusade. Catholic symbolism pervaded public 
events. A letter issued on July 1, 1937, constituted an official statement of 
the Spanish church and laid out the terms of the struggle—on one side, 
Christian civilization defended by the Nationalists, and on the other, 
anti-Christian communism. From then on, with each Nationalist conquest, 
religious figures were prominent in their attendance at victory parades 
and rallies.
Finally, it is important that Franco derived his authority from his role 
as military leader in a conflict that had begun with a top-down military 
coup and during which the military never relinquished full control. The 

73
9. Francisco Franco Forms a Nationalist State
tradition of military leaders stepping in and replacing civilian governments 
in moments of crisis had a long pedigree in Spanish history, going back to 
the early 19th century, but most recently with General Primo de Rivera 
in 1923.
The true hybridity of the regime speaks to a broader transformation in 
modern right-wing movements, as traditionalist and modern trajectories 
began to converge. “Movement politics” and Catholic values fused to 
compete in this new arena of mass politics, which formerly had been the 
preserve of left-wing political movements.
Exemplary of this fusion were the Carlist militias, or Requetés. Though 
traditionalist in principle, the monarchist Requetés shared many functional 
attributes with the fascist Falange. Likewise, the female section of the 
Falange rhetorically celebrated women’s traditional piety and domesticity. 
Meanwhile, they mobilized women into an auxiliary force whose activities 
were anything but traditional.
So, the National Catholicism that coalesced during the war was not 
really paradox but fusion. It merged traditional conservatism and modern 
mass mobilization in a new hybrid synthesis. National Catholicism 
quickly became interchangeable with Spanish identity and Spanish 
civilization. Those who opposed it were deemed to be enemies of Spain 
and were subjected to harsh repression. In fact, anyone who supported the 
Republic was included as an enemy, leading to hundreds of thousands of 
investigations over the next few years.
Rather than being wholly traditional or 
wholly fascist, the Franco regime consisted 
of an evolving balance between military 
authoritarianism, mass mobilization, 
fascist revolutionary rhetoric, and 
religious crusade.

Nationalist Repression
Despite formal military tribunals, which did reduce the number of 
extrajudicial killings after the first few months, the scale of repression 
certainly transcended any traditional military or political strategy of 
warfare. The Nationalists embraced a radical project of “cleansing” the 
population. Little else can explain the enormous scale of incarceration 
and the estimated 100,000 judicial and extrajudicial executions during 
the war. Nationalist repression aimed not just to achieve victory or restore 
order, but to eliminate those perceived as beyond the boundaries of Spanish 
civilization.
The fact that repression appeared alongside growing fascist influence might 
suggest that fascism was the cause of this repression. However, there was a 
huge disparity in domestic violence perpetrated by fascist-inspired regimes 
in Germany, Italy, and Spain. Most of the extreme violence perpetrated by 
the Italian and German fascist regimes was against foreign peoples or those 
defined as foreigners, as in the case of German Jews. In Spain, the targets 
were Spaniards.
It seems more plausible that it was the civil war that unleashed a dynamic 
of destruction in Spain that justified extreme violence against its own 
population, which was not explicitly the goal of fascist violence. And 
when the civil war ended, repression continued with impunity because the 
regime felt no international pressure to reconcile with the defeated. At its 
foundation, the regime that emerged victorious from the civil war was built 
on the cultural, social, and political exclusion of the defeated.

Most historians today reject the simplicity of the “great man theory 
of history,” in which individual protagonists were given almost 
unlimited agency in explaining historical change, but we are still 
left with the challenge of inserting these “great men” into a larger 
framework. How would you acknowledge Franco’s importance while 
situating him within the larger canvas of the civil war?

I
n the “total wars” of the 20th century, the home 
front was as much a part of the story as the 
fighting front. This new reality created a central role 
for women in the history of modern warfare. At the 
same time, civil wars exacerbate competing visions 
over the role of women in each side’s ideal social 
order, and these visions don’t always line up with 
the reality on the ground. In this lecture, we explore 
the gendered history of the Spanish Civil War, which 
deserves to be told as a single story even though, at 
first glance, Republican and Nationalist women had 
little in common.

77
10. Women in the War: Workers, Nurses, Soldiers
Gender Roles Transformed
Incorporated into the Nationalist defense of Catholicism was a 
traditionalist vision of women as devout mothers and wives. This vision 
would be reinforced with legislation such as the Fuero de Trabajo, which 
restricted women’s access to the labor force, and pronatalist laws that 
illegalized birth control while providing monetary incentives to have 
more children. A reinstated 19th-century civil code subjected wives to the 
absolute authority of their husbands.
On the other side, one of the pillars of Republican reform since 1931 had 
been the emancipation of women, including the dramatic decision to 
enfranchise women after a contested parliamentary debate leading up to 
the Constitution. In theory, their vision of women matched the European 
image of the modern woman that had emerged after the First World War, 
defined by independence, civil and political equality, and access to the 
public sphere.
In practice, the experience of total war pulled women in both zones out 
of their traditional family roles. Thus, rearguard mobilization opened 
new public spaces and transformed gender roles on both sides, even if 
inadvertently in the case of the Nationalists. Also on both sides, the 
civilianization of warfare meant that women could be direct victims of the 
rearguard violence, from the bombing of civilian targets to the gendered 
forms of rape and shaving of heads.
The most ubiquitous gendered experience of the war was the struggle to 
provision and protect families. Across the political spectrum, this was an 
extension of the traditional role of wives and mothers. Women spent hours 
standing in lines to buy scarce rationed goods, braving rain, snow, and 
heat, like their husbands and sons at the front. To augment diminishing 
resources, women learned how to make shoes, bleach, soap, and clothing, 
which they sold or exchanged for food and fuel.
In rural areas, they scrounged for wood for cooking and heating, or tended 
vegetable gardens and carried the produce into town to sell, sometimes on 
the growing black market. Women and children were also often called on 
to build bomb shelters to protect their families from the novel strategy of 
shelling civilian targets.

Women were also recruited into jobs from which they had always been 
excluded. In farming communities, they took over the traditional 
masculine tasks of plowing and harvesting. In the major Republican cities, 
they were recruited into the munitions industries. In Barcelona, an institute 
was established to train women, and over the course of the war, it trained 
thousands of women for factory labor. Other women worked as nurses, bus 
drivers, or couriers.
Dolores Ibárruri and the AMA
The entry of women into the political sphere had been a slow process, 
but the crisis of the war and the need for total mobilization reduced the 
traditional barriers to female associationism on both sides. The AMA, 
the Agrupación de Mujeres Antifascistas, or “Association of Antifascist 
Women,” was the oldest and most established women’s organization 
on the Republican side. It had 60,000 affiliates and included socialists, 
Republicans, and Basque Catholics. It was a branch of the international 
federation, formed by the Communist International in 1933, to coordinate 
the global struggle against fascism in the wake of the Nazi seizure of power.

79
10. Women in the War: Workers, Nurses, Soldiers
The AMA’s local branches organized literacy classes for women and 
training courses to teach them job skills. They also published newspapers 
that aimed to provide a working-class female audience with a broader vision 
and understanding of the world beyond their limited daily lives.
The model for these women was the founder herself, Dolores Ibárruri, who 
was one of the rare, prominent female labor leaders of the era, in Spain or 
elsewhere. Her initial trajectory was typical for a woman of her class. Her 
path began to deviate during the 1917 general strike, when her talents as an 
orator and propagandist thrust her into the limelight. When the Socialist 
Party underwent its painful split in 1921, she joined the faction that 
established the Spanish Communist Party, the PCE. In the popular front 
election of February 1936, when the Communist Party sent its first elected 
representatives to the Cortes, she was one of them.
Ibárruri also played a more controversial role in the internal struggles 
within the Republican camp, defending the Communist Party pursuit 
of unity and discipline, which many interpreted as an effort to dominate 
and control. Nevertheless, she remained a rallying figure during Franco’s 
dictatorship as a member of the Communist Party in exile, which 
continued to organize and encourage resistance. She remained the AMA’s 
president throughout the civil war.
During the civil war, 
Dolores Ibárruri became 
immortalized through her 
impassioned speeches, which 
confirmed her pen name, 
La Pasionaria, a name that 
stuck with her throughout 
her life. In one speech 
she coined the phrase “No 
pasarán,” “They shall not 
pass,” which would become 
the ubiquitous motto of the 
Republican side.

Amparo Poch and the ML
The other major women’s organization on the Republican side was the ML, 
Mujeres Libres, “Free Women,” which had 20,000 members in 155 groups. 
It was associated with the anarchist movement although it was independent 
from the CNT trade union structure. One of its founders was Amparo 
Poch, another unusually accomplished woman. She was one of the handful 
of female doctors in 1930s Spain. During the civil war, Poch worked with 
anarchist health minister Federica Montseny as director of social assistance 
in the establishment of field hospitals.
Poch and several other women founded Mujeres Libres in the spring of 
1936 and published the first edition of the newspaper of the same name 
before the outbreak of the war. In contrast to the AMA, Mujeres Libres 
explicitly embraced the emancipation of women as a goal, which they 
believed could only come along with economic liberation from capitalist 
exploitation, and thus they were enthusiastic supporters of the revolutionary 
process that had been unleashed with the civil war. In practice, they 
focused on practical activities like literacy classes and childcare centers, but 
their journal introduced readers to what were radical ideas at the time—
for example, free love and women’s independence from the patriarchal 
constraints of the traditional family.
In 1934, Amparo Poch opened a practice 
in a working-class neighborhood of Madrid 
where she specialized in mother and 
infant health. She also promoted the 
establishment in Barcelona of homes for 
prostitutes, where they could receive 
health care, education, and training 
to help them transition into legitimate 
professions.

81
10. Women in the War: Workers, Nurses, Soldiers
They also demanded leadership positions in the anarchist CNT and a 
more extensive integration of women into the trade unions, but to no avail. 
Like revolutionaries across Europe in this period, the male leaders gave lip 
service to women’s emancipation in theory, but in practice they held the 
same assumptions of gender hierarchy as their conservative counterparts. 
This helps explain why the new opportunities opened for women by the 
rupture of the war did not lead to a wholesale transformation into what 
we can call the gender system. A gender system signifies the expectations 
for male and female roles in any society and guides acceptable behavior for 
men and women.
In this case, Spain was still a deeply patriarchal society. Thus, the women 
who broke the barrier into “male” occupations as drivers, mechanics, or 
in arms factories were, in fact, exceptional. Most exceptional of all were 
the female soldiers, the milicianas, whose already small number all but 
disappeared after the first few months, as the slogan “The Men to the 
Front, the Women to the Rearguard” became official policy. Amparo Poch 
herself joined an anarchist militia unit in July 1936, serving as a medic. 
From September 1936 onward, women were forced to leave the front, and 
by early 1937 there were very few still fighting.
Pilar Primo de Rivera and the SF
On the Nationalist side, the most important women’s organization was the 
SF, Sección Femenina, or “Women’s Section,” of the Falange, which grew 
from 2,500 at the beginning of the war to 600,000 by the end. Despite an 
ideology that celebrated women’s exclusively domestic role, their female 
organizations recruited more members into public service than on the 
Republican side. It’s leader, Pilar Primo de Rivera, embodied this paradox. 
She used the SF to inculcate the principles of obedience and subordination 
into several generations of Spanish women until its dissolution in 1977. 
However, she herself never married and remained in public service as one of 
the cadre of female political elites in the dictatorship.
She formed her conservative political views at a young age, growing up in a 
household with her father, the 1920s dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera, and 
her brother, José Antonio, who founded the Falange fascist party in 1933. 

10. Women in the War: Workers, Nurses, Soldiers
82
When her brother was executed in November 1936 by the Republicans, 
she made it her life’s work to promote and defend his fascist ideas and his 
legacy, always subordinating her role to that of a surrogate. At first, she 
resisted the creation of the Movimiento, the hybrid Nationalist party, 
as she feared it would dilute the fascist values of the Falange, but she 
accommodated herself to Franco’s leadership and used her position and 
political skills to carve out a dominant role for the SF in the dictatorship.
When the war broke out, female membership exploded as the organization 
took on a new range of responsibilities, including nursing, making 
uniforms, acting as pen pals for frontline troops, fundraising, and working 
on the land. In addition, clandestine SF groups in Republican territory 
organized safe houses, embassy escape lines, and welfare aid for religious 
personnel and others threatened by Republican violence. In contrast to the 
Republican AMA and ML, there was no explicit mission to educate, train, 
or emancipate women, but SF members performed many of the same tasks 
that crossed traditional gender boundaries.
Pilar Primo de Rivera 
was the most visible 
public female figure on 
the Nationalist side, 
visiting the SF nurses 
at the front, appearing 
with other leaders on 
the stage at Franco’s 
speeches, and even 
traveling to Germany to 
meet with Hitler in 1938. 
After the war, she urged 
women to return to their 
domestic and maternal 
duties, but she herself 
remained in the political 
spotlight for the next 
40 years.

eginning with this lecture, we turn from the 
domestic origins and unfolding of the conflict 
to the international stage, where the politics of 
whether or not to intervene in the Spanish Civil War 
would have enormous repercussions on the outcome. 
One of the enduring historical debates is the degree to 
which foreign intervention or nonintervention was the 
decisive factor in the defeat of the Republic and the 
victory of the Nationalists. In this lecture, we look at 
factors that influenced France, Britain, and the United 
States to take the stances they did toward Spain.

85
11. Western Powers Agree to Nonintervention
The Nonintervention Pact
For many, the Spanish war came to symbolize the grand ideological and 
political struggles of the era, which catapulted it into the international 
spotlight. The Nationalist forces had immediately aligned themselves with 
the rising fascist powers when they secured foreign aid from Mussolini 
and Hitler for the initial coup and airlift of the Army of Africa. The 
thorny question was how the democratic powers would respond to this 
international challenge.
France and Britain were the two key players, with the United States playing 
a supporting role. The governments in each of these countries had very 
different sympathies, priorities, and ideological orientations. However, they 
all agreed to ban military aid to their fellow democratic government in 
Spain. France and Britain did this through the nonintervention pact, and 
the US through an arms embargo.
The nonintervention pact prohibited the sale and transport of arms and 
munitions to either side. Most of the European countries signed the pact 
in August 1936. In September, the signatories formed a committee that 
would supposedly monitor that the conditions of the pact were followed, 
but the requirements for submitting a complaint were stringent. Even if an 
accusation were allowed to go forward, there was no provision for sanctions 
should it be validated.
In retrospect, one could argue that it was not the pact per se that sealed the 
Republic’s defeat, but the complete failure to implement it. In any case, the 
pact and the US embargo resulted in a huge military disadvantage for the 
Republican forces. How do we make sense of the democratic states’ decisions?
France’s Perspective
At first it seemed obvious that the government of France led by the Socialist 
prime minister Léon Blum would wholeheartedly support the Republican 
popular front. Strategically, France had always viewed a benevolent Spanish 
regime as key to its own national security, and the potential of a German or 
Italian satellite state was disturbing, to say the least.

86
But most important was their ideological affinity. France was the only 
other country to elect a popular front government, in May 1936, three 
months after the Spanish election. The government contained the same 
heterogeneous mix of Republicans, socialists, and communists as in Spain 
and the same mission to form a grand alliance against the spread of fascism.
In fact, Blum did issue immediate declarations of support and promised to 
send military aid after receiving a request from the Spanish prime minister 
on the night of July 19. The next day, Blum met with his ministers and 
ordered the first shipment of airplanes.
But this alliance began to unravel almost immediately. Ultimately, the 
complex national and European political struggles of the era would 
lead Blum and his popular front government to abandon their Spanish 
counterpart. Even more ironically, Blum would end up leading the charge 
for nonintervention.

The democratic powers worried about the competing threat from the 
communist Soviet Union on the one hand and the fascist powers of Italy 
and especially Germany on the other. But Europe was divided over the 
degree to which the two threats were evaluated and prioritized. For the left, 
the Spanish Civil War was a showdown between democracy and fascism, 
while for the right, it was communism versus Western civilization, which 
included the defense of the Christian religion.
In the French case, as soon as the public knew of Blum’s decision to send 
aid to the Spanish Republic, he was lambasted by the strong conservative 
opposition in parliament and the press, which accused him of being 
a puppet of Moscow. Given these internal political divisions, Blum 
apparently feared a civil war in his own country and reportedly lacked 
confidence that the conservative armed forces would follow orders to assist 
the Spanish Republic. Equally important was the pressure from Britain, 
France’s major ally. Blum decided to shift from support to neutrality.
On August 1, he proposed an international pact of nonintervention as what 
he hoped would be a compromise solution. Even before it was signed, the 
French government officially suspended arms shipments to Spain. At the 
time, it was a mortal wound for Blum’s government, and he resigned in 
June 1937.
France’s strong conservative opposition 
would become the core of the future 
Vichy government and its popular base, 
so it represented a powerful current 
of French politics. Although the Vichy 
regime was enabled by the Nazi invasion 
of France in June 1940, the dominant view 
today is that it represented a homegrown 
ultraconservative authoritarian tradition.

11. Western Powers Agree to Nonintervention
88
Britain’s Perspective
The British government’s disinclination to intervene is easier to understand, 
given the comfortable Conservative majority government. British diplomats 
in Spain were uniformly critical of the Republic, and this hostility colored 
the reports that were sent back to the Foreign Office. The British Consul 
in Barcelona had indicated in a telegram that “the situation is critical, 
inasmuch as the government appears to be at the mercy of the workers.” 
For Conservatives, workers was a code word in the language of the era for 
communism and class struggle, and they had no doubt that a workers’ 
revolution in Spain would lead to a Soviet outpost in Western Europe.
Despite the dominance of these views and the Conservative majority, the 
government did face strong opposition from the Labour Party and the 
left-wing press. As a result, the British government’s promotion of the 
nonintervention pact had both domestic and international strategic goals. 
In a parliamentary debate in June of 1937 between then Conservative 
prime minister Neville Chamberlain and Labour opposition leaders, 
Chamberlain reiterated the government’s goal to “maintain the peace of 
Europe by confining the war to Spain.”
It is easy to follow the trail from Chamberlain’s argument in the Spanish 
case to his position on appeasement with Nazi Germany, culminating in 
the Munich Agreement in September 1938, in which Britain and France 
agreed to the Nazi annexation of a piece of Czechoslovakia in exchange 
for a pledge of peace from Hitler. More directly related to Spain was 
the November 1938 Anglo-Italian Agreement. In signing, Chamberlain 
acceded to the Italian conquest of Abyssinia, or Ethiopia, demanding in 
return that Italy withdraw its soldiers from Spain, who were there in clear 
violation of the nonintervention pact. Spain was no more than a pawn in 
Chamberlain’s internal calculations.
The social democratic Labour Party attacked what one of its leaders called 
Britain’s “malevolent neutrality” toward Spain’s democratically elected 
government. In August 1936, one member argued that the Conservative 
government’s blind fear of Bolshevism was facilitating the creation of a 
fascist state in Spain that would in fact threaten British security.

But it was later that internal opposition mounted, as it became increasingly 
clear that the British government was not committed to enforcing the pact 
against the fascist powers. At the parliamentary debate of June 1937, the 
Labour leader (and future prime minister) Clement Attlee argued that the 
international rule of law had been breached in Spain by the military coup, 
aided by the foreign fascist powers. The lack of “any genuine attempt to 
carry out the agreement,” he concluded, made the British government an 
accessory to these massacres.
The United States’s Perspective
The United States was the third major democratic power to endorse 
neutrality in the Spanish conflict. Its decision was hardly surprising, given 
the well-known isolationism of American foreign policy in the interwar 
period. The US Senate had famously refused to ratify the Treaty of 
Versailles or join the League of Nations, despite the advocacy of President 
Woodrow Wilson.
In truth, the US was less isolationist than unilateralist. That is, the US 
wasn’t opposed to international involvement on principle, but it was 
uninterested in joining international organizations or treaties that limited 
its sovereignty or committed it to intervene in foreign conflicts. In addition, 
the US version of isolationism only applied to its avowed commitment to 
remain neutral in European affairs. It was ready to pursue interventionist 
policies in the American hemisphere under the umbrella of the 1823 
Monroe Doctrine, which asserted US hegemony in the region.
Despite the embargo, several large US companies, 
notably petroleum producers, supplied the 
Nationalists with three-quarters of all the 
gasoline consumed by their army over the course 
of the war. Their biggest supporter was Texaco, 
whose president was openly sympathetic to the 
fascist cause, and the company continued its 
sales even after it became illegal, falsifying the 
destination of its ships to avoid discovery.

As a social democrat, President Franklin Roosevelt was more sympathetic 
to the Spanish Republic than were the British Conservatives. But he 
faced an isolationist public, a strong current of anti-communism, and 
the ultraconservative profile of the professional diplomatic corps. This 
combination stacked the deck against Roosevelt breaking with established 
American policy to aid Spain.
Roosevelt signed the first Neutrality Act in August 1935, well before the 
war in Spain began. The law was later extended in February 1936 for 
another 14 months, coinciding with the opening months of the Spanish 
Civil War. The law imposed an automatic arms embargo against the sale of 
weapons to any belligerent in a foreign war, whether aggressor or victim, as 
well as a prohibition on loans to the belligerent parties. At the same time, it 
excluded the American continent from the agreement.
There was a small loophole in that the US Neutrality Act did not officially 
apply to the two parties in a civil war, but the US State Department 
justified its application in Spain as a moral equivalent. Instead of joining 
the nonintervention pact, the US declared a “moral embargo” of arms to 
Spain on August 11, 1936, in fulfillment of the spirit—if not the letter—of 
its Neutrality Act. In January 1937, the moral embargo became a legal and 
enforceable embargo. Even though popular sympathy for the Republic did 
increase over time, the embargo remained in place until the end of the war.
The decisions of the major democracies of France, Britain, and the US to 
pursue neutrality instead of support for a fellow democracy only make sense 
within the complex calculation of domestic and geostrategic politics in the 
late 1930s, which was different for each of the three countries. Defenders of 
the Republican cause at the time and since have excoriated the decision to 
deny the rights of a legally elected democratic regime to purchase weapons 
to defend itself. The great irony is that this decision forced the Republic to 
depend on the one nation that did step into the breach: the Soviet Union.

Question
1	
The debates over intervention in the Spanish Civil War within the 
democratic states evoke familiar trade-offs between national security, 
geostrategic goals, international law, and humanitarian concerns. 
How would you evaluate and prioritize these competing goals in 
the Spanish case, and what lessons do you see for current and future 
international conflicts?

The USSR and Mexico 
Aid the Republic
T
here is more debate about the impact of Soviet 
intervention on the political balance of power, 
both within the Republican government and in 
Europe as a whole. The one democratic country willing 
to aid the Republic was Mexico, but its resources were 
limited. Its role has received little attention, despite 
the novelty of a poor postcolonial nation making the 
unprecedented decision to send aid to its former 
European colonial master. In this lecture, we examine 
the types of aid these governments supplied and their 
motives for getting involved.

93
12. The USSR and Mexico Aid the Republic
Soviet Aid
Seeing the Republic in crisis, the Soviet Union made the decision to break 
the nonintervention pact and, from October 1936, became the main 
source of weapons and other supplies for the Republic. The question of 
the quantity, quality, and timing of military supplies was only resolved in 
the 1990s with the opening of the Soviet archives and access to previously 
secret records. Research has revealed not only a lower quantity of arms than 
previously claimed, but an inferior quality, which was probably even more 
decisive, as Gerald Howson argued in his classic study Arms for Spain.
Aside from the airplanes and tanks, much of the weaponry sold to 
Spain was out of date and discarded, in marked contrast to the Nazi 
armaments provided to the Nationalist forces that Hitler wanted to test 
before unleashing his own military ambitions. None of the modern Soviet 
weapons arrived until the spring and summer of 1937. And scholars 
estimate that the Republic was gouged more than $50 million in arms sales 
from the USSR.
The timing of Soviet deliveries was also suboptimal. The Republic was 
virtually starved for weapons at crucial points—during the summer of 
1936, before the start of Soviet aid, and from the end of 1938. Of the 66 
shipments from the USSR, 52 arrived between October 1936 and the end 
of 1937. Whatever its limits, there is no question that the first shipments of 
Soviet weapons beginning on October 4 were crucial in helping prevent the 
imminent defeat of the Republican army in the Battle of Madrid.
After the USSR declared its intention to 
arm the Republic, the Spanish government 
sent three-fourths of the Bank of Spain 
gold reserves to the USSR, estimated 
at 510 tons of ore. The rest of it was 
deposited in the Bank of France, to pay 
for the goods channeled through France.

12. The USSR and Mexico Aid the Republic
94
The rest of the arms were purchased from arms dealers in Poland and 
Czechoslovakia, which was the largest arms exporter in the world at the 
time, along with some camouflaged shipments from France. To pay for all 
of this military equipment, the Republic drew on the gold reserves of the 
Spanish state, which were the fourth largest in the world. They sent most 
of the gold to Moscow for several reasons, including the fear of Nationalist 
troops on the outskirts of Madrid. The Spanish government also hoped to 
avoid the financial obstacles in the Western banking system that resulted 
from the nonintervention pact, which made it difficult to complete 
international purchases of military equipment from Spain.
Stalin’s Motives
So why did the Soviet Union decide to intervene? The Soviet Union had 
been a big ideological supporter of the popular front strategy, which the 
Communist International, or Comintern, had adopted as a policy in May 
of 1935. When war broke out, all of the international communist parties 
issued immediate declarations of support for the Republic and expected the 
Soviet Union to intervene against fascist aggression.
However, for the USSR, this same global strategy mitigated against aiding 
the Spanish popular front government. Stalin had his eyes on the emerging 
fascist bloc and had been trying to cultivate an alliance with the Western 
democracies to counter the fascist threat. He worried that sending direct 
Soviet aid to Spain would undermine his own popular front diplomatic 
efforts to cultivate friendly relations with France and Britain.
The USSR had already signed a defensive treaty with France in May 1935, 
after Hitler had announced his intention to pursue the rearmament of 
Germany, although the treaty was more symbolic than substantive. In the 
effort to continue this rapprochement, Stalin agreed to support the British 
and French initiative of nonintervention. He apparently hoped, like Blum 
in France, that the nonintervention pact would actually function to contain 
the Spanish war and stop the influx of weapons from the fascist states to 
the Nationalists. Unlike Blum, however, Stalin was only willing to support 

95
12. The USSR and Mexico Aid the Republic
the policy if it worked, and if Germany and Italy continued arming the 
insurgents, then the USSR would reconsider its decision to abide by the 
pact. In effect, this was what happened.
So, was the aid part of Stalin’s larger strategy to protect the Soviet Union 
and contain the fascist powers? Or was it a cynical effort to turn Spain into 
a Soviet satellite state? Since the opening of Soviet archives, most academic 
historians who have begun to explore the vast repository of primary sources 
have argued for a much more limited view of Soviet intervention and control.
The USSR sent different messages to its different audiences that were 
often contradictory. The consistent message to the Western powers was 
that the USSR wanted to pursue a popular front alliance of democracy 
and communism to defeat the threat of fascism, which would benefit the 
collective security of all.
In the USSR, on the other hand, Stalin mobilized support for the Spanish 
“workers’ revolution” against fascism, which was a useful distraction from 
the massive purging of Communist Party leaders that was underway in the 
mid-1930s. In this narrative, which was also delivered to the international 
communist parties through the Comintern, aid to the Republic was part of 
an altruistic but ultimately revolutionary impulse to support the workers of 
the world in their struggles against the capitalist enemy.
But claims of altruism are undercut by the price-gouging calculations of 
Soviet aid, especially when contrasted with the extensive credit offered by 
the fascist powers to the Nationalists. And if Stalin was eager to promote 
a workers’ revolution in Spain to establish a Soviet satellite, it would seem 
odd to wait so long to decide to send aid.
Perhaps more important than Stalin’s true intentions was the reality on the 
ground. And there is no question that the influx of aid from the USSR, as 
well as the presence of Soviet military advisers, increased the influence of 
the Communist Party in the popular front government.
But, contrary to the assumptions of Western Cold War policy, Stalin was 
not an all-powerful leader who seamlessly translated his will into policy 
through the mechanisms of the totalitarian state. Stalin’s foreign policy in 
the 1930s was defined by weakness, not strength. The Soviet Union was 

12. The USSR and Mexico Aid the Republic
96
isolated and vulnerable, and Stalin had not yet fully consolidated his power 
at home. Thus, when he realized that aid to the Republic was not achieving 
any of his geostrategic aims, he began to wind down the flow of aid, as 
reflected in the timing of the shipments, although the Soviet advisers 
remained until the end.
Mexico’s Contribution
In contrast to the USSR, whose 
role has been meticulously 
analyzed and debated, Mexico’s 
much smaller contribution has 
received less attention. In part, this 
is because of the lesser monetary 
value, but it also reflects the vastly 
different geopolitical importance 
of the Soviet Union in comparison 
to Mexico. Nevertheless, Mexico 
was the Republic’s most loyal ally, 
and remained so to the bitter end, 
welcoming thousands of Spanish 
refugees and hosting the Republic’s 
government in exile.
The motives that led Mexico to 
intervene are complex. The affinity 
between the Spanish and Mexican 
Republics preceded the civil war 
and culminated during the government of Mexican president Lázaro 
Cárdenas from 1934 to 1940, particularly after the election in Spain in 
February 1936. Both Cárdenas and the popular front government in Spain 
pursued a strong social democratic agenda, including the commitment to 
legal land redistribution and workers’ rights, as well as secularization and 
anticlericalism.

97
12. The USSR and Mexico Aid the Republic
But Mexico’s support for the Spanish Republic had its own geostrategic 
and domestic motives. Cárdenas was trying to pursue a more independent 
foreign policy and wanted to use Mexico’s presence in the League of 
Nations to make the country visible on the world stage. The policy marked 
Mexico’s independence from the US and other major powers without 
pushing a direct confrontation. As a non-European country, Mexico was 
not pressured to join the nonintervention pact, and the US’s boycott was a 
unilateral policy that required no adhesion from other countries.
From a domestic perspective, Cárdenas considered the aid to the Republic 
as directly benefitting the Mexican revolutionary regime. Mexico was 
politically divided, and Cárdenas feared a possible right-wing uprising 
against his left-wing reformist agenda. Mexico had a strong and growing 
conservative movement, some of it openly pro-fascist, and much of the 
middle- and upper-class population supported the Nationalists.
And so, in the first few weeks after the coup, Cárdenas ordered the 
first shipment of 20,000 rifles and ammunition. Since this constituted 
most of the stock produced by Mexico’s national armaments factory, 
the government hired more munitions workers to increase production. 
However, estimates put the total value of goods sold at $2 million, which 
reveals the modest scope of Mexican arms production and shipping 
capabilities.
For Mexico, supporting the Spanish 
Republic did not have to directly defy US 
or European demands. At the same time, 
it was a daring moment in the history 
of Mexican diplomacy. It was the first 
time that Mexico inserted itself into 
an international conflict beyond the 
Americas.

12. The USSR and Mexico Aid the Republic
98
Cárdenas also empowered Mexican diplomats to mediate arms purchases 
and to argue against the nonintervention pact in the League of Nations. 
As the war drew to a close, Mexican diplomatic officials in France worked 
to help settle and relocate the stream of refugees pouring over the border, 
thousands of whom ended up in Mexico.
The question of how much foreign aid reached the Republic has always 
been more than a quantitative debate about resources. However, most 
historians would agree that the quantitative and qualitative doubts have 
largely been resolved. The truth is the tepid support of the Soviet Union 
and the spirited but paltry contributions of Mexico were inferior to the 
fascist aid to the Nationalists. As a result, the Republic lacked consistent 
access to a sufficient number of high-quality armaments, and this 
deficiency was an indisputable element in the Republic’s defeat.

Probably the most important deal facilitated by 
the Mexican government was the sale of several 
dozen airplanes from France in August of 1936. 
The Blum government had planned to send these 
planes directly but had to change course because 
of the nonintervention agreement. The Spanish 
ambassador in Paris asked the Mexican ambassador 
if Mexico would complete the purchase, and the 
sympathetic French minister of aviation agreed to

International 
Brigades Join 
the Civil War
T
he internationalization of the civil war went 
beyond diplomacy and foreign aid. It had a 
human face in the form of the volunteers from 
all over the world who came to Spain, ready to fight. 
Most of them fought in the International Brigades 
for the Republican side, and up to a third lost their 
lives. In this lecture, we consider two narratives that 
have created opposing memories of the International 
Brigades, one completely rosy and the other scathingly 
critical. Between these extremes, we can distinguish 
two different stories. The first focuses on the motives 
and goals of the volunteers. The other is about the 
complex reality they encountered on the ground. The 
question is, what role did the Comintern and the USSR 
play in the day-to-day functioning of the Brigades, 
and how did this shape the volunteers’ experience of 
the war?

101
13. International Brigades Join the Civil War
Formation of the Brigades
The idea for the International Brigades originated in the USSR as part of 
Stalin’s shift in Soviet policy in September 1936 from neutrality to direct 
support of the Republic. They would recruit volunteers from all over the 
world to fight in Spain in the name of anti-fascism. Over the course of 
the war, around 35,000 to 40,000 foreign volunteers arrived from over 50 
countries.
Franco weaponized the exaggerated 
presence of foreign fighters as 
further evidence of Stalin’s supposed 
grip on the Republic. At the same 
time, it was the Nationalists who set 
the precedent of accepting foreign 
soldiers, leaving them open to a 
similar charge about the influence 
of the fascist powers on their side.
The Brigades were meant to counter 
the presence of foreign troops on the 
Nationalist side but also to shame 
the democratic states into getting 
off the fence. Implementation was 
left to the Comintern, which was led by leaders from European communist 
parties, and which further delegated recruitment to local chapters. The role 
of Stalin or the USSR was purposefully minimized, whether for nefarious 
purposes or to emphasize the inclusive anti-fascist nature of the project.
The majority of the brigadiers were members of communist parties, 
answering the direct call of the Communist International to take up 
the anti-fascist cause in Spain. Up to a third of the volunteers were not 
Communist Party members but were equally attracted to the cause. 
There were Americans, British, and French who were frustrated by their 
countries’ weak claims of neutrality, and Germans and Italians who had 
escaped fascist regimes and were living in exile. Unemployed workers felt 
abandoned by democratic governments who had no apparent response to 
the economic depression.
Despite Franco’s 
claim, Russians were 
not present in the 
Brigades. The USSR 
sent about 2,000 
Russian military 
advisors, technicians, 
and pilots, but these 
joined a separate Red 
Army military unit 
called Operation X.

13. International Brigades Join the Civil War
102
Almost a quarter of all volunteers were Jews from across Europe and the 
US, and a few from Israel who communicated in the international Jewish 
language of Yiddish. Some of the older volunteers had military experience 
either in World War I or in the Irish War of Independence.
American volunteers mostly joined the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, which 
eventually comprised 3,000 men, 681 of whom died in Spain. While 
many came from the labor movement, fewer of the American volunteers 
had military experience, given the US’s much smaller presence in World 
War I. And while the majority of them were white, the unit also had the 
distinction of being racially integrated with 85 African American soldiers. 
One of them, Oliver Law, was promoted to officer status, giving him 
command over a mixed-race unit at a time when the US Army was still 
segregated.
For many African Americans, the pairing of racism, colonialism, and 
fascism had been confirmed with the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, the only 
independent African nation. African Americans were outraged by the 1935 
invasion, but both the US and Ethiopia discouraged foreign volunteers.
As a journalist, Langston Hughes traveled 
to Spain to cover the African American 
activities in the International Brigades. 
He explicitly made the connection between 
racial justice and anti-fascism when he 
equated the Nationalists with the Ku Klux 
Klan and fascism with the Jim Crow regime. 
Conversely, he painted a picture of a 
multiracial anti-fascist coalition that 
would dismantle colonialism as well as 
fascism.

103
13. International Brigades Join the Civil War
Deployment of the Brigades
Altogether the International Brigades constituted about 2% of the 
Republican forces, but they had great symbolic and sometimes military 
significance, both in Spain and in their home countries. The stories of 
brigadistas leaving for Spain in late 1936, or of the survivors returning two 
years later, brought the war home for many people outside of Spain who 
otherwise had no connection with the conflict.
Paris was the hub for brigadiers arriving from around the world, who were 
given passports, instructions, and travel arrangements to go to Spain by 
boat or train. Brigades were constituted as much as possible according to 
language, but the early organization was unsystematic and improvised. The 
goal was simply to get as many as possible to the Madrid front.
The 11th International Brigade, which was dispatched to Madrid in 
early November 1936, included the mostly Austro-German Edgar André 
Battalion, a company of British gunners, the Franco-Belgian Commune 
of Paris Battalion, and the mostly Polish Dabrowski Battalion. The first 
Americans arrived in January and February, after the Battle of Madrid. 
They joined the 15th International Brigade, which was on the Jarama front, 
where the rebels tried and failed to cut off the road between Madrid and 
Valencia, where the government had moved in November.
The Brigades were used as shock troops in all the major battles of the war 
and incurred higher rates of casualties than other Republican divisions. 
Estimates range between 15% and 30% mortality overall, compared with 
6% for Spanish troops.
The Brigades’ military contribution to the Republican effort is difficult 
to quantify, but they were on the front lines and fought bravely, by all 
accounts, if at different skill levels. Their most visible contribution was in 
the Battle of Madrid, where their arrival, along with the first Soviet planes 
and tanks, provided a huge military and morale boost to the struggling 
Republican army.
After August of 1937, the Brigades were integrated into the Republican 
army, and by early 1938, a combination of high casualty rates and slowed 
recruitment abroad made Spaniards the majority of the International 

13. International Brigades Join the Civil War
104
Brigades. In September 1938, Negrín disbanded the International Brigades 
and sent home the remaining 10,000 volunteers as part of the Republican 
government’s last-ditch strategy to get the democratic states to drop 
their neutrality. Still, the authorities held a massive send-off ceremony 
in Barcelona. It was attended by up to 300,000 people and marked by 
inspiring speeches of gratitude and international solidarity.
The Brigadiers’ Experience
Most likely, each soldier experienced the full range of emotions, from 
solidarity and inspiration to frustration, fear, and disappointment. 
The multiple languages spoken among the volunteers could seem in 
one moment the very embodiment of international solidarity, as when 
encampments would fill with revolutionary songs from different countries.
But the same diversity could be a barrier to effective communication in 
battle. Translators, especially for the minority languages, were scarce, so 
multilingual volunteers often played key roles. But commands could get 
muddled by multiple translations. After the April 1937 reorganization, 
when Spanish troops were integrated into every battalion, the Republican 
authorities encouraged the foreigners to learn Spanish. They even offered 
language instruction, but apparently not all were willing to put in the 
effort.
On a more mundane level, volunteers could be demoralized by the shortage 
of goods, uniforms, weapons, and food that often left them poorly clothed 
and armed. Their experience was part of a larger shortage of materials 
on the Republican side as a result of the nonintervention pact. But on 
the ground level, many blamed what they viewed as a disorganized or 
ineffective war effort by the Republican army, or even sabotage by “fifth 
column” or Trotskyist agents.
Suspicion about unequal distribution of goods could cause resentments 
between national groups. And some International Brigade troops claimed 
they were treated as second-class units, while some Spanish troops 
complained that the foreign volunteers were not deferential enough to the 
home troops.

Prominent writers immortalized the 
volunteers, as in Ernest Hemingway’s 1940 
novel For Whom the Bell Tolls. Although 
Hemingway was not a volunteer, he visited 
and befriended several of them, including 
officer Robert Merriman, on whom the 
book’s hero, Robert Jordan, was based. 
Most brigadiers at the time emphasized 
the heroic and selfless sacrifice of those 
who put their lives on the line for the 
anti-fascist cause.

107
13. International Brigades Join the Civil War
Opposing Narratives
Such everyday tensions between troops could have occurred in any war. 
The debates center on the bigger picture behind these problems. The anti-
communist narrative argues that the volunteers were abused and betrayed 
by their Soviet handlers. Instead of normal military discipline, this 
narrative claims that the Soviet commissars imposed terroristic purges, akin 
to what was happening in the Stalinist USSR.
There is clear evidence of harsh penalties imposed for desertion as well as 
suspicion of sabotage. But there is disagreement about whether these were a 
product of the need for strict discipline in a demoralized and defeated army 
or evidence of a dominant Stalinist culture of fear and denunciation. Overall, 
no more than a few dozen brigadiers ended up court-martialed. More 
broadly, the Soviets simply didn’t have the kind of totalitarian power in the 
plural political environment of Republican Spain that they had at home.
At the same time, there are plenty of accounts that reveal a culture of 
suspicion and conspiracy, especially aimed at the dissident communist 
Trotskyists of the POUM party and the anarchists. These groups were 
conveniently blamed for military failures and accused of fomenting 
defeatism and sabotage.
Those noncommunist foreigners who joined POUM or anarchist militias 
wrote scathing left-wing critiques of their treatment at the hands of Spanish 
or Soviet communists. The most famous was George Orwell’s account 
in his book Homage to Catalonia. More familiar to American readers is 
his 1945 dystopian novel Animal Farm, a dark parody of the Russian 
Revolution but informed by his personal experiences in Spain.
In the brigadiers’ own memoirs, a few share this critical view. But the 
majority identify the real betrayal as the one inflicted by the Western 
democracies who had abandoned Spain. As veteran Bill Bailey put it in the 
1984 American documentary The Good Fight, 
All sorts of countries could have done it, come to the aid, but they didn’t. 
And that’s the fitting part of it; the sad story about Spain itself is the fact that 
the rest of the world sold Spain out. They had a moment of truth when they 
could’ve stopped Hitler and the bastards missed the ball.

For the Republic, the volunteers symbolized the international solidarity 
shown by ordinary people in the face of the indifference of most of their 
governments. But their presence could not compensate for the lopsided 
quantity of resources flowing across the border for their Nationalist enemy.

The story of the foreign volunteers of the International Brigades 
continues to spark interest, as is clear from the ongoing publication 
of books and articles. From the US perspective, can you understand 
the continued fascination with the few thousand volunteers who 
went to Spain in the 1930s?

The Fascist 
Powers Aid the 
Nationalists
F
rom the initial moment of the coup, the 
Nationalists depended on loans, aid, soldiers, 
and weapons from the fascist powers, which 
were more forthcoming than the democratic powers. 
In this lecture, we consider several questions about the 
impact of this foreign aid. First, how did it impact the 
outcome of the war? Second, how much did fascist 
aid push the leaders to adopt more fascist policies, 
rhetoric, and symbols, and how much did it increase 
the influence of the fascist sector of the hybrid 
coalition?

14. The Fascist Powers Aid the Nationalists
Initial Assistance
On July 19, 1936, Franco sent 
personal emissaries to Rome and 
Berlin asking for aid, the same day 
that the president of the Republic 
sent his request to France. At this 
point, Franco asked only for help 
in transporting his colonial troops from Morocco to the mainland, where 
they would begin the march to Madrid. The rebels needed help bypassing 
an unexpected blockade of the Strait of Gibraltar by the Republican navy, 
the majority of which remained loyal to the government.
After weighing the risks and opportunities of aiding the rebels, Hitler and 
Mussolini independently approved an initial limited package of aid of 
planes and warships, apparently without knowledge of what the other was 
doing. The planes played a crucial role in bypassing the naval blockade. 
Between July and October, Operation Feuerzauber flew 13,500 soldiers 
across the straits, constituting the first large-scale airlift in history.
It is entirely possible that without this initial specific form of assistance, the 
Nationalist coup would have ground to a halt. The colonial troops, along 
with the Moroccan mercenaries, played a key role in the rapid conquest of 
the southwest in the first months of the war. In and of itself, the transport 
operation would not have been enough to secure Nationalist victory, but its 
absence might have led to immediate defeat.
Motives for Continued Aid
After the initial deliveries, both fascist leaders calculated that the risks of 
carrying on a plan of secret and limited military aid were low, if paired with 
official public support for the nonintervention agreement. No major power 
was invested in stopping them.
The payoff for the fascist states was a possible shift in the balance of 
power in western Europe. Both Mussolini and Hitler viewed geostrategic 
advantages in a possible friendly authoritarian regime in the southwestern 

14. The Fascist Powers Aid the Nationalists
112
corner of Europe. It would weaken France and force her to invest resources 
into protecting her southern flank. Mussolini also hoped a Spanish ally 
would help him challenge French and British control of the Western 
Mediterranean.
In contrast, a Republican victory would create a strong French-Spanish 
democratic axis, perhaps incorporating the USSR, which already had a 
defensive treaty with France. This was essentially the same argument that 
the French and British made in favor of helping the Republic. However, 
their logic was rejected by the conservatives, who feared communism more 
than they feared the authoritarian right.
Salazar’s authoritarian government in Portugal had made the same 
calculations and also did what it could to support the Nationalist cause. 
Salazar was worried about the threat to his own right-wing authoritarian 
government if the Republicans won. Between 8,000 and 12,000 
Portuguese volunteered as individual soldiers in the Spanish Foreign Legion 
under Nationalist command.
More importantly, Salazar permitted the fascist powers to ship their 
weapons and supplies through Lisbon into Spain in order to disguise their 
origin. He refused to allow international observers to monitor the border, 
arguing it was a violation of Portuguese sovereignty. The result was the 
Nationalists’ most reliable route to receive weapons and materials.
As the war dragged on, Germany and Italy developed other reasons—
economic, military, and ideological—for continuing to support the 
Nationalists. They claimed that their support was part of a joint European 
anti-communist alliance and crusade. While Hitler and Mussolini 
were genuine anti-communists, their rhetoric was probably strategic. In 
particular, they knew it would be viewed sympathetically on the part of 
British and French conservatives.
At the same time, this crusade helped bring the two fascist countries into 
closer alignment and set the groundwork for the Axis alliance. Both leaders 
utilized the slogan of anti-communism to explain the Rome-Berlin entente 
of October 1936. The following month, it was christened in a speech by 
Mussolini as the “Axis.” Also in October, Germany and Japan agreed to a 
vague Anti-Comintern Pact, which Mussolini joined a year later.

A Military Testing Ground
The years of the Spanish Civil War overlapped with massive military 
buildup in both Germany and Italy. Germany in particular had arsenals 
full of untested equipment. The country had been forbidden by the terms 
of the punitive Versailles Treaty after World War I to have a standing army. 
In March of 1935, Hitler announced he was abrogating the treaty with the 
passage of a law to recreate the national defense forces or army.
In June of that year, Germany negotiated the Anglo-German Naval 
Agreement, which permitted Germany to build a navy a third of the size 
of the British, but with parity in submarines. The agreement marked the 
beginning of the British policy of appeasement toward the Nazis.
Significantly, the Germans had refused Franco’s request to incorporate 
all foreign soldiers into the Spanish Foreign Legion under his command. 
Instead, the Nazis developed their own autonomous units. Over the 
course of the war, 19,000 German soldiers cycled into the Condor 
Legion, with no more than 5,000 in Spain at any time. Germany also 
cycled weapons through Spain, testing models and improving them with 
updated versions.
The Spanish Civil War emerged as an 
opportunity for the German military to try 
out new tactics and weapons and provide 
battle experience for its soldiers. Most 
famously, the German Condor Legion led the 
aerial bombing of the town of Guernica, 
in one of the first instances of using 
this tactic solely to terrorize civilian 
populations.

14. The Fascist Powers Aid the Nationalists
114
In terms of new tactics, the Germans developed a three-wave bombing strategy 
and ended up dropping more than 21 million tons of bombs during the war. 
Likewise, the independent Italian units requested permission to implement 
their own new military tactics. In particular, they previewed the guerre celere, 
or the “lightning offensive.” This was employed successfully in the Nationalist 
victory at Málaga, and later in the disastrous Battle of Guadalajara.
Nazi Germany also benefited economically. They took advantage of the 
Nationalist need for weapons and supplies to set up a lucrative exchange 
between German manufactured goods and Spanish raw materials. Thus, 
the agreements signed between Hitler and Franco included commercial 
rights to the sale of minerals as well as the establishment of Spanish-
German companies that monopolized the export trade.
Escalation of Aid
German and Italian aid and public support accelerated when the Soviets 
decided to abandon the nonintervention pact in October 1936. Most 
dramatically, the Italian and German ambassadors to Spain traveled 
to Burgos in November to recognize the establishment of the official 
Nationalist government. More substantively, Hitler made the decision to 
form the Condor Legion, which arrived in Spain by sea in early November.
Mussolini underwent an even more dramatic evolution. Initially reluctant 
and cautious, his military commitment far surpassed the limited German 
engagement by the end of the war. The key turning point came on 
November 28, 1936, when Mussolini signed a secret anti-communist treaty 
with the Nationalists. The treaty promised aid in return for Italian military 
bases on the Spanish island of Majorca, in the case of a war with France.
As a result of this treaty, Italy sent an entire division of armed forces under 
Italian command, with a permanent presence of 40,000 soldiers. More than 
80,000 Italian troops cycled through Spain during the war, which was the 
largest concentration of foreign soldiers in the war. In addition to submarines 
and other weapons and ammunition, Mussolini also sent over 700 planes, 
about a third of them manned with Italian pilots. Italy’s overall expenditure 
on the war was $354 million, versus $215 million from Germany.

115
14. The Fascist Powers Aid the Nationalists
Hitler’s priorities were elsewhere. He didn’t want to undercut his 
rearmament goals with excessive aid in a corner of Europe where Germany 
had no permanent interests. The Rome-Berlin entente included an 
oral provision recognizing the Mediterranean as “an Italian sea,” while 
Germany was to have free reign in the Baltic Sea. After that agreement, the 
Germans pulled back on further commitments of troops and personnel in 
Spain and refused requests to send in army divisions.
Only at the very end of the war did Mussolini decide that it was time to 
shift his resources to battlegrounds that would reap concrete benefits for 
Italy, following Hitler’s lead. Some analysts have suggested that Mussolini’s 
expenditure on the Spanish war weakened Italy’s military capacity in the 
Second World War.
Impact of Fascist Aid
How important was this fascist foreign aid to the Nationalist victory? On 
the one hand, without this aid, the Nationalists would not have had a 
fighting chance. The conspirators’ original plan expected a full military 
revolt, which would have immediately put all the resources of Spain’s armed 
forces into their hands. The failed coup left the Nationalists completely 
dependent on sympathetic governments.
While Hitler and Mussolini each had their own strategic reasons 
for stepping into the breach, the attraction of an anti-communist, 
authoritarian, nationalist regime in Spain was part of the appeal for both 
fascist leaders. Even so, the vulnerable Nationalists had the most to gain.
In March 1937, Italian troops suffered a 
spectacular defeat in the Battle of Guadalajara, 
after which hundreds of Italian troops were taken 
as prisoners of war. In rage and humiliation, 
Mussolini doubled down on his commitment to supply 
the Nationalists until their victory against 
the reds.

14. The Fascist Powers Aid the Nationalists
116
It seems clear that this fascist infusion of aid and support had an impact 
on the ideological and rhetorical face of the regime. It inevitably raised the 
profile of this sector of the coalition. More broadly, it brought home two 
realities that seemed to indicate which direction Europe was heading: the 
rising tide of fascism and the cowering of the democratic powers.
At the same time, Franco’s opportunism is evident with how easily he 
began to shift course from the end of 1942, as the fascist star began to dim 
and the defeat of the Axis powers became increasingly clear. Conversely, 
if the Axis powers had won the war, Franco and the Nationalists would 
have fit comfortably into the parameters of a fascist Europe, albeit as a 
subordinate cog in the hierarchical reordering of the continent.

Vatican and 
Church in Spain’s 
Religious War
O
ne of the unique aspects of the Spanish 
Civil War was that it was a war of religion. 
Republicans saw the church as an obstacle 
to progress, democracy, and social justice. And it was 
true that the Catholic Church had been institutionally 
and ideologically entwined with the conservative, 
monarchist, and wealthy forces of the country 
throughout the modern period. In this lecture, we 
look at the evolution of the church’s support for the 
Nationalists and how the defense of religion mobilized 
Catholic support outside of Spain, eventually including 
the international Catholic authority of the Vatican.

119
15. Vatican and Church in Spain’s Religious War
Mobilization of a Holy War
Inside Spain, the religious divide opened in the early 19th century, with the 
abolition of the absolutist monarchy and the expropriation of church and 
monastic properties. After that, Spain’s constitutional regimes reconciled 
with the church. They retained Catholicism as the official religion of the 
state and included financial support to replace the income lost through 
expropriation. At the same time, the church turned to wealthy donors to 
augment its resources.
The first president of the Republic, 
Niceto Alcalá Zamora, advocated for 
a “gradual, peaceful” secularization 
of the state. Instead, the Republican 
coalition rejected Alcalá Zamora’s 
advice and embarked on an aggressive 
secularization campaign. They cut 
off state funding to the church but 
also went further to map out a plan 
for the closure of many convents and 
monasteries and all private Catholic 
schools.
Once the war broke out, positions 
hardened. On one side, a minority 
of radical anticlericals unleashed 
violence against church personnel 
and property. On the other side, 
the church officially joined the 
Nationalist coalition. The key document was the “Collective Letter from 
the Spanish Bishops to the Bishops of the World.” Issued on July 1, 1937, 
the letter launched an international appeal for support. It aimed to mobilize 
Catholic populations around the world in the name of the struggle between 
Christian civilization and atheist communism. In turn, the Republicans 
accused the church of allying itself with global fascism.

The mobilization of the holy war and the anticlerical violence emerged 
simultaneously with the outbreak of the war and the resultant collapse of 
central authority. Many ordinary Catholics saw themselves as soldiers in 
a holy war against atheistic forces. The Nationalists effectively mobilized 
and channeled this moral fervor, but they did not create it. Even after the 
war, there was a steep increase in Spaniards entering religious orders, part 
of a popular Catholic revival that was not simply invented by the pious 
Nationalist state.
During the first year of the war, the position of the Spanish church 
hierarchy shifted. It began with cautious reserve at the outbreak of the 
military rebellion. By early August, individual clergy members like Enrique 
Pla y Deniel, the bishop of Salamanca, began to publicly support the 
Nationalist cause. Finally, the collective letter of July 1937 signaled official 
endorsement of the Spanish church.
Pope Pius XI’s Discourse
Everyone was waiting for the pope to make an official pronouncement after 
the first two months of silence. In general, the Vatican and Pope Pius XI 
shared the social and political conservatism of the Spanish church, and 
the Nationalist leaders assumed that a public pronouncement would be 
forthcoming.
But it was not until September 14, 1936, that the pope made a speech to 
an audience of 500 Spanish clerics. Most were hoping that Pius XI would 
give his blessing to the sanctification of the civil war. But what he offered 
instead was a remarkably balanced discourse that avoided endowing the 
civil war with the status of a holy war.
Perhaps more remarkable was how the pope’s discourse was manipulated 
and mobilized by all sides in the international propaganda war. While it 
was widely disseminated and cited, each side highlighted only the parts 
that favored their cause. In the Nationalist zone in Spain, the official press 
distributed a truncated version that only included the parts condemning 
communism and praising the Christian virtues and heroism of the clerics 
who had become true martyrs.

121
15. Vatican and Church in Spain’s Religious War
The Nationalist version left out the other half of his message, which 
expressed horror at the fratricidal nature of the war. And while he gave his 
blessing to those who were defending God and religion, he also cautioned 
against the tendency toward unjustifiable excess in pursuit of this goal. 
More pointedly, he urged them to love those enemies, who were also 
beloved children and siblings, and treat them with compassion and mercy.
Nationalist Violence against Clerics
Despite the willful selective reading of the pope’s pronouncement, the 
Vatican continued to move cautiously. Only when the pope was convinced 
of the military inevitability of victory in May 1938 would the Vatican 
concede the official recognition that the Nationalists craved. Why did 
the Vatican hesitate? On a basic level, the pope was apparently genuinely 
reluctant to embroil the Vatican in a civil war. Moreover, he was faced with 
contradictory evidence—that is, a majority of Basque clerics had defended 
the Republic against the Nationalist uprising.
Even more troubling, in November of 1936, the pope had received a report 
from the bishop of Vitoria, Mateo Múgica. It explained how he had been 
forcibly expelled from his post for protesting to the Nationalists their 
execution of 14 priests in his diocese and the arrest of many others.
It was the Nationalists’ truncated version 
of Pope Pius XI’s discourse that convinced 
Bishop Pla y Deniel that the pope had given 
his blessing for a holy war, leading to the 
publication of his immensely influential 
pastoral letter, “The Two Cities.” Even when 
Pla y Deniel realized he had been given a 
partial text, he did not retract his own 
uncompromising embrace of a holy war.

15. Vatican and Church in Spain’s Religious War
122
The final toll of 19 clerics killed by the Nationalists, all in the Basque 
Country, was obviously miniscule compared to the 6,800 murdered by 
the Republicans. Nevertheless, the killing of any clergy was enough to 
disturb the pope. In the Basque Country, the Vatican saw a dissonance 
between claims to defend God and religion and the persecution of religious 
personnel.
The killing of clergy in the Basque Country was a special case, rooted 
in the history of regional nationalism and its relationship to Spanish 
nationalism. Both Catalonia and the Basque Country had been advocating 
for regional autonomy, which the Republican government supported. 
For Catalonia, it had already approved a statute in 1932 that created the 
Catalan Generalitat.
Negotiations had been underway with the Basque Nationalist Party, the 
PNV, to do the same for the Basque Country, but the outbreak of the 
civil war interrupted the process. Nevertheless, the promise of autonomy 
convinced the majority of Basques, including the devoutly Catholic PNV, 
to support the Republican side. For their loyalty, they were rewarded with 
an autonomy statute on October 1, 1936. Significantly, with the PNV in 
charge, there was no anticlerical violence, church burning, or assassination 
of clerics—with the exception of 
those killed by the Nationalists.
What led to these killings? For 
the Nationalists, a unified and 
homogeneous vision of the Spanish 
nation opposed all regionalisms as 
existential threats. This version of a 
monolithic Spanish nation had been 
defended by conservatives since the 
beginning of the 19th century. In 
their view, there was no distinction 
between regional autonomy and 
separatism.
Some historians 
have argued that 
the uncompromising 
centralism of 
the Spanish state 
actually produced its 
nemesis. By refusing 
to incorporate 
regional identities 
into a multicultural 
Spanish nation, they 
ended up promoting 
the very separatism 
they feared.

123
15. Vatican and Church in Spain’s Religious War
It was only in the one Nationalist outpost of Vitoria where the rebels 
encountered clerics affiliated with Basque regionalism and Republicanism. 
It was in Vitoria that the rebels shot 14 Basque clerics as “separatists.” 
And it was this event that sparked Bishop Mateo Múgica’s protest to the 
Nationalist Junta and his expulsion from his post.
Significantly, Bishop Múgica was not a Republican sympathizer. However, 
the killing of clerics was one step too far. He fled Spain to spend the rest 
of the war in the Vatican City, along with Bishop Vidal y Barraquer. The 
latter was shunned for promoting the reconciliatory part of the pope’s 
message as well as his Catalanist leanings. These two bishops were among 
the five who refused to sign the collective letter of July 1937, a small 
minority compared to the 43 bishops whose names appeared.
Impact of the Church’s Support
The bishops’ letter was less a declaration of principles than an act of 
international propaganda. It had been explicitly requested by Franco and 
orchestrated by Cardinal Goma, who was also serving as the pope’s special 
envoy to Franco during this period. Franco wanted to circulate the letter 
in the international Catholic press as evidence of overwhelming church 
support for the Nationalist cause. Its aim was to neutralize the bad press 
about the assassinated Basque clerics and the broader pattern of Nationalist 
violence against Republican civilians.
As such, it took a very different tone than the pastoral letters directed at a 
domestic Spanish public. It explicitly rejected the label of holy war. Instead, 
it narrated a simple cause-and-effect story of anticlerical violence followed 
by reluctant self-defense. It also declared the bishops’ intention to resist 
the influence of “foreign ideologies,” implicitly including Nazism and 
fascism as well as the communism of the enemy. In its wide and effective 
dissemination in the international Catholic press, it was often accompanied 
by dramatic photos of gutted churches, acts of sacrilege, and mutilated 
corpses. The total effect was devastating for the Republican cause in the 
international court of public opinion, especially among Catholics in the 
democratic countries.

15. Vatican and Church in Spain’s Religious War
124
By the time that Franco declared victory on April 1, 1939, the Catholic 
Church in Spain as well as the Vatican had given their full institutional 
and moral support to the new regime. The church highlighted the regime’s 
Catholic identity and brushed over its unsavory relations with fascist and 
Nazi dictators. In a religious ceremony full of medieval pomp and attended 
by military and religious authorities, Franco embraced the language of 
Catholic victory.
This National Catholic alliance began to unravel only decades later. The 
turning point was the Vatican II congress in the 1960s, when the Catholic 
Church fully embraced liberal democracy as well as social justice issues. 
Vatican II would in turn inspire a young generation of priests inside Spain 
to reject the Francoist dictatorship as being opposed to true Christian 
values. One of these values was the reconciliation that Pius XI had 
defended decades earlier. This process culminated in the 1970s when the 
church dramatically repudiated its affiliation with the dictatorship and its 
having taken sides in the civil war.
At the same time, the apology did not immediately repair the damage 
from the church’s affiliation with a repressive dictatorship. There was a 
dramatic decline in observant Catholics during the last decades of the 
dictatorship and beyond. This apparent conundrum serves as powerful 
evidence as to how the effort to enforce and politicize unified religious 
practice can backfire. Like other aspects of the conflict, Spain’s religious 
war had a lasting impact that continues to shape Spanish society up to the 
present day.

The Propaganda War 
in a Divided Spain
T
he thought of war may not conjure up visions 
of poetry, posters, paintings, and films. But 
in the early 20th century, a close relationship 
emerged between these media and the demands of 
total war. The relationship was cemented during the 
First World War, which required mass mobilization of 
the millions of young men called on to fight, and of 
those who remained at home to work and sacrifice 
for the war effort. The Spanish Civil War fits into this 
trajectory of total war and propaganda. It also has an 
added international and popular dimension that was 
distinct from either of the world wars. In this lecture 
we examine how the Republican and Nationalist 
governments tried to mobilize their own populations 
while private citizens inside and outside Spain took the 
lead in pleading their cause to the world.

127
16. The Propaganda War in a Divided Spain
International Propaganda
In common parlance, we often apply the word propaganda to speech that 
is intentionally false or manipulative rather than objective. But it really 
has a broader meaning. Propaganda refers to any speech and other artifacts 
designed to persuade the audience, which also implies an emotional 
dimension.
The vast majority of international propaganda supported the Republican or 
anti-fascist cause, most visibly propaganda produced by prominent artists 
and intellectuals, from George Orwell to Ernest Hemingway and Pablo 
Picasso. What explains this explosion of public political commitment on 
the part of artists and intellectuals?
On the one hand, it was both a symptom and a cause of the 
internationalization of the civil war. As we know, the war came to 
symbolize the black-and-white moral choices of a polarized political 
landscape: Christian civilization versus communist atheism, or anti-fascism 
and democracy versus fascism.
On the other hand, it was also a specific response to the nonintervention of 
democratic governments on the Republican side. This decision created, for 
many, a moral imperative for democratic citizens to intervene themselves. 
Some heeded this imperative by volunteering for the International 
Brigades; others produced art, music, theater, and literature that aimed to 
touch the hearts and minds of ordinary citizens, as well as to shame their 
governments into stepping up.
The smaller number of conservatives outside Spain who contributed to 
pro-Nationalist propaganda mostly belonged to Catholic networks in the 
democratic countries. This propaganda was less focused on supporting 
the Nationalist cause per se than on demonizing the Republicans through 
publicizing the anticlerical violence.
We can see evidence for the lopsided international support for the Republic 
among contemporary intellectuals in the response to a collective document 
called “Spain: The Question.” It was issued in June of 1937 by a group of 
prominent writers, including Nancy Cunard, W. H. Auden, Pablo Neruda, 
and Stephen Spender.

16. The Propaganda War in a Divided Spain
128
It began with the declaration that intellectuals were compelled to take 
sides in the global struggle against fascism, which was currently playing 
out in Spain. The question was simple: Were you for or against the legal 
government and the people of Republican Spain, or for or against Franco 
and fascism? Of those 148 who contributed their responses, 127 declared 
themselves for the Republic, 16 declared neutrality, and 5 were against.
The question invoked the recent bombing of Guernica on April 26, 1937, 
by the German Condor Legion as part of the evidence of the murder and 
destruction wrought by fascism. Images of the town’s destruction would 
become a key motif in pro-Republican efforts to simplify the moral stakes 
of the war.
The documentary film The Spanish Earth was produced in early 1937 by 
a group of American writers and filmmakers who wanted to show their 
support for the Republic and for the American volunteers of the Abraham 
Lincoln Brigade. The group included Ernest Hemingway, John Dos Passos, 
Lillian Hellman, Dorothy Parker, and Orson Welles. They formed a 
company to fund the project of the Dutch filmmaker Joris Ivens. Aimed at 
a US audience, the key points were to highlight the affiliation between the 
Nationalists and Nazism and to minimize the link between the Republican 
people and Soviet communism.
The Republican and Nationalist 
governments made their own 
contributions to efforts to sway foreign 
audiences. Both sides often employed 
visual images of suffering and 
victimhood to generate sympathy. The 
Nationalists relied heavily on photos 
of anticlerical destruction, which were 
circulated through an international 
network of Catholic publications 
and organizations. The Republicans 
exported posters of frightened women 
and children cowering under Nazi 
planes with visible swastikas, to drive 
home the Nationalist slaughter of 
innocent civilians.
Children’s drawings, 
collected by the 
Ministry of Education 
from schools in Madrid 
and Valencia, were 
distributed abroad 
with the help of the 
Carnegie Institute of 
Spain. More than 600

Picasso’s Guernica
British journalist George Steer wrote an influential on-the-ground account 
of the Guernica attack that was published on April 28 in the major French, 
British, and American newspapers. He emphasized the novelty and 
quantity of heavy bombs and the evidence of Luftwaffe insignia as proof of 
Nazi noncompliance with the nonintervention pact.
Steer’s account caught the attention of the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso, 
who had been living and working in Paris for many years. Picasso had been 
considering ideas for a painting that the Spanish Republican government 
had commissioned for the upcoming international exposition in Paris in 
July. After the bombing, he began working feverishly on the enormous 
canvas that would become one of the most famous propaganda pieces of 
the 20th century.
The Paris exposition where Guernica would be displayed was itself a 
major staging ground for international propaganda. Notably, the two 
most imposing structures were the 15-story Nazi pavilion and the equally 
monumental Soviet pavilion, which faced each other on either side of the 
Eiffel Tower.
The Spanish pavilion was designed as an appeal for international aid and 
solidarity for a nation under siege. The entrance featured a photomural 
of Republican soldiers with declarative phrases embodying the message 
that the Republic represented the freedom of the people of Spain against a 
foreign-financed fascist enemy.
Inside the pavilion, Picasso’s painting covered one wall. On another wall, 
the Spanish painter Joan Miró painted his mural The Reaper, also known 
as Catalan Peasant in Revolt. In retrospect, the pavilion was a dazzling 
and poignant display of world-class art, brought together under the most 
unfavorable conditions by an embattled Republic at war. In the moment, 
however, it was largely a failure. The Spanish pavilion’s humble structure 
and the challenging modernist aesthetic of Picasso and Miró’s paintings left 
many viewers underwhelmed or confused.

131
16. The Propaganda War in a Divided Spain
However, Guernica’s reputation gathered steam in a series of traveling 
exhibitions that began after the exposition. In September 1938, it traveled 
alone to London, in an exhibit arranged by the British Labour leader, 
Clement Attlee, a strong supporter of the Republican cause. Another 
exhibit was arranged by an organization that collected donations for 
Republican Spain. After the war, the painting began a tour in the United 
States to raise funds for Spanish Republican refugees. The tour culminated 
in a retrospective Picasso exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New 
York at the end of 1939.
Domestic Propaganda
Each side dedicated propaganda to mobilizing the support of the 
population living in the Republican and Nationalist zones. Radio was the 
new mass communication technology of the era, but ownership was much 
lower than in the US or in Nazi Germany.
Picasso entrusted MoMA with Guernica’s 
safekeeping, along with the instruction 
that it not be returned to Spain until 
liberty, democracy, and a republic had 
been restored. These conditions only 
emerged after 1978, after Picasso’s death, 
and the painting finally arrived in 1981. 
It is now housed in Madrid’s Reina Sofia 
modern art museum as part of an extensive 
exhibit of civil war artifacts.

In Spain, printed propaganda was still primary. And in a country with high 
illiteracy, the poster was the fundamental medium. They were plastered 
everywhere in cities and towns. Their combination of arresting images 
and few words, along with the ease of reproduction and distribution, made 
them efficient instruments to disseminate each side’s message among the 
Spanish population.
It shouldn’t be surprising that the variety and quantity of Republican 
posters outstripped the Nationalist production, simply as a result of the 
greater heterogeneity and decentralization in the Republican zone. Each 
party or trade union or local committee issued its own posters to mark its 
place in the popular front. There were posters aimed at the soldiers fighting 
the war. Others pushed to mobilize the rearguard economy. And there were 
the posters defining the enemy.
There was another independent propaganda organ on the Republican side: 
the International Association of Friends of the Soviet Union. At times 
in sync with the Republican government and at times at cross-purposes, 
this association was formed before the war as part of the USSR’s own 
international propaganda campaign.
In order to counter the juggernaut of anti-communist propaganda around 
the world, the Comintern encouraged the establishment of branches of 
the association in every country. With the outbreak of the civil war, the 
Spanish branch was reorganized and expanded. It benefited greatly from 
the widespread sympathy in Spain that followed the USSR decision to send 
aid to the Republic. It continued to celebrate the accomplishments of the 
USSR but added the goal of publicizing Soviet generosity in helping its 
Spanish brothers and sisters.
For the most part, the association echoed the main themes of the 
Republican government, which was also grateful for Soviet aid. Reflecting 
the Spanish popular front’s effort to emphasize its democratic identity, 
the association insisted that it was completely independent from the 
Communist Party or any political platform. However, it was also 
promoting the interests of a communist foreign government, which could 
undermine the Republic’s democratic image.

133
16. The Propaganda War in a Divided Spain
The Nationalist posters were generally more uniform, reflecting the fact 
that the Nationalist operation was more centralized and hierarchical. In 
addition, there was certainly no independent Nazi or Italian propaganda 
circulating in the rebel zone.
Both sides shared the tendency to define the enemy in simplistic terms. 
Thus, the popular front was equated with bolshevism and anarchism, which 
in turn were linked with destruction. Outside of Spain, the focus was solely 
on communism, because few outside Spain had heard of anarchism.
But Nationalist propaganda differed from the Republican side when it 
came to defining their own cause. While Republican propaganda reflected 
a diverse and fractious population, the Nationalists were united under 
authoritarian leadership. As a result, we don’t see the same tensions and 
mixed messages in Nationalist propaganda. Posters that defined what they 
were fighting for focused on a few simple themes; these included the unity 
and greatness of Spain, the figure of the leader, and the religious crusade.
It’s clear that propaganda was a fundamental feature of the Spanish Civil 
War, both internationally and domestically. In a war that depended on 
foreign aid and volunteers but was restrained by a poorly implemented pact 
of nonintervention, thousands of individual citizens and groups stepped 
into the breach left by passive governments. Against a deeply polarized 
ideological backdrop, many observers believed that not taking sides was no 
longer an option in what they were convinced was the grand struggle over 
the future of Western civilization.

Question

The mobilization of art and literature for political causes 
dramatically expanded in the 20th century, leading to ongoing 
debates about the role of artists and intellectuals in modern society. 
Should artists be involved in “pure” and “universal” creative 
production, or are they inevitably and understandably caught up in 
the causes of their time? What are your thoughts about this debate in 
reflecting on their advocacy in the Spanish Civil War?

Military Campaigns 
in the Spanish 
Civil War
T
he military history of the Spanish Civil War 
has always taken a back seat to the political 
drama, but it was on the battlefield that the 
Nationalists won and the Republicans lost the war. 
It’s hard to pinpoint the key turning point after which 
defeat for the Republicans became inevitable, but 
the war steadily turned against them after the end 
of 1936. The successful defense of Madrid that fall 
was the high point for the Republicans. It slowed the 
advance of the Nationalists, but their military forces 
never gained the upper hand. This lecture examines 
several key battles and how the outcomes affected the 
strategies on each side.

17. Military Campaigns in the Spanish Civil War
136
Early Days and the Siege of the Alcazar
Republican forces managed to crush a few islands of initial Nationalist 
resistance within their territory. The rebel garrisons of Oviedo and Gijón 
inside the Republican stronghold of Asturias were defeated in the first 
few weeks by militias comprised of socialist and anarchist trade union 
members. It would take the Nationalist army another year to conclude the 
conquest of the northern industrial corridor from Bilbao to Asturias.
The other major Nationalist outpost was the alcázar, or “fortress,” in the 
Republican-controlled province of Toledo. In contrast to Asturias, this 
high-profile contest was resolved in favor of the Nationalists after months 
of stalemate.
The conflict began after the outbreak of the coup, when the rebel military 
governor of the province, José Moscardó, had holed up in the old alcazar 
of the capital. He was accompanied by hundreds of Civil Guard troops 
and their families, along with all the ammunition from a nearby munitions 
factory. Despite launching numerous attacks and destroying many of the 
outer buildings, Republican troops could not dislodge the defenders.
The siege was finally broken when General Franco decided to deviate the 
course of the Army of Africa from its march to Madrid. The army arrived 
at the outskirts of Toledo at the end of September 1936. Many militia 
units fled rather than directly engage, but those trapped in the city were 
massacred on the spot. Nationalist propaganda ignored the carnage and 
focused on the heroic encounter between Franco and Moscardó, who 
became a Nationalist hero who was first promoted to general and later 
appointed count of the Alcázar of Toledo.
Although it had little military significance for 
either side, the siege and rescue of the alcazar 
became a cornerstone of Nationalist propaganda and 
mythology. Its symbolic significance was enhanced 
by the fact that Toledo was the first major city 
reconquered by the Christian armies against the 
Moors in the 11th century.

137
17. Military Campaigns in the Spanish Civil War
Short-Lived Republican Successes
The rescue of the alcazar may have contributed to the first major setback 
for the Nationalists—the Battle of Madrid. Franco’s delay of troops gave 
the Republicans more time to prepare their defenses. They could also take 
advantage of the first shipments of Soviet arms and tanks, as well as the 
incorporation of the first International Brigades. The tide turned briefly 
toward the Republicans.
The Nationalists continued their efforts to capture Madrid over the next 
couple of months. However, the Republicans successfully resisted these 
attacks at the Battles of Jarama and Guadalajara in February and March 
of 1937.
As a result of Republican victories in the Madrid region between November 
of 1936 and March of 1937, the front remained more or less stable during 
this period. The only major Nationalist victory during the period was in 
the far south at Málaga in February 1937.
By the fall of 1936, the city of Málaga was a Republican outpost in largely 
Nationalist territory. It was defended by anarchist and communist militia 
units, which operated independently and followed no chain of command. 
Like Toledo, it had more symbolic than military significance. For militia 
supporters, it offered proof that the 
revolutionary mobilization of the people 
could defeat the fascist enemy.
But the 12,000 untrained anarchist 
militiamen with fewer than 8,000 
modern rifles were no match for the 
10,000 Italian and 15,000 Nationalist 
troops that converged on the city from 
four directions at the end of January 
1937. Within five days, the Nationalists 
had captured the city and consolidated 
control over western Andalusia. The 
defeat exacerbated the internal political 
divisions on the Republican side.
This Republican 
victory in the Battle 
of Jarama came at a 
cost. The British and 
American brigades 
lost between a fourth 
and a third of their 
men. At the Battle of 
Guadalajara, Italian 
troops suffered a 
humiliating defeat, 
after which the 
Nationalists shifted 
their attention 
away from capturing 
Spain’s capital.

17. Military Campaigns in the Spanish Civil War
138
Nationalist Conquest of the North
After their failure to capture Madrid, the Nationalists developed a 
systematic strategic plan to conquer Republican territory piece by piece, 
while the Republican government was in the midst of a divisive political 
crisis. The first phase in the plan was the conquest of the northern corridor 
of the Basque Country, Santander, and Asturias.
These regions were of special interest to the Nationalists for their enormous 
industrial capacity. Conquest would also give them the majority of the 
country’s population. While the Nationalists plotted the pivotal offensive 
to the north, the Republican army could only manage diversionary 
defensive fronts at Brunete and Belchite, which were ill-fated attempts at 
drawing Nationalist resources away from the northern front.
The conquest of the North began in the Basque Country in March of 
1937. The German Condor Legion led the Nationalist domination of the 
sky, bombing both military and civilian targets, including the infamous 
bombing of the town of Guernica.
The Republican army and government in the main province of Vizcaya 
was under the control of the new Basque autonomous government. Political 
and military control in the Basque region was in the hands of the Basque 
Nationalist Party, which was conservative and Catholic. They supported the 
Republic because it had delivered them regional autonomy, but there had 
been minimal violence. Still, the Basque army suffered from the same lack of 
guns, ammunition, and trained officers as the rest of the Republican army. It 
is telling that even in a place with minimal infighting or economic disruption, 
the purely military disadvantage of the Republican army proved decisive. 
Fierce fighting in the well-fortified city of Bilbao did slow the Nationalist 
advance across the North, but by mid-June, the Basque authorities capitulated.
Over the next few months, the Nationalist army plowed west through 
Santander, decimating more than half of the Asturian brigades sent to 
halt the advance. They finally entered the Asturian capital of Oviedo on 
October 15 and the port city of Gijón on the 21st. Some escaped by sea, 
and a few retreated to the mountains, where they formed guerilla units. 
The victors inflicted the usual indiscriminate punishment on the perceived 
left-wing population that remained behind.

17. Military Campaigns in the Spanish Civil War
Nationalists Push East
A decisive phase of the war followed, from November 1937 to the summer 
of 1938. The Nationalist army drove east through Aragon toward the 
Mediterranean coast, hoping to cut what was left of the Republican territory 
in two. The remaining contiguous Republican territory was bordered on the 
northwest by Madrid, on the northeast by Valencia, and on the southwest 
by Granada. During this period, the Republican army continued to fight a 
defensive war. As before, they poured resources into a series of diversionary 
campaigns, but they were as ineffective as they were costly.
The Battle of Teruel in the winter of 
1937 to 1938 was one of the most violent 
confrontations of the war. The Republican 
offensive cost at least an estimated 
60,000 Republican and 40,000 Nationalist 
casualties, and critically weakened 
Republican forces.

17. Military Campaigns in the Spanish Civil War
140
Faced by a six-week Nationalist counteroffensive, the Republican forces 
were too worn down to hold their position. The defeat then left the 
Republican forces too depleted and weak to face the Nationalist offensive 
in Aragon that began in early March 1938. The 15th International Brigade, 
which contained the American, Canadian, and British battalions, was 
moved to the Aragon front and suffered catastrophic losses amidst the 
general rout of the Republican forces. On April 1, most of the remaining 
Abraham Lincoln Brigade was killed or captured outside Gandesa.
On the Nationalist side, both German and Italian planes played a major 
role in strategic bombing of troops and civilians fleeing the zone. On 
April 15, the Nationalist army reached the Mediterranean Sea at Vinaroz, 
and the Republic was cut in two. And so the stage was set for the last 
phase of the war, from summer 1938 until the conquest of Catalonia in 
February 1939.
The Battle of the Ebro
These were desperate months for the Republic. As the Nationalists closed 
in, prolonging the war became a last-ditch strategy. Perhaps if they could 
hold on long enough, the European democracies would finally intervene or 
at least push for a negotiated peace.
The Republican army staged a last stand in the Battle of the Ebro. The 
attack began in July 1938 to stop the Nationalist advance on the capital of 
Valencia. The Republicans benefited from the brief opening of the French-
Spanish border, which allowed a replenishment of arms and supplies. On 
July 24, 80,000 Republican troops successfully crossed the Ebro River. 
They established a beachhead along a sparsely defended front, penetrating 
13 miles into Nationalist territory.
Franco was apparently taken off guard. There was even some grumbling 
about his leadership and his decision to concentrate his full forces in 
repelling the advance. His decision unleashed the deadliest battle of the 
civil war. The Battle of the Ebro ended four months later, with up to 
70,000 Republican and 60,000 Nationalist casualties.

141
17. Military Campaigns in the Spanish Civil War
Once the Nationalists sent in reinforcements, the battle settled into a 
costly stalemate at Gandesa, where the Abraham Lincoln Brigade had been 
decimated several months earlier. The Republican forces returned to the 
defensive, digging in against yet another overpowering counteroffensive 
that displayed the Nationalists’ superior firepower and resources.
Still, they held on for more than three months. A combination of strategic 
mistakes, faltering chain of command, and inexperienced new recruits in 
the Nationalist army played into Republican hands. Eventually, however, 
the last of the Republican forces withdrew on November 16 to defend 
Catalonia.
The Fall of Catalonia
The Nationalists launched their frontal attack on Catalonia on December 
23, 1938. On January 3, they broke through the last major Republican 
defenses protecting the advance on Barcelona, although heavy bombing of 
the city began earlier. The government fled Barcelona on January 23, and 
the Nationalists marched into the capital three days later.
After the fall of Catalonia, Britain and France recognized Franco’s regime 
on February 27, and President Azaña resigned. However, Prime Minister 
Juan Negrín and his government continued to resist surrender at all 
costs. But by this point, defeatism had taken hold among some sectors. 
A group of army officers in Madrid under Segismundo Casado believed 
it was possible to negotiate an honorable peace with Franco and sought 
to overthrow the Negrín government. In an ugly ending to a tragic war, 
Republicans turned on Republicans. The attempted coup was defeated, but 
it only hastened the war’s end.
Looking back from the Nationalist victory in 1939, it is easy to view it as 
inevitable from the outset. They benefited from a steady stream of high-
quality arms and supplies and had the substantial support of the disciplined 
and well-equipped German and Italian units, in addition to the professional 
Army of Africa. The clear chain of command and well-organized supply 
chains kept the Nationalist army more focused. The Republican forces 
lacked all of these advantages, and the political divisions and internal 

17. Military Campaigns in the Spanish Civil War
142
power struggles within the Republican government clearly undermined 
their military capacity. The result was a resounding military defeat for the 
Republic, but the vindictive and unconditional victory imposed by the 
Nationalists brought neither peace nor a true end to hostilities.

Guernica to 
Madrid: The Urban 
Battlefield
I
n the larger history of 20th-century warfare, the 
urban target epitomized the growing civilianization 
of warfare. War was undergoing a transition 
between the largely trench warfare of the First World 
War and the incendiary carpet-bombing of World 
War II. That transition produced more civilian than 
military victims for the first time in a major European 
war. Although the scale of urban destruction in 
Spain was smaller than in the Second World War, it 
was unprecedented at the time. This lecture looks 
at several urban areas that became military targets, 
mostly on the part of Nationalist army and air force.

18. Guernica to Madrid: The Urban Battlefield
144
The Bombings of Guernica and Málaga
Even though it was not a major city, the Basque town of Guernica came 
to symbolize the transition in warfare from soldiers killing each other to 
turning their firepower on defenseless civilians. In some ways, there was 
nothing special about the Guernica bombing. It was the combination of 
British journalist George Steer’s gripping on-the-ground reporting, printed 
in many major newspapers, followed by Picasso’s immortalization of the 
event in his painting which crystallized its emblematic role in 20th-century 
anti-war discourse.
The event took place on April 26, 1937, during a three-hour period when 
Condor airplanes carried out wave after wave of attacks—part of a new 
strategy being developed by the Nazi air force. The bombing occurred on a 
market day, so it was full of people from the surrounding villages as well as 
refugees from the eastern regions of the Basque Country. The total number 
of those killed or wounded is still disputed—anywhere from a few hundred 
to more than a thousand—but the majority of the town was destroyed. The 
town had no antiaircraft defenses, which allowed the planes to dive down 
to rooftop level. They dropped bombs on the narrow roads leading out of 
the city, which were clogged by panicked civilians.
In contrast to the worldwide attention to Guernica, the bloodbath that 
followed the Nationalist victory in Málaga a few months earlier had 
received little attention. The Nationalist commander Gonzalo Queipo 
de Llano had promised revenge for the violence perpetrated against 
Nationalist sympathizers by the revolutionaries in the first summer of 
the war. His revenge was the bombing and shelling of the refugees on 
the coastal road, who were heading for Republican territory in Almería. 
Several thousand refugees died trying to escape, while thousands more 
were summarily executed over the following weeks. An estimated 40,000 
civilians fled Málaga in the days after its defeat.
The Canadian doctor and International Brigadier Norman Bethune saw 
the aftermath firsthand. He went to Spain in late 1936 and developed a 
mobile blood transfusion unit that could treat soldiers at the front. After 
the bombing of Málaga, Bethune brought his team from Valencia to the 

145
18. Guernica to Madrid: The Urban Battlefield
Málaga-Almería road to help the refugees. He published an on-the-ground 
account in his 1937 book, in which he described what he called the largest, 
most horrible evacuation of a city that he’d ever seen.
Despite Bethune’s published account of the Málaga massacre, it was 
largely unknown until the early 21st century, when local officials began 
to organize commemorations. The contrast between Guernica and 
Málaga demonstrates the sometimes arbitrary nature of the international 
spotlight—an issue that continues to shape our understanding or ignorance 
of the many current conflicts around the world today.
The populations and government were at 
first completely unprepared for aerial 
bombardment, with no infrastructure of 
civil defense or air raid shelters. In the 
aftermath of the war, the ruined urban 
landscapes of cities served as brutal 
symbols of the unconditional victory of 
the Nationalists over Republican Spain.

18. Guernica to Madrid: The Urban Battlefield
146
The Siege of Madrid
Madrid received as much international attention as Guernica. Madrid was 
never captured, and the successful effort to defeat the Nationalist offensive 
was one of the major early turning points of the war. Although Nationalist 
troops were kept outside the city, fierce fighting on the outskirts and the 
bombing and blockade of the population brought civilians into the heat of 
battle.
The unlikely defense of the city began in the chaos of the Republican 
government’s decision to flee the city on November 6, as the Nationalist 
army confidently prepared their attack. The government left José Miaja, 
the newly appointed commander of the Madrid forces, in charge of the city. 
With no warning, no headquarters, and no government in place, Miaja’s 
orders were to defend the city at all costs and organize a defense committee.
He quickly formed a committee that represented all the political forces 
in the city. He appointed as his chief of staff Lieutenant Colonel Vicente 
Rojo. By all accounts, Rojo was one of the best officers on the Republican 
side. During the first weeks, he coordinated a defensive line along the two 
main points of Nationalist attack: in the Casa de Campo green space on 
the western border and the Manzanares River, which was a natural barrier 
to the south.
Although the siege of Madrid lasted for two years, the most intense fighting 
occurred in the first month along the banks of the river in the peripheral 
neighborhoods on the southwest and on the campus of Madrid’s University, 
near the Casa de Campo. Having failed to break through the Republican 
lines in the first couple of weeks, Nationalist aircraft began to bomb the 
city. These air raids killed an estimated 2,000 civilians. As the Nationalists 
moved their focus from Madrid to other fronts, and as the Republican air 
force was organized to protect the city, bombing raids declined.
Still, the civilian population continued to suffer. The Nationalist army 
did what it could to prevent supplies from entering Madrid, leaving the 
population short of food and warm clothes as winter set in. In addition, 
local officials were overwhelmed by the problems of clearing out rubble, 
uncovering corpses, and helping residents repair bombed-out buildings. 

147
18. Guernica to Madrid: The Urban Battlefield
The Republican government in Valencia created a committee in April 1937 
whose job was to manage all these challenges and protect Madrid’s cultural 
and artistic heritage from destruction.
Republican officials in Madrid also inflicted violence and terror against 
purported enemy citizens. Many presumed Nationalist supporters had 
been trapped in the city, up to 20,000 of whom took refuge in the city’s 
foreign embassies. The Nationalist general Emilio Mola famously boasted 
to an English journalist that he would take the city with his four columns 
of Moroccan and Spanish Legion troops, along with assistance from what 
he called the fifth column of secret supporters inside the city. The term 
fifth column has now become a ubiquitous phrase referring to internal 
subversion.
Republicans arrested and killed many suspected Nationalists, including 
more than 1,000 prisoners from the Cárcel Modelo who were taken out on 
November 11 as Republicans were trying to prevent a Nationalist surge into 
Madrid. Over the course of the next month, the prisoners were executed in 
what have become known as the Paracuellos massacres.
Beyond this notable atrocity, more than 60 centers detained and tried 
civilians with perfunctory public trials, most of them linked to one 
of the popular front parties or organizations. An estimated 6,000 to 
8,000 suspected Nationalist sympathizers were killed in this process of 
extrajudicial terror in the capital city.
Attacks on Barcelona
Held in Republican territory for most of the war, Barcelona was identified 
both with revolutionary anarchism and Catalan nationalism. And as 
elsewhere, initially it saw a wave of wild violence against civilians linked 
to conservative parties and organizations. Scholars estimate that 8,000 
individuals were executed by Republican forces in Barcelona, either by 
ad hoc committees or later by the popular tribunals set up to administer 
summary justice. A quarter of these were ecclesiastics, and many of the rest 
belonged to right-wing political parties.

18. Guernica to Madrid: The Urban Battlefield
148
To escape punishment, many of the wealthy inhabitants fled or donned 
working-class clothing to disguise their status. Similar to Madrid, a violent 
feedback loop emerged between rooting out internal fifth-column enemies 
and Nationalist aerial bombings. The civilian toll—both physical and 
psychological—soared within a city that was far from the front lines until 
the end of the war.
The Nationalists turned their full attention to the city after completing the 
conquest of the North and beginning the drive through Aragon that would 
separate Catalonia from the rest of the Republic. From the beginning of 
1938, regular aerial bombing campaigns were inflicted on the city, most of 
them by Italian planes stationed nearby on the island of Majorca.
The worst concentrated aerial bombardment took place over three days in 
mid-March, when raids left almost 1,000 dead and 1,500 wounded. Italian 
planes dropped 44 tons of bombs, including delayed-fuse bombs that were 
designed to pass through roofs before exploding inside buildings.
The Nationalists justified these bombings by claiming that supplies were 
stored in the basements of apartment buildings. However, it seems clear that 
the aim of demoralizing and punishing the civilian population must have 
played a role in the ongoing attacks on a city that was never on the front 
line of battle. More than 2,500 civilians were killed in Barcelona—almost 
half of the 5,500 deaths caused by aerial bombing in all of Catalonia.
As in Madrid, the Catalan government 
created defense committees to better 
protect the population and the 
architecture, but in Barcelona they 
mounted a particularly effective 
civilian defense infrastructure. They 
organized the construction of 1,400 
air raid shelters around the city, 
the majority of which used existing 
subterranean spaces or basements. 
Each shelter was guarded by residents 
in the neighborhood, whose job was 
to help people enter once the sirens 
announced an upcoming attack.
Over the course of 
the war, Barcelona 
was bombed 194 times, 
beginning in February 
1937 from a warship 
in the harbor, which 
caused 18 deaths. 
As a port city that 
received, stored, and 
distributed supplies 
arriving by sea, its 
warehouses, factories, 
and train depots were 
strategic targets.

18. Guernica to Madrid: The Urban Battlefield
By early 1939, when the remnants of the exhausted Republican army had 
fallen back to defend Catalonia, everything began to fall apart. Instead of a 
bitter fight to the end, demoralized Republican forces showed little interest 
in serious resistance. The Catalan government fled Barcelona on January 
23, and the Nationalists triumphantly entered the city three days later.
Almost half a million Catalans fled across the French border in the wake 
of the defeat. The victors were eager to assert dominance over a city that 
epitomized not only working-class revolution but Catalan nationalism. 
An estimated 4,000 were executed and thousands more imprisoned. 
In addition, the new government criminalized all public expressions of 
Catalan language, culture, and identity.

The War as Soldiers 
Experienced It
I
n this lecture, we turn from battles to the soldiers 
who fought them. Both armies began with 
significant untrained-but-enthusiastic voluntary 
units, but there was no upwelling of mass enlistment 
on either side. As a result, both armies increasingly 
relied on involuntary conscription as the war dragged 
on. And both suffered from the morale issues arising 
from a brutal and endless war.

19. The War as Soldiers Experienced It
152
Early Republican Forces
In the first stage of the war, the hastily organized Republican militia units 
were a heterogeneous mix of loyal soldiers from regular army units and 
members of different political parties and trade unions. In the chaos after 
the uprising, most army units on the Republican side were disbanded, so 
some soldiers joined the new units as volunteers.
But the majority of militias were comprised of working-class trade 
unionists. Many formed their own individual brigades, taking advantage 
of the government’s desperate decision to distribute arms to these 
organizations. Among the trade union volunteers, the majority were either 
unskilled laborers, agricultural workers, or unemployed, and most were 
young and unmarried. As members of anarchist, socialist, or communist 
trade unions, these were ideologically committed individuals, inspired by 
the call to fight against fascism.
The anarchists of the central zone created 19 battalions with 32,000 men, 
while the Communists recruited 25,000 into their Fifth Regiment division. 
Nevertheless, this was a relatively small group. Estimates put the total at 
about 120,000 men and a few hundred women who joined the militia units 
in the summer of 1936.

153
19. The War as Soldiers Experienced It
From the beginning, these units faced huge challenges, including lack of 
military experience, bad-quality weapons, and the absence of uniforms. 
The hodgepodge pattern of direct recruitment left commanders unsure of 
how many men they had under their command.
Even more serious was the profound distrust between professional officers 
and militiamen. Military men often viewed the militias as left-wing 
revolutionary rabble-rousers, while militiamen suspected the professional 
soldiers’ loyalties. Many anarchists and socialists were already anti-
militarist. The military’s hierarchical structure and culture of obedience 
seemed to imitate the same unjust social system they wanted to overturn.
As a result, militia volunteers generally rejected these military norms. 
Commanders reported that soldiers would leave their unit at will to return 
home or would disobey a direct order if they weren’t convinced of its 
usefulness. Or they would refuse to fight alongside militia units of different 
political identities.
All of these problems quickly convinced the Republican government of the 
need to create a regular army. But it is important to give the militias their 
due. They prevented what could have been a complete rout in July of 1936, 
giving the Republic space to reorganize both the government and the army. 
Their contribution was essential in the first weeks when the government 
didn’t know who to trust in the regular army. Even the mythologized vision 
of heroic workers served the Republic as a propaganda tool, held up as an 
inspiration for others to follow.
Early Nationalist Forces
The Nationalists had their own version of heroic warriors: the volunteer 
Carlist and Falangist militias whose iconic images appeared on their 
posters. And like the distinct Republican militia units, Carlists and 
Falangists were uneasy allies with very distinct worldviews and goals, 
united by a common enemy. Also similar to the Republican militias, the 
members were already mobilized in political organizations. The Falange 
established 116 battalions with more than 200,000 men, while the Carlist 
Requetés formed 35 units with 60,000 fighters.

19. The War as Soldiers Experienced It
154
Unlike the Republican militias, Falangists and Carlists were well outfitted 
with recognizable, distinct uniforms—blue shirts for the Falange and red 
berets for the Carlists. The Nationalists immediately integrated these units 
into the military command structure of what was already a professional 
army. As a result, the squabbles between them were kept more or less under 
control.
But tensions and incidents continued, especially after the forced unification 
into a single party, the Movimiento, which was dominated by the larger 
Falange. Some Carlists refused to wear the Falange uniforms or perform 
the fascist salute, and they resisted swearing the oath of the Movimiento, 
which they thought placed the country above God. Carlists supported the 
restoration of a Catholic monarch who would impose religious unity. In the 
end, they were never fully absorbed into the single party.
Conscription on Both Sides
The political and symbolic struggles that shaped militia life faded as the 
early volunteers were replaced or absorbed into the regular armies through 
mass conscription of ordinary Spaniards. The Republican decision to 
conscript came at the end of the summer of 1936 in the face of imminent 
defeat. For the Nationalists, the failure to take Madrid in the fall convinced 
them they would have to increase the military force for a long war. By the 
end, fewer than 1 in 10 soldiers who fought were volunteers, as conscripts 
became the main fighting force.
Recruitment was organized at the municipal level, through records kept 
by town halls of eligible men. All those on the list received instructions to 
present themselves at the town hall for medical examination, where they 
would be classified as fit, exempt, or unfit for service. Of the 5 million men 
theoretically eligible, about 2.5 million were called up by one side or the 
other. The rest were classified as unfit, sought exemptions, or found other 
ways to avoid service.
The Republic’s order included all those between the ages of 16 and 45, 
while the Nationalists limited the call to those aged 18 to 33. Nevertheless, 
both sides mobilized about the same number of men: 1.3 million for the 

155
19. The War as Soldiers Experienced It
Republicans and 1.26 million for the Nationalists. Each government set up 
processing stations that registered, outfitted, and assigned the new recruits 
to their units before sending them off to the front with minimal training.
Conditions Affecting Morale
A key difference between the two armies was the growing contrast in the 
matériel conditions for their soldiers, both for morale and in maintaining 
an effective fighting force. The Republicans’ economic problems, including 
the inflation, made it more difficult for them to buy the necessary supplies 
for their soldiers. Epidemics of scurvy reflected their poor diet. Shortages of 
blankets and boots generated various collection drives to provide what the 
government could not. For the same reasons, soldiers were either paid late 
or could buy little because of inflated prices. These problems led to looting 
and scavenging as well as desertions.
Meanwhile, the Nationalists experienced nothing like the extreme scarcity 
among Republican troops. Beyond more regular delivery of necessities, the 
Nationalist resources allowed them to provide small luxuries like alcohol or 
sweets, or Christmas bonuses and care packages.
Another common demand from soldiers was access to sex, supplied by 
prostitutes whose ranks were increased by privation among poor women. 
Both sides tolerated the practice, but the Nationalists tried to regulate it 
with official brothels and health screening certificates. On the Republican 
side, prostitution was unregulated, with apparently higher levels of venereal 
disease.
In general, the Nationalist soldiers 
expressed confidence in the ability of 
their leaders to supply their needs. In 
contrast, the Republican soldiers felt 
increasingly neglected and underserved.

19. The War as Soldiers Experienced It
156
At first, both armies tried to protect their poorly trained conscripts from 
the most dangerous operations, reserving them for defensive positions. The 
Nationalists could continue this practice because they had a larger corps 
of elite troops in the Moroccan Regulares and the Spanish Foreign Legion, 
in addition to the Italian divisions. Without this buffer, the Republicans 
leaned more heavily on the conscripts, who were marched long distances on 
foot to advanced positions. Placing poorly trained soldiers in the vanguard 
in turn probably weakened the next attack and started a downward spiral.
In addition to matériel and military conditions, troop morale depended 
on their understanding and interpretation of why their sacrifice mattered. 
The majority of recruits on both sides were peasants. Some were illiterate, 
and many had no political affiliations, unlike the early volunteers. So, 
both sides invested a significant propaganda effort in motivating them to 
withstand the hardships of war.
In a civil war, each side has to paint a picture of “us versus them” that 
is more complex than in a war against another nation. Whether this 
bifurcated vision resonated with the average recruit is an open question. 
Many peasants may have identified more with their small villages, so a 
battle for the soul of Spain may have seemed remote from their everyday 
experiences.
On the Nationalist side, the task of educating recruits was mostly left to the 
chaplains. They linked their cause with the religious crusade and painted 
a dire picture of Catholic Spain under siege from atheistic communists. 
Soldiers were told that this threat 
required strict discipline and 
obedience to win the battle.
The Republicans employed 
political commissars, influenced 
by the Soviet model. At the same 
time, their message was as infused 
with Spanish nationalism as the 
other side. Their version of the 
nation was linked with progress, 
enlightenment, and free thinking.
Whereas Nationalists 
didn’t require 
explicit ideological 
commitments from 
their soldiers, 
Republicans were 
more interested in 
convincing recruits 
of the righteousness 
of their cause.

157
19. The War as Soldiers Experienced It
Penalties for Evasion
Morale was a serious issue for both armies, given the length and brutality 
of the fratricidal war. However, it became one of the most serious issues for 
the Republican army during the final year. Low morale led to desertion, 
shirking, and self-mutilation, all time-honored strategies to avoid putting 
oneself in harm’s way.
These individual strategies for survival reveal the tepid enthusiasm of many 
ordinary men to join the struggle. From the beginning, the thousands 
of men who simply ignored mobilization calls became the first official 
deserters. Some fled to the mountains, crossed the border, or boarded a ship 
for the Americas. Both sides forbade travel abroad for all adult men, and in 
February 1937 they revoked all exemptions for military service to expose 
shirkers. Self-mutilators were either shot on the spot, placed in advanced 
positions, or left to die of gangrene on the field. In June of 1937, both 
sides again increased the penalties for failure to obey the call up. They also 
instituted mandatory reevaluations of those who had been deemed earlier 
unfit for service.
In August 1938 during the Battle of the Ebro, President Negrín tried a 
different strategy by proclaiming an amnesty for thousands of fugitives, in 
the hopes that some would take the opportunity to reenter society and join 
the dwindling Republican forces. But as a rule, both sides moved toward 
harsher measures, including the death penalty for defection to the other 
side. However, in general the Nationalists began with stricter traditional 
military justice, while the Republicans reluctantly accepted more draconian 
measures as indispensable in the face of disintegrating morale.
The shift from committed volunteers to conscripts seems to reflect a 
general pattern in which the ideological battle lines faded into struggles 
for everyday survival. While this point could apply equally to each side, 
this trend increasingly favored the Nationalists, especially from the end of 
1937. After that point, the combination of victory in battle and consistent 
supplies contrasted with Republican defeats and dwindling resources. As 
matériel fortunes shifted, the war was won or lost by the fighters who lived 
them every day.

How the 
Nationalists 
Organized for 
Victory
I
n this lecture, we examine how the Nationalists 
built a successful wartime operation beyond the 
battlefield. After the failed Madrid offensive, the 
Nationalist leadership prepared for a longer war. In 
addition to shifting their military strategy, they also 
pursued three major organizational goals: consolidating 
their authoritarian institutional structure, stabilizing 
their financial resources, and organizing the logistics 
to supply their soldiers and civilians with basic 
necessities.

20. How the Nationalists Organized for Victory
160
Consolidating the Authoritarian 
Structure
The emerging Nationalist political structure consolidated over the last 
year and a half of the war, after the foundation of the so-called New State 
in January of 1938. Since October 1936, when Franco maneuvered his 
appointment as head of state, the Nationalist side had effectively operated 
as a military dictatorship, but it had no official administrative structure 
beyond the advisory leadership council. Franco’s astute advisor and brother-
in-law, Ramón Serrano Súñer, convinced him that it was time to form a 
proper government.
Franco wanted to retain his unquestioned personal power, but he was 
also savvy enough to realize that any structure had to make room for all 
of the interest groups in the Nationalist camp. The forcible unification 
of the Falange and the Carlists in April 1937 into the single party, 
the Movimiento, was the first step. But the key turning point was the 
establishment of a state apparatus and civilian government.
The decision paralleled a turning point in the military operations, 
following the conquest of the northern industrial corridor and in the 
midst of the Battle of Teruel and as the Nationalists began their next 
decisive offensive. It was clear that the expanding territory under their 
control needed a more regular governing structure. More symbolically, the 
establishment of a state was also a political and diplomatic signal of the 
growing confidence in a Nationalist victory.
In this context, Franco formed the first government of the New State, 
regulated by the Law of Central Administration. The core principle that 
remained unchanged was Franco’s absolute power in his dual role as head 
of state and president of the government. The administration was divided 
into 11 ministries, presided over by the president of the government, who 
appointed the ministers. The head of state occupied the presidency, while 
the combination of president and the council of ministers constituted the 
government. Finally, the ministers had to swear an oath of fealty to the 
head of state and the Nationalist regime.

161
20. How the Nationalists Organized for Victory
The ministry of education was entrusted to the traditionalist Catholics, 
public order and defense was given to military leaders, and industrial 
and agrarian organization to the Falange. Ramón Serrano Súñer took 
the position of minister of the interior, while Franco’s brother Nicolás 
was sidelined, appointed ambassador to Portugal. Most scholars consider 
Serrano Súñer as the main architect of the New State and the man with the 
greatest ideological influence on Franco during these years. He advocated 
for greater fascistization, and he pushed for even closer relations with the 
Nazi and Italian governments.
Establishing New Laws
Among the first important laws passed were the reinstatement of the 
death penalty and the abolition of the Catalan autonomy statute. This was 
followed by the prohibition of the use of Catalan in public documents. The 
government also passed a draconian press censorship law that included 
government appointment of the chief editors of newspapers.
For Catholic traditionalists, the government created a new education 
framework that gave absolute power to the church to design curricula 
for secondary schools and disavowed the secularization measures of the

Republic. For the Falange, Franco approved the Fuero de Trabajo, or 
“Labor Charter,” that the Movimiento leadership drew up in March of 
1938 at the behest of Serrano Súñer. It declared that the economy would be 
organized according to the principles and structures of vertical syndicalism, 
modeled after the Italian fascist labor charter. The Fuero became the first 
of seven fundamental laws that would constitute a kind of constitution for 
the dictatorship.
In December of 1938, the council of ministers took the more radical step 
of staking their claim to the past. With an increasingly clear path to victory 
after the Battle of the Ebro, the council believed it was time to assert 
the legitimacy of the Nationalist regime from the moment of the coup. 
Conversely, the Republic was declared illegitimate from the same moment.
The resulting Law of Political Responsibilities was issued in February of 
1939, on the cusp of the conquest of Catalonia. It effectively outlawed all 
Republican parties and associations and backdated treasonable offenses 
to anyone who had supported the legal Republic since July 1936. It laid 
the institutional framework for a broad scope of postwar repression and 
retribution. In the same spirit, Franco repeatedly rejected all calls for 
mediation in what he continued to frame as a clear-cut battle between 
Spain and its enemies.
Stabilizing Financial Resources
Another, more diffuse interest group that the Nationalist government 
courted was the economic elite, both foreign and domestic. Despite 
the Republic’s efforts to downplay revolutionary expropriations and 
collectivizations, most wealthy property owners and businessmen distrusted 
the Republic. Many had already moved their capital to overseas accounts 
and investments in 1931.
Franco and his advisors worked to convince these businessmen to reinvest 
in the reconstruction of Spanish industry and commerce in the Nationalist 
zone. Using some of the foreign loans secured from Italy and Germany, the 
Burgos council offered loans and easy credit to restart businesses that had 
been collectivized or expropriated in the Republican zone. Bankers and 

163
20. How the Nationalists Organized for Victory
aristocratic families also directly donated to the Nationalist cause or offered 
their wealth and reputations as collateral for more foreign loans. Individual 
companies also agreed to sell goods to the Nationalists, often on credit. 
This was the case with the US petroleum companies, which supplied 75% 
of the Nationalist petroleum products.
Key to the Nationalists’ growing financial stability was the ability of the 
government to convince foreign lenders and markets of the solvency of its 
currency and its commitment to protect private property. Because they 
lacked access to the state gold reserve, credit was indispensable for the 
Nationalists, and credit is built on trust. To build that trust, the Nationalist 
government put its financial policy in the hands of those who defended 
capitalist orthodoxy, which was the language of international finance.
The finance minister was a conservative monarchist named Andrés 
Amado. To stabilize its currency, he advised prohibiting banks from 
trading foreign currency and fixed the peseta at its prewar level. Nationalist 
authorities also paid attention to the amount of money in circulation, 
placing official stamps on circulating banknotes. In the spring of 1937, 
the use of Republican currency in the 
Nationalist zone was outlawed, and 
old bills were withdrawn as new ones 
were issued.
Currency stabilization gave Spaniards 
greater confidence to redeposit their 
money into bank accounts, even 
though interest rates were low. The 
increase in deposits returned large 
profits for the bankers and made 
funds available for financing the 
government. In May of 1938, the 
government began paying out interest 
payments for holders of state bonds, 
which again reinforced the stability 
and solvency of the financial system.
Andrés Amado’s 
continuity as financial 
architect of the 
Nationalist state is an 
underappreciated element 
of its coherence and 
stability. At the end of 
the war, he received the 
grand cross of the Orden 
de Isabela la Católica, 
a prestigious award to 
honor those who rendered 
extraordinary service to 
the nation.

20. How the Nationalists Organized for Victory
164
The Nationalists also increased the state’s income through effective 
taxation. The state created several new taxes, all of which financed an 
estimated 30% of its expenses. The incorporation of the northern industrial 
corridor in late 1937, with its extensive mining and metallurgy businesses, 
significantly expanded the tax base.
Even if business owners had been expropriated during the Republican 
period, they were required to pay back taxes or face stiff fines. In return, 
they received a guarantee of property rights and the promise of an obedient 
and servile labor force after the disbanding of the left-wing trade unions. 
Successful taxation also helped to curb inflation.
Increasing Agricultural and 
Industrial Production
Rural Spain was the core base of the Nationalists, and in general their 
policies favored agricultural producers over urban consumers—the reverse 
of the Republicans. Thus, the government established a good working 
relationship with the peasant farmers. They returned land that had been 
confiscated under the Republic. They ensured that farmers had incentives 
to grow and sell their produce. Instead of imposing price controls as did the 
Republicans, they set price guarantees and sold seeds at reduced prices.
In addition, they paid farmers well for requisitioned goods, a practice that 
limited hoarding and black-market dealing. Wages for farm labor actually 
rose, as farmers faced labor shortages due to conscription and repression. 
The result was an unprecedented full-employment agricultural economy 
that improved everyday life for some of the poorest landless laborers—only, 
of course, if they were not labeled political enemies.
During the last years of the war, the industrial sector also expanded in the 
Nationalist zone. The major turning point was the conquest of the North, 
especially the mining basin of Asturias and the steel and iron industries 
of Vizcaya, which allowed the Nationalists to produce some of their own 
armaments. Under the Nationalists’ strict controls and quotas, steel and 

165
20. How the Nationalists Organized for Victory
iron production and coal extraction doubled. While wages remained low, 
workers were paid regularly and could buy more food with those wages, 
and the number of jobs increased.
Contrasting Experiences
Favorable economic metrics like a stabilized currency and increased 
production don’t tell the whole story of life in the Nationalist zone. The 
major divide that defined who ate and who went hungry was political 
affiliation.
Beyond the thousands who were killed or suffered in concentration 
camps with starvation rations, the wives and children left behind without 
a breadwinner were often left destitute. In an economy and society that 
frowned on female employment, women were refused jobs and reduced to 
begging or the meager rations at soup kitchens, and some mothers gave up 
their children to state care as the only hope for their survival. Others turned 
to prostitution, feeding the higher demand from conscripted soldiers.
In contrast, widows of Nationalist soldiers who died in service were 
awarded pensions. Given the alternatives, it is easy to understand why this 
policy was one of the powerful incentives offered to former Republican 
soldiers if they joined the Nationalist army. Thus, the Nationalist state tried 
to draw a line between those it considered the unsalvageable enemy and the 
rest of the neutral or misled population. The enemy was usually identified 
by membership in a popular front political party or trade union, or the 
holding of a government post. Anyone who did not fall in these categories 
might be won over with stable employment, full bellies, and purchasing 
power for their pesetas.
With this view of the Nationalist organization of the war effort, we now 
have the complete picture of elements that favored a Nationalist victory. 
If Spaniards in the Nationalist zone generally lived better during the war, 
the postwar period inaugurated one of the most difficult decades for 
many Spaniards. The so-called years of hunger were marked by extreme 
repression and devastating poverty and starvation, all happening while the 
world’s eyes were turned elsewhere.

hile the Nationalists continued to 
consolidate and expand, the Republican 
side struggled with both internal divisions 
and an increasingly dire military situation. Addressing 
both of these challenges was the goal of the new 
government that was established in May 1937 under 
a new prime minister: the moderate socialist Juan 
Negrín. In this lecture, we look at Negrín’s strategy 
to achieve a more unified Republican state and 
convince international democratic powers to drop their 
nonintervention stance.

21. How the Republic Organized for the Long War
168
Centralizing the New Government
Prime Minister Negrín’s strategy to address domestic infighting was to 
focus on discipline, unity, and further centralization. As part of this latter 
effort, Negrín’s government tried to rein in the revolutionary forces. After 
being assigned a diminished role in the new government, the revolutionary 
elements of both the CNT and UGT unions left the coalition. Meanwhile, 
the remaining Republican and Communist Parties enjoyed a stronger 
position in Negrín’s new government.
Republicans, communists, and moderate socialists agreed that 
centralization and military discipline were needed to win the war. The 
violence in May 1937 had defeated anarchist autonomy in Barcelona, and 
by the summer, Negrín’s government had dissolved the agrarian collectives 
in Aragon and dismantled the anarchist-dominated regional councils in 
Aragon and Catalonia. By the end of the year, factional infighting had 
mostly been reined in. However, there was growing defeatism among 
soldiers in the Republican camp.

21. How the Republic Organized for the Long War
Within the government, the first crack came in March 1938, when the 
minister of national defense, Indalecio Prieto, announced to the cabinet 
that the war could not be won and that it should be ended as soon as 
possible. President Azaña did not disagree, but he reluctantly concluded 
that there was no other option than continued resistance, given the 
Nationalists’ refusal to negotiate a conditional surrender.
Following Prieto’s resignation, Negrín formed a new but broader cabinet. 
It included both the UGT and the CNT, all of whom were united around 
the policy of resistance. However, in the face of increasing defeatism 
and declining morale, this so-called war government also pursued more 
draconian civilian and military discipline.
Swaying the International Community
Negrín proclaimed his Thirteen Points in April 1938. The points were 
meant to persuade the international community that the Republic was a 
true democracy, not a revolutionary regime. He called for the independence 
of Spain from “foreign forces,” for the establishment of a democratic 
republic (to be approved in a referendum), and for the defense of private 
property.
In addition, he called for an “ample amnesty” for all those who aspired to 
the “reconstruction and greater glory of Spain,” regardless of which side 
they had fought on. The only nonnegotiable issue was the demand for 
amnesty. Negrín feared that a Nationalist victory would, in his own words, 
unleash “a reign of terror and bloody reprisals” against anyone associated 
with the Republican cause.
But the Thirteen Points drew no response from the British or the French. 
And the lack of response from the Nationalists further hardened Negrín’s 
conviction that he had no choice but to fight on and hope for a change 
in the international situation. He made a vain last attempt to win over 
international opinion in February 1939 by reducing the Thirteen Points to 
just three: an independent Spain, a referendum to decide the future regime, 
and “a patriotic labor of reconciliation.”

The Casado Coup
By the fall of 1938, following the failure of the Ebro offensive, the only 
party that still defended a policy of resistance was the Communists. 
The rest of the population and soldiers were war-weary and had come to 
associate the Communist Party with the internal policing forces. These 
sentiments created the context for a fierce anti-communist backlash.
After the fall of Catalonia in February 1939, Britain and France formally 
recognized the Nationalist government, and President Azaña resigned. 
These events were the trigger for the coup against the Negrín government 
by Colonel Segismundo Casado, commander of the Center Army, who 
formed a National Council of Defense in Madrid on March 5, 1939. His 
council included all the parties and trade unions in the capital except 
the communists. Casado claimed that he would be in a better position to 
negotiate with Franco than Negrín. From this logic, Casado’s new council 
proclaimed that it was the legitimate representative of the Republic.
The declaration led to armed confrontation in Madrid between council 
defenders and the communists. Casado’s forces defeated the communists, at 
the cost of 243 lives and nearly 600 injured. Worse still, the coup prevented 
the possibility of a relatively orderly retreat of Republican civilians and 
soldiers to the ports of the Mediterranean. Casado himself escaped into 
exile, where he admitted that he had been wrong about the possibility of 
any negotiated peace with Franco. On March 28, 1939, Nationalist troops 
paraded through Madrid without encountering any resistance.
Spain’s Communist Party
The actual role of the Communist Party in the Republic’s tragic trajectory 
is still unresolved. Hanging over the debate is the question of how much 
the PCE, Spain’s Communist Party, was responsible for its own actions 
or a pawn in Soviet schemes. There are two retrospective versions of the 
communist story in Spain.

171
21. How the Republic Organized for the Long War
One version of the story paints the PCE as a duplicitous, conniving 
force whose ultimate goal was to take over the government. In this view, 
the PCE’s support for the popular front was only a calculated political 
expedient. It was simply the best face they could present to the democratic 
countries in the hopes of gaining their assistance in the war. Once the war 
was over, the story goes, their true face would have been revealed with the 
installation of a totalitarian communist dictatorship.
The other narrative takes the PCE’s commitment to the popular front 
at face value. In this story, the PCE was genuinely dedicated to “popular 
democracy,” as articulated in Negrín’s 13-point program. Further, in this 
interpretation, the Socialist and Republican Parties worked together as part 
of a pluralist democratic state, even if the conditions of wartime forced 
compromise and sacrifice.
In practice, both of these stories oversimplify the case. The Republican side 
was so fragmented that even political groups who shared the same name 
did not always prioritize the same goals or values. At the same time, all of 
the competing visions held among the several parties and factions of the 
Republic shared one conviction in common: the revolutionary sense that 
they were constructing a new society.
The Republican camp was not divided between revolution and democracy. 
Instead, it incorporated an array of different revolutionary visions for 
Spain, some more recognizably democratic than others. For most, the 
liberal democracy of Britain or the United States wasn’t on the table. Nor 
was the orderly social democracy that emerged in Western Europe after 
World War II.
For the left, a victorious Republic may have really been able to bring 
together democracy and socialism in a new experimental form. For the 
right, the only endgame was totalitarian communist dictatorship. It’s 
hard to say whether Spain’s peculiar political world even fits inside the 
Cold War binaries of communism versus democracy that we tend to 
retrospectively apply.

21. How the Republic Organized for the Long War
172
Inadequate Provisioning and Fiscal 
Shortcomings
For most civilians, the ideological debates probably had little relevance. 
Many of them were likely more concerned with providing for their families 
and protecting their homes than with grand political visions. And on this 
basic level, the Republican government was not able to deliver as well as its 
Nationalist counterpart.
Both the Republic’s civilian population and its army suffered the 
consequences of inadequate provisioning. Hunger and privation began 
during the siege of Madrid in the winter of 1936 and spread to the rest 
of the Republican zone over the following months. The dramatic decline 
in Soviet shipments from early 1938 exacerbated their problems but did 
not create them. More fundamental were the complicating factors on 
the ground, from decentralization to local revolutionary projects. These 
realities made it all but impossible to organize a coherent provisioning 
strategy.
Even after the reconstruction of the state, logistics remained in disarray. 
Meanwhile, inflation undercut Republican currency both at home and 
abroad as uncontrolled printing flooded the economy with new notes.
Inflexible agrarian price controls were designed to placate urban 
consumers. But they encouraged hoarding of produce as the value of 
the Republican peseta dropped. Plummeting confidence in Republican 
currency and inadequate provisioning for its population highlighted the 
shortcomings of the Republic’s political economy. The situation wasn’t 
helped by the government’s failure to collect taxes. Without enforcement, 
many in the Republican zone simply refused to pay, which further 
restricted the government’s resources.
Fiscal shortcomings meant that soldiers were often paid late. The budgetary 
shortfall prompted the printing of ever more money, which in turn pushed 
up prices. By the later stages of the war, inflation had skyrocketed to 
1,500%.

21. How the Republic Organized for the Long War
Declining Productivity
The Republic was already at a disadvantage in agriculture, since the 
majority of farmland fell into Nationalist hands almost from the outset. 
The remaining heartland in Aragon had been collectivized under anarchist 
control, subject to both local committees and the Regional Defense 
Council of Aragon. Similarly, the agricultural collectives in Valencia acted 
in a completely autonomous fashion, disregarding both trade union and 
state directives.
As food scarcity worsened, draft animals were slaughtered for meat, but 
the short-term relief only worsened the overall prospects. Without draft 
animals on farm and road, it became increasingly difficult not only to 
produce and transport food but also to supply the front line. By the end of 
the war, the Republic was on the verge of famine. Particularly hard-hit were 
the urban populations.

21. How the Republic Organized for the Long War
174
In Barcelona, political leaders complained that many workers were calling 
in sick but refusing to submit the proper documentation. Instead of going 
to work, they spent their days searching for food, which often involved 
either barter or the black market. Villages fared better because families 
relied on local garden plots, although hungry soldiers passing through took 
what they could find, despite severe punishments for looting.
On the industrial front, the Republic began with a huge advantage, with 
the industrial areas of Asturias, Catalonia, and the Basque Country under 
its control. At first, factories were able to operate with existing inventories, 
but supply chains soon began to break down. In 1937, industrial 
production stood at 60% of the prewar level, but plummeted the following 
year. The lack of raw materials and parts and the growing problem of 
absenteeism on the part of a hungry and resentful workforce all contributed 
to a steep fall in productivity.
In the big picture, it’s difficult to imagine which set of alternate 
circumstances might have paved the way for a Republican victory. But 
the mix of adverse factors that contributed to its defeat make it hard to 
argue that if only one factor had been different, they would have won, as 
in the classic pro-Republican claim that nonintervention was the single 
fatal ingredient. What is indisputable is that the defeat marked a pivotal 
moment in Spanish history whose aftermath is still playing out today.

hen we think of concentration camps, 
we often think of the infamous Nazi and 
Soviet camp systems. While those camps 
operated on an unparalleled scale, they were not 
without precedent. In fact, they were part of a larger 
20th-century trend of using concentration camps for 
civilians. In the Spanish Civil War, both sides opened 
concentration and prisoner-of-war camps, which 
shared the common aim of eventual redemption 
through work. In this lecture, we examine the transition 
from the early explosion of wild killings in the summer 
of 1936 toward judicial process and incarceration.

177
22. Repression on the Two Sides
Transition from Executions 
to Incarceration
After the first few months of the war, executions continued, but there 
was a clear shift on both sides from killing to incarceration. That trend 
would last through the rest of the war and continue in the early postwar 
dictatorship. The symbol and instrument of political incarceration was the 
concentration camp.
There is a distinction between standard prisoner-of-war camps where 
captured soldiers are held under the international rules of warfare and 
concentration camps where inmates are sent due to beliefs, political 
affiliation, or racial identity. The latter were also distinct from the Nazi 
death camps, which were constructed explicitly to exterminate the racial 
“others,” particularly Jews, who could never be rehabilitated. Concentration 
camps, on the other hand, were meant to be temporary, designed for 
reeducation and reentry into society.
The new system of popular justice prosecuted beliefs or identities as 
well as specific crimes. Much as the Nationalists would assign collective 
enemy identity to the working classes, most Republicans identified entire 
social and economic groups as political enemies subject to prosecution. 
These included feudal landowners, military officers, bankers, clergy, and 
in general the wealthy classes, all of whom were often labeled “politico-
fascists.”
Republican Prisons and Camps
The Republic began to regularize its judicial process in October 1936 
with the establishment of a new “emergency jury” system. Sentences of 
up to three years were meted out to people who demonstrated that they 
were opponents of the Republic. Individuals could be convicted for fascist 
beliefs or their lack of support for the Republican cause. Confirming this 
political dimension, the juries included one professional magistrate but two 
members of popular front political parties.

22. Repression on the Two Sides
178
Within this framework, the Republic expanded existing prisons and built 
new ones to accommodate the influx. Religious institutions were converted 
into prisons, while in coastal regions authorities opened prison ships.
Beyond standard prisons, the Republican state created the beginnings of 
a “redemptive” labor camp system. The camp project took shape under 
the leadership of anarchist justice minister Juan García Oliver (November 
1936 to May 1937). It probably had both a pragmatic and principled origin, 
both as a solution to prison overcrowding and as a political program of 
rehabilitation through work.
Prisoners were charged with building at least half a dozen camps 
themselves, the first in April 1937. These camps never employed a laboring 
prisoner population larger than a few thousand, and they were assigned 
to public works construction. The biggest camp, in Alicante, held around 
1,000 prisoners by early 1938 and was dedicated to draining salt marshes to 
create new farmland. While the official policy was redemption, treatment 
often looked more like punishment. Abuses and maltreatment were 
routine, with no formal protections or mechanisms of appeal. Illness, food 
shortages, and exhaustion were also common complaints, although there 
were few deaths.

22. Repression on the Two Sides
A different type of military labor camp expanded in 1938 along the front 
lines. The Military Information Service, or SIM, created these camps to 
directly support the war effort and enforce discipline. Prisoners engaged 
in military auxiliary operations like building trenches and fortifications. 
Most of these prisoners were identified as draft dodgers, deserters, and 
fifth-column saboteurs, so this labor was viewed as both punishment and 
redemption.
The largest network was a series of six Catalan camps, which imprisoned 
between 7,000 and 8,000 inmates, in conditions that ranged from harsh 
discipline to exemplary terror. These camps included International 
Brigadiers who had been caught trying to leave Spain, as well as anarchists 
or dissident Marxists in the small, Catalan-based POUM party, who were 
targeted as disruptive revolutionaries even though they belonged to the 
Republican coalition.
These groups were targeted because the SIM was controlled by the 
Communist Party. It was created in August of 1937 to root out Nationalist 
spies, saboteurs, and collaborators, but also targeted internal enemies, 
particularly the POUM, which was reviled as a rival communist party.
This evidence of internal political terror is among the most-debated 
issues in the Republican repression. Some critics equate it with Soviet-
style chekas—the secret police who terrorized Soviet citizens. Defenders 
argue for the understandable if regrettable need for harsh discipline in a 
deteriorating military situation.
Nationalist Prisons and Camps
On the Nationalist side, repression evolved along similar lines, but the scale 
was much greater. With the establishment of a centralized Junta in October 
1936, the rebels began to set up formal military tribunals and a more 
bureaucratized system of justice.
Prisoners convicted for “blood crimes” were still executed, but others were 
more likely to be sentenced to prison or labor camps. As trials increasingly 
led to incarceration rather than execution, the camps began to grow, and 
territorial conquest only accelerated the expansion.

22. Repression on the Two Sides
180
By all accounts, conditions in the camps were abysmal, with meager rations 
and vengeful guards. Those held captive were not recognized as prisoners 
of war, a status that would have imposed minimal protections from the 
Geneva Convention. Discipline, morality, and work were the key tools to 
purify and “disinfect” a population viewed as damaged by communism and 
atheism.
In contrast to the Republican side, the Nationalists leased prisoners to 
private companies, which benefited enormously from the cheap labor. By 
the time the last camp closed, tens of thousands of prisoners labored either 
for the military, the state, or private companies. They built roads, railroad 
tracks, water canals, port facilities, and, most famously, the Francoist war 
monument, the Valley of the Fallen (Valle de los Caídos).
While forced labor in the camps served a practical purpose, the camps also 
aimed at reeducation, which was synonymous with re-Christianization. 
Attendance at mass was mandatory, and camp chaplains delivered sermons 
urging prisoners to abandon their immoral secular ideas and return to the 
Catholic fold.
Up to this point, Nationalist camps 
mostly held prisoners of war. The 
Law of Political Responsibilities 
in February 1939 expanded their 
scope. As a result of this huge net, 
the 190 Nationalist concentration 
camps expanded to accommodate 
as many as 280,000 Republicans at 
their peak capacity in 1940.
The regime quickly realized that 
prosecuting half the population 
would overwhelm the judicial 
system. As a pragmatic reset, in January of 1940 a new sentencing order 
encouraged reconsideration and reduction of previous sentences, as well as 
the expedited processing of the tens of thousands of pending cases. As a 
result, the era of mass incarceration began to wind down after 1942, when 
all but one camp had been shut down. By 1945, all civil war offenses other 
than “blood crimes” were pardoned.
After the Law of Political 
Responsibilities in 
February 1939, anyone 
who had supported the 
Republican government 
from 1936 could be charged 
(ironically) with “military 
rebellion.” Under this 
definition of “reverse 
justice,” many people were 
incarcerated simply for 
doing their jobs.

181
22. Repression on the Two Sides
There was almost certainly a complex calculus behind the decline of death 
sentences and then incarceration, but the true rationale is still debated. It 
may have been a strategic attempt to win over skeptical Western democratic 
countries, or a practical solution to an overpopulated prison system, or 
some mixture of both. What is certain, however, is that the regime’s 
attitude toward the defeated had not changed. At no point did Franco 
make any effort or gesture at reconciliation.
Repression beyond the War
“Repression” in the Spanish case does not only refer to incarceration and 
execution. After the war, ordinary Spaniards suffered poverty, hunger, and 
often inhumane working conditions. In the immediate postwar era, it is 
estimated that 200,000 people starved to death or succumbed to related 
diseases.
Scholars have uncovered evidence that government policy intentionally 
directed the most severe consequences of the subsistence crisis onto the 
working classes, who were assumed to be “reds.” This was made possible 
by the economic policy of autarky, or self-sufficiency. Closed off from 
international markets in the postwar period, the regime distributed scarce 
resources unevenly among the population. Thus, the policy imposed a kind 
of collective class punishment on the poor.
Meanwhile, the vertical syndicates enforced rigorous social discipline 
on workers, and workers in turn had no path to demand better wages 
or conditions. Legislation left them with little power or agency. In rural 
Altogether, the Nationalists incarcerated more 
than 500,000 people in up to 200 camps. Meanwhile, 
the Republican camps only housed a few thousand 
prisoners, which reflects the smaller scale of 
their repression and their shrinking territorial 
control.

22. Repression on the Two Sides
182
areas, Republican agrarian reforms were reversed. In their absence, landless 
laborers were left exposed to landowners who saw an opportunity to enact 
revenge against those they perceived as revolutionary-class enemies.
While public scenes of religious and nationalist fervor were plentiful, the 
defeated found themselves silenced and marginalized as their place in the 
national story was erased. Alternative national identities were also perceived 
as a threat to the regime, identified as anti-Spanish by the victory coalition. 
Cultural or linguistic expressions of Catalan or Basque identity were 
restricted and prohibited when possible. Repression became a means of 
monopolizing Spanish identity, history, and memory.
In the big picture, how do we situate the mass killing in the civil war 
among the atrocities of the era, from the gulag in the USSR to the 
Holocaust against the Jews? And what is the best terminology to define the 
Spanish case?
Some historians who emphasize the qualitative and quantitative magnitude 
of Nationalist violence have called it a war of extermination, genocide, or 
holocaust. By using those terms, they argue that Nationalist repression 
amounted to an explicit plan of mass murder.
However, the majority of scholars reject the word genocide as either 
imprecise or exaggerated. Some have proposed terms like terror, crimes 
against humanity, war of occupation, or politicide. While these terms are 
more measured, their proponents argue they don’t minimize the level of 
Nationalist repression; rather, they capture it with greater precision.
The level of Nationalist repression can only be understood in the context of 
a civil war: a binary framework in which there is only room for victors and 
vanquished. Reintegrating the defeated—if they were to be reintegrated—
could only be accomplished by transforming them altogether, through 
punishment and reeducation.
More broadly, the expansion of mechanisms to exterminate, punish, and 
marginalize populations beyond the battlefield confirms the progressive 
civilianization of warfare and the disintegrating line between combatants 
and noncombatants that has become a standard feature of contemporary 
wars and their aftermath.

The New Regime 
and the Aftermath 
of the War
T
he Republican government had tried until the 
end to secure a negotiated peace, but Franco 
refused anything other than an unconditional 
surrender. His declaration of victory on April 1, 1939, 
was issued into the void of collapsing Republican 
defenses. However, while this date marked a turning 
point, it was not the shift from war to peace. This 
lecture looks at the war’s aftermath—the blurred 
boundary between war and postwar—which would 
extend up to 1948, defined as a period of intense 
strife, warfare, privation, and the overarching struggle 
to impose a new hegemonic order.

185
23. The New Regime and the Aftermath of the War
Franco Supports the Axis Powers
After three years of devastating violence, the formal conflict ended with 
a whimper on April 1, 1939, when Franco issued a brief message claiming 
victory: “Today, with the capture and disarming of the Red Army, the 
Nationalist troops have achieved their ultimate military objective. The 
war is over.”
In addition to the executions, arrests, exodus, and guerrilla warfare that 
followed, the aftermath of the civil war also remained linked to the broader 
European conflict that broke out in September 1939, only months after the 
Nationalist victory. On October 23, 1940, Franco and Hitler had their first 
and only meeting. They discussed the conditions under which Spain would 
formally join the Axis coalition. Hitler wanted Spain’s help in expelling 
the British from Gibraltar, but in the end he rejected what he viewed 

23. The New Regime and the Aftermath of the War
186
as Franco’s extortionate demands. These included the transfer to Spain 
of British Gibraltar and various French colonial territories in Morocco, 
Algeria, and Cameroon.
While Spain never formally joined the Axis alliance, Franco found the 
opportunity to symbolically repay his debt to the Nazis by authorizing 
recruitment of volunteers to “fight communism” in the Soviet Union when 
the Germans invaded in June of 1941. The idea of punishing the Bolshevik 
state was very popular among the Falange activists, who blamed the Soviet 
Union as the instigator and supporter of the criminal Red Army in Spain’s 
civil war.
The so-called Blue Division finished its recruitment in early July. The 
soldiers were incorporated into the Wehrmacht as the 250th Infantry 
Division, outfitted in German uniforms, and made to swear an oath of 
loyalty to Adolf Hitler. They arrived on the Russian front in October 1941, 
just as winter was setting in and the German advance began to bog down. 
Until their recall three years later, 47,000 soldiers and 146 female nurses 
volunteered and participated in the Russian offensive, including in the 
Battle of Leningrad. The division suffered 5,000 deaths, 10,000 wounded, 
and 400 captured by the Soviets.
Franco Reinvents the Regime’s Image
In general, as the war began to turn against the Axis powers, Franco began 
a broader process of de-fascistization. He renovated his cabinet and shifted 
his rhetoric. Thus, he appointed more traditional Catholic monarchists and 
demoted the role of the Falange. He also foregrounded what would be the 
regime’s dominant ideological framework, so-called National Catholicism, 
which stressed the traditional moral authority of the church as the 
predominant unifying feature of the Spanish nation.
As the regime’s ideology changed, so too did its prominent symbols. 
Franco’s use of the Falange uniform and the fascist salute gradually 
disappeared as he reinvented his external image. They never disappeared 
entirely, but they were gradually pushed off center stage, especially in the 

187
23. The New Regime and the Aftermath of the War
international arena. This broader realignment was also accompanied by 
the gradual winding down of mass trials and incarceration after 1941, 
including waves of pardons.
All of these strategic moves began a lengthy rehabilitation of Spain’s 
international reputation. It would culminate in the early 1950s with 
Spain’s reincorporation into the anti-communist West. This alliance was 
symbolized by the military pact with the US signed on September 23, 1953, 
which exchanged American aid for military bases in Spain.
Before then, the international community, symbolized by the newly created 
United Nations, sought to isolate the Franco regime as an undesired relic 
of the fascist era. The December 1946 resolution was a strongly worded 
rejection of Spain’s inclusion in the international body, approved by 
both the US and the USSR. Based on the report of a UN commission, it 
concluded that the dictatorship was a fascist regime imposed with the help 
of the Axis powers. It further insisted that the Franco regime shared in the 
responsibility for the Second World War, including by sending the Blue 
Division to fight for the Nazis.
Over the next several years, however, the Western powers eventually 
accepted the pragmatic usefulness of the Spanish dictatorship in the Cold 
War (as they accepted other right-wing dictatorships in Latin America 
and elsewhere). This realignment was facilitated by Franco’s successful 
promotion of his image as an anti-communist cold warrior.
Guerrilla Fighters Resist
The aftermath of the civil war was very different for the Republicans. Tens 
of thousands were killed and hundreds of thousands were arrested, while 
half a million fled Spain as refugees—half of them permanently. A small 
percentage, however, stayed on as guerrilla fighters.
The guerrilla resistance officially began after the declaration of Nationalist 
victory, when Republican fighters were no longer defending a legitimate 
government. The first guerrilla units comprised Republican soldiers who 
either feared capture or believed in continuing the struggle. There were 

23. The New Regime and the Aftermath of the War
188
pockets of resistance across the country, but most were located in pro-
Republican communities along the coasts and around Madrid, in addition 
to rural and mountainous terrain where it was easier to hide out.
There was virtually no coordination among these units, which relied on 
local communities for food and logistical support. They carried out small 
sabotage, subversive propaganda, and assassinations and raids, which 
occasionally resulted in the brief “liberation” of an isolated pueblo. Women 
played an important role in the support networks, as evidenced by the 800 
women convicted by the Franco regime for their pro-guerrilla activity in 
the North.
A new phase of guerrilla resistance 
opened at the end of the Second World 
War. This included the return of 
Spanish refugees who had fought as 
Maquis, or French resistance fighters, 
in France.
This second phase was inaugurated 
with Operation Reconquest of Spain, a 
dramatic invasion over the Pyrenees to 
the Val d’Aran in Catalonia by several 
thousand Spanish Maquis in October 
1944. The goal was to spark an 
internal uprising against the Franco regime and force the Allies to extend 
their liberation of Europe to Spain. However, the Franco regime quickly 
gathered an overwhelming force of Civil Guards and Moroccan troops to 
beat back the attackers. In less than 10 days, the Maquis had retreated back 
over the French border.
Nevertheless, the failed invasion sparked a new, more coordinated phase of 
guerrilla activity. The Communist Party, whose groups had been the major 
political force in the anti-fascist resistance across Europe, took the lead in 
organizing and directing the units. The goal was to destabilize and disrupt 
the regime and to demonstrate the strength of anti-fascist resistance to the 
European powers.
Spanish fighters 
adopted the word 
Maquis to describe 
themselves, in an 
effort to maintain 
the links and 
sympathy with 
the larger anti-
fascist struggle.

23. The New Regime and the Aftermath of the War
Hopes for intervention were highest from 1945 to 1947, when the United 
Nations and the Western powers had issued strong condemnations of the 
Franco regime. However, it soon became clear that condemnation was not 
going to be supported by military action as the Cold War divide deepened 
in Europe. Eventually, the Spanish Communist Party admitted defeat and 
renounced its armed struggle against the regime in 1948.
At the same time, the Franco regime 
turned its focus from punishing civil 
war criminals to crushing the guerrilla 
forces, reprising some of the terror tactics 
used in the early months of the civil 
war. Suspected guerrillas were shot on 
the spot, several thousand were arrested 
and given long prison sentences, and 
supporting villagers were threatened. 
Those who could escaped to France or 
went into hiding.
Refugees Flee the Franco Regime
The Spanish refugees were the first wave of what would become a torrent 
of European refugees in and after World War II. The majority escaped 
over land through the Pyrenees to France. Beginning in January of 1939 
with the imminent fall of Catalonia, women, children, and old people 
began fleeing north, over the mountains, in bitter winter weather. The next 
refugees were soldiers after the collapse of the Catalan front. By the end of 
the war, an estimated 500,000 had crossed the border.
A clearly hostile, conservative French government was completely 
unprepared for the influx. The French began to establish temporary 
housing and processing centers in 1938, in schools, old factories, 
warehouses, and granaries. From there, the first five concentration camps 
were set up close to the border but lacked basic infrastructure. People slept 
on the ground and lacked toilet facilities, clean water, or adequate rations, 
which resulted in dysentery, malnutrition, and cholera.
Pockets of guerrilla 
resistance lasted 
until the late 
1940s. When it 
became clear that 
the Allies had 
no plans to oust 
Franco, the movement 
fizzled out.

23. The New Regime and the Aftermath of the War

The French authorities did everything they could to convince the 
“undesirable” internees to return, viewing them as a burden in France’s 
economic crisis as the country was still struggling to recover from the 
Great Depression. By the end of 1939, about half of the initial refugees had 
returned to Spain.
When the Second World War began, the French government declared that 
stateless foreign men under age 48 were required to work for the war effort, 
either for a private employer, in a work brigade building fortifications, or 
as a soldier in the French Foreign Legion. Some 10,000 eventually joined 
the French Resistance as Maquis. Some of these ended up arrested and 
imprisoned in Nazi camps. About 7,000 Spanish refugees were interned 
in Mauthausen, more than half of whom died of disease and starvation. 
Still, some 150,000 Spanish refugees survived to become permanent French 
exiles, with large communities in southern cities like Toulouse.
Other than the Soviet Union, 
which mostly welcomed 
Communist Party members, 
the country which first 
opened its doors was Mexico. 
Its government had been 
sympathetic toward the 
Republic and had provided 
foreign aid during the war. 
Despite Mexico’s generosity, it 
also instituted a selection process 
that weighed politics and class as 
factors in accepting refugees.
The trauma of the civil war’s aftermath was exacerbated by the 
international isolation and the onset of the world war, which turned 
attention away from Spain. As a result, the new regime had carte blanche to 
carry out its repressive measures with little international public outcry.
Beyond this initial period of impunity, the fact that the Franco regime 
never formally embraced reconciliation has led some scholars to make 
the argument that the civil war only ended in 1975 with Franco’s death. 
The Mexican government tried 
to minimize the anarchist 
immigrants and favored 
those who had belonged to 
Republican and Socialist 
Parties. Preference was also 
given to those with education 
and professions, which 
resulted in an extraordinary 
influx of intellectuals 
into Mexico’s cultural and 
academic circles.

23. The New Regime and the Aftermath of the War
Whatever date we choose for the end of the civil war, it’s clear that 
the trauma left by the conflict continues to haunt and divide Spanish 
society today.

The Spanish 
Memory Wars
T
he Spanish Civil War remains a deeply divisive 
topic, with no national consensus as to how it 
fits into the trajectory of Spanish history. In 
fact, one could argue that it is more divisive today than 
it was 20 years ago, with the reigniting of the so-called 
memory wars and the competing narratives of Spain’s 
historical trajectory. In this final lecture, we explore the 
evolution of how the civil war has been memorialized 
and framed since 1939 and what is happening with the 
memory today.

193
24. The Spanish Memory Wars
A One-Sided Commemoration
During the four decades of the Franco regime, a single civil war 
memory and narrative was forcibly imposed. The regime continued 
to publicly recognize and mourn the Nationalist victims of the war 
with commemorative plaques, monuments, street names, and, most 
dramatically, the Valley of the Fallen.
The Republican cause was dismissed, excoriated, vilified, and silenced. 
Republican military veterans were denied pensions and disability, while 
wives and orphans couldn’t collect benefits. Republican families could not 
even investigate the fate of loved ones who had been killed or disappeared. 
Some knew exactly where bodies were buried in mass graves but would 
have risked punishment if they had tried to excavate.
This enforced silence helps explain why the “recovery of memory” would 
become such an important theme in the future. At the same time, the fact 
that many Spaniards had collaborated in the victory coalition meant that a 
recovery of memory would never be a consensual or simple process.
The longevity and evolution of the Franco regime also complicated the 
memory of the war. During its final two decades, the country benefited 
from a wave of economic development and increased standard of living. 
In 1964, the regime celebrated the end of the civil war by proclaiming “25 
years of peace,” highlighting these improvements and taking credit for 
them. The so-called economic miracle increased passive support for the 
Franco regime, which some argued had softened over time.
An Agreement to “Forget”
The end of the dictatorship in 1978 marked a turning point when the 
relentless one-sided commemoration of the civil war finally ended. A few 
families began the process of recovering the bodies of their loved ones 
in local mass graves and requesting formal death certificates. But at the 
national level, the leaders of the political transition made a decision to 
“forget” the divisions of the past in order to create a broad consensus 
around the new democratic regime.

24. The Spanish Memory Wars
194
Thus, they passed an amnesty law in 1977 that exonerated Republican 
political prisoners of the dictatorship but also protected Francoist officials 
from being charged with war crimes. Even with a political transition, there 
were no purges of Francoist officials, no military tribunals, and no truth 
and reconciliation commission.
However, the agreement to “forget” the civil war also meant that the 
memories and experiences of the vanquished remained buried in public 
discourse. The war simply disappeared from national public culture 
altogether. School history textbooks stopped before the Second Republic 
to avoid having to decide on a single narrative. Obviously, the past was not 
really forgotten, and the ghosts remained visible in the Francoist memorial 
landscape, but “burying the hatchet” was the public motto.
Instead, the national government tried to address grievances of individual 
Republicans and their families. Thus, the first Socialist governments in 
the early 1980s passed a series of laws to restore pensions for civilians, 
soldiers, and widows on the Republican side. Some municipal governments 
embarked on a recovery of Republican memory, such as changing street 
names or erecting plaques. Finally, there was a huge outpouring of 
academic scholarship to recover the voices of the Republican side in the 
civil war. However, none of these efforts amounted to a public national 
collective reckoning.
Attempts to Seek Justice
The next turning point came in 1998, when a Spanish judge, Baltasar 
Garzón, decided to charge the Chilean dictator, Augusto Pinochet, for 
the deaths of Spanish citizens who were killed in the 1973 coup, through 
an unprecedented use of universal jurisdiction. Garzón petitioned 
unsuccessfully for Pinochet’s extradition to Spain to stand trial for crimes 
against humanity. Pinochet had been a strong supporter of Franco. People 
in both Spain and Chile were galvanized by Garzón’s act, but some 
Chileans criticized Spain for not having brought its own dictator to justice.

195
24. The Spanish Memory Wars
In 2008, Judge Garzón launched a prosecution of those responsible for 
Nationalist and Francoist crimes committed during the war and postwar. 
The indictment demanded a coordinated government-sponsored campaign 
to locate the bodies of the 130,000 people still unaccounted for and punish 
those responsible. This posthumous indictment of Franco and 34 of his 
associates officially broke with the 1977 amnesty law that had pardoned all 
past crimes.
An ultraconservative group 
sued Garzón, alleging that he 
had committed an abuse of 
power for investigating crimes 
that had already been pardoned. 
He was cleared of this charge 
but was disbarred for 11 years. 
At the same time, Garzón 
continues to be viewed as a hero 
by those pushing for a more 
uncompromising condemnation 
of the victory coalition and the 
regime it created.
Beyond the individual case 
of Garzón, Spain’s two main political parties each defended opposing 
positions, thus politicizing what began to take shape as a memory war. 
The center-right Popular Party argued that the country should not 
open old wounds and risk unleashing dormant hatreds. The center-left 
Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party (PSOE) shifted to the position that it 
was necessary to publicly acknowledge the atrocities and condemn the 
dictatorship. The Socialist Party proposed a bill in 1999 to formally 
condemn the dictatorship for the first time, but the Popular Party 
refused to support it, agreeing in 2002 only to a generic condemnation of 
“totalitarian regimes.”
The Abraham Lincoln 
Brigade Archives, 
a nonprofit human 
rights foundation, 
awarded its first 
annual human rights 
award to Judge 
Garzón in 2011.

24. The Spanish Memory Wars
196
At the grassroots level, citizen groups pressured the Spanish government 
to undertake a series of judicial, cultural, and political measures to finally 
acknowledge the full crimes of Franco’s dictatorship. But they also decided 
to take matters into their own hands, given the inaction of the government, 
particularly in the exhumation of the mass graves.
The Association for the Recuperation of Historical Memory, or ARMH, 
was founded in 2000. The nonprofit organization employs scientists, 
archaeologists, and historians to locate and exhume the remains of 
Republican victims killed during and after the war. Over the following two 
decades, 5,000 volunteers have participated in the excavation of 150 grave 
sites and recovered the bodies of more than 1,400 victims, which were 
returned to their families.
The Law of Historical Memory
The Socialist Party finally responded to the grassroots pressure with 
the Law of Historical Memory, passed in 2007. For the first time, the 
democratic government officially condemned the Franco regime as 
illegitimate and committed the state to rehabilitate its victims.
It authorized the government to finance the “exhumation and reburial” 
of people in mass graves, but only through subsidies to volunteer 
organizations like the ARMH. It also specified that excavations had to 
be initiated at the behest of individual families, for the purpose of private 
mourning, not collective justice or reparations. The law also charged the 
Ministry of Justice with collecting evidence about wartime atrocities but 
decided not to pursue criminal charges. Finally, it also left in place the 
Francoist-era judicial convictions.
On a more symbolic level, the law ordered that all memorial statues and 
plaques “that exalt one of the warring bands” should be eliminated. The 
most problematic of the Francoist civil war monuments was the Valley of 
the Fallen. Since Franco’s death, it had continued to be a pilgrimage site for 
supporters who visited his grave.

197
24. The Spanish Memory Wars
The law called for the “depoliticization” of the monument by forbidding 
any political events that exalted the Nationalist victory in the civil war 
or celebrated Francoism. The site was also a functioning monastery, and 
the law ordered that it should be restricted to religious usage. At the same 
time, it mandated that it should also serve as a place to mourn all civil war 
victims. Debates continue as to how to transform this structure into a truly 
inclusive civil war memorial or museum.
Shifting Memory Politics
At the same time that more voices have clamored for greater recognition 
and memorialization of the Republican side in the civil war, there has also 
been a backlash. There was always a contingent that was reluctant to open 
old wounds. But a new ultraconservative narrative has revived what was 
essentially the Francoist version of the civil war, justifying the uprising as 
a necessary defense against the left-wing chaos of the Republic that was 
heading toward communist totalitarianism. The new ultraconservative 
political party, Vox, claims that the memory laws passed by the socialist 
governments are undemocratic in their effort to impose a single pro-
Republican memory regime.
Another player in this memory battle has been the church. Without directly 
entering into the larger debates, the church has focused on recognizing 
the victims of anticlerical violence through its own religious process of 
beatification. Over the past two decades, several thousand religious martyrs 
have been beatified for having died “defending religion” or due to the 
“hatred of the faith” during the civil war.
One of the most dramatic acts was to petition 
for the exhumation of Franco’s body from the 
Valley of the Fallen, which was finally approved 
by the Supreme Court and carried out in October 
2019. Despite objections, his body was moved to a 
private cemetery in a Madrid suburb where his wife 
was buried.

24. The Spanish Memory Wars
198
On the state level, the official memory politics around the civil war 
continue to shift each time a new government comes into power, 
confirming its polarized politicization. After the 2007 Law of Historical 
Memory passed by the center-left Socialist government, the center 
right Popular Party government that followed, between 2011 and 2018, 
defunded the law and refused to implement some of its elements. So it was 
only when another socialist-led government took power in June 2018 that 
some of its features were implemented and augmented.
In July 2022, the center-left PSOE-led government passed the Law of 
Democratic Memory, which declared the memory of victims as a “right of 
citizenship.” For the first time, it asserted the leadership of the government 
in locating the disappeared and excavating mass graves. All the conservative 
parties again rejected the law as “divisive,” although the official position 
of the PSOE government is to mourn “all victims” rather than to replace 
veneration of one side with the other.
Many of the citizen groups want the government to go further and 
celebrate the Republic as Spain’s democratic heritage. As a result, the 
recognition of Republican victims hasn’t solved the problem of deciding 
what version of the civil war will be represented in textbooks and museums. 
It seems likely that Spaniards will debate these competing memories of the 
civil war for the foreseeable future. As a result, the civil war will continue to 
play a central and contested role in Spaniards’ understanding of who they 
are as a nation and where they are headed in the future.
