ccording to Merriam-Webster’s new
Time Traveler tool (see What’s New
Online, page 7), the first recorded use
of the term ‘binge-watch’ was in 2003, in a
review of a Family Guy box set. Since then,
it’s become synonymous with Netflix, as
millions of us nestle into our sofas to watch

ouTube has made it even easier
to share videos with your
friends by letting you do so
without leaving its mobile apps.
Rather than sharing links via
WhatsApp, Twitter or Facebook,
this new feature lets you choose
one of your contacts to share
a video with directly. It’s simple to
use – you just open a video, press
the Share button and tap the face
of the person you want to send it
to. Once they have approved your
request, you can chat about the
video in both one-to-one and
group conversations.
But that’s not all. YouTube has
also added a dark mode, which
works when you have a video
playing in landscape mode:
double-tap the space above the
Play/Pause button and the screen
will darken to reduce eye strain.
There’s also a better way of
blurring faces when you upload

tap the What’s On Your Mind? box on your Timeline or News
Feed. Select the option 360 Photo and use the on-screen
guidelines while you slowly move in a full circle to create

Android device and the Chrome browser. From that point,
you just open Allo on your phone, tap the Menu button,
select Allo For Web and scan the QR code on your

to navigate, with the menu options on the left and messages
on the right. You can also start an incognito chat if you wish.

Need to Know
8 6 - 19 September 2017
What happened?
The battle against online piracy has
spread to Roku’s TV sticks and boxes,
which has shut down features to avoid
them being used to access illegal
content. Roku streaming sticks are
similar to the Amazon Fire TV Stick
and Google Chromecast: you plug
the device into your television’s HDMI
port to get smart TV functions such as
streaming YouTube and iPlayer. Roku
also makes a dedicated set-top box.
This kind of streaming hardware is
normally used to access free or paid-for
television, but Roku also lets you set
up and watch a private channel that’s
normally used by developers to test a
channel before setting it live for a wider
audience. However, reports suggest
pirates have been using private channels
to share streams of copyrighted material.
In response, Roku has started issuing
pop-up warnings to users of private
channels, which tell them that the
private channel they are trying to access
is a “non-certified channel” and that if
it is found to violate copyright or other
laws, Roku may remove it without
notice. There’s no suggestion that Roku
is tracking users who try to access
private channels to alert the authorities.
Roku’s warning comes as reports
suggest anyone who illegally streamed
the Conor McGregor and Floyd
Mayweather boxing match on 27 August
via a Kodi add-on or another dubious
online source may have unwittingly
stepped into a trap. During the fight, a
series of digits appeared on some dodgy
streams, leading pundits to suggest the
code was a way of tracking streams that
broke copyright of the event. It’s not
certain that this is the case but, if it is,
the technique could be used to find the
person leaking the stream and sharing
it rather than those watching it.
A survey by Finder.com suggested
one in three respondents intended to
find a pirated source to view the match,
given the £20 price to watch the match
legally and the ease of watching dodgy
streams online.
How will it affect you?
It won’t, if you only use Roku to access
paid-for or genuinely free content. The
warning message only applies to private
channels, which are a niche feature
designed to help developers and are
not meant for the general public.
That said, if you’re using private
channels – whether to watch pirated
content or for a legitimate reason – you
may see a warning message. So far, the
warning message seems to be Roku’s
only measure, but it may start blocking
sources in future, particularly those that
are reported as illegal by rights holders.
The implication is that you don’t have
to worry if you use private channels for
legitimate purposes, but if you’ve been
using a dodgy stream to watch via Roku,
the feature may vanish.
Regarding the tracking of boxing-
match streams, it’s hardly surprising that
an expensive, popular event would have
anti-piracy measures in place. If you’re
still seeking illegal streams for your
content, you may well get caught out
by techniques such as this one or others
we’ve never even heard of – rights
holders are rather keen to protect their
products, especially when millions of
people are paying £20 each to watch.
That said, don’t panic: the code may be
targeting leakers rather than watchers,
and could be entirely unrelated to piracy.
What do we think?
Rights holders are methodically shutting
down every piracy loophole. They
probably can’t plug every hole, but
the aim is to make piracy not worth the
trouble for the average viewer. While
there will always be people who indulge
in piracy to prove a point – and if you
paid £20 to watch that particularly
unexciting boxing match, you may
sympathise — the improvement in smart
TVs, the low cost of devices such as
Roku and the wide range of easy ways
to buy and watch shows mean piracy
shouldn’t be your first option. There are
smarter ways to watch what you want
without falling foul of the law. See our
cover feature on page 38 to learn more
about one of the best.

What happened?
A software update has
broken Samsung TVs,
leaving sets bought only
weeks ago showing
nothing but a blank screen.
The fault happened after
Samsung rolled out a
software update on 17
August to specific models
of its smart, web-
connected TVs. A bug
caused a small number of
televisions to stop working
– Samsung has said fewer
than 200 were affected.
The smart TVs aren’t the
only hardware to suffer
software issues. Web-
connected, app-operated
door locks from Lockstate
stopped working after
a software update,
breaking one in 12 of the
locks. And drone maker DJI
said owners of its products
must install a firmware
update as soon as possible
or their flying toys will stop
working, after hackers
found ways to meddle with
safety settings.
How will it affect you?
The software bug has left
some TVs entirely bricked,
unable to turn on, while
others are unable
to change
channel or
volume. If your
TV was one
of the few
affected, call
Samsung on
0330 726 7864
to get help.
The fault is
severe enough
that it’ll
probably
require an
Samsung TVs bricked
by software update
engineer visiting your
home or taking your TV
to a repair shop, because
the software solution
needs to be installed by
an “approved Samsung
engineer”. The fault affects
the MU Series of smart TVs,
in particular the MU6, MU7
and MU8 models.
What do we think?
Web-connected TVs are
certainly handy, but losing
the ability to watch your
favourite shows is likely
to make anyone affected
yearn for simpler times,
when TV sets simply
worked. It doesn’t need
to be this way: Samsung
made an error and needs
to test future updates
before rolling them out.
But as the Lockstate
example shows, Samsung
is not the only company
to trip up. Smart devices
have their benefits, but
it’s worth thinking twice
before connecting
appliances — it’s one thing
to make do without a
television, but not being
able to get into your own
home is more serious, so
think before you connect!
What happened?
Google has unveiled
the eighth edition of its
Android mobile operating
system, dubbed ‘Oreo’.
So what’s new?
One intriguing feature
in Android 8 is support for
picture-in-picture, which
lets you continue to watch
a video while using another
app, such as email.
Notifications will be
organised into channels,
making them easier to
manage, and an Autofill
feature will let password
managers work with
Android to fill in login
details for you.
The Camera app gets
a few tweaks, notably
a simpler way to zoom
and switch between photo
and video modes. Android
Oreo should also extend
your phone’s battery life,
because Google is stopping
certain background tasks
in apps that chew through
your battery. Perhaps most
importantly, there are 60
new emoji.
How will it affect you?
If you have a Google-
branded smartphone, such
as the Nexus 5X or Nexus
6P, you can download
and install Android Oreo
immediately. Other
handsets will receive it
once their mobile operators
have tested it and rolled it
out. If you have a Nexus,
you can install Oreo now
by heading to Google’s
Android Oreo
arrives
with new
features
Android Beta page
(android.com/beta) to
download it. Otherwise,
you can simply wait until
your operator pushes
it out “over the air”.
Of course, not all phones
will get the update, with
older devices likely to be
passed over. OnePlus said
its OnePlus 5, 3 and 3T will
get Oreo — but it will be
the last Android update
for the older two handsets.
What do we think?
Picture-in-picture is a neat
feature, but it’s hardly
enough reason to buy
a new phone. That said,
Google’s continual
upgrades mean those
with the latest software
always get the best battery
life, the most protected
operating system and the
fastest performance.
Hopefully, those on older
phones and less-expensive
models aren’t left off the
upgrade cycle. However,
that’s more down to the
individual operator than
Google. Android 7
(Nougat) is only used
by 13% of users, with
a third still on Android 6
(Marshmallow), which
was released back in 2015.

FIRST LOOK
10 6 - 19 September 2017
Samsung Galaxy Note 8
bit.ly/note431
This time last year, we were singing
the praises of Samsung’s Galaxy Note
7 and were it not for its worldwide
recall – following the emergence of
a potentially dangerous battery flaw
– we’d still be recommending it now.
You can bet that Samsung has fixed
the battery problem in the Galaxy
Note 8, but that’s not the only thing
it’s upgraded.
The phone’s attractive bezel-less
design is cribbed from the Galaxy S8,
allowing the huge 6.3in screen to
dominate the entire front of the
handset. It continues to use Samsung’s
Super AMOLED technology which,
at this scale, looks amazing.
Turn the Note 8 over and another
new feature is revealed: dual
detailed shots, or to create lovely
soft-focus backgrounds.
A less conspicuous but still useful
improvement is that Samsung’s S Pen
stylus – the handy pointing device
which inspires the Note’s name – can
now be used to jot things down even
with the screen off, for the ultimate
in quick note-taking.
There are changes inside the case,
too. The processor has been bumped
up to Samsung’s Exynos 8895 and
memory has been increased from
4GB to 6GB. We’ll need to spend
some time testing the Note 8 before
we can deliver a definitive verdict,
but our first impressions are excellent.
Samsung has taken arguably the best
plus-size smartphone ever and made
it even better. It’s available to pre-
order now for a whopping £869,
so start saving your pennies!
What happened?
Official figures from the Government’s
Public Health England (PHE)
department revealed that a staggering
6.3 million British adults fail to walk
briskly for just 10 minutes a month
(brisk walking is defined as simply
“walking faster than usual, at a pace
that gets your heart pumping”).
In addition to weight loss, regular
brisk walking over time helps to reduce
the risk of diabetes, cancer, heart
disease and stroke, and has also been
found to improve mental health.
To get more people walking, PHE
has teamed up with the University of
Sheffield, Sheffield Hallam University
and the National Centre for Sport and
Exercise Medicine (NCSEM) to launch
the One You physical-activity campaign
and a free app called Active 10 (bit.ly/
active431). Available for Android and
iOS, Active 10 claims be the first app
of its kind to measure how much brisk
walking you do, and how many ‘Active
10s’ – continuous chunks of 10 minutes
– you achieve each day.
The app, which has already been
downloaded by more than 50,000
people, encourages you to walk at least
one Active 10 a day. Using sensors in
the phone, the app measures when you
reach a certain speed (about three miles
per hour) and when you keep going at
that speed for 10 minutes or more.
Government launches app to get Brits walking
How will it affect you?
If you’re worried that you’re not getting
enough exercise, the new Active 10 app
helps you quantify exactly how much
brisk walking you’re doing and gives
you useful tips on how to build more
into your everyday routine. There’s
no pressure to rush into an intensive
and exhausting new exercise regime,
because the app lets you set your own
goals as you build towards the 150
minutes a week of moderate exercise
recommended by the Chief Medical
Officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies.
What do we think?
There are loads of free fitness apps
available but many of them assume that
the user already has a keen interest in
walking, running or cycling. We think
it’s excellent news that Active 10 has
set realistic, achievable goals for the
6.3 million unfit adults who fail to walk
for a brisk 10 minutes every month. If
just walking a little faster can reduce all
manner of health risks, the public should
be encouraged to do so. And once
you’ve been using the app for a while,
you can up your target to an Active 20!
12-megapixel cameras. It’s hardly an
original idea, but it’s a first for Samsung,
and the company has really gone to
town with it, combining an f/1.7 wide-
angle lens with an f/2.4 telephoto
lens with up to 10x optical zoom.
As well as giving you a huge range of
composition options, the two cameras

Pixel3D 3D Printer
bit.ly/pixel3d431 | From £400
A few years ago, 3D printers were touted as the next big
technology must-have, but their high price, bulky build and
variable performance put many home users off. There are
no such qualms with the Pixel3D, which measures just 45 x
42 x 32cm, and prints at a zippy 80 millimetres per second
– double the speed of most 3D printers – to create models of up to 150 x 150 x
150mm. It’s an easy kit to build – although “not for beginners” – with high-quality
plastic parts. The creator hopes to raise £11,900 by 20 September.
Self-driving lorries may conjure
up images of the demonic truck
in Steven Spielberg’s Duel, but
the reality might not be quite
as terrifying. The government
has announced that ‘partially
driverless’ lorries will be on UK
roads before the end of next
year, and that the Transport
Research Laboratory (TRL) is
testing a number of “platoons”.
Reassuringly, humans will
be in control of the steering of
the semi-autonomous vehicles,
which will travel together in
close formation in groups of
three. A human driver will control the
lead vehicle, with acceleration and
braking mirrored by the other lorries
using wireless technology.
Transport minister Paul Maynard said
that because the front vehicle pushes
air out of the way for the others, using
self-driving lorries could lead to more
efficient travel and low emissions. The
AA, however, has raised concerns about
the effectiveness of the system on UK
roads, warning that a convoy could
block road signs for other users.
“We all want to promote fuel
efficiency and reduce congestion, but
we are not yet convinced that lorry
platooning on UK motorways is the way
to go about it,” said the AA’s president,
Edmund King, noting the number of
exits and entries on the UK road system.
“Platooning may work on the miles of

It seems a bit of a stretch to call
the proposed lorries self-driving
when they will be carefully
controlled by humans, even if
only the lead vehicle in a group
of three will have its driver’s
seat occupied. We also share the
AA’s reservations about platoons
of lorries causing more – rather
than fewer – problems on the
UK’s busy roads.

Q
Is using a mix
of letters and
numbers still
the best way to create
a strong password?
Ellen Bartlett, Twitter
A
A decade ago,
a five- or six-
character
password was enough
to beat most hacking
programs, but computers
Screen repairs create
hacking risk
Phone users have been warned that
getting their devices repaired could
leave them vulnerable to being spied
on. Security researchers at the
Ben-Gurion University of the Negev
in Israel discovered that replacement
screens could harbour malware on
a chip integrated with the display.
This could allow hackers to remotely
control a phone
or eavesdrop on
conversations
and messages.
In a YouTube
video, the
researchers
set up a
demonstration of
the vulnerability

Nexus 6P and an
LG G Pad 7.0.
are much faster now and
a six-character password can
be guessed by a brute-force
attack. Your passwords
should therefore contain
at least 12 characters.
Substituting numbers for
letters used to be effective
but the criminals’ software
is on to that trick and
‘Spr1ngst33n’ doesn’t survive
a determined attack any
more. Additionally, ‘1qaz2wsx’
may seem like a pretty tough
password to guess until you
look at your keyboard and
notice the pattern. A random
series of letters and numbers
must be truly random to have
a chance.
It may seem like a good
idea to store your passwords
in plain text in a spreadsheet
or mail them to
yourself, but this leaves
them vulnerable to
ransomware, the
fastest-growing
category of malware,
where criminals hold
your data hostage until
you pay them a ransom.
While they wait for you
to pay, they can scour
your hard drive looking for
anything that resembles
a password list. Once they
find it, the ransom payment
is the least of your problems.
You may have the
strongest password in the
world, but if you share it with
someone who stores it in an
email account protected by
‘qwerty’, it won’t make a bit
of difference. Your passwords
are for your eyes only.
Your best bet is to use
a password manager
protected by strong
encryption. The best ones
generate secure passwords
for you and give you total
protection with two-factor
authentication.

Both were fitted with a screen modified
with a chip that allowed them to access
data on the devices. The modified screen
could snoop on text entered on
a keyboard, direct victims to phishing
websites and install rogue apps, as well
as use the phone’s camera to take
pictures. Other attacks allowed
researchers to control the operating
system of the devices. The modified
screens appear identical to those made
by the phone manufacturers themselves.

Hackers can edit emails in
your inbox
New research has thrown light on an
email exploit that hackers can use to
change the content of a message, even
after it has been delivered to your inbox.
Dubbed Ropemaker by security
company Mimecast, the attack scenario
allows malicious parties to alter what
is displayed in an email, such as editing
text or swapping a
harmless URL with a
link to malware.
The exploit is
based on the idea
that an attacker
sends an HTML
email to the victim,
but uses the CSS code
– normally used to direct
the presentation style of a web page
– to link to a remote file hosted on the
attacker’s server.
In a couple of examples given by
Mimecast, a remote CSS code is first
used to switch a URL address in an
email message, then to send a matrix
of ASCII text that can be selectively
controlled to change what is displayed.
This latter scenario would essentially
allow an attacker to edit the text of an
email, adding or removing sentences
and external links.

UK Parliament
beta.parliament.uk
These are testing times for politicians
and also for Parliament’s website. As MPs
return after their summer break, we’ve
been checking out this beta version of
its imminent relaunch and we like what
we see so far. The design is simple yet
effective – there’s less clutter and info
is easier to access. Clicking MPs displays
a prominent search engine that lets you
enter a postcode to see a breakdown
of contact details and past roles. You
can also click letters to find lords and
constituencies. It’s a big improvement on
the current dated, mobile-unfriendly site.
We’re surprised you can’t vote on the
changes, but you can give your feedback.
VisaDB
visadb.io
If you want a quick holiday getaway,
choosing a country with a visa restriction
is unlikely to get your trip off to a relaxing
start. This site makes things easier by
letting you specify where you’re from

countries require the documentation.
Each result tells you how long you can
stay and whether you can apply for a visa
when you arrive. You can also check the
cost of eating, sleeping and travelling,
and the typical weather conditions.
VisaDB is fast and slick, but be aware that
it’s still in alpha so you should double-
check the information before you go.

BBC Sport

You’ll have to be on the ball to spot the
difference between the old and new BBC
Sport site, but look a little closer and
you’ll see it has a new logo and graphics.
To save some cash, the Beeb has
adopted a fresh font called Reith, which
is named after the BBC’s founder, Lord
Reith. Whether or not it makes the text
easy to read is rather subjective: it
certainly feels more striking but perhaps
too much so. Other than a different
shade of yellow, there’s not much else
to note, but the changes affect both

20 6 - 19 September 2017
C
hoosing between a laptop and a tablet can be tough.
Sometimes you want the convenience of a touchscreen
device that you can control with your fingers, which is great
for browsing the web and answering email. Other times you need
a keyboard and trackpad, so you can do some serious work.
With Windows 10, however, you don’t need to make that
choice. Here, we’ve reviewed four hybrid devices that have
a touchscreen and a removable keyboard, so you can use them
in tablet mode or as a laptop. All four devices are available for
less than £600, and the least expensive costs less than £300.
Lenovo’s Yoga Book is unique, even
among these innovative hybrid
devices. For a start, it doesn’t have
a physical keyboard. Instead, you get
a fancy virtual one with illuminated,
futuristic-looking keys that vibrate when
you tap them, giving you a reassuring (and
much-needed) sense of physical feedback.
This isn’t merely an aesthetic touch,
however, because the Yoga Book can also
turn that virtual keyboard into a full-blown
electromagnetic-resonance (EMR) writing
surface, so at the flick of a switch you can be
drawing pictures or jotting down notes with its
bundled stylus. Simply press the small button
in the top right-hand corner and the illuminated
keys instantly disappear. This makes the Yoga
Book incredibly versatile as an artistic, design
or note-taking tool – and even more so than most
other hybrids. You can even add a magnetic clip
to a standard pen or pencil, then attach an A5
pad and the Yoga Book will digitise anything
you write or draw on it.
The tablet runs Windows 10 perfectly well, as
long as you don’t try to do too many things at
once. Its score of 11 in our benchmark test put it
in third place overall, although it was only one
point behind the second-place Asus Transformer
Mini. The screen is adequate but not brilliant,
producing just 81.2% of Microsoft’s standard
sRGB colours. It’s battery life is good for
the price, though, lasting seven hours and
22 minutes in our video-playback test.
There are two options available: the Windows
version we’ve reviewed here, and an Android
version, which currently costs around £150 less
from Amazon (bit.ly/lena431). If you’re thinking
more in terms of a tablet you can use as a laptop,
rather than laptop you can use as a tablet, this
alternative version is well worth considering.
Tablet-laptop hybrids
for less than £600
Do you want a Windows 10 laptop or a Windows 10 tablet? With
these versatile hybrids, you can have both at the same time!
HOW WE TESTED
Despite a couple of minor
problems, the Yoga Book
is an exceptional
note-taking device that
does an excellent job of
bridging the gap between
laptop, tablet and paper
notebook. Lenovo should
be applauded for pushing
the boundaries because
the Yoga Book feels
like a genuine step
forward, with its virtual
keyboard and fantastic
writing surface. The
Windows 10 version isn’t
cheap, though, so if you
want to save money and
don’t mind losing
Windows compatibility,
the £400 Android version
also comes highly
recommended.

We put each of the devices through its paces using our
4K Windows benchmarking tools. This gave us an
overall score based on a series of tests including office
tasks, image editing and video encoding. We also
tested the quality of the screens using a colorimeter,
and the battery life by charging each laptop completely
and timing how long it could play a looping video.

Hybrid tablet-laptops Group Test
6 - 19 September 2017 21
Discuss this review at forum.webuser.co.uk
The cheapest hybrid in our test
by some margin is the Venturer
PrimePro. It’s not the chunkiest
device we tested, either, despite
its 12in screen, and the soft-touch
surface on the keyboard has a nice
feel to it. However, it feels mushy
to type on and the trackpad isn’t
particularly responsive.
With its tiny quad-core Intel Atom x5-Z8300 processor
and 4GB of memory, it couldn’t handle our 4K Windows
benchmark test, making it by far the weakest performer in
our Group Test. We also tested it with our less-demanding
1080p version of the benchmark, but it didn’t exactly blaze
through that, either. To make matters worse, despite these
low-power components, the battery lasted just five hours
and 23 minutes in our test.
On the plus side, it has plenty of ports, including a microSD
card slot, full-size USB 3 port, Mini HDMI and a standard audio
jack. There’s also a micro USB port for charging.
Huawei’s MateBook is the slimmest and
lightest device we reviewed, despite
having one of the largest screens. Its thin
chassis has one disadvantage, though,
which is that it can only
accommodate a single USB
Type-C socket. This means
you can’t have any peripherals
connected while charging the device.
The 12in, 2,160 x 1,440 pixels resolution display is stunning,
reproducing 98.4% of the colours in Microsoft’s sRGB
standard. It’s bright enough for most purposes, although
it loses some detail when displaying darker images.
The big problem is its battery, which lasted just six hours
in our video-playback test. You wouldn’t want to leave the
house without the charger because it’s unlikely to provide
a full day’s use before running out of power. This is probably
due to its powerful components, which aced our Windows
benchmark test with an impressive score of 26.
Despite its name, the Asus Transformer Mini
is the thickest of the hybrid devices in our
Group Test, although its 10.1in screen
makes it lighter than the larger but
slimmer Venturer (below). The
extra thickness provides plenty
of room for ports, including USB
3, Micro USB for charging, a Mini
HDMI port, a headphone jack and a microSD
memory-card slot.
The keyboard-equipped cover has a fabric finish that stops
it sliding around while you’re working. This turns the device
into a functional laptop. It’s not great to type on, though,
and the trackpad sometimes had trouble working out whether
we were left- or right-clicking.
The screen’s resolution is just 1,280 x 800 pixels and it’s
quality could be better, but it’s nice and bright. The device’s
overall benchmark score of 12 is marginally better than the
Lenovo’s, too, as is its battery life of 11 hour and 19 minutes.

The PrimePro is cheap for a device with a 12in screen. It’s also the least powerful
device in our test, but if you have only £300 to spend on a Windows 10 hybrid
tablet/laptop, you have to accept some compromises.
The MateBook has seen a number of price drops since its launch last year,
bringing it down to its current level. This makes it a bargain, especially as the
detachable keyboard is included in the price.
The Transformer Mini offers similar Windows performance to the Lenovo Yoga
Book for £150 less, which is a great achievement. However, the keyboard and
trackpad leave a lot to be desired and the low-resolution screen is disappointing.

Group Test Hybrid tablet-laptops
OUR VERDICT
Lenovo’s Yoga Book is more than just a hybrid
laptop and tablet – it’s practically a new category of
device in its own right, with its separate pen-based
interface that takes it beyond the usual combination
of keyboard and touchscreen. That’s enough to win
it our Gold Award, although it’s worth noting that
the Yoga Book also costs the most and doesn’t have
the best performance of the devices we tested.
The performance accolade goes to the
Silver Award-winning Huawei MateBook,
which has more powerful components and
has benefitted from significant discounting
since its launch. It’s a classy, well-designed
product, and only its battery life lets it down.
If a long battery life is your priority, consider the
Asus Transformer Mini, which lasted over 11 hours
in our tests and wins our Bronze Award.
It performed similarly well to the Yoga Book in our
benchmarks but is significantly cheaper, although
its screen and keyboard are less sophisticated.

It can be difficult to calculate what time it is in
another part of the world – you might know
there’s a five-hour difference between New York
and London, but which city is ahead and which
is behind? Although it’s easy enough to look up
world times on the web, TimeZonesView from
the prolific software developer Nirsoft provides
a simpler solution. Using your system’s built-in
clock, it provides a list of all time zones across
the world. Your current location is marked in
green, so you see it at a glance, and the
program provides time-zone data including
name, description, the current date and time,
and daylight-saving (summer time) start and
end dates.
Regard3D is an open-source tool that
converts multiple images of any item into
a 3D model. To use the software, you first
need to take lots of pictures of the target
object from different angles. Make sure you
photograph all of the object to avoid any
gaps in the completed model. The more
images you capture the better. The camera
you use will need to be recognised by
Regard3D’s database (most devices should
be) and the higher the resolution, the better
the 3D model. You can then create a new
project in the program, add your images
and click the buttons to put it all together.
The default settings should all be fine.

one-click

It’s not the most sophisticated tool –
there are no buttons for working out

performing trigonometry – and you

Chrome provides access to a host of custom search engines, and
you can search many popular sites directly from the browser’s
address bar by typing in their keywords followed by your search
query. One of the most useful options is to look up any location
instantly by typing maps.google.co.uk followed by the place
name or postcode. You can make this even easier by shortening
the search engine’s keyword to map. Click the three-dot button
in the top-right corner of the browser and select Settings, then
scroll down to the ‘Search engine’ section and click ‘Manage
search engines’. Find the Google Maps entry in the ‘Other
search engines’ list, click the three-dot button next to it and
choose Edit. Enter map as the keyword and click Save.
While you’re there, you can add a shortcut for directions
from your home address, for example, to anywhere else. Click
the Add button, then type a name for the shortcut, such as
Directions, and a keyword to trigger it. In the URL field, paste
the web address of your home – you can get this by clicking the
Share button when viewing your home in Google Maps and
copying the URL. Click Save, and when you next enter the
directions keyword, Google Maps will open with your home
selected so you can quickly get the information you need.
Reveal the passwords
behind asterisks
Hiding passwords behind asterisks
stops nosy parkers seeing what
you’re typing, but it can also prove
frustrating when you mistype a
character and you’re told you’ve
entered an incorrect login. If you
make too many mistakes, you may
even be locked out of your account.
You can avoid this problem by
installing Unmask Password (bit.ly/
password431), which removes the
asterisks from password fields so
you can see exactly what you’re
typing. Just click the eye symbol to
reveal the characters, then click it
again to hide them. Obviously, you
shouldn’t use it if there are people
around you who can’t be trusted,
but it makes logging in a little easier.

New Tab (bit.ly/photos431) brings your
favourite memories to your New Tab
page by presenting random pictures
from your Google Photos account. You
can tell it which albums to use (so you
can stop potentially embarrassing
content popping up unexpectedly)
by clicking Configure and selecting the
appropriate albums from the list.
Naturally, you need to give the
extension access to your Google
Photos account for this to work,
but your photos are downloaded

privacy won’t be compromised.

Try Firefox’s new
screenshot tool
Last issue, when we were summarising the best new
features in Firefox 55, we lamented the
fact that we hadn’t yet seen the
promised Screenshots tool, which is
being rolled out to users gradually. Since
then, we’ve discovered a way to activate
the function whether Mozilla likes it or
not – assuming you can’t see it already.
Type about:config into your address
bar, press Enter and agree to the
warning. Then search for ‘extensions.screenshots’ and ensure that both of the
matching preferences are set to ‘false’. If they’re not, double-click them to change
their values. Once you’ve done that, the Screenshots button, which looks like
a pair of scissors cutting out a shape, will appear on your toolbar.
To capture a screenshot, click the button and click or drag on the page to
select the desired area. Click Save to copy the screenshot to your clipboard
or Download to save it to your hard drive. Grabs are saved to the Firefox
Screenshots site (screenshots.firefox.com) automatically. You can set them
to disappear after a specific length of time or delete them manually.
Sit up straight and stay

We often recommend add-ons that help
to protect your eyes by reminding you
to take regular vision breaks, but what
about your poor old back? To ensure
that bad posture doesn’t put a strain on
your spine during long web sessions,
you should install a new add-on called
Healthy Back
(bit.ly/back431),

assistant who
reminds you to
sit up straight”.
You can decide
how often you
want it to notify
(or nag) you – the default is every
20 minutes – or switch the extension
off if you feel like slumping in your chair
without admonition.

you might open a video on
YouTube that you don’t want to

more of a hindrance than a help.

Open Edge links in
private mode
When you’re shopping
for a surprise birthday present
or engaging in other furtive
activities, your browser’s private
mode is a good way to stop your
PC storing every detail. Chrome
and Firefox give you the useful
option of right-clicking a link to
open it in a private/incognito
window, but in Edge you have to
open the private window first,
then copy and
paste the
confidential link
into its address
bar, which is a bit
of hassle. Now,
a new Edge
extension called
OpenInPrivate (bit.ly/open431)
solves this problem by letting
you right-click a link and choose
‘Open as InPrivate’ so no one will
know you visited that page.
OTHER BROWSERS
This fortnight’s most useful tips and add-ons to help you get the

minutes to once an hour. That way,
you’ll hopefully stay hydrated and
at least be a little bit healthier.
Double-tap links to open
new tabs
We’re so used to right-clicking the
mouse to open a context menu that
when we use a device that doesn’t
offer this functionality, such as
a touchscreen tablet or laptop
trackpad, it can feel like losing
a finger (albeit it without the blood
and pain). Tap To Tab (bit.ly/tapto431)
addresses this problem by letting you
perform one of the most common
right-click actions – opening a link in
a new tab – simply by double-tapping
on the pad or screen. It’s a simple idea
but it works very well.

NEW
App of the Fortnight
PRIVACY
Kaspersky Secure Connection
bit.ly/kaspersky431
4.1
Browse and
message without
a trace on your
phone and tablet, using this
efficient new VPN (virtual
private network) app from
antivirus expert Kaspersky.
Kaspersky Secure
Connection redirects all
your data through a virtual
server to prevent any sites
or apps from tracking you.
It spoofs your location
and encrypts all your
activity, making it
impossible for hackers
and snoopers to intercept
your data or detect where you really are.
Once you’ve set it up (see our Mini Workshop, right), the
app could hardly be easier to use. It takes one tap to enable
the secure connection, then another to turn it off. You can
even set up rules that tell the app to switch to a virtual
server automatically when you use certain apps, websites
and groups, such as banking tools. It can also be set to
swing into action automatically whenever you’re on
unsecured Wi-Fi. It’s fast, too – our internet had a noticeable
speed boost while the secure connection was switched on.
So what’s the catch? Well, it demands some alarmingly
heavy-handed permissions, such as ‘make and manage
phone calls’ and ‘access your contacts’, although Kaspersky
says it will “reconsider” these in a future update. Then
there’s the paywall: the free app
won’t let you choose a spoof
location (such as the US, for
accessing US-only online
content), but chooses one
automatically (usually Germany,
in our experience). If you want
to be able to choose, you’ll
have to cough up £3.99 per
month for a subscription.
The free version also limits
the amount of data you can
tunnel through the VPN every
day but at 200MB, the limit
is generous and
you get a handy
real-time tally of
the data
you’re using.

It’s been described
as HD TV for the
ears but will you
be able to hear
the difference?
David Crookes
explains all
Hi-res audio
What is high-resolution audio?
The term high-resolution audio – or hi-res
audio, for short – refers to music files that
have a higher sampling frequency and
‘bit depth’ than the standard used by CD.
This ensures that the music you hear is
closer in quality to the original studio
recordings, and audiophiles argue that
it brings greater texture, dynamics and
detail to your favourite tunes.
How does it make a difference?
As a rule, the greater the number of bits
and the higher the sample rate, the
better the sound quality. Hi-res audio
files are 24-bit and typically use a
sampling frequency of 96kHz or 192kHz.
They also have a bitrate of 9,216 kilobits
per second (Kbps), which refers to the
amount of data that’s transferred
every second. What’s more,
hi-res audio is a lossless
format, so the sound it
produces is as pure as you
could ever hope to get.
Is it better than MP3?
Goodness, yes. MP3 is a lossy
compression format, which means
chunks of seemingly superfluous data are
discarded during the encoding process.
This sacrifices some audio quality
because it removes a good portion
of a music track’s subtleties. You only
have to compare the bitrates of MP3
and hi-res audio files to see how stark
this difference is. MP3 files have bitrates
that typically range from 96Kbps to
320Kbps. Hi-res audio, as we’ve said,
has a whopping 9,216Kbps.
Why have we stuck with MP3
for so long, then?
Purely for convenience. MP3 files are
small compared with their CD and hi-res
audio equivalents, which made them
ideal when portable music players didn’t
have much storage space and internet
speeds were sluggish. People simply
wanted to fit as many MP3 files as
they could on their devices and not
spend ages downloading them. As a
compromise, we simply put up with
listening to lower-quality sound.
So what’s changed?
Fast broadband has sparked
a demand for quality once
again, and many music lovers
no longer accept that MP3s
retain everything the human
ear can hear while discarding
the rest. We want to
enjoy CD-quality
sound and beyond
while retaining
portability.
Thankfully, hi-res
audio lets us have
our cake and eat it.
But weren’t we told that CD is
as good as it gets?
Yes, and many people still argue that the
sound from CD is the best you can hear.
To get technical again, CDs transfer data
at 1,411Kbps and use a sampling rate of
44.1kHz with 16-bit depth. This sampling
rate dates
back to its use
by Sony in
1979, and it
was selected
following a
debate among
manufacturers,
including
Philips. They
came to the
conclusion
that there was no point in going beyond
this quality, because we wouldn’t be
able to hear the frequencies and
dynamics reproduced.
What should we be able to hear?
Audiophiles say that if your ears are
sensitive enough, you should be able

WHICH FILE FORMATS SUPPORT HI-RES AUDIO?
6 - 19 September 2017 37
Hi-res audio
Discuss hi-res audio at forum.webuser.co.uk
to pick up on the subtle details of music
delivered in hi-res. They say it’s akin to
listening live and that they can discover
nuances they never knew existed.
Mastering engineers say they can include
greater dynamics and a wider frequency
range, which really brings music to life.
How do I listen to hi-res audio?
There are several online stores that sell
hi-res audio downloads. One of the best
is 7digital (www.7digital.com), which has
a section labelled Hi-Res/FLAC that’s full
of music at reasonable prices. You can
also visit HDtracks (hdtracks.co.uk), iTrax
(www.itrax.com), Bleep (www.bleep.com)
and Bandcamp (www.bandcamp.com).
The latter is particularly good for
discovering new music.
Downloads? Aren’t we all
streaming these days?
That’s true. Revenue from streaming now
exceeds that of downloads, and more
than 112 million of us subscribe to
services such as Spotify, Apple Music and
Deezer. However, Spotify only streams
MP3 music at 320Kbps, while Apple
streams its AAC compressed file format
at 256Kbps.
So where can I stream hi-res
audio?
Qobuz (www.qobuz.com) offers
hi-res-audio to its Sublime subscribers
in 24-bit/192kHz, while Tidal (www.tidal
.com) delivers up to 24-bit/192kHz
recordings as part of its Masters service.
The latter uses MQA files, which can
squeeze hi-res audio down to the size
of MP3, but it costs £20 per month.
Can I listen on my phone?
Some smartphones can handle tunes at
24-bit/192kHz quality, including the Sony
Xperia Z5, the Samsung Galaxy S7 and
even the iPhone 7 (although you’ll need
to download an iOS app such as Onkyo
HF Player or VLC for Mobile for iOS).
Don’t skimp on the speakers or
headphones if you want the best quality
from any setup, either. Sony makes an
extensive range of hi-res audio products,
which you can see at bit.ly/sonyhires431.
Won’t hi-res audio
encourage stream-ripping?
It’s possible. Stream ripping is a form of
music piracy that involves converting
songs from services such as YouTube,
Spotify and Apple Music into files that
can be saved to phones and computers.
Having top-quality music on tap could
encourage a rise in such infringement,
especially given that Qobuz’s Sublime+
subscription – which costs £349.99
a year for unlimited streaming – still
makes you buy downloads.
That’s the computer age for
you, isn’t it?
Funny you should say that. Neil Young,
who once recorded a song called
‘Computer Age’, is involved in hi-res
audio. He started the ball rolling in 2014
with PonoMusic (www.ponomusic.com),
which aims to provide “an end-to-end
ecosystem for music lovers” or, in other
words, specialist music players and hi-res
recordings that allow people to hear their
tunes in the best possible quality. He
recently announced a new service called
Xstream that will play songs at the
highest quality your network will allow.

Codec is popular
with audiophiles
because it

Many products now carry the Hi-Res Audio logo, even though
there’s no agreed standard for the format yet. That hasn’t
stopped record labels coming up with a formal definition,
however, which describes hi-res audio as “lossless audio that
is capable of reproducing the full range of sound from
recordings that have been mastered from better than CD-
quality music sources”. These are the most typical formats.
Tidal is pricey but offers superior quality to
other music-streaming services

UNCOVER HIDDEN CONTENT
Discover what’s been added
(and removed)
New shows and films are added to
Netflix on a regular basis, but with so
much content to browse, it can be hard
to keep up with the latest additions –
especially because many titles don’t
appear on the homepage. Similarly, the
streaming service periodically removes
content to keep things fresh, so you may
wonder why you can’t find something
you previously intended to watch.
To make things easier, bookmark the
excellent website New on Netflix UK
(uk.newonnetflix.info), which provides
an unofficial guide to everything that’s
available to watch on Netflix, and is
updated daily. You can view the latest
additions, removals and expiry dates,
and browse the entire Netflix catalogue.
This exhaustive list can be filtered by
name, year, rating and genre, or you can
search by title, actor or director.
Request specific TV shows and
films
There’s always something interesting
and entertaining to watch on Netflix,
but it’s disappointing when you can’t
find a particular film or TV show. To
remedy this, the streaming service lets
you submit a request for anything you’d
like to watch but which is currently
unavailable. Just go to the Title Request
page (bit.ly/title431) and enter up to
three suggestions.
There’s no guarantee that the titles
you’re looking for will make their way to
Netflix – there could be licensing issues
or your taste may just be too niche or
terrible to accommodate! – but if
enough people ask for the same thing,
Netflix will definitely sit up and take
notice, so it can’t hurt to register your
interest. Bear in mind, though, that the
streaming service sees itself more as
a curator of content than a library of
every film and TV show that’s ever been
made, as this YouTube video explains:
bit.ly/content431.
Unlock secret sub-genres using
codes
One of the easiest ways to browse
Netflix content is by genre. For example,
if you’re looking for excitement, you
might choose the Action category, then
drill down to specific sub-genres such
as Action Comedies, Spy Action &
Adventure, Westerns and so on. What
you may not realise, though, is that
Netflix provides many more less
accessible sub-genres, each with
a unique code, to fine-tune your search.
If you know the right code, you can see,
for example, which ‘steamy romantic’
movies are available to watch right now,
or explore the full selection of deep-sea
horror films.
All you need to do is type www
.netflix.com/browse/genre and add the
relevant code to the end of the URL.

choosing a category, narrowing results
based on a particular rating range and/
or specifying the director’s name,
actor’s name or keyword. Keep spinning

Some phones have limited internal

you can download your Netflix content

straightforward: just opt to download
something and you’ll be prompted to

When you join Netflix, you’re guided

These personalised profiles prevent
young viewers from being exposed to

Download Netflix content to
watch offline
Netflix is a streaming service, which
means it requires an internet connection
to deliver its content. However, if you’re
travelling or stuck in the wilds –
Peterborough, say – you can still enjoy
your favourite TV shows and films by
downloading them in advance to watch
offline. To use this relatively new
feature, you need to have the Netflix
app installed on an iPhone or iPad,
Android phone or tablet, or Windows 10
PC or tablet running the Anniversary

something, select the title you want to

its description page. You can choose the

stay within your data and storage limits.

Pause and resume your Netflix

Netflix is a subscription service, which
means you have to pay from £5.99
every month to keep viewing its
content. However, if you need to take
a break from Netflix – perhaps you’re
going to be away travelling, for example
– it’s easy to cancel your account and
then restart it when you’re ready. Netflix
stores your viewing activity for
10 months after you close your account,
so when you restart your subscription
you can pick up from exactly where you
left off, rather than having to create
a new account. To pause your
membership, just go to the Account
page at bit.ly/youraccount431 and click
the Cancel Membership button. When
you next visit Netflix, you’ll be asked if
you want to restart your membership.
Wipe your Netflix viewing history
If you’d rather not let the people you
share Netflix with find out you secretly
watch Adam Sandler movies when
they’re not around, or you don’t want
recommendations based on that one
episode of Pretty Little Liars you
watched out of curiosity, you’ll be
delighted to hear that Netflix lets you
review your viewing history and delete
anything unwanted from it. Just go to
the My Activity page at bit.ly/activity431
and click the X next to an item to
remove it. You can also check the
viewing history of other family members
in this way – you just need to log into
their profiles first.
Skip the credits when binge-
watching
When ploughing through episodes of
the latest hit series, it’s a pain to have to
repeatedly sit through the opening and
end credits – unless you’re using this
time to go to the toilet, fetch snacks or
make a drink. Netflix will identify when
you’ve watched several episodes of a
show and take you from the end of one
straight to the beginning of the next,
but with the option to view the credits if
you wish. It also gives you the chance to
skip the titles at the beginning. Once
they start, you’ll see a Skip Intro button
appear on screen. You can select this to
jump ahead to the action but do bear in
mind that a lot of people worked very
hard to create the show you’re binge-
watching, so you owe it to them to sit
through the credits at least once!
Test your Netflix streaming speed
You don’t need a blisteringly fast
internet connection to stream video on
Netflix. Modern compression techniques
mean that even a moderate connection
should be able to handle UHD 4K
streaming with ease. If you do
encounter problems, however, and
stopping large downloads and other
bandwidth-hogging activities doesn’t
improve matters, it may be worth
checking the speed of your connection.
Netflix has its own tool called Fast
(fast.com) for this very task. Go to the
site and it will immediately check the
speed of your connection - you don’t
need to select any servers or press any
buttons, and you can rerun the test at
any time. Fast is really only about
checking your connection’s suitability
for streaming Netflix content so unlike
similar services, it doesn’t measure
upload speed, ping, latency or jitter.

Watch Netflix with friends
It’s often a lot more fun watching movies
with friends than on your own, but it
isn’t always possible – especially if they
live some distance away. Showgoers
(showgoers.tv) is a Chrome extension
that lets you watch Netflix with people
you know, and chat with them in
real-time while the film or programme is
playing. Assuming all participants have
a valid
Netflix
account
and have
installed the
add-on,
all you need
to do is
navigate to
the show
or movie
you want
to watch,
hover over
the Showgoers logo and click Start
Watching Party. This generates a unique
viewing URL that you can share with
your friends for simultaneous viewing.
Control how much data Netflix
uses
Streaming or downloading TV shows or
movies on Netflix consumes about 1GB
of data per hour for standard-definition
video, and up to 3GB per hour for HD
video. That can quickly add up,
especially if you’re binge-watching one
or more series. If you have a capped
broadband account or are using mobile
data instead of Wi-Fi, you can easily run
into problems. Fortunately, Netflix
offers some ways of controlling how
much data the service consumes.
Open Netflix in your browser, go to
your account page (bit.ly/
youraccount431), select Playback
Settings and change the quality. Low
reduces the amount of data used to
300MB an hour.
On your phone, you can adjust your
mobile-data usage. In the Netflix app,
tap the three-line menu button and
scroll down to App Settings. Select it,
then tap Mobile Data Usage. There are
six settings available – Off (you can only
stream when on Wi-Fi), Auto (Netflix
will try to balance quality and data
usage), Low (four hours of viewing per
GB), Medium (two hours of viewing per
GB), High (one hour of viewing per GB)
and Unlimited (high quality all the time
– at a rate of around 1GB per 20 minutes
of viewing).
Improve your streaming quality
If you want better quality video, be
prepared to pay for it. Viewers on the
Basic plan (£5.99 a month) can only
view content in standard definition,
while Standard-plan subscribers
(£7.49 a month) can enjoy HD. Premium
members (£8.99 a month) get the
red-carpet treatment and have access to
4K Ultra HD content. Netflix has made
switching plans very easy – just go to
bit.ly/plan431 and pick a new option.
By default, Netflix will serve up videos
in the best quality possible for your
plan, but if your internet speed drops
below a certain threshold, then
playback may suffer. To fix this, go to
bit.ly/hd431 and change the playback
settings as required.
Add useful new features to Netflix
If you watch Netflix through Chrome,
you can change various settings and
unlock new features by installing the
Super Netflix add-on (bit.ly/supern431).
This offers several useful tools, including
the ability to change the video quality,
upload custom subtitles and control the
volume. You can also set your own
video bitrate (the higher the better for
improved quality) and blur episode
thumbnails so they don’t accidentally
reveal any spoilers.
The add-on’s developer offers users
the opportunity to test new beta
features before they are ready to be
rolled out to everyone.
Improve Netflix by tweaking
its interface
Flix Plus (bit.ly/flix431) is a Chrome
add-on from Lifehacker that offers
18 handy tweaks for Netflix. It can add
or remove elements from the interface,
insert a random episode button, provide

Netflix, but we’ve found it works fine in
the UK edition too.

Prevent Netflix from playing the
next episode
Netflix has a feature called Post-Play
that automatically plays the next
episode of a show when you finish
watching the current one. This is a
useful tool when you want to ‘binge
watch’ a series because it saves you
having to return to the main menu to
manually select the following episode.
However, in some circumstances,
Post-Play is more of a hindrance than
a help – perhaps you’re deliberately
viewing a show out of sequence, or
you’ve got an early start the next day
and should go to bed!
To turn off this feature on the Netflix
website, click your name in the top-right
corner, select Your Account and click
‘Playback settings’. Under Preferences,
deselect the option ‘Play next episode
automatically’ and click Save. This
setting will also be applied when you

House of Cards
This American political drama, adapted from the
BBC’s 1990s mini-series of the same name, is the
show that really put Netflix on the map and
paved the way for the many Netflix originals that
followed. Now in its fifth season, the drama
follows the story of Democrat Congressman
Frank Underwood, played by Kevin Spacey.
Shooter
Shooter is a classy action thriller about a retired
Marine Corps sniper who returns to action in a
bid to foil an assassination plot targeting the
president. Things go wrong and he finds himself
framed for murder. It’s based on the 2007 Mark
Wahlberg movie of the same name. The second
season has just been released.
Ozark
Starring (and directed by) Jason Bateman, this
thrilling 10-part crime drama is about a Chicago-
based financial advisor/money launderer who is
forced to relocate his family to the remote
Missouri Ozarks when his arrangement with
a Mexican drug cartel goes badly wrong. It’s just
been renewed for a second season.
Black Mirror
Charlie Brooker’s anthology TV series debuted
on Channel 4, before being picked up by Netflix
in 2015. The show is a series of standalone
episodes (so it’s not something you need to
binge watch) with a common theme – a dark
twist on modern society, and technology in
particular. It’s been described as a Millennial
Twilight Zone, which is about right.
Stranger Things
A homage to movies such as The Goonies
and ET, this 1980s-set sci-fi series is centered
around a group of kids caught up in supernatural
events in the fictional American town of
Hawkins, Indiana. Stranger Things was a surprise
hit last year, and season 2 is set to arrive in time
for Halloween.

What we liked:
It may not be as well-
known as the other
password managers
in this round-up, but
Sticky Password has what
it takes to claim the top
spot. We love the way it
guides you through the process of using
features such as autofill, with videos
and illustrated tutorials to help you
familiarise yourself with how it all works.
That’s not to say it’s hard to master.
The interface is both attractive and easy
to understand, with a sidebar that
provides instant access to your web
accounts, app accounts, bookmarks,
identities and secure memos.
The software can generate secure
logins, fill in forms and passwords
automatically and protect your data
using secure AES-256 encryption,
with the option of adding two-factor
authentication. You can also log into
sites using your fingerprint, as long
as you’re using a device that supports
this feature. As you’d expect, Sticky
Password is available for all the major
platforms and browsers.
The free version offers most of
the software’s main features, but
only Premium users have access to
cloud backup and sync – as is the
case with most password managers.
During setup, you can choose
whether or not you want to store
your passwords in the cloud. If you
decide you’d rather not sync your
login data through Sticky Password’s
servers, you can keep everything
local and only sync passwords
between devices over your home
network (or manually, if you prefer).
The paid-for version of Sticky
Password is cheaper than LastPass but
slightly more expensive than RoboForm,
although a small portion of your money
goes towards helping save endangered
manatees. There’s also a lifetime licence
option, so you can pay a one-off fee
rather than shell out money every year.
How it can be improved:
Sticky Password’s security dashboard
highlights weak passwords and lets
you change them, but this feature
is tucked away and should be given
greater prominence. We’d also prefer
it if you could access passwords that
are stored in the cloud from anywhere.
OUR VERDICT
This is a great, feature-packed
password manager with plenty
of help and guidance to get you
started. It’s very secure, is good
value for money and offers a very
welcome lifetime licence option.
With LastPass doubling
the price of its premium
service, it may be time to

What we liked:
RoboForm has been
protecting passwords
since 1999, so the
company knows what it’s
doing. It’s available for all
major platforms and can
import passwords from your
browser or another password manager.
The free version offers strong
encryption and unlimited logins, and

passwords and gives you a security
score. You can send login information
securely and request access if you’re
accidentally locked out.
The Everywhere edition costs £15.95
and adds the option to sync stored
details across devices and back up
logins to the cloud. You can share
folders securely and grant emergency
access to anyone you trust so they
can get into RoboForm in the event
of your incapacitation or death.

Passwords are stored in an online

manage them in folders and search for
any logins you need. It also provides

How it can be improved:
The interface is easy to use and
conveniently displays all the options you
need in the sidebar, but its grey-and-
white colour scheme isn’t especially
attractive and compared with other
password managers, it looks dated.
OUR VERDICT
RoboForm offers everything you’re
likely to need, and the option to
store your logins in the cloud and
sync them across all your devices
for just £16 a year is good value.
OUR VERDICT
LastPass is an excellent password
manager, with lots of features
wrapped up in a smart interface.
While the price hike is unwelcome,
it offers enough bonus features to
(just about) justify the increase.

data using a master password or
a key file that you can store on

You can use it to store unlimited

Search TinEye using an image to save you

Firefox’s Voice Fill tool lets you search
sites such as DuckDuckGo using your voice
46 6 - 19 September 2017
USE YOUR VOICE
We’re sure you’re familiar with
Google’s ‘Search by voice’ function,
which has been available on Android
since 2008 and on its homepage in
Chrome since 2011. To use it on your
phone or tablet, open the Google app
and either say “OK Google” or tap the
microphone, then speak your query.
On your desktop PC, click the
microphone in the Google search box.
This is a very useful feature, but if you
use it in your browser, you’re limited to
searching with Google (on mobile it also
works with other apps). To unleash the
full potential of speech recognition, you
need a Chrome extension called Voice
Search (bit.ly/voice431). Powered by
iSpeech (www.ispeech.org), this tool
lets you search sites including Google
Maps, YouTube, Wikipedia, Bing and
DuckDuckGo using your voice. Simply
click the microphone button on your
toolbar and speak the relevant
command. It can enter frequently
used terms automatically, so if you
say “my name”, it will fill in your name.
Firefox has been lacking built-in
voice-search functionality, so we’re
delighted to see that Mozilla has finally
addressed this deficiency with a feature
called Voice Fill. Currently available
as a Test Pilot experiment (bit.ly/
voicefill431), it places a microphone
button next to the search boxes for
Google, DuckDuckGo and Yahoo, so you
can speak your query rather than type
it. You’ll need to install the Test Pilot
add-on and allow access to your
microphone, and you should be aware
that during the test phase, Mozilla will
collect and analyse data about how the
tool is used – anonymously, of course.
USE A PICTURE
Reverse-image search engines
such as TinEye (www.tineye.com) and
Google Images (images.google.co.uk)
are a useful way of identifying the
subject of a photo, and they also save
you having to type anything when
you’re looking for higher-quality
or related images of something in
particular. To use either service, visit
its site and either upload the image
file, paste its URL or drag and drop the
image into the search box. Alternatively,
you can install TinEye’s add-on for
Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Opera
(tineye.com/extensions) or Google’s
Search by Image Chrome extension and
simply right-click a web image to look
it up. Both search engines find online
matches for your picture, so you can
view information about its content
and source, download a better-quality
version and see “visually similar”
shots of the same subject, as well
as modifications of the original.
Wolfram Alpha’s Image Identification
Project (www.imageidentify.com) goes
a step further by trying to guess the
subject of a picture – with varying
degrees of success!
USE YOUR CAMERA
Do you remember Google
Goggles, the revolutionary way of
searching online for items in the real
world by snapping them with your
phone’s camera? Possibly not, because
Google had lost interest in it by 2014,
deeming the app “of no clear use to too
many people”. However, you can still

the lowest prices for products and
more, without you needing to type a

and keeps a record of all your searches.
USE DRAG & DROP
A quick way to search without
typing in
Chrome is to
highlight some
text, right-click
it and choose
‘Search Google
for...’. An even
faster and more
flexible option,
with no right-
clicking
required, is
to install the
extension
Simple Drag & Drop Search (bit.ly/

multiple search engines. Highlight your
search term and a small panel opens
showing icons for sites including
Google, Wikipedia, YouTube, Twitter and
Google Maps. Click the one you want to
use to open the search results in a new
tab; or click the ‘S’ to view alternative
options or to copy the selected text to
your clipboard. You can customise the
icon panel to show only your favourite
search providers; or hide it in favour of
the drag -and-drop approach that gives
the add-on its name.
You may not realise that you can
also search for a term using your
browser’s default search engine
simply by dragging and dropping the
highlighted text to the address bar.
USE RIGHT-CLICK
As mentioned in the previous tip,
most browsers let you search for a
highlighted term on a web page by
right-clicking, but this limits you to your
default search engine. You can expand
your options by using an extension such
as Context Menu Search for Chrome
(bit.ly/context431) or Context Search for
Firefox (bit.ly/contextfire431), both of
which add extra search engines to your
right-click ‘Search with’ menu. You can
choose between Bing, IMDb, Amazon,
Wikipedia, iPlayer and more, so you can
select the best option for a particular
search. It saves you having to open a
new tab and post your query manually.
USE A SONG
If you want to identify a music
file you’ve downloaded or received,
you could search online for the lyrics
(if there are any), but a better way is to
upload the file to Audiotag (audiotag
.info). This site suggests possible
matches for the song, giving each a
likelihood rating, and even tells you
which albums the track is on. It’s very
easy to use, although to see the results
you need to “prove you’re a human” by
performing a simple sum. You can also
use Audiotag to identify online music
by copying and pasting the song’s URL.
Another option is to play a tune into a
music-recognition app such as Shazam
(www.shazam.com) or SoundHound
(www.soundhound.com). Both free
apps can identify millions of songs in
a couple of seconds, and they provide
detailed information about each track,
including lyrics and artist biographies.
Shazam is available for Windows 10,
as well as Android and iOS.
CORTANA
You can make Cortana
use Google rather than
Bing for searches by
installing Chrometana
for Chrome (bit.ly/
chrometana431) or
Bing-Google for
Firefox (bit.ly/
binggoogle431),
depending on which browser you use.
Chrometana also lets you search with
DuckDuckGo and Yahoo.
STOP YOUR VOICE ASSISTANT USING BING
SIRI
Apple has deliberately
locked Siri not to use
Google, but there is a
workaround for those who
would rather use Google
than Bing. When you
want to search the web,
say “Search Google for
[search term]” or “Search
DuckDuckGo for [search term]”. Siri
will launch Safari and display the results
from the relevant search engine.
ALEXA
Amazon’s voice assistant is even
more stubborn than Siri about using
Bing rather than Google as its default
search engine. However, you can
perform a hack that forces Alexa to
use Google instead. This comes in
the form of an unofficial Alexa skill
that uses Google Assistant. You can
download it from bit.ly/alexa431, but
make sure you read the instructions
and are aware of the ‘known issues’
before you install this skill.
Cortana, Siri and Alexa all use Bing rather than Google as their default search engine.
Here’s how to get round this restriction

use Google or DuckDuckGo
instead of Bing

Make free phone calls
If you’re in a rural area with a poor
phone signal, the quality of your
connection may make it impossible
to carry out a call. Thankfully, most
phone networks now let you make Wi-Fi
phone calls and send text messages
within your contract allowance.
EE’s Wi-Fi calling works automatically
with most new smartphones (see the full
list at bit.ly/ee431). For all other Android
and iOS devices, you’ll need to own the
EE version and have bought it directly
from the network.
Three customers with the latest iOS
devices (iPhone 5C onwards) and
Android devices (see list at bit.ly/
three431) bought directly from the
network can also make Wi-Fi calls and
texts. If your phone isn’t on the list, you
can download the Three inTouch app
(bit.ly/threeit431) for iOS and Android
to take advantage of free Wi-Fi calling.
Just remember to set up the app when
you have a phone signal, or you won’t
be able to use it when you don’t.
O2’s Wi-Fi calling is only compatible
with a limited number of devices (see
the list at bit.ly/o2431); and Vodafone’s
Wi-Fi calling requires you to be on one
of its Red or business tarrifs, as well as
having a compatible device, which you
can check at bit.ly/voda431.
Check your home for
intruders
No matter how well you’ve secured the
doors and windows of your property,
leaving your home empty when you go
away can be a worry. And it’s not just
potential intruders that are a threat –
you may be fretting over whether you
can trust your teenage kids not to throw
that party they absolutely promised
wouldn’t be happening.
Home-security cameras use your
Wi-Fi to connect to the web so you can
keep tabs on your home from anywhere
using a phone app. Our favourite is the
Y-Cam Evo (£129.99, bit.ly/ycam431),
which has a 720p camera with an
infrared LED for night-time viewing. Its
100-degree field of view should capture
the whole room if you position it in a
corner. The image quality may not be as
good as some of its more expensive
rivals, but the seven days of unlimited
free video storage is unbeatable value.
Wi-Fi isn’t only for browsing and streaming. Edward Munn
reveals brilliant and quirky things you never knew you could
do with your wireless connection
Cast Spotify to your
speakers
Did you know that
you can stream
music from the
Spotify app on
your smartphone
to your speakers
over Wi-Fi? The
easiest (and
cheapest) way to
do this is to simply
plug another
device that has
Spotify installed
and that you won’t
need to move –
your PC or tablet
would be perfect
– directly into your
speakers. Next,
make sure your
smartphone is
connected to the same Wi-Fi network
as the first device and, from your
phone’s Spotify app, tap Devices
Available from the Now Playing bar and
select your PC or tablet from the list.
Once that’s done, you can control your

playlist from your smartphone without
having to get up to change songs.
If you don’t have a spare tablet,
buying a Chromecast Audio (bit.ly/
audio431) is probably the next best
bet. Available for only £30, this handy
device plugs into the back of your
speakers via RCA jacks, a 3.5mm cable
or optical lead. After connecting it to
your Wi-Fi network, you can find it in
the same Devices Available list
described above. The Chromecast
Audio is also compatible with a range
of other music apps including Google
Play Music and Deezer.
Dim your lights
Smart lighting is becoming increasingly
common and many of the companies,
including Phillips and Nest, now
advertise their products on TV, but it’s
still an expensive option. However, that’s
about to change as Ikea has recently
introduced smart bulbs at an affordable
price. For just £29, you can pick up the
Remote kit, which includes a single
screw-fit 980-lumen LED bulb and
a palm-sized wireless remote that allows
you to switch the bulb on and off, dim
it and change colour temperature from
cool to warm. You can add further
screw-fit bulbs or GU10 spotlights
from just £9 and £12 a pop, and it’s
possible to pair up to 10 bulbs per
remote-control unit, so you could in
theory kit out an entire two-bedroom
flat for under £80.
Although it’s wireless, the Remote kit
doesn’t use your home Wi-Fi. For this,
you’ll need the Gateway kit (£69), which
includes a wireless hub that connects to
your router, two bulbs and a wireless
remote. This kit gives you the ability to
control your lights using your phone.
Log your weight loss
Checking your weight is just one tedious
part of dieting, but wouldn’t it be a little
less painful if you had a scale that
automatically logs your weight and
sends it to your smartphone every
morning? Thankfully, such a thing
already exists in devices such as the
Nokia Body+ (bit.ly/nokia431) and Fitbit
Aria (bit.ly/fitbit431). You won’t get
much change from £100 when buying
either device, but they make it much
easier to keep track of metrics such as
your body-fat percentage and BMI
(as well as your weight), and they send
all this information to your smartphone
via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Both scales
recognise up to eight users and the
Nokia Body+ even gives you a weather
forecast to make sure you’re prepared
for the day ahead!
Boil the kettle
How much easier would life be if you
could make a cuppa in the TV ad break
without having to wait for the kettle
to boil? The iKettle 3.0 from Smarter
(bit.ly/ikettle431), available from
Amazon for £99.99, could save you up
to 33 hours a year by letting you check
the water level in your kettle and switch
it on from a smartphone app. You can
even set iKettle alarms so you don’t ever
have to wait for a brew, and can choose
the temperature, if you’d like warm
rather than boiling water.
The iKettle can be paired with other
IoT (internet of things) devices and
services including Alexa, IFTTT and
Nest, making your home even smarter;
and thanks to the app’s ability to
connect securely via 4G, you can also
‘remote boil’ from anywhere outside
your home. If you’re more of a coffee
fiend than a tea drinker, Smarter is
releasing a new version of its coffee
machine later this month.
Amazon’s Echo speaker added support for voice
calling in May, enabling you to make free calls to
anyone else who uses its Alexa assistant, using only
your voice. Interestingly, the feature is not only
available to Echo owners, but also works if you have
the Alexa smartphone app (bit.ly/alexaapp431)
installed on your iOS or Android device. This has
prompted Google to play catch-up, adding voice
calling to the Home’s already impressive range of
skills, albeit only in the US and Canada at the moment.
Until it’s supported here, UK users will have to make
do with instructing Google Now to make a hands-free
call. To do this, simply say “OK Google...call (contacts
name)”. Just bear in mind that you’ll need to manually
activate your device’s loudspeaker.

ere has been around since 1985,
but it only acquired the name in
2012 when its then-owner Nokia
brought all its mapping and navigation
services together. It was later sold to
a consortium of German car makers
– Audi, BMW and Daimler – plus Intel,
which also has a stake. Since then, its
map products have been expanding
and improving, and it now provides
a genuine alternative to Google Maps.
As well as its online service, Here
WeGo, it’s available in app form for both

Automate Windows
lock and shutdown
2
Click Start, open Settings and click Accounts, then ‘sign-in
options’. Scroll down the page until you see ‘Dynamic
lock’, then tick the box to ‘Allow Windows to detect when
you’re away and automatically lock the device’. 1 Now, when
you walk away from your PC with your smartphone, Windows
should lock automatically.
1
Before you can use Smart Lock, you must pair your
smartphone with your Windows 10 PC via Bluetooth.
Make sure Bluetooth is enabled on your phone, then type
Bluetooth into the Start menu on your PC and open ‘Bluetooth
& other devices’. Click ‘Add Bluetooth or other device’ 1 and
follow the instructions on screen to pair the devices.
3
Next, run AMP WinOff. You’ll see a number of different
options that you can set under the ‘Shutdown planning’
tab. 1 First, choose the type of shutdown you want to
schedule from the list at the bottom. These include ‘Power off’,
Restart, ‘Lock session’ and Sleep. 2
4
Now you can set the criteria that will trigger your
chosen shutdown. If you want to schedule your PC to
shut down at a particular time, tick the box to enable
a ‘Date/time’ 1 condition. You can also tick the Date box 2
to select a specific date.
W
indows 10 Creators Update introduced Smart Lock, which
lets you set your PC to lock whenever you move away from
it using a paired Bluetooth device, such as your phone.
In this Workshop, we show you how to set up this handy feature so
that you never leave your PC unlocked while it’s unattended.
We also show you how to use AMP WinOFF, a lightweight tool that
lets you set your PC to power off, lock, restart or go to sleep
automatically under certain conditions. This can be a specific time
and date, or when a countdown timer finishes, but you can also
schedule shutdowns after a period of inactivity, or if processor usage
falls below a certain level. This can be invaluable if you want to leave
your PC to perform a large download and then shut down as soon as
it’s finished. You can even set multiple conditions and choose
whether one or all of them must be met before the PC shuts down.
Edward Munn says
To ensure your PC always
shuts down successfully,
switch on the ‘Force
shutdown’ option from the
‘General options’ page.
Under this is an option to
‘Force closing only for
non-responding
applications’. Tick that, too,
so programs aren’t forced
to close prematurely.

Alternatively, tick the Interval box 1 and set a time
interval (either in hours and minutes or in days)
after which your PC will shut down. The ‘User activity’
option lets you schedule a shutdown when the PC hasn’t been
used for a certain amount of time. 2
6
If you enable ‘User activity’ as a condition, also tick the
box to ‘Observe system/display low power blocks’. 1
Doing this stops Windows shutting down if a process
or application is preventing your PC from entering its low-
power mode.
7
‘CPU load’ 1 lets you shut down your PC if its processor
activity falls below a certain level – for example, if it’s
working at less than 5% for more than 10 minutes. If you
use this feature, it’s a good idea to tick the boxes that disable
your screensaver 2 and take an average CPU load 3 for the
last five seconds.
8
The final option is network usage. 1 Here, you can set
your PC to shut down if upload or download activity falls
below a specific amount for a set period of time. If you
use this option, make sure you select the correct network
adapter from the drop-down menu. 2
10
When you’re happy with your configuration, click the
buttons to save 1 and enable 2 your shutdown plan.
Clicking the ‘General options’ tab 3 lets you enable
other features, such as reactivating the last planned shutdown
4 when the PC restarts. If you use this option, make sure you
also tick ‘Load on Windows startup’. 5
9
The default setting (in the bottom-right corner) is for
WinOFF to perform a shutdown if any single condition
is met, 1 but you can also choose ‘All conditions must
be triggered’. 2 This way, you can set your PC to wait until
there’s no user activity and no network activity before it shuts
down, for example.

Control several PCs using one keyboard
W
orking on a desktop PC and a laptop
simultaneously can be really frustrating when you
constantly have to switch from one mouse and
keyboard to another. Synergy fixes this problem by letting
you control up to 15 computers
on the same network using only
the keyboard and mouse of your
main computer.
Synergy: bit.ly/synergy431 |

Windows,
Mac,
Linux
1
Download and install Synergy on two PCs you want
to use. When the ‘Server or client?’ window appears, 1
choose Server 2 on the main PC (the one whose mouse
and keyboard you want to use to control both computers)
and select Client 3 on the second PC. Click Finish. 4
2
When prompted to activate Synergy, click Cancel, then
Yes, which just means you can use its free features
without a licence. On the Client (the second PC, which
you want to control with the main computer’s keyboard),
make a note of its screen name, 1 as listed in Synergy.
3
On the Server (main computer), click ‘Configure server’,
then click and drag the new computer icon to mimic the
position of the two machines on your desk. 1 Double-
click the Unnamed PC and give it the screen name you noted
down earlier. Click OK, then OK again.
4
Enter the IP address of the Server (shown in Synergy)
in the box on the Client screen. 1 Click Apply 2 and
Start on both machines. You can now move your mouse
off the left or right edge of the Server screen (depending on
the positions you set up in step 3) and control the Client.
5
After moving your cursor to the Client screen, you can
use the Server’s keyboard to control it. You can add as
many Client PCs as you like and control them in this
way by following the instructions in Steps 1-4. On the Server,
click Configure Server and ‘Advanced server settings’. 1

How to...
Try Windows 10 S
on a virtual machine
You don’t need to buy a new laptop to try Windows 10 S.
Wayne Williams explains how to run it
What is Windows 10 S?
Windows 10 S is, essentially, a more
secure version of Windows 10 that can
only run apps from the Windows Store.
In other words, you can’t install regular
Windows programs on it. This might
seem like a strange idea but the
reasoning behind it is sound – by

indows remains by far the
most popular desktop
operating system, but it
faces increasing pressure from rival
software. Chrome OS, Google’s
browser-based operating system,
is used a lot in schools and is
spreading its influence in business
environments, not least because the
Chromebooks that Chrome OS runs
on are secure and cheap, which
makes them especially popular with
students and IT departments.
Windows 10 S – a locked-down
version of Windows 10 – is Microsoft’s
attempt to challenge Chrome OS.

However, that’s not strictly true.
Microsoft recently made Windows 10 S
available for developers on the MSDN
network to download in ISO format, and
then released an installer (aimed at the
education market), which lets anyone
take the new OS for a spin.

virtual environment. The process is
a little more convoluted than normal
and takes a while longer as a result,
but it’s easy enough to do.
What you need to know before
you start
Unless you have the developer ISO (from
the MSDN network), the only way to try
Windows 10 S currently is to install it over
a copy of Windows 10. You don’t need to
own or run Microsoft’s operating system
to do this because it’s easy to get a free
(and perfectly legal) copy to use. This
is the main reason why the process of
installing and running Windows 10 S
in a virtual environment takes so long
– you first need to install Windows 10,
then “upgrade” it to Windows 10 S,
which isn’t a quick process.
There are some other restrictions to

Windows 10 as the version 2 or
choose ‘Windows 10 (64bit)’ if you

Once Windows 10 is installed
in VirtualBox and fully updated,
you’ll be ready to convert it to
Windows 10 S. Open Microsoft Edge
(since this is the only browser you’ll

the OS you require.
If you’re running Windows 10 already,
the program will automatically select the
same version for you. If that’s not suitable
(perhaps you’re running Windows 10
Home but want an ISO for Windows 10
Pro), then untick ‘Use the recommended
options for this PC’ and select the version
you want. Click Next and select ‘ISO file’,
then download this to your hard drive.
What’s new or different in
Windows 10 S
You can download software from outside
the Windows Store as normal but if
you try to install it, you’ll be greeted
with a message stating ‘For security
and performance Windows 10 S only
runs verified apps from the Store’.
The OS only allows you to use the
Microsoft Edge browser. You can’t install
Firefox or Chrome because Microsoft’s
browser is the fixed default and there’s
(currently) no way to change it.
Microsoft sees this as a major bonus,
because Edge is designed to work very
closely with the operating system, but if
you’re used to a different browser, Edge
will seem rather alien and many of the
extensions you might rely on in your
regular browser won’t be available to you.
Windows 10 S is tied to Microsoft
products, so when you search the web
in the operating system you’ll be using
Bing (unless you browse to Google.com
manually).
One good point about Windows 10 S
is it’s much faster than Windows 10
because it isn’t bogged down in any way.
This means it can run on lighter hardware.
It can boot in around 15 seconds and,
when installed on a laptop, deliver
significantly better battery life. You won’t
notice this kind of difference so much in
a virtualised environment, though.
Windows 10 S looks and behaves much like Windows 10,
but starts quicker
Windows 10 S blocks you from installing software from outside the
Windows Store, and points you in the direction of ‘safe’ downloads
Edge is the default (and only) browser that
you can use in Windows 10 S

Empty the trash
When you delete files and folders on
your computer, they’re moved to the
Recycle Bin, but they still occupy drive
space. To recover this space, you have
to empty the bin. Online storage works
in exactly the same way.
Whether you have OneDrive, Google
Drive, Dropbox or something else, open
the Recycle Bin, Trash or whatever the
service calls it and empty it, or at least
select and delete any files you
definitely don’t need. Files can remain
in there for years, taking up valuable
space. Sort the files by date and
delete the oldest ones first.
Get more Google Drive
space
Everyone who has a Google account
gets 15GB of space on Google Drive,
but sometimes you can earn more.
In 2015 and 2016, Google encouraged
D
o you have files stored in OneDrive,
Google Drive or Dropbox that you
don’t use very often? If so, you can
save space by storing these seldom-used
files in compressed Zip archives. How much
space you’ll save depends on the type of
file, but for some it can be as much as 50%.
You can’t compress your files online –
you have to do it on your PC and upload
them. This is easy if you have a synced
OneDrive, Google Drive or Dropbox folder.
Select one or more of your files and folders
in Explorer, right-click them and select
Send to, then ‘Compressed (zipped) folder’.
Delete the originals to leave only the Zip
archive and let the folder sync. This frees
up online storage space so you can store
more files.
Compress files
Choose what to sync
The contents of the OneDrive folder on
your PC’s hard drive syncs automatically
with your OneDrive online storage,
but you don’t need to sync absolutely
everything. If you find you’re short of
space, you can exclude some items.
For example, do you really need to
store your videos online? If you don’t,
exclude them by right-clicking the
OneDrive folder in Explorer’s sidebar
and selecting ‘Choose OneDrive folders
to sync’. Clear the tick box next to
Videos and any other folders you don’t
need to store online, then open a
browser, go to OneDrive and delete
everything in the Videos folder. The files
on your PC will remain on the PC,
freeing up valuable online space.
Compress files you rarely access
by turning them into Zip archives

don’t need to sync

More advanced tips for when you’re feeling brave
users of its services to take a security
check-up. The reward for doing this was
to have an extra 2GB of space added
your Drive account. If you’d done both
check-ups, you would now have 19GB.
It’s possible that Google will offer
another security check-up in 2017. If you
see it, make the most of it because you
may get another 2GB of free space.
You can also earn points for writing
reviews on Google Maps if you sign up
at maps.google.com/localguides. When
you visit places, you’re asked to provide
a review, rating or photo. This earns
points, which you can exchange for
items. Offers vary, but in the past some
people have used their points to get
extra online storage space.
Convert to Docs and Sheets
Google Docs and Sheets don’t count as
space used on Google Drive, so if you
have Word or Excel documents on
there, convert them to Google
documents. Click a Word or Excel file
in a browser on Google Drive to view it,
then click the button at the top to open
it in Docs or Sheets. Delete the original
file to recover the space.
If you want to store a photograph
or other image on Google Drive without
using any space, open it in a photo
editor, such as Paint, press Ctrl+A,
Ctrl+C to copy it, then create a new
Google Docs document and press
Ctrl+V to paste it in. Because the photo
is now a Google Doc, it takes up zero
space in Drive.
Check your phone
If you bought a new phone recently,
check it for bundled apps. Sometimes
OneDrive, Dropbox or Office apps are
pre-installed and, if you run them and
sign in, you may be given a storage
boost. Offers come and go but we’ve
managed to get up to 100GB extra
space for two years.
Back up your photos
OneDrive and Dropbox used to provide
extra free storage space if you enabled
automatic photo uploads from your
phone. You may be too late to take up
this offer but try it anyway. Open the
OneDrive or Dropbox app on your
phone, go to the settings and enable
automatic upload of your photos.
Get Office 365
If you use Office applications such as
Word and Excel, get an Office deal
(office.microsoft.com) such as Office
365 Personal with 1TB of OneDrive
storage included. It costs £5 a month,
which you pay annually, but for both
software and storage, that’s a good deal.
Compress photos
Using Google Photos is a great way
to free up space on your phone or
computer, and it’s also handy for
backup purposes. Go to photos
.google.com in a browser, click the
menu button in the top-left corner
and click Settings in the sidebar.
Here, you’ll see an option to store
photos at high quality or original
quality. High quality is free, unlimited
and uses no Google Drive space, and
photos can be up to 16 megapixels.
Original-quality photos and videos
count against your Google Drive
Space, so use high quality instead.
Also, click the Recover Storage
button to see how much space you
can recover by compressing your
images. It could be a gigabyte or
more. The compression is barely
noticeable and your photos will take
up less space.
Delete email attachments
Your Google Drive space isn’t only
used to store files – Gmail uses it, too.
If you have a lot of large email
attachments, they can take up a lot of
room. Delete any attachments you
no longer need to free up Drive space.
Open Gmail in a browser,
type has:attachment in
the search box and you’ll
see every message that
has a file attached listed
in date order. Go to the
oldest (you may need to
go to the next page of
search results) and delete
any you don’t want to
keep. Deleted emails are
removed after 30 days,
but if you need the space
straight away, click More
in the sidebar, then click
Bin and empty it.
More iCloud storage
Apple gives iPhone and iPad users
5GB of free iCloud storage space.
However, iOS uses this to store
photos, iPhone and iPad backups,
files and settings from apps and
more, so the free storage space
fills up very quickly.
You can recover some space on
iCloud by switching from Apple
Photos to Google Photos. Google
provides unlimited free storage for
photos of up to 16 megapixels. Photos
taken on the iPhone and iPad are
smaller than that, so Google stores
them at full resolution for free.
Install Google Photos and enable
Photos backup in the app settings.
Then open iOS Settings, press Photos
& Camera and turn off iCloud Photo
Library. Check that Google Photos
has saved all your images, then go
to icloud.com in a web browser and
delete any photos that are stored
there to free up the space.
Configure iOS backups
An iPhone or iPad can back up all
your data, such as contacts, settings,
app data and so on, to iCloud. There’s
no need to back up everything,
though, and removing unnecessary
items from the backup reduces your
iCloud usage, leaving space for more
important things.
Open the Settings app and press
General, ‘Storage & iCloud Usage’,
Manage Storage (under iCloud), then
your iPhone or iPad (under Backups).
Turn off any apps that you don’t need
to back up, such as Facebook, which
stores everything online in your
Facebook account anyway. Doing this
can save you hundreds of megabytes
of online space.
Stop backing up apps that don’t need to be backed
up and save iCloud storage space

Fix laptop Wi-Fi problems
Q
I bought an Acer Aspire ES 11 laptop
from Amazon in April and ever since
then, it has suffered from an
intermittent internet connection. Acer’s
tech support suggested that I reset the
laptop, but that didn’t help. I also
uninstalled McAfee because it was out
of date. When I took the laptop to work,
however, I had no problem with the
internet connection, and it was fast.
I haven’t contacted BT yet, but my
home internet works perfectly well with
my old laptop. Acer’s support also
suggested I send the laptop back for
repair, but said there would be a fee.
Should I send the laptop back to
Amazon or put it in for repair with Acer?
Something is making the internet cut
out. Sometimes it connects and at other
times it doesn’t, even though Windows
says the Wi-Fi is connected.
Irene Roberts, via email
A
There are a few things you can try
before sending it for repair. Open
the Control Panel, then open Power
Options. There are usually several power
plans here and ‘High performance’
should be selected. Click ‘Change
plan settings’, then click ‘Change
advanced power settings’. Expand
’Wireless adapter settings’, then ‘Power
saving mode’. Set this to ‘Maximum
performance’, both for when the laptop
is plugged in and when it’s running
on battery power. This stops your PC
putting the Wi-Fi to sleep, which is
a possible cause of the problem.
Alternatively, there may be a clash
between the devices on the network.
Each one must have a unique IP
address. Open ‘Network and Sharing
Centre’ in the Control Panel and click
the active network link. Click Properties
and double-click Internet Protocol
Version 4 in the next window. This
should be set to obtain an IP address
automatically. Close all the windows.
Switch off the power to the router,
wait 10 seconds and switch it on again.
Doing this now and then can help,
especially when you’re having
connection problems.
Next, check for any driver updates.
Right-click the Start button and select
Device Manager. Expand ‘Network
adapters’, then right-click each one and
select ‘Update driver’.
It’s rare, but we’ve heard that some
computers and routers just don’t get
along. You say your laptop works fine at
work, which could indicate that there’s
a problem with your home Wi-Fi.
It would be useful to try the laptop in
a few other locations, such as a friend’s
house. If it works there, too, your router
could be causing the problem.

Get an Android upgrade
Q
I imported a Huawei Honor 3C 4G
phone from China in 2014 because
I wanted a good-value 4G phone that
would be future-proof for a few years
and save me money in the long run.
However, it’s stuck on Android 4.42.
It has a 1.6GHz quad-core processor,
2GB RAM and 16GB storage, expandable
to 32GB, and yet the operating system
never updates. I emailed Huawei UK and
they said they wouldn’t upgrade it
because it’s imported. I emailed Huawei
in China but haven’t received a reply.
I’m disappointed that I can’t upgrade
Android, because the phone is more

Connect a keyboard to
a misshapen iPad
Q
I bought a Logitech keyboard case
to use with my iPad Pro, but when
I inserted the iPad, I noticed that it was
warped and wouldn’t connect properly
unless I pushed hard on the frame.
I contacted Apple but was unwilling
to pay the exorbitant price I was quoted
to fix a device that otherwise works
perfectly. Are there any quick fixes
I could try, or could you recommend
another low-cost option?
Thomas Davenport, via email
A
There are two options: get the iPad
fixed or use a different keyboard.
If the iPad is out of warranty, get quotes
from other repair services and compare
them with Apple’s. Search online for
‘iPad repair’, followed by your nearest
town to find local repairers.
It sounds as if you bought the
Logitech keyboard case, which plugs
into the iPad using a physical connector,
but other iPad keyboards operate
wirelessly and so don’t need a physical
connection. You can also buy keyboards
that use a short cable to connect to the
iPad’s lightning connector, which would
also get around the problem.
It’s worth contacting Logitech or
the retailer to explain the situation and
ask if you can swap your keyboard for
a wireless one. Otherwise, sell it on eBay
and use the money to buy an alternative.
force an update. Google supplies its
Android operating system to the
manufacturers of phones and tablets,
not to the public. When a manufacturer
receives the latest version of Android,
it customises the OS for each device
it wants it to run on. There’s little
incentive for a company to do this for
old phones and tablets. At best, they
may get a bug fix if it’s serious enough.
If you want to buy a phone or tablet
that receives Android updates, you’ll
have to pay for a top-of-the-range
model. Samsung’s flagship device, the
Samsung Galaxy S6, S7 and S8 line for
example, all receive new versions of
Android sooner or later.
The bottom line is that device
manufacturers provide Android
upgrades, and if they won’t upgrade
your device, there’s nothing you can do.

Update touchpad drivers in
Windows 10
Q
I’m running Windows 10 on an old
laptop. It works fine except for the
touchpad, so I use a mouse instead, but
I would like to get the touchpad working
again. I’ve been to the manufacturer’s
website but I could only find drivers
for Windows 7. What can I do?
Paul Baker, via email
A
Windows 10 is compatible with lots
of old computer hardware, so there
are a couple of options you can try.
The first is to remove the touchpad and
mouse driver to see if Windows’ own
alternative works better. The second
option is to try an old driver.
Right-click the Start button and select
Device Manager from the menu. Expand
the Human Interface Devices section,
then expand ‘Mice and other pointing
devices’. Right-click each item and
select Update Driver. If you find a
touchpad driver and there isn’t an
update available, right-click it and select
‘Uninstall device’. Restart Windows
and a default driver will be installed.
If the touchpad still isn’t working
properly after Windows has restarted,
download the Windows 7 drivers
from the manufacturer’s website.
If it’s a Zip file, extract its contents.
Right-click the driver installer and
select Properties from the menu. Click
the Compatibility tab, tick the box
‘Run this program in compatibility
mode for’ and select Windows 7 from
the list. Installing Windows 7 drivers
in compatibility mode sometimes
fixes this type of problem.
Q
When writing an email in
Outlook.com, you can set its
importance to High, Normal or
Low. What difference does this
make? Do messages arrive faster
if I set them to high importance?
M Taylor, via email
A
Setting the importance of an
email has nothing to do with
delivery speed. It simply places an
indicator next to your message. If you
set an email to High importance, the
recipient sees a red exclamation mark
beside it in their inbox; at Normal
importance, there’s no symbol; and
a message set to Low importance has
a down arrow or something similar.
This can be handy because when
people check their inbox, the red
exclamation mark catches their eye
and they’re more likely to read the
message. That’s the theory, at least,
but there are a couple of reasons not
to use it. First, there’s no guarantee
that the recipient’s mail service will
support it, and second, spammers
sometimes mark junk mail as
important to make you read it or to
try to bypass spam filters. It’s a nice
idea, but it doesn’t work in practice.

Upgrade your hard drive
Q
I’m thinking of asking my local
computer shop to upgrade the
hard drive in my computer to
a superfast solid-state drive (SSD),
but I’d like your opinion on a couple
of things before I go ahead. Is it true
that an SSD can only be rewritten over
a limited number of times? If so, how
long do SSDs last on average?
Also, because SSDs have no moving
parts, does this make them more reliable
than hard drives, which have spinning
discs and moving arms?
Sue Rigby, via email
A
SSDs do indeed have a limit to
the number of times they can be
written over. However, modern SSDs
use special techniques to distribute the
wear and lengthen the lifespan. There’s
no need to worry about it wearing out
because SSDs last for many years –
probably longer even than the computer
you’re installing it in.

I started using File History to back up my

If you haven’t yet discovered it, open File

Video vs battery
If you watch videos on a laptop, there’s
a setting you may not have noticed
that lets you prioritise the quality of
the picture or the battery life. You can
have one or the other, but not both.
In the Settings app in Windows 10,
choose System, then Battery. Look for
‘More saving options’. Under ‘When
watching films and videos on battery
power’, there are two options: ‘Optimise
for battery life’ and ‘Optimise for video
quality’. It’s a personal choice, but I go
for video quality.

Lock your PC instantly
In Issue 425 (bit.ly/webuser425), there’s
a tip about remotely terminating
Telegram sessions. Of course, it’s good
to know how to do this but, in my
opinion, there’s no excuse for leaving a
PC unattended and showing your active

anyone could open or copy your files or,
worse, delete them. They could email
pretending to be you or even install

While browsing tips from Microsoft,
I came across an unusual one for
extending the life of a laptop’s battery.
Go dark. Apparently, the darker the
screen the longer the battery lasts.
I don’t mean the obvious method of
turning down the screen brightness
–I mean using dark Windows themes.
This will work in Windows 7 with
slightly different menu options but
here’s what Microsoft recommends in
Windows 10. Open the Settings app
and click Personalisation, then Themes.
Select the darkest theme available.
Then select Background on the left,
set the background to ‘Solid colour’

Pay less for premium VPNs
Over the past few months, I have been
looking at subscribing to a paid-for VPN
service so I can reliably stay secure and
occasionally access ‘geo-locked’ content.
First, I looked at TunnelBear (www
.tunnelbear.com). On its website, the
monthly cost is $9.99 (around £7.75).
However, if you download the iPhone
app, you can get the same package for
£4.99 per month (through an in-app
purchase). It’s the same story for
Keepsolid VPN Unlimited (www
.vpnunlimtedapp.com), but the other way
around: the mobile app would like to
charge you £8.49 for a month’s service,
but on the website you can pay $8.99
(around £7). Moreover, if you pay with
PayPal, you get a further small discount
with no conversion fee.
If you’re looking for a paid subscription
to an app you use, it’s worth taking
a look at all the options because you can
sometimes save yourself a few quid.

Send Google Photos straight
to the printers
I recently wanted to print some of my
Google Photos snaps and wondered
if there was a simple way to send them
directly to a printer without having to
download each file and upload them
again. After a quick Google search,
I discovered this can be done with
Photobox (www.photobox.co.uk). First,
you need to save all the photos you want
to print to an album in Google Photos.
Next, open Photobox, click the Upload
button and click the Google+ icon. You’ll
be invited to log into your Google
account and, after this, you should be
able to see all your Google Photos
albums. Select one and you can then
drag and drop the snaps you want to

BLUNDER OF THE FORTNIGHT
Have you managed to fix a PC-related disaster?
If so, please send your story to webuser@dennis.co.uk
I recently made the blunder that many
others have probably made and
dropped my smartphone in the sink!
I had read many tips in the past saying
the best way to save your device in
such an event is to switch it off
immediately, then fully cover it with
rice. So, I turned my phone off and as
soon as I was home, I placed my trusty
Samsung in a bowl of basmati rice!
Unfortunately, after about 24 hours,
I turned on my phone and it worked
briefly before failing shortly afterwards.
I’ve since looked up the rice method
and found several articles saying
that drying your device in this way
is not advisable because it leaves
behind the water’s impurities that
cause your device to short-circuit
and stop working.
So, if you accidentally soak your
laptop, phone or tablet, it’s right to

turn it off straight away but before you
try turning it back on, you should take
it to a specialist who can dry and clean
it in the appropriate way. Hopefully my
mistake might enable others to rescue
their sodden devices!

According to this page (bit.ly/

Edge should work with the software

it? It also works with Internet Explorer,

If you don’t have much hard-drive

right-click the taskbar and select Task

disable any programs you don’t need at
startup by right-clicking them and
choosing Disable. Finally, type CMD into
the Start menu, right-click the app and
select ‘Run as administrator’. If you have
a mechanical hard drive (as opposed

then run it from that to avoid

Stop rewarding the ﬁrst
correct entry
I have been a subscriber to your amazing
magazine for many years now and totally
love it. However, one thing has always
annoyed me: why do you have
competitions like the emoji quiz
on your ‘Take a Screen Break’ page
that insist that the ﬁrst entry wins?
It makes me not want to bother
entering as I know the competition will
have already been won by someone
else. Why can’t it be the ﬁrst correct
entry picked at random that wins, so
everyone gets a chance?
There is nothing worse – especially for
people buying the magazine from a shop
who don’t get the advantage of the early
release the subscription offers – to ﬁnd
the competitions has been won long ago.
Please, please, please give this some

Tor is not overkill for internet
research
I am so glad that Mr Flynn (Inbox, Issue
429) ﬁnds online surveillance amusing.
He apparently isn’t a regular reader or he
would be aware of the recent exchanges
between myself and Mr Walker on this
I
thought your ‘Secret web loopholes
that save you money’ feature in Issue
428 was excellent. I’ll certainly be
enjoying some free movies through
Comparethemarket.com! Meanwhile,
I thought I’d share a few money-saving
loopholes I’ve found myself.
Sometimes websites offer ‘social
discounts’, whereby if you ‘share’ your
purchase on Facebook or Twitter,
they’ll give you 10% off. Many people
don’t like doing this because why
would you want all your friends to see
your buying habits? However, there
is a little-known option in the bottom
left-hand corner where you can select
who sees the post and one option is
‘Only me’. This means your friends will
not see details of your purchase, but
you’ll still get the discount. I recently
bought a charger from Doohickey Hut
Further web loopholes that save you money
and saved £1 by doing exactly that.
I also use a Chrome extension called
Honey (www.joinhoney.com), which
automatically checks for any active
coupon codes at checkout. It works very
well and recently saved me £3 on an
Amazon order. It ﬁnds a valid code about
20% of the time and the saving varies
between a percentage discount or
a ﬂat sum taken off the total.
Additionally, I have an app on my
phone called Zeek, which is essentially
a database of gift cards for sale.
If you’re planning to spend a lot of
money somewhere, it’s worth checking
this app ﬁrst. For example, my brother
is getting married next year and they
need to buy a lot of wine for the
wedding. On the app, there were
10 gift cards for Laithwaites Wines,
which will give us an 8% discount,
saving us £122.
There are all sorts of brands on
there and although the percentage
savings are slim, it can still work out
to a signiﬁcant saving if you spend
a lot of money.

subject. I am aware, Mr Flynn, that
torrent ﬁles (in most circumstances)
are not illegal to use. However, given
the volume and type of research that
I conduct via the internet on a daily
basis, Tor and a VPN are increasingly
warranted – particularly under the
current US administration.
Sporadically, but increasingly, when
a potentially controversial report or
article is sought from certain countries
via the UK, either horrendous delays are
experienced or the site ‘times out’ or is
unavailable
when
employing
my usual
browser.
On several
occasions,
employing
Tor and a VPN has located what I seek
quickly and relatively simply. Also, as
Web User and others have recently
pointed out, Google frequently cannot
be trusted to deliver the most relevant
search results.
I experienced this most recently when
seeking certain civil-rights sources –
including “out-of-print” (his emphasis)
books. Also, Mr Flynn, my most recent
download was a book from 1926
(copyright subsists for 70 years) which
I found via Tor and a torrent site when
Google and my customary browser
proved unsuccessful. Mr Flynn’s words
assume that the material I was seeking
was subject to copyright but, in the vast
majority (perhaps all) of the instances to
which I refer, he is wrong, at least in my
case. Project Gutenberg is an oft-used
source and all of their resources are
free of copyright.
My own experiences to which his
response refers show that I am correct
and I am by no means the only person
who has experienced this. Several
university researchers of my
acquaintance relate similar events.

Flaky BT chokes my internet
speed
I nearly choked on my cornﬂakes
when I read that BT promises 10Mbps
broadband for all (Web User, Issue 429).
I use BT as my ISP by local landline but
my copper connection is more than
a mile from the Openreach green cabinet
to which I am connected and the
download speed is a miserable 600Kbps
– yes, that’s Kbps. At certain times of the
day, it is almost unreceivable. In fact, at
the time of writing I am unable to run
the BT speed checker! Fortunately,
I am eligible for the government’s rural
broadband initiative and was provided
with a satellite connection in 2016, giving
me the luxury of an average of 3Mbps.
The irony is that there is a green
cabinet in the village about 500 yards
from my road-side connection but when
this was installed, BT ignored the few
properties on the edge of the village.
As has been suggested previously,
it appears that BT has again taken the
easiest and cheapest options, pocketing
the government subsidies on the way.
Oh, by the way, I didn’t choke on my
cornﬂakes because in this part of rural
(but not isolated) Yorkshire, my copy of
Web User, delivered through the post,
doesn’t arrive until mid-afternoon!

Searching for a new backup
service
I ﬁnd myself writing to you again about
cloud-backup solutions. Not long after
my last email to you about your review
of these services, I received an email
from SquirrelSave stating that it will no
longer be continuing its service due to
lack of interest. This is such a shame
because it was excellent value for money.
The company is now concentrating on
its business side.
So after reading all your reviews and
because I had a lot of data to back up
from four PCs, I took the family plan
from CrashPlan. Initially, I tried the free
30 days before paying for an annual
subscription. Now, only a few months
in, CrashPlan has also decided to stop
offering its plans to ‘home’ customers.
Instead, it’s shifting to enterprise and
small-business sectors.
So I ﬁnd myself again wondering
where to shift my cloud-backup solution.
I have thought of using Carbonite, but
I would have to buy a plan for each PC,
which would work out quite expensive.
I do have local backups, but I take the
advice that you should always have more
than one. Any suggestions, anyone?

Save a fortune in printer ink
As a Web User subscriber, I download
all my magazines to my iPad, and
sometimes it takes me a while to catch
up with all the issues. Today I was
reading Issue 425, in particular the
printer reviews on page 20.
It seems you have not heard of HP
Instant Ink, which saves me a fortune.
Both the HP machines you reviewed are
eligible for it. And for £7.99 a month you
can print 300 pages in colour (there are
several options), so that’s 2.6p a page or
£133 for 5,000 pages. Very reasonable.
You also get the bonus of not having
to hunt for the best price for a printer
cartridge every time you run out. They
just arrive in the post because the printer
communicates with HP. It’s a fantastic
system – all your readers should know
about it and encourage other
manufacturers to do the same.
Also, I don’t understand your ﬁgures
for the Epson printer. You say it costs
0.5p (that’s half a penny) per colour
page. That makes printing 5,000 pages
only £25 but your chart shows the
ﬁgure somewhere around £200.
Very confusing.
Elaine Eustace, via email
Web User says: Thanks for the tip about
HP Instant Ink, Elaine. Regarding your
query about our ﬁgures for the Epson
EcoTank ET-2600 (pictured), our quoted
cost included the price of the printer

than most of the printers in our Group

anywhere in public and casually open
the Facebook app, you and everyone
else around you will be subject to

appears in your timeline. Adverts,
football clips, prank videos or the James
Corden Carpool
Karaoke quoted
earlier,
which blasted
out of my
phone when
I fired up
Facebook this
morning.
Facebook, of course, pleads that
it’s doing us a favour. “We’re always
working to make Facebook a better
place to watch videos,” claims the
pop-up message introducing this rotten
feature. “That’s why videos now play
with the sound on automatically.”
Except nobody else thinks this makes
life better. Autoplaying ads have
become such a nuisance that Apple now
blocks them from playing in the latest
Barry Collins wants an ASBO placed on
Facebook’s latest mobile ‘feature’
Page 404
version of its Safari browser for Mac OS.
The Coalition For Better Ads also rails
against autoplaying video with sound.
“This ad experience is especially
disruptive because it catches the reader
off guard and often compels them to
quickly close the window or tab in order
to stop the sound,” the Coalition states,
“especially if they are
on their mobile device
and in a public place,
where such noise can
be a public nuisance
and personal
embarrassment.”
Guess who’s a
member of the
Coalition? I’ll give you a clue: it starts
with an ‘F’ and ends in ‘acebook’.
Autoplaying noisy videos is a feature
literally nobody asked for – except the
advertisers themselves. Facebook will
have studied the metrics and seen that
autoplaying videos have a far higher
‘engagement’ rate than those that
require the user to push a Play button.
Now you’ll have advertisers and other
video producers cramming the first few
seconds of their videos with shouty
audio to make sure they attract your
attention before your thumb flicks them
off the screen.
The only thing that prevented me from
uninstalling Facebook the moment this
feature was activated was that there’s
an option to switch it off. On Android,
open the menu in the top right-corner
of the Facebook app, scroll all the way
down to App Settings and make sure
‘Videos in News Feed start with sound’
is switched off. Autoplay videos haven’t
appeared in iOS yet, perhaps because
Apple doesn’t tolerate such nonsense.
Facebook is fast becoming the
anti-social network and this feature will
certainly cost it a few friends.
