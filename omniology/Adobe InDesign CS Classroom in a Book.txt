ADOBE INDESIGN CS 1
Classroom in a Book
Getting Started
Welcome to Adobe® InDesign® CS. InDesign is a powerful design and production tool 
that offers precision, control, and seamless integration with other Adobe professional 
graphics software. Using InDesign, you can produce professional-quality, full-color 
documents on high-volume color printing presses, or print to a wide range of output 
devices and formats, such as desktop printers, PDF ﬁ les, and HTML ﬁ les. 
Writers, artists, designers and publishers can communicate to a broader audience than 
ever before and through an unprecedented variety of media. The Adobe Network 
Publishing vision recognizes this with tools for creating visually rich content that is 
available anywhere, any time, and on any device. InDesign supports this view with its 
seamless integration with Adobe Photoshop®, Adobe Illustrator®, Adobe Acrobat®, and 
 Adobe GoLive®. The Adobe InDesign CS Classroom in a Book introduces and describes 
new features, workﬂ ows, and techniques that support this new wave of publishing.
About Classroom in a Book
Adobe InDesign CS Classroom in a Book® is part of the ofﬁ cial training series for Adobe 
graphics and publishing software from Adobe Systems, Inc. 
The lessons are designed so that you can learn at your own pace. If you’re new to Adobe 
InDesign, you’ll learn the fundamentals you’ll need to master to put the program to 
work. If you’ve already been using Adobe InDesign, you’ll ﬁ nd that Classroom in a Book 
teaches many advanced features, including tips and techniques for using this exciting 
design tool.
Each lesson provides step-by-step instructions for creating a speciﬁ c project. You can 
follow the book from start to ﬁ nish, or do only the lessons that meet your interests and 
needs. Each lesson concludes with a review section summarizing what you’ve covered.
Prerequisites
Before beginning to use Adobe InDesign CS Classroom in a Book, you should have a 
working knowledge of your computer and its operating system. Make sure you know 
how to use the mouse and standard menus and commands, and also how to open, 
save, and close ﬁ les. If you need to review these techniques, see the printed or online 
documentation included with your Windows or Mac OS documentation.

Getting Started
Installing the program
You must purchase the Adobe InDesign software separately. For complete instructions 
on installing the software, see the “How to Install” Readme ﬁ le in the application CD.
Installing the Classroom in a Book fonts
The Classroom in a Book lesson ﬁ les use the fonts that installed with Adobe InDesign CS. 
If it is necessary to reinstall these font ﬁ les, you can perform a custom installation from 
your Adobe InDesign software CD to reinstall only the fonts. See the “How to Install” 
Readme ﬁ le in the application CD.
Copying the Classroom in a Book ﬁ les 
The Classroom in a Book CD includes folders containing all the electronic ﬁ les for 
the lessons. Each lesson has its own folder. You must install these folders on your hard 
disk to use the ﬁ les for the lessons. To save room on your hard disk, you can install the 
folders for each lesson as you need them.
1 Insert the Adobe InDesign Classroom in a Book CD into your CD-ROM drive.
2 Create a folder on your hard disk and name it IDCIB.
3 Do one of the following:
• Copy the Lessons folder into the IDCIB folder.
• Copy only the single lesson folder you need.
Restoring default preferences
To ensure that the tools and palettes function exactly as described in this lesson, you 
must delete or deactivate (by renaming) the InDesign Defaults ﬁ le and the InDesign 
SavedData ﬁ le. 
The InDesign Defaults ﬁ le and the InDesign SavedData ﬁ le control how palettes and 
command settings appear on your screen when you open the Adobe InDesign program. 
Each time you exit Adobe InDesign, the position of the palettes and certain command 
settings are recorded in these ﬁ les. To ensure that the tools and palettes function exactly 
as described in this book, you can delete the current InDesign Defaults and InDesign 
SavedData ﬁ les at the beginning of each lesson. If they don’t already exist, Adobe 
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 3
Classroom in a Book
InDesign will create new versions of these ﬁ les the next time you start the program and 
save a ﬁ le.
To delete your preferences to reset to their original default values: 
1 Start Adobe InDesign.
2 Immediately select Control+Alt+Shift (Windows) or 
Control+Option+Command+Shift (Mac OS).
3 Click Yes to delete the InDesign preference ﬁ les.
Important: If you want to save the current settings, rename the defaults ﬁ les rather than 
deleting them. When you are ready to restore the settings, change the names back and make 
sure that the ﬁ les are located in the InDesign CS folder (Windows®) or the Preferences 
folder (Mac OS). If you rename the default ﬁ les, you will be able to revert to your default 
settings after completing your InDesign Classroom in a Book exercises.
1 If InDesign is running, choose File > Exit (Windows) or File > Quit (Mac OS).
2 To locate the InDesign defaults ﬁ les, do one of the following:
• (Windows) Double click to open your hard drive containing your operating system 
folder. Open the Documents and Settings folder and locate the folder for your user 
name that you created when you installed your computer. Open this folder and locate 
the Application Data folder and choose the Adobe Folder. Inside the Adobe folder locate 
the InDesign folder and open the Version 3 folder. The InDesign Defaults and InDesign 
SavedData ﬁ les are stored in this folder. You may need to set your operating system 
to show hidden ﬁ les to make them visible. To do this, Choose Tools > Folder Options 
and click the View tab then select the Show hidden ﬁ les and folders radio button. The 
complete path to locate these ﬁ les is typically c:\\Documents and Setttings\user name\
Application Data\Adobe\Indesign\Version 3.0. Rename these ﬁ les by adding the word 
“backup” to their names. Do not delete or change the name of any other InDesign ﬁ le.
• (Mac OS) Open the hard drive containing your operating system and locate your user 
folder that was created when you installed your operating system. Open this user folder 
and locate the Library folder. Inside the Library folder, open the Preferences folder and 
then locate the Adobe InDesign folder. Within the InDesign folder is the Version 3.0 
folder. The InDesign Defaults and InDesign SavedData ﬁ les are stored in this folder. 
Rename these ﬁ les by adding the word “backup” to their names. Do not delete or change 
the name of any other InDesign ﬁ le. The complete path to locate these ﬁ les is typically 
c:\\Users\user name\Library\Preferences\Adobe InDesign\Version 3.0.

Getting Started
 If you renamed the defaults ﬁ les to preserve them, you can return to your previous 
settings by ﬁ rst deleting the newest copies of the InDesign Defaults and InDesign SavedData 
ﬁ les. Then restore the original names of the ﬁ les you renamed in the steps above.

A Quick Tour of Adobe InDesign
Getting started
You’ll start the tour by opening a partially completed document. You’ll add the ﬁ nishing 
touches to this 6-page article on Mexican folk art written for an imaginary travel 
magazine. Before you start Adobe InDesign, you should restore the default preferences 
for InDesign if you have not already done so in this session. Restoring default 
preferences ensures that the tools and palettes function exactly as described in this 
lesson. After you learn how to use InDesign, this step is no longer necessary.
1 Delete or deactivate the InDesign Defaults ﬁ le and the InDesign SavedData ﬁ le, 
following the procedure in “Restoring default preferences” on page 2. 
2 Start Adobe InDesign.
3 Choose File > Open, and locate the ID_00 folder in the IDCIB folder you copied 
from the InDesign Classroom in a Book CD to your hard disk.
4 In the ID_00 folder, double-click ID_01.indd.
Note: Your extensions may be hidden based upon your computer system preferences. If this 
is so, the ﬁ le appears without the .indd added to its name. So it will appear as ID_01 (not 
ID_01.indd) in the Open a File dialog box. 
 
5 Choose File > Save As, and rename the ﬁ le Tour in the ID_00 folder.

Viewing the document
The ﬁ rst spread (pages 2 and 3) appears on your screen. You’ll now look at the rest 
of the 6-page article using several navigation methods. First, you’ll use the Navigator 
palette, which is useful for changing the view magniﬁ cation. As in Adobe InDesign and 
Adobe Photoshop, palettes are often grouped with other palettes. However, you can 
move, separate, and combine these palettes any way you like. A check mark indicates 
this view is selected. The Fit Spread in Window option displays all of the adjoining pages 
in a spread.
1 Choose View > Fit Spread in Window.
2 Choose Window > Navigator to have the palette appear on your screen.
3 Position the pointer and click on the palette-menu button (
) on the right side of 
the palette window, and choose View All Spreads from the Navigator palette menu. If 
you can’t see the three spreads well, drag the lower right corner of the palette down to 
resize it.
Like many palettes, the Navigator palette has a 
menu that displays additional options.
Notice that the red view box in the Navigator palette determines which area of the 
document is displayed.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

A Quick Tour of Adobe InDesign
4 In the Navigator palette, click the center of the middle spread to view pages 4 and 5. 
If necessary, drag the red box so that you can see pages 4 and 5.
5 Choose View > Fit Page in Window. You can see how the magniﬁ cation displayed in 
the Navigator palette is automatically updated.
Now we’ll look at the Pages palette, which is another useful tool for turning pages. You’ll 
be using the Pages palette throughout this tour, so you’ll separate the Pages palette from 
the other two palettes.
6 Click the Pages palette tab, and then drag the Pages tab away from the other palettes.
 Feel free to move and rearrange palettes in this Quick Tour as needed. You can move a 
palette by dragging its title bar. You can place a palette in the docking area on the right side 
of the document window by dragging a palette by its tab, to this portion of the window. You 
can also click the minimize button or close button on the top bar.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 9
Classroom in a Book
When you need to use the palette again, click the palette name if it is in the docking area 
or use the restore button or choose the appropriate menu command (such as Window > 
Pages to display the Pages palette).
7 In the Pages palette, double-click the numbers 6-7 below the page icons to view the 
last spread in the document.
Double-clicking the numbers below the page icons centers the full spread in the 
document window. Double-clicking a page icon centers the page in the document 
window.
Now that you’ve seen all three spreads, let’s go back to page 3 and start working.
8 In the Pages palette, double-click the page 3 icon to move to page 3.

Turning on guides
In this document, the guides are hidden. You’ll turn on the guides to make it easy to see 
your layout grid and snap objects into place. The guides do not print and do not limit 
the print area. They are for your reference only.
• Choose View > Show Guides.
Before and after turning on guides.
Adding text
You can import text created in separate word processing programs or create text using 
InDesign. In this exercise you are going to add a secondary headline to page 3.
1 Using the Type tool ( ) click and drag to create a box for this headline between the 
two guides below the word Mexico in the right column of the page.
If the text box is not aligned exactly to the size of the guides, use the Selection tool ( ) 
to click on the corners of the box and enlarge or reduce them as necessary.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 11

2 Enter the text “Exploring Mexican Folk Art” in the text box.
InDesign placed the text insertion point in the frame after it was created because it was 
built using the Type tool. For frames created with other tools, you will ﬁ rst need to click 
within the frame before entering text.
3 Select the frame with the Selection tool ( ).
4 Choose Type > Character.
5 Select the font Adobe Garamond Pro Regular and the size of 18 points in the 
Character Palette.
 You can apply attributes to all the text within a box by selecting the box.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

12
A Quick Tour of Adobe InDesign
Threading text in frames
As a general rule, text is placed inside frames with InDesign. You can either add text to a 
frame that has already been created, or you can create the frame while you import text.
Placing and ﬂ owing text
An article describing Judith and Clyde’s trip to Oaxaca has been saved in a word-
processor ﬁ le. You’ll place this ﬁ le on page 3 and then thread it throughout your 
document.
1 Make sure that no objects are selected, and then choose File > Place. In the Place 
dialog box, go to the ID_00 folder in the Lessons folder and double-click the 01_a.doc 
ﬁ le.
The pointer takes the shape of a loaded text icon (
). With a loaded text icon, you have 
several choices: You can drag to create a text frame, click inside an existing frame, or 
click to create a frame within a column. You’ll add this text to a column in the lower half 
of page 3.
2 Position the loaded text icon just below the fourth guide from the bottom margin 
and just to the right of the left margin, and click.
3 The text ﬂ ows into a new frame in the lower half of the ﬁ rst column on page 3. When 
a text frame has more text than can ﬁ t, the frame is said to have overset text. Overset 
text is indicated by a red plus symbol in the out port of the frame (the small square just 
above the lower right corner of the frame). You can link overset text to another frame or 
create a new frame into which the overset text will ﬂ ow, or expand the size of the frame.
 If the text box is not placed in the left column, click the Selection tool ( ) and drag the 
sizing handles to move it to the proper location.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 13
Classroom in a Book
4 Click the out port in the selected frame.
5 The pointer becomes a loaded text icon. Now you’ll add a column of text to the lower 
half of the second column.
6 Position the loaded text icon just below the fourth guide from the bottom margin 
and just to the right of the second column guide, and click. Text now ﬁ lls the lower part 
of the right column.
 You can also set the number of columns in a single text box by selecting the box and 
setting the number of columns for the box in the control palette. This allows you to create 
multiple columns of type without ﬂ owing text.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

14
A Quick Tour of Adobe InDesign
Threading text
Clicking the out port to ﬂ ow text is called manual threading. 
1 Click the out port in the second column (on page 3). 
This prepares InDesign to ﬂ ow the overset text from this text frame to another frame.
2 In the Pages palette, double-click the page 4 icon to center page 4 in the document 
window.
3 Holding down Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS), position the loaded text icon in 
the upper left corner of the ﬁ rst column, and click. Release the Alt/Option key.
Note: After clicking on the out port, you can hold down Shift to thread text automatically 
so that all the overset text is ﬂ owed into the columns through a document. But you don’t 
want to do that in this document because the text frames should not appear on every page. 
Alternatively, you can hold down Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) to thread text one 
frame at a time without having to click the out port in each frame with overset text.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 15
Classroom in a Book
The text ﬂ ows into the left column. Because you held down Alt/Option, the pointer is 
still a loaded text icon and you do not need to click in the out port before ﬂ owing text 
from this frame.
4 Position the loaded text icon in the upper left corner of the second column on page 
4, and click.
 Whenever the pointer is a loaded text icon, you can click any tool in the toolbox to cancel 
the operation. No text will be lost but any overset text will still need to be linked to another 
box or edited.
Now you’ll ﬂ ow the text into the bottom of the two columns on page 7.
5 Click the out port in the second column of page 4, and then double-click the page 7 
icon in the Pages palette to center page 7 in the document window.
6 Holding down Alt/Option, position the loaded text icon in the left column below the 
guide on page 7, and click. Release the Alt/Option key.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

16
A Quick Tour of Adobe InDesign
7 Position the loaded text icon in the second column below the guide, and click.
You have just ﬁ nished threading text frames. A threaded set of frames is called a story.
8 Choose File > Save.
Adding a pull quote
To enhance the design on page 4 of your document, you’ll add a pull quote. We copied 
text from the article and placed it into a frame on the pasteboard which is the area 
outside of the page. You will position this pull-quote text frame in the middle of page 4 
and ﬁ nish formatting it.
1 Choose View > Fit Page in Window. Then choose File > Save.
2 In the lower left corner of the document window, select page 4 from the list of 
available pages. If you cannot see the pull-quote text frame to the left of page 4, locate 
the scroll box on the horizontal scroll bar and drag it to the left.
3 Using the Selection tool ( ), select the text frame on the pasteboard that contains the 
quote.
4 Click in the Control palette located just below the menus at the top of the page, 
entering an X value of 4 in and a Y offset of 3 in. 
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 17
Classroom in a Book
The pull quote should now be centered between the columns of text on page 4. If 
necessary, use the arrow keys to nudge the frames location. The bottom of the frame 
should pass through the middle of the red star.
 It is important to include the “in” after each number to identify the units of 
measurement being used (inches). With Adobe InDesign you can use most forms of 
measurement throughout the program, including palettes and dialog boxes, as long as you 
identify them with standard abbreviations, such as pt for point or cm for centimeter.
Wrapping text around an object
The text in the pull quote is difﬁ cult to read because the main story text does not wrap 
around the text frame. You’ll wrap the main story text around the edges of the pull-
quote text frame.
1 Make sure the pull-quote frame is selected. 
2 Choose Window > Type & Tables > Text Wrap.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

18
A Quick Tour of Adobe InDesign
3 In the Text Wrap palette, click the third wrap option (
) to wrap text around the 
object’s shape.
4 Click the Close button to close the Text Wrap palette.
5 Choose File > Save.
Adding a stroke to the frame
Now you’ll change the color of the text frame so that the stroke (border) matches the 
color of the red star. When you apply colors in InDesign, it’s a good idea to use the 
Swatches palette instead of the Colors palette. Using the Swatches palette to name colors 
makes it easy to apply, edit, and update colors efﬁ ciently for all objects in a document.
This magazine article is intended for printing at a commercial press, so it uses CMYK 
process colors. We’ve already added the set of necessary colors to the Swatches palette.
1 Choose Window > Swatches. 
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 19
Classroom in a Book
2 With the text frame still selected, click the Stroke box (
) in the top of the Swatches 
palette and then select PANTONE Warm Red CVC in the Swatches palette. Selecting the 
Stroke box will allow the frame of the image to be affected by the color you select.
3 To change the weight of the stroke, right-click on the frame (Windows) or Ctrl+click 
on the frame (Mac OS) and select Stroke Weight > 0.5 pt. The context menus are an 
easy way to change many attributes of a selected object, including the stroke weight.
4 Choose Edit > Deselect All.
The text frame now has a thin red stroke.
Choose File > Save.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

20
A Quick Tour of Adobe InDesign
Changing the frame and text position
The text in the pull-quote frame is too close to the edge, making it unattractive and 
difﬁ cult to read. You’ll now change the position of the text within the frame and change 
the type of frame style.
1 Using the Selection tool ( ), click the pull-quote text frame to select it, and then 
choose the Align center option from the Control palette.
2 With the frame still selected, choose the Thick-Thin stroke type from the control 
palette.
3 Use the control palette to increase the stroke weight to 4 pt. 
You can also use the control palette to easily adjust important attributes for objects on 
your page.

Adjusting the size of an image
Next we will adjust the size of the picture of the moon on the adjacent page.
1 If necessary, select page 5 in the lower left hand corner of the document window to 
move to this page.
2 Using the Selection tool ( ) select the picture of the moon.
3 Using the Control palette choose 50% from the X Scale %, which is the top of the 
two scaling values in the Control palette.
Both the vertical and horizontal sizes adjust proportionally. This is because the 
Constrain proportions for scaling button is selected to the right of the scaling 
percentages. You can deselect this button if you wish to adjust one value independent of 
the other. As a general rule, bitmap images such as those scanned or taken with a digital 
camera, should not be scaled disproportionately and should not be scaled beyond 120% 
of their original size due to the possible loss of quality. In this case, we were reducing the 
size of the image, which generally has no adverse impact on its quality.

Working with styles
InDesign includes two kinds of styles: paragraph and character. A paragraph style 
includes formatting attributes that apply to all text within a paragraph. You do not need 
to select text to apply a paragraph style, as it applies to all text in the paragraph where 
your cursor is located. A character style includes only character attributes, making it 
useful for formatting words and phrases within a paragraph. Text must be selected to 
apply a character style.
Applying paragraph styles
To save time, we created paragraph styles that you’ll apply to the text. These styles will 
help you format the body text in the article.
1 In the Pages palette, double-click the page 3 icon to center page 3 in the document 
window.
2 Select the Type tool ( ), and then click anywhere in the columns of text that you 
previously placed on this page.
3 Choose Edit > Select All to select the text in all the frames of the story.
4 Choose Type > Paragraph Styles to display the Paragraph Styles palette.

5 In the Paragraph Styles palette, click Body Text to format the entire story with the 
Body Text style.
6 Choose Edit > Deselect All to deselect the text.
Now you’ll apply a different paragraph style to the ﬁ rst paragraph of the story.
7 Using the Type tool ( ), click anywhere in the ﬁ rst paragraph on page 3.
8 In the Paragraph Styles palette, select Body Text / Drop Cap.
Like other options in the Paragraph and Character palettes, drop caps can be part of a 
style.

9 Choose File > Save.
Formatting text for the character style
Now you’ll create and apply a character style to emphasize page references within 
paragraphs. Before you create this character style, you’ll use the Character palette to 
italicize the text and make it one point smaller. You’ll then base the character style on 
this formatted text.
1 In the Pages palette, double-click the page 7 icon to center page 7 in the document 
window. To make sure that you can read the text at the bottom of this page, press 
Ctrl+= (Windows) or Command+= (Mac OS) and use the scroll bars as necessary.
You should be able to see three references to other pages: (page 7), (page 2), and 
(page 5).
2 Using the Type tool ( ), select the “(page 7)” reference.

Working with graphics
Graphics used in an InDesign document are placed inside of frames. When working 
with placed graphics, you should become familiar with the two Selection tools.
The Selection tool ( ) is used for general layout tasks, such as positioning and moving 
objects on a page. The Direct Selection tool ( ) is used for tasks involving the content 
of the frame or drawing and editing paths; for example, to select frame contents or to 
move an anchor point on a path. The Direct Selection tool is also used for selecting 
objects within groups.
Note: While learning about the difference between frames and their content, you may want 
to make frame edges visible by selecting View > Show Frame edges.
Positioning graphics within a frame
Two of the pictures on the ﬁ rst spread need to have their frames resized or the pictures 
within them repositioned.
1 Select page 2 in the lower left corner of the document window to navigate to page 2.
2 Using the Direct Selection tool ( ) click and hold on the picture of the sun. Drag the 
picture to the center of the frame so that the entire sun is visible.
With the Direct Selection tool you can reposition graphics within their frame.
3 Using the Selection tool ( ) click on the picture of the blue hand.

Working with grouped objects
The three stars on page 5 are grouped together. You’ll select the rightmost star so that 
you can change its color.
1 In the Pages palette, double-click the page 5 icon to center page 5 in the document 
window. Choose View > Fit Page in Window.
2 Using the Selection tool ( ), click the black star on page 5 to select it.
Notice that the star is part of a group. Instead of having to ungroup the objects to select 
only the black star, you can use the Direct Selection tool ( ) to select the object within a 
group.

5 Choose File > Save.
Targeting layers when placing
Like Illustrator and Photoshop, InDesign lets you place objects on different layers. 
Think of layers as sheets of transparent ﬁ lm that are stacked on top of each other. By 
using layers, you can create and edit objects on one layer without affecting—or being 
affected by—objects on other layers. Layers also determine the stacking position of 
objects.
Before you place a photograph of an armadillo, you’ll make sure that you add the frame 
to the appropriate layer.

1 In the Pages palette, double-click the page 3 icon to center page 3 in the document 
window.
2 Choose Window > Layers to display the Layers palette.
3 Click the word “Photos” in the Layers palette to target the Photos layer. (Do not click 
the boxes to the left of the Photos layer, or you’ll hide or lock the layer.)
4 Select the Selection tool ( ).
5 Choose File > Place, and double-click the 01_b.tif ﬁ le located in the ID_00 folder.
6 With the loaded graphics icon (
), click in the white area above the top margin to 
place the armadillo at the top of the page. You’ll move the graphic later, after you rotate 
and crop it.
Notice that the armadillo frame is the same color as the Photos layer in the Layers 
palette. An object’s frame color tells you which layer it belongs to.

A Quick Tour of Adobe InDesign
7 In the Layers palette, click the box next to the Text layer name so that the lock icon 
(
) appears.
Locking this layer prevents you from selecting or making any changes to the Text 
layer or any objects on that layer. With the Text layer locked, you can edit the frame 
containing the armadillo without accidentally selecting the frame containing “Hecho en 
Mexico.”
Cropping and moving the photograph
You’ll now use the Selection tool to crop and move the photograph.
1 Choose Edit > Deselect All. 
2 Select the Selection tool ( ) in the toolbox, and then click the armadillo.
3 Position the pointer over the middle handle on the right side of the armadillo frame 
and hold down the mouse button. Drag the frame toward the center of the armadillo to 
crop it.

Getting to Know the Work Area
LESSON 1
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Work with tools, document windows, the pasteboard, and palettes.
• Change the magniﬁ cation of the document.
• Navigate through a document.
• Work with layers.
• Manage palettes and save your workspace.
• Use context menus and online help.
• Use Adobe online services.
Note: This lesson covers tasks that are common to Adobe products such as Photoshop®, 
Illustrator®, and Acrobat®. If you are familiar with these Adobe products, you may want to 
skim through this lesson and move ahead to the next lesson.
Getting started
In this lesson, you’ll practice using the work area and navigating through pages of the 
Exploring the Library booklet. This is the ﬁ nal version of the document—you won’t 
be changing or adding text or graphics, only checking to make sure everything is ready 
for print. Before you begin, you’ll need to restore the default preferences for Adobe 
InDesign. 
1 To ensure that the tools and palettes function exactly as described in this lesson, 
delete or deactivate (by renaming) the InDesign Defaults ﬁ le and the InDesign 
SavedData ﬁ le. See “Restoring default preferences” on page 2.
2 Start Adobe InDesign.
To begin working, you’ll open an existing InDesign document.
Note: If you have not already copied the resource ﬁ les for this lesson onto your hard disk 
from the ID_01 folder from the Adobe InDesign CS Classroom in a Book CD, do so now. 
See “Copying the Classroom in a Book ﬁ les” on page 2
3 Choose File > Open, and open the 01_a.indd ﬁ le in the ID_01 folder, located inside 
the Lessons folder within the IDCIB folder on your hard disk. If an alert message 
appears that asks which dictionary ﬁ le you want to use, click No (Windows) or 
Document (Mac OS).

4  Choose File > Save As, rename the ﬁ le 01_Library.indd, and save it in the ID_01 
folder.
Note: This document was saved with the frame edges hidden (View > Hide Frame Edges). 
By default, frame edges are visible in all documents.
Looking at the work area
The InDesign work area encompasses everything you see when you ﬁ rst open or create a 
document: the toolbox, document window, pasteboard, and palettes. You can customize 
and save the work area to suit your work style. For example, you can display only the 
palettes you frequently use, minimize and rearrange palette groups, resize windows, add 
additional document windows, and so on.

 You can select a tool by either clicking the tool in the toolbox or pressing the tool’s 
keyboard shortcut. Because the default keyboard shortcuts only work when you do not 
have a text insertion point, you can add an additional key command. To do this, use the 
Keyboard Shortcuts command which is covered in the next chapter and in Adobe InDesign 
online Help.
2 Position the pointer over the Pen tool and hold down the mouse button—additional 
Pen tools appear. Drag to the right and release the mouse button over one of the 
additional tools to select it. Any tool that displays a small black triangle at the bottom 
right corner contains additional tools. 
3 Select the Selection tool ( ) again; then click the edge of the little cloud in the top left 
corner of page 1 to select it. 
Now you’ll use the color controls, which are located on the bottom half of the toolbox.

LESSON 1
Document window
The document window contains your document pages. You can have more than one 
document window open at a time. Here, you’ll open a second window so that as you 
work you can see two different views of the document at the same time. 
1 Choose Window > Arrange > New Window. A new window titled 01_Library.indd:2 
opens. Notice that the original window is now titled 01_Library.indd.1.
2 To view both windows simultaneously, choose Window > Arrange > Tile. 
3 Now select the Zoom tool in the toolbox (
) and click twice on the dinosaur in the 
rightmost document window. Notice that the original document window remains at the 
original magniﬁ cation. This arrangement lets you work closely on details and see the 
overall results on the rest of the page.
4 Close the 01_Library.indd:2 document window, by clicking the close window 
button at the top of the document window. Windows users, be careful not to close the 
program, as the close window and close program buttons are located adjacent to each

other. Be sure to only close the second document window. Then resize and reposition 
the remaining window by clicking the Maximize button on the top of your document 
window. 
 The Maximize (Windows) button is in the middle box in the upper right corner of any 
window. In Mac OS, this is the green button in the upper left corner of the window.
Pasteboard
Each page or spread in your document has its own pasteboard surrounding it, 
where you can store objects relating to your document as you create your layout. 
The pasteboard also provides additional space along the edges of the document for 
extending objects past the page edge. Extending objects past the edge of a page is called 
a bleed, and is used when an object must print entirely to the edge of a page.
1 To see the full size of the pasteboard for the pages in this document, choose View > 
Entire Pasteboard.
Note: If you cannot see the graphic of a book on the pasteboard, it may be hidden behind 
one of the palettes. Move the palettes or reduce the size of the document window so that you 
can see all these objects.

LESSON 1
Notice the book graphic on the pasteboard for page 1. This graphic was originally 
placed in the document, but then moved to the pasteboard in anticipation that it would 
be used somewhere else in the document. It is no longer necessary to keep this image 
with the document.
2 Using the Selection tool ( ), select the book image on the pasteboard and press 
Delete.
3 Choose View > Fit Page in Window to restore the window to its previous size.
4 Choose File > Save.
 Use the pasteboard as an extension of your working area. You can import multiple 
placed images or text ﬁ les and hold them on the pasteboard until you are ready to use them.
Viewing and arranging palettes
Palettes provide quick access to commonly used tools and features in InDesign. By 
default, palettes appear in stacked groups, which you can reorganize in various ways. 
Here you’ll experiment with hiding, closing, and opening palettes.
1 Choose Window > Workspace > Default to reset the palettes to their original 
location.
2 Click the Layers palette tab to make this palette appear or choose Window > Layers.
 To ﬁ nd a hidden palette, choose the palette name on the Window menu. If the palette 
name already has a check mark, then the palette is already open and in front of any other 
palettes in its palette group. If you choose a checked palette name on the Window menu, the 
palette will close.
Now you’ll reorganize the palette group.

LESSON 1
Docking palettes
Dock palettes by connecting the lower edge of one palette to the top edge of another palette, so that both 
palettes move together and are shown and hidden together. When you dock palettes, both palettes remain 
fully visible. In contrast, when you group palettes, only the frontmost palette is visible.
You can dock one palette to another single palette or to a group of palettes. However, you can’t dock a group 
of palettes unless you dock each of them individually, because docking involves dragging an individual 
palette’s tab and not the title bar.
–From Adobe InDesign CS online Help.
To dock palettes, drag a palette’s tab to the bottom edge of another palette. 
When the bottom edge of the other palette is highlighted, release the mouse.
4 If the Paragraph palette is not visible, open it by selecting Type > Paragraph. Then 
drag the Layers palette tab into the center of the Paragraph palette group. Then drag the 
tab back to the Pages palette group.
Note: To add a palette to a group, make sure you drag its tab into the middle of the palette. 
If you drag a palette tab to the bottom of another palette, you will dock the palette instead 
of adding it. See the “Docking palettes” sidebar above.
Now you’ll organize the palettes to create more space in your work area. 
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 51
Classroom in a Book
5 After dragging a palette from the docking area, you can double-click the tab 
containing the name of the palette to reduce the size of the palette. Double-click the tab 
again to minimize the palette.
Note: You can double-click a third time to return to the full size view of the palette. These 
clicking options work only after the palette has been pulled out from the docking area.
Customizing your workspace
You can save the position of palettes and easily open a group of related palettes by 
creating a workspace. Next we will create a workspace that brings up a group of 
commonly used palettes.
1 Select Window > Pages then select Window > Navigator and also select Window > 
Transform.
2 Position the three palettes so they are all visible on the side of the screen.
3 Select Window > Workspace > Save Workspace and name the workspace Navigation.
4 Switch to the default palette layout by selecting Window > Workspace > Default. 
Note that the palettes return to their default positions. Toggle between the two 
workspaces using the Window > Workspace command and selecting the workspace 
you wish to use but switch back to the Default Workspace before going on to the next 
exercise.
Using palette menus
Most palettes have a palette-menu button in the upper right corner of the palette 
window when the palette is not collapsed into the side window. This menu appears in 
the upper left corner of a docked palette. Clicking this arrow-shaped button opens a 
menu with additional commands and options for the selected palette. You can use this 
to change options for the palette display or access additional commands relating to the

palette. Next we will change the display of one of the palettes used to create and save 
color, called the Swatches palette.
1 Click the Swatches palette tab in the docking area on the right side of the window. 
You can also choose Window > Swatches to display this palette. Drag the palette to the 
left, separating it from the docking area. Note that the palette menu has moved to the 
upper right corner of the palette. The palette menu changes position if a palette is in the 
docking area or if it is on the page in its own window.
2 Position the pointer on the palette-menu button in the upper right corner of the 
Swatches palette, and click the mouse button to display the palette menu. 
3 Choose Small Name. This command affects the Swatches palette rows, but not the 
other paletts visible on the screen. The commands in the palette menu apply only to the 
active palette.
4 On the Swatches palette menu, choose Name to return the swatches names to their 
original size.

Changing the magniﬁ cation of your document
You can reduce or enlarge the view of the document to any magniﬁ cation level from 5% 
to 4000%. When you are viewing a document, InDesign displays the percentage of the 
document’s actual size in the lower left corner of the document window and also at the 
top of the document in the title bar of the window, next to the ﬁ lename.
Using the view commands and magniﬁ cation menu
You can easily enlarge or reduce the view of a document by doing one of the following: 
• Choose a percentage from the magniﬁ cation menu at the lower left corner of the 
document window to enlarge or reduce the display by any preset increment.
• Type a percentage in the magniﬁ cation menu by positioning your cursor over this area 
and clicking to obtain an insertion point, entering the desired viewing percent and then 
using the return key to enter the value.
• Choose View > Zoom In to enlarge the display by one preset increment.
• Choose View > Zoom Out to reduce the display by one preset increment. 
Note: Preset sizes are those listed in the magniﬁ cation menu.
• Choose View > Actual Size to display the document at 100%. (Depending on the 
dimensions of your document and your screen resolution, you may or may not see the 
entire document on-screen.) 
•  Choose View > Fit Page in Window to display the targeted page in the window.
• Choose View > Fit Spread in Window to display the targeted spread in the window.

LESSON 1
Using the Zoom tool
In addition to the view commands, you can use the Zoom tool to magnify and reduce 
the view of a document. 
1 Select the Zoom tool (
) in the toolbox and position it over the dinosaur on page 1. 
Notice that a plus sign appears in the center of the Zoom tool (
).
2 Click once. The view changes to the next preset magniﬁ cation, centered on the point 
where you clicked. Now you’ll reduce the view. 
3 Position the Zoom tool pointer over the dinosaur and hold down Alt (Windows) or 
Option (Mac OS). A minus sign appears in the center of the Zoom tool (
). 
4 With Alt/Option still held down, click twice over the dinosaur; the view is reduced. 
You can also use the Zoom tool to drag a marquee around a portion of a document to 
magnify a speciﬁ c area.
5 With the Zoom tool still selected, hold down the mouse button and drag a marquee 
around the dinosaur; then release the mouse.
The percentage by which the area is magniﬁ ed depends on the size of the marquee: the 
smaller the marquee, the larger the degree of magniﬁ cation. 
Dragging a marquee with the Zoom tool (left) and the resulting view (right).
6 In the toolbox, double-click the icon for the Zoom tool to return to a 100% view. 
Because the Zoom tool is used frequently during the editing process to enlarge and 
reduce the view of your document, you can temporarily select it from the keyboard at 
any time without deselecting any other tool you may be using. You’ll do that now.

Navigating through your document
InDesign provides several options for viewing and navigating through a document, 
including the Pages and Navigator palettes, and the scroll bars. 
Turning pages 
You can turn pages using the Pages palette, the page buttons at the bottom of the 
document window, the scroll bars, or a variety of commands. 
The Pages palette provides page icons for all the pages in your document. Double-
clicking on any page icon or page number brings that page or spread into view.

Targeting and selecting spreads or pages
You can target or select spreads, depending on the task at hand:
• Target a spread where the next new object should appear. This is helpful when, for example, several 
spreads are visible in the document window and you want to paste an object on a speciﬁ c spread. Only 
one spread can be the target at any time. By default, the target spread occupies the center of the document 
window. It is indicated by the highlighted page numbers (not highlighted page icons) in the Pages palette.
• Select a page or spread when your next action will affect a page or spread rather than objects, as 
when you’re setting margin and column options for a speciﬁ c page only. When all pages of a spread are 
highlighted in the Pages palette, that spread is selected. You can select multiple spreads in a document. 
The selected spread is indicated by the highlighted page icons (not highlighted page numbers) in the Pages 
palette.

You can also use the Hand tool, or the scroll bars along the side of the document 
window, to move to different areas or pages of a document. Here you’ll use both 
methods to navigate through the document.
1 Drag the scrollbar along the right side of the document window all the way to the 
top to view page 1. If necessary, drag the horizontal scroll bar across the bottom of the 
window until you can see page 1.
2 With the Selection tool ( ) selected in the toolbox and the pointer positioned over 
the document, hold down the spacebar on the keyboard. Notice that the Selection tool 
icon changes to the Hand tool (
). You can use this shortcut when you don’t want to 
change tools while moving through the document. You can also select the Hand tool 
(
) in the toolbox.

LESSON 1
Working with  layers
By default, a new document contains just one layer (named Layer 1). You can rename 
the layer and add more layers at any time as you create your document. Placing objects 
on different layers lets you organize them for easy selection and editing. Using the 
Layers palette, you can select, display, edit, and print different layers individually, in 
groups, or all together. 
What are layers?
Think of layers as transparent sheets of ﬁ lm stacked on top of each other. If a layer doesn’t have objects on 
it, you can see through it to any objects on the layers behind it.
–From Adobe InDesign CS online Help.
The 01_Library.indd document has four layers. You’ll experiment with these layers to 
learn how the order of the layers and the placement of objects on layers can greatly 
affect the design of your document.
1 Click the Layers palette tab to activate the palette, or choose Window > Layers.
2 In the Layers palette, click the Number layer. Notice that a pen icon ( ) appears to 
the right of the layer name. This icon indicates that this layer is the target layer and 
anything you import or create will belong to this layer. The highlight indicates that the 
layer is selected.

3 Position the pointer in the Layers palette then click and drag the Number layer 
between the Floor layer and the Graphics layer. When you see a black line appearing 
where you would like to move the layer, release the mouse. Notice how the objects 
now appear in a different stacking order in your document, as some objects are now 
positioned on top of others.
4 Click the empty square to the left of the Number layer name. This square lets you 
lock a layer so it cannot be edited. When you lock a layer, the palette displays a crossed-
out pencil icon (
) in the square. 
5 Using the Selection tool ( ), click the word “Floor” in the document window. Notice 
in the Layers palette that the Graphics layer is selected and a dot appears to the right 
of the layer name. This indicates that the selected object belongs to this layer. You can

move objects from one layer to another layer by dragging this dot between the layers in 
the palette.
6 In the Layers palette, drag the dot from the Graphics layer to the Floor layer. The 
word “Floor” now belongs to the Floor layer and appears in the stacking order in the 
document accordingly.
7 Now that you’re done editing the layers, you can click the crossed-out pencil icon for 
the Number layer to unlock this layer.
8 Save the ﬁ le.
Using context menus
In addition to the menus at the top of your screen, you can use context-sensitive menus 
to display commands relevant to the active tool or selection. 
To display context-sensitive menus, position the pointer over an object or anywhere 
in the document window, and click with the right mouse button (Windows) or press 
Control and hold down the mouse button (Mac OS). 
1 Make sure that the word “Floor” is still selected.

2 With the Selection tool ( ), right-click (Windows) or Ctrl-click (Mac OS) the word 
“Floor.” Options for the text under the tool are displayed in the context-sensitive menu. 
These same options are also in the Object menu. Being careful not to select any of the 
commands on the context menu, click a blank area of the page to close the menu.
3 Click in the pasteboard area to deselect all objects, then right-click (Windows) 
or Ctrl-click (Mac OS) the pasteboard. Notice that the options listed on the context 
menu have changed so that they relate to the area of the page where you right-click or 
Ctrl-click.

LESSON 1
Selecting Objects
InDesign lets you know which objects will be selected when you move your Selection 
tool over an object by highlighting the object frame. You can then use commands to 
help select objects that are placed behind other items on your page.
1 Choose the Selection tool ( ). If necessary, navigate to page 2.
2 Move the cursor over various blocks of text and graphics on the page and notice how 
the cursor changes to include a point ( ) as the cursor passes over them. This signals 
that an object will be selected if you click.
3 Click between the two o’s in the word Floor where it overlaps the number 1. The text 
box containing the word Floor is selected.
4  Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) and choose Select > Next object 
below. Repeat this process until you have cycled through the three separate objects. You 
can also hold down your Ctrl key (Windows) or Command key (Mac OS) and click to 
cycle through stacked objects.
Using  online Help
You can use online Help to ﬁ nd in-depth information about Adobe InDesign CS. 
InDesign online Help appears in a browser window. If you do not have a  browser 
installed on your machine, you can use an Adobe Acrobat® version of Help that is 
included on your InDesign application CD. Adobe Reader® is also included on the 
application CD.

2 Setting Up Your Document
By taking advantage of the tools that 
help you set up your document, you 
can ensure a consistent page layout and 
simplify your work. In this lesson, you’ll 
learn how to create master pages and set 
columns and guides.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

Setting Up Your Document
LESSON 2
In this introduction to setting up your document, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Start a new document.
• Create, edit and apply master pages. 
• Set document defaults. 
• Adjust pasteboard size and bleed area. 
• Add sections to change page numbering. 
• Override master-page items on document pages.
• Add graphics and text to document pages.
Getting started
In this lesson, you’ll set up a 12-page magazine article about origami, and then you 
will place text and graphics on one of the spreads. Before you begin, you’ll need to 
restore the default preferences for Adobe InDesign, to ensure that the tools and palettes 
function exactly as described in this lesson. Then you’ll open the ﬁ nished document for 
this lesson to see what you’ll be creating.
Note: If you have not already copied the resource ﬁ les for this lesson onto your hard disk 
from the ID_02 folder from the Adobe InDesign CS Classroom in a Book CD, do so now. See 
“Copying the Classroom in a Book ﬁ les” on page 2.
1 Delete or deactivate (by renaming) the InDesign Defaults ﬁ le and the InDesign 
SavedData ﬁ le. See “Restoring default preferences” on page 2. 
2 Start Adobe InDesign.

3 To see what the ﬁ nished document will look like, open the 02_b.indd ﬁ le in the 
ID_02 folder, located inside the Lessons folder within the IDCIB folder on your hard 
disk. You can leave this document open to act as a guide as you work.
The document window shows several spreads, including pages 2–3, which is the only 
spread that you’ll complete in this lesson. You can refer to this document throughout 
this lesson.
Note: As you work, feel free to move palettes or change the magniﬁ cation to meet your 
needs. See “Changing the magniﬁ cation of your document” on page 53.
Creating and saving a custom page size
InDesign lets you save your common page defaults, including page size, number of 
pages and margins. This lets you quickly build new documents using a saved document 
size.
1  Choose File > Document Presets and click Deﬁ ne.
2 Click New in the Document Presets dialog box that follows.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

76
Setting Up Your Document
LESSON 2
3 In the New Document Preset dialog box, set the following: 
• For Document Preset Name, type Magazine. 
• For Number of Pages, type 12. 
• Make sure that the Facing Pages option is selected. 
• For Width, type 50p3 (the abbreviation for 50 picas and 3 points). 
• For Height, type 65p3. 
• Under Columns, type 5 for Number.
• Under Margins, type 4 for Bottom and leave the Top, Inside, and Outside margins at 3 
picas (3p0). 
4  Click More Options, which will expand the dialog box and enter .25 in for the Bleed 
on all four sides of the document. 
This creates an area outside the page that will print and is used when you have items 
that extend off the page area, such as a picture or a colored background on a page.
 You can use any form of measurement in any dialog box or palette. If you are using a 
value other than the default form of measurement, simply type the indicator for the unit 
you want to use, such as p for picas, pt for points, and either in or ” (quotation marks) for 
inches. After you type a value, either press Tab, or click another option, the measurement is 
automatically converted to the default unit of measurement which is set in your preferences. 
5 Click OK in both dialog boxes to save the document preset.

Starting a new document
When you ﬁ rst start a new document, the Document Setup dialog box appears. You 
can use a document preset to build the document or use this dialog box to specify the 
number of pages, the page size, and the number of columns. You’ll use the magazine 
preset that you just created.
1 Choose File > New > Document.
2 In the New Document dialog box, select the Magazine document preset.
3 Click OK.
4 Open the Pages palette by selecting Window > Pages, if it is not already open.
The document window appears, displaying page 1, as indicated in the Pages palette. The 
Pages palette is divided into two sections. The top section displays icons for the master 
pages. The bottom half displays icons for document pages in your document. In this 
document, the master consists of a two-page spread for facing pages.

Editing master pages
Before you add graphics and text frames to the document, you’ll set up the master 
pages. A master page is like a template that you can apply to pages in your document. 
Any object that you add to a master page will appear on document pages to which the 
master page is applied.
In this document, you’ll use three sets of master pages. One contains a grid, another 
contains footer information, and a third contains placeholder frames. By creating

Setting Up Your Document
LESSON 2
several types of master pages, you allow for variation of pages in a document while 
ensuring a consistent design.
Adding guides to the master
You’ll start by adding guides to the document. Guides are non-printing lines that help 
you lay out your design precisely. Guides that you place on master pages appear on any 
document pages to which the master is applied. For this document, you’ll add a series of 
guides that, along with the column guides, act as a grid to which you can snap graphics 
and text frames to place.
1 In the upper section of the Pages palette, double-click A-Master.
Double-clicking the name of the 
master page displays both pages 
of the A-Master.
The left and right master pages appear centered in the document window. 
2 Choose Layout > Create Guides. 
3 Under Rows, type 8 for Number, and type 0 for Gutter. 
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 79

4 For Fit Guides to, select Margins.
Selecting Margins instead of Page causes the guides to ﬁ t within the margin boundaries 
rather than the page boundaries. You won’t add column guides because column lines 
already appear in your document.
5 Select Preview to see how the horizontal guides will appear on your master pages.
6 Click OK.
 Grids can also be added to individual document pages using the same command.
Renaming the master page
You will rename this ﬁ rst master page “Grid.” In documents that contain several master 
pages, you may want to rename each master page to give them more descriptive names.
1 Click the palette-menu button (
) on the right of the Pages palette, and choose 
Master Options for “A-Master.” If your Pages palette is still docked in its default location 
to the right of your working area, the palette-menu button is located in the upper left 
hand corner of the Pages palette.
Note: If the Master Options for “A-Master” is dimmed on the Pages palette menu, double-
click A-Master again to make sure the master pages are open in the document window.

2 For Name, type Grid, and then click OK.
Note: In addition to changing the name of master pages, you can also use the Master 
Options dialog box to change other properties of existing master pages.
Creating a master for footers
The grid you added to the master is necessary for most of the pages in the document. 
In addition to the common grid, most document pages will require consistent text 
along their top (a header) or consistent text along their bottom (a footer). Some of 
these document pages will also require consistent placement of text and graphics. To 
accommodate these different designs, you’ll create a separate master for pages that 
require footers, and another master that contains placeholder frames for text and 
graphics.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 81

You can build each master page independently or you can base master pages on other 
master pages. In this document, the footer master will be based on the Grids master, and 
the Placeholder master will be based on the Footer master. By basing master pages on 
other masters, any change to the parent master will appear on the child masters.

A. Name of Master. B. The A’s indicate that 
the B-Master is based on the A-Master.
Dragging guides from rulers
Footers are often below the lower margin of the page, where there are no column guides. 
To position the footers accurately, you will add a horizontal ruler guide and two vertical 
ruler guides. This is easily done by dragging from the document rulers on the top and 
left sides of the window.
Note: You can create page ruler guides, which apply only to the page on which you drag, or 
a spread ruler guide, which applies across all pages in the spread and across the pasteboard. 
1 Make sure that the B-Footer master pages are still in view. The page box near the 
bottom left corner of the document window indicates which page is displayed.
2 If the Transform palette is not open, choose Window > Transform. 
3 Without clicking in your document, move the pointer around the document window 
and watch the horizontal and vertical rulers as the pointer moves. Notice how the 
hairline indicators in the rulers correspond to the pointer’s position. Also notice that 
the dimmed X and Y values in the Transform palette also indicate the position of the 
pointer.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 83

4 
Holding down Ctrl (Windows) or Command (Mac OS), position the pointer in 
the horizontal ruler and drag down to the 62 pica marker to create a ruler guide. Don’t 
worry about placing the guide exactly at 62 picas—you’ll do that in the next step. (You 
can look in the Transform palette to see the current position.) 
Holding down Ctrl (Windows) or Command (Mac OS), while dragging a guide, applies 
the guide to the spread instead of the individual page.
 You can also drag the ruler guide without the Ctrl or Command keys and release the 
guide over the pasteboard to have a guide appear across all pages in a spread as well as the 
pasteboard.
5 
To make sure the guide is at the 62 pica location, select the Selection tool ( ) in 
the toolbox, hold down Ctrl (Windows) or Command (Mac OS) and click the guide to 
select it. When selected, the guide changes color. In the Transform palette, the Y value is 
no longer dimmed because the guide is selected. In that Y box, type 62p, and then press 
Return or Enter.

8 Choose File > Save.
Creating a footer text frame in the master
Any text or graphics that you place on the master page will appear on pages to which 
the master is applied. To create a footer, you’ll add a publication title (“Origami”) and a 
page-number marker to the bottom of both master pages.
1 Make sure that you can see the bottom of the left master page. If necessary, zoom in 
and use the scroll bars or Hand tool (
).

2 Select the Type tool ( ) in the toolbox. On the left master page, drag to create a text 
frame below the second column where the guides intersect, as shown. Don’t worry 
about drawing the frame in exactly the right location—you’ll snap it into place later. 
Note: When drawing a frame with the Type tool, the frame starts where the horizontal 
baseline intersects the I beam in the cursor—not the upper corner of cursor.
3 With the text insertion point blinking in the new text frame, choose Type > Insert 
Special Character > AutoPage Number.
The letter B, which represents the B-Footer master, appears in your text frame. This 
character will reﬂ ect the current page number in your document pages, such as “2” on 
page 2.
4 To add an em space after the page number, right-click (Windows) or Control-click 
(Mac OS) with your cursor blinking in the text frame to display a context menu, and 
then choose Insert White Space > Em Space. You can also choose this same command 
under the Type menu if you prefer.
5 Type Origami after the em space.
Next, you’ll change the font and size of the text in the frame.

you change the font size, not the leading.
 Changes made in the Character palette or other palettes when no items are selected be-
come your default settings. To avoid modifying your defaults, be certain an object is selected 
before making changes in a palette.
8 In the toolbox, select the Selection tool ( ). If necessary, drag the footer frame so that 
it snaps to the horizontal and vertical guides, as shown.

Duplicating to create a second footer
You have created a footer text frame on the left master page. Unless you insert a similar 
footer on the right master page, only the left-facing pages in your document will have 
page numbers. You’ll copy the text frame to the right master page, and edit it from there.
1 Choose View > Fit Spread in Window to show both master pages.
2 Using the Selection tool ( ), select the footer frame, and then hold down the Alt key 
(Windows) or Option key (Mac OS) and drag the text frame to the right master page so 
that it snaps to the guides, mirroring the right master page as shown.
3 Make sure that you can see the bottom of the right master page. If necessary, zoom in 
and use the scroll bars or Hand tool.
4 Select the Type tool ( ), and then click anywhere inside the text frame on the right 
master page to place an insertion point.
5 Click the Paragraph palette tab (or choose Type > Paragraph), and then click  Align 
Right (
).
The text is now right-aligned within the footer frame on the right master page. Now you 
will improve the mirror effect by placing the page number after “Origami” on the right 
master page.
6 Delete the em space and page number at the beginning of the footer.

Creating a placeholder master
Next, you’ll create a third master page for placeholders for the text and graphics that will 
appear in your articles. By creating placeholders on the master pages, you can ensure a 
consistent layout among articles, and you won’t need to create text frames for each page 
in your document.
1 In the Pages palette, choose New Master from the Pages palette menu.
2 For Name, type Placeholder.
3 For Based on Master, choose B-Footer, and then click OK.

Notice that the C-Placeholder icons display a B in each page in the Pages palette. This 
letter indicates that the C-Placeholder master is based on the B-Footer master. If you 
were to change either the A-Grid master or the B-Footer master, the changes would 
be reﬂ ected in the C-Placeholder master. You may also notice that you cannot select 
objects, such as the footers, from other master pages unless you override those objects. 
You’ll learn about overriding master-page objects later in this lesson.

Adding a placeholder frame for graphics
You have now created the placeholder text frame for the title of your article. Next, you’ll 
add two graphics frames to the master pages. Similar to the text frames, these graphics 
frames act as placeholders for the document pages, helping you to maintain a consistent 
design.
Note: While you are creating placeholder frames for text and graphics in this exercise, it is 
not necessary to build placeholder frames on every document you create. For some smaller 
documents, you may not need to create master pages and placeholder frames.
Two tools can create rectangles: the Rectangle tool and the Rectangle Frame tool. 
Although they are more or less interchangeable, the Rectangle Frame tool—which 
includes a non-printing X—is commonly used for creating placeholders for graphics.

the spread. 
6 Choose File > Save.
Drawing a colored shape
You’ll now add a colored background for the title bar and another one across the top of 
the right master. These elements will then appear on any pages that you assign to the 
C-Placeholder master. This time, you’ll use the Rectangle tool instead of the Rectangle 
Frame tool because you’ll give the frame a ﬁ ll.

6 Save the document.
Applying the masters to document pages
Now that you have created all your master pages, it’s time to apply them to the pages in 
your layout. All the document pages are formatted with the A-Grid master by default. 
However, you will apply the B-Footer master and the C-Placeholder master to the 
appropriate pages. You can apply master pages by dragging the master-page icons onto 
the document-page icons or by using a palette-menu option.
In large documents, you may ﬁ nd it easier to display the page icons horizontally in the 
Pages palette.
1 In the Pages palette, choose Palette Options from the Pages palette menu (opened 
by clicking the palette-menu button in the upper right corner of the palette group 
window).
Note: Palette menus may be located in the top left corner if a palette is docked.

4 Drag the C-Placeholder name immediately to the left of the number 6 or 
immediately to the right of the number 7 below the page icons (not over the page icons 
themselves). When a box appears around both page icons in the spread, release the 
mouse button.
The C-Placeholder master pages are applied to pages 6 and 7, as indicated by the letter 
C in the page icons. Instead of dragging the C-Placeholder master to the remaining 
spreads, you’ll use a different method to apply master pages.
5 Choose  Apply Master to Pages from the Pages palette menu. For Apply Master, 
choose C-Placeholder. For To Pages, type 8-11. Click OK.
Notice that pages 6–11 in the Pages palette are now formatted with the C-Placeholder 
master. Now you’ll format pages 2–5 with the B-Footer master. Pages 2–5 will contain 
introductory material that requires a footer without placeholder frames.
6 Choose Apply Master to Pages from the Pages palette menu. For Apply Master, 
choose B-Footer. For To Pages, type 2-5. Click OK.
Page 12 will require individual formatting without page numbering, so no master page

8 Choose File > Save.
Adding sections to change page numbering
The magazine you’re working on requires introductory material that should be 
numbered with lowercase Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, and so on). You can change the 
page number by adding a section. You’ll start a new section on page 2 to create Roman-
numeral page numbering, and then you’ll start another section on page 6 to revert to 
Arabic numerals and restart numbering.
1 In the Pages palette, double-click the page 2 icon to select it within the palette and 
view page 2 in the document window.
Notice that because the B-Footer master is assigned to page 2, the page includes the 
guides and footer information, but it does not include any of the placeholder frames 
that you added to the C-Placeholder master.

Deleting and Arranging Pages
With the pages palette you can also arrange the sequence of pages and delete extra 
pages.
1 In the Pages palette, click and hold down on the page 9 icon and drag it to the left 
of the page 8 icon and let go. Page 9 is moved to the position of page 8, and page 8 is 
moved back one page to the position previously held by page 9.
2 Double-click the hyphen beneath the spread containing the icons for pages 8 and 9 to 
select both pages.
3 Click the trash icon at the bottom of the palette. Both pages 8 and 9 have been 
deleted from the document.
Placing text and graphics on the document pages
Now that the framework of the 12-page publication is in place, you’re ready to format 
the individual articles. To see how the changes you made to the master pages affect 
document pages, you’ll add text and graphics to the spread on pages 2 and 3.
1 In the Pages palette, double-click the page 2 icon (not page ii) to center the page in 
the document window.
Notice that because the C-Placeholder master is assigned to page 2, the page includes 
the grid, the footers, and the placeholder frames.
When you want to import text and graphics from other applications, you can copy and 
paste, or you can use the Place command. You’ll use the Place command to insert text in 
the frame.

Overriding master-page items on document pages
The placeholders you added to the master pages appear on the document pages, but 
you cannot select them simply by clicking them. InDesign works this way so that you 
won’t accidentally remove or edit master-page objects. However, you can override items 
on a master page to customize individual document pages. You’ll now replace the word 
“Title” with “History of Origami.”

page remain in effect—that is, that the text is still red and still says “PAPER TRAILS” 
instead of “TITLE” and “PART ONE” instead of “XXX.” 
Rotating the frame on the master page affected all the pages to which the master was 
applied, including the page containing the local override. When you override a master-
page item on a document page, you override only the set of attributes that you change. 
In this case, you changed the text and the color of text on the document page. If you 
were to change the text or color of text on the master page, those changes would not 
affect this overridden object.

Working with Frames
LESSON 3
In this introduction to working with frames, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Use the Selection and Direct Selection tools to modify frames and their contents.
• Resize and reshape text and graphic frames.
• Distinguish between  bounding boxes and their frames.
• Crop a graphic.
• Scale an image contained in a graphics frame.
• Move a graphic within its frame.
• Convert a graphics frame to a text frame.
• Wrap text around an object.
• Create and rotate a polygon frame.
• Align graphic objects to each other.
• Center and scale an object within a frame.
Getting started
In this lesson, you’ll work on a two-page article for a magazine about origami paper 
folding. Before you begin, you’ll need to restore the default preferences for Adobe 
InDesign to ensure that the tools and palettes function exactly as described in this 
lesson. Then you’ll open the ﬁ nished document for this lesson to see what you’ll be 
creating.
1 Delete or deactivate (by renaming) the InDesign Defaults ﬁ le and the InDesign 
SavedData ﬁ le, as described in “Restoring default preferences” on page 2. 
2 Start Adobe InDesign. To begin working, you’ll open an InDesign document that is 
already partially completed.
3 Choose File > Open, and open the 03_a.indd ﬁ le in the ID_03 folder, located inside 
the Lessons folder within the IDCIB folder on your hard disk.
Note: If you have not already copied the resource ﬁ les for this lesson onto your hard disk 
from the ID_03 folder from the Adobe InDesign CS Classroom in a Book CD, do so now. 
See “Copying the Classroom in a Book ﬁ les” on page 2.
4 Choose File > Save As, rename the ﬁ le 03_frames.indd, and save it in the ID_03 
folder.

5 To see what the ﬁ nished document will look like, open the 03_b.indd ﬁ le in the same 
folder. You can leave this document open to act as a guide as you work. When you’re 
ready to resume working on the lesson document, choose Window > 03_frames.indd.
Note: As you work through the lesson, feel free to move palettes around or change the 
magniﬁ cation to a level that works best for you.
Modifying text frames
In most cases, text must be placed inside of a frame. The size and location of a frame 
determine how the text appears on a page. 
Resizing text frames
You’ll resize a text frame using the Selection tool. The size of the text characters inside 
the frame remain unchanged, but when you resize a frame, the text ﬂ ow will wrap 
differently or display more or less text after you change the frame size.
This document includes two layers: Art and Text. You’ll conﬁ rm that the objects on the 
Art layer are locked so that you won’t accidentally select the shapes while you resize the 
text frames.

LESSON 3
1 Click the Layers palette tab (or choose Window > Layers if you do not see the Layers 
palette), and do the following:
•  If necessary, click the lock box to the left of the Art layer to lock the layer. 
• Using the Selection tool ( ), click to select the text frame on the left page. Notice that 
the text frame has eight hollow handles and a solid center point.

About frames, paths, and selections
When you select an object on an InDesign page, various color-coded lines and small squares appear around 
the object. These items represent different things, including the bounding box, handles, path, anchor points, 
and center point. The colors deﬁ ned in the Layer palette determine how these attributes appear on screen.
• The frame is a container for text, graphics, or colored ﬁ lls, or it can be empty. The frame is independent 
of its contents, so the edges of the frame may hide part of its graphic contents or the contents may not 
entirely ﬁ ll the frame. A frame with no content can serve as a placeholder for text, images, or ﬁ lls that you 
add later. 
• A bounding box is always rectangular, enclosing the maximum horizontal and vertical extensions of the 
selected item. The bounding boxes for a frame and for the graphic inside it can be different sizes. 
• The path and the shape of a frame are identical and do not have to be rectangular. A path is a vector 
graphic. You can use InDesign drawing tools to create paths and then do all the things you can do to any 
closed paths, such as add ﬁ lls, specify stroke attributes, and edit the paths with the Pen tool ( ). 
• There are eight handles and a  center point for a bounding box, appearing as small squares in the 
corners, at the midpoints of sides, and in the center. Dragging a handle modiﬁ es the bounding box. 
• The path is deﬁ ned by anchor points, which look like smaller handles. You drag anchor points to alter the 
shape of the path. When the anchor points are visible, you can also see the center point for the frame. When 
the path is visible, you can click the center point to select all anchor points in the path.

C. Frame with a placed graphic.
The tool you use to select an object determines how you can change it.
• Use the Type tool (
) to type text and to select and edit text within a text frame.
• Use the Selection tool (
) to move or resize a frame.
• Use the Direct Selection tool (
) to reshape the path by selecting and working with anchor points. Also 
use this tool to set path characteristics and to resize, reshape, and move the graphic within a graphics frame 
without altering the frame itself.

So far, you’ve dragged a handle to resize the text frame, using the Selection tool. Now, 
you’ll use an anchor point to reshape the frame, using the Direct Selection tool.
1 If the text frame on the left page is not selected, use the Selection tool ( ) to select it 
now.
2 In the toolbox, click the Direct Selection tool ( ). Four very small anchor points 
now appear at the corners of the selected text frame. The anchor points are hollow, 
indicating that none of them are selected.

A. Unselected anchor point. 
B. Selected anchor point.
3 Select the anchor point in the upper left corner of the text frame and drag it 
downward until it snaps to the horizontal guide below it. (After you start dragging, you 
can hold down Shift to restrict any horizontal movement.) 
Make sure you drag only the anchor point—if you drag just below the anchor point, 
you’ll move the text frame.
4 Press V on your keyboard to switch to the Selection tool ( ).

Next, you’ll change the text frame on the right page of the spread so that it mirrors the 
text frame on the left page.
5 Click a blank area of your document to deselect the text frame, or choose 
Edit > Deselect All.
6 Press A on your keyboard to switch back to the Direct Selection tool ( ) and click the 
large text block on page 5. Select the upper left anchor point of the text frame and drag 
it up to the same horizontal guide you used to reshape text on the left page. You can 
hold down Shift as you drag to ensure that the change is only vertical.
7 Deselect all objects and then choose File > Save.
 Pressing the A and V keys to toggle between the Selection and Direct Selection tools are 
just two of many keyboard shortcuts available in InDesign. For more shortcuts, refer to 
“Keyboard shortcuts” in online Help.

LESSON 3
Modifying graphics frames
In this section, you’ll focus on different techniques for modifying frames and frame 
contents. To start, you’ll import an image and place it in your document spread. Because 
you’ll be working on graphics rather than text, your ﬁ rst step is to make sure that 
the graphics appear on the Art layer rather than on the Text layer. Isolating items on 
different layers helps your work process so that it’s easier to ﬁ nd and edit elements of 
your design.
1 In the Layers palette, click the second-column box to unlock the Art layer. Lock the 
Text layer by clicking in the second column box. Then select the Art layer by clicking on 
the name of the layer so that new elements will be assigned to this layer.
2 To center page 4 in the document window, choose 4 from the Pages pop-up menu at 
the bottom of the document window.
3 Choose File > Place and in the Place dialog box deselect “Replace Selected Item” and 
then double-click 03_c.tif in the ID_03 folder.
The pointer changes to a loaded graphics icon (
).
Note: If the pointer appears with a line through it (
), the current layer is selected but still 
locked. You cannot add objects to a locked layer. Make sure that the Art layer in the Layers 
palette is both unlocked and selected. The pointer should then appear as a loaded graphics 
icon so that you can proceed with this step.

4 Click near the top left corner of page 4 to place the graphic. It doesn’t matter exactly 
where you place it or that the purple image may cover some of the story text. You’ll ﬁ x 
that later.
5 Press V to select the Selection tool ( ). Then drag the image so that it snaps into 
place at the top of the page and on the left side of the column gutter. The left edge of the 
graphic should ﬁ t snugly against the yellow bar of the title column, with no gap between 
them.
Resizing a graphic frame 
The design for this page calls for the purple background image to extend across the page 
from the title panel to the right edge of the page. Although this image is not yet the right 
size or shape to do that, you’ll start making those adjustments now. 
First, you’ll stretch the frame to ﬁ t the width of your spread. 
1 Choose View > Fit Spread in Window so that you can see all of pages 4 and 5 in the 
document window. If necessary, scroll horizontally so that you can see the right edge of 
page 5.

Working with Frames
LESSON 3
2 Using the Selection tool ( ), click the purple-texture graphic. Drag the lower right 
handle until the right side of the bounding box snaps into place against the horizontal 
guide at the 32-pica mark on the vertical ruler and to the edge of page 5.
Notice that only the frame bounding box changes, not the purple image itself.
Resizing and moving an image within a frame
You have just ﬁ nished resizing a graphic frame, but the content image remains 
unchanged. You’ll now resize just the image so that it ﬁ lls the designated area. 
 In addition to the methods we use here, you can also use the context menus to resize 
pictures to ﬁ t within their frame. Do this by right-clicking (Windows) or Ctrl+clicking 
(Mac OS) and selecting Fitting > Fit Content Proportionally.
The content and frame for any element are separate things. Unlike with text objects, the 
frame and content for a graphic each has its own bounding box. Resizing the graphic 
contents is exactly like resizing the frame, except that you work with the bounding box 
for the contents. To do that, you need the Direct Selection tool.
1 Press A to switch to the Direct Selection tool ( ), then position the pointer over the 
purple background image until the pointer appears as a hand, and then click to select 
the frame contents (the image itself).
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE InDesign CS 127
Classroom in a Book
2 Select the handle in the lower right corner of the graphic bounding box, and then 
hold down Shift and drag to enlarge the image. Continue dragging until the image 
dimensions are even larger than the frame, so that the handle is off the page and onto 
the pasteboard.
Dragging bounding box of contents, and view after dragging.
3 Move the Direct Selection tool over the purple image so that you see the hand icon. 
Try dragging the image with the hand icon, and notice how the area of the image that is 
visible within the frame changes as you drag. If you drag too far to the right, notice that 
the image no longer covers the left side of the frame area. 
 
 Before you start dragging, click and hold down the mouse button until the hand icon 
turns into a solid arrow (
) pointer. Then, after you start dragging, you’ll see a ghosted 
image of the hidden areas of the graphic contents, a feature called Dynamic Preview. If you 
don’t wait for the pointer icon to change, you’ll still see the bounding box of the graphic as 
you drag.
4 Make sure that the image entirely ﬁ lls the frame, and then click a blank area of the 
page to deselect the purple image. Save your work.
 Images expanded beyond 120% of their original size may not contain enough pixel 
information for high-resolution offset printing. Check with your printer or service provider 
if you are uncertain as to the resolution and scaling requirements needed for any documents 
you are having printed.

Working with Frames
LESSON 3
Changing the shape of the frame
When you resized the frame using the Selection tool, the frame maintained its 
rectangular shape. Now you will use the Pen tool and the Direct Selection tool to 
reshape the frame.
1 Press A for the Direct Selection tool ( ). Then move the tip of the pointer over 
the edge of the purple-image frame, and click when the pointer appears with a small 
diagonal line (
). This selects the path and reveals the anchor points and center point 
for the frame. Leave the path selected.
2 Press P to switch to the Add Anchor Point Pen tool (
). Carefully position the 
pointer over the lower edge of the frame path where it intersects with the right margin 
of page 4 and then click. A new anchor point is added.
3 Move to page 5, where the lower side of the path intersects with the left margin, and 
using the Add Anchor Point Pen tool (
) click again to add another new anchor point.
4 Press A to switch to the Direct Selection tool. With the second new anchor point still 
selected, move the pointer over the ﬁ rst new anchor point (on page 4 of the layout) until 
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE InDesign CS 129
Classroom in a Book
the pointer arrow appears with a small square (
). Then hold down Shift and click to 
select that anchor point. Now both new anchor points appear solid, showing that they 
are selected.
5 Drag upwards, holding down Shift as you drag from either one of the new anchor 
points or the path segment between them. When both anchor points snap into place on 
the next guide (at 22p on the vertical ruler), release the mouse button and the Shift key.
 
The graphic is now properly shaped and sized for the design.
6 Press V to switch to the Selection tool, and select the purple graphic. Then choose 
Object > Arrange > Send to Back so that the graphic appears to be behind other 
elements in the Art layer.
 You can simultaneously resize both a graphic image and its frame by using the Selection 
tool and holding down Ctrl+Shift (Windows) or Command+Shift (Mac OS) as you drag 
a handle of the frame. In this case, the Shift key maintains the proportions of the bounding 
boxes, so that the graphic image is not distorted. Using the Shift key is optional if distorting 
the image doesn’t matter to your design.
Modifying a frame within grouped objects
You can select individual elements of a grouped object using the Direct Selection tool. 
The black and gray rectangles behind the sidebar story in the lower right corner of page 
5 are grouped, so that you can select and modify them as a unit. You’ll now change 
the ﬁ ll color of just one of the rectangles without ungrouping or changing the other 
elements of the group.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

Working with Frames
LESSON 3
1 In the Layers palette, make sure the Text layer is locked and that the Art layer is 
selected.
2 Using the Selection tool ( ), click either the gray or the black background behind the 
sidebar story. The entire sidebar background is selected, showing the usual eight handles 
in the bounding box. Notice that a question mark (?) appears in the toolbar Fill box (
), 
indicating that the grouped items do not all have the same ﬁ ll color. 
3 Press Ctrl+Shift+A (Windows) or Command+Shift+A (Mac OS) to deselect the 
group.
4 Press A to switch to the Direct Selection tool, and click the black ﬁ ll in the upper 
part of the sidebar background. Now the four anchor points and center point for the 
black rectangle appear. Notice that the Fill box in the toolbox is black and that Black is 
highlighted in the Swatches palette.
5 Make sure that the Fill box (
) is still selected in the toolbox. Then scroll down the 
Swatches palette and select the Black 80% tint. Now the upper rectangle behind the text 
block has a dark gray ﬁ ll but the lower one remains ﬁ lled with light gray.
6 Save your ﬁ le.
When you have the smaller rectangle selected, notice what happens if you switch back 
to the Selection tool: The handles appear, but only for the upper rectangle, not for the 
entire group as they appeared when you did step 2, above. This can be handy when you 
have nested objects and want to adjust the frame without ungrouping.
Wrapping text around a graphic
You can wrap text around the frame of an object or around the object itself. In this 
procedure, you’ll see the difference between wrapping text around the bounding box 
and wrapping text around the graphic.
Your ﬁ rst task is to move the graphic, which couldn’t be easier; you just select it and 
drag. For precise positioning, you can also use the arrow keys to nudge a frame or you 
can type exact position coordinates on the Transform palette. 
1 
Using the Selection tool ( ), select the eight-pointed graphics frame with the image 
of an origami crane that is on page 4. Being careful not to select one of the handles, 
move the frame down so that the top of the graphic snaps into alignment with the lower 
guide, at 42 picas on the vertical ruler. Make sure that the center point of the graphic 
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE InDesign CS 131
Classroom in a Book
is aligned with the middle of the gutter between the two columns of text. The frame 
should not have changed size but it should have moved on the page.
Notice that the text appears on top of the image. You’ll change this by applying text 
wrap.
2 Choose Window > Type & Tables > Text Wrap to open the Text Wrap palette, and 
select the second wrap option so that the text wraps around the bounding box, not 
around the star-shaped frame.
Text wrapped around bounding box.
3 Next, select the third wrap option so that the text wraps around the contour of the 
image frame instead of the bounding box. Click a blank area to deselect all.

4 Leave the Text Wrap palette open for now, and choose File > Save.
Creating new frames and adjusting the contents
So far in this lesson, you’ve changed the size, shape, position, and color of frames and 
the contents within the frames. In this section, you’ll experiment with different ways 
to create new frames quickly, with a minimum of effort on your part. These include 
duplicating existing frames, drawing new frames, and replacing the existing contents of 
a frame. Because frames are independent of their contents, you can replace the contents 
of any frame with either graphics or text. You’ll get experience doing both in these 
procedures.
Duplicating a frame and its contents
Using the familiar copy-and-paste technique, you can quickly duplicate objects in your 
design. In this procedure, you’ll also use a keyboard shortcut to duplicate and move an 
object in one action. 
1 Using the Selection tool ( ), select the crane graphic, and choose Edit > Copy.
2 Choose Edit > Paste. A duplicate of the crane and its frame appears in the center of 
the window.
3 Drag the new crane graphic up into the purple background area on page 4 so that the 
lower edge snaps into position with the guide at 22 picas on the vertical rules.
4 Choose View > Fit Spread in Window.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE InDesign CS 133
Classroom in a Book
5 Hold down Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) and drag the crane graphic to page 
5. When you release the mouse, you’ll see that by using the Alt or Option key, you have 
moved a new copy of the graphic, as the original remains in place.
 If you hold down the mouse button for a few seconds before you start to drag, you’ll see 
the ghosted copy of the duplicate graphic frame and contents as you move it.
6 Select the Selection tool ( ) and click to select the crane graphic on page 5. Hold 
down Shift, and click the corner handle, dragging to enlarge it slightly. Then let go of the 
shift key, click and drag the graphic as needed so that it is approximately centered over 
the far right column of the page.
Replacing the contents of graphics frames
After you create the two duplicates, it’s easy to replace the contents with other graphics 
or text. Your next task is to resize the new star-shaped frames and replace the crane 
images with other images. Because the frame and contents are independent, it’s easy to 
swap out one image for another.
1 Using the Selection tool ( ), select the new crane graphic you placed in the upper 
area of page 4. Hold down Shift to maintain the symmetry of the frame, drag up from

the upper right handle to above the top edge of the spread so that part of the image 
bleeds off the page. Leave the frame selected.
2 Choose File > Place, and browse as needed to ﬁ nd the 03_d.tif ﬁ le in your ID_03 
folder. Select “Replace Selected Item” in the Place dialog box.
3 Double-click the 03_d.tif to place the new image directly into the selected frame, 
replacing the crane image.
4 With the frame still selected, choose Object > Fitting > Fit Content to Frame. 
InDesign resizes the graphic so that it ﬁ ts into the frame.
You can also access the ﬁ tting commands from the context menus by either right-clicking 
(Windows) or Option+Clicking (Mac OS).
5 Select the duplicate crane image, on page 5.
6 Choose File > Place, and browse as needed to ﬁ nd the 03_e.jpg ﬁ le in your ID_03 
folder. The image of an origami box replaces the image of the origami crane.

7 With the box graphic still selected, choose Object > Fitting > Fit Content to Frame.
Now you’ve used a single frame shape three times to hold three different images.
Drawing a new graphics frame
Until now, you’ve used only frames prepared for you for this lesson. Now it’s time for 
you to create a frame on your own, using the drawing tools in the toolbox.
1 In the toolbox, hold down the mouse on the Rectangle tool until you see other 
options, and select the Polygon tool (
).
2 Double-click the Polygon tool to open the Polygon Settings dialog box, and specify 
the following:
• For Number of Sides, type 4.
• If necessary, type 20% for Star Inset and then click OK. 
3 
Hold down Shift and drag to draw a four-pointed star that it is 12p x 12p, using the 
H and W values in either the Control or Transform palette as a reference as you drag the 
star. If you have difﬁ culty getting the values exactly at 12 picas, leave the star selected, 
type the values in the W and H boxes of the Transform palette, and press Enter or 
Return.

136
Working with Frames
LESSON 3
4 Press V to switch to the Selection tool and then drag the new star into position in 
the purple background on page 5, so that it is slightly off center and entirely within the 
purple background image. Leave the star selected.
5 Make sure that the Fill box (
) is selected in the toolbox.
6 
Click the Swatches palette tab (or choose Window > Swatches) and select the color 
named C=0 M=28 Y=100 K=0 to ﬁ ll the star with a mustard yellow color.
7 In the toolbox, select the Stroke box (
) and then click the Apply None button (
) 
to remove the black stroke color.
Placing and coloring text in a color-ﬁ lled frame
You can place text in a frame of any closed shape, and the text will ﬂ ow in to ﬁ ll the 
shape from the top. You can even replace a graphic in a frame with text. In this case, 
however, the frame does not have a graphic as its contents, just a ﬁ ll. The ﬁ ll color 
simply appears as a background for the imported text.

1 Using the Selection tool, select the four-point star and then hold down Alt 
(Windows) or Option (Mac OS) and drag a short distance to create a duplicate frame.
2 In the toolbox, select the Fill box (
), and then in the Swatches palette, select 80% 
black as the ﬁ ll color for the new frame.
3 In the Layers palette, click the Text layer lock icon (
) to unlock the Text layer.
4 With the 80% gray star selected, drag the dot from the Art layer to the Text layer to 
move the star to that layer. Leave the star selected.

5 Choose File > Place, and then browse to the 03_ID folder and double-click the 
03_f.doc ﬁ le. The text appears in the star, with the same text formatting that it had in 
the original .doc ﬁ le. The out port on the bounding box is empty, indicating that all the 
text for the pull quote ﬁ ts into the 12-pica star shape.
6 Select the frame containing the imported text.
7 Make sure the Text Fill box (
) is selected in the Swatches palette then click to select 
C=0 M=28 Y=100 K=0 so that the text is also mustard-colored.
Orienting objects in space
You’ve already seen how you can move, reshape, and resize elements on your document 
layout. In this section, you’ll use various features that adjust the orientation of objects 
on the page and in relationship to each other. To begin, you’ll adjust the inset between 
text and the frame that contains it. Then you’ll work with rotation techniques and 
alignment of selected objects.
Adjusting text inset within a frame
Your next task is to ﬁ nish up the pull quote items by ﬁ tting the text nicely into the star 
frame. By adjusting the inset between the frame and the text, you make it easier to read.
1 Click to select the Selection tool ( ) in the toolbox, and then select the star with the 
pull-quote text.
Note: Do not try to use a keyboard shortcut to switch to another tool when the text tool 
is active, especially if you have text selected or an insertion point placed in a block of text. 
Doing so would enter text, so the action would not change the tool selection.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE InDesign CS 139

2 Choose Object > Text Frame Options to open the Text Frame Options dialog box. If 
necessary, drag the dialog box aside so that you can still see the star as you set options.
3 In the dialog box, make sure that the Preview option is selected. Then, under Inset 
Spacing, change the Inset value to shrink the text area until it ﬁ ts nicely in the frame. 
(The sample uses 0p4.) Then click OK to close the dialog box. 
Rotating an object
There are several options within InDesign for rotating objects. In this topic, you’ll use 
the Transform palette.
1 Using the Selection tool ( ), select the four-pointed yellow star.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

140
Working with Frames
LESSON 3
2 In the Transform palette, make sure that the center point is selected on the proxy 
icon (
) so that the object rotates around its center, and then select 45° from the 
rotation angle pop-up menu. 
Aligning multiple objects
Now that the two four-pointed stars are set at a 45° angle from each other, you can 
position one on top of the other so that all eight points radiate from the same center-
point position. Precise alignment is easiest when you use the Align palette.
1 Using the Selection tool ( ), select the yellow star and then hold down Shift and click 
the gray star so that both four-pointed stars are selected. 
2 Choose Window > Align to open the Align palette.
3 In the Align palette, select the Align Horizontal Centers button (
). The two stars 
are now lined up exactly side by side.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE InDesign CS 141
Classroom in a Book
4 Again, in the Align palette, click the Align Vertical Centers button (
). The two stars 
are now centered on the same location in the layout.
5 Click a blank area to deselect all, and then save your ﬁ le.
Rotating an image within its frame
You can rotate both the frame and contents in one action by selecting the object with 
the Selection tool and then dragging one of the handles with the Rotation tool ( ). 
However, sometimes you just want to set the image at a jaunty angle. That process is just 
a slight variation on the procedure.
When you rotated the yellow star, you used the Transform palette to set a precise 
rotation angle. In this procedure, you’ll use the rotation tool to rotate the graphic freely.
1 If necessary, press V to switch to the Selection tool, and then position the pointer 
over the origami box image in the star on page 5 and then click.
2 In the Transform palette, make sure that the center proxy icon (
) is selected.
3 Press R to select the Rotation tool (
).
4 Move the pointer over the corner handle, so that it appears as crosshairs ( ).

5 Move the pointer over one of the corner handles and hold down the mouse button 
and then drag handles counterclockwise to rotate both the image and the frame, 
stopping when you like the look of the results. The sample uses a rotation of 25°.
Note: Waiting for the pointer to become a solid arrow lets you preview the contents on-the-
ﬂ y as you rotate. If you don’t wait for the pointer, the bounding box will remain visible as 
you drag to rotate.

On your own
One of the best ways to learn about frames is to experiment on your own. In this 
section, you will learn how to nest an object inside a shape you create. Follow these steps 
to learn more about selecting and manipulating frames:
1 Using the Direct Selection tool ( ), select and copy any image on page 4 or 5.
2 To create a new page, choose Insert Pages from the Pages palette menu and then click 
OK.
3 Use the Polygon tool to draw a shape on the new page (use any number of sides and 
any value for the star inset). Select the shape using the Direct Selection tool, and then 
choose Edit > Paste Into to nest the image inside the frame. (If you choose Edit > Paste, 
the object will not be pasted inside the selected frame.)

C
A. Image pasted into frame. B. Image moved and scaled within the 
frame. C. Polygon frame reshaped.
4 Use the Direct Selection tool to move and scale the image within the frame.
5 Use the Direct Selection tool to change the shape of the polygon frame.
6 Use the Selection tool ( ) to rotate both the frame and the image. Use the Direct 
Selection tool to rotate only the image within the frame.
7 When you are done experimenting, close the document without saving.
Review questions
1 When should you use the Selection tool ( ) to select an object, and when should you 
use the Direct Selection tool ( ) to select an object?
2 How do you resize a frame and its contents simultaneously?
3 How do you rotate a graphic within a frame without rotating the frame?
4 Without ungrouping objects, how do you select an object within a group?
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

144
Working with Frames
LESSON 3
Review answers
1 Use the Selection tool ( ) for general layout tasks, such as positioning and sizing 
objects. Use the Direct Selection tool ( ) for tasks involving drawing and editing paths 
or frames; for example, to select frame contents or to move an anchor point on a path.
2 To resize a frame and its contents simultaneously, select the Selection tool, hold down 
Ctrl (Windows) or Command (Mac OS), and then drag a handle. Hold down Shift to 
maintain the object’s proportions.
3 To rotate a graphic within a frame, use the Direct Selection tool to select the graphic 
within the frame. Select the Rotation tool (
), and then drag one of the handles to 
rotate only the graphic, not the frame.
4 To select an object within a group, select it using the Direct Selection tool.

4 Importing and Editing Text
With Adobe InDesign you can import 
text, thread it through frames, and 
edit text within the frames. Once 
you import text, you can create and 
apply styles, ﬁ nd and replace text and 
formatting, and use different language 
dictionaries to spell-check any part of 
your document.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

148
Importing and Editing Text
LESSON 4
In this introduction to importing and editing text, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Enter text into text frames.
• Flow text manually and automatically.
• Load styles from another document and apply them.
• Thread text.
• Use semi-autoﬂ ow to place text frames.
• Find and change text and formatting.
• Find and change a missing font.
• Spell-check a document.
Getting started
In this lesson, you’ll work on an 8-page newsletter for Sonata Cycles, a ﬁ ctitious chain of 
bicycle stores. Several pages of the newsletter have already been completed. Now that the 
ﬁ nal article for the newsletter has been written, you’re ready to ﬂ ow the article into the 
document and add the ﬁ nishing touches to the newsletter. Before you begin, you’ll need 
to make several preparations:
• If you have not already copied the resource ﬁ les for this lesson from the ID_04 
folder of the Adobe InDesign CS Classroom in a Book CD, do so now. See “Copying the 
Classroom in a Book ﬁ les” on page 2.
• Restore the default preferences for Adobe InDesign, as described in step 1, below.
When your preparations are complete, you’re ready to start work on the lesson.
1 To ensure that the tools and palettes function exactly as described in this lesson, 
delete or deactivate (by renaming) the InDesign Defaults ﬁ le and the InDesign 
SavedData ﬁ le. See “Restoring default preferences” on page 2. 
2 Start Adobe InDesign.

Managing fonts
To begin working, you’ll open an existing InDesign document. We have added a font to 
this document that you do not have on your system, so you will receive an error message 
relating to the missing font. You will replace this font later in this lesson.
1 Choose File > Open, and open the 04_a.indd ﬁ le in the ID_04 folder, located inside 
the Lessons folder within the IDCIB folder on your hard disk.
When you open a ﬁ le that includes fonts not installed on your system, an alert message 
indicates which font is missing. The text that uses this missing font is also highlighted in 
pink. You will ﬁ x this missing font problem later in this lesson by replacing the missing 
font with an available font. This is useful because InDesign makes it clear which fonts 
might cause problems when printing and provides several opportunities to correct the 
situation.
2 Click OK to close the alert message.
Navigate through the pages in the document and you can see that pages 5 through 8 
have already been completed. The missing font is located on page 8. In this lesson, you 
will complete the ﬁ rst four pages of the newsletter and then correct the missing font.
3 Choose File > Save As and name the ﬁ le 04_News, and save it in the ID_04 folder.

4 To see what the ﬁ nished document will look like, open the 04_b.indd ﬁ le in the same 
folder. If you prefer, you can leave the document open to act as a guide as you work. 
When you’re ready to resume working on the lesson document, choose its name from 
the Window menu.
Creating and entering text
You can use InDesign to enter text into your documents or your can import text created 
in other programs, such as word processing software. 
Creating a headline and applying a style
In the area beneath the banner, “Sonata Cycles News,” and the space that will contain 
the start of the article, you’ll create a text frame for the article headline, “Team Sonata 
Captures 24 Hours Race.” This headline text frame will span the two columns. You’ll 
then apply a headline style to this headline and format the headline.
1 While viewing page one, double-click the Zoom tool (
) to increase the 
magniﬁ cation to 100%.
2 To mark the location of the top of your headline frame you will create a guide and 
then create the frame. Hold down Shift and drag a guide from the horizontal ruler to 
the 18p6 (18 picas, 6 points) location on page 1. To help you position the guide, watch 
the Y value in either the Control or Transform palettes as you drag. Holding down Shift 
constrains the position of the guide in 6-point increments.

3 Using the Type tool ( ) , position the type cursor next to the left margin over the 
18p6 guide. The horizontal crossbar on the type cursor should be at 18p6.
4 Drag to create a text frame in the blank area below the 18p6 guide and above the 21p 
guide. The text frame should span the two columns, and the top of the frame should 
snap to the 18p6 guide, while the bottom snaps to the 21p guide.
 If you need to resize the frame, select the Selection tool, and drag the handles of the 
frame to snap to the guides. Then select the Type tool and click inside the frame.
After you draw a text frame using the Type tool, an insertion point appears, ready for 
you to begin typing.

In the text frame you just created, type Team Sonata Captures 24 Hours Race.
To make this headline consistent with other headlines used in the newsletter, you’ll 
apply the Head 1 style. When you apply a paragraph style, you can place the insertion 
point anywhere in the paragraph or select any part of the paragraph.
6 With the insertion point anywhere in the headline text you just typed, select Head 1 
in the Paragraph Styles palette.
7 Save the ﬁ le.
Flowing text
The process of taking imported text, such as that from a word processing program, and 
placing it across several linked text frames is called ﬂ owing text. InDesign lets you ﬂ ow 
text manually for greater control or automatically to save time.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 153

Tips on ﬂ owing text
When your pointer becomes a loaded text icon (
) after you place text or click an in port or out port, you 
are ready to ﬂ ow text onto your pages. When you position the loaded text icon over a text frame, parenthe-
ses enclose the icon (
).
In addition, the icon can appear in one of three forms, which correspond to the method you choose for 
controlling the ﬂ ow of text on your pages:
Manual text ﬂ ow (
) adds text one frame at a time. It stops ﬂ owing text at the bottom of a text frame, or 
at the last of a series of linked frames. You must reload the text icon to continue ﬂ owing text.
Semi-autoﬂ ow (
) works like manual text ﬂ ow, except that the pointer reloads as a loaded text icon each 
time the end of a frame is reached, until all text is ﬂ owed into your document. 
Autoﬂ ow (
) adds pages and frames until all the text is ﬂ owed into your document.
–From Adobe InDesign CS online Help.
Flowing text manually
To ﬂ ow text manually, you ﬁ rst select a word processing ﬁ le to import. You can then 
drag to create a frame, or you can click anywhere on the page to create a text frame in a 
column. In this exercise you will use both methods to ﬂ ow the text into the columns on 
the ﬁ rst page of the newsletter.
1 In the Pages palette, double-click the page 1 icon to center the ﬁ rst page in the 
document window. Click on a blank part of the page to deselect all items.
2 Choose File > Place. In the place dialog box; make sure that Show Import Options is 
selected, locate and double-click 04_c.doc in the ID_04 folder and click Open. 
3 Make certain that Remove Text and Table Formatting is not selected in the import 
options dialog box. Deselecting this option causes the text to be imported with the 
same formatting that was applied in the word-processing application. Selecting this 
option would remove any formatting that was applied to the text. You want to keep the 
formatting, so you will keep this option deselected.
You will now create a text frame between the light blue guides below the banner on the 
left side of page 1.

LESSON 4
4 Create a text frame in the left column of page 1 by positioning the loaded text icon 
next to the left margin just below the 21p (21-pica) guide and dragging down to the 
right side of the ﬁ rst column at the 30p guide.
Dragging to create a text frame.
Notice that the text frame includes an out port in the lower right corner. The red plus 
sign indicates that there is overset text. There is more text than ﬁ ts into the existing text 
frame. You will now ﬂ ow this text into the second column on page 1.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 155
Classroom in a Book
5 Using the Selection tool ( ), click the out port of the frame you just created.
If you change your mind and decide you don’t want to ﬂ ow overset text, you can click 
any tool in the toolbox to cancel the loaded text icon. No text will be deleted.
6 Position the loaded text icon in the upper left corner of the second column just 
below the 21p guide, and click.
The text ﬂ ows into a new frame from where you clicked to the bottom of the second 
column. The out port in the new column contains a red plus sign, again indicating that 
there is still overset text.
Note: While you can create separate, linked frames for each column, it is also possible to 
work with one large column that is divided into multiple columns using 
Object > Text Frame Options. Each method has its advantages in certain types of 
documents.
Flowing text automatically
You will use autoﬂ ow to place the rest of the overset text into the document. When you 
autoﬂ ow text, InDesign creates new text frames within column guides on subsequent 
pages until all the overset text is ﬂ owed. If there are not enough pages in your document 
when you use autoﬂ ow, InDesign adds new pages until all the text is placed. 
Note: A connected series of text frames is called a story.
1 Using the Selection tool ( ), click the out port in the lower right corner of the frame 
you just created in the second column on page 1.
While the loaded text icon is active, you can still navigate to different document pages 
or create new pages. This allows you to continue ﬂ owing text onto other pages in your

document—even if these pages have not yet been created at the time you click on the 
out port of a text frame.
2 In the Pages palette, double-click the page 2 icon to center page 2 in the document 
window. (You may need to scroll down the palette to ﬁ nd the icon for page 2.) Notice 
that there are no text frames on page 2. Also notice that the text icon is still loaded.
3 Holding down Shift, position the loaded text icon in the upper left corner of the left 
column on page 2, and click. Release the Shift key.
Holding down Shift lets you autoﬂ ow text into your document.
Notice that two new text frames were added to each page within the column guides. 
This is because you held down Shift to autoﬂ ow text. All the text in the story is now 
placed on pages 2 through 4.
Resizing a text frame
When you create a text frame by clicking the loaded text icon, InDesign creates the new 
text frame as wide as the column where you click. Although these frames are placed 
within the column margins, you can move, resize, and reshape any of these text frames 
if necessary.
1 Navigate to page 4 by clicking the page selector in the lower left corner of the 
document window.
Notice that the text frame in the left column covers the photograph that was placed 
on this page. When you autoﬂ ow text, the text frames are created within the column 
settings regardless of whether objects appear in those columns. You can ﬁ x this overlap 
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

by adding a text wrap to the image or by resizing the text frame. In this exercise you will 
resize the text frame.
2 Using the Selection tool (( ), click the text frame in the left column on page 4 to 
select the text frame, and then drag the lower middle handle of the text frame above the 
photograph to approximately the 31p location (you can look at the vertical ruler as you 
drag or in the transform palette).
Before and after resizing text frame.
3 Choose File > Save.
Flowing text into an existing frame 
When you place text, you can ﬂ ow text into a new frame or into an existing frame. To 
ﬂ ow text into an existing frame, you can click an insertion point to ﬂ ow text at that 
point, or you can click the loaded text icon in an existing frame, which replaces its 
contents.
The ﬁ rst page of the newsletter includes a placeholder frame for a sidebar. You’ll place 
the text in this frame that announces upcoming cycling events.
1 Turn to the ﬁ rst page of the newsletter. 
2 Choose File > Place. Locate and double-click 04_d.doc in the ID_04 folder.
The pointer becomes a loaded text icon (
). When you move the loaded text icon over 
an empty text frame, parentheses enclose the icon (
).

Note: If the text formatting in your ﬁ le looks different than the illustration above, don’t 
worry, because you’ll be changing all the formatting for this text block in the next set of 
steps.
Working with styles
Styles make it easy to apply repetitive formatting across an entire document. For 
example, to keep all headlines formatted consistently through your document, you can 
create a headline style that contains the necessary formatting attributes. Styles can save 
time when you apply and revise text formatting and can help provide a consistent look 
to your documents.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 159
Classroom in a Book
Applying a style
To make the appearance of the article consistent with the other articles in the newsletter, 
you will apply a paragraph style called Body Copy. We created this style for formatting 
the body text of the main articles in the newsletter. 
1 Click the Paragraph Styles palette (or choose Window > Type > Paragraph Styles) to 
make the palette visible, if it is not already open.
The Paragraph Styles palette for this document now includes four styles: Body Copy, 
Head 1, Head 2, and Normal. The Normal style has a disk icon next to it, indicating that 
the style was imported from a different application. In this case, Normal is a Microsoft 
Word style that was imported when you placed the article. You’ll now apply the 
InDesign style, Body Copy, to the text.
Note: There are no default paragraph styles when you ﬁ rst create a document with 
InDesign. You can create new styles or add styles from other InDesign documents. Styles are 
also added to InDesign documents when you import text with styles from Microsoft Word.
2 Using the Type tool ( ), click an insertion point anywhere in the main article you 
placed. Then choose Edit > Select All to select all the body text in the story. Notice that 
the sidebar text is not selected; this text belongs to a different story.

Loading styles from another document
Styles appear only in the document in which you create them. However, it’s easy to 
share styles between InDesign documents by loading, or importing, styles from other 
InDesign documents. In this exercise you will take styles from another Sonata Cycles 
document. This other document includes several styles that will work well for the text 
in this newsletter. Instead of re-creating these styles, you’ll load the styles from the other 
document and apply them to text in the newsletter.
1 Click the palette menu button (to the right of the Paragraph Styles tab), and choose 
Load All Styles from the Paragraph Styles palette menu. 
2 In the Open a File dialog box, double-click Styles.indd from the ID_04 folder. In the 
Paragraph Styles palette, notice the new styles called Sidebar Copy and Sidebar Head. 
You may need to scroll through the list or resize the palette to see these additional styles.
3 In the document window, change the view so that you can see the sidebar 
(“Upcoming Cycling Events”) on page 1.
4 Using the Type tool ( ), click an insertion point in the sidebar, and then choose Edit

7 In the Paragraph Styles palette, select Sidebar Head. 
Before and after applying Sidebar Head paragraph style.
Vertically aligning text 
To evenly distribute the space on the top and bottom of the text frame, you will center 
the text vertically using vertical justiﬁ cation.
1 With the insertion point anywhere in the sidebar frame, choose Object > Text Frame 
Options.
2 Under Vertical Justiﬁ cation, for Align, select Justify, and then click OK.
3 Choose File > Save.
Note: If the text frame extends over the green artwork framing the text, you may not be able 
to read the bottom line of text. To ﬁ x this, you can select the middle handle at the lower edge 
of the frame and drag it upwards, just as you did in “Resizing a text frame” on page 156. 
Because the text is set to be justiﬁ ed vertically, the spacing between lines re-adjusts when 
you release the mouse.
You have ﬁ nished formatting the ﬁ rst page of the newsletter.

Threading text
When you autoﬂ owed text into the document, InDesign created links between the 
frames so that text would ﬂ ow from one frame to another. These links are called threads. 
You can break the threads between frames, add new frames between the threaded 
frames, and rearrange how frames are threaded.
1 In the Pages palette, double-click the numbers below the page 2–3 icons. If the entire 
spread does not automatically appear in the document window, choose View > Fit 
Spread in Window to view the spread.
2 Select the Selection tool ( ), and then click the text frame in the right column on 
page 2 to select it.
3 Choose View > Show Text Threads. Blue lines appear that represent the connections 
(threads) between text frames in the selected story. Each thread goes from the out port 
of one frame to the in port of the next frame in the sequence.
4 With the text frame in the right column of page 2 still selected, press Backspace or 
Delete to delete this text frame. Click to select a different frame in the story so that the 
text threads become visible.
After deleting a threaded frame.
Note: Text threads only display when a frame within the text ﬂ ow is selected.
Notice that the text ﬂ ows from the left column on page 2 to the left column on page 3. 
Although the text frame was deleted, no text in the story was deleted—it ﬂ owed into the 
next frame.
5 Press Ctrl+D (Windows) or Command+D (Mac OS) to open the Place dialog box. If 
necessary, deselect Replace Selected Item and Show Import Option and then locate and

6 Click the loaded graphics icon in the upper left corner of the blank column, just 
below the guide. If necessary, after placing the graphic, drag the picture so that it snaps 
to the top margin of the column.
You’ll ﬁ ll the space under the picture by creating a new text frame and threading the 
placed story through the new frame. To thread a new frame in the middle of a story, you 
can click the out port of the previous frame or the in port of the subsequent frame.
7 Holding down Ctrl (Windows) or Command (Mac OS) drag a guide from the 
horizontal ruler to the 28p mark. Holding the modiﬁ er key applies the guide across the 
entire spread rather than the entire page.
 For accuracy, hold down Shift as you drag to move the guide in 1p increments, or you 
can select the guide with the Selection tool and then type 28p in the Y box of the Transform 
palette.
8 Click the left text frame on page 2 to select it, and then click the out port in the lower 
right corner of the frame. The out port then appears as a blue arrow, indicating that the 
story is continued in another frame.

Changing the number of columns on a page
You will now create a full-page sidebar on page 3 that provides three different bike 
routes for the newsletter readers. To simplify creating the three text frames for these 
routes, you will change the number of columns on page 3. 
1 In the Pages palette, double-click the page 3 icon to center the page in the document 
window. Make sure that only page 3 in the Pages palette is highlighted so that the 
column change will affect only page 3. If necessary, click another page icon, and then 
click the page 3 icon.

2 Choose Layout > Margins and Columns. Under Columns, type 3 for Number and 
click OK.
Even though the number of columns changed, the widths of the existing text frames did not change.
Notice that the text frames are independent of the number of columns. Column 
margins can determine how text frames are created, but the text frame widths do 
not change when you redeﬁ ne columns. One exception to this rule is when Layout 
Adjustment is turned on—you can learn more about Layout Adjustment in “On your 
own” at the end of this lesson.
3 Using the Selection tool ( ), select a text frame on page 3 and press Backspace or 
Delete.
4 Select the other text frame on page 3 and press Backspace or Delete. Both text frames 
on page 3 should be deleted.
Once again, you have deleted text frames, but you did not delete any text; the text ﬂ owed 
into the text frames on page 4. Now you’ll place an  Adobe Illustrator ﬁ le that has been 
sized to ﬁ t within the newsletter page.
5 Press Ctrl+D (Windows) or Command+D (Mac OS) to open the Place dialog box. 
Deselect Show Import Options, then locate and double-click 04_f.ai in the ID_04 folder.

Applying and editing the sidebar styles
To make the text consistent with the rest of the newsletter, you’ll apply the sidebar styles 
to the text you just added. You will also edit the Sidebar Head style so that each heading 
starts at the top of the next column. You’ll start by using the keyboard to select all the 
text in the story.
1 Using the Type tool ( ), click an insertion point in the sidebar. Then press Ctrl+A 
(Windows) or Command+A (Mac OS) to select all the text in the story.
2 Select the Sidebar Copy style in the Paragraph Styles palette.
3 Click an insertion point inside the “Wacatchee State Trail” heading, and then select 
the Sidebar Head style in the Paragraph Styles palette.
4 Apply the Sidebar Head style to the other two headings, “Bear Hollow” and “Ridge 
Trail.”
To ensure that the headings will always appear at the top of each frame, you’ll edit the 
sidebar heading style.
5 Before you edit the style, deselect all text.
6 In the Paragraph Styles palette, double-click Sidebar Head to open the Modify 
Paragraph Style Options dialog box for that style.

InDesign’s word-processing features to add ﬁ nishing touches to the text throughout the 
newsletter.
8 Save the ﬁ le.
 The context menu gives you another way to move text to the beginning of the next 
column. To do this, make sure that the cursor is in the place where you want to create the 
break, and then right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) the text frame to open the 
context menu. Choose Insert  Break Character > Column Break. You can also use context 
menu commands to move text to the next frame, page, odd page, or even page.
Adding a page continuation note
Because the story on page 2 links to another page, you can let readers know where they 
can resume reading when they get to the bottom of the page. To do this you will add 
a “(Continued on page x)” frame. You can add an automatic page number that will 
automatically reﬂ ect the number of the next page in the text ﬂ ow.
1 Center page 2 in the document window by scrolling or using the Pages palette.

Creating and applying a character style
In this lesson, you have applied and loaded paragraph styles. Now you’ll learn how to 
create a character style. A character style allows you to apply consistent formatting to 
words or groups of words throughout a document. They can be applied to speciﬁ ed 
text within the body text. You can use the same methods to create character styles and 
paragraph styles. You can create a style based on formatted text, or you can create a style 
using the New Character Style dialog box.
Here you’ll apply formatting to text and create a new character style based on that text. 
You’ll then apply the formatting to names of bicycles in a story.

Finding text and changing formatting
You will search for occurrences of the word “Lincoln” in this document. Make sure 
that your view-magniﬁ cation level is set so that you can easily read the text and see the 
formatting. You do not have to have anything selected for this procedure.

the book, Lincoln. You want to remove the underlining and replace it with italics. 
1 Choose Edit > Find/Change. For Find What, type Lincoln.
2 Press Tab to move to the Change To box, and make certain that the Change To box is 
empty. For Search, make sure Document is selected. 
These settings tell InDesign to search all text frames throughout the document for 
the word Lincoln and to keep the same word. Next we will tell InDesign to change the 
format of the words it locates.

LESSON 4
Spell-checking a story
The text in the “Bad Clams” story on page 5 includes Spanish and Italian phrases. Before 
you spell-check the story, you will assign the appropriate language to each phrase. 
InDesign includes the ability to spell check and hyphenate text using multiple languages.
1 In the document window, turn to page 5. Change your view so that you can 
comfortably read the paragraph below the image in the right column.
2 In the paragraph in the right column beginning “William Johnson,” use the Type tool 
( ) to select “¡Yo tengo un cuaderno rojo!” 
3 In the Character palette, choose Spanish: Castilian from the Language menu.
Assigning languages lets you spell check a document more accurately and efﬁ ciently.
Note: If you do not see the Spanish and other dictionaries on the Language menu, either 
your dictionaries have been deleted from your hard disk or your installation of InDesign 
did not include them. To install the dictionaries you need for this task, save your ﬁ le, 
quit all programs, and insert your InDesign application CD into your computer CD-
ROM drive. Open the CD and double-click the installation icon. Follow the on-screen 
instructions for a custom installation, specifying only the dictionaries. You do not need to 
reinstall the InDesign program, only the dictionaries need to be installed. Then reopen your 
04_News.indd ﬁ le and resume your work.
4 In the same paragraph, select “Sono il campione dell mondo” (This is intentionally 
misspelled). In the Character palette, choose Italian from the Language menu.
The text may shift when you apply the language attribute. This occurs because 
hyphenation rules are different for English and Italian.
5 Make sure that the insertion point is in the same paragraph, and choose Edit > 
Check Spelling.
6 For Search, select Story so you don’t have to spell-check the entire document.

Creating text on a path
You can create type that ﬂ ows along the edge of an open or closed path of any shape. 
For this lesson, you will draw a circle around the Mr. Tuneup graphic on page 8, and 
then ﬂ ow type around the circle.
1 Choose 8 from the Page pop-up menu at the bottom of the document window to 
turn to page 8.
2 Using the Selection tool ( ), click the graphic above “It’s Mr. Tuneup.” Notice the 
center point of the graphic. You will use this center point to help you draw the circle.
3 Hold down the mouse on the Rectangle tool in the toolbox, and select the Ellipse tool 
(
). Make sure that None is selected in the toolbox Fill box.
4 
Holding down Alt+Shift (Windows) or Option+Shift (Mac OS), place the pointer 
over the center point of the graphic and drag outward to create a circle slightly larger 
than the Mr. Tuneup graphic (about 19 picas, as shown in the Transform palette for W 
and H).
The Shift key constrains the shape to a circle; the Alt or Option key makes the center of 
the circle the starting point of your drawing so that you draw outward from the center.
5 Using the Type tool ( ), select the ﬁ rst two lines below the graphic, “It’s Mr. Tuneup! 
The Maestro Mechanic of Sonata Cycles.”

If you click an insertion point on a path, the range of type will extend along the entire 
path. If you drag, type will appear only along the length speciﬁ ed when you dragged.
9 Choose Edit > Paste.
The plus sign (+) in the out port at the end of the text on the path indicates overset 
text. To display all the text on the path, you will adjust the path type’s start and end 
indicators, which are the blue lines that appear before and after the pasted text.
10 Select the Direct Selection tool ( ) and move it over the blue indicator at the 
beginning of the text path. When the Direct Selection pointer is properly positioned, it

When you changed the number of columns in this lesson, the size of the text frames 
remained unchanged. However, if you need to change your document setup after you’ve 
begun laying out your document, you can turn on the Layout Adjustment option, which 
can save you time in reformatting your document. Try this:
1 Go to page 4 and choose Layout > Layout Adjustment. Select Enable Layout 
Adjustment and click OK. Now change the number of columns using the control

In this lesson, we covered only the basics of creating and applying styles. If you do a lot 
of your writing in InDesign, you’ll want to learn how Next Style works and how to apply 
styles using shortcut keystrokes.
Note: In Windows, Num Lock must be on for the following shortcut keystrokes to work.
3 With no text selected, double-click the Head 2 style in the Paragraph Styles palette. 
Click an insertion point in the Shortcut text box. Using numbers from only the keypad, 
press Ctrl+Alt+2 (Windows) or Command+Option+2 (Mac OS). For Next Style, select 
Body Copy. Click OK to close the dialog box. Now practice applying the Head 2 style 
using your keyboard shortcut. Notice that when you press Enter or Return at the end of 
a Head 2 paragraph, the next paragraph automatically has the Body Copy style.
Note: If text does not appear in the Shortcut text box, make sure that you use the numbers 
from the numeric keypad. In Windows, make sure that Num Lock is on.
4 Some designers prefer not to indent the ﬁ rst paragraph after a heading. Create a 
paragraph style called “Body Copy No Indent” that is based on Body Copy and does 
not have a ﬁ rst-line indent. For the Next Style option in Body Copy No Indent, select 
Body Copy. Edit the heading styles so that the Next Style option is set to Body Copy No 
Indent.

1 How do you autoﬂ ow text? How do you ﬂ ow text one frame at a time?
2 How can using styles save time?
3 When searching for text using the Find/Change command, you get a “Cannot ﬁ nd 
match” message. What are some reasons InDesign failed to ﬁ nd a match?
4 While spell-checking your document, InDesign ﬂ ags words used in other languages. 
How can you ﬁ x this problem?
Review answers
1 When the loaded text icon appears after using the Place command or clicking an out 
port, hold down Shift and click. To ﬂ ow text one frame at a time, you can hold down Alt 
(Windows) or Option (Mac OS) to reload the text icon after you click or drag to create a 
frame.
2 Styles save time by letting you keep a group of formatting attributes together that 
you can quickly apply to text. If you need to update the text, you don’t have to change 
each paragraph formatted with the style individually. Instead, you can simply modify 
the style.
3 If you get a “Cannot ﬁ nd match” message, you may not have typed the text properly, 
you may have selected Whole Word or Case Sensitive, or you may not have cleared 
formatting used in a previous search. Another possibility is that you selected Story 
for Search while the text you’re looking for is in a different story. Finally, you may be 
searching for text that does not exist in your document.
4 Before you spell-check your document, select any phrase from a different language

LESSON 5
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
•  Prepare and use a baseline grid.
•  Change type spacing and appearance.
•  Create special characters.
•  Create a tabbed table with tab leaders and hanging indents.
•  Insert special characters in text using Open Type fonts.
Getting started
In this lesson, you’ll create one two-page spread for the annual report of the Sonata 
Cycles company. Your work in this sample ﬁ le will involve using one of the Open Type 
fonts that shipped on the application CD with Adobe InDesign CS. 
Before you begin, you should restore the default preferences for Adobe InDesign. 
1 To ensure that the tools and palettes function exactly as described in this lesson, 
delete or deactivate (by renaming) the InDesign Defaults ﬁ le and the InDesign 
SavedData ﬁ le. See “Restoring default preferences” on page 2. 
2 Start Adobe InDesign.
To begin working, you’ll open an existing InDesign document.
3 Choose File > Open, and open the 05_a.indd ﬁ le in the ID_05 folder, located inside 
the Lessons folder within the IDCIB folder on your hard disk.
Note: If you have not already copied the resource ﬁ les for this lesson onto your hard disk 
from the ID_05 folder from the Adobe InDesign CS Classroom in a Book CD, do so now. 
See “Copying the Classroom in a Book ﬁ les” on page 2.

When you’re ready to resume working on the lesson document, choose its name from 
the Window menu.
Adjusting vertical spacing
InDesign provides several options for customizing and adjusting the vertical spacing in 
your document. You can:
• Set the space between all lines of text using a baseline grid. 
• Set the space between each line using the Leading option in the Character palette.
• Set the space between each paragraph separately using the Space Before/Space After 
options in the Paragraph palette.
• Use the Vertical Justiﬁ cation options in the Text Frame Options dialog box to  align 
text within a frame.
In this section of the lesson, you will use the baseline grid to align text.

LESSON 5
Using a  baseline grid to  align text
Once you’ve decided on the font size and leading for your document’s body text, you 
may want to set up a baseline grid (also called a leading grid) for the entire document. 
Baseline grids represent the leading for your document’s body text and are used to align 
the baseline of type in one column of text with the baseline of type in neighboring 
columns. 
Before you set the baseline grid, you’ll want to check the margin value for the top of 
your document and the leading value for the body text. These elements work together 
with the grid to create a cohesive design.
1 To view the top margin value for the page, choose Layout > Margins and Columns. 
The top margin is set to 6p0 (6 picas, 0 points). Click Cancel to close the dialog box.
2 
To determine the leading value, select the Type tool ( ) in the toolbox and click in a 
body-text paragraph. Then click the Character palette tab (or choose Type > Character) 
to make the palette visible. Check the leading value (
) in the Character palette. The 
leading is set to 14 pt (14 points).
3 Choose Edit > Preferences > Grids (Windows, Mac OS) or InDesign > Preferences > 
Grids (Mac OS) to set your grid options. In the Baseline Grid section, type 6 for Start to 
match your top margin setting of 6p0. This option sets the location of the ﬁ rst grid line 
for the document. If you use InDesign’s default value of 3p0, the ﬁ rst grid line would 
appear above the top margin.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 193
Classroom in a Book
4 For Increment Every, type 14pt to match your leading. When you select another 
option, InDesign automatically converts the points value to picas (to 1p2). 
5 Choose 100% for View Threshold. 
The View Threshold option sets the minimum value at which you can see the grid on-
screen. At 100%, the grid appears in the document window only at magniﬁ cations of 
100% or higher.
6 Click OK to close the dialog box.

LESSON 5
Viewing the baseline grid
Now you’ll make the grid you just set up visible on-screen.
1 To view the grid in the document window, choose View > Show Baseline Grid. 
The grid does not appear because the document view is lower than the grid’s View 
Threshold value. Choose 100% from the magniﬁ cation menu at the lower left corner of 
the document window—the grid now appears on-screen.
Now you’ll use the Paragraph palette to align all the text to the grid. You can align 
multiple stories independently of one another, or all at once. You’ll align all the stories 
in this spread simultaneously.
2 Click the Paragraph tab (or choose Type > Paragraph) to make the palette visible.
3 With the Type tool still selected, click an insertion point anywhere in the ﬁ rst 
paragraph on the spread, and then choose Edit > Select All to select all the text in the 
main story. 
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 195

 When applying paragraph attributes, it is not necessary to select an entire paragraph 
with the Type tool. Just select a portion of the paragraph or paragraphs you want to format. 
If you are formatting only one paragraph, you can simply click in the paragraph to make an 
insertion point.
4 In the Paragraph palette, click the  Align to Baseline Grid button (
). The text shifts 
so that the baselines of the characters rest on the grid lines.
Before and after aligning the text to the baseline grid.
5 If necessary, scroll to the left side of the spread so you can see the pull quote on the 
side of the page; then click an insertion point in the pull quote. 
6 
In the Paragraph palette, click the Align to Baseline Grid button. Because this text 
is formatted using 18 point leading, not the baseline grid leading value of 14pt or 1p2, 
aligning to the grid causes the text to expand to every other grid line (using 28 point 
leading).

LESSON 5
Changing the spacing above and below paragraphs
When you apply a space before or after a paragraph that you have previously aligned to 
the grid, the space automatically adjusts to the next highest multiple of the grid value. 
For example, if your grid is set to 14 points (1p2) and you specify Space After of any 
value under 14, InDesign automatically increases the space value to 14; if you specify a 
value over 14, such as 16, InDesign increases it to the next higher multiple—28. You can 
use the Space Before or Space After value instead of the Baseline Grid value, by selecting 
the Do Not Align to Baseline Grid option for the affected paragraph.
No space (left), space adjusted to ﬁ t grid at 28 pt (middle), and actual space value at 16 pt (right).
Here you’ll increase the space below the second paragraph of the main story. All other 
paragraphs in the spread have already been formatted with a 1p2 Space After value. 
1 Make sure that the Type tool ( ) is still selected, and click anywhere in the second 
paragraph on the page on the left (page 2).
2 In the Paragraph palette, type 1p2 for Space After (
) and press Enter or Return. 
The text in the next heading shifts automatically to the next grid line.
Before and after applying a Space After value to the upper paragraph.

Now you’ll increase the space before the heading “The Dos Ventanas Cycling 
Partnership” to give it even more space. 
3 
Click an insertion point in the heading “The Dos Ventanas Cycling Partnership.” In 
the Paragraph palette, type 0p6 for Space Before (
) and then press Enter or Return. 
Because you previously aligned the heading to the baseline grid, the Space Before jumps 
to 14 points instead of 6 points. 
To use the 0p6 value instead of 14, and to add more space between the heading and the 
following paragraph, you’ll unalign the heading from the grid. 
4 With an insertion point still in the heading “The Dos Ventanas Cycling Partnership,” 
click the Do Not Align to Baseline Grid button (
) in the Paragraph palette. The 
heading shifts upward a bit, away from the body text below.
Before and after unaligning the heading from the baseline grid.
This heading and the heading on the page on the right (page 3) are formatted using 
the Head 1 style. To automatically update the second heading so that it uses the same 
spacing values as the heading you just edited, you’ll redeﬁ ne the style.
5 Click the Paragraph Styles palette tab (or choose Type > Paragraph Styles) to make 
the palette visible.
6 Click an insertion point in the heading “The Dos Ventanas Cycling Partnership.” 
Notice that a plus sign (+) appears after the Head 1 style name in the palette. This sign

Changing fonts and type style
Changing the fonts and type styles of text can make a dramatic difference in the 
appearance of your document. Here you’ll change the font family, type style, and size 
for the text in one of the pull quotes along the border of the spread. You’ll make these 
changes using the Character palette. 
About fonts
A font is a complete set of characters—letters, numbers, and symbols—that share a common weight, width, 
and style, such as 10-pt Adobe Garamond Pro Bold.
Typefaces (often called type families or font families) are collections of fonts that share an overall 
appearance, and are designed to be used together, such as Adobe Garamond Pro .
A Type Style is a variant version of an individual font in a font family. Typically, the Roman or Plain (the 
actual name varies from family to family) member of a font family is the base font, which may include 
type styles such as regular, bold, semibold, italic, and bold italic.

 Some of the more commonly used glyphs, such as the copyright and trademark symbols 
are also available from the context menu by right-clicking (Windows) or Control-Clicking 
(Mac OS) at the text insertion point.

Changing paragraph alignment
You can easily manipulate how a paragraph ﬁ ts in its text frame by changing the 
horizontal alignment. You can  align text with one or both edges of a text frame or text-
frame inset. Justifying text aligns both the left and right edges. In this section, you’ll 
justify the pull quote.

You’re ﬁ nished with the Glyphs palette for this lesson so you can close it now, and then 
save your work.
Note: This font may display many more glyphs than you are accustomed to seeing because 
it is an OpenType font. OpenType fonts are able to carry many more characters and 
glyph alternates than earlier PostScript typefaces. But Adobe’s OpenType fonts are built 
on the same foundation as PostScript. For more information about OpenType fonts, visit 
www.adobe.com/type.
Notice how the word spacing in the last line of the pull quote has an overly large space 
in the center. You can address this by adding a ﬂ ush space to the end of the paragraph. A 
ﬂ ush space adds a variable amount of space to the last line of a fully justiﬁ ed paragraph. 
You’ll insert the ﬂ ush space between the period and the decorative end-of-story 
character you just added.

Applying special font features
You can add creative touches to your document using the special InDesign font features. 
For example, you can make the ﬁ rst character or word in a paragraph a drop cap, or 
apply a gradient or color ﬁ ll to text. Other features include superscript and subscript 
characters, along with ligatures and oldstyle numerals for font families with these 
features. 
Applying a gradient to text
InDesign makes it easy to apply gradients to the ﬁ ll and stroke of text characters. You 
can apply gradients to an entire text frame or to different character ranges within a 
frame. Here you’ll apply a gradient to the pull quote on page 2. You’ll use a gradient 
swatch that was previously created and added to the Swatches palette. 
1 Click the Swatches palette tab (or choose Window > Swatches) to make the palette

Adjusting letter and word spacing
You can change the spacing between words and letters using InDesign’s kerning and 
tracking features. You can also control the overall spacing of text in a paragraph by using 
the single-line or multi-line composers.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 209

About tracking and kerning 
Kerning is the process of adding or subtracting space between speciﬁ c pairs of characters. Tracking is the 
process of loosening or tightening a block of text.
You can automatically kern type using metrics kerning or optical kerning. Metrics kerning uses kern pairs, 
which are included with most fonts. Kern pairs contain information about the spacing of speciﬁ c pairs of 
characters. A sample of these are: LA, P., To, Tr, Ta, Tu, Te, Ty, Wa, WA, We, Wo, Ya, Yo, and yo. InDesign 
uses metrics kerning by default so kern pairs are automatically honored when you import or type text.
Some fonts include robust kern-pair speciﬁ cations. However, when a font includes only minimal built-in 
kerning or none at all, or if you use two different typefaces or sizes in one or more words on a line, you may 
want to use the optical kerning option. Optical kerning adjusts the spacing between adjacent characters 
based on their shapes. 
–From Adobe InDesign CS online Help.
Adjusting the kerning and tracking
With InDesign you can control the space between letters by using the kerning and 
tracking features. Kerning is the process of adding or subtracting space between speciﬁ c 
letter pairs. Tracking is the process of creating an equal amount of spacing across a 
range of letters. You can use both kerning and tracking on the same text.
Here you’ll manually kern some letters in the heading “The Dos Ventanas Cycling 
Partnership” to close up noticeable gaps. Then you’ll track the heading to bring it all 
onto one line. 
1 To distinguish the amount of space between letters more easily and to see the 
results of the kerning more clearly, select the Zoom tool (
) in the toolbox and drag a 
marquee around the heading “The Dos Ventanas Cycling Partnership.” 
2 If necessary, increase the zoom level in the magniﬁ cation menu in the lower left 
corner of the document window.
3 Select the Type tool ( ) and click an insertion point between the “V” and the “e” in 
the word “Ventanas.” 
4 Press Alt+Left Arrow (Windows) or Option+Left Arrow (Mac OS) to move the letter 
“e” to the left. Press this key combination repeatedly until the two adjacent letters look 
visually pleasing to you. We pressed it four times.

Note: The kerning value changes in the Character palette as you press the key combination. 
You can also use the Character palette to make these changes if you prefer.
Before and after kerning.
5 If you’ve moved the letter too far, press Alt+Right Arrow (Windows) or 
Option+Right Arrow (Mac OS) to move the letter to the right.
6 Click an insertion point between the “P” and the “a” in the word “Partnership.” 
7 Press Alt/Option+Left Arrow to move the letter “a” to the left. Press this key 
combination repeatedly until the two adjacent letters look visually pleasing to you. We 
pressed it four times.
Before and after kerning.
Now you’ll set a tracking value for the entire heading “The Dos Ventanas Cycling 
Partnership” to condense the overall spacing and bring it all onto one line. To set 
tracking you must ﬁ rst select the entire range of characters you want to track. 
8 Choose 200% from the magniﬁ cation menu at the lower left corner of the document 
window to view more of the page on-screen.

Applying the paragraph and single-line composers
The density of a paragraph (sometimes called its color) is determined by the 
composition method used. When composing text, InDesign considers the word 
spacing, letter spacing, glyph scaling, and hyphenation options you’ve selected, and 
then evaluates and chooses the best line breaks. InDesign provides two options for 
composing text: the paragraph composer, which looks at all the lines in the paragraph, 
or the single-line composer, which looks separately at each individual line. 
When you use the paragraph composer, InDesign composes a line by considering the 
impact on the other lines in the paragraph; in the end, the best overall arrangement 
of the paragraph is established. As you change type in a given line, previous and 
subsequent lines in the same paragraph may break differently, making the overall 
paragraph appear more evenly spaced. When you use the single-line composer, which 
is the standard for other layout and word-processing programs, only the lines following 
the edited text are recomposed.
The text in this lesson was composed using the default, the Adobe Paragraph Composer. 
To see the difference between the two, you’ll recompose the pull quote text using the 
single-line composer.

LESSON 5
1 With the Type tool ( ) still selected, click an insertion point in the pull quote on 
page 2. 
2 Click the Paragraph tab (or choose Type > Paragraph). Choose Adobe Single-line 
Composer from the Paragraph palette menu.
The single-line composer looks at each line individually and, consequently, can make 
some lines in a paragraph appear more dense or sparse than others. 
Because the paragraph composer looks at multiple lines at once, it makes the density of 
the lines in a paragraph more consistent.

Working with tabs
You can use tabs to position text in speciﬁ c horizontal locations in a frame. Using the 
Tabs palette, you can organize text and create tab leaders, indents, and hanging indents. 
Here you’ll format the information at the top of page 3 using the Tabs palette. The tab 
markers have already been entered in the text, so all you will be doing is setting the ﬁ nal 
location of the text.
1 If necessary, scroll to the top of page 3 until the table appears on-screen. 
2 To view the tab markers in the table, choose Type > Show Hidden Characters, and 
make sure that Normal View Mode (
) is selected in the toolbox. If you decide not to 
keep them showing as you work, choose Type > Hide Hidden Characters.
3 Using the Type tool ( ), click in the word “Category” at the top of the table.
4 Choose Type > Tabs to open the Tabs palette. When an insertion point is in a text 
frame, the Tabs palette snaps to the border of the frame so that the measurements in the 
palette’s ruler exactly match the text.

9 In the Tabs palette, position the pointer in the top third of the ruler, just above the 
numbers, and then click to set tab markers at the following locations: 24, 29, 34, 40, and 
45. You can view the location of the pointer on the ruler in the X: text box (above the 
left side of the ruler). To precisely set the value, drag in the ruler while watching the X 
value before releasing the mouse button or type the value directly into the X value of the 
Tabs palette. 
The value in the X: text box indicates the location of the selected tab.
Note: If you don’t get the tab locations correct the ﬁ rst time, you can select the tab in the 
ruler and type the location in the X value. You can also click on a tab in the Tabs palette 
and drag up to remove a tab.
10 Press Shift+Ctrl+A (Windows) or Shift+Command+A (Mac OS) to deselect the 
text and view the new tab settings.
Now you’ll set a tab leader for some of the tabs.

12 In the Tabs palette, click the ﬁ rst tab arrow along the ruler to select it so that the 
leader you create will affect any selected tabs at that tab marker.
13 In the Leader text box, type ._ (period, space) and press Enter or Return. You can 
use any character as a tab leader. We used a space between periods to create a more open 
dot sequence.
14 Deselect the table text and view the leaders.
Creating a hanging indent
Now you’ll use the Tabs palette to create hanging indents. The text frame for this table 
has an inset value of 6 points at the top and 9 points on the sides and bottom. (To see 
the inset values, choose Object > Text Frame Options.) An inset sets the text apart from 
the frame; now you’ll set it apart even more by indenting the three categories in the 
table.

You can set an indent in the Tabs palette or the Paragraph palette. You’ll keep the 
Paragraph palette visible so you can see how the values change there, too.
1 Make sure that the Paragraph palette is visible. If necessary, select Type > Paragraph.
2 In the table, use the Type tool ( ) to select all the text from “Mountain” to 
“$110,000.”
3 Make sure that the Tabs palette is still aligned directly above the table. If it has 
moved, click the magnet icon (

4 In the Tabs palette, drag the indent markers ( ) on the left side of the ruler to the 
right until the X value is 2p0. Dragging the bottom marker moves both at once. Notice 
how all the text shifts to the right and the indent option in the Paragraph palette 
changes to 2p0. Keep the text selected.
Now you’ll bring just the category headings back to their original location in the table to 
create a hanging indent.

Review questions
1 How do you view a baseline grid?
2 When and where do you use a ﬂ ush space?
3 How do you apply a gradient to only a few words or characters in a paragraph?
4 What is the difference between the multi-line composer and the single-line 
composer?
Review answers
1 To view a baseline grid, choose View > Show Baseline Grid. The current document 
view must be at or above the View Threshold set in the Baseline Grid preferences. By 
default, that value is 75%.
2 You use a ﬂ ush space on justiﬁ ed text. For example, if used with a special character 
or decorative font at the end of a paragraph, it absorbs any extra space in the last line.
3 To apply a gradient to a speciﬁ c range of characters, you ﬁ rst select the text with the 
Type tool. Next, you apply the gradient to the text. If the entire range of colors does not 
appear, select the gradient tool and drag from one end of the selected text to the other 
in the direction you want the gradient to ﬂ ow.
4 The multi-line composer evaluates multiple lines at once when determining the best 
possible line breaks. The single-line composer looks at only one line at a time when 
determining line breaks.

Working with Color
LESSON 6
In this introduction to working with colors, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Add colors to the Swatches palette. 
• Apply colors to objects. 
• Create dashed strokes. 
• Create and apply a gradient swatch. 
• Adjust the direction of the gradient blend. 
• Create a tint. 
• Create a spot color. 
Getting started
In this lesson, you’ll work on a 2-page spread for a magazine article about origami. If 
you’ve gone through several of the previous lessons, the design of this document will 
look somewhat familiar. The document includes two layers (Art and Text), two master 
pages (B is based on A), and a separate main story and sidebar. Before you begin, 
you’ll need to restore the default preferences for Adobe InDesign. Then you’ll open the 
ﬁ nished document for this lesson to see what you’ll be creating.
1 To ensure that the tools and palettes function exactly as described in this lesson, 
delete or deactivate (by renaming) the InDesign Defaults ﬁ le and the InDesign 
SavedData ﬁ le. See “Restoring default preferences” on page 2. 
2 Start Adobe InDesign.
3 Choose File > Open, and open the 06_a.indd ﬁ le in the ID_06 folder, located inside 
the Lessons folder within the IDCIB folder on your hard disk
Note: If you have not already copied the resource ﬁ les for this lesson onto your hard disk 
from the ID_06 folder from the Adobe InDesign CS Classroom in a Book CD, do so now. 
See “Copying the Classroom in a Book ﬁ les” on page 2.
4 Choose File > Save As, rename the ﬁ le 06_Color.indd, and save it in the ID_06 folder.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 227

5 If you want to see what the ﬁ nished document will look like, open the 06_b.indd 
ﬁ le in the same folder. You can leave this document open to act as a guide as you work. 
When you’re ready to resume working on the lesson document, choose its name from 
the Window menu.
Note: As you work through the lesson, feel free to move palettes around or change the 
magniﬁ cation to a level that works best for you. For more information, see “Changing the 
magniﬁ cation of your document” on page 53 and “Using the Navigator palette” on page 60.
Deﬁ ning printing requirements
It’s a good idea to know printing requirements before you start working on a document. 
For example, meet with your prepress service provider and discuss your document’s 
design and use of color. Because your prepress service provider understands the 
capabilities of their equipment, they may suggest ways for you to save time and money, 
increase quality, and avoid potentially costly printing or color problems. The magazine 
article used in this lesson was designed to be printed by a commercial printer using the 
CMYK color model.
Adding colors to the Swatches palette
You can add color to objects using a combination of palettes and tools. The InDesign 
color workﬂ ow revolves around the Swatches palette. Using the Swatches palette to 
name colors makes it easy to apply, edit, and update colors for objects in a document. 
Although you can also use the Color palette to apply colors to objects, there is no quick 
way to update these colors, called unnamed colors. Instead, you’d have to update the 
color of each object individually.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

228
Working with Color
LESSON 6
You’ll now create most of the colors you’ll use in this document. Since this document is 
intended for a commercial press, you’ll be creating CMYK process colors.
1 Make sure that no objects are selected, and then click the Swatches palette tab. (If the 
Swatches palette is not visible, choose Window > Swatches.)
The Swatches palette stores the colors that have been preloaded into InDesign, as well as 
the colors, tints, and gradients you create and store for reuse.
2 Choose New Color Swatch from the Swatches palette menu.
3 Deselect Name With Color Value, and for Swatch Name, type Purple. Make sure that 
Color Type and Color Mode are set to Process and CMYK, respectively.
The Name With Color Value option names a color using the CMYK color values that 
you enter, and automatically updates the name if you change the value. This option 
is available only for process colors and is useful when you want to use the Swatches 
palette to monitor the exact composition of process-color swatches. For this swatch 
you deselected the Name With Color Value option, so that you can use a name (Purple) 
that’s easier to read for this lesson.
4 For the color percentages, type the following values: C = 67, M = 74, 
Y = 19, and B = 12, and then click OK.

 If you forget to type the name for a color or if you type an incorrect value, double-click 
the swatch, change the name or value, and then click OK.
New colors added to the Swatches palette are stored only with the document in 
which they are created. You’ll apply these colors to text, graphics, and frames in your 
document.
Applying colors to objects
There are three general steps to applying a swatch color: (1) selecting the text or object, 
(2) selecting either stroke or ﬁ ll in the toolbox, depending on what you want to change, 
and (3) selecting the color in the Swatches palette. You can also drag swatches from the 
Swatches palette to objects.
1 Select the Selection tool ( ), and click the path or one of the lines in any one of the 
diamond shapes at the top of the right page to select it.
Notice that these three objects are grouped, so all are now selected. You will ungroup 
these objects and lock them in place. Locking objects prevents you from accidentally 
moving them.

2 With the group of objects still selected, choose Object > Ungroup and then choose 
Object > Lock Position.
3 Deselect the objects. To deselect an object, you can choose Edit > Deselect All, 
you can click a blank area in your document window, or you can press Shift+Ctrl+A 
(Windows) or Shift+Command+A (Mac OS).
4 Select the Zoom tool (
) in the toolbox and drag across the three diamonds to draw 
a marquee around the shapes. The view magniﬁ cation changes so that the area deﬁ ned 
by the marquee now ﬁ lls the document window. Make sure that you can see all three 
diamond shapes.
 To ﬁ ne-tune the zoom magniﬁ cation, you can press Ctrl+= (Windows) or Command+= 
(Mac OS). To zoom out, you can press Ctrl+- (Windows) or Command+- (Mac OS).
5 Select the Selection tool ( ), and then click the border of the middle diamond to 
select it. Select the Stroke box (
) in the toolbox, and then click Purple in the Swatches 
palette.
The stroke of the diamond shape is now purple. However, the color is not applied to the 
lines inside the shape because they are separate objects.
6 Deselect the object.
7 Click the border of the left diamond to select it. Select Red in the Swatches palette to 
apply a red stroke.

8 With the left diamond still selected, select the Fill box (
) in the toolbox, and then 
select Gold in the Swatches palette (you may need to scroll down the list of swatches).
The right diamond requires the same Red stroke and Gold ﬁ ll. You’ll use the eyedropper 
to copy the stroke and ﬁ ll attributes from the left diamond in one quick step.
9 Select the Eyedropper tool (
), and click the left diamond. Notice that the 
eyedropper is now ﬁ lled (
), indicating that it picked up the attributes from the clicked 
object.
10 With the ﬁ lled Eyedropper tool, click the white background of the rightmost 
diamond. The right diamond takes on the left diamond’s ﬁ ll and stroke attributes.
Now you’ll change the color of the two diagonal lines in the right diamond.
11 Select the Selection tool ( ), and then deselect the objects.

12 Holding down Shift, select the two diagonal lines inside the right diamond. 
Release Shift. Select the Stroke box (
) in the toolbox, and then select [Paper] in the 
Swatches palette.
[Paper] is a special color that simulates the paper color on which you’re printing. 
Objects behind a paper-colored object won’t print where the paper-colored object 
overlaps them. Instead, the color of the paper on which you print shows through.
Creating dashed strokes
You’ll now change the lines in the center and right diamonds to a custom dashed line. 
Because you will only be using the custom dashed line on one object, you will create 
it using the Stroke palette. If you need to save a stroke for repetitive use throughout 
a document, you can easily create a stroke style. For more information about saving 
Stroke styles, including dashes, dots and stripes, see Adobe InDesign CS online Help.
1 Deselect the objects. Holding down Shift, use the Selection tool ( ) to select the four 
vertical and horizontal lines in the middle and right diamonds. Release Shift.
2 If the Stroke palette is not already visible, choose Window > Stroke to open it, and 
then choose Show Options from the Stroke palette menu to expand the palette so that 
you see several previously hidden options.
3 For Type, select Dashed.

Six dash and gap boxes appear at the bottom of the Stroke palette. To create a dashed 
line, you specify the length of the dash, and then the gap, or spacing, between the 
dashes.
4 Type the following values in the Dash and Gap boxes: 6, 4, 2, 4 (press Tab after you 
type each value to move to the next box). Leave the last two dash and gap boxes empty.
5 Deselect the lines and close the Stroke palette. Then choose File > Save.

Notice that the left side of the gradient ramp is green.
4 Click the right stop marker. For Stop Color, select Swatches, and then scroll down the 
list and select Gold. 
The gradient ramp shows a color blend between green and gold. 
5 Click OK. 
Now you’ll apply the gradient to the ﬁ ll of the middle diamond.

LESSON 6
Adjusting the direction of the gradient blend
Once you have ﬁ lled an object with a gradient, you can modify the gradient by using the 
gradient tool (
) to “repaint” the ﬁ ll along an imaginary line you drag. This tool lets 
you change the direction of a gradient and change the beginning point and endpoint of 
a gradient. You’ll now change the direction of the gradient.
1 Make sure the middle diamond is still selected, and then select the gradient tool (
) 
in the toolbox.
Now you’ll experiment with the gradient tool to see how you can change the direction 
and intensity of the gradient.
2 To create a more gradual gradient effect, place the pointer an inch or so outside the 
selected diamond and drag across and past it.
When you release the mouse button, you’ll notice that the blend between green and gold 
is more gradual than it was before you dragged the gradient tool.

3 To create a sharper gradient, drag a small line in the center of the diamond. Continue 
to experiment with the gradient tool so that you understand how it works.
4 When you have ﬁ nished experimenting, drag from the top corner of the diamond to 
the bottom corner. That’s how you’ll leave the gradient of the middle diamond.
5 Choose File > Save.
Creating a tint
In addition to adding colors, you can also add tints to the Swatches palette. A tint is a 
screened (lighter) version of a color. You’ll now create a 30% tint of the green swatch 
you saved earlier in this lesson.
Tints are helpful because InDesign maintains the relationship between a tint and its 
parent color. For example, if you changed the Green color swatch to a different color, 
the tint swatch you create in this procedure would become a lighter version of the new 
color.

About spot and process color types
A spot color is a special premixed ink that is used instead of, or in addition to, CMYK inks, and  requires 
its own printing plate on a printing press. Use spot color when few colors are speciﬁ ed and color accuracy 
is critical. Spot color inks can accurately reproduce colors that are outside the gamut of process colors. 
However, the exact appearance of the printed spot color is determined by combination of the ink as mixed 
by the commercial printer and the paper it’s printed on, so it isn’t affected by color values you specify or by 
color management. When you specify spot color values, you’re describing the simulated appearance of the 
color for your monitor and composite printer only (subject to the gamut limitations of those devices).
A process color is printed using a combination of four standard process inks: cyan, magenta, yellow, and 
black (CMYK). Use process colors when a job requires so many colors that using individual spot inks would 
be expensive or impractical, such as when printing color photographs. Keep the following guidelines in 
mind when specifying a process color:
•  For best results in a printed document, specify process colors using CMYK values printed in process color 
reference charts, such as those available from a commercial printer.
•  The ﬁ nal color values of a process color are its values in CMYK, so if you specify a process color using 
RGB or LAB, those color values will be converted to CMYK when you print color separations. These 
conversions will work differently if you turn on color management; they’ll be affected by the proﬁ les you’ve 
speciﬁ ed.
•  Don’t specify a process color based on how it looks on your monitor, unless you are sure you have set up 
a color management system properly, and you understand its limitations for previewing color. 
•  Avoid using process colors in documents intended for online viewing only, because CMYK has a smaller 
color gamut than a typical monitor.
Sometimes it’s practical to print process and spot inks on the same job. For example, you might use one spot 
ink to print the exact color of a company logo on the same pages of an annual report where photographs 
are reproduced using process color. You can also use a spot color printing plate to apply a varnish over areas 
of a process color job. In both cases, your print job would use a total of ﬁ ve inks—four process inks and one 
spot ink or varnish. You can mix process and spot colors together to create mixed ink colors.

LESSON 6
Creating a spot color
This publication will be printed by a commercial printer using the standard CMYK 
color model, which requires four separate plates for printing—one each for cyan, 
magenta, yellow, and black. However, the CMYK color model has a limited range of 
colors, which is where spot colors come in handy. Because of this, spot colors are used 
to create additional colors beyond the range of CMYK or to create consistent, individual 
colors such as those used for company logos.
In this publication, the title design calls for a metallic ink not found in the CMYK color 
model. You’ll now add a metallic spot color from a color library.
1 Deselect all objects.
2 In the Swatches palette menu, select New Color Swatch.
3 In the New Color Swatch dialog box, select Spot on the Color Type pop-up menu.
4 In Color Mode, select Pantone Solid Coated.
5 In the PANTONE M text box, type 876 to automatically scroll the list of Pantone 
swatches to the color you want for this project, which is PANTONE 876 M.
 To select an item in a palette using the keyboard, hold down Ctrl+Alt (Windows) or 
Command+Option and click an item in the palette. Then quickly type the color number. In 
this case, you would quickly type 876 to select PANTONE 876 M.
6 Click OK. The metallic spot color is added to your Swatches palette. Notice the icon 
(
) next to the color name in the Swatches palette. This icon indicates that it is a spot 
color.
Note: The color you see on your monitor does not reﬂ ect the actual printed color. To 
determine the color you want to use, look at a chart provided by the color system, such 
as a PANTONE Color Formula Guide, or an ink chart obtained from your printer. Each 
spot color you create generates an additional spot-color plate for the press. In general, 
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 241
Classroom in a Book
commercial printers typically produce either 2 color using black and one spot color, or 4 
color CMYK work with the possibility of adding one or more spot color. Using spot colors 
beyond these can increase your printing costs. It is a good idea to consult with your printer 
before using spot colors in your document. 
Applying color to text
As with frames, you can apply a stroke or ﬁ ll to text itself. You’ll apply colors to the text 
inside the frames on page 2 of the document.
1 In the Pages palette, double-click the page 2 icon to center page 2 in the document 
window.
2 Using the Selection tool ( ), click the word “Origami” to select the title.
3 In the toolbox, make sure the Fill box (
) is selected and then click the small “T” 
icon (the formatting affects text button) in the row below the Fill box. 
4 In the Swatches palette, click PANTONE 876 M, and then click a blank area to 
deselect. The text now appears in the spot color.
Your monitor probably shows the text in a dull brown shade, but the actual printed 
color of the text will be the metallic spot color. Next, you’ll insert another text frame and 
apply colors to the text.
5 Select the Type tool ( ) and triple-click “a short story by” at the bottom of the page 
to select that paragraph.
6 Make sure the Fill box (
) is selected in the toolbox, and then click Purple in the 
Swatches palette.
7 Triple-click “Clyde Bell” to select the name, and then click Red in the Swatches 
palette.

Applying colors to additional objects
Now you’ll apply the same colors used by the small cranes to the large crane image at 
the bottom of the page. First you’ll look at a magniﬁ ed view of one of the small cranes 
to see which colors are used.
1 In the toolbox, select the magniﬁ cation tool (
), and then drag across one of the 
small cranes to zoom in.
2 Select the Direct Selection tool ( ), and then click any of the objects in the 
crane image. Notice that the corresponding swatch in the Swatches palette becomes 
highlighted when you select the object to which the swatch is applied.
Now you’ll apply these colors to the larger image at the bottom of the page.
3 Choose View > Fit Page in Window. Select the Selection tool ( ), and click the large 
image at the bottom of page 2 to select the object. Choose Object > Ungroup.
Notice that the image consists of many smaller shapes grouped together. Now you’ll 
apply orange to two of these shapes.

Shift, click the two objects indicated below, and apply the Orange ﬁ ll color (not the 
Orange tint).
5 Deselect all objects. Drag the Orange 70% ﬁ ll swatch from the Swatches palette to 
the object indicated below. Be sure to drop it inside the object and not on the object’s 
stroke.
Dragging and dropping can be a more convenient way to apply color when an object is 
a large, easy target because you don’t have to select the object ﬁ rst. However, in the next 
step the area is small, so you’ll go back to applying a color by selection.
6 Deselect all objects, select the object indicated below, and apply the Blue ﬁ ll.
 If you applied the color to the wrong object, choose Edit > Undo Swatch and try again.

LESSON 6
Creating another tint
You’ll now create a tint based on the Blue color. When you edit the Blue color, the tint 
that is based on the color will also change.
1 Deselect all objects.
2 Click Blue in the Swatches palette. Choose New Tint Swatch from the Swatches 
palette menu. Type 70 in the Tint box, and then click OK.
3 Select the object shown below and apply the Blue 70% ﬁ ll.
Notice how the large image shares the same colors with the small cranes. Next you’ll 
change the Blue color. Blue 70% is based on the Blue swatch, so the tint will also change.
4 Deselect all objects.
5 Double-click Blue (not the Blue tint) to change the color. For Swatch Name, type 
Violet Blue. For the color percentages, type the following values: C = 59, M = 80, Y = 40, 
B = 0. Click OK.
Notice that the color change affects all objects to which Blue and Blue 70% were 
applied. As you can see, adding colors to the Swatches palette makes it easy to update 
colors in multiple objects.
6 Choose File > Save.
Using advanced gradient techniques
Earlier you created and applied a gradient and adjusted its direction using the gradient 
tool. InDesign also lets you create gradients of multiple colors and control the point at 
which the colors blend. In addition, you can apply a gradient to individual objects or to 
a collection of objects.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 245

Creating a gradient swatch with multiple colors
Earlier in this lesson, you created a gradient with two colors—green and gold. Now 
you’ll create a gradient with three stops so that a green color on the outside will fade to 
white in the middle. Make sure that no objects are selected before you begin.
1 On the Swatches palette menu, choose New Gradient Swatch, and then type Green/
White Gradient for Swatch Name.
The colors from the previous blend appear in the dialog box.
2 Click the left stop marker (
), select Swatches for Stop Color, and make sure that 
Green (not the tinted Green) is selected in the list box. Click the right stop marker 
(
), select Swatches for Stop Color, and make sure that Green (not the tinted Green) is 
selected in the list box.
The gradient ramp is now entirely green. Now you’ll add a stop marker to the middle so 
that the color fades toward the center.
3 Click just below the center of the gradient bar to add a new stop. For Location, type 
50 to make sure the stop is centered. 
4 For Stop Color, select CMYK and then drag each of the four color sliders to 0 (zero) 
to create white.

Applying the gradient to an object
To ﬁ nish page 2, you’ll create a full-page box and then apply the gradient to its ﬁ ll. First, 
let’s change the view size so that you can see all of page 2.
1 Choose 50% from the magniﬁ cation pop-up list at the bottom of the document 
window.
Before you create the graphics frame, make sure that the Art layer is selected. It’s a good 
idea to get into the habit of making sure that your objects are placed on the appropriate 
layer, so you can hide or lock a set of objects easily.
2 Choose Edit > Deselect All. Click the Layers palette tab to bring the Layers palette to 
the front, and then select Art. (Do not select either box to the left of Art, or you’ll hide 
or lock the objects on the Art layer.)
3 Select the Fill box (

tab to display the Pages palette, and then double-click the page 3 icon.
2 Click the Layers palette tab to display the Layers palette. Click the empty box just to 
the left of the Text layer name to prevent you from selecting the text frame accidentally. 
A crossed-out pencil icon (

1 To create a new document, choose File > New > Document, and then click OK in the 
New Document dialog box.
2 To import the colors from a different InDesign document, use the following 
procedure:
• Use the Swatches palette menu and choose New Color Swatch. 
• In the Color Mode pop-up menu, select Other Library and browse to ﬁ nd the ID_06 
folder. 
• Double-click 06_Color.indd (or 06_b.indd). Notice that the colors you created earlier 
in this lesson appear in this dialog box list for the new document.
• Select the Green/Gold Gradient and click OK to close the dialog box and add the color 
to the Swatches palette. 
• Repeat this entire process a few more times to add other colors to the Swatches palette.

5 Create a new gradient swatch that is radial instead of linear. Apply the new gradient 
to the ﬁ ll of a different shape you draw. Use the Gradient tool to change the gradient.
6 When you are done experimenting with colors, close the document without saving it.
Review questions
1 What is the advantage of applying colors using the Swatches palette instead of the 
Color palette?
2 What are the pros and cons of using spot colors versus process colors?
3 After you create a gradient and apply it to an object, how do you adjust the direction 
of the gradient blend?
Review answers
1 If you use the Swatches palette to apply a color to several objects, and then decide 
you want to use a different color, you don’t need to update each object individually. 
Instead, change the color in the Swatches palette and the color of all the objects will be 
updated automatically.
2 By using a spot color, you can ensure color accuracy. However, each spot color 
requires its own plate at the press, so using spot colors is more expensive. Use process 
colors when a job requires so many colors that using individual spot inks would be 
expensive or impractical, such as when printing color photographs.
3 To adjust the direction of the gradient blend, use the Gradient tool to repaint the ﬁ ll 
along an imaginary line in the direction you want.

LESSON 7
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
•  Distinguish between vector and bitmap graphics.
•  Place Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator graphics into an Adobe InDesign 
layout.
•  Import clipping paths with graphics, and create clipping paths using InDesign and 
Photoshop.
•  Place Adobe PDF ﬁ les.
•  Manage placed ﬁ les using the Links palette.
•  Use and create libraries for objects.
Getting started
In this lesson, you’ll assemble a booklet for a compact disc by importing and managing 
graphics from Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. After printing and trimming, 
the insert will be folded so that it ﬁ ts into a CD box. 
This lesson includes a procedure that you can perform using Adobe Photoshop, if you 
have a copy of that program installed on your computer. 
Before you begin, restore the default preferences for Adobe InDesign, using the 
procedure in “Restoring default preferences” on page 2. 
1 Start Adobe InDesign.
2 Choose File > Open, and open the 07_a.indd ﬁ le in the ID_07 folder, located inside 
the Lessons folder within the IDCIB folder on your hard disk. 
Note: If you have not already copied the resource ﬁ les for this lesson onto your hard disk 
from the ID_07 folder from the Adobe InDesign CS Classroom in a Book CD, do so now. 
See “Copying the Classroom in a Book ﬁ les” on page 2.
3 A message appears, saying that the publication contains missing or modiﬁ ed links. 
Click Don’t Fix; you will ﬁ x this later in the lesson.
4 If necessary, move the Links palette out of the way so it doesn’t obscure your view of 
the document. The Links palette opens automatically whenever you open an InDesign 
document that contains missing or modiﬁ ed links.

Importing and Linking Graphics
LESSON 7
Adding graphics from other programs
InDesign supports many common graphics ﬁ le formats. While this means that you can 
use graphics that were created using a wide range of graphics programs, InDesign works 
most smoothly with other Adobe professional graphics programs, such as Photoshop 
and Illustrator.
By default, imported graphics are linked, which means that InDesign displays a graphics 
ﬁ le on your layout without actually copying the entire graphics ﬁ le into the InDesign 
document. 
There are two major advantages to linking resource ﬁ les. First, it saves disk space, 
especially if you reuse the same graphic in many InDesign documents. Second, you can 
edit a linked document in the program you used to create it and then simply update the 
link in the InDesign Links palette. Updating a linked ﬁ le maintains the current location 
and settings for the resource so you don’t have to redo that work. 
All linked graphics and text ﬁ les are listed in the Links palette, which provides buttons 
and commands for managing links. When you create ﬁ nal output using PostScript® or 
PDF, InDesign uses the links to produce the highest level of quality available from the 
original, externally stored versions of placed graphics.
Comparing vector and  bitmap graphics
The drawing tools of Adobe InDesign and Adobe Illustrator create vector graphics, also 
called draw graphics, which are made up of shapes based on mathematical expressions. 
Vector graphics consist of smooth lines that retain their clarity when scaled. They are 
appropriate for illustrations, type, and graphics such as logos that are typically scaled to 
different sizes. 
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 259
Classroom in a Book
 Bitmap images are based on a grid of pixels and are created by image-editing 
applications, such as Adobe Photoshop. In working with bitmap images, you edit 
individual pixels rather than objects or shapes. Because bitmap graphics can represent 
subtle gradations of shade and color, they are appropriate for continuous-tone images, 
such as photographs or artwork created in painting programs. A disadvantage of bitmap 
graphics is that they lose deﬁ nition and appear “jagged” when enlarged. Additionally, 
bitmap images are typically larger in ﬁ le size than a similar vector ﬁ le.
ricky records
ricky records
Logo drawn as vector art (left), and rasterized as bitmap art (right).
In general, use vector drawing tools to create art or type with clean lines that look 
good at any size, such as a logo used on a business card and also on a poster. You can 
create vector artwork using the InDesign drawing tools, or you might prefer to take 
advantage of the wider range of vector drawing tools available in Illustrator. You can use 
Photoshop to create bitmap images that have the soft lines of painted or photographic 
art and for applying special effects to line art.
Managing links to imported ﬁ les
When you opened the document, you saw an alert message about problems with 
linked ﬁ les. You’ll resolve those issues using the Links palette, which provides complete 
information about the status of any linked text or graphics ﬁ le in your document.

LESSON 7
Identifying imported images
To identify some of the images that have already been imported into the document, 
you’ll use three different techniques involving the links palette. Later in this lesson, 
you’ll also use the Links palette to edit and update imported graphics.
1 If necessary, zoom or scroll the document window so that you can see both spreads 
in the document. Alternatively, choose View > Entire Pasteboard.
2 If the Links palette is not visible, choose Window > Links.
3 Using the Selection tool ( ), select the Orchard of Kings logotype on page 4, the 
far right page of the ﬁ rst spread. Notice that the graphic’s ﬁ lename, 07_i.ai, becomes 
selected in the Links palette when you select it on the layout.

4 Using the Selection tool, select the large hand graphic that spans the second spread 
(pages 5–7). The ﬁ lename for this graphic, 07_j.psd, is now selected in the Links palette.
Now you’ll use the Links palette to locate a graphic on the layout.
5 In the Links palette, select 07_h.psd, and then click the Go To Link button (
). 
The graphic becomes selected and centered on the screen. This is a quick way to ﬁ nd a 
graphic when you know its ﬁ le name.
If the Links palette is still in the center of the document window, you can move it now 
so that it doesn’t block your view of the page as you work through the rest of the lesson. 
These techniques for identifying and locating linked graphics are useful throughout this 
lesson and whenever you work with a large number of imported ﬁ les.

Viewing information about linked ﬁ les
You can use the Links palette to manage placed graphics or text ﬁ les in many other ways, 
such as updating or replacing text or graphics. All the techniques you learn in this lesson 
about managing linked ﬁ les apply equally to graphics ﬁ les and text ﬁ les that you place 
into your document.
1 If the Links palette is not visible, choose Window > Links to display it. If you cannot 
see the names of all the linked ﬁ les without scrolling, drag the lower right corner of the 
palette to enlarge it so that all the links are visible.
2 Double-click the link 07_g.psd. The Link Information dialog box appears, describing 
the linked ﬁ le.
3 Click Next to view information about the following ﬁ le on the Links palette list, 
07_h.psd. You can quickly examine all the links this way. Some of the other links may 
display an alert icon (
) under Content Status; this icon indicates a linking problem, 
which you’ll address in the next topic. After you’ve examined the link information, click 
Done.
By default, ﬁ les are sorted in the Links palette so that ﬁ les that are listed ﬁ rst are those 
that may need to be updated or relinked. You can use commands in the Links palette 
menu to sort the ﬁ le list in different ways.

4 In the Links palette, choose Sort by Page from the Links palette menu. The palette 
now lists the links in numerical order by the page on which the linked item appears.
Updating revised graphics
Even after you place text or graphic ﬁ les in your InDesign document, you can still use 
other programs to modify those ﬁ les. The Links palette indicates which ﬁ les have been 
modiﬁ ed outside of InDesign and gives you the choice of updating your document with 
the latest versions of those ﬁ les.
In the Links palette, the ﬁ le 07_i.ai has an alert icon (
), indicating that the original 
has recently been modiﬁ ed. This is the ﬁ le, as well as some others, that caused the alert 
message when you opened this document. You’ll update its link so that the InDesign

Viewing link status in the Links palette
A linked graphic can appear in the Links palette in any of the following ways:
• An up-to-date graphic displays only the ﬁ le name and its page in the document.
• A modiﬁ ed ﬁ le displays a yellow triangle with an exclamation point (
). This icon means that the 
version of the ﬁ le on disk is more recent than the version in your document. For example, this icon will ap-
pear if you import a Photoshop graphic into InDesign, and then another artist edits and saves the original 
graphic using Photoshop.
• A missing ﬁ le displays a red hexagon with a question mark ( ). The ﬁ le isn’t at the location from which 
it was originally imported, though the ﬁ le may still exist somewhere. This can happen if someone moves 
an original ﬁ le to a different folder or server after it’s been imported into an InDesign document. You can’t 
know whether a missing graphic is up to date until its original is located. If you print or export a document 
when this icon is displayed, the graphic may not print or export at full resolution.

1 In the Links palette, select the ﬁ le 07_i.ai, and click the Go To Link button (
). You 
don’t have to do this step to update a link, but it’s a quick way to double-check which 
imported ﬁ le you are about to update.
2 Click the Update Link button (
). The appearance of the image in the document 
changes to represent its newer version. However, the new image is larger than the 
previous version, so the existing frame now crops the updated graphic. Select the 
other ﬁ les displaying the modiﬁ ed icon ( ) and click the update button. You can hold 
down the shift key to select multiple consecutive ﬁ les to be updated in a single step or 
Ctrl+click (Windows) Command+click (Mac OS), to select non-consecutive items in 
the Links palette.
 All the buttons at the bottom of the Links palette are also available as commands on the

choose Object > Fitting > Fit Frame to Content. This command resizes only the frame, 
not the image.
You’ll replace the large, wide image of the hands that spans the second spread (pages 
5–7) with a modiﬁ ed image. You’ll use the Relink button to reassign the link to another 
graphic.
4 Go to pages 5–7 (the second spread) and choose View > Fit Spread in Window.
5 Select the 07_j.psd image, which is the photograph of two hands that extends across

7 Browse to ﬁ nd the 07_h.psd ﬁ le in the ID_07 folder, and then click Open. The new 
version of the image (which has a greenish cast, especially noticeable in the background) 
replaces the original image (with its predominantly red colored background), and the 
Links palette is updated accordingly. 
8 Click a blank area of the pasteboard to deselect all objects in the ﬁ le.
9  Choose File>Save to save your work.
 Placing a Photoshop ﬁ le and adjusting view quality
Now that you’ve resolved all the ﬁ le’s links, you’re ready to start adding more graphics. 
You’ll place a Photoshop ﬁ le in the InDesign document. InDesign imports Photoshop 
ﬁ les directly; there is no need to save them in other ﬁ le formats and no need to ﬂ atten 
the ﬁ le before importing.
As you place the image, InDesign automatically creates a low-resolution (proxy) version 
of it, corresponding to the current settings in the Preferences dialog box. This and any 
other images in this document are currently low-resolution proxies, which is why the 
image appears to have jagged edges. You can control the degree of detail InDesign uses 
to display placed graphics. Reducing the on-screen quality of placed graphics displays 
pages faster, and doesn’t affect the quality of ﬁ nal output.
1 Using the pop-up menu in the status bar of the document window, go to page 7 of 
your document. If necessary, zoom or scroll the document window so that you can see 
the entire page. 
2 In the Layers palette, click the Photos layer to target it.
3 Make sure that no objects are selected. Then choose File > Place, and double-click 
the ﬁ le 07_c.psd in the ID_07 folder.

LESSON 7
Working with clipping paths
You can remove unwanted  backgrounds from images using InDesign. You’ll get 
some experience doing this in the following procedure. In addition to removing the 
background using Adobe InDesign, you can also create paths or  Alpha Channels in 
Photoshop, which can then be used to silhouette an image in an InDesign layout.
The image you just placed has a solid rectangular background that is blocking your view 
of the area behind it. You can hide unwanted parts of an image using a clipping path—a 
drawn vector outline that acts as a mask. InDesign can create clipping paths from many 
kinds of images:
•  If you drew a path in Photoshop and saved it with the image, InDesign can create a 
clipping path from it.
•  If you painted an Alpha Channel in Photoshop and saved it with the image, InDesign 
can create a clipping path from it. An Alpha Channel carries transparent and opaque 
areas, and is commonly created with images used for photo or video compositing.
•  If the image has a light or white background, InDesign can automatically detect its 
edges and create a clipping path.
The pear image you placed doesn’t have a clipping path or an Alpha Channel, but it does 
have a solid white background that InDesign can remove.
Removing a white background using InDesign
You can use the Detect Edges option of the Clipping Path command to remove a solid 
white background from an image. The Detect Edges option hides areas of an image 
by changing the shape of the frame containing the image, adding anchor points as 
necessary. For more information about frames and anchor points, see the “About 
frames, paths, and selections” sidebar in Lesson 3.
1 Using the Selection tool ( ), select the pear image 07_c.psd by clicking the image. 
Switch to the Direct Selection tool ( ), and click the image when the pointer appears as 
a hand (
), to activate the frame.
Note: Activating the image frame with the Direct Selection tool makes the anchor points 
visible, so that you can see exactly how InDesign changes the frame into a clipping path as 
you work. The process will still work if you select the image or its bounding box instead of its 
frame, but you won’t get as much visual feedback.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 269

2 Choose Object > Clipping Path. If necessary, drag the Clipping Path dialog box so 
that you can see the pear image.
3 In the Type pop-up menu, choose Detect Edges. Select the Preview check box so that 
you see that the white background is almost entirely eliminated from the image.
4 For Threshold, drag the slider and watch the image on page 7 until the Threshold 
setting hides as much of the white background as possible without hiding parts of the 
subject (darker areas). We used a Threshold value of 15.
Note: If you can’t ﬁ nd a setting that removes all the background without affecting the 
subject, specify a value that leaves the entire subject visible along with small bits of the white 
background. You’ll eliminate the remaining white background by ﬁ ne-tuning the clipping 
path in the following steps.
The Threshold option works by hiding light areas of the image, starting with white. As 
you drag to the right to choose a higher value, increasingly darker tones are included 
within the range of tones that become hidden. Don’t try to ﬁ nd a setting that matches 
the pears perfectly. You’ll learn how to improve the clipping path a little bit later.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

LESSON 7
5 For Tolerance, drag the slider slightly to the left until the Tolerance value is between 
about 1 and 1.8. 
The Tolerance option determines how many points deﬁ ne the frame that’s automatically 
generated. As you drag to the right, InDesign uses fewer points so that the clipping 
path ﬁ ts the image more loosely (higher tolerance). Using fewer points on the path may 
speed up document printing, but may also be less accurate.
6 For Inset Frame, specify a value that closes up any remaining background areas, and 
click OK. We speciﬁ ed a value of 0p1 (zero picas, one point). This option shrinks the 
current shape of the clipping path uniformly, and is not affected by the lightness values 
in the image. Then click OK to close the Clipping Path dialog box.
Before and after applying an inset of 1 point.
7 (Optional) You can reﬁ ne the clipping path. Make sure that the path is activated, 
or click one of the pear images with the Direct Selection tool ( ) to activate it. You 
can then drag individual anchor points and use the drawing tools to edit the clipping 
path around the pears. For information about drawing, see Lesson 9, “Drawing Vector 
Graphics.”
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 271

Now you’ll switch the quality setting for the pear image back to low-resolution, to speed 
up performance.
8 Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) the pear image, and then choose 
Display Performance > Typical Display from the context menu to set the image for low-
resolution display.
9 Save the ﬁ le.
 You can also use the Detect Edges feature to remove a solid black background. Just select 
the Invert option and specify a high threshold value.
Working with  Alpha Channels
When an image has a background that isn’t solid white or black, the Detect Edges 
feature may not be able to remove the background effectively. With such images, hiding 
the background’s lightness values may also hide parts of the subject that use the same 
lightness values. Instead, you can use the advanced background-removal tools in 
Photoshop to mark transparent areas using paths or Alpha Channels, and let InDesign 
make a clipping path from those areas.
Note: If you place a Photoshop ﬁ le (.psd) that consists of an image placed on a transparent 
background, InDesign honors the transparency with no dependence on clipping paths or 
Alpha Channels. This can be especially helpful when you place an image with a soft or 
feathered edge.

LESSON 7
Importing a Photoshop ﬁ le and  Alpha Channels
You imported the previous image using the Place command. This time, use an alternate 
method: You’ll simply drag a Photoshop image directly onto an InDesign spread. 
InDesign can use  Photoshop paths and Alpha Channels directly—you don’t need to save 
the Photoshop ﬁ le in a different ﬁ le format.
1 In the Layers palette, make sure that the Photos layer is selected so that the image will 
appear on that layer. 
2 Go to page 2 of your document. Then resize and arrange your Explorer window 
(Windows), Finder window (Mac OS), and your InDesign windows as needed so that 
you can simultaneously see the list of ﬁ les on the desktop and the InDesign document 
window. Make sure that the lower left quarter of page 2 in your document is visible.
3 In Explorer (Windows) or the Finder (Mac OS), open the ID_07 folder, which 
contains the ﬁ le 07_d.psd ﬁ le. 
4 Drag the ﬁ le 07_d.psd to page 2 in the InDesign document. Then use the Selection 
tool ( ) to reposition the graphic so that it is in the lower left corner of the page.
Note: When you place the ﬁ le, be careful to drop it outside the solid-color squares. If you 
drop it in an object drawn using InDesign, it will be placed inside the object. If this happens, 
choose Edit > Undo, and try again. 
5 If necessary, you can now maximize the InDesign window to its previous size, 
because you’ve ﬁ nished importing the ﬁ le.

Examining Photoshop paths and Alpha Channels
In the Photoshop image that you just dragged into InDesign, the hand and the 
background share many of the same lightness values. Therefore, the background can’t 
easily be isolated using the Detect Edges option in the Clipping Path command.
Instead, you’ll set up InDesign to use a path or alpha channel from Photoshop. First 
you’ll use the Links palette to open the image directly in Photoshop to see what paths or 
Alpha Channels it already includes.
The procedure in this topic requires a full version of Photoshop 4.0 or later and is easier 
if you have enough RAM available to leave both InDesign and Photoshop open as you 
work. If your conﬁ guration doesn’t include these two standards, you can still read these 
steps to help you understand what Photoshop Alpha Channels look like and do, and 
resume your work in the next section of this lesson.
1 If necessary, use the Selection tool to select the 07_d.psd image in InDesign. 
2 If the Links palette is not already open, choose File > Links. The image ﬁ lename 
appears selected in the Links palette.
3 In the Links palette, click the Edit Original button (
). This opens the image in a 
program that can view or edit it. This image was saved from Photoshop, so if Photoshop 
is installed on your computer, InDesign starts Photoshop with the selected ﬁ le.
Note: Sometimes the Edit Original button opens an image in a program other than 
Photoshop or the program that created it. When you install software, some installer utilities 
change your operating system’s settings for associating ﬁ les with programs. The Edit 
Original command uses these settings for associating ﬁ les with programs. To change these 
settings, see the documentation for your operating system.

•  If you’ve properly conﬁ gured all Photoshop and InDesign color-management settings 
for your workﬂ ow using accurate ICC proﬁ les, select Convert Document’s Colors to the 
Working Space to reproduce the image properly in Photoshop. 
5 In Photoshop, choose Window > Channels to display the Channels palette, or click 
the Channels palette tab.
The Channels palette contains three Alpha Channels in addition to the standard 
RGB channels. These channels were drawn using the masking and painting tools in 
Photoshop.

Illustrator and pasted into Photoshop.
8 In the Photoshop Paths palette, click Shapes to view that path. Then click Circle.
You’re ﬁ nished using Photoshop, so you can now quit that program.
Using Photoshop Alpha Channels in InDesign
Now you’ll return to InDesign and see how you can create different clipping paths from 
the Photoshop paths and Alpha Channels.

2 (Optional) Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) the hand image, and 
choose Display Performance > High Quality from the context menu that appears. This 
step isn’t necessary, but it lets you precisely preview the following steps.
3 With the hand image still selected, choose Object > Clipping Path to open the 
Clipping Path dialog box. If necessary, move the Clipping Path dialog box so that you 
can see the image as you work.
4 Make sure that Preview is selected in the Clipping Path dialog box, and then choose 
Alpha Channel from the Type menu. The Alpha menu becomes available, listing the 
three Alpha Channels you saw in Photoshop by the names used in that program.
5 In the Alpha menu, choose Alpha 1. InDesign creates a clipping path from the alpha 
channel. Then choose Alpha 2 from the same menu, and compare the results.
 The ﬁ rst clipping path you see represents the default settings for deﬁ ning the edges 
of an alpha channel. You can ﬁ ne-tune the clipping path that InDesign creates from an 
alpha channel by adjusting the Threshold and Tolerance options, as you did for the Detect 
Edges feature earlier in this lesson. For Alpha Channels, start with a low Threshold value 
such as 1.
6 Choose Alpha 3 from the Alpha menu, and then select the Include Inside Edges 
option. Notice the changes in the image.
Selecting the Include Inside Edges option makes InDesign recognize a butterﬂ y-shaped 
hole painted into alpha channel 3, and adds it to the clipping path.
 You can see how the butterﬂ y-shaped hole looks in Photoshop by viewing alpha channel 
3 in the original Photoshop ﬁ le, as you did in the previous procedure, “Examining Photo-
shop paths and Alpha Channels.
7 Choose Photoshop Path from the Type menu, and then choose Shapes from the Path 
menu. InDesign reshapes the image’s frame to match the Photoshop path.

9 Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) the hand image to open the 
context menu, and choose Display Performance > Typical Display. Then save the ﬁ le.
Importing an Illustrator ﬁ le
InDesign takes full advantage of the smooth lines provided by EPS vector graphics such 
as those from Adobe Illustrator. When you use InDesign’s high-quality screen display, 
EPS vector graphics and type appear with smooth edges at any size or magniﬁ cation. 
Most EPS vector graphics don’t require a clipping path because most programs save 
them with transparent backgrounds. In this section, you’ll drag an Illustrator graphic 
from a folder to the InDesign document.
1 Make sure that the ID_07 folder and the InDesign document window are both visible 
simultaneously. In InDesign, zoom or scroll if necessary so that pages 5 and 6 are both 
visible. You may ﬁ nd it useful to view the entire spread by selecting View > Fit Spread in 
Window.

Display settings for display performance
With the High Quality Display setting, you can see the Illustrator graphic at the greatest 
possible level of detail and with sharp, crisp edges. Because the display is this accurate, 
you may be able to use sight alone to precisely position and align Illustrator and EPS 
graphics, particularly when you work at an increased magniﬁ cation. However, you may 
also notice a slight decline in computer performance when using high–quality display. 
You’ll switch back to a low-resolution quality in order to speed–up image display for the 
rest of the lesson.
8 Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) the ivy graphic, and then choose 
Display Performance > Typical Display from the context menu that appears.
9 Save the ﬁ le.
Placing an Adobe PDF ﬁ le
You can include Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) ﬁ les in your InDesign 
layout. PDF is a popular format for exchanging documents and graphics such as 
advertisements, because it preserves professional-quality color, vector graphics, bitmap 
images, and text across a wide range of programs and computing platforms. You can 
use PDF to publish the same document on paper and on the Internet while maintaining 
quality appropriate for both media. In this section, you’ll import a PDF ﬁ le that 
contains a company logo created and saved directly from Adobe Illustrator.

deselect Replace Selected Item and then select Show Import Options. In the ID_07 
folder, locate and double-click the ﬁ le 07_f.pdf.
The import options for PDF ﬁ les let you customize how a PDF ﬁ le is placed into your 
document. For example, when you place a multiple-page PDF ﬁ le, you can choose 
which page to place. This ﬁ le contains only one page, however. You can also set the 
cropping of the ﬁ le, which you will do in the next step.
3 Under Option, in the Crop To menu, select Bounding Box. This sets the size of the 
placed PDF ﬁ le to the smallest rectangle that encloses all of the objects in the ﬁ le. For 
example, in this case the logo is much smaller than the page size, so it makes sense for 
the frame of the imported ﬁ le to be the size of the logo, not of the page.

Object libraries let you store and organize graphics, text, and pages that you frequently 
use. You can also add ruler guides, grids, drawn shapes, and grouped images to a library. 
Each library appears as a separate palette that you can group with other palettes any way 
you like. You can create as many libraries as you need—for example, different libraries 
for each of your projects or clients. In this section, you’ll import a graphic currently

Review questions
1 How can you determine the ﬁ lename of an imported graphic in your document?
2 What are the three options in the Clipping Path command, and what must an 
imported graphic contain for each option to work?
3 What is the difference between updating a ﬁ le’s link and replacing the ﬁ le?
4 When an updated version of a graphic becomes available, how do you make sure that 
it’s up to date in your InDesign document?
Review answers
1 Select the graphic and then choose File > Links to see if the graphic’s ﬁ lename is 
highlighted in the Links palette. The graphic will appear in the Links palette if it takes 
up more than 48KB on disk and was placed or dragged in from the desktop.
2 The Clipping Path command in InDesign can create a clipping path from an 
imported graphic by using:
•  The Detect Edges option, when a graphic contains a solid white or solid black 
background.
•  The Photoshop Path option, when a Photoshop ﬁ le contains one or more paths.
•  The Alpha Channel option, when a graphic contains one or more Alpha Channels.
3 Updating a ﬁ le’s link simply uses the Links palette to update the on-screen 
representation of a graphic so that it represents the most recent version of the original. 
Replacing a selected graphic uses the Place command to insert another graphic in place 
of the selected graphic. If you want to change any of a placed graphic’s import options, 
you must replace the graphic.
4 Check the Links palette and make sure that no alert icon is displayed for the ﬁ le. If 
an alert icon appears, you can simply select the link and click the Update Link button 
as long as the ﬁ le has not been moved. If the ﬁ le has been moved you can locate it again 
using the Relink button.

Creating Tables
LESSON 8
In this lesson you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Import formatted tables from other applications, such as Microsoft Word and 
Microsoft Excel.
• Format tables with alternating row colors.
• Format cell and border strokes.
• Apply colors to individual rows.
• Delete and resize columns.
• Set precise column dimensions.
• Place single or multiple graphics within a cell.
• Format text in tables by columns and by rows.
Getting started
In this lesson you’ll work on a ﬁ ctional magazine spread that takes tables of information 
and brings them into the world of effective visual design. You’ll develop tables using the 
Table palette that gives you complete control over table features. 
To ensure that the tools and palettes function exactly as described in this lesson, delete 
or deactivate (by renaming) the InDesign Defaults ﬁ le and the InDesign SavedData ﬁ le. 
See “Restoring default preferences” on page 2.

Importing and formatting a table
If you’ve worked with tables before, you already know that tables are grids of individual 
cells set in rows (horizontal) and columns (vertical). The border of the table is a stroke 
that lies on the outside perimeter of the entire table.  Cell strokes are lines within the 
table that set the individual cells apart from each other. Many tables include special rows 
or columns that describe the category of information they contain. Typically, these are 
in the top row or the ﬁ rst column.
InDesign CS can import tables from other applications, including Microsoft Word and 
Microsoft Excel. In this section, you’ll import a table that was created in Word. This 
table contains all the information about the garden tour that you want in your InDesign 
layout, organized into rows and columns.
1 In the Pages palette, double-click page 3 to center it in the document window. 
2 On the View menu, make sure that the Snap to Guides command is selected, as 
indicated by a checkmark. If the Show Guides command is available in the View menu, 
select it now. 
3 Choose File > Place, and then navigate to the ID_08 folder and double-click the 
08_c.doc ﬁ le.
4 Move the pointer, which now appears as a loaded text icon (
), to the intersection of 
the left margin of page 3 and the guide at the 1.5-inch mark of the vertical ruler. Click 
once to place the Microsoft Word table into your InDesign document. 
Because it is a table, text wraps within the cells. You can edit text and make selections 
according to rows, columns, or the entire table.

Creating Tables
LESSON 8
The frame for the table ﬁ lls the page from margin to margin, although the table itself 
does not cover that much space. Leave the frame in its current size because your table 
will grow larger as you set cell dimensions, add graphics, and format text.
Formatting borders and alternating row colors
InDesign CS includes many easy-to-use formatting options for tables. You can use these 
to make your tables both attractive and easy for readers to understand, so that they ﬁ nd 
the information they need quickly and comfortably.
1 Using the Zoom tool ( ), click the upper left area of page 3 to increase the 
magniﬁ cation to 100% or more. Then select the Type tool (
).
2 Move the pointer to the upper left corner of the imported table, so that the pointer 
appears as a heavy diagonal arrow, and click once to select the entire table. 
Increase the magniﬁ cation if you experience difﬁ culty getting the diagonal arrow to 
appear. An alternate way to select an entire table is to click the Type tool anywhere in 
the table and then choose Table > Select > Table. If the Type tool is not selected, this 
command is not available.

3 Choose Table > Table Options > Table Setup. (Or, choose the same command on the 
Table palette menu.) The Table Options dialog box opens at the Table Setup tab.
4 Under  Table Border, set the following options: the Weight as 1, the Type as Solid, and 
the Color as [Black].

5 Then click the Fills tab and set the following options:
• For  Alternating Pattern, select Every Other Row.
• Under First, select Color as C = 75, M = 5, Y = 100, K = 0, and then type 25% for Tint.
• Under Next, select Color as [Paper].
• In Skip First, type 1 so that the alternating colors start on row 2 (the row below the 
headings).
6 Click OK to close the dialog box, and then choose Edit > Deselect All so that you can

Adding cell strokes
Another way you can help your readers to interpret table information is to add strokes 
around each cell. 
1 Select the Type tool (
) and move the pointer to the upper left corner of the table 
until it turns into a diagonal arrow, then click to select the entire table.
2 Choose Table >  Cell Options > Strokes and Fills (or choose the same command from 
the Table palette menu).
3 In the Cell Stroke area of the dialog box, select the following options:
• For Weight, select 0.5 pt.
• For Type, select Solid.
• For Color, select [Black], and then click OK.
4 Choose Edit > Deselect All to see the results of your formatting.

Creating Tables
LESSON 8
 Formatting the heading cells
Another element that makes reading a table easier is to set the categories apart from the 
table data. By making the categories visually distinctive, your readers are more likely to 
comprehend the table information more easily. In this procedure, you’ll create insets, so 
that the text doesn’t run into the strokes on each cell, and then you’ll give the heading 
row a unique color ﬁ ll.
1 Using the Type tool (
), move the pointer over the left edge of the ﬁ rst row until it 
appears as a heavy horizontal arrow (
). Then click to select the entire ﬁ rst row.
2 Choose Table > Cell Options > Text.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 299

3 On the Text tab, set the following options:
• Under Cell Insets, type 0.086" (or 0.086 in) for Bottom. If the Top, Left, and Right 
values are not already 0.0556", type that number in each of those options. 
• Under Vertical Justiﬁ cation, for Align, select Bottom.
• For First Baseline, make sure that the Offset is set as Ascent. Leave the dialog box open.

LESSON 8
Deleting a column
After you create or import a table, you can add or delete entire rows or columns to 
or from your table structure. Sometimes, you’ll want to delete just the contents of a 
cell, row, or column. Other times, you’ll want to delete the cell, row, or column itself, 
including its contents. The techniques for these two procedures differ slightly so that 
you make the exact edits that you intend.
The information in the column on the far right of this table is out of date and no longer 
relevant, so you’ll delete the entire column now.
1 Using the Type tool (
), move the pointer to the top edge of column 6 (the last 
column, on the right) until the pointer turns into a heavy downward-pointing arrow 
( ). Then click to select the entire column.
2 Choose Table > Delete > Column. Now the entire column disappears.
Note: To delete only the content of a column, you can select the column and use the delete 
key on your keyboard.
 You’ll ﬁ nd additional commands on the Table menu and Table palette menu for insert-
ing additional columns and rows, for deleting rows and entire tables, and for selecting rows, 
columns, cells, and entire tables.

Using graphics within tables
You can use InDesign tables to create effective tables that combine text, photographs, 
and illustrations. The techniques involved are as easy as working with text. 
In this section, you’ll adjust your table formatting so that the cells are the correct sizes 
for the graphics you’ll place in them. Then you’ll put graphics into those cells.
Setting ﬁ xed column and row dimensions
You can deﬁ ne the sizes of cells, columns, or rows to ﬁ t precise measurements. In this 
topic, you will adjust the size of the ﬁ rst column so that the one-inch photographic 
images ﬁ t nicely within the cells.
1 Using the Type tool (
), select the ﬁ rst column, either by dragging from top to 
bottom or by clicking the top edge of the column when the heavy downward-pointing 
arrow ( ) appears. Or, you can click in any cell of the column and select Table > Select 
> Column.
2 Choose Window > Type & Table > Table to show the Table palette, if it is not already 
visible. In the Column Width option ( ), type 1.15 in (or 1.15"), and press Enter. Then 
click anywhere in the table to deselect the column.
3 Using the Type tool (
), drag down from the second cell in the ﬁ rst column. Select 
all the cells except the heading cell at the top of the column.

LESSON 8
4 In the Table palette, select Exactly in the Row Height option and type 1.15 in. Press 
Enter.
Placing graphics in table cells
To save you some time, most of the images you’ll place within the table are already 
placed on the pasteboard of this document. In this procedure, you’ll just cut and paste 
these images one by one into the cells of the ﬁ rst table column. To begin, you’ll import 
one image that is not yet part of the InDesign ﬁ le.
1 Using the Type tool, click to place the insertion point in the ﬁ rst cell in the second 
row (just below the “Detail” cell).
2 Choose File > Place, and locate the 08_d.tif ﬁ le in your ID_08 folder. Double-click to 
open the ﬁ le. The photographic image appears in the ﬁ rst cell.
3 Adjust the document-window magniﬁ cation and scroll horizontally as needed so 
that you can see both the ﬁ rst column and the vertical row of photographs on the 
pasteboard, just to the right of page 3.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 305
Classroom in a Book
4 Using the Selection tool ( ), select the top photograph on the pasteboard to the right 
of the spread. Then choose Edit > Cut.
5 Switch to the Type tool (
) and click to place a cursor in the third row of the ﬁ rst 
column, just below the photograph you placed in the previous step.
6 Choose Edit > Paste. 
7 Continue cutting and pasting to place each of the remaining ﬁ ve photographs into 
the empty cells in column 1, proceeding from top to bottom.
 You can temporarily switch between the Selection tool and the Type tool by holding the 
Ctrl key (Windows) or Command key (Mac OS).
Note: You cannot simply drag items into table cells. Dragging would merely position the 
item above or below the table in the layout stacking order, not place the item within a cell. 
Tables require you to use the Type tool as you place or paste content into cells.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

Creating Tables
LESSON 8
Placing multiple graphics in a cell
Essentially, the images you place or paste into table cells are inline graphics in text. 
Because of this, you can add as many images to a single cell as you need. You are limited 
only by the actual size of a cell.
1 Using the Selection tool ( ), select the wheelchair graphic on the pasteboard.
2 Choose Edit > Copy.
3 Switch to the Type tool, and look in column 5 for the ﬁ rst instance of the word 
Disabled. Click and drag to select the entire word and the comma. It is probably easiest 
to also select the space between that word and the next one.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 307
Classroom in a Book
4 Choose Edit > Paste. If you selected the space after the comma, press the spacebar to 
add a space after the graphic.
5 Find the remaining instances of the word Disabled in the remaining cells of that 
column, select them, and paste to replace the text with the wheelchair graphic.
6 Repeat this entire process for each of the remaining words and icons: Baby, Bus, Taxi, 
Lockers, Retail, Coffee, and Dining.
Note: If you are unsure which icon is which, select the icon with the Selection tool and then 
look at the Links palette to see which ﬁ le is selected. The icon ﬁ les have descriptive names.
Because you haven’t yet adjusted the column widths, your icons may overlap each other 
vertically at this phase of your work. You’ll ﬁ x that in the next section.

Creating Tables
LESSON 8
Formatting text within a table
All that remains in your table project is to make some ﬁ nal adjustments so that the 
spacing of the text, graphics and table are in harmony with the rest of the spread.
Applying character styles to text in a table
If you are already comfortable formatting text in text frames, then formatting text in 
tables will be an easy and natural extension of your InDesign skills.
1 Using the Type tool (
), click anywhere in the words Garden name in the ﬁ rst row of 
your table. Then choose Table > Select > Row.
2 Choose Type > Character Styles to make the Character Styles palette visible, and then 
select the Table Head character style in that palette to apply that style to the ﬁ rst-row 
text.
If some of the text no longer ﬁ ts into the cells, it will be ﬁ xed in the next step. Overset 
text inside of cells is represented by a red dot inside the cell.
3 In the second column, double-click the name Anreuten-Wynne to select it and then 
drag down to select all the garden names in that column, being careful not to include 
the text in the header at the very top of the column.
4 In the Character Styles palette, select Table Names to apply that style to the selected 
text.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 309

5 Select all the cells in columns 3 and 4 except those in the ﬁ rst row, using the same 
technique as in step 3. Then use the Character Styles palette to apply the style Table 
Details to this text. 
6 Select all the cells except for the headings of each column, using the same technique 
from steps 3 and 5.
7 In Table palette, under Top Cell Inset ( ), type 0.08" and press Enter.

LESSON 8
Dragging to adjust column size
When an ordinary text frame contains a story that doesn’t completely ﬁ t into the 
assigned space, the out port for the frame displays a red plus sign (+), indicating 
that there is overset text. You would solve that either by enlarging the text frame or 
continuing the story in another text frame. 
In tables, text or graphics that don’t ﬁ t into their cells are also called overset, indicated 
by a small colored circle in the lower right corner of the cell. Unlike ordinary frames, 
you can’t just carry over the excess data into another cell of the table. Instead, you must 
either resize the cell to hold the information or resize the content (by scaling the graphic 
or deleting some of the text). 
For this table, you’ll resize the columns so that everything ﬁ ts nicely into the table.
1 Choose View > Fit Page in Window.
2 Move the Type tool over the vertical line separating columns 2 and 3 until the 
pointer icon becomes a double arrow (
), and then drag the column margin to resize it 
until the words Garden and name ﬁ t on the same line.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 311
Classroom in a Book
3 Moving from left to right, resize each of the columns so that the contents ﬁ t inside. 
Also set the right edge of the table to snap against the vertical margin guide on the right 
side of the page. Make sure that the last column on the right is wide enough so that all 
the services icons ﬁ t on a single line, as shown in the illustration.
4 Choose View > Fit Spread in Window, and then save your work.
Working with tables within existing text frames
The imported table you’ve been working on is the only text in its frame. Next, you’ll 
make a minor adjustment that affects the other table in the two-page spread. That table, 
on page 2, is part of a frame that includes other text.
1 In the Layers palette, click the empty box between the eye icon (
) and the Table 
layer name to lock that layer. Then unlock the Text layer by clicking in the column 
immediately to the left of the layer name in the Layers palette then click the layer name 
to select the layer.
2 In the Pages palette, double-click the page 2 icon to center the page in the document 
window.

LESSON 8
3 Using the Type tool (
), click to place an insertion point immediately in front of the 
words “As always” (about two-thirds of the way down the long paragraph). Notice the 
position of the table near the bottom of the page.
4 Press Enter to separate the text into two paragraphs. Choose Edit > Deselect All. 
Notice how the table moves down the page, adjusting to the new spacing.
Note: Because tables are placed inside of text boxes, their position can be changed by the 
formatting of the text surrounding them

On your own
Now that you’re skilled in the basics of working with tables using InDesign, you can 
experiment with other techniques to expand your table-building abilities.
1 To create a new table, scroll beyond the spread to the pasteboard, and drag the Type 
tool (
) to create a new text frame. Then choose Table > Insert Table and enter the 
number of rows and columns you want in your table.
2 To enter information in your table, make sure that the blinking insertion point is in 
the ﬁ rst frame and then type. To move forward to the next cell in the row, press Tab. To 
move to the next cell down in the column, press the down arrow key.
3 To add a column by dragging, move the Type tool over the right edge of one of the 
columns in your table, so that the pointer becomes a double-headed arrow. Hold down 
Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) and drag a short distance to the right, perhaps half 
an inch or so. When you release the mouse button, a new column appears, having the 
same width as the distance you dragged.
4 To combine several cells into one cell, select all the cells in the new column you 
created in the previous “On your own” exercise (number 3). Then choose Table > Merge 
Cells. To convert the table to text, choose Table > Convert Table to Text. You can have 
tabs separate what were previously columns and have paragraph breaks separate the 
columns. You can also modify these options. Similarly, you can convert tabbed text into 
a table by selecting the text and choosing Table > Convert Text to Table.
5 To create rotated text, click the Type tool inside the merged cell you created “On your 
own” exercise number 4. Choose Window > Table to bring the Table palette forward, 
and select the Rotate Text 270° option ( ). Then type the text you want in this cell.

LESSON 8
Review questions
1 What are the advantages of using tables rather than just typing text and using tabs to 
separate the columns?
2 When might you get an overset cell?  
 
3 What tool is used most frequently when you work with tables?
Review answers
1 Tables give you much more ﬂ exibility and are far easier to format. In a table, text 
can wrap within a cell, so you don’t have to add extra lines to accommodate cells with 
many words. Also, you can assign styles to individual rows, columns, and cells, including 
character styles and even paragraph styles, because each cell is considered a separate 
paragraph.
2 Overset cells occur when the dimensions of the cell are limited and the contents don’t 
ﬁ t inside it. For this to occur, you must actively deﬁ ne the width and height of the cell 
(or its row and column). Otherwise, when you place text in the cell, the text will wrap 
within the cell, which then expands vertically to accommodate the text. When you place 
a graphic in a cell that does not have deﬁ ned size limits, the cell also expands vertically 
but not horizontally, so that the row column keeps its original width.
3 The Type tool must be selected to do any work with the table. You can use other tools 
to work with the graphics within table cells, but to work with the table itself, such as 
selecting rows or columns, inserting text or graphic content, adjusting table dimensions, 
and so forth, you use the Type tool.

9 Drawing Vector Graphics
You can use the Pen tool to draw 
straight lines and smooth, ﬂ owing 
curves with great precision. The Pen tool 
will be familiar to you if you’ve used 
the Pen tools in Adobe Illustrator and 
Photoshop. Shapes you draw with the 
Pen tool can enhance your page designs 
in combination with text and imported 
graphics.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

Drawing Vector Graphics
LESSON 9
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Draw and edit straight and curved path segments and open and closed paths with the 
Pen tool.
• Create a hole in a ﬁ lled shape by combining paths into a compound path.
• Apply a shape (such as an  arrowhead) to the end of a path.
• Slice paths into smaller pieces.
• Paste an image inside a drawn path.
• Scale, reﬂ ect, and duplicate objects.
• Add a graphic so that it becomes part of a text story and ﬂ ows with it.
Getting started
In this lesson, you’ll create the front and back of a direct-mail piece. You’ll use the 
InDesign drawing tools to draw some of the vector objects, or paths, in the design. 
Before you begin, you’ll need to restore the default preferences for Adobe InDesign.
1 To ensure that the tools and palettes function exactly as described in this lesson, 
delete or deactivate (by renaming) the InDesign Defaults ﬁ le and the InDesign 
SavedData ﬁ le. See “Restoring default preferences” on page 2. 
2 Start Adobe InDesign.
To begin working, you’ll open an existing InDesign document.
3 Choose File > Open, and open the 09_a.indd ﬁ le in the ID_09 folder, located inside 
the Lessons folder on your hard disk.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 319
Classroom in a Book
Note: If you have not already copied the resource ﬁ les for this lesson onto your hard disk 
from the ID_09 folder from the Adobe InDesign CS Classroom in a Book CD, do so now. 
See “Copying the Classroom in a Book ﬁ les” on page 2.
4 Choose File > Save As, rename the ﬁ le 09_Mailer.indd, and then click Save.
You’ll notice that the page is blank except for a shape near the bottom left corner of the 
page. This document contains everything you need to create the completed version of 
the document, but to keep things simple, it uses layers to hide everything except the 
tracing template for the shape you’re currently drawing. Right now, you see the tracing 
template for the ﬁ rst shape you’ll draw. 
As you progress through the lesson, you’ll use the Layers palette to show and hide other 
parts of the document. When you’re ﬁ nished, you’ll display all layers except the layers 
containing the tracing templates. For more information, see “Working with Layers” in 
Adobe InDesign CS online Help.

LESSON 9
5 To see what the ﬁ nished document will look like, open the 09_b.indd ﬁ le in the same 
folder. You can leave this document open to act as a guide as you work. When you’re 
ready to resume working on the lesson document, choose its name from the Window 
menu.
Note: You’ll use the Layers and Swatches palettes frequently in this lesson. It may be 
helpful to enlarge those palettes so that you can easily see all of their items. You can 
move palettes around and change the magniﬁ cation of the layout to a level that works 
best for you. See “Changing the magniﬁ cation of your document” on page 53 and 
“Using the Navigator palette” on page 60 of this book.
Setting up the document grid
Many of the paths you draw in this lesson will be straight lines, precise corners, and 
symmetrical curves. It’s easier to draw these kinds of paths if you set up the document 
grid in a convenient way. You’ll now deﬁ ne and display the grid and grid options.
1 Choose Edit > Preferences > Grids (Windows, Mac OS) or InDesign CS > 
Preferences > Grids (Mac OS).
2 In the Document Grid area under Horizontal, type 10p0 (10 picas, 0 points) for 
Gridline Every and type 10 for Subdivisions. Type these values (10p0 and 10) again for 
the similar options under Vertical. Then click OK.
3 Choose View > Show Document Grid.
4 Choose View > Snap To Document Grid to select it.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 321
Classroom in a Book
 Sometimes the grids are hard to see because they’re covered by objects on the layout. You 
can move grids to the front of the display by choosing Edit > Preferences > Grids (Windows) 
or InDesign > Preferences > Grids (Mac OS), and deselecting the Grids in Back option.
Drawing straight segments
You can use the Pen tool to draw straight lines by clicking two anchor points, which 
deﬁ ne a segment. To create straight lines that are vertical, horizontal, or 45-degree 
diagonals, you can hold down Shift as you click the Pen tool. This is called constraining 
the line.
This lesson makes extensive use of templates to facilitate the drawing process for you 
as you learn to use InDesign. These templates are non-writing layers that display the 
ﬁ nal shapes. You simply trace those shapes so that your results will look exactly like the 
ﬁ nished sample ﬁ le.
Drawing an open path of straight segments
You’ll begin by drawing a simple open path, tracing over a template at the bottom left 
corner of page 1. This template for the shirt-collar top is on the Template 1 layer. You 
will draw the collar on the Collar layer.
1 Click the Layers palette tab (or choose Window > Layers) to make the palette visible, 
and scroll down the palette to the Collar and Template 1 layers near the bottom of the 
list.
The eye icon (
) indicates that the layers are visible, and the crossed-out pencil 
icon (
) for the Template 1 layer indicates that the layer is locked. All the template 
layers are locked so that you don’t draw on them by accident.

LESSON 9
2 In the Layers palette, select the Collar layer. The pen icon (
) appears to the far right 
of the Collar layer name, indicating that anything you add to the page will be written on 
this layer.
3 In the toolbox, select the Zoom tool ( ) and then click the shirt-collar template one 
or more times to zoom until you can easily read the numbers on the template.
4 Press Shift+Ctrl+A (Windows) or Shift+Command+A (Mac OS) to make sure that 
no objects are selected. 
5 Choose Window > Stroke to display the Stroke palette, and make sure that the 
Weight is 1 point. Then move or close the Stroke palette, as needed, so that it doesn’t 
obstruct your view of the template.
Note: When you adjust any option while no objects are selected, you adjust the default 
setting for that option. For this lesson, you want the default stroke weight to be 1 point, so 
that the paths you draw don’t obscure the lines on the template layer.
6 In the toolbox, select the Pen tool (
), and move the pointer over point 1 on the 
template, for the lower edge of the shirt collar.
The pointer has a small hollow arrowhead ( ) next to it to remind you that you selected 
the Snap to Grids option. When you click, the pointer will snap to the closest guide or 
grid intersection and place the ﬁ rst anchor point at that location.

7 Click point 1.
8 Move the Pen tool over point 2 on the template and click again.
 When the Snap To Document Grid command is not on, you can still position points at

9 Click each of the remaining numbered points (3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) in order. Because 
you’re clicking at positions that fall on the grid, the shape is a perfect match with the 
template.

LESSON 9
As you draw paths with the Pen tool, you’ll see many visual cues along the way. These 
cues provide you with useful information. By this step, you’re already able to observe the 
following:
• A third point appears between the ﬁ rst and second anchor points of any segment you 
draw. This is the center point of the segment, which automatically appears on any path 
that has at least two points. A center point makes it easier to select and align objects. As 
you progress through this lesson, watch how the center point automatically keeps itself 
at the center of a path as you change a path’s shape.
• When you click the second point, a caret (^) appears next to the pointer as long as the 
tip of the Pen tool icon is on the new endpoint. The caret indicates an opportunity to 
create a curve out of that anchor point. You’ll create curves later in this lesson.
• The path and anchor points you’ve drawn appear in lavender. This is because the 
Collar layer uses lavender as its layer color, indicated by the colored square immediately 
to the left of the Collar layer name in the Layers palette. The layer color identiﬁ es the 
layers that contain the currently selected objects.
Note: Don’t confuse the layer color with the stroke color, which does not print. The layer 
color represents the stacking order of objects.
Applying color to a path
The path you just drew appears in the default stroke color, so now you’ll apply the 
correct colors for the design. The colors for this illustration are already stored in the 
Swatches palette for you.
Before you apply color to the collar shape, you’ll hide the Template 1 layer so that you 
can see the path more clearly.
1 In the Layers palette, click the eye icon (
) for the Template 1 layer to hide that layer.
2 Using the Selection tool ( ), select the path.
3 Click the Swatches palette tab (or choose Window > Swatches) to make the palette 
visible.
4 In the toolbox, select the Stroke box (

7 Choose Edit > Deselect All, and then choose File > Save to save the ﬁ le.
Copying and altering an existing path
You’ll start the process of drawing a closed shape that will appear below the open shape 
you just drew. First, you’ll show the Template 2 layer, which contains the shape of the 
bottom part of the shirt collar that you’ll create next.
1 In the Layers palette, click the square to the far left of the Template 2 layer to display 
the eye icon (
) and select the Collar layer to target that layer. If necessary, adjust the 
view in the document window so that you can see the entire collar shape. 
Notice that the top edge of the template you just displayed is the same as the collar top 
you’ve already drawn. You can save time by duplicating the collar top and editing the 
copy.

2 Using the Direct Selection tool ( ), click the top collar path (the one you’ve already 
drawn), and then click the center point to select all points in the path. 
3 Hold down Shift+Alt (Windows) or Shift+Option (Mac OS) as you drag the top 
collar path down until it lines up with the top edge of the template for the collar 
bottom. When you release the mouse, you’ll see that you’ve actually created and dragged 
a copy of the path, not the original. 
Dragging a copy of upper path (left), and the new copy in position (right).
Note: If you ﬁ nd yourself dragging one point instead of the entire shape, choose Edit > 
Undo and try again, making sure all points on the path are selected (solid) before you begin 
dragging.
By using the Direct Selection tool for this move, you aligned the path itself to the grid, 
not the stroke. If you had used the Selection tool, the object would have aligned the 
outer edge of its stroke width to the grid, not the path.

Changing how stroke weight affects bounding box and path dimensions
When you change the stroke weight of a path, the outer dimensions of the path’s bounding box are 
preserved by default. This maintains the position of the stroke’s outer edge while its inner edge grows or 
shrinks with the stroke weight. The position and dimensions of the path (which lies at the center of the 
stroke) are changed accordingly. If you want to constrain the path’s position and dimensions, select the 
Weight Changes Bounding Box. This will have less effect on how much of a path’s ﬁ ll or contents are visible, 
but will cause the total area of the ﬁ ll and stroke to change whenever you change a stroke weight. 
The Selection tool activates the bounding box 
at the outer edge of the stroke weight (left). The 
Direct Selection tool displays the path at the center 
of the stroke (right).

6 Position the pointer on the lower right endpoint of the collar path. Then drag it 
down to the point numbered 7 on the template to extend both the selected segments.
Closing and applying colors to a drawn object
In order to apply a solid ﬁ ll to the collar, you must ﬁ rst close the collar shape. Your work 
continues with the Collar label targeted (selected in the Layers palette) and the Template 
2 layer visible.
1 Press the P key to select the Pen tool, and move the pointer tip directly over the 
endpoint labeled 1, so that a slash ( ) appears next to the pointer. The slash indicates 
that clicking will continue the path from the endpoint rather than starting a new path.
 By learning the keyboard shortcuts for drawing (such as the Pen tool shortcut you just 
used), you save many trips to the toolbox. That helps you work faster and more smoothly. 
Many users ﬁ nd it efﬁ cient to keep the mouse in one hand, and keep the other hand over the 
keyboard to press tool shortcut and modiﬁ er keys.

Drawing with the Pencil tool
In this procedure, you’ll draw a ﬂ ower shape that is free-form rather than a precise 
representation. Since the shape is informal, you’ll use the Pencil tool to sketch the shape 
intuitively. As you work, you’ll take advantage of the new Fidelity and Smoothness 
controls for the pencil and Smooth tools to make it easier to create the smooth shape 
you want for the ﬂ ower.
Preparing to draw with the Pencil tool
Before you begin drawing, you’ll set up your document so that you are drawing on the 
appropriate layer and with the correct stroke.
1 In the Layers palette, click the eye icon (
) for the Collar layer to hide it, and then 
click the eye icon boxes for Template 3 and the Flower layers to make them visible, 
selecting the Flower layer so that it is targeted.

template to deﬁ ne the view magniﬁ cation.
3 In the toolbox, double-click the Pencil tool to open the Pencil tool Preferences dialog 
box, and then set the following options:
• For Fidelity, drag the slider or type to set the value at 15 pixels.
• For Smoothness, drag the slider or type to set the value at 50%.
• Make sure that the Edit Selected Paths option is selected, with the value of Within 12 
Pixels so that you can add to an existing path by clicking the Pencil tool ( ) within that 
distance from the endpoint. Then click OK to close the dialog box.

LESSON 9
Drawing the ﬂ ower shape with the Pencil tool
Now you’re all set to draw the ﬂ ower.
1 Move the Pencil tool ( ) over the grayed shape of the ﬂ ower and start to trace the 
path. A dotted red line indicates where the line you are drawing will appear. After you 
draw a segment of one ﬂ ower petal, release the mouse so that you can see the results.
Notice that the path that appears is much smoother than the dotted red line that 
appeared as you drew. This is because you set a high Smoothness value for the Pencil 
tool.
2 Place the tip of the Pencil tool pointer near the endpoint of the line you drew so that 
the small X to the right of the pointer icon disappears, and then continue drawing the 
petal in short segments.
It is important that the path is continuous, that is, that the segments join as a single 
path. As long as the Pencil tool pointer appears without the small X in it as you begin 
drawing each successive segment, you can be conﬁ dent that the path you draw will be 
unbroken.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 333
Classroom in a Book
It is not important that your ﬂ ower shape match the template exactly for two reasons: 
First, it’s an informal shape, and second, you can reﬁ ne the path after you ﬁ nish drawing 
it, as explained in the next procedure. However, if you are dissatisﬁ ed with a segment 
you draw, you can choose Edit > Undo to remove just that segment and try again. 
Note: InDesign CS has multiple levels of undo, so you can choose Edit > Undo to step back 
through many recent actions. The exact number of undo steps possible may be limited by 
the amount of RAM on your computer, but can be as high as several hundred undos.
3 When you come back to the starting point, hold down Alt (Windows) or Option 
(Mac OS) so that the Pencil tool displays a small loop ( ); then the ﬁ nal segment you 
draw will close the ﬂ ower shape.
If the shape is less precise than you like, you can correct that by using the 
Smooth tool ( ).

LESSON 9
Merging two pencil-drawn paths
If you accidentally create a segment that is its own path rather than a continuation of your path drawing, 
you don’t have to undo that segment and start over. Instead, you can attach the two independent segments. 
Use the following procedure whenever you need to unite the two paths. If you have more than two separate 
segments to merge, attach them one at a time.
1  In the toolbar, select the Selection tool ( ).
2  Select the ﬁ rst of the paths and then hold down Shift and select the second path.
3  In the toolbar, select the Pencil tool ( ) and move it over the endpoint of one path that you want to 
connect to the second path.
4  Start to drag toward the endpoint of the second path and hold down Ctrl (Windows) or Command 
(Mac OS) as you draw to the second endpoint. The Pencil tool pointer appears with a small loop indicating 
that what you draw will merge the two paths.
5  When you ﬁ nish drawing, release the mouse and then release the Ctrl (Windows) or Command (Mac 
OS) key; then choose Edit > Deselect All. 
If necessary, repeat steps 2 through 5 to connect the end of the newly merged path with other separate 
segments, attaching the segments to the path one at a time.

Smoothing out the path drawing
The Smooth tool can eliminate slight wobbles and irregularities in paths that you draw 
with the Pencil tool. Like the Pencil tool, the Smooth tool includes controls that you can 
adjust for Fidelity and Smoothness.
If you are already satisﬁ ed with the shape of your ﬂ ower drawing, you do not need to do 
this procedure.
1 Using the Direct Selection tool ( ), select the path.
2 In the toolbox, hold down the Pencil tool until the button expands, showing you 
other tools, and select the Smooth tool ( ). 
3 Double-click the Smooth tool to open the Smooth tool Preferences dialog box, and 
set Fidelity at 15 and Smoothness at 50%. Then click OK. 
4 Drag the Smooth tool over any areas of your ﬂ ower path that you want to smooth.

Note: If the keyboard shortcut for Fit Page in Window doesn’t work for you, make sure that 
you pressed the number zero key above the letter keys, not the letter O or the zero on the 
numeric keypad.
You’ll do the rest of the drawing in this lesson with the Pen tool rather than the Pencil 
tool; the Pen tool is ideal for creating precise shapes and curves. 
Later on, when you are comfortable with the Pen tool, you can challenge yourself to 
create a precise replica of the template shape for the ﬂ ower by using the Pen tool. That 
procedure is described in the “On your own” section at the end of this lesson.

Drawing curved segments with the Pen tool
In this part of the lesson, you’ll learn how to draw smooth curved lines using the Pen 
tool. As with the straight-line segments you drew earlier to create the collar, drawing 
curves with the Pen tool involves positioning points that anchor the path. However, 
instead of simply clicking the Pen tool, you’ll drag to extend the two  direction lines that 
precisely inﬂ uence curve direction. When you release the mouse, a curve’s starting point 
is created with its direction lines. Then you drag the Pen tool to end the curve and to set 
the starting point and direction of the next curve.
1 Choose View > Snap to Document Grid to deselect it.
2 In the toolbox, select Preview Mode to hide all guides, grids, and frame edges.
Selecting a point on a curve
When you select a point that’s part of a curved segment, the segment displays additional 
controls that you can use to adjust a curve precisely. Before you begin drawing curves, 
it’s helpful to recognize these controls.
1 In the Layers palette, click the square to the far left of the Hair layer to display the eye 
icon (
). This contains the wavy lines you’ll use in this section.
2 Using the Zoom tool, zoom in on the set of wavy lines.
Pressing the Z key selects the Zoom tool in the toolbox.

LESSON 9
3 Press the A key to switch to the Direct Selection tool ( ), and then click any of the 
wavy lines. In the Layers palette, the Hair layer becomes selected, and the path and its 
anchor points appear in the Hair layer’s color of magenta.
4 With the Direct Selection tool still selected, select the second anchor point from 
the left on any of the wavy lines. When selected, the anchor point becomes solid and 
displays two direction lines.
The direction lines cause the anchor point to connect the two adjacent path segments as 
a continuous curve shaped by the direction lines. The angular collar path you drew in 
the previous section only has corners because its anchor points don’t have any direction 
lines.
As their names imply, the anchor points anchor the curved segments, and the direction 
lines control the direction of the curves. You can drag the direction lines or their 
endpoints, called  direction points, to adjust the shape of the curve.

5 When you ﬁ nish examining the anchor points, click a blank area of the page to 
deselect.
Drawing combinations of curved and  straight segments
When you drew curves for the previous shape, two direction lines pivoted together 
around each anchor point. Those anchor points are called smooth points because they 
connect segments as a continuous curve. You can use the Pen tool with a modiﬁ er key to 
drag each of the two direction lines at different angles, converting a smooth point into 
a corner point with two direction lines that move independently. The only difference 
between the corner points you ﬁ rst created in this lesson and the corner points you’ll 
create in this section is that these corner points will have direction lines.

items.

Drawing the head shape
Now that everything is ready for the head shape, you can start drawing. In this 
procedure, you’ll combine straight lines and curved ones, but you’ll also leave some 
straight segments that you’ll reﬁ ne with curves later in this lesson.
1 Press P to select the Pen tool ( ). Position the pointer on point 6 on the template 
so that the pointer appears with a slash; then click point 6. The slash indicates that the 
anchor points you add will connect to the existing path rather than to a separate path.

2 In the document window, zoom in so that you can see the nose, mouth, and chin.
3 With the path for the head still selected in the document window, press A to select 
the Direct Selection tool ( ). You must use the Direct Selection tool because the 
Selection tool displays the path’s bounding box, not its anchor points.
4 Press P to select the Pen tool ( ), and position it on point 6 (but don’t click). You’ll 
know it’s positioned on the point when you see a minus sign next to the pointer ( ).
5 With the Pen tool still positioned, hold down Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS). 
Notice that the pointer changes to the icon for the Convert Direction Point tool ( ) —
this switches to the actual tool, not the pen with a caret. Continue holding down Alt or 
Option as you drag down from point 6 to the red dot. Direction lines appear, converting 
the corner point to a smooth point.
Don’t be concerned that the segments between points 5, 6, and 7 don’t match the 
template. You’ll ﬁ ne-tune the segments in the following steps. First you’ll retract the 
upper direction line to restore the straight segment between points 5 and 6.
 If you Alt/Option-click a smooth point, you convert it to a corner point, removing its 
direction lines.

Different artists use various drawing styles. Some prefer to lay down all corners and 
curves correctly the ﬁ rst time, and others prefer to rough out a shape by clicking corner 
points, and then returning later to create and reﬁ ne the curves as you did in this section. 
With practice, you’ll discover which way you prefer to draw.
Drawing the eye
To draw the eye for the head, you’ll practice more techniques for interactively 
controlling corner angles and curve shapes as you draw. First, you’ll use keyboard 
shortcuts to quickly turn off and hide the document grid, which you don’t need for this 
section. 
Ordinarily, the directional lines that control the curves around an anchor point mirror 
each other, so that they have equal lengths and are 180 degrees from each other. In this 
procedure, you’ll use keyboard shortcuts to drag one directional line independently of 
its partner for the anchor point.

Creating a compound path
Now you’ll combine the eye with the head as a compound path. When you make a 
compound path, overlapping areas become holes. In this illustration, the eye will 
become a hole in the head through which you will be able to see the background behind 
the head. 
A compound path isn’t the same as a group, where different objects in the group retain 
their own attributes. All parts of a compound path have to be paths, and they will all 
share the same set of attributes such as color and stroke weight.

button to remove the temporary colored ﬁ ll. Then deselect everything and save the ﬁ le.
Note: When you use the Selection tool to select a compound path, it selects the entire 
compound path. To select a subpath, select the Direct Selection tool and Alt-click 
(Windows) or Option-click (Mac OS) as a subpath.
Creating a perfect semicircle
The ﬁ nished document contains a semicircle outside another circle, both located inside 
the head shape. Although you could draw the semicircle using the Pen tool, it’s easier to 
slice an arc out of a circle.
Duplicating as you scale
The semicircle you’ll create must be larger than, and concentric with, an existing circle. 
In a single action, you can scale the existing circle from the center and make a copy of 
the result.
1 In the Layers palette, click the eye icon for the Head / eye layer to hide it.
2 Click the square to the far left of the Circles layer to display the eye icon (
). This 
layer contains the circle shape you’ll duplicate.

3 Make sure that the Circles layer is targeted in the Layers palette. In the document 
window, zoom in on the circles, leaving some room for the larger circle you’ll create.
4 Using the Selection tool ( ), select the blue (outer) circle.
5 Click the Transform palette tab (or choose Window > Transform) to make the 
palette visible.
6 In the Transform palette, make sure that the center proxy point ( ) is selected.
This proxy point determines that the next action you take in the Transform palette 
will be measured from the center of the selection rather than from one of the edges or 
corners. Make certain that Constrain proportion for scaling ( ) is selected in the lower 
left hand corner of the control palette. 
7 In the Scale X Percentage option (
) in the Transform palette, enter 120 and then 
press Alt+Enter (Windows) or Option+Return (Mac OS). A larger duplicate of the 
circle appears.

If you wanted to scale only the horizontal (X) dimension of the circle, you’d press only 
Enter or Return after typing in the value. In this case, you pressed Ctrl (Windows) or 
Command (Mac OS) to also make the other (Y) dimension scale proportionally, and 
you pressed Alt or Option to duplicate the original circle using the new scale value.
Slicing a path with the Scissors tool
Now you can simply slice off the part of the circle that you don’t need.
1 Choose the Direct Selection tool ( ), and make sure that the larger circle is selected 
so that you can see its anchor points and path.
Note: If the larger circle still displays a bounding box after you switch to the Direct Selection 
tool, deselect it and then use the Direct Selection tool to select it again.
2 In the toolbox, click to select the Scissors tool (

3 Using the Scissors tool, click the new circle at the anchor point on its left side. Then 
click the anchor point on its right side. The original path has become two separate paths 
and only the lower semicircle remains selected.
Clicking left anchor point, and right anchor point. (These icons are enlarged to show
additional data.)
Note: You don’t have to click the Scissors tool on a point, but because you’re creating a 
perfect semicircle here, the circle’s anchor points are convenient places to slice.
4 Switch to the Selection tool ( ), and make sure that the bottom of the larger circle is 
selected. 
5 Press the Delete key to remove the lower arc path.

Adding an end shape to an open path
You can instantly add an end shape, such as an arrowhead, to either end of a path by 
using the Stroke palette. Here, you’ll add a loop to the end of the semicircle you just 
created.
1 With the Selection tool ( ), select the semicircle.
2 Click the Stroke palette tab (or choose Window > Stroke) to make the palette visible. 
By default, the Stroke palette appears only partially expanded, so that only the Weight 
option appears.
3 Click the double arrows to the left of the word Stroke. The palette collapses further, 
so that only the tabs are visible. Click the double arrows again so that all the stroke 
options are visible.
4 In the Stroke palette, choose Circle on the Start pop-up menu. This adds a circle 
shape to the start of the path—the ﬁ rst point drawn when the path was created.
5 Deselect everything, zoom out to see the entire page, and then save the ﬁ le.

 To reverse the start and end of a path, use the Direct Selection tool to select a point on 
the path and then choose Object > Reverse Path.
Creating a texture effect using a colorized image
In the ﬁ nal version of this ﬁ le, you can see that the head is ﬁ lled with a texture, which is 
actually an image placed directly inside the compound path that you’ll colorize to create 
a duotone. You’ll add the image to the compound path now.
1 In the Layers palette, click the square to the far left of the Head / eye layer to display 
the eye icon (
), and make sure that the Head / eye layer is targeted.
2 Using the Selection tool ( ), select the head. Using the Selection tool selects the entire 
compound path that you created from the head path and eye path earlier in this lesson.
Now you’ll use a keyboard shortcut for placing a ﬁ le.
3 Press Ctrl+D (Windows) or Command+D (Mac OS). Double-click the ﬁ le 09_c.psd 
in the ID_09 folder.
The image appears inside the head automatically, because the head was selected when 
you placed the image. Notice that you can still see through the eye. 
Now you’ll use InDesign to colorize the image, which you can do because the image was 
saved as a 1-bit or grayscale image.
4 In the toolbar, select the Stroke box and press the / (slash) key to apply None as the 
stroke color. Then press Ctrl+Shift+A (Windows) or Command+Shift+A (Mac OS) to 
deselect all.
5 Using the Direct Selection tool ( ), click the image inside the head. The bounding 
box for the texture image you placed inside the head shape is selected.

6 Select the Fill box in the toolbox, and then in the Swatches palette select 
TRUMATCH 50-b4. The black areas of the texture image are replaced by a dark brown 
color.
7 Deselecting the image, switch to the Selection tool ( ), and select the head again.
8 In the Swatches palette, select TRUMATCH 50-b4 90%. The white areas of the image 
are replaced by a lighter brown color, so that the textured image is more subtle and has 
no white or black areas.
9 Deselect everything, and save the ﬁ le.
Creating and adding an inline graphic
You can add a graphic between any text characters or spaces so that the graphic ﬂ ows 
with the text as you add or remove text. Such a graphic is called an inline graphic. You 
can use an ornamental font, such as a dingbat, or you can insert a graphic that you 
create yourself.
Using advanced settings for the Polygon tool
The Polygon tool contains controls that alter the shapes you create. You can adjust the 
number of points in the polygon and set the insets between points to make starlike 
shapes.
1 In the Layers palette, click the square to the far left of the Text layer to display the eye 
icon (
), and make sure that the Text layer is targeted.
2 Choose View > Show Document Grid and then choose View > Snap to Document 
Grid.

3 In the document window, zoom in to the lower right area of page 1 to about 200% or 
higher, so that you can clearly see the smallest unit of the document grid.
4 In the toolbox, hold down the Rectangle tool ( ) to see more tool options and select 
the Polygon tool (
). Then double-click the Polygon tool to open the Polygon Settings 
dialog box.
5 In Number of Sides, select 8, and in Star Inset, select 40%. Then click OK. 
6 Drag the pointer crosshairs diagonally across any one of the document grid squares 
to create a tiny star shape.
Note: It is not necessary to hold down the Shift key as you drag to constrain the shape 
because the Snap to Document Grid is turned on. You should still get a perfectly 
symmetrical star shape.
7 Choose View > Hide Document Grid and View > Snap to Document Grid to deselect 
that command.
Now that you’ve created the star, you’ll simply paste it into the text to create an inline 
graphic.

Placing an inline graphic
1 With the polygon star still selected, choose Edit > Cut to remove the star and place it 
on your computer clipboard.
2 Select the Type tool ( ), and then click an insertion point after the period at the end 
of the sentence at the bottom of the text that reads “…we have a class for you.”
3 Choose Edit > Paste to put the graphic directly into the text where you clicked the 
insertion point. Turn on the document grid to verify the position by selecting View > 
Show Document Grid.
Depending on where the insertion point was ﬂ ashing when you placed the inline 
graphic, the graphic might be right up against a character in the text and a bit too high. 
You can shift the baseline alignment for the star and add space around it, because the 
inline graphic behaves as if it were simply another text character.

4 With the Type tool still selected, click an insertion point just before the star and press 
the spacebar to add a little more space as needed before or after the star shape.
5 Using the Type tool ( ), drag across the star to select it. In the Character palette, 
change the Baseline Shift value (

Reﬂ ecting objects
The back of the completed invitation (page 2) will use duplicates of objects from the 
front. The duplicates will be reﬂ ected so that you see them as if from behind. You will 
quickly duplicate the objects on page 1 and then use the Transform palette to ﬂ ip them.
1 In the Layers palette, make the Hair, Circles, Head / eye, Squares, Flower, and Collar 
layers visible in the document, and hide all other layers including any currently visible 
Template layers. Make sure that all visible layers are also unlocked; that is, they do not 
display the crossed-out pencil icons (
).
You can’t select objects on hidden layers, so don’t be concerned about the lock status of 
hidden layers.

LESSON 9
On your own
In this lesson, you used the Pencil tool to draw a ﬂ ower shape. You can also use the 
Pen tool to draw that shape. You can try recreating the ﬂ ower with the Pen tool as an 
experiment, so that you can compare the two methods.
1 Make sure that the Snap to Document Grid command is not selected on the View 
menu.
2 In the Layers palette, click the eye icons (
) for all layers. Then click the square to the 
far left of the Template 3 layer and the Practice layer to display the eye icons, so that they 
are the only visible layers. Then select the Practice layer so that it is targeted.
3 In the document window, scroll or zoom, if necessary, so that you can easily see all 
the numbers and colored direction-line guidelines on the ﬂ ower template.
4 Select the Pen tool ( ). Then click and drag from point 1 to each point through point 
12 to set anchor points, each time aligning the direction lines with the red lines and dots 
on the template layer. 
5 After you draw through point 12, remember to look for the small loop next to the 
pointer before you click point 1 again. This ensures that your ﬁ nal click will close the 
shape. When you drag from this ﬁ nal anchor point, drag over the blue line and dot on 
the template for point 1, not the red ones.

6 Create two separate lines and join them by drawing a line between the lines using 
the Pencil tool and holding down the Ctrl key (Windows) or Command key (Mac OS) 
while drawing the line between the two paths. When drawing, try to overlap the existing 
lines slightly.
7 Experiment with placing different ends on lines you have created using the options 
available in the Stroke palette. Try the various arrows and shapes. Also try the various 
line styles and examine the options to create your own custom line styles, available from 
the Stroke palette menu.
8 Create two boxes that are slightly overlapping on the corners and experiment with 
the various Pathﬁ nder options that combine separate objects in a variety of ways. 
Choose Window > Pathﬁ nder to access this palette.
Review questions
1 Why is the Direct Selection tool more useful than the Selection tool when drawing or 
editing paths?
2 What is the key difference between smooth and corner points?
3 Which tool can change an anchor point from a corner point to a smooth point or 
vice versa?
4 How do you make sure that a transformation (rotating, scaling, etc.) occurs in 
relation to the center of an object?
Review answers
1 The Selection tool displays only the path’s bounding box. The Direct Selection tool 
displays the path itself, and the exact location of the anchor points on it.
2 The two direction lines of a smooth point always exist at the same angle. The 
direction lines of a corner point (if present) usually exist at different angles, creating a 
corner at the anchor point.
3 You can switch between smooth and corner points using the Convert Direction Point 
tool ( ). It’s grouped with the Pen tool in the toolbox.
4 With the object selected, click the center of the proxy (
) in the Transform palette.

10 Working with Transparency
InDesign CS delivers an array of 
transparency features to feed your 
imagination and creativity. Choose 
combinations of settings to exploit the 
varied possibilities for complex and 
elegant interactions among overlapping 
layers of colors. You not only get control 
over opacity and color blendings using 
InDesign, but you can work with 
imported and exported ﬁ les that use 
transparency.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

Working with Transparency
LESSON 10
In this lesson you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Colorize an imported black-and-white graphic.
• Change the opacity of objects drawn in InDesign.
• Apply blending modes to overlapping objects.
• Apply feathering to soften the edges of objects.
• Adjust transparency settings for imported Adobe Photoshop ﬁ les.
• Adjust transparency settings for imported Adobe Illustrator ﬁ les.
• Import ﬁ les with transparency set in Illustrator.
• Apply transparency settings to text.
• Apply drop shadows to text and graphics.
Getting started
The project for this lesson is a menu for a ﬁ ctional restaurant, Bistro nonXista. By 
applying transparency into objects in a series of layers, you’ll create a visual richness of 
color interactions right in InDesign.
To ensure that the tools and palettes function exactly as described in this lesson, delete 
or deactivate (by renaming) the InDesign Defaults ﬁ le and the InDesign SavedData ﬁ le. 
See “Restoring default preferences” on page 2. 
1 Start Adobe InDesign.
2 Choose File > Open, and open the 10_a.indd ﬁ le in the ID_10 folder, which is located 
within the IDCIB folder on your hard disk.
Note: If you have not already copied the resource ﬁ les for this lesson onto your hard disk 
from the ID_10 folder from the Adobe InDesign CS Classroom in a Book CD, do so now.

3 Choose File > Save As, name the ﬁ le 10_Menu.indd, and save it in the ID_10 folder.
The menu appears as a long, blank page because all layers are currently hidden. You’ll 
reveal these layers one by one as you need them, so that it will be easy to focus on the 
speciﬁ c objects and tasks that you’ll do in this lesson.
4 To see what the ﬁ nished project will look like, choose File > Open, and open the 
10_b.indd ﬁ le in the ID_10 folder, which is located within the IDCIB folder on your 
hard disk.
5 When you are ready to start working, you can either close the 10_b.indd ﬁ le or 
choose Window > 10_Menu.indd to switch back to your own lesson document, leaving 
the sample of the ﬁ nished ﬁ le open for reference.

LESSON 10
Importing and colorizing a  black-and-white image
You’ll begin by working with the background layer for the menu. This layer serves as a 
random textured background that will be visible through the objects layered above it 
that have transparency settings. Since there’s nothing below this layer in the layer stack, 
you won’t specify any changes for this layer’s opacity.
1 In the Layers palette, select the Background layer, scrolling as necessary to ﬁ nd it 
at the bottom of the layer stack. Make sure that the two boxes to the left of the layer 
name show that the layer is visible (eye icon appears) and unlocked (lock icon does not 
appear).
2 Choose File > Place, and then locate, select, and open the 10_c.tif ﬁ le in your ID_10 
folder.
3 Move the loaded-graphic pointer ( ) to the upper left corner of the page and 
click, so that the image ﬁ lls the entire page, including any margins. After you place the 
graphic, it remains selected. Do not deselect.
4 With the graphic still selected, open the Swatches palette and select the Fill box ( ). 
Scroll down the list of swatches to ﬁ nd the Lime 80% tint, and select it. The white areas 
of the image are now the 80% tint of the green color, but the black areas are still black. 
Click anywhere on the pasteboard to deselect.
5 In the toolbox, use the Direct Selection tool ( ) to select the image again, and then 
select the Aqua color in the Swatches palette. The Aqua color replaces black in the 
original image, leaving the Lime 80% areas as they were.
Note: Remember that the Direct Selection tool appears as a hand ( ) when it is over a 
frame, but it still selects the image contents when you click.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 373

6 In the  Layers palette, select the empty box to the left of the Background layer name 
to lock the layer. Leave the Background layer visible so that you can see the results of the 
transparency work you do above this layer.
As you now know, the key to converting a black-and-white image to a two-color image 
is that you use the right tools to select the object. Your choice of either the Selection 
tool or the Direct Selection tool determines whether the swatch you specify replaces the 
black or the white parts of the image.
Applying transparency settings
The ability to change the opacity of an object in a single control option is just the 
beginning of the transparency functionality in InDesign CS. Not only can you change 
the opacity of ﬁ lls and strokes on objects drawn or typed in InDesign and of imported 
images and text—including photographs—but there’s more. You can also use blending 
modes, feathering, and drop shadows in simple procedures. You can even import objects 
created with existing transparency properties and compound the effect with InDesign.
In this project, you’ll progress through layer by layer rather than technique by technique, 
so you’ll get plenty of practice using the various transparency options. In this way, you’ll 
see the interactions between transparent objects as the project builds, one layer at a 
time.

LESSON 10
Changing the opacity of solid-color objects
Now that you have ﬁ lled the underlying layer with color and texture, you can start 
adding transparency features to the layers stacked above it. You’ll start with a series of 
simple shapes with solid ﬁ lls, drawn in InDesign.
1 In the Layers palette, select the Art1 layer so that it is the active layer, and click the 
small boxes on the left of the layer name to unlock the layer (removing the crossed-out 
pencil icon ( ) and make it visible, displaying the eye icon (
).
2 Using the Selection tool ( ), click the gold background on the right side of the page. 
This background is simply a rectangular frame with a solid ﬁ ll, drawn in InDesign. 
3 Choose Window > Transparency to open the Transparency palette.
4 For Opacity, click the arrow button to open the slider, and then drag to set the 
opacity at 60%. Or, you can type 60% in the Opacity option and press Enter. Notice that 
you can now see the Background layer through the gold background on the Art1 layer.
5 Select the black semicircle at the top of the left side of the page, and then choose 
Window > Swatches to open the Swatches palette. Make sure that the Fill box is selected 
( ) and select Lime (not Lime 80%) to apply a ﬁ ll color to the semicircle.
6 With the semicircle still selected, go to the Transparency palette and set the Opacity 
value at 40%. The semicircle now appears as just a subtle variation in color against the 
textured background.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 375
Classroom in a Book
7 Repeat steps 5 and 6 for each of the solid circles on the Art1 layer, using the following 
settings:
• Left side, middle: color=Navy, Opacity=80%
• Left side, bottom: color=Gold, Opacity=70%
• Right side, top: color=Aqua, Opacity=70%
• Right side, middle: color=Dark Red, Opacity=60%
• Right side, bottom (semicircle): color=Black, Opacity=10%
Applying the  Multiply blending mode
An Opacity setting changes a selected object by creating a color that combines the color 
values of the object with the objects below it. This creates the impression that the object 
is semi-transparent. Blending modes give you another way to create color interactions 
between layered objects.
In this procedure, you’ll see the differences as you ﬁ rst change the opacity and then 
apply the Multiply blending mode to the same objects.
1 Using the Selection tool ( ), select the subtle green semicircle at the top of the left 
side of the page.

LESSON 10
2 In the Transparency palette, open the blending mode pop-up menu (which currently 
shows Normal selected) and select Multiply. Notice the change in the appearance of the 
colors.
3 Select the black half-circle at the bottom of the right side of the page, and apply 
Multiply blending mode, using the same method as in step 2. 
4 Choose File > Save.
For more information about the different blending modes, see “Selecting blending 
modes” in InDesign Help. This topic describes the results generated by each of the 
blending modes.
Applying feathering to the margins of an image
Another way to apply transparency to an object is to use feathering. Feathering applies 
a gradient transparency to the edges, softening the margins of the object. This creates a 
more subtle transition between the object and any underlying images.
1 If the faint black half-circle at the bottom of the right side is not still selected, use the 
Selection tool to select it now.
2 Choose Object > Feather to open the Feather dialog box.
3 Select the Feather check box, and then select the Preview check box so you can see 
the results as you adjust the settings.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 377

4 In Feather Width, type 0.3" (including the quotation mark to indicate inches as 
the unit of measurement). Leave the Corners option set as Diffused. Notice how the 
margins of the faint black circle are now blurred, and that the measurement units 
appear as “in” instead of the quotation mark. Click OK to close the dialog box.
5 Select the gold circle at the bottom of the left side of the page.
6 Using the same techniques that you used in steps 1–5 to give the black half-circle a 
feathered edge, apply a 0.25" feather to the gold circle.
7 In the Layers palette, click to lock the Art1 layer and then choose File > Save.
Adjusting the transparency settings for EPS images
Up to this point in the lesson, you have applied various transparency settings to objects 
drawn in InDesign. You can also set opacity value, blending mode, and feathering 
options to Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) documents that you create in programs such 
as Adobe Illustrator.
1 In the Layers palette, unlock and make visible the Art2 layer.
2 In the toolbox, make sure that the Selection tool ( ) is selected.

Note: Ctrl+click (Windows) or Command+click (Mac OS) is the keyboard shortcut you use 
when you want to select an object that is stacked behind another object in the layout. It is 
especially useful when both objects are on the same layer, as they are in this case.
6 Set the following options for the small circle:
• In the Transparency palette, set the Opacity at 80%.
• In the Swatches palette, select Dark Red.
7 Scroll if necessary so that you can see three more small circles in the top right area of 
the page, and assign the following color swatches and opacity values to them:
• Top small circle: Navy, 50% opacity
• Middle small circle: Dark Red, 35% opacity
• Lowest small circle: Turquoise, 50% opacity. For this circle only, also choose Object > 
Feather, select the Feather check box, specify 0.21 inches as the Feather Width, and click 
OK.

Adjusting transparency for Photoshop images
In this procedure, you’ll apply transparency to an imported Photoshop ﬁ le. Although 
this example uses a monochromatic image, you can also apply InDesign transparency 
settings to complex multicolor photographs that you import from Photoshop.
1 In the Layers palette, select the Art3 layer and make it visible and unlocked. If you 
ﬁ nd it easier to see your work, you can click the eye icon (
) to hide either the Art1 or 
Art2 layer or both, but leave at least one underlying layer visible so that you can see the 
results of the transparency interactions .
2 Using the Selection tool ( ), click the black starburst image on the upper right side 
of the page.
3 On the Transparency palette, type 50% as the Opacity value. 
4 Switch to the Direct Selection tool ( ), move the pointer over the starburst image so 
that it appears as a hand ( ), and then click once to reselect the image.
5 In the Swatches palette, select the Dark Red color swatch so that the red color 
replaces the black areas of the image. If you have other layers visible below the Art3 
layer, you see the starburst as a muted orange color. If no other layers are visible, 
the starburst is red. Leave the starburst image selected, or reselect it with the Direct 
Selection tool now.
6 In the Transparency palette, select Screen blending mode from the pop-up list. Leave 
the Opacity value at 100%. Depending on which layers are visible, the starburst changes 
colors in various ways after you apply this change.

Importing and adjusting Illustrator ﬁ les that use transparency
When you import Adobe Illustrator ﬁ les into your InDesign layout, InDesign CS 
recognizes and preserves any transparency interactions that were applied in Illustrator. 
You can further adjust the transparency of the imported graphic by applying InDesign 
settings for opacity, blending modes, and feathering to the entire image.
1 Make sure that the Art3 layer is targeted in the Layers palette and that the Selection

layers so that only the Art3 layer appears and you can see the transparency color 
interactions within the original image. Then click the boxes again to make the Art2, 
Art1, and Background layers visible. Notice that the white “olive” shape is completely 
opaque while the other shapes are partly transparent.
5 With the glasses graphic still selected, change the Opacity setting in the Transparency 
palette to 80%. Notice that you can now see the black spiral behind the white olive and 
that the glasses are more subdued in color.

Applying transparency settings to text
Changing the opacity of text is as easy as applying transparency settings to graphic 
objects in your layout. In this topic, you’ll change the color and opacity of some words 
that you will add by using the InDesign Type tool.
1 Unlock and make visible the Type layer.
2 In the toolbox, select the Type tool ( ), click to place an insertion point in the text 
frame “I THINK, THEREFORE I DINE,” and choose Edit > Select All. If necessary, 
zoom in so that you can read the text easily. 
3 In the Swatches palette, select [Paper].
4 Switch to the Selection tool and click to select the same text frame.
5 In the Transparency palette, select Overlay blending mode and type 70% as the 
Opacity value.
Note: You cannot specify transparency options when the Type tool is active. When you 
switch to the Selection tool, those options are available again.

Creating a drop shadow
You can create the impression that an object is embossed or ﬂ oating above the page by 
adding a drop shadow. Then, by selected transparency settings that apply only to the 
drop shadow, you can soften the shadow without changing the sharp edges of the object 
itself.
1 Using the Selection tool, select the large “Bistro nonXista” image in the center of the 
page. This graphic is an imported EPS ﬁ le, created in Adobe Illustrator.
2 Choose Object > Drop Shadow.
3 In the Drop Shadow dialog box, select the following settings:
• Select the Drop Shadow check box to enable the other options.
• Select the Preview check box so that you can see the results in the document as you 
change the settings.
• In Mode, select Multiply.
• In Opacity, type 50%.
• In both X Offset and Y Offset, type 0.0972 in (or use quotation marks: 0.0972").
• In Blur, type 0.02 in.
• Leave [Black] selected under Color.
4 Click OK to close the dialog box. Then, using the Selection tool ( ), click the text 
frame at the bottom of the page, with ﬁ ve city names. (This is simply typed text created 
in InDesign.) If necessary, zoom in so that you can see the text easily.

5 Choose Object > Drop Shadow, and conﬁ rm the following settings:
• Select the Drop Shadow check box and the Preview check box.
• In Mode, select Normal.
• In Opacity, type 50%.
• In both X Offset and Y Offset, type 0.03".
• In Blur, type 0.02".
• Under Color, select Swatches in the pop-up menu, and then click the Navy swatch.
6 Click OK to close the dialog box.
7 Lock all layers. Choose File > Save.
 The X Offset and Y Offset values determine the horizontal and vertical lengths of the 
drop shadow. Positive numbers offset the shadow below and to the right of the selected ob-
ject while negative values offset the shadow above and to the left .
Note: When you export your InDesign document as an Adobe PDF, transparency is 
preserved when you open the ﬁ le with Adobe Acrobat 5.0 or later, including the Adobe 
Reader. Earlier versions of Adobe Acrobat will display all objects with full opacity.
You can install Adobe Reader 6.0 from the Adobe InDesign CS Classroom in a Book CD 
or download your free copy from the Adobe Web site.
To see your work as it will look when printed, select the Preview Mode button in the 
lower right corner of the toolbox. 
Congratulations! You have now completed this lesson.

On your own
Try some of the following ideas for working with InDesign transparency options:
1 Scroll to a blank area of the pasteboard and create some shapes (using the drawing 
tools or by importing new copies of some of the image ﬁ les used in this lesson) on a 
new layer. Position your shapes so that they overlap each other, at least partially. Then:
• Select the topmost object in your arrangement of shapes and experiment with other 
blending modes, such as Luminosity, Hard Light, and Difference, by selecting them in 
the Transparency palette. Then select a different object and select the same blending 
modes to compare the results. When you have a sense of what the various modes do, 
select all your objects and select Normal as the blending mode.
• In the Transparency palette, change the Opacity value of some of the objects but not 
others. Then select different objects in your arrangement and use the Object > Send 
Backwards and Object >  Bring Forward commands to observe different results.
• Experiment with combinations of different opacities and different blending modes 
applied to an object. Then do the same with other objects that partially overlap the ﬁ rst 
object to explore the enormous number of different effects you can create.
2 Double-click the page 1 icon in the Pages palette to center it in the document 
window. Then try clicking the eye icons for the different Art layers one at a time, to see 
the differences this creates in the overall effect of the project.
3 Choose Help > InDesign Help. At the top of the left pane of the Help window, click 
Search. Then in the Find Pages Containing box, type Creating, saving, and loading, 
and then click Search. After a short wait, click “Creating, saving, and loading custom 
ﬂ attener presets” in the lower area of the left pane to open that topic in the right pane. 
Then follow the procedure described there for creating a ﬂ attener style for exporting 
transparency pages to PDF.

LESSON 10
Review questions
1 How do you change the color of the white areas of a black-and-white image? The 
black areas?
2 How can you change transparency effects without changing the Opacity value of an 
object?
3 What is the importance of the stacking order of layers and of objects within layers 
when you work with transparency?
4 Will the transparency effects you create in InDesign CS appear in a PDF that you 
export from InDesign?
Review answers
1 To change the white areas, select the object with the Selection tool ( ) and then 
select the color in the Swatches palette. To change the black areas, select the object with 
the Direct Selection tool ( ) and then select the color you want to use in the Swatches 
palette.
2 Besides selecting the object and changing the Opacity value in the Transparency 
palette, you can also create transparency effects by changing the blending mode, 
feathering the edges of the object, or adding drop shadows that have transparency 
settings. Blending modes determine how the base color and the blend color will be 
combined to produce a resulting color. For more information about blending modes, 
see “Selecting blending modes” in InDesign online Help.
3 The transparency of an object affects the view of objects below (behind) it in the 
stacking order. For example, objects below a semitransparent object can be seen behind 
it—like objects behind a colored plastic ﬁ lm. Opaque objects block the view of the area 
behind them in the stacking order, regardless of whether the objects behind them have 
reduced Opacity values, feathering, or blending modes.
4 Yes, if you open the PDF in Adobe Acrobat 5.0 or 6.0 or Adobe Reader 5.0 or 6.0. In 
earlier versions of Acrobat, the objects appear with all objects at 100% opacity.

11 Creating Interactive
Documents
With Adobe InDesign CS you can create 
interactive PDF documents including 
hyperlinks and movies. These can be 
created using existing content and the 
same tools you use for building your 
printed documents.

Creating Interactive Documents
LESSON 11
In this lesson you will learn how to do the following:
• Add interactive hyperlinks to your InDesign document.
• Create bookmarks that will export into an Adobe PDF.
• Use multimedia elements, including movies.
• Create buttons with actions.
Getting started
In this lesson you’ll work on an interactive brochure for a ﬂ ower and garden products 
distributor. You will add hyperlinks, movies, bookmarks and buttons to this document.
Before you begin, restore the default preferences for Adobe InDesign, using the 
procedure in “Restoring default preferences” on page 2. 
1 Start Adobe InDesign.
2 Choose File > Open and open the 11_a.indd ﬁ le in the ID_11 folder, located inside 
the Lessons folder within the IDCIB folder on your hard disk.
3 Choose File > Save As, rename the ﬁ le 11_interactive.indd and save it in the ID_11 
folder.
4 To see what the completed PDF document will look like, open the 11_c.pdf ﬁ le in the 
same folder, using Adobe Acrobat or Acrobat Reader. You can also locate 11_b.indd ﬁ le 
in this same folder. This is the completed version of the InDesign document that was 
used to create the Adobe PDF ﬁ le. When you are ready to resume working on the lesson 
document, you can close the 11_c.pdf ﬁ le and, if necessary, the 11_b.indd ﬁ le.
Note: If you have not already copied the resource ﬁ les for this lesson onto your hard disk 
from the ID_11 folder from the Adobe InDesign CS Classroom in a Book CD, do so now. 
See “Copying the Classroom in a Book ﬁ les” on page 2. 
Bookmarks
A bookmark is a type of link where you click on the text and are taken to a speciﬁ c 
destination. Bookmarks make it easier to navigate documents exported as Adobe PDF 
ﬁ les. Bookmarks created using InDesign appear in the Bookmarks tab on the left side of 
the Acrobat or Adobe Reader window. You will have InDesign automatically create some 
bookmarks using Styles applied to text. You will then organize these bookmarks and 
also add your own.

Button event types
Events determine how behaviors are activated in buttons when the document is exported to Adobe PDF. 
(In Acrobat, events are called triggers.)
Mouse Up–When the mouse button is released after a click. This is the most commonly used event, because 
it gives the user one last chance to drag the cursor off the button and not activate the behavior.
Mouse Down–When the mouse button is clicked (without being released). Unless you have a speciﬁ c 
reason for using Mouse Down, it’s preferable to use Mouse Up so that users have a chance to cancel the 
behavior.
Mouse Enter–When the mouse pointer enters the button area deﬁ ned by the button’s bounding box.
Mouse Exit–When the mouse pointer exits the button area.
On Focus–When the button receives focus, either through a mouse action or pressing the Tab key.
On Blur–When the focus moves to a different button or form ﬁ eld.

Button behavior types
When you create a behavior, you specify the event that causes the behavior. (In Acrobat, behaviors are 
called actions.) You can assign the following behaviors to occur when the event type is activated:
Close–Closes the PDF document.
Exit–Exits the application, such as Adobe Reader, in which the PDF document is open.
Go to Anchor–Jumps to the speciﬁ ed bookmark or hyperlink anchor in the InDesign document you specify.
Go to [page]–Jumps to the ﬁ rst, last, previous, or next page in the PDF document. Select an option from 
the Zoom menu to determine how the page is displayed.
Go to Previous View–Jumps to the most recently viewed page in the PDF document.
Go to Next View–Jumps to a page after going to the previous view. In the same way that a Forward button 
is available in a Web browser only after someone clicks the Back button, this option is available only if the 
user has jumped to a previous view.
Go to URL–Opens the Web page of the speciﬁ ed URL.
Movie–Lets you play, pause, stop, or resume the selected movie. Only movies that have been added to the 
document appear in the Movie menu.
Open File–Launches and opens the ﬁ le that you specify. If you specify a ﬁ le that is not PDF, the reader 
needs the native application to open it successfully. Specify an absolute pathname (such as c:\docs\
sample.pdf ).
Show/Hide Fields–Toggles between showing and hiding a ﬁ eld in a PDF document.
Sound–Lets you play, pause, stop, or resume the selected sound clip. Only sound clips that have been added 
to the document appear in the Sound menu.
View Zoom–Displays the page according to the zoom option you specify. You can change the page zoom 
level (such as Actual Size), the page layout (such as Continuous–Facing), or the rotation orientation.

About movie posters
A poster is the image that represents a media clip. Each movie or sound can appear with or without a 
poster. If the poster in InDesign is larger than the movie, the poster is clipped to the size of the movie in the 
exported PDF document. For best results, use a poster that is the same size as the movie; use the Scale tool 
to resize the page item.
You cannot simply use a placed image as a poster. Instead, specify any of the following types of poster 
images in the Movie Options or Sound Options dialog box:
None–Shows no poster for the movie or sound clip. This option is useful if you want the movie or sound 
clip to not be visible on the page. For example, you may want the media to be played only when you turn 
the page, or you may want a more complex design beneath the movie to show instead of the poster.
Standard–Displays a generic movie or sound poster that isn’t based on the contents of the ﬁ le. To use a 
different standard poster, save an image as StandardMoviePoster.jpg or StandardSoundPoster.jpg, and 
replace the existing ﬁ le of the same name. (Use the system search utility to locate the existing poster ﬁ les.)
Default Poster–Displays the poster image packaged with the movie ﬁ le. If the selected movie doesn’t have a 
frame designated as the poster, the ﬁ rst frame of the movie is used as the poster image.
Choose Image as Poster–Lets you select an image to use as the poster. Click Browse, and then double-click 
the image you want to use. You can select bitmap graphics, not vector graphics, for posters.

In this project, you’ll gather together a collection of several InDesign documents, each 
representing one chapter of a cookbook. Using InDesign CS, you’ll assemble these 
 chapters into a book so that you can easily create common elements, such as a table of 
contents, index, uniﬁ ed page numbering, styles, and color deﬁ nitions.
To ensure that the tools and palettes function exactly as described in this lesson, delete 
or deactivate (by renaming) the InDesign Defaults ﬁ le and the InDesign SavedData ﬁ le. 
See “Restoring default preferences” on page 2. 
Note: If you have not already copied the resource ﬁ les for this lesson onto your hard disk 
from the ID_12 folder from the Adobe InDesign CS Classroom in a Book CD, do so now. 
See “Copying the Classroom in a Book ﬁ les” on page 2.

Deﬁ ning a book
Your project will pull together four existing chapters into a book. In InDesign, deﬁ ning 
a book means that you specify the relationships among multiple existing ﬁ les, including 
which ﬁ les are included in the book and in what order they appear.
The sample ﬁ les you’ll use for this project are works in progress, so most of the pages 
are merely placeholders for content that would be added at some future date. Because 
of this, you’ll see many blank or nearly blank pages if you open and scroll through the 
various chapters.
Your ﬁ rst step will involve renaming the ﬁ les for this lesson.
Rename the six ﬁ les for this lesson as follows:
• Rename the 12_c.indd 12_Starters.indd.
• Rename the 12_d.indd 12_Entrees.indd.
• Rename a copy of 12_e.indd 12_Nibbles.indd.
• Rename a copy of 12_f.indd 12_Finishes.indd.
• Rename a copy of 12_g.indd 12_TOC.indd.
• Rename a copy of 12_h.indd 12_Index.indd.
Now you can start building a book using the ﬁ rst four of these copied ﬁ les.
Note: If your computer alerts you that the ﬁ les are locked or can not be renamed, use the 
following procedure to unlock the ﬁ les.
• (Windows) Right-click the ﬁ le and choose Properties. Then deselect the Read-Only 
check box and click OK.
• (Mac OS) Select the “12_c.indd copy” ﬁ le and choose File > Get Info > General 
Information. Then deselect the Locked check box and close the Info window.

LESSON 12
Creating a book ﬁ le
The next task is to deﬁ ne which InDesign ﬁ les will be part of the book.
1 Start Adobe InDesign.
2 Choose File > New > Book.
3 In the New Book dialog box, type 12_Book.indb as the ﬁ lename and save the ﬁ le in 
the ID_12 folder. The  Book palette opens, but it is empty.
Note: An .indb ﬁ le is not like other InDesign documents. If you double-click an .indb ﬁ le in 
your desktop or Finder, no documents actually open, but the Book palette appears.
4 In the Book palette menu, choose  Add Document, to open the Add Documents 
dialog box.
5 Open the ID_12 folder and select four of the documents you renamed: 12_
Starters.indd, 12_Entrees.indd, 12_Nibbles.indd, and 12_Finishes.indd. Do not add the 
index or table of contents ﬁ les at this time.
 To select multiple ﬁ les in one step, click one of the four documents and then Ctrl+click 
(Windows) or Command+click (Mac OS) each of the other three ﬁ les. Or, you can add 
documents one at a time, repeating steps 4–6 for each of the four ﬁ les.

6 With all four ﬁ les selected, click Add (Windows) or Open (Mac OS).
The four document names now appear in the Book palette. Notice that the pages for 
each chapter also appear in the palette.
7 Examine each of the four open documents and notice the order in which the 
ﬁ les appear. The order in your Book palette may differ from the illustration above, 
depending on the order in which you selected and added the ﬁ les.
Setting the order  and pagination
The plan for the cookbook is to organize the chapters by the order they would be 
served in a meal, beginning with appetizers (“Nibbles”) and progressing on to desserts 
(“Finishes”). Your next task is to organize the chapters in the order appropriate for the 
book, so that the sequence and page numbers ﬂ ow as needed. 
1 In the Book palette, click and drag the 12_Nibbles.indd ﬁ le to the top of the list. 
When a black bar appears just under the Book tab, release the mouse. Notice that the 
pagination has changed to reﬂ ect the page-count difference between this ﬁ le and the ﬁ le 
that was previously in the top position on the list.

LESSON 12
2 As necessary, drag the other ﬁ les into position on the list so that they appear in the 
following order (from top to bottom): 12_Nibbles, 12_Starters, 12_Entrees, 12_Finishes.
Notice that some of the chapters start on odd-numbered pages. You want each 
chapter to start on an even numbered page so that the left page of the ﬁ rst spread is a 
photograph and the right page is the chapter title page. You’ll ﬁ x that next.
3 In the Book palette menu, choose  Book Page Numbering Options.
4 In the dialog box that appears, select Continue on Next Even Page, and then click 
OK. All chapters except the ﬁ rst one begin on even-numbered pages.
5 In the Book palette select the 12_Nibbles ﬁ le to open the Document Page Numbering 
Options dialog box and then choose Document Page Numbering Options from the 
Book palette menu.
Note: Selecting the Document Page Number Options command in the Book palette menu 
will also automatically open the ﬁ le.

6 Select the Start Page Numbering at option and type 2 so that the ﬁ rst page of the 
document appears on page 2. Then click OK.
7 Choose File > Save and then choose File > Close to close the 12_Nibbles document, 
but do not close the Book palette.
Working with a table of contents
A table of contents (TOC) for a book can be a separate InDesign document or it can be 
placed in an existing document that is part of the book. In this project you’ll create both 
kinds: a high-level table of contents for the entire book and more detailed content lists 
for each chapter.
Adding the table of contents ﬁ le
When you create a new ﬁ le just for the book TOC, you should carefully select all the 
same document-setup speciﬁ cations that you use in the other chapters of your book, 
such as the page size, paper orientation, and so forth. For this lesson, that ﬁ le has already 
been created for you but you will add the actual content.
1 In the Book palette, choose Add Document, and then locate and double-click the 
12_TOC.indd ﬁ le in your ID_12 folder.
2 Drag the 12_TOC.indd ﬁ le to the top of the Book palette list.

LESSON 12
3 In the Book palette, double-click the 12_TOC.indd ﬁ le name to open it in the 
document window. At this point, this document is a single, blank page.
4 On the Book palette menu, choose Document Page Numbering Options, or simply 
double-click the page number for the 12_TOC ﬁ le in the Book palette list. 
5 Under Style in the Document Page Numbering Options dialog box, select the 
lowercase roman numerals option, i, ii, iii, iv..., and then click OK.
6 Select File > Save Book from the Book palette menu.
Generating a table of contents for the book
Now you will have InDesign create the listings for you.
1 With the 12_TOC.indd ﬁ le open, choose Layout > Table of Contents.
2 At the top of the dialog box, type Comfort Food as the Title for the table of contents 
and select TOC Book Title for Style. (You may need to scroll in the Style pop-up menu 
to ﬁ nd the TOC Book Title paragraph style.) The words Comfort Food will appear at 
the top of the table-of-contents page, formatted in the TOC Book Title paragraph style.
3 Under the Other Styles list on the right side of the dialog box, select Chapter Title, 
and then click the Add button to place the Chapter Title in the Include Paragraph Styles 
list. Repeat this process to move the Chapter Section style into the Include Paragraph 
Styles list.
With this selection, you designate that all paragraphs in the book that are formatted in 
the Chapter Title paragraph style will be listed in the table of contents.

LESSON 12
Note: In this ﬁ le, custom paragraph styles for the table of contents have been created for 
you. When you create your own documents, you can adjust and format the text and style 
deﬁ nitions as you would for any other text frame. 
Creating a table of contents for an individual chapter
The table of contents in the front of the book is limited to broad categories. Next, you’ll 
create a secondary table of contents for an individual chapter. This subordinate TOC 
will include the next level of interest: the recipe names.
1 Choose File > Open and select the 12_Finishes.indd ﬁ le in your ID_12 folder. 
On page 143, click the Selection tool ( ) in the right side of the page to select the 
placeholder text frame.

2 Choose Layout > Table of Contents, and type Recipes as the Title. Then for Style, 
select Chapter Section as the formatting style for the TOC title.
3 In the Other Styles list, double-click Chapter Section to place it in the Paragraph 
Styles list. 
4 If necessary, click to select Chapter Section from the list of included styles. Then 
under Style: Chapter Section, select the following options:
• For Entry Style, select TOC Chapter Section.
• For Page Number, select No Page Number.
Now all chapter sections, such as “Pastries,” “Cookies,” and so forth will appear in the 
table of contents for the chapter but without page references. The chapter sections were 
identiﬁ ed through the use of the Chapter Section paragraph style.
5 Repeat step 3 but this time double-click Recipe Name, and then select the following 
style options:
• For Entry Style, select TOC Recipe Name.
• For Page Number, select After Entry.

Maintaining consistency across book ﬁ les
In order to create a uniﬁ ed look for your long publication, you can make sure that 
paragraph-style speciﬁ cations and color deﬁ nitions are consistent throughout the book. 
To make this easier to manage, InDesign designates one of the ﬁ les as the style source 
document. By default, the ﬁ rst ﬁ le that you place in the book becomes the style source. 
This is not necessarily the ﬁ le at the top of the list in the Book palette.
You can tell which ﬁ le is the style source by looking in the Book palette. A Style Source 
icon (
) appears in the box to the left of the designated source ﬁ le. This box is empty 
for all other book ﬁ les. 
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

424
Combining Files into Books
LESSON 12
 Reassigning the style source
Designating a different ﬁ le as the style source couldn’t be easier: Here you’ll make the 
TOC ﬁ le the style source ﬁ le with just one click.
• In the Book palette, click the empty box to the left of the 12_TOC ﬁ le.
The style source indicator now appears in the box next to the TOC ﬁ le. 
Synchronizing book documents 
When you synchronize documents, InDesign automatically searches all the style and 
swatch deﬁ nitions in the selected ﬁ les and compares them to the deﬁ nitions in the 
designated style source ﬁ le. When the set of deﬁ nitions in a ﬁ le does not match the set 
in the style source ﬁ le, InDesign adds, removes, and edits the deﬁ nitions in the selected 
ﬁ le so that they match those in the style-source-ﬁ le. After synchronizing, all documents 
in the book have identical sets of styles, ensuring consistency throughout the book. 
Currently, the paragraph deﬁ nitions for several of the paragraph styles are deﬁ ned 
differently in the 12_TOC ﬁ le and the other chapters. You’ll update the deﬁ nitions of 
each style list in each chapter in one simple process. By leaving the 12_Finishes ﬁ le open 
to page 143 (its table of contents) you’ll be able to see the changes in style.
1 Make sure that the style source icon (
) appears next to the 12_TOC ﬁ le in the 
Book palette, indicating that it is the designated style source ﬁ le.
2 Holding down Shift and clicking, select these four ﬁ les in the Book palette: 12_
Nibbles, 12_Starters, 12_Entrees, and 12_Finishes. It is not necessary to select the 
12_TOC ﬁ le.

LESSON 12
Notice the change in the table of contents for the 12_Finishes table of contents page: 
The chapter title now appears ﬂ ush right instead of ﬂ ush left and with 30-point type 
instead of 18-point type. The font for the chapter sections and recipe names has 
changed and the text is also aligned on the right side of the page.
Updating the table of contents after editing
When a heading or subheading requires such changes, all TOC and cross-references 
must also be updated to reﬂ ect the revisions. Fortunately, updating a TOC using 
InDesign is a simple process.
1 If the Desserts chapter is not open, choose Window > 12_Finishes.indd to open it.
2 Using the Type tool (
), select the words Final Thoughts on page 143, and type 
Sweet Finishes to change the chapter title.
3 Choose File > Save.
4 Choose Window > 12_TOC.indd to make that ﬁ le active, and then use the Selection 
tool ( ) to select the table-of-contents text block.
5 Choose Layout > Update Table of Contents.
6 After short delay, a message appears telling you that the table of contents has been 
updated successfully. Click OK.
The table of contents now reﬂ ects the new chapter title for the ﬁ nal chapter in the book.
7 Choose File > Save, and then close the 12_TOC.indd ﬁ le. Leave the “Sweet Finishes” 
ﬁ le (12_Finishes.indd) open for more work in the next topics.

Indexing the book
Creating a good index is an art, as every reader who has tried to ﬁ nd a reference 
to a speciﬁ c topic appreciates. Indexing is also a work that traditionally requires 
extraordinary attention to detail, with precise checking and rechecking of the entries. 
InDesign makes the job easier by facilitating the mechanical aspects of the process. 
To create an index with InDesign, you embed index references right in the text. When 
you add or delete text or entire pages in the document so that the pagination changes, 
the index reference ﬂ ows along with the text. This ensures that the updated index always 
shows the correct page. You can switch your view of these markers on and off as you 
work, but the markers themselves never appear in the printed document.
You can create indexes for individual chapters, but usually you’ll want to publish just 
one index at the end of this book, covering the entire contents.
Creating index references
Some indexing has already been embedded in the project documents for this lesson. 
You’ll add some index markers so you’ll know how to do this yourself.
1 In the Pages palette, double-click the icon for page 146 to center that page—the 
“Persimmon Pudding” recipe—in the document window.
2 Choose Window > Type & Tables > Index to open the Index palette.
3 Select the Type tool (
) in the toolbox, and select the words Persimmon Pudding in 
the recipe title.

“Persimmon Pudding” is added to the Index palette. If necessary, scroll down the list 
to the letter P and click the arrow to see the new page reference. Make sure that the 
Reference button is selected at the top of the Index palette. 
5 Choose New Page Reference on the Index palette menu to add another index 
reference to page 146. 
6 In the dialog box that opens, Under Topic Levels, type puddings in the box labeled 
“1.”

7 In the 2 box under Topic Levels, type persimmon, creating a sublevel entry under 
puddings. Then click Add. The new listing now appears in the large box at the bottom 
of the dialog box, under the letter P. You may need to expand the listings to make this 
visible.
8 Create another new index entry by typing fruit desserts in level 1 and persimmon 
pudding in level 2. You will need to replace the text from the last entry. Click Add again. 
Then click OK (Windows) or Done (Mac OS) to close the New Page Reference dialog 
box.
9 In the Index palette, scroll to review your new page references in the index list. If 
necessary, click the arrows by letters to expand and collapse items in the index list. Click 
Done to close the window.

LESSON 12
Creating index cross-references
Many indexes include cross-references to other listings within the index, especially for 
common synonyms for a term used in the text. In this procedure, you’ll add a cross-
reference directing readers who are looking in the index for entries under “sweets” to 
look under “desserts” instead.
1 In the 12_Finishes.indd ﬁ le, choose Edit > Deselect All.
2 In the Index palette menu, choose New Cross-reference.
3 In Topic Level 1, type sweets.
4 In the Type pop-up menu, select See.
5 Scroll down the list in the bottom of the dialog box and ﬁ nd the page reference to 
“desserts” under the letter “D.” Then drag the “desserts” index entry into the Referenced 
box. 
6 Click Add, and then click OK. 
7 Scroll down the list in the Index palette to see the new cross-reference. Then save 
your work.

Generating the index 
Like the table of contents, you can place the index in a separate InDesign ﬁ le or on pages 
of a ﬁ le in the book that also contains other content. In this project, you’ll put the index 
in a separate ﬁ le.
1 In the Book palette, click an empty area to deselect all ﬁ les, and then in the Book 
palette menu, choose Add Document.
2 Locate the 12_Index.indd ﬁ le in your ID_12 folder and double-click to add the ﬁ le to 
the book. If the 12_Index ﬁ le is not at the bottom of the list in the Book palette, drag it 
to that position now.
3 In the Book palette, double-click the 12_Index ﬁ le name to open the index 
document.
4 If the Index palette is not already open, choose Windows > Type & Tables > Index, 
and then select Generate Index on the Index palette menu.
5 In the Generate Index dialog box, do the following:
• In Title, delete the word Index so that the box is empty. The title Index already appears 
on the page, so you don’t need to include it a second time.
• Select the Include Book Documents check box.
• Deselect Replace Existing Index.
• Click OK.
6 After a short pause, the pointer appears as a loaded text icon. Move it to the 
intersection of the left margin and the horizontal guide located at approximately 12 
picas on the vertical ruler. Hold down Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) and click in 
the ﬁ rst, second and third columns. This will place the index text in one column after 
another until you ﬁ nish ﬁ lling all three columns.

Review questions
1 What are the advantages of the book feature in InDesign CS?
2 Describe the process and the results of removing a chapter ﬁ le from a book.
3 What is the best way to edit an index? Why?
Review answers
1 The book feature makes it easy to coordinate related elements in a long document 
that consists of multiple ﬁ les. By deﬁ ning documents as a book, you can automate what 
would otherwise be time-consuming work, including the following:
• Maintaining the proper sequence of documents.
• Updating the pagination of the entire book after adding or removing pages.
• Generating a book-wide index and table of contents with accurate page references.
• Specifying options for preﬂ ight, packaging, exporting, and printing the entire book.
2 To remove a ﬁ le from a book, ﬁ rst select the ﬁ le in the Book palette. Then, on the 
Book palette menu, choose Remove Document. The result of removing a chapter is 
that the book no longer appears in the list of ﬁ les included in the Book palette. When 
you repaginate the book, update the index, and update the table of contents, all page 
references that involve pages that were below the removed ﬁ le now change. Although the 
ﬁ le is removed from the book, the ﬁ le is not deleted; it is still stored on your hard disk.

LESSON 12
3 Always update index page references in the Index palette. To do this, double-click 
the index reference you want to edit in the Index palette (or select it and choose Page 
Reference Options on the Index palette menu), and then make your changes in the 
dialog box and click OK. When you ﬁ nish making changes to index references, open 
the Index ﬁ le. Then, on the Index palette menu, choose Generate Index and replace the 
existing index for all book documents.
It is important to do your editing in the Index palette instead of simply editing the index 
text directly. The reason is that any edits you make directly in the index text will be lost 
when you regenerate the index. If you then make changes in the book pagination, you 
risk having many incorrect index page references. If you edit in the Index palette, all 
those references are automatically updated when you generate a new index to update the 
existing one.

Printing and Print Preparation
LESSON 13
In this lesson you will learn how to do the following:
• Conﬁ rm that an InDesign ﬁ le and all its elements are ready for printing.
• Assemble all necessary ﬁ les for printing or delivery to a service provider or printer.
• Print documents containing spot colors.
• Select appropriate print settings for fonts and graphics.
• Create a Print preset to automate the printing process.
Getting started
In this lesson you’ll work on a single page product marketing sheet that contains full-
color images and also a spot color. The document will be printed on a color inkjet 
or laser printer for prooﬁ ng and also on a high resolution imaging device, such as a 
computer-to-plate or ﬁ lm imagesetter.
Note: Even if you don’t have a printer on your computer or have access to only a black and 
white printer for prooﬁ ng, you can still follow the steps for this lesson. You will use some 
default print settings that help you better understand the controls and capabilities InDesign 
offers for printing and imaging.
Before you begin, restore the default preferences for Adobe InDesign, using the 
procedure in “Restoring default preferences” on page 2. 
Note: If you have not already copied the resource ﬁ les for this lesson onto your hard disk

You will replace the Blammo logo with a revised version that includes a trademark 
symbol along with the logo. You will address the RGB image in the printing process.
7 Click the Repair All button. Browse to the Links folder inside the ID_13 folder, 
located inside the Lessons folder within the IDCIB folder on your hard disk. Double-
click the blammo_logo_revised.ai
8 Click to select the blammo_logo_revised.ai then click Update. 
Because the ﬁ le name is different, InDesign did not automatically update the image. If 
the selected ﬁ le had not been modiﬁ ed since it was originally placed, InDesign would 
not have required you to update the link.
Note: The Repair All allows you to repair missing or modiﬁ ed links. It does not allow you 
to change the color space deﬁ ned in a placed graphic. You can do this by opening the linked 
image in Photoshop and changing its color space or you can have InDesign convert the 
colors for printing. For more information, see Lesson 7, Importing and Linking Graphics.

9 Click the Colors and Inks option.
Notice that the four subtractive primary colors are listed: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow 
and Black along with three variations of Pantone 2582. The C is for coated, M for 
matte and U for uncoated. Because we will not want all three of these colors to print 
independently, we will want to correct this at the time we print this document.
10  Click the Cancel Button.
Note: You could directly package the ﬁ le as the next step in preparing your ﬁ le for delivery. 
For this lesson we have decided to create the package as a separate step.
Package
You can use the package command to gather a copy of your InDesign document, all 
linked items, including graphics and text. InDesign also copies all fonts needed for 
printing.
1 Choose File > Package.
2 Click Continue in the dialog box that warns of possible problems discovered during 
Preﬂ ight.
Whenever you Package a ﬁ le, InDesign automatically uses the Preﬂ ight command to 
conﬁ rm that all elements are available and that there are no possible problems. Because 
you still have not corrected the RGB image, InDesign alerts you to its presence. You will 
convert this image to CMYK for printing using InDesign later in this lesson.

3 In the Printing Instructions window, enter the ﬁ le name and contact information, 
then click Continue.
Adobe InDesign uses this information to create an instructions text ﬁ le that 
accompanies the InDesign ﬁ le, links and fonts.
4 In the Package Publication dialog box, browse to locate the ID_13 folder and conﬁ rm 
the folder being created for the package is named 13_brochure Folder. InDesign 
automatically names the folder based upon the document name, which you created in 
the Getting Started section of this lesson.
5 Conﬁ rm that the following are selected:
• Copy Fonts.
• Copy Linked Graphics.
• Update Graphic Links In Package.
6 Click the Package button.
7 Read the Font Alert message that informs you about the various licensing restrictions 
that may affect your ability to copy fonts, then click OK.
8 Switch to your operating system and navigate to the 13_brochure Folder in the 
ID_13 folder, located inside the Lessons folder within the IDCIB folder on your hard 
disk.
Notice that Adobe InDesign created a duplicate version of your document and also 
copied all fonts, graphics and other linked ﬁ les necessary for high resolution printing. 
Because you selected the Update Graphics Links In Package, the InDesign ﬁ le now 
links to the graphics located in the package folder. This makes the document easier 
for a printer or service provider to manage, and also makes the package ﬁ le ideal for 
archiving.

LESSON 13
About ﬂ attening transparent artwork
Whenever you print from InDesign or export to a format other than Adobe PDF 1.4 (Acrobat 5.0) or PDF 
1.5 (Acrobat 6.0), InDesign performs a process called ﬂ attening. Flattening cuts apart transparent art to 
represent overlapping areas as discrete pieces that are either vector objects or rasterized areas. As artwork 
becomes more complex (mixing images, vectors, type, spot colors, overprinting, and so on), so does the 
ﬂ attening and its results.
For your convenience, InDesign includes three predeﬁ ned transparency ﬂ attener presets. The settings are 
designed to match the quality and speed of the ﬂ attening with the appropriate resolution for rasterized 
transparent areas, depending on the document’s intended use.
Low Resolution–Use for quick proofs that will be printed on black-and-white desktop printers, and for 
documents that will be published on the Web or exported to SVG.
Medium Resolution–Use for desktop proofs and print-on-demand documents that will be printed on 
PostScript color printers.
High Resolution–Use for ﬁ nal press output, and for high-quality proofs such as separations-based color 
proofs.

5 Click the Output option on the left side of the Print window. Conﬁ rm that Color 
is set to Composite CMYK in the Color drop-down menu. This will take any RGB 
images, such as the placed RGB photograph, and convert them to CMYK at the time it is 
printed. It will not change the original, placed graphic. Spot colors will still be included 
in the output.

Note: You can have InDesign maintain the existing colors used in a job by choosing 
Composite Leave Unchanged in the Color drop-down menu. Additionally, if you are a 
printer or service provider and need to print color separations from Adobe InDesign, choose 
Separations or In-RIP separations based upon the workﬂ ow that you use.
6 Click the Ink Manager button in the lower right corner of the Print Window.
You can use the Ink Manager to convert spot colors to Pantone colors, and to manage 
duplicate spot colors. You will address both of these issues.
7 In the Ink Manager window, click the spot icon ( ) to the left of the Pantone 484 
color swatch. It changes to a CMYK icon ( ). This color will now print as a CMYK 
breakdown as opposed to printing on its own, separate color plate.
8 In the Ink Manager window, click the Pantone 2582 U color swatch and then 
select Pantone 2582 C from the Ink Alias drop-down menu. The Ink Alias tells Adobe 
InDesign to print this color if you are printing color separations.

LESSON 13
By applying an Ink Alias, all objects with this color will now print on the same 
separation as its Alias color. Rather than getting two separate color separations you will 
get one. Repeat this process to select Pantone 2582 M and choose Pantone 2582 C. Now 
all three duplicate Pantone colors will print on the same separation. Click OK.

Printing and Print Preparation
LESSON 13
Determining how graphics print
When you are exporting or printing documents that contain complex graphics (for example, 
high-resolution images, EPS graphics, PDF pages, or transparent effects), it will often be necessary to 
change resolution and rasterization settings in order to obtain the best output results.
Choose from the following options in the Graphics section of the Print dialog box to specify how graphics 
are handled during output.
Send Data–Controls how much image data in placed bitmap images to send to the printer or ﬁ le.
All–sends full-resolution data, which is appropriate for any high-resolution printing, or for printing 
grayscale or color images with high contrast, as in black-and-white text with one spot color. This option 
requires the most disk space.
Optimized Subsampling–Sends just enough image data to print the graphic at the best possible resolution 
for the output device. (A high-resolution printer will use more data than a low-resolution desktop model.) 
Select this option when you’re working with high resolution images but printing proofs to a desktop printer. 
Note: InDesign does not subsample EPS or PDF graphics, even when Optimized Subsampling is selected.
Proxy (72 dpi)–Sends screen-resolution versions of placed bitmap images, thereby reducing printing time.
None–Temporarily removes all graphics when you print and replaces them with graphics frames with 
crossbars, thereby reducing printing time. The graphics frames are the same dimensions as the imported 
graphics, so you can still check sizes and positioning. Suppressing the printing of imported graphics is useful 
when you want to distribute text proofs to editors or proofreaders. Printing without graphics is also helpful 
when you’re trying to isolate the cause of a printing problem.

Setting options for fonts
Printer-resident fonts are fonts stored in a printer’s memory or on a hard drive connected to the printer. 
Type 1 and TrueType fonts can be stored either on the printer or on your computer; bitmap fonts are stored 
only on your computer. InDesign downloads fonts as needed, provided they are installed on your comput-
er’s hard disk.
Choose from the following options in the Graphics section of the Print dialog box to control how fonts are 
downloaded to the printer.
None–Includes a reference to the font in the PostScript ﬁ le, which tells the RIP or a postprocessor where 
the font should be included. This option is appropriate if the fonts reside in the printer. TrueType fonts 
are named according to the PostScript name in the font; however, not all applications can interpret these 
names. To ensure that TrueType fonts are interpreted correctly, use one of the other font downloading 
options.
Complete–Downloads all fonts required for the document at the beginning of the print job. InDesign 
automatically subsets fonts that contain more than the maximum number of glyphs (characters) speciﬁ ed 
in the Preferences dialog box.
Subset–Downloads only the characters (glyphs) used in the document. Glyphs are downloaded once 
per page. This option typically results in faster and smaller PostScript ﬁ les when used with single-page 
documents, or short documents without much text. 
Download PPD Fonts–Downloads all fonts used in the document, even if those fonts reside in the printer. 
Use this option to ensure that InDesign uses the font outlines on your computer for printing common fonts, 
such as Helvetica, Times, and so on. Using this option can resolve problems with font versions, such as 
mismatched character sets between your computer and printer or outline variances in trapping. However, 
unless you commonly use extended character sets, you don’t need to use this option for desktop draft 
printing.
–From Adobe InDesign CS online Help
11 Click the Advanced Tab and set the Transparency Flattener Preset to High 
Resolution from drop-down menu.
You can choose the appropriate transparency ﬂ attener preset for your needs. The 
preset determines the quality of placed artwork or images that include transparency. 
The preset also impacts the quality of objects with transparency applied to them using 
InDesign’s transparency feature, including objects with drop shadows or feathering.

1 Adobe InDesign gathers a copy of the InDesign document along with copies of all 
fonts used in the document and copies of all graphics used in the original document. 
The original items remain undisturbed.
2 You can conﬁ rm that all items necessary for high-resolution printing are available 
by choosing File > Preﬂ ight. This command looks to conﬁ rm that all fonts used in the 
document or inside placed graphics are available. InDesign also looks for linked graphic 
ﬁ les and even linked text ﬁ les to conﬁ rm that they have not been modiﬁ ed since they 
were initially imported.
3 InDesign sends only the image data necessary to an output device as its default

About Adobe PDF and Adobe InDesign CS
While many of your professional design colleagues may be using Adobe InDesign, you may want to share 
your work as an electronic ﬁ le with others who do not have this software. The Adobe Portable Document 
Format (PDF) lets you share documents with users who may not have the same software you used to create 
a document. 
Adobe PDF ﬁ les can be viewed using either Adobe Acrobat software or the free Adobe Reader, of which 500 
Million copies have been distributed. With Adobe PDF ﬁ les you can be assured that your document will 
retain its ﬁ delity to the original design, while allowing you to easily restrict access to viewing, editing or 
printing the ﬁ le through the Adobe PDF integrated security features.
Adobe InDesign lets you create PDF ﬁ les directly through its built-in PDF export feature. If you use Adobe 
Acrobat 6, you can also create PDF ﬁ les using the Adobe PDF printer. The PDF export feature is integrated 
into Adobe InDesign CS and allows for added functionality when creating PDF ﬁ les. The PDF export 
functionality is not dependent upon the installation of Adobe Acrobat. For more information about the 
Adobe PDF ﬁ le format or Adobe Acrobat software visit www.adobe.com/products/acrobat.
Selecting PDF quality
When converting this document to Adobe PDF you will want to determine the 
appropriate quality settings so that it can be efﬁ ciently posted on a web site and also so 
that a separate version of the PDF can be sent to a commercial printer.
Create PDF for emailing or web posting
You will want to create the smallest possible ﬁ le when converting this InDesign 
document to an Adobe PDF ﬁ le. You can then easily send the ﬁ le by email for review, or 
post it to a web site. By keeping the ﬁ le size small you can ensure it will download more 
quickly.

About Tagged PDF Files Exported from Adobe InDesign CS
When you apply structure tags to a document for PDF export, the tags do not control which content is 
exported to PDF, as is the case with XML export. Instead, the structure tags give Acrobat more information 
about the document’s structural contents. By applying Acrobat structure tags to your document before 
exporting to PDF, you can do the following:
• Map InDesign paragraph style names to Acrobat tagged Adobe PDF paragraph styles to create a 
reﬂ owable PDF ﬁ le for viewing on handheld devices and other media.
• Mark and hide printing artifacts, text, and images so that they won’t appear when reﬂ owed in Acrobat. 
For example, if you tag a page item as Artifact, the page item will not be displayed in Acrobat Reﬂ ow view.
• Add alternative text to ﬁ gures so that the text can be read aloud to the visually impaired with screen-
reading software.
• Replace graphic letters, such as ornate drop-caps, with readable letters.
• Provide a title for a set of articles, or group stories and ﬁ gures into articles.
• Order stories and ﬁ gures to establish a reading order.

Setting PDF quality settings using predeﬁ ned PDF presets
A PDF preset is a predeﬁ ned set of PDF options that you can use for creating Adobe PDF ﬁ les. The settings 
in these presets are designed to balance ﬁ le size with quality, depending on how the Adobe PDF ﬁ le is to be 
used. You can also create new presets with custom settings.
Check your InDesign Adobe PDF settings periodically using the Summary area of the Export PDF dialog 
box. InDesign uses the last set of Adobe PDF settings deﬁ ned or selected. The settings do not automatically 
revert to the default settings. You can choose from the following sets of predeﬁ ned Adobe PDF presets:
eBook–Creates Adobe PDF ﬁ les that will be read primarily on-screen—on desktop or laptop computers 
or eBook readers, for example. This set of options balances ﬁ le size against image resolution to produce a 
relatively small, self-contained ﬁ le; compresses all information; converts all colors to RGB, or to Monitor 
RGB (if color management is enabled); and embeds subsets of all fonts used in the ﬁ le (except the Base 
14 fonts). Adobe PDF ﬁ les created with the eBook options are compatible with Acrobat 5.0 and later, and 
Adobe Acrobat eBook Reader 2.2 and later.
Screen–Creates compact Adobe PDF ﬁ les that will be displayed on the World Wide Web or an intranet, 
or that will be distributed through an e-mail system for on-screen viewing. This set of options uses 
compression, downsampling, and a relatively low resolution to create an Adobe PDF ﬁ le that is as small as 
possible; converts all colors to RGB, or to Monitor RGB (if color management is enabled); embeds subsets 
of all fonts used in the ﬁ le (except the Base 14 fonts); maintains compatibility with Acrobat 4.0 and later; 
and optimizes ﬁ les for byte serving.
Print–Creates Adobe PDF ﬁ les that are intended for desktop printers, digital copiers, and CD-ROM 
publishing; you can also send them to clients as publishing proofs. In this set of options, ﬁ le size is still 
important, but it is not the only objective. This set of options uses compression and downsampling to keep 
a ﬁ le size down; leaves colors unchanged; embeds subsets of all fonts used in the ﬁ le; and prints at medium 
resolution to create a reasonably accurate rendition of the original document.
Press–Creates Adobe PDF ﬁ les that will be printed to imagesetters or platesetters as high quality ﬁ nal 
output. In this case, ﬁ le size is not a consideration. The objective is to maintain all of the information in 
an Adobe PDF ﬁ le that a commercial printer or service provider will need to print the document correctly. 
This set of options converts color to CMYK; embeds all fonts used in the ﬁ le; prints at a higher resolution; 
and uses other settings to preserve the maximum amount of information contained in the original 
document.

PDF/X-1a–Converts the document content to a PDF/X-1a–compliant representation. Graphical content is 
converted to a compliant equivalent, if possible, or a warning appears. PDF/X-1a, an ISO (International 
Organization for Standardization) standard for graphic content exchange, requires that all fonts are 
embedded, that appropriate PDF boxes are speciﬁ ed, and that color appears as either CMYK or spot colors. 
PDF ﬁ les that meet PDF/X-1a requirements are targeted to a speciﬁ c output condition (for example, web 
offset printing according to SWOP). PDF/X-1a ﬁ les are intended to be used by applications that support 
PDF/X.
PDF/X-3–Converts the document content to a PDF/X-3 compliant representation. Graphical content is 
converted to a compliant equivalent, if possible, or a warning appears. Like PDF/X-1a, PDF/X-3 is an ISO 
standard for graphic content exchange.
The main difference is that PDF/X-3 supports device-independent color. PDF/X-3 ﬁ les are intended to be 
used by applications that support PDF/X.
Note: For both PDF/X-1a and PDF/X-3, you can modify only those export options that conform to the 
selected standard. For example, for PDF/X-1a, the Color option is unavailable. For both PDF/X standards, 
the Compatibility setting in the General panel is Acrobat 4 (PDF 1.3). Any change to the Compatibility 
setting changes the Standard setting to None.
Acrobat 6 Layered–Creates a PDF ﬁ le in which all InDesign layers, including hidden layers, are saved as 
Acrobat layers. This allows Adobe Acrobat 6.0 users to generate multiple versions of a document from a 
single ﬁ le.

Creating & applying a PDF preset
With Adobe InDesign CS you can quickly create a set of preferences describing the 
settings you use when creating Adobe PDF ﬁ les. These settings, called presets, can then 
be used any time you convert a document to PDF. Adobe InDesign ships with a number 
of default presets, such as the Acrobat 6 Layered preset and the Screen preset, both of 
which you used in the previous steps. In this exercise you will create your own preset 
that will include some more detailed PDF export options.
1 If necessary, open Adobe InDesign CS.
2 Choose File > PDF Export Presets > Deﬁ ne.
3 In the PDF Exports Presets dialog box click once to select the Press preset and then 
click the New button. 
 Selecting an existing preset before clicking New uses the preset as the foundation for the 
new preset.

Notice how the page includes portions of the picture that extend beyond the edge of the 
trim marks. This extra portion of the picture, known as bleed, allows for edge-to-edge 
printing without having any white area show around the edge of the picture. The extra 
area will be cut off at the marks, after it is printed.

Review questions
1 Why would you convert and InDesign document to an Adobe PDF ﬁ le?
2  Are all Adobe PDF ﬁ les created from Adobe InDesign CS the same?
3 What settings should you use when sending an Adobe PDF ﬁ le to a commercial 
printer or service provider?
Review answers
1 Adobe PDF ﬁ les are perfect for sharing your InDesign documents with a variety of 
users. 
• You can share your InDesign documents with your professional colleagues and use 
the commenting and collaboration tools to conduct an electronic review, mark-up or 
approval of the document.
• You can share the document on-line as a PDF posted on an Internet Web site. This 
allows users to see the exact design you had created, because the PDF will include all 
necessary graphics along with the font information.
• You can send your InDesign document as a PDF to a commercial printer or service 
provider for high resolution output.
2 Adobe PDF ﬁ les created from Adobe InDesign vary in both their ﬁ le size, included 
attributes and even their quality. The settings, which are most easily controlled by the 
PDF Presets determine what information is included in the PDF ﬁ le.
3 When exporting an Adobe InDesign document to an Adobe PDF ﬁ le you should 
be certain to ask your printer, publication or service provider about the settings they 
prefer to have you use. In general, the Press quality settings will provide the high quality 
information necessary for commercial printing. However, if the document includes 
bleed information or you need to include any marks, such as crop and registration 
marks, these are not enabled by default and must be turned-on manually before 
exporting the ﬁ le.

15 Ensuring Consistent Color
When your document must meet color 
standards set by clients and designers, 
viewing and editing color consistently 
becomes critical, all the way from 
scanning source images to creating ﬁ nal 
output. A color management system 
reconciles color differences among 
devices so that you can be reasonably 
certain of the colors your system 
ultimately produces.

LESSON 15
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Specify a color management engine.
• Specify default source ICC proﬁ les.
• Assign ICC proﬁ les in InDesign.
• Embed ICC proﬁ les in graphics created in other Adobe programs.
Note: This lesson is designed for users who work with InDesign in environments that also 
involve Adobe Illustrator (version 9 or later) and Adobe Photoshop (version 5.0 or later). 
If you do not have those programs installed on your computer, you will skip some of these 
step-by-step instructions for color-managing graphics from Illustrator and Photoshop. 
Getting started
Color management is important in environments where you must evaluate image color 
reliably in the context of your ﬁ nal output. Color correction is a different issue that 
involves images with tonal or color-balance problems, and is usually handled in the 
original graphics application, such as Photoshop. 
In this lesson, you’ll set up color management for an advertisement for a ﬁ ctitious 
chocolate company called Tifﬂ ins Trufﬂ es. The ad will run in a variety of publications, 
so getting consistent and predictable color is your goal. You will set up the color 
management system using a CMYK press-oriented workﬂ ow, build the document using 
graphics from other Adobe products, and specify ICC proﬁ les for individual graphics to 
ensure color integrity.

Do you need color management?
Use the following guidelines to determine whether or not you need color management:
•  Color accuracy in your working environment isn’t required if you rely completely on prepress service 
providers and commercial printers for all your color work.
•  Color management is recommended for maintaining color accuracy in monitor display, the ability to 
soft-proof colors, and color consistency in large workgroups.
•  Color management is recommended if you reuse color graphics for print and online media, use various 
kinds of devices within a single medium (such as different printing presses), or print to different domestic 
and international presses.
If you decide to use color management, consult with your production partners—such as graphic artists and 
prepress service providers—to ensure that all aspects of your color management workﬂ ow integrate with 
theirs.

Color management: An overview
Devices and graphics have different color gamuts. Although all color gamuts overlap, 
they don’t match exactly, which is why some colors on your monitor can’t be 
reproduced in print or online. The colors that can’t be reproduced in print are called 
out-of-gamut colors because they are outside the spectrum of printable colors. For 
example, you can create a large percentage of colors in the visible spectrum using 
programs such as InDesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator, but you can reproduce only 
a subset of those colors on a desktop printer. The printer has a smaller color space or 
gamut (the range of colors that can be displayed or printed) than the application that 
created the color.
CMYK
RGB
Visible spectrum containing millions of colors (far left) compared with color gamuts of various devices 
and graphics.
To compensate for these differences and to ensure the closest match between on-screen 
colors and printed colors, applications use a color management system (CMS). Using 
a color management engine, the CMS translates colors from the color space of one 
device into a device-independent color space, such as CIE (Commission Internationale 
d’Éclairage) LAB. From the device-independent color space, the CMS ﬁ ts that color 
information to another device’s color space by a process called color mapping, or gamut 
mapping. The CMS makes any adjustments necessary to represent the color consistently 
among devices. 
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

484
Ensuring Consistent Color
LESSON 15
A CMS uses three components to map colors across devices:
• A device-independent (or reference) color space.
• ICC proﬁ les that deﬁ ne the color characteristics of different devices and graphics.
• A color management engine that translates colors from one device’s color space to 
another.

A. Scanners and software applications create color documents. B. ICC source proﬁ les describe document

device-independent color space through supporting applications. D. The color management engine maps 
document colors from the device-independent color space to output-device color spaces using destination 
proﬁ les.
About the device-independent color space
To successfully compare gamuts and make adjustments, a color management system 
must use a reference color space—an objective way of deﬁ ning color. Most CMSs 
use the CIE (Commission Internationale d’Éclairage) LAB color model, which exists 
independently of any device and is big enough to reproduce any color visible to the 
human eye. For this reason, CIE LAB is considered device-independent.
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

ADOBE INDESIGN CS 485

About ICC proﬁ les 
An ICC proﬁ le describes how a particular device or standard reproduces color using 
a cross-platform standard deﬁ ned by the International Color Consortium (ICC). ICC 
proﬁ les ensure that images appear correctly in any ICC-compliant applications and on 
color devices. This is accomplished by embedding the proﬁ le information in the original 
ﬁ le or assigning the proﬁ le in your application. 
At a minimum, you must have one source proﬁ le for the device (such as a scanner or 
digital camera) or standard (such as SWOP or Adobe RGB) used to create the color, 
and one destination proﬁ le for the device (such as monitor or contract prooﬁ ng) or 
standard (SWOP or TOYO, for example) that you will use to reproduce the color. 
About color management engines
Sometimes called the color matching module (CMM), the color management engine 
interprets ICC proﬁ les. Acting as a translator, the color management engine converts the 
out-of-gamut colors from the source device to the range of colors that can be produced 
by the destination device. The color management engine may be included with the CMS 
or may be a separate part of the operating system.
Translating to a gamut—particularly a smaller gamut—usually involves a compromise, 
so multiple translation methods are available. For example, a color-translation method 
that preserves correct relationships among colors in a photograph will usually alter the 
colors in a logo. Color Management engines provide a choice of translation methods, 
known as rendering intents, so that you can apply a method appropriate to the intended 
use of a color graphic. Examples of common rendering intents include Perceptual 
(Images) for preserving color relationships the way the eye does, Saturation (Graphics) 
for preserving vivid colors at the expense of color accuracy, and Relative and  Absolute 
Colorimetric for preserving color accuracy at the expense of color relationships.

LESSON 15
Components of a CMYK press-oriented workﬂ ow
In a CMYK workﬂ ow, you work with CMYK images prepared for a speciﬁ c printing 
press or prooﬁ ng device, or legacy (archived) CMYK images. You generate a source 
proﬁ le based on your press or contract-prooﬁ ng standard and embed it into the CMYK 
images or assign the proﬁ le in InDesign. The proﬁ le enables consistent CMYK printing 
at other color-managed sites, such as when printing a widely distributed magazine on 
presses in many different cities. Because you use color management, the reliability and 
consistency of color display improves across all your workstations. For ﬁ nal printed 
output, you select a printer proﬁ le in the Print dialog box that describes your contract-
prooﬁ ng standard or your printing press. 
Setting up color management in InDesign
No mechanical device can produce the full range of color visible to the human eye: no 
monitor, ﬁ lm, printer, copier, or printing press. Each device has a speciﬁ c capability, so 
that different devices make different kinds of compromises in reproducing color images. 
The unique color-rendering abilities of a speciﬁ c output device are known collectively 
as its gamut or color space.
InDesign and other graphics applications, such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, 
and others, use color numbers to describe the color of each pixel in an image. The color 
numbers correspond to the color model, such as the familiar RGB values for red, green, 
and blue or the CMYK values for cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.
Color management is simply the designation of a consistent way of translating the 
color numbers for each pixel from the source (the document or image stored on your 
computer) to the output device (such as your monitor, color printer, or high-resolution 
printing press, each with its own speciﬁ c gamut).
In an ICC workﬂ ow—that is, one that follows the conventions of the International 
Color Consortium (ICC)—you specify a color management engine and a color proﬁ le. 
The color management engine is the software feature or module that does the work 
of reading and translating colors between different color spaces. A color proﬁ le is the 
description of how the color numbers map to the color space (capabilities) of output 
devices.

Specifying the Adobe ACE engine
Different companies have developed various ways to manage color. To provide you with 
a choice, you use a color management system to designate a color management engine 
that represents the approach you want to use. Remember that the color management 
engine translates colors from the source. InDesign CS now offers the Adobe ACE engine 
as one of your choices. This engine uses the same architecture as in Photoshop and 
Illustrator, so that your color management choices are integrated across these Adobe 
graphics applications. 
1 Choose Edit > Color Settings.
The color management engine and other settings you choose in the Color Settings 
dialog box are saved with InDesign and apply to all InDesign documents you work on in 
the future. 
2 Select the Enable Color Management check box.
By default, color management for the document is turned off, because successful color 
management requires that you set it up properly before depending on it.

To complete the application-wide color management setup, you’ll choose proﬁ les for the 
devices you will use to reproduce the color, including your  monitor, composite prooﬁ ng 
device, and ﬁ nal separations standard. InDesign refers to these preset proﬁ les as working 
spaces. These working spaces are also available in other Adobe graphics applications, 
including Illustrator and Photoshop. Once you designate the same working space in 
all three applications, then you’ve automatically set up consistent color for illustration, 
digital images, and document layouts.

LESSON 15
Several colors change in the ad, but most noticeably the browns; they appear to have 
more detail. It’s important to note that although the images look better than they did 
when you opened the document, the images themselves have not been altered—only the 
display of the images has changed. Speciﬁ cally, what you see now represents the color 
characteristics of the following devices:
• The program or scanner that saved the image, using the source proﬁ le embedded in 
the image.
• The ﬁ nal output device for the document, using the destination proﬁ le you set up 
earlier in the lesson.
Note: If you turn on color management after you open a document, color management 
settings apply only to the current document. For color management to become the InDesign 
default, turn it on when no documents are open.
It’s easy to see that the success of color management ultimately depends on the accuracy 
of your proﬁ les.

Assigning source proﬁ les
Source proﬁ les describe the color space InDesign uses when you create colors in 
InDesign and apply them to objects, or when you import an RGB, CMYK, or LAB color 
graphic that wasn’t saved with an embedded proﬁ le. When you import an image with 
embedded proﬁ les, InDesign will color-manage the image using the embedded proﬁ les 
rather than the proﬁ les you choose here, unless you override the embedded proﬁ les for 
an individual image.

1 In the lower area of the Assign Proﬁ les dialog box, leave Relative Colorimetric 
selected for the Solid Color Intent option. This option preserves individual colors at 
the expense of color relationships, so it’s appropriate for business logos and other such 
graphics.
2 Make sure that Use Color Settings Intent is selected in both the Default Image

Using full-resolution display with color management
When you use image-display resolutions lower than High Quality so that screen redraw 
is faster, image-color display is also made faster by displaying their colors less precisely. 
Image colors display most precisely when you view images at the fullest resolution (in 
addition to turning on color management).
1 Choose Edit > Preferences > Display Performance. 
2 For Default View Settings, select High Quality on the pop-up menu, and then click 
OK.
It’s especially important to view color-managed images at full resolution when you 
work with duotones.
When color management is on, image display is set to full resolution, and you use 
accurate proﬁ les that are applied properly, you see the best possible color representation 
that your monitor is capable of showing. 
Note: To save disk space, the sample ﬁ les for this lesson are 150 pixels per inch (ppi), so the 
colors are not as precise as they would be using a higher resolution.
Color-managing imported graphics in InDesign
When you import a graphic, you can control its color management in your document. 
If you know that an imported graphic contains an accurate embedded proﬁ le with an 
appropriate rendering intent, you just import it and continue working. InDesign will 
read and apply the embedded proﬁ le to the graphic, integrating it into the  CMS for 
the document. If an imported  bitmap image does not include an embedded proﬁ le, 
InDesign applies the default source proﬁ le (CMYK, RGB, or LAB) to the image. 
InDesign also applies a default source proﬁ le to InDesign-drawn objects. You can assign 
a different proﬁ le within InDesign—using Edit > Assign Proﬁ les to open the Assign 
Proﬁ les dialog box—or open the graphic in the original application and embed the 
proﬁ le there. 
Peachpit Press/Scott Design

494
Ensuring Consistent Color
LESSON 15
The ad already includes two images that were saved without embedded proﬁ les. You’ll 
integrate those images into the document CMS using two different methods: assigning 
a proﬁ le within InDesign and opening the original image so that you can embed the 
proﬁ le. Later in the lesson, you’ll import two additional graphics and practice two 
methods of assigning a proﬁ le before you place them in the ad. 
Assigning a proﬁ le after importing an image
When you import images that were saved without embedded proﬁ les into InDesign, 
InDesign applies its default source proﬁ le to the image. If an imported image was 
not created in the default color space, you should assign the proﬁ le that describes the 
image’s original color space.
InDesign applies its default source proﬁ le to any bitmap image without embedded 
proﬁ les.
You’ll work with an image that was imported into InDesign before you turned on color 
management. First, you’ll conﬁ rm the default proﬁ le InDesign is using to color-manage 
the image. Then, within InDesign, you’ll assign a new proﬁ le because the image’s 
original color space is different from the default color space.

colors deepen noticeably.
InDesign will color-manage the image using the newly assigned proﬁ le.
Embedding a proﬁ le in a Photoshop TIFF image
As a general rule, you should embed ICC proﬁ les in ﬁ les before importing the ﬁ les 
into another document that uses color management. That way, images with embedded 
proﬁ les will more likely appear as intended in InDesign or other color-managed 
programs without requiring any additional work.
In this section, you’ll work with a previously imported, color bitmap image that does 
not contain an embedded proﬁ le.

Note: If you don’t have Photoshop installed on your system, you can use the Photoshop ﬁ les 
provided in the lesson folder. The steps indicate when to do so.
Setting up color management in  Photoshop
First, you’ll deﬁ ne the working color spaces (used for viewing and editing) for the 
image’s RGB and CMYK color modes.
1 Start Photoshop, and choose Edit > Color Settings (Mac OS: Photoshop > Color 
Settings).
2 For Settings, select U.S. Prepress Defaults on the pop-up menu.

3 For the CMYK option under Working Spaces, select U.S. Web Coated (SWOP) v2, if 
it is not already selected, so that the embedded proﬁ le matches the default separations 
proﬁ le you speciﬁ ed in InDesign CS.
4 Leave the other settings as they are, and click OK.
Embedding the proﬁ le
Now that you have speciﬁ ed the working color spaces for the Photoshop image, you’ll 
embed the speciﬁ ed proﬁ le.

Updating the image within InDesign
Now that you’ve embedded the ICC proﬁ le in the Photoshop ﬁ le, you can update the 
image in InDesign. InDesign will color-manage the image using the embedded proﬁ le. 
1 In InDesign, select the large chocolate image.
2 Do one of the following:
• If you followed Photoshop instructions in the previous sections, click the Relink 
button (
) at the bottom of the Links palette. Click Browse and locate the 15_dprof.tif 
ﬁ le you just saved in the ID_15 folder. Double-click the ﬁ le.
Note: When relinking to a ﬁ le using a different ﬁ le format, you need to select All Files under 
the Files of Type drop down menu when browsing for the ﬁ le on the Windows operating 
system.
• If you don’t have Photoshop or skipped the previous two sections, click the Relink 
button (
) at the bottom of the Links palette. Click Browse and locate 15_dprof.psd in 
the Final folder. Double-click the ﬁ le.
Note: You may need to select All Files for Files of Type.
3 To conﬁ rm that the embedded proﬁ le is being used, open the Links palette 
menu (choose Window > Links if the Links palette is not visible), and choose Link 
Information. In the Link Information dialog box, make sure that the Proﬁ le says U.S. 
Web Coated (SWOP) v2, and then click Done.
 A quick way to check proﬁ les for all graphics in a document is by using the Preﬂ ight 
feature to view document components.
Now that you have ﬁ xed existing graphics in the document, you will ﬁ nish the ad by 
importing two additional graphics and setting options as you import.

LESSON 15
Assigning a proﬁ le while importing a graphic
If you know that a color-managed image uses a color space that is different from 
the color space described by the default source proﬁ le, you can assign a proﬁ le to it 
while you’re importing the image into InDesign. In this section, you’ll import a legacy 
(archived) CMYK image scanned without a proﬁ le, and assign a proﬁ le before you place 
it in the ad.
You can assign a proﬁ le while you import an image.
1 In InDesign, choose View > Show Frame Edges to show the outline of the frame for 
the graphic you’re about to place—and the outlines for all the graphics frames in the ad. 
2 If necessary, adjust your view so that you can easily see the frames in the lower right 
area of the spread. Using the Selection tool ( ), select the topmost of these three frames.

3 Choose File > Place to open the Place dialog box, and do the following:
• Open ID_15 folder in the IDCIB folder and select the 15_e.psd ﬁ le.
• Select the Show Import Options check box, so that you’ll have an opportunity to 
specify a proﬁ le. 
• Click Open.
4 In the Image Import Options dialog box, select the color tab on the right side of the 
dialog box.
5 Make sure that Enable Color Management is selected. Then select the following 
options:
• For Proﬁ le, select U.S. Sheetfed Coated v2 to match the image’s original color space.
Note: If you selected a different proﬁ le in “Assigning a proﬁ le after importing an image,” 
select the same proﬁ le here. 
• For Rendering Intent, select Perceptual (Images).
• Click OK.
The image appears in the selected frame. InDesign will color-manage the image using 
the proﬁ le you assigned.
Embedding a proﬁ le in an Illustrator graphic
In this lesson, you’ll set up Illustrator (version 9 or later) so that its color-management 
settings match InDesign. You’ll then save a color-managed Illustrator graphic and place 
it in an InDesign document.

LESSON 15
InDesign can color-manage vector graphics created in Illustrator 9 or later when you 
save them in formats that embed proﬁ les, such as PDF or TIFF. In this lesson, you’ll save 
a ﬁ le as PDF and then place the graphic in InDesign.
Note: If you don’t have Illustrator 9 or later installed on your system, you can read the 
information in the next two sections, and then skip to step 2 in “Placing a color-managed 
Illustrator ﬁ le into InDesign” on page 504 to use the Illustrator ﬁ le provided in the ID_15 
folder.
InDesign color-manages a PDF ﬁ le using the proﬁ les saved 
with the PDF version of the ﬁ le.
Setting up color management in  Illustrator
Now you’ll set up color management in Illustrator so that it matches color management 
settings in InDesign. This ensures that the colors are consistent from Illustrator to 
InDesign on-screen and in print. Setting up color management in Illustrator also 
enables you to embed an ICC proﬁ le in an exported version of the Illustrator ﬁ le. When 
you place the exported Illustrator ﬁ le in the InDesign layout, InDesign color-manages 
the logo using the embedded proﬁ le.
1 Start Adobe Illustrator, and choose Edit > Color Settings.
2 In the Color Settings dialog box, select U.S. Prepress Defaults, and then select the 
Advanced Mode check box to expand the dialog box so that you see more options.
3 Under Working Spaces, for RGB select sRGB IEC61966-2.1. Leave CMYK set for U.S. 
Web Coated (SWOP) v2.
4 Review the conversion options and make sure that the Adobe (ACE) engine, and 
Relative Colorimetric intent are selected. 
5 Click OK.
You have ﬁ nished setting up color management in Illustrator.

Embedding a proﬁ le in a graphic from Illustrator
You can embed an ICC proﬁ le in ﬁ les that you create in Illustrator and export in PDF or 
bitmap (.bmp) formats. Then, InDesign can use the proﬁ le to color-manage the graphic. 
In this task, you’ll export a ﬁ le to PDF format, and then place the graphic in an InDesign 
document.
1 In Illustrator, choose File > Open. Locate and double-click the 15_f.ai ﬁ le in the 
ID_15 folder inside the IDCIB folder on your hard disk.
2 When the Missing Proﬁ le dialog box opens, select Assign current working space: U.S. 
Web Coated (SWOP) v2, and click OK.
3 Choose File > Save As.
4 Name the ﬁ le 15_Logo.pdf, and choose Adobe PDF from the Save as Type 
(Windows) or Format (Mac OS) menu. Make sure that the ID_15 folder is targeted, 
and then click Save to close the Save As dialog box and the Adobe PDF Format Options 
dialog box will appear next.

5 Save the ﬁ le.
In this lesson, you have learned how to set up color management across three Adobe 
applications—an admirable achievement. You have learned several methods for 
incorporating graphics so that they can be color-managed when placed in InDesign 
documents. Because you described your color environment to the other Adobe 
applications whose graphics you imported, you can expect predictable, consistent color 
for those graphics across the applications.

At this time, you could either hand off the native InDesign ﬁ le with all the linked ﬁ les, 
or export the InDesign ﬁ le as PDF, embedding the ICC proﬁ les you assigned. If you 
create a PDF ﬁ le of the document, the colors in the ad will look the same across all 
publications that use the ad, regardless of the color-management settings used by the 
publication’s layout application. Other users can preview and proof your color-managed 
ﬁ les more accurately and repurpose them for different print conditions when that is 
useful, or when it is a requirement of your project.

Review questions
1 What does the color management engine do?
2 What do source proﬁ les describe?
3 What are three ways to attach an ICC proﬁ le to a graphic so that InDesign can 
color-manage the graphic?
4 Why would you embed an ICC proﬁ le in a graphic?
5 Which ﬁ le formats embed ICC proﬁ les for use in both Windows and Mac OS?
Review answers
1 The color management engine translates colors from the color space of one device to 
another device’s color space by a process called color mapping.
2 Source proﬁ les selected in the Assign Proﬁ les dialog box describe the color space 
InDesign assigns to objects you create using the drawing tools, or when you import an 
RGB, CMYK, or LAB color graphic that wasn’t saved with an embedded proﬁ le.
3 You can embed the proﬁ le in the original ﬁ le, assign a proﬁ le within InDesign, or use 
the default proﬁ le you speciﬁ ed when you set up color management in InDesign.
4 Embedding an ICC proﬁ le ensures that the graphic displays correctly in any 
application that uses ICC-compliant color management. The application that uses the 
graphic honors the embedded proﬁ le rather than applying a default one. 
5 A growing number of formats can contain an embedded ICC proﬁ le, but the most 
widely supported formats to use with embedded ICC proﬁ les at this time are bitmap 
image formats such as Photoshop (PSD), TIFF, and JPEG.
