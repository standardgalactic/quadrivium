Linux Editors 
 
What is a text editor?  
o 
A text editor is a program which enables you to create and manipulate character 
data (text) in a computer file.  
o 
A text editor is not a word processor although some text editors do include word 
processing facilities.  
o 
Text editors often require "memorizing" commands in order to perform editing 
tasks. The more you use them, the easier it becomes. There is a "learning curve" 
in most cases though.  
 
There are several standard text editors available on most LINUX systems:  
o 
ed - standard line editor  
o 
ex - extended line editor  
o 
vi - a visual editor; full screen; uses ed/ex line-mode commands for global file 
editing  
o 
sed - stream editor for batch processing of files  
 
In addition to these, other local "favorites" may be available:  
o 
emacs - a full screen editor and much more  
o 
pico - an easy "beginner's" editor  
o 
lots of others  
 
The Standard Display Editor - vi  
 
vi supplies commands for:  
o 
inserting and deleting text  
o 
replacing text  
o 
moving around the file  
o 
finding and substituting strings  
o 
cutting and pasting text  
o 
reading and writing to other files  
 
vi uses a "buffer"  
o 
While using vi to edit an existing file, you are actually working on a copy of the 
file that is held in a temporary buffer in your computer's memory.  
o 
If you invoked vi with a new filename, (or no file name) the contents of the file 
only exist in this buffer.  
o 
Saving a file writes the contents of this buffer to a disk file, replacing its contents. 
You can write the buffer to a new file or to some other file.  
o 
You can also decide not to write the contents of the buffer, and leave your 
original file unchanged.  
 
vi operates in two different "modes":  
o 
Command mode  

 
vi starts up in this mode  
 
Whatever you type is interpreted as a command - not text to be inserted 
into the file.  
 
The mode you need to be in if you want to "move around" the file.  
o 
Insert mode  
 
This is the mode you use to type (insert) text.  
 
There are several commands that you can use to enter this mode.  
 
Once in this mode, whatever you type is interpreted as text to be included 
in the file. You cannot "move around" the file in this mode.  
 
Must press the ESC (escape) key to exit this mode and return to command 
mode.
