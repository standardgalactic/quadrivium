Preface
PREFACE
This book is designed to help students learn how to analyze and interpret research data with
intermediate statistics. It is intended to be a supplemental text in an intermediate statistics course
in the behavioral sciences or education and it can be used in conjunction with any mainstream
text. We have found that the book makes SPSS for windows easy to use so that it is not necessary
to have a formal, instructional computer lab; you should be able to learn how to use SPSS on your
own with this book. Access to the SPSS program and some familiarity with Windows is all that is
required. Although SPSS for Windows is quite easy to use, there is such a wide variety of
options and statistics that knowing which ones to use and how to interpret the printouts can be
difficult, so this book is intended to help with these challenges.
SPSS 12 and Earlier Versions
We use SPSS 12 for Windows in this book, but, except for enhanced tables and graphics, there
are only minor differences from versions 10 and 11. In fact, as far as the procedures
demonstrated, in this book there are only a few major differences between versions 7 and 12. We
also expect future Windows versions to be similar. You should not have much difficulty if you
have access to SPSS versions 7 through 9. Our students have used this book, or earlier editions of
it, with all of these versions of SPSS; both the procedures and outputs are quite similar.
Goals of This Book
This book demonstrates how to produce a variety of statistics that are usually included in
intermediate statistics courses, plus some (e.g., reliability measures) that are useful for doing
research. Our goal is to describe the use and interpretation of these statistics as much as possible
in nontechnical, jargon-free language.
Helping you learn how to choose the appropriate statistics, interpret the outputs, and
develop skills in writing about the meaning of the results are the main goals of this book.
Thus, we have included material on:
1) How the appropriate choice of a statistic is based on the design of the research.
2) How to use SPSS to answer research questions.
3) How to interpret SPSS outputs.
4) How to write about the outputs hi the Results section of a paper.
This information will help you develop skills that cover a range of steps in the research process:
design, data collection, data entry, data analysis, interpretation of outputs, and writing results. The
modified high school and beyond data set (HSB) used in this book is similar to one you might
have for a thesis, dissertation, or research project. Therefore, we think it can serve as a model for
your analysis. The compact disk (CD) packaged with the book contains the HSB data file and
several other data sets used for the extra problems at the end of each chapter. However, you will
need to have access to or purchase the SPSS program. Partially to make the text more
readable, we have chosen not to cite many references in the text; however, we have provided a
short bibliography of some of the books and articles that we have found useful. We assume that
most students will use this book in conjunction with a class that has a textbook; it will help you to
read more about each statistic before doing the assignments. Our "For Further Reading" list
should also help.
Our companion book, Morgan, Leech, Gloeckner, and Barrett (2004), SPSS for Introductory
Statistics: Use and Interpretation, also published by Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, is on the "For
Further Reading" list at the end of this book. We think that you will find it useful if you need to
vn

Preface
review how to do introductory statistics including the ones such as t tests, chi-square, and
correlation.
Special Features
Several user friendly features of this book include:
1. The key SPSS windows that you see when performing the statistical analyses. This has been
helpful to "visual learners."
2. The complete outputs for the analyses that we have done so you can see what you will get,
after some editing in SPSS to make the outputs fit better on the pages.
3. Callout boxes on the outputs that point out parts of the output to focus on and indicate what
they mean.
4. For each output, a boxed interpretation section that will help you understand the output.
5. Specially developed flow charts and tables to help you select an appropriate inferential
statistic and tell you how to interpret statistical significance and effect sizes (in Chapter 3).
This chapter also provides an extended example of how to identify and write a research
problem, several research questions, and a results paragraph for a t test and correlation.
6. For the statistics in chapters 4-10, an example of how to write about the output and make a
table for a thesis, dissertation or research paper.
7. Interpretation questions that stimulate you to think about the information in the chapter and
outputs.
8. Several extra SPSS problems at the end of each chapter for you to run with SPSS and
discuss.
9. A Quick Reference Guide to SPSS (Appendix A) which provides information about many
SPSS commands not discussed in the chapters.
10. Information (in Appendix B) on how to get started with SPSS.
11. A step by step guide to (Appendix C) making APA tables with MsWord.
12. Answers to the odd numbered interpretation questions (Appendix D).
13. Several data sets on a CD. These realistic data sets are packaged with the book to provide
you with data to be used to solve the chapter problems and the extra problems at the end of
each chapter.
Overview of the Chapters
Our approach in this book is to present how to use and interpret SPSS in the context of
proceeding as if the HSB data were the actual data from your research project. However, before
starting the SPSS assignments, we have three introductory chapters. The first chapter is an
introduction and review of research design and how it would apply to analyzing the HSB data. In
addition chapter includes a review of measurement and descriptive statistics. Chapter 2 discusses
rules for coding data, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and assumptions. Much of what is done in
this chapter involves preliminary analyses to get ready to answer the research questions that you
might state in a report.
Chapter 3 provides a brief overview of research designs (between groups and within subjects).
This chapter provides flowcharts and tables useful for selecting an appropriate statistic. Also
included is an overview of how to interpret and write about the results of a basic inferential
statistic. This section includes not only testing for statistical significance but also a discussion of
effect size measures and guidelines for interpreting them.
Chapters 4-10 are designed to answer several research questions. Solving the problems in these
chapters should give you a good idea of some of the intermediate statistics that can be computed
with SPSS. Hopefully, seeing how the research questions and design lead naturally to the choice
Vlll

Preface
of statistics will become apparent after using this book. In addition, it is our hope that interpreting
what you get back from the computer will become more clear after doing these assignments,
studying the outputs, answering the interpretation questions, and doing the extra SPSS problems.
Our Approach to Research Questions, Measurement, and Selection of Statistics
In Chapters 1 and 3, our approach is somewhat nontraditional because we have found that
students have a great deal of difficulty with some aspects of research and statistics but not others.
Most can learn formulas and "crunch" the numbers quite easily and accurately with a calculator
or with a computer. However, many have trouble knowing what statistics to use and how to
interpret the results. They do not seem to have a "big picture" or see how research design and
measurement influence data analysis. Part of the problem is inconsistent terminology. For these
reasons, we have tried to present a semantically consistent and coherent picture of how research
design leads to three basic kinds of research questions (difference, associational, and descriptive)
which, in turn, lead to three kinds or groups of statistics with the same names. We realize that
these and other attempts to develop and utilize a consistent framework are both nontraditional and
somewhat of an oversimplification. However, we think the framework and consistency pay off in
terms of student understanding and ability to actually use statistics to answer their research
questions. Instructors who are not persuaded that this framework is useful can skip Chapters 1
and 3 and still have a book that helps their students use and interpret SPSS.
Major Changes and Additions to This Edition
The following changes and additions are based on our experiences using the book with students,
feedback from reviewers and other users, and the revisions in policy and best practice specified
by the APA Task Force on Statistical Inference (1999) and the 5th Edition of the APA Publication
Manual (2001).
1. Effect size. We discuss effect size in addition to statistical significance in the interpretation
sections to be consistent with the requirements of the revised APA manual. Because SPSS
does not provide effect sizes for all the demonstrated statistics, we often show how to
estimate or compute them by hand.
2. Writing about outputs. We include examples of how to write about and make APA type
tables from the information in SPSS outputs. We have found the step from interpretation to
writing quite difficult for students so we now put more emphasis on writing.
3. Assumptions. When each statistic is introduced, we have a brief section about its assumptions
and when it is appropriate to select that statistic for the problem or question at hand.
4. Testing assumptions. We have expanded emphasis on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and
how to test assumptions.
5. Quick Reference Guide for SPSS procedures. We have condensed several of the appendixes
of the first edition into the alphabetically organized Appendix A, which is somewhat like a
glossary. It includes how to do basic statistics that are not included in this text, and
procedures like print and save, which are tasks you will use several times and/or may already
know. It also includes brief directions of how to do things like import a file from Excel or
export to PowerPoint, do split files, and make 3-D figures.
6. Extra SPSS problems. We have developed additional extra problems, to give you more
practice in running and interpreting SPSS.
7. Reliability assessment. We include a chapter on ways of assessing reliability including
Cronbach's alpha, Cohen's kappa, and correlation. More emphasis on reliability and testing
assumptions is consistent with our strategy of presenting SPSS procedures that students
would use in an actual research project.
8. Principal Components Analysis and Exploratory Factor Analysis. We have added a section
on exploratory factor analysis to increase students' choices when using these types of
analyses.
IX

Preface
9. Interpretation questions. We have added more interpretation questions to each chapter
because we have found them useful for student understanding. We include the answers to the
odd numbered questions in Appendix C for self-study.
Bullets, Arrows, Bold and Italics
To help you do the problems with SPSS, we have developed some conventions. We use bullets to
indicate actions in SPSS Windows that you will take. For example:
Highlight gender and math achievement.
Click on the arrow to move the variables into the right hand box.
Click on Options to get Fig 2.16.
Check Mean, Std Deviation, Minimum, and Maximum.
Click on Continue.
Note that the words in italics are variable names and words in bold are words that you will see in
the SPSS Windows and utilize to produce the desired output. In the text they are spelled and
capitalized as you see them in the Windows. Bold is also used to identify key terms when they are
introduced, defined, or important to understanding.
The words you will see in the pull down menus are given in bold with arrows between them. For
example:
â¢ 
Select Analyze => Descriptive Statistics => Frequencies
(This means pull down the Analyze menu, then slide your cursor down to Descriptive Statistics
and over to Frequencies and click.)
Occasionally, we have used underlines to emphasize critical points or commands.
Acknowledgements
This SPSS book is consistent with and could be used as a supplement for Gliner and Morgan,
(2000) Research Methods in Applied Settings: An Integrated Approach to Design and Analysis,
also published by Erlbaum. In fact, some sections of chapters 1 and 3 have been only slightly
modified from that text. For this we thank Jeff Gliner, the first author of that book. Although
Orlando Griego is not an author on this revision of our SPSS book, it still shows the imprint of
his student friendly writing style.
We would like to acknowledge the assistance of the many students in our education and human
development classes who have used earlier versions of this book and provided helpful
suggestions for improvement. We could not have completed the task or made it look so good
without our technology consultant, Don Quick, our word processors, Linda White and Catherine
Lamana, and several capable work study students including Rae Russell, Katie Jones, Erica
Snyder, and Jennifer Musser. Jikyeong Kang, Bill Sears, LaVon Blaesi, Mei-Huei Tsay and
Sheridan Green assisted with classes and the development of materials for the DOS and earlier
Windows versions of the assignments. Laura Jensen, Lisa Vogel, Don Quick, James Lyall, Joan
Anderson, and Yasmine Andrews helped with writing or editing parts of the manuscript or earlier
editions. Jeff Gliner, Jerry Vaske, Jim zumBrunnen, Laura Goodwin, David MacPhee, Gene
Gloeckner, James O. Benedict, Barry Cohen, John Ruscio, Tim Urdan, and Steve Knotek

CHAPTER 1
Introduction
This chapter will review important information about measurement and descriptive statistics and provide
an overview of the expanded high school and beyond (HSB) data set, which will be used in this chapter
and throughout the book to demonstrate the use and interpretation of the several statistics that are
presented. First, we provide a brief review of some key terms, as we will use them in this book.
Variables
Variables are key elements in research. A variable is defined as a characteristic of the participants or
situation for a given study that has different values in that study. A variable must be able to vary or have
different values or levels.1 For example, gender is a variable because it has two levels, female or male.
Age is a variable that has a large number of values. Type of treatment/intervention (or type of curriculum)
is a variable if there is more than one treatment or a treatment and a control group. Number of days to
learn something or to recover from an ailment are common measures of the effect of a treatment and,
thus, are also variables. Similarly, amount of mathematics knowledge is a variable because it can vary
from none to a lot. If a concept has only one value in a particular study, it is not a variable; it is a
constant. Thus, ethnic group is not a variable if all participants are European American. Gender is not a
variable if all participants in a study are female.
In quantitative research, variables are defined operationally and are commonly divided into
independent variables (active or attribute), dependent variables, and extraneous variables. Each of
these topics will be dealt with briefly in the following sections.
Operational definitions of variables. An operational definition describes or defines a variable in terms of
the operations or techniques used to make it happen or measure it. When quantitative researchers
describe the variables in their study, they specify what they mean by demonstrating how they measured
the variable. Demographic variables like age, gender, or ethnic group are usually measured simply by
asking the participant to choose the appropriate category from a list. Types of treatment (or curriculum)
are usually operationally defined much more extensively by describing what was done during the
treatment or new curriculum. Likewise, abstract concepts like mathematics knowledge, self-concept, or
mathematics anxiety need to be defined operationally by spelling out in some detail how they were
measured in a particular study. To do this, the investigator may provide sample questions, append the
actual instrument, or provide a reference where more information can be found.
Independent Variables
In this book, we will refer to two types of independent variables: active and attribute. It is important to
distinguish between these types when we discuss the results of a study.
1 To help you, we have identified the SPSS variable names, labels, and values using italics (e.g., gender and male).
Sometimes italics are also used to emphasize a word. We have put in bold the terms used in the SPSS windows and
outputs (e.g., SPSS Data Editor) and other key terms when they are introduced, defined, or are important to
understanding. Underlines are used to emphasize critical points. Bullets precede instructions about SPSS actions
(e.g., click, highlight).

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
Active or manipulated independent variables. An active independent variable is a variable, such as a
workshop, new curriculum, or other intervention, one level of which is given to a group of participants,
within a specified period of time during the study. For example, a researcher might investigate a new
kind of therapy compared to the traditional treatment. A second example might be to study the effect of a
new teaching method, such as cooperative learning, on student performance. In these two examples, the
variable of interest was something that was given to the participants. Thus, active independent variables
are given to the participants in the study but are not necessarily given or manipulated bv the
experimenter. They may be given by a clinic, school, or someone other than the investigator, but from the
participants' point of view, the situation was manipulated. Using this definition, the treatment is usually
given after the study was planned so that there could have been (or preferably was) a pretest. Other
writers have similar but, perhaps, slightly different definitions of active independent variables.
Randomized experimental and quasi-experimental studies have an active independent variable. An
active independent variable is a necessary but not sufficient condition to make cause and effect
conclusions; the clearest causal conclusions can be drawn when participants are assigned randomly to
conditions that are manipulated by the experimenter.
Attribute or measured independent variables. A variable that cannot be manipulated, yet is a major
focus of the study, can be called an attribute independent variable. In other words, the values of the
independent variable are preexisting attributes of the persons or their ongoing environment that are not
systematically changed during the study. For example, education, gender, age, ethnic group, IQ, and self-
esteem are attribute variables that could be used as attribute independent variables. Studies with only
attribute independent variables are called nonexperimental studies.
In keeping with SPSS, but unlike authors of some research methods books, we do not restrict the term
independent variable to those variables that are manipulated or active. We define an independent variable
more broadly to include any predictors, antecedents, or presumed causes or influences under
investigation in the study. Attributes of the participants, as well as active independent variables, fit
within this definition. For the social sciences and education, attribute independent variables are
especially important. Type of disability or level of disability may be the major focus of a study.
Disability certainly qualifies as a variable since it can take on different values even though they are not
given during the study. For example, cerebral palsy is different from Down syndrome, which is different
from spina bifida, yet all are disabilities. Also, there are different levels of the same disability. People
already have defining characteristics or attributes that place them into one of two or more categories. The
different disabilities are already present when we begin our study. Thus, we might also be interested in
studying a class of variables that are not given or manipulated during the study, even by other persons,
schools, or clinics.
Other labels for the independent variable. SPSS uses a variety of terms in addition to independent
variable; for example, factor (chapters 8,9, and 10), and covariates (chapter 7). In other cases, (chapters
4 and 5) SPSS and statisticians do not make a distinction between the independent and dependent
variable; they just label them variables. For example, there is no independent variable for a correlation
or chi-square. However, even for chi-square and correlation, we think it is sometimes educationally
useful to think of one variable as the predictor (independent variable) and the other as the outcome
(dependent variable), as is the case in regression.
Values of the independent variable. SPSS uses the term values to describe the several options or values
of a variable. These values are not necessarily ordered, and several other terms, categories, levels,
groups, or samples are sometimes used interchangeably with the term values, especially in statistics
books. Suppose that an investigator is performing a study to investigate the effect of a treatment. One
2

Chapter 1 - Introduction
group of participants is assigned to the treatment group. A second group does not receive the treatment.
The study could be conceptualized as having one independent variable (treatment type), with two values
or levels (treatment and no treatment). The independent variable in this example would be classified as
an active independent variable. Now, suppose instead, that the investigator was interested primarily in
comparing two different treatments but decided to include a third no-treatment group as a control group
in the study. The study still would be conceptualized as having one active independent variable
(treatment type), but with three values or levels (the two treatment conditions and the control condition).
As an additional example, consider gender, which is an attribute independent variable with two values, as
male and female.
Note that in SPSS each variable is given a variable label; moreover, the values, which are often
categories, have value labels (e.g., male and female). Each value or level is assigned a number used by
SPSS to compute statistics. It is especially important to know the value labels when the variable is
nominal (i.e., when the values of the variable are just names and, thus, are not ordered).
Dependent Variables
The dependent variable is assumed to measure or assess the effect of the independent variable. It is
thought of as the presumed outcome or criterion. Dependent variables are often test scores, ratings on
questionnaires, readings from instruments (electrocardiogram, galvanic skin response, etc.), or measures
of physical performance. When we discuss measurement, we are usually referring to the dependent
variable. Dependent variables, like independent variables must have at least two values; most dependent
variables have many values, varying from low to high.
SPSS also uses a number of other terms in addition to dependent variable. Dependent list is used in
cases where you can do the same statistic several times, for a list of dependent variables (e.g., in chapter
8 with one-way ANOVA). Grouping variable is used in chapter 7 for discriminant analysis.
Extraneous Variables
These are variables (also called nuisance variables or, in some designs, covariates) that are not of primary
interest in a particular study but could influence the dependent variable. Environmental factors (e.g.,
temperature or distractions), time of day, and characteristics of the experimenter, teacher, or therapist are
some possible extraneous variables that need to be controlled. SPSS does not use the term extraneous
variable. However, sometimes such variables are controlled using statistics that are available in SPSS.
Research Hypotheses and Research Questions
Research hypotheses are predictive statements about the relationship between variables. Research
questions are similar to hypotheses, except that they do not entail specific predictions and are phrased in
question format. For example, one might have the following research question: "Is there a difference in
students' scores on a standardized test if they took two tests in one day versus taking only one test on
each of two days?" A hypothesis regarding the same issue might be: "Students who take only one test
per day will score better on standardized tests than will students who take two tests in one day."
We divide research questions into three broad types: difference, associational, and descriptive as shown
in the middle of Fig 1.1. The figure also shows the general and specific purposes and the general types of
statistics for each of these three types of research question.
Difference research questions. For these questions, we compare scores (on the dependent variable) of
two or more different groups, each of which is composed of individuals with one of the values or levels
3

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
on the independent variable. This type of question attempts to demonstrate that groups are not the same
on the dependent variable.
Associational research questions are those in which two or more variables are associated or related. This
approach usually involves an attempt to see how two or more variables covary (as one grows larger, the
other grows larger or smaller) or how one or more variables enables one to predict another variable.
Descriptive research questions are not answered with inferential statistics. They merely describe or
summarize data, without trying to generalize to a larger population of individuals.
Figure 1.1 shows that both difference and associational questions or hypotheses are similar in that they
explore the relationships between variables.2 Note that difference and associational questions differ in
specific purpose and the kinds of statistics they use to answer the question.

2This similarity is in agreement with the statement by statisticians that all common parametric inferential statistics are
relational. We use the term associational for the second type of research question rather than relational or
correlational to distinguish it from the general purpose of both difference and associational questions/hypotheses,
which is to study relationships. Also we wanted to distinguish between correlation, as a specific statistical technique,
and the broader type of associational question and that group of statistics.
4

Chapter 1 - Introduction
Difference versus associational inferential statistics. We think it is educationally useful to divide
inferential statistics into two types, corresponding to difference and associational hypotheses or
questions.3 Difference inferential statistics (e.g., t test or analysis of variance) are used for approaches
that test for differences between groups. Associational inferential statistics test for associations or
relationships between variables and use, for example, correlation or multiple regression analysis. We will
utilize this contrast between difference and associational inferential statistics in chapter 3 and later in this
book.
Remember that research questions are similar to hypotheses, but they are stated in question format. We
think it is advisable to use the question format when one does not have a clear directional prediction and
for the descriptive approach. As implied by Fig. 1.1, it is acceptable to phrase any research question that
involves two variables as whether or not there is a relationship between the variables (e.g., "Is there a
relationship between gender and math achievement or "Is there a relationship between anxiety and
GPAT\ However, we think that phrasing the question as a difference or association is desirable because
it helps one choose an appropriate statistic and interpret the result.
Complex Research Questions
Most research questions posed in this book involve more than two variables at a time. We call such
questions and the appropriate statistics complex. Some of these statistics are called multivariate in other
texts, but there is not a consistent definition of multivariate in the literature. We provide examples of how
to write complex research questions in the chapter pertaining to each complex statistic.
In a factorial ANOVA, there are two (or more) independent variables and one dependent variable. We
will see, in chapter 8, that although you do one factorial ANOVA, there are actually three (or more)
research questions. This set of three questions can be considered a complex difference question because
the study has two independent variables. Likewise, complex associational questions are used in studies
with more than one independent variable considered together.
Table 1.1 expands our overview of research questions to include both basic and complex questions of
each of the three types: descriptive, difference, and associational. The table also includes references to
other chapters in this book and examples of the types of statistics that we include under each of the six
types of questions.
A Sample Research Problem:
The Modified High School and Beyond (HSB) Study
The SPSS file name of the data set used with this book is hsbdataB.sav; it stands for high school and
beyond data. It is based on a national sample of data from more than 28,000 high school students. The
current data set is a sample of 75 students drawn randomly from the larger population. The data that we
have for this sample includes school outcomes such as grades and the number of mathematics courses of
different types that the students took in high school. Also, there are several kinds of standardized test
data and demographic data such as gender and mother's and father's education. To provide an example
3 We realize that all parametric inferential statistics are relational, so this dichotomy of using one type of data
analysis procedure to test for differences (when there are a few values or levels of the independent variables) and
another type of data analysis procedure to test for associations (when there are continuous independent variables) is
somewhat artificial. Both continuous and categorical independent variables can be used in a general linear model
approach to data analysis. However, we think that the distinction is useful because most researchers utilize the above

of questionnaire data, we have included 14 questions about mathematics attitudes. These data were
developed for this book and, thus, are not really the math attitudes of the 75 students in this sample;
however, they are based on real data gathered by one of the authors to study motivation. Also, we made
up data for religion, ethnic group, and SAT-math, which are somewhat realistic overall. These inclusions
enable us to do some additional statistical analyses.

Statistics (Example)
1) Basic Descriptive Questions - One variable
2) Complex Descriptive Questions â Two or more
variables, but no use of inferential statistics
3) Basic/Single Factor Difference Questions - One
independent and one dependent variable. Independent
variable usually has a few levels (ordered or not).
4) Complex/Multi Factor Difference Question - Three or
more variables. Usually two or a few independent
variables and one (or more) dependent variables.
5) Basic Associational Questions - One independent
variable and one dependent variable. Usually at least five
ordered levels for both variables. Often they are
continuous.
6) Complex/Multivariate Associational Questions - Two
or more independent variables and one dependent
variable. Often five or more ordered levels for all
variables but some or all can be dichotomous variables.

Note: Many studies have more than one dependent variable. It is common to treat each one separately (i.e., to do several t tests, ANOVAs,
correlations, or multiple regressions). However, there are complex statistics (e.g., MANOVA and canonical correlation) used to treat several
dependent variables together in one analysis. QRG = Quick Reference Guide, see Appendix A.
The Research Problem
Imagine that you are interested in the general problem of what factors seem to influence mathematics
achievement at the end of high school. You might have some hunches or hypotheses about such factors
based on your experience and your reading of the research and popular literature. Some factors that might
influence mathematics achievement are commonly called demographics: for example, gender, ethnic
group, and mother's and father's education. A probable influence would be the mathematics courses that
the student has taken. We might speculate that grades in mathematics and in other subjects could have an
6

Chapter 1 - Introduction
impact on math achievement* However, other variables, such as students' IQs or parents'
encouragement and assistance, could be the actual causes of both high grades and math achievement.
Such variables could influence what courses one took, the grades one received, and might be correlates of
the demographic variables. We might wonder how spatial performance scores, such as pattern or mosaic
pattern test scores and visualization scores might enable a more complete understanding of the problem,
and whether these skills seem to be influenced by the same factors as math achievement.
The HSB Variables
Before we state the research problem and questions in more formal ways, we need to step back and
discuss the types of variables and the approaches that might be used to study the above problem. We
need to identify the independent/antecedent (presumed causes) variables, the dependent/outcome
variable(s), and any extraneous variables.
The primary dependent variable. Given the above research problem which focuses on mathematics
achievement at the end of the senior year, the primary dependent variable is math achievement.
Independent and extraneous variables. The number of math courses taken up to that point is best
considered to be an antecedent or independent variable in this study. What about father's and mother's
education and gender1? How would you classify gender and parents' education in terms of the type of
variable? What about grades'? Like the number of math courses, these variables would usually be
considered independent variables because they occurred before the math achievement test. However,
some of these variables, specifically parental education, might be viewed as extraneous variables that
need to be "controlled." Visualization and mosaic pattern test scores probably could be either
independent or dependent variables depending upon the specific research question, because they were
measured at approximately the same time as math achievement, at the end of the senior year. Note that
student's class is a constant and is not a variable in this study because all the participants are high school
seniors (i.e., it does not vary; it is the population of interest).
Types of independent variables. As we discussed previously, independent variables can be active (given
to the participant during the study or manipulated by the investigator) or attributes of the participants or
their environments. Are there any active independent variables in this study? No! There is no
intervention, new curriculum, or similar treatment. All the independent variables, then, are attribute
variables because they are attributes or characteristics of these high school students. Given that all the
independent variables are attributes, the research approach cannot be experimental. This means that we
will not be able to draw definite conclusions about cause and effect (i.e., we will find out what is related
to math achievement, but we will not know for sure what causes or influences math achievement).
Now we will examine the hsbdataB.sav that you will use to study this complex research problem. We
have provided a CD that contains the data for each of the 75 participants on 45 variables. The variables in
the hsbdataB.sav file have already been labeled (see Fig 1.2) and entered (see Fig 1.3) to enable you to
get started on analyses quickly. The CD in this book contains several SPSS data files for you to use, but
it does not include the actual SPSS program, which you will have to have access to in order to do the
assignments.

Figure 1.2 is a piece of what SPSS calls the variable view in the SPSS Data Editor for the hsbdataB.sav
file. Figure 1.2 shows information about each of the first 18 variables. When you open this file and click

on Variable View at the bottom left corner of the screen, this is what you will see. What is included in
the variable view screen is described in more detail in Appendix B, Getting Started. Here, focus on the
Name, Label, Values, and Missing columns. Name is a short name for each variable (e.g.,faedor algl).
Label is a longer label for the variable (e.g., father's education or algebra 1 in h.s.). The Values column
contains the value labels, but you can see only the label for one value at a time (e.g., 0=male). That is,
you cannot see that l=female unless you click on the row for that variable under the value column. The
Missing column indicates whether there are any special, user-identified missing values. None just means
that there are no special missing values, just the usual SPSS system missing value, which is a blank.

Variables in the Modified HSB Data Set
The 45 variables shown in Table 1.2 (with the values/levels or range of their values in parentheses) are
found in the hsbdata.savB file on the CD in the back of the book. Note that variables 33-38 and 42-44
were computed from the math attitude variables (19-32).
The variables of ethnic and religion were added to the original HSB data set to provide true nominal
(unordered) variables with a few (4 and 3) levels or values. In addition, for ethnic and religion, we have
made two missing value codes to illustrate this possibility. All other variables use blanks, the SPSS
system missing value, for missing data. For ethnicity, 98 indicates multiethnic and other. For religion, all
the high school students who were not protestant or catholic or said they had no religion were coded 98
and considered to be missing because none of the other religions had enough members to make a
reasonable size group. Those who left the ethnicity or religion questions blank were coded as 99, also
missing.
5 In SPSS 7-11, the variable name had to be 8 characters or less. In SPSS 12, it can be longer, but we recommend
that you keep it short. If a longer name is used with SPSS 7-11, the name will be truncated. SPSS names must start
with a letter and must not contain blank spaces or certain special characters (e.g.,!,?,', or *).

you leave missing data blank; however, you may run across "user defined" missing data codes like -1,9,
98, or 99 in other researchers' data (see religion, subjects 9 and 11).
Research Questions for the Modified HSB Study7
In this book, we will generate a large number of research questions from the modified HSB data set. In
this section, we list some of the possible questions you might ask in order to give you an idea of the range
of types of questions that one might have in a typical research project like a thesis or dissertation. For
review, we start with basic descriptive questions and some questions about assumptions. Also for review,
we list some basic difference and associational questions that can be answered with basic (two-variable)
inferential statistics such as a t test or correlation. These statistics are not discussed in this book but how
to compute them can be found in the Quick Reference Guide (Appendix A). Finally, we pose a number
of complex questions that can be answered with the statistics discussed in this book.
1) Often, we start with basic descriptive questions about the demographics of the sample. Thus, we
could answer, with the outputs in chapter 2, the following basic descriptive questions: "What is
the average educational level of the fathers of the students in this sample?" "What percentage of
the students is male and what percentage is female?"
2) In chapter 2, we also examine whether the continuous variables are distributed normally, an
assumption of many statistics. One question is "Are the frequency distributions of the math
achievement scores markedly skewed; that is, different from the normal curve distribution?"
3) How to make a table crosstabulating two categorical variables (ones with a few values or
categories) is described in the Quick Reference Guide. Crosstabulation and the chi-square
statistic can answer research questions such as "Is there a relationship between gender and math
grades (high or low)?
4) In the Quick Reference Guide, we will also describe how to answer basic associational research
questions (using Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients) such as, "Is there a positive
association/relationship between grades in high school and math achievement!" A correlation
matrix of all the correlations among several key variables including math achievement will
provide the basis for computing factor analysis in chapter 5 and multiple regression in chapter 6.
In chapter 4, correlation is also used to assess reliability.
5) Basic difference questions such as "Do males and females differ on math achievement!" and "Are
there differences among the three father's education groups in regard to average scores on math
achievement!" can be answered with a t test or one-way ANOVA, as described in the Quick
Reference Guide.
6) Complex difference questions will be answered with factorial ANOVA in chapter 8. One set of
three questions is as follows: (1) "Is there a difference between students who have fathers with no
7 The High School and Beyond (HSB) study was conducted by the National Opinion Research Center (1980). The
example discussed here and throughout the book is based on 13 variables obtained from a random sample of 75 out
of 28,240 high school seniors. These variables include achievement scores, grades, and demographics. The raw data
for the 13 variables were slightly modified from data in an appendix in Hinkle, Wiersma, and Jurs (1994). That file
had no missing data, which is unusual in behavioral science research, so we made some.

college, some college, or a BS or more with respect to the student's math achievement?" (2) "Is
there a difference between students who had a B or better math grade average and those with less
than a B average on a math achievement test at the end of high school?" and (3) "Is there an
interaction between father's education and math grades with respect to math achievement?'
7) How well can you predict math achievement from a combination of four variables: motivation
scale, grades in high school, parents' education, and gender? This complex associational question
can be answered with multiple regression, as discussed in chapter 6. If the dependent variable,
math achievement, were dichotomous (high vs. low achievement), logistic regression or possibly
discriminant analysis, discussed in chapter 7, would be appropriate to answer this question.
8) Are there differences between the three father's education groups on a linear combination of
grades in high school, math achievement, and visualization test! This complex difference question
can be answered with a single-factor multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), as
discussed in chapter 10.
More complex questions can be found in chapters 4-10 under each of the several "problems" in those
chapters.
This introduction to the research problem and questions raised by the HSB data set should help make the
assignments meaningful, and it should provide a guide and examples for your own research.
Frequency Distributions
Frequency distributions are critical to understanding our use of measurement terms. We begin this
section with a discussion of frequency distributions and two examples. Frequency tables and distributions
can be used whether the variable involved has ordered or unordered levels (SPSS calls them values). In
this section, we will only consider variables with many ordered values, ranging from low to high.
A frequency distribution is a tally or count of the number of times each score on a single variable
occurs. For example, the frequency distribution of final grades in a class of 50 students might be 7 As, 20
Bs, 18 Cs, and 5 Ds. Note that in this frequency distribution most students have Bs or Cs (grades in the
middle) and similar smaller numbers have As and Ds (high and low grades). When there are small
numbers of scores for the low and high values and most scores are for the middle values, the distribution
is said to be approximately normally distributed. We will discuss the normal curve in more detail later
in this chapter.
When the variable is continuous or has many ordered levels (or values), the frequency distribution
usually is based on ranges of values for the variable. For example, the frequencies (number of students),
shown by the bars in Fig 1.4, are for a range of points (in this case, SPSS selected a range of 50, 250-299,
300-349,350-399, etc.). Notice that the largest number of students (about 20) has scores in the middle
two bars of the range (450-550). Similar small numbers of students have very low and very high scores.
The bars in the histogram form a distribution (pattern or curve) that is quite similar to the normal, bell-
shaped curve shown by the line that is superimposed on the histogram. Thus, the frequency distribution
of the SAT math scores is said to be approximately normal.
12

Chapter 1 - Introduction
Fig. 1.4. A grouped frequency distribution for SAT math scores.
Figure 1.5 shows the frequency distribution for the competence scale. Notice that the bars form a pattern
very different from the normal curve line. This distribution can be said to be not normally distributed.
As we will see later in the chapter, the distribution is negatively skewed. That is, the tail of the curve or
the extreme scores are on the low end or left side. Note how much this differs from the SAT math score
frequency distribution. As you will see in the Measurement section (below), we call the competence
scale variable ordinal.

Levels of Measurement
Measurement is the assignment of numbers or symbols to the different characteristics (values) of
variables according to rules. In order to understand your variables, it is important to know their level of
measurement. Depending on the level of measurement of a variable, the data can mean different things.
13

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
For example, the number 2 might indicate a score of two; it might indicate that the subject was a male; or
it might indicate that the subject was ranked second in the class. To help understand these differences,
types or levels of variables have been identified. It is common and traditional to discuss four levels or
scales of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio, which vary from the unordered (nominal)
to the highest level (ratio). These four traditional terms are not the same as those used in SPSS, and we
think that they are not always the most useful for determining what statistics to use.
SPSS uses three terms (nominal, ordinal, and scale) for the levels of types or measurement. How these
correspond to the traditional terms is shown in Table 1.3. When you name and label variables in SPSS,
you have the opportunity to select one of these three types of measurement (see Fig 1.2). Although what
you choose does not affect what SPSS does in most cases, an appropriate choice both indicates that you
understand your data and may help guide your selection of statistics.
We believe that the terms nominal, dichotomous, ordinal, and approximately normal (for normally
distributed) are usually more useful than the traditional or SPSS measurement terms for the selection and
interpretation of statistics. In part, this is because statisticians disagree about the usefulness of the
traditional levels of measurement in determining the appropriate selection of statistics. Furthermore, our
experience is that the traditional terms are frequently misunderstood and applied inappropriately by
students. Hopefully, our terms, as discussed below, are clear and useful.
Table 1.3 compares the three sets of terms and provides a summary description of our definitions of
them. Professors differ in the terminology they prefer and on how much importance to place on levels or
scales of measurement, so you will see all of these terms, and the others mentioned below, in textbooks
and articles.

Chapter 1 - Introduction
Nominal Variables
This is the most basic or lowest level of measurement, in which the numerals assigned to each category
stand for the name of the category, but they have no implied order or value. For example, in the HSB
study, the values for the religion variable are 1=protestant, 2 ^catholic, 3 - no religion. This does not
mean that that two protestants equal one catholic or any of the typical mathematical uses of the numerals.
The same reasoning applies to many other true nominal variables, such as ethnic group, type of disability,
or section number in a class schedule. In each of these cases, the categories are distinct and non-
overlapping, but not ordered. Each category or group in the modified HSB variable ethnicity is different
from each other but there is no necessary order to the categories. Thus, the categories could be numbered
1 for Asian-American, 2 for Latino-American, 3 for African-American, and 4 for European-American or
the reverse or any combination of assigning one number to each category.
What this implies is that you must not treat the numbers used for identifying nominal categories as if they
were numbers that could be used in a formula, added together, subtracted from one another, or used to
compute an average. Average ethnicity makes no sense. However, if you ask SPSS to compute the mean
ethnicity, it will do so and give you meaningless information. The important aspect of nominal
measurement is to have clearly defined, non-overlapping or mutually exclusive categories that can be
coded reliably by observers or by self-report.
Using nominal measurement does dramatically limit the statistics that can be used with your data, but it
does not altogether eliminate the possible use of statistics to summarize your data and make inferences.
Therefore, even when the data are unordered or nominal categories, your research may benefit from the
use of appropriate statistics. Later we will discuss the types of statistics, both descriptive and inferential,
that are appropriate for nominal data.
Other terms for nominal variables. Unfortunately, the literature is full of similar, but not identical terms
to describe the measurement aspects of variables. Categorical, qualitative, and discrete are terms
sometimes used interchangeably with nominal, but we think that nominal is better because it is possible
to have ordered, discrete categories (e.g., low, medium, and high IQ, which we and other researchers
would consider an ordinal variable). Qualitative is also used to discuss a different approach to doing
research, with important differences in philosophy, assumptions, and approach to conducting research.
Dichotomous Variables
Dichotomous variables always have only two levels or categories. In some cases, they may have an
implied order (e.g., math grades in high school are coded 0 for less than an A or B average and 1 for
mostly A or B). Other dichotomous variables do not have any order to the categories (e.g., male or
female). For many purposes, it is best to use the same statistics for dichotomous and nominal variables.
However, a statistic such as the mean or average, which would be meaningless for a three or more
category nominal variable (e.g., ethnicity), does have meaning when there are only two categories. For
example, in the HSB data, the average gender is .55 (with males = 0 and females = 1). This means that
55% of the participants were females, the higher code. Furthermore, we will see with multiple regression
that dichotomous variables, called dummy variables, can be used as independent variables along with
other variables that are normally distributed.
Other terms for dichotomous variables. In the SPSS Variable View (e.g., see Fig 1.2), we label
dichotomous variables nominal, and this is common in textbooks. However, please remember that
dichotomous variables are really a special case and for some purposes they can be treated as if they were
15

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
normally distributed. Note that dichotomous data have two discrete categories, so these variables are
sometimes called discrete variables or categorical variables.
Ordinal Variables
In ordinal measurement, there are not only mutually exclusive categories as in nominal scales, but the
categories are ordered from low to high, such that ranks could be assigned (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd). Thus, in
an ordinal scale, one knows which participant is highest or most preferred on a dimension, but the
intervals between the various categories are not equal. Often, whether or not the intervals between
categories are equal is a matter of judgment. Our definition of ordinal focuses on whether the frequency
counts for each category or value are distributed like the bell-shaped, normal curve with more responses
in the middle categories and fewer in the lowest and highest categories. If not approximately normal, we
would call the variable ordinal. Ordered variables with only a few categories (say 2-4) would also be
called ordinal. As indicated in Table 1.3, however, the traditional definition of ordinal focuses on
whether the differences between pairs of levels are equal.
Other terms for ordinal variables. Some authors use the term ranks interchangeably with ordinal.
However, most analyses that are designed for use with ordinal data (nonparametric tests) rank the data as
a part of the procedure, assuming that the data you are entering are not already ranked. Moreover, the
process of ranking changes the distribution of data such that it can be used in many analyses ordinarily
requiring normally distributed data. Ordinal data can be categorical, and so that term is sometimes used
to include both nominal and ordinal data.
Approximately Normal (or Scale) Variables
Approximately normally distributed variables not only have levels or scores that are ordered from low to
high, but also, as stated in Table 1.3, the frequencies of the scores are approximately normally
distributed. That is, most scores are somewhere in the middle with similar smaller numbers of low and
high scores. Thus, a 5-point Likert scale, such as strongly agree to strongly disagree, would be considered
normal if the frequency distribution was approximately normal. We think normality, because it is an
assumption of many statistics, should be the focus of this highest level of measurement. Many normal
variables are continuous (i.e., they have an infinite number of possible values within some range). If not
continuous, we suggest that there be at least five ordered values or levels and that they have an implicit,
underlying continuous nature. For example, a 5-point Likert scale has only five response categories but,
in theory, a person's rating could fall anywhere between 1 and 5.
Other terms for approximately normal variables. Continuous, dimensional, and quantitative are some
terms that you will see in the literature for variables that vary from low to high and are assumed to be
normally distributed. SPSS uses scale, as previously noted.
Traditional measurement terminology uses the terms interval and ratio. SPSS does not use these terms,
but because they are common in the literature and overlap with the term scale, we will describe them
briefly. Interval variables have ordered categories that are equally spaced (i.e., have equal intervals
between them). Most physical measurements (length, -weight, temperature, etc.) have equal intervals
between them. Many physical measurements (length and -weight), in fact, not only have equal intervals
between the levels or scores, but also a true zero, which means in the above examples, zero length or
weight. Such variables are called ratio variables. Our Fahrenheit temperature scale and almost all
psychological scales do not have a true zero and, thus, even if they are very well constructed equal
interval scales, it is not possible to say that zero degrees Fahrenheit involves the absence of something or
that one has no intelligence or no extroversion or no attitude of a certain type. The differences between
interval scales and ratio scales are not important for us because we can do all of the types of statistics that
16

Chapter 1 - Introduction
we have available with interval data. SPSS terminology supports this non-distinction by using the term
scale for both interval and ratio data. In fact, the more important thing, because it is an assumption of
most parametric statistics, is that the variables be approximately normally distributed, not whether they
have equal intervals.
How to Distinguish Between the Types of Measurement
Distinguishing between nominal and ordered variables. When you label variables in SPSS, the
Measure column (see Fig. 1.2) provides only three choices: nominal, ordinal, or scale. How do you
decide? We suggest that if the variable has only two levels, you call it nominal even though it is often
hard to tell whether such a dichotomous variable (e.g., Yes or No, Pass or Fail) is unordered or ordered.
Although some such dichotomous variables are clearly nominal (e.g., gender) and others are clearly
ordered (e.g., math gradesâhigh and low), all dichotomous variables form a special case, as discussed
above.
If there are three or more categories, it is usually fairly easy to tell whether the categories are ordered or
not, so students and researchers should be able to distinguish between nominal and ordinal data. That is
good because this distinction makes a lot of difference in choosing and interpreting appropriate statistics.
Distinguishing between ordinal and normal variables. Is a 5-point Likert scale ordinal or approximately
normal? Using our definitions, there is a way to test variables to see whether it is more reasonable to treat
them as normal variables or ordinal variables. Unfortunately, you will not know for sure until after the
data have been collected and preliminary analyses are done.
Table 1.4 provides a summary of the characteristics and examples of our four types of measurement. It
should provide a good review of the concept of type or level of measurement of a variable.

who determines if the variable is called nominal, ordinal, or scale. We have called dichotomous variables
nominal in our hsbdata file.

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
Descriptive Statistics
Measures of Central Tendency
In chapter 2, we will obtain descriptive statistics to summarize data and check assumptions; we will also
produce plots that visually display distributions of variables. Here we review the meaning of descriptive
statistics.
Three measures of the center of a distribution are commonly used: mean, median, and mode. Any of
them can be used with normally distributed data; however, with ordinal data, the mean of the raw scores
is usually not appropriate. Especially if one is computing certain statistics, the mean of the ranked scores
of ordinal data provides useful information. With nominal data, the mode is the only appropriate
measure.
Mean. The arithmetic average or mean takes into account all of the available information in computing
the central tendency of a frequency distribution. Thus, it is usually the statistic of choice, assuming that
the data are normally distributed data. The mean is computed by adding up all the raw scores and
dividing by the number of scores (M = ZX/N).
Median. The middle score or median is the appropriate measure of central tendency for ordinal level raw
data. The median is a better measure of central tendency than the mean when the frequency distribution
is skewed. For example, the median income of 100 mid-level workers and one millionaire reflects the
central tendency of the group better (and is substantially lower) than the mean income. The average or
mean would be inflated in this example by the income of the one millionaire. For normally distributed
data, the median is in the center of the box and whisker plot.
Mode. The most common category, or mode can be used with any kind of data but generally provides the
least precise information about central tendency. Moreover, if one's data are continuous, there often are
multiple modes, none of which truly represents the "typical" score. In fact if there are multiple modes,
SPSS provides only the lowest one. One would use the mode as the measure of central tendency if the
variable is nominal or if you want a quick non-calculated measure. The mode is the tallest bar in a bar
graph or histogram.
You also can compute the Mean, Median, and Mode, plus other descriptive statistics with SPSS by
using the Frequencies command.

Note in Fig. 1.6 that the mean and median are very similar, which is in agreement with our conclusion
from Fig. 1.4 that SATMis approximately normally distributed. Note that the mode is 500, as shown in
Fig. 1.4 by the tallest bars.

Measures of Variability
Variability tells us about the spread or dispersion of the scores. At one extreme, if all of the scores in a
distribution are the same, there is no variability. If the scores are all different and widely spaced apart,
the variability will be high. The range (highest minus lowest score) is the crudest measure of variability
but does give an indication of the spread in scores if they are ordered.
Standard Deviation. This common measure of variability, is most appropriate when one has normally
distributed data, although the mean of ranked ordinal data may be useful in some cases. The standard
deviation is based on the deviation of each score (x) from the mean of all the scores (M). Those deviation
scores are squared and then summed (L(x-Af)2)- This sum is divided by JV-1, and, finally, the square root
is taken (SD =
Interquartile range. For ordinal data, the interquartile range, seen in the box plot as the distance
between the top and bottom of the box, is a very useful measure of variability. Note that the whiskers
indicate the expected range, and scores outside that range are shown as outliers.
With nominal data, none of the above variability measures (range, standard deviation, or interquartile
range) are appropriate. Instead, for nominal data, one would need to ask how many different categories
there are and what the percentages or frequency counts are in each category to get some idea of
variability. Minimum and maximum frequency may provide some indication of distribution as well.
Conclusions About Measurement and the Use of Statistics
Statistics based on means and standard deviations are valid for normally distributed or normal data.
Typically, these data are used in the most powerful tests called parametric statistics. However, if the
data are ordered but grossly non-normal (i.e., ordinal), means and standard deviations may not give
meaningful answers. Then the median and a nonparametric test would be preferred. Nonparametric tests
typically have somewhat less power than parametric tests (they are less able to demonstrate truly
significant effects), but the sacrifice in power for nonparametric tests based on ranks usually is relatively
minor. If the data are nominal, one would have to use the mode or counts. In this case, there would be a
major sacrifice in power.
Table 1.5 summarizes much of the above information about the appropriate use of various kinds of
descriptive statistics given nominal, dichotomous, ordinal, or normal data.

The Normal Curve
Figure 1.7 is an example of a normal curve. The frequency distributions of many of the variables used in
the behavioral sciences are distributed approximately as a normal curve. Examples of such variables that
approximately fit a normal curve are height, weight, intelligence, and many personality variables. Notice
that for each of these examples, most people would fall toward the middle of the curve, with fewer
people at the extremes. If the average height of men in the United States were 5*10", then this height
would be in the middle of the curve. The heights of men who are taller than 5'10" would be to the right of
the middle on the curve, and those of men who are shorter than 5*10" would be to the left of the middle
on the curve, with only a few men 7 feet or 5 feet tall.
The normal curve can be thought of as derived from a frequency distribution. It is theoretically formed
from counting an "infinite" number of occurrences of a variable. Usually when the normal curve is
depicted, only the X axis (horizontal) is shown. To determine how a frequency distribution is obtained,
you could take a fair coin, and flip it 10 times, and record the number of heads on this first set or trial.
Then flip it another 10 times and record the number of heads. If you had nothing better to do, you could
do 100 trials. After performing this task, you could plot the number of times that the coin turned up heads
out of each trial of 10. What would you expect? Of course, the largest number of trials probably would
show 5 heads out of 10. There would be very few, if any trials, where 0, 1, 9, or 10 heads occur. It could
happen, but the probability is quite low, which brings us to a probability distribution. If we performed
this experiment 100 times, or 1,000 times, or 1,000,000 times, the frequency distribution would "fill in"
and look more and more like a normal curve.
20

Fig. 1.7. Frequency distribution and probability distribution for the normal curve.
Properties of the Normal Curve
The normal curve has five properties that are always present.
1. The normal curve is unimodal. It has one "hump," and this hump is in the middle of the distribution.
The most frequent value is in the middle.
2. The mean, median, and mode are equal.
3. The curve is symmetric. If you fold the normal curve in half, the right side would fit perfectly with
the left side; that is, it is not skewed.
4. The range is infinite. This means that the extremes approach but never touch the X axis.
5. The curve is neither too peaked nor too flat and its tails are neither too short nor too long; it has no
kurtosis.
Non-Normally Shaped Distributions
Skewness. If one tail of a frequency distribution is longer than the other, and if the mean and median are
different, the curve is skewed. Because most common inferential statistics (e.g., / test) assume that the
dependent variable is normally distributed, it is important that we know if our variables are highly
skewed.
Figure 1.5 showed a frequency distribution that is skewed to the left. This is called a negative skew. A
perfectly normal curve has a skewness of zero (0.0). The curve in Fig. 1.5, for the competence scale, has
a skewness statistic of-1.63, which indicates that the curve is quite different from a normal curve. We
will use a somewhat arbitrary guideline that if the skewness is more than +1.0 or less than - 1.0, the
distribution is markedly skewed and it would be prudent to use a nonparametric (ordinal type) statistic.
However, some parametric statistics, such as the two-tailed t test and ANOVA, are quite robust so even a
skewness of more than +/-1 may not change the results much. We will provide more examples and
discuss this more in chapter 2.
Kurtosis. If a frequency distribution is more peaked than the normal curve, it is said to have positive
kurtosis and is called leptokurtic. Note in Fig. 1.4 that the SAT-math histogram is peaked (i.e., the bar for
500 extends above the normal curve line), and thus there is some positive kurtosis. If a frequency
21

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
distribution is relatively flat with heavy tails, it has negative kurtosis and is called platykurtic. Although
SPSS can easily compute a kurtosis value for any variable using an option in the Frequencies command,
usually we will not do so because kurtosis does not seem to affect the results of most statistical analyses
very much.
Areas Under the Normal Curve
The normal curve is also a probability distribution. Visualize that the area under the normal curve is
equal to 1.0. Therefore, portions of this curve could be expressed as fractions of 1.0. For example, if we
assume that 5'10" is the average height of men in the United States, then the probability of a man being
5*10" or taller is .5. The probability of a man being over 6'3" or less than 5'5" is considerably smaller. It is
important to be able to conceptualize the normal curve as a probability distribution because statistical
convention sets acceptable probability levels for rejecting the null hypothesis at .05 or .01. As we shall
see, when events or outcomes happen very infrequently, that is, only 5 times in 100 or 1 time in 100 (way
out in the left or right tail of the curve), we wonder if they belong to that distribution or perhaps to a
different distribution. We will come back to this point later in the book.
All normal curves can be divided into areas or units in terms of the standard deviation. Approximately
34% of the area under the normal curve is between the mean and one standard deviation above or below
the mean (see Fig. 1.7 again). If we include both the area to the right and to the left of the mean, 68% of
the area under the normal curve is within one standard deviation from the mean. Another approximately
13.5% of the area under the normal curve is accounted for by adding a second standard deviation to the
first standard deviation. In other words, two standard deviations to the right of the mean account for an
area of approximately 47.5%, and two standard deviations to the left and right of the mean make up an
area of approximately 95% of the normal curve. If we were to subtract 95% from 100%, the remaining
5% relates to that ever present probability orp value of 0.05 needed for statistical significance. Values
not falling within two standard deviations of the mean are seen as relatively rare events.
The Standard Normal Curve
All normal curves can be converted into standard normal curves by setting the mean equal to zero and the
standard deviation equal to one. Since all normal curves have the same proportion of the curve within one
standard deviation, two standard deviations, and so on, of the mean, this conversion allows comparisons
among normal curves with different means and standard deviations. The normal distribution, has the
standard normal distribution units underneath. These units are referred to as z scores. If you examine the
normal curve table in any statistics book, you can find the areas under the curve for one standard
deviation (z = 1), two standard deviations (z = 2), and so on. As described in the Quick Reference Guide
(Appendix A), it is easy for SPSS to convert raw scores into standard scores. This is often done when
one wants to aggregate or add together several scores that have quite different means and standard
deviations.

CHAPTER 2
Data Coding and Exploratory Analysis (EDA)
Before computing any inferential statistics, it is necessary to code the data, enter the data into SPSS, and
then do exploratory data analysis (EDA) as outlined below. This chapter will help you understand your
data, help you to see if there are any errors, and help you to know if your data meet basic assumptions for
the inferential statistics that you will compute.
Rules for Data Coding
Coding is the process of assigning numbers to the values or levels of each variable. We want to present
some broad suggestions or rules to keep in mind as you proceed. These suggestions are adapted from
rules proposed in Newton and Rudestam's (1999) useful book entitled Your Statistical Consultant. It is
important to note that the recommendations we make are those we find to be most useful in most
contexts, but some researchers might propose alternatives, especially for "rules" 1,2,4, 5, and 7 below.
1. All data should be numeric. Even though it is possible to use letters or words (string variables) as data,
it is not desirable to do so with SPSS. For example, we could code gender as M for male and F for female,
but in order to do most statistics with SPSS, you would have to convert the letters or words to numbers. It
is easier to do this conversion before entering the data into the computer. We decided to code females as 1
and males as 0. This is called dummy coding. In essence, the 0 means "not female." We could, of course,
code males as 1 and females as 0. However, it is crucial that you be consistent in your coding and have a
way to remind yourself and others of how you did the coding. In the Quick Reference Guide (Appendix
A), we show how you can provide such a record, called a codebook.
2. Each variable for each case or participant must occupy the same column in the SPSS Data Editor.
With SPSS it is important that data from each participant occupies only one line (row), and each column
must contain data on the same variable for all the participants. The SPSS data editor, into which you will
enter data, facilitates this by putting the variable names that you choose at the top of each column, as you
saw in Fig. 1.3. If a variable is measured more man once for each participant (e.g.. pretest and posttest). it
needs to be entered on the same row in separate columns with somewhat different names like mathpre
and mathpost.
3. All values (codes) for a variable must be mutually exclusive. That is, only one value or number can be
recorded for each variable. Some items may allow participants to check more than one response. In that
case, the item should be divided into a separate variable for each possible response choice, with one value
of each variable (usually "1") corresponding to yes (checked) and the other (usually "0") to no (not
checked).
Usually, items should be phrased so that persons would logically choose only one of the provided options,
and all possible options are provided. A final category labeled "other" may be provided in cases where all
possible options cannot be listed, but these "other" responses are usually quite diverse and, thus, usually
not very useful for statistical purposes.
4. Each variable should be coded to obtain maximum information. Do not collapse categories or values
when you set up the codes for them. If needed, let the computer do it later. In general, it is desirable to
code and enter data in as detailed a form as available. Thus, enter item scores, ages, GPAs, etc. for each
participant if you know them. It is good to practice asking participants to provide information that is quite
specific. However, you should be careful not to ask questions that are so specific that the respondent may
24

Chapter 2 - Data Coding and EDA
not know the answer or may not feel comfortable providing it. For example, you will obtain more specific
information by asking participants to state their GPA to two decimals than if you asked them to select
from a few broad categories (e.g., less than 2.0, 2.0-2.49,2.50-2.99, etc.). However, if students don't
know their exact GPA or don't want to reveal it precisely, they may leave the question blank, guess, or
write in a difficult to interpret answer.
These issues might lead you to provide a few categories, each with a relatively narrow range of values, for
variables such as age, weight, and income. Never collapse such categories before you enter the data into
SPSS. For example, if you had age categories for university undergraduates 16-18, 18-20, 21-23, and so
on and you realize that there are only a few students in the below 18 group, keep the codes as they are for
now. Later you can make a new category of 20 or under by using an SPSS function, Transform =>
Recede. If you collapse categories before you enter the data, the information is lost.
5. For each participant, there must be a code or value for each variable. These codes should be
numbers, except for variables for which the data are missing. We recommend using blanks when data are
missing or unusable, because SPSS is designed to handle blanks as missing values. However, sometimes
you may have more than one type of missing data, such as items left blank and those that had an answer
that was not appropriate or usable. In this case, you may assign numeric codes such as 98 and 99 to them,
but you must tell SPSS that these codes are for missing values, or SPSS will treat them as actual data.
6. Apply any coding rules consistently for all participants. This means that if you decide to treat a certain
type of response as, say, missing for one person, you must do the same for all other participants.
7. Use high numbers (value or codes) for the "agree," "good," or "positive" end of a variable that is
ordered. However, if the variable has a negative label (e.g., aggressiveness), higher numbers should
refer to more of the trait. Sometimes you will see questionnaires that use 1 for "strongly agree," and 5 for
"strongly disagree." This is not wrong as long as it is clear and consistent. However, you are less likely to
get confused when interpreting your results if high values have positive meaning, indicate that something
was done (e.g., an algebra 1 course was taken), or indicate more of the characteristic.
Make a coding form and/or codebook. Now you need to make some decisions about how to code the
data, especially data that are not already in numerical form. When the responses provided by participants
are numbers, the variable is said to be "self-coding." You can just enter the number that was circled or
checked on the questionnaire. On the other hand, variables such as gender or ethnicity have no intrinsic
values associated with them, so a number has to be assigned to each level or value.
Fix problems with the completed questionnaires. Now examine the questionnaires (or other new data)
for incomplete, unclear, or double answers. The researcher needs to use rules to handle these problems
and note the decision on the questionnaires or on a master "coding instructions" sheet or file so that the
same rules are used for all cases. For each type of incomplete, blank, unclear, or double answer, you need
to make a rule for what to do. As much as possible, you should make these rules before data collection,
but there may well be some unanticipated issues. It is important that you apply the rules consistently for
all similar problems so as not to bias your results.
Missing data create problems in later data analysis, especially for complex statistics. Thus, we want to use
as much of the data provided as is reasonable. The important thing here is that you must treat all similar
problems the same way. If a participant only answered some of the questions, there will be lots of
missing data for that person. We could have a rule such as if half the items were blank or invalid, we
would throw out that whole questionnaire as invalid. In your research report, you should state how many
questionnaires were thrown out and for what reason(s). If a participant circled two responses (e.g., 3 and
4 on a 5-point Likert scale), a reasonable decision would be to enter the average or midpoint, 3.50.
25

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
Clean up completed questionnaires. Once you have made your rules and decided how to handle each
problem, you need to make these rules clear to the person entering the data. A common procedure would
be to write your decisions on the questionnaires, perhaps in a different color. You also need to have a
master file and hard copy of all the rules that you used.
In the process of understanding your data, different types of analyses and plots will be generated
depending on what level of measurement you have. Therefore, it is important to identify whether each of
your variables is nominal, dichotomous, ordinal, or normal (SPSS uses the term scale; see chapter 1).
Keep in mind that there are times when whether you call a variable ordinal or scale might change based
on your EDA. For example, a variable that you considered to be ordinal may be normally distributed,
and, thus, better labeled as scale. Remember that making the appropriate choice indicates that you
understand your data and should help guide your selection of a statistic.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
What Is EDA?
After the data are entered into SPSS, the first step to complete (before running any inferential statistics) is
EDA, which involves computing various descriptive statistics and graphs. Exploratory Data Analysis is
used to examine and get to know your data. Chapter 1 and especially this chapter focus on ways to do
exploratory data analysis with SPSS. EDA is important to do for several reasons:
1. To see if there are problems in the data such as outliers, non-normal distributions, problems with
coding, missing values, and/or errors inputting the data.
2. To examine the extent to which the assumptions of the statistics that you plan to use are met.
In addition to these two reasons which are discussed in this chapter, one could also do EDA for other
purposes such as:
3. To get basic information regarding the demographics of subjects to report in the Method section or
Results section.
4. To examine relationships between variables to determine how to conduct the hypothesis-testing
analyses. For example, correlations can be used to see if two or more variables are so highly related
that they should be combined (aggregated) for further analyses and/or if only one of them should be
included in the central analyses. We created parents' education by combining, father's and mother's
education, because they are quite highly correlated.
How to Do EDA
There are two general methods used for EDA: generating plots of the data and generating numbers from
your data. Both are important and can be very helpful methods of investigating the data. Descriptive
Statistics (including the minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, and skewness), frequency
distribution tables, boxplots, histograms, and stem and leaf plots are a few procedures used in EDA.
After collecting data and inputting it into SPSS, many students jump immediately to doing inferential
statistics (e.g., t tests and ANOVAs). Don't do this! Many times there are errors or problems with the data
that need to be located and either fixed or at least noted before doing any inferential statistics.
26

Chapter 2 - Data Coding and EDA
At this point, you are probably asking "Why?" or "I'll do that boring descriptive stuff later while I am
writing the methods section." Wait! Being patient can alleviate many problems down the road.
In the next two sections, we discuss checking for errors and checking assumptions. Some of this
discussion reviews basic material, but it is so important that it is worth going over again.
Check for Errors
There are many ways to check for errors; for example:
1. As mentioned above, look over the raw data (questionnaires, interviews, or observation forms) to see if
there are inconsistencies, double coding, obvious errors, etc. Do this before entering the data into the
computer.
2. Check some, or preferably all, of the raw data (e.g., questionnaires) against the data in your SPSS
Data Editor file to be sure that errors were not made in the data entry.
3. Compare the minimum and maximum values for each variable in your Descriptives output with the
allowable range of values in your codebook.
4. Examine the means and standard deviations to see if they look reasonable, given what you
know about the variables.
5. Examine the N column to see if any variables have a lot of missing data, which can be a problem when
you do statistics with two or more variables. Missing data could also indicate that there was a problem
in data entry.
6. Look for outliers in the data.
Check the Assumptions
As noted above, exploratory data analysis can be used to check the assumptions of a statistic. Several
assumptions are common to more than one statistic, so in this chapter we will provide an introduction to
how to test for them. First, we will define statistical assumptions and briefly discuss several of the most
common.
Statistical Assumptions
Every statistical test has assumptions. Statistical assumptions are much like the directions for appropriate
use of a product found in an owner's manual. Assumptions explain when it is and isn't reasonable to
perform a specific statistical test. When the / test was developed, for example, the person who developed
it needed to make certain assumptions about the distribution of scores, etc., in order to be able to calculate
the statistic accurately. If these assumptions are not met, the value that SPSS calculates, which tells the
researcher whether or not the results are statistically significant, will not be completely accurate and may
even lead the researcher to draw the wrong conclusion about the results. In each chapter, the appropriate
inferential statistics and their assumptions are described.
Parametric tests. These include most of the familiar ones (e.g., / test, analysis of variance, Pearson
correlation, and almost all of the statistics discussed in chapters 4-10). They usually have more
assumptions than nonparametric tests. Parametric tests were designed for data that have certain
characteristics, including approximately normal distributions.
27

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
Some parametric statistics have been found to be "robust" to one or more of their assumptions. Robust
means that the assumption can be violated without damaging the validity of the statistic. For example,
one assumption of ANOVA is that the dependent variable is normally distributed for each group.
Statisticians who have studied these statistics have found that even when data are not completely
normally distributed (e.g., they are somewhat skewed), they still can be used.
Nonparametric tests. These tests (e.g., chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, Spearman rho) have fewer
assumptions and often can be used when the assumptions of a parametric test are violated. For example,
they do not require normal distributions of variables or homogeneity of variances. Unfortunately, there
are few nonparametric tests similar to the intermediate statistics discussed in the book so we will have
little to say about them here.
Common Assumptions
Homogeneity of variances. Both the / test and ANOVA may be affected quite a lot if the variances
(standard deviation squared) of the groups to be compared are substantially different, especially if the
number of participants in each group differs markedly. Thus, this is often a critical assumption to meet or
correct for. Fortunately, SPSS provides the Levene test to check this assumption.
Normality. As mentioned above, many parametric statistics assume that certain variables are distributed
approximately normally. That is, the frequency distribution would look like a symmetrical bell-shaped or
normal curve, with most subjects having values in the mid range and with a smaller number of subjects
with high and low scores. A distribution that is asymmetrical, with more high than low scores (or vice
versa), is skewed. Thus, it is important to check skewness. Most statistics books do not provide advice
about how to decide whether a variable is at least approximately normal. SPSS recommends that you
divide the skewness by its standard error. If the result is less than 2.5 (which is approximately the/? = .01
level), then skewness is not significantly different from normal. A problem with mis method, aside from
having to use a calculator, is that the standard error depends on the sample size, so with large samples
most variables would be found to be nonnormal. A simpler guideline is that if the skewness is less than
plus or minus one (< +/-1.0), the variable is at least approximately normal. There are also several other
ways to check for normality. In this chapter we will look at two graphical methods: boxplots and
frequency polygons. However, remember that t (if two-tailed) and ANOVA are quite robust to violations
of normality.
Independence of observations. The assumption of independence of observations is that there is no
relationship between the scores for one person and those of another person. For example, if you know one
subject's value on one variable (e.g., competence), then you should not be able to guess the value of that
variable for any other particular participant. Sometimes, this assumption is violated because one's
procedures for sampling participants create systematic bias. For example, "snowball sampling," in which
participants recommend other participants for the study, is likely to lead to nonindependence of
observations because participants are likely to recommend people who are similar to themselves.
Obviously, members of the same family, or the same person measured on more than one occasion, do not
comprise independent observations. There are particular methods (matched samples or "repeated
measures" methods) designed to deal with the nonindependence of family members or the same person
measured several times, or participants who are matched on some characteristic. However, these can not
easily be applied to snowball sampling because different participants recommend a different number of
other participants.
Linearity. Linearity is the assumption that two variables are related in a linear fashion. If variables are
linearly related, then when plotted in a scatterplot, the data will fall in straight line or in a cluster that is
relatively straight. Sometimes, if the data are not linearly related (i.e., the plot looks curved), the data can
be transformed to make the variables linearly related.
28

Chapter 2 - Data Coding and EDA
Checking for Errors and Assumptions With Ordinal and Scale Variables
The level of measurement of a variable you are exploring (whether it is nominal, ordinal, dichotomous, or
normal/scale) influences the type of exploratory data analysis (EDA) you will want to do. Thus, we have
divided this chapter by the measurement levels of the variable because, for some types of variables,
certain descriptive statistics will not make sense (e.g., a mean for a nominal variable, or a boxplot for a
dichotomous variable). Remember that the researcher has labeled the type of measurement as either
nominal, ordinal, or scale when completing the SPSS Data Editor Variable View. Remember also that
we decided to label dichotomous variables nominal, and variables that we assumed were normally
distributed were labeled scale.
For all of the examples in this chapter, we will be using the hsbdataB file, which is on the CD in the back
of this book. Because this chapter is meant to be an overview and review of EDA, we have formatted the
chapter to be read rather than as a series of problems for you to solve, as is done in chapters 4-10.
However, we have provided the syntax and parts of the SPSS outputs if you decide that you want to
actually run these problems with SPSS.
See Appendix B for instructions if you need help with this or getting started with SPSS. Appendix B also
shows how to set your computer to print the SPSS syntax on the output.
Using all of the HSB variables that were labeled as ordinal or scale in the SPSS Variable View, it is
important to see if the means make sense (are they close to what you expected?), to examine the
minimum and maximum values of the data, and to check the shape of the distribution (i.e., skewness
value). One way to check these is with the SPSS Descriptive command. Examining your data to see if the
variables are approximately normally distributed, an assumption of most of the parametric inferential
statistics that we will use, is important. To understand if a variable is normally distributed, we compute
the skewness index, which helps determine how much a variable's distribution deviates from the
distribution of the normal curve. Skewness refers to the lack of symmetry in a frequency distribution.
Distributions with a long "tail" to the right have a positive skew and those with a long tail on the left have
a negative skew. If a frequency distribution of a variable has a large (plus or minus) skewness value, that
variable is said to deviate from normality. Some of the statistics that we will use later in the book are
robust or quite insensitive to violations of normality. Thus, we will assume that it is okay to use them to
answer most of our research questions as long as the variables are not extremely skewed.
The Descriptives command will make a compact, space-efficient output. You could instead run the
Frequencies program because you can get the same statistics with that command. (We will use the
Frequencies command later in the chapter.) Now we will compute the mean, standard deviation,
skewness, minimum, and maximum for all participants or cases on all the variables that were called
ordinal or scale under measure in the SPSS Data Editor Variable View. We will not include the nominal
variables (ethnicity and religion) or gender, algebral, algebra2, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, and
math grades, which are dichotomous variables.
First, we compute descriptive statistics for all of the variables that were called ordinal. These include
father's education, mother's education, grades in h.s., and all the item variables (item 01 through item
14), math courses taken, mother's education revised, father's education revised, said parents' education.
Next, we run Descriptives for the scale variables: math achievement, mosaic, visualization, visualization
retest, scholastic aptitude test-math, competence, motivation, and pleasure scale.

Chapter 2 - Data Coding and EDA
Interpretation of Outputs 2. la and 2.1 b
These outputs provide descriptive statistics for all of the variables labeled as ordinal (2. la) and scale
(2.1b). Notice that the variables are listed down the left column of the outputs and the requested
descriptive statistics are listed across the top row. The descriptive statistics included in the output are the
number of subjects (N), the Minimum (lowest) and Maximum (highest) scores, the Mean (or average)
for each variable, the Std. (the standard deviation), and the Skewness statistic and the Std. Error of the
skewness. Note, from the bottom line of the outputs, that the Valid N (listwise) is 69 for Output 2. la
and 71 for 2.1b rather than 75, which is the number of participants in the data file. This is because the
listwise N only includes the persons with no missing data on any variable requested in the output.
Notice that several variables (e.g., father's education and itemOl in 2.la, and motivation and competence
in 2.1 b) each have one or two participants with missing data.
Using your output to check your data for errors. For both the ordinal and scale variables, check to
make sure that all Means seem reasonable. That is, you should check your means to see if they are
within the ranges you expected (given the information in your codebook and your understanding of the
variable). Next, check the output to see that the Minimum and Maximum are within the appropriate
(codebook) range for each variable. If the minimum is smaller or the maximum is bigger than you
expected (e.g., 100 for a variable that only has 1-50 for possible values), then you should suspect that
there was an error somewhere and you need to check it out. Finally, you should check the N column to
see if the Ns are what you were expecting. If it happens that you have more participants missing than
you expected, check the original data to see if some were entered incorrectly. Notice that competence
scale and motivation scale each have a few participants missing.
Using the output to check assumptions. The main assumption that we can check from this output is
normality. We won't pay much attention to the skewness for item 01 to item 14 and mother's and
father's education revised. These ordinal variables have fewer than five levels, so they will not be
considered to be scale even though some of them are not very skewed. We will not use the "items" as
individual variables because we will be combining them to create summated variables (the motivation
and competence and pleasure scales) before using inferential statistics.
From Output 2. la, we can see that, of the variables with five or more levels that we called ordinal, four
of them (father's education, grades in h.s., math courses taken, and parent's education) are
approximately normally distributed; that is, they have five or more levels and have skewness values
between -1 and 1. Thus, we can assume that they are more like scale variables, and we can use
inferential statistics that have the assumption of normality. To better understand these variables, it may
be helpful to change the Measure column in the Variable View so that these four variables will be
labeled as scale. Note that mother's education, with a skewness statistic of 1.12, is more skewed than is
desirable.
For the variables that were labeled as scale, indicating our belief that they were normally distributed, we
can now check this assumption. Look at the skewness value in Output 2. Ib to see if it is between -1 and
1. From the output we see that most of these variables have skewness values between -1 and 1, but
competence at 1.63 is quite skewed.
There are several ways to check this assumption in addition to checking the skewness value. If the
mean, median, and mode, which can be obtained with the Frequencies command, are approximately
equal, then you can assume that the distribution is approximately normally distributed. For example, the
mean (490.53), median (490.00), and mode (500) for scholastic aptitude test- math are very similar
values, and the skewness value is .128 (see Output 2.1b). Thus, we can assume that SAT-math is
approximately normally distributed.
31

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
In addition to numerical methods for understanding your data, there are several graphical methods. SPSS
can create histograms with the normal curve superimposed and also frequency polygons (line graphs) to
roughly assess normality. The trouble is that visual inspection of histograms can be deceiving because
some approximately normal distributions don't look very much like a normal curve.
Boxplots of One or Several Variables
Boxplots and stem-and-leaf plots can be used to examine some HSB variables. Boxplots are a method of
graphically representing ordinal and scale data. They can be made with many different combinations of
variables and groups. Using boxplots for one, two, or more variables or groups in the same plot can be
useful in helping you understand your data.

Notice that there are three

Interpretation of Outputs 2.2a and 2.2b
Outputs 2.2a and 2.2b include boxplots generated from the Explore command. We did not include
the Case Processing Summary tables that show the Valid N, Missing cases, and Total cases. In
Output 2.2a, for math achievement, the valid N is 75, and there are no missing cases. The plot in
Output 2.2a includes only one boxplot for our requested variable of math achievement. Each "box"
represents the middle 50% of the cases, and the "whiskers" at the top and bottom of the box indicate
the "expected" top and bottom 25%. If there were outliers there would be "O"s and if there were
really extreme scores they would be shown with asterisks, above or below the end of the whiskers.
Notice that there are not any Os or *s in the boxplot in Output 2.2a.
For Output 2.2b, notice that there are two separate boxplots, one for competence and one for
motivation. As indicated by the Os at or below the lower whiskers, the boxplot for competence
shows there are three outliers, and the boxplot for motivation indicates there is one outlier.
Using your output to check your data for errors. If there are Os or asterisks, then you need to check
the raw data or score sheet to be sure there was not an error. The numbers next to the Os indicate
which participants these scores belong to. This can be helpful when you want to check to see if these
are errors or if they are the actual scores of the subject.
Using the output to check your data for assumptions. Boxplots can be useful for identifying
variables with extreme scores, which can make the distribution skewed (i.e., nonnormal). Also if
there are few outliers, if the whiskers are approximately the same length, and if the line in the box is
approximately in the middle of the box, then you can assume that the variable is approximately
normally distributed. Thus, math achievement (Output 2.2a) is near normal, motivation (2.2b) is
approximately normal, but competence (2.2b) is quite skewed and not normal.
Boxplots Split by a Dichotomous Variable
If you use the syntax below, you will get an output file complete with separate statistics, stem-and-leaf
plots, and boxplots for males' and females' math achievement scores. This is useful if you want to see if
the distributions of scores are very different for the two groups, which would suggest heterogeneity of
variances.

Interpretation of Output 2.3
The first table under Explore provides descriptive statistics about the number of males and females
with Valid and Missing data. Note that we have 34 males and 41 females with valid math
achievement test scores.
The Descriptives table contains many different statistics for males and females separately, some of
which (e.g., kurtosis) are not covered in this book. Note that the average math achievement test score
is 14.76 for the males and 10.75 for females. We will discuss the variances and skewness below
under assumptions.
The Stem-and-Leaf Plots, for each gender separately, are next. These plots are like a histogram or
frequency distribution turned on the side. They give a visual impression of the distribution, and they
usually show each person's score on the dependent variable (math achievement). The stem is the first
digit of the score and the leaf is the second digit. Note that the legend indicates that Stem width
equals 10. This means that entries that have 0 for the stem are less than 10, with the leaf indicating
the actual number (1-9), those with 1 as the stem range from 10 to 19, etc. Note also that the legend
indicates that each leaf equals one case. Each number in the leaf column represents the last digit of
one person's math achievement score. The numbers in the Frequency column indicate how many
participants had scores in the range represented by that stem. Thus, in the male plot, one student had a
stem of 0 and a leaf of 3; that is, a score of 3. The frequency of male students with leafs between 5
and 9 is 7, and there were three scores of 5, two of 7, and two of 9. Eleven participants had a stem of
1 and a leaf of 0 to 4; one had a leaf of 0 (a score of 10); two had scores of 11, one had a score of 13,
and six had a score of 14.
Boxplots are the last part of the output. There are two boxplots (one for males and one for females).
By inspecting the plots, we can see that the median score for males is quite a bit higher than that for
females, although there is some overlap of the boxes and substantial overlap of the full distributions.
We need to be careful in concluding that males score higher than females, especially based on a small
sample of students. In chapter 8, we will show how an inferential statistic (analysis of covariance) can
tell us whether this apparent gender difference is actually due to gender differences in another
variable (number of math courses taken).
35

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
Using the output to check your data for errors. Checking the boxplots and stem-and-leaf plots can
help identify outliers that might be data entry errors. In this case, there aren't any.
Using the output to check your data for assumptions. As noted in the interpretation of Outputs 2.2a
and 2.2b, you can tell if a variable is grossly nonnormal by looking at the boxplots. The stem-and-
leaf plots provide similar information. You can also examine the skewness values for each gender
separately in the table of Descriptives (see the circled skewness values). Note that for both males
and females, the skewness values are less than one, which indicates that math achievement is
approximately normal for both genders. This is an assumption of the t test and ANOVA, and
multivariate versions of this assumption are required for many of the statistics performed in this book.
The Descriptives table also provides the variances for males and females. A key assumption of
ANOVA and the t test is that the variances are approximately equal (i.e., the assumption of
homogeneity of variances). Note mat the variance is 36.38 for males and 44.84 for females. These
do not seem grossly different, and if we did a Levene test on differences between males and females
in variances on this variable, we'd find that the difference is not significantly different (see chapter
10, Morgan, Leech, Gloekner, & Barrett, 2004). Thus, the assumption of homogeneous variances is
not violated. The boxplots and stem-and-leaf plots help you see this.
Using Tables and Figures for EDA with Discrete Variables
Descriptives for Dichotomous Variables
We will now use the Descriptives command for each of the dichotomous variables. Once again, we could
have done Frequencies, with or without frequency tables, but we chose Descriptives. This time we
selected fewer statistics because the standard deviation, variance, and skewness values are not very
meaningful with dichotomous variables.

Interpretation of Output 2.4
Output 2.4 includes only one table of Descriptive Statistics. Across the top row are the requested
statistics of TV, Minimum, Maximum, and Mean. We could have requested other statistics, but
they would not be very meaningful for dichotomous variables. Down the left column are the
variable labels. The N column indicates that all the variables have complete data. The Valid N
(listwise) is 75, which also indicates that all the participants had data for each of our requested
variables.
The most helpful column is the Mean column. You can use the mean to understand what percentage
of participants fall into each of the two groups. For example, the mean of gender is .55, which
indicates that 55% of the participants were coded as 1 (female); thus, 45% were coded 0 (male).
Because the mean is greater than .50, there are more females than males. If the mean is close to 1 or
0 (e.g., algebra 1 and calculus), then splitting the data on that dichotomous variable might not be
useful because there will be many participants in one group and very few participants in the other.
Using your output to check your data for errors. The Minimum column shows that all the
dichotomous variables had "0" for a minimum, and the Maximum column indicates that all the
variables have "1" for a maximum. This is good because it agrees with the codebook.
Frequency Tables
Displaying Frequency tables for variables can help you understand how many participants are in each
level of a variable and how much missing data of various types you have. For nominal variables, most
descriptive statistics are meaningless. Thus, having a frequency table is usually the best way to
understand your nominal variables. We created a frequency table for ethnicity (a nominal variable) and
for father's education (an ordered variable).

Interpretation of Output 2.5
There is one Frequency table for ethnicity and one for father's education. The left-hand column shows
the Valid categories (or levels or values), Missing values, and Total number of participants. The
Frequency column gives the number of participants who had each value. The Percent column is the
percent who had each value, including missing values. For example, in the ethnicity table, 54.7% of all
participants were Euro-American, 20.0% were African-American, 13.3% were Latino-American, and
9.3% were Asian-American. There also were a total of 2.7% missing: 1.3% were multi ethnic, and 1.3
were left blank. The valid percent shows the percentage of those with nonmissing data at each value; for
example, 56.2% of the 73 students with a single valid ethnic group were Euro-Americans. Finally,
Cumulative Percent is the percentage of subjects in a category plus the categories listed above it.
This last column is not very useful with nominal data, but can be quite informative for frequency
distributions with several ordered categories. For example, in the distribution of father's education, 74%
of the fathers had less than a bachelor's degree (i.e., they had not graduated from college).
Using your output to check your data for errors. Errors can be found by checking to see if the number
missing is the number you expected. Also, if you have more than one type of missing data, and you
assigned different numbers to these (e.g., 98 and 99), you will see the types listed in the first column.
Using the output to check your data for assumptions. Frequency tables are helpful for checking the
levels of the variable to see if you have subjects in each one. If one of the levels does not have many
subjects in it, it can create problems with difference statistics (see chapter 3 for an explanation of types of
difference statistics).
Bar Charts
With nominal data, you should not use a graphic that connects adjacent categories because with nominal
data there is no necessary ordering of the categories or levels. Thus, it is better to make a bar graph or
chart of the frequency distribution of variables like religion, ethnic group, or other nominal variables; the
points that happen to be adjacent in your frequency distribution are not by necessity adjacent.

Interpretation of Output 2.6
There are two parts to the output: a statistics table (not shown) and the bar chart. The Statistics table
indicates the valid N and the missing N. The bar chart presents a bar for each level of the nominal
variable. Keep in mind that the order of the bars is arbitrary. The order of the bars can be changed by
clicking on the plot, then clicking on the bars. The Chart Editor Properties box will appear and the level
can be changed within this window.
Using your output to check your data for errors. Errors can be seen if the levels are not what you were
expecting. For example, if you inadvertently entered the wrong number (a number that does not have a
category label), you will see a bar for that number, with the number used as a label for the bar. Also, if
there are no participants for a level, there will not be a bar for that level.
Using the output to check your data for assumptions. Bar charts are helpful if you are unsure how many
categories a variable has; you can count the number of bars. You can also see the number of participants
in each level. It is best if there are approximately the same number of subjects in each level if one wants
to use the variable in procedures like ANOVA and MANOVA.
Some Additional Figures for Scale Variables
Histograms
Histograms (shown in chapter 1) look much like bar charts except in histograms there is no space between
the boxes, indicating that there is a continuous variable theoretically underlying the scores (i.e., scores
could theoretically be any point on a continuum from the lowest to highest score). Histograms can be used
even if data, as measured, are not continuous, if the underlying variable is conceptualized as continuous.
For example, the competence scale items were rated on a 4-point scale, but one could, theoretically, have
any amount of competence.

Frequency Polygons
Output 2.7 is a frequency polygon; it connects the points between the categories, and is best used with
approximately normal data, but it can be used with ordinal data.

Graph
Interpretation of Output 2.7
The frequency polygon presents frequency counts for one variable (listed along the bottom; motivation
scale in this example). Each level of the variable is listed along the bottom and the counts are listed along
the side. We can see from this frequency polygon that the largest number of participants had a motivation
level of 2.8 (12), and only one person had scores of 1.2 and 1.3.
Using your output to check your data for errors. Errors can be seen with the frequency polygon if there
are values you were not expecting or if there are larger or smaller counts than you were expecting.
Using the output to check your data for assumptions. We can see that the data are somewhat normally
distributed because the highest counts are in the middle, with smaller counts on either end. We would still
want to check skewness values as well.
Matrix Scatterplots
To check linearity and get a visual idea about whether there is likely to be a problem with
multicollinearity (see chapter 6), we can do matrix scatterplots. In this example, we used math
achievement, math courses taken, pleasure scale, and mosaic pattern test.
To develop a scatterplot of math achievement, math courses taken, pleasure scale, and mosaic pattern
test, follow these commands:
â¢ 
Graphs => Scatter.
â¢ 
Click on Matrix.
â¢ 
Click on Define.
â¢ 
Now, move math achievement, math courses taken, pleasure scale, and mosaic pattern test to the
Matrix Variables box.
â¢ 
Click on OK. You will get Output 2.8, the matrix scatterplot with circles for the data points.

To change the circles to the Xs (as we have below) double click on a data point (one of the circles).
This will open the Chart Editor. Double click again on one of the circles in the Chart Editor. This
will open the Properties window.

In the Properties window, click on the arrow under Type. Select the X.

hInterpretation of Output 2.8
The matrix scatterplot command in Output 2.8 creates multiple bivariate scatterplots. It is most helpful to
create a matrix scatterplot when you need to understand the relationships among several variables. In a
scatterplot, each X (or O) represents a data point. There are six bivariate scatterplots in the Output 2.8.
Keep in mind that there are duplicate relationships shown (i.e., there are two bivariate scatterplots for
each pair of variables); you should look at one side or the other of the empty boxes.

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
Using your output to check your data for errors. At times, there might be a data point that is extreme;
there might be one that is not at all close to the other data points. If this is the case, it might be an outlier
or it might be an error.
Using the output to check your data for assumptions. The clusters or clouds of Xs can be examined for
the assumption of linearity. If a straight line can be drawn so that most of the Xs lie relatively close to it,
we can assume that the two variables are related in a linear fashion (e.g., see math achievement and math
courses taken indicated with an A in Output 2.8). If the Xs are not in any order or if they appear to be
spread out in a cloud (e.g., see pleasure and math courses taken, indicated with an B in Output 2.8), we
can assume that there is no relationship between the variables. If a scatterplot shows little relationship
between two predictors, this means there is little chance of collinearity involving these variables. If it
relates a predictor and a dependent variable, it means that the predictor is unlikely to contribute much to
predicting the dependent variable.
However, when the clusters appear to be creating a curve, rather than a straight line, we can assume the
variables might be related in a curvilinear fashion. We would not want to use them in computing a
statistic that has the assumption of linearity without fixing this problem first by transforming one or both
of the variables, as shown below.
Transforming Variables
If the variables do not meet the assumptions, we might consider transformation. Transformations usually
increase the difficulty of interpretation of the data and may change the results of the study, so you need to
be sure you really need to transform the data and also that you will be able to interpret the transformed
variable in your writing.
Finding the best transformation for a variable may be guided by certain guidelines, but often trial and
error is needed to determine if the transformation was successful. The most common transformations,
what the transformation can fix, and the SPSS syntax commands are listed below. If you do not know
which transformation is best, start where the arrow is on the figure and go up one row. After you
transform a variable, you need to rerun the assumptions to see if the newly transformed variable meets the
assumptions. If not, go down one row and check assumption. If assumptions are not met, go up two
rows, etc.

Chapter 2 - Data Coding and EDA
You can do transformations either through the point and click method or with syntax. If you want to
compute X3, X2, or 1/X2, you have to either type in the expression as written or use syntax because these
functions are not available as specific choices in the Compute command.
To use the point and click method, follow these commands.
â¢ 
Transform => Compute. The Compute Variable window will open. Type a name for the new
variable in the Target Variable box => Click on Type & Label => The Compute Variable: Type
and Label window will open => Scroll down the Functions box => Find the function you want to try
(see Fig. 2.1 for assistance in choosing) and click on it => Click on the arrow above the box to move
the function into the Numeric Expression box => Click on the variable you are interested in
transforming => Click on the arrow to move it to the Numeric Expression box => OK. If the
transformation is not listed under Functions, then you can just type it into the Numeric Expression
box, or you can type it into the syntax listing. The new variable you computed will appear in the far
right column in the Data View window. To see if the transformation was successful, retest the
assumptions.
To use syntax, follow the guidelines below.

Interpretation of Output 2.9
As shown in Output 2.1b, competence is negatively skewed (skewness = -1.634). In order to use this
variable with statistics that require a normally distributed variable, we needed to transform it. Since
competence is negatively skewed, we chose to square it to see if it would be less skewed. Output 2.9
shows the syntax for transforming competence by squaring it. After squaring, the skewness = -.911. We
might have stopped there, but -.911 is very close to - 1.0, and we want it not to be skewed even this
much, so we transformed it by cubing (the original values). After transforming, the skewness value is -
.445, which is still slightly skewed, but now falls well within the recommended guidelines of < |1| (greater
than -1 and less than

CHAPTER 3
Selecting and Interpreting Inferential Statistics
To understand the information in this chapter, it may be necessary to remember or to review the sections
in chapter 1 about variables and levels of measurement (nominal, dichotomous, ordinal, and
approximately normal/scale). It is also necessary to remember the distinction we made between
difference and associational research questions and between descriptive and inferential statistics. This
chapter focuses on inferential statistics, which as the name implies, refers to statistics that make
inferences about population values based on the sample data that you have collected and analyzed. What
we call difference inferential statistics lead to inferences about the differences (usually mean
differences) between groups in the populations from which the samples were drawn. Associational
inferential statistics lead to inferences about the association or relationship between variables in the
population. Thus, the purpose of inferential statistics is to enable the researcher to make generalizations
beyond the specific sample data. Before we describe how to select and interpret inferential statistics, we
will introduce design classifications.
General Design Classifications for Difference Questions
Many research questions focus on whether there is a significant difference between two or more groups
or conditions. When a group comparison or difference question is asked, the independent variable and
design can be classified as between groups or within subjects. Understanding this distinction is one
essential aspect of determining the proper statistical analysis for this type of question.
Labeling difference question designs. Brief descriptive labels identify the design for other researchers
and also guide us toward the proper statistics to use. We do not have design classifications for the
descriptive or associational research questions, so this section only applies to difference questions.
Designs are usually labeled in terms of (a) the overall type of design (between groups or within subjects),
(b) the number of independent variables, and (c) the number of levels within each independent variable.
Between-groups designs. These are designs where each participant in the research is in one and only one
condition or group. For example, there may be three groups (or levels or values) of the independent
variable, treatment type. If the investigator wished to have 20 participants in each group, then 60
participants would be needed to carry out the research.
Within subjects or repeated measures designs. These designs are conceptually the opposite of between
groups designs. In within subjects designs, each participant in the research receives or experiences all of
the conditions or levels of the independent variable. These designs also include examples where the
participants are matched by the experimenter or in some natural way (e.g., twins, husband and wife, or
mother and child). When each participant is assessed more than once, these designs are also referred to
as repeated measures designs. Repeated measures designs are common in longitudinal research and
intervention research. Comparing performance on the same dependent variable assessed before and after
intervention (pretest and posttest) is a common example of a repeated measures design. We might call the
independent variable in such a study "time of measurement." The HSB study did not really have a
within-subjects aspect to the design. However, one of the variables is repeated (visualization with two
levels: visualization test and visualization retest) and one is within (education, each student has both a
mother's education vxul father's education). To demonstrate a within subjects design and the use of
repeated measured ANOVA, we will use another data set, called Product Data, that is found on the
CD in this book. This small data set has within subjects data ratings by each participant, one for each
46

Chapter 3 - Selecting and Interpreting Inferential Statistics
of four different products (e.g., DVDs, but they could be any four stimuli). The same types of analysis
could be done if, instead of each participant rating four different products in the same session, the ratings
were done for satisfaction with the same product at four times. In that case, the data would be repeated
measures data. In addition, to demonstrate a doubly multivariate design, in which there are repeated
assessments of several measures, we will use the data set called mixedMANOVAdata.
Single factor designs. If the design has only one independent variable (in either a between groups design
or a within subjects design), then it should be described as a basic or single factor or one-way design.
("Factor" and "way" are other names for difference independent variables.) For example, a between
groups design with one independent variable that has four levels is a single factor or one-way between
groups design with four levels. If the design is a within subjects design with four levels, then it would be
described as a single factor, repeated measures design with four levels (e.g., the same test being given
four times).
Between groups factorial designs. When there is more than one group difference independent variable,
and each level of each factor (independent variable) is possible in combination with each level of each of
the other factors, the design is called factorial. For example, a factorial design could have two
independent variables (i.e., factors) gender and ethnicity, allowing for male and female members of each
ethnic group. In these cases, the number of levels of each factor (independent variable) becomes
important in the description of the design. If gender had two levels (i.e., males and females) and
ethnicity had three levels (i.e., Caucasian, Hispanic, and African-American), then this design is a 2 x 3
between groups factorial design.
Mixed factorial designs. If the design has a between groups variable and a within subjects independent
variable, it is called a mixed design. For example, say the independent variables are gender (a between-
groups variable) and time of measurement (with pretest and posttest as within-subjects levels); this is a 2
x 2 mixed factorial design with repeated measures on the second factor. The mixed design is common in
experimental studies with a pretest and posttest.
Remember, when describing a design, that each independent variable is described using one number,
which is the number of levels for that variable. Thus a design description with two numbers (e.g., 3x4)
has two independent variables or factors, which have three and four levels, respectively. The dependent
variable is not part of the design description, so it was not considered in this section.
Selection of Inferential Statistics
It is time to think about how to decide which of the many possible inferential statistics to use. Because
many statistical tests are introduced, don't be concerned if you don't know about all of the tests
mentioned. You should come back to this chapter later, from time to time, when you have to make a
decision about which statistic to use, and by then, the tests will be more familiar.
In Fig 3.1, we present eight steps to guide you in the selection of a proper statistical test for data analysis.
Remember that difference questions compare groups and utilize the statistics, which we call difference
inferential statistics. These statistics (e.g., t test and analysis of variance) are shown in Tables 3.1 and
3.3.
Associational questions utilize what we call associational inferential statistics. The statistics in this
group examine the association or relationship between two or more variables and are shown in Tables 3.2

and 3.4. This distinction is somewhat of a simplification. There is often more than one possible statistic
that can be used.

Using Tables 3.1 to 3.4 to Select Inferential Statistics
As with research questions and hypotheses discussed in chapter 1, we divide inferential statistics into
basic and complex. For basic (or bivariate) statistics, there is one independent and one dependent
variable and you will use Table 3.1 or 3.2. These basic statistics are discussed in more detail in our
companion book, Morgan, Leech, Gloeckner, and Barrett (2004). For complex statistics, there are three
or more variables. We decided to call them complex rather than multivariate, which is more common in
the literature, because there is not unanimity about the definition of multivariate, and several complex
statistics (e.g., factorial ANOVA) are not usually classified as multivariate. For complex statistics, you
will use Tables 3.3 or 3.4. The complex statistics shown in Tables 3.3 and 3.4 are discussed in the
48

Chapter 3 - Selecting and Interpreting Inferential Statistics
remaining chapters in this book, and assignments and outputs are given demonstrating how to compute
them using SPSS 12. There are other statistics, but these four tables include most of the inferential
statistics that you will encounter in reading research articles. Note that the boxes in the decision tree are
numbered to correspond to the numbers in the text below, which expands some on the decision tree or
flowchart.
1. Decide how many variables there are in your research question or hypothesis. If there are only two
variables, use Tables 3.1 or 3.2. If there is more than one independent and/or more than one dependent
variable (i.e., three or more variables) to be used in this analysis, use Tables 3.3 and 3.4.
Basic (Two variable) Statistics
2. If the independent variable is nominal (i.e., has unordered levels) or has a few (2-4) ordered levels,
use Table 3.1. Then, your question is a basic difference question to compare groups. You must then
determine: (a) whether there are two or more than two levels (also called categories or groups or
samples) of your independent variable, (b) whether the design is between groups or within subjects, and
(c) whether the measurement of the dependent variable is (i) normal/scale and parametric assumptions
are not markedly violated, or (ii) ordinal, or (iii) nominal or dichotomous. The answers to these
questions lead to a specific box in Table 3.1 and statistics such as independent or paired sample / tests,
one-way ANOVA, chi-square and several other nonparametric tests.
3. If both variables are nominal or dichotomous. you could ask either a difference question (use the
bottom row of Table 3.1, e.g., chi-square) or an associational question and use the bottom row of Table
3.2 (phi or Cramer's V). Note, in the second to bottom row of Table 3.2, we have included eta; an
associational statistic used with one nominal and one normal or scale variable. We will later see it used
as an effect size measure with ANOVAs. There are many other nonparametric associational measures,
some of which are in Table 3.2.
4. If both variables have many (we suggest five or more) ordered levels, use Table 3.2 (top two rows).
Your research question would be a basic two variable (bivariate) associational question. Which row you
use depends on both variables. If both are normal/scale, then you would probably select the Pearson
product moment correlation or bivariate regression (top row). Regression should be used if one has a
clearly directional hypothesis, with an independent and dependent variable. Correlation is chosen if one
is simply interested in how the two variables are related. If one or both variables are ordinal (ranks or
grossly skewed), or if other assumptions are markedly violated, the second row (Kendall's tau or
Spearman rho) is a better choice.
Complex (3 or more variable) Questions and Statistics
It is possible to break down a complex research problem or question into a series of basic (bivariate)
questions and analyses. However, there are advantages to combining them into one complex analysis;
additional information is provided and a more accurate overall picture of the relationships is obtained.
5. If you have one normally distributed (scale) dependent variable and two (or perhaps three or four)
independent variables, each of which is nominal or has a few (2-4) ordered levels, you will use the top
row of Table 3.3 and one of three types of factorial ANOVA. These analysis of variance (ANOVA)
statistics answer complex difference questions.
Note, in Table 3.3, that there are no complex difference statistics in SPSS designed to be used when the
dependent variable is ordinal. Loglinear analysis is a nonparametric statistic similar to the between
group factorial ANOVA when all the variables are nominal or dichotomous (see Table 3.3).

more independent or predictor variables and one normal (scale) dependent variable, the top row of Table
3.4 and multiple regression are appropriate.
8. If the dependent variable is dichotomous or nominal, consult the bottom row of Table 3.4. In general,
logistic regression is used if some or all the independent variables are dichotomous. Discriminant
analysis can best be used if the independent variables are all ordered/scale.

Occasionally you will see a research article in which a dichotomous dependent variable was used with a /
test, ANOVA, or Pearson correlation. Because of the special nature of dichotomous variables, this is not
necessarily wrong, as would be the use of a nominal (three or more unordered levels) dependent variable
with these parametric statistics. However, we think that it is usually a better practice to use the same
statistics with dichotomous variables that you would use with nominal variables, except that it is
appropriate to use dichotomous independent variables in multiple regression (see Table 3.4).

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
Other Multivariate (Complex) Statistics
Not shown, in part because they did not fit the format of the tables, are six complex associational
statistics for analyzing a number of variables at a time, which you may see in the literature. Cronbach's
alpha, a technique used to assess the internal consistency reliability of multiple item scales, is discussed,
along with some other reliability measures, in chapter 4. In exploratory factor analysis, one postulates
that there is a smaller set of latent variables or constructs. Factor analysis and principal components
analysis, which is used to reduce a relatively large number of variables to a smaller number of groups of
variables, are discussed in chapter 5. Canonical correlation involves correlation of linear combinations
of one set of variables with linear combinations of another set of variables. Thus, it is useful when you
have two sets of variables and want to see the patterns of correlations between the two sets. How to
compute it with syntax is shown in chapter 10.
Because they cannot be computed using SPSS (without the extra program called AMOS), two other
forms of complex statistics are not discussed in this book. Structural equation models (SEM) are
models that describe relationships among latent (unobserved) variables and manifest (observed)
variables. Hierarchical Linear Models (HLM) enable one to model nested data (data in which certain
variables are only present in a subset of one's data) over time. Both SEM and HLM provide tests of the
accuracy of proposed models, and both are very useful for drawing better inferences from large sets of
data. However, it is important to realize that, despite the language sometimes used hi discussing SEM
and HLM, even they do not enable one to determine causal relationships (e.g., see the APA Task Force
on Statistical Inference report, Wilkinson, et al., 1999, p. 600).
The General Linear Model
Whether or not there is a relationship between variables can be answered in two ways. For example, if
each of two variables provides approximately normally distributed data with five or more levels, then
Fig. 3.1 and Table 3.2 indicate that the statistic to use is either the Pearson correlation or bivariate
regression, and that would be our recommendation. However, some researchers choose to divide the
independent variable into a few categories such as low, medium, and high and then do a one-way
ANOVA. In another example, some researchers who start with an independent variable that has only a
few (say, two to four) ordered categories may choose to do a correlation instead of a one-way ANOVA.
Although these choices are not necessarily wrong, we do not think they are the best practice. In the first
example information is lost by dividing a continuous independent variable into a few categories. In the
second example, there would be a restricted range, which tends to decrease the size of the correlation
coefficient.
In the above examples, we recommended one of the choices, but the fact that there are two choices raises
a bigger and more complex issue. Statisticians point out, and can prove mathematically, that the
distinction between difference and associational statistics is an artificial one, in that ANOVA and
multiple regression using dummy variables are often mathematically the same. In fact, SPSS calculates
ANOVA and MANOVA using this regression approach. The bottom of Fig. 3.2 shows these parallels
and that, although we have made a distinction between difference and associational inferential statistics,
they both serve the purpose of exploring (top box) relationships and both are subsumed by the general
linear model (middle box). Statisticians state that all common parametric statistics are relational. Thus,
the full range of methods used to analyze one continuous dependent variable and one or more
independent variables, either continuous or categorical, are mathematically similar. The model on which
this is based is called the General Linear Model. The idea is that the relationship between the
52

Chapter 3 - Selecting and Interpreting Inferential Statistics
independent and dependent variables can be expressed by an equation with weights for each of the
independent/predictor variables plus an error term.
What this means is that if you have a continuous, normally distributed dependent/outcome variable and
five or so levels of an ordered, normally distributed independent variable, it would be appropriate to
analyze it with either bivariate regression or a one-way ANOVA. You will get a similar answer with
regard to the significance level. Note in Fig. 3.1 and Table 3.3 that SPSS uses the GLM to perform a
variety of statistics including factorial ANOVA and MANOVA. Although we recognize that our
distinction between difference and associational parametric statistics is a simplification, we still think it
is useful heuristically. We hope that this glimpse of an advanced topic is clear and helpful.

Interpreting the Results of a Statistical Test
In the following chapters, we present information about how to check assumptions, do SPSS analysis,
and interpret complex statistics, and write about them. For each statistic, the SPSS computations produce
a calculated value based on the specific data in your study. SPSS labels them /, F, etc. or just value.
Statistical Significance
The calculated value is compared to a critical value (found in a statistics table or stored in the
computer's memory) that takes into account the degrees of freedom, which are usually based on the
number of participants. Figure 3.3 shows how to interpret any inferential test once you know the
probability level (p or sig.) from the computer or statistics table. In general, if the calculated value of the
statistic (/, F, etc.) is relatively large, the probability orp is small (e.g., .05, .01, .001). If the probability
53

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
is less than the preset alpha level (usually .05), we can say that the results are statistically significant or
that they are significant at the .05 level or that/? < .05. We can also reject the null hypothesis of no
difference or no relationship. Note that, using SPSS computer printouts, it is quite easy to determine
statistical significance because the actual significance or probability level (p) is printed so you do not
have to look up a critical value in a table. SPSS labels this/? value Sig. so all of the common inferential
statistics have a common metric. This level is also the probability of a Type I error or the probability of
rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. Thus, regardless of what specific statistic you use,
if the Sig. or/? is small (usually less than .05) the finding is statistically significant, and you can reject the
null hypothesis of no difference and assume there is a difference (or no association).
Practical Significance Versus Statistical Significance
Students, and sometimes researchers, misinterpret statistically significant results as being practically or
clinically important. But statistical significance is not the same as practical significance or importance.
With large samples, you can find statistical significance even when the differences or associations are
very small/weak. Thus, in addition to statistical significance, we will examine effect size. It is quite
possible, with a large sample, to have a statistically significant result that is weak (i.e., has a small effect
size). Remember that the null hypothesis is that there is no difference or no association. A significant
result with a small effect size means that we can be very confident that there is some difference or
association, but it is probably small and may not be practically important.
hFig. 3.3. Interpreting inferential statistics using the SPSS Sig.
Confidence Intervals
One alternative to null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is to create confidence intervals. These
intervals provide more information than NHST and may provide more practical information. Suppose
one knew that an increase in reading scores of 5 points would lead to a functional increase in reading
performance. Two methods of instruction were compared. The result showed that students who used the
new method scored statistically significantly higher man those who used the other method. According to
NHST, we would reject the null hypothesis of no difference between methods and conclude that our new
method is better. If we apply confidence intervals to this same study, we can determine an interval that
contains the population mean difference 95% of the time. If the lower bound of that interval is greater
54

Chapter 3 - Selecting and Interpreting Inferential Statistics
than 5 points, we conclude that using this method of instruction would lead to a practical or functional
increase in reading levels. If however, the confidence interval ranged from say 1 to 11, the result would
be statistically significant, but the mean difference in the population could be as little as 1 point, or as big
as 11 points. Given these results, we could not be confident that there would be a practical increase in
reading using the new method.
Effect Size
A statistically significant outcome does not give information about the strength or size of the outcome.
Therefore, it is important to know, in addition to information on statistical significance, the size of the
effect. Effect size is defined as the strength of the relationship between the independent variable and the
dependent variable, and/or the magnitude of the difference between levels of the independent variable
with respect to the dependent variable. Statisticians have proposed many effect size measures that fall
mainly into two types or families: the r family and the d family.
The r family of effect size measures. One method of expressing effect sizes is in terms of strength of
association. The most well-known variant of this approach is the Pearson correlation coefficient, r.
Using Pearson r, effect sizes are always less than |1.0|, varying between -1.0 and +1.0 with 0
representing no effect and +1 or -1 the maximum effect. This family of effect sizes includes many other
associational statistics as well, such as rho (rs), phi ((|>), eta ( TJ ), and the multiple correlation (R).
The d family of effect size measures. The d family focuses on magnitude of difference rather than
strength of association. If one compares two groups, the effect size (d) can be computed by subtracting
the mean of the second group from the mean of the first group and dividing by the pooled standard
deviation of both groups. The general formula is on the left. If the two groups have equal ns, the pooled
SD is the average of the SDs for the two groups. When ns are unequal, the formula on the right is the
appropriate one.
There are many other formulas for d family effect sizes, but they all express effect size in standard
deviation units. Thus, a d of .5 means that the groups differ by one half of a pooled standard deviation.
Using d, effect sizes usually vary from 0 to + or -1 but d can be more than 1.
Issues about effect size measures. Unfortunately, as just indicated, there are many different effect size
measures and little agreement about which to use. Although d is the most commonly discussed effect
size measure for differences, it is not available on SPSS outputs. However, d can be calculated by hand
based on information in the SPSS printout. The correlation coefficient, r, and other measures of the
strength of association such as phi (<j>), eta2(t|2), and R1 are available in SPSS 12.
There is disagreement among researchers about whether it is best to express effect size as the unsquared
or squared r family statistic (e.g., r or r2). It has been common to use the squared versions because they
indicate the percentage of variance in the dependent variable that can be predicted from the independent
variable(s). However, some statisticians argue that these usually small percentages give you an
underestimated impression of the strength or importance of the effect. Thus, we (like Cohen, 1988)
decided to use the unsquared statistics (r, (j), r\t and R) as our r family indexes.
55

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
Although the 4th edition of the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA,
1994) recommended that researchers report effect sizes, relatively few researchers did so before 1999
when the APA Task Force on Statistical Inference stated that effect sizes should always be reported for
your primary results (Wilkinson & The APA Task Force, 1999). The 5th edition (APA, 2001) adopted
this recommendation of the Task Force, so more and more journal articles discuss the size of the effect as
well as whether or not the result was statistically significant.
Interpreting Effect Sizes
Assuming that you have computed an effect size measure, how should it be interpreted? Table 3.5
provides guidelines for interpreting the size of the "effect" for five common effect size measures based
on Cohen (1988).
Note that these guidelines are based on the effect sizes usually found in studies in the behavioral
sciences. Thus, they do not have absolute meaning and are only relative to typical findings in these
areas. For that reason, we might suggest using larger than typical instead of large, typical instead of
medium, and smaller than typical instead of small. The guidelines will not apply to all subfields in the
behavioral sciences, and they definitely will not apply to fields where the usually expected effects are
either larger or smaller. It is advisable to examine the research literature to see if there is information
about typical effect sizes on the topic.

* d values can vary from 0.0 to much greater than + or -1.0, but the latter is relatively uncommon.
b r family values can vary from 0.0 to + or - 1.0, but except for reliability (i.e., same concept measured twice), r is rarely above .70. In fact,
some of these statistics (e.g., phi) have a restricted range in certain cases; that is, the maximum phi may be less than 1.0.
c Partial etas from SPSS multivariate tests are equivalent to R. Use R column.
d The numbers in this table should be interpreted as a range of values. For example a d greater than .90 (or less than -.90) would be described as
very large, a d between say .70 and .90 would be called large, and d between say .60 and .70 would be medium to large.
Cohen (1988) provided research examples of what we labeled small, medium, and large effects to support
the suggested d and r family values. Many researchers would not consider a correlation (r) of .5 to be
very strong because only 25% of the variance in the dependent variable is predicted. However, Cohen
argued that a d of .8 (and an r of .5, which he shows are mathematically similar) are "grossly perceptible
and therefore large differences, as (for example is) the mean difference in height between 13- and 18-
year-old girls" (p. 27). Cohen stated that a small effect may be difficult to detect, perhaps because it is in
a less well-controlled area of research. Cohen's medium size effect is ".. .visible to the naked eye. That
is, in the course of normal experiences, one would become aware of an average difference in IQ between
clerical and semi-skilled workers..." (p. 26).

Chapter 3 - Selecting and Interpreting Inferential Statistics
Even effect size is not the same as practical significance. Although effect size measures indicate the
strength of the relationship and, thus, are more relevant for practical significance or importance than
statistical significance, they are not direct measures of the importance of a finding. As implied above,
what constitutes a large or important effect depends on the specific area studied, the context, and the
methods used. Furthermore, practical importance always involves a judgment by the researcher and the
consumers (e.g., clinicians, clients, teachers, school boards) of research that takes into account such
factors as cost and political considerations. A common example is that the effect size of taking daily
aspirin and its effect on heart attacks is quite small, but the practical importance is high because
preventing heart attacks is a life or death matter, the cost of aspirin is low, and side effects are
uncommon. On the other hand, a curriculum change could have a large effect size but be judged to not
be practical because of high costs and/or extensive opposition to its implementation.
Steps in Interpreting Inferential Statistics
First, decide whether to reject the null hypothesis. However, that is not enough for a full interpretation.
If you find that the outcome is statistically significant, you need to answer at least two more questions.
Figure 3.4 summarizes the steps described below about how to more fully interpret the results of an
inferential statistic.
hFig. 3.4. Steps in the interpretation of an inferential statistic.
Second, what is the direction of the effect? Difference inferential statistics compare groups so it is
necessary to state which group performed better. We discuss how to do this in chapters 8, 9 and 10. For
associational inferential statistics (e.g., correlation), the sign is very important, so you must indicate
57

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
whether the association or relationship is positive or negative. We discuss how to interpret correlations
in chapters 4, 5, and 6, as part of the chapters on reliability, factor analysis, and multiple regression.
Third, what is the size of the effect? You should include effect size, confidence intervals, or both in the
description of your results. Unfortunately, SPSS does not always provide effect sizes and confidence
intervals, so for some statistics we will have to compute or estimate the effect size by hand.
Fourth, but not shown in Fig. 3.4, the researcher or the consumer of the research should make a judgment
about whether the result has practical or clinical significance or importance. To do so, they need to take
into account the effect size, the costs of implementing change, and the probability and severity of any
side effect or unintended consequences.
An Example of How to Select and Interpret Inferential Statistics
As a review, we now provide an extended example based on the HSB data. We will walk you through
the process of identifying the variables, research questions, and approach, and then show how we
selected appropriate statistics and interpreted the results.
Research problem. Suppose your research problem was to investigate gender and math courses taken
and their relationship to math achievement.
Identification of the variables and their measurement. The research problem specifies three variables:
gender, math courses taken, and math achievement. The latter appears to be the outcome or dependent
variable. Gender and math courses taken are the independent or predictor variables. Because they
occurred before the math exam, they are presumed to have an effect on math achievement scores. What
is the level of measurement for these three variables? Gender is clearly dichotomous (male or female).
Math courses taken has six ordered values, from 0 to 5 courses. These are scale data because there
should be an approximately normal distribution of scores: Most students took some but not all of the
math courses. Likewise, the math achievement test has many levels, with more scores somewhere in the
middle than high or low. It is necessary to confirm that math courses taken and math achievement are at
least approximately normally distributed by requesting that SPSS compute the skewness of each.
Research questions. There are a number of possible research questions that could be asked and statistics
that could be used with these three variables. However, we will focus on three research questions and
three inferential statistics because they answer this research problem and fit our earlier recommendations
for good choices. First, we will discuss two basic research questions, given the above specification of the
variables and their measurement. Then, we will discuss a complex research question that could be asked
instead of research questions 1 and 2.
1. Is there a difference between male and female genders in their average math achievement
scores?
Type of research question. Using the text, Fig. 3.1, and Table 3.1, you should see that the first question
is phrased as a basic difference question because there are only two variables and the focus is a group
difference (the difference between the male group and the female group).
Selection of an appropriate statistic. If you examine Table 3.1, you will see that the first question
should be answered with an independent samples t test because (a) the independent variable has only two
values (male and female), (b) the design is between groups (males and females form two independent
58

Chapter 3 - Selecting and Interpreting Inferential Statistics
groups), and (c) the dependent variable (math achievement) is normal or scale data. We also would
check other assumptions of the / test to be sure that they are not markedly violated.
Interpretation of the results for research question 1. Let's assume that about 50 students participated in
the study and that t = 2.05. SPSS will give you the exact Sig., but is;? < .05 and, thus, t is statistically
significant. (However, if you had 25 participants, this / would not have been significant because the t
value necessary for statistical significance is influenced strongly by sample size. Small samples require a
larger t to be significant.) Deciding whether the statistic is significant only means the result is unlikely to
be due to chance. You still have to state the direction of the result and the effect size and/or the
confidence interval. To determine the direction, we need to know the mean (average) math
achievement scores for males and females. Let's assume, as is true for the HSB data, that males have the
higher mean. If so, you can be quite confident that males in the population are at least a little better at
math achievement, on average, than females, and you should state that males scored higher than females.
If the difference was not statistically significant, it is best not to make any comment about which mean
was higher because the difference could be due to chance. Likewise, if the difference was not
significant, we recommend that you do not discuss or interpret the effect size. However, you should
provide the means and standard deviations so that effect sizes could be computed if a researcher wanted
to use this study in a meta-analysis.
Because the t was statistically significant, we would calculate d and discuss the effect size as shown
earlier. First, figure the pooled (weighted average) standard deviation for male and female math
achievement scores. Let's say that the difference between the means was 2.0 and the pooled standard
deviation was 6.0; then d would be .33, a somewhat less than typical size effect. This means that the
difference is less than typical of the statistically significant findings in the behavioral sciences. A d of
.33 may or may not be a large enough difference to use for recommending programmatic changes (i.e., be
practically significant).
Confidence intervals might help you decide if the difference in math achievement scores was large
enough to have practical significance. For example, say you found (from the lower bound of the
confidence interval) that you could only be confident that there was a .5 difference between males and
females. Then you decide whether that is a big enough difference to justify, for example, a programmatic
change.
2. Is there an association between math courses taken and math achievement?
Type of research question. This second question is phrased as a basic associational question because
there are only two variables and both have many ordered levels. Thus, use Table 3.2 for this question.
Selection of an appropriate statistic. As you can see from Table 3.2, research question 2 should be
answered with a Pearson correlation because both math courses taken and math achievement are
normally distributed data.
Interpretation of the results for research question 2. The interpretation of r is based on similar
decisions. If r = .30 (with 50 subjects), it would be statistically significant at the/? < .05 level. If the r is
statistically significant, you still need to discuss the direction of the correlation and effect size. Because
the correlation is positive, we would say that students with a relative high number of math courses taken
tend to perform at the high end on math achievement and those with few math courses taken tend to
perform poorly on math achievement. The effect size of r = .30; that is, medium or typical. Note that if
Wwere 25, r = .30 would not be significant. On the other hand, if N were 500 and r = .30,p would be
59

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
< .0001. With N- 500, even r = .10 would be statistically significant, indicating that you could be quite
sure the association was not zero, but the effect size would be small or less than typical.
Complex research question and statistics. As stated above, there are advantages to considering the two
independent variables (gender and math courses taken) together rather than separately as in research
questions 1 and 2. There are at least two statistics that you will compute that can be used to consider
gender and math courses taken together. The first is multiple regression, which is discussed in chapter
6. If you examine Table 3.4, you will see that with two (or more) independent variables that are scale
and/or dichotomous and one dependent variable that is approximately normal (scale) data, an appropriate
associational statistic would be multiple regression. A research question, which subsumes both questions
1 and 2 above, could be:
3. Is there a combination of gender and math courses that predicts math achievement1!
Selection of an appropriate statistic. As just stated, multiple regression could be used to answer this
question. As you can see in Table 3.4, multiple regression is appropriate because we are trying to predict
a normally distributed variable (math achievement) from two independent variables. The independent or
predictor variables are math courses taken (normal or scale) and gender (a dichotomous variable).
Based on our discussion of the general linear model (GLM), a two-way factorial ANOVA would be
another statistic that could be used to consider both gender and math courses simultaneously. However,
to use ANOVA, the many levels of math courses taken would have to be receded into two or three levels
(perhaps high, medium, and low). Because information is lost when you do such a recede, we would not
recommend factorial ANOVA for this example. Another possible statistic to use for this example is
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) using gender as the independent variable and math courses taken as
the covariate. We will demonstrate in chapter 8 how we can control for gender differences in the number
of math courses taken by using math courses as a covariate.
Interpretation of the results for research question 3. We will discuss the interpretation of multiple
regression results in chapter 6 and factorial ANOVA and ANCOVA in chapter 8. We will see that we
will obtain more information about the relationships among these three variables by doing these complex
statistics than by doing only the t test and correlation.
Review of Writing About Your Outputs
One of the goals of this book is to help you write a research report or thesis/dissertation using the SPSS
outputs. In each of the following chapters, we will provide an Interpretation of each output, as well as
an example of how you might write about and make a table from the results provided by the output. As a
review of how to write about a t test and correlation, we have provided this section, which could be from
a thesis based on the expanded HSB data used in the assignments in this book.
Before demonstrating how you might write about the results of research questions 1 and 2 above, we
want to make several important points. Several books that will help you write a research paper and make
appropriate tables are listed in For Further Reading at the back of this book. Note especially the APA
manual (2001), Nicol and Pexman (1999), and Morgan, Reichart, and Harrison (2002). The examples
below and in the following chapters are only one way to write about SPSS outputs. There are other good
ways.

Chapter 3 - Selecting and Interpreting Inferential Statistics
Based on your SPSS outputs, you should update the Methods chapter that you wrote as a proposal to
include descriptive statistics about the demographics (e.g., gender, age, ethnicity) of the participants.
You should add to your proposal evidence related to the reliability and validity or your
measures/instruments with your sample. You also should include in your report whether statistical
assumptions of the inferential statistics were met or how adjustments were made.
The Results chapter or section includes a description (but not a discussion) of the findings in words and
tables. Your Results section should include the following numbers about each statistically significant
finding (in a table or the text):
1. The value of the statistic (e.g., t = 2.05 or r = .30)
2. The degrees of freedom (often in parentheses) and for chi-square the N (e.g., df= 2,N= 49).
3. Thep or Sig. Value (e.g.,/? =.048).
4. The direction of the finding (e.g., by stating which mean is larger or the sign of
the correlation, if the statistic is significant).
5. An index of effect size from either the d family or the r family.
When not shown in a table, the above information should be provided in the text as shown below. In
addition to the numerical information, describe your significant results in words, including the variables
related, the direction of the finding, and an interpretive statement about the size/strength of the effect,
perhaps based on Cohen (1988) or Table 3.5. Realize that these terms are only rough estimates of the
magnitude of the "effect" based on what is typical in the behavioral sciences, but not necessarily your
topic.
If your paper includes a table, it is usually not necessary or advisable to include all the details about the
value of the statistic, degrees of freedom, and/? in the text, because they are in the table. If you have a
table, you must refer to it by number (e.g., Table 1) in the text and describe the main points, but do not
repeat all of it or the table is not necessary. You should not describe, in the text, the direction of the
finding or the effect size of nonsignificant findings, because the results could well be due to chance. The
Discussion chapter or section puts the findings in context in regard to the research literature, theory, and
the purposes of the study. You may also attempt to explain why the results turned out the way they did.
An Example of How to Write About the Results of a t Test and a Correlation
Results
For research question 1, there was a statistically significant difference between male and female students
on math achievement, /(48) = 2.05, p =.04,d= .33. Males (M= 14.70, SD = 5.50) scored higher that
females (M=12.70, SD=6.50), and the effect size was smaller than typical for this topic. The confidence
interval for the difference between the means was .50 to 3.50 indicating that the difference could be as
little as half a point, which is probably not a practically important difference, but it could also be as large
as three and a half points.
For research question 2, there was a statistically significant positive correlation between math courses
taken and math achievement r (48) =.30, p = .03. The positive correlation means that, in general,
students who took more math courses tended to score higher on the math achievement test and students
who did not take many math courses scored lower on math achievement. The effect size of r=.30 is
considered medium or typical for this area of research.
We will present examples of how to write about the results of the complex statistics discussed in this
book in the appropriate chapters. Note that measures of reliability (e.g., Cronbach alpha, discussed in
61

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
chapter 4) and principal components analysis (chapter 5) are usually discussed in the Methods section.
Chapters 6-10 present complex statistics that might be used to answer your complex research questions.
Conclusion
After the above review, you should be ready to study each of the complex statistics in Tables 3.3 and 3.4
and learn more about their computation and interpretation. Hopefully this review has brought you up to
speed. It would be wise for you to review this chapter, especially the tables and figures from time to time.
If you do, you will have a good grasp of how the various statistics fit together, when to use them, and
how to interpret the results. You will need this information to understand the chapters that follow.

CHAPTER 4
Several Measures of Reliability
This assignment illustrates several of the methods for computing instrument reliability.
Internal consistency reliability, for multiple item scales. In this assignment, we will compute the most
commonly used type of internal consistency reliability, Cronbach's coefficient alpha. This measure
indicates the consistency of a multiple item scale. Alpha is typically used when you have several Likert-
type items that are summed to make a composite score or sum mated scale. Alpha is based on the mean
or average correlation of each item in the scale with every other item. In the social science literature,
alpha is widely used, because it provides a measure of reliability that can be obtained from one testing
session or one administration of a questionnaire. In problems 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3, you compute alphas for
the three math attitude scales (motivation, competence, and pleasure) that items 1 to 14 were designed to
assess.
Reliability for one score/measure. In problem 4.4, you compute a correlation coefficient to check the
reliability of visualization scores. Several types of reliability can be illustrated by this correlation. If the
visualization retest was each participant's score from retaking the test a month or so after they initially
took it, then the correlation would be a measure of test-retest reliability. On the other hand, imagine that
visualization retest was a score on an alternative/parallel or equivalent version of the visualization test;
then this would be a measure of equivalent forms reliability. If two different raters scored the
visualization test and retest, the correlation could be used as an index ofinterrater reliability. This latter
type of reliability is needed when behaviors or answers to questions involve some degree of judgment
(e.g., when there are open-ended questions or ratings based on observations).
Reliability for nominal variables. There are several other methods of computing interrater or
interobserver reliability. Above, we mentioned using a correlation coefficient. In problem 4.5, Cohen's
kappa is used to assess interobserver agreement when the data are nominal.
Assumptions for Measures of Reliability
When two or more measures, items, or assessments are viewed as measuring the same variable, reliability can
be assessed. Reliability is used to indicate the extent to which the different items, measures, or assessments
are consistent with one another (hopefully, in measuring that variable) and the extent to which each measure
is free from measurement error. It is assumed that each item or score is composed of a true score measuring
the underlying construct, plus error because there is error in the measurement of anything. Therefore, one
assumption is that the measures or items will be related systematically to one another in a linear manner
because they are believed to be measures of the same construct. In addition, because true error should not be
correlated systematically with anything, a second assumption is that the errors (residual) for the different
measures or assessments are uncorrelated. If errors are correlated, this means that the residual is not simply
error; rather, the different measures not only have the proposed underlying variable in common, but they also
have something else systematic in common and reliability estimates may be inflated. An example of a
situation in which the assumption of uncorrelated errors might be violated would be when items all are parts
of a cognitive test that is timed. The performance features that are affected by timing the test, in addition to
the cognitive skills involved, might systematically affect responses to the items. The best way to determine
whether part of the reliability score is due to these extraneous variables is by doing multiple types of
reliability assessments (e.g., alternate forms and test-retest).
63

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
Conditions for Measures of Reliability
A condition that is necessary for measures of reliability is that all parts being used need to be comparable. If
you use split-half, then both halves of the test need to be equivalent. If you use alpha (which we demonstrate
in this chapter), then it is assumed that every item is measuring the same underlying construct. It is assumed
that respondents should answer similarly on the parts being compared, with any differences being due to
measurement error.

Problem 4.1: Cronbach's Alpha for the Motivation Scale
The motivation score is composed of six items that were rated on 4-point Likert scales, from very
atypical (1) to very typical (4). Do these items go together (interrelate) well enough to add them together
for future use as a composite variable labeled motivation*?
4.1. What is the internal consistency reliability of the math attitude scale that we labeled motivation!
Note that you do not actually use the computed motivation scale score. The Reliability program uses the
individual items to create the scale temporarily.

Let's do reliability analysis for the motivation scale. Click on Analyze => Scale => Reliability
Analysis. You should get a dialog box like Fig. 4.1.
â¢ 
Now move the variables itemOl, item04 reversed, itemOJ, itemOS reversed, item!2, and item!3 (the
motivation questions) to the Items box. Be sure to use item04 reversed and itemOS reversed (not
item04 and itemOS).

The average for the 6-item

Interpretation of Output 4.1
The first section lists the items (itemfl/, etc.) that you requested to be included in this scale and their labels.
Selecting List item labels in Fig. 4.1 produced it. Next is a table of descriptive statistics for each item,
produced by checking Item in Fig. 4.2. The third table is a matrix showing the inter-item correlations of
every item in the scale with every other item. The next table shows the number of participants with no
missing data on these variables (73), and three one-line tables providing summary descriptive statistics for
a) the Scale (sum of the six motivation items), b) the Item Means, produced under summaries, and c)
correlations, under summaries. The latter two tell you, for example, the average, minimum, and maximum
of the item means and of the inter-item correlations.
The final table, which we think is the most important, is produced if you check the Scale if item deleted
under Descriptives for in the dialog box displayed in Fig. 4.2. This table, labeled Item-total Statistics,
provides five pieces of information for each item in the scale. The two we find most useful are the
Corrected Item-Total Correlation and the Alpha if Item Deleted. The former is the correlation of each
specific item with the sum/total of the other items in the scale. If this correlation is moderately high or high,
say .40 or above, the item is probably at least moderately correlated with most of the other items and will
make a good component of this summated rating scale. Items with lower item-total correlations do not fit
into this scale as well, psychometrically. If the item-total correlation is negative or too low (less than .30), it
is wise to examine the item for wording problems and conceptual fit. You may want to modify or delete
such items. You can tell from the last column what the alpha would be if you deleted an item. Compare this
to the alpha for the scale with all six items included, which is given at the bottom of the output. Deleting a
poor item will usually make the alpha go up, but it will usually make only a small difference in the alpha,
unless the scale has only a few items (e.g., fewer than five) because alpha is based on the number of items
as well as their average intercorrelations.
In general, you will use the unstandardized alpha, unless the items in the scale have quite different means
and standard deviations. For example, if we were to make a summated scale from math achievement,
grades, and visualization, we would use the standardized alpha. As with other reliability coefficients, alpha
should be above .70; however, it is common to see journal articles where one or more scales have somewhat
lower alphas (e.g., in the .60-.69 range), especially if there are only a handful of items in the scale. A very
high alpha (e.g., greater than .90) probably means that the items are repetitious or that you have more items
in the scale than are really necessary for a reliable measure of the concept.
Example of How to Write About Problems 4.1
Method
To assess whether the six items that were summed to create the motivation score formed a reliable scale,
Cronbach's alpha was computed. The alpha for the six items was .79, which indicates that the items form a
scale that has reasonable internal consistency reliability. Similarly, the alpha for the competence scale (.80)
indicated good internal consistency, but the .69 alpha for the pleasure scale indicated minimally adequate
reliability.

Again, is it reasonable to add these items together to form summated measures of the concepts of
competence and pleasure*!
4.2. What is the internal consistency reliability of the competence scaled
4.3. What is the internal consistency reliability of the pleasure scale!
Let's repeat the same steps as before except check the reliability of the following scales and then

Interpretation of Output 4.4
The first table provides the descriptive statistics for the two variables, visualization test and visualization
retest. The second table indicates that the correlation of the two visualization scores is very high (r = .89)
so there is strong support for the test-retest reliability of the visualization score. This correlation is
significant,/? < .001, but we are not as concerned about the significance as we are having the correlation be
high.
Example of How to Write About Problem 4.4
Method
A Pearson's correlation was computed to assess test-retest reliability of the visualization test scores, r
(75) = .89. This indicates that there is good test-retest reliability.
Problem 4.5: Cohen's Kappa With Nominal Data
When we have two categorical variables with the same values (usually two raters' observations or scores
using the same codes), we can compute Cohen's kappa to check the reliability or agreement between the
measures. Cohen's kappa is preferable over simple percentage agreement because it corrects for the
probability that raters will agree due to chance alone. In the hsbdataB, the variable ethnicity is the
ethnicity of the student as reported in the school records. The variable ethnicity reported by student is the
ethnicity of the student reported by the student. Thus, we can compute Cohen's kappa to check the

Interpretation of Output 4.5
The Case Processing Summary table shows that 71 students have data on both variables, and 4 students
have missing data. The Cross tabulation table of ethnicity and ethnicity reported by student is next The
cases where the school records and the student agree are on the diagonal and circled. There are 65 (40 +11
+ 8 + 6) students with such agreement or consistency. The Symmetric Measures table shows that kappa =
.86, which is very good. Because kappa is a measure of reliability, it usually should be .70 or greater. It is
not enough to be significantly greater than zero. However, because it corrects for chance, it tends to be
somewhat lower than some other measures of interobserver reliability, such as percentage agreement.

Method
Cohen's kappa was computed to check the reliability of reports of student ethnicity by the student and
by school records. The resulting kappa of .86 indicates that both school records and students' reports
provide similar information about students' ethnicity.

CHAPTER 5
Exploratory Factor Analysis and Principal Components Analysis
Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and principal components analysis (PCA) both are methods that are
used to help investigators represent a large number of relationships among interval-level variables in a
simpler (more parsimonious) way. Both of these approaches allow the computer to determine which, of a
fairly large set of items, "hang together" as a group, or are answered most similarly by the participants. A
related approach, confirmatory factor analysis, in which one tests very specific models of how
variables are related to underlying constructs (conceptual variables), is beyond the scope of this book and
will not be discussed.
The primary difference, conceptually, between exploratory factor analysis and principal components
analysis is that in EFA. one postulates that there is a smaller set of unobserved (latent) variables or
constructs that underlie the variables that actually were observed or measured; whereas, in PCA. one is
simply trying to mathematically derive a relatively small number of variables to use to convey as much of
the information in the observed/measured variables as possible. In other words, EFA is directed at
understanding the relations among variables by understanding the constructs that underlie them, whereas
PCA is simply directed toward enabling one to use fewer variables to provide the same information that
one would obtain from a larger set of variables. There are actually a number of different ways of
computing factors for factor analysis; hi this chapter, we will only use one of these methods, principal
axis factor analysis (PA). We selected this approach because it is highly similar mathematically to PCA.
The primary difference, computationally, between PCA and PA is that in the former, the analysis
typically is performed on an ordinary correlation matrix, complete with the correlations of each item or
variable with itself, whereas in PA factor analysis, the correlation matrix is modified such that the
correlations of each item with itself are replaced with a "communality"âa measure of that item's
relation to all other items (usually a squared multiple correlation). Thus, PCA is trying to reproduce all
information (variance and covariance) associated with the set of variables, whereas PA factor analysis is
directed at understanding only the covariation among variables.
Conditions for Exploratory Factor Analysis and Principal Components Analysis
There are two main conditions necessary for factor analysis and principal components analysis. The first
is that there need to be relationships between the variables. Further, the larger the sample size, especially
in relation to the number of variables, the more reliable the resulting factors usually are. Sample size is
less crucial for factor analysis to the extent that the communalities of items with the other items are high,
or at least relatively high and variable. Ordinary principal axis factor analysis should never be done if the
number of items/variables is greater than the number of participants.
Assumptions for Exploratory Factor Analysis and Principal Components Analysis
The methods of extracting factors and components that are used in this book do not make strong
distributional assumptions; normality is important only to the extent that skewness or outliers affect the
observed correlations or if significance tests are performed (which is rare for EFA and PCA). The
normality of the distributions can be checked by computing the skewness statistic. Maximum likelihood
estimation, which we will not cover, does require multivariate normalityâthe variables need to be
normally distributed and the joint distribution of all the variables should be normal. Because both
principal axis factor analysis and principal components analysis are based on correlations, independent
sampling is required and the variables should be related to each other (in pairs) in a linear fashion. The
assumption of linearity can be assessed with matrix scatterplots, as shown in chapter 2. Finally, at least
76

Chapter 5 - Exploratory Factor Analysis and Principal Components Analysis
many of the variables should be correlated at a moderate level. Factor analysis and principal components
analysis are seeking to explain or reproduce the correlation matrix, which would not be a sensible thing
to do if the correlations all hover around zero. Bartlett's test of sphericity addresses this assumption.
Moreover, if correlations are too high, this may cause problems with obtaining a mathematical solution to
the factor analysis problem.

Problem 5.1: Factor Analysis on Math Attitude Variables
In Problem 5.1, we perform a principal axis factor analysis on the math attitude variables. Factor
analysis is more appropriate than PCA when one has the belief that there are latent variables underlying
the variables or items one measured. In this example, we have beliefs about the constructs underlying the
math attitude questions; we believe that there are three constructs: motivation, competence, and
pleasure. Now, we want to see if the items that were written to index each of these constructs actually do
"hang together." That is, we wish to determine empirically whether participants' responses to the
motivation questions are more similar to each other than to their responses to the competence items, and
so on. This is considered exploratory factor analysis even though we have some ideas about the structure
of the data because our hypotheses regarding the model are not very specific; we do not have specific
predictions about the size of the relation of each observed variable to each latent variable, etc.
5.1 Run a factor analysis using the principal axis factoring method and specify the number of factors to
be three (because our conceptualization is that there are three math attitude scales or factors:
motivation, competence, and pleasure).

Interpretation of Output 5.1
The factor analysis program generates a number of tables depending on which options you have chosen.
The first table in Output 5.1 is a correlation matrix showing how each of the 14 items is associated with
each of the other 13. Note that some of the correlations are high (e.g., + or - .60 or greater) and some are
low (i.e., near zero). The high correlations indicate that two items are associated and will probably be
grouped together by the factor analysis.
Next, several assumptions are tested. The determinant (located under the correlation matrix) should be
more than .00001. Here, it is .001 so this assumption is met. If the determinant is zero, then a factor
analytic solution can not be obtained, because this would require dividing by zero. This would mean that
at least one of the items can be understood as a linear combination of some set of the other items. The
Kaiser-Meyer-OIkin (KMO) measure should be greater than .70, and is inadequate if less than .50. The
KMO test tells one whether or not enough items are predicted by each factor. The Bartlett test should be
significant (i.e., a significance value of less than .05); this means that the variables are correlated highly
enough to provide a reasonable basis for factor analysis.
The Total Variance Explained table shows how the variance is divided among the 14 possible factors.
Note that four factors have eigenvalues (a measure of explained variance) greater than 1.0, which is a
common criterion for a factor to be useful. When the eigenvalue is less than 1.0, this means that the
factor explains less information than a single item would have explained. Most researchers would not
consider the information gained from such a factor to be sufficient to justify keeping that factor. Thus, if
you had not specified otherwise, the computer would have looked for the best four-factor solution by
"rotating" four factors. Because we specified that we wanted only three factors rotated, only three will
be rotated.
For this and all analyses in this chapter, we will use an orthogonal rotation (varimax). This means that
the final factors will be as uncorrelated as possible with each other. As a result, we can assume that the
information explained by one factor is independent of the information in the other factors. We rotate the
factors so that they are easier to interpret. Rotation makes it so that, as much as possible, different items
are explained or predicted by different underlying factors, and each factor explains more than one item.
This is a condition called simple structure. Although this is the goal of rotation, in reality, this is not
always achieved. One thing to look for in the Rotated Matrix of factor loadings is the extent to which
simple structure is achieved.
The Rotated Factor Matrix table, which contains these loadings, is key for understanding the results of
the analysis. Note that the computer has sorted the 14 math attitude questions (item 01 to item 14) into
three overlapping groups of items, each which has a loading of |.30| or higher (|.30| means the absolute
value, or value without considering the sign, is greater than .30). Actually, every item has some loading
from every factor, but there are blanks in the matrix where weights were less than |.30|. Within each
factor (to the extent possible), the items are sorted from the one with the highest factor weight or loading
82

Chapter 5 - Exploratory Factor Analysis and Principal Components Analysis
for that factor (i.e., item 05 for factor 1, with a loading of-.897) to the one with the lowest loading on
that first factor (item 07). Loadings resulting from an orthogonal rotation are correlation coefficients of
each item with the factor, so they range from -1.0 through 0 to + 1.0. A negative loading just means that
the question needs to be interpreted in the opposite direction from the way it is written for that factor
(e.g., item 05 "I am a little slow catching on to new topics in math" has a negative loading from the
competence factor, which indicates that the people scoring higher on this item are lower in competence).
Usually, factor loadings lower than |.30| are considered low, which is why we suppressed loadings less
than |.30|. On the other hand, loadings of |.40| or greater are typically considered high. This is just a
guideline, however, and one could set the criterion for "high" loadings as low as .30 or as high as .50.
Setting the criterion lower than .30 or higher than .50 would be very unusual.
The investigator should examine the content of the items that have high loadings from each factor to see
if they fit together conceptually and can be named. Items 5, 3, and 11 were intended to reflect a
perception of competence at math, so the fact that they all have strong loadings from the same factor
provides some support for their being conceptualized as pertaining to the same construct. On the other
hand, item 01 was intended to measure motivation for doing math, but it is highly related to this same
competence factor. In retrospect, one can see why this item could also be interpreted as competence. The
item reads, "I practice math skills until I can do them well." Unless one felt one could do math problems
well, this would not be true. Likewise, item 02," I feel happy after solving a hard problem," although
intended to measure pleasure at doing math (and having its strongest loading there), might also reflect
competence at doing math, in that again one could not endorse this item unless one had solved hard
problems, which one could only do if one were good at math. On the other hand, item09, which was
originally conceptualized as a competence item, had no really strong loadings. Item 77, as mentioned
earlier, had a high loading for the first factor, as expected. However, it also had a moderate loading for
Factor 3, which seems to be a (low) pleasure factor. This item reads, "I have some difficulties doing math
as well as other kids my age." Can you think of why this might be related to low pleasure?
Every item has a weight or loading from every factor, but in a "clean" factor analysis almost all of the
loadings that are not in the circles that we have drawn on the Rotated Factor Matrix will be low (blank
or less than |.40|). The fact that both Factors 1 and 3 load highly on item 02 and fairly highly on item 77,
and the fact that Factors 1 and 2 both load highly on item 07 is common but undesirable, in that one
wants only one factor to predict each item.
Example of How to Write About Problem 5.1
Results
Principal axis factor analysis with varimax rotation was conducted to assess the underlying structure
for the fourteen items of the Math Motivation Questionnaire. Three factors were requested, based on the
fact that the items were designed to index three constructs: motivation, competence, and pleasure. After
rotation, the first factor accounted for 21.5% of the variance, the second factor accounted for 16.6%, and
the third factor accounted for 12.7%. Table 5.1 displays the items and factor loadings for the rotated
factors, with loadings less than .40 omitted to improve clarity.

Note. Loadings < .40 are omitted.
The first factor, which seems to index competence, loads most strongly on the first four items, with
loadings in the first column. Two of the items indexed low competence and had negative loadings. The
second factor, which seemed to index motivation, was composed of the five items with loadings in
column 2 of the table. "I prefer to figure out the problem without help" had its highest loading on the
second factor, but had a cross-loading over .4 on the competence factor. The third factor, which seemed
to index (low) pleasure from math, comprised the four items with loadings in the third column. "I feel
happy after solving a hard problem" had its highest loading from the pleasure factor, but also had a
strong loading from the competence factor.
Problem 5.2: Principal Components Analysis on Achievement Variables
Principal components analysis is most useful if one simply wants to reduce a relatively large number of
variables into a smaller set of variables that still captures the same information.

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
Interpretation of Output 5.2
Compare Output 5.2 to your output and syntax in Output 5.1. Note that in addition to the tables in Output
5.1 you have: (a) a table of Descriptive Statistics for each variable, which also provides the listwise
Analysis N, in this case 75; (b) a Scree Plot; (c) an unrelated Component Matrix, which should not be
interpreted (however, if you want to compute only one variable that provides the most information about
the set of variables, a linear combination of the variables with high loadings from the first unrotated
component matrix would be used); (d) a Rotated Component Matrix, which contains the loadings for
each component, in a manner comparable to those for the rotated factor matrix in 5.1; and (e) the
Component Plot of the component loadings.
Both the Scree Plot and the eigenvalues support the conclusion that these five variables can be reduced
to two components. However, the second component is a weak one. Note that the scree plot flattens out
after the second component.
Note that the default setting we used does not sort the variables in the Rotated Component Matrix by
magnitude of loadings and does not suppress low loadings. Thus, you have to organize the table yourself;
that is, math achievement, scholastic aptitude test, grades in h.s., and visualization in that order have
high Component 1 loadings, and mosaic is the only variable with a high loading for Component 2.
Researchers usually give names to a component in a fashion similar to that used in EFA; however, there
is no assumption that this indicates a variable that underlies the measured items. Often, a researcher will
aggregate (add or average) the items that define (have high loadings for) each component, and use this
composite variable in further research. Actually, the same thing is often done with EFA factor loadings;
however, the implication of the latter is that this composite variable is an index of the underlying
construct.
The plot of the component loadings gives one a visual representation of the loadings, plotted in space.
This shows how closely related the items are to each other and to the components.
Interpretation Questions

CHAPTER 6
Multiple Regression
Multiple regression is one type of complex associational statistical method. Already, we have done
assignments using another complex associational method, Cronbach's alpha, which, like multiple
regression, is based on a correlation matrix of all the variables to be considered in a problem. In addition
to multiple regression, two other complex associational analyses, logistic regression and discriminant
analysis will be computed in the next chapter. Like multiple regression, logistic regression and
discriminant analysis have the general purpose of predicting a dependent or criterion variable from
several independent or predictor variables. As you can tell from examining Table 3.4 (p. 50), these three
techniques for predicting one outcome measure from several independent variables vary in the level of
measurement and type of independent variables and/or type of outcome variable.
For multiple regression, the dependent or outcome variable should be an interval or scale level variable,
which is normally distributed in the population from which it is drawn. The independent variables should
be mostly interval or scale level variables, but multiple regression can also have dichotomous
independent variables, which are called dummy variables. Dummy variables are often nominal
categories that have been given numerical codes, usually 1 and 0. The 0 stands for whatever the 1 is not,
and is thus said to be "dumb" or silent. Thus, when we use gender, for instance, as a dummy variable in
multiple regression, we're really coding it as 1 = female and 0 = not female (i.e., male). This gets
complex when there are more than two nominal categories. In that case, we need to convert the multiple
category variable to a set of dichotomous variables indicating presence versus absence of the categories.
For example, if we were to use the ethnic group variable, we would have to code it into several
dichotomous dummy variables such as Euro-American and not Euro-American, African-American and
not African-American, and Latino-American and not Latino-American.
Assumptions of Multiple Linear Regression
There are many assumptions to consider but we will focus on the major ones that are easily tested with
SPSS. The assumptions for multiple regression include the following: that the relationship between each
of the predictor variables and the dependent variable is linear and that the error, or residual, is normally
distributed and uncorrelated with the predictors. A condition that can be extremely problematic as well is
multicollinearity, which can lead to misleading and/or inaccurate results. Multicollinearity (or
collinearity) occurs when there are high intercorrelations among some set of the predictor variables. In
other words, multicollinearity happens when two or more predictors contain much of the same
information.
Although a correlation matrix indicating the intercorrelations among all pairs of predictors is helpful in
determining whether multicollinearity is a problem, it will not always indicate that the condition exists.
Multicollinearity may occur because several predictors, taken together, are related to some other
predictors or set of predictors. For this reason, it is important to test for multicollinearity when doing
multiple regression.
There are several different ways of computing multiple regression that are used under somewhat different
circumstances. We will have you use several of these approaches, so that you will be able to see that the
method one uses to compute multiple regression influences the information one obtains from the
analysis. If the researcher has no prior ideas about which variables will create the best prediction
equation and has a reasonably small set of predictors, then simultaneous regression is the best method
90

Chapter 6 - Multiple Regression
to use. It is preferable to use the hierarchical method when one has an idea about the order in which
one wants to enter predictors and wants to know how prediction by certain variables improves on
prediction by others. Hierarchical regression appropriately corrects for capitalization on chance;
whereas, stepwise, another method available in SPSS in which variables are entered sequentially, does
not. Both simultaneous regression and hierarchical regression require that you specify exactly which
variables serve as predictors. Sometimes you have a relatively large set of variables that may be good
predictors of the dependent variable, but you cannot enter such a large set of variables without sacrificing
the power to find significant results. In such a case, stepwise regression might be used. However, as
indicated earlier, stepwise regression capitalizes on chance more than many researchers find acceptable.

Problem 6.1: Using the Simultaneous Method to
Compute Multiple Regression
To reiterate, the purpose of multiple regression is to predict an interval (or scale) dependent variable
from a combination of several interval/scale, and/or dichotomous independent/predictor variables. In the
following assignment, we will see if math achievement can be predicted better from a combination of
several of our other variables, such as the motivation scale, grades in high school, and mother's and
father's education. In Problems 6.1 and 6.3, we will run the multiple regression using alternate methods
provided by SPSS. In Problem 6.1, we will assume that all seven of the predictor variables are important
and that we want to see what is the highest possible multiple correlation of these variables with the
dependent variable. For this purpose, we will use the method that SPSS calls Enter (often called
simultaneous regression), which tells the computer to consider all the variables at the same time. In
Problem 6.3, we will use the hierarchical method.
6.1. How well can you predict math achievement from a combination of seven variables: motivation,
competence,pleasure, grades in high school, father's education, mother's education, andgendert
In this problem, the computer will enter/consider all the variables at the same time. Also, we will ask
which of these seven predictors contribute significantly to the multiple correlation/regression.
It is a good idea to check the correlations among the predictor variables prior to running the multiple
regression, to determine if the predictors are sufficiently correlated such that multicollinearity is highly
likely to be a problem. This is especially important to do when one is using a relatively large set of
predictors, and/or if, for empirical or conceptual reasons, one believes that some or all of the predictors
might be highly correlated. If variables are highly correlated (e.g., correlated at .50 or .60 and above),
then one might decide to combine (aggregate) them into a composite variable or eliminate one or more of
the highly correlated variables if the variables do not make a meaningful composite variable. For this
example, we will check correlations between the variables to see if there might be multicollinearity
problems. We typically also would create a scatterplot matrix to check the assumption of linear
relationships of each predictor with the dependent variable and a scatterplot between the predictive
equation and the residual to check for the assumption that these are uncorrelated. In this problem, we will
not do so because we will show you how to do these assumption checks in Problem 6.2.

The correlation matrix indicates large correlations between motivation and competence and between
mother's education and father's education. To deal with this problem, we would usually aggregate or
eliminate variables that are highly correlated. However, we want to show how the collinearity problems
created by these highly correlated predictors affect the Tolerance values and the significance of the beta
coefficients, so we will run the regression without altering the variables. To run the regression, follow the

a Dependent Variable: math achievement test
Only grades and gender are significantly contributing to

us if there is multicollinearity. If the
Tolerance value is low (< 1-R2), then there is
probably a problem with multicollinearity. In
this case, since adjusted R2 is .36, and 1- R2
is about .64, then tolerances are low for
competence, mother's and father's

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
Interpretation of Output 6.1
First, the output provides the usual descriptive statistics for all eight variables. Note that the N is 69
because 6 participants are missing a score on one or more variables. Multiple regression uses only the
participants who have complete data for all the variables. The next table is a correlation matrix similar to
the one in Output 6. la. Note that the first column shows the correlations of the other variables with math
achievement and that motivation, competence, grades in high school, father's education, mother's
education, and gender are all significantly correlated with math achievement. As we observed before,
several of the predictor/ independent variables are highly correlated with each other; that is, competence
and motivation (.517) and mother's education and father's education (.649).
The Model Summary table shows that the multiple correlation coefficient (R), using all the predictors
simultaneously, is .65 (R2 = .43) and the adjusted R2 is .36, meaning that 36% of the variance in math
achievement can be predicted from gender, competence, etc. combined. Note that the adjusted jR
2 is lower
than the unadjusted /f2. This is, in part, related to the number of variables in the equation. The adjustment
is also affected by the magnitude of the effect and the sample size. As you will see from the coefficients
table, only father's education and gender are significant, but the other five variables will always add a
little to the prediction of math achievement. Because so many independent variables were used, a
reduction in the number of variables might help us find an equation that explains more of the variance in
the dependent variable. It is helpful to use the concept of parsimony with multiple regression, and use
the smallest number of predictors needed.
The ANOVA table shows that Fâ 6.51 and is significant. This indicates that the combination of the
predictors significantly predict math achievement.
One of the most important tables is the Coefficients table. It indicates the standardized beta
coefficients, which are interpreted similarly to correlation coefficients or factor weights (see chapter 4).
The t value and the Sig opposite each independent variable indicates whether that variable is significantly
contributing to the equation for predicting math achievement from the whole set of predictors. Thus, h.s.
grades and gender, in this example, are the only variables that are significantly adding anything to the
prediction when the other five variables are already considered. It is important to note that all the
variables are being considered together when these values are computed. Therefore, if you delete one of
the predictors that is not significant, it can affect the levels of significance for other predictors.
However, as the Tolerances in the Coefficients table suggest, and as we will see in Problem 6.2, these
results are somewhat misleading. Although the two parent education measures were significantly
correlated with math achievement, they did not contribute to the multiple regression predicting math
achievement. What has happened here is that these two measures were also highly correlated with each
other, and multiple regression eliminates all overlap between predictors. Thus, neither father's education
nor mother's education had much to contribute when the other was also used as a predictor. Note that
tolerance for each of these variables is < .64 (1-.36), indicating that too much multicollinearity (overlap
between predictors) exists. The same is true for competence, once motivation is entered. One way to
handle multicollinearity is to combine variables that are highly related if that makes conceptual sense.
For example, you could make a new variable called parents' education, as we will for Problem 6.2.
Problem 6.2: Simultaneous Regression Correcting Multicollinearity
In Problem 6.2, we will use the combined/average of the two variables, mother's education and father's
education, and then recompute the multiple regression, after omitting competence and pleasure.
96

Chapter 6 - Multiple Regression
We combined father's education and mother's education because it makes conceptual sense and because
these two variables are quite highly related (r = .65). We know that entering them as two separate
variables created problems with multicollinearity because tolerance levels were low for these two
variables, and, despite the fact that both variables were significantly and substantially correlated with
math achievement, neither contributed significantly to predicting math achievement when taken together.
When it does not make sense to combine the highly correlated variables, one can eliminate one or more
of them. Because the conceptual distinction between motivation, competence, and pleasure was
important for us, and because motivation was more important to us than competence or pleasure, we
decided to delete the latter two scales from the analysis. We wanted to see if motivation would
contribute to the prediction of math achievement if its contribution was not canceled out by competence
and/or pleasure. Motivation and competence are so highly correlated that they create problems with
multicollinearity. We eliminate pleasure as well, even though its tolerance is acceptable, because it is
virtually uncorrelated with math achievement, the dependent variable, and yet it is correlated with
motivation and competence. Thus, it is unlikely to contribute meaningfully to the prediction of math
achievement, and its inclusion would only serve to reduce power and potentially reduce the predictive
power of motivation. It would be particularly important to eliminate a variable such as pleasure if it were
strongly correlated with another predictor, as this can lead to particularly misleading results.
6.2. Rerun Problem 6.1 using the parents' education variable (parEduc) instead offaed and maed and
omitting the competence and pleasure scales.
First, we created a matrix scatterplot (as in chapter 2) to see if the variables are related to each other in a

If the dots created a pattern, this would
indicate the residuals are not normally
distributed, the residual is correlated with
the independent variables, and/or the
variances of the residuals are not constant.
Because the dots are
scattered, it indicates the
data meet the assumptions
of the errors being
normally distributed and
the variances of the
residuals being constant.
102

Chapter 6 - Multiple Regression
Interpretation of Output 6.2
This output begins with the scatterplot matrix, which shows that the independent variables are generally
linearly related to the dependent variable of math achievement, meeting this assumption. One should
check the matrix scatterplots to see if there are curvilinear relationships between any of the variables; in
this example, there are none. If the variables had not met this assumption, we could have transformed
them, aggregated some, and/or eliminated some independent variables. (See chapter 2 for how to do
transformations.) There are also only low to moderate relationships among the predictor variables in the
Correlations table. This is good. The other assumptions are checked in the residual scatterplot at the
end of the output, which indicates that the errors are normally distributed, the variances of the residuals
are constant, and the residual is relatively uncorrelated with the linear combination of predictors.
The next important part of the output to check is the Tolerance and VIF values in the Coefficients table
for the existence of multicollinearity. In this example, we do not need to worry about multicollinearity
because the Tolerance values are close to 1.
The Model Summary table gives the R (.68) and Adjusted R square (.43). Thus, this model is
predicting 43% of the variance hi math achievement. If we want to compare this model to that in
Problem 6.1, we use the Adjusted R square to see which model is explaining more of the variance in the
dependent variable. Interestingly, this model is predicting more of the variance in math achievement than
the model in Problem 6.1, despite using fewer predictors.
As can be seen from the ANOVA table, the model of motivation, grades in h.s., parents' education, and
gender significantly predicts math achievement, F (4, 68) = 14.44,/? < .001.
We can see from the Coefficients table that now all of the predictors are significantly contributing to the
equation (see the Sig. column).
How to Write About Output 6.2
Results
Multiple regression was conducted to determine the best linear combination of gender, grades in h.s.,
parents' education, and motivation for predicting math achievement test scores. The means, standard
deviations, and intercorrelations can be found in Table 6.1. This combination of variables significantly
predicted math achievement, F(4,68) = 14.44,/? < .001, with all four variables significantly contributing
to the prediction. The beta weights, presented in Table 6.2, suggest that good grades in high school
contribute most to predicting math achievement, and that being male, having high math motivation and
having parents who are more highly educated also contribute to this prediction. The adjusted R squared
value was .43. This indicates that 43% of the variance in math achievement was explained by the model.
According to Cohen (1988), this is a large effect.

Problem 6.3: Hierarchical Multiple Linear Regression
In Problem 6.3, we will use the hierarchical approach, which enters variables in a series of blocks or
groups, enabling the researcher to see if each new group of variables adds anything to the prediction
produced by the previous blocks of variables. This approach is an appropriate method to use when the
researcher has a priori ideas about how the predictors go together to predict the dependent variable. In
our example, we will enter gender first and then see if any of the other variables make an additional
contribution. This method is intended to control for or eliminate the effects of gender on the prediction.
6.3. If we control for gender differences in math achievement, do any of the other variables significantly
add anything to the prediction over and above what gender contributes?
104

Chapter 6 - Multiple Regression
We will include all of the variables from the previous problem; however, this time we will enter the
variables in two separate blocks to see how motivation, grades in high school, and parents' education
improve on prediction from gender alone.

Interpretation of Output 6.3
We did not need to recheck the assumptions for this problem, because we checked them in Problem 6.2
with the same variables.
The Descriptives and Correlations tables would have been the same as those in Problem 6.2 if we had
checked the Descriptive box in the Statistics window.
The other tables in this output are somewhat different than the previous two outputs. This difference is
because we entered the variables in two steps. Therefore, this output has two models listed, Model 1 and
Model 2. The information in Model 1 is for gender predicting math achievement. The information in
Model 2 is gender plus motivation, grades in h.s., and parents' education predicting math achievement.
We can see from the ANOVA table that when gender is entered by itself, it is a significant
predictor of math achievement, F(l,71) = 7.16, p- .009; however, the model with the addition of the
other predictor variables is a better model for predicting math achievement F(4,68) = 14.44, p < .001.
That Model 2 is better than Model 1 can also be seen in the Model Summary table by the increase in the
adjusted tf value from R2 = .08 to an R2 = .43, F(3, 83) = 15.42,p < .001.
Note also that results for the final model, with all of the variables entered, is identical to the model in
Problem 6.2. No matter how they are entered, the same regression coefficients are selected to produce
the best model with the same set of predictors and the same dependent variable.

CHAPTER 7
Logistic Regression and Discriminant Analysis
Logistic regression and discriminant analysis, like multiple regression, are useful when you want to
predict an outcome or dependent variable from a set of predictor variables. They are similar to a linear
regression in many ways. However, logistic regression and discriminant analysis are more appropriate
when the dependent variable is categorical. Logistic regression is useful because it does not rely on some
of the assumptions on which multiple regression and discriminant analysis are based. As with other
forms of regression, multicollinearity (high correlations among the predictors) can lead to problems for
both logistic and discriminant analysis.
Logistic regression is helpful when you want to predict a categorical variable from a set of predictor
variables. Binary logistic regression is similar to linear regression except that it is used when the
dependent variable is dichotomous. Multinomial logistic regression is used when the
dependent/outcome variable has more than two categories, but that is complex and less common, so we
will not discuss it here. Logistic regression also is useful when some or all of the independent variables
are dichotomous; others can be continuous.
Discriminant analysis, on the other hand, is useful when you have several continuous independent
variables and, as in logistic regression, an outcome or dependent variable that is categorical. The
dependent variable can have more than two categories. If so, then more than one discriminant function
will be generated (number of functions = number of levels of the dependent variable minus 1). For the
sake of simplicity, we will limit our discussion to the case of a dichotomous dependent variable here.
Discriminant analysis is useful when you want to build a predictive model of group membership based on
several observed characteristics of each participant. SPSS can create a linear combination of the predictor
variables that provides the best discrimination between the groups.
In Problems 7.1 and 7.2, we will use logistic regression to predict a dichotomous outcome (whether or
not students will take algebra 2) from continuous and dichotomous predictors. In Problem 7.1, we will
enter all four predictors simultaneously into the equation. This is similar to the first multiple regression
problem in chapter 6. In Problem 7.2, we use a hierarchical approach, in which blocks of variables are
entered sequentially. In Problem 7.3, we will use discriminant analysis to do the same problem that we
did with logistic regression in Problem 7.1 in order to compare the two techniques.

Problem 7.1: Logistic Regression
Assumptions of logistic regression
There are fewer assumptions for logistic regression than for multiple regression and discriminant
analysis, which is one reason this technique has become popular, especially in health related fields.
Binary logistic regression assumes that the dependent or outcome variable is dichotomous and, like most
other statistics, that the outcomes are independent and mutually exclusive; that is, a single case can only
be represented once and must be in one group or the other. Finally, logistic regression requires large
samples to be accurate: Some say there should be a minimum of 20 cases per predictor, with a minimum
of 60 total cases. These requirements need to be satisfied prior to doing statistical analysis with SPSS. As
109

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
with multiple regression, multicollinearity is a potential source of confusing or misleading results and
needs to be assessed.
7.1. Is there a combination of gender, parents' education, mosaic, and visualization test that predicts
whether students will take algebra 21
Let's try a logistic regression to predict a dichotomous (two category) dependent variable when the
independent variables (called covariates in SPSS) are either dichotomous or normal/scale.
First, we should check for multicollinearity. Because tolerance and VIF scores are not available through
the logistic regression command, one way to compute these values is through the linear regression
command, using algebra 2 as the dependent variable and gender, mosaic, visualization test, and parents'
education as independent variables. If you did this, you would find that the tolerance statistics are all
above .87 so there is little multicollinearity. (See chapter 6 for how to do this.)
Use these commands to compute the logistic regression:
â¢ 
Analyze => Regression => Binary Logistic to get to Fig. 7.1.

Move algebra 2 in h.s. into the Dependent variable box.
â¢

Make sure Enter is the selected Method. (This enters all the variables in the covariates box into the
logistic regression equation simultaneously.)

a Variable(s) entered on step 1: GENDER, MOSAIC, VISUAL, PAREDUC.
Interpretation of Output 7.1
There are three main parts to this output. First, two tables provide descriptive information (see callout
boxes). Next, there are three tables in Block 0 that provide information about the baseline situation,
when only the constant is in the equation or model. That is, how well can we predict algebra 2 without
using gender, parents' education, mosaic, or visualization test, if we predicted that all the students would
not take algebra 2? The last section of four tables is below Block 1. They show the results when the
four predictors are entered simultaneously.
The first table under Block 0, the initial Classification Table, shows the percentage of correct
predictions (53%) if all of the students were predicted to be in the larger (algebra 2 not taken) group.
The first Variables in the Equation table shows that if you predicted that all students would not take
algebra 2, the odds of successful prediction would not be significantly different from 50-50 (i.e., no
better than chance).
The Variables not in the Equation table shows that three of the four variables (gender, parents'
education, and visualization test) are, individually, significant predictors of whether a student would take
algebra 2 or not. Mosaic is not a significant predictor.
Logistic regression in SPSS provides several ways to interpret the results of using these four variables
(gender, parents' education, mosaic and visualization test) as predictors of whether or not students took
algebra 2. The last four tables in Output 7.1 show these several ways. The Omnibus Tests of Model
Coefficients table indicates that, when we consider all four predictors together, the Model or equation is
significant Qt2 = 24.23, df= 4, N= 75,p < .001).
113

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
The Model Summary table includes two different ways of estimating R2 (percent of variance accounted
for) as was done in multiple regression. These "pseudo" B2 estimates (.28 and .37) indicate that
approximately 28% or 37% of the variance in whether or not students took algebra 2 can be predicted
from the linear combination of the four independent variables. The Cox & Snell R2 (28%) is usually an
underestimate.
The final Classification Table indicates how well the combination of variables predicts algebra 2. In
this problem we have tried to predict, from four other variables, whether or not students would take
algebra 2. Note from the classification table that, overall, 77% of the participants were predicted
correctly. The independent/covariate variables were better at helping us predict who would not take
algebra 2 (83% correct) than at who would take it (71% correct).
Note, in the Variables in the Equation table, that only parents' education and visualization test are
significant. Gender is not significant, which is probably due to several factors: 1) the fact that SE is quite
high relative to B, which makes the Wald statistic lower, 2) the fact that gender is dichotomous, and 3)
the fact that in this sample, gender is modestly (.25 and .28) but significantly related to visualization test
and parents' education, so when they are already included, gender does not add enough to be significant
(p = .389). Note that Exp(B) gives the odds ratios for each variable. The odds ratio and confidence
interval for parents' education was 1.46 (95% CI = 1.13-1.89) and for visualization test was 1.21 (CI =
1.04-1.4). These indicate that the odds of estimating correctly who takes algebra 2 improve by 46%
(1.46-1) if one knows parents' education and by about 21% if one knows the visualization test score.
Example of How to Write About Problem 7.1
Results
Logistic regression was conducted to assess whether the four predictor variables, gender, parents'
education, mosaic pattern test, and visualization test, significantly predicted whether or not a student took
algebra 2. When all four predictor variables are considered together, they significantly predict whether or
not a student took algebra 2, % 2 = 24.23, df= 4,N=15,p< .001. Table 7.1 presents the odds ratios,
which suggest that the odds of estimating correctly who takes algebra 2 improve by 46% if one knows
parents' education and by about 21% if one knows students' visualization scores.

a. Variable(s) entered on step 1: MOSAIC, VISUAL.
Interpretation of Output 7.2
The first four tables are the same as in Output 7.1. In this case, we have an additional step or block.
Block 1 shows the Omnibus Chi-Square, Model Summary, Classification Table, and Variables in
the Equation when gender and parents' education were entered as covariates. Note that the Omnibus
o
Test is statistically significant (x = 16.11, /? < .001). With only gender and parents' education
entered, overall we can predict correctly 71% of the cases. Note from the last table in Block 1, that
gender is not significant (p = .100) when it said parents' education are both in the equation.
In Block 2, we entered mosaic and visualization test to see if they would add to the predictive power of
2
gender and parents' education. They do, as indicated by the Step in the Omnibus Tests table (% =
8.12, p = .017). Note hi the same table that the overall Model (% 2 = 24.23, p < .001) with all four
predictors entered is significant. In this example, there is only one step in each block so the four tables
in Block 2 all say Step 1. The last three tables, as would be expected, are the same as those from
Problem 7.1.
Problem 7.3: Discriminant Analysis (DA)
Discriminant analysis is appropriate when you want to predict which group (in this example, who took
algebra 2) participants will be in. The procedure produces a discriminant function (or for more than two
groups, a set of discriminant functions) based on linear combinations of the predictor variables that
provide the best overall discrimination among the groups. The grouping or dependent variable can have
more than two values, but this will greatly increase the complexity of the output and interpretation. The
118

Chapter 7 - Logistic Regression and Discriminant Analysis
codes for the grouping variable must be integers. You need to specify their minimum and maximum
values, as we will in Fig. 7.3. Cases with values outside these bounds are excluded from the analysis.
Discriminant analysis (DA) is similar to multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA, discussed in
chapter 10), except that the independent and dependent variables are switched; thus, the conceptual basis
for the study is typically different. In DA, one is trying to devise one or more predictive equations to
maximally discriminate people in one group from those in another group; in MANOVA, one is trying to
determine whether group members differ significantly on a set of several measures. The assumptions for
DA are similar to those for MANOVA.
Assumptions of Discriminant Analysis
The assumptions of discriminant analysis include that the relationships between all pairs of predictors
must be linear, multivariate normality must exist within groups, and the population covariance matrices
for predictor variables must be equal across groups. Discriminant analysis is, however, fairly robust to
these assumptions, although violations of multivariate normality may affect accuracy of estimates of the
probability of correct classification. If multivariate nonnormality is suspected, then logistic regression
should be used. Multicollinearity is again an issue with which you need to be concerned. It is also
important that the sample size of the smallest group (35 in this example) exceed the number of predictor
variables in the model (there are four in this example, so this assumption is met). The linearity
assumption as well as the assumption of homogeneity of variance-covariance matrices can be tested, as
we did for multiple regression in chapter 6, by examining a matrix scatterplot. If the spreads of the
scatterplots are roughly equal, then the assumption of homogeneity of variance-covariance matrices can
be assumed. This assumption can also be tested with Box's M.
7.3 What combination of gender, parents' education, mosaic, and visualization test best distinguishes
students who will take algebra 2 from those who do not?
This is a similar question to the one that we asked in Problem 7.1, but this time we will use discriminant
analysis, so the way of thinking about the problem is a little different.
You can use discriminant analysis instead of logistic regression when you have a categorical outcome or
grouping variable, if you have all continuous independent variables. It is best not to use dichotomous
predictors for discriminant analysis, except when the dependent variable has a nearly 50-50 split as is
true in this case.
We created scatterplots (below) after splitting the data by the grouping variable (in this case algebra 2 in
h.s.) so we could check the assumption of homogeneity of variance-covariance matrices across groups.
To split the file into groups, use Split File. See the Quick Reference Guide (Appendix A) if you need
assistance. Then do a scatterplot, selecting "matrix," as shown in chapter 5, with gender, parents'
education, mosaic, and visualization test as the variables. Don't forget to turn off the split file command
before you run other analyses.

This indicates that the assumption of homogeneity of

to this test. However, this test is strongly influenced
by nonnormality and may not be accurate. We
checked this assumption with matrix scatterplots for
each group, and these suggested the assumption was
not badly violated. We could use logistic regression
instead of discriminant analysis if we are concerned
about the degree to which we met this assumption.

a(76.0Â°/) of original grouped cases correctly classified.
This shows how well the
model predicts who will
take algebra 2. For
example, 80% of those who
did not take algebra 2 were
correctly predicted.
Interpretation of Output 7.3
The Group Statistics table provides basic descriptive statistics for each of the independent/ predictor
variables for each outcome group (didn't take algebra 2 and did take it) separately and for the whole
sample. The Tests of Equality of Group Means table shows which independent variables are significant
predictors by themselves; it shows the variables with which there is a statistically significant difference
between those who took algebra 2 and those who didn't. As was the case when we used logistic
regression, gender, parents' education, and visualization test are statistically significant.
Note, from the Standardized Canonical Discriminant Function Coefficients table, that only parents'
education and visualization test are weighted heavily to maximize the discrimination between groups.
Because gender correlates with parents' education, it has a low function coefficient. But in the
Structure Matrix table, gender has a higher (-.45) correlation because it is correlated with the
discriminant function that best predicts who took algebra 2 and who did not.
The last table is similar to the classification table for logistic regression. It shows how well the
combination of four independent variables classifies or predicts who will take algebra 2. Note that
overall, 76% of the sample was classified correctly. As with logistic regression, discriminant analysis did
better at predicting who did not take algebra 2 (80% correct) than it did at predicting who would take it
(71% correct).
Example of How to Write About Problem 7.3
Results
Discriminant analysis was conducted to assess whether the four predictors, gender, parents'
education, mosaic, and visualization test, could distinguish those who took algebra 2 from those who did
not. Wilks' lambda was significant, A, = .71, %
2 = 24.69, p< .001, which indicates that the model
including these four variables was able to significantly discriminate the two groups. Table 7.3 presents
the standardized function coefficients, which suggest that parents' education and the visualization test
contribute most to distinguishing those who took algebra 2 from those who did not, using these
predictors. The classification results show that the model correctly predicts 80% of those who did not
take algebra 2 and 71% of those who did take algebra 2. The correlation coefficients hi the table indicate
the extent to which each variable correlates with the resulting discriminant function. Note that even
though mosaic didn't contribute strongly to the discriminant function, it is moderately highly
(negatively) correlated with the overall discriminant function.

CHAPTER 8
Factorial ANOVA and ANCOVA
In this chapter, we will introduce two complex difference statistics: factorial ANOVA and ANCOVA.
Both factorial ANOVA and ANCOVA tell you whether considering more than one independent variable
at a time gives you additional information over and above what you would get if you did the appropriate
basic inferential statistics for each independent variable separately. Both of these inferential statistics
have two or more independent variables and one scale (normally distributed) dependent variable.
Factorial ANOVA is used when there is a small number of independent variables (usually two or three)
and each of these variables has a small number of levels or categories (usually two to four).
ANCOVA typically is used to adjust or control for differences between the groups based on another,
typically interval level, variable called the covariate. For example, imagine that we found that boys and
girls differ on math achievement. However, this could be due to the fact that boys take more math
courses in high school. ANCOVA allows us to adjust the math achievement scores based on the
relationship between number of math courses taken and math achievement. We can then determine if
boys and girls still have different math achievement scores after making the adjustment. ANCOVA can
also be used if one wants to use one or more discrete or nominal variables and one or two continuous
variables to predict differences in one dependent variable.

Retrieve hsbdataB from your data file.
Problem 8.1: Factorial (2-Way) ANOVA
We would use a t test or one-way ANOVA to examine differences on a scale dependent variable between
two or more groups comprising the levels of one independent variable or factor. These designs, in which
there is only one independent variable, and it is a discrete or categorical variable, are called single factor
designs. In this problem, we will compare groups formed by combining two independent variables. The
appropriate statistic for this type of problem is called a two factor, 2-way, or factorial ANOVA. One
can also have factorial ANOVAs in which there are more than two independent variables. If there are
three independent variables, one would have a three factor or 3-way ANOVA. It is unusual, but possible,
to have more than three factors as well. Factorial ANOVA is used when there are two or more
independent variables (each with a few categories or values) and a between groups design.
Assumptions of Factorial ANOVA
The assumptions for factorial ANOVA are that the observations are independent, the variances of the
groups are equal (homogeneity of variances), and the dependent variable is normally distributed for each
group. Assessing whether the observations are independent (i.e., each participant's score is not related
systematically to any other participants)'s score) is a design issue that should be evaluated prior to
entering the data into SPSS. To test the assumption of homogeneity of variances, SPSS computes the
Levene Statistic, which can be requested using the General Linear Model command. We will demonstrate
it below. Factorial ANOVA is robust against violations of the assumption of the normal distributions of
the dependent variable. One way to test this assumption is to compare box plots of the dependent variable
for each group (cell) defined by each combination of the levels of the independent variables.
8.1 Are there differences in math achievement for people varying on math grades and/or father's
education revised, and is there a significant interaction between math grades and father's education
on math achievement? (Another way to ask this latter question: Do the "effects" of math grades on
math achievement vary depending on level of father's education revised?)

Chapter 8 - Factorial ANOVA and ANCOVA
Interpretation of Output 8.1
The GLM Univariate program allows you to print the means and counts, provides measures of effect
size (eta), and plots the interaction, which is helpful in interpreting it. The first table in Output 8.1 shows
that 73 participants (43 with low math grades and 30 high math grades) are included in the analysis
because they had data on all of the variables. The second table, Descriptive Statistics, shows the cell
and marginal (total) means; both are very important for interpreting the ANOVA table and explaining the
results of the test for the interaction.
The ANOVA table, called Tests of Between Subjects Effects, is the key table. Note that the word
"effect" in the title of the table can be misleading because this study was not a randomized experiment.
Thus, you should not report that the differences in the dependent variable were caused by the
independent variable. Usually you will ignore the information about the corrected model and intercept
and skip down to the interaction F (mathgr*faedRevis). It is important to look at the interaction first
because it may change the interpretation of the separate "main effects" of each independent variable.
In this case, the interaction is statistically significant, F(2,6TJ=3.97, p=.Q24. This means that the
"effect" of math grades on math achievement depends on whichfather 's education level is being
considered. If you find a significant interaction, you should examine the profile plots of cell means to
visualize the differential effects. If there is a significant interaction, the lines on the profile plot will not
be parallel. In this case, the plot indicates that math achievement is relatively low for both groups of
students whose fathers had relatively low education (high school grad or less). However, for students
whose fathers have a high education level (BS or more\ differences in math grades seem to have a large
"effect" on math achievement. This interpretation, based on a visual inspection of the plots, needs to be
checked with inferential statistics. When the interaction is statistically significant, you should analyze
the "simple effects" (differences between means for one variable at each particular level of the other
variable). We will illustrate one method for statistically analyzing the simple effects in Problem 8.2.
Now, examine the main effects of math grades and of father's education revised. Note that both are
statistically significant, but because the interaction is significant this is somewhat misleading. The plots
show that the effect of math grades does not seem to hold true for those whose fathers had the least
education. Note also the callout boxes about the adjusted R squared and eta squared. Eta, the correlation
ratio, is used when the independent variable is nominal and the dependent variable (math achievement in
this problem) is scale. Eta is an indicator of the proportion of variance that is due to between groups
differences. Adjusted R2 refers to the multiple correlation coefficient, squared and adjusted for number
of independent variables, N, and effect size. Like r2, eta squared and R2 indicate how much variance or
variability hi the dependent variable can be predicted; however, the multiple /S2 is used when there are
several independent variables, and the r2 is used when there is only one independent variable. In this
problem, the eta2 values for the three key Fs vary from .106 to .243. Because eta and R, like r, are
indexes of association, they can be used to interpret the effect size. However, the guidelines according to
Cohen (1988) for eta and R are somewhat different (for eta: small = .10, medium = .24, and large = .31;
for R: small = .10, medium =.36, and large = .51).
In this example, eta for math grades is about .37 ( V.139 = .37 ) and, thus, according to Cohen (1988) a
large effect. Eta for father's education (revised) is about .49, a large effect. The interaction eta is about
.33, a large effect. The overall adjusted R is about .54, a large effect, but not really bigger than for
father's education alone, when you consider the different criteria for "large" for eta vs. R. Notice that the
adjusted R2 is lower than the unadjusted (.29 vs. .34). The reason for this is that the adjusted /Stakes into
account (and adjusts for) several things including the fact that not just one but three factors (mathgr,
faedRevis, and the interaction), some of which have more than two levels, were used to predict math
achievement.

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
An important point to remember is that statistical significance depends heavily on the sample size so that
with 1,000 subjects, a much lower For r will be significant than if the sample is 10 or even 100.
Statistical significance just tells you that you can be quite sure that there is at least a tiny relationship
between the independent and dependent variables. Effect size measures, which are more independent of
sample size, tell how strong the relationship is and, thus, give you some indication of its importance.
How to write the results for Problem 8.1 is included in the interpretation box for Problem 8.2.
Problem 8.2: Post Hoc Analysis of a Significant Interaction
We have described, in the interpretation of Output 8.1, how to visually inspect and interpret the Profile
Plots when there is a statistically significant interaction. In Problem 8.2 we will illustrate one way to test
the simple main effects statistically. In the interpretation of Output 8.1, we indicated that you should
examine the interaction F first. If it is statistically significant, it provides important information and
means that the results of the main effects may be misleading. Figure 8.4 is a decision tree that illustrates
this point and guides the analysis in this section.
Is the interaction
statistically significant?
Examine the two main effects
one at a time.
Examine the interaction
first (then the main
effects with caution).
One method of interpreting the interaction:
1. 
Compute a new variable with each of the original cells as a
level.
2. 
Run a one-way ANOVA and follow-up contrasts that
compare the means that are relevant for the simple effects.
3. 
Examine the simple main effects using the contrast results.

faedrevi=2\ Level 4: mathgr = 1 &faedRevis = 2; Level 5: mathgr = 0 &faedRevis = 3; and Level
6: mathgr = 1 &faedRevis = 3.
Next, you will use this new variable, cellcode, to examine the statistical significance of differences
among certain of the six cells using one-way ANOVA and the contrasts command. This will help us to
interpret the simple effects that we discussed above.

Instead of doing Post Hoc tests, we will do Contrasts, which compare preselected pairs of means rather
than all possible pairs of means. In this case, we want to compare the math achievement of high versus
low math grade students at each of the three levels of father's education. This is done by telling SPSS
specific cell means to contrast. For example, if we want to compare only the first and second means
while ignoring the other four means, we would write a contrast statement as follows 1-10000. This
can be done with the SPSS syntax or using the point and click method as shown below.

Enter a third 0, press Add; enter a fourth 0. Fig 8.9 is how the window should look just before you
press Add the final time. This compares the math achievement scores of students with low versus

Now press Next so that the Fig. 8.9 says Contrast 2 of 2.
Now enter the following coefficients as you did for the first contrast: 001-100. Be sure to press
Add after you enter each number. This compares the math achievement scores of students with low

Press Next and enter the following Coefficients for Contrast 3 of 3: 0 0 0 0 1 -1. This compares the
math achievement scores of students with low versus high grades if their fathers have the highest
level of education.

Thus, what we have done with the above instructions is simple main effects, first comparing students
with high and low math grades who have fathers with less than a high school education. Second, we
have compared students with high and low math grades who have fathers with some college. Finally, we
have compared students with high and low math grades who have fathers with a B.S. or more. Look
back at how we computed the cellcode variable (or the syntax below) to see why this is true. Note that in
cases like this it might be easier to type the syntax, which is part of the reason many experienced SPSS
users prefer to use syntax. However, you must type the syntax exactly correct or the program will not

The circle in the contrasts table
above indicates the three simple
main effects shown in Fig. 8.10.
Interpretation of Output 8.2
This output is the result of doing the first two steps, shown in Fig. 8.4, for interpreting a statistically
significant interaction. Using Output 8.2, we can examine the simple effects statistically. The first table,
Descriptives, provides the means of the six new cell code groups that will be compared, two at a time, as
shown in the Contrast Coefficients table. The second table is the Levene test for the assumption that
the variances are equal or homogeneous. In this case, the Levene's test is significant, so the assumption
is violated and the variances cannot be assumed to be equal. The third table is the ANOVA table and the
overall F (6.86) is significant (p < .001), which indicates that there are significant differences
somewhere. The Contrast Tests table helps us identify which simple main effects were statistically
significant. We will focus on one set of simple main effects in our interpretation, the ones based on t
tests that do not assume equal variances. Note that we have circled three Sigs. (the significance level or
p). 
These correspond to the three simple main effects shown with arrows in our drawing of the
interaction plot (Fig. 8.10). For example, the left-hand arrow (and the first contrast) compares math
achievement scores for both high and low math grades of students whose fathers have a relatively low
education level.
Arrows show simple main
effects that we tested with the
Contrast command. This
graph was not produced by
SPSS but is similar to the
profile plot in Output 8.1.
Fig. 8.10. Interaction plot showing three simple main effects.
139

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
We can now confirm statistically what we thought from visual inspection of the profile plot in Output
8.1. As you can see in Fig. 8.10 and the circled parts of the Contrast Test table, there is not a significant
difference (p = .742) in math achievement between students with high and low math grades when their
father's education is low. Likewise, this difference, while bigger (3.61 points), is not statistically
significant (p = .112) when their father's education is medium (some college). However, whenfather's
education is high, students with high (mostly As and Bs) math grades do much better (9.47 points) on the
achievement test than those with low grades (p = .001). Thus, math achievement depends on both a
student's math grades and their father's education. It would also be possible to examine the simple main
effects for high and low math grades separately (the two lines), but this is usually not necessary to
understand the interaction.
Example of How to Write About Problems 8.1 and 8.2
Results
Table 8.1 shows that there was a significant interaction between the effects of math grades and
father's education on math achievement, F(2,67)=3. 97, p=. 024. Table 8.2 shows the number of subjects,
the mean, and standard deviation of math achievement for each cell. Simple effects analyses revealed
that, of students with more highly educated fathers, those who had mostly A and B grades had higher
math achievement than did students who had lower grades, t (13.86) = -3.97,/? = .001). Simple effects at
the other levels of father education were not significant, indicating that for students whose fathers were
less educated, students with higher and lower math grades had similar math achievement scores.

Chapter 8 - Factorial ANOVA and ANCOVA
Problem 8.3: Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)
ANCOVA is an extension of ANOVA that typically provides a way of statistically controlling for the
effects of continuous or scale variables that you are concerned about but that are not the focal point or
independent variable(s) in the study. These scale variables are called covariates (or sometimes, control
variables). Covariates usually are variables that may cause you to draw incorrect inferences about the
ability of the independent variables to predict the dependent variable if not controlled (confounds). It is
also possible to use ANCOVA when you are interested in examining a combination of a categorical
(nominal) variable and a continuous (scale) variable as predictors of the dependent variable. In this latter
case, you would not consider the covariate to be an extraneous variable, but rather a variable that is of
interest in the study. SPSS will allow you to determine the significance of the contribution of the
covariate, as well as whether the nominal variables (factors) significantly predict the dependent variable,
over and above the "effect" of the covariate.
Assumptions of Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)
The first assumption for analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) is that the observations must be independent.
This is a design issue that should be addressed prior to data collection. Using random sampling is the best
way of ensuring that the observations are independent; however, this is not always possible. The most
important thing to avoid is having known relationships among participants in the study (e.g., several
family members or several participants obtained through "snowball" sampling included as "separate"
participants). The second assumption is that the dependent variable needs to be normally distributed,
which can be checked with skewness values. It is also important to have homogeneity of variances,
particularly if sample sizes differ across levels of the independent variable(s). Homogeneity can be
assessed through Box's Test or Levene's test. The fourth assumption is that there needs to be a linear
relationship between the covariates and the dependent variable. This can be checked with a scatterplot
(or matrix scatterplot if there is more than one covariate). The regression slopes for the covariates (in
relation to the dependent variable) need to be the same for each group (this is called homogeneity of
regression slopes). This assumption is one of the most important assumptions, and it can be checked with
an F test on the interaction of the independent variables with the covariate. If the F test is significant,
then this assumption has been violated.
In the HSB data, boys have significantly higher math achievement scores than girls. To see if the males'
higher math achievement scores are due to differences in the number of math courses taken by the male
and female students, we will use math courses taken as a covariate and do ANCOVA.
8.3 Do boys have higher math achievement than girls if we control for differences in the number of
math coitrses taken?
To answer this question, first, we need to assess the assumption of homogeneity of regression slopes:

cell sizes are almost equal (34 and 41), this
is not a big problem, especially given the
way SPSS calculates the ANCOVA.

Interpretation of Output 8.3
The ANCOVA (Tests of Between Subject Effects) table is interpreted in much the same way as
ANOVA tables in earlier outputs. The covariate (mothers) has a highly significant "effect" on math
achievement, as should be the case. However, the "effect" of gender is no longer significant, F(l,72)=
.36,/7=.55. You can see from the Estimated Marginal Means table that the statistically adjusted math
achievement means for boys and girls are quite similar once differences in the number of math courses
taken were accounted for.
Example of How to Write About Problems 8.3
Results
An analysis of covariance was used to assess whether boys have higher math achievement than girls
after controlling for differences between boys and girls in the number of math courses taken. Results
indicate that after controlling for the number of math courses taken, there is not a significant difference
between boys and girls in math achievement, F(l, 72) = .36, p = .552. Table 8.3 presents the means and
standard deviations for boys and girls on math achievement, before and after controlling for number of
math courses taken. As is evident from this table, virtually no difference between boys and girls remains
after differences in number of math courses taken are controlled.

CHAPTER 9
Repeated Measures and Mixed ANOVAs
In this chapter, you will analyze a new data set that includes repeated measure data. These data allow you
to compare four products (or these could be four instructional programs), each of which was evaluated by
12 consumers/judges (6 male and 6 female). The analysis requires statistical techniques for within
subjects and mixed designs.
In Problem 9.1, to do the analysis, you will use the SPSS General Linear Model program (called GLM)
and do a repeated measures ANOVA. In Problem 9.3, you will use the same GLM program to do a
mixed ANOVA, one that has a repeated measures independent variable and a between groups
independent variable. In Problem 9.2, you will use a nonparametric statistic, the Friedman test, which is
similar to the repeated measures ANOVA. SPSS does not have a nonparametric equivalent to the mixed
ANOVA.
Chapter 3 provides several tables to help you decide what statistic to use with various types of difference
statistics problems. Tables 3.1 and 3.3 include the statistics used in this chapter. Please refer back to
chapter 3 to see how these statistics fit into the big picture.
Assumptions of Repeated Measures ANOVA
The assumptions of repeated measures ANOVA are similar to those for the ANOVA, and they include
independence of observations (unless the dependent data comprise the "within-subjects" or "repeated
measures" factor), normality, and homogeneity of variances. However, in addition to variances, which
involve deviations from the mean of each person's score on one measure, the repeated measures design
includes more than one measure for each person. Thus, covariances, which involve deviations from the
mean of each of two measures for each person, also exist, and these covariances need to meet certain
assumptions as well. The homogeneity assumption for repeated measures designs, known as sphericity,
requires equal variances and covariances for each level of the within subjects variable. Another way of
thinking about sphericity is that, if one created new variables for each pair of within subjects variable
levels by subtracting each person's score for one level of the repeated measures variable from that same
person's score for the other level of the within subject variable, the variances for all of these new
difference scores would be equal. Unfortunately, it is rare for behavioral science data to meet the
sphericity assumption, and violations of this assumption can seriously affect results. However,
fortunately, there are good ways of dealing with this problemâeither by adjusting the degrees of freedom
or by using a multivariate approach to repeated measures. Both of these are discussed later in this
chapter. One can test for the sphericity assumption using the Mauchly's test, the Box test, the
Greenhouse-Geisser test, and/or the Huynh-Feldt tests (see below). Even though the repeated measures
ANOVA is fairly robust to violations of normality, the dependent variable should be approximately
normally distributed for each level of the independent variable.
Assumptions of Mixed ANOVA
The assumptions for mixed ANOVA are similar to those for the repeated measures ANOVA, except that
the assumption of sphericity must hold for levels of the within subjects variable at each level of between
subjects variables. This can be tested using SPSS with Box's M.

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
The Product Data Set
Open the SPSS for Windows program. Open the Product data set. Do not retrieve the hsbdata for this
assignment.
In this study, each of the 12 participants (or subjects) has evaluated four products (e.g., four brands of
DVD players) on 1-7 Likert scales. You will find the data presented in the SPSS data editor once you
have opened the product data set.
â¢ 
Click on the Data View tab at the bottom of the screen to get Fig 9.1.
Note that this is what the data view for
your product data looks like. In most
studies the N would be larger.
Fig. 9.1. Data view for the
product data.
Figure 9.1 shows the Data View for 12 participants who were asked to rate four products (pi, p2, p3, and
p4) from 1 (very low quality) to 7 (very high quality). The participants were also asked their gender
(l=male, 2=female). Thus, subjects 1-6 are males and 7-12 are females.
â¢ 
Click on the Variable View tab to see the names and labels of the variables as shown in Fig. 9.2.
Fig. 9.2.
Variable view.
We have labeled the measurement of the four products scale because the frequency distribution of each is
approximately normal. We label gender and other dichotomous variables as nominal; however, despite
this traditional designation for dichotomous variables, dichotomous variables, unlike other types of
nominal variables, provide meaningful averages (indicating percentage of participants falling in each
category) and can be used in multiple and logistic regression as if they were ordered. Furthermore, many
dichotomous variables (but not gender) even have an implied order (e.g., 0=do not have the characteristic
and 1= have the characteristic; thus, a score of 1 indicates more of the characteristic than does a score of
0).
In repeated measures (also called within-subjects) analyses, SPSS creates the Within-Subjects Factor or
independent variable from two or more existing variables (in this case/?/, p2, p3, andpf). 
These then
become levels of the new independent variable. In this example, we will call the new variable product,
and it has four levels (pi, etc.), indicating which product was being rated. In order for a set of variables
148

Chapter 9 - Repeated Measures and Mixed ANOVAs
to be converted into a meaningful within-subject factor, the scores on each of the existing variables
(which will become levels of the new within-subjects variable) have to be comparable (e.g., ratings on the
same 7-point Likert scale) and each participant has to have a score on each of the variables. The within-
subject factor could be based on related or matched subjects (e.g., the ratings of a product by mother,
father, and child from each family) instead of a single participant having repeated scores. The within-
subjects design should be used whenever there are known dependencies in the data, such as multiple
family members, that are consistent across the independent participants, such as families (i.e., there is a
mother, father, and child rating for each family) but would otherwise violate the between-subjects
assumption of independent observations. The dependent variable for the data in Fig. 9.1 could be called
product ratings and would be the scores/ratings for each of the four products. Thus, the independent
variable, product, indicates which product is being rated, and the dependent variable is the rating itself.
Note that gender is a between subjects independent variable that will be used in Problem 9.3.
Problem 9.1: Repeated Measures ANOVA
The GLM repeated measures procedure provides a variety of analysis of variance procedures to use when
the same measurement is made several times on each subject or the same measurement is made on several
related subjects. The single-factor repeated measures ANOVA, which we will use for Problem 9.1, is
appropriate when you have one independent variable with two or more levels that are repeated measures
and one dependent variable. If there are only two levels, the sphericity assumption is not a problem
because there is only one pair of levels. If between subjects factors are specified, they divide the sample
into groups. There are no between subject or group factors in this problem. Finally, you can use a
multivariate or univariate approach to testing repeated measures effects.

This is a test of an assumption of
the univariate approach to
repeated measures ANOVA. As is
commonly the case, the Mauchly
statistic is significant and, thus,
the assumption is violated.
The epsilons, which are measures of degree of sphericity, are less than
1.0, indicating that the sphericity assumption is violated. The "lower-
bound" indicates the lowest value that epsilon could be. The highest
epsilon possible is always 1.0. When sphericity is violated, you can
either use the multivariate results or use epsilons to adjust the numerator
and denominator dfs. Typically, when epsilons are less than .75, use the
Greenhouse-Geisser epsilon, but use Huynh-Feldt if epsilon > .75.

Chapter 9 - Repeated Measures and Mixed ANOVAs
Interpretation of Output 9.1
The first table identifies the four levels of the within subjects repeated measures independent variable,
product. For each level (PI to P4), there is a rating of 1-7, which is the dependent variable.
The second table presents four similar Multivariate Tests of the within-subjects effect (i.e., whether the
four products are rated equally). Wilks* Lambda is a commonly used multivariate test. Notice that in this
case, the Fs, df, and significance are all the same: F(3,9) = 19.07, p< .001. The significant F means that
there is a difference somewhere in how the products are rated. The multivariate tests can be used whether
or not sphericity is violated. However, if epsilons are high, indicating that one is close to achieving
sphericity, the multivariate tests may be less powerful (less likely to indicate statistical significance) than
the corrected univariate repeated measures ANOVA.
The third table shows that the Mauchly Test of Sphericity is significant, which indicates that these data
violate the sphericity assumption of the univariate approach to repeated measures analysis of variance.
Thus, we should either use the multivariate approach, use the appropriate nonparametric test (Friedman),
or correct the univariate approach with the Greenhouse-Geisser or other similar correction.
You can see in the Tests of Within-Subject Effects that these corrections reduce the degrees of freedom
by multiplying them by Epsilon. In this case, 3 x .544 = 1.63 and 33 x .544 = 17.95. Even with this
adjustment, the Within-Subjects Effects (ofproduct) is significant, F( 1.63, 17.95) = 23.63,p < .001, as
were the multivariate tests. This means that the ratings of the four products are significantly different.
However, this overall (product) F does not tell you which pairs of products have significantly different
means.
SPSS has several tests of within subject contrasts. We have chosen to use the polynomial contrast on the
assumption that the products are ordered, say from the most expensive as PI to the least as P4. The Tests
of Within-Subjects Contrasts table shows whether the four product means are significantly like a
straight line (linear effect), a line with one change in direction (quadratic), and a two bend line (cubic).
You can see that there is a highly significant linear trend and a significant cubic trend. If you plot the
means (shown in Output 9.2), these trends should be clear. Overall, there is a linear decline in ratings
from Product 1 (3.67) to Product 4 (1.33). However, Product 2 has a somewhat lower mean (2.25) than
Product 3 (2.75) producing the cubic trend.
In Output 9.1, we ignore the "Tests of Between Subject Effects " table because we do not have a
between subject/groups variable.
How to Write about Output 9.1.
Results
A repeated measures ANOVA, with Greenhouse-Geisser correction, was conducted to assess whether
there were differences between the average ratings of the four products. Results indicated that
participants did rate the four products differently, F( 1.63, 17.95) = 23.63,p< .001, R2 = .68, eta2 = .68.
The means and standard deviations for the products listed in order from most expensive to least
expensive, are presented in Table 9.1. Examination of these means suggests that participants rated
products that are more expensive more highly than less expensive products. Polynomial contrasts
indicated, in support of this, there was a significant linear trend, F (1,11) = 26.53,/? <.001, eta2 = .71.
However, this finding was qualified by the significant cubic trend, F (1,11) = 20.88, p = .001, eta2 = .66,
reflecting the higher rating for Product 3 than Product 2.

Problem 9.2: The Friedman Nonparametric Test for Several Related Samples
What could you do if the product ratings are ordinal data or the repeated measures ANOVA assumptions
are markedly violated? One answer is to use a nonparametric statistic. As you can tell from Table 3.1
(p. 49), an appropriate nonparametric test for when you have more than two levels of one repeated
measures or related samples (i.e., within-subjects) independent variables is the Friedman test.
9.2. Are there differences among the mean ranks of the product ratings?
Let's use/?/ top4 again with the following commands:
â¢ 
Analyze => Nonparametric tests => K Related Samples... and move product 1 [pi] to product4
[p4] to the Test Variables box (see Fig. 9.7).

Interpretation of Output 9.2a
The Descriptive Statistics table provides familiar statistics that were useful for interpreting the
polynomial contrasts in Output 9.1 but are not, themselves used in the Friedman test. Rather, ratings are
ranked, and the means of these ranks are used in the Friedman. The Ranks table shows the mean rank for
each of the four products.
The Friedman Test Statistic table tests the null hypothesis that the four related variables come from the
same population. For each rater/case, the four variables are ranked from 1 to 4. The test statistic is based
on these ranks. The Asymp. Sig. (asymptotic significance, which means this is not an exact significance
level) ofp <.OQ1 indicates that there is a significant overall difference among the four mean ranks.
Unfortunately, SPSS does not have a post hoc test built into the Friedman test program. Therefore, in
order to determine which differences between mean ranks are significant, and thus the likely source of the
significant Friedman test, we will need to perform a nonparametric related sample test like the Wilcoxon.
See Table 3.1 (p. 49) for a more complete view of all of the different statistical tests and their uses.

Chapter 9 - Repeated Measures and Mixed ANOVAs
Interpretation of Output 9.2b
Given that there was a significant overall difference between the mean ranks, we followed up the
Friedman with Wilcoxon tests. Since the products are ordered and there are four levels, it makes sense to
do three orthogonal contrasts, contrasting adjacent pairs. A larger number of comparisons would prevent
the comparisons from being completely independent of one another. Given that three post hoc
comparisons were made, it would be desirable to make a Bonferroni correction on alpha, such that/?
would need to be .05/3 ( about .017) to be significant. Notice that the contrasts between pro ducts 2 and 1
and between 4 and 3 are significant at this level and that they both indicate that the higher numbered
product was given a lower rating than the lower numbered product. On the other hand, the difference
between ratings for products 3 and 2 was not significant. This is not surprising when you look at the
means in Output 9.2 and suggests that the slight increase in ratings for product 3 compared to product 2
may not be important. Remember, however, that the Wilcoxon is not performed on the rating scores
themselves, but rather on the ranks of the ratings.
How to Write About Outputs 9.2a and 9.2b
Results
A Friedman test was conducted to assess if there were differences among the mean ranks of the
product ratings, x2 (3, JV = 12) = 26.17, p = .001. This indicates that there were differences among the four
mean ranks. Three orthogonal contrasts were performed using Wilcoxon tests with the Bonferroni
correction (comparison-wise alpha = .017). The contrasts between Product 1 and 2, and between Products
3 and 4 were found to be significant; however that between Products 2 and 3 was not significant. In both
cases, the significant contrasts indicated that the more expensive product was rated more highly.
Problem 9.3: Mixed ANOVA
Using this General Linear Model procedure, you can test null hypotheses about the effects of both the
between groups factors and the within subjects factors. You can investigate interactions between factors
as well as the effects of individual factors on one or more dependent variables.
Repeat Problem 9.1 except add gender to see if there are any gender differences as well as product
differences and if there is an interaction between gender and product. Is gender a between groups/subjects
or within subjects variable? The answer is important in how you compute and interpret the analysis.
9.3. Are there gender as well as product differences? Is there an interaction between gender and product?

Interpretation of Output 9.3
Most of these tables are similar in format and interpretation to those in Output 9.1. However, the addition
engender as a between subjects independent variable makes the last table meaningful and adds an
interaction (product * gender) to both the multivariate tests table and the univariate (within-subjects
effects) tables. Both multivariate and univariate tables indicate that (as in Output 9.1) there are
differences among the products. Again, there are significant linear and cubic trends, but now the
quadratic trend is significant as well. In addition, the interaction of product and gender are significant
with both univariate and multivariate tests. This means that the downward overall trend for all subjects is
somewhat different for males and females. Moreover, the linear and quadratic trends are significant for
the interaction between product and gender.
If we had three groups, instead of just males and females, for our between groups variable and if the
ANOVA had been significant, we would have used a post hoc test for this effect. SPSS provides the same
wide variety of post hoc multiple comparisons that were available for one-way ANOVA and factorial
ANOVAs, including the Tukey and Games Howell.
How to Write About Output 9.3
Results
A mixed ANOVA was conducted to assess whether there were gender and product differences in
product ratings. Results indicated a significant main effect of product, F( 1.64, 16.4) = 41.77, p< .001,
but not of gender, F(l, 10) = 2.72,p = .13. However, the product main effect was qualified by a
significant interaction between product and gender, F( 1.64, 16.40) = 9.44, p= .003. This indicates that
even though as a general rule, males do not rate products higher or lower than females, males do rate
particular products differently than do females.

CHAPTER 10
Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA)
and Canonical Correlation
In this chapter, we introduce multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), which is a complex statistic
similar to ANOVA but with multiple dependent variables analyzed together. The dependent variables
should be related conceptually, and they should be correlated with one another at a low to moderate level.
If they are too highly correlated, one runs the risk of multicollinearity. If they are uncorrelated, there is
usually no reason to analyze them together. The General Linear Model program in SPSS provides you
with a multivariate F based on the linear combination of dependent variables that maximally distinguishes
your groups. This multivariate result is the MANOVA. SPSS also automatically prints out univariate Fs
for the separate univariate ANOVAs for each dependent variable. Typically, these ANOVA results are
not examined unless the multivariate results (the MANOVA) are significant, and some statisticians
believe that they should not be used at all.
In this chapter, you will first do a one-way or single factor MANOVA. This problem has one
independent variable (father's education revised) and three dependent variables (grades, math
achievement, and visualization test). One could do three separate one-way ANOVAs; however, using
MANOVA, you will see how the combination of the three variables distinguishes the groups, in one
analysis. The second problem is a two-way or two-factor MANOVA. It is two-way because there are
two independent variables (math grades and gender) and MANOVA because two test scores are
examined simultaneously as dependent variables. Problem 10.3 is a doubly multivariate or mixed
MANOVA. It is mixed because there is a between groups independent variable (intervention group) and
a repeated measures independent variable (time: pretest and posttest). It is MANOVA because these are
two (or more) dependent variables. Mixed MANOVAs are one way to analyze intervention
(experimental) studies that have more than one dependent variable.
Finally, Problem 10.4 uses canonical correlation for a problem with two sets of two or more variables
each. Canonical correlation relates variables in set 1 to those in set 2.
Assumptions of MANOVA
The assumptions of MANOVA include: independent observations (each person's scores are independent
of every other person's scores), multivariate normality, and homogeneity of variance/covariance matrices
(variances for each dependent variable are approximately equal in all groups plus covariances between
pairs of dependent variables are approximately equal for all groups). MANOVA is robust to violations of
multivariate normality and to violations of homogeneity of variance/covariance matrices if groups are of
nearly equal size (N of the largest group is no more than about 1.5 times the N of the smallest group).

Problem 10.1: GLM Single-Factor Multivariate Analysis of Variance
Sometimes you have more than one dependent variable that you want to analyze simultaneously. The
GLM multivariate procedure allows you to analyze differences between levels of one or more (usually
nominal level) independent variables, with respect to a linear combination of several dependent variables.
One can also include scale variables (covariates) as predictors of the linear combination of dependent
162

Chapter 10 - Multivariate Analysis of Variance
variables. When you include both nominal variables and scale variables as predictors, one usually refers
to the analysis as MANCOVA (Multivariate Analysis of Covariance).
10.1. Are there differences between the three father's education groups on a linear combination of
grades, math achievement, and visualization tesfl Also, are there differences between groups on any of
these variables separately? Which ones?
Before we answer these questions, we will correlate the dependent variables, to see if they are moderately
correlated. To do this:
â¢ 
Select Analyze=> CorreIate=>Bivariate.
â¢ 
Move grades in h.s., math achievement test, and visualization test into the Variables box.
â¢

will be included in the correlations, just as they will be in the MANOVA).

high: the correlation between grades in h.s. and math achievement test (.504). Thus, we will keep
an eye on it in the MANOVA that follows. If the correlations were .60 or above, we would
consider either making a composite variable (in which the highly correlated variables were
summed or averaged) or eliminating one of the variables.

This parameter is set to zero because it is redundant.
Each of the variables in brackets under Parameter comprises a dummy variable devised to
distinguish one group from the others. For example, the circled weights (B) were devised to
maximize differences between the first group (students whose fathers had high school
education or less) and all other groups (those whose fathers had more education). Note that
there are actually just two dummy variables, as a third would provide redundant information.
Interpretation of Output 10.1
The GLM Multivariate procedure provides an analysis for "effects" on a linear combination of several
dependent variables of one or more fixed factor/independent variables and/or covariates. Note that many
of the results (e.g., Descriptive Statistics, Test of Between Subjects Effects) refer to the univariate tests.
The first test we encounter is the Box's test of equality of covariance matrices. This tests whether or
not the covariances among the three dependent variables are the same for the three father's education
groups. The Box test is strongly affected by violations of normality and may not be accurate. If Ns for
the various groups are approximately equal, then the Box test should be ignored. Our largest group (N~
38) is 2.3 times larger than our smallest group (N= 16), so we should look at the Box test, which is not
significant (p = .147). Thus, the assumption of homogeneity of covariances is not violated. If the Box
test had been significant, we would have looked at the correlations among variables separately for the 3
groups and noted the magnitude of the discrepancies. Pillai's trace is the best Multivariate statistic to
use if there is violation of the homogeneity of covariance matrices assumption and group sizes are similar
(not the case here). None of the multivariate tests would be robust if Box's test had been significant and
group sizes were very different.
MANOVA provides four multivariate tests (in the Multivariate Tests table). These tests examine
whether the three father's education groups differ on a linear combination of the dependent variables:
grades in h.s., math achievement, and visualization test. Under most conditions when assumptions are
met, Wilks* Lambda provides a good and commonly used multivariate F (in this case F =3.04, df= 68,
136,/>=.008). The "intercept" effect is just needed to fit the line to the data so skip over it. The main part
of this multivariate test table to look at is the FAEDR effect. This significant F indicates that there are
significant differences among the FAEDR groups on a linear combination of the three dependent
variables.
Next, we see the Levene's test table. This tests the assumption of MANOVA and ANOVA that the
variances of each variable are equal across groups. If the Levene's test is significant, as it is in this output
for math achievement, this means the assumption has been violated. Results for math achievement should
be viewed with caution (or the data could be transformed so as to equalize the variances).
Because the MANOVA was significant, we will now examine the univariate ANOVA results (in the
167

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
Tests of Between Subject Effects table). Note that these tests are identical to the three separate
univariate one-way ANOVAs we would have performed if we opted not to do the MANOVA. Because
the grades in h.s. and math achievement dependent variables are statistically significant and there are
three levels or values of father's education, we would need to do post hoc multiple comparisons or
contrasts to see which pairs of means are different.
Both multivariate and univariate (between subjects) tests provide measures of effect size (eta squared).
For the multivariate test eta is .34 (the square root of. 118), which is about a medium effect size. The
univariate etas are .32, .43, .14 for grades in h.s., math achievement and the visualization test,
respectively. The first one is a medium effect and the second is a large effect. The eta for visualization
indicates a small effect, and because F (.76) is not significant (p=.470), this result could be due to chance
(See Table 3.5 on page 55 for interpretation of the effect size for eta.).
In MANOVA, a linear combination of the dependent variables is created and groups are compared on that
variable. To create this linear combination for each participant, the computer multiplies the participant's
score on each variable by a weight (B), with the values of the weights being devised so as to maximize
differences between groups. Next, we see the Parameter Estimates, which tell us how the dependent
variables are weighted in the equation that maximally distinguishes the groups. Note that in the column
under Parameter in this table, three variables are listed that seem new. These are the dummy variables
that were used to test for differences between groups. The first one [FAEDR =1] indicates differences
between students whose fathers have high school education or less and the other students whose fathers
have more education. The second one [FAEDR = 2] indicates differences between students whose fathers
have some college and students in the other 2 groups. A third dummy variable would provide redundant
information and, thus, is not considered; there are k-1 independent dummy variables, where k = number
of groups. The next column, headed by B indicates the weights for the dependent variables for that
dummy variable. For example, in order to distinguish students whose fathers have high school education
or less from other students, math achievement is weighted highest in absolute value (-6.263), followed by
grades in h.s. (-1.184), and then visualization test (-.789). In all cases, students whose fathers have less
education score lower than other students, as indicated by the minus signs. This table can also tell us
which variables significantly contributed toward distinguishing which groups, if you look at the sig
column for each dummy variable. For example, both grades in high school and math achievement
contributed significantly toward discriminating group 1 (high school grad or less) from the other two
groups, but no variables significantly contributed to distinguishing group 2 (some college) from the other
two groups (although grades in high school discriminates group 2 from the others at almost significant
levels). Visualization, does not significantly contribute to distinguishing any of the groups.
We can look at the ANOVA (Between Subjects) and Parameter Estimates table results to determine
whether the groups differ on each of these variables, examined alone. This will help us in determining
whether multicollinearity affected results because if two or more of the ANOVAs are significant, but the
corresponding variable(s) are not weighted much (examine the B scores) in the MANOVA, this probably
is because of multicollinearity. The ANOVAs also help us understand which variables, separately, differ
across groups. Note again that some statisticians think that it is not appropriate to examine the univariate
ANOVAs. Traditionally, univariate Fs have been analyzed to understand where the differences are when
there is a significant multivariate F. One argument against reporting the univariate F is that the univariate
Fs do not take into account the relations among the dependent variables; thus the variables that are
significant in the univariate tests are not always the ones that are weighted most highly in the multivariate
test. Univariate Fs also can be confusing because they will sometimes be significant when the
multivariate F is not. Furthermore, if one is using the MANOVA to reduce Type I error by analyzing all
dependent variables together, then analyzing the univariate F's "undoes" this benefit, thus, increasing
Type I error. One method to compensate for this is to use the Bonferroni correction to adjust the alpha
used to determine statistical significance of the univariate Fs.

Results
A multivariate analysis of variance was conducted to assess if there were differences between the
three father's education groups on a linear combination of grades in h.s., math achievement, and
visualization test. A significant difference was found, Wilk's A = .777, F (68, 136) = 3.04, /?=.008,
multivariate rf = .12. Examination of the coefficients for the linear combinations distinguishing father
education groups indicated that grades in high school and math achievement contributed most to
distinguishing the groups. In particular, both grades in high school (-1.18) and math achievement (-6.26)
contributed significantly toward discriminating group 1 (high school grad or less) from the other two
groups (p = .006 and/7 < .001, respectively), but no variables significantly contributed to distinguishing
group 2 (some college) from the other two groups. Visualization did not contribute significantly to
distinguishing any of the groups.
Follow up univariate ANOVAs indicated that both math achievement and grades in high school were
significantly different for children of fathers with different degrees of education, F (2,70) = 7.88, p =.001
and F (2,70) = 4.09, p = .021, respectively .
Problem 10.2: GLM Two-Factor Multivariate Analysis of Variance
MANOVA is also useful when there is more than one independent variable and several related dependent
variables. Let's answer the following questions:
10.2. Do students who differ in math grades and gender differ on a linear combination of two dependent
variables (math achievement, and visualization test)1? Do males and females differ in terms of
whether those with higher and lower math grades differ on these two variables (is there an
interaction between math grades and gender)1? What linear combination of the two dependent
variables distinguishes these groups?
We already know the correlation between the two dependent variables is moderate (.42), so we will omit
the correlation matrix. Follow these steps:

Interpretation of Output 10.2
Many of the tables are similar to those in Output 10.1. For the Descriptive Statistics, we now see means
and standard deviations of the dependent variables for the groups made up of every combination of the
two levels of math grades and the two levels of gender. Box's test is again non-significant, indicating that
the assumption of homogeneity of covariance matrices is met.
The main difference in 10.2, as compared to 10.1, for both the Multivariate Tests table and the
univariate Tests of Between Subjects Effects table, is the inclusion of two main effects (one for each
independent variable) and one interaction (of math grades and gender: math grades * gender). The
interpretation of this interaction, if it were significant, would be similar to that in Output 10.1. However,
note that although both the multivariate main effects of math grades and gender are significant, the
multivariate interaction is not significant. Thus, we can look at the univariate tests of main effects, but we
should not examine the univariate interaction effects.
The Levene's test indicates that there is heterogeneity of variances for visualization test. Again, we could
have transformed that variable to equalize the variances. However, if we consider only the main effects
of gender and of math grades (since the interaction is not significant), then Ns are approximately equal
for the groups (34 and 41 for gender and 31 and 44 for math grades), so this is less of a concern.
The Tests of Between-Subjects Effects table indicates that there are significant main effects of both
independent variables on both dependent variables, with medium to large effect sizes. For example, the
"effect" of math grades on math achievement is large (eta = .41) and the effect of math grades on
visualization test is medium (eta = .27). Refer again to Table 3.5.
The Parameter Estimates table now has three dummy variables: for the difference between students with
less A-B and more A-B (MATHGR=0), for male versus not male (GEND=0), as well as for the
interaction term (MATHGR=0 GEND=0). Thus, we can see that math achievement contributes more than
visualization test to distinguishing students with better and worse math grades, as well as contributing
more to distinguishing boys from girls.

How to Write about Output 10.2
Results
To assess whether boys and girls with higher and lower math grades have different math
achievement and visualization test scores, and whether there was an interaction between gender and
math grades, a multivariate analysis of variance was conducted. The interaction was not significant,
Wilk's A = .995, F(2, 70) = .17,p =.843, multivariate T|2 = .005. The main effect for gender was
significant, Wilk's A = .800, F (2,70) = 8.74, p< .001, multivariate rf = .20. This indicates that the
linear composite of math achievement and visualization test differs for males and females. The main
effect for math grades is also significant, Wilk's A = .811, F (2, 70) = 8.15,/> = .001, multivariate r? =
.19. This indicates that the linear composite differs for different levels of math grades. Follow-up
ANOVAs (Table 10.2) indicate that effects of both math grades and gender were significant for both
math achievement and visualization. Males scored higher on both outcomes and students with higher
math grades were higher on both outcomes (see Table 10.1).

Problem 10.3: Mixed MANOVA
There might be times when you want to find out if there are differences between groups as well as within
subjects; this can be answered with Mixed MANOVA.
173

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
Assumptions of Repeated and Mixed MANOVA
The assumptions of repeated or doubly multivariate (multiple measures obtained on multiple occasions)
MANOVA include: linearity of relations among the dependent variables and multivariate normality; for
mixed MANOVA, an additional assumption is homogeneity of variance-covariance matrices between
groups. If the sample sizes in each group are approximately equal, repeated MANOVA is robust to these
assumptions. Linearity can be assessed through matrix scatterplots. If sample sizes are not equal, than
Box's Mtest can be conducted to check the homogeneity assumption, and univariate normality can be
assessed using plots to help assess the normality assumption. One should also make sure that sample sizes
are sufficiently large. If the number of variables times the number of levels of the within subjects
variable approaches the sample size, then the doubly multivariate analysis should not be conducted.
Rather, one should either use multiple MANOVAs with only one or two dependent variable each (if there
are only two, three, or four dependent variables), or one should aggregate or drop some dependent
variables (if there are more dependent variables).

Let's answer the following question:
10.3. Is there a difference between participants in the intervention group (group 1) and participants in the
control group (group 2) in the amount of change that occurs over time in scores on two different
outcome measures?
We will not check the assumptions of linearity, multivariate normality, or homogeneity of variance-
covariance matrices because the sample sizes are equal.

This table tells you what effects are significant. In this case, there are significant multivariate main
effects of group and time, but these are qualified by a group by time interaction. This indicates
that the difference between the intervention and control group on the linear combination of the two
dependent variables is different at pretest than at posttest. Examination of the means suggests that
this is because groups do not differ on either dependent variable at the time of the pretest, but they
do differ, particularly on the first dependent variable, at the time of the posttest.

Note that Mauchly's test of sphericity would be needed only in relation to the
assumptions of the follow-up univariate repeated measures tests (second table
below, labeled "univariate tests"); sphericity is not required for the
multivariate tests. In this case, it is not needed even for univariate tests
because there are only two levels of the within subjects variable, so sphericity
is not an issue and all epsilons are 1.0. The follow-up repeated measures
ANOVAs (see univariate effects table) and contrasts test whether these
apparent findings are statistically reliable.

This table displays follow-up repeated measures ANOVAs for each dependent
variable, which show that the main effect of time (change from pretest to posttest)
is significant only for dependent variable 1, and that the interaction between group
and time is only significant for dependent variable 1 . This indicates that the change
over time is associated with the intervention, but only for dependent variable 1.

This table indicates that there is a significant linear trend only for dependent variable 1 and
that this time effect interacted with group. Examination of the means suggests that this
interaction indicates that the time effect held only for the intervention group. The linear
trend is the only polynomial contrast used because there are only two groups and only two
time points, so quadratic or cubic trends are not possible. This table also provides effect
sizes (partial eta squared), which indicate that the effects for dvl were large.

This table indicates that if one averages across the within subjects variable (time), then the groups
differ only on dependent variable 1. This table is misleading because we know that there is no
difference at the tune of the pretest. In this case, it really does not provide much useful information.

Interpretation of Output 10.3
This example illustrates the utility of the doubly multivariate analysis for testing a pretest-posttest design
with intervention and control groups. Not only do we see from these results that the intervention seemed
successful when both outcome measures were taken together, but that the effect was significant only for
one of the dependent variables, when each was considered separately. Sphericity was not an issue in this
case because there were only two levels of the within-subjects variable. If one creates difference scores
by subtracting each person's score on the dependent variable at one level of the within-subjects variable
from the same dependent variable at each other level of the within-subjects variable, then sphericity exists
if the variances of the resulting difference scores are all equal. Because there are only two levels of the
within-subjects variable, there is only one set of difference scores, so sphericity has to exist. If we had
had more than two levels of the within-subjects variable, then we would have needed to be concerned
about the sphericity assumption when examining the univariate results. If epsilons did not approach 1.0,
then we would have used the Huynh-Feldt or Greenhouse-Geisser test results, which use an estimate of
epsilon to correct the degrees of freedom.
Example of How to Write About Problem 10.3
Results
A doubly multivariate analysis was conducted to assess if there was a difference between participants
in the intervention group and participants in the control group in the amount of change in their scores on
the two outcome measures. Significant multivariate effects were found for the main effects of group, F
(2,17) = 10.5,/? = .001 and time F (2,17) = 39.3, p < .001, as well as for the interaction between group
and time, F (2,17) = 31.2, p < .001. This interaction effect indicates that the difference between the
intervention and control group on the linear combination of the two dependent variables is different at
pretest than it is at posttest. Examination of the means suggests that this is because groups do not differ
on either dependent variable at the time of the pretest, but they do differ, particularly on the first
dependent variable, at the time of the posttest. Follow-up ANOVAs reveal that the significant change
from pretest to posttest was significant only for the first outcome variable, jp(l,18) = 81,p<.001, and
that the change in the first outcome variable was different for the two groups, F (1,18) = 58.78, p < .001.
Examination of the means suggests that the change in the first outcome variable only held for the
intervention group.
Problem 10.4: Canonical Correlation
Canonical correlation is similar to MANOVA in that it is used when you have two sets of two or more
variables each and you want to see how differences in one set relate to differences in the other set of
variables. With canonical correlation, however, there is no distinction between independent and
dependent variables; they are called by SPSS "Set 1" and "Set 2." Moreover, usually canonical
correlation is used when both sets of variables are at least interval level (scale), whereas in MANOVA
usually at least some of the independent variables are dummy variables. Usually one would use canonical
correlation when the variables in each set can be grouped together conceptually, but you want to see if
there are particular subsets of them that relate to subsets in the other variable set, so you do not want to
sum each set to make an overall score. Usually, canonical correlation is used as an exploratory technique;
it is not commonly used to test specific hypotheses. Like principle components analysis, canonical
correlation enables you to see which variables go together; however, it determines which subset of the
"Set 1" variables best relate to which subset of the "Set 2" variables, then which other subset of the "Set
1" variables relate to another subset of the "Set 2" variables, etc. (Note: For those of you using earlier
versions of SPSS, it has been reported that SPSS versions below 10.0 tend to have problems running
canonical correlations. If you are using an earlier version and have problems, check the Help menu.)

Chapter 10 - Multivariate Analysis of Variance
Assumptions of Canonical Correlation
The assumptions of canonical correlation include: linearity (between each variable as well as between the
variables and the linear composites), multivariate normality, and homoscedasticity. Because multivariate
normality is difficult to assess, univariate normality can be evaluated. Multicollinearity should be
assessed as well. All of the assumptions can be evaluated through a matrix scatterplot of the canonical
variate scores (the scores are generated by the canonical correlation syntax). It is recommended to have at
least 10 subjects per variable in order to have adequate power.
10.4. What is the pattern of relationships between the motivation items and the competence items?
We will need to check the assumptions of linearity, multivariate normality, and homoscedasticity. One
way to do this is to graph the canonical variate scores that are generated by the canonical correlation
syntax. Because the canonical correlation needs to be computed first, we have done that below, with the
matrix scatterplot of the canonical variates afterwards. Be sure not to save your data file after running
these commands, or you will save the canonical variates.
Canonical correlation must be computed through syntax. Use the following syntax to answer the question
above. The first line needs to include where your SPSS syntax macro file is located on your computer (in
this case, it is on the c: drive under program files\spss, but yours might be located in a different folder).
INCLUDE 'c:\Program files\spss\canonical correlation.sps'.

The Wilks' lambda and corresponding
chi-square tests indicate that the
canonical correlation on that line plus all
later correlations are significantly
different from zero. Thus, the first line
tests whether both correlations, together,
are significantly different from zero.
The second line tests whether the second
correlation is significant, even after
removing the variance explained by the
previous correlation. The degrees of
freedom are calculated as the number of
variables in Set 1 times number of
variables in Set 2 for the first chi-square,
and then df is decreased by 1 for each
variable set for each remaining chi-
square.
These indicate how much each item in Set
1 is weighted to create the linear
combinations used in each of the two
canonical correlations (canonical variates).
These indicate how much each item in
Set 2 is weighted to create each of the
two canonical variates for Set 2.

multivariate normality, and homoscedasticity because there
does not appear to be a pattern in the scatterplots, and there
are not large differences in how spread out each scatterplot is.

Chapter 10 - Multivariate Analysis of Variance
Interpretation of Output 10.4a and 10.4b
The first two matrices, Correlations for Set-1 and Correlations for Set-2, are ordinary correlation
tables. The first matrix is for the variables in Set 1, and the second matrix is for the variables in Set 2. We
can see from these tables that most variables in each set are weakly to moderately correlated with each
other.
The next matrix is the Correlations Between Set-1 and Set-2, which contains the bivariate correlations
between each variable in Set 1 and each variable in Set 2.
The Canonical Correlations are the correlations between a linear combination of the Set 1 variables and
a linear combination of the Set 2 variables (the canonical variates). Note that there are two different
correlations, corresponding to two different pairs of linear combinations. By squaring and summing all
canonical correlations, you can calculate a measure of/?2 indicating how much variance in one set of
variables is explained by the other set of variables. Thus, (.6452 = .416) + (3.682 = .135) = .551, so about
55% of the variance is shared.
One important part of the output to check is the Test that remaining correlations are zero. These chi-
square goodness-of-fit tests indicate whether all correlations from that point on are significant, even after
removing variance accounted for by all prior correlations.
The Standardized Canonical Coefficients can be interpreted much like regression weights, to show
which items are weighted most heavily in the linear combination of variables for each set of variables.
These weights are created so as to maximize the correlation between the two sets of variables. For
example, the first canonical variate for Set 1 is created by weighting itemOl most heavily (-.838),
followed by itemO? (-.259), item!2 (-.047) and item!3 (-.011). This canonical variate is then correlated
with the canonical variate created by weighting item03 by -.972 and item09 by -.077 (see table of
loadings in the output). The set of canonical coefficients in the second column is the set used for the
second pair of canonical variates, which are correlated to produce the second canonical correlation. Thus,
there are actually two linear combinations for each set of variables. These are derived, much like principal
components analysis, by creating the linear combination for each set of variables that maximizes the
correlation between the two sets of variables, then doing this again with what remains after the variance
associated with the first correlation is removed, and so on. These coefficients are often called pattern
coefficients.
Canonical Loadings are the correlations between each item and the linear combinations of variables for
that same set (canonical variates). They are often called structure coefficients. These loadings aid in the
interpretation of the correlations, much as the loadings in principal components analysis are interpreted to
give meaning to the different components.
Cross Loadings for each set indicate the correlation between each item in one variable set and the
canonical variate for the other variable set. In the Cross Loadings for Set-2, we can see that both items
for Set 2 are negatively correlated with the Set 1 canonical variate for the first canonical correlation.

Results
Canonical correlation analysis was performed to assess the pattern of relationships between the
motivation items and the competence items. The first canonical correlation was .65 (42% overlapping
variance); the second was .37 (14% overlapping variance). With both canonical correlations included,
%2(8) = 46.18,/? < .001, and with the first removed, %2(3) = 9.81,/? = .02. The correlations and canonical
coefficients are included in Table 10.3. Examination of the loadings suggests that first canonical

correlation seems to involve a relation between practicing math a lot, independently, and becoming
efficient (quick) at math; whereas, the second seems to capture a relation between persistence and
thoroughness and being very competent at math.

Quick Reference Guide to SPSS Procedures
Joan Naden Clay
Introduction
The Quick Reference Guide is intended as a supplemental resource to use while the SPSS
program is open. It provides a brief overview of commonly utilized procedures in SPSS as well
as the statistical procedures covered in Morgan, Leech, Gloeckner, and Barrett (2004). This guide
presents one basic method for accomplishing each command; however, there are often multiple
ways to accomplish any given task in SPSS. The intent of this guide is to provide a brief
description of each subject area in addition to giving step-by-step directions for performing
specific actions for each subject.
Throughout the Quick Reference Guide, each subject area (e.g., variable, cell, file) is organized
alphabetically and written In ALL CAPITAL, BOLD ITALICS. Common actions (e.g., cut,
paste, insert) are itemized for each subject and are indicated with an arrow. Stepwise instructions
for functions are designated with a round bullet. Items within the stepwise directions that are
bolded either represent window items that require you to make a selection or indicate that the user
should select the item with the click of the mouse. Each step of a function is sequentially
represented with arrows. For example, the instructions to Open a File would be: File (select the
word "file" in the header) => Open (select the word "open" in the drop down window) => Data
(select the word "data" in the subsequent drop-down menu) =>using the Files of Type pull-down
menu (click the arrow on the "Files of Type" window to get the drop-down menu), choose the
type of data file to bring into SPSS=>locate the file=>double click on the file name.
SPSS Commands
ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA) is used to compare two or more independent groups on
the dependent variable. Sample means are compared in order to infer whether the means of the
corresponding population distributions also differ. ANOVA allows for several means to be
compared.
> 
One-Way ANOVA (single factor analysis of variance) is used when you have one
independent variable with a few nominal levels and one normally distributed dependent
variable.
â¢ 
Analyze => Compare Means => One-Way ANOVA => select one or more dependent
variables with a left click and move them into the Dependent List box by clicking the
top arrow in the middle of the dialog box => select the independent variable with a left
click and move it into the Factor (independent variable) box by clicking the bottom
arrow in the middle of the dialog box => Options => choose Descriptives and
Homogeneity of variance test => Continue => OK.
>â¢ Two-Way (Factorial) ANOVA is used when there are two different independent variables
with a few nominal levels, a between groups design, and one normally distributed dependent
variable.
188

Appendix A - Quick Reference Guide
â¢ 
Analyze => General Linear Model => Univariate => select the dependent variable
with a left click and move it into the Dependent Variable box by clicking the top arrow
in the middle of the dialog box => select the independent variables with a left click and
move them into the Fixed Factor(s) box by clicking the arrow in the middle of the dialog
box => Options => select Descriptive statistics, Estimates of effect size, and
Homogeneity tests => Continue => Plots => select one of the factors (independent
variable) with a left click and move it to the Horizontal Axis box by clicking the top
arrow in the middle of the dialog box => select the remaining factor (independent
variable) with a left click and move it to the Separate Lines box by clicking on the
middle arrow in the center of the dialog box => Continue => OK.
BAR CHARTS 
Bar charts are useful for displaying frequency information for categorical data,
and SPSS allows several options for creating them. Types of bar charts available include: simple
(presents a single bar for each category, case, or variable); clustered (presents a group of bars on
the category axis, and bars within a cluster can represent groups of cases, separate variables, or
individual cases); and stacked (there is one bar stack for each category, case, or variable on the
category axis and segments of each stack can represent groups of cases, separate variables, or
individual cases).
â¢ 
Graphs => Bar => select type of chart (simple, clustered, or stacked) => choose if the
Data in Chart are either summaries for groups of cases, summaries of separate variables,
or values of individual cases => Define => at this point, the dialog box varies based on
the type of chart and type of data to be displayed. Highlight variables and move them to
the appropriate boxes (bars represent, category axis, define clusters by, define stacks
by, etc.) by clicking the arrows. For summaries of groups of cases, choose if each Bar
Represents the number of cases, cumulative cases, percent of cases, cumulative percent
of cases, or other summary function => Titles => type in title, subtitles, and footnotes =>
Continue => OK.
BOX PLOTS This type of graphic provides a visual display of the distribution of data by presenting
the median, quartiles, and extreme values for the category or variable. Box plots can be simple
(with a single box plot for each category or variable) or clustered [with 2 or more plots for each
category or variable on the category axis, and each plot within a cluster being defined by another
definition (grouping) variable]. Box plots are automatically generated by the Explore command or
can be custom generated with the Graphs command.
â¢ 
Graphs => Boxplot => select type of plot (simple or clustered) => choose if the Data in
Chart Are either summaries for groups of cases or summaries of separate variables =>
Define => at this point, the dialog box varies based on the type of chart and type of data to
be presented. Highlight variables and move them to the appropriate boxes (variable,
category axis, define clusters by, label cases by, or boxes represent) => OK.
CASES are the individual records for each subject and are organized by rows for each record/case.
SPSS numbers each case down the left side of the Data View window. All of the data for each
participant should be entered as one row of information.
> Insert Cases This command allows data to be added for new subjects or cases anywhere in the
data set.
189

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
â¢ 
Click on the case number below where the case is to be inserted => Data => Insert Cases
=> enter data for the new case.
> List Cases (Case Summaries) This command allows the user to list either an entire dataset or a
subset of the data. Case summaries are especially helpful for ensuring that data are computed or
entered correctly. Various options allow the user to select one or all variables, create an order
for listing the cases using a grouping variable, limit the number of cases shown, and conduct
basic descriptive statistics on the cases selected.
â¢ 
Analyze => Reports -> Case Summaries => select variables to be summarized with a left
click => click the top arrow in the middle of the dialog box to move the selected variable to
the Variables box => if desired, select categorical variables with a left click => click the
bottom arrow in the middle of the dialog box to move the selected variable to the Grouping
Variables box => utilize check boxes in lower left comer to display individual cases, limit
number of cases shown, show valid cases or show case numbers => Statistics => highlight
desired statistic with a left click => click the arrow in the middle of the dialog to move the
selected statistic to the Cell Statistics box => Continue => OK.
> Select Cases The select cases command permits the analysis of a specific subset of the data.
Once a subset is selected, the user can either revert back to the entire dataset or delete the
unselected cases to create a subset data file. Users can Select data in a variety of ways
including: If condition is satisfied (a conditional expression is used to select cases); Random
sample of cases (cases are selected randomly based upon a percent or number of cases); Based
on time or case range (case selection is based upon a range of case numbers or a range of
dates/tune); or, Use filter variable (a numeric variable can be used as the filter - any cases with
a value other than 0 or missing are selected). Unselected cases may be Filtered (remain in data
file, but excluded in the analysis) or Deleted (removed from the working data file and cannot be
recovered if the data file is saved after the deletion). If you want to do the same analysis
separately on all subsets of data, then Split File should be used instead of Select Cases (see
below)
â¢ 
Data => Select Cases => Select (choose method: all cases, if condition is satisfied, random
sample of cases, range, filter variable) => Unselected cases are (choose either filtered or
deleted) => OK (Save your work before deleting cases, just in case you change your mind!).
> Sort Cases This procedure allows the user to rearrange the order in which data are displayed
using one or more variables of interest. Data can be sorted in ascending (small to large
numbers or alphabetical) or descending (large to small numbers or reverse alphabetical) order.
â¢ 
Data => Sort Cases => select a variable with a left click => click the arrow in the middle of
the dialog box to move the variable to the Sort By list => choose either the Ascending or
Descending display => OK.
CELLS A cell is a single data point where a row and column intersect within the dataset. Cells can
be manipulated individually or in blocks. Data can be edited using Copy (puts a duplicate of the
cell value(s) on the clipboard, but leaves original cells in place), Cut (puts the cell value(s) on the
clipboard and deletes the original cell values), or Paste (inserts cell value(s) from the clipboard into
cell(s) at a new location).

CHI-SQUARE allows the user to determine whether there is a statistically significant
relationship between two nominal variables. This test compares the observed and expected
frequencies in each category to test whether all the categories contain the same proportion of
values. The chi-square test does not indicate the strength (effect size) of a statistically significant
relationship. The optional Phi and Cramer's V tests can be used as a measure of effect size.

COUNT creates a new variable that counts the occurrences of a given value in a list of variables
for each case. This is often used to devise a variable indicating how many responses a participant
checked (e.g., when asked to check which of the following were reasons, the person selected a
particular brand or product) or how many times a person said, "yes" to a series of related
questions (e.g., questions asking if the participant experienced particular risk factors in
development).

FILES There are three different common file types in SPSS (data, output, and syntax) that are
differentiated with unique file extensions (data = .sav; output = .spo; syntax = .sps). Script is a
fourth type of SPSS file and is designated with a .sbs extension; however, discussion of script
files is beyond the scope of this appendix. Each of the different file types will open in its own
type of window. Data files are presented in the SPSS Data Editor window, output files are
displayed in the SPSS Viewer, and syntax is viewed in the SPSS Syntax Editor. (Only one data
file can be open in any one session.)

Merge Files allows the working data file to be combined with a second data file that contains
the same variables but different cases or the same cases but different variables. Before you
add variables to a file using this method, you should first make sure that each participant is
identified by the same ID number in both files. Then, you should use Sort Cases to sort each
file (by itself), sequentially in ascending order, saving each file once it is sorted. Then, you
should make sure that you open the data file first that has the correct values of any variables
that exist in both data sets. SPSS will save only one copy of each variable, and that will be
the one that is in the first (working data) file. Now, you are ready to merge files.
â¢ 
Open the first data file => Data => Merge Files => Add Cases (or Add Variables)=>
use the drop-down arrow for the Look in box to select the appropriate drive => select the
data file to merge with the open file with a left click => Open => remove any variables
you do not want from the Variables in the New Working Data File list. If you are
adding variables, you should make sure that they are being added to the correct
participants by checking Match cases on key variables in sorted files. (In order to do
this, both files must have data that are arranged sequentially by the key variable, usually
ID, as indicated above) move ID or other key variable to key variables box => OK.

Although the toolbar at the top of the data editor screen is the same for both the Variable and
Data View screens, it is important to notice the differences between these two screens found
within the data editor in features and functions (compare Fig. B.4 and Fig. B.5).
â¢ 
Click on the Variable View tab in the data editor screen to produce Fig. B.4.
Notice the column names in Fig. B.4. You define and label new variables using the Variable
View.

â¢ 
Click on the Data View tab in the data editor to produce Fig. B.5.
Notice the columns change to var or to the names of your variables if you have already entered
them. (See Fig. B.5.) You enter (input) the data using the Data View.

Appendix B - Getting Started and Printing Syntax
Set Your Computer to Print the SPSS Syntax (Log)
In order to have your computer print the SPSS commands on your output, as shown throughout
the book, you will need to set your computer using the following:
â¢ 
Click on Edit => Options.
â¢ 
Click on the Viewer tab window to get Fig. B.6.
Figure B.6. Options.
â¢ 
Check Display commands in the log near the lower left of the window.
â¢ 
Leave the other defaults as is.
â¢ 
Click on OK. Doing this will always print the syntax on your output until this box is
unchecked.
Define the Variables
The following section will help you name and label variables. To do this, we need to use the
Variable View screen. If you are in Data View, there are two ways to get to Variable View:
â¢ 
Click on the Variable View tab at the bottom left of your screen (see Fig. B.3). In SPSS 10-
12, this will bring up a screen similar to Fig. B.7. OR double click on var above the blank
column to the far left side of the data matrix.
Fig. B.7. Blank variable view screen.
In this window, you will see ten sections that will allow you to input the variable name, type,
width, decimals, label, values, missing (data), columns (width), align (data left or right), and
measurement type.
209

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
Important: This is new to SPSS version 10. If you have SPSS 9 or a lower version, you will not
have the Variable View screen option and will have to enter the variable information differently.
Please refer to your SPSS Help menu for further information in lower versions.
To label a variable, follow these commands:
â¢ 
Click in the blank box directly under Name.
â¢ 
Type the name of the variable in the box directly beneath Name (see Fig. B.7.). Notice the
number 1 to the left of this box. This indicates mat you are entering your first variable. SPSS
11.5 and earlier versions allow only eight letters for the name. SPSS 12 allows as many as
you wish, although we recommend keeping the name fairly short in order to make the outputs
easier to read.
â¢ 
Press enter. This will move your cursor to the next box, under Type, and pop up the
information for Type, Width, etc.
â¢ 
The Type indicates whether the variable levels are numbers or are letters. Usually, you will
use numeric.
â¢ 
Width indicates how wide the columns should be based on the number of characters allowed
in the column.
â¢ 
Decimals are the number of decimals that will be shown in the data view window.
â¢ 
Labels gives a longer name for the variable.
â¢ 
Values indicate labels for the levels of the variable.
â¢ 
Missing indicates any special values for missing data. The SPSS system missing uses a
blank. If only blanks are used for missing, this column will say "none" for no missing values.
â¢ 
Columns defines the number of spaces for the variable in the data view window.
â¢ 
Align indicates how you want the data aligned in the data view window.
â¢ 
Measure shows the type of variable: nominal, ordinal, or scale.
Label the Levels for the Variables
For variables that are nominal or dichotomous it is important to label the levels so that you will
know the group referred to by each number. For example, with the variable of gender, the levels
are male and female, so you might label males as "1" and females as "2". To do this, follow these
commands:
â¢ 
Under Values, click on the small gray box with ... (three dots) to get Fig. B.8.
â¢ 
In the Value Labels window, type 1 in the Value box, male in the Value Label box, and then
click Add. Do the same for 2 = female. The Value Labels window should resemble Fig. B.8
just before you click Add for the second time.
Fig. B.8. Value labels window.

Appendix B - Getting Started and Printing Syntax
Print a Dictionary or Codebook
Now that you have defined and labeled your variables, you can print a codebook or dictionary of
your variables. It is a very useful record of what you have done. Notice that the information in the
codebook is essentially the same as that in the variable view (Fig. B.4) so you do not really have
to have both, but the codebook makes a more complete printed record of your labels and values.
â¢ 
Select File => Display Data File Information => Working File. Your Dictionary or
Codebook should look like Output B.I, without the callout boxes.

SPSS for Introductory Statistics
APPENDIX C
Making Tables and Figures
Don Quick
Tables and figures are used in most fields of study to provide a visual presentation of important
information to the reader. They are used to organize the statistical results of a study, to list
important tabulated information, and to allow the reader a visual method of comparing related
items. Tables offer a way to detail information that would be difficult to describe in the text.
A figure may be just about anything that is not a table, such as a chart, graph, photograph, or line
drawing. These figures may include pie charts, line charts, bar charts, organizational charts, flow
charts, diagrams, blueprints, or maps. Unless the figure can dramatically illustrate a comparison
that a table cannot, use a table. A good rule is to use a table for numbers and text and to use
figures for visual presentations.
The meaning and major focus of the table or figure should be evident to the readers without them
having to make a thorough study of it. A glance should be all it takes for the idea of what the
table or figure represents to be conveyed to the reader. By reading only the text itself, the reader
may have difficulty understanding the data; by constructing tables and figures that are well
presented, the readers will be able to understand the study results more easily.
The purpose of this appendix is to provide guidelines that will enhance the presentation of
research findings and other information by using tables and figures. It will highlight the
important aspects of constructing tables and figures using the Publication Manual of the
American Psychological Association, Fifth Edition (2001) as the guide for formatting.
General Considerations Concerning Tables
Be selective as to how many tables are included in the total document. Determine how much data
the reader needs to comprehend the material, and then decide if the information would be better
presented in the text or as a table. A table containing only a few numbers is unnecessary; whereas
a table containing too much information may not be understandable. Tables should be easy to
read and interpret. If at all possible, combine tables that repeat data.
Keep a consistency to all of your tables throughout your document. All tables and figures in your
document should use a similar format, with the results organized in a comparable fashion. Use
the same designation measure or scale in all tables, figures, and the text.
In a final manuscript such as a thesis or dissertation, adjust the column headings or spacing
between columns so the width of the table fits appropriately between the margins. Fit all of one
table on one page. Reduce the data, change the type size, or decrease line spacing to make it fit.
A short table may be on a page with text, as long as it follows the first mention of it. Each long
table is on a separate page immediately after it is mentioned in the text. If the fit and appearance
would be improved, turn the table sideways (landscape orientation, with the top of table toward
the spine) on the page.
213

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
Each table and figure must be discussed in the text. An informative table will supplement but not
duplicate the text. In the text, discuss only the most important parts of the table. Make sure the
table can be understood by itself without the accompanying text; however, it is never
independent of the text. There must be a reference in the text to the table.
Construction of the Table
Table C.I is an example of an APA table for displaying simple descriptive data collected in a
study. It also appears in correct relation to the text of the document. (Fig. C.I shows the same
table with the table parts identified.) The major parts of a table are: the number, the title, the
headings, the body, and the notes.

a No participants were found for the over 80 group.
Table Numbering
Arabic numerals are used to number tables in the order in which they appear in the text. Do NOT
write in the text "the table on page 17" or "the table above or below." The correct method would
be to refer to the table number like this: (see Table 1) or "Table 1 shows..." Left-justify the table
number (see Table C.I). In an article, each table should be numbered sequentially in the order of
appearance. Do not use suffix letters with the table numbers in articles. However, in a book table
numbers may be numbered within chapters; e.g. Table 7.1. If the table appears in an appendix,
identify it with the letter of the appendix capitalized, followed by the table number; for instance
Table C.3 is the third table in Appendix C.
214

Appendix C - Making Tables and Figures
Table Titles
Include the variables, the groups on whom the data were collected, the subgroups, and the nature
of the statistic reported. The table title and headings should concisely describe what is contained
in the table. Abbreviations that appear in the body of the table can sometimes be explained in the
title, however, it may be more appropriate to use a general note (see also comments below on
Table Headings). The title must be italicized. Standard APA format for journal submission
requires double spacing throughout. However, tables hi student papers may be partially single
spaced for belter presentation.

Table Headings
Headings are used to explain the organization of the table. You may use abbreviations in the
headings; however, include a note as to their meaning if you use mnemonics, variable names, and
scale acronyms. Standard abbreviations and symbols for non technical terms can be used without
explanation (e.g., no. for number or % for percent). Have precise title, column headings, and row
labels that are accurate and brief. Each column must have a heading, including the stub column,
or leftmost column. Its heading is referred to as the stubhead. The stub column usually lists the
significant independent variables or the levels of the variable, as in Table C.I.
The column heads cover one column, and the column spanners cover two or more columns â
each with its own column head (see Table C.I and Fig. C.I). Headings stacked in this manner are
called decked heads. This is a good way to eliminate repetition in column headings but try to
215

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
avoid using more than two levels of decked heads. Column heads, column spanners, and
stubheads should all be singular, unless referring to a group (e.g., children). Table spanners,
which cover the entire table, may be plural. Use sentence capitalization in all headings.
Notice that there are no vertical lines in an APA style table. The horizontal lines can be added by
using a "draw" feature or a "borders" feature for tables in the computer word processor, or they
could be drawn in by hand if typed. If translating from an SPSS Table or box, the vertical lines
must be removed.
The Body of the Table
The body contains the actual data being displayed. Round numbers improve the readability and
clarity more than precise numbers with several decimal places. A good guideline is to report two
digits more than the raw data. A reader can compare numbers down a column more easily than
across a row. Column and row averages can provide a visual focus that allows the reader to
inspect the data easily without cluttering the table. If a cell cannot be filled because the
information is not applicable, then leave it blank. If it cannot be filled because the information
could not be obtained, or was not reported, then insert a dash and explain the dash with a note to
the table.
Notes to a Table
Notes are often used with tables. There are three different forms of notes used with tables: a) to
eliminate repetition in the body of the table, b) to elaborate on the information contained in a
particular cell, or c) to indicate statistical significance:
â¢ A general note provides information relating to the table as a whole, including
explanations of abbreviations used:
Note. This could be used to indicate if the table came from another source.
â¢ A specific note makes a reference to a specific row or column or cell of the table and is
given superscript lowercase letters, beginning with the letter "a":
*n = 50. Specific notes are identified in the body with superscript.
â¢ A probability note is to be included when one or more inferential statistic has been
computed and there isn't a column showing the probability, p. Asterisk(s) indicate the
statistical significance of findings presented within the table. Try to be consistent across
all tables in a paper. The important thing is to use the fewest asterisks for the largest p
value. It is common to use one asterisk for .05 and two for .01. For example:
*/?<.05. 
**/?<.01.
Notes should be listed with general notes first, then specific notes, and concluded with
probability notes, without indentation. They may be single spaced for better presentation.
Explain all uses of dashes and parentheses. Abbreviations for technical terms, group names, and
those of a similar nature must be explained in a note to the table.

In an APA table the Heads should be center aligned in the cell and the Stubs are left aligned.
The numbers in the Cell are decimal aligned and centered under the Heads. Notice also that
"Between groups" wrapped. Let's first align the Heads and Stubs, then fix that wrap and finally
align the data off of the Heads. To center align the Heads:
â¢ 
Select the Header Row of your table by clicking anywhere hi the top row and Table =>
Select => Row.
â¢ 
Click the Center align button in the Formatting Toolbar, see Fig. C.8.
â¢ 
The stub column should already be left aligned; if not, then select the cells and click the
Align Left button.

220

Appendix C - Making Tables and Figures
When MS Word creates a table it will generally make all of the columns the same width. To fix
the wrap on the "Between groups" cell, that column will need to be widened slightly and then to
keep the table within the margins the data columns will need to be decreased slightly. This may
be a trail and error process to get the right spacing for your text.
Click anywhere on the Stubs column.

Click OK.
Note: This can also be accomplished
by dragging the vertical column
separator lines until the "Between
groups" is not wrapped and then
dragging the other column separator
lines so that they are within the
margins. However this produces
uneven column spaces. We
recommend the method outlined.

Adjusting the SPSS Output to Approximate the APA Format
The preceding example shows how the standard SPSS output can be used to create a table in
APA format. However, this does require some knowledge of your word processing program's
table creation capabilities in order to accomplish this task. It also requires retyping the data into
the table. You can adjust SPSS so that the output will approximate the APA format. We would
not recommend submitting this to an APA journal, but it may be acceptable for student papers
and some graduate program committees.
In SPSS follow these commands BEFORE running your SPSS analysis of your data:
â¢ Click Edit => Options.
â¢ Under the Pivot Tables tab select Academic 2.tlo (see Fig. C. 11).
â¢ Press OK.

Using Figures
Generally, the same concepts apply to figures as have been previously stated concerning tables:
they should be easy to read and interpret, be consistent throughout the document when presenting
the same type of figure, kept on one page if possible, and it should supplement the accompanying
text or table. Considering the numerous types of figures, I will not attempt to detail their
construction in this document. However, one thing is consistent with all figures. The figure
224

Appendix C - Making Tables and Figures
number and caption description are located below the figure and the description is detailed,
similar to that of the title of a table. See Fig. C.12.
Some cautions in using figures:
1) Make it simple. Complex diagrams that require lengthy explanation should be avoided

APPENDIX D
Answers to Odd Interpretation Questions
1.1 What is the difference between the independent variable and the dependent variable?
Independent variables are predictors, antecedents, or presumed causes or influences being
studied. Differences in the Independent variable are hypothesized to affect, predict, or
explain differences in the dependent or outcome variable. So, independent variables are
predictor variables; whereas dependent variables are the variables being predicted, or
outcome variables.
1.3 What kind of independent variable is necessary to infer cause? Can one always infer
cause from this type of independent variable? If so, why? If not, when can one clearly
infer cause and when might causal inferences be more questionable? A variable must be
an active independent variable in order for the possibility to exist of one's inferring that it
caused the observed changes in the dependent variable. However, even if the independent
variable is active, one can not attribute cause to it in many cases. The strongest inferences
about causality can be made when one randomly assigns participants to experimentally
manipulated conditions and there are no pre-existing differences between the groups that
could explain the results. Causal inferences are much more questionable when manipulations
are given to pre-existing groups, especially when there is not pretest of the dependent variable
prior to the manipulation, and/or the control group receives no intervention at all, and/or there
is no control group.
1.5 Write three research questions and a corresponding hypothesis regarding variables of
interest to you, but not in the HSB data set (one associational, one difference, and one
descriptive question). Associational research question: What is the relation between guilt
and shame in 10-year-old children? Associational hypothesis: Guilt and shame are
moderately to highly related in 10 year-old children. Difference question: Are there
differences between Asian-Americans and European-Americans in reported self-esteem?
Difference hypothesis: Asian-Americans, on the average, report lower self-esteem than do
European-Americans. Descriptive question: What is the incidence of themes of violence in
popular songs, folk songs, and children's songs? Descriptive hypothesis: There will be more
violent themes in popular songs than in folk songs.
1.7 If you have categorical, ordered data (such as low income, middle income, high income),
what type of measurement would you have? Why? Categorical, ordered data would
typically be considered ordinal data because one can not assume equal intervals between
levels of the variable, there are few levels of the variable, and data are unlikely to be normally
distributed, but there is a meaningful order to the levels of the variable.
1.9 What percent of the area under the standard normal curve is between the mean and one
standard deviation above the mean? Thirty-four percent of the normal distribution is within
one standard deviation above the mean. Sixty-eight percent is within one standard deviation
above or below the mean.
2.1 Using Output 2.la and 2.1b: a) What is the mean visualization test score? 5.24 b) What is
the range for grades in h.s. ? 6 c) What is the minimum score for mosaic pattern test? -4
How does this compare to the values for that variable as indicated in chapter 1? It is the
226

Appendix D - Answers to Odd Interpretation Questions
lowest possible score. Why would this score be the minimum? It would be the minimum if
at least one person scored this, and this is the lowest score anyone made.
2.3 Using Output 2.4: a) Can you interpret the means? Explain. Yes, the means indicate the
percentage of participants who scored "1" on the measure, b) How many participants are
there all together? 75 c) How many have complete data (nothing missing)? 75 d) What
percent are male (ifmale=0)t 45 e) What percent took algebra 1119
2.5 In Output 2.8a: a) Why are matrix scatterplots useful? What assumption(s) are tested
by them? They help you check the assumption of linearity and check for possible difficulties
with multicollinearity.
3.1 a) Is there only one appropriate statistic to use for each research design? No.
b) Explain your answer. There may be more than one appropriate statistical analysis to use
with each design. Interval data can always use statistics used with nominal or ordinal data,
but you lose some power by doing this.
3.3 Interpret the following related to effect size:
a) d- .25 small 
c) R = .53 large 
e) d= 1.15 
very large
b)r=.35 medium 
d)r â.13 
small 
f)^=.38 
large
3.5. What statistic would you use if you had two independent variables, income group
(<$ 10,000, $10,000-$30,000, >$30,000) and ethnic group (Hispanic, Caucasian, African-
American), and one normally distributed dependent variable (self-efficacy at work).
Explain. Factorial ANOVA, because there are two or more between groups independent
variables and one normally distributed dependent variable. According to Table 3.3, column
2, first cell, I should use Factorial ANOVA or ANCOVA. In this case, both independent
variables are nominal, so I'd use Factorial ANOVA (see p. 49).
3.7 What statistic would you use if you had three normally distributed (scale) independent
variables and one dichotomous independent variable (weight of participants, age of
participants, height of participants and gender) and one dependent variable (positive
self-image), which is normally distributed. Explain. I'd use multiple regression, because
all predictors are either scale or dichotomous and the dependent variable is normally
distributed. I found this information in Table 3.4 (third column).
3.9 What statistic would you use if you had one, repeated measures, independent variable
with two levels and one nominal dependent variable? McNemar because the independent
variable is repeated and the dependent is nominal. I found this in the fourth column of Table
3.1.
3.11 What statistic would you use if you had three normally distributed and one
dichotomous independent variable, and one dichotomous dependent variable?
I would use logistic regression, according to Table 3.4, third column.
4.1 Using Output 4.1 to 4.3, make a table indicating the mean mteritem correlation and the
alpha coefficient for each of the scales. Discuss the relationship between mean interitem
correlation and alpha, and how this is affected by the number of items.
227

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
Scale
Motivation
Competence
Pleasure
Mean inter-item correlation
.386
.488
.373
Alpha
.791
.796
.688
The alpha is based on the inter-item correlations, but the number of items is important as
well. If there are a large number of items, alpha will be higher, and if there are only a few
items, then alpha will be lower, even given the same average inter-item correlation. In this
table, the fact mat both number of items and magnitude of inter-item correlations are
important is apparent. Motivation, which has the largest number of items (six), has an alpha
of .791, even though the average inter-item correlation is only .386. Even though the average
inter-item correlation of Competence is much higher (.488), the alpha is quite similar to that
for Motivation because there are only 4 items instead of 6. Pleasure has the lowest alpha
because it has a relatively low average inter-item correlation (.373) and a relatively small
number of items (4).
4.3 For the pleasure scale (Output 4.3), what item has the highest item-total correlation?
Comment on how alpha would change if that item were deleted. Item 14 (.649). The alpha
would decline markedly if Item 14 were deleted, because it is the item that is most highly
correlated with the other items.
4.5 Using Output 4.5: What is the interrater reliability of the ethnicity codes? What does
this mean? The interrater reliability is .858. This is a high kappa, indicating that the school
records seem to be reasonably accurate with respect to their information about students'
ethnicity, assuming that students accurately report their ethnicity (i.e., the school records are
in high agreement with students' reports). Kappa is not perfect, however (1.0 would be
perfect), indicating that there are some discrepancies between school records and students'
own reports of their ethnicity.
5.1 Using Output 5.1: a) Are the factors in Output 5.1 close to the conceptual composites
(motivation, pleasure, competence) indicated in Chapter 1 ? Yes, they are close to the
conceptual composites. The first factor seems to be a competence factor, the second factor a
motivation factor, and the third a (low) pleasure factor. However, ItemOl (I practice math
skills until I can do them well) was originally conceptualized as a motivation question, but it
had its strongest loading from the first factor (the competence factor), and there was a strong
cross-loading for item02 (I feel happy after solving a hard problem) on the competence
factor, b) How might you name the three factors in Output 5.1? Competence, motivation,
and (low) mastery pleasure c) Why did we use Factor Analysis, rather than Principal
Components Analysis for this exercise? We used Factor Analysis because we had beliefs
about underlying constructs that the items represented, and we wished to determine whether
these constructs were the best way of understanding the manifest variables (observed
questionnaire items). Factor analysis is suited to determining which latent variables seem to
explain the observed variables. In contrast, Principal Components Analysis is designed
simply to determine which linear combinations of variables best explain the variance and
covariation of the variables so that a relatively large set of variables can be summarized by a
smaller set of variables.
5.3 What does the plot in Output 5.2 tell us about the relation of mosaic to the other
variables and to component 1? Mosaic seems not to be related highly to the other variables
nor to component 1. How does this plot relate to the rotated component matrix? The plot
228

Appendix D - Answers to Odd Interpretation Questions
illustrates how the items are located in space in relation to the components in the rotated
component matrix.
6.1. In Output 6.1: a) What information suggests that we might have a problem of
collinearity? High intercorrelations among some predictor variables and some low tolerances
(< 1-R2) b) How does multicollinearity affect results? It can make it so that a predictor that
has a high zero-order correlation with the dependent variable is found to have little or no
relation to the dependent variable when the other predictors are included. This can be
misleading, in that it appears that one of the highly correlated predictors is a strong predictor
of the dependent variable and the other is not a predictor of the dependent variable, c) What
is the adjusted R2 and what does it mean? The adjusted R2 indicates the percentage of
variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables, after taking into
account such factors as the number of predictors, the sample size, and the effect size.
6.3 In Output 6.3. a) Compare the adjusted R2 for model 1 and model 2. What does this tell
you? It is much larger for Model 2 than for Model 1, indicating that grades in high school,
motivation, and parent education explain additional variance, over and above that explained
by gender, b) Why would one enter gender first? One might enter gender first because it
was known that there were gender differences in math achievement, and one wanted to
determine whether or not the other variables contributed to prediction of math achievement
scores, over and above the "effect" of gender.
7.1 Using Output 7.1: a) Which variables make significant contributions to predicting who
took algebra 2? Parent's education and visualization 
b) How accurate is the overall
prediction? 77.3% of participants are correctly classified, overall c) How well do the
significant variables predict who took algebra 2? 71.4% of those who took algebra 2 were
correctly classified by this equation, d) How about the prediction of who didn't take it?
82.5% of those who didn't take algebra 2 were correctly classified.
7.3 In Output 7.3: a) What do the discriminant function coefficients and the structure
coefficients tell us about how the predictor variables combine to predict who took
algebra 2? The function coefficients tell us how the variables are weighted to create the
discriminant function. In this case,parent's education and visual are weighted most highly.
The structure coefficients indicate the correlation between the variable and the discriminant
function. In this case,parent's education and visual are correlated most highly; however,
gender also has a substantial correlation with the discriminant function, b) How accurate is
the prediction/classification overall and for who would not take algebra 2? 76% were
correctly classified, overall. 80% of those who did not take algebra 2 were correctly
classified; whereas 71.4% of those who took algebra 2 were correctly classified, c) How do
the results in Output 7.3 compare to those in Output 7.1, in terms of success at
classifying and contribution of different variables to the equation?For those who took
algebra 2, the discriminant function and the logistic regression yield identical rates of
success; however, the rate of success is slightly lower for the discriminative function than the
logistic regression for those who did not take algebra 2 (and, therefore, for the overall
successful classification rate).
7.5 In Output 7.2: why might one want to do a hierarchical logistic regression?
One might want to do a hierarchical logistic regression if one wished to see how well one
predictor successfully distinguishes groups, over and above the effectiveness of other
predictors.
229

SPSS for Intermediate Statistics
8.1 In Output 8.1: a) Is the interaction significant? Yes b) Examine the profile plot of the
cell means that illustrates the interaction. Describe it in words. The profile plot indicates
that the "effect" of math grades on math achievement is different for students whose fathers
have relatively little education, as compared to those with more education. Specifically, for
students whose fathers have only a high school education (or less), there is virtually no
difference in math achievement between those who had high and low math grades; whereas
for those whose fathers have a bachelor's degree or more, those with higher math grades
obtain higher math achievement scores, and those with lower math grades obtain lower math
achievement scores, c) Is the main effect of father's education significant? Yes. Interpret
the eta squared. The eta squared of .243 (eta = .496) for father's education indicates that this
is, according to Cohen's criteria, a large effect. This indicates that the "effect" of the level of
fathers' education is larger than average for behavioral science research. However, it is
important to realize that this main effect is qualified by the interaction between father's
education and math grades d) How about the "effect" of math grades? The "effect" of math
grades also is significant. Eta squared is .139 for this effect (eta = .37), which is also a large
effect, again indicating an effect that is larger than average in behavioral research, e) Why
did we put the word effect in quotes? The word, "effect," is in quotes because since this is
not a true experiment, but rather is a comparative design that relies on attribute independent
variables, one can not impute causality to the independent variable, f) How might focusing
on the main effects be misleading? Focusing on the main effects is misleading because of
the significant interaction. In actuality, for students whose fathers have less education, math
grades do not seem to "affect" math achievement; whereas students whose fathers are highly
educated have higher achievement if they made better math grades. Thus, to say that math
grades do or do not "affect" math achievement is only partially true. Similarly, fathers'
education really seems to make a difference only for students with high math grades.
8.3 In Output 8.3: a) Are the adjusted main effects of gender significant? No. b) What are
the adjusted math achievement means (marginal means) for males and females? They are
12.89 for males and 12.29 for females c) Is the effect of the covariate (mothers)
significant? Yes d) What do a) and c) tell us about gender differences in math
achievement scores? Once one takes into account differences between the genders in math
courses taken, the differences between genders in math achievement disappear.
9.1 In Output 9.2: a) Explain the results in nontechnical terms Output 9.2a indicates that the
ratings that participants made of one or more products were higher man the ratings they made
of one or more other products. Output 9.2b indicates that most participants rated product 1
more highly than product 2 and product 3 more highly than product 4, but there was no clear
difference in ratings of products 2 versus 3.
9.3 In Output 93: a) Is the Mauchly sphericity test significant? Yes. Does this mean that the
assumption is or is not violated? It is violated, according to this test. If it is violated, what
can you do? One can either correct degrees of freedom using epsilon or one can use a
MANOVA (the multivariate approach) to examine the within-subjects variable b) How
would you interpret the F for product (within subjects)? This is significant, indicating
that participants rated different products differently. However, this effect is qualified by a
significant interaction between product and gender, c) Is the interaction between product
and gender significant? Yes. How would you describe it in non-technical terms? Males
rated different products differently, in comparison to females, with males rating some higher
and some lower than did females, d) Is there a significant difference between the genders?
No. Is a post hoc multiple comparison test needed? Explain. No post hoc test is needed for
gender, both because the effect is not significant and because there are only two groups, so
230

Appendix D - Answers to Odd Interpretation Questions
one can tell from the pattern of means which group is higher. For product, one could do post
hoc tests; however, in this case, since products had an order to them, linear, quadratic, and
cubic trends were examined rather than paired comparisons being made among means.
10.1 In Output lO.lb: a) Are the multivariate tests statistically significant? Yes. b) What
does this mean? This means that students whose fathers had different levels of education
differed on a linear combination of grades in high school, math achievement, and
visualization scores, c) Which individual dependent variables are significant in the
ANOVAs? Both grades in h.s., F(2, 70) = 4.09, p = .021 and math achievement, F(2, 70) =
7.88, p = .001 are significant, d) How are the results similar and different from what we
would have found if we had done three univariate one-way ANOVAs? Included in the
output are the very same 3 univariate one-way ANOVAs that we would have done.
However, in addition, we have information about how the father's education groups differ on
the three dependent variables, taken together. If the multivariate tests had not been
significant, we would not have looked at the univariate tests; thus, some protection for Type I
error is provided. Moreover, the multivariate test provides information about how each of the
dependent variables, over and above the other dependent variables, distinguishes between the
father's education groups. The parameter estimates table provides information about how
much each variable was weighted in distinguishing particular father's education groups.
10.3 In Output 103: a) What makes this a "doubly multivariate" design? This is a doubly
multivariate design because it involves more than one dependent variable, each of which is
measured more than one time, b) What information is provided by the multivariate tests
of significance that is not provided by the univariate tests? The multivariate tests indicate
how the two dependent variables, taken together, distinguish the intervention and comparison
group, the pretest from the posttest, and the interaction between these two variables. Only it
indicates how each outcome variable contributes, over and above the other outcome variable,
to our understanding of the effects of the intervention, c) State in your own words what the
interaction between time and group tells you. This significant interaction indicates that the
change from pretest to posttest is different for the intervention group than the comparison
group. Examination of the means indicates that this is due to a much greater change from
pretest to posttest in Outcome 1 for the intervention group than the comparison group. What
implications does this have for understanding the success of the intervention? This
suggests that the intervention was successful in changing Outcome 1. If the intervention
group and the comparison group had changed to the same degree from pretest to posttest, this
would have indicated that some other factor was most likely responsible for the change in
Outcome 1 from pretest to posttest. Moreover, if there had been no change from pretest to
posttest in either group, then any difference between groups would probably not be due to the
intervention. This interaction demonstrates exactly what was predicted, that the intervention
affected the intervention group, but not the group that did not get the intervention (the
comparison group).
