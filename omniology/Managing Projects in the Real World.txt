How to Figure 
Out  What’s 
Really Going On
One common challenge all project managers (PMs) face is just how to figure 
out what’s really going on. I’m not talking about the politically correct spin the 
marketing representative is putting on for her boss. I’m talking about the real 
deal—the lay of the land, if you will. How comprehensive is the project plan? 
Is work really preceding at a fast enough pace? What does the Engineering 
Manager think of this latest feature? Will anyone be working this weekend?
All of these bits of information flotsam and jetsam are available if you know 
how to go about finding them. What about that backchannel of information 
you can sense out of the corner of your eye but have no clue about the 
information that’s actually exchanged there? Inserting yourself into the back-
channel information flow is tricky and not everyone understands just how 
to do this.
What about stakeholders? Just how do you go about figuring out who the 
important ones are? It turns out that there’s a systematic way to figure 
that out.
Oh, and let’s not forget about requirements! Are they frozen solid, slightly 
slushy, or viscous and loose? How do you figure that out, huh?

Inserting  Yourself into the Backchannel
Okay, have you ever gotten the feeling that everyone knows what’s going on 
before you do? How about that niggling feeling that you’re somehow out of 
step with everyone else on the program? Key decisions get kicked around and 
decided upon in hallway conversations by an in-crowd that you’re not a part of? 
Yeah, me too, and it feels like a bad high school flashback, doesn’t it? Whenever 
I get that feeling, it’s a sure sign that there’s a backchannel information flow 
that I’m not a part of. In a perfect world all I would have to do is walk up and 
say, “Hey, I need to know that information too! Can we have a formal meeting 
with minutes, agendas, action items, and everyone in the organization to discuss 
these very important issues?” However, here in my reality that never works 
and in fact that strategy usually makes the situation worse. Whatever your 
reality is, you have to be successful in your current environment. And in this 
type of environment, you have to figure out how to insert yourself into that 
backchannel information flow as smoothly and as silently as possible.
Many folks are honestly intimidated by that in-crowd and uncertain of just 
how you get yourself into that backchannel. But here’s the thing, when we’re 
stuck and can’t figure out how to move forward, we often want to change the 
environment when it would be more productive to change ourselves. Trust 
me, when faced with this situation, the most productive thing you can do is 
change your tactics. To be honest, it’s really not that hard to get into that  
hidden information flow, but there are a few dos and don’ts…
DO
• 
Read Susan RoAne’s book, How to Work a Room.1 
This little gem will give you the specific strategies for 
worming your way into any conversation. She gives you 
step-by-step instructions for inserting yourself into a 
group discussion—and this stuff really works. Practice 
her techniques a few times and being ignored in the hall-
way will be a thing of the past.
• 
Bait the lure. Publish data the decision makers care 
about. Advertise the work your team does so that when 
impacts to potential strategies are being kicked around, 
your name comes up as the subject matter expert (SME) 
for your area. Basically what I’m saying here is—throw 
out tantalizing tidbits of information those decision mak-
ers need and before you know it, you’ll be pulled into 
those backchannel conversations.

• 
Give off a friendly and collaborative vibe. You want 
to be seen as a collaborative problem solver not as some-
one who has to be “convinced.” Instead of saying, “Are 
you on crack? No, we can’t do that!”—try something 
like this: “Sure that sounds interesting. Let me do some 
research and get back to you.” In this way, you are aligning 
yourself with the in-crowd instead of setting yourself up 
as a roadblock, all without being a yes-man.
• 
Demonstrate your integrity to build trust. Don’t 
gossip or spread rumors about decisions that are not 
done deals; likewise do not divulge confidential information. 
How many times have you heard rumors about a strate-
gic decision being made that in the end was not true? If 
you want to stay in the backchannel then you need to pay 
attention and use some discretion.
DON’T
• 
Make a lot of noise and demand to be included. 
This is a situation where a little stealth and emotional 
maturity are needed. People get to choose whom they 
interact with, so become someone they want to col-
laborate with, not someone they are actively avoiding. 
Obviously I’m not advocating perfecting your toadying 
behavior; instead try for friendly and avoid any hint of an 
emotional rollercoaster. You can scream your little heart 
out on the drive home.
• 
Think more meetings and minutes are the answer. 
Meetings are great for getting work done, but demanding 
additional meetings to get information will not endear 
you to those already inhabiting the backchannel. Think 
about this for a minute. How willing am I going to be 
to share information with you if I’ve got to attend yet 
another meeting with a weak agenda and nothing in it for 
me? Not very, right? And when you factor in the likeli-
hood that these additional meetings are going to fall over 
my lunch hour or my commute, then you really have a 
snowball’s chance of getting me to voluntarily include you 
in the backchannel. Same goes for asking me to write up 
minutes from a casual conversation I just had with the 
graphic designer. I’ve got plenty to do and drafting more 
documentation that only a handful of folks need is not 

Chapter 1 | How to Figure Out  What’s Really Going On

high on my personal “to do” list. Remember, no hallway 
meeting produces minutes. See what I mean?
• 
Be a suck-up. That’s right, you won’t get the right kind of 
respect if you’re always agreeing and gushing with praise. 
Be sincere and if you don’t think the decision being kicked 
around is a good one, then challenge it constructively.
Extra-points hint
■
■
  Never, never, never try to bring in tasty treats as a way to bribe your way  
into the backchannel . . . That never works and it completely undermines what little authority you  
might have.
And finally, the MacDaddy of all don’ts…
• 
Don’t make this situation into more than it is. I’m 
betting that you have plenty of stuff to work on without 
worrying about what’s being decided in those hallway 
conversations. Stay focused on what you have to do and 
don’t worry so much about being out of the loop. In the 
end, if your input is critical to the decision, then they will 
come to you. If you’re input isn’t critical to the decision, 
then, frankly, it’s time to just get over yourself and get 
some other work done.
There you have it: a few tips to get you started. If you’re following them, then 
eventually you will wake up one day and find yourself in that backchannel. 
This kind of thing takes time and can’t really be forced, so relax and just give 
it your best shot. The benefits of being in that backchannel of information will 
be worth the extra effort you put in to get there—and remember, when you 
finally get there, be open to pulling others into that backchannel. I hope this 
has given you some actionable ideas for how to get into that hidden informa-
tion stream that flourishes from time to time in any large organization.
Figuring Out  Who  Your Stakeholders  Are
The term stakeholder management is one of those insider jokes, right? I mean, 
you understand what each individual word means and you have a sense of 
what the other person is talking about, but you still don’t have a clue how to 
go about it. You hear that it’s a critical thing to do all the time, right? But here’s 
the kicker—does anyone ever tell you how you’re supposed to do it? Nope!

I finally figured out that most people talk a good game when it comes to 
stakeholder management but frankly don’t know what they are doing or why 
they are doing it. I used to consider an email from a stakeholder acknowledg-
ing the requirements, test criteria, functional requirements, and so forth as 
sufficient to “manage” them. This is sadly not the case. I’ve since come to 
realize that true stakeholder management is a constant and generally fruitful 
activity, not unlike sustaining your network. Oh, and you can’t really “manage” 
their expectations until you figure out just who they are. So, in an effort to 
clue everyone in on the joke (which isn’t really a joke at all), here’s how you 
get started. There’s a very simple method for determining who your stake-
holders are and, as long as you go about it in a systematic way, you should have 
no trouble at all.
Melanie’s Stakeholder Identification Method:
1.	 Fire up Excel and create a new workbook (Figure 1-1). 
Add the following headers:
• 
Key Stakeholder?
• 
Name
• 
Role on the Project
• 
Org
• 
Location/Timezone
• 
Official Project Team Member?
• 
Resource Manager?
• 
Budget Owner?
• 
Influencer and/or Technical Expert?
• 
Deliverable Provider?
• 
Deliverable Customer?
• 
Final Release Approver?

2.	 List everyone who is officially assigned to the project or 
attends any meetings associated with your project under 
the Name column. Also include anyone you suspect might 
be a stakeholder or who has a vested interest in your 
project.
Caution
■
■
  Use some common sense here. The goal is to identify your stakeholders, not to 
drag the planning phase out to the end of the year. Yes, the CEO of your company is technically 
a stakeholder in your project, but I highly doubt that he’s even aware of your project, much less 
interested in your team’s progress. 
3.	 Take the time to fill in the Role on the Project, the Org, 
and Location/Timezone columns. If you don’t explicitly 
know this information, then go find it or just ask the per-
son directly. Don’t skip this step!
4.	 Now, place an “X” in each of the columns as applies to 
each person, except Key Stakeholder?
5.	 Next, add a column for the Unofficial Release Approver. 
This is a special category for people who have the ability 
to stop a project release regardless of their position in 
the organization. There shouldn’t be more than a few of 
these people, but they are incredibly important from a 
stakeholder management standpoint—so take the time 
to figure out who they are if you don’t already know.
6.	 Last, analyze the table and pick out the Key Stakeholders. 
To get you started, here are a few people who are almost 
always Key Stakeholders:
a.	
Anyone with an “X” in the Unofficial Release Approver? 
column
b.	 Anyone who controls the overall project budget 
c.	 Anyone who is a consumer of your project’s output—
that is, your customers
d.	 Influencers/Technical Experts may be, but are not 
always, Key Stakeholders
There you go—a systematic way to identify who your stakeholders are and 
their relative importance. It’s worth noting that this is a critical exercise to 
go through anytime you join a new organization or take on a project staffed 
with people you’ve never worked with before. The entire effort should only 

Chapter 1 | How to Figure Out  What’s Really Going On
10
take you one or two hours depending on how much information you have 
to research, such as Role, Org, Location, and so on. I’ve also found that many 
times I don’t really understand someone’s role when I attempt to summarize 
it to fit into that tiny cell—so again, this is a worthwhile exercise whenever 
you’re planning a project.
But wait, there’s more! Since you’ve got most of the data in one place, it’s 
really easy to expand the table (or create a separate tab) and document your 
communication plan while you’re at it. You’ll notice that I’ve also included 
each person’s location and timezone while I’m gathering data. While this isn’t 
relevant to selecting stakeholders, this information is often in the same place 
when I’m trying to figure out where the person fits in the org structure. I then 
use this information to figure out optimum meeting logistics (timing, location, 
and so on). Three birds with one stone!
Finally, this is not data I’d post on a SharePoint team site or any other pub-
lic forum. I keep this file strictly on my own hard drive and do not share it 
with the team. Sure, there’s nothing confidential about this data, but it does 
include your subjective assessment of the relative importance of your stake-
holders, which could be controversial. Further, I’m sure that there are people 
on your list who believe that they have more influence than you think they do. 
So, avoid the political minefield and subsequent distractions by holding your 
analysis confidential unless you have a very good reason not to. In the end, this 
isn’t rocket science: it’s a tool for the PM to understand who the stakeholders 
are and how to manage their expectations.
But  What about the Customers?
Stakeholders are many, customers are few, and it’s easy to confuse the two. 
But wait! Aren’t customers stakeholders as well? Why, yes they are—but 
customers are unique and need to be treated differently than your average, 
run-o’-the-mill stakeholder. Not sure what I’m talking about? Think I’ve finally 
crossed over to management double-speak? Give me a minute, continue reading, 
and let me explain.
I consider anyone who has a vested interest in the project to be a stakeholder, 
and there’s a definite “importance” level for each one. It’s critical that the PM 
understand the “importance” level of each stakeholder. You need to clearly 
understand who’s the final authority/the Big Decider/the Man with the Cash 
for the project. For product development projects, the Big “Decider” is usually 
the highest ranking engineering authority, and this is usually the person who’s 
got the most positional power over the engineering community. Make sense? 
This does not mean that other stakeholders are not important, and often you 
will find another stakeholder with equal or more importance. For instance, 
the Program Manager is an important stakeholder for any project, but her 
relative importance will depend on how much influence she has over your 

Managing Projects in the Real World
11
project’s destiny. Absolutely all customers are stakeholders, but their relative 
“importance” may not make them the most important stakeholders.
In fact, it’s highly likely that your customer is not the most important stake-
holder you have to deal with. I consider the person representing the functional 
group that will actually use the output of the project to be the most important 
customer. Too often PMs think of nebulous entities external to their company 
as their true customers. However, many times the actual customer for your 
project’s output is probably going to be another internal group. While it’s true 
that there can be more than one customer, based on my experience there’s 
going to be just one that’s the most important. So how should the most impor-
tant customer be treated and how is that different from the way a PM should 
treat the most important stakeholder? More importantly, why do you care?
I treat customers quite differently from the major stakeholders in a few key 
ways. First, I always solicit the customer’s preferences when the team is wres-
tling with a design implementation. In lieu of quantifiable data, I will defer to 
the customer’s preference. Here’s an example from one of my recent projects: 
the rep for the team who will be using the application my team is developing 
wants to see a specific tab order (the order in which the cursor moves across 
a screen as the Tab key is pushed). This isn’t something the other stakehold-
ers are going to care about, nor would I ask them for their opinion on the tab 
order. The development team had a definite opinion, but we implemented the 
tab order exactly as the customer wanted.
Another way I treat customers differently than stakeholders is that for me the 
customer is king. This comes from my days working at Applied Materials, Inc. 
There, it wasn’t enough to think of the customer as always being right, because 
that’s a lukewarm level of commitment to the customer. Instead, I treat my 
true customers like they are the king and as long as what they are request-
ing is doable within the agreed-upon scope of the project, that’s what we do. 
From time to time, this does requires some skillful influencing and negotiation 
if the customer wants something that will negatively impact another customer 
group or that nebulous “external customer”—but that’s all part of the game. 
At the end of the day, why would you argue with the king? Do you appreciate 
it when the waiter argues with you over that cold entrée they just plunked 
down in front of you? They why do it to your own customers?
Here’s an example of what I’m talking about:  A few weeks ago I got new tires 
for my truck. They never asked me how I wanted the tires installed; instead 
they noticed the way my old tires were done and duplicated it without bug-
ging me. I walked out to the finished truck and immediately noticed that they’d 
installed the tires with the white print on the inside. This is exactly what I’d 
wanted and lest you think that’s what they do as a default, I should point out 
that someone else had their tires installed the other direction, again without 
being asked. That level of attention to detail is the kind of focus PMs need to 
bring to bear with their customers.

Chapter 1 | How to Figure Out  What’s Really Going On
12
About now you’re probably thinking that it’s a lot of effort for a minor stake-
holder right? I mean, why should you work so hard to cater to your customer 
when they are not the “Big Decider” nor are they able to crater your project? 
Here’s the thing about customers versus stakeholders that PMs need to keep 
in mind. Long after the project wraps up and is closed, those customers will 
still be dealing with the output of the project. Long, long, long after everyone 
else has gone away. If the project output doesn’t meet and exceed the cus-
tomer’s wants and needs, then eventually your important stakeholders hear 
about it. In fact, this can turn what was viewed as a successful project into a 
candidate for the Worst Project of the Year Award…and there’s nothing you 
can do about it! Yes, that’s right, a disgruntled, dissatisfied, frustrated customer 
can tank the reputation of your team and the project faster than you can say 
“Oops.” Further, all you can do is play defense and fall back on those no-win 
strategies of claiming the requirements were bad or dredging up old CYA 
emails. If you’ve ever been in this situation, then you know it’s bad—real bad.
So there it is! Not all stakeholders are customers, and how you treat your 
customers can have a significant impact on the long-term success of your 
project. Treat your customers with care and don’t fall into the trap of treating 
them the same way you would a stakeholder with relatively low importance.
Requirements? On the Rocks or Frozen?
It is crucial at the initiating phase for the project manager to assess just how 
clearly defined the requirements are. Think of this like you would order a 
margarita…are the requirements still a heterogeneous mixture of solid and 
liquid (“on the rocks”), gelling (“slushy”), or blended to actionable perfection 
(“frozen”)? This information greatly affects the planning activities that come 
next, and determining this state is a crucial skill for all PMs.
Reviewing the Requirements Documentation
If you were to ask, I think most people would say that the project plan or the 
schedule is the most important project document. Me, I’d say it was the require-
ments document. For most of my career I’ve managed product development 
projects, and that means a product requirements document (PRD). Whether it’s 
a PRD, contract, service level agreement (SLA), marketing requirements document 
(MRD), or something else—the requirements document is the one piece of 
information that truly defines the project. It’s so important that if it’s neglected 
by the team, then the project will more than likely be a failure.
One of the most important tasks a PM has is the review of this document. 
Peer reviews are critical to generating quality documentation, and I always  

Managing Projects in the Real World
13
prioritize this type of activity with the team. As the PM, I’m reviewing the  
document for something other than the technical aspects of the project. That’s 
right, when I do a peer review of a requirements document, it’s not focused 
on technical content. That’s not my job; my job is to review for completeness 
and clarity. The technical reviewers are responsible for the technical content, 
and I have to trust that they will do their jobs thoroughly.
So, what are the things you need to consider when doing a peer review of a 
requirements document? Here are the things I focus on:
• 
The Executive Overview/Summary: How clear and accurate is 
this section? Obviously you want to look for poor gram-
mar and bad punctuation, but is the meaning clear? Are 
there any run-on sentences or double negatives? You’d 
be surprised how often these things pop up and obscure 
the actual meaning. You should also scrutinize anything 
that’s a direct cut-and-paste from another document. 
Frequently these sections are not a clean fit and need 
wordsmithing.
• 
Are all Opens, Assumptions, and Dependencies clearly docu-
mented? If opens are called out, do they have clear owners 
and timelines? At this stage of the project there will defi-
nitely be some opens, but the key thing is to make sure 
someone is driving closure on them by a hard date.
• 
Each requirement should be clear and concise, even to a non-
technical reviewer. If you don’t understand the requirement, 
then chances are it’s not clear enough to avoid multiple 
interpretations. Log an issue and make sure the require-
ment gets clarified in the final revision of the document.
• 
Beyond clarity, each requirement needs to be testable. If your 
requirements document doesn’t specifically address this 
area, then you need to add it. Never let a requirement 
slide through without a clear pass/fail criterion. Trust me 
on this one: If it’s not clear what “good” looks like for the 
requirement, then you can bet “dollars to donuts” that 
your team will be hashing this out in a frantic attempt to 
close out the project later.
• 
Are any of the requirements designated as “optional” or “low 
priority”?  That’s a real bad sign and you should never go to 
a 1.0 revision on a requirements document with optional 
items. The requirement is either in or it’s out. If no one 
can make a call on whether or not this item is required, 
then remove it from the document. These “optional” or 
“low” requirements can always be added back in later 

Chapter 1 | How to Figure Out  What’s Really Going On
14
through the change control process if they become “must 
haves.” Optional requirements only serve to confuse and 
distract the team. Don’t let ’em slide.
• 
Finally, I always consider where the hot button items are for 
the various functional areas on the team. In the last PRD I 
reviewed, we are doing some major upgrades to a soft-
ware application but we are not planning to do anything 
to improve the operating performance. The performance 
requirements called out in the PRD are exactly the same 
as they were in the original development effort. As the 
PM, I want to make sure that the folks responsible for 
operating the application are okay with no performance 
upgrades. Therefore when I submit my feedback there 
will be a question to the PRD owner asking if this require-
ment has been confirmed with the manufacturing team. 
I’ll also probably ping the manufacturing rep and ask him 
to double-check that requirement during his own review 
of the document. It’s these minor coordination actions 
that greatly improve the quality of the final requirements 
document.
Okay, that’s what I’m focused on when I review a requirements document as 
the PM. If I’m also a technical expert for the project, then I’ll do a second review 
where I only concentrate on the technical completeness of the document. 
Personally, I find it better to do two separate reviews because I need to look at 
the document from different perspectives . . . but that could just be me. ☺
I’d be remiss if I didn’t cover one last point when it comes to doing peer 
reviews of requirements documents. Frequently the document owner strug-
gles with getting the reviewers to provide feedback in the requested time-
frame. In my opinion, there’s nothing more important for the team to achieve 
at this stage of a project than completing the peer review and freezing the 
requirements document. If the requirements owner is having a difficult time 
closing the review out, then I step in and help influence the team to get the 
reviews done. As a last resort I set a hard date for freezing the requirements 
and make it clear that it’s time to “speak now or forever hold your peace.” At 
that hard date we, as a team, agree to freeze the requirements and then all 
other changes must go through the formal change control process. Whatever 
you do, do not allow this to drag on as it just pushes your schedule and really 
adds a lot of ambiguity for those executing the project work.
I’ve reviewed a lot of requirements documents in my time, and I’ve found that 
it pays to put enough attention and focus on this activity. A poorly ­developed 
requirements document spells doom and gloom for the team later during  
execution. As the PM, you need to review the document from a unique 
­mindset which is sometimes hard to achieve if you’re also focused on the 

Managing Projects in the Real World
15
technical completeness. Remember that no one else on your team is going to 
review the requirements like you will—so be sure you’re paying attention to 
those six items I list above.
Separating the Wheat from the Chaff
Depending on the maturity and type of project management process in the 
organization you work in, you will be required to create and maintain any 
number of documents per project. Often the number of documents you have 
to create can be overwhelming. Ironically the subset of those documents that 
I actually use to manage the project is fairly small. In fact, I only regularly use 
five documents. Being able to sort out the documentation wheat from the 
chaff at this stage of a project is a skill all PMs should master, and your choices 
here will inform the planning work you’ll tackle next.
Usually the documents you’re required to produce as a PM fall into those 
two categories: wheat and chaff. The chaff are those documents you have 
to create per your organization’s established business processes that do not 
help you manage the project. I also consider those documents that contrib-
ute minimally to the project as chaff. What types of documents fall into this 
category? They’re things like safety checklists (ever notice that you never find 
a forgotten requirement while doing these?), approvals for every document 
ever considered on the project, quality assurance audit reports (the business 
process compliance kind), the retrospective report-out (does anyone actually 
use this data?), regulatory compliance checklists, and so forth and so on. In fact 
almost all checklists fall into this category since you’re unlikely to fill it out in 
such a way that would cause you even more audit attention.
Most PMs know the content of these checklists cold and ensure that the 
proper work is incorporated into their project plan so, when it comes time 
to complete the checklist, it’s a pencil-whipping exercise. Sure, that’s not 
how those checklists are intended to be used, but if you’ve been around that  
particular block a time or two, then you know that that’s just what they 
become after you’ve used them a few times.
Now the wheat is another matter. Here are the five project documents I think 
are critical to managing a project and why I think they should be on the list:
• 
The requirements document—by whatever name 
whatever you call it (PRD, MRD, contract, engagement 
agreement, etc.)—is the most critical document for any 
project. I really don’t need to tell you why this one is on 
the “most critical” list, but I will give you an example of 
how critical it is. My brother is a PM in the construction 
industry, and for him the contract is his most important 
document. By the end of a project he even has some of 
it memorized because in his business they succeed or fail 

Chapter 1 | How to Figure Out  What’s Really Going On
16
based on change requests, and he has to be able to tell 
quickly whether or not a customer request is included 
in the contract or not. He can’t run his projects without 
thoroughly immersing himself in the requirements.
Second only to the requirements document is 
• 
the 
dynamic schedule. This is invaluable to the PM as a 
tool for doing “what-if” modeling, for tracking progress, 
and for making commitments. If the schedule is well 
developed, it becomes your secret weapon.
• 
The change control log and the various change 
requests generated throughout the project are other 
critical documents. You need traceability and you need 
to keep track of changing customer commitments. Your 
team also needs these documents to ensure that every-
one is on the same page with respect to changes in scope. 
Not convinced? Just ask your Quality Assurance Engineer! 
These documents are vital to monitoring the project and 
keeping things on track.
I consider the 
• 
risk register critical inasmuch as I think 
some level of risk management is vital, and the register is 
the tool you use to develop your risk management plan. 
I frequently use a nonstandard template to do risk col-
lection, so transferring the information into the required 
document template is a non-value-added task as far as 
managing the project is concerned…but that’s my prob-
lem since I want to use a more streamlined template.
Finally, I consider 
• 
meeting minutes a necessary evil and 
am on the fence as to whether or not they are critical. 
You see, no matter how much effort the PM puts into 
generating the minutes, I get the distinct impression that 
almost no one refers to them later. It doesn’t seem to 
matter what information is in the minutes either. How 
many times do you get pinged by teammates for a specific 
date or commit? It’s clearly in the minutes, but it’s faster 
to shoot the PM a quick IM or email right? Okay, that 
might be an oversimplification, but you get my point. My 
other problem with meeting minutes is that they are gen-
erally used as a CYA tactic. I’ve never seen a disagreement 
turned around because someone else pulled up meeting 
minutes and demonstrated where the item under con-
tention was discussed in the past. This never ends well 
and mostly burns bridges. I try very hard to never pull 
this one…but that’s me.

Managing Projects in the Real World

I hope this discussion has encouraged you to look at the documentation you 
have to create for each project. If it’s not contributing to the management of 
the project, then you should definitely question why it’s needed. At a mini-
mum, you should adjust the amount of time you spend on this kind of dubi-
ously useful documentation to reflect the subsequent value in managing the 
project. So, do you have to produce a lot of chaff? If so, now’s the time to kick 
off some waiver requests to get out from under a mountain of no-value-added 
documentation.
Formal Change Control Doesn’t Have to Hurt
I couldn’t believe it when I heard it, but apparently it’s true. According to 
several colleagues and acquaintances, there are quite a few PMs who don’t 
utilize a formal change control process. I know this, based on the shock and 
awe I frequently get when I mention the latest change request for a project. It 
seems that the fact that I’m actually using a change control process is unusual. 
Apparently there are a lot of PMs out there who don’t use any change control 
process whatsoever! Holy cow! How can anyone manage a project without 
change control? I’m speculating here, but I suspect that the primary reason 
PMs don’t employ a change control process is that they believe that a formal 
change control is too much hassle—too bureaucratic, if you will.
This perception is entirely false. You can implement formal change control 
without significant expenditure of effort, focus, time, or bureaucratic hassle. 
More importantly a formal change control process is like Wonder Woman’s 
bullet-deflecting bracelets—deflecting almost all scapegoating attempts later 
in the project when the bottom has fallen out and everyone is diving for cover. 
It’s also unparalleled for keeping the entire team on the same page as far as 
the scope of work is concerned. Don’t believe me? Allow me to explain what 
I do for change control on my projects and hopefully convince you that it’s 
entirely doable.
Melanie’s Guide to No-Hassle Change Control
1.	 Ensure that the entire team reviews and approves the  
requirements document(s). In the standing team meeting,  
ask for any and all objections, discuss anything that’s 
brought up, and then explicitly state (and record in your 
minutes) that the document is now frozen at revision 1.0. 
All further changes to the requirements must have a for-
mal change request submitted. This is important to do 
formally, as it sets the baseline for the scope of work for 
the project.

Chapter 1 | How to Figure Out  What’s Really Going On
18
2.	 Create a change control request (CR) form if your organization 
doesn’t already have one. Here are the minimum fields 
you need on the form: description of the change, who’s 
requesting the change, a change request ID number (can 
be the same as the date), fields for all functional areas of 
the project team to enter their impact assessment, and 
approval fields for all functional areas. You can obviously 
expand on these but, at a minimum, this is the informa-
tion you’ll need to capture. 
Tip
■
■
  If your org already has a CR form but it’s a monster, consider making some of the fields 
in the form “optional.” Never suffer through a bloated, time-sucking form for what should be a 
straightforward process. 
3.	 Every time there’s a change to any requirement, insist that 
a change request form be submitted to the team. This will 
require some diligence on your part, since most teams 
need to be trained to do this. Don’t worry, though—
after about three change requests, this will become the 
norm and you won’t have to play the change control cop 
anymore.
4.	 Each time a change request form is submitted, make time 
in your standing team meeting to review it. Discuss, evalu-
ate impacts, and plan for implementation in your meeting.  
Finally approve, reject (providing justification for the 
rejection), or send back to the submitter for more infor-
mation. Note that this assumes that your entire team is 
the Change Control Board (CCB). 
5.	 If the change request is approved, add the work to your 
schedule, recommit your project deliverables if necessary, and 
ensure that the requirements document’s content and version 
number are updated to reflect the change.
6.	 Lather, rinse, and repeat for all future changes to your project’s 
scope of work.
Done right, formal change control should take no more than a few minutes 
a week on average and will result in greatly improved communication across 
the team. Furthermore, those change request forms provide a great record of 
why the scope of the project was changed and when those changes occurred. 
These records are what I meant earlier about Wonder Woman’s bracelets. 
The only hard part about a formal change control process is facilitating the 
review and impact discussions; everything else is fairly straightforward.

Managing Projects in the Real World
19
So, if you are not already using a formal change control process, then I strongly 
urge you to start. Still not convinced it’s worth the hassle? Check out the  
post mortems for your last few projects. I’m betting one of the common 
threads you’ll find is scope creep. Formal change control contains scope creep 
and ensures that, if the scope is growing, the implications of that growth are 
comprehended in the overall project plan and that the customer commits. 

Effective 
Meetings in the 
Real World
People talk all the time about how much they hate meetings, how they have 
too many meetings, how the meetings they attend are all badly run with no 
outcomes, and so on. You know what I’m talking about—and face it, we’ve all 
said those things before. Worse yet, as PMs we create those crappy meetings! 
Today companies go to great lengths to teach all of us how to have effective 
meetings, but we just don’t play that way. When was the last time you were in 
a meeting that resulted in decisions and actionable data? How about a meet-
ing with a good agenda? I’m not talking about a static list of bullets like “status 
update” here, but relevant discussion topics with clear outcomes. I’m betting 
that it’s been a while, and I’d also bet that you run some of these mind-sucking 
meetings.
Now here’s that cold splash of reality water. Meetings are critical to getting 
work done. Period. As a PM, it’s your responsibility to ensure that every 
meeting you host is well-run and adds value for the attendees. If your team 
meetings are not producing decisions and solutions to problems, then you’re 
doing something wrong and you need to fix it now. As the cliché goes, be part 
of the solution, not the problem.
As the leader, aka the PM, the single most important thing you can do to 
improve your meetings is to improve your attitude about them. Remember, 
as the team leader your attitudes and actions set the tone for the rest of the 
crew. If you run around badmouthing meetings in general and complaining 
2
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 2 | Effective Meetings in the Real World
22
loudly that you have too many meetings, then don’t be surprised if others view 
your meetings that way too. If you don’t prepare ahead of time, arrive late, and 
don’t hold yourself accountable, then why should your team do these things 
either? Yep, as everyone knows when they get dumped by that super-hot  
girl/guy—it really is you! Sorry!
Start taking meetings seriously and prioritize the preparation for them 
accordingly. Oh, and while we’re talking about preparation, here’s a hint: it’s 
much more than sending the calendar hit and finding a conference room. You 
need to think about what you want the outcome of the meeting to be, what’s  
relevant and actionable for your team, and how to build and reinforce a strong 
team dynamic. This isn’t something you can whip up in the 10 minutes prior 
to the meeting. Again, if you aren’t prepared, how can you expect your team 
to be? Seriously, it’s time to start thinking about meetings differently.
The 30-Minute Meeting
Once you’ve mastered running your standing hour-long meetings efficiently, 
the next logical step is to start having shorter meetings. When I first started 
doing 30-minute meetings I quickly realized that they are much harder to facil-
itate. There’s just no wiggle room for ratholes, unprepared team members, or 
a weak agenda. This is the major league of meeting facilitation, and you have 
to bring your “A” game. So how do you do that?
First things first, right? What’s the agenda? For a short meeting, your agenda 
needs to be very tight. It should not be generic items such as “schedule 
review” or “team updates.” I’ve found that for truly effective 30-minute meet-
ings you need a dynamic agenda that is specific to that timeslot and that week. 
If your agenda is a placeholder for things like status updates, really think about 
whether or not a 30-minute meeting will work for this forum. Along with an 
agenda, a brief meeting like this really needs an objective. I find it best to state 
this clearly in the meeting invite. The most effective use of a 30-minute meet-
ing is to drive a decision on a contentious topic.
The second thing to understand is that you must be very, very effective at 
facilitating the discussion. You need to quickly clue into who is/is not partici-
pating and the direction of the discussion. In a 30-minute meeting it’s very easy 
for a few to steamroll the rest of the team into a decision that falls apart about 
10 minutes after the meeting is done. It’s also very easy to waste time on a 
rathole instead of the core discussion. Remember as the meeting facilitator, 
you are personally responsible for keeping the discussion on track and leading 
the team to complete the meeting objective. This means that you’re probably 
going to have to interrupt people and quickly move topics offline if they are 
not core to the meeting objective. Remember, if the meeting is poorly facili-
tated and nothing is achieved, then everyone’s time is wasted.

Managing Projects in the Real World
23
Now for the fun part! The third thing to take into consideration as you embark 
on shorter meetings is that you’re going to need to train your team to be effec-
tive in this timeframe. You need to set the expectation that everyone come 
prepared to discuss the topics on the agenda (you have one of those, right?). 
I always make a deal with my teams that I’ll ensure we stay on track and end 
on time as long as everyone comes prepared to participate. Then of course 
there’s the subtle application of peer pressure to encourage everyone to be 
ready to rock, so as not to waste the rest of the team’s time. I find that it only 
takes one efficient, short meeting to make believers out of the whole crew.
The fourth thing to remember is to not be a tease. If you schedule the meet-
ing for 30 minutes then it really needs to end in 30 minutes. It’s that simple. 
We’ve all been in meetings where the words—“this will be a short one”—
are uttered with complete sincerity. I don’t know about you but I get really 
testy if the meeting is poorly facilitated and it runs long. Don’t compound the 
problem by teasing me that I’ll actually recover some extra time in my day. 
Be honest about what you need to achieve in the meeting and schedule the 
appropriate amount of time to meet the objective.
Finally, I should point out a common pitfall when it comes to 30-minute meetings. 
Many of us are familiar with the standard manufacturing stand-up meeting 
where everyone gets together and shares their status in a very quick and 
informal manner. This works really well for some situations, but it won’t work 
for anything that requires lots of debate and discussion. If all you’re doing is 
sharing information such as “the tool is up and we have no issues,” then by 
all means use the 30-minute duration. On the other hand, if you’re discussing 
the latest engineering challenges, then you will probably find that a 30-minute 
meeting simply does not have enough time to share status around the room 
and do some debate and discussion.
You can run effective 30-minute meetings, where decisions are actually made 
and everyone participates. I know, ’cause I do it all the time. I just don’t plan 
on a 30-minute meeting unless I know we can achieve the meeting objective 
in that timeframe. The key here is to gauge how much discussion needs to be 
done before a decision can be made. If your original 30 minute meeting runs 
20 minutes long, then you’d have been better off treating the whole thing like 
an hour-meeting and just finishing early right? It really is worth mastering the 
30-minute meeting because once you do, you’ll find your team’s participa-
tion in all meetings increases across the board. In fact, if you are particularly  
successful you’ll find your team asking for more 30-minute meetings and fewer 
of the longer ones.

Meeting Facilitation:  How It’s Really Done
For the new PM or someone who happens to wake up one day and find  
themselves a full-fledged PM, meeting facilitation is a bit of a mirage. You can 
clearly see what ‘good’ looks like off in the far-distant land of Perfect World. 
However, you work in the Real World where things such as competing pri-
orities, impatient teammates, and an informal workplace make formal meeting 
facilitation awkward, unwieldy, and unlikely. There’s just something weirdly pre-
tentious about asking someone to be the timekeeper—much more spending 
five minutes at the start of each meeting talking about the meeting guidelines.
Okay, so what does work in the Real World? What I’ve found is that no one 
technique or tool works all of the time. I’m constantly trying to read the situ-
ation and adjust as needed. Every time I run a bad meeting I do a mini-post 
mortem to figure out what to do differently. That said, here are a few of the 
tools I have had success with:
• 
Situational awareness is key to good meeting  
facilitation. This is a hard skill for a PM to develop, 
mostly because if feels secondary to the job you should 
be doing—running the meeting. You need to have a sense 
of whether or not the physical (or virtual) environment is 
supporting the purpose of the meeting. Trust me, meet-
ings in the café are not going to be productive for more 
than 2 people. Does the speaker phone work adequately? 
How about the video? Are there enough chairs for every-
one? These are the kinds of things you have to think about 
in order for the overall meeting to go smoothly.
• 
You also need to pay attention to the team 
dynamics—such as who is or isn’t talking, the overall 
tone of the meeting (collaborative or combative?), and 
where the pockets of disagreement are. I have a pretty 
low-tech method for monitoring this kind of thing in vir-
tual meetings. Before the meeting I’ll write the name of 
everyone attending the meeting on a Post-it note. As the 
meeting progresses I’ll place a mark next to each person 
who talks. This is a quick visual way to understand who’s 
not participating in the meeting. Once I know who’s not 
playing, I can address specific comments to them or ask 
for their opinion. You can also use this method in reverse 
if you have the feeling that someone is dominating the 
meeting.

Managing Projects in the Real World
25
Another technique I’ve perfected over the years is to 
• 
keep the discussion on any one topic to around 
10 minutes max. No matter the topic being discussed 
there are always a few people on the team who aren’t 
affected by the outcome. Be respectful of their time and 
either limit the discussion in the meeting or take it offline 
and report the outcome in the next meeting.
• 
Utilize physics! Since the speed of light is faster than the 
speed of sound, you can convey information more quickly 
if you employ a visual medium. Okay, all this means is that 
I type the meeting minutes real-time while the meeting 
is happening and project them. This actually serves two  
purposes: first it improves the team’s understanding of 
whatever we’re discussing; second, I really think it speeds 
up the discussion. It’s also very helpful when your team 
has members for which English is not their native language.  
I try to limit slang and cultural references but I know I’m 
not successful all the time. Capturing the key points of the 
discussion visually, right in the meeting, greatly improves 
the quality of the communication for the whole team.
And finally, here’s one for your inner control freak. 
• 
Be 
ruthless in keeping the meeting on track. Do not 
let any one person take control of the discussion. For 
some people this can be the hardest part of meeting 
facilitation. You have to interrupt people and you have to 
tell others to take the discussion offline, all while remain-
ing professional about telling them to shut up! ☺ I see 
this most frequently when a loquacious manager attends 
a team meeting on an occasional basis. I used to work 
for a great guy who loved to talk and every time he was 
in a meeting with my team he tended to dominate the 
conversation. I was continually wresting the conversa-
tion away from him and turning it back to the agenda. 
He was never offended and frankly didn’t realize he was 
doing this. I’ve also seen examples of managers hijacking 
the meeting to drive some action they want to happen 
now or to just pound the table. This situation sucks and 
there’s usually no winning here, sorry to say.
So those are some of my tips and tricks to facilitate meetings. Think about 
your own meetings and be honest…could you do better at facilitating them? 
Since you are effectively commandeering people’s time and attention, you need 
to make sure that they get something out of it by ensuring that the meeting 
is well-run and productive.

Don’t Let  Your Boss Come to the Meeting
All right, consider this fair warning—if you manage direct reports you’re not 
gonna enjoy this bit. In fact, if you continue to read it you’re going to feel all 
squirmy and uncomfortable because I’m tellin’ it like it really is.
What’s the single most effective way to undermine your authority as a PM, run 
a completely ineffective meeting, and totally de-focus your team? Invite your 
manager to the party! Yep, despite what you may have been told, it’s never 
a good idea to bring your functional manager into a regular team meeting. 
Even if you work for someone who’s completely reasonable and perfectly 
savvy about interpersonal communication skills, you’re just askin’ for trouble if  
your boss shows up to one of your meetings. Trust me on this one . . . there’s 
rarely a legitimate need for the boss to show up and play in a working-group 
meeting.
Okay, I can hear some of you now…“But wait Melanie, my boss is so awesome 
and he only wants to help out. What could possibly be bad about having him 
participate in my team meetings?” Well let’s see…there was that guy who 
managed the pilot line who liked to pace around the table and bang his fist in 
his hand to make a point, and then there was the functional manager who liked 
to hear himself talk . . . a lot! And of course who could forget the engineering 
manager who liked to hand down decisions without any input or comprehen-
sion of the consequences? Here I should point out that I genuinely liked all of 
these managers and they truly didn’t mean any harm in coming to my team 
meetings. In the case of the pilot line manager, he just happened to love the 
film Gladiator and in his zeal he would completely freak out my project team. 
It would take me the better part of a week to chill them out and convince 
them that he didn’t really mean that they would all lose their jobs if the  
project slipped so much as an hour. The talker? He had the best stories and 
was super-entertaining, so we definitely had a good time when he showed up. 
The problem was that absolutely nothing got accomplished in those meetings, 
and that’s despite the fact that I was constantly wrestling the conversation 
away from him to get it focused back on the agenda. The engineering manager 
I mentioned caused me a full week of work just to get the team re-focused 
back on the original scope of work every time he decided to “pop in.” Take it 
from me: Never get into a situation where a functional manager dictates how 
you lay out traces on a board…can you say “re-work”?
Still not convinced? Okay, consider how it looks to your team when your boss 
is there. Who’s the leader now? When it comes time to make a decision, who 
gets the “Decider” card? You? Or your manager? Oh, and if you think your 
boss is just gonna sit there and be quiet, think again. That goes completely 
against human nature, and it’s a rare manager who can let their direct report 
stumble or fail without jumping in immediately to help. Have you ever been 
in a meeting where the meeting organizer’s boss is sitting in to “observe”? 

Managing Projects in the Real World
27
Notice how they can’t help correcting the organizer right there in front of 
the entire team? That’s what I’m talking about here. This is probably the single 
most effective way to undermine your position as the team leader, bar none.
There’s another issue with having your boss attend your meetings. It’s almost 
second nature to everyone in the room to defer to the boss. So now your 
boss is put into a position to make decision on issues that you would normally 
handle. Do you really think it makes you look good for the boss to have to 
decide which technical solution to implement? Maybe, but what about all those 
mundane decisions you make in the course of a project meeting? Who’s going 
to pick up the marketing collateral? Should the team get together for lunch 
on Wed or Fri? Do you need a change request for that update to the training 
documentation? Does the planner order a 10% buffer quantity of interposers 
or 25%? See where I’m goin’ here? If you give your boss the impression that 
you and your team can’t make simple decisions like those above, what confi-
dence is he or she gonna have that you can be trusted to make much harder, 
more critical decisions? I know you don’t intend to give that impression when 
the boss shows up for the meeting, but trust me, it can happen all too easily. 
Beware my friends, beware.
By now I hope I’ve convinced you that it’s never a good idea for your boss 
to attend your team meetings, but what if you can’t avoid it? What if the boss 
is insistent that he or she be present for some particular decision or meeting?  
What do you do then? In that situation the first thing I do is ask myself 
whether or not I can set up a one-off meeting to address the issue my boss is 
concerned about. This is usually the best approach, as you can limit the agenda 
strictly to that topic and contain the damage. If I can’t set up a dedicated meet-
ing, I ask myself what is the motivation behind the request to be at my team 
meeting? Often I can address this motivator separately and offline, such as 
when the boss is wound up about a schedule slip.
Caution
■
■
  Never, never, never let your boss come in and cudgel your team about being late.  
You might as well shoot yourself in your own foot!
If those two strategies won’t work, then I get a bit more “creative” and strate-
gically “forget” to send the boss the meeting calendar hit. Ironically, the more 
impassioned the boss is to attend a meeting, the higher the likelihood that she 
will completely forget about the meeting next week. Sneaky? Sure. Effective? 
Absolutely!
All right, I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention the only time it’s a good idea to bring 
your boss (or anyone else’s boss for that matter) into your team meeting. 
Managers listen up! The only time you should invite your boss to a team meet-
ing is to hand out praise for a job well done. That’s it! No exceptions! Further, 

Chapter 2 | Effective Meetings in the Real World
28
it’s a really good idea to have the boss come at the end of a meeting or have 
them do their thing at the beginning and then leave. To be honest, unless the 
boss specifically asks to come to my team meeting to deliver the “atta boy,” 
I prefer to have them send an email to a broad distribution as I think that’s 
more motivating for the team…it gives them something their peers can rib 
them about later.
There you go—the nasty reality about having a manager attend your project 
meetings. Sure, it sounds like a reasonable idea on the surface, but based on 
many uncomfortable meetings with a stupid amount of damage control to do 
later, it’s just not a good idea. Even today, where I like and respect my boss, 
I do not invite him into the team meetings as a rule. I’m really not trying to 
hide anything from the boss here; it’s just that his very presence can under-
mine my authority and de-focus the team, despite his real desire to help us 
out. Does he make an appearance once in a while? Sure, but it’s not a regular 
occurrence.
Taking Minutes in the Real  World 
In an average week, for any given project I’m managing, I’ll attend three or 
four meetings and I am responsible for the minutes for most of them. Even if 
I’m not the minute-taker, as the PM I need to facilitate getting the key points 
documented in the minutes. All this adds up to lots of minutes!
So this begs the question: how do you handle your minutes? I think taking 
good meeting minutes is a learned skill and it takes a lot of practice to get to 
the point where you can participate in the meeting, facilitate the meeting, and 
type up the minutes in real time. Don’t kid yourself: this is really hard to do for 
a variety of reasons. Some folks never get to the point where they can do all 
three simultaneously. My best advice to you, if you can’t do all three of those 
at once, is to ask for a volunteer to take the minutes. You can also ask a neu-
tral party to facilitate the meeting, but frankly almost no one does that. Last 
you can go off and improve your typing skills. Who knew that typing would 
be one of those high school skills that I’d use daily as a grown-up? Heck, with 
the exception of the word champagne, I haven’t uttered a word of French in 
twenty years, so that class wasn’t as useful in retrospect! ☺
How I take minutes and what format they end up in are an area of constant 
innovation for me. I find a format that works well for a while, and then it seems 
stale and frankly underperforming. I believe that a high-performing format  
will increase the usability of the information captured and actually encourage 
participation in the meeting. I’m always on the lookout for new ideas on how 
to handle my minutes.

Managing Projects in the Real World
29
Here’s an example of what I mean when I refer to a high-performing format.  
A couple of years ago I managed a project that fed up into a large product 
development program. The program manager was very experienced, and I 
learned a great deal from watching her work. One of the absolutely brilliant 
things she did was to not publish meeting minutes. She didn’t take minutes 
like we take minutes. Basically she created a spreadsheet to use as a discus-
sion guide and record for the program team meetings, which she posted in 
the program repository. One tab was set up to talk about whatever opens or 
hot topics the team needed to address. A second tab was set up to facilitate 
discussion on topics related to operational excellence—what was working, 
what wasn’t working, what we should change, and so forth. The final tab was 
set up to record key decisions. Each week the team members were expected 
to open up the spreadsheet and add topics to the first two tabs that they 
wanted to discuss in the meeting. During the meeting we stepped through the 
spreadsheet tabs and any key decisions were documented. That’s it! It was 
brilliant in its simplicity and it was incredibly functional for that team. For what 
it’s worth, I use this same technique anytime I fast-track a project because  it’s 
more efficient than my usual method, and on a fast-track project the team is 
very motivated to go grab information out of the minutes if they need it.
Now in contrast, I once worked in an organization where the format of the 
meeting minutes was so cumbersome that the PMs would spend about an 
hour per meeting cleaning them up after the meeting was done. To be fair, 
this was also partly due to the fact that some of the PMs struggled to type 
and facilitate at the same time. To this day, I don’t understand why they didn’t 
ask someone else to take minutes. For my part, I had the typing down but 
the format was so persnickety that even I would spend a good 20-30 minutes 
doing clean-up for each set of minutes. That was just plain crazy, especially 
when you consider that we all had more project work than we could handle. 
In hindsight, I should have driven a change to that stinkin’ minutes format . . .  
Ah, live and learn, eh?
Speaking of awkward formats—a few years ago, I worked in an organization 
where the preferred vehicle for documenting almost all of the project data 
was a web tool that had been developed in-house. It provided space/fields for 
documenting everything from revision changes on key documents to the risk 
register. One person described it to me as “PMBoK in a Box”1 and according 
to my Op X rep, all I needed to do during the team meeting was step through 
each page and update it. The problem with that tool was that it didn’t have 
a good way to capture key decisions or the discussions that would happen 
during meetings. I hated this tool and never did use it to capture “minutes.” 
Happily I heard that it bit the dust, so that’s progress from my perspective.
1PMBoK is the acronym for A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, the 
compendium of project management standards and best practices published by the Project 
Management Institute in its 5th edition in 2013.

Today I use MS Word or OneNote with a fairly loose format for meeting  
minutes and I spend about 5 minutes cleaning them up afterwards. I capture 
the team members’ update, the schedule update, risk management activi-
ties, the change log, track-action items, and opens all in the same document.  
I’m constantly tweaking how I take minutes. I don’t change formats mid-project,  
but I do switch it up for new projects, depending on the pace and team makeup.
Improving  Your  Virtual Meetings 
Once an old friend and coworker from a previous employer commented on 
the fact that I seemed more animated than he remembered. “What the heck 
is this guy talking about?” I thought. This comment percolated in the back of 
my mind for a while, and it took me a few days to figure out.
I was sitting in my beached-whale-gray cubicle participating in yet another 
virtual meeting when it hit me. He thought I was more animated because I 
sounded more animated than he remembered. You see, when I worked with 
this guy virtual meetings were the new, new thing and not the pervasive SOP 
they are today. As I sat in that meeting, I realized that about half of the partici-
pants spoke in what can only be described as passionless, dead-zombie voices. 
There were virtually no subliminal cues as to what they were thinking or 
how strongly they felt about any particular point. To be honest, it was sleep-
inducing to be a part of that meeting and, in retrospect, I probably should have 
excused myself and ditched the meeting.
Sadly, this happens a lot, but it’s easier than you think to improve your commu-
nication skills in this area. I know this because I made it a goal to improve my 
facilitation of virtual meetings a few years ago. One of the key lessons I found 
was that I could greatly improve the overall communication just by changing 
the way I sounded. The goal here is to convey subliminal context with vocal 
intonation and word choice. Basically, you want to extend the depth of com-
munication by layering in more meaning behind the words you use. To help 
you out, here are a few techniques I refined over the years:
• 
Always greet each person on the conference call. Greet some 
of the folks more enthusiastically than others, based on 
how well you know them. Trust me a cheerful and hearty 
“Hey Melanie! How’s it goin’?” goes a long way to setting 
the tone of a meeting. Just be careful not to come across 
as an announcer at a low-rent circus.
• 
Smile when you speak … if you want to convey a positive  
message. Conversely frown when you need to convey 
some doubt or misgivings. Stand and pace around your 
cube if you want to convey confidence and/or urgency. I 
don’t honestly know why this works, but I can attest to 
the fact that it does.

Managing Projects in the Real World

• 
Practice speaking in different volumes to enhance the ­message. 
A slightly louder “Hey Melanie! How’s it goin’?” conveys 
something completely different if those words are ­spoken  
much more softly.  Go ahead and try it right now for 
yourself. I’ll wait! Two words of caution here: circus 
announcer! ’Nuff said.
This next technique takes some practice but is very effec-
• 
tive once you master it. Change the cadence or pace of 
your words. When I mean business and want to signal that 
the joking around is done, I tend to speak more briskly 
and use very precise wording. This is especially effective 
if I want to emphasize a decision the team has made or 
recap a meeting before breaking it up. By speaking faster 
and more precisely I signal that what I’m saying is impor-
tant. Obviously the opposite is also true.
Once you’ve mastered your vocal intonations and cadence, 
• 
it’s time to try playing with your word choices. Instead of  
saying, “Thanks for getting that deliverable done early,”  
say, “Wow, two weeks early on that deliverable! You 
rock!”. . .Okay you might need to tweak that to reflect 
your own personality, but I think you get my drift here. 
Think about the adjectives you use most, and then iden-
tify alternates that convey more meaning. For instance, 
instead of saying that something is increasing, say that 
it’s ramping rapidly or that it’s experiencing exponen-
tial growth. Simple changes to word choice can greatly 
enhance the message. If this is hard for you, then rustle 
up a thesaurus and use it regularly. . .I do!
Now, I know there are some folks out there rolling their eyes about these tips 
and tricks. That’s cool, but I’d like to challenge you to pay attention to how 
the other people on your next conference call sound. Pull out a scrap piece of 
paper and jot your observations down as the meeting progresses. Can you glean 
additional meaning from their intonation and word choices, or are they a blank 
canvas? Now think about how you spoke and what you could have done differ-
ently to enhance the communication of your key points. This stuff isn’t rocket 
science and it’s pretty easy to master, so why not give it a shot? What can it hurt? 
And if you’re lucky you’ll find your virtual meetings get a tad more productive.
The Project Kickoff Meeting
It’s a tossup to me which one is more important: the kickoff or the go/no-go 
meeting in the lifecycle of any project. First off, what’s the primary purpose of 
a kickoff meeting? Very good! It’s to get the entire team on the same page with 

Chapter 2 | Effective Meetings in the Real World
32
respect to the project. That’s important, right? So why do so many PMs do 
a half-hearted job at them? The kickoff happens somewhere in the nebulous 
boundary between scoping the project and in-depth planning. This is the busi-
est time for a PM across the entire lifespan of the project. Somehow, ’cause 
you’re crazy busy, the kickoff meeting gets short shrift. It seems adequate to 
slap a quick meeting on the team’s calendar and a vague plan of “just explain-
ing” the project to the team and getting started on the estimation work. 
Unfortunately, a weak kickoff meeting starts your project off at a disadvantage, 
and that can that make life a lot harder on the PM than it has to be.
If a weak kickoff is detrimental, what does an effective one look like? The kick-
off meeting should set the vision for the project: everyone should understand 
what the project is expected to achieve (at a high level), why this particular 
project is important, where it sits on the org’s overall priority list, and so forth. 
It’s also the first time you’re going to meet as an intact team, so here’s where 
you need to setup the team dynamic. Does this team need to be nimble and 
fast to execute? Is this a long-haul project where collaboration across the 
team will make the difference? Is this a fly-under-the-radar project where 
innovation trumps the status quo?
That’s a lot to think about so let me break down my standard kickoff meeting 
agenda . . . and yeah, I have a template I follow for every project.
Melanie’s Kickoff Meeting Agenda
1.	 Who’s on the Team? Here I use a simple org chart graphic 
and it goes without saying that you need to spell every-
one’s name correctly and get the name each person pre-
fers to be called correct. Here’s a hint: it’s not “Mel”—it’s 
“Melanie”.
2.	 I call this section The Guidelines and it’s a single slide where 
I talk about my expectations for how the team will work. 
This is where I’m setting up the team dynamics. More on 
this later!
3.	 The Project Objective. This is a simple, concise statement of 
what the project is supposed to achieve. If I can’t come up 
with that “simple, concise statement,” then I know I’m not 
ready to hold a kickoff meeting, because I don’t understand 
enough about the project yet to convey it to my team. 
4.	 The Technical Overview. During this part of the agenda I 
have the technical lead spend 5–10 minutes giving the 
team a high level overview of the work. This isn’t meant 
to be a requirements session but rather a good intro-
duction to the challenges ahead—a springboard to get 
everyone thinking.

Managing Projects in the Real World
33
5.	 Next Steps and Major Milestones. I deliberately wait until 
after the technical overview to throw out the milestones 
into play, because I want my team to focus on what we 
have to achieve rather than freak out ’cause we don’t  
have enough time. If the requirements document is 
80%-complete, then I’ll also announce the start of the 
estimation process. Otherwise we talk about what work 
needs to happen right away.
6.	 Opens and Action Items. This last section is where we 
talk about meeting logistics: how often and when will we 
meet. Here I take the action item to set up the standing 
team meetings.
Okay, that’s my standing agenda to kick off any project, but I want to come 
back to The Guidelines in item #2. How often do you talk explicitly about your 
expectations with your team? I’m talking about things like the fact that you 
expect them to arrive on time to meetings and come prepared. Or that every-
one’s opinion is valued, will be heard, and seriously considered. Sure you can 
just assume that everyone understands these points as they are pretty much 
ingrained in our culture…but wait just a minute here! If you don’t explicitly state 
these expectations, aren’t you leaving a door wide open for misunderstand-
ings and frustrating behavior later on in the project? Hey, I get it! I know it’s 
downright awkward to say, “Melanie, I expect you to be on time and prepared 
for all team meetings.” I’m not so thrilled about having to do that one-on-one  
either, which is why I explicitly state these things in the kickoff meeting . . . for 
every project even if the team members have seen this stuff before. Finally, 
here’s a fun fact for ya: after I started explicitly stating my expectations for team 
behavior in kickoff meetings, I saw a noticeable decrease in people ­ditching 
my team meetings and a decrease in the number of folks who didn’t provide 
an update prior to the meeting if they had to bail. Coincidence? Possibly, but 
I think it’s more likely that by explicitly stating those guidelines, I’ve reminded 
folks of just how they are expected to behave as part of a team.
So, I bet you didn’t think I had that much to say about a kickoff meeting, huh? 
Again, this is one of the most important project meetings you’ll host and you 
really need to get this one right. If you do, you start off strong with a team 
that has a clear vision and the framework for working together. If you slap a 
kickoff together, then you’re going to spend bunches of time aligning all the 
functional areas on a common understanding of the scope of work—plus 
you’ve still got to figure out how to influence that team dynamic in the direc-
tion you want it to go. Having done just this many times, I can now say with 
conviction that an effective kickoff meeting makes a huge difference later on 
as you’re trying to move your team from the “storming” phase through to 
the “performing” stage.

Team Building
As you kick off a project, you start with a collection of people who are only 
loosely connected through the objectives of the project. Your goal then is to  
forge a cohesive team from this collection of people as quickly as possible. 
Sadly, many PMs never develop that cohesive team because they aren’t  
paying attention to the team dynamics, nor are they taking deliberate actions 
to define just what that dynamic will be. This chapter considers just what role 
the team dynamic plays in the overall success of your project. As a PM you 
most likely do not have direct authority over your teammates, so you need to 
understand how to motivate your team. How you motivate a team of drivers 
is very different than the techniques you would employ on a low priority proj-
ect. How would you like your teammates to interact for the best results? As 
the team leader you need to foster an environment that’s relaxed and open. 
How do you go about that? Well, stay tuned and I’ll tell you!
Team Dynamics
I think actively managing your team dynamic is important…but how the heck 
do you do that? This is another one of those areas of project management 
where you understand the words but have no clue of their actual meaning, so 
I thought I’d try to shed some light on the topic.
To demonstrate the importance of understanding the team dynamic, let me 
tell you a story about two teams I worked with a few years ago. The two dif-
ferent product development teams were part of a larger group that’s worked 
together for years. All team members are very good at their jobs and this 
makes it easy to manage these projects. Colocated, highly experienced team 
members? Can you say PM nirvana? ☺

I originally thought that these two teams would have similar dynamics and that 
I could manage the projects in similar ways. Well, it turns out I was wrong. 
While I’d realized that these two teams worked differently, it wasn’t until we 
moved to a new office location that I understood what was going on.
When my group moved to a new building and into new cubicles, I noticed 
something interesting. Most of my group elected to change their cube layouts, 
but a few kept their cube designs the same. In fact, these folks who didn’t 
change the layout also set up and decorated their cubes exactly the same way 
they were in the previous location. A few of the “changers” probably only 
changed due to the constraints of the new location, but still others took this 
opportunity to completely restructure their workspaces. Interestingly enough, 
one of the project teams is predominately “changers,” while the other one 
had all the folks whose cubes remained the same. This was the key to what 
was going on with the team dynamics.
I now think of the people who elected to completely change their cubes as 
change agents. These are the folks who actively seek out and embrace change. 
The team that has a majority of change agents on it moves much faster than 
the other team. In the team meetings, there’s usually someone proposing a new 
solution to a problem and it’s much more interactive, with everyone chiming in 
on any topic under discussion. Most of the time I feel like I’ve barely got hold 
of the reins and it’s all I can do to keep the horse focused on the bend before 
the straightaway sprint to the finish. In these meetings I rarely have to prompt 
anyone for their two cents and I often find myself dialing down the rhetoric so 
we can focus on the data. This team gets psyched by the big win such as imple-
menting never-before-used technology faster than we estimated. I try to keep 
them motivated with stretch goals and provide the big picture vision.
The second team is completely different and composed mostly of those who 
did not change their cube layouts. This team is quieter but no less focused. 
In the team meetings I pay more attention to who’s talking and who hasn’t 
weighed in on the issue under discussion, ensuring that everyone’s heard. This 
team is rock-solid and I feel more like the person with the map saying, “Head 
due east for 2 miles, then turn south.” I’m providing the navigation and they 
are the steady engine getting us to the destination. This team has also pulled 
off some amazing engineering feats, but they are quieter about it. I need to 
make sure I’m advertising what they’ve accomplished, because they are not 
likely to do it themselves. These guys are motivated by recognition of their 
respective contributions to the team, as opposed to some fantastical technical 
achievement. I struggled to find ways to inspire and motivate this team, yet the 
end product was delivered on time and of the utmost quality.
It’s fascinating how different the team dynamics are. On the surface, the teams’ 
makeup and experience levels are very similar, but trust me—what works 
well with one team can have very different results for the other. For instance, 
I started holding the team meetings in a physical room instead of virtually. 

Managing Projects in the Real World

The change-agent team almost rebelled, primarily because they had to take 
time to walk downstairs to the conference room. The other team seemed to 
welcome the change and I noticed that the flow of information in the meeting 
had really improved. You see, the second team really valued the opportunity 
to get together as a team, whereas the other team chafed at what they saw as 
an unnecessary hassle. Go figure. ☺
I honestly enjoyed working with both teams and they both challenged me in 
different ways. I hope I’ve convinced you to take some time and think about 
the dynamics of the various teams you are currently working with. Are you 
using the same tactics and tools for all of them? Are these tools really work-
ing across the board? Chances are the answer is no and it’s time to do some 
tweaking. I see this tweaking of the team dynamics as part of the art of project 
management. It’s not easy or well-defined, but the payoff when you get it right 
is stupendous!
If you’re a little fuzzy on just what I mean by team dynamic, that’s okay… it 
took me years to figure some of this stuff out and I don’t think I’ve truly  
mastered it yet. This is part of the “art” of project management, and it takes a 
lot of practice to actively shape and control your team dynamics.
By team dynamic I mean the way your team members interact—what  
constitutes the norm for behaviors within the team. That dynamic can be col-
laborative, trusting, relaxed, competitive, combative, uncomfortable, dysfunc-
tional, and so on. Each team behaves differently depending on its members. 
I believe that you can affect this dynamic through deliberate action. Let me 
give you an example. I once lead a team consisting of three highly competitive 
members plus two members who were motivated through their contribu-
tions to the team. To keep the highly competitive folks motivated, I set a 
challenging goal with a tangible reward if the team could hit one of the project 
milestones. The other two folks were motivated to contribute to the team 
goal. What this did was focus and motivate each team member on a common 
goal, despite having different motivators to get there. You see, by formulating 
a goal that required collaboration across the team, I was able to nudge that 
team dynamic in the direction I wanted it to go. Collaboration, not compe-
tition. Sure, I was trying to motivate the team, but I was also deliberately  
trying to establish collaboration as a norm for how we worked together. Make 
sense?
Now if you’re like I was, then this whole concept of deliberately trying to 
shape the team dynamic takes a long time to resonate. Many folks are honestly 
oblivious to this whole concept. They let these things drift and if they are 
really good at motivating individual team members, then every so often they 
luck into a team that works well together. The kicker here is that this is just 
serendipity and not really that repeatable. Here’s where you need to drink the 
Kool-Aid—you need to accept that you can shape the team dynamic through 
deliberate actions. Go ahead and take a big gulp…I’ll wait!

Chapter 3 | Team Building
38
Tastes good doesn’t it? Once you accept that you can actively influence the 
team dynamic, just how do you go about it? Well, before you can start influenc-
ing you need to know what you have to work with. Consider your team 
members. What motivates them? How are they interacting today? A good 
way to gauge this is to pay attention at the beginning of your team meetings, 
as everyone is joining the meeting. What’s the chitchat about? Who’s talking 
and who are they talking to? During the meeting, pay attention to how each 
person interacts with others and with the group. If someone asks for help, is 
help offered up freely and generously? Are some of your teammates getting 
impatient at the pace or quality of their peers’ output? Do you get a sense 
that everyone is engaged in the discussions? What you’re looking for here are 
patterns of behavior and clues about ways you can motivate the team.
After you know what you’ve got to work with, start formulating a strategy. 
The idea here is that you provide an incentive to motivate the behavior you 
want to be part of the overall team dynamic. Here are a few ideas to get you 
started thinking along these lines:
• 
For teams made up of highly competitive members: I’ve had 
pretty good success with tangible rewards (such as free 
food) for teams with a lot of very competitive members. 
Broad recognition at the org level can also fill that tangible 
reward, but that’s highly dependent on what motivates 
those folks. 
• 
For teams that haven’t worked together before: Work on deep­
ening the relationships between members. A good way to 
do this is to start off a conversation at the beginning of the 
meeting about what everyone did over the weekend. Even 
getting the meeting going with some comments about the 
weather will encourage conversation across the team. Try 
asking about kids or pets because most of us have one or 
the other or both. The goal here is to get team members 
to see each other in terms of common or unique interests. 
It goes like this…Melanie likes to bake cakes and so do I; 
therefore we have a connection that goes beyond the spe-
cific project we are working on at the time.
• 
For combative teams: Focus on expanding each person’s 
understanding of his fellow team members’ priorities and 
points of view. Here’s where you want to make sure that 
everyone understands just why it is that Melanie cannot 
add yet another I/O port to that design. See, some of 
your team members are going to believe at some level 
that I am out to spite them, whereas in fact there may 
not be any more physical space to put in that I/O port. 
Expand understanding and perspective across the team 
to dial down the confrontations you have to referee.

Managing Projects in the Real World

• 
For teams where members act as individuals rather than 
as a cohesive whole: Establish a distinct team identity. If 
you’ve got the budget, go get some T-shirts made up. 
Psychologically, we all want to conform to our peer 
group yet at the same time stand out from it. A common 
uniform, such as cool-looking shirts, fills both needs by 
allowing the team to conform amongst themselves yet 
stand apart from the larger organization. If you don’t have 
a budget for shirts, you can still develop a team identity 
through careful wording on your regular status updates 
and by referring to your team as a group. Here’s some-
thing I do all the time. Whenever my team and I go to an 
open forum, we tend to arrive en masse, and when we 
walk in, I’ll jokingly call out, “Project XYZ’s in da house!” 
That works with my personality and it always generates a 
chuckle but, more importantly, it reinforces that concept 
of team and uniqueness. Make sense?
Obviously, I could go on and on about this topic, but isn’t this enough to get 
you started? The key here is a deliberate strategy, and it’s an ever-evolving 
one at that. What works for this team today may be completely ineffective 
for the next one. Every team is different because this dynamic is really all 
about the interplay between members. Pay attention to what’s going on and 
actively work to shape the team dynamic, and you’ll find that your job gets a 
lot easier.
Motivating a Team
The ability to motivate others is a core skill for project managers. Let’s face 
it—your team doesn’t report to you, you don’t get to approve their time off, 
and, in some cases, you’re asking them to do stuff they’d rather not bother 
with. I see junior PMs struggle with this all the time. They honestly believe 
that people will do the work assigned to them simply because it’s their job 
to do so. What those PMs are failing to account for is the reality of working 
in a matrixed organization. It’s highly likely that every member on the team 
(including the PM!) has more work assigned than they can possibly do in a 
40-hour work week. To be perfectly blunt, you need to make people want to 
work on your project, and you do that through positive motivation.
Notice that I didn’t say negative motivation because—although that tactic will 
work—it is not a repeatable solution. You’re probably guilty of using some 
negative motivation from time to time. I was a master of it in a past life, I’m 
sad to say. Negative motivation involves compelling someone to do something 
they truly don’t want to do or is not in their best interests to do. Here’s a good 
example: during the estimation meeting, the PM repeatedly and aggressively  

Chapter 3 | Team Building
40
badgers the team members to provide low-ball estimates. The PM will walk 
away happy that the schedule meets the customer’s expectations, and the team 
walks away pissed that the PM pushed them into unachievable commits. In the 
end, the project will slip and most likely miss the customer commitment—all 
because the PM used the wrong motivation tool during estimation.
So what does positive motivation look like? Damned if I know! Seriously, it’s 
like that the Supreme Court standard for recognizing hardcore pornography, 
“I know it when I see it.” I take a Thomas Edison approach to motivating my 
teams: I just keep trying stuff till it works. What works for you today might 
not work on the next project. It makes sense to build up as many different 
techniques for motivating people that you can. Sorry, I really haven’t found any 
shortcuts for this. What I have discovered is a few tactics that have worked 
well for me, so I’m sharing them with you here.
Momentum Is Motivation
I once heard a motivational speaker who made the point that if things are 
moving in the direction you want them to, then you are more motivated 
to continue the behavior that is causing the motion. I like the idea of a link 
between motivation and momentum mostly because it makes sense to me. 
This is something I can translate to a variety of motivation techniques when 
I’m stuck for new ideas with a fresh team. This suggests some sneaky PM 
mind games…
For instance, an enterprising PM could look for opportunities to heap praise 
and recognition on their teammates for actions that move the project for-
ward. I’ve definitely found it valuable to praise someone (okay, it’s more of 
an email “Wahoo!” than wildly effusive praise) for turning around an action 
item faster than normal. The next time that person has an action item for my 
project, they’re more likely to do it faster. Hey, everyone likes to hear that they 
are doing something right, and if the PM helps build up some momentum for 
doing things right, then motivation is sure to follow.
How about that stealthy mind game of emphasizing your team’s wins during 
your regular project status report-outs? Your team does read those, you 
know. Build momentum around the idea that your team is a winner, and 
before you know it your team will be motivated to be winners. There’s also 
an added bonus that the rest of the organization will start to believe it, too. 
Pretty soon you will have this nice feedback loop that drives the motivation 
engine of your team.
I’ve also found that it’s hugely motivating for a team if the PM periodically 
reminds them of the hurdles they’ve already overcome. Keep reminding your 
team that they rock and you will find that over time they will really rock!

  If sincere but shrewdly calibrated praise isn’t your style, then please don’t try to fake it. 
Nothing is more demotivating than a poser PM who stands up there and says he has a “great” team 
while simultaneously throwing his teammates under the proverbial bus. Don’t be that PM!
A Few More Motivational Strategies
Free food can be a huge motivator if it’s done carefully. Here’s a news flash: 
the days of unveiling a box of donuts to wild praise and mass gorging are 
over. Most of us are eating healthier, and while the occasional donut is a treat, 
it’s just not that compelling. Heck, I could have picked one up on the way to 
work if I’d wanted one, right? For free food to be a motivator, it needs to be 
something special and it needs to be a reward for extraordinary effort, not 
just for showing up and breathing on the project. For instance, for one fast-
track project I ran, I committed to bringing in breakfast burritos for the whole 
team if we could pull in the release date from Friday to Monday. In this case 
the customer was ready for our deliverable early and it would make a real dif-
ference to the overall program schedule if my team could deliver even a few 
days earlier than planned. This wasn’t easy since we were already scrambling, 
but it gave the team a clear goal and reward to work toward. In the end, we 
made the pull-in, the customer was very happy, and my wallet was $30 lighter. 
So, for the cost of some burritos I got happy customers and a team that was 
just raring to tackle the next challenge.
Another excellent motivator is praise, but again you need to apply it care-
fully. Gushing over a teammate’s mediocre performance is not motivating; it’s 
creepy! Sending an email to someone’s boss extolling his “above-and-beyond” 
efforts for something he did on your project is an effective way to recognize 
superior performance and inspire more of the same. To really knock it out 
of the motivational park, copy the entire team and other managers if appro-
priate. Also, be sure to keep copies of these emails to use as material for 
360-feedback during the performance review cycle.
If you defer to someone else’s professional expertise and are open about trust-
ing their judgment, then you will find they are pretty motivated to work on your 
project. Everyone wants to be acknowledged for their experience and exper-
tise, and when you couple that with trust you have a great motivational tool.

  There is a great big caveat here, and that’s that the trust and deference you exhibit 
need to be completely sincere. If you doubt in any way that the team member in question knows what 
she’s talking about, don’t use this tactic. Misuse of this one will completely sink any future hopes of 
motivating this person.

Finally, here’s a motivational technique I’ve had quite a lot of success with:  
I set someone up to do something novel or different. By supporting their new/
different/radical idea, I convey my trust in their abilities—which can be hugely 
motivating. I’m not talking about asking someone to do something impossible, 
but rather enabling those good ideas that people already have.
What I Learned about Motivation from Teenagers
I was told that I was insane for doing it, but one summer I took my two nieces 
and my nephew, all teenagers, to Washington D.C. for the week of July 4th. 
In a last minute reality check, I also invited my mother along as adult backup. 
We were there for seven days and every day was an amazing adventure… for 
the kids and for my mother! For me it was a tactical challenge unlike anything 
I’d faced in recent memory. Did I mention that they were all teenagers? And 
that adult backup? She ended up falling into the teen camp so stealthily that I 
never saw it coming. So there I was camp counselor for a crew of four in the 
big, bad city.
Anyone who has teens, deals with them in any capacity, or has been one—in 
other words, everyone—knows that they are a lesson in motivation waiting 
to happen. If you’re not their parent (and sometimes that doesn’t even help), 
you aren’t going to have much success with an authoritative approach, and if 
you have even a smidgen of self-respect you try to avoid the wheedling, beg-
ging, and pleading approach. To save your sanity and someone from bodily 
harm, you have to motivate them into playing along. Surprisingly, I found this 
to be a familiar challenge: those teens weren’t so far from the engineers, 
planners, architects, and so forth whom I try to motivate in my day job as a 
project manager.
For the record, we all had a great time, but it did take me a day or two to get 
in the groove when it came to motivating my motley crew. So what did I learn 
on my summer vacation? Several things, actually:
First, 
• 
consultative decision making really works. 
That first day, I took the direct approach and made all 
the decisions without input. This led to what I now refer 
to as the Smithsonian Death March. You try leading a 
group of sullen teenagers through a fourth Smithsonian 
when they wanted to stop after the second one! Trust 
me, feeding them cannot reverse this situation. Being the 
seasoned project manager that I am, I changed tactics 
that evening in a desperate effort to remain in control. 
Each evening I’d casually drop the topic of what to do 
the next day into the post-dinner haze of contented-
ness. The kids and I would kick it around and come up 
with a loose plan for the next day. Teens, like your team, 

Managing Projects in the Real World
43
need to have a say in what you’re going to do. In this way, 
they are bought into the plan and feel some ownership 
for the overall success. After that first day, I didn’t have 
to deal with the “I’d-rather-pick-up-garbage-on-the-side-
of-the-road-than-be-here” teen attitude that I’m sure 
you’ve seen before. Hey, I owned that attitude when I 
was their age! 
Second, 
• 
to motivate people, you have to empower 
them. By the end of the second day, all three kids could 
navigate the Metro system as well as I could. They still 
had a little trouble with the electronic pass cards (how do 
they get completely wiped in a kid’s pocket?), but overall I 
no longer had to worry about the tactical aspects of daily 
navigation. I only had to strategically point out where we 
were going on the map and they figured out how to get 
there. Another example of this empower to motivate idea 
was how I’d set up their expenses. Each kid had to bring 
enough money to pay for lunch, snacks, and any souvenirs 
they wanted. This turned out to be pure brilliance because 
they got to eat what they wanted and never asked me to 
buy them a thing! But empowerment is not just about 
providing opportunity; it’s also about letting go. I didn’t 
control what they ate and, surprisingly, they never once 
ate a lunch consisting of candy bars, Doritos, and soda…
which is probably what I would have spent my money on 
at that age. In fact, they actually pooled their money or 
otherwise collaborated to get the best deal for the three 
of them. If I were paying, then there’s no way they would 
have come up with creative ways to save money, right?
Third, you have to 
• 
provide opportunities for new 
experiences. I’m continually fascinated by food and how 
it’s prepared, so I love trying out new restaurants when 
I travel. Each evening, we’d pick a dining destination from 
the slew of funky, hip, and ethnic neighborhood cafes. The 
first night, the kids were a little hesitant but game to try 
something new. Each night a new restaurant and the kids 
got braver with their choices until finally by the last night 
everyone was ordering “strange” stuff and having a blast. 
I’m sure my sister will be shocked when her son requests 
a pizza with pesto, shrimp, and chèvre! The really cool part 
is that he would never have tried that funky pizza if he 
hadn’t been motivated to try new experiences. Establish 
the motivation to go out and grab new experiences and 
you will inspire innovation and risk-taking in your team.

My “team” and I wrapped up that amazing week by sitting in a schoolyard on a 
hill overlooking the Mall. All along the skyline from the Lincoln Memorial to the 
Capitol fireworks sparkled like diamonds, with the most impressive “bursting 
in air” by the Washington Monument. It was an amazing trip and I completely 
cemented my rep as the Cool Aunt. But a funny thing happened along the way. 
I got a crash course in motivation. That’s the thing about soft skills: they come 
in handy in all kinds of places but are difficult to master. It’s a good idea to keep 
your eyes open for opportunities to practice them, especially outside of work. 
You just never know where you’ll find the next lesson.
The Truth Shall Set Your Team Free
Management guru Jim Collins points out four key strategies to building a team 
dynamic that is conducive to frank and honest discourse:1
1.	 Lead with questions, not answers.
2.	 Engage in dialogue and debate, not coercion.
3.	 Conduct autopsies without blame.
4.	 Build “red flag” mechanisms.
1.	 Leading with questions, not answers is pretty straightfor-
ward, and I’m pretty confident that I’m mastered this 
technique. It helps a lot to cultivate a curious nature and 
a desire to understand why things work the way they 
do. One trick I used to get better at the whole “asking-
questions” thing is to try to ask the “Why?” question 
at least five times. Make tick marks on a Post-It note 
or a corner of any bit of paper to keep track of how 
many times you’ve asked, so you can tell whether or not 
you’ve probed enough to get to the heart of the matter. 
You will have to twist “Why?” around a bit to get to five, 
but it’s fairly easy to do with variations such as “Why do 
you think that is?” or “Why is this important?” Now the 
1Excerpt on Fast Company (www.fastcompany.com/1802162/how-create-business-
where-truth-heard) from Jim Collins Good To Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap … 
and Others Don't (HarperBusiness, 2001). This book is an excellent read with lots of interesting 
examples of good and bad leadership. If you’re interested in building your leadership skills, 
then you owe it to yourself to check this book out.

Managing Projects in the Real World
45
number of questions isn’t as important as drilling down 
into the discussion to get to the real underlying issues. 
Trust me, when you actually get to the heart of the mat-
ter you’ll know, and I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised 
at the results. Oh, and one last thing—don’t be a dork 
and let anyone know that you’re counting the number of 
questions…that’s just a mnemonic to help you get bet-
ter at the drill-down technique.
2.	 The whole idea of engaging in dialogue and debate versus 
coercion is pretty much a no-brainer. However, it’s always 
a good idea to do a reality check from time to time and 
ask a few teammates (whose opinion you respect) if 
they think you employ coercion and how you do when 
it comes to setting up the team to debate an issue. Sadly, 
you might get a surprise from time to time, as it’s all too 
easy to slip into coercion when the chips are down and 
you can’t think of any other way out of the box. This 
feedback is essential if you want to continue to improve 
as a leader and as a project manager.
3.	 I really like the phraseology: Conduct autopsies without 
blame. I’ve done a lot of retrospectives, lessons-learned 
sessions, post mortems, and so on over the years, and it’s 
true that these are really hard to facilitate if the project 
was a disaster. Take a group of people who no longer 
feel like a team, all of whom feel that they will get blamed 
for the fiasco, throw in a perky retrospective coordina-
tor, and you have a recipe for an Excedrin Headache. If 
you allow the discussion to devolve into a blamefest, 
then nothing constructive will come out of that session. I 
know it’s cheesy, but I have been known to throw out the 
phrase—“Blame the game, not the playa!”—when things 
start unraveling. (Okay, you might want to be careful with 
that one… it works for me and my style but it’s one 
of those tactics that could go horribly wrong if you’re 
not careful!) This really is Leadership Showtime, so keep 
the discussion focused on what actually happened, why it 
happened, and never on the “who.”
4.	 Last, I have to admit that I didn’t remember this whole “red 
flag” mechanisms bit from the book. This ties pretty neatly 
into my existing risk management practice, but I think I 
need to develop some mechanisms for seeing those red 
flags on the business level—that is, what’s going on in my 
customer’s organizations and how can that clue me into a 

Chapter 3 | Team Building
46
potential failure early. This also comes into play when I’m 
thinking about my project budget. Come the end of the 
quarter, I’ve seen project budgets get shuffled around as 
the organization scrambles to balance the larger budget 
and meet commitments to the corporation. If the PM isn’t 
part of this process, then you sure need to understand 
what’s going on and how that could potentially impact 
your project so yeah, setting those “red flag” mechanisms 
in place makes a lot of sense.
Laugh It Up to Improve Your Team Dynamic 
Now let’s talk about some tips and tricks for effectively using humor to 
improve or maintain your team dynamics. Consciously using humor to achieve 
a specific result is tricky. Humor is subjective and not everyone will get your 
quirky sense of it. Further, if you are not absolutely crystal clear on the expec-
tations of its use in the workplace, you can fall into a very bad situation. That 
said, humor, specifically jokes, can be a very useful tool in a PM’s toolbox.
I use jokes as a way to lighten the mood and get potentially contentious 
meetings started off in a positive mindset. If a team is working on a difficult 
problem and people are putting in a lot of OT, then I pull out the “Joke of the 
Day” strategy. I’ve also used this strategy pretty successfully when the team 
dynamic is wavering and teammates are starting to turn on each other like 
inmates after a failed jail break. By kicking off the meeting in a positive mindset, 
you’re tee-ing up the tone for the rest of the discussion, and it can even dis-
tract some team members from grinding that axe they brought to the party.
The “Joke of the Day” strategy is pretty much what it sounds like. I’ll post 
a joke up for everyone to read as we assemble before the meeting officially 
starts. Everyone gets a chuckle or groan, depending on how bad the joke is, 
and then I move right into the agenda. Do not spend too much time on this, 
just jump right into the business of the meeting, and do not let the conversa-
tion veer into a joke-telling contest. You will seriously regret it if that conver-
sation goes too far.
The key to a good “Joke of the Day” is careful selection of the joke itself. This 
takes a little time and effort, so don’t try to pull one out of thin air five min-
utes before the start of a meeting. I use a children’s joke book as my source, 
but even then I have to work for it. I discard any jokes that rely on American 
slang, history, or culture out of respect for my geo-dispersed team. I also avoid 
anything that can even remotely be inappropriate. Finally, I try my best not to 
use something that could be construed as culturally insensitive. This actually 
leaves a very small subset of children’s jokes to work from.

To get you started, here are a few of my standards:
What do you get when you cross an elephant and a 
• 
skunk? … A big stink!
What do you call a sleeping bull? … A bulldozer!
• 
When is a river like the letter “T”? … When it must be 
• 
crossed!
Why didn’t the skeleton jump off the roof? … Because he 
• 
didn’t have any guts!
You get the picture here: cheesy jokes you would not mind telling your five-
year-old. In fact, in a weird way this adds value to some of your team members, 
because they inevitably go home and tell their kids these jokes and get a much 
bigger laugh than you will.
Now I have to send a shout-out to my buddy Steve Bell. Steve’s team used 
video conferencing and Steve came up with an ingenious way to bring a smile 
to his team and keep the team dynamic positive. He basically used a portable 
flip chart positioned behind him but in line with his webcam. He drew a series 
of “hats” to represent different emotions such as Mickey Mouse ears, devil 
horns, a halo, and question marks popping out of his head as the situation 
demanded. He also kept a selection of physical hats and one of his best tricks 
was to add a different hat to his head as he was given new scope to manage. If 
he ended up with a lot of work, then the ludicrous number of hats on his head 
made the point in a funny but straightforward way.
So you see, you can use humor effectively to improve your team meetings and 
the overall way the members interact. This is yet another example of taking 
deliberate actions to inform your team dynamic, and the best part about this 
one is that, for about an hour’s work, you can generate a safety stock of jokes 
to see you through your next month of meetings.

The “Special” 
Ones
As you learn and refine your craft, one thing all PMs come to realize is that 
how you initiate a project can have a profound effect on its overall success 
or failure. In fact there are the corner cases—what I like to call the “special” 
ones: the high-priority and low-priority projects as well as projects that feed 
into chaotic programs. Get assigned a high-priority project and you’ve got to 
hit the ground running and juggle a gazillion things at once. For a low-priority 
project you’re probably going to have to beg people to talk about it. And that 
project that feeds into a very chaotic program? Well, you just might pull out 
all of your hair trying to get that one started! Obviously your standard kickoff 
tactics aren’t going to be all that effective when dealing with these types of 
projects, so let’s talk about tactics that do work!
High-Priority Projects
High-priority or “hot” projects are a special case, and how they are initiated 
can have a huge impact on the project manager’s ability to influence the work 
throughout the life of the project.
First, let me quantify what I mean by a high-priority project. These are the ones 
with completely new tech, broader scope, new customers/markets, and more 
generous budgets. Everything about these babies is bigger, more challenging, 
and—heck—just downright more exciting. High-priority projects also come 
with some hard challenges. There’s usually a hyper-aggressive timeline that’s 
primarily market-driven, so there’s not much opportunity to push out or miss 
that market window. Miss the window and you might as well pick up your ball 
and find another playground. There’s much more visibility, and the PM will find

himself interacting with folks much higher up the food chain…Can you say 
stakeholder management? You bring your “A” game and then dive in—all the 
while knowing you will need some new tricks to make it to the finish line. Got 
the picture?
You typically see a sort of mass hysteria in the early stages of scoping these 
kinds of projects. There are a lot of unknowns and these are not your garden-
variety unknowns—oh, no. Instead, these are the things your team has never 
dealt with before and, trust me, they are freaked. The trick then is to get the 
team focused and motivated. Here are a few ideas to get you started:
1.	 Get the team focused on the requirements defini-
tion. You do this by setting up a specific timeline with a 
target date to have the requirements document frozen. 
Make it slightly aggressive to drive a sense of urgency 
and focus. Oh, and don’t forget to do due diligence and 
ensure that all affected parties review and approve of the 
requirements documentation.
2.	 Just be cool. I find that my teams will follow my lead. If 
I’m freaked out about the amount of work, then I convey 
a level of doubt about whether or not we can pull this 
one off. As the team leader, I need to remain confident 
and calm, steering the decisions and discussions toward 
data. There’s always at least one individual who’s wrapped 
around the axle a little tighter than the rest, and you need 
to calm that one down first. Think of what you’d do with a 
room full of toddlers high on birthday cake… you get them 
focused on a specific task right? Same logic applies here. 
3.	 Love the “bin” list. Yep, that’s right a “bin” list is your 
best friend early in the planning stages of a high-priority 
project. If the item under discussion is outside of your 
team’s ability to control, toss it in the “bin”. Handle that 
one offline, not during the team meeting. Remember, if 
your team can’t affect the problem, then you need to 
transfer it to some other team who can.
4.	 Lay out a preliminary timeline…even if it’s arbitrary. 
Figure out when you need the requirements frozen (or at 
least only slightly slushy), per item #1; set a goal for com-
pleting the work estimates; and schedule a planning ses-
sion. In short, get the balls rolling so you don’t lose more 
time than you can afford on the front end of the project.

Managing Projects in the Real World
51
5.	 Define an execution strategy. What lifecycle are you 
going to use? At a high level, how will the product be devel-
oped and tested? Do you need to engage Legal, HR, IT, and 
so forth? What collaboration is needed with other teams? 
Your team needs this strategy to use as a framework against 
which they will do the planning work. You can’t skip this 
step without rework and miscommunication later.
6.	 Play your ace-in-the-hole. Your project is a high pri-
ority for the division, so act like it. Need lab space? Play 
the priority card. Need to fast-track a budget approval? 
Start throwing around the project’s priority and escalate. 
In short, take ruthless advantage of the relative impor-
tance of your project versus whatever else is going on in 
the division. Remember, you’ve got to act like you have 
the hot one for others to believe it. 
7.	 Finally and most importantly, set the vision. Make 
sure each and every person on your team understands 
the business drivers for your project and what you need 
to achieve. They need to understand why this one is 
worth more than their usual best efforts—“This one’s 
gonna require all of us to stretch and learn new tricks.”
When you manage those big audacious high-priority projects the first thing 
you need to do is get your team focused and motivated. Use the strategies 
I’ve mentioned above to get off to a good start and fasten your seat belts…
this one’s gonna be fun!
Low-Priority Projects
Okay, now let’s talk about the dreaded low-priority project. This is the under-
appreciated one that no one views as important and whose budget and 
resources are slender. In short, this is the exact opposite of that pressure-
cooker, high-visibility circus you just brought in on time and under budget. You 
really need a break—but that low-priority project? Seriously? Can’t someone 
else, anyone else, do it? I’ve been there, my friend, and over the years I’ve 
learned a thing or two about these types of projects. They can be fun and the 
team can really innovate while the focus is on someone else.
The first thing you need to realize is that the techniques you use for a high-
priority fun ride may not work very well. First, you’re going to really flex your 
influence skills on this one. In a low-priority project, no one cares who you 
are and, trust me, the mere whisper of your sponsor’s name isn’t going to do 
you a bit of good. You have to work harder to convince people to help you 
and your team. You will need to exercise your network in new ways, so be on 
the lookout for opportunities to ask for help.

Chapter 4 | The “Special” Ones
52
Speaking of your team, you aren’t going to get the SMEs for this one. Nope, 
instead you will have a team of less experienced but hungrier players. These 
people are generally out to prove what they can do, and they will bring plenty 
of ideas to the table if you take care to establish a team dynamic that rewards 
fresh thinking. This is the place to use lavish recognition to reinforce that 
dynamic. Another way to motivate this team is to add value by hooking them 
up with new mentors and contacts. I’ve also had great success creating oppor-
tunities for the team members to experience what life is like either upstream 
or downstream from their specific area of expertise. Can you send a design 
engineer to the vendor who will eventually manufacture their design? How 
about having a planner help with the assembly of prototypes? This type of thing 
is pretty easy to set up and the return for the team member is just amazing.
There’s something else to look for on low-priority projects: your new team 
might not be locked into the “not-invented-here” mentality that sometimes 
creeps into organizations. I guarantee that they will have ideas that haven’t 
been considered by other project teams. There’s goodness here if you can tap 
into it. One way this comes into play is with spending. Low-priority projects 
just have smaller budgets and you often have to figure out how to deliver the 
final product on a shoestring. Challenge your team to think of more efficient 
ways to do things, to do smarter design, and scrutinize every feature to make 
sure it’s really needed. I once managed a low-priority project in which we 
essentially made the case that we shouldn’t develop the product at all! Yep, we 
found a way to deliver the data the customer really wanted without design-
ing a thing. The savings from this was just slightly over a million bucks, so the 
company saved big and we all had a really nice accomplishment for our yearly 
performance review!
Another thing you will need to realize is that this baby will run at a slower 
pace if you let it. PMs coming off of huge projects tend to try to manage these 
lower-priority projects at the same pace. There’s probably no need for this, 
so don’t stay up half the night with your email account just because you’ve 
been operating at that pace for the last year. Instead, focus on improving your 
work habits so that you get more done in the day. Test-drive new technology 
for communicating with the team, such as blogs, forums, or wikis. This is your 
opportunity to innovate as a PM too!
I bet you’re ready to go off and volunteer for one of these projects now, 
right? Well, before you do that, I should probably break down a few of the 
negatives for you. First it’s highly likely that you’ll be dealing with, shall we 
say, undermotivated individuals? You will need to motivate someone who’s 
probably burnt out, bitter, or just plain difficult. This can be a real challenge,  
so make sure you take this person seriously and address the problem early.
Second, did I mention that no one cares? Well, they don’t until things go bad, 
so be sure you’re managing your stakeholders carefully. As always, it’s critical 
to understand what success looks like for each stakeholder. Just don’t be 

Managing Projects in the Real World
53
surprised if they don’t have time for you or your project. Additionally, these 
projects are always the first to get raided when the higher-priority projects 
need more resources. As the PM, you need to be especially vigilant about the 
point of no return. Don’t let your team flounder on a project that has been 
raided to the point of failure. You may need to recommend that the project 
be killed in order to be successful in the end.
Last, for these projects you need to accept the environment they live in. You 
probably aren’t going to get more headcount so don’t waste your energy 
going after it. Instead, figure out how to be successful in spite of the environ-
ment…this is where that innovation thing comes in! ☺
I’ve found that these low-priority projects are fun to manage. They are a 
chance to recharge both physically and mentally so that I’m rarin’ to go for 
the next big one. I get a lot of personal satisfaction from managing teams in 
which the dynamic is collaborative and we are doing new and exciting work.  
I hope I’ve convinced you that getting that low-priority project is a good thing 
and that I’ve given you some food for thought about how to manage this type 
of project in the future.
Chaotic Programs
What do you do when your project feeds into a larger program that’s a high-
complexity, high-ambiguity environment? These programs bring to mind the 
tornados I’ve experienced back in Texas. You see, a tornado has a calm spot 
in the dead center where the violent chaos of swirling winds subsides—the 
fabled eye of the storm. Leading a team in a highly ambiguous environment is 
tough and most PMs struggle with this; I know I do! You can’t nail your project 
plan due to those open requirements, low-confidence commits for dependen-
cies your team needs, unclear expectations from your fellow program PMs, and 
so forth. These situations take “tolerance for ambiguity” to a whole new level, 
and as a PM you’re going to want to minimize the impact on your team as much 
as possible. In short, you want to position your project team in that “eye of the 
storm” and have the program’s chaotic ambiguity swirl around you.
Over the years, after participating in many program teams, I’ve developed 
a few tricks of the trade to deal with these situations. So, for the benefit of 
anyone struggling to lead a team in one of these tornados, here are a few tips 
and tricks I’ve had success with in the past:
The first thing a PM needs to do in this type of program is 
• 
drive clarity.  Yeah, I know, like that’s not obvious! 
Here’s what I do: I drive a stake in the ground by 
––
defining some key milestones. These are, coincidentally, 
milestones my team can definitely meet. For example, 
when I lead board development projects, I’d go into 

Chapter 4 | The “Special” Ones
54
a planning session with a date my team could deliver 
boards. For the other project teams on the program 
who hadn’t finished their planning yet, having the 
board dates defined helped them build a plan around 
my date. Bottom line: Define key dates and then 
let the rest of the program spin around your 
dates. Note that you will frequently have to move 
your date as the overall program planning matures, 
but at least you will be able to drive clarity in the 
beginning.
––
Another way to drive clarity is to be extremely 
clear in your communication of dates and 
requirements. Use phrases like “drop-dead date” and 
“day-by-day slip” rather than stating that a dependency 
has a “need-by date”. For loose or open requirements, 
succinctly define your team’s understanding of the 
requirement and state that unless you hear otherwise 
you consider this the requirement of record and your 
team will proceed accordingly. Do not leave room for 
discussion or interpretation in the communication. If 
anyone disagrees with the interpretation, then they will 
have to speak up.
This last tip on how to drive clarity is something I’ve 
––
truly learned the hard way, and it’s this: Know when 
to offer alternatives and when not to. If you’ve 
ever walked out of a program planning meeting with 
a ton of what-if scenarios to analyze, then you know 
where I’m coming from. In these situations, I’ll make 
my recommendation to the program team as a single 
course of action. I expect my fellow team members 
to question and discuss the recommendation 
and, if serious objections come up, I’ll pull out an 
alternative… but I always open with only one choice as 
the official recommendation. Most of the time—always 
assuming I’m in sync with all stakeholders—that one 
recommendation is accepted much faster than if I’d 
thrown out a smorgasbord of options. As I see it, it’s 
my job as a member of the program team to do the 
evaluation of the options—not to push that analysis 
onto my peers.

Managing Projects in the Real World
55
The second thing a PM needs to do in these environ-
• 
ments is to protect their team from the inevitable churn. 
Give your team clear direction and don’t distract 
them with the possibility of a course change until 
its POR. One of the jobs of the project manager is to 
take the various discussions at the program team level 
and distill them into actionable information for their proj-
ect team. Don’t spend a lot of energy passing through 
data that your project team doesn’t need to do their job. 
If the program team is kicking around the idea of adding 
some new requirements due to changing market condi-
tions, don’t float that down to your team until it’s clear 
that the program team is going to adopt them; then use the 
change control process to assess the impact of adding 
these requirements. Often PMs think that they are doing 
their team a favor by giving them a head’s-up that changes 
are coming but, in fact, most of the time it’s distracting to 
the project team. Keep them focused on the work they 
are committed to do, and then manage the change so that 
the impact to your team is minimized.
The final thing a PM has to do to protect his or her team 
• 
is to make decisions, even though often without 
enough data. Nothing slows down or distracts a team 
more than an ambiguous direction. As the PM you are 
expected to lead this team and that means making some 
decisions you might not be comfortable with. If the team 
needs a decision on how to implement a requirement and 
you’re unable to get closure from the stakeholders, then 
as the leader you need to make a call here. If the team 
has concerns about a design, you may need to decide to 
spend money on prototypes… even if you don’t think you 
have the authority to spend that money. The good thing 
about these kinds of decisions is that the more decisions 
you make, the better you get at it. You aren’t always going 
to make the right call, but over time you’ll make more 
good decisions than bad. The key here is to make clear 
decisions and then be accountable for the consequences, 
both good and bad. That’s your job as the PM.
A lot of us work in a highly chaotic, fast-paced environment today. I remem-
ber back in the ’80s when the phrase “tolerance for ambiguity” was on nearly 
every job req. Who could have guessed what that looked like in the real world 
of business today? This stuff is hard, very hard, and your job as the PM is to 
develop some skills to help your team reach that “eye of the storm.”

Planning Phase
II
P A R T  

You Have to Do 
the Work 
Planning is perhaps the most important phase of any endeavor, and it’s  
certainly true of all programs or projects. Sadly, the planning phase is also the 
least appreciated and it’s not uncommon for junior PMs to cut this phase short, 
to produce a weak schedule and continue forward without a fully thought-out 
execution strategy. It’s my opinion that the primary reason projects fail is that 
the planning was inadequate. Of course, you can’t plan for every bad throw 
of the dice, but you definitely can ensure that you have a solid execution plan 
that allows enough flexibility to roll with those dice when the need arises.
Project Plans Are NOT Created in MS Project
I have a pet peeve and it’s when I hear people refer to their schedule as a 
project plan. That’s just not right, and it demonstrates that the person talking 
doesn’t understand what a project plan should be. You see, a project plan is 
quite extensive and is not created in MS Project! A project plan does include 
the schedule, but it also includes so much more. To refer to the schedule as 
the project plan is sort of like referring to a piece of pepperoni as though it 
were the entire pizza! If all you got for dinner was the pepperoni, then you’d be 
mighty hungry before bedtime now, wouldn’t you? Likewise, a project plan that 
includes only a schedule is bound to leave you scrambling later in the project.
According to the Project Management Institute (PMI), a project plan includes 
the scope management plan, the work breakdown structure (WBS), the schedule 
management plan, the cost management plan, the quality management plan, the 
process improvement management plan, the staffing management plan, the com-
munication management plan, the risk management plan, and the procurement

management plan—to name just a few. Whew, I’m tired just typing all of that! 
This sounds like it was developed by Dilbert’s friendly management consultant 
doesn’t it?
The problem with this smorgasbord of plans is that for smaller projects, this 
all-inclusive master plan is overkill. Some of the plans drop out naturally. For 
instance, if your project doesn’t include purchasing, then you don’t need a 
procurement management plan. Likewise, if your project is very short, then 
you probably don’t need a process improvement plan. However, there are a 
few of these babies that you really should be doing even if you don’t create a 
100-page manifesto to document your project plan.
One of these lesser-known plans I always use is the communication manage-
ment plan. My plans are usually one page long and capture how I plan to com-
municate the project status both externally and internally to the team, as well 
as who the stakeholders are and what their comms preferences are. Believe it 
or not, some people actually prefer a phone call to an email and some stake-
holders will only want a monthly update. The 30 minutes that I spend thinking 
about and documenting this plan is always helpful when planning a project. 
The other upside to spending time on a communication management plan is 
that I can clearly let people know how and when they will get project status 
before they start asking for it. This helps me avoid the trap of always having to 
provide the same status to different stakeholders day after day on an ad hoc 
basis. I really hate it when that happens!
Another plan I always pay attention to is the risk management plan. I’ll talk about 
my risk management technique later in more detail, but I want to mention it 
here as well. By identifying the big risks early and actually putting plans in place 
to manage them while still in planning, I find that the team is surprised less 
often. Having that plan in place also seems to dial down the stress when the risk 
is actually triggered. Everyone knows what to do, so there’s less management 
“help” to address the risk. One of the best compliments I’ve ever received as 
a PM was when a teammate commented that he was surprised at the lack of 
firefighting we had to do. I attribute that 100% to our risk management plan.
Okay, true confessions time: I never do a staffing management plan, because  
I don’t have a lot of control over who gets assigned to my projects. Nor do  
I do a cost management plan because, again, I have very little control over the 
biggest cost driver, the resources. And finally a comment about procurement 
plans. Yes, I’ve developed them when the project in question required a lot of 
procurement. However, I find it a bit ironic that the PMs should be responsible 
for tracking procurement and the associated costs, when they are not the 
expense approvers. It’s been my experience in highly matrixed organizations 
that the PM does not have any formal power over the project budget and 
associated costs. At best, the PM must affect these areas through influence 
and, at worst, clearly communicate any consequences and alternatives as a 
result of budget decisions.

So, I hope this has helped you understand a bit more about what a project plan 
truly is. I highly encourage you to review the various plans that make up a com-
prehensive project plan and use what makes sense for each project. Remember 
you’re developing this puppy during the planning phase, which means you really 
should consider these things prior to kicking off project execution.
Bad Ideas
Okay, now let’s talk about some really bad ideas that can come up during the 
planning phase. Often, folks will sidestep the work of planning by adopting 
a “do-whatever-it-takes” approach or simply avoid the work altogether by 
replacing planning with hope. Neither of these muddle-through strategies ever 
works, yet you still see them in use from time to time. It’s also a bad idea to fall 
under the spell of what quality assurance professionals call the “happy path.” 
You know what they say about things that sound too good to be true. Finally, 
you see a failure in the planning when a project team is working an insane 
amount of overtime—failing to account for all of the work will inevitably 
result in unanticipated overtime. So, let’s talk about these really bad ideas and 
what you should do instead.
Do Whatever It Takes
Every once in a while I still hear someone question the value of developing 
a detailed schedule or even profess to not creating one at all. Just the other 
day a colleague of mine mentioned that his team had given up developing 
detailed schedules because it was just too hard and took too much time. Not 
everyone sees the connection between a well-planned project and high-confi-
dence customer commits. There’s a prevailing “do-whatever-it-takes” attitude 
in some organizations where customer commits are made with rough top-
down estimates and the rank and file scramble like mad to get the work done 
any way they can. The management chain holds the PM and the project team 
accountable for hitting those commits despite their tenuous link with reality. 
The PM is told (or tells their team) that they need to “do whatever it takes” 
to make the commit, so the entire team jumps in and starts working with only 
a minimal plan. I’m sure you know what I’m talking about here, right?
One of the problems with the “do-whatever-it-takes” strategy is that it com-
pletely ignores the actual work content of the project. In my experience these 
top-down estimates are only loosely based on historical data and they are 
almost never based on actual project hours or actual dollars spent on an ear-
lier, similar project. To exacerbate the problem, if the PM doesn’t take the time 
to build a realistic project plan then no one knows whether that “do-what-
ever-it-takes” commit is realistic until it’s too late. The marketing team made 
a commitment to the customer to deliver the product at a specific time based 

Chapter 5 | You Have to Do the Work 
62
on commits from the program team that were done before the requirements 
were finalized and the full scope of work realized. When this happens, “pulling 
in the schedule” becomes the norm instead of the exception and practically 
everyone in the organization is overworked because there’s no such thing as 
pipeline management. Sound familiar? Sadly, I thought it might…
Another problem with the “do-whatever-it-takes” execution strategy is that 
does not take into account the real world calendar we must accommodate. 
Pesky things like national holidays and personal vacations all hit the chopping 
block as the management team struggles to find a way out of a poorly conceived 
customer commit. I once got burned by neglecting to account for a week-long 
shutdown at the end of the year. I was operating under the “do-whatever-it-
takes” mindset but neglected to accommodate the fact that the entire building 
would be powered down for some planned facilities maintenance over the holi-
days. The result was that the entire team worked like mad over every weekend 
in January to “recover” a schedule. At the time, I was so busy trying to keep all 
the balls in the air that I completely missed the fact that there was no way to 
recover the schedule with the resources we had. Exhorting the whole team to 
work harder did not fix the problem because there was more work to be done 
than could possibly get done in the limited timeframe we had…and because I 
hadn’t done a solid project plan I didn’t even know that it was impossible. D’oh!
And finally the biggest problem I see with the whole “do-whatever-it-takes” 
mentality is that it completely ignores industry best practices. Would you drive 
your car in the opposite lane just because it’s open and there’s no oncoming 
traffic? Of course you wouldn’t because that is not the best way to move the 
vehicle down the road—it’s not the best known method…oh, and there’s that 
whole legal thing as well. So if you’ve received your PMP, then how can you 
completely ignore best practices and “wing it” by blindly accepting the “do-
whatever-it-takes” directive? It’s your job as a professional to point out what 
exactly it will take to execute the project relative to the resources that are 
available. Throwing up your hands and saying that you and your team will get 
it done “somehow” because “it just needs to happen” is a cop-out and you 
can do better. Don’t ignore your responsibility to do the work of planning 
the project because the organization has told you to “do whatever it takes.” 
Whenever I hear a PM say that the team needs to “do whatever it takes” or 
the ever popular “it just needs to happen,” I know that he doesn’t have a solid 
project plan. Don’t be that person! Do the work!
Hope Is Not a Strategy
If I had a nickel for every time I’ve heard it I’d …well, I’d be able to buy a really 
nice handbag. I’m sure that you’ve heard it too. It goes something like this: “I 
hope to have the CAD files to you by Friday,” or “We’re hoping to get those 
actuators in on the 15th,” or even “Hopefully the testing will wrap up by the 
end of the month.” Yep, I’m talking about that four-letter word, hope.

Managing Projects in the Real World
63
Now it’s not like I’ve got anything against the word, and in fact I think you 
should live a hopeful life. But the thing is: hope is not a strategy, nor is it a 
meaningful commitment. I’m hopeful that there’s a hot fudge sundae in my 
immediate future, but I don’t really know if I’m gonna get one. If I’m talking 
about a project plan, then I’d darn well better know if that sundae is waiting 
for me, and my team and I need to know if it’s got nuts or not.
Whenever I hear colleagues use the H-word in the context of a commit or a 
plan, there’s a blaring claxon kicking off in my head. Hope usually translates into 
something like this:   “I have no clue how much more work I have to do on those 
CAD files,” or “I seriously doubt that the vendor can deliver those actuators 
when they say they will,” or even “I can’t even guess how long the testing will 
take.” In these situations I dial back the pressure and start asking questions.  
I want to help the other person understand how much work is left, how the 
vendor’s past performance informs their commit, what our historical data pre-
dict, and so forth. I need to make it okay for my colleague to step back from a 
commit she thinks I want to hear and give me a realistic one instead. You see,  
I can’t plan around a hope—what I really need is a high-confidence commit.
There’s another problem with the H-word that I’d guess most people miss. 
When you provide a “hopeful” commit or plan of action, you are communi-
cating your own lack of confidence. In the previous examples, using the word 
“hope” implies a certain amount of doubt. I can’t expect anyone to take me 
seriously if I don’t believe what I’m committing to. I need to know when I can 
deliver those CAD files. Although that vendor has committed to a delivery 
date of the 15th for those actuators, that vendor sucks—so I’ll commit those 
bad boys for the 20th, which is a much higher-confidence commit on my part. 
Think of it this way: If your surgeon tells you that he hopes he can remove 
the correct kidney this time, are you going to let him within cutting distance 
of yours anytime soon? Not a chance right? So when you are delivering a 
commitment, just don’t use the H-word. Pad your commit until it’s a high-
confidence one if you need to. Just don’t drag hope into it.
A hope is nothing tangible. Basing your project plan or your execution strategy 
on a hope is dopey. As a PM, you should strike that word from your vocabu-
lary when you’re negotiating or providing commitments. If your colleagues use 
hope as a dodge for a high-confidence commit, then you need to dig a little 
deeper and probably accept a later date. Remember, you can’t plan on a hope. 
Sometimes the fix is as simple as a word choice; other times more elbow 
grease is required to understand what’s really going on. The next time you 
find yourself getting beat up for a commit, make sure you’re not dragging hope 
into the picture. And as for that hot fudge sundae? Well, here’s hoping there’s 
a great big one in your future, too!

Taking the Happy Path
There’s this place you might have visited lately. I call it Happy Land and to get 
there you take the Happy Path. When you’re there, you and your team are in 
a blissful state of mind where anything seems possible and that big audacious 
project you’re trying to scope—well, that’s a sure thing and you can definitely 
knock it out in six weeks. Heck, you guys can bend the laws of physics to 
overcome some minor technical challenges, right? And frozen requirements? 
Who needs ’em? You guys are innovators! Heck, while you’re here you might 
as well fix a couple of nasty broken business processes, too.
Thwack! That’s my hand upside your head. Sorry, it just had to be done. You 
see I’ve been where you are now and I’ve just gotta break it to you… there 
ain’t no way to get there from where you are now. Of course I’m talking about 
that point in a big project where everyone has to stop talking about the “big 
picture” and start planting those stakes in the ground—the point at which 
you really have to put pixels to work listing all of the major deliverables, the 
sub-tasks, the dependencies, the risks, and so on. For your teammates that 
happens about 20 minutes into the planning session’s activities. For PMs it 
can come much sooner, and then you face the sometimes enormous task of  
moving people off the Happy Path and into the Real World.
In case you’ve never heard the term Happy Path, let me break it down for 
you. It’s a validation/quality assurance term of derision that basically repre-
sents a test scenario where everything works as expected and any potential 
defects are avoided through judicious crafting of the test plans. It’s a land 
where defects are scarce and the sun always shines. You’ve probably over-
heard some overworked QA engineer mutter something like…“Stupid happy 
path testing! I told them peanut butter was a real possibility! But did they 
listen? No-o-o.” (In case you’re wondering, peanut butter fills tummies just fine 
but never electronics—never! Just sayin’…)
So here’s how it goes: You’ve kicked off the planning session and made sure 
everyone agrees on the high-level objectives and deliverables. By the way, at 
this point your teammates are either super-energized or they are numb with 
dread over the looming amount of work. Then your team starts breaking out 
work packages and so far so good. Everyone is still in Happy Land for the most 
part. You know what comes next: the estimation process. After that you fight 
through the Network Diagram and everyone starts to visualize the project 
timeline. Cue the Jaws music right here! Suddenly it starts sinking in for every-
one that the only way this will take six weeks is with some amphetamines and 
a time bender. Now since you don’t endorse chemical enhancements and you 
can’t bend time with your bare hands, you’ve got to do something else. What, 
oh what, is a PM to do?
Bring on the historical data! Yep, sometimes you need to throw a bucket of 
cold water reality on some of your teammates who are pretty darn happy  

Managing Projects in the Real World
65
living in Happy Land. Now there’s nothing wrong with being excited about 
a new project, and there’s nothing really wrong with thinking it can be done 
much faster than this type of thing has ever been done before….but you really 
need to back it up with data. If the team has never delivered anything this 
complicated in under six months, then realistically six weeks ain’t happening—
now is it? If you can pull up some data from past projects and take a high-level 
look at what it took to accomplish them, then, my friends, you can interject 
some reality. Remember, we’re supposed to be engaging in informed risk-taking, 
not tripping merrily down the Happy Path. Okay, I hear you: ”But Melanie I 
don’t have any historical data! What am I supposed to do now?” Well, if you 
can’t find any performance data for projects similar to yours, start looking at 
industry standards. Sure, they may not be super-accurate, but they will get you 
where you need to go. For instance, there’s a standard that says that for every 
month of code development you need one week of testing. Oh, and for the 
sake of your own sanity, start collecting some data so the next time you need 
historicals you’ve got them.
Let me be clear here. It’s not so much that those plans developed in Happy 
Land are bad. We all need big juicy targets to strive for, and as a PM you 
should be setting some meaningful stretch goals for your team. I absolutely 
love working with a team that’s innovating to hit one of these targets. It really 
forces you to go back to basics to look at how the work gets done and figure 
out how to do it differently. That’s the good side of Happy Land. All I’m saying 
here is just make sure there’s a realistic chance of achieving those targets 
before you commit to a timeline. Sure, the Happy Path to project success 
makes you feel good, but it really is the road less traveled, isn’t it?
I realize that some of you are currently living in Happy Land. Enjoy it while 
you can. It’s nice there, isn’t it? Pass the sunscreen and the lasagna, would you? 
When you’re ready to come back to the Real World, use some data to put 
some reality into your Happy Path plan—but try to bring some of that excite-
ment and innovation along with you when you come back.
Overtime = Planning Failure
We all do it from time to time. We mostly hate it, but we still do it. I did it a lot 
early in my career when I got paid specifically for it. If you’re a PM, then you’ve 
probably forced people to do it or they’ve had to do it because you didn’t do 
your job. I’ve done it when I’ve failed to manage my time and/or my workload. 
By far the most common reason it’s done, though, is because organizations fail 
to do due diligence when planning. What am I talking about? Overtime! If you 
find yourself doing a lot it, then I’ve got just one word for you… fail!
When I started working in high tech, like a lot of you I was younger and 
getting paid by the hour. Overtime (OT) was big money and it was motivat-
ing after coming off of years of scrimping and scraping to get through college. 

Chapter 5 | You Have to Do the Work 
66
In short, I worked as many hours as they’d let me and I loved it! Then came 
a period of time where I defined success through promotions at work, and 
those promos required plenty of OT. I remember working on the team that 
developed the first 300mm semiconductor processing equipment where we 
all worked 12-14 hour days all the time, but we didn’t care because we were 
doing something important. Most of us got promoted for that work too.
Around about this time I started managing projects, so then I was the person 
doing such a crappy job that my team had to work OT to hit the dates I’d 
committed to our customers. Let’s just say that I mastered the skill of strong-
arming a team into working weekends. Eventually, I also mastered developing a 
comprehensive schedule. I started incorporating things like company holidays and 
team members’ vacations. I started using actual Work Breakdown Structures, 
Network Diagrams, and resource leveling. In short I was mastering my craft 
and as a result my teammates and I started working a lot less OT.
As I came to realize what a solid project plan looked like, I also came to have 
less and less tolerance for poorly planned projects and programs. I started 
noticing when the org I worked in didn’t manage their project pipeline. These 
orgs are populated with overworked folks who buy into the “do-whatever-it-
takes” fantasy when it comes to planning. There’s usually a prevailing culture 
of “gaming the system” to get projects or even programs funded, and none of 
them ever really get canceled. Now it’s true that not all organizations roll like 
that, but those that do expect plenty of OT from their personnel.
These days I have a much healthier perspective on working overtime. Over 
the years I’ve developed my own personal OT litmus test. You see, I’ll suck 
it up and do the OT if it’s for a specific purpose that supports an important 
deliverable, and has a defined end state. I do not do OT to maintain the 
status quo. Further, as a general rule, I no longer work weekends or week-
nights. Sure, there’s the occasional thing that comes up once in a while, but 
for the most part I work M–F, 8–5pm. In all fairness, part of the reason I can 
keep my hours to 8–5 is due to the particular job I have. If I spent a lot of 
time working multiple geos, then I’d obviously have to work different hours. 
But when that happens I still keep it to 40 hrs/week. It’s a matter of personal 
discipline for me.
So, that’s my take on OT. What about you? How many hours are you throw-
ing down these days? Are you okay with that? If not, then perhaps it’s time to 
take a good, long look at the kind of work you really want to do. Remember, 
you’re going to spend the majority of your waking hours at work so it ought 
to be something you enjoy. Oh, and OT? Well, that should be an occasional 
occurrence and not the status quo.

Managing Projects in the Real World
67
The Craftsmanship of Planning
Despite what some of your teammates might think, there’s much more to 
planning a project than figuring out requirements and a schedule. There’s an 
art to project management, and at first blush you probably don’t see it, but 
trust me—a well-planned project is worth the time it takes to do the job right. 
I focus now on the craftsmanship of planning a project.
First up, the one element everyone associates with a project plan: the sched-
ule. While the mechanics of building a schedule are straightforward, there’s a 
certain craftsmanship that’s needed to produce useable schedules that actually 
enhance the project’s execution. Not all project schedules are created equal, 
nor do they all need to be created in specialized software. What you’re after 
is a schedule that can be used in multiple ways to enhance clarity and drive 
better decisions. There’s also some artistry in how you organize the informa-
tion in your scheduling tool. I like to break work up into the lifecycle phases 
and then subdivide it into work packages (or functional groups, depending 
on what makes sense). I also set up my own custom views. And while we are 
talking about views, I like to set mine up to see SPI, % Complete, Remaining 
Work, Baseline Finish, and the Finish trend date. How you set up your default 
view in whatever application you are using is up to you and its part of this art 
thing I’m talking about.
A well-crafted project plan has an explicit execution strategy that’s docu-
mented and bought off on by the entire team and the key stakeholders. I like 
to host a brainstorming session to kick around various execution strategies. 
What work will we do in parallel? What’s the impact of reducing the scope of 
testing? Can we meet the business drivers some other way? What features/
functions can we cut or push to a future release? Where and when do we 
need specialized resources? While I was a PM for a printed circuit board 
(PCB) development team, we came up with a viable solution for the business 
driver that basically negated the need for the PCB we were tasked to develop. 
In IT, where I currently reside, there’s an almost overwhelming trend toward 
the Agile methodology for software development, but that doesn’t mean it’s a 
good fit for all projects. So part of the art of project management is a thought-
ful selection of the execution strategy, and it’s something the entire team 
needs to participate in.
Another piece of the overall project plan that requires some careful and  
creative attention is your communications plan. To be honest, it takes quite 
a bit of experience within an organization to understand just who the key 
stakeholders are and how they prefer to get their updates. Some prefer an 
“always-on” source of project updates, while others want you to look them 
in the eye when you provide your commits. There’s a whole truckload of 
soft skills at play in this area, and one solution does not fit all. If you haven’t 
been giving a lot of thought to this area of your overall planning, then I highly 

Chapter 5 | You Have to Do the Work 
68
encourage you to take some time and really think about how you can do this 
better. So many PMs take the easy route and just shoot out a standard email 
update, but there’s a world of creativity out there to draw on. So apply some 
craftsmanship here and you will definitely reap the rewards.
Now, let’s not forget your team dynamic when you’re in the planning phase. 
This is Soft Skills Central and those really good PMs craft a deliberate  
strategy for inspiring and nurturing the kind of team dynamic that best suits 
the project. Are you going to be shorthanded on this project? Then you’d darn 
well better start thinking about how you foster a team dynamic where every-
one is willing to step up and fill a gap. Is this project extremely challenging 
from a technical perspective? If so, then you’re going to want your team to be 
extremely innovative and that team’s dynamic will probably look a lot different 
from that of your run-o’-the-mill project team. Trust me, this doesn’t happen 
automatically nor does it solely rely on “good” people. You need to think 
about what team characteristics you need to foster and how you will motivate 
those characteristics. Oh, for the record—I never thought specifically about 
this stuff until I’d been managing projects for a good many years. So learn from 
my past and jump on this now to save yourself a lot of frustration later.
Finally, we come to what I consider the overall art of planning: that’s having 
an intuitive feel for when you’ve done enough planning and it’s time to get 
started on the work. It’s been my experience that those of us in the high-tech 
world want to jump right into the doing and let the planning sort itself out. 
I’ve honestly never encountered a high-tech project that took way too long to 
plan. We just don’t play that way in high tech. I’ve heard various rules of thumb 
for how long planning should take, and there seems to be some consensus 
around 20% of the total project time should be devoted to planning. Today my 
projects run around 16%. (I know my average is 16% because I analyze how 
the project work breaks out across phases at the end of every project.)
The bottom line is that the PM needs to make sure that everyone fully  
understands the project objectives and knows what work they need to do 
and by when—all before they get too far down the execution road. It might 
be helpful to look at a few of your past projects and see just how much time 
you’re spending in the planning phase. Bounce that data against your perfor-
mance schedule metrics, the total number of change requests, and your defect 
data to get a feel for whether you’re spending enough time planning. It can 
be tough to hold the team to the planning when they are chomping at the bit 
to get to the “real” work. I’m sure you don’t need to think too hard to come 
up with some examples of projects that floundered because the planning was 
inadequate. Stand your ground and put enough time and craftsmanship into 
planning all your projects. Trust me, the execution will go a lot smoother if 
you do.

Old School Planning 
There’s a pitfall waiting to trap those of us who operate with a continu-
ous improvement mindset. We get so wrapped up in doing things faster and 
cheaper, all in a continual race to do things better, that we can lose track of 
some really fine tools and strategies. I was reminded of this a few years ago 
as I helped facilitate a planning session for the New Business Initiative (NBI) 
guys at Intel Corporation.
At the time I worked for an internal consulting group, so I worked with vari-
ous groups across the company. I often had to morph techniques to fit a 
specific customer’s requests. Working with the NBI folks is like jumping into 
the rollercoaster seat without seeing where the track is going. It’s gonna be 
a thrill-packed ride and it sure won’t be slow. In this particular case, we were 
scoping out a plan to develop a proof of concept to demonstrate feasibility 
and provide a basis for future funding. The requirements were a work in prog-
ress (WIP) but we needed to nail down a project plan and schedule quickly. 
Further, while the customer needed a detailed schedule, they could live with 
order-of-magnitude duration estimates. They also requested that we model 
different resource levels to see what their options were. So, here you have a 
situation where the triple constraint (Chapter 7) is made of spaghetti and you 
need to bring some structure to those wiggly, loose legs of the triangle.
When confronted with a highly ambiguous environment, a solid tactic is to 
start putting stakes in the ground and let the rest of the plan spin out from 
there. I’ll talk about this in more detail later in Chapter 6. It turns out that, in 
this type of environment, Intel had a great tool for planning that was consid-
ered archaic and inefficient but still works really well. That old-school tech-
nique is called a Make a Project Plan (MAPP) Day.
At Intel, the MAPP Day is a venerable old tradition that’s not used much 
anymore. During a MAPP Day (which can last several days, by the way), the 
team uses sticky notes to write down all of the project work packages. They 
capture dependencies, resource requirements, work estimates, duration, and 
so forth on these sticky notes. Then the team uses a blank wall covered in 
a large sheet of paper to construct the WBS and network diagram using the 
sticky notes. Notes are moved around and adjusted as the team progresses 
through the planning. This is a highly interactive process that involves the 
entire team. Of course I’ve simplified the process a bit here, but it’s sufficient 
to say that after a team completes a MAPP Day exercise they have a solid basis  
for a project plan and they’ve captured a draft schedule, risks, assumptions,  
opens, and so on. The big problem with a MAPP Day process is that it’s slow 
if you have a large team. It’s also highly dependent on all participants preparing 
their specific material ahead of time.
So, for this particular consult we went old school with sticky notes, flip charts, 
multicolored markers, and lots of tape. I don’t usually do this type of planning 

Chapter 5 | You Have to Do the Work 
70
anymore and, frankly, I’d forgotten how effective it could be. My PM colleagues 
were quick to mock me when I mentioned that I was setting up a sticky-note 
MAPP Day and every single one of them delivered earnest arguments against 
conducting a planning session that way. The arguments were consistent: it 
takes too long, it’s inefficient, and no one will be prepared. These are all valid 
arguments and I’ve made them a time or two myself. There was something, 
however, we were all forgetting about the old school MAPP Day technique 
—it works!
Let me be clear here—the old school approach works very well in certain 
situations, but it can be a disaster in others. If you have a relatively small 
team and highly variable or ambiguous requirements, and if time is of the 
essence, then you just can’t beat a sticky-note MAPP Day. If you have a large, 
geo-dispersed team with multiple requirements documents, then yes, there 
are more efficient ways to generate a complex schedule and bring the whole 
team into a common understanding of the project plan.
For this MAPP Day we spent an entire day reviewing the technical and  
business aspects of this project. We did a deep dive review of the use cases, 
the proposed SW architecture schemes, and kicked around project execution 
options. On the surface it looked like we didn’t get a lot accomplished, but by 
the end of the day we all had a very solid understanding of the scope of the 
POC and lots of flip charts of data. That’s not something you can do with a 
large team on a high-complexity project… trust me, just don’t go there!
The second day was devoted entirely to developing the network diagram 
and here’s where those sticky notes came in. There’s a flexibility to brain-
storming and collaborating when you write tasks on sticky notes that no 
amount of software can duplicate. When you move them around until they all 
work together, there comes a point when the entire team is collaborating and 
focused on a common goal. I’d forgotten how effective this technique is when 
planning a project and how good it is for building a solid team dynamic.
In the end, we didn’t walk out of the MAPP Day with that “detailed schedule,” 
but what we did walk away with was pretty cool nonetheless. We started as a 
collection of people assigned to work on a project and left as a cohesive team 
focused on a clear objective. There was still some work to be done to finalize 
the schedule and the overall project plan. In fact, the rest of the planning went 
pretty smoothly because we also left the MAPP Day event with a solid list of 
risks, assumptions, and opens. Sure, there were some things we missed and 
had to go back to. But overall I’d say it was a very successful planning session 
and I’m glad I got tagged to facilitate that MAPP Day, because it reminded me 
that sometimes those techniques you’ve discarded in the name of continuous 
improvement really can be the best tool for the job.
The next time you start a new project, please consider whether or not an 
old-school technique can do the job faster and with better team buy-in. Don’t 

Managing Projects in the Real World
71
assume that the tool du jour is the best way to proceed. Each project is  
different, as is each team, so consider all the tools in your personal toolbox 
and pick the best one for the job.
What’s in a Name?
There’s an interesting dilemma I run across from time to time when scoping 
a new project. The dilemma is at first glance a wimpy one and you wouldn’t 
be blamed for rolling your eyes. You see I sometimes struggle with what to 
call a new project. So what’s in a name, you ask? According to Shakespeare 
not much, as a rose is always a rose no matter what you call it. However, many 
cultures believe that a name has power and invoking that name marshals that 
power. Okay, yeah—that’s a bit too metaphysical for me, too. But I do believe 
that what you call a new project is important for several reasons.
First, and most importantly, the name of a project should clearly convey what 
the project is about, especially if it’s part of a larger program. We convey an 
enormous amount of information with the name of a project, and it should 
provide context for where the project fits into the overall business and pro-
gram underway. A good example of this is a program I briefly worked on at 
Intel. The IT program name was SAP Re-Platforming. Right away you under-
stand that the program has something to do with SAP and it’s about major 
changes in how we used that application. If you have a bit of understanding 
about what SAP does and the scope with which it’s used, then you understand 
right away that this was a significant program for Intel. You get all of that con-
text just by the name of the program. See what I mean?
Another reason I think the name of a project is important is that you want to 
be associated with something that sounds significant. It’s motivating to work 
on something that sounds important. For instance some of us worked on 
projects that support WiMAX development in some way or other. When 
you tell your friends and coworkers that you’re working on a WiMAX project 
,they “get it” and can relate what you do for a living to something tangible for 
them. I once mentioned that I was scoping a WiMAX project to my brother, 
and his teenage daughter said, “Oh, for hotspots like at Starbucks, right?” Yeah, 
something like that.
It’s also motivating to work on something that sounds cool. When I first joined 
Intel, I managed PCB development projects in the Embedded Communications 
Group (ECG). My first projects had boring names based on geography. Almost 
every day I’d log into the document repository to upload or retrieve data 
stored there and on the main screen would be a folder for a project named 
Devil’s Bar (okay, that may not be the exact name, as it’s been a few years now). 
I’d frequently bemoan the fact that I was stuck working on a project called 
Boring Mountain instead of working on Devil’s Bar. When I mentioned this over 

Chapter 5 | You Have to Do the Work 
72
coffee one morning, one of the guys pointed out that the original name for 
the gaming console we now know as Wii was Revolution. Now I ask you, who 
wouldn’t rather play a Revolution game instead of Wii-ing?
I’d like to give you some tips on selecting a good name for your project. 
First, pick something that conveys context and relevance. Second, pick 
something that’s reasonable to spell and pronounce. Can you say/spell 
“Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious” Finally, pick a name that conveys the image 
you want to reinforce. If the project is a fast-track one, then choose a name 
that implies that speed such as the Bullet Express (I might be reaching a bit 
here). Think Shock and Awe instead of Boring Mountain. Get it?
I hope I’ve convinced you to take a few minutes to select a good name for 
your next project. I doubt that you’d find this discussion in the popular PM 
literature, but I believe the project name does matter even if it’s only a subtle 
influence. Choose your project names wisely, my friends!
Scoping Projects
I’ve scoped quite a few projects in my time, and it occurs to me that this is 
not well defined in project management. To clarify, by scoping I mean doing 
an initial assessment of the amount of time, effort, resources, and budget a 
given project will require to execute. (Triple constraint anyone?) The thing 
with scoping a project is that it’s done prior to the project’s even becom-
ing a project. This is high-level concept and feasibility work, not full-blown 
initiation or planning. You typically don’t have solid requirements—heck, the 
customer frequently can only articulate a big-picture idea at this early stage. 
Further, you need to come up with high-level estimates for the project very 
quickly, so that your organization can make a value decision on whether or 
not to pursue the project.
So what have I learned about scoping projects? That good question deserves 
the following answers:
First, I’ve learned that you really do need a detailed 
• 
schedule to be able to estimate the project timeline and 
resources. To get to that schedule, you need a reasonably 
good WBS. To get that “reasonably good” WBS, you need 
solid requirements. Starting to see a pattern here? Yep, 
that’s right—there are no shortcuts, and the only thing 
you can do if your timeline is tight is to dedicate more 
of your time to the scoping activity. Plan the rest of your 
work accordingly.
The second thing I’ve come to realize is that the overall scop-
• 
ing results are only going to be as good as the schedule and 
requirements the scoping team develops. Split the work and 

Managing Projects in the Real World
73
have the technical lead focus on defining the requirements 
while you focus on the schedule. You will be using this sched-
ule to model a variety of what-if scenarios, so make sure it’s 
dynamic and as comprehensive as you can make it. I’m not 
kidding here! As a PM, this schedule is your secret weapon! 
Nail the detailed schedule and a lot of the negotiation of 
requirements and execution becomes much easier, because 
it’s backed up by data generated from your model.
The third major thing I’ve come to realize is that you have 
• 
to adjust your perspective. Most project managers start 
working on a project after the scoping is done and the 
requirements and timelines are reasonably well-defined. 
With scoping you’ll drive yourself crazy if you’re expect-
ing, or driving to, solid requirements and hard dates. The 
objective of scoping is to figure out feasibility and options, 
not necessarily to plan out the entire project. Relax and 
keep the big picture in mind. Trust me, you will enjoy the 
experience a lot more.

How to Develop 
a Robust 
Schedule 
Now that I’ve convinced you that a project plan is much more than a project 
schedule and that it’s a lot of hard work, let’s talk about just how you go about 
building a robust, dynamic schedule. This is the planning activity that becomes 
the core of your project plans so you really must invest the time to get it done 
and get it done right. Many PMs hate developing a schedule because it seems 
like a no-win proposition. No matter how much work you put into it, your 
sponsor’s gonna tell you to either (a) grow up and face reality or, more likely, 
(b) sharpen your pencils and do better. Well, before you can face “reality” or 
even sharpen anything, you’ve got to know what you have to work with. So, 
let’s start with just how you really go about developing a dynamic schedule. 
Oh, and for all you folks who think you’ve got this? I really encourage you to 
read the first section, especially if you think your problem with schedules lies 
with the tools used to develop them!
The Problem Isn’t MS Project…It’s You!
If there’s such a thing as pure evil in project management, then I’d bet most 
PMs would say it’s MS Project. If you were to ask ten project managers which 
software they dislike using the most, hands down the answer is going to be MS 
Project. This software inspires more fear and frustration than just about any 
other. In short, for project managers, MS Project is Evil Incarnate!

MS Project is not an easy piece of code to utilize. It’s complex and clunky. It 
looks like Excel and acts like Access…sort of. This is not software you can 
master on your own and the usual “pick-it-up-as-you-go-along” technique just 
won’t be enough here. There are quagmires of options that don’t really act 
as you’d expect them to. Can you type in your schedule tasks and add dates 
to each one? Absolutely! However if you do that, then you will “repent at lei-
sure,” as they say back home. The problem is that this part of setting up the 
schedule is deceptively easy—almost any novice user can do it. The pitfalls are 
things like task types, dynamically linking the tasks, proper use of milestones, 
resource leveling, and so on. 
Note
■
■
  If you have no clue what those things are, then you need to go sign up for some training 
immediately! 
Setting up a robust, dynamic schedule is not something you can do without 
real experience and training.
Okay, to be fair, the problem is not all due to those guys in Redmond. In fact, 
most of the angst is due to either a lack of training or what I call the GIGO 
theory: garbage-in results in garbage-out. How do I know this? Well, let’s just 
say that Project and I have had our bouts in the past and I usually lost. Did I 
mention that it’s Evil Incarnate?
When I first started using Project, I tried to figure it out as I went along. I’m 
not a patient person when it comes to software and reading the instructions 
is for sissies!  It definitely didn’t work out like I’d planned. I then took a basic 
Introduction to Project class and, frankly, all that did was make me even more 
dangerous with the software. You see, I thought I knew what I was doing and I 
was able to cobble together crude but workable schedules. Somewhere along 
the way, I’d stopped using Excel to schedule projects but I wasn’t yet effective 
with Project. At this point, I had enough training in the use of the software 
but I lacked a fundamental understanding of the practice of developing robust 
schedules. I was stuck in GIGO Land and didn’t even realize it.
To get to that fundamental understanding, I had to go back to the beginning and 
relearn what I thought I knew about schedule development. For instance, you 
really do need a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). Trying to figure out or 
brainstorm the project’s task as you type them into Project is the road to ruin 
and gnawed off pencil erasers. If you are struggling with this, then I recommend 
taking (or re-taking, as the case may be) a project management fundamentals 
class and focusing on the schedule development material. You can also check out 
the numerous books dealing with this topic and other resources as needed. You 
will never get better at Project until you get better at the actual work of sched-
ule development. So, in order for Project to work right, you have to develop the 
schedule right before you try to use the software.

Managing Projects in the Real World
77
It was only after I’d mastered the theory of schedule development that I 
started to realize the true value MS Project brings to the PM. You see, if you 
develop your schedule correctly, then getting Project to model it is much, much 
easier. Once you get to a robust and dynamic schedule correctly entered into 
Project, you unlock a veritable treasure trove of information. You can now see 
cause and effect for schedule push-outs, model various what-if scenarios to 
provide high-confidence data back to change control boards (CCBs), see the 
real critical path (it’s not what you think it is!), and answer that dreaded ques-
tion, “What would it take to pull this in a quarter?”. In short, you can actually 
use Project as it was designed to be used.
So, if you are really struggling to use Project, then I’d suggest taking some time to 
do some training or self-study. Mastering schedule development and MS Project 
really will make your life easier. Project won’t magically get easier to use but at 
least you will understand what it’s doing—and you may even know why! 
Now that’s out of the way, where do you start? Well, assuming you have some 
sort of requirements document that’s reasonably frozen, you start by generat-
ing a WBS.
Breaking Down the Work Breakdown 
Structure
PMI breaks down a systematic way to create a project schedule, and one of 
the early steps in the process is to create a WBS. To create a WBS, you basi-
cally start with the expected outputs of the project and then systematically 
break out each sub-deliverable and the related work tasks to create said deliv-
erable. This activity generates a list of all of the tasks that must be completed 
for the project, neatly bucketed into work packages that represent the tasks 
needed to complete each deliverable. Pretty straightforward, right?
In fact, it’s so straightforward that PMs often overlook the formality of gen-
erating a WBS. Instead, we frequently just brainstorm a list of tasks with our 
teams and call it good enough. There’s nothing wrong with this approach if you 
comprehend the corner you’re cutting here. Don’t kid yourself, though—you 
are adding risk to the project, because you can potentially miss some of the 
work that has to happen when you neglect to follow a systematic approach to 
identifying that final task list. I frequently won’t create a WBS for a small project 
(~4–6 weeks, 3–4 team members, and so on), because these projects are usu-
ally fast-track-get-it-done-now kind of efforts that favor speed over formality. 
I know that I’ll be babysitting this project pretty closely so I’m cool with cut-
ting the WBS corner here. Another situation where I’ll blow off creating the 
WBS is when the project is very similar to past projects the team has already 
tackled. For instance, in the past I’ve worked with teams who primarily develop 
a specialized type of software application. The work packages for each project 
are pretty much the same, with only the specifics of the coding and the work 

Chapter 6 | How to Develop a Robust Schedule 
78
estimates varying between projects. In these instances, I’ve already created a 
schedule template from a WBS developed in the past, so building the schedule 
is just a matter of tweaking the template to fit the specifics of the new project. 
This is the most efficient way to generate a schedule for like projects.
Now if I have a completely new project or team, I’m not going to cut corners 
by bypassing the creation of a WBS. The same is true if the project involves an 
engineering discipline or technology I’m not familiar with. In these situations 
I find that I get the best understanding of the work needed for a particular 
project by facilitating the WBS generation session. If you use a systematic 
approach coupled with basic brainstorming techniques, the entire team will 
be engaged and the output will be a solid, comprehensive task list. Often PMs 
will tell me that they are struggling because they don’t thoroughly understand 
the work going on in each functional area. When this happens I can’t help but 
think that they didn’t go through the work of generating a true WBS.
In the end, there’s no wrong way to go about this as long as you are making 
some conscious decisions about which tools and techniques you will use to 
manage your project. Sometimes it makes sense to cut out the formal WBS 
creation and sometimes it doesn’t. To help you figure it out, here are a few of 
Melanie’s tricks of the trade to help you out when it comes to WBSs:
Creating the WBS isn’t that different from holding a brain-
• 
storming session to identify the tasks; it’s just a more 
structured way to get to that final task list. Try it—you’ll 
probably like it.
If you don’t generate a formal WBS but use MS Project to 
• 
track the schedule, then you might be able to extract the 
WBS from the Project file. This comes in handy for those 
pesky PM process quality audits! 
Note
■
■
  This functionality is highly dependent on which version of Project you are using, so you 
might not be able to pull this rabbit outta the hat.
If I’m going to the trouble to do the WBS followed up 
• 
by generating a network diagram, then I prefer to write 
out the tasks on Post-It notes so that the team can move 
them around during the brainstorming.
If you are not planning to create a WBS, then save your 
• 
sanity and do not type your tasks directly into Project! 
Freestyle task list generation in Project is the best way to 
ensure that you do not have a working schedule! Trust 
me, I’ve been there too many times to count. It’s much 
easier to develop a task list and collect work estimates 
with Excel and then transfer the data into Project. 

Managing Projects in the Real World
79
You might not need a WBS if this is a similar project to 
• 
one you’ve done before and you have a schedule tem-
plate to use, or if it’s very short and you already plan to 
micromanage the heck out of it.
You 
• 
do need a WBS if you are new to the team, technology,  
engineering discipline, and so forth.
Use the WBS generation meeting as a way to build and/or 
• 
reinforce your team dynamic, as this is often one of the 
first times the entire team gets together to work on the 
project.
Okay, that’s my take on the always-scintillating topic of WBSs. Sure, it’s not 
rocket science or anything that complex, but I do think it pays to spend some 
time thinking about these things and understanding when it makes sense to 
follow PMI’s best practices and when it makes sense to cut some corners. I 
hope you found this interesting and maybe even got a few ideas to use the 
next time you need to build a schedule.
Networking … and Not the Fun Kind
Now that you’ve got your tasks broken down, you need to take that infor-
mation and create a network diagram. Basically a network diagram is a visual 
representation of the project’s workflow. Which task goes first? What 
task is dependent on the material arriving in-house? Can you create the 
Marketing collateral while the Quality Assurance guys are doing their thing? 
Following me?
Pretty much everything I’ve said about the WBS applies to the network dia-
gram—they are best buds, salt and pepper, Liz Taylor and white diamonds, 
Willie Nelson and Trigger. (Yes, Willie really did name his guitar that! I couldn’t 
make that up if I tried. ), coffee and cream, french fries and ketchup…you get 
the picture. Bottom line? If you’re going to the trouble of creating a WBS then 
you gotta grind out the network diagram. If you are cutting the WBS corner, 
then same goes for the network diagram.
Okay, when I say that you’ve “gotta grind out the network diagram,” I’m really 
making it sound harder than it is. The easiest way I know to create one is 
to use sticky notes. Write each task on a separate sticky note, then using a 
nice smooth wall covered in blank paper, start laying out the workflow. Keep 
moving the notes around, adding more as necessary, until your diagram…your 
network diagram, get it?…makes sense. Do this as a team if possible. At Intel 
this work is done during a MAPP Day, as described in Chapter 5. Once you 
think you’ve got it nailed, have each person “walk” the flow and tweak the 
diagram as needed. Once it’s good, annotate those sticky notes with a number 

Chapter 6 | How to Develop a Robust Schedule 
80
and make sure that you’ve captured the predecessor and successor for each 
one on the note. Take a nice digital picture with your phone and then tape 
down the diagram. Pull off the paper, roll it up, and you’ve got a hardcopy of 
your network diagram. How easy is that?
By the way, have you noticed that we’ve done all of this work without MS 
Project getting fired up once? There’s a reason for that—so step away from 
that laptop, mister!
Estimation: It’s Trickier Than You Thought
Now that you’ve got your WBS and before the network diagram, you can 
start estimating the work. I’m not going to regale you with a blow-by-blow 
account of all of the fabulous estimation techniques out there. Trust me, there 
are tons of resources on that kind of thing and you won’t have much trouble 
understanding the techniques. I mean, you did pass basic math back in high 
school right? Despite all the fancy-pants terminology, estimation processes 
are pretty straightforward and don’t use a lot of painful math. The pitfall for 
PMs isn’t the techniques or the math. It’s something else entirely.
Thinking about the estimation process led me to thinking about just how 
critical the main estimation meeting can be. I think this is one of the choke 
points a PM must navigate very carefully. The estimating is done early in the 
project so the team dynamic is probably somewhere in the storming phase. 
The primary estimation meeting happens after the team has had a chance to 
review and think about the work content. Each member has a solid idea of 
how long it will take to complete his or her portion of the work…and each 
probably has a good idea of how long he or she thinks it should take everyone 
else to complete their work. Throw in a sense of unease about committing to 
work and a timeline you can’t hit and you have a volatile situation. If the PM 
doesn’t step up and lead here, the team will devolve into a disjointed group of 
individuals each completing his or her assigned work with little commitment 
to the overall deliverable.
So what do I mean by “step up and lead”? First as the PM, you have to do some 
legwork before the meeting. Each team member needs to complete his or 
her part of the estimation process prior to the meeting. If you find that some 
folks haven’t done the pre-work, then reschedule the meeting and remove any 
roadblocks. Second, it’s critical to explicitly spell out the expectations for this 
meeting. Yes, you really do need a slide that addresses confidentiality, respect 
for everyone’s opinions, full participation, and so on. Now the fun really begins! 
As you move into the discussion of estimates for specific tasks or work pack-
ages, the PM must actively facilitate the discussion. Everyone needs to partici-
pate and all opinions need to be heard and considered. Inevitably there will 
be some disagreements where strong opinions are held. When this happens,  

Managing Projects in the Real World
81
I have the team drill down into all of the assumptions that were made for that 
particular estimate. The discussion that follows may still be heated, but at 
the end everyone is on the same page about the work content. Other team 
members may have strong opinions but ultimately I defer to the estimate of 
the person who will actually have to do the work. It’s important to understand 
that how you orchestrate these difficult discussions will be a huge factor in 
your ability to motivate and influence the team going forward. Do not alienate 
someone by forcing an estimate they are uncomfortable committing to.
Finally, I can’t emphasize enough how important it is get the estimate right. At 
this point in the planning process, how long it takes to do the work is irrel-
evant to the customer’s expected completion date. Drive an open discussion 
by making it clear that the goal is to understand what it takes to do the work 
and that schedule optimization will come later. People are often surprised in 
estimation meetings I run because I don’t put a lot of energy into hassling peo-
ple about their estimates. Frankly, at this point I don’t care what your estimate 
is as long as you can commit to completing the work in that amount of time. 
I’m a strong believer that the first step in schedule optimization is to truly 
understand what it takes to do the job. Too often in the past I was caught flat-
footed late in a project because the estimates were gamed to fit the expected 
customer commit. My primary goal at estimation is to understand my baseline 
so that I have a solid basis for optimization later. My secondary goal is to 
establish a solid team dynamic that is collaborative and not combative.
The Easy Way
Building a schedule can often be the hardest part of the mechanics of project 
management. Frequently, there’s an expectation for the project duration that’s 
based on a lot of speculation and previous experience. Some of the work will 
just be difficult to estimate, and let’s not forget about the funfest that is MS 
Project. Still, a strong, dynamic schedule can be your best ally as you navigate 
the lifespan of the project. There’s a lot out there about how to develop a 
schedule and for the most part, it’s all very good. The problem is that all those 
best practices for generating strong schedules take time…lots of it! I don’t 
know about you, but many times I don’t have that kind of time. I need a sched-
ule good enough to commit deliverables from in a week. Heck, sometimes 
it’s a matter of days! That’s just the way this project management gig happens 
sometimes. The real trick isn’t meeting that target date but infusing the final 
committed date with enough reality to make the target reasonable. So how 
do you go about building a schedule that supports this reality? Oh and how do 
you do it fast??? In short, how do you do this in the real world?
To be honest, you’d want to do a full planning session before opening Project. 
The truth is that I’ve found that most PMs for small projects or less formal 
teams tend to jump right into Project after nailing the comprehensive task list

and the work estimates. Sure, it’s not the best way to go, but it can work for 
you if you pay attention to the details and develop a dynamic schedule.
As with my take on risk management, this process isn’t pretty and it’s not a 
strict implementation of the PMBoK, but it will get the job done if you mind 
your p’s and q’s, as follows:
1.	 Type or copy and paste the task list into Project. Do not 
enter any dates at this point!
2.	 Add a milestone task at the very top of your project 
called Project Start. Add a similar one at the end called 
Project Complete. Again, do not enter any dates in the 
Start or Finish fields.
3.	 For every task on the list, populate the predecessor field 
and your work estimates to the Work field in Project. I’m 
sorry to be a nag, but again: do not enter any dates at 
this point!
Tip

  It helps a lot to just hide the Start and Finish columns at this point . . . trust me, it saves a lot 
of time and helps everyone focus on the logic of the schedule versus the dates.
4.	 Add resources to each task, but be very careful here. In 
the previous scenarios I talk about above, it’s unlikely that 
you are going to be tracking actual hours, and that’s okay. 
The rub is that you are still going to need to look at how 
the work is distributed across the resources and make 
sure it’s reasonable. This is called resource leveling and 
it’s hard, nasty work. If you’re unfamiliar with doing this, 
then I’d suggest checking out the many project resources 
available on this topic.
5.	 Add meaningful milestones by inserting a line item for each 
one. You can add as many as you want just don’t forget 
to populate the predecessor field. Be sure to include any 
critical deliverables your team is expecting from another 
team, be it hardware, software, testing, or Twinkies. Again: 
do not enter any dates at this point!
6.	 Toggle the view in Project so that you can see the 
Relationship Diagram. This is a block diagram of how 
each task connects to the others in the schedule. Now 
step through each line item making sure that there are 
predecessors and successors for each task. It’s worth 

Managing Projects in the Real World
83
noting that some milestones will not have both, but every 
line item in your schedule will have at least one. Lather, 
rinse, repeat until you have a schedule that’s linked from 
Project Start to Project Close.
7.	 At this point, you still haven’t entered in any dates! 
Now’s the time to double-check your work. Toggle the 
view in Project to view the Critical Path. Does it make 
sense? Are there enough tasks on the list?
Tip
■
■
  If the answer is no, then you don’t have all of your tasks linked dynamically through the 
predecessor/successor logic. Go back and repeat Step 6.
8.	 Okay, take a big breath and get ready to enter actual 
dates. Melanie’s rule of thumb is this: hard-coded dates 
are bad, dates Project generates on its own are good. If 
you see a small square icon on in the Indicator column 
of any task, then you know you’ve got a hard-coded date 
for that task. Now go ahead and enter the Start date for 
your milestone, Project Start. Enter hard-coded dates for 
any milestones that represent deliverables to your team 
(this is your committed date to receive the deliverable). 
Hit Enter and watch the magic happen. 
9.	 At this point your schedule should be 80% complete. You 
will need to clean it up a bit by tweaking some of the  
predecessor/successor logic and eliminating as many 
hard-coded dates as possible. 
10.	 Gut check time. Ask the team members if the timeline 
makes sense. Break it into logical chunks such as, “Does it 
seem like this project should take six weeks for testing?”. 
Refine your schedule as necessary.
11.	 Once you’re satisfied with the schedule, baseline it. These 
are the dates you can commit to your customers.

  I find it helpful to add the Baseline Start and Baseline Finish columns so that I can see at a 
glance how far the project is drifting from the committed baseline dates.

Chapter 6 | How to Develop a Robust Schedule 
84
As I said, this isn’t the best practices poster child for schedule development. 
It’s my method for getting the work done as quickly as possible. It involves 
a lot of PM time—hours of it—so plan accordingly. In the end, you will use 
that schedule every week of the project and, if it’s not complete or other-
wise jacked up, your life will be a misery until the darn thing is over. Spend as 
much time up front as you can and get it right the first time. I hope this has 
helped you think about how you develop schedules and gives you a repeatable 
process.
Optimizing the Schedule
Okay, now that you have your “best case” schedule developed, let’s cover 
how to optimize it. If you’ve followed my previous advice about how to build 
a schedule, you will end up with the most likely scenario assuming that noth-
ing goes catastrophically wrong. Unfortunately, unless you just get lucky, that 
final project release date won’t be good enough and you’re going to need to 
optimize. Yep, it’s time to “pull in the schedule.” Cue the Jaws music!
Now any PM with a whip and a chair can perform a pull-in…at least on paper 
or in MS Project. However, it takes a bit more skill to actually optimize your 
schedule. To optimize a schedule, I go back to the venerable triple constraint: 
schedule, scope, and resources. Think of these as the legs of an equilateral 
triangle; affect any one leg of that triangle and you will cause a corresponding 
change in at least one other leg. With a schedule pull-in, you are essentially 
shrinking that schedule leg and holding it fixed. What this means is that you 
can’t change one of the three without affecting the others. There’s no such 
thing as a free lunch, remember? Okay, if you want to pull in your schedule, 
then you really only have two knobs to turn: scope and resources.
By far the easiest way to pull in a schedule is to reduce the scope of 
work, so you should start here when you are attempting to pull in a schedule. 
Go through the requirements document with your team to identify likely 
features or functionality you can either cut or push to a later release. Also, 
carefully review the test plan to see if you can reduce scope there. After 
you have identified some candidates for the ol’ scope-chopping block, run 
them by your stakeholders to see if you can come up with a compromise on 
the reduced scope of work. Often, breaking the deliverables up and releasing 
them in phases is a workable solution.
Caution
■
■
  Be very careful that you do not alienate your stakeholders when challenging the 
necessity of functions or features. It’s very easy to give aggressive stakeholders the impression that 
your team is trying to weasel out of work at this stage, so make extra efforts to keep the discussion 
collaborative.

Managing Projects in the Real World
85
If you can’t cut scope or release in phases, then the next thing you want 
to look at is how the work is synchronized. First, start by examining 
the critical path—or critical chain if you’re following the theory of constraints 
(TOC). These tasks are the ones you need to address if you want to pull in 
your overall finish date. Don’t waste your time trying to pull in any task not on 
the path, as it won’t affect your end date. Here’s where the optimization comes 
in. Scrutinize the critical path to determine if any of the work can be done in 
parallel. In my experience, there are usually some opportunities here and, if 
you want to get really crazy, you can consider employing Agile development 
concepts. One of the advantages of using the Agile methodology for your 
execution phase is that you can pull your testing work up in parallel with your 
development work…sort of.
Okay, let’s say that you can’t reduce or phase out the scope and you can’t 
do any more work in parallel—what do you do next? It’s time to make like 
a teenager with her momma’s BMW and crash the schedule! In case you 
haven’t been brainwashed by PMI yet, crashing the schedule is the term used 
when you add more resources to the project. So, go through your critical 
path tasks and determine if adding more bodies would help those specific 
tasks. Be aware of the fact that not every task benefits from more hands, but 
chances are you will have some opportunities for crashing the schedule. The 
end result of your crashing experiment is that you should have a list of specific 
tasks with associated start/finish dates and the necessary skill set needed. This 
is your ask list and, because it’s really specific, your chances of actually getting 
extra resources increases dramatically. A resource owner is much more likely 
to cough up that extra head if he knows it’s for a set period of time with a 
very specific task or deliverable rather than an ambiguous request for help.
There’s one more tactic to try when you are optimizing your schedule and—
fair warning—it’s not a popular one. For a time, PMI defined a fourth com-
ponent to the triple constraint: quality. (How a triple entity could have a 
fourth component has never made sense to me but, hey, I’m not PMI am I?) 
It’s commonplace to define the quality metrics/requirements that need to be 
met for your project’s output. One way to pull in your schedule is to relax 
the quality requirements, which in turn reduces the overall scope of work. 
The thing is, though, this is a really tough row to hoe and, while it should be 
considered as a matter of due diligence, it’s rare that all stakeholders agree to 
a lesser quality level for a product. It does happen, and of course it carries its 
own risks, so you and your team should consider reduced quality as part of 
your analysis to pull in the schedule.
Once you’ve ground through the tactics discussed above, you should have 
several what-if optimization scenarios defined with associated risks, impacts 
to the end date, and resources needed to execute them. These are the basis 
for any negotiation with your customers and key stakeholders on pulling in 
the schedule. In my experience, this data goes a long way to convincing your 

Chapter 6 | How to Develop a Robust Schedule 
86
stakeholders that your team can or cannot pull in a schedule. At some point 
the work “is what it is” and there’s not much more you can do, especially 
if you want to keep the scope of work fixed while reducing the schedule. 
Remember that equilateral triangle? As I never tire of repeating, there’s no 
such thing as a free lunch!
So there it is. To optimize a schedule, try to reduce the scope of work, look 
at how the work is synchronized, crash the schedule, and/or consider relaxing 
the quality requirements. Do these things, and you will have enough pull-in 
options to make a solid business decision.
The Proper Care and Feeding of Your Baseline
There was a time when I thought a baseline was pretty useless, if I even gave 
the concept any thought at all. I was young then and often too busy trying to 
stay on top of the actual project work to worry much about my schedule. 
Sure, I understood the concept of a baseline but, frankly, that understand-
ing was rooted in design of experiments and measuring tangible things like 
current or voltage. It had little to do with scheduling. If I gave a baseline any 
thought at all, it was because I had to capture it on a PowerPoint slide some-
where, and even then it masqueraded under the title, “Plan Dates.” Truly, it 
didn’t play much of a role in my project management.
Fast-forward to today’s projects and I’m all about the baselines. In fact, I view 
my current schedule baseline as so important that it’s got a permanent home 
on my custom/default MS Project view. Nowadays instead of referring to these 
dates as “Plan Dates,” they go by the name “Customer Commits”! To cut to 
the chase here, I baseline my schedule when I’m ready to give the customer 
commit for the project deliverables. Performing the “baseline” action in MS 
Project saves a baseline start and finish date for every line item on the schedule.  
Therefore, by comparing the Baseline Start date of a task with the Start date 
at some point in the future, I can tell immediately if that task is in alignment 
with the committed customer dates. I can’t imagine managing a project with-
out having a baseline front and center all the time.
Another point I should make is that your project baseline will evolve as the 
project progresses through its lifecycle. Your first baseline is still the basis for 
all measurements of performance against schedule and you should never dis-
card it. However, the reality of project management is that things change and 
your customer commits will change as a result. Anytime my team approves a 
change request of measureable schedule impact, I add that work to the proj-
ect schedule and re-baseline. This new baseline becomes the new and current 
customer commit. Lather, rinse, repeat. It’s not unusual to re-baseline your 
schedule a couple of times during a project, so be sure you keep track of what 
each baseline represents.

  I do this by adding notes to my Project Start task.
Okay, so re-baselining is a perfectly legit activity most of the time—but it’s also 
one of the most misused schedule maintenance practices around. If your proj-
ect’s schedule is rolled up to a dashboard, then chances are any variance from 
the originally committed dates is noted. I’ve observed PMs re-baseline willy-
nilly to “fix” this variance. Bad PM! Bad! If the circumstances have changed and 
you’ve legitimately re-committed the project deliverables then re-baselining 
is the proper activity. However, if your team is slipping the schedule then 
re-baselining is simply sweet frosting over a rotten cake. I’ve also seen re-
baselining used to “fix” a bad schedule performance index/cost performance index 
(SPI/CPI) metric as well . . . Bad PM! ’Nuff said, right?
Here’s the thing: re-baselining to make things appear better in MS Project 
when in fact the train is jumpin’ the tracks is wrong. It’s the MS Project equiva-
lent of lyin’ through your teeth, and you know it as well as I do. I once worked 
in an organization where it was common practice to re-baseline the Plan 
Dates whenever the project team was behind. Sadly, the senior management 
sitting in those Ops Reviews never noticed this tactic but they did have low 
confidence in the PMs because those projects were always late. And those 
PMs? Well, they defended their re-baselining practice as the only way they 
could avoid getting raked over the coals whenever their projects were behind 
schedule. What a dysfunctional group all the way around!
There you have it—the proper care and feeding of your schedule baselines. 
If you haven’t really used them, then now’s the time to start! Baseline your 
current schedules today and then start paying attention to those tasks that 
start varying from your baseline start and/or finish dates. It’s easy to do and 
the information you get is immediately actionable. I hope I’ve convinced you 
to pay attention to your baselines and steer clear of re-baselining to fix a slip-
ping schedule.
The Dark Art of Leveling Resources
Just to get started, raise your hand if you level the resources on all of your  
projects? In MS Project? Using the Level All button? Okay, for those of you with 
your hands still up, I have just one thing to say—“Much respect!” Seriously, 
I bow down to your superior skills! For me at least, resource leveling has 
always seemed like the Dark Art of Project Management. I’m not sure if it’s a 
failure to fully understand what Project is doing—that creepy feeling you get 
when something “auto-calculates” for a really long time as you watch your 
dates bounce around—or the inevitable bad news that results from leveling 
resources, but for many PMs it’s just plain scary. Think of this as a root canal 
for PMs. (Yeah, it really is that bad! I’m not kidding here! Seriously!)

Chapter 6 | How to Develop a Robust Schedule 
88
Now after that ominous buildup, I know what you’re thinking: “Why would 
I invite that much pain? Why should I even bother with the auto-leveling 
capability in Project?” The short answer is that, by leveling your resources, 
you’re identifying risks and potential problems before they become Excedrin 
Headaches. Even if you only have five people on your project, there’s just 
no good way to pinpoint specific weeks in which resource utilization breaks 
above 100% in Excel, especially when you try to factor in holidays, individual 
vacations, sabbaticals, and so on. It’s a complex world out there, and you really 
need some help from a tool to get a quick snapshot of the individual work-
loads for the resources on your project. Oh, and as long as you’ve built a care-
ful schedule, the leveling process goes pretty quickly.
So how do you level your resource? Well, first you need to do a good job of 
developing the schedule. Follow the step-by-step process outlined above. At 
Step 9, you level them. To level your resources, go to the Resource tab:
Here you have two options: Level Resource will allow you to level an indi-
vidual resource and Level All will do all of your resources at once. Click Level 
Now and off MS Project goes, tweaking your task dates willy-nilly. Okay, it’s 
not quite that bad, but it really is a one-step process if you decide to level all 
resources at the same time.
Sounds pretty straightforward, doesn’t it? Well, for the most part that’s because 
it is! Now for a couple of tips and tricks to help you over the bumps. First, 
before I do any leveling I toggle to the Resource Usage view and check out all 
those resources in red. As I scroll the right-side window, I can see how much 
any given resource is over-allocated in any given week. If the over-allocation is 
minimal (say <20%) then I don’t bother leveling that one, because I’m assum-
ing that the margin of error in my work estimates will take care of the over-
allocation over time. Also, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to expect a resource 
to put in a little overtime once in a while. This is a quick way to gauge how 
much resource leveling you need to do. If I have primarily one resource that’s 
over-allocated, then I prefer to level the schedule one resource at a time. If 
most of the resources are over-allocated, then I level all of them at the same 
time. Last, it’s absolutely vital that you level the resources before you add any 
actual hours. For some reason trying to level a resource on a task with actual 
hours assigned freaks Project out. (Okay, that’s my interpretation of what hap-
pens and a Project expert can probably tell you what’s really going on—but 
not me. )

Managing Projects in the Real World
89
So, the resources are leveled and the project milestone dates align with the 
customer’s expectation. What’s the point and was it worth the extra “drama” 
of leveling the resources? The point is that you now have a well-developed 
schedule that does not assume that any of your resources are working insane 
hours. You have a crystal clear idea of how much work is planned per resource 
per week. When you’re looking at ways to pull in a schedule, this is a great 
tool to help you see where you can backend-load work into weeks when 
there’s not 100% utilization. Further, if you’ve got to over-allocate resources 
to pull in a schedule, then you can clearly state that you need someone to 
put in OT in specific weeks. This can be very helpful in motivating someone 
to work more hours, because you can make it clear that it’s a finite effort, not 
something that will become the status quo.
So there you go—a little light on the Dark Art of Project Management! I hope 
this has been helpful and at least convinced you to give automated resource 
leveling another look.
Buffer? What Buffer? Surely You Jest!
Now I thought I’d talk about what is essentially a taboo PM topic: buffering the 
schedule. As experienced PMs, we know that we should utilize buffers in our 
schedules to undercommit and overdeliver right? It’s just good risk manage-
ment to have buffers, isn’t it? Okay, I want to try something here, so please 
bear with me. Raise your hands if you have buffers built into your schedules. 
Okay, now lower your hands if you’ve got those buffers hidden, obscured, or 
otherwise buried in the schedule. If you are utilizing TOC you get to put your 
hands down now too. Who’s left holding up their hands? Bueller? Bueller? 
Bueller? Yeah, that’s what I thought…none of us.
Here’s the thing: we know we need ’em, but it’s pretty much “frowned upon” 
to explicitly utilize a buffer. The primary exception to this is those of you 
using TOC, which embraces the buffering economy. I’m betting that most of 
you, like me, have worked in organizations where every program and project 
must be pulled in. You know what I’m talking about here. You show up at the 
planning session with a high-confidence schedule only to get it picked apart, 
knocked around, and otherwise violated—all in some frantic attempt to pull 
in the dates to meet an arbitrary deadline. Somewhere in this process the 
real magnitude of the work packages gets lost and risks are introduced into 
the plan. This is the real world you work in, and that’s how a lot of program/
project plans fall out. So what do you do? You bake in some buffer as risk 
contingency so that your team has a hope of delivering on time. (Ever notice 
that we do this with budgets too?) The really ridiculous thing about this is that 
each project that supports a larger program is going to do this and so is the 
program manager. Sounds a lot like tolerance-stacking doesn’t it?

Chapter 6 | How to Develop a Robust Schedule 
90
Over time this attitude becomes so ingrained in our PM psyche that we don’t 
even notice it. This is just crazy! One time I was wrapping up a huge program  
that lasted 22 months and, as I was pulling together some data for the  
retrospective, I discovered that we had come in only 4% over our planned 
work (the actual man hours). That’s phenomenal performance and yes, my 
team rocks, but that data point did spark a good question. One of the new 
guys asked how we did it—not so subtly implying that I’d padded the heck out 
of the underlying project schedules. No padding was employed and we did do 
a fantastic job executing the plan. But the truth of the matter is that I should 
have been using explicit buffers. At that time I worked in a team where I was 
allowed to do the job the right way to get results. My boss didn’t care if I buff-
ered a schedule as long as I did it the correct way for the right reasons. (For 
some reason, he didn’t buy my argument that we should have a buffer for the 
month of July so that we can go hang at the lake though…go figure!)
Now here comes the weird part. I had to ping a fellow PM to figure out how 
to explicitly use buffers in Project. I’m not sure I’ve done it in recent memory. 
She didn’t know how to do it either, and trust me she can make Project do 
some pretty impressive tricks! We’d both become so accustomed to hiding 
buffers we had to scratch our heads to figure out how to do it openly. Even 
weirder was the fact that I’ve been managing projects for this team for over 
two years now and I was still hiding those buffers for no good reason! It had 
become so deeply embedded in my thought processes that I just assumed that 
I couldn’t use an explicit buffer. D’oh!
I used to believe that the use of explicit schedule buffers was a non-starter. 
Ironically, if you want to be successful project after project, then you need to 
use schedule buffers, so you hide them. You probably work in organizations 
that are expecting you to hide them—hence the ridiculous scrutiny of your 
project schedules during those planning sessions. I think it’s time we all got 
off this particular crazy train. The next time you use buffers, do it openly and 
tie them to the risks you’re really worried about. Do I think this will change 
the way your organization works? Not really—but who knows, you just might 
educate someone and convince them to get off the train, too, and isn’t that 
worth the effort? Good luck out there!

How to Say No 
to Unrealistic 
Target Dates
It’s a fact of life that PMs will be given unrealistic target dates for their proj-
ects. Sometimes these crazy dates are driven by real-world constraints such 
as market windows or large corporate initiatives, but they are just as often 
based on wild speculation—a management team with a Magic 8 Ball and a 
handful of optimistic dates. This is your reality and to be successful you need 
a slew of tricks up your sleeve to inject some reality into those pipe dreams. 
Let me share some of my tricks of the trade.
Triple Constraint Junkie
First, let’s go back to basics and talk about one of the most powerful con-
structs in project management, the triple constraint. If you pick up a recent 
edition of the PMBoK, then you won’t find this idea at all! Instead you find a 
laundry list of factors that affect the overall project. Sure, each of these factors 
is important but, to be honest, this long list of items obscures the constraining 
elements of any project: the scope of work, the schedule, and the resources. 
Yep, you guessed it! I’m an old-school PM and a triple constraint junkie!
Okay, for those of you who have no clue what I’m talking about, let me break 
down the triple constraint concept for you. Basically, the idea is that any proj-
ect is bounded by three equally important and interrelated factors. First is the 
7
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 7 | How to Say No to Unrealistic Target Dates
92
scope of work the project is tasked with completing. Second is the commit-
ted schedule and its associated milestones. Third come the resources that are 
assigned to the project. Everything else can be associated back to these three 
factors. This concept is typically represented by an equilateral triangle where 
each leg represents the scope, the schedule, and the resources. The integrity 
of the triangle must be maintained—so once you baseline your plan, think of 
these legs as fixed. If at some point you want to pull in the schedule—that is, 
shorten that leg of the triangle—then you must either cut the scope of work 
or extend the amount of resources available. Likewise, if you need to increase 
the scope of the project, then you have to either extend the schedule leg or 
the resources leg. See how this works?
As I mentioned, PMI has pretty much done away with the triple constraint, and 
I’m honestly not sure why they did this because it’s such a useful construct. 
I guess part of the reason is that we humans have a really hard time leaving 
good enough alone…there’s always a way to make something better. PMI first 
improved the idea to emphasize the important role quality played in projects 
by encircling the triple constraint triangle with a quality circle. The idea here 
was the quality constraint spanned all aspects of a project. Yep, I get that and 
am totally on board, only…isn’t quality intrinsically related to the scope of 
work? As time went by, more and more “important” factors were emphasized 
and the good ol’ triangle graphic inevitably gave way to a laundry list. Well, 
that’s progress, I guess.
I’m not sure that’s progress at all, because I use that triangle construct to 
develop, explain, and negotiate every project plan I create. This is why I’m 
a triple constraint junkie! I can easily sketch the idea out on a whiteboard 
to help explain just why my team can’t deliver five new features with a fixed 
schedule and no additional resources to the extreme driver who calls herself 
the engineering manager. I’ve used the graphic to help focus teams on brain-
storming ideas for how we will execute the project. Whenever I’m working on 
optimizing a schedule, I start with the scope of work and available resources. 
See how this simple triangle construct helps focus my thinking?
When I was just starting out as a PM, I didn’t understand the triple constraint 
idea and, looking back, I can see that my efforts were more along the lines of 
coordinating the work than actually managing the project. It was only when 
I started studying for the Project Management Professional (PMP) exam that 
I actually encountered the triple constraint. For me as a PM, it was a pivotal 
moment—so yeah, I’m totally a triple constraint junkie and darn proud of 
it! How ’bout you? (Geez, I really think I need to get a T-shirt with “Triple 
Constraint Junkie” emblazoned across the chest, don’t you?)

Managing Projects in the Real World
93
Hard Dates = Negotiable Targets
Okay, now we’re getting to the good stuff! What do you do when a project 
deliverable date is dictated to you? First let me say that this is the reality of 
project management: a place where theory and the real world collide on an 
epic scale. I have very little input into the target date that’s dictated to the 
project team, unless I’m the PM doing the scoping work prior to a program or 
project kicking off. This is my reality and I’m pretty sure it’s the reality most 
PMs live with. To be fair, often these dates are based on market windows, 
and if you miss the window then you might as well pack up your toys and go 
home. Unfortunately, there are also those times when these dates are set by 
upper management based on their own personal assessments of how long 
the project should take. Hey, these folks were once engineers and they know 
how long it takes to do this work…back in the day, within the business envi-
ronment that bears little resemblance to what project teams endure today. 
It really doesn’t matter why a project end date gets dictated to the project 
team; it’s enough to realize that it’s going to happen regularly. To be success-
ful in this environment, it makes sense to figure out how to manage that hard 
deliverable date.
To be successful in this environment, I think the key is to do solid planning. The 
depth and thoroughness of the planning separates the project coordinators 
from the project managers. What do I mean by this? Well, for me the main 
output of planning is a project plan that includes a strong, dynamic schedule 
and a risk register. With the work done to develop the plan and the schedule, 
I can model all kinds of what-if scenarios. I can pull together scenarios for my 
customers that offer realistic options for meeting the actual goal of the pro-
gram and not necessarily the originally dictated deliverable. I consider things 
like parallel development paths, phased development to cut in scope as it’s 
realistic to achieve, crashing the schedule with specific resources, and so forth. 
It’s true that some of these scenarios never make it to the final set of options, 
but what I’ve found is that going through this what-if exercise can often spur 
ideas your team would not have otherwise come up with. For instance, when I 
was working on a particular Intel program, the board development team came 
up with the radical recommendation to drop the development of the planned 
second validation board. This idea would never have surfaced if we hadn’t 
been running what-if scenarios to figure out how to develop the second board 
within very challenging triple constraints. You see, there just wasn’t enough 
budget or resources to fulfill this mandated deliverable. Our solid planning 
allowed us to generate a very workable option that fulfilled the program’s 
overall objectives but not in the mandated way. Make no mistake, this is hard 
work, and I think it’s where the PM really needs to be on her “A” game.
In the past, I’d view these dictated dates as locked in stone and I had this 
attitude of “we just have to do whatever it takes.” In some ways, having the 
end date mandated was a “get-out-of-jail-free” card for me. I knew that if the 

Chapter 7 | How to Say No to Unrealistic Target Dates
94
project was not successful, it wasn’t because I’d done a bad job but because the 
end date wasn’t realistic in the first place. However, this line of logic doesn’t 
take into account the fact that the company is paying all of us to develop prod-
uct and make money. We have a responsibility to challenge those unrealistic 
mandates and provide realistic options to meet the end goals, such as time to 
market or product features. Can you say constructive confrontation?
Let me be very clear here: I think giving the impression to your customer and/
or management that you are committing to a date, when you know you can’t 
hit it, is unprofessional and dishonest. I don’t do that anymore. Sure, I did it 
earlier in my PM career—and every single time the project failed or was such 
a fire drill that everyone was toasted by the time it was over. What I learned 
from all those hard knocks is that thinking that “we’ll just do whatever it 
takes" or that “it's just got to happen” doesn't work. Resources don’t magically 
fall from the sky, no one’s willing to sleep on a cot in the lab, requirements 
don’t just drop off the scope of work, and even if—through some minor 
miracle—you pull it off, there’s no way you're gonna get a hat trick…it's just 
not repeatable or sustainable. Further, no one really gets fired for pushing 
back with credible data.
In summary, as a PM, you’re going to get “hard” dates and requirements handed 
to you. In order to influence those hard dates and requirements you have to 
have data; to get the data, you have to do the hard work of planning. There’s 
really no shortcut here and thinking that “we’ll just find a way” is just an excuse 
for not doing the actual planning. If I don’t have a plan for how the team will hit 
a hard date with the desired scope, I say so up front, but I always follow that up 
with options and data. I realize that this isn’t easy, and I’m sure every PM out 
there has struggled with this situation more than once. I’ve been fortunate that 
I’ve never been in a situation in which I felt that my job would be jeopardized 
by not going along with unrealistic dates. Not sure if that’s due to blind luck or 
not. I suspect it has to do with my mindset about this. I choose to see those 
mandates as negotiable targets where I need actionable data to influence the 
outcome. I choose not to see them as set-in-stone hard dates, to achieve which 
the team must do “whatever it takes.” “Whatever it takes” is a train wreck 
waiting to happen. “Negotiable targets” are the way off that train.
Saying Yes to Say No
Now let’s talk about one of the tricks of the trade of project management; 
saying yes instead of no. Consider this scenario:
You’re in the weekly program team meeting and the marketing rep proposes 
that you change the color of the control box chassis your team is developing. 
Instead of the brushed metal finish your team designed, she’d like you to just 
paint it Intel Blue. There are some reasonable marketing arguments for this 
change and the program team is looking for your buy-in. You know that the 

Managing Projects in the Real World
95
design for the chassis is completed and your team just finished the fit check. 
Orders for production volumes have been placed, so changing the exterior 
finish requires a lot more than just a can of Krylon. At this point you have 
three options, and which one you choose can greatly affect the amount of 
hassle this change generates for you and your team.
Your first choice is to just say, “No!” I call this the “Hard No”. You can use 
the argument that it would be too expensive and your team doesn’t have time 
to do this along with everything else they have on their plate. The problem 
here is that you’ve shut down all avenues of negotiation. If the program team 
decides they really need to make this change, then the only recourse is to 
escalate your refusal to entertain the request. You will find yourself explaining 
to your boss and major stakeholders why this change can’t be implemented. 
I see this scenario a lot with new PMs, and they truly don’t understand why 
everything is a battle. What they don’t see is that by using a “Hard No” 
they’ve boxed themselves in and the battle is inevitable.
Your second choice is what I call the “Doormat Yes” response. You agree to 
implement the change while you’re sitting there in the meeting with no sup-
porting data. In fact, this usually happens when the PM is inexperienced or just 
wants the confrontational discussion/peer pressure to go away. The problem 
here, of course, is that you’ve now committed to something you truly don’t 
know if you can deliver. You’ll spend the next week or more frantically trying 
to make this change happen and end up explaining over and over again why 
the change is necessary. Trust me, motivating a team to implement a change 
they aren’t bought-into is an uphill slog through the mud.
Your last option—and it’s the one I recommend—is to use what I call a 
“Conditional Yes”. Here you are going to play along and say something like 
this: “Yes, I’d be happy to take this back to my team and look into it. I’m sure 
we can work something out.” The slick part here is that you are agreeing to 
research the change but you are not agreeing to do it. This gives you time to 
work with your team to pull together impact statements and truly understand 
what it would take to implement the change: a designer or engineer needs 
to modify the chassis drawings for the change to the silkscreen and surface 
finish; someone needs to figure out the specific paint color to spec in; the 
total cost to rework the chassis already ordered needs to be determined; you 
need a schedule impact analysis; and a prototype is needed to ensure that the 
color and silkscreen are right. You see? There’s a lot more work here than 
just whipping out a can of Krylon and you need to help the program team 
understand what’s involved in making this change.
Once you have your data together, you can respond to the change request with 
options for the program team. Here’s where the power of the “Conditional 
Yes” comes into play. You are now viewed as a collaborative team member 
willing to negotiate. Of course, you’re going to propose a solution based on 
your impact analysis, but this time no one will feel the need to escalate your 

Chapter 7 | How to Say No to Unrealistic Target Dates
96
intransigence to your boss. Finally, your team isn’t going to need much motiva-
tion to implement the change. They are already bought into it and understand 
what they need to do, because they’ve done the analysis and prep work. In fact, 
I often find that the team does most of the work to implement the change 
before the request is fully approved. That can be good or bad, depending on 
the situation.
So what’s the trick? When confronted with a change request you either don’t 
want to implement or believe is the wrong direction to take, use a “Conditional 
Yes” to buy you some time. Use that time to develop a comprehensive picture 
of the change impact and then let the data speak for itself. You may still have 
to implement the change, but if that happens then you will know what it takes 
and have a much better understanding of why it’s important. It’s worth noting 
that, many times, the data really don’t support the change and it isn’t imple-
mented. The example about the control box chassis happened to me years 
ago, and in the end we didn’t paint the chassis because we found that the paint 
didn’t make that much of an impact when the box was fully assembled into 
the final product. They ended up painting some other component instead…
go figure. ☺
Just Because They Ask…
Have you ever had this happen? Your team is doing pretty good and in fact 
your schedule is trending early. Yahoo! Then a change request comes in that 
seems doable but is not part of the original scope. You know the kind of 
request I’m talking about: change the wording on a label; change the chassis 
color; order another vendor’s similar part to save some minor amount of 
money. Are these pretty easy to implement? Yep! Is it worth jeopardizing the 
project’s timeline to fulfill these requests? Not really.
It’s the little things that can sink you without you even seeing it coming. The 
next thing you know you find yourself trying to explain why you can’t ship 
the product early because the new labels are late. Trust me, there’s no way 
you can spin holding a product shipment due to the new labels being lost in 
shipping… it’s pretty indefensible and you feel like an idiot for not saying no 
to the original request.
Saying no to the big things is straightforward. You’re crystal clear on questions 
of integrity, ethics, values, and the like. You can trust your gut here, and these 
issues are generally easier to fight for because the stakes are high. Similarly, 
the big changes to your project are usually outside of your ability to veto; you 
just have to do them somehow.
However, saying no to the small things is much harder and much, much murkier. 
On the surface, the stakes are low, there’s little negative impact to you or 
your team, and it feels good to help someone else out. (Why is it always a 

Managing Projects in the Real World
97
favor to someone else that starts this chain reaction?) The problem is that 
there’s always the opportunity for a visit from Murphy and his infamous law. 
The more opportunities for things to go wrong on your project, the higher 
the likelihood that something will go wrong. This isn’t rocket science, yet 
I’ve seen this sink some of my projects that were well on their way to a suc-
cessful closure. There was the time the new valve vendor couldn’t actually 
deliver the volume we needed, or the time I spent hours reinstalling the old 
bus bars ’cause the new ones were delaminating. Let’s just say that I learned a 
really clear lesson the hard way, and it’s this: Just because they ask doesn’t 
mean you have to say yes.
Every time someone brings a new item to one of my project’s CCB meetings, 
I ask myself if this is a “must-do” item or a “nice-to-have” item. The “must-do” 
items are easy, as those are the “big things.” It’s everything else that can trip 
you up. The closer the team is to a design freeze, the greater the scrutiny of 
proposed changes. This is how it should work, and that’s not where the pitfalls 
generally lie in wait.
From my experience, the change requests that come in once you are well into 
execution pose the biggest risk. Engineers often confuse the ease of imple-
mentation with whether a change should be implemented. If something seems 
easy to do, you can bet that most of your team is going to be up for it. At this 
point, the PM needs to ask herself what would happen if the change isn’t imple-
mented. If the answer is “nothing,” then I suggest that you not make the change. 
You’re too close to the finish line to introduce doors for Murphy to walk in. 
Don’t do it! Trust me on this one! Instead of saying yes here, propose that the 
change be integrated into the next project or product upgrade cycle. It’s very 
easy to incorporate these types of changes into a new project and you’ll save 
yourself the hassle of reprinting 100 copies of the user’s guide because some-
one changed the color of a chassis and the pictures no longer match!
I’d bet good money that if you thought about it for a few minutes you could 
recall a project that ended badly (or just roughly) due to these kinds of 
changes. Did you fail to anticipate the impact of a small change that later 
turned into a huge hassle? I hope this convinces you to get really tough 
on those late change requests and never confuse “easy to implement” with 
“should be implemented”!
The Nastiest Word in Change Control
I don’t know about you, but there’s one little four-letter word that sets the 
sirens blaring and the lights flashing in my mind. It’s the word just and you 
usually hear it thrown out in a rather cavalier manner when someone is 
proposing a design change. It goes something like this: “It’s just a matter of 
wrapping the code,” or “We’re just moving the lab two doors down,” or even 

Chapter 7 | How to Say No to Unrealistic Target Dates
98
“That should be no problem; it’s just adding another small power supply.” Yeah, 
I’ve heard ’em all and the word just is a four-alarm fire for me. Can you smell 
the smoke yet?
First let me point out that it’s never “just” anything. When that nasty word 
is thrown in the mix it tells you two very important things. First, the person 
throwing that adjective around in such a high-handed manner is not the 
person who will be doing the actual work. The second thing it tells you is 
that the person flaunting his engineering skills doesn’t really understand how 
much work is involved. It’s entirely possible that the just-er has done this 
type of thing in the past…the very distant past…back when slide rules ruled 
engineering, but it’s highly unlikely that they’ve dirtied their little fingers on it 
anytime recently.
Another thing you should realize is that you can’t argue these people away. 
They believe they’re right and anyone with a longer duration or higher com-
plexity for the work is just slackin’. They honestly believe the work takes a 
minimal amount of time/effort. Also, it’s highly likely that they don’t understand 
the business processes necessary to do the work or how long those processes 
take. I’m talking about those pesky things like legal reviews, regulatory compli-
ance, documentation, the whole change control process, and all that.
Okay, so how do you deal with a change request that’s “just” a “minimal” 
amount of work? In my experience, the only way you can win this game is to 
be patient and play along. Get the relevant players together to break down 
the work. That is, identify all the work that needs to be done and how it will 
slot into the exiting work the team has already committed. Once you get a 
comprehensive list of all the tasks that need to be done, you estimate how 
long each task will take and how much it will cost. At this point the person 
proposing the change will challenge some of the estimates and that’s okay. 
The point here is to get all the data on the table so the team can make a solid 
decision based on actual data. The end result of this exercise is a common 
understanding of the work involved to make the change. It could be that it 
really is a minor change with minimal impact, but frankly in my experience it 
never is.
Last, if it turns out that the work is “just” a bit more effort than was originally 
thought, be gracious and don’t rub it in. Take pride in the fact that everyone 
on your team learned something and that you were able to navigate this 
change request without calling out those big fire hoses. If you handle this type 
of change request well, then your stakeholder will remain an ally. If you resort 
to arguing the “just”-ness of the change request, you alienate the stakeholder 
and waste a lot of brain power on a dead end. So that’s it: beware of any 
change request that’s preceded by “just”—and if it happens, go immediately 
into data collection mode and sidestep the dead-end arguments.

A Special Case: 
Planning for the 
Holiday Season 
Most PMs miss this: the special case of deliberately planning for the chaos 
that surrounds the holiday season. In the United States, that season starts 
around mid-November and runs through the first half of January, but the 
concepts discussed here are really holiday-agnostic, so they should apply to 
whatever holiday season you have to deal with. The critical thing, regardless 
of the holiday, is to deliberately plan for its challenges.
The Dead Zone
If you ask me, there’s only one kind of project work that should go on  
during the last two weeks of December and the first week of January… the 
extremely urgent kind. I used to fool myself when I planned a project into 
thinking that meaningful amounts of work would get done during this time.  
I would think that since it’s still officially work time, then official work would  
get done. Wrong! It just ain’t so and woe to the PM who counts on it.
First, let me point out that everyone intends to get a lot done in December. 
We all honestly believe that we will have the same amount of work time 
that we’ve enjoyed all year long…then come the holiday parties, the endless 
round of management update forums, happy hours, team lunches, and so on. 
Now couple that with a more-active-than-normal social life and the various 
8
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 8 | A Special Case: Planning for the Holiday Season 
100
personal commitments during the holidays and you can see pretty quickly that 
your quality work time just evaporates. Even if you don’t observe the holidays 
or are a conscientious objector to them, your work time is affected. E-mails 
are returned more slowly, deliverables slip their commits, people aren’t around 
when you look for them, and people commit deliverables over longer than 
normal durations. Face it: we’re all über-busy this time of year.
So what’s a conscientious PM to do? Well, I always strive to make sure my 
project plan and schedule reflect reality. Good, bad, or ugly—reality is what it 
is and you have to take it into account in your planning. To do this, I modify 
the working days in MS Project to show these weeks to be non-working days. 
(You can modify the teams’ utilization down to something like 40% but I find 
it easier just to designate those days as non-working ones.) Yep, that’s right I 
deliberately plan to have no work done for three weeks. I don’t exactly advertise 
this to the program manager—or to the functional managers either, for that 
matter. I’m not going to lie about it, but I’m not exactly gonna take out a 
billboard with this information on it either. Now, don’t get me wrong, no one 
stops working on the project. It’s just that I’ve planned for no work to get 
done. This actually gives me two strategic advantages.
The first advantage is that this time can be used as buffer to be consumed if 
we are falling behind on the project. In my experience, people are motivated 
to catch up if there’s a realistic expectation that it’s doable. By planning for the 
inevitable slowdown that occurs during holidays, you have a built-in period of 
time during which it’s conceivable that a team can catch up without Herculean 
efforts. This strategy has come in very handy more than once and, while it’s a 
bit of a shell game, it is effective.
The second advantage of planning for minimal work to be completed at the 
end of the year is that you don’t have to drive your team like a pack of Santa’s 
Elves on Christmas Eve to get important deliverables completed. Why expect 
someone to skip their team holiday lunch if you don’t have to? Do you really 
want to tell someone that they have to miss their kid’s debut as a Christmas 
tree in the local school play? I sure as heck don’t and that’s the point. If the 
deliverable isn’t urgent, then why not give people a break? By deliberately 
planning the project work to accommodate the realities of this time of year, 
you are doing just that. Despite what you might have come to believe, this is 
not a bad thing. The project team doesn’t have to work 24/7 to complete its 
work if the work is properly planned.
Okay, in opening I mentioned that I thought that only extremely urgent proj-
ect work should be happening in this holiday season. Here, I have to give a 
shout-out to all those teams in organizations that have big market windows 
right after the holidays. If you do product development in these teams, then 
there’s a strong chance you have major releases or deliverables due at the 
end of the year. These are the folks who care a lot about the Consumer 
Electronics Show (CES), which happens in early January. The holiday season 

Managing Projects in the Real World
101
for these folks inevitably involves a lot of long hours. I’ve been there and I’ve 
felt your pain. That’s just the way that particular cookie crumbles, and solid 
planning will help here too but it won’t completely alleviate the last-minute 
crunch-time, either.
There are times when it’s “pedal to the metal” during the holidays—but for 
many of us, that’s just not the case. So PMs out there, have a heart. Plan for 
the reality of the holiday season and stop drivin’ those elves crazy this time 
of year! ☺
I Call BS!
So hopefully, I’ve convinced you to incorporate the holiday associated shut-
downs, slowdowns, and vacations in your schedules. There’s one more thing 
PMs should be doing in October to get ready for the rush to the end of the 
year, and that’s to review your team’s deliverable due dates.
I’ve worked my share of holidays over the years, and in that time I’ve seen 
a lot of project deliverables that had a due date in the first week in January. 
Sure, there are those very rare cases when your customer does actually need 
your piece of the pie on January 3rd, but, by and large, the real date that your 
customer is going to do anything with your deliverable is more like the second 
or even third week in January. See, they take vacations during the holidays too. 
So whenever I run across a “need-by date” of January 1st, I call BS!
Okay, just because my BS Meter is pegging out doesn’t mean that my team 
and I don’t have to hit that date…it’s still the formal commit right? So the first 
thing I have to figure out is whether my team can hit that January 1st commit 
without working over the holidays. If we’re on track and I’ve incorporated all 
of their vacations and the company non-working days into the schedule, then  
I challenge the team to get the deliver done early. Every team I’ve worked with 
in this scenario is more than willing to put in the OT in October to be able 
to take off at the end of the year with a completed project in the bag. This 
strategy also works if you’re trending a few days behind but can recover and 
deliver early. It’s a great feeling to be walking out the door right before the 
end of the year knowing that you’ve done good work and your team has hit 
that deliverable early.
Now as we all know, it’s not always the case that you’re on track or able to 
pull in the deliverable. Sometimes the team is just going to have to work 
through the holidays. To put it bluntly—this will kill your team’s morale and it 
should be avoided if at all possible. So what’s a PM to do? Well, the first thing 
you need to do is figure this out early…as in October! Now is the time to 
scrutinize your schedule and make the call whether the team needs to work 
through the holidays. Before you make that call, however, you need to go 
back to your customer and verify that they really do need the deliverable on 

Chapter 8 | A Special Case: Planning for the Holiday Season 
102
January 3rd at 8AM. Most of the time this is a bogus date and you can negoti-
ate something later. Be up front with your customer and let them know that 
you and your team are willing to work through the holiday if there’s a real 
need. What I’ve found, time after time, is that the customer doesn’t want to 
force anyone to work over the holidays any more than you do. They are usu-
ally willing to work with you here. Of course, this assumes that you’ve built a 
collaborative relationship with your customer ahead of time.
What about that worst-case scenario where your customer is inflexible, your 
team’s behind schedule, and you’ve got to tell them that they need to work on 
12/26? I’m not going to sugar-coat this…it’s hard. Really hard. The one thing 
that makes this bad news more palatable is that it’s delivered early in October. 
It’s much easier to get your team on board with working the last few weeks 
of the year if you hit them with this before they make their personal vacation 
plans. Ever tried convincing someone to work over the holiday after they’d 
purchased expensive airline tickets? ’Nuff said. It goes without saying that 
you’re going to need some major motivational tools and probably some sort 
of incentive to get everyone on board. No one’s gonna be happy about work-
ing over the holidays and you’re going to have to pull out your “A” game here 
to keep the train on the rails.
So what’s my main point here? Figure it out now! Scrutinize your project 
schedules and your customer commits. It’s so much better to deal with these 
kinds of challenges in October versus the week before Thanksgiving. It’s also 
important to realize that as the PM, the person responsible for the project 
plan, it’s your job to plan the work such that no one has to work over vaca-
tions or holidays in the first place. Failing to plan the work properly means 
that you’re letting your team down. So if you haven’t already taken care of this 
stuff, do it now—and I really hope you don’t have to ask anyone to work on 
December 26th.

Execution Phase

P A R T  

Leadership 
Showtime
Project management presents unique leadership challenges. You’re the team 
leader—but no one reports to you, you probably have minimal control of the 
project budget, and you have multiple bosses. Sure, you can find good ideas 
from traditional leadership tomes, but there are some unique challenges that 
PMs face. I’m talking about the challenges in motivating and influencing a team 
because—face it—you’ve got to get the work done through other people 
without direct authority. Here are a few of the tips and tricks I’ve learned 
along the way about what it means to be an effective leader as a PM.
More Action, Less Talkin’
I’m sure you’ve heard the old saw about actions speaking louder than words. 
For a PM this can be a valuable tool in your quest to influence and motivate 
your team. It’s perilous to forget that, as the PM, you are the leader of the 
team and folks will be watching what you do more closely than they will listen 
to what you say. This is why role-modeling desired behavior is so effective. 
Further, no one will follow where you lead if your actions don’t match your 
words. So what does this look like for a PM? Let me give you some ideas for 
where you can use deliberate actions to reinforce a team dynamic, be more 
effective as a leader, and promote an atmosphere of collaboration.
PMs often fail when it comes to aligning actions to words in their meeting 
preparation. I can remember back to a time when I didn’t pay attention to 
how I set up meetings and only minimally prepared for them. I’d stick a stale, 
standing agenda in the calendar hit and that was the extent of my meeting prep.  
I’d expect the team members to be prepared to discuss their work, any help 
9
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 9 | Leadership Showtime
106
they needed, plans for the next week, and so forth but I was never prepared to 
do the same. I didn’t see this as a problem because I was so busy just keeping 
my head above water figuring out how to manage the project. Furthermore, 
because my teammates never grilled me on my own deliverables—schedule 
status, risk-management plans, escalation resolution, and so on—I didn’t really 
see any disconnect between what I was doing and what I was asking the team 
to do. I look back on that time now and cringe. I was monitoring the project 
work rather than actively managing it. Ah, the follies of youth...
Speaking of meetings, PMs spend a lot of time in ’em, mostly talking. It’s easy 
to get so caught up in that meeting mindset that you miss opportunities to 
do some actual work. Not to say that work doesn’t happen in meetings, mind 
you, but often it’s faster just to do the work than it is to set up the meeting to 
discuss the work that needs to be done. Ask yourself this: In your last team 
meeting did you take an action item to set up a follow-up meeting for some 
issue? If so, is this something you could have handled directly without the 
additional meeting? Could the desired outcome have been achieved by doing 
actual work instead holding yet another meeting? See where I’m goin’ here?
Okay, here’s an example from my current projects. I need to include test 
results/data in my weekly status updates. This data resides on a web applica-
tion for which I do have an account. More than once, however, I’ve sent an 
e-mail to the QA engineer asking for the update instead of just pulling the 
data myself. It’s “faster” for me to send the e-mail—but if you count my time 
plus the QA engineer’s time to read my e-mail, pull the data, and then send it 
to me, then it’s much faster if I just do the work myself! I really need to step 
it up and just pull the data myself. Just sayin’…
One thing I’ve come to realize is that if you want your team to backstop each 
other and help out where there’s a need, then you have to role-model that 
behavior yourself. If you’ve got the time, then offer to pick up/deliver parts, 
review technical docs, place POs—whatever it is that someone else is strug-
gling to get done. The help is always appreciated and it’s usually a nice change 
of pace for you. Often we get so hung up in the “that’s-not-my-job” mindset 
that we lose track of the fact that it’s a 10-minute task. When I worked in 
a product group at Intel, I’d periodically deliver parts to the validation team 
in the next building. Sure, it wasn’t my job, but it only took me 10 minutes 
and I got a nice break out of the deal. More importantly, it reinforced the 
­collaborative team dynamic I was trying to build. 
Today I always put thought into my meeting agendas and effort into preparing 
for team meetings. Further, I look for ways to help the team with the project 
work, especially when I’m not buried myself. Sure, I can badger someone to 
go audit our marketing collateral and figure out what’s missing, or I could just 
do it myself, especially if the marketing rep for the team is buried. I like the 
variety, plus it reinforces a team dynamic that values team members pitching in 
where needed. In the end, it’s often the little things we do that matter. So the 

107
Managing Projects in the Real World
next time you see a teammate struggling to get something done, ask yourself if 
there’s an opportunity for you to pitch in and role-model the kind of behavior 
that supports a collaborative team dynamic. If so, then, as the Nike ad urges, 
“Just Do It!”
Dollar Waitin’ on a Dime
One of the most important parts of managing a project is maintaining the pace 
of work. It’s critical that work continue on the project at a predictable pace 
according to the plan. Sure, as the PM I have a lot of things vying for my atten-
tion, so I have to make smart choices about where I spend my time. From my 
own experience I know that the “biggest bang for my buck” is to make sure 
all of the handoffs, virtual and/or real, happen when they should, the way they 
were planned to happen. What you don’t want to happen is a situation my dad 
used to refer to as “a dollar waitin’ on a dime.”
On a project, those “dollars” are tasks on the critical path. One of your most 
important tasks as a PM is to make sure that the work progresses along the 
critical path as efficiently and quickly as possible. Anything that slows down 
the pace of work on the critical path needs some immediate intervention. In 
the real world this means I wear a lot of hats. I’ll deliver parts to the shipping 
dock or I’ll “remind” a developer that he still needs to generate the install 
instructions. I might walk documents through a legal review or escalate a 
resource shortage. Basically, I’m plugging gaps and integrating the handoff of 
work into a seamless flow. Now, I know that there are PMs out there who 
think this stuff isn’t their job. You could be right, but in these circumstances 
being “right” doesn’t rack up the “dollars”—now does it?
The “dimes” in project management are the little, inconsequential things that 
can trip your team up. Communication breakdowns come to mind here as a 
prime source of “dimes.” In fact, just the other day I was in a meeting in which 
two teammates were locked in a heated exchange when it dawned on me that 
the problem was that they were using the same word to mean different things. 
(Can you say platform here? Is there any other word that gets misunderstood 
more often at companies that develop products? What exactly to do you 
mean by the word platform? I’m betting it’s not what I mean when I use that 
word. ☺) There’s also the poorly written e-mail where the reader has to infer 
some action item or some conclusion from the morass of data. “Dimes” can 
also be stupid things like not having enough washers (I speak from experience 
here! Trust me, just order more than you think you’ll need), labels, or physical 
space on a tester. Here’s an example of what I’m talking about. Back in the day, 
there was the case of the missing gasline filter. There we were, unable to ship 
a multimillion-dollar tool on time because we “lost” a $200 gasline filter. Fun 
times….now that’s what I call a “dollar waitin’ on a dime”!

Take a minute to think about how you spent your time yesterday. Did you 
enable some “dollars”? Are the active tasks on your critical path progressing 
as quickly and efficiently as possible? If not, where are those “dimes”? The trick 
is to train yourself to think about and recognize the “dimes” so that you can 
deal with them early and not endanger your team’s progress. Oh, and be sure 
you’re not the holdup for any work either…in the words of my dad, don’t be 
the “dime” the “dollar” is waitin on!
How to Escalate Effectively
Escalating issues is a skill most PM’s think they’ve mastered, but I don’t see it. 
Copying your boss on an e-mail is not effective escalation. Nor is pushing the 
other party into a corner where they have no choice but to give in. Effective 
escalation is hard to do and almost no one asks himself, “How do I escalate 
this?”. I’ve said it before and it should be repeated: effective escalation is one 
of the primary ways a PM contributes to the team’s work.
First, let’s start with what effective escalation looks like. The escalation is 
effective when 1) the problem is addressed and something is done to resolve 
or reduce its impact, and 2) all parties walk away happy or at least amicable.
That’s pretty straightforward right? Okay, so how do you do it? To be honest, 
there’s no one “right” way to do it, and you will frequently have to try mul-
tiple approaches to get it right. It’s not uncommon to struggle with this when 
you’re new to an organization or program. It just takes time to know who the 
players are and how they play the game. In the interests of reducing that time 
it takes to get effective, here are some things to consider when you escalate 
an issue:
Just because you 
• 
can doesn’t mean you should. (Yeah,  
I know I use this phrase a lot… probably means I need to 
get it tattooed on my bicep or something.) Often I find 
that there really isn’t a problem per se; instead the team 
needs some clear direction. For example, once you’ve fro-
zen the requirements, any change must follow the formal 
change control process. So if someone wants the team 
to do something not outlined in those requirements, she 
can submit a change request (and therefore kick off thor-
ough impact analysis)—but until then, that work is out of 
scope. End of discussion, problem solved, ’nuff said. Keep 
the team focused on what they need to do, and don’t 
escalate something that’s not a real issue.
Copying your boss, your antagonist’s boss, or heck any-
• 
one else’s boss doesn’t work. CYA emails are not effective 
escalation. You know how much email you get; do you 

109
Managing Projects in the Real World
carefully read each bit of flotsam and jetsam that crosses 
your desk? Is your boss even going to see and compre-
hend the escalation? Also, consider the fact that your 
boss probably expects you to deal with the issue directly. 
In general, I find email escalations to be the least effec-
tive tool in my arsenal of awesome escalation activities.  
(Ha! Try saying that three times fast!)
Now, let’s say that your boss is completely ineffectual at 
• 
removing roadblocks and solving problems. What should 
you do? If you’re me, then you just go figure out who’s the 
decision maker and escalate to them. As a rule, it’s never 
a good idea to go over your boss’s head, but sometimes 
this will resolve an issue quickly. I’ve worked for people 
who are happy to have me solve the problem as long as 
I keep them apprised of what I’m doing. I’ve also worked 
for managers who’d freak out if I so much as said “hi” to 
their boss—much less their boss’s boss. You have to gauge 
your relationship with your boss and make a judgment call 
as to whether or not this is the right tactic to try.
Escalate and resolve the problem in person if at all pos-
• 
sible—even if it means you have to drive to another site. 
Okay, this isn’t an excuse for a quick road trip to Portland 
and its many brewpubs, but if you can drive over to 
another building and talk to someone face to face, do that 
instead of sending an email or calling. If you can’t look the 
other person in the eye (don’t forget video conferencing), 
then pick up the phone and try talking to them directly. 
Written communication leaves too much room for mis-
interpretation and it’s slow and static for dialogue.
To avoid a static dialogue that resolves nothing, remem-
• 
ber to put yourself in the other person’s place. What’s 
important to them? What’s causing them the most pain? 
Why do they even care about the problem? Would a par-
tial solution work just as well? The better you understand 
the other person’s perspective, the greater the likelihood 
that you can work out a solution that satisfies everyone. 
Remember that you’re going to need to collaborate with 
this person later, so don’t light the bridge on fire as you’re 
walkin’ across it.
Finally, perhaps the most important thing to consider 
• 
is this: Don’t stop until the problem is resolved. All the 
way! If you can’t give clear direction to the team, then 
you aren’t done escalating the problem. If anyone on your 

Chapter 9 | Leadership Showtime
110
team is completely blocked and can’t get anything else 
done, then you aren’t done escalating. We all know how 
it feels to have someone “own” solving the problem and 
yet we’re the ones with the mess when the problem isn’t 
solved. Don’t do that to your team. Keep at it till the 
problem’s solved.
Let me be very clear here: I strongly believe that as the PM, part of your job 
is to remove roadblocks and escalate those problems you can’t solve yourself. 
Your team is counting on you, and if you’re ineffective at escalating issues, 
then in reality you’re letting the entire team down. Figure out how to escalate 
effectively and don’t stop until you’ve solved the problem all the way, even if 
you don’t totally agree with the solution. The important thing is to get clear 
direction for your team and remove roadblocks.
How to Get Folks to Do Their Jobs
If everyone just did what he or she were supposed to do, then companies 
wouldn’t need PMs right? I mean, if it’s your job to develop the training mate-
rial for my project, then you should just do it on time without intervention 
from me right? Uh-huh…how’s that working for you, Sparky? Not very well? 
I know what you mean and, trust me, I’ve got a bunch of T-shirts from that 
hassle too. Here’s the thing, though: if it really were that simple they wouldn’t 
need us. The fact of the matter is that your peers have a lot on their plates 
and your project just might not be at the top of their personal priority lists. 
This is where that influence thing comes in. More likely you will be dealing 
with someone who doesn’t understand how to make good commitments or 
who honestly struggles with time management. Those may be the root causes 
of people not doing their job, but as the PM you’ve got to deal with the symp-
toms as well. Just how do you get people to meet their commitments?
Meeting Commitments
There’s not a PM out there who hasn’t encountered the problem of getting 
certain team members to meet commitments. We’ve all been there… there’re 
always a few holdouts on the team who are “too busy” to close action items 
or who keep “forgetting” them.
Your immediate response is to find out why they aren’t meeting their com-
mitments. Yes, grasshopper, in order to solve the problem, you need to under-
stand why the problem is happening in the first place. How do you do that? 
Well, to be blunt, you go ask the person with the slipping commitments. The 
key here is to approach the conversation carefully and collaboratively. You 
need to understand if the person is overloaded, at an impasse, unmotivated, 
or just out to get you. Okay, that last one is probably not what’s going on, but 

111
Managing Projects in the Real World
you get my drift. You need to plan this conversation out, even if that means 
jotting down some notes ahead of time.
Here are some things to consider when faced with this dilemma:
If this is your first attempt to address the problem, then 
• 
I’d suggest something like this…“Hi Melanie! Wow, you 
seem pretty busy these days. How’s that action item 
coming? Need any help closing it?”
If the teammate/stakeholder gives you the “everything’s-
• 
on-track” spiel but you know it’s not, then you probably 
need a different approach. I recommend a “show-me” 
approach. To be honest, I’m a pretty curious person, so 
it’s easy for me to ask some questions that require the 
teammate to pull up a document and show me. This is 
the “trust-but-verify” axiom at work.
If this is a repeatable pattern that you’ve tried to address 
• 
in the past, then address it head-on. Start with something 
like, “You know, Melanie, you haven’t been able to close an 
action item on time in the last month. What’s going on?  
Is there something I can do to help?”
Finally, if the person is downright hostile or completely 
• 
unwilling to close the task, then it’s time to escalate. But 
do yourself and your teammate a favor and let them 
know that’s what you’re going to do. Try something like, 
“Okay, Melanie, clearly we can’t resolve this issue our-
selves. However, the action item must be closed for the 
project work to continue. At this point I need to advise 
the stakeholders that we are stuck and need some help 
to get this work completed.” Remain professional and 
make it clear that you are escalating the roadblock, not 
the teammate’s performance or lack thereof.
Most of the time, just the act of figuring out why your teammate isn’t meet-
ing commitments gives you all the info you need to fix the problem. However, 
there’s always the tricky scenario where the teammate doesn’t know how 
to make good commitments. After you’ve gained some experience as a PM, 
you’ll have a good sense of when this is happening. I’m always doubtful when 
a teammate tells me that they’ll provide a late deliverable “by the end of the 
day” or even better “by the end of the week,” especially when I know it’s a lot 
of work and they haven’t started on it yet. When this happens I try to coach 
the person to think about how much work is needed versus how much time 
they have to do it. Nine times out of ten, the teammate has made a knee-jerk 
commitment without thinking through the work and their schedule. Another 
thing the PM should consider in this scenario is when the deliverable is really 

Chapter 9 | Leadership Showtime
112
needed. If it makes sense, then cut your teammate some slack by pushing out 
the due date, while helping them understand how much work they need to 
put into it.
Now, let’s say that there’s no smoking gun as to why the team member doesn’t 
meet their commitments, nor do they make careless ones. What you prob-
ably need here is more motivation. Sometimes it’s as straightforward as asking 
someone what turns their crank. When that doesn’t work, consider how to 
engage the team dynamic. I’ve found that a team with a strong collaborative 
dynamic can be motivated by simple rewards. Hey, face it, we all want to win 
and be seen as winners. These goals are deliberately challenging and require 
the entire team to work together. When the entire team is bought into achiev-
ing the goal, then I find that individual contributors are in turn motivated by 
their team to meet or exceed their commitments. It should be noted that 
there’s a fine line between a stretch goal reward and bribery, and you need to 
make sure you aren’t bribing the team to do their work. Motivating a team or 
an individual is tricky and takes a lot of effort to master, but when you get it 
right, suddenly there are no more missed commitments.
Okay, these are the tips and tricks I use when faced with a team member 
who doesn’t meet commitments. This is the application of those dreaded 
“soft skills” that make the project management gig so interesting. It’s not easy 
and I’m not sure it’s “art,” but I know for a fact that you can turn this kind of 
­teammate around with a bit of focused effort.
Hold ’em Accountable
Okay, now let’s talk about accountability. Specifically, how do you hold some-
one accountable to the team?
You’d think that this idea of accountability to your work group would be a 
no-brainer, but it’s not. If your organization has a culture that’s non-confronta-
tional, overly confrontational, low-integrity, or just plain lazy, then it’s likely that 
no one is held accountable for their work. If you yourself are deathly afraid 
of coming across as a micromanager, then you could be slacking in this area. 
Often PMs think they are holding their teammates accountable but, in actual-
ity, there are no consequences for failing to do the work, missing a deadline, 
delivering with crappy quality, and so forth. Further, depending on the team 
dynamic, it’s often up to the PM to hold team members accountable, but they 
may feel that they have no authority to enforce any consequences. Just how 
you hold people accountable has a lot to do with how effective you are at 
leading that team and will greatly affect the overall project performance.
We’ve all worked in organizations or on teams in which being accountable for 
your work was as foreign a concept as Cheez Whiz in France. Sure, everyone 
knows about it (okay, maybe not the French) but no one actually partakes 

113
Managing Projects in the Real World
of it. It looks like this… It’s Thursday and you are expecting the marketing 
rep on your team to have uploaded the collateral for your upcoming release 
to the appropriate website. You believe that the marketing rep was clear 
about the due date and he’s been telling you for weeks that his collateral is 
“in progress”—yet here it is, 5 PM on the day before the release, and no col-
lateral in sight. There could be a number of things that have contributed to 
the lack of collateral, but I’d bet my lunch money that this is not the first time 
this team member has let the team down…and, as in the past, there are no 
consequences for it! Sound familiar?
So just how do you hold someone accountable for her work? Well, the most 
effective strategy I’ve run across to do this involves a two-step approach. The 
first step is to be very clear about the deliverable and the due date. You really 
need the other person to confirm your understanding here, or you’ll have dif-
ferent problems later. Confirm that the other person has the ability to do the 
work and make sure that the due date is reasonable. The second step is the 
follow up and it’s where most of us drop the ball. To be able to hold people 
accountable you have to formally follow up.
What do I mean by “formally follow up”? I’m not talking about a lot of slide-
ware; rather I’m talking about a deliberate discussion between you and your 
teammate. You need to put something on the calendar, and you both need to 
be honest about the deliverable. If it’s of shoddy quality, then as the PM, you 
owe the other person the courtesy of explaining why the quality level is not 
acceptable. If the work turns out to be more complex than originally thought 
and the due date is no longer reasonable, then the other person needs to 
speak up and say so. (You need to set the expectation that if this happens your 
teammate will let you know as soon as possible, rather than at the last min-
ute.) If the deliverable is not met by the due date, then you need to explain to 
the other person the impacts of this late deliverable—and the consequences.
Holding people accountable is intrinsically linked with those consequences. 
They are the stick, not the carrot. From my experience, the more tangible the 
consequence—for instance, missing a product launch—the less likely you are 
to see people dropping the ball. However, sometimes the consequences are 
not obvious to the other person and you’re going to have to help him under-
stand what he doesn’t see. Did his failure to deliver result in a loss of trust? 
Did it cause a hardship for another teammate? How about some damage to 
his professional reputation? What has it done to the team dynamic? These 
are sticky topics to bring up with your teammate, and you’re going to want 
to plan out how you confront the other person before you ever open your 
mouth. Make no mistake, though, as the PM it is your responsibility to have 
that discussion and bring those consequences to the forefront. I also happen 
to think it’s your job to help the other person overcome whatever happened 
and be successful the next time.

Chapter 9 | Leadership Showtime
114
If you fail to address a missed deadline, a crappy deliverable, a failure to act, or 
whatever, then you are letting your team down. In the microcosm of a project 
team, the PM is the leader and, as the saying goes, “The buck stops here!” Part 
of your value-add is this ability to hold everyone accountable to the same 
standard. If you have a pretty stable team that’s in the “performing” stage, then 
it’s likely that the individual team members will be the ones to step up and say, 
“Melanie, you completely let us down by not finishing that drawing on time. 
How are you going to get it done now, and how are you going to prevent it 
from happening again?” That’s the best-case scenario—but in the real world, 
the PM has to model that behavior and have that discussion. Here’s the thing: 
even if it’s a small thing, a failure to hold others and yourself accountable ulti-
mately results in a loss of respect. Think about it. If I fail to hold you to your 
commitments, then at least on some level you know that you can blow my 
deliverable off because there are no consequences. Does that make you a bad 
person? No, but it sure does lower your respect for me, doesn’t it? Tolerate 
no lack of accountability!
The Art of the Nag
As a project manager you often have to remind people of their lagging com-
mitments or get information from busy or reluctant sources. These are the 
people who aren’t returning your phone calls and are basically ignoring your 
e-mails. When you do manage to corner them in person they are distracted, 
vague, dodgy, or otherwise evasive. The problem is that you need their infor-
mation/action, but if you escalate up the managerial food chain you will do 
permanent damage to your relationship. What’s a poor PM to do?
You need to motivate these people into action, and one way to do it is to nag 
them into it. Now being called a nag is not a good thing, as it connotes images 
of that ex-boyfriend/girlfriend who kept whining about the fact that you for-
got to pick up beer or roses, as the case may be. (Admit it; you can hear that 
nasally voice whining right now, can’t you? Insert bone-shaking shudder here.) 
It’s irritating and no one wants to deal with it. Obviously, this is not the kind 
of nagging that will get you positive results.
There is another kind of nagging that will work. The key here is to realize that 
in a dynamic, highly matrixed environment, there are times when people have 
more work assigned than they can reasonably do. Everyone gets overloaded 
occasionally, and then your request for information just isn’t at the top of the 
other person’s priority list. This lack of responsiveness isn’t personal and, 
once you accept that, I think you can be very successful at nagging without 
alienating anyone. This is what I refer to as The Art of the Nag.
First, a few disclaimers: This is not an appropriate technique for urgent issues 
and will not address the root cause of the dodgy behavior. What it will do is 
get you the result you need with minimal effort on your part and manageable 

115
Managing Projects in the Real World
frustration on the part of the person being nagged. Do not use this technique 
as a replacement for direct confrontation if that’s what’s really needed.
Your goal is to leave a voicemail for the other person. Yes, a voicemail, not 
an e-mail, not an IM—your actual voice talking. The tone and timing of this 
call will be critical. In fact, it’s almost detrimental to actually speak to them. 
Practice the message you want to leave beforehand so that you can utter it 
with a friendly, positive tone. Depending on how frustrated you are, this may 
take some effort. (That’s probably what I’m doing if you hear me muttering 
to myself in some deserted stairwell.) Simply state your name, that you are 
following up on XYZ, and that you wanted to know when you can expect it. 
Do not threaten dire consequences, sound angry, or give the other person any 
reason to become defensive.
Step 1: After a few missed commits or several days 
of dodgy behavior, place your first phone call. Time 
this call carefully so that you don’t actually talk to the 
person. You’re leaving a friendly reminder that ideally 
the person will hear at a natural start time for work. 
The best time for this first voicemail is in the morning. 
Time it such that he gets your message first thing after 
arriving in the office.
Step 2: Repeat this every morning for three days 
as long as you get no resolution. Note that this call 
shouldn’t take you more than two minutes to place. 
Further, don’t follow up in any other manner on this 
issue unless you just happen to luck into a natural place 
to do it, but if he is actively dodging you, that’s unlikely 
to happen.
Step 3: On the third day, if you still have not received 
the data you’re looking for, step it up to two calls a 
day. The best time for this second call is during the 
lunch hour, so that he can get the message right after 
returning from lunch. At this point you still need to 
have a positive and friendly tone. Don’t refer to the fact 
that you’ve now left numerous messages. Trust me, he 
already knows this and is probably feeling guilty about 
not addressing your request.
Step 4: Continue the two calls per day for a few more 
days. Honestly, I rarely have to implement two calls per 
day and I’ve never had to place two calls a day more 
than once.

Chapter 9 | Leadership Showtime
116
That’s it! It’s fast, it’s easy, and it works. As long as it’s done carefully, no one 
goes away angry and you can come back to that person again on your next 
project. I usually don’t even have to go to Step 3, so that’s a total time invest-
ment of about 10 minutes spread over three days. So, the next time you are 
frustrated with this kind of situation, try The Art of the Nag and see how it 
works for you.
Evaluating Your Teammates’ Performance 
If you’re managing projects, then it’s only a matter of time before you’re asked 
to provide performance feedback on some (or all) of your teammates. There 
was a time when I was regularly writing 20+ performance reviews every 
year and eventually I figured out how to do it. So I’m going to break down 
Melanie’s Guide to Writing Performance Reviews for you:
1.	 Rule #1 is to provide the same feedback in writing that 
you would say to the person directly. If you don’t have the 
professional respect for your teammate to say whatever 
it is to her face, then don’t put it in writing to her boss.
2.	 If you’re a PM, never turn down a request for feedback 
on one of your teammates (except in the case of Rule 7).  
It also goes without saying that you need to provide  
the feedback by the requested due date or negotiate a 
better one.
3.	 Always, always, always include something positive. Trust 
me on this one, there’s always something good to say 
about everyone. If you are struggling with this one, then 
take a step back and look at this person’s job description. 
There’s bound to be something he is decent at, even if it’s 
only data entry.
4.	 Always, always, always include some area of improvement. 
Often I recommend that the person work on expand-
ing her knowledge of the market segment and customer 
base, because I believe that knowledge can help you make 
better trade-off decisions.
5.	 Keep your comments brief and support them with spe-
cific examples. It’s especially important to provide specifics 
if you are discussing areas of improvement. If your feed-
back is particularly negative, then make double-darn sure 
that the data supports this feedback.

117
Managing Projects in the Real World
6.	 Set up an Outlook folder to collect specific activities,  
recognition, or events that you can use when it’s time to 
write performance reviews. Every time I submit a recog-
nition request or send a “thank-you for-your-hard-work” 
e-mail, I dump it in this folder so that I have plenty of 
material come January.
7.	 If you are uncomfortable or uneasy providing feedback, 
then stick to the facts, such as, “Melanie attended 8 of 
10 meetings and submitted all of her collateral on time.”  
If you are particularly uncomfortable providing the feed-
back, then I suggest professionally declining to do so.
8.	 If you have a lot of people to provide feedback for, then 
consider swinging by your local bookstore for a perfor-
mance appraisal phrase book. These books are great for 
getting you started and for helping you say “Melanie is an 
adequate employee” for the umpteenth time.
There you go: some tips for writing performance feedback for your teams.  
As a PM, you’re going to get more than your share of requests for feedback so 
it makes sense to figure out how to do it effectively. Sure, you’re not respon-
sible for anyone’s complete performance review, but as a team leader your 
input is often solicited by resource managers and it’s not uncommon to find 
bits and pieces of your feedback copied directly into the employee’s perfor-
mance appraisal. Make sure that whatever you say can be backed up with data 
and put your best effort into it. Remember, it may not be that important to 
you—but it’s awfully important to the person you’re reviewing!
The PM as a Coach
One part of project management that you don’t hear a lot about is the coach-
ing or mentoring aspect of the job. As the PM, you are a leader of a specific 
team and are probably viewed as an SME within your organization. As such, 
you are often consulted by people with problems they need help solving.  
How you approach these requests can greatly affect how your teammates 
relate to you. A helpful, friendly coach is obviously much more appreciated 
than a surly, dictatorial despot, right? However, understanding what you should 
do in these situations is a bit murkier, so this section discusses the common 
coaching opportunities that come up in the course of managing a project.
Let’s start off with the easiest scenario: What should you do when someone 
needs your help deciding whether or not a formal change request is needed? 
Even with my experienced team, this one comes up regularly. Often I find that 
the other person knows the answer—yes, they need to do a formal change 
request. You need to ask some basic probing questions about the pending 

Chapter 9 | Leadership Showtime
118
change to help the person solidify a hunch that the change request is needed. 
In most cases, if the change impacts form, fit, or function, then you need to do 
a change request. So I’ll ask the other person what’s being impacted and help 
him understand that it’s important to communicate these types of changes 
across the entire team.
PMs will often find themselves in the coaching role when a teammate is  
hesitant to go talk to someone else. In this scenario, my teammate asks me to 
go talk to an important stakeholder—but one who is most likely difficult for 
them. As a general rule, I don’t do this. What I will do is coach my teammate 
in how to talk to that difficult person. I’ll talk about what I think motivates 
that stakeholder, what they care about, and, most importantly, why my team-
mate may be failing in communicating with this difficult person. I’ll also coach 
my teammate on what to say and how to say it. The thing to remember is 
that most people are not as advanced as PMs when it comes to communica-
tion skills, so often you will need to share your knowledge in this area to help 
someone else out. If none of these tactics work, then I will volunteer to go talk 
to that difficult stakeholder with my teammate, but for me the most important 
aspect of this whole scenario is that my teammate learn how to deal with 
difficult people.
Speaking of difficult people, perhaps the most difficult person to coach is the 
one who is unwilling to ask for help even if they are drowning. I once worked 
with this guy who was incapable of asking for help. He would come into my 
cube and talk around an issue he was having, but he would never actually 
come out and ask for my advice or help. If I tried to tell him what he should 
do directly, he’d immediately respond with something along the lines of, “I got 
this.” The thing was…he didn’t have anything and really needed the coach-
ing. I finally hit on a strategy that I’ve since used successfully to deal with this 
type of coaching opportunity. I simply couch my advice like this: “Hmm, that’s 
a tricky one isn’t it? If it were me, I’d definitely take Melanie out to lunch and 
try to win her over with lots of chocolate cake!” Okay, I probably wouldn’t 
be that blatant, but I’ve found that the “if-it-were-me-I’d-do-xyz” makes the 
coaching much more palatable to someone who can’t ask for help. And my 
colleague? Well, I’d hear him in his cube later in the day executing my advice, 
though he’d never give me credit for it or ask for the help directly.
Finally, I’d like to point out a stumbling block a lot of PMs hit when they try to 
coach others. If you provide some coaching but the other person doesn’t fol-
low your advice, then what do you do? There are always plenty of reasons why 
someone could choose to ignore your very good advice, such as they haven’t 
been convinced that it’s the best course of action, circumstances changed (at 
least in their minds) and they believe your advice is no longer applicable, or 
frankly your advice sucked. Why someone chooses to ignore your coaching 
doesn’t really matter in the short term. They are responsible for the conse-
quences of their actions and after doing your best to help, you have to let go 

119
Managing Projects in the Real World
and let them succeed or fail on their own merits. This is probably the ­hardest 
part of coaching…letting go. It’s a mistake to constantly go back to your team-
mate and badger them to follow your advice. Can you say micromanager? Of 
course you can!
So that’s my take on coaching from the PM’s perspective. What about yours? 
Have you found solid tactics for coaching the hard cases? What about those 
teammates who need a lot of your time…as in more than you have to spare? 
How do you coach them without completely tanking your own work? Thinking 
about these kinds of questions when you can really focus will tee you up to be 
the best coach possible for your teams, so take some time and get your head 
wrapped around the idea of the PM as a coach.
Cut Off Your Right Hand
I have a colleague who was telling me about her “Right-Hand Man” the other 
day. This is the person she knows she can always go to for those “have-to-
be-done-right-now” kind of things she can’t get to herself. This is the guy she 
leaves in charge of her project team whenever she’s out of the office. In short, 
this is her unofficial “second in command.” On the surface there’s nothing 
wrong with rolling this way and, to tell the truth, I used to operate this way, 
too. You just drift into it, and in a fast-paced, high-pressure environment it’s 
often the path of least resistance whenever you need a backup. However, this 
strategy is killing your team dynamic.
The first problem lies with the message having a “Right Hand” sends to your 
team. You’re basically saying that the “Right Hand Man/Woman” is your favor-
ite. I’d bet my lunch money that you won’t have to think too long or too hard 
to recall a team you were a part of on which you weren’t the “Right Hand”—
and it wasn’t fun. No one likes to feel like they are just one of the worker 
bees, and good leaders know this. That’s why a good leader strives to treat all 
team members equally while making each one feel “special.” You need a team 
of rock stars—not a bunch of roadies and a guy named Elvis. It’s also equally 
uncomfortable to be that “Right Hand” whom the leader obviously defers to. 
No one wants to be the “teacher’s pet,” right?
Now, the second problem having a dedicated “Right Hand” brings is that it 
stifles opportunities for the rest of the team. Here’s what happens: the same 
person, your favorite, gets the opportunity to establish his or her reputation 
by covering for you every time you’re out of the office. No one else every 
gets the chance…oh, and by the way, there’s someone else who really wants 
that opportunity, too. One of the best tools in my PM Toolbox is the ability to 
enable my teammates to do new and challenging work, so I look for opportu-
nities to delegate work that I think my teammates will benefit from. If I only 
ever punt these kinds of opportunities to one person, what kind of message 
does that send to the rest of the team?

Chapter 9 | Leadership Showtime
120
Okay, the third problem I see with this “Right-Hand Man/Woman” strategy is 
that, most of the time, you forget to ask that person if he actually wants to 
assume the extra work. Remember, even an outstanding “Right Hand” will get 
fed up with you if you’re constantly going to that well for water. Just because 
someone is capable of assuming the work doesn’t necessarily make her the 
best candidate for it. Sometimes it makes a lot more sense to ask someone 
less experienced to take care of an urgent task. Sure, you might have to moni-
tor the progress more than if you’d gone straight to your “Right Hand”—but 
in the end you’re building your team’s bench strength and that’s a lot stronger 
than a single person any day.
So let’s recap. If you’re feeling pretty good about your “Right-Hand Man/
Woman,” then it’s probably time to consider an amputation. No one wants 
to work for a leader who plays favorites, doesn’t provide opportunities to 
grow, or dumps on you all the time because you’re the path of least resis-
tance. Seriously, cut off your “Right Hand” and start spreading the love across 
your team. They are going to do a better job than you think, you’ll develop a 
dynamic that’s much more collaborative, and you won’t burn out a valuable 
resource by using it too often. Make sense? Glad I could help!

Decision Making
Decision making is a big part of leading a project or program team. As a leader 
you need to understand the importance of decisive action, the pitfalls of failing 
to decide, and the various decision-making tools out there.
First Step? Make the Decision
In the early days of my career, I had the good fortune to hear Jim Morgan, 
then the CEO of Applied Materials, talk about leadership. Mr. Morgan is a very 
practical leader and I still draw on his points of view when it comes to leader-
ship skills. In fact, my whole take on decision making comes straight from him. 
Here’s his philosophy on decision making in my own words:
Part I: Make the decision. You can always deal with 
the consequences if you make the wrong choice, but you 
will do more harm if you dither around and don’t make a 
definitive decision.
Part II: Decision making is a skill. You need to practice 
that skill to get good at it.
Many times I’ve seen PMs neglect to make the simplest decisions, and when 
that happens the team is stuck like hamsters on their various wheels, spinning 
madly. If you’re the PM, then you’re going to have to make decisions that you 
are uncomfortable making. I’m not talking about those big ethical decisions: 
those are pretty straightforward if you think about them long enough. Instead, 
I mean those decisions where you don’t feel that you have the authority to 
make the call. In our highly ambiguous environment, this happens all the time.
For instance, I once authorized the purchase of some video cards as a backup 
in case the onboard chips didn’t arrive in time to get assembled onto the 
boards. Now, when I say “authorized” what I really mean is that, in the team 
meeting after kicking around mitigation strategies (we were pretty sure the 
chip vendor wasn’t going to come through in time), I made the decision to have 
10
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 10 | Decision Making
122
the materials folks buy those extra video cards. Did I have the explicit authority 
to spend that money? Not really. Okay, in point of fact, my name wasn’t on that 
budget—so no, I did not have the formal authority. This is called risk mitigation 
and it’s something you and your project team should be doing.
So what were the consequences? Well, for starters, no one asked me about 
that unauthorized purchase, because the total dollar amount was so small that 
it just never showed up on anyone’s radar. It seemed like a lot of money to me 
at the time, so I was sure surprised when no one challenged my decision. Go 
figure. The other consequence was that, although we did need about 20% of 
those video cards, the actual on-board video controller chips came in almost 
on time and we ended up scrapping the remaining 80% of the cards. Again, 
due to the low dollar amount, no one seemed to care. In the end, the only 
consequence that mattered was that my customer was happy to only have 
20% of their boards with video cards and there was no impact to the overall 
silicon development program.
So, no negative consequences. Does that mean it was the right decision? I’d say 
yes, because the program was not impacted. If my team had to delay delivery 
of boards because we were waiting on those video chips, then it would have 
affected everyone from Validation to Product Marketing. The money to buy 
the cards was well spent; it minimized the impact of the risk. Would I make 
the same decision again? Absolutely!
The point I’m trying to make here is that you often need to take intelligent 
risks and make decisions so that your team can continue working. In this 
example, if I hadn’t made that decision, then I’m sure we would have been 
discussing that issue over and over again with no real progress. The materials 
person would have been stuck on that proverbial hamster wheel trying to get 
the chip vendor to deliver, all the while believing that he was going to get his 
head handed to him when the vendor failed to follow through. That’s no way 
to enable your team.
Take a few minutes to think about your last team meeting. Did you make clear 
decisions, or just let the team continue on their respective wheels? If you’re 
not sure of the answer, then go ask a few of your teammates. Ask them if they 
know what the decision was and why it was made. This is also a good time to 
double-check your understanding of the team’s level of buy-in for the decision. 
If you find out that your decisions aren’t as clear as you thought, then stay 
tuned for the next bit—Part II if you will. ☺
Now Get Better at It
There’s no denying that project work can be challenging, and PMs must often 
make decisions with incomplete data. No one likes to be put in that position 
and, because it’s highly unlikely that you can change the environment, your best  
bet is to figure out how to make solid decisions with less than optimum data.

123
Managing Projects in the Real World
One good way to get comfortable making decisions in ambiguous environ-
ments is to make more of them. You see, the ability to make good decisions 
is a skill and, as with all skills, you can get better at it with practice. So how 
do you practice making decisions? (Yeah, that sounds stupid even to me, and 
I wrote it!☺)
A technique I’ve had good success with is to keep a log of decisions that I’ve 
made and felt uncomfortable about. I keep this log on the back pages of my 
project notebook, and for each decision I capture why I made the decision I 
did and what data I wished I’d had before making the call. I also capture the 
outcome of—or fall-out from—the decision. Then I grade my decision-making 
ability. Once a week I review my log, add new decisions I made that week, 
and document outcomes of previous decisions. I’m honestly not sure if it was 
the log or just the practice of review that helped, but I definitely noticed an 
improvement in my decision making since keeping a log.
All of that introspection about decisions I’ve made also led me to one of my 
personal best practices. I realized that some of the data I wished I’d had before 
making a call was actually available earlier. I’d just never gone off and acquired 
it. Let me give you an example here. In the previous section, I talked about an 
example in which I authorized a hardware purchase. What I didn’t mention 
was that I’d already had a conversation with the budget owner about what the 
boundary conditions were with respect to spending. This particular manager 
referred to it as his pain point…in short, he didn’t need me to ask permission 
under a certain dollar amount. So, when it came time to make that call to 
authorize spending, I already knew the budget owner would be okay with the 
dollar amount.
The point here is that you need to identify information you could use to make 
better decisions before you need it. Here are a few ideas for data you can 
go after now so that when you are called upon to make decisions you are 
well-armed with data:
Spending constraints. Is the pain point $50,000 or 
• 
$500,000?
Relative priority of your project with respect to the orga-
• 
nization’s project/program portfolio.
Vendor shutdown windows.
• 
Team members’ vacation plans.
• 
Strategic objectives for any functional area represented 
• 
on your project team.

Chapter 10 | Decision Making
124
Well, I hope this has given you some ideas about how to practice making 
decisions and how to get ahead of the curve so that you experience fewer 
decision-making scenarios in which you don’t have enough information. In my 
experience, focusing on this skill has really paid off and I encourage you to give 
it a shot. I still have situations that call for a decision I’m not 100% comfortable 
making, but I do think it happens less frequently these days.
What to Do When You Can’t Make a Decision
What do you do when you need to make a decision and there’s no good 
answer? Do you procrastinate? Do you throw your hands up and push that 
decision off on someone else? Or do you let analysis paralysis suck you into a 
black hole of ambiguity? As a PM, I make critical decisions all the time, both with 
and for my team. Do we engage with a new vendor? Should we cut a PO for 
more brackets? Can we crash the schedule to pull in the customer commit?
By now you know that I think that it’s part of your job responsibility as a PM 
to make decisions. However there are times when no “good” option presents 
itself. Unfortunately, that doesn’t let you off the hook with your team. The 
harder the decision is to make, the more it matters that you make one. So, 
here I give you some strategies to help making those tough decisions easier:
• 
Ask yourself what other data you need to make 
the decision. Often when I find myself unable to make 
a decision, this trick is the ticket. I ask myself what other 
data I need to consider before making this decision. 
Would a review of the order volume trending data help? 
Can the supplier scorecard inform this decision? How 
about a deeper understanding of my customer’s timeline? 
Whatever it is, I force myself to articulate it and then take 
action to go get that data. This strategy also works with 
teams: you broker a discussion about what other data 
needs to be reviewed, assign action items to get said data, 
and then set a date to review and to make a decision. It 
should be noted that often the answer is, “nothing.” By 
that I mean there’s no other data to consider, and I’m 
dithering because I don’t like the options.
• 
Don’t like your options? Start thinking differently. 
This is an effective strategy, but it is harder to implement. 
Step back from the decision and start questioning the 
assumptions baked into the analysis of options. Are you 
assuming that you can’t get more headcount? What would 
happen if you reduced the test coverage? Does the work 

125
Managing Projects in the Real World
have to be done in house? Go back to first principles and 
then consider what risks you can take. In short, host a 
brainstorming session and get your team to really stretch 
their imaginations about what could be possible.
• 
Is fear driving your inability to make that deci-
sion? You’d actually be surprised how often I run across 
this one. Usually the decision maker has a fixed idea in 
his head about ugly things that will happen if the decision 
turns out to be a bad one. Weirdly, most people think 
that they will be walked out…despite plenty of evidence 
to the contrary. Perhaps they’ve worked for a screamer/
vindictive bully/crazy person in the past and have some 
scars. If you’ve experienced such a dysfunctional environ-
ment, it’s common to carry that fear for a long time. I’m 
not trying to make light of these fears, ’cause hey—you 
feel what you feel, right? What I’d like to suggest, though, is 
that if fear of what might happen is holding you back from 
making decisions, then why don’t you spend some time 
really thinking about that? Could it be that you no longer 
work for the crazy person and that fear is unfounded 
now? Here’s a case where a little introspection goes a 
long way.
• 
Push out or delay the decision. This one is tricky 
as you don’t want to just “kick the can down the road,” 
if you know what I mean. It should not be a stall tactic! 
Instead, consider what you and your team might know 
at a later date. Does the decision have to be made right 
now? Would waiting until later to make the decision make 
more sense? I actually use this strategy more often when 
considering test data. If the data isn’t conclusive and the 
decision to kill the effort doesn’t need to be made right 
then, it can make more sense to wait and gather more 
test data.
• 
Pick the least “bad” of your “bad” choices and iter-
ate if necessary. Yep, sometimes you just need to jump 
off the ledge and take an informed risk. Most of the time 
it’s more important to keep things moving forward than 
it is to make the right decision. Here you’re aiming for the 
best decision you can make given the circumstances and 
what you know. Is the only way the team can meet that 
pull-in request to work significant overtime? Is a failure 
to deliver not feasible given the market window? If so,  

Chapter 10 | Decision Making
126
then you’re probably going to have to mandate overtime…
but that doesn’t mean that you can’t revisit your decision 
and do some course correction as things change. The 
trick to making that “bad” choice palatable is monitoring. 
If that decision turns out to be a bad one, recognize it 
quickly and make adjustments. Sure, you don’t want to 
waffle back and forth on an important decision, but you 
also need to keep moving forward. It’s a balance.
• 
Always make a decision. The one thing you definitely 
don’t want to do when faced with a bunch of bad options is  
fail to lead by not making a decision. Don’t kid yourself—not 
making a decision is in fact a decision to do nothing. 
This could result in a work stoppage or slowdown—but, 
worse, it reduces the momentum of the team.
So there you have it: some strategies for making difficult decisions when no 
clear answer presents itself. What about you? What do you do when you are 
faced with this kind of scenario?
Decision-Making Tools
I often have peers ping me to ask for advice or just kick ideas around. I don’t 
mind and it’s often a good opportunity for me to revisit some tried and true 
techniques. Here’s an example. I got a call the other day from a friend of mine 
who wanted to bounce something off me. My friend leads a team that is tasked 
with improving one of their organization’s functional capabilities. One of the 
agenda items for the weekly meeting was to recommend enhancements for a 
software tool. This team is made up of quasi-volunteers, all of whom are pas-
sionate about improving the software tool, and my friend was concerned that 
the meeting would become ratholed on this agenda item.
The team needed to select the best four or five enhancements out of a list of 
about 25 possibilities already identified. My friend’s first instinct was to have 
each team member vote on their “top five” enhancements and then have the 
team discuss the options with the highest number of votes to close on a final 
list for the software developers.
For a project manager, leading a team to make solid decisions is a critical skill, 
but how often do we stop to consider which decision-making process is the 
most efficient? The conversation with my friend got me to thinking about deci-
sion making and I realized that I’m not very good at selecting the best tool 
for the job when it comes to making decisions. I tend to stick to my comfort 
zone and stay with the consultative method most of the time. So, in a continu-
ous improvement mindset, I went off and reminded myself of the most widely 

127
Managing Projects in the Real World
used methods. I humbly present to you the list that now hangs in my cube to 
remind me that there are more tools in the box:
Method
Speed
Commitment
Consultative: Group members are encouraged to  
contribute and discuss ideas, suggestions, and opinions freely. 
The decision maker makes the decision.
Fast
High
Consensus: Discussion continues until everyone’s  
concerns and interests are addressed and incorporated.  
The group makes the decision and all members agree.
Slowest
Highest
Authoritative: The group leader makes the decision and 
announces the decision.
Fastest
Lowest
Voting: Everyone gets a vote. The group majority makes  
the decision.
Fast
Low
As you can see, there are plenty of decision-making tools, each of which 
addresses different concerns. One of these, or a combination of two of them, 
is likely to be the most efficient way to help your particular team make a 
particular decision. As for my friend, she went with a blend of authoritative 
and consultative by opening the agenda topic with her suggested list of the top 
enhancements to recommend, based on some ROI analysis that had already 
been done. This focused the team’s discussion and they were able to quickly 
come up with their top five recommendations and move on to other more 
important agenda items. Ah, there’s nothing like using the right tool to get the 
job done quickly!
How to Select the Best Option
I’ve yet to manage a project where there wasn’t some sort of selection of 
options to make. You know what I’m talking about…select the best candidate 
from a slew of interviewees, pick the best vendor for the marketing campaign, 
decide between two competing designs, pick the best software package to 
use, and so on. If I’m lazy, then I’ll facilitate a team discussion and use the con-
sensus decision-making model. As you know, consensus-based decisions yield 
strongest buy-in from the team, but this method does not always generate 
the best decision, nor does it provide supporting documentation for why the 
decision was made.
To get a better, data-based decision along with strong supporting documenta-
tion, you need selection criteria. Once you have selection criteria, all you and 
your team need to do is evaluate your options against these criteria. Trust me, 
it really is that easy!

Chapter 10 | Decision Making
128
Okay, now let’s talk about those selection criteria. I first understood the 
power of documented selection criteria when I did vendor selection/develop-
ment work at Applied Materials. It’s one of those magic bullets all PMs need 
to understand how to use. Your strategy here is to create a set of selection 
criteria and then create a grading scale that is relevant to the choice your team 
needs to make. After these two things are established, all you’ve got to do is 
the actual evaluation of your options.
To create your selection criteria, you start with the requirements for what-
ever it is you are trying to select. For instance, if the module must fit within 
a 2’ x 1’ x 0.5’ enclosure, then either it does or doesn’t fit. If you have actual, 
quantifiable requirements, those become your selection criteria. Not a lot of 
ambiguity with that, is there? These criteria are pretty cut and dried and most 
teams don’t struggle with determining them. It gets tougher when the require-
ments are qualitative. This is the realm of mushy, relative measures.
If your requirements are not quantifiable (for example, will the candidate fit 
in well with our current team dynamic?), then you need that grading scale. 
To generate the grading scale you basically consider both extremes of the 
criteria. It’s completely up to you what you use for this scale because this will 
be a relative measure, so you can create your scale to best fit your needs. For 
example, if you want to evaluate/grade a vendor’s maturity with respect to 
product quality, then your grading scale might look something like this:
Grade/Score
Observation
1
The vendor couldn’t spell the word “quality” while holding a dictionary.
2
The vendor uses final inspection of outgoing parts as the sole monitoring 
and control process.
3
The vendor has documented monitoring and control processes, but 
compliance appears to be sporadic.
4
The vendor has documented monitoring and control processes in place 
with supporting evidence that these processes are closely followed 
throughout the manufacturing process.
The thing to realize here is that what scale you use doesn’t really matter. I just 
made that table up off the top of my head and it’s perfectly usable as is. This 
is a relative measure, so as long as all options are evaluated against the same 
scale, then you’re good to go. In fact, I usually develop the scale in a way that 
makes sense to me and then get the team’s buy-off before we use it. Don’t 
make this harder than it has to be. You should be able to come up with selec-
tion criteria and a grading scale for most decisions in thirty minutes or less. 
(Obviously, the more important the selection, the more time you should take 
in generating the criteria and scale.)

129
Managing Projects in the Real World
What’s important to realize is that you are evaluating the options relative to 
each other against the selection criteria. What I mean is that all your team 
needs to determine is whether Candidate A will fit into the team better than 
Candidate B or vice versa. Exactly what a score of “4” means matters little as 
long as each option is scored on the same scale with the same criteria.
Tip
■
■
  On any numbered grading scale, you want an even number of scores. If you use an odd 
number of scores, then it’s highly likely you will end up with the majority of the scores the same, as 
people tend to pick the middle score when in doubt. Using an even number of scores forces everyone 
to make a choice about how that option scores relative to each other. Make sense?
So, the next time you and your team need to select among multiple options, 
create some selection criteria and a grading scale. In the real world, you will 
probably have a good mix of quantifiable and qualitative criteria. The quantifi-
able criteria are either “thumbs up” or “thumbs down”—so don’t count those 
in an overall score. Of course, there are evaluations your team needs to do 
that require a lot more rigor and that’s just fine. For those everyday selections, 
however, use this structured approach. Not only will the team make quicker 
decisions, but they’ll also make better ones and you will have documented 
why the decision was made for future reference. Now, obviously, I’ve made 
this sound pretty simple, and that’s because for most things you need it for, it 
is that simple. I think sometimes we make things harder than they have to be 
and get mired in analysis paralysis. So don’t go there—just circumvent that 
quagmire and bust out some selection criteria! Trust me, your team’s gonna 
thank you when they see how quickly a decision is reached.
Prioritize This!
Whenever I get stupid busy, I know one of my surefire techniques to manage 
the chaos is to get ruthless with prioritization. It’s interesting to me that while 
people understand the concept of prioritization, most don’t actively employ 
this strategy. Instead we all too often let urgent items take precedence over 
important items and end up frantically turnin’ and burnin’, while accomplishing 
very little.
Over the years I’ve figured out that for prioritization to be a real and meaning-
ful tool, I need to wield it ruthlessly. The sad fact is that many times it’s just 
not possible to get everything on my To-Do list done, and I need to get smart 
about what I work on. So in the interests of sharing, here’s how I prioritize:
The first pass is to assign a relative priority to the big things. Here’s where 
you need to decide the relative importance of whatever it is you’re trying to 
achieve. For instance, if you’re planning to drive to Grandmother’s house for 

Chapter 10 | Decision Making
130
Thanksgiving, then perhaps tuning up the car is more important than cleaning 
your house. Actually getting to Grandmother’s house has a higher priority 
than picking up your dirty socks, which can wait until you’re home again. So, 
of all the things you have on your plate, which is the most important? Notice 
that I did not say, which is the most “urgent”… we’ll get to that later.
After you have a clear picture of the relative priority of the big objectives, if 
you will, then it’s time to break down those smaller tasks that contribute to 
said big objectives. Here’s the point where most people dump out a list of tasks 
and start knocking ’em off. That’s okay but you’re still gonna feel like you’re 
staring down a runaway train…in the dark…in a tunnel. I bet I’m not the only 
one who’s felt like that! What you want to do with your list is pick it apart one 
more time and prioritize it by breaking it into three categories: what must be 
done, what should be done, and what you’ll do if you have extra time. Now you 
should have a short list of tasks that support your highest-priority objective 
that must be done. If you can do nothing but the items on this list, then it will 
at least make sure that you physically get to Grandmother’s house.
Okay, now let’s talk about urgency. Not everything that’s urgent is important 
to do. On any given day I have a couple of deliverables or tasks to complete 
that are time-sensitive, but they may or may not support my highest priori-
ties. In general, I try to organize my work so that no one is waiting on me for 
a deliverable, so that I don’t have to deal with a last-minute fire drill to get 
something completed. I’m a PM, so I’m hyper-organized and I actually plan to 
do work so that I finish deliverables before they are due. It’s this proactive 
approach that allows me to avoid that last-minute rush to finish something by 
5 PM on the day before Thanksgiving. You may not be into that much organi-
zation or you may love the pressure of a deadline, and that’s cool. The thing to 
keep in mind however is the relative priority of whatever task you’re working 
on regardless of its urgency.
Now there’s one other place where prioritization is a PM’s best friend, and 
that’s whenever you’re managing multiple projects. At any given time, I have 
a rotating list of the projects I’m working on, with the top priority going to 
whichever project is at the top of that list. I’ve found over the years that as 
long as I have a clear order of priority, then I can make good tradeoff decisions 
between projects. If I’m at all unclear about the order of projects then I go 
ask for a priority call. I’ve found that I frequently have to drag that elephant 
out from under the rug kicking and screaming because, let’s face it— my boss 
would prefer that all of the projects be the highest priority. That’s just not 
realistic, is it? Right now, I’m actively managing five projects with overlapping 
team members. I need to make it clear to everyone which project gets the 
top priority slot, and I need to manage the morale and expectations of each 
team differently depending on which project they are working on. This isn’t as 
easy as it sounds, and sometimes I write down the list on my whiteboard so 
everyone knows which way is up. I see it as part of my job responsibilities to 
manage the prioritization of work among the various projects.

Presenting 
Project Updates
Another critical skill for PMs to have is the ability to condense everything 
that’s happening on a project at any given time into a concise update. You 
see, PMs communicate project status updates all the time, and about half of 
those updates are delivered verbally to a live audience. You need to be able 
to morph your message depending on your audience. Exactly what data and 
to what level of detail you present needs to be tailored to whomever it is 
that receives this information. It needs to be relevant and actionable to each 
person, and that’s a bit of a challenge for PMs.
Stop Sharing Too Much Information
To start off with, let’s talk about just how much information you should share. 
I’ve being grilled, flambéed, and skewered with the best of ’em over infor-
mation I voluntarily provided. Information is kinda like the smoke from the 
genie’s bottle. Once it starts slipping out, there’s no stopping it, and once that 
particular genie is out of the bottle either your most fervent wish is granted 
or bad things happen despite your good intentions. Now I’m not advocating 
deceiving your stakeholders, but I do believe you should be very careful about 
what information you do share. How you determine what and how much 
information to share is situational and, frankly, a matter of experience. This 
is the kind of thing you learn as a result of making the wrong choices, so I 
thought I’d share my take on when and what to share.
First, let’s start with the information you should always share. Changes to 
committed dates must always be disclosed, even if it’s bad…especially if it’s 
bad! This is a matter of integrity, since you’ve essentially given your word that 
11
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 11 | Presenting Project Updates
132
the team can deliver to a specific date. Nothing less than complete honesty 
is acceptable; just make sure you have a recovery plan to share when the 
news is bad. Further, changes to the execution strategy that could affect the 
customer should be shared. If your team decides to drop a particular test 
to accelerate the timeline, then the customer probably cares and needs to 
know. Conversely, if your team decides to use a different software package 
to develop the code, then the customer probably doesn’t care and there’s no 
need to disclose this. Essentially any information that could be actionable to 
the customer should be shared.
Likewise, any information that does not inspire action on the customer’s part 
should be withheld. Ask yourself what the customer will do with this particu-
lar information. If the answer is “nothing,” then consider not bringing it up. 
PMs often provide their stakeholders with updates to tasks that are not on 
the critical path. There’s nothing inherently wrong with this, but consider that 
the stakeholder probably doesn’t care. Yes, friends, that’s the harsh reality…
they don’t care! My customers frankly couldn’t care less if I get the assem-
bly instructions done on time because all they care about is whether or not 
manufacturing can deliver consistently. I have to care about those documents; 
they don’t.
In fact, the percentage of work your team is doing that your stakeholders 
actually care about is surprisingly minimal. What the stakeholders really care 
about is whether or not your team is on track to the commits and the final 
quality of their deliverable. The stakeholders are expecting you, as the PM, to 
care about and manage the details. It’s your job to ensure all of those day-to-
day things turn out right and do not affect the final deliverable. One mistake 
I often see PMs making is to disclose this level of detail to the stakeholders. 
Consider this: When you tell your stakeholders that the team is behind on 
finishing the CAD work for the chassis assembly, what you are really saying is 
that the team is behind schedule. Your stakeholder hears that you’re behind 
schedule and the implication is that this schedule slip will affect the committed 
delivery date. Now you and I know that that impression is most likely false. 
Let’s say, for argument’s sake, that this type of thing happens multiple times 
throughout the life of the project. When you continually give your stakehold-
ers the impression that the work is out of control, you lose credibility. Once 
you lose credibility, it’s really hard to influence those stakeholders and any 
negotiation becomes rather painful. In short, because you disclosed a bunch 
of information that’s not actionable by the stakeholder, you’ve lost their con-
fidence and, trust me, they will monitor your every breath going forward.  
If you’re anything like me, then you’ve been in this situation before and know 
it sucks.

133
Managing Projects in the Real World
Finally, I should make a few comments about spinning your message. News 
flash: You are not an ad agency! Don’t put unnecessary spin on a status 
update. Don’t try to obscure the true meaning or hide a looming problem. 
That’s just plain unethical and it’s a kissin’ cousin to a flat-out lie. Don’t do it! 
On the other hand, you do need to make sure that your message is communi-
cated at the correct level of complexity. Keep status updates to those outside 
your immediate team succinct and to the point. Remember that your message 
needs to be actionable to the stakeholders. Don’t add so much detail that the 
person being communicated to has to spend an hour deciphering the mes-
sage to figure out what actions to take. If the project is on track, then just say 
so. If you’re trending two weeks late, state that and then follow up with your 
recovery plan and potential impacts to other stakeholders. Last, where at all 
possible, use quantitative data. It will lend instant credibility to your message.
I hope this sparks some thoughts on how to improve your stakeholder  
communication. It’s pretty easy to share more information than is good for 
your team or your stakeholders. We’re all busy these days, so don’t make  
your stakeholders work for it when they get your status updates. Keep ’em 
short and sweet and, above all else, factual.
How to Build a Presentation
Project managers have to pull together presentations all the time, and how 
good you are at building a slide deck can make or break your reputation. 
Further, PMs are often called upon to generate a slide, or ten, for someone 
else such as a boss or a key stakeholder. To make it even more challenging, 
those key stakeholders frequently don’t know what they want and rely on 
the PM to figure out what the key messages should be. We’ve all been there: 
the Big Kahuna says something like, “Hey Mel, give me a coupla slides on that 
project so I can add ’em to my quarterly review with Finance on Friday.” Gee, 
would that be the project that’s currently trending four weeks behind or the 
one that’s trending two weeks early? Oh, and would you like me to create a 
one-page summary for the project, or do you want the nitty-gritty details of 
our schedule slip? Wait! I know, you want the budget breakdown, including 
that whopping NRE we just paid to that outside design house right?
Yeah, I know your pain and I too have spent long, late hours trying to shoe-
horn data into a PowerPoint-friendly format. Over the years, I’ve become 
much more disciplined about how I go about developing a presentation and 
the key for me is to follow a systematic process. (This process also helps those  
wily stakeholders figure out what it is they want to see in the resultant slides!)

I walk you through Melanie’s 10-Step Process for Designing a Presen­
tation in PowerPoint for a sample training session:
1.	 What’s the topic? For this example, I’m using material I 
prepared for a training session I gave to some of my peers 
on the topic, “How to Say No.”
2.	 Who’s the audience? Practicing PMs, located in the Western 
hemisphere for the most part. This material could also be 
reused for the Eastern region.
a.	
Who are the decision makers? No one in this case; this 
is a knowledge-sharing session only.
b.	 Does anyone in the audience have a particular ax to grind 
over this topic? Not that I know of for this topic and 
this audience.
c.	 Why would the audience care about this topic? All are 
involved in stakeholder management and executing 
change control for their projects, where the need to 
say no politically arises.
d.	 Any observations from previous experience with this 
­audience? They like real-world examples, so use good 
stories for the key points.
3.	 Refine the topic based on the audience. “How to say no 
while still maintaining good relations with stakeholders.”
4.	 What are the three key points you want to make? (State 
them at the beginning and reiterate them at the end of 
the presentation.)
a.	
Just because they ask, doesn’t mean you have to say yes
b.	 Say yes to say no.
c.	 If you have to say no, don’t beat around the bush and 
don’t back down.
5.	 What images will you need for this material?
a.	
Screenshot.
b.	 Woman with laptop, perhaps images of the code of 
conduct, money representing bribery, and so on.
c.	 Delaminated bus bars.
d.	 ???

135
Managing Projects in the Real World
6.	 How long do you have to talk? 20-30 minutes => six ­content 
slides + fluff (agenda, intro, Q&A, and so on).
7.	 What presentation style are you going to employ? This will 
be part talk, part knowledge-share.
a.	
What time of day are you presenting? Late afternoon, so 
I need to have plenty of energy and end early.
b.	 What tone or style are you going to use? I want to use 
a friendly tone with a conversational style. Do not 
use an overly businesslike tone for this forum, which 
would come across as a lecture instead of opening up 
the topic for discussion.
8.	 Can you reuse slides from other presentations? Yes, most of 
the “fluff” slides can come from an earlier talk to this 
forum.
9.	 Where did you get your data? Is there anyone you need to 
acknowledge? No, this is all my original content, but I may 
end up using some photos from the corporate database 
and those will need to be attributed.
10.	 What contact info will you provide? My Intel e-mail only.
There you have it, my own 10-step program! ☺ Again, the key for me is to 
follow a systematic process that forces me to clarify and refine what it is I’m 
going to talk about. Hope this is useful to you on your next presentation.
The Big Bad Presentation
Have you ever felt like the main entrée at a backyard barbeque? You know 
what I mean, you’re presenting some rather unpleasant project status and the 
questions are coming fast and furiously from what closely resembles a pack of 
hungry hyena. Yeah, I’ve been there and I definitely have the scars to prove it. 
I don’t have the T-shirt though, as they don’t give ’em out to the roast pig at a 
luau, now do they?
Delivering presentations when the message is bad, ugly, and undeniable is a big 
challenge for project managers. Sadly, I see a lot of PMs who never figure out 
how to deliver this kind of message and not get cooked. In the sadder cases, 
the PM starts spinning the data and adopts a deliberately vague delivery in the 
hopes that no one will notice that the things have gone from slightly troubling 
to an out-of-control forest fire.
I wish I could say that I’ve never done that, but I’m pretty sure I did in the 
early days, before I figured it out. It’s taken a while and more than one flaming

presentation, but I finally came up with some strategies for handling these situ-
ations. In fact, I now look at delivering bad or controversial information as a 
challenge. So, without further ado, here are Melanie’s Tips for a Successful 
BBQ aka “The Big Presentation” aka “How to Avoid Becoming the 
Anthropologist in the Pot”:
Before the meeting, meet with all of your stakeholders 
• 
and make sure they support the content you intend to 
present. Remember, no surprises!
Do your homework and figure out who the decision 
• 
maker is and what’s important to her before you have to 
stand up and present.
Fake it till you make it—otherwise known as show some 
• 
confidence! You are the only person in that meeting with 
the in-depth understanding of what’s going on with the 
project. Act like it!
Never shade, spin, or otherwise distort the facts. The 
• 
truth can’t hurt you anymore than it already has, and 
integrity will go further with your audience than a cheap 
song and dance.
Don’t fan the flames if the discussion turns aggressive. 
• 
Remain calm and in control. Trust me, your professional-
ism and emotional maturity make the other person look 
childish and silly. Take the higher ground and you will 
come out on top, even if you lose that particular point.
Never, never, never blame your team members or their 
• 
respective organizations when things go wrong. Stick to 
the facts and present the data in such a way that the 
decision maker can act on it. Throwing someone under 
the proverbial bus doesn’t help your cause and will defi-
nitely make it infinitely harder to motivate the team in 
the future.
Answer all questions with authority and confidence. If the 
• 
hyenas smell your fear or doubt, they will fall on you like 
a wobbly gazelle.
It’s okay to answer a question with, “I don’t have an answer 
• 
for you on that, but I’ll follow up on it and get back to you 
by….” Don’t punt and try to make it up as you go along—this  
will only make the situation worse.

137
Managing Projects in the Real World
If it’s a virtual meeting, stand up to sound more author-
• 
itative. I don’t understand why this works, but it does. 
I’m also prone to pacing around my cube and waving my 
hands, and I think the energy and emotion come through 
in my voice.
I’d be lying if I told you that I never have tough presentations anymore, and I 
definitely still get BBQ’d once in a while. That’s part of the job and as long as I 
learn something I’m cool with that. These days it does happen less frequently. 
I believe that’s because I’ve become much more deliberate in my preparation 
for these events and I’ve just plain gotten better at it.
Stop Wasting Your Crisis
Have you heard the saying: “A crisis is a terrible thing to waste”? I hadn’t heard 
that particular spin on “… a terrible thing to waste” until one morning driving 
to work. Listening to the radio, I heard a gentleman being interviewed about 
the recovery efforts in Haiti, and that one phrase seemed to jump out at me.
It’s always tricky to present out negative project status, and if the news is really 
bad—that you’re in a crisis—the presentation of status can be like walking 
through a minefield. When PMs are pulling this kind of presentation together, 
there’s a tremendous focus on presenting the situation as accurately as pos-
sible along with realistic action plans. The objective is to give the impression 
that the crisis is well understood and that things are now in control… always 
assuming that they are in control, that is! ☺ The last thing a PM wants is addi-
tional scrutiny that masquerades as “help.”
One thing I have learned, though, is that this is the best time to ask for help. 
Yep, when everything is in meltdown mode, you can score some assistance 
that moves the project forward. The trick to asking for this help is to make 
sure it’s realistic. Too often, I see PMs “asking” for unreasonable amounts of 
extra headcount or schedule pushes that are outside the realm of customer 
acceptance. If I present out that my project is four weeks behind schedule and 
to get back on track I need an additional five heads, then I’m pretty clueless 
about how the org really works. I think there’s this tendency of PMs to think 
that if they put out that kind of request, even knowing it won’t be fulfilled, they 
will have their get-out-of-jail-free card when the project eventually fails. They 
can later say, “See, I told you I needed those extra heads and because I didn’t 
get them, the project failed. It’s not my fault. It’s management’s!” Unfortunately, 
the world is never this simple, and the PM will long be known for the failed 
project and not for the ignored request for more headcount. That’s just the 
way it is, folks!

Chapter 11 | Presenting Project Updates
138
Okay, so what do I mean by realistic requests for help? First, consider who the 
decision maker is in the forum you’re presenting to. Does she have the posi-
tional and influential power to give you five additional heads? Probably not. 
So consider what she can deliver. My direct manager can enable some things 
for my project, his manager a bit more, and eventually that head of engineer-
ing can deliver some real assistance if the request is carefully thought out. It 
should be noted that even the head of engineering probably lacks the ability 
to hire five new people and put them on your project . . . if she could, then it 
would have already happened!
The second thing to consider is what to ask for. Once you understand the 
budget and authority of the decision maker, you can start to look for spe-
cific help the team needs. To give you a feel for what I mean, here are a few 
examples of help I’ve successfully requested in the past:
• 
An extra label printer for a pilot production line. 
The team was always jockeying for time to use the label 
printer, so I asked for another one. This request was filled 
primarily because it was within the budget constraints of 
the decision maker, and although it wasn’t as good as get-
ting five additional heads it did help speed things up.
• 
An SME to help with troubleshooting. The primary 
reason this help was enabled was because I requested 
a specific SME for specific amount of time to help with 
very specific tasks. I was able to get the SME’s time repri-
oritized to help the team find the root cause of the boot 
failure issue that was killing our schedule performance.
• 
A dedicated reliability engineer, embedded with 
the team. In this example, the reliability requirements 
were becoming a significant burden on the develop-
ment team. By asking for and getting a reliability engineer 
embedded in the team, we were able to complete the 
reliability testing and the subsequent report much faster 
than if the team had had to do it themselves.
One last point to consider is that everyone wants to be part of the ­solution, 
including management. By giving management something to do, you are enabling 
them to actually help your project team. Ask for something realistic and you 
will walk away with real assistance for your team. Ask for five additional heads 
and not only will you be disappointed (okay, you probably didn’t expect them 
anyway, right?) but you will feed your team’s frustration by sending the mes-
sage that upper management isn’t paying attention to their issues. And that 
get-out-of-jail-free card? Well, that’s just fool’s gold, if you ask me. Capitalize 
on your next crisis by asking for specific, realistic help while presenting your 
project’s status.

Managing Projects in the Real World
Giving a Talk
As a PM, when you are asked to deliver a talk, it’s tremendously flattering since 
you’re really being asked to provide the equivalent of an op-ed piece. More 
often than not, the topic will be something to do with the practice of manag-
ing projects (hey, you are an expert after all!) or a specific project, program, 
or product. I don’t often do talks. Sure, I present all the time and I think I’m 
pretty good at it, but a talk is something different altogether. A presentation 
is all about conveying data and the outcomes are decisions and actions. This 
is the verbal equivalent of technical writing. When you deliver a talk, you 
and your material need to be entertaining—something more akin to writing  
fiction. The audience is very different, too. I’m not really looking for belly laughs 
when I present a project status…that’s never a good sign! When I’m doing a 
talk, I’m actively trying to evoke that response. So, obviously it behooves all 
project managers to understand the difference between these two styles and 
how to be successful at both.
In 2010 I was asked to deliver a talk at the Intel IT PM Learning Forum about 
soft skills. I immediately said yes (duh!) and only later realized that a good 
talk is not something you can whip out in an hour or two—which is what I 
usually do for a presentation. Needless to say, I hadn’t factored that into my 
acceptance and found myself scrambling like mad to pull a quality talk together 
in a few days.
I knew I had enough material to generate a respectable talk, but it turned out 
to be harder than I’d thought. For one thing, soft skills is a very broad area and, 
frankly, we’ve all heard most of these theories at one time or another. Let’s 
face it, there’s not a lot of new material here, and I was determined to give 
my audience something that justified their time. I decided to limit my talk to 
a few areas and only focus on the practical applications of soft skills. My main 
point was that this stuff will work for you if you are strategic and deliberate 
about how you use it.
To liven up the talk I had a couple of stories for each area. I told the story 
about literally sitting on my hands while meeting with a second-level manager 
who was an analytical. He thought I’d completely turned my project around 
just because I changed my communication style. Go figure. I spun a great yarn 
about how I’d managed my primary stakeholder in the epic Validation versus 
Platform Engineering wars. In all honesty, I think these stories made the talk, 
probably because they were all true and they demonstrated how to utilize 
soft skills in project management.
The other challenge I had to tackle was the visual material. When you give a 
presentation, the slide content is critical and the challenge is how to condense 
the data. In a perfect world, a fantastic talk would need no slides because the 
speaker could see and engage with the audience on a personal level. In my 
reality, I couldn’t see how a virtual audience was going to be motivated to  

Chapter 11 | Presenting Project Updates
140
follow along while looking at a blank monitor . . . okay, truly? I didn’t think I’d 
hold anyone’s attention without some visual aids to compete with surfing the 
web during my talk. As I designed the slides, I deliberately kept the slide con-
tent to a minimum while writing a great deal of info in the speaker’s notes sec-
tion. I felt that this provided the visual aid to help people follow along, as well 
as providing context should they want to review the material at a later date.
Last, I practiced that sucker until I could do it blindfolded and hanging upside 
down. It should be noted that I do practice for big presentations, but never 
this much. This was probably about 50% of my preparation. There were three 
talks at various times to accommodate the global audience, and I knew I’d 
need to be really prepared to deliver the early talk and the late night one. 
I’m not really a night owl and I was dreading trying to sound coherent while 
falling asleep! I practiced the talk until I could do it with only a few sneak 
peeks at the slides. I practiced several stories for each slide so that I could 
apply whichever one fit any questions and so that each audience got a little 
something different.
All that preparation paid off and I think the talks went well. The audiences 
had great questions and seemed to enjoy the material. I learned quite a bit 
about how to deliver a talk versus a presentation. So if you’re ever asked to 
do a talk, definitely say yes—but be sure you have enough time to prepare… 
and practice a lot!
And Now for Something Insane
I was one of five speakers using the Ignite style of presentation to talk about 
collaboration at a Women at Intel Network (WIN) conference. In case you 
haven’t heard about this whole Ignite phenomenon, let me break it down for 
you. Each speaker has a measly five minutes to make their argument and only 
20 slides to support it. The catch is that each slide auto-advances every 15 
seconds; there’s no animation or builds, and text doesn’t really work because 
the slides change so fast. Trust me, this is like nothing you’ve ever seen or 
done, and it’s way outside your comfort zone when you’re up on stage doing 
it for the first time.
The topic I’d planned to talk about was one near and dear to my blogger’s 
heart: collaboration through blogging. I felt like I had a good story to tell and 
I certainly had passion for the topic. It became obvious to me that that pas-
sion was the key to success as I worked through designing the slides and then 
crafting the delivery.
The design of the slides was my first task, and it turned out to be both 
harder and more fulfilling than I’d originally thought. Because this was clearly 
going to be a much more visual talk than I’d done in the past, I figured that I 
needed to up-level my game when it came to the slides. I basically followed 

141
Managing Projects in the Real World
the methodology outlined by Nancy Duarte, in her book slide:ology.1 Yes, I 
really did follow this process pretty faithfully. It took hours, but the results 
were amazing!
I spent a solid four hours mind-mapping, brainstorming, sketching, playing 
word-association games, and so on to come up with content ideas. I did not 
start with an outline as I normally would. Much to my surprise, this idea-
generation process yielded what would become the core of the talk, and it 
was really good content! (For the PMs in da house, this was the proof-of-
concept—POC—or scoping activity.) For instance, when I was analyzing the 
likely audience, I realized that one of the reasons people would be interested 
in my story was the amazing career-advancement opportunities I’ve enjoyed 
as a result of my Intel blog. This wasn’t in the original plan for the talk, but this 
concept clearly had to be included. The idea-generation process was so pro-
lific that I had a tough time culling them into just 20 discrete ideas/slides. Heck, 
even the stuff that didn’t make it into the final revision was good…real good.
Once I’d settled on the ideas and content for each slide, I had to come up with 
the appropriate visuals. (PM translation: “Execution Phase.”) As part of the 
idea-generation process, I’d developed a couple of ideas for each slide, so I had 
a punch list of images I needed to create. To be honest, I tried my hand first at 
finding Creative Commons licensed images but didn’t have a lot of luck. Since 
time was slipping away like sands through the hourglass, I decided to just take 
the photos I needed myself. I used my trusty iPhone, kept the images simple, 
and used what I had around the house for the most part. To change things up 
a bit, I used a couple of screenshots of viewership metrics from the blog to 
add credibility, one diagram inspired by Duarte’s Chapter 3, and only one text 
slide. In the end, I think I spent about six to seven hours developing the slides, 
and what gorgeous slides they were!
Once I’d locked down the slides, the order in which they would flow, and a 
key point or two I’d make for each one, I was ready to move on to the next 
phase: practicing the talk. (Okay, PMs, say it with me: “Testing Phase!”) The 
absolute hardest part of an Ignite talk is mastering the timing. It goes by so fast 
that if you get off your pace you have very little chance of catching up before 
the end of your allotted five minutes. Oh, and you can’t really memorize your 
material because you’ve got a tight timeline and you have to react to/antici-
pate reactions from the audience. To start with, I ran through this talk enough 
times that I’d memorized the order and the key point I wanted to make with 
each slide. Next, I used the animation feature in PowerPoint to practice with 
1Nancy Duarte. slide:ology: The Art and Science of Creating Great Presentations. (Sebastopol, CA: 
O’Reilly Media Inc., 2008.)

Chapter 11 | Presenting Project Updates
142
the strict 15 seconds per slide timing. This was the hardest and most time-
consuming part of the whole process. Next, I practiced blending the points 
across slides so that I could change my pace on the fly. I spent a lot of time 
practicing as you’d expect, and I ended up putting something like 10 hours into 
this part of the process.
The culmination of all of this effort was the talk on the day of the conference. 
I’m told I did a credible job, but to be honest I don’t remember a word I said. 
Oh, I can definitely tell you what points I made, what analogies I probably used; 
heck, I can even recite whole bits of dialogue because I practiced it so much…
but I don’t remember a darn thing about being on stage! LOL! Yep, it’s true, it 
was a blur. Far from the euphoria I expected I’d feel when it was done, all I felt 
was exhaustion. I’d set myself a goal to significantly improve my presentation 
style and public speaking skills. Little did I realize, that the WIN conference 
would be a huge “opportunity to excel,” as a former colleague used to say. All 
told I put about 20 hours into this effort and I learned an incredible amount. 
I’ve definitely improved my presenting and public speaking skills, but I know 
that there’s always more to learn, so I’m not done yet!
Standin’ on My Soapbox: PowerPoint
I once ran across an article by Elisabeth Bumiller talking about how the mili-
tary struggles with what I’ll call the PowerPoint Effect in communication.2 This is 
what happens when the generation of the PPT becomes more important than 
the information it’s meant to convey. It’s not clear exactly when the format of 
the slides becomes the most important part of the data; you just know that’s 
what’s happened when you hit hour four of preparing the presentation. I’m 
sure most of us have experienced that moment of utter frustration when you 
realize that what you have to say is less important than the pretty picture in 
the slide.
The article talks about military PPT presentations to the news media called 
“hypnotizing chickens,” the intent of which is to convey as little information 
as possible. At first I laughed at the clever turn of phrase, but then I recalled 
an operations review I attended regularly a few years ago. This ops review 
worked pretty much like they all do, and I often presented on project status in 
this forum. One of the things I quickly noticed was that while I was allocated 
about 30 minutes to present, in actuality I got five minutes at the end of a two-
hour meeting to talk. The other thing I figured out was that those chickens 
were definitely hypnotized by the time I presented at the end of the meeting.

Managing Projects in the Real World
The teams ahead of me on the agenda had upwards of 20 slides, all jam-packed 
with data. The kicker was that for the most part all of the slides had the same 
format, so it made it really challenging to discern what was different as each 
slide made its appearance. Further, when things weren’t on track, I noticed 
that it was popular among the slide preparers to “adjust” the plan of record 
(POR) date to match the trend dates. Yep, according to those slides every 
major milestone was dead on track to the POR all the time. But wait, that’s 
not the shocking part…the shocking part is that no one was ever called on it! 
That’s right, the audience was completely hypnotized! Crazy, huh?
Another point Bumiller’s article makes is that not every idea or point can be 
“bulletized” and, in fact, complex concepts need more discussion and expla-
nation than is practical with PowerPoint. I know I’ve spent many hours over 
the years struggling with conveying complex scenarios and their subsequent 
outcomes within a PPT slide. Large amounts of numerical data do not lend 
themselves to a single slide and indeed usually convey no information if placed 
within a PPT, since the audience can’t really read and digest that volume of 
data in such a constrained format. Despite its constraints, every day someone 
is shoehorning data into a PPT slide because we think that’s the only way to 
communicate in a meeting.
My team meetings do not generally involve PowerPoint presentations. It’s not 
as though I woke up one day and decided to ban PowerPoint. Rather, it was 
a gradual realization that we didn’t need them. In my weekly project meeting, 
each team member verbally discusses what they’ve been up to for the previ-
ous week and any challenges or help needed. I take notes while they talk and 
then distribute the notes after the meeting. Sure, we could use slides, but then 
someone would have to create them, upload them to the project repository, 
and at the end of the project archive them . . . .sounds exhausting doesn’t it?  
To be fair, we do utilize PPTs when needed, but no one feels obligated to 
produce a weekly slide.
That feeling of obligation drives a lot of slides, in my opinion. I think this is 
partly due to the fact that we’ve become so accustomed to using slides that 
we just assume they are needed. Often the only reason we make the slides is 
because we think we have to. If you want to avoid hypnotizing the chickens, 
then you need to concentrate on using PowerPoint as a backup communica-
tion tool rather than the primary source of data.
More talk—fewer slides!

Stakeholder 
Management in 
the Real World
You know, this would be an awesome job except for those pesky stakehold-
ers! If you ask me, managing stakeholder expectations is the hardest part of 
project management, and every PM I know struggles with this from time to 
time. The good news is that there’s a lot you can do to improve your skills in 
this area. Simply having a well-thought-out plan and applying deliberate strate-
gies to each stakeholder can greatly increase your effectiveness. Chapter 1 
talked about how to determine who your stakeholders are and their relative 
importance. This chapter talks about what to do with them!
Have a Plan
It is common for junior project managers to manage their stakeholder expec-
tations in an ad hoc manner. Sure, they are careful to be friendly and informa-
tive when the stakeholders are encountered, but there’s little deliberation or 
strategy employed in the overall management of these critical relationships. 
If this project manager is personable and reasonably adept at the soft skills, 
then this method will work just fine for smaller projects. Where the ad hoc 
method falls short is with difficult stakeholders, highly matrixed organizations, 
and large projects. Here the results of insufficient stakeholder management 
closely resemble a toddler pageant complete with prima donna parents, indif-
ferent judges, and crying kids. The project manager’s reputation is diminished, 
12

the team is constantly frustrated with “bring-me-a-rock” exercises, and the 
overall scope of the project is inflated.
The good news is that all of this drama can be averted with a couple hours of 
planning. Creating a stakeholder management plan is fairly straightforward and 
can be accomplished with a simple spreadsheet. The key here is to come up 
with a specific plan for managing all of the stakeholders on your project. If you 
leave this thing to chance or circumstance, you will find yourself right back at 
that toddler pageant.
The first step then is to systematically identify and categorize all of the stake-
holders on your project by using a handy-dandy spreadsheet that you gener-
ate using Melanie’s Stakeholder Identification Method revealed in Chapter 1. Now 
that you understand who your stakeholders are, you can easily craft a strategy 
for managing their expectations. Decide how often and via what format you 
will communicate with each stakeholder. It helps here to break them into cat-
egories based on how you communicate with them. If this sounds suspiciously 
like a communication plan, that’s because it is! Once you’ve determined when 
and how you will communicate with your stakeholders, you need to automate. 
Use your current calendaring or task-tracking system to set up reminders for 
yourself to contact the various categories of stakeholders. These reminders 
can be something as simple as, “Invite Melanie for coffee and give her an infor-
mal update on the project. Make sure to ask her about her overall satisfaction 
with the team’s progress.” This part doesn’t have to be complex or overly 
managed; it just needs to be intentional. Once you have those automated 
reminders in place, all you need to do is act on them. You still need to employ 
your networking skills, but the automated reminders make sure that you have 
a consistent, focused, and deliberate strategy for managing each of your key 
stakeholders.
Networking for Fun and Profit
Okay, now that those reminders are popping up on your calendar, what do 
you do about them? The good news is that stakeholder management and 
maintaining your professional network are basically the same thing. As with 
any new contact in your professional network, you need to start by under-
standing the other person. What’s important to them and why? What’s their 
pain threshold when it comes to schedule, scope, and resources? What type 
of communicator are they? All of these are questions you need to think about 
when determining how best to engage with your stakeholder.
Once you understand who your stakeholders are, have a plan to manage 
their expectations, and have automated the process so that it happens at a 
repeatable cadence, it’s time to think about how to engage with them. By far 
the most effective way to build a relationship is to break bread with the other 

147
Managing Projects in the Real World
person. Invite your key stakeholders for coffee, lunch, or drinks, and start off 
on a friendly note. There’s just something about breaking bread together that 
creates an environment conducive to meeting the other person halfway. At 
first you might talk about your differences and hash out collaborative solu-
tions. Later, you begin strategizing on issues affecting the project or program 
in general. As time goes on and the professional relationship strengthens, you 
will start using each other as sounding boards for other work challenges. 
Years later, I still meet with many of my old stakeholders for lunch or drinks 
every few months. They’ve become members of my professional network and 
I never hesitate to reach out to them for help or to provide help in turn.
To actively manage your stakeholders’ expectations, you have to know what 
those expectations are in the first place. Start by simply asking your stake-
holders what they expect from the project. Don’t be fooled here, as what 
they tell you is most likely only part of the story. When you begin working 
with your stakeholders you can nail down the basics, such as what level of 
involvement they want to have with the project, the frequency and format of 
status updates, which decisions they want to participate in, and so forth. After 
you’ve established a relationship, you can then start asking for feedback. Is 
there something more you and your team can do for the stakeholder? Is the 
frequency and depth of the regular updates adequate? Is the stakeholder satis-
fied with the team’s progress to date? As the relationship progresses, you can 
move into brainstorming strategic challenges for the entire program, but you 
can’t get to this point without putting in the work to understand who your 
stakeholders are and to actively manage their expectations.
A good place to start is with a customer-oriented mindset. Deliberately refer 
to your key stakeholders as customers, no matter if they are the final end user 
or not. This makes a tremendous difference with your team and with your own 
point of view. You see, everyone has some understanding of what exceptional 
customer service looks like. Sadly, many of us aren’t motivated to provide that 
level of service, especially if the prevailing culture is not customer-focused. 
Therefore, the project manager must instill a customer service orientation 
into their teams and themselves. A stakeholder who’s viewed as an important 
customer by the project team interacts with a team that’s bought into their 
mutual success. This fosters a positive and collaborative environment, which 
in turn keeps the stakeholder’s expectations in check.
Own the Communication
One mistake I often see project managers make is to not take control of the 
communication to their key stakeholders. All too often those same project 
managers believe that a well-crafted email will suffice. They then leave it up to 
the stakeholder to glean meaning and intent from the message, thereby abdicat-
ing any influence over the stakeholder’s expectations. To actually manage and 
affect your stakeholder’s expectations, you have to own the conversation.

Chapter 12 | Stakeholder Management in the Real World
148
It’s obvious that these conversations should be open and honest, but that’s 
only part of the picture. You also need to actively manage the information 
being conveyed, applying the guidelines you read in the “Stop Sharing Too 
Much Information” section of the preceding chapter.
Apply Some Psychology
There is a tremendous amount of research out there regarding how the brain 
works, and project managers can gain useful insights into how to influence 
their stakeholders by studying this data. This insight is particularly useful when 
determining a particular strategy for conveying bad news. You know that you 
shouldn’t go into your most important stakeholder’s office and just blurt out, 
“We’re now a month behind schedule because someone dropped the con-
troller off the forklift…oops!”—and run out the door. Instead, you need to 
understand how the brain works and craft an appropriate message. What you 
need to do is describe just why that forklift driver dropped the controller, 
in detail. You see, explaining an event lessens its emotional impact. By drop-
ping your bomb and running away, you actually enhance its emotional impact, 
thereby ensuring an enraged stakeholder.1 Explaining why it happened is a 
critical component of delivering bad news.
Another critical component when dealing with stakeholders is their overall 
sense of control. It’s vital that you help your stakeholders maintain a sense of 
control over the project and a belief that the project itself is under control. 
You see, it makes people happy to have a sense of control over their environ-
ment and it is gratifying to exert that control.2 Knowing this, the astute proj-
ect manager will deliberately go to her key stakeholders on a periodic basis 
and ask them to exert some direct control over the project. For example,  
I might go to the stakeholder to ask her for assistance removing a roadblock. In 
this instance it doesn’t matter that I could have taken care of the issue myself. 
It will make my key stakeholder happy by giving her a sense that she’s part of 
the team and can influence what’s going on with the project. Now obviously 
you would not want to overuse this technique and create the impression that 
you’re incompetent, but judicious use can be highly effective and maintain a 
happy and supportive stakeholder.
While a project manager may go to a stakeholder for help removing a road-
block, it’s much more common to consult with a key stakeholder over a major 
decision about the direction or prioritization of the project. In these instances, 
the project manager will prepare a set of recommendations for the stake-
holder to review and make a ruling on. Understanding how the brain makes

decisions can be extremely useful in this scenario. You see, when it comes 
to making decisions the brain behaves a bit like that toddler in that pageant  
I mentioned earlier. When presented with a side-by-side comparison of data, 
the brain tends to zero in on the differences, even if they are not relevant  
to the decision that needs to be made.3 Think of the toddler who at the  
start of the pageant only wants to leave with a sparkly tiara. When she does 
place in the contest and the MC negligently grabs the tiara with the blue stone 
off the judging table to plunk on her head, she’s immediately starts wailing 
because she now passionately wants the one with the pink stone. Prior to the 
competition she only wanted that sparkly tiara, but when it comes time to 
receive it, she’s making a value decision about a difference she did not even 
care about at the beginning. Of course your stakeholders aren’t going to carry 
on like toddlers with blue-stone tiaras, but they will certainly focus on any 
comparative differences in your data, so make sure that you only include those 
data points that are relevant to the decision.
What makes managing stakeholders so very challenging is the people. We each 
have our own quirks and idiosyncrasies that require the project manager to 
continually build a toolbox of techniques for effective communication and influ-
ence. Developing a solid plan for regular interaction with your stakeholder, 
owning the conversation, and applying some experimental results from the field 
of psychology can move you from a good project manager to a great one.
The Tricky Bits
No matter how good you are at stakeholder management, there are always 
a few special ones who require more advanced strategies. I’m talking about 
those tricky stakeholders, such as the bully in purchasing who uses bureau-
cracy to exert control over your project, the marketing representative who’s 
always on a plane to see another customer, the R&D scientist who has a 
whole new paradigm in mind, the micromanaging resource manager, and the 
poor soul who would love a root canal so that she doesn’t have to work on 
your project. How do you manage those tricky stakeholders?
Managing the Bully
There’s one type of stakeholder who regularly hands you your hat as a project 
manager and that’s the Bully. Many a project manager has fallen by the wayside, 
simply because they failed to address and effectively deal with the Bully. My 
worst nemesis was a guy whom we all called “Crazy Chris.” This guy was so 
3Ibid., p. 157.

Chapter 12 | Stakeholder Management in the Real World
150
tightly wound he could not accept anything less than perfection and often got 
so close to the edge of his temper that we worker bees would take bets on 
when he’d completely lose it. I can close my eyes right now I see him stand-
ing in front of me, red faced, all but bouncing up and down with aggression, 
screaming at me that my team could not “read the test procedure.” He was 
completely focused on having me admit that my team and I were illiterate. 
Needless to say, I didn’t handle that situation well and I’ve definitely learned 
a lot about dealing with bullies since then. Today, there aren’t as many Crazy 
Chrises around, but there are still people who dominate others through 
aggressive force of will. To successfully lead a team, all project managers need 
to have strategies for dealing with this type of stakeholder.
A Bully stakeholder is frequently the most aggressive person in any confron-
tational discussion. They exhibit low emotional maturity, are myopic about 
their solutions, and are dismissive of anyone else’s viewpoint. You know what 
I’m talking about here and I don’t think I need to spell it out. I’d bet my week’s 
lunch money that each and every one of you has an example of a Bully stake-
holder, either in your current project or from one in the not-too-distant past. 
The thing you need to understand about bullies is that it’s all about winners 
versus losers. If they can intimidate you (and your team by extension), then 
they “win.” Conversely, in that scenario, you become the “loser.” These folks 
are definitely keeping score and, trust me, that score is very important to 
them. The trick to effectively dealing with these stakeholders is to change the 
game, while refraining from putting them in the “loser” position.
So just how do you curtail a Bully and turn him or her into a collaborative 
stakeholder?
The first thing you must do is establish a strong first 
• 
impression. Don’t give in to their intimidation, don’t back 
down from their aggression, and avoid getting sucked into 
this winners-vs.-losers game they have going. Maintain 
your emotional maturity and strive to keep things on a 
professional level. Call a time-out if you think they are 
too close to the edge, to give them a chance to pull it 
back together privately.
The next thing you have to do is actively utilize your posi-
• 
tional authority or SME status. Remember that for the 
Bully it’s all about winning vs. losing, so establishing yourself 
as a winner in their eyes instantly increases their respect 
for you. Try saying something like this, “Okay, Melanie, 
I appreciate your input, and as the Project Manager 
responsible for making the schedule commitments for 
the board team, I am holding to my earlier January 10 
commit.” The key point here is that you emphasize your 

151
Managing Projects in the Real World
authority to make the commit and imply that you will 
take full accountability for meeting that commit. Don’t 
justify your commit; just make it clear that you and you 
alone own that commit.
This next strategy aligns with the previous two, and it is 
• 
to demonstrate extreme self-confidence. Speak clearly 
and authoritatively but not loudly. If you’re on the phone 
with the Bully, stand up. If you’re having the discussion 
in person, look the Bully directly in the eye. Any hesi-
tancy on your part will be perceived as a weakness, so it’s 
doubly important to come off as very confident in these 
situations.
You must be active and aggressive in facilitating any meet-
• 
ing the Bully attends. This will frequently require that you 
interrupt the Bully and pull input from other, more sub-
dued teammates. Make no mistake, this may be very hard 
for you at first, but by actively facilitating the meeting, 
you’re sending a message to the entire team that every-
one’s opinion will be heard and considered, not just the 
Bully’s.
This last one is a bit sneaky, but I’ve found that it works 
• 
brilliantly if done carefully. Give the Bully assignments to 
produce data that supports their argument. This does 
two things: first, it acknowledges the validity of the Bully’s 
point, thereby allowing them to feel like they’ve won; sec-
ond, it reinforces the concept of data-based decisions. If 
the Bully has a good point and the data to back it up, 
then you definitely want the team to execute her way. 
However, what often happens is that the Bully realizes the 
flaws in her argument via the process of data collection 
and the problem resolves itself. Either way, you and your 
team win without having to go through a death match to 
make a decision.
All of these strategies are well and good, but don’t kid yourself—you just can’t 
change a person that much. What you can do, however, is change the team 
dynamic so that the Bully wants to collaborate and in that collaboration see 
himself as a winner. The real trick to dealing with Bullies is to get them to 
respect you, and then help them get into a position to win in their own minds 
through effective collaboration with the rest of the team.

Managing the Ghost
Ghost stakeholders are as familiar to project managers as they are frustrating. 
They appear to be ambivalent to the project status, major milestones, quality 
standards, deliverables, and so on. They travel frequently, making it virtually 
impossible to connect with them live and in person, which makes it extremely 
difficult to meet with them. They don’t return your emails in this millennium 
and they do not see the project as a high priority.
The big “tell” for me that I’m dealing with this type of stakeholder is my own 
frustration with their apparent lack of involvement in the project planning. 
That’s when I know I’ve got a Ghost on my hands. In general these are nice 
folks who are easy to get along with…if you can capture their attention for 
a few precious minutes. Tie the fate of your project to their responsiveness 
at your peril. They mean well, but make no mistake: this is a very challenging 
stakeholder to manage and you need a specific strategy to deal with them.
So just how do you go about managing this type of stakeholder without irri-
tating the you-know-what out of them? How do you keep the project execu-
tion on track if it’s at all tied to this stakeholder’s input? Well, here are a few 
strategies I have refined over the years to deal with the Ghost stakeholder:
Provide concise, regular status updates in their preferred 
• 
medium.
Trap them in an abandoned conference room and get 
• 
agreement on their “guardrails:” how far they will let you 
and your team run without their direct input, knowledge, 
or approval. Be sure that you understand the aspects of 
the project they care about, decisions they want in on, 
budget limits, and tolerance for meetings.
Respect these “guardrails” and then leave the stakeholder 
• 
alone.
Be extremely concise in your direct communication with them.
• 
Double-check that this person is the right stakeholder 
• 
for your project. Perhaps he can delegate that role to 
someone with more time to support the team.
The key thing to remember about this type of stakeholder is that he really 
does care about your project…just not as much as you do. Your goal is to 
limit your project team’s dependence on this stakeholder’s input, direction, 
and approval, all while ensuring that the stakeholder remains happy with the 
team’s work. It’s also worth noting that you might have made a mistake and 
this person isn’t truly a stakeholder at all! When that happens, have a quick 
chat with them to confirm that they aren’t in the game, then remove them 
from all meeting invites and email distribution lists.

Managing Projects in the Real World
Managing the Visionary
Another very challenging stakeholder to manage is the one I call the Visionary. 
This is a stakeholder who’s got a big picture understanding of the deliverable 
but has difficulty communicating that vision to you and your team.
What does this look like in the real world? The requirements are typically 
vague and high-level. This stakeholder is frequently the primary customer 
who tends to talk about the importance of the project and what the project 
can enable in the future, rather than the specifics of the deliverables. There’s 
a tendency to dive in and discuss how to start development, often dictating 
approaches or methodologies to be used. Further, there’s often little or no 
understanding of the security, regulatory, legal, and other established business 
process implications. The customer clearly sees how to implement their idea 
and can become impatient with the project team if they don’t catch on quickly. 
Finally, there’s a tendency to want to continue playing with or tweaking the 
deliverables, resulting in projects that just won’t end. To a lot of project man-
agers, this sounds like a nightmare—but it doesn’t have to be.
So, how do you manage key stakeholder’s expectations to deliver a product 
that looks like their big-picture vision while balancing the triple constraint? 
The following table breaks out specific strategies that can be used to address 
these challenging stakeholders.

or dismissive of, legal and regulatory

Educate the customer early about the amount of 
work and time required in these areas.

long after the deliverables are complete.
Hold a formal closure meeting and step through 
each requirement, gaining stakeholder agreement 
that each requirement has been satisfied.

Two years ago I worked on a POC project with a customer who was friendly, 
flexible, and open to my team’s ideas. The challenge with this particular cus-
tomer was that he was a Visionary stakeholder. He had a big-picture under-
standing of the project deliverables but struggled with documenting the nuts 
and bolts of the requirements. As a result, he wanted a very sophisticated 
proof of concept despite the extremely short development cycle, all while 
dictating the software tools that would be used for the proof of concept 
work. By using the techniques recommended here, I was able to successfully 
manage the project and deliver a tool that met the intent of my customer’s 
big-picture vision, while adhering to a very tight schedule. Further, because my 
approach was collaborative and I actively worked to complement the areas 
he struggled with, the project was a positive experience for all involved. The 
customer now has a very slick POC he can troll out to future customers, and 
I have a very satisfied customer.
Managing the Micromanager
We’ve all led projects where either our direct manager or another key stake-
holder has micromanagement tendencies. This is not only frustrating for the 
project managers; it also completely undermines their authority. You can redi-
rect those micromanagement tendencies—defang the Micromanager monster, 
if you will—with a few carefully applied stakeholder management techniques.
First, so that we’re all on the same page, let’s talk about the characteristics of a 
Micromanaging stakeholder. If you find yourself having to provide project status 
often and on an ad hoc basis, then you may be the victim of a Micromanager. 
If you find yourself providing deep-dive-level details in your regular status 
updates, you might be dealing with one or more Micromanagers. You could 
also just be over-communicating, so see the previous discussion for some 
ideas on how to manage that. If you see your stakeholder providing updates 
on your team’s commitments, then you’ve probably got a Micromanager on 
your hands. Finally, the most obvious (and destructive) sign that you are deal-
ing with a Micromanager is when the stakeholder in question goes directly 
to your team members for updates rather than coming to you, the project 
manager.
Sound familiar? I thought it might. Luckily, there’s a pretty simple solution for 
all of those symptoms. The absolute best way to defang the Micromanager is 
to provide consistent, regular status updates. This sounds a bit naïve, doesn’t 
it? Well I’m here to testify that providing concise updates on a regular cadence 
will eliminate almost all of your headaches dealing with a Micromanaging 
stakeholder. Let me break this down a bit for you.
When I say concise I mean just that. Your status updates need to be at the 
appropriate level for the intended audience. You may even need to provide 
more than one format if your stakeholders have significantly different needs. 

155
Managing Projects in the Real World
It also needs to be something that the stakeholder can skim and pick up the 
primary messages of “on track/not on track,” “look Ma, we done good/bad,” 
and “here’s how you can help us.” Personally, I prefer the format of a single 
summary slide per project with a nifty stoplight that tells the audience imme-
diately if things are good/green or bad/red. At the end of the day, you want to 
provide information that’s relevant and actionable to your stakeholders.
When I say regular, that’s pretty obvious, right? One thing I’ve noticed though 
is that those micromanagers are also the ones who are a bit more informal 
and who don’t have a regular forum set up to review project status. If you’re 
dealing with this Micromanaging stakeholder scenario, then I’d guess that you 
aren’t required to provide a regular project status. In this case, it’s up to you, 
the project manager, to establish that project status review forum. It can be 
as simple as an email update you send regularly, or you can set up a standing 
meeting to go over project status. In general I prefer to do this on a weekly 
basis, at the end of the week, but the cadence and timing should really be 
negotiated to meet your Micromanaging stakeholder’s needs.
This is exactly what happened when I started managing projects for one 
boss. He was constantly stopping by my desk to ask for an update or, worse 
yet, going directly to the team members for updates. I suggested/instituted a 
weekly, 30-minute meeting to go over the status of all projects in flight. Once 
my boss got comfortable with the quality of the updates, he stopped those 
micromanagement tendencies. I think what he really needed to believe was 
that I knew what was going on and that I was actively managing the work. 
Eventually we were able to knock out statuses for three projects and still have 
time to discuss strategic actions he wants me to take—all within a 30-minute 
window.
Finally, I know what you’re thinking—something like this: “Melanie, I’m busy 
enough as it is! Why should I eke out the time to do another status update 
that I’m not required to provide?” Hey, I get it: you’re busy and this seems like 
extra work right? Well, first, it won’t take you much time at all. Trust me, you 
already know that project status off the top of your head, and it will only take 
you 10–15 minutes per project to update a summary slide once you have that 
template established. Yes, it will take an investment of about an hour or so to 
populate a status slide with your initial project details, but you only have to do 
that once for each project. When you stop to consider how much time you’re 
wasting by responding to all of those ad hoc status requests, the investment of 
10–15 minutes per week on a status slide seems much more reasonable.
How to defang the Micromanaging stakeholder? Easy, provide project status 
information that’s actionable and at the appropriate level for that stakeholder 
and provide the status at a predictable cadence that the stakeholder can rely 
on. If you do these two things, then you can defang, tame, and rehabilitate 
almost any Micromanaging stakeholder.

Managing the Prisoner
Almost every project has a Prisoner: the person who would rather be getting 
a weekly root canal than sitting in your project meeting. I’m sure I don’t need 
to explain that I’m not talking about orange jumpsuits, scary tats, and the ol’ 
bread-and-water routine here. Instead, I’m talking about the people who are 
on your team who really don’t want to be there.
First let’s talk about the characteristics of the Prisoner. Project Prisoners are 
often the people least engaged in meetings. They are those silent few who sit 
slightly separate from the group and commune with their laptops. In virtual 
meetings they remain utterly silent. The truly hardcore Prisoners have given 
up caring and are frankly just enduring your team and your project. They 
don’t get angry or excited because it just doesn’t matter to them. A Prisoner 
will not volunteer for extra work, even if it’s to help out a teammate. The 
work they do for the project will be, at best, merely adequate and, at worst, 
late and sloppy. You tend to see a lot of this type of stakeholder on other-
wise all-volunteer teams—especially those projects that involve quasi-process 
improvements. Honestly, it’s hard to get excited about yet another “solve-
world-hunger” decision-making process even if you are willing to be part of a 
solution, so imagine how little the Prisoner can care about that kind of project. 
I’m serious here: they…just…don’t…care.
So how do these project Prisoners come to your otherwise amazing team? 
Well, for the most part they get nominated or directed to work with you by 
a direct manager. No one who voluntarily signs up for a process improvement 
team is going to be a Prisoner; conversely, almost anyone who’s told to par-
ticipate has some level of Prisoner mentality going. There are also those folks 
who are coasting in their career and they can have that Prisoner mentality too. 
It doesn’t really matter to the project manager what the root cause is; the 
reality is that you have a Prisoner on your team and you need to manage that 
stakeholder carefully to avoid tanking your team dynamic early in the project 
lifecycle.
So now that you know what a Prisoner looks like, how do you go about 
“managing” one?
For some teams, there’s a straightforward strategy for dealing with Prisoners. 
At the beginning of a new project, the project manager meets with each team 
member and asks straight up if they see themselves as a Camper, a Tourist, or 
a Prisoner on the project. A Camper is someone who’s settled in, committed, 
and ready to work. A Tourist is someone who’s curious but not yet convinced 
that the project is worth their time and effort. Obviously, the Prisoner is 
someone assigned to the team who really hasn’t bought into the project or 
who simply doesn’t want to be there. I really like this approach because it 
drags the elephant out from under the rug in a humorous and non-threatening 
way. Once you get it on the table that the Prisoner would rather be working 

157
Managing Projects in the Real World
at the local stockyards than working on your project, you can work together 
to solve the problem.
Once you’re eye-to-eye with the elephant you have to figure out what to do 
with it. The first and most obvious tactic to consider is whether you can get 
this person off your project, peaceably. Sometimes this is as simple as meeting 
with the Prisoner’s direct manager to see if there’s a different resource that’s a 
better fit. If you can pull off getting the Prisoner reassigned without damaging 
his or her reputation with the manager, then you look like a hero and every-
one wins, including the Prisoner.
Okay, we all know life isn’t always that easy, so let’s say that your Prisoners are 
stuck on the project. A really good tactic to employ is to assign them work 
they can reasonably get done. Don’t even think about expecting them to do 
anything outside of their perceived job descriptions, because that’s just asking 
for trouble. If at all possible, try to configure the work around the Prisoners’ 
areas of expertise or whatever they are passionate about. For instance, if you 
have a Prisoner who’s passionate about compliance and doing the right thing, 
then they might be a good candidate for coordinating the legal and security 
reviews that need to happen. If you can tap into something they care about 
and feel is important, then you have a decent chance of breaking them out of 
their prison.
Another tactic you should consider…and I can’t believe I’m saying this…is to 
just let them be. If you’ve tried to get them reassigned to no avail and there’s 
no way to assign them work around their passions, then your best bet might 
just be to let it go and focus on other more urgent things. If the Prisoner is 
quietly doing his work and not disrupting the team dynamic, then don’t ­create 
a problem you can’t solve. You’re not off the hook for continuing to try to 
motivate and inspire them as part of your team; just realize that you might 
not win that one.
Some of you are probably wondering what you should do with the project 
Prisoner who, frankly, needs to be kicked off the team. They aren’t team play-
ers and they just suck the joy out of the room every time they walk in the 
door. They don’t want to be there and, by golly, everyone’s gonna know about 
it. To be honest, this isn’t the norm and it’s rare that a PM will need to get 
serious about removing a resource.
If you do have to go down this road, there are a couple of things to bear in 
mind. First, have you done all you can to turn this person and the situation 
around? Second, does the Prisoner realize your next steps will involve escala-
tions to their manager? Third, do you have specific, documented evidence that 
the Prisoner is not meeting her commitments? As I mentioned, this is a rare 
occurrence but don’t take it lightly. You’re messing with someone’s career 
and livelihood, so make sure you’ve got the facts to back up your request that 
she be removed from the team. Not quite comfortable taking this step? Well, 

Chapter 12 | Stakeholder Management in the Real World
158
to be blunt, suck it up! The rest of your team is counting on you to address 
the problem in a timely manner. Remember that you are the team leader and 
you have a commitment to each member to provide an environment that is 
conducive to getting the work done. It’s pretty simple to fix this problem for 
both your team and the Prisoner with a little effort. Just remember: the worst 
thing you can do is ignore the elephant under the rug and hope it will go away 
on its own.
Managing Up
Despite what you might think, the process for managing stakeholder expecta-
tions of those who outrank you is pretty straightforward. Over the years, I’ve 
learned a lot about this area and have come to realize that there’re really two 
three-step processes for managing this type of stakeholder.
To Influence a Decision
Step 1: Believe that you can and should approach anyone who is 
higher up the food chain than yourself. This is a biggie and frankly it’s 
where most PMs falter when it comes to managing up. I hear many people 
say things such as, “Oh I couldn’t go talk to the VP of Engineering,” or “My 
boss would have kittens if I went and talked to his boss!” Well, that could be, 
although I believe it’s a biological impossibility, but, to be frank, that’s almost 
never the case. Most people would be surprised to hear that those higher-ups 
actually want to hear from you. Further, if your boss is any good at all, then 
they should be fine with you talking to their boss. Sure, they may want to 
understand what you are going to propose to their boss, and if you’re lucky 
they will give you some solid coaching on how to influence the higher-ups.
Step 2: Really understand the higher-up’s point of view. What is their 
primary interest in your project or the topic under discussion? What are the 
major initiatives of the organization that this person is responsible for? What 
are the budget implications for this person? What are the business drivers 
at play here? Is there a significant political implication to the discussion and 
its output? Finally, what type of communicator is she? Do you need to go in 
armed with data or a really good story?
Step 3: Go in with multiple recommendations. It’s your job as the PM 
to bring options to the table. The goal here is to provide alternate solu-
tions even if they seem unrealistic to you. Provide the smorgasbord and then 
let the higher-ups have at it. With multiple recommendations you are doing 
two things. You are appealing to the higher-up’s ego and you’re leveraging his 
experience. Trust me, nothing makes a GM perk up and pay attention more 
than the words, “I need a priority call here”—or, even better, “We need your 

159
Managing Projects in the Real World
help making a tough business decision.” Nothing makes a person’s heart go 
pitty-pat like an appeal to their ego by verbally acknowledging their positional 
authority. Oh, and remember you get paid no matter which option you have 
to go execute. ☺
To Build a Credible Reputation
Step 1: Follow the steps in the previous section.
Step 2: Never miss an opportunity to speak to the higher-up. This is 
basic Stakeholder Management 101 and you know the drill: “How was your 
weekend?” “Did you hear? We finished the final code development yesterday!” 
“Got any advice about how to get that latest budget change approved?” “Gee, 
your lunch looks better than mine.” Remember, a person isn’t defined by their 
position on the org chart, and those same techniques you use with the recal-
citrant lab tech will work just fine with the marketing manager, but you have 
to step up and actually approach them.
Step 3: Brag about your team’s accomplishments. Okay, this really is an 
extension of Step 2. However, when you are trying to build a solid reputation 
with those higher up the ladder than you, bragging is even more critical. You 
see, it’s entirely possible that the GM you’re sharing the elevator with may not 
know that your team just powered on that new control module in record-
breaking time. You really do need to tell them that. Remember, if the person 
is higher up the ladder than you, then they probably have oversight to more 
work than you and the depth of her understanding about what’s going on for 
every project is probably pretty shallow. So go ahead and brag your head off.
There you have it: Melanie’s Easy a-One-and-a-Two Three-Step 
Program for Managing Up. It’s not that hard once you get past Step 1, so 
take a minute and ask yourself if you really are comfortable talking to your 
boss’s boss. If not, what’s holding you back? A real “special” kinda boss or 
your own perception of what would happen? Sure, I’ve worked for the kitten-
producing boss before and that can hamper your ability to actively engage 
with higher-ups…but it sure doesn’t stop you from working to build a credible 
reputation with anyone in the org.

Communicating 
with Difficult 
People
Everyone in today’s work force is expected to be able to “work with difficult 
people.” In most cases, it’s possible to minimize your interaction with the dif-
ficult few and still get your job done. However if you’re a PM, then you just 
can’t avoid ’em. Nope, you’ve got to be the one to face down Wyatt Earp in 
the middle of the dusty street at high noon. Of course, what you really want 
to do is avoid or manage the confrontation so that it’s not a shootout in front 
of your entire team, so to do that you need to be better than average at deal-
ing with difficult people. It’s also helpful to realize that it’s not that the other 
person is “difficult” so much as it is that they are bad communicators.
It’s Them, Not Me
The first thing you need to do when dealing with a bad communicator is to 
get your head right. I always assume that it’s my responsibility to make myself 
clear enough that the other person understands the point I’m trying to make. 
Further, it’s also my responsibility to understand the point the other person is 
trying to make. This is a mindset and once you start taking responsibility for 
the effectiveness of the communication, you will find yourself dealing with a 
lot fewer “bad” communicators.
Okay, okay, I know what you’re thinking…on to the good stuff!

What Do You Do about a Serial Interrupter?
As I see it, you need a two-pronged approach to the Serial Interrupter. First, 
stop the interrupter directly after her first attempt to interrupt you by saying 
something like this: “Hold on, Melanie, I wasn’t finished speaking.” Don’t use 
a whiny or pissy tone of voice; instead, use your grown-up, professional one 
to say this. Note that this tactic may or may not work, but it’s always a good 
starting point. Now if your serial interrupter is unstoppable, catch her as she 
is leaving the meeting for a quick, private chat. Here you want to call attention 
to the behavior by saying something like this: “You know, Melanie, you might 
not realize this, but you interrupted me five times in the last meeting. I frankly 
do not appreciate it. In the future, can you please show me some professional 
respect and allow me to finish my thought without interruption?” Again, use 
that grown-up, professional voice and be gracious when the other person 
apologizes, as they most often will do, when confronted directly with the 
behavior. Sure, this isn’t a comfortable conversation, but you owe it to your 
colleague to show them respect by pointing out their bad behavior.
What Do You Do about Someone Who Doesn’t  
Actually Listen to You? 
These are the folks bonded with their cell phones, laptops, tablets, anyone else 
walking by, and so on. By far the best tactic I’ve found for dealing with Someone 
Who Just Doesn’t Listen to me is to just stop talking. Let that “dead air” develop 
and eventually the bad communicator will make eye contact with you and give 
you their undivided attention. Here’s where you say something like this: “Look, 
Melanie, you seem to be pretty busy now and can’t devote your attention to 
this topic. Why don’t I reschedule for another time when you can concen-
trate on this?” If your bad communicator is a hard case, then they’ll relent 
and promise to focus on your conversation…for all of five minutes and then 
their bad behavior will resume. This is time to get tough and say something 
along these lines: “Okay, Melanie, you clearly can’t focus on or participate in 
the conversation. I’ll send you an email with the pertinent data and you can 
let me know if you have any questions.” At this point, pack up your toys and 
go do something productive with your time. This person is basically wasting 
your time, and it’s up to you how long you let it go on. Take control of the 
communication, find a better forum for conveying your data, and move on.

163
Managing Projects in the Real World
What Do You Do If Someone Just Doesn’t  
Understand Your Point? 
If someone just doesn’t understand your point, you need to step back from the 
act of making that point and start asking some questions. This goes something 
like this: “Okay, I think we aren’t on the same page here. Here’s what I think 
you meant …. Is this what you were thinking?” Also ask yourself what perti-
nent point the other person is missing and then see if you can figure out why 
that is. This is where trying to walk in the other person’s shoes is invaluable. 
Once you understand their context, then you can help them understand yours. 
Remember, the responsibility for effective communication lies with you.
What Do You Do If Someone’s Locked into a Weird, 
Repetitive Loop? 
If someone’s locked into a weird, repetitive loop, there’s a simple trick for breaking 
it. When you get a word in edgewise, say something like this: “Okay, I think 
you’re saying that Melanie really deserves a promo, right? Did I get the point 
you were trying to make there?” Basically, the person repeating the same 
argument ad nauseam doesn’t think you understand their position. Parrot it 
back to them and ask for confirmation of your understanding. This one works 
most of the time, so if you take just one strategy away from this discussion, 
make it this one.
What Do You Do with Folks Who Write Really  
Long Emails?
For those folks who write really long emails, try this tactic. Reply to their mes-
sage with something like this: “Melanie, what specifically do you want me to 
do? There’s a lot of data in the email below but it’s unclear to me what and 
when you need my support. Please clarify.” Note that it’s imperative here that 
you keep your response succinct and professional. This may not “fix” the 
other person, but it will send the message that their email message was too 
complex.
What Do You Do When Someone’s Data Are Shaky?
For the person who doesn’t sound confident in their data or the point they are 
making, you need to understand a bit more about what’s going on. If they lack 
confidence in their own ability, you simply say: “You know, Melanie, I trust your 
judgment here. What is your professional recommendation?” If you get the  
feeling that they need more time (or need to do more research), then let them 

Chapter 13 | Communicating with Difficult People
164
off the hook by saying something like this: “This seems to be more complex 
than we originally thought. Do you need more time to analyze the data? This 
is an important decision and I think we need to do due diligence and make 
sure we understand the data before moving forward.” Note that this can be 
tricky because you don’t want to devote a lot more time to analysis, but you 
do need to respect the professional judgment of your colleague.
What Do You Do about the Rambler?
Now the one you’ve all been waiting for…what to do about the Rambler? 
(Cue Merle Haggard’s “Ramblin’ Fever.”) To address the rambling conversation, 
you need to figure out what’s driving this behavior. If someone is dreading your 
reaction to her data, you will hear this in the “dance-around-the-topic” nature 
of their conversation. In short, they don’t feel “safe” conveying this message. 
To address this, you need to re-establish that “safe” feeling. You can do this 
by saying something like: “You know, Melanie, while I may not like your update, 
I’m not going to shoot the messenger.” Managing your body language and tone 
of voice can also go a long way to re-establishing safety. Now another reason 
for a rambling dissertation could be that the person doing the rambling hasn’t 
thought through the entire point, process, or dataset. Some people process 
their thoughts orally and you just have to be patient and let them think out 
loud. This can be frustrating but, again, you need to look deeper to understand 
what’s driving this oral road trip. Last, you might have heard (or experienced) 
the egg-timer method of speeding people up. Basically, the idea is that you set 
a time limit—say, two minutes—and then let the other person speak. Once 
the timer dings, it’s buh-bye and on to the next topic and person. I’ve heard 
from plenty of people who’ve been on the wrong side of that timer and 
have come to the conclusion that its short-term effectiveness is negated by 
the long-term animosity it engenders. In short, keep those egg-timers in the 
kitchen and out of your colleagues’ faces.
So there you have it: a few ideas for how to deal with bad communicators and 
move toward more effective communication.
Pass the Brie…Or How to Deal with Whiners
Now what about that most frustrating of teammates: the Whiner? I’m con-
vinced that the world is made up of whiners and those who have to listen 
to someone else whine…and we all seem to alternate between the two as 
the situation warrants. It would be naïve to assume that I never whine or 
expect that my teams always be made up of non-whiners. There’s always one 
(or five!) in the bunch and for PMs these folks present a unique challenge. 

165
Managing Projects in the Real World
Here are some tips and tricks for dealing with whiners—Melanie’s “Want-
Some-Cheese-with-that-Whine?” Strategies:
The most important thing to do when dealing with a 
• 
whiner is to stop whining yourself. Yep, your own discon-
tent with the situation just might be the cheese to the 
other person’s whine.
• 
Be Switzerland. As the PM you should represent each per-
son on your team equally, which means that you can’t 
agree that Melanie is a super slacker. Instead, you’ve got 
to help the whiner see things from Melanie’s perspec-
tive and hopefully convince him that the situation isn’t as 
black and white as he thinks.
• 
Put yourself in the whiner’s shoes. What’s really going on 
here? From what grapes does this whine come? Is there 
something to be addressed that’s not obviously related to 
the house whine?
Now if your whiner has a 
• 
problem with a teammate and 
wants you to get involved, consider a couple of strategies. 
First, encourage him to go talk to his nemesis directly and 
resolve the issue. Second, remind the whiner that you 
extend the same professional courtesy to his nemesis 
that you do to him. In short, don’t take sides.
• 
Just listen. Sometimes all the whiner really needs is to be 
listened to. They don’t expect you to solve their problem 
and they don’t want to escalate something. Rather, what 
they need is a friendly face to vent to a little.
• 
Don’t get sucked into soap opera à la Days of Our Lives. 
Remember, you’re Switzerland.
Throw the 
• 
TMI card when the whiner starts going down 
an avenue that’s too personal or makes you uncomfort-
able. It really is okay to stop the other person and say, 
“Whoa! That’s more information than I need. Let’s get 
back to the work-related discussion.”
The key to dealing with a whiner is to step back and look at the discussion 
from a different perspective. Reframe your perspective and try to help the 
other person do so as well. Oh, and remember, we all whine from time to 
time, so cut your colleagues some slack and focus on helping them put down 
the glass.

Crap! It Really Is Me, Not Them
Now let’s talk about the most common habits of bad communicators and 
what you should be doing about them…when you have these bad habits!
You might be a Bad Communicator if…
You interrupt others.
• 
You don’t listen to what others say.
• 
You don’t understand the other person’s point of view.
• 
You repeat yourself all the time—seriously, you repeat 
• 
yourself.
You sound like you don’t believe your own point.
• 
You ramble.
• 
Now ask yourself, “Do I do any of these things?” If you’re honest with your-
self and the answer is, “Yeah, I do #1 all the time. Dang it! Now how do I fix 
that?”—try Melanie’s Fixes for Bad Communication Habits.
How Do You Fix It If You Interrupt Others?
You interrupt others. Let’s be honest here, there are a lotta folks doing this. Yep, 
I’m talkin’ to you! How do you fix this bad habit? Well, frankly, you just need 
to stop interrupting people. Yeah, like you didn’t know that one was coming 
right? Okay, here are a couple of techniques I use, because this is probably my 
worst communication habit:
Keep a notepad handy and jot down your thoughts as 
• 
they come while the other person is speaking. When 
they complete their thought and it’s your turn, go ahead 
and verbally make your points. Taking the time to actu-
ally write or type my thoughts distracts me enough that 
I don’t jump into the conversation as soon as the idea 
pops in my head.
Hold a running mantra in your mind that goes something 
• 
like this: “Don’t talk now, it’s not your turn.” Yeah, this one 
is dorky, but it works surprisingly well for me. ☺

167
Managing Projects in the Real World
How Do You Fix It If You Don’t Listen to or  
Understand Others?
You don’t listen to what others say goes hand-in-hand with you don’t understand 
the other person’s point of view. To fix these, try jotting down notes to your-
self about what the other person is saying. Try to identify the key points. 
This exercise in transcribing and interpreting what the other person is saying 
forces you to listen to them and make sense of what they are saying. This 
technique is especially useful in virtual meetings.
How Do You Fix It If You Repeat Yourself?
Realizing that you’ve just repeated yourself for the nth time is the first step to 
fixing this problem. Once I realize that I’ve become a broken record, I try to 
step back verbally and ask for confirmation that my point is being understood. 
This goes something like this: “Okay, that’s what I think. Did you follow my 
logic there? Do you have any questions?” What I’m looking for here is for the 
other person to reiterate my argument to confirm that they understood the 
point I thought I was making. For what it’s worth, this tactic works in reverse 
if you’re stuck with someone who continually repeats their points.
Do You Believe What You’re Saying?
Do you really believe what you’re saying? If so, then why doesn’t anyone believe 
that? First, if you honestly can’t get behind your point 100%, then you need to 
reframe your argument or point so that you can. When it comes to commu-
nication, sincerity trumps all other characteristics. If you can’t say it and mean 
it, then don’t say it or change your message. Second, you need to sound con-
fident of your argument. If you’re not sure it’s right, then why should anyone 
else be swayed by your oration?
How Do You Fix It If You’re a Rambler?
Last, we all know someone who rambles, but I suspect most of us don’t realize 
that we do it ourselves. Obviously, the trick is to be succinct, but just how do you 
do that? You should also consider how much information you’re trying to pass 
along. Does the other person need supporting data, or do they just need your 
conclusion or recommendation? Try to focus on what information you need  
to convey—what is it about your point that’s actionable to the other party?  
Cut out all of the fluff and your own thought process so that you don’t ramble. 
The other person can always ask for more data if they need it. Make sense?
Whew! a rather long list, I know. But I hope I’ve given you some good ideas 
for how to break some of your bad communication habits.

Closure Phase
IV
P A R T  

Is Your Team 
Ready to 
Release?
All the planning that’s been done and all of the execution of the plan leads to 
the release. Are you ready? How do you know? Have you and your team really 
done due diligence with this one?
Stop Being So Annoying
There comes a point in the project where the rubber hits the road. For most 
product development projects, this is the big Power-On. For software proj-
ects, it’s the Release to Production environment. During this event, most of 
the project team is focused on executing a test plan, and there’s a lot riding 
on the outcome. Will this project be a go? Does the design work as intended? 
Or will there be a catastrophic failure? Inquiring minds all want to know, they 
want to know ASAP, and they expect the PM to be able to answer those ques-
tions PDQ. That’s a lot of pressure on the PM to be in the know and to be 
able to deliver the right message to anxious stakeholders.
Unfortunately, many PMs go about staying “in the know” the completely wrong 
way, vastly annoying their team in the process. They are constantly underfoot, 
crowding up the lab, offering lame suggestions for troubleshooting, making 
distracting chitchat with anyone around them, and just generally getting in the 
way of the real work. I remember having to tromp over to the stupid airlock 
14
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 14 | Is Your Team Ready to Release?
172
in the cleanroom to give a PM an update on the ongoing testing, because they 
were too lazy to go gown-up and enter the cleanroom properly. (Gee, appar-
ently I still have some pent-up frustration about that, huh?) I can recall PMs 
trying to help with troubleshooting a technical problem for which they really 
didn’t have expertise. Worse still, there’s that annoying dude in the back of 
the lab trying to engage someone in a blow-by-blow recount of the previous 
night’s episode of The Office. Bottom line? I’ve been the one doing the testing 
while the PM hovers over me like a West Texas thundercloud and it’s really 
annoying, so I don’t do that to my teams.
That’s right, during the Power-On or Production Release I try not to hover, 
I don’t offer troubleshooting suggestions, and I work really hard at keeping 
the distracting chatter to a minimum. What I focus on during these events 
is enabling the team. You see, I think it’s the PM’s job to make sure that each 
team member has what they need to carry out the testing. It’s not my job 
to do the testing though. So, here are a few Do’s and Don’ts for PMs during 
those “rubber hits the road” events:
Do
• 
Take care of all of the logistics. Reserve the lab space, submit 
the CRs, calendar the event, line up the grub, and so on.
• 
Double-check that all of the required personnel are available 
and are planning to be at the event. Extra points for round-
ing up the stragglers and getting them to the lab by the 
start time. (Yeah, I know that’s not technically your job 
but from my experience there’re always a few of these 
folks and if you want to start on time, someone—aka 
you!—needs to remind them that they have somewhere 
to be.)
• 
Pay close attention to the team dynamic. Is everyone work-
ing well together, or are they falling on each other like a 
pack of wild dogs? Is there someone who’s getting overly 
stressed out or defensive? A well-timed joke or some 
calm direction can go a long way to maintaining a pro-
ductive work environment.
• 
Watch the clock. Is the release going well? If it’s not, how 
late should the team work? At what point should you, 
as the PM, call a halt and declare this one a draw to be 
picked up another day?
• 
Facilitate a Go/No-Go decision as soon as possible once the 
testing is done.

173
Managing Projects in the Real World
• 
Be around but invisible. I try to be highly available to 
smooth the way, facilitate a decision, defuse an escalating 
argument, and so forth. But I know I’ve really got it right 
when my team isn’t really aware of my presence.
• 
Wrap up the testing event on a high note. If the testing was 
particularly difficult, remind the team how important this 
release is and congratulating them on staying the course. 
If it went smoothly, congratulate the team on flawless 
execution.
Don’t
• 
Wade into the discussion if you don’t have something of value 
to add—but make darn sure you understand the problem 
the team is trying to resolve and what compromises they 
take to resolve it.
• 
Distract the team with idle chitchat. They are there to do a 
job and they really don’t appreciate your loud and entirely 
too personal cell phone conversation.
• 
Be MIA. You need to be highly available during these activ-
ities. Telling the team to call you if they “need anything” is 
abdicating your responsibilities.
• 
Close the release activities on a down or sour note. Do not 
tell them they could have done better or that the design 
was crap. Most importantly, don’t single out an individual 
or functional group as the cause of a No-Go.
• 
Hover! You should be available and around, but you should 
not resemble a vulture waiting for roadkill to get still.
• 
Make a production out of lunch. Folks want to grab a 
quick bite and then get back to work. Also, be mind-
ful of the food you’re serving. For a release earlier this 
year I brought in Chicago-style pizza. Sure it was yummy, 
but then the guys started complaining about being really 
sleepy about 2 o’clock. D’oh!
So there you have it: some dos and don’ts for facilitating that big event. Just 
remember that it’s no longer your job to do the testing. Instead, you are there 
as a sort of fixer to make sure everything goes smoothly so the team can 
focus on their job—the actual testing.

Due Diligence
I really don’t believe it’s my job as the PM to inspect every work product my 
team produces and ensure that it’s to an acceptable level of quality. If you do 
that, then you run perilously close to becoming a mircromanager. That said, 
I think I’m absolutely on the hook, as the leader of the team, to ensure that 
due diligence is done.
So what do I mean by due diligence in the context of project management? As 
I see it, it’s the PM’s responsibility to ensure that the work is done sufficiently 
to avoid harm to others, the environment, and/or property. This means that 
enough work and research has gone into producing the project’s output that 
there’s a reasonable expectation of safety and performance to specifications.
This sounds pretty straightforward doesn’t it? Well, it’s not and to demonstrate 
this, let me tell you a little story. Let’s suppose that at one point in my career 
I worked in an engineering group and ran product development projects for 
them. This group was somewhat understaffed and certainly didn’t manage 
their project pipeline, so there was always more work than people. I’m sure 
you can relate. During the course of my first project in this org, I brought up 
the need for a basic safety review of the design. These projects produced a 
product that was distributed within the company as well as to external cus-
tomers. The engineering management team felt very strongly that no such 
review was needed. To be honest, I think the root cause of their opposition 
was the fact that they perceived an additional design review by an “outside” 
party as a roadblock that would only slow them down. They believed that 
what they were producing was a safe product and they didn’t need no stinkin’ 
safety engineer to tell them what they already knew. So they had their reasons 
and I could kinda see their point, but these were products used by people in 
development labs around the world and I just couldn’t reconcile waiving the 
safety review. Let’s just say that it was a long, frustrating battle that I won. 
Then again, they might have dropped those safety reviews after I left the org. 
Now I’m not trying to air dirty laundry or anything here, but rather I want to 
point out that this stuff can get murky and difficult.
Now, how do you as the PM ensure that due diligence is done on your proj-
ects? First you have to understand what your organization expects your team 
do with respect to compliance, safety, legal, design, validation, and so on. You 
should also understand what’s done in your specific industry. A safety review 
for a new software application is going to be quite different than one for 
a 300mm physical vapor deposition (PVD) process chamber. Now I’m not 
saying that you need to be the expert on the specifics of the safety review; 
rather, I’m saying that you need to understand what makes up the appropriate 
review and you need to ensure that it gets done as part of the project work. 
One way I do this is to make sure these items are tasks that are tracked 
within the project—that is, they are line items on the schedule. Further, I use 

175
Managing Projects in the Real World
a release readiness review checklist for every project. This checklist, which I will 
talk about in the next section, includes line items for anything I deem a due-
diligence requirement. This can span such things as manufacturing approving 
the project documentation that they will use going forward, to verifying that 
all quality defects are dispositioned appropriately.
Okay, let’s be honest here—this isn’t hard and all you really need to do is put 
some structure in place to ensure due diligence is happening. When the soft-
ware developers try to beg off of doing a peer review of their code, say no. Pay 
attention to the disposition of defects and the test coverage. Make sure that 
the users of project documentation agree that the documents are adequate. 
Track compliance requirements closely. Yeah, I know you’re already doing this 
stuff…see, I told you it was easy.
In my opinion, my professional reputation is on the line with each project and 
I have a responsibility to my team, the company, and myself to ensure that any 
project I lead produces safe and usable products—and that takes due diligence.
Release Readiness
Now let’s talk about one of those tricks of the trade every PM should know: 
how to do a release readiness review (RRR) or assessment. When you’re at 
the end of the execution phase, there’s a lot going on and your team is most 
likely getting ramped up to release the project. One of the key tools in a PM’s 
arsenal is a robust RRR. Over the years, I’ve participated in RRRs as robust 
as a day-long program review and as loose as a pencil-whipped checklist that 
forever resides in a bureaucratic black hole. One thing that became clearer as 
I gained experience was the fact that the better prepared the team was for a 
release, the smoother it went. One of the best ways to prepare for a project 
release, in my book, is to do a real readiness review. By real, I mean an honest, 
no-holds-barred team review of the work that’s been done and the work that 
remains before you unleash your project’s deliverable(s) on the world.
All RRRs come down to a checklist of some sort. Sadly, most organizations 
either don’t have one, or the checklist they do have isn’t very useful for the 
PM. To be effective, an RRR checklist needs to be specific to your project and 
its deliverables. It also needs to be specific to your organization and its proj-
ect lifecycle. When I join a new organization, I usually end up creating a more 
detailed checklist than is currently on offer. After creating a number of these 
checklists, I have developed a solid understanding of what they need to con-
tain. So, whether you’re trying to assess the usefulness of your org’s current 
checklist or you are trying to create a specific one for your current project, 
here are the key areas you need to think about when it comes to assessing 
how ready your project is for release:

Chapter 14 | Is Your Team Ready to Release?
176
• 
Development considerations. Are all of the required 
design and requirements documents updated to reflect 
the “as-designed” state of the project deliverables? Was 
due diligence observed—that is, was a peer review done 
on the design? Are the known limitations of the design 
adequately and properly documented? Have all required 
reviews (safety, OSHA, environmental, and so on) been 
completed?
• 
Testing due diligence. Are there any open, unresolved, 
high, or critical bugs? Are there any bugs without long-
term corrective action (LTCA) plans in place? Are all known 
defects documented in the appropriate tool of record? 
Were all of the requirements properly verified? Was the 
test coverage adequate to ensure a solid design?
• 
Release activities. Are the hardware/software needed 
for the release available and functioning as expected? Has 
the release been scheduled? Are the required personnel 
available on the day(s) of the release? Have the neces-
sary change requests and exit reviews been submitted or 
scheduled?
• 
Operations/manufacturing considerations. Has ade-
quate training been provided to the end users of the 
project deliverable(s)? Have the required documents 
(training, testing, operation, and so on) been reviewed 
and approved by the end user reps? Does manufacturing 
have an adequate volume of material in stock to meet 
anticipated orders? Have all of the operations/manufac-
turing business process tools been updated? Has the end 
customer been advised of any changes to order place-
ment or delivery?
Obviously there are other considerations depending on the nature of your 
project’s deliverables. You might need to think about post-release activities 
or marketing collateral. The point is to do a thorough review, so you should 
always tailor the checklist for each specific project.
I generally do a RRR a week before the planned release, and it’s the primary 
topic of that week’s standing team meeting. There are two other, second-
ary benefits to doing a RRR beyond making sure that all the ducks are lined 
up. First, it gives the recipients of the project deliverables one last chance to 
speak up if the quality of the deliverables is not up to their expectations. I 
make a point to ask the recipients if they agree that the work is done. This 
ensures that there are no surprises after the release. The other benefit is that 
review enhances and drives accountability with the team members. The entire 

177
Managing Projects in the Real World
team is accountable for the quality of the release and, more specifically, each 
team member will have deliverables they are accountable for. This review is 
the opportunity for each team member to stand up and be held accountable 
for his or her work.
Finally, for that first pass of the RRR checklist, I don’t expect all items to be 
closed. It’s not uncommon for a few things to be lingering, but every item on 
the checklist should have a clear closure commit date at this point. If you find 
items on the checklist that have been completely missed, then the team needs 
to seriously consider pushing out the release. It’s worth noting that while it’s 
extremely rare to find such a serious miss, it’s not uncommon to have final 
reviews such as legal and safety still open. At the end of the RRR, you should 
have a punch list of items that must be closed before the project can release. 
Everyone on the team has a clear idea of what’s open and where to prioritize 
their time. I do one last review a day or two before the release activities and 
give everyone on the team one last chance to voice any concerns or reserva-
tions about the release…this is the Go/No-Go for the release activity.
The Go/No-Go
Now I’ll talk about how to facilitate and conduct a Go/No-Go meeting. Make 
no mistake: this is where the rubber hits the road when it comes to project 
management. Orchestrate this meeting poorly and you and your team will 
spend weeks cleaning up the aftermath. This is one of those inflection points 
for team dynamics, and PMs would be smart to put their game face on for it.
We’d been working on this product development project since early February. 
It was a software security application that necessitated a very carefully planned 
and executed set of release activities. We started bright and early on Thursday 
and everything went smoothly. The hardware was proven out and the new 
application was successfully installed. We were ready to rock with the applica-
tion testing! Things continued to go smoothly and as planned throughout most 
of Friday. By lunchtime, the team and I smelled the sweet scent of unqualified 
success. Around 3 PM, things started unraveling. We started finding documen-
tation non-conformances and, while those need to be corrected, they really 
are not a big problem. Next we found one, two (yikes!), three medium-to-low-
priority software bugs. Still no big deal, but it was no longer the unqualified 
success I’d been envisioning. Then it happened—the fatal showstopper bug. 
Clearly there was going to be no release that day. By this point in time, every-
one was frustrated and my carefully nurtured, constructive team dynamic was 
balanced on a knife edge.
There comes a point in every project when the PM needs to facilitate a  
Go/No-Go meeting. Essentially this is the one moment the entire team has 
been working for. Is the product ready for prime time? If so, then it’s a Go.  

Chapter 14 | Is Your Team Ready to Release?
178
This is the moment of truth and, unless the data is extremely conclusive, 
there’s likely to be a heated discussion. It’s just a fact of life that there will 
sometimes be No-Gos as well. It’s true that you get better at dealing with it as 
you gain experience as a PM, but facilitating a No-Go decision is never easy.
Part of what makes the Go/No-Go meeting so challenging is the fact that 
your team has been working on this project for a long time and they justifi-
ably feel some pride in accomplishing their objective and delivering the prod-
uct. Hearing that No-Go is like being rear-ended on the drive home. It’s that 
frustrating and jarring. Further, you just don’t call someone else’s baby ugly, so 
when engineers hear others criticizing their creation they get a tad miffed. So 
if you’re in a situation like I was, you can understand that the meeting is sort 
of like a sweatin’ stick o’ dynamite just waiting to go off in your hand. So what 
do you do? Having danced the No-Go dance a few times, I’ve figured out some 
tactics for handling this type of meeting:
• 
Set the expectation for the discussions hard and fast. Begin 
the meeting by clearly stating that you aren’t interested 
(at that time) in solutions, root causes, potential causes, 
who may or may not have been slacking, or the like. 
Follow that by explaining the goal of the meeting, which 
is to determine if the release is a Go or a No-Go.
• 
Ask the technical lead or the test lead to summarize the 
release activity results. Here’s where you want to keep the 
discussion focused on data and not speculation. In my 
experience there’s a big difference between hardware 
and software projects at this point. Hardware projects 
will have a very clear set of passing criteria that are based 
on actual measurements; software projects have a set of 
tests that need to be executed with a predetermined 
quality level. Hardware exit/release criteria are quanti-
tative, whereas for software projects those criteria are 
more qualitative.
• 
Use a round table approach. Tell the team that you will 
go around the table and ask everyone if they believe the 
release is a Go. Ask those team members whose position 
is No-Go to state their primary concerns. Go around the 
table collecting input, but skip the project sponsor and 
save him or her for the last input.
• 
Keep the discussion focused on the two pieces of information 
requested—namely, Go/No-Go and primary concerns. 
You will have to use the rathole card and probably more 
than once. Remember, as the meeting facilitator your job 
is to keep the meeting focused and on track.

179
Managing Projects in the Real World
• 
Make the call. Remember that unless your team has been 
using the consensus decision-making model, this isn’t a 
democracy and not everyone’s vote counts equally. For 
instance, you should never go against your project spon-
sor’s vote. I always set my teams up to use consultative 
decision making because I find it to be the most efficient 
way to keep things going with the highest level of buy-in.
• 
Wrap it up decisively and make a solid attempt to bolster the 
team’s spirits in the event of a No-Go. I always thank every-
one for the huge amount of work that has gotten us this 
far. I also suggest that everyone put it away for the week-
end, stating that we’ll attack the problem fresh the next 
week. It’s important to remind people of their accom-
plishments, and it’s equally important to give the team a 
break before tackling whatever caused that No-Go.
The last thing you have to do, and you must do it right 
• 
away, is send out meeting minutes. You need to do this 
quickly because, trust me, word is gonna spread like a 
California wildfire. You need to get the facts out there to 
dispel any erroneous rumors that may spring up. 
Finally, a comment on role modeling and leadership. This meeting is always 
tense and can resemble that stick of dynamite. It’s up to the PM to role-model 
the behavior expected here. This is not the time to joke around, nor is it the 
time to multitask. It’s a serious decision, so act like it and I promise that your 
team will follow your lead. It’s also not the time to indulge in a witch-hunt or 
a blamefest. It’s time to put your game face on and be the professional PM 
you are.
Deliver It Late
Have you ever been in this scenario? Your project is now six weeks behind 
schedule and there’s just no way to catch up without ridiculous and heroic 
efforts from your entire team. Sure, you can deliver part of what was prom-
ised for this project, but the writing’s on the wall that only divine intervention 
is going to ensure that all of the committed deliverables are met. By now your 
team is tired—I mean, really exhausted both mentally and physically. They’ve 
got nothing left to give and you think you can motivate them into one final 
push toward the goal line? Uh huh… are you sure about that? When you get 
to this point on a project, it’s time to retreat and figure out what your next 
course of action should be.

Chapter 14 | Is Your Team Ready to Release?
180
Okay, hold on to your hats folks, ’cause what I’m about to suggest may sound 
a tad inflammatory. It’s time to consider delivering late. Yep, it just may be time 
to figure out some damage control. The natural tendency in this scenario is 
to rally the troops for one more push. Of course, we’ve all been there, and 
we already know that there’s no such thing as “one final push,” ’cause the 
pushing and shoving just keeps coming. But let me ask you this: have you ever 
considered the implications of delivering late? Not those implications! Yeah, 
we all know about ticked-off customers, disgruntled management, and smirk-
ing peers. The implications I’m referring to here are things all PMs should 
consider whenever they are developing recovery plans.
When the situation is already bad, like the one I described previously, the 
absolute last thing a PM should do is make it worse—but that’s often what 
happens, especially when the team is desperately trying to recover a slipped 
schedule. All the yelling, cajoling, and bribery in the world will only get you so 
far, and it’s going to hurt your relationship with the entire team. Unfortunately, 
when you and your team are in a real time crunch, things don’t always go as 
planned. People are tired and they are rushing around, so it’s not uncommon 
for mistakes to be made. Bad mistakes that show up later in some really 
unpleasant ways. Now’s the time to ask yourself what the consequences are 
for delivering late—and, face it, it might make a lot of sense to do so.
So when would I deliberately deliver a project late? It makes sense to deliver 
late when the customer can use a subset of the project deliverables immedi-
ately. If you partner with your customer, you can often find a partial solution 
that they can live with while giving your team some breathing room. A year 
from now, what will folks remember? The fact that your team was four weeks 
late or the fact that the deliverables are buggy, insufficient, or just gener-
ally crappy? Yep, from a long-term perspective, poor quality trumps on-time 
delivery every time, hands down. Now if my customer can’t accept a partial 
delivery, my team, the key stakeholders, and I must decide what’s more impor-
tant…schedule, scope, or quality.
If it’s schedule that dominates the triple constraint, then we go forward with 
that “one-last-push” strategy, knowingly burning out the team in that heroic 
effort to deliver something on time. Sometimes quality doesn’t come out on 
top and you’re going to knowingly put out a crappy product—which means 
that your team will have a lot more cleanup to do after the project release, so 
make sure that you negotiate to hold onto the team members long enough to 
close everything out. If scope is on the chopping block, then realize that you 
might need to tee up a second, follow-on project to complete the axed scope 
at a later date. But don’t fool yourselves here; it’s called the triple constraint 
for a reason and there’s no such thing as a free lunch. You just can’t have it all 
without detrimental impacts to your team members.
So, the bottom line here is that you should consider delivering late, because 
it just might make sense. I truly believe that you need a deliberate strategy,  

181
Managing Projects in the Real World
as opposed to just letting things play out as they will. Take the time necessary 
to understand your options, including an honest evaluation of all of them. 
Whatever you decide, it needs to be grounded in the business needs the proj-
ect is supposed to address. Anything less is a failure to manage the project.
On Time, Under Budget, Delivered as 
Promised…and Still a Failure?
Call me a cynic, but every time I hear someone spout, “on time, under budget, 
all requirements met,” I mentally roll my eyes. I seriously doubt that there are 
PMs out there who always deliver “successful” projects on time, under budget 
and still meet all of the value promised by the project. It’s not that I think the 
PMs are lyin’ like rugs; it’s that I don’t believe “on time” and “under budget” 
tell the whole story. You see, I know I’ve delivered projects on time, without 
spending more money than planned, all while meeting the original require-
ments…yet those projects were complete failures to my way of thinking.
So, what truly determines whether a project is a success? I think the answer 
lies in whether the business objectives of the project were met. I’m sure you 
don’t have to think too hard to come up with an example of a project that you 
and your team executed flawlessly, only to see it never take off in the market 
or users never adopt it. For me, there was the residual gas analyzer that we 
developed in conjunction with a vendor. It was a thing of technical beauty with 
a material cost that was downright seductive…but the effort to get it quali-
fied as a tool of record was an insurmountable hurdle. Conversely, there was a 
project on which the customer was positively delighted with our work, yet we 
delivered weeks late and let’s just say that the conformance to our internally 
required processes “could have been better.” That one was a runaway success, 
but you sure couldn’t tell it by the project metrics. Go figure.
There’s also another component to overall project success, which you rarely 
hear mentioned, and that’s what the project has done to the morale of the 
organization. We’ve all worked on projects where the pressure to meet a 
schedule could best be described as a meat grinder. Any PM who’s been prac-
ticing more than a few years has been in that uncomfortable position of hav-
ing to motivate a team to work weekends, holidays, and nights to recover a 
project schedule. This kind of project just kills your team’s morale. Worse, 
this kind of effort can frequently set a precedent for the pace of work or 
duration of future projects. If you also factor in the poor planning, monitor-
ing, and control that allowed the project to get so far behind as to require a 
Herculean effort to get it back on track, then you have the MacDaddy of all 
morale killers on your hands. If you eventually hit the schedule, deliver all of 
the requirements, and the customer is super-happy, is that a success? I’d say no, 
and it sure as shootin’ isn’t going to be repeatable.

Chapter 14 | Is Your Team Ready to Release?
182
So let’s say that you’re a PM with such a project. On paper it looks good—
“on time, under budget, all requirements met”—but you know down in your 
gut that it was not a success. This obviously doesn’t happen all that often, but 
when it does it’s pretty surreal. Everyone is singing your praises and your team 
has moved on to greater glory on some other project, but you just know it’s 
only a matter of time before the shiny wears off, and it becomes obvious that 
the business objectives of the project weren’t realized. What do you do? Well, 
this can be tricky, because you want to do due diligence and identify areas 
where more work is needed, but you don’t want to damage your rep or that 
of your team. First and foremost, you have to raise the flag and point out the 
issues and gaps with the way the project was released. Don’t be surprised if 
there are certain elements who refuse to see them, though. Do your best 
to get those gaps and issues fixed, then let it go and move on to your next 
project. Second, when you deliver the wrap-up review of the project, your 
story should go something like this: “The team did a stand-up job accom-
plishing a huge amount of work in a limited time, but there’s still more to do.”  
The goal here is to present your team as winners who “did a stand-up job” 
and some significant work, all while acknowledging that there’s more to do. 
Make sense?
I recently heard a talk at a local PMI event where the speaker pointed out 
that you need to understand the business drivers for each requirement. Fail to 
deliver those drivers and you really can’t call the project a success. Sometimes 
I think it’s easy to get distracted by a laser-like focus on schedule performance 
and lose sight completely of the business problem your project needs to 
solve. Sure, you can pull off the “on time, under budget, all requirements met” 
hat trick, but whether or not your project was a success really depends on 
how well the original business needs were met—so stay focused and make 
sure what you deliver really is a success.

Leading When 
the Music Stops
Ever been to a cakewalk? This was a quaint and rather popular social fundraiser 
when I was a kid. The idea here is that a table holding a delicious cake is placed 
in the middle of a circle of chairs. Participants walk around the chairs while some 
jaunty tune plays. The music is then stopped suddenly and everyone scrambles 
for a chair. The poor schmuck who’s left standing after the scramble loses; a 
chair is taken away, and the music is played again. This continues until there’s 
only one lucky winner sitting in the last chair and that guy goes home with the 
cake. In project management, the music stops and your project is the one left 
without funding or resources or support. What do you do then?
Yet Another Re-Org
Corporations reorganize and shuffle product roadmaps based on changing 
market conditions, and I’m betting that some of you are managing projects 
with suspect futures—or at the very least, with a scope of work that is in 
doubt. This type of ambiguity can really de-focus your team and that can be 
a very bad thing. For instance, on one of my projects, there’s been a lot of 
discussion as to whether or not a particular functionality will be cut by the 
customer. The last thing I want to happen is for my team to stop working 
on developing that functionality, only to find out four weeks later that the 
customer decided to keep it and now we are month behind schedule. When 
you are managing a project in this type of environment, you need to consider 
several things to ensure that your team stays focused and on track:
15
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 15 | Leading When the Music Stops
184
• 
Make sure the plan of record (POR) is crystal clear 
to the entire team. This sounds simple but, trust me, it’s 
not. There are probably a lot of hallway discussions and 
plenty of speculation in your team meetings, so it’s not 
surprising that someone would walk away with a different 
understanding of what the POR is today. To combat this, I 
make sure I communicate what the POR is in a very clear 
and succinct manner. I wrap up each team meeting by stat-
ing that the “POR has not changed, so let’s stay focused on 
what we need to accomplish right now.” Heck, I’ve even 
been known to state the POR directly in the meeting min-
utes if the team seems especially de-focused.
• 
Manage your stakeholders so that they are not 
adding to the general confusion and speculation. 
Here I coach the relevant stakeholders not to bring up 
potential scope changes to the team unless they have a 
high confidence that this new direction will become POR. 
Usually there are two stakeholders who are particularly 
bad about this: the technical lead and the engineering man-
ager. You see, they believe that they are helping the team 
by giving everyone a head’s-up. The unfortunate side effect 
of this head’s-up mentality is that you will have team mem-
bers who are honestly confused about what to work on 
or, worse yet, they will de-prioritize POR work since they 
believe it will be axed at some point in the near future. So, 
if some of your stakeholders are de-focusing your team, 
have a friendly chat with them and ask them to stop.
• 
Squelch the speculative conversations and keep 
the team focused on the schedule and what needs to be 
done next. It’s important to realize that until your POR 
officially changes, your team is still on the hook for their 
current customer commits. It’s very easy for a team in 
this environment to get sidetracked by a speculative con-
versation and totally derail your regular meeting. Do not 
let this happen!
Finally, if you aren’t already doing this, you need to 
• 
enforce 
stringent change control. Sometimes if you have a small 
colocated team you can be, shall we say, “a bit lax” on 
enforcing change control— but for the most part rigorous 
change control is very necessary. So whenever there’s a 
large scope change looming on the horizon, make sure that 
your entire team is actually following its change control 
process. Now you might think this is a no-brainer, right?

Wrong! What usually happens is that some team members 
are overachievers and they will inevitably start implement-
ing these scope changes before they are actually approved. 
Trust me on this one! I’ve seen this happen over and over 
again. On the one hand, it’s a good thing as it means that the 
change is implemented very fast. On the other hand, if the 
end decision is not to implement the change, somebody 
on your team needs to undo some work they’ve already 
finished in anticipation of the change going through. No 
one likes to tear apart something they’ve already built, so 
put the brakes on any work that’s not POR.
So there you have it, a few considerations for what you need to do to keep 
your team focused in an environment where the project or program scope 
is in flux. As for my team, we finally got clear direction from the higher-ups 
and I’ve already submitted a change request for the team to review. Onward 
toward the newly revised scope of work!
Breaking Up Is Hard to Do
I’m sure I’m not the only PM who’s found out a key team member is leaving  
the company. How we, as PMs, react when we find out one of our team 
members is leaving has a huge impact on the overall team dynamic. As I see 
it, there are three basic responses: pout like a three-year-old; pretend it’s not 
happening and/or pay minimal attention to who will pick up the work; or—the 
best by far—actively help make the teammate’s move as smooth as possible 
for both that person and the rest of the team. Sadly, I see more of the first two 
than the third. Obviously, this isn’t strictly limited to PMs, and it applies to all 
leaders and managers who interact with the person who’s leaving.
First, let’s talk about worst possible response—option #1: pout like a three 
year old. Incredibly I’ve seen this response more than a rational person 
would expect. There was the manager who gave the departing employee the 
silent treatment for two weeks, all while sitting directly across from the guy. 
Interestingly, the employee had struggled with the decision to leave until he 
got the cold shoulder from a boss who’d previously been very supportive. 
Funny how that response from his manager solidified the decision to leave the 
company. Then there was the program manager who felt personally insulted 
about my impending job change, even though it was a career move on my part. 
Again, that person’s reaction really helped me see that I was making the right 
decision. Sure, we all get upset and frustrated when we find out a key resource 
is leaving. How we handle that frustration is critical to maintaining a solid team 
dynamic. Do you really want to work on a project or in an organization in 
which the departing person is subjected to a vicious gauntlet on the way out? 
I don’t, and I refuse to allow that to happen on my teams.

Chapter 15 | Leading When the Music Stops
186
Almost as bad as pouting or open hostility is the second option: to pretend 
that it’s not happening. Burying your head in the proverbial sand will not 
change the fact that your teammate is leaving. As the PM, your job is to 
negotiate with the resource owners and work out a reasonable replacement. 
You’re also going to need to reassign some of the work to the rest of the team 
to make sure everything stays on track while the new person comes up to 
speed. This is PM 101 and failing to do it is just like the software engineer who 
neglects to follow coding standards. It’s sloppy and someone else will have to 
clean up your mess. Making sure there’s adequate coverage for the work is 
the absolute minimum you should do as a PM. Do you really want to work on 
the team that gets so far behind because someone left and work didn’t get 
done? Didn’t think so…
Yes, the best possible response is #3: to actively help make the teammate’s 
move as smooth as possible. As you support your teammate’s move, you are 
sending a clear message to your team that you want them to succeed in their 
careers. What kinds of things can you do to be supportive? Proactively reas-
sign work so that the leaving person has more time to focus on the things they 
need to do as part of leaving. This is pretty simple to do, and the goodwill this 
engenders from all involved is priceless. You should also arrange for some sort 
of team get-together to celebrate this change. It takes about 10 minutes to 
organize a self-funded happy hour but, trust me, the person leaving will greatly 
appreciate it. Finally, the most helpful thing you can do is offer to extend your 
network to help the departing person with his or her transition. Can you 
recommend SMEs for the new job? How about providing a list of cool restau-
rants, points of interest, things to do, and so forth in the new location? All of 
these things are fairly straightforward to do and will be greatly appreciated. 
Now, why wouldn’t you want to work on a team where the departing team 
member gets all the help she needs to make her next challenge easier?
When someone chooses to leave a team for a better opportunity, it really 
does matter how you manage that change. This is especially true for PMs 
because you can mitigate a very bad reaction from a functional manager just 
by being supportive. This makes a huge difference to the overall team dynam-
ics. You have a choice here. You can send a message to your entire team that 
you expect unswerving loyalty and traitors will be punished to the full extent 
of your ability. Or you can send the message that you fully support each team 
member and their individual career goals. Remember, this isn’t personal—
these people aren’t your team, no one is betraying you, and everyone needs 
to make career-changing decisions from time to time. Take a minute to think 
about the various job transitions in your own past, and I’m sure you’ll find 
some good examples of how to handle this in a positive way. In the end, 
it comes down to treating your departing teammates how you’d like to be 
treated in a similar situation.

How to Lead after the Music Stops
You’ve just left the program team meeting where it was announced that 
the funding has evaporated and the program is toast. You’re to keep your 
team focused until the end of the quarter, and then mothball the work. Oh, 
and while you’re at it, don’t mention the fact that the project is one of the 
walking dead to your team… don’t want to incite a panic, do we? Ever been 
there? That nauseated feeling you’re experiencing is just the precursor to all 
those awkward conversations you’ll have with your team, your boss, and your 
customers before the end of the quarter gets here. Been there, done that, 
don’t really want the T-shirt anymore. Or how about this: you’ve done the 
Disagree-and-Commit dance, you lost, and now you gotta lead right? What 
both of these scenarios have in common is a need for you to lead your team 
through something you disagree with. This is perhaps the most challenging 
scenario facing PMs. I should know—I’ve done it more than a few times and 
have come up with some observations about what does and doesn’t work. 
So here goes with How to Lead after the Music Stops:
• 
First, get your own head right. You fought the good fight and 
you lost. Get over it! Seriously, the last thing your team 
needs is your ardent soliloquy on why you are right and 
“Management” is wrong.
• 
Don’t make it personal. Sure it sucks and you feel bad but, 
trust me here, your team doesn’t want to hear that. 
They’re expecting leadership from you, not guilt. I once 
had a manager go on and on about how hard the decision 
was for him to make. I may be sorry about that fact, but 
I’m a lot more concerned about my own job stability.
• 
Remind yourself and your team what it is that you actually 
get paid to do. A former coworker of mine, a veritable RF 
genius, once told me that he looked at work as a trade-off. 
He was trading his time and ability for money. What John 
spent his time doing might or might not make sense to 
him, but he still benefited from the tradeoff. Sometimes it 
helps to remember that…just be careful how you remind 
others of that fact. No one likes to hear the equivalent of, 
“just be grateful you’ve got a job.”
• 
Paint the bigger picture. Organizations often make strategic 
decisions that seem half-baked on the surface. You need 
to help your team understand the strategy in play. Sure, 
it won’t make everyone’s concerns go away, but it will 
provide context and that’s a good thing.

Chapter 15 | Leading When the Music Stops
188
• 
Help the team get focused on what’s expected of them next. 
Which tasks need to be completed? When does the 
work need to be done? Who’s going to do it? You get the 
picture here: drive a course of action rather than endless 
whine fests.
• 
Figure out the “what’s-in-it-for-me” equation for yourself 
and your team. Even if you don’t like the new direction, 
chances are there’s something valuable there for you and 
your team. I’m talking new skills, contacts, opportunities, 
and the like.
• 
Be real. It’s honestly okay to say things such as, “I don’t 
know the answer to that,” “That’s a valid concern,” or 
even, “I wish I had a better answer for you on that one.” 
Then follow those comments up with the bigger picture 
and the “what’s-in-it-for-me” perspective.
Above all else, please 
• 
don’t abdicate your own accountability. 
It honestly turns my stomach to hear a senior person say, 
“I had nothing to do with that decision.” I’d respect them 
a lot more if they took some ownership of the decision, 
explained why the decision was made, and provided some 
insight into what would change going forward.
In that special case where you know something “bad” is 
• 
about to go down but you are directed to keep mum 
about it, well that’s just what you’re supposed to do. That 
doesn’t mean elaborate eye-rolling, grimaces, or other 
emotive facial expressions. Nor does it mean that you 
drop subtle (or not so subtle) hints about the impending 
doom. Rather, you must keep your trap shut. Really! It’s a 
matter of professional integrity.
• 
Develop some responses to the questions you expect and 
dread the most. Don’t forget to figure out a graceful way 
to say, “I can’t comment on that at this time”—because I 
suspect you’re gonna use that one a lot.
So there are my gleanings on how to lead when the music stops. To be honest, 
I didn’t always do these things. In fact, the “not doing” or the “doing it badly” 
times are how I figured out what works. Here’s hoping you can pick up a thing 
or two so you don’t have to struggle so much the next time you find yourself 
in this position.

You Really 
Ought to Be 
Doing This
There are a few things PMs should be doing at the end of a project, but I’d bet 
my lunch money that many of you don’t get to these tasks. The good news is 
that, while it can have a huge impact on how cleanly a project is wrapped up, 
none of these tasks is very difficult or time-consuming. Let me show you what 
you really should be doing at the end of a project.
Formal Project Closure
Project closure is one of those often-neglected areas of project management 
and that’s a shame because it’s not hard, doesn’t take much time, and it’s just 
good project management. Project teams usually dissolve like sugar stirred 
into iced tea at the end of a project. After a few swirls of the spoon, you’d 
never know the sugar was there, but after the ice stops swirling, you see this 
sugary residue collect at the bottom of the glass. On a project, this means that, 
although the team has all been reassigned, there are still these niggly things 
that remain undissolved, if you will. For instance, not all the data gets archived, 
thereby completely negating the efforts it took to generate it in the first place. 
There’s usually only a token effort made to disposition the hardware used or 
developed. How many orphaned, dust-catching project remnants are sitting 
around your cube right now? More than you want, I bet! Worst of all are the 
cases in which the project just doesn’t die for some of the team members.

Ever have to answer questions or provide support for something you finished 
a year ago? These are the consequences of not formally closing a project.
As the PM, it’s your responsibility to perform project closure—just ask PMI if 
you don’t believe me! Unfortunately, a lot of organizations don’t document a 
closure process, so it’s often hard to know what to do. Here’s what I do, at a 
minimum, to close a project:
• 
Request that all team members review any data they have on 
their respective hard drives and archive it appropriately.
Tip
■
■
 
If you are doing this via email, provide the link to increase the likelihood that it 
actually happens.
• 
Go through your files and email to ensure that you’ve archived 
any critical project decisions, presentations, meeting minutes, 
and so forth.
Tip
■
■
  I create a directory on my hard drive specifically to dump all of this stuff into during 
the project. When I find the time, I just open the file and start uploading. This is a great Friday 
afternoon activity because it requires very little brainpower!
• 
Disposition all of the hardware acquired or generated by the 
project. If you can’t find it a home, then make sure it gets 
scrapped appropriately.
• 
Perform some sort of lessons-learned or retrospective. While 
I’m not a fan of the bureaucracy that these processes 
often entail, I do believe it’s worth spending an hour or so 
as a team discussing what went well, what didn’t, and any 
best practices that should be communicated to others.
• 
Send out a formal project closure announcement. You should 
do this in addition to a final project presentation.
Tip
■
■
  Be sure to identify any post-project sustaining support so your team members are off 
the hook… for the most part!
• 
Sincerely thank each team member and coordinate appropriate  
recognition.

Managing Projects in the Real World
191
Finally, take this opportunity to 
• 
ask some (or all) of your 
team for feedback on your performance. Everyone is pretty 
mellow at this point, so it’s a good chance to get some 
thoughtful feedback and identify areas for improvement.
As you can see all of these items are pretty quick to do. Obviously, if your 
organization has a documented process, you’d follow that—but if not, then  
I hope this list helps.
How to Throw a Party
As Q4 comes to a screaming finish, PMs should be thinking about organizing a 
year-end celebration for their teams. December is usually a tough month for 
project work as there are always big milestones committed at the end of the 
year. PMs are crazy busy and, for many, taking the time to plan a celebration  
is just too far down the priority list to matter. I’m here to tell you that you 
really need to re-prioritize! Holiday or year-end celebrations can be very 
easy to pull off and they are one of the best ways to show your team your 
appreciation. Okay, I know what you’re thinking: “Very easy to pull off? Is she 
delusional? I don’t have the time for that!” I’m serious and you really can find 
the time to do this!
First let me break down how to organize a celebration for your team:
1.	 Determine what type of event you want to throw. A lunch is 
the easiest thing to do and will be the most convenient 
for the team and anyone else you want to invite.
2.	 Determine funding. Ask anyone in a position to funnel 
some cash your way to pay for the event—including your 
project sponsor, manager, and, heck, even your second-
level manager.
3.	 Determine where to party. This can be as simple as a con-
ference room in your building, or as extravagant as your 
budget and good taste allow.
4.	 Determine the food. There’s something primal about break 
ing bread together, and what’s a party without food? Be 
sure you consider silverware, plates, napkins, and so forth, 
and don’t forget to have at least one vegetarian option.
5.	 Determine some sort of activity but keep it small. The best 
activity I’ve found is to post some flip charts around the 
room with questions such as “What was the hardest thing 
we accomplished this year?” and “What was the funniest 
thing that happened this year?” Everyone can walk around 
and jot down their answers and read those already posted.

Chapter 16 | You Really Ought to Be Doing This
192
6.	 Ask key sponsors and stakeholders to swing by and say a few 
words. Give others the opportunity to thank your team 
for their hard work, too.
Still not convinced you have the time and brain cells free to do this? Okay, here’s 
what is probably the easiest, cheapest, and fun-est (okay, I know that’s not a real 
word but work with me people!) team celebration I have ever done:
1.	 Lunch in the large conference room plus a calendar 
invite—took all of 10 minutes to do.
2.	 Couldn’t drum up official funding but the super managers 
from my org each coughed up $20. Took about an hour 
to collect. ☺
3.	 Ordered takeout pizza, took ruthless advantage of 
coupons, and picked it up ourselves. We also didn’t use 
any cutlery or plates except for a large stack of napkins 
raided from the café—about 1 hour total (ordering plus 
pick up).
4.	 Did that flip chart thing I mentioned above and it was a 
hit with the team: about 5 minutes tops.
5.	 At the lunch I spent about 5 minutes thanking the team 
for their efforts, recapping what we’d accomplished that 
year, and thanking the managers for their generosity.
Bottom line? I spent about 3 hours organizing the lunch, resulting in a decent 
celebration for 50+ people for around $80. Not too shabby, if I do say so 
myself. See, I told you that you could do this!
There are plenty of nice things that come from taking the time to celebrate 
with others, but for me the best part is being able to express my gratitude 
to my coworkers for the many extraordinary things they do all year long.  
I encourage you to carve out a couple of hours and organize a year-end 
celebration for your team this year. It’s easy, can be done cheaply, and is just 
one more way to show your appreciation for your team.
Feed ’em Well
Now I’d like to spend some ink on how to organize food for your project 
teams. You may think you’ve got this handled and that there’s nothing left to 
learn. You’d be wrong. I know this because each of these dos and don’ts I’ve 
figured out the hard way. The hard way to feed a team involves a lot of e-mail, 
drama, time, and logistical feats that would make FedEx proud. Been there and 
had the stomachache to prove it! ☺

Managing Projects in the Real World
193
Don’t …
• 
Have a theme, any theme, any of them at all, especially if 
it involves decorations, costumes, or cute hats. Trust me, 
not everyone owns (or wants to own) a Hawaiian shirt, 
women object to pirates referring to them as wenches, 
and no one wants to wear the Birthday Boy hat!
• 
Try to organize a formal sit-down dinner. There are pro-
fessionals for that and no matter how good you are 
at Project, this probably isn’t your area of expertise. 
Remember, you have a day job and it’s probably not Party 
Planner Extraordinaire!
• 
Plan on doing everything yourself. A primary reason for 
feeding the team is to continue to develop a collaborative 
team dynamic. To do this you need to provide opportu-
nities for the team members to work together. Sharing  
the work to get the food together is an easy way to do this.  
Have someone own the beverages and someone else the 
plates, napkins, and the rest.
• 
Offer configurable options. Want to make a simple lunch 
run into a major time sink? Take orders for individual 
sandwiches. Also, consider this: if it’s configurable, then 
the likelihood that someone’s order will get jacked up 
increases. Do you really want to peel the vegan off the 
wall if their sandwich inadvertently contains cheese?  
I didn’t think so!
Do…
• 
Be sure you have offerings for vegetarians, carnivores, and 
those trying to eat healthy. You should also know if team 
members have any special food preferences and try to 
accommodate them within reason. Despite what the 
menus say in all the BBQ joints in Texas, not everyone 
eats meat!
• 
Change it up and don’t do the same takeout pizza every time. 
This is where you can really set yourself apart from the 
pack. Get creative and try to patronize local businesses. 
Sandwich trays, burritos, and fajitas are all good options 
for a group meal.

Chapter 16 | You Really Ought to Be Doing This
194
• 
Pizza is by far the easiest way to go when you need a low 
hassle, cheap food option. At its easiest is your standard 
delivery pizza, and you can usually score some discounts 
if you order more than four or five pies. Another option 
is a local pizza joint where the pizza is probably better, 
but you will need to go pick it up. If you want super-cheap, 
I’ve yet to find anything cheaper than Costco pizzas, but 
again someone has to pick them up.
• 
Limit the extras. Food that can be eaten without plates, 
such as pizza, sandwiches, and burritos are all good 
choices because you don’t need to make arrangements 
for plates or cutlery. Along the same lines, don’t plan on 
drinks that need individual cups or ice.
Speaking of 
• 
drinks, limit the number of choices here, too. 
Frankly, anymore I just pick up cases of cold bottled water. 
Everyone drinks water, and you don’t have to worry about 
what to do with leftovers.
If you have a large group to feed, 
• 
enlist the admin for help. 
Note that this does not mean palming the whole thing 
off on them. Instead, do the homework and figure out 
specifically what you want. Talk to the admin (in person is 
best) and get their agreement to help. Follow that up with 
a short, succinct email stating what you want them to 
order, where to order it, and when you need the food hot 
and available. The goal here is to make it as easy as pos-
sible for the admin to help you so that when your next 
time comes around you can still call on them for help.
I’d be remiss if I didn’t discuss the elephant under the rug when organizing 
food for your team. The reality is that you will need to drum up funding or 
pay for the food yourself. This is an entirely personal choice and there may 
be a good reason to open up your own wallet. To be honest, I’ve never been 
turned down if I’ve asked a manager to pay for food. I’ve also paid for lots 
of donuts, breakfast burritos, and the like myself. In Chapter 3, I extolled the 
power of the burrito as a motivational tool and the first time I brought them 
in, I paid for them myself. Nowadays, my boss tells me to expense them and 
he gets it that it’s not about free food but about motivating the team. You see, 
for a project manager, sometimes that box of donuts is just a tool, not unlike 
that book on statistical methods you picked up for your last project.
Finally, when it comes to who pays, it’s always best to praise the bosses when 
they pay and then say nothing when you pay yourself. I’ve been to more than 
one lunch where the program manager has a martyr syndrome about buying 
everyone lunch. Geez, I didn’t know that free lunch was gonna cost me an

hour of whining. Kinda defeats the whole purpose of feeding the team in the 
first place, doesn’t it?
I hope this has given you some actionable tips on how to feed your team. 
Breaking bread together is a fundamental bonding moment for humans, and 
it’s a good tool for any PM. Just remember, if you hate dealing with this kind 
of thing, then maybe you’re making it harder than it has to be; hopefully these 
tips will make it easier. As Julia says, Bon appétit!
Recognition 101
So, out of curiosity, how many individuals have you recognized this year? Five? 
Ten? Twenty? And how did you recognize them? I just submitted nominations 
for a couple of awards and it occurred to me that I should have submitted 
more of these bad boys this year. So here’s the scoop.
Before we jump into the mechanics of the deal, let’s revisit the basics: 
Recognition 101, if you will. First, it’s vitally important to recognize others 
whenever they contribute significantly to your work, the project, the team, the 
community, and so on. Besides just thanking someone for help, formal recogni-
tion can also be a very effective motivation tool. It needs to be formal, it needs 
to be sincere, and it needs to be a response to something significant. This is 
a bit more than a heartfelt “thank you!” you tell someone in response to that 
fresh cup of coffee right before the 7 AM meeting.
Okay, at this point I have to jump up on my soapbox for a second, so please 
bear with me (or skip to the next paragraph if you don’t want to hear the 
rant). If you want to genuinely recognize someone and have it mean something, 
then it needs to be for something significant. Every time I hear about someone 
being recognized for basically doing their job, a little bit of my belief in the 
system dies. All those awards for delivering a fix to a system on time just kill 
me—especially in those instances in which the team fixing the problem actu-
ally created it earlier…for which they probably got an award for being on time, 
too! You see I think those awards for “breathing on the project” take away from 
the recognition of those doing something truly phenomenal. The way I see it,  
I get paid every two weeks to do my job. If I spend a bunch of my personal time 
(yeah, yeah, yeah, I know…I’m salary) working on a project to meet an insane 
schedule for a critical product, then that’s worthy of additional recognition.  
If I come up with a wildly innovative way to solve a problem that has everyone 
else stumped, then that’s worthy of additional recognition. If I properly imple-
ment someone else’s design—aka reuse it and deliver that work on time—well 
then, I’m just doing my job. I shouldn’t be recognized as though I came up with 
an innovative solution. In short, every bit of recognition for “doing my job” just 
demeans any recognition I might get for the “above and beyond” efforts later. 
Okay, rant over…back to your regularly scheduled programming!

Chapter 16 | You Really Ought to Be Doing This

Now let’s talk about the mechanics of recognizing someone. Some folks find 
it extremely difficult to write up an award nomination. Unfortunately, this is a 
critical skill for PMs. It really isn’t that hard, so let me break it down for you—
Melanie’s Tips for Writing Up an Award Nomination for yours truly:
1.	 Set the context. Your first sentence should provide some 
sort of background to demonstrate how significant my con-
tribution is. Make this short and sweet ’cause most of the 
recognition tools severely limit the number of characters 
 you can use to describe the accomplishment.
2.	 Be specific. What exactly are you recognizing me for? 
You need to be able to write down two-three sen-
tences that articulate what exactly I did that is worthy of 
recognition.
3.	 Say “thank you.” Say something like, “Melanie, your contri-
bution to Planet Blue is invaluable and we just couldn’t go 
on without you!” Oh, and it goes without saying that this 
part needs to be sincere, too.
4.	 Somewhere you need to work in the individual’s actual 
name…in short, make it personal.
5.	 Pick out which of your company values apply to this recognition. 
Frankly, you can tie almost anything to one of those values  
and, if you can’t, then you really need to ask yourself if this 
is worthy of recognition.
There you go, some specific steps for crafting meaningful recognition. Do you 
know which tool your organization uses for awards and recognition? If not, 
then I strongly recommend you find it…and start using it! Recognizing your 
team members for outstanding work should be one of those sharp tools in 
your PM Toolbox. If you find them difficult to write up, then block out some 
time and practice writing up awards…and feel free to submit any with my 
name on them if you need practice using the tools!

Is Project 
Management 
Right for You?
I’m often asked about project management as a profession and, because I love 
the work, I tend to gush enthusiastically. However, all that wild enthusiasm 
can be a bit misleading. Like any profession, project management has its ugly 
parts, so here I thought I’d share some of the things I wish someone had 
told me before I started down this road. Oh, I still would have pursued this 
career…I just would have been a bit more prepared to do so if I’d heard 
this stuff.
The Difference between a Project Manager 
and a Program Manager
Are you a project manager or a program manager? For a lot of people out there, 
the difference between these two roles is murky at best. To prove my point, 
take a minute and look at your business card, your e-mail signature, and your 
official job title. I’m going out on a limb here and guessing that they don’t all 
three match. Further, I’d bet that at least one of them defines your job as a 
program manager. Over the course of my career I’ve had for official job titles 
project manager, program manager, and operations manager, but the job has con-
sistently been that of a project manager.

A program is not a project. According to PMBoK, a project is “a temporary 
endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result,” whereas 
a program is “a group of related projects managed in a coordinated way to 
obtain benefits and control not obtained from managing them individually.”1
I’ve dabbled in program management enough to know that, while the skills are 
similar, they aren’t exactly the same. A project manager is like the lead roadie 
for a rock band. That’s the person making sure all the equipment is set up cor-
rectly so the band can perform. A program manager is the person making sure 
that Mick actually shows up for the performance, that the venue is booked, 
that the roadies know what to do when, that the T-shirts have the correct pair 
of lips on ’em, and so on. Both roles are important but quite different.
When you are the project manager, you have the luxury of being able to pay 
attention to all the minute details that contribute to the deliverable. You can 
remember the specific part numbers and due dates and deep dive into all of 
the technical challenges. You also have the time to develop strong collaborative  
relationships with all of your team. It’s sort of like living on a tropical island and 
all you have to do is represent your tribe to the greater world.
When you are the program manager, time is at a premium and, frankly, you 
have to let go of some of your inner control-freak tendencies. There’s just 
no way to do a good job if you’re constantly deep-diving into each project 
under the program’s umbrella. Further, it’s quite likely that you won’t know all 
of the people working on your program. The program manager has to figure 
out how to get things done through multiple layers of management and that 
means that you must excel at influence and motivation to get any particular 
project team to react the way you’d like. Even small changes at the program 
level can have huge and unintended consequences if you’re not careful. If a 
project manager is an island chieftain, then the program manager is the sena-
tor from Hawaii, representing all of the islands in the archipelago at a much 
higher level.
So, which one are you? Project manager or program manager? If your job 
description is wrong, then you should definitely be discussing this with your 
boss, in preparation for your performance review this year. If your email 
signature doesn’t truly represent the job you’re doing, then go change it right 
now. Do the same for those business cards. Trust me, the people who will 
notice and care about your job title are definitely going to notice if you’ve got 
it wrong. Yes, this is a minor thing, but sometimes it’s the minor things that 
contribute the most to others’ perceptions of your competence.

Managing Projects in the Real World

Stuff No One Tells You Before You Begin
Inevitably, there comes a time when you need to decide if you like project 
management enough to continue doing it for a while. This is the working stiff’s 
equivalent of, “What do I want to do when I grow up?” Recently, someone at 
this crossroads sent me an email asking to pick my brain. As I responded to 
the query, it got me thinking about how I made that decision. I also recalled 
a few things I wish someone had told me—you know, the things you end up 
learning the hard way? So, in an attempt to help anyone out there considering 
whether or not they want to make project management a long-term career, 
here are a few things to consider:
1.	 If you don’t deal well with ambiguity, then don’t go down the 
PM path. Seriously, a good PM has an above average tol-
erance for ambiguity. She can work in environments in 
which the requirements, goals, timelines, and so forth 
are undefined. I mean really undefined, as in, “It’s anyone’s 
guess when that stuff will get nailed down.” Be brutally 
honest with yourself because it’s not enough to be func-
tional in a highly ambiguous environment; you really need 
to love working that way. If you don’t love it, then you will 
constantly find yourself stressed out and miserable.
2.	 You’ve heard it muttered more than once: “All of the respon-
sibility and none of the authority” (see the next section). That’s 
the name of the game when it comes to project management.  
I have yet to run across a program or project team at Intel 
in which everyone working on the effort directly reports 
to the PM. It ain’t gonna happen, so if you’re a person who 
prefers direct control, think about a career in management, 
not project management. To be a successful PM, you need 
to excel at motivation, inspiration, and empathy.
3.	 Be a recovering control freak. A PM needs to have the 
control-freak tendencies to be a good leader, but also 
be able to let go and let the teams do the work however 
best suits the team. I once was a demon control freak 
and everything had to be done the right way, aka my way.  
I found myself working crazy hours and essentially doing a 
lot of work that wasn’t PM work. It wasn’t until I let go of 
the control over how the work got done that I was able 
to work reasonable hours. For me, the number of hours 
I was putting in had a direct correlation to how much 
control I could not let go of. If you find yourself redoing 
another team member’s work, then you really need to 
step back and ask yourself if you truly want to be a PM.

Chapter 17 | Is Project Management Right for You?

4.	 Do you want to lead people but not deal with the HR headaches  
of managing direct reports? If so, then project management  
might be the career for you. I was once on a panel with 
other PMs talking about the profession. Hands down  
we all agreed that the best part of being a project manager  
was not having to address those messy HR issues. You 
get to have all of the fun while being able to hand off the 
really nasty work to someone else.
5.	 This brings us to what I think of as a harsh reality of project  
management: You will only rarely get recognized for your own 
efforts, but you will constantly recognize others for their 
contributions. If you need to see your name shining up on 
the big screen, then this may not be the career for you.  
I don’t think you can do a good job leading others if you’re 
constantly trying to gain recognition for your own per-
sonal efforts. Be sure you can live with this reality before 
fully committing to project management, because if you 
can’t deal with it, you will never be the kind of leader your 
teams need.
6.	 Can you take it on the chin and still grin? (Euphonious turn 
of phrase, huh? ☺) As a PM, you will need to admit to 
“dropping the ball” occasionally. Further, you will need to 
admit to your team’s screw-ups, both real and imagined. 
To be the kind of PM you want to work with, you abso-
lutely cannot name names or otherwise throw others 
under the bus. You will have to stand up to that GM and 
say, “I take full responsibility for that big failure.” Can you 
do that? If not, then do us all a favor and find some other 
profession to pursue.
7.	 Figuring out how people work and what motivates them is 
possibly one of the greatest puzzles of all time. If trying 
to solve that puzzle turns your crank, then you might 
become a great PM. Personally, I reached a point in my 
career where I found the technical challenges weren’t 
doing it for me anymore. I needed new puzzles and I found 
them in understanding, motivating, and leading others.
8.	 A serious PM gets certified through PMI. I’m not saying that 
a PMP certification will make you a better project man-
ager, but I am saying that if you’re serious about this as a 
profession, then you need to demonstrate that through 
mastering the recognized best practices.

Managing Projects in the Real World

I hope these items have given you some food for thought. Personally, I find 
project management to be a career choice that is well suited to my strengths 
and the types of activities I like doing at work. That may not be the case for 
you, so spend some time thinking about what you love and hate about being 
a PM, then make a choice. Remember, work should be something you enjoy, 
because you spend most of your waking time at it.
The Mirage of Positional Authority
One year at the PMI Global Congress, I picked up a button that said, “All of 
the RESPONSIBILITY…none of the AUTHORITY.” This is so true of project  
managers and it gets to the heart of why project management is so challenging. 
You see, you have to lead a team even though you don’t have positional authority  
over your teammates. This is something PMs struggle with a lot early in their 
careers. Most of us are hungry for tips and tricks on how to lead a team without  
that silver bullet, positional authority.
Now, there are quite a few of those tips and tricks out there to help you 
manage a team without positional authority, but frankly none of them is going 
to help you until you get your head right. Yep, proven techniques are all well 
and good, but until you change your perspective, you’re still going to wind up 
frustrated with that slacker circuit designer who won’t get her work done. If 
you think that the reason you can’t get your teammates to do certain tasks is 
that you lack positional authority, then I think you’re missing the point. You’re 
most likely struggling because you are unable to motivate them to do that 
task. So what am I talking about?
You have to fully internalize the fact that long-term success in getting work 
done through others is grounded in motivation. Any leader who can’t moti-
vate his or her team isn’t really leading; they’re just playing at being the boss. 
Further, any leader who uses negative motivation to get work done is doomed 
to failure sometime in the not-too-distant future—and it won’t be “in a galaxy 
far, far away.” So, bottom line? You have to get a lot better at motivation to lead 
a team. That positional authority you think you need? Well, that’s just a crutch. 
While positional authority could make your life easier in the short term, if 
you can’t motivate a team, then even positional authority won’t help you. So, 
if you’re telling yourself that you aren’t successful because you don’t have the 
authority, then I suggest you go talk to someone who’s a great leader. I’m bet-
ting that they’ll tell you the same thing I am: it’s not the positional authority 
but the ability to motivate that matters most.
Sure, there’s more to great leadership than motivation, such as trust, influence, 
and sound judgment. But realize that to be successful at motivating others, 
you need those skills, too—so again, it all circles back to motivation. I’ve man-
aged projects and programs in which I was the anointed leader and, in the 

Chapter 17 | Is Project Management Right for You?
204
end, that positional power didn’t matter much. I figured out real quick that 
to be successful I had to motivate my teams to do the work and, trust me, 
that had nothing to do with my positional power. I keep that button from the 
PMI Global Congress in my cube for one simple reason—to remind me that 
blaming my lack of effectiveness on a lack of authority is a cop-out. If my team 
misses a critical deadline, then I know that in some part I wasn’t as effective 
at motivating them as I needed to be, and that’s on me, not on my lack of 
positional authority.
So what do you think? If you really had that silver bullet—positional power—
would that make you a better PM? Would it ensure that your projects came 
in on time and under budget? Would you really be doing anything differently 
than you do today? Me, I think I’d be managing my projects pretty much the 
same way I do now without that positional authority.
How Technical Do You Need to Be?
A common question people have about project management is, “Just how tech-
nical do you need to be to be considered successful as a project manager?”  
They are, of course, talking about managing technology projects. Frankly,  
I believe that being technically competent is only a small part of what it takes.
First, let me clarify what I mean by being considered technical. People are con-
sidered to be technical if they have worked in an engineering discipline and 
can talk intelligently about various engineering challenges and best practices. 
But this is a subjective assessment, completely dependent on who’s judging 
you. I’ve been told before that I wasn’t technical enough, yet I have plenty of 
professional experience as a practicing engineer and an MS…seems pretty 
technical to me. ☺
What these people were really telling me was that they didn’t think I was 
technical enough in their specific engineering discipline. For the most part, 
these people were right. I can’t design high-speed electronics or a show-
erhead for a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process chamber, but I can 
understand those unique design challenges. That understanding is at the 
heart of what makes a good technical PM. You must be able to understand 
what the scope of work entails, what the challenges are, and how to explain 
these things to all levels of the organization. Trust me, the GM doesn’t want 
to hear about ground loops and impedance-matching any more than the 
engineering manager wants to hear a high-level summary highlighting revenue 
projections for the next ten years. The job of the PM is to accurately deliver 
the information each person needs to do his or her job, in the appropriate 
level of detail.

Managing Projects in the Real World
205
For me, the most important factor for a successful technical PM is communi-
cation skills. As the PM, I often feel like I work at the UN, translating what the 
electrical engineering (EE) expert is saying to the materials expert, and vice 
versa. It often seems like the two speak completely different languages. The 
PM needs to understand the languages of each discipline represented on a 
project team. In addition to understanding all of these languages, you need to 
be constantly vigilant that everyone involved in the conversation understands 
each other. Your job as the PM is to be the facilitator of the information flow 
and not the technical expert.
Does this mean you don’t need a technical degree then? No, not really—you 
see, you really do need the ability to think critically and the concepts a tech-
nical degree teaches you. Having that technical degree won’t guarantee your 
success as a technical PM, because the degree alone isn’t enough. To be suc-
cessful you need practical, hands-on experience, just as in any other field. But 
remember, your field isn’t an engineering discipline; it’s project management 
and that’s where you need to be most competent. You can still be successful 
as a project manager in the many non-technical disciplines. If you really like 
project management but don’t have the technical degree, then focus on finding 
a niche outside the engineering disciplines where you can be successful.
Finally, if you are considered highly technical in one field, are you also techni-
cal in another? Again, that’s really a subjective measure, but I can say that I’ve 
successfully switched engineering disciplines as a PM three times now. At each 
point, I had to start over and seek out background engineering information. 
This can be hard, especially if you’re not comfortable admitting that you don’t 
know something. The key to these transitions is a solid base of project man-
agement skills. I can focus on coming up to speed on the technology, because 
I can do the PM stuff blindfolded.
Bottom line:
Do you have to be technical to be a good PM? No.
Do you need a technical degree to be a good technical PM? Yes, but it probably 
doesn’t have to be in any specific discipline if you’re willing to start over 
occasionally.

Are You  
a Professional?
So often PMs fall into the profession and it’s only later that they realize that it 
is in fact a profession. Many fields have global professional organizations that 
manage certifications and provide numerous resources to members. For PMs 
this organization is the Project Management Institute (PMI). But simply being a 
PMI member isn’t enough, nor is it enough to hold one of its credentials. No, 
to be a professional PM requires much more.
What It Means to Be a Professional  
Project Manager
What constitutes professionalism in a project manager? This question some-
how gets lost in the day-to-day hustle and bustle of work, but it’s something you 
should be considering if you’ve decided to specialize in project management as 
a career. So, what does it mean to be a project management professional (PMP).
In the course of gaining your PMP accreditation (or any other PMI accredita-
tion for that matter), you have to agree to uphold the PMI Code of Ethics and 
Professional Conduct. In fact, it’s a bit stronger than that… you sign on the 
dotted line indicating that you will adhere to the Code and you will report 
anyone else who does not. Among other things, the Code requires that we 
negotiate in good faith, that we “inform ourselves and uphold the policies, 
rules, regulations, and laws that govern our work,” and that we do not engage 
in behavior that is meant to deceive. These are all straightforward, right? But 
let me ask you this: how often do you cut corners and not do a gate review? 
Isn’t that an expectation of your organization or local project management 
18

Chapter 18 | Are You a Professional? 
208
office (PMO)? What about negotiating with vendors? Do you actively rein in 
an overzealous teammate who is no longer negotiating in “good faith”? When 
I received my PMP certification, this Code was one page, but today it’s much 
longer and much more detailed. If you haven’t read it in a while, you should 
take the time to do so. In my book, anyone who does not fully follow the cur-
rent Code is not a PMP.
Now let’s take this a step further. Are you demonstrating your mastery of 
project management best practices daily? Do your projects have schedules 
that were built from network diagrams and leveled resources? What about 
risk management? Are you actively managing risks on all of your projects? 
How often do you use established statistical estimation techniques? These 
are just a couple of examples of applying best practices—not just in special 
cases, but daily, and not just because you are required to do it, but because it’s 
the best way to manage the project. Sure, foregoing any of these things does 
not make you a bad PM, but I’d argue that not using best practices is a sign 
that someone is not a professional. Okay, I do have a caveat here: If you fully 
understand and normally use the best practice, but for your specific project 
some other technique works better, then in that case I’d say that was profes-
sional behavior.
So what does a PMP look like? One characteristic that’s always present in true 
professionals is a passion for the job and the field of project management. 
These are the folks who know what’s going on in the industry and what the 
hot new ideas are. They are the people who recommend books, articles, blogs, 
and so on and always know what other PMs around the company and at other 
companies are doing. In short, they bring the new ideas and they play with new 
techniques to see if they can make them work. These are the folks you go 
bounce ideas off of ’cause you know they’ve got some ideas of their own to 
share. I once heard a senior software engineer discussing what professional-
ism means in his area of expertise. He basically said that if you have no passion 
for the work, then he isn’t going to spend his energy helping you along. Ouch! 
In a way I agree with him. If you’re not willing to understand what’s going on in 
your field, then I know at least ten others who are, and that’s where I’ll spend 
my time and energy. If you’re just showing up for a paycheck, that’s fine—but 
don’t call yourself a professional.
I really do hope you’ll take the time to really read and think about the PMI 
Code of Ethics and Professional Behavior. Are you upholding the Code? 
Could you do more? When’s the last time you hit projectmanagement.com 
or a meeting of your local PMI chapter? If it’s been a while, consider this your 
wake-up call to get back in the game!

Project Management Professional
I’m often asked about the PMI’s PMP certification for project managers. People 
want to know a variety of things, but the two questions that come up the 
most are, “Is it worth it? and “Is the test as bad as I’ve heard?” The answer to 
the first is “Yes” and “No, not really” to the second. This chapter discusses 
what you need to do to get ready for the exam and why you should bother 
in the first place.
Is It Worth It?
Okay, I have to confess that the primary reason I went off and got the PMP 
certification was that I was out of work at the time and needed the PMP cre-
dentials on my resume. Yes, sadly, I did not see the real value of PMI or the 
PMP until after I’d survived the gauntlet of the certification exam. I was a PMI 
heretic—a nonbeliever, if you will.
Luckily, with the benefit of the exam in the rearview mirror and a few more 
years down the road, I can say with high confidence that getting the PMP 
certification was great for my career and a good thing for my professional 
development. Today, I’m a big proponent of getting certified, and I have to say 
that it has opened some very nice doors for me.
Behind Door #1 you find a little gem I like to call “The 
• 
Big Picture.” Prior to studying for the PMP, I really didn’t 
see how all the project management dots connected.  
I understood the mechanics of risk management, how to 
run an effective meeting, how to create a schedule, and so 
forth. In short, I understood large pieces of each knowl-
edge area, but I couldn’t see how intertwined these areas 
actually are. Post-PMP, I now see how risk management 
feeds the schedule and how meeting minutes are only 
one small part of the project’s communication plan. Heck,  
I now know that referring to the schedule as the project plan  
is one of those “open-your-mouth-and-remove-all-doubt” 
comments we should all avoid.
Step up to Door #2 and you will find a great job offer 
• 
from a world-class semiconductor company. Let’s face 
it: there are a lot of experienced project managers out 
there looking for work. One thing I noticed from my own 
time in Layoffville was that as soon as my resume had 
those three magic letters, my resume started getting a lot 
more notice. I firmly believe that I would not be working 
where I am today without that certification. On any given 
day, on any job posting site you choose, you will find that 

Chapter 18 | Are You a Professional? 
210
the majority of project management jobs either require 
or prefer the PMP. Having the PMP doesn’t guarantee any-
thing, but it’s probably going to help your resume get past 
the first filter and in front of someone who can help you.
Inside Door #3 you find the real prize. You find a community  
• 
of people who do what you do in different industries, a 
huge grab-bag of useful information, and enough career 
development opportunities to choke a horse. I’m blown 
away by the resources PMI provides to continue learn-
ing. I’ve found some of my best ideas and strategies 
while talking to PMs from other companies. In short, 
you find a networking opportunity like no other with 
an instant “in.”
So here’s the bottom line in my opinion: if you want to continue to practice as 
a PM as your chosen career then you need to get certified. Certification won’t 
necessarily make you a better PM, but it will open those doors to people and 
opportunities you don’t have access to today.
Is the Test As Hard as I’ve Heard?
Now let’s talk about what it takes to get through the test.
It’s unfortunate, but there’s a lot of fear-mongering going on out there about 
this test. Years ago, when I was researching taking the test, a lot of people 
told me that it was horrendously hard and that I’d need at least six months to 
study for it. Further, the total cost for getting the certification was way more 
than I’d expected. It seemed that everywhere I turned there were resources 
that would almost…but not quite… guarantee me a passing grade as long as 
I forked over some large amount of cash. People in the process of psyching 
themselves up to take the test would speak in reverential tones in some weird 
language only the PMP-traumatized could understand. They would allude to 
“the pembock” and “Rita” as if you should know what they were.1 Now I ask 
you, how is someone completely new to PMI supposed to know those? It’s 
terrifying and insane!
My experience preparing for and taking the PMP test was straightforward. 
Notice that I didn’t say that it was easy… that’s because it’s not! It’s tough to 
squeeze in study time into an already hectic round of personal and professional 
obligations. Also, let’s not forget that, for the most part, this stuff is as dry as my 
front yard along about July here in Arizona. So not only is it hard to carve out 
time to study, you have to find prime learning time. Trust me, you don’t want 
1“Pembock” is the pronunciation of PMBoK. “Rita” refers to Rita Mulcahy, late lamented 
author of bestselling PMP exam preparation books.

211
Managing Projects in the Real World
to try reading a chapter of the PMBoK any time you are the least bit stressed, 
tired, hungry, or bored. You will either wake up an hour later with the book 
plastered to your face with your own drool or find that you’ve scrubbed the 
entire kitchen floor with your own toothbrush. Not good, not good at all.
So, here are my tips for taking and passing the PMP exam. This is what I tell 
people when they ask me about the test. Trust me, it’s not as bad as you might 
think, and you can do this:
Before you attempt the online application for the exam, 
• 
build a spreadsheet and document your hours of experience. 
This saves a lot of time and frustration later when you are 
completing the online application.
• 
Develop a plan, or at a minimum, a realistic timeline. This 
probably won’t take you six months, but then again it 
probably isn’t something you can do tomorrow either.
• 
Sign up for an exam prep class—the kind that lasts a week 
and will pound so much information into your brain you 
will walk away each day feeling like Johnny Mnemonic.
• 
Utilize some software to mimic the computerized test so 
that you get a feel for the time constraints and question 
styles.
• 
Memorize the stuff suggested. Yes, this is tedious, and no, it 
won’t make you a better project manager, but it will make 
taking the test easier.
• 
Get into the PMI mindset—assimilate into the Borg. 
Remember, it’s only the right answer if PMI thinks it is, so 
be sure you assimilate before you take the test.
• 
Be realistic about what your goal is. The passing grade for 
this exam is shockingly low (68% when I took the exam 
back in 2005). Trust me, once you get the certification no 
one will ask you what your exam score was. It no longer 
matters. What does matter is whether or not it was a 
pass or a fail—so prioritize your time accordingly.
Here are a few warnings that you should bear in mind. I personally know 
people who have had their applications audited or who have failed the test. 
These things happen and it’s not the end of the world. In the case of the audit, 
PMI requested additional information and the matter was easily handled. In 
the case of those who have failed the test, almost all of them walked away with 
a better understanding of project management and their experience level.

Chapter 18 | Are You a Professional? 
212
So, if you are contemplating taking on this challenge, I encourage you to go for 
it. It can’t possibly be as bad as everyone tells you it is, and it probably won’t 
take you near as long as you’ve been told. Also, there’s a strong possibility  
that you can get your company to cough up the coin to pay for it. From  
my perspective, the time spent getting certified was well worth it. So go 
ahead—bite the bullet and do it!
I Got It, Now What?
Okay, once you’ve done the hard work to obtain the PMP certification, just 
how do you go about keeping it? Well, according to the PMI, you need to 
accrue 60 hours of Professional Development Units (PDUs) every three years. 
The challenge comes in figuring out just what kinds of activities rate PDUs,  
so let’s break that down a bit.
In your quest to obtain PDUs, your first stop should be the “Certification” 
page of PMI’s website. But let’s be honest shall we? There’s a lot of data there 
and it’s not exactly a model of good UX is it? Good thing there’s a “Ways to 
Earn PDUs” hyperlink buried somewhere in there! Okay, so far I’m not telling 
you anything you couldn’t figure out for yourself, right? Let’s see if I can do 
better with Melanie’s Tips for Scoring PDUs:
• 
Training, training, training! This is what it’s about folks: con-
tinual learning. There are probably classes offered right 
through your own company that can help you out here. If 
you’re an experienced PM or your company doesn’t have 
PM-specific training available, then you may need to look 
further afield for training, but the good news is that those 
classes are generally of longer duration, which means more 
PDUs for you! A good source for this kind of training  
is PMI’s Seminars World. They aren’t cheap, but every 
class I’ve taken through them has been excellent.
• 
Attend PMI’s Global Congress for your region. If you do nothing  
else, this is the fastest way to get your years’ worth of 
PDUs in one fell swoop. It’s entirely possible to rack up 
15+ PDUs by attending these ginormous conferences. 
Oh, and did I mention that they will upload your PDUs 
for you? Talk about a bargain! Okay, there’s a downside 
and it’s that these conferences are not cheap. Generally 
when I go, I expense about $5,000 (travel, lodging, confer-
ence registration, meals, and transportation). This means 
that you need to plan ahead and work with your manager 
to budget for this.

• 
Share some knowledge with your local chapter. Every month, 
there are four or five professional development meet-
ings sponsored by your local PMI chapter. Each of those 
meetings needs speakers…and they have no budget for 
said speakers! So what does this mean to you? Easy PDUs, 
my friends! Yep, PMI chapters all over have Professional 
Development Meetings (PDMs) all the time. You will find 
that the organizers of these events are always looking for 
speakers and many of them don’t care that you’re not a 
regular on the speaker circuit. What they are looking for 
are speakers who will work cheap and who have some-
thing interesting to share. Oh, and when I say “interesting”  
I mean “interesting to PMs”! These are your people and 
they are generally kind and receptive audiences.
• 
Share some knowledge with the wider PM community. Submit 
abstracts for PM conferences; participate in the various public  
forums; heck, you could even start a PM-oriented blog!
• 
Make sure that you carry over the maximum PDUs allowed 
(20 in 2013) during each renewal cycle. You just never 
know how busy or how traumatic your life is going to be 
three years from now, so it makes sense to get ahead of 
the game if you can. Go ahead and make sure you carry 
over some extras for the next renewal cycle.
Last, be sure you 
• 
claim the “easy money.” Yep, if you’re a 
full-time PM, then you can claim five PDUs a year, so that’s 
25% of your total needed to maintain your credential 
already in the bank. You are claiming that, aren’t you?
Now you know just how easy it is to rack up those PDUs! What’s stopping 
you now?
I confess that I purely hate logging my PDUs! I loathe the task. I will find any 
number of things to do to avoid it. I’ll put receipts for PDMs in a pile on my desk 
then promptly forget about them. This means that at least once a year I have 
a pile of PDUs to claim, and since that process is only slightly less complicated 
than ordering lunch for 20 from the sandwich shop down the street, it isn’t a 
fun time. Yeah, I know I’m a bad PM. The thing is, no matter how I feel about the 
method for submitting PDUs, I still have to do it right? I mean, it’s not like I’m 
going to let my certification slide and then have to retake the test, right? So, for 
those bad PMs like me, here are Melanie’s Tips For Claiming PDUs:
• 
If you attend the PMI Global Congress or any of the Seminar 
World classes, PMI automatically logs your PDUs! Yep, there’s 
nothing for you to do except verify that the PDUs are 
actually logged.

• 
Do it as quickly as you can after the event that earned them. 
Don’t be a bad PM and try to claim them all at one time, 
once a year. Trust me if you do this you’ll be cleaning up 
the chocolate and BBQ sauce for a month afterwards!
The first thing you need to do when claiming PDUs is 
• 
to figure out which category your PDUs fall into. Check out 
PMI’s website for the specifics.
Category A is the most confusing and, sadly, it’s the one you 
will probably use the most. Use Category A for:
Training classes that are provided by PMI’s Registered 
• 
Education Providers (REPs). You are able to search 
on the list of suppliers and select the specific class 
you need.
Eligible events offered through your local PMI chapter,  
• 
aka a “Component 1-2 PDU Event.” (Note: “Com­
ponent” refers to the PMI chapter or sub-group 
putting on the shindig.)
For training classes that are not provided by PMI’s REPs, 
• 
you use PDU Category B. (Note: This is the category you use 
to claim credit for training provided by your employer.)
• 
Category F is the “free money”! This is the category you 
use to claim your 5 PDUs a year if you’re a full-time PM. 
Do not leave these on the table!
PMI can and does audit your PDU claims, so be sure that 
• 
you keep the appropriate documentation. Not sure what 
constitutes “appropriate documentation”? Check out the 
PMP Handbook for the specific requirements for each 
category.
If you have a smartphone or tablet, then consider down-
• 
loading the MyPMI app. It lets you see your certification status  
and whether you’re a member in good standing—that  
is, whether your dues are current. You can claim PDUs 
with it, and the Communities tab connects you to special 
interest groups with their associated blogs and events.
So there you go! Some tips and tricks for claiming PDUs. Yes, it’s a hassle, but 
that hassle must be dealt with!

Getting  
Better at It
At some point you start to realize that you really like this project management 
gig and you want to learn more or you want to figure out how to take it to the 
next level. Just how do you do that? Many PMs find themselves in a position 
where they are managing multiple projects simultaneously, so I’m going to give 
you some proven tricks for doing that. Another challenge for PMs is how to 
improve your business acumen—and I’ve got some tricks for you there, too. 
Where can you go to practice specific skills in a live environment? You vol-
unteer, but volunteer projects are their own special fun—so we’ll talk about 
that too. At some point, you’re going to want to attend a professional confer-
ence and you need to understand how to write an abstract and then how to 
get along at that conference. I’d venture to guess that you’re not going to find 
this stuff in your standard Project Management 101 text—so here you go!
What’s in Your Toolbox?
Do you have a project manager toolbox? Is it a shiny red tackle-box or a 
rugged diamond-plate lockbox? What’s inside this toolbox, and where does 
it live?
In this dynamic, chaotic world, information seems to arrive in a deluge, leaving  
little time to understand and internalize it. Today the information stream 
looks more like the output from a fire hose than a discrete glass of water: 
email, IM, phone calls, corporate newsletters, blogs, podcasts, radio, TV, and 
all kinds of old-school paper publications. Obviously, the challenge is how 
to capture the relevant information and store it in a manner that allows for  
efficient retrieval.

I’m constantly looking for fresh ideas on how to continue to improve myself, 
my work, and my team. The problem is how to accumulate those ideas in a 
way that actually lets me access them when I need them. For me, this storage 
system has two critical features: it must be simple to use, and it must cut the 
search time down to mere minutes, if not seconds.
My system is pretty low-key and low-tech. I created a directory on my hard 
drive entitled “PM Toolbox. ” This is where I store all of my generic project 
management resources and data. In this directory I have a few subfolders for 
things like material from training classes and the company’s PMO. However, 
the content is mostly individual files with long names so I can identify them 
easily. Here is where I store templates, checklists, and other assorted files that 
are generic in nature but useful when kicking off a new project. Here’s a quick 
sample of what’s in my Toolbox:
Course material from a fundamentals class I helped evalu-
• 
ate, which turned out to be a great resource that I share 
with junior PMs through the mentoring work I do.
Presentations from several internal project management-
• 
related organizations within Intel.
Note:
■
■
  I always download a copy of the presentation then take notes in the “Speaker Notes” 
section of the PowerPoint file during the talk. This means that not only do I have the speaker’s 
material but also my thoughts at the time, all stored in the same file.)
A folder for interesting articles or information other 
• 
people send me that I think will be useful later.
A folder containing all of the material I’ve developed for 
• 
presentations and talks I’ve done not specifically related 
to the projects I own.
Samples of award nominations.
• 
A folder with any details from past team events I’ve 
• 
organized.
My own templates for meeting minutes, kickoff meetings, 
• 
schedule checklists, etc.
There’s also a side benefit to being organized with your project management 
resources. They are easy to find so you can share them with colleagues when 
the topic come up. For instance, I’ve forwarded the fundamentals class mate-
rial to several people in the course of mentoring them. The toolbox becomes 
a treasure chest of ideas that you can use to add value to your personal and 
professional network.

Why don’t you take a few minutes today and set up the folder? Or set up 
some sort of online system. As you run across data that you think you might 
want to use later, just store it in your own toolbox and soon you will see the 
benefits of quick and efficient access to this kind of data.
Tips and Tricks for Managing Multiple Projects
How many projects are you managing today? Are they similar or drastically 
different? For most of my career I’ve been assigned three or four projects to 
manage at any given time. Personally I love the variety and the challenge of 
keeping all those balls in the air. When these projects span the gamut from, say, 
new product development and business process improvement to joint devel-
opment with a supplier, it’s a little easier to juggle. However, when those three 
or four projects are producing the same type of deliverable, keeping these 
projects straight in your head can get pretty challenging. Make no mistake:  
it really is a juggling act and PMs with more than two projects need some solid 
tools to help drown out the circus music.
Here are a few tools I’ve refined over the years to help keep the lions, tigers, 
and clowns in their respective cages so that the show can go on:
First, if you have several projects with similar deliverables, 
• 
don’t trust your memory!  Print out copies of the 
schedule, risk register, meeting minutes, and so on and 
carry these with you all the time. The next time you’re 
put on the spot for an update, you don’t have to fumble 
with your laptop (and don’t forget that fun fest when 
you can’t get online); you can whip out your hardcopy 
schedule and say with confidence, “Yes, we are on track 
to deliver October 15th.” The other cool thing about hav-
ing the hardcopy is that you can make quick notes right 
on the document real-time while the discussion is raging 
hot and heavy. When you do get the time to update the 
schedule, all of your changes are right there in one place, 
making it less likely that you will forget to incorporate 
anyone’s update. I am almost never without those hard-
copy schedules!
Note

■
  You could do the same thing by saving offline copies of critical project documents. Just 
make sure that your access to the information is not tied to your ability to be online.

• 
Use color ruthlessly. I color-code my projects so that 
I can tell at a glance which one I’m working on. How far 
do I take this color-coding, you might ask? As far as pos-
sible! I designate a specific color for each project and 
then keep a folder of that color on my desk to hold any 
project-specific content I’m working with. I set up custom 
flags in Outlook so that I can tag each important email 
with the project’s color. I have even been known to go 
out and buy color-specific pens so that when I’m taking 
notes in a central notebook I can quickly skim through to 
a specific project’s notes based on color. One final com-
ment here: I never use red for a project. Red is special 
and it’s got its own meaning: “Holy Guacamole! This must 
be done ASAP!” Only the truly urgent items get tagged 
with the color red, regardless of which project they cor-
respond to.
As long as you are being ruthless, why not 
• 
take con-
trol of your meeting schedule? Since you are the 
PM, you have a lot of flexibility to set up the project-
specific meetings you run. I’ve had success with these 
two strategies: 
Set up all of your meetings for one or two days of 
• 
the week. You will have a very long day or two but 
your remaining week will be free of meetings for the 
most part and you will have plenty of flexibility to 
get work done.
Set up all of a specific project’s meetings and work 
• 
time on a specific day of the week. For instance, 
Monday is Project A’s day and that’s what you 
focus on for the entire day. This is a little harder to 
implement but I have found it to be very effective 
at allowing me time to focus on strategic activities. 
If you’re struggling with finding time to be strategic, 
give this one a try.
Speaking of taking control of your schedule—be sure to 
• 
block time on your calendar to work on specific 
projects. (Note: This tool is critical! If you find that you 
have too many meetings and can’t find time to work, 
you need to start blocking off time on your calendar for 
deskwork.) How much time I block off depends on each 
project; some need more of my attention than others, 
depending on what stage they are in. Hey, you can also 
color-code these calendar items!

Managing Projects in the Real World
219
Okay, this last one is probably obvious, but if you are man-
• 
aging multiple projects, then it helps to institute a com-
mon naming convention across all of them. Name the 
schedule, risk register, meeting minutes, and so on all the 
same way, no matter which project it is. If your projects 
get assigned an identifying number through your org’s 
business process, have all of your file names reference 
that number. That’s how I know the project schedule I’m 
looking at belongs to SR128583 and not SR131683. Trust 
me, if you have them both open at the same time and are 
toggling between them, it can get confusing.
I hope these tools are useful to you, because when you have more than two 
projects it can get pretty crazy and you’ll start to see circus metaphors left 
and right! I’ve used all of these concepts and vouch for their effectiveness.
Improve Your Business Acumen
To be effective as a PM, you need to understand the business environment you 
work in. You need to understand what’s going on in your particular market 
segment, what your customers and competition are up to, and what’s going on 
within your own company. In some cases you even need to understand what’s 
going on at a political level and how that may or may not affect your project. 
You need to stay on top of these things so that you can be effective at making 
tradeoff decisions and prioritization calls. Unfortunately there’s a lot to keep 
track of—and, really, who has the time?
Okay, let’s address the time issue first, as I suspect that’s your biggest concern. 
How much time do you devote to this activity? How much is reasonable? 
The answer to those questions really depends on you and the environment 
you work in. Early in my career I got some advice that has stayed with me.  
A crusty old-timer told me that it was very important to stay on top of what 
was going on in the industry. He also pointed out that if you can only squeeze 
in 15 minutes a day, that’s 15 minutes more information you will have than 
your peers who don’t bother to stay in the know. He was very successful, so 
I took his advice seriously and, since he spun his message as a competitive 
advantage, I jumped all over it. Fast-forward some unmentionable number  
of years and I’m still making time to stay in touch with what’s going on. Some 
weeks I can devote an hour to this activity, others it’s more like that the  
15 minutes he mentioned.
So, if you can find some amount of time to pursue this knowledge, how do 
you go about it? It turns out that there are more information sources than 
you have time, so you’ll need to check out as many as you can and then filter 

Chapter 19 | Getting Better at It 
220
to the ones that provide the most value to you. Here are a couple of ideas to 
get you started:
Google Alerts for your company, competitors, industry 
• 
associations, and so on.
Company news outlets. (Most large companies have these 
• 
now, and they practically spoon-feed you the data—so 
check these out to save time.)
Business magazines/websites.
• 
If you are still struggling to find good sources, then ask for recommendations 
from your boss, your peers, and basically anyone who seems to have a solid 
understanding of what’s going on.
If you participate in the PMI community, then you have probably run across 
Dr. Harold Kerzner talking about where he sees the future of project man-
agement going. He’s become something of a futurist for the profession and 
speaks often on this topic at various PM-related events. One of the things that 
resonates with me about Dr. Kerzner is his observation that, as the nature of 
projects continues to evolve, the PM is becoming more of a business manager 
than a technical expert or a project work coordinator. What this means is 
that you need to step up your business acumen and increase your under-
standing of your company’s overall business. As project management becomes 
more about managing projects as businesses, a PM can no longer afford to be 
uninformed about markets and customers. We PMs need to understand our 
customer’s business strategies to an even greater depth and degree.
The Most Important Meeting You’re Not Going to
All companies hold regular meetings by their executives for their employees. 
Sadly, these meetings can be sparsely attended if they are not mandatory and 
many see them as low-value corporate spin doctoring. Sure, some companies 
roll that way, but for the most part, these are critical meetings for PMs to 
attend. Everyone makes prioritization calls about how to use their time—I get  
that. I even get it that you’re crazy busy and you might find some of these 
meetings deadly boring, but I’d like to use up a few electrons generating text 
here to make a case for upping the priority of this type of meeting.
Probably the most common reason for not attending these meetings is the 
perception that there’s no new information conveyed. If you think this way, 
then you really are missing the point. I rarely go to these types of meetings 
expecting to hear breaking news. Instead I go to gather context. What is the 
CEO emphasizing? How do my current projects tie into the organization’s 
objectives? From a project management and a personal career management 
perspective, I want to be working on the initiatives that are important to the 

Managing Projects in the Real World
221
company. The best way to understand this is to understand what’s important 
to the company’s leaders, and about the only way to get independent intel on 
this is to attend these types of meetings and pay attention. What’s said? What 
isn’t? Sometimes I learn more about the direction my organization is headed 
by figuring out what they aren’t talking about. It should be noted that to gather 
this kind of contextual information you have to be actively listening and evalu-
ating everything that’s said. You cannot do this while multitasking.
Another common justification for ditching these meetings is the belief that 
the content is all corporate-speak and doesn’t reflect reality. Let’s be honest 
here: no exec is gonna stand up there and say, “Oh, by the way, we’re laying off 
20% of our headcount next week.” If you’re looking for that kind of honesty, 
wake up and smell the coffee. Again, the valuable information in these meet-
ings is contextual, not what’s literally said. Let me give you an example of what 
I mean here. In one such meeting I attended, there was an announcement of 
the organization’s intent to staff up a facility in a non-US location. There were 
some interesting justifications for this move and even an announcement of 
the pending opening of quite a few reqs for this new site. Later in the meet-
ing there was some discussion of headcount and the speaker went to some 
lengths to emphasize that it has become rather challenging to get new reqs 
approved for positions in the United States. She went on to say that any US 
attrition would be backfilled in the non-US location. Now it’s entirely pos-
sible that I misunderstood or misinterpreted some of what was said, but the 
information I gleaned from that meeting is pretty helpful to me both as a PM 
and to manage my own career. Again, no exec is going to come right out and 
say these things, but the meaning is there if you bother to attend the meeting 
and pay attention.
I think it’s obvious to say that paying attention and active participation are the 
keys to getting anything out of these meetings. It always surprises me how 
few questions are asked at these types of meetings. As far as networking and 
expanding your sphere of influence, these meetings are a goldmine of oppor-
tunity. It’s also easier than you think to ask a question. To get the maximum 
benefit of asking the question, be sure to introduce yourself and mention 
where you work before getting to the question. If you have trouble thinking of 
questions, then take a few minutes beforehand and write some down, that way 
you’ll be prepared when the meeting is opened for questions. Another thing 
to consider is that your questions need to be answerable from the speaker’s 
perspective. Keep them succinct and try not to put the speaker in a position 
to reveal information they are uncomfortable revealing. There are some spe-
cific things that the CEO is not going to discuss in an open forum, so don’t 
waste his time or ours by asking that type of question. Last, I should mention 
that as long as the question is succinct and articulate it almost doesn’t matter 
what it is or what the resulting answer may be. The goal here is to participate 
in the meeting and maybe get some name recognition. If you are uncomfort-
able with public speaking, try to consider these as opportunities to practice.  

Chapter 19 | Getting Better at It 
222
It may be nerve-wracking to stand up there in front of a large crowd, but it 
only lasts 4-5 minutes and then you’re done. You can do that!
Finally, there’s a really good personal reason I attend these types of meetings, 
especially the open forum after earnings are announced. You see, I happen to 
own stock in my company and I’m betting that you do, too. As an investor, this 
is the only stock I own where I can get such candid and in-depth information 
about what the CEO is thinking and where the company is headed. If I could 
get this level of information on every stock I own or am considering, then I’d 
be a lot better off financially. In short, if you own stock in the company, why 
wouldn’t you actively participate in these meetings?
So, did you attend the most recent all-hands meeting? If not, did you accom-
plish something significant instead? Or worse, did you schedule a meeting 
over that timeslot and thereby prevent others from attending? If you aren’t 
in the habit of regularly attending these meetings and actively participating, 
then I’d like to challenge you to do so. Just try it out for a few months and 
see if you agree with me. There’s a lot of information being conveyed—
just not all of it is verbalized or even contained on the slides. As a PM, you 
need to understand how your project aligns to corporate and organizational 
objectives. As an employee concerned about your career growth, it’s neg-
ligent not to pay attention to what’s going on in the rest of the company. 
Finally, as a stockholder, it’s an invaluable resource for information about 
your investment.
Volunteer to Sharpen the Saw
Think you’ve got game as a PM? Think you’re pretty good at influencing and 
motivating others—heck, you own soft skills, right? Okay, hotshot, it’s time to 
put that to the test and volunteer. Yep, you heard me—go ahead and volunteer 
to lead a project of volunteers…just get ready for a major reality check!
One of the best ways to improve your influence and motivation skills is to 
lead a team of volunteers. You see, when you lead volunteer teams there are 
a few realities you have to live with. First, this is not a top priority for anyone 
on the team. In fact, volunteer work is often the lowest priority for your 
teammates, and the work will often get axed if their day jobs get busy. Second, 
there really are very few consequences to dropping a ball on a volunteer  
project, especially at work since everyone has a get-out-of-jail-free card and 
isn’t afraid to use it. If I fail to deliver something for a volunteer project, sure 
my rep gets a little dinged, but my performance review remains intact for the 
most part. So, if you want to lead a volunteer team you’re going to have to 
excel at motivation through sheer force of will and your own talents.

Managing Projects in the Real World
223
I’ve managed a few volunteer projects, both work-related and not, over the 
years. There are a few things I’ve learned along the way, which I share here:
Volunteer projects are much, much, much harder to lead 
• 
than any other project you’ve led in the past. They are 
also a great way to work on your motivation and influence 
skills.
You have to invest significant amounts of time to get to 
• 
know your teammates; there’s more social interaction 
with a volunteer team. Understand going in that you will 
need to spend more time building relationships on an  
all-volunteer team.
In order to influence your team effectively, you need to 
• 
be able to answer the what’s-in-it-for-me question for 
each team member. This will be different for each person, 
so make sure you have a great big bunch of motivational 
tricks up your sleeve. One size won’t fit all.
People view volunteer work as optional and, trust me, 
• 
they will let you and the rest of the team down occasion-
ally. If you’re lucky, they will feel bad about it and try to 
make amends, but most of the time folks feel justified in 
dropping volunteer work if it means putting in overtime 
because their day job got busy.
To address the reality of the volunteer work being a low 
• 
priority, I emphasize the team dynamic heavily. I make a 
point to say things like “The team is counting on you” and 
even “You let the team down when you didn’t complete 
that work.”
Make sure your team dynamic is supportive of people 
• 
asking for help on their given tasks if they get busy. It’s 
much less frustrating for the entire team if everyone can 
pitch in when help is needed, as opposed to getting pissy 
if someone can’t deliver on time.
The more passionate you are about the project, the easier 
• 
it will be to influence the team. If you truly believe in the 
project and can paint a compelling picture of its benefits 
for the team, then you will be a long way towards moti-
vating your team. On the other hand, if you don’t really 
buy into the project objectives, it’s a good bet that most 
of your team doesn’t either and getting all of the work 
done on time will be an uphill battle for you.

Chapter 19 | Getting Better at It 
224
All PMs know that recognition is an important motiva-
• 
tional tool, but for volunteer projects, you’re going to 
want to go above and beyond the norm when it comes 
to recognition.
It’s always important to role-model the behavior you’re 
• 
expecting from the team, especially when it comes to 
volunteer projects. If you find yourself stuck with a dog of 
a project, realize that you’re committed for the duration. 
It’s a matter of integrity that you stay the course.
It’s also important to realize that when things start unrav-
• 
eling, you really get to stretch yourself as a PM. Often this 
is the time when you need to step back and re-examine 
your influence and motivation approaches. Remember, 
one of the reasons you probably volunteered for this 
project was that it provided an opportunity to improve 
your soft skills. So go figure out how to improve.
And last, there’s nothing that says you can’t renegotiate 
• 
the scope of work down to something more realistic if 
things start unraveling. Often this is the best way to get 
out from under a dog project with the team’s reputa-
tion intact. Not every project has to be a home run, and 
sometimes crossing the finish line is more important than 
the final score.
After reading this list, you might think I’m pretty down on volunteer projects, 
but that’s just not the case. I really believe that they are a great way to sharpen 
your motivation and influence skills. But make no mistake: this type of project 
is harder to manage. Today I volunteer to lead this type of project only when 
I feel strongly about the project objectives, but that doesn’t mean that I don’t 
“get volunteered” for a few dogs now and then. When you are leading an all-
volunteer team, it’s important to keep in mind the two realities I mentioned. 
If you’re leading such a team and you find yourself constantly frustrated with 
your team’s lack of commitment to the project, then it’s time to reevaluate your 
motivation tactics and try something new. After all, these projects are great 
learning opportunities, if you’ll just take the time to learn some new tricks.
How to Turn Your Ideas into Reality
So, you have an awesome idea to improve a process…but it means someone, 
somewhere will have to do some work. How do you go about getting your 
idea implemented? In the High-Tech Circus I work in, we absolutely love, love, 
love process improvements but, frankly, we don’t always have the time to 

Managing Projects in the Real World
225
implement them, and—though we’re loath to admit it—we frequently don’t 
want to change. The trick to turning your idea into reality is influence.
To influence others, you have to define, refine, and confine the problem your 
idea will address. You must be able to articulate it clearly. More importantly, 
you need to make sure that it really is an awesome idea. To do this I sit down 
and think about some key aspects of my idea. First, what’s the problem or 
challenge my idea addresses? Here I try to be pretty specific, using quantifi-
able data if possible. I write this stuff down! Next I capture what success, or 
the end state, should look like. If I can’t do this, then the idea hasn’t cooked 
long enough. I also like to do the flip side of that analysis and write down what 
success isn’t. I’ve found that doing the yin/yang sort of analysis is really helpful 
in clarifying the “pass criteria” for the solution.
Next, it’s time to look at your proposed solution. At this point you probably 
have a high-level concept you think will solve your problem, but it’s worth 
taking some time to brainstorm other possible solutions as well. Remember, if 
you sell the right people on your idea, the team that implements the process 
improvement (and yeah, I know that could be you…your own Team of One!) 
should do a more thorough review of the solution options. Here you just 
want to make sure you’re not off in the weeds with your idea. Now you need 
to put pixels to work and document the specifics of your proposed solution, 
which teams or people will be affected, who the decision makers are, how 
long you think this will take to implement, how much it will cost vs. the savings 
it will engender, pros, cons, and so forth. You get the picture.
Now you’re ready for some old-school stakeholder management. From your 
analysis of your idea, you know who could potentially be affected by your pro-
posed process improvement. Now you go talk to them! Make it informal but 
gather some key intel. Do they agree with you that there’s a problem? What 
do they think it will take to solve the problem? Do they have any interest in 
partnering with you to solve it? Are they adamantly opposed to your idea? If 
this all sounds familiar…well it should, for this is Stakeholder Management 
101. You got this part, right?
Finally, it’s time to pitch your idea to the right folks. You may need to do this 
in multiple forums to get the right level of buy-in. Oh, and don’t be lulled by an 
autocratic directive from on high for some down-trodden worker bees to go 
implement your idea—you have to do even more influencing and motivation  
in that scenario! Pitching an idea is not unlike prepping for a potentially deadly 
ops review, so basically you use the same tactics. Don’t surprise the higher-ups,  
build consensus before the big presentation, know who the decision makers 
really are, and so on.

Caution
■
■
  Do not jump right into pitching the idea without doing the analysis I mention above.  
If you do, I can pretty much guarantee you that your proposal will sound half-baked, you will get some 
action items to do that same analysis you should have already done, and there’s a strong chance that 
your idea will die an early death right there in your face.
Last, the hardest part about having an awesome idea is knowing when to step 
aside and let the baby learn to run. Sure it’s your baby, you’ve nudged it to 
crawl, and now it’s walking on its own, but there always comes a time when 
you need to move on to your next awesome idea. Too often folks get so 
attached to their idea, especially if it was a success, that they can’t let go. Many 
times, I’m not the one to implement my “awesome idea” and I’ve learned over 
the years that there’s just as much value in being the idea generator as there 
is in being the idea implementer. Unfortunately, the generator doesn’t always 
get the recognition though.  Seriously, as a PM you need to constantly hone 
your skills to get work done through others. I purely love scoping new proj-
ects, but when it’s time to hand off a solid project plan to another PM, I kinda 
wanna cry. Those projects are sort of like the big catfish that got away, if you 
know what I mean. Luckily for me, there’s always another project to plan.
In the end, you get to a point in your career where you’re expected to gen-
erate ideas for improving processes and designs. Being able to bring creative 
ideas to the table is important, but you must make sure that your ideas are 
well-developed and that you’ve greased the wheels so that your ideas fall on 
receptive ears. The good news is this is really just an extension of basic prob-
lem solving and stakeholder management.
It’s a Universal Skill
I had an interesting hallway conversation not long ago while I was carrying a 
cake. That’s what started the conversation, but when I mentioned that I was a 
PM somehow we ended up talking about managing different types of projects. 
She wanted to know if I found managing projects from different engineering 
disciplines easy. I told her that I find it very easy and that changing is a great 
way to stay excited about being a PM.
Now this is an area where I do think I’ve got the chops to talk. I’ve been 
managing projects for over fifteen years now and have experience managing 
projects that span mechanical, electrical, materials, and software engineering 
disciplines. I’ve also led project work in vendor development, joint product 
development, and operations. My current job entails managing software proj-
ects with a little bit of operations work thrown in to alleviate the boredom. 
So I know a bit about managing projects in different technical disciplines and 
I’ve come to understand that you really can switch disciplines if you’ve got the 

Managing Projects in the Real World
227
PM skills mastered. I think of project management skills as universal skills you 
can apply across any discipline.
These universal skills come up all the time in conversations with other PMs when 
we’re talking about the challenges each of us is facing. In fact, I’ve noticed that 
these challenges are pretty universal, so it makes sense that the skills you use to 
deal with them are universal as well. Here’s an example: my brother used to man-
age projects in the construction industry and one of his biggest challenges was 
managing stakeholders who want to get all up in his business… how many peo-
ple are working on the project, how well trained are they, why can’t they work 
weekends, and all that. Sound familiar? I bet you don’t have to think too long to 
recall a time when a stakeholder demanded that your team work a weekend to 
make up some schedule slip. You see, whether you’re refurbing a school’s climate 
control system or designing a piece of cutting-edge technology, stakeholders are 
stakeholders—the good, the bad, and the ugly. Further, once you figure out how to 
deal with that stakeholder and absolutely delight them, you’re golden.
What do I mean when I say “you’re golden”? I mean that if you’ve mastered 
the necessary project management skills, then you can focus on learning the 
new technology of a totally different field while still making things happen on 
the project management front. When I joined a new group within Intel, I had 
pretty much zero experience with software (SW) design. Sure, I’d worked on 
programs where the SW PM was a peer and I’d dabbled in SW development in 
college, but for all intents and purposes I walked in cold when it came to the 
nuances of SW development. I was able to focus a lot of my energy on learning 
and understanding those nuances because I already knew how to work with a 
new team to plan a project, how to manage stakeholders I’d never met before, 
and how to set up and actually do risk management in a meaningful way. This 
isn’t the first time I’ve switched engineering disciplines or technical areas and, 
truthfully, it just gets easier as I get better as a PM.
So if you’re getting a bit bored with your current projects and still love project  
management, then I highly recommend seeking out some PM opportunities in 
another area. This is one of the easiest ways to re-energize your enthusiasm for 
project management. Stay in the technical realm if you like, or bounce over to 
supplier management or even operations. Those universal PM skills you already 
have? They work there too! And here’s a secret… that new team you’re work-
ing with? The one that can run rings around you technically? They’ll think you 
rock as a PM especially when you pull off a realistic schedule, some actual risk 
management, and well-facilitated meetings all while learning the technology.
Maximizing Your ROI at Conferences
Have you ever considered attending some professional conferences? Think  
you don’t have the time or that you won’t get any value out of the experience?  
Think again! If you’ve reached the point in your career where you’ve got  

Chapter 19 | Getting Better at It 
228
this PM gig figured out, then it’s definitely time to start attending professional 
conferences because, frankly, there’s more to learn. As for value? Well, there 
you get out of it what you put into it. No surprise there, right? Professional 
conferences offer several advantages that you may not be aware of. 
First off, there’s the networking. A significant fraction of PMI’s 700,000 members  
attend the annual PMI Global Congresses. PMs from every industry are there 
and you can bank on meeting someone who’s figured out how to overcome 
the challenge of rolling out risk management to a reluctant audience. These 
are your people! They talk your language and you will be able to share war 
stories and solutions with people who’ve been there too.
The second advantage these big professional conferences have is the availability  
of training. Often there are back-to-back speakers and, depending on the size 
of the conference, the topics can range from best practices, to case studies,  
to emerging techniques. Additionally, PMI’s Seminar World offers in-depth, 
advanced training that runs in parallel with their Global Congresses. Here you 
can pick up a new skill or figure out how to stand up a new capability from 
some of the best minds in your profession. You really can’t get this kind of 
specialized training through your corporate training arm.
Another overlooked advantage of professional conferences is the opportunity 
to build your professional reputation by speaking at them. It’s often easier to 
get an abstract selected at the smaller conferences, and you tend to speak 
to a smaller audience. These can be a great means to advertise your project, 
especially if the conference is held within your company or industry associa-
tion. Speaking at larger conferences establishes you as a senior member of the 
profession and goes a long way to building a credible professional reputation 
outside of your association with your employer. In both cases, speaking at a 
professional conference is going to look great on your performance review 
and resume. But before you are asked to speak at a conference, you need to 
submit an abstract.
How to Submit an Abstract
Here’s how it generally goes. First, you submit an abstract of your proposed 
paper. This sounds grander than it actually is, as you can draft and polish a 
solid abstract in a couple of hours. You will most likely need to provide four 
to five paragraphs discussing the problem solved, the solution implementation, 
one or two graphics, and references. Once you submit the abstract, there’s 
nothing to do until you hear whether or not yours was selected for presenta-
tion at the conference. If you do get selected, then you will need to generate 
a paper, poster presentation, a formal presentation, or some combo of the 
three. I find this to be less than ten hours of total work. Assuming you throw 
in an hour or two to practice your presentation, at the end of the day you’ve 

Managing Projects in the Real World
229
spent less than twenty hours of effort. In fact, since you are already intimately 
familiar with the topic, it’s likely that you won’t even need that much time.
The real payoff for your time comes when you get selected to present at one 
of these conferences. You, your entire team, and the project will get great  
visibility at the conference, on the program and other handouts, on the website, 
and of course by doing the actual presentation. Participation in the conference 
will also establish your team as thought leaders in its particular area of exper-
tise. Finally, you can repurpose the content of your talk for other professional 
forums, such as your local PMI chapter meetings and your organization’s own 
newsletter. That’s a lot of buzz for less than twenty hours of work!
How to Be a “Conference Commando”
Several years ago I read Keith Ferrazzi’s book, Never Eat Alone, which is all 
about networking.1 In Chapter 14, “Be a Conference Commando,” Ferrazzi 
provides some very actionable ideas for how to make the most of any con-
ference. The primary reason to go to a conference, he avers, is to meet and 
network with “like-minded people.” In a nutshell, he’s saying that your focus 
should be on networking, and he goes on to say that you probably already 
know most of the material being presented anyway. Think back to the last 
conference you attended. Did you get more out of listening to the talks or 
actually talking to and networking with the presenters? Did you even make an 
effort to meet the presenters? I rest my case.
Okay, so how do you go about becoming a “Conference Commando”? (Catchy 
sobriquet, isn’t it? I can just picture someone in full cammo crawling across 
the lobby of a ritzy convention center…) Well, the best way would be to pick 
up Ferrazzi’s book and read his ideas for yourself. However, in the interests of 
sharing knowledge, here’s my take on his key ideas.
Do…
Organize a dinner and/or happy hour one night of the 
• 
conference to provide a networking forum for “like-
minded people.”
Put yourself in position to “bump” into people you want 
• 
to meet. Figure out where a particular speaker will be 
before the talk and just happen to be there to bump into.
1Keith Ferrazzi. Never Eat Alone: And Other Secrets to Success, One Relationship at a Time. 
Crown Business, 2005.

Chapter 19 | Getting Better at It 
230
Figure out ahead of time whom you’d like to meet and do 
• 
some research on them. What are their interests, hob-
bies, business challenges, and so on?
Prepare well thought-out and insightful questions to ask 
• 
speakers of sessions you’re planning to attend. Do this 
before you get to the conference.
Be an information source. Have information others 
• 
attending the conference need, such as directions to 
meeting rooms, the location of the coffee service, the 
lowdown on local sightseeing attractions, or even recom-
mendations for local restaurants.
Work the breaks and introduce people to each other as a 
• 
way to provide value and facilitate building a deeper profes-
sional relationship. Do not “take a break” and just zone out 
for a few minutes—that’s wasting a valuable opportunity.
What’s the key takeaway? Prepare ahead of time to get the most out of a 
conference. Block some time on your calendar now and spend it preparing for  
the conference. Figure out which sessions you want to attend and develop 
those insightful questions ahead of time. Google the speakers and see if there 
are any you should “bump” into. Research the area and figure out how to 
navigate public transportation. All of these ideas are doable in an hour, and I’m 
betting the return on your investment of time will be substantial.
According to Ferrazzi, here are the things you should definitely not do.
Don’t…
Be a wallflower. Get out there and meet people!
• 
Be what Ferrazzi calls an 
• 
ankle-hugger. That’s someone who 
gloms onto the first friendly person they meet and won’t 
let go. Try to meet as many new and interesting people as 
possible and don’t stick like glue to just one person.
Focus all of your efforts on getting introduced to the 
• 
“celebrities.” Instead, focus on meaningful conversations 
with everyone you run across.
Continually scan the room for fresh meat. Focus on the 
• 
person you’re talking to and have a genuine conversation 
with that person. Disengage when it’s appropriate and 
move on to focus on the next person.

Finally, realize that there’s no prize for amassing the most business cards.  
At the end of the day, cards don’t mean much unless you’ve established 
some common interest on both sides and follow up on the initial meeting.  
Back at your office, that stack of cards is pretty useless.
There you have it: some actionable ideas to help you make the most of your 
next conference. I hope I’ve provided you with some food for thought and 
motivated you to do some advanced planning next time you head to a confer-
ence. If you’re interested in improving your networking skills, then I encourage 
you to pick up Ferrazzi’s book, as it’s chock full of these kinds of actionable 
ideas you can start using immediately.

Acknowledgments
As with any large endeavor, this book could not have been developed without 
the assistance of a large team of people. Although it’s truly impossible to thank 
each and every person who has contributed to my understanding of project 
management and influenced the content of this book, I’d like to take this 
opportunity to thank some of the key contributors to this work.
Because the heart and soul of this material stems from the internal blog I 
write at Intel, The Accidental Profession, I’d first like to thank the thousands 
of folks who read and comment on this blog every week, without whom 
the book could not have been written. I’d like to thank Paulette Moore for 
being the first to comment and spreading the word far and wide; Russel 
Zauner, Nancy Winter, Nisha Desai, and Sharon Shindel for being long-time 
supporters; Jeremy Schultz for more technical support than any friend should 
have to provide; and Jeff Moriatry for motivating me to write a blog in the 
first place. 
Much of what I write about I’ve refined over the years through brainstorming 
and in-depth conversations with my peers. I’d like to thank Jennifer O’Farrell 
and Scott Stanko for their help in demystifying MS Project and for teaching 
me how to level resources the proper way. I’d like to thank Tom Stokes and 
the Chandler Breakfast PDM crew for their insights and ideas, all shared over 
many cups of coffee. I’d like to thank the Arizona chapter of PMI for their 
support and the many opportunities to speak at their events. Thanks to Steve 
Bell, Tiffany Sargent, and Shannon Hart for showing me just what really good 
leadership looks like. For helping me refine how to explain and master those 
mysterious soft skills, I’d like to thank Nazia Khan, Ed Garcia, Monica Solera 
Alfaro, and Chris Mendoza.
I’d be remiss if I neglected to thank my family, who have become an outstanding 
resource for my project management practice. I’d like to thank Christy Odom 
for teaching me how to communicate effectively with irate customers; Stormy 
McBride and Katrina and Allen Odom for schooling me on how you really 
motivate a team; and Jerry McBride for all those vent sessions and for helping 
me see that project management really is a universal skill. For her constant 
support and instilling in me the “go-figure-it-out” mentality, I thank my mother, 
Carol McBride.

Acknowledgments 
For constantly making me look good and for following wherever I lead, I’d like 
to thank the Intel Key Generation Team. In particular, I’d like to thank Chris 
McConnell for countless brainstorming sessions, many of which have ended 
up on the blog and in this book For letting me try out this blogging thing, the 
freedom to pursue it wherever it has led, and unwavering support, I’d like to 
thank my manager, Masud Chowdhury.
Finally, I’d like to thank all those folks who worked with me to get this baby 
out the door—Stuart Douglas and the Intel Press guys as well as all the fine 
folks at Apress, including Robert Hutchinson and Rita Fernando.
 

Preface
I’ve heard it said many times that project management is the “accidental 
profession.” Somehow people across the land have stumbled into this 
massively challenging, sometimes frustrating career, and no one is really sure 
how it happened to them. That’s how it worked for me. One day I’m a 
fairly successful engineer who was slowly getting sucked into more and more 
“management” activities instead of pure engineering. The next thing I know 
I’m handed a project and told, “You own it!”. . . Uh, okay, thanks . . . this is a 
good thing, right? By the way, what exactly do I “own”?
Most veteran project managers (PMs) out there came up through the ranks 
just as I did. We were recognized as people who got things done in a dynamic 
matrixed environment and were given increasing amounts of responsibility as 
we got more things done. This was during the Dot-Com Boom and everyone 
was working like dogs to get cutting-edge technology out the door within 
companies that were growing by leaps and bounds. Most of us didn’t have a 
clue about project management best practices when we started, and frankly 
I didn’t hear about the Project Management Institute (PMI) until I’d been a 
practicing PM for several years. All of my early PM training came from the 
company’s training arm and on-the-job rough and tumble. Needless to say, I 
made a lot of mistakes and mostly learned by doing.
Today there is a superabundance of quality resources out there for new 
project managers. There are advanced degrees in project management, 
sophisticated training available within most companies, and innumerable 
books on the topic for those so inclined. PMI is a treasure trove of best 
known methods (BKMs) and resources, with local chapters that make 
it easy to network with other professionals in your field. But for me, 
project management will always be essentially and irreducibly a learn-by-
doing endeavor in which genuine capability improvements come only with 
experience.
Sure, there are a lot of project management-oriented books available today, 
and for the most part they are very good—very good, that is, at breaking 
down the mechanics of the job. Trying to figure out how to put together a 
comprehensive risk management plan? There’s a book for that. How about 
how to build a dynamically linked schedule in Microsoft Project? Yep, there 
are more than a few books out there that talk about it. But what if you want 
to figure out how to get a really complex project kicked off? How about 

xiv
Preface 
ways to get into that information loop outside of the formal communication 
channel? What if you’re looking for a discussion on how to avoid getting 
grilled at your next project review meeting? 
Well, those things are much harder to come across, so this book attempts 
to shed some light on those dark, dusty places that fall between the cracks 
of theory and best practice out in the real world where irate colleagues, 
unrealistic product launch dates, and virtual meetings reign supreme. Here 
you’ll find targeted discussions on the common challenges project managers 
face every day, broken out by project phases to help you jump quickly to 
solutions for the challenges you have today and can expect to run up against 
tomorrow. 
The strategies, tips, and tricks discussed in this book are all proven techniques. 
I know because I use them all the time! These are the things I had to figure 
out the hard way . . . by screwing it up, breaking things, pissing people off, 
and mismanaging my stakeholders and deliverables. In short, they’re what 
I learned along the way to becoming a competent PM. 
I hope they help!
