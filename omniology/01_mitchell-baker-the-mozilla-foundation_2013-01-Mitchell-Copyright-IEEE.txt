Mitchell Baker: 
The Mozilla 
Foundation
T
he world has witnessed many 
watershed events in the Web’s 
evolution over the past 30 
years. One of the most impor-
tant was the emergence of browsers 
on desktop computers, signaling the 
migration of this technology from 
academia to the public sphere. 
Between 1994 and 1996, as 
commercial investment in Web 
technologies skyrocketed, there was 
a war to become the browser that 
would gain enough market share to 
set the Web’s technical agenda. The 
vendor that prevailed could expect 
to extract a healthy profit from the 
growth that everyone knew was 
coming.
I recently met with the Mozilla 
Foundation’s Mitchell Baker to talk 
about these early days. Visit www.

sations to see the video of our 
discussion.
MOSAIC BEGETS NETSCAPE
Mosaic, a free, open source 
browser, was developed in late 1992 
at the National Center for Supercom-
puting Applications. When the NCSA 
offered Macintosh and Windows ver-
sions in 1993, the commercial world 
took notice. From these humble 
beginnings, Netscape Communica-
product and contributing their work 
to the Mozilla open source project. 
The technical direction of the for-
profit effort changed when Netscape 
was sold to America Online: the 
browser now had to include fea-
tures that would push traffic to AOL 
properties and benefit AOL part-
ners. Netscape became less about 
building the “best browser” on a 
technical level and more about using 
the Netscape brand to benefit AOL. 
This led to friction as the Netscape 
browser continued to lose market 
share to Internet Explorer:
We at mozilla.org were an anomaly 
because our charter was to build 
a successful open source project. 
That worked for quite a while, but 
there were tensions. We came to 
understand that we needed to rebuild 
our core technology. It took a long 
time, and while we were doing it, 
Netscape’s market share continued 
to slide. These were the dark years 
for Mozilla. We were convinced we 
wouldn’t be successful building a 
product to benefit AOL only—we 
wouldn’t generate the kind of interest 
from individual volunteers or com-
mercial partners that we needed to be 
successful. 
Mitchell Baker describes how Firefox, which has its roots in the browser 
wars of the mid-1990s, emerged from the ashes of Netscape.

tions Corporation emerged in early 
1994.
Important young engineers at 
NCSA, notably Marc Andreessen, 
were recruited to work for the new 
company in Silicon Valley. For a 
while, it appeared that Netscape 
would not only succeed but actu-
ally dominate the market. This, of 
course, greatly threatened Microsoft, 
which led to its major investment 
in what would become Windows 95 
and Internet Explorer.
With Microsoft’s entry into the 
marketplace, Netscape had to adjust 
its strategy to remain relevant, ulti-

org to develop a hybrid approach 
that blended open source and pro-
prietary code. According to Baker,
Instead of Netscape versus Microsoft, 
Netscape would gather contributions 
of volunteers and other commercial 
partners and then build a product that 
would be shared. The Netscape lead-
ership knew that to be open source, 
you had to be real. You couldn’t just 
say, “We’re open source now—love 
us,” you really had to manage it differ-
ently. At the time, there were eight of 
us employed by Netscape as mozilla.

zation was very clear about whose 
leadership they were most interested 
in following, so we had to work out a 
way in which the AOL management 
and I could work together enough so 
that they could ship the product they 
wanted to ship but that I continued to 
lead the Mozilla project.
Baker worked with the Netscape 
team from the outside as a vol-
unteer, and eventually a Mozilla 
browser shipped in 2002. It was a 
solid technical product but had a 
poor user experience and thus very 
little uptake. To help conserve funds 
for the Mozilla project, Baker also 
worked on another open source 
effort with Mitch Kapor, the founder 
of Lotus.
FIREFOX RISES  
FROM THE ASHES
By 2003, AOL had decided to get 
out of the browser business, which 
would ultimately lead to the end 
of AOL funding for the fledgling 
Mozilla project:
Fortunately, they knew that just kill-
ing Mozilla would be a mistake. They 
knew enough about Mozilla and the 
name and the brand to think it would 
be good to do something with it. 
Some of the AOL people knew Mitch 
Kapor, so we spent a chunk of time 
trying to figure out what was possible. 
Brendan Eich [now CTO of Mozilla] 
was still at Netscape and very eager to 
make a move. Many of the key people 
at Netscape were desperate to keep 
working on Mozilla.

The long-awaited Netscape 6 
eventually shipped, but the Netscape 
browser and brand were past the 
point of no return:
Netscape 6 is universally acknowl-
edged as a bad product, the end of the 
Netscape product line. Internally, the 
management tensions continued, and 
the failure of Netscape 6 didn’t make 
anything easier. We fought a lot about 
the user interface. UI is a constant 
source of tension, but in our case, 
it was worse because some of these 
fights would be how it made sense to 
AOL to put something in the product 
and its interface with a button to an 
AOL site or something with an adver-
tisement in it or some feature that a 
partner paid for to generate revenue. 
The Mozilla team maintained that 
the code base needed to remain true 
to building the best possible browser 
technology:
We would say, “No, you can’t put 
it into the core product, but you’re 
welcome to have a build system on 
your own and add it in later.” Even in 
the very early days, the open source 
Mozilla versions of the product 
received a lot more testing than the 
Netscape versions. 
Because everyone was on the 
payroll of Netscape/AOL, the ten-
sions couldn’t go on forever:
AOL client fortunes declined, and 
Netscape market share declined pre-
cipitously after Netscape 6. AOL was 
interested in laying off people, and 
one of the big layoffs in 2001 included 
me. My layoff was seen as a power 
struggle as well because by that time, 
the fights about what we were build-
ing and who was making decisions 
were pretty well known within the 
engineering organization. I was laid 
off or fired, depending on how you 
want to describe it, but I continued 
working for Mozilla as a volunteer. 
The Netscape engineering organi-
AOL decided to give Mozilla some 
money and other assets to get them 
started:
We ended up getting $2 million of 
seed money from AOL, and Mitch 
was helpful with that. We also got a 
few other things, like the trademark, 
the name “Mozilla,” and the four 
giant servers that were so important 
to us at the time and had taken us 
almost 18 months to get through the 
purchase cycle at AOL. In 2003, the 
Mozilla Foundation was formed, and 
Mitch Kapor was the first chairman. 
Bryan Behlendorf, Christopher Bliz-
zard, Brendan Eich, and I were on 
the board. AOL also understood that 
several people would be leaving when 
they closed down the client group and 
that those people would be coming to 
Mozilla. 
The Mozilla Foundation started 
with 10 employees and enough 
money to last two years, but the 
browser needed major rework:
It was a little exciting, a little scary, 
because we knew that $2 million 
wouldn’t go that far and that we had 
a lot of work to do to make ourselves 
real. We were still 15 months away 
from shipping Firefox. We decided 
unambiguously that Firefox would 
be a consumer product, which seems 
obvious, but when you’re a bunch of 
developers, it’s not that easy. It means 
that you have to strip out a lot of the 
things that are clunky for a general 
consumer. For example, we tried to 
figure out what to do with the start 
page because we knew that links to 
Mozilla development tools weren’t the 
right answer. It took us forever, and 
we looked at all sorts of things before 
finally deciding the one thing we 
knew everybody did was search. We 
talked with search providers and had 
a very fruitful discussion with Google.
But Baker didn’t want to estab-
lish an exclusive relationship with 
a single partner, so she insisted that

he modern Web owes a debt 
of gratitude to the people 
involved in the Mozilla efforts 
since 1998. These people held true 
to their principles when things 
seemed bleak and continued to work 
on a free and open product that they 
believed we all needed. Regardless 
of what browser we use today on 
our personal computers or handheld 
devices, we continue to need the 
Mozilla Foundation and what it rep-
resents.

more people had a comfort level to 
try it. We had a beautiful product, an 
important product, and the alterna-
tive was horrendous and dangerous 
and awful. All of that combined to 
create this giant excitement, and 
Firefox market share started to climb. 
It was a viral storm with nothing 
driving it other than the product and 
the market need. We had 10 or 11 
employees, so we were hoping that a 
few million dollars from the search 
box revenue would support us over 
the next year. It turned out that we 
generated that amount of money in 
about six weeks.
With the right product at the right 
time, and a solid business model that 
brought in far more revenue than 
the minimum they needed to sur-
vive, Mozilla began the next chapter 
of its existence:
Actually, things got even more stress-
ful and more hectic at that point 
because now you’ve kind of got the 
preverbal tiger by the tail and we 
were still 12 people. By 2005, we were 
in a really different world where we 
began to actually influence others. 
And that’s always been the goal. I 
mean market share is nice, and it’s 
nice when people love your product, 
but market share is only a validation 
that you’ve produced the right thing. 
An equally important goal is to be 
able to influence not only ourselves 
Yahoo would be one of the search 
options in addition to the Google 
search:
We did something that I believe 
had never been done before, which 
was to make sure that Google and 
Yahoo were right there next to each 
other. I negotiated that, and it was an 
absolute “I will walk away from the 
deal” moment. You know how you 
get on a plane and you want a Diet 
Coke, but the plane only has Diet 
Pepsi because they have some deal? I 
used that example and said, “I’m not 
going to have Firefox users angry at 
us because they wanted one or the 
other.”
The Mozilla project valued open-
ness and inclusion as core values. 
Team members knew that it was 
important to retain real indepen-
dence from any single corporate 
entity even if it meant failing finan-
cially. Near the end of 2004, the 
rewrite that was initially named 
Phoenix and later called Firefox 
finally shipped with the Google/
Yahoo search box:
We had seen a rise in interest from 
Firefox 0.8 and 0.9 that was pretty 
noticeable, but once we hit the 
release version, it just exploded.… 
Internet capabilities had grown 
enough to where people could actu-
ally download a browser easily, and
