Preface
This book deals with the most important substances used as additives in the
plastics industry to improve the properties of polymer-based materials.
Each chapter deals with a particular type of additive based on the type's
definition, structure, and classification according to main effects on polymeric
materials. The mechanism of the additive efficiency and its effects on basic
properties of specific polymers are discussed and a survey of its important
qualities and practical applications is given. Each chapter is introduced by a
theoretical analysis of the practical and technological importance of the ad-
ditive.
The book is mainly intended for students in technical colleges, polytechnics
and universities who are studying plastics technology and macromolecular
chemistry as part of their general curriculum and for technologists in industry
engaged in development, sales, technical service and production functions, and
applications of plastics . An elementary knowledge of chemistry, physical
chemistry and polymer science at the technical college level is assumed.

Introduction
Additives for plastics are substances that are dispersed within polymeric mate-
rials in order to modify their behavior in the course of processing and to
improve the properties desired of finalproducts; this is done with minimalor no
change of the polymer molecular structure. This definition excludes catalysts,
initiators, cross-linking agents, and so on, which bring basic chemical changes
to the polymer structure [1].
Additives can be classified according to their effect on basic properties of
polymeric materials and according to their present practical uses. This concept
allows the division of additives into two main groups:
1. The first group contains additives that modify the physical properties of
plastics. They are plasticizers, lubricants, and mold-release agents, macro-
molecular modifiers, reinforcing fillers, reinforcing agents and coupling
agents, colorants and brightening agents, blowing agents, and antistatic
agents.
2. The second group contains additives that have a protecting effect against
polymer aging and degradation. They are antidegradants such as heat stabi-
lizers, antioxidants, ultraviolet protecting agents, flame retardants, and bio-
cides.
The efficiency of a given additive (besides its own physical properties and its
weight content in plastics) depends mainly on its degree of dispersion, which is
also one of the major economic factors in its use. The degree of dispersion of an
additive in a polymer matrix depends mainly on the following items:
The chemical natures of both additive and polymer.
The additive's physical state (liquid; pulverized or chipped solid; viscous,
viscoelastic, or plastic material).
The mixing process used and its efficiency.
In other words, the homogenization process should be in conformity with
thermodynamic principles, the permeation of polymer to additive, and the

2
Introduction
efficiency of the mixing machine for the given polymer-additive pair. It is not
always necessary to obtain such a high degree of dispersion as that in a solu-
tion; rather, we need only to reach a point where the desired effect from the
additive is at its maximum. In the case of plasticization of polymers by addi-
tives, for example, a true thermodynamically stable solution is needed. But
when an elastomer is added to poly(vinyl chloride) to obtain a high-impact-
strength polymer-polymer blend, it is only necessary to obtain a two-phase
microheterogeneous system. If the degree of dispersion is too high (overmill-
ing), the efficiency of the rubbery modifier decreases [2,3]. The same is true for
electrical conductors made of polymers filled with conducting carbon blacks.
These systems perform well only for a limited degree of dispersion of the filler
in the polymer matrix.
The preparation of polymer-additive mixtures is a rather complicated pro-
cess involving many theoretical and technological considerations governed by
many factors, such as the physical properties of finished materials , production
costs , and energy consumption. They form a combination of sometimes contra-
dictory practical objectives that can only be realized by compromise solutions
coming from technological knowhow and practical experience. The present
book can only give an introduction to the many aspects of additives for plastics.
Nevertheless it covers an important sector of the chemical industry. The use of
plasticizers has been growing over the last 25 years . For example, in the United
States in 1978, 734,000 tons of plasticizers were used. Linear phthalates ac-
count for 41% of this total and ramified phthalates, for 21% [4]. Plasticizers,
which in 1978 accounted for 31% of the world-wide additives market, will
decrease to under 25% of the total in the 1980s,and it is expected that the total
volume of additives will increase to 8.5 million tons in 1990 [5].

Plasticizers
Plasticizers are organic substances of low volatility that are miscible with poly-
mers. They increase flow and thermoplasticity of plastic materials by decreas-
ing the viscosity of polymer melts, the glass transition temperature (Tg) , and the
elasticity modulus of finished products. Plasticizers are used only with a limited
number of polymers, the most important being poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) and
its copolymers (80% by weight [1]), cellulose derivatives, poly(vinyl acetate)
(PVA), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVAL), and natural and synthetic rubbers.
1.1
Thermodynamic Basis of Macromolecular Mixtures
1.1.1
Solubility of Polymers in Solvents
In many applications it is of prime importance that plasticizer and polymer be
completely miscible at the molecular level. Thermodynamic criteria for the
solubility of additives in polymers are the same as those given for simple liquid
mixtures [2-6]. When two liquid substances form a stable solution, classical
thermodynamics shows that the free enthalpy of mixing, 6.Gm , is negative [7].

In the case of an ideal solution, ARm = 0, and since ASm is always positive, the
value of AGm is negative. When the solution does not behave ideally. a simple
relation for ARm has been proposed : the van Laar expression for any two-
component system based on the cell model for a liquid mixture [8,9],
(1.3)
where z is the number of first neighbors to a given cell, nl is the number of
molecules of the first component, and <1>2 is the volume fraction of the second
component. The quantity AWI2 is the change in energy for the formation of a 1,2
pair contact and is defined by
(1.4)
where WII> W22 are the energies associated with the respective pair contacts.
When AWI2 < 0, there is a strong interaction between unlike molecules and ARm
is negative. But when AWI2 > 0, a mutual repulsion between unlike molecules
exists and miscibility is possible when the entropy factor is important enough to
maintain AGm S
O. When strong interactions, attractive or repulsive , between
unlike molecules perturb their distribution within the system, AWI2 becomes
temperature dependent and cannot be regarded simply as an energy term. AWI2
is regarded as a free energy change due to the formation of a 1,2 pair contact
and is split into an enthalpy contribution (AWh) and an entropy contribution
(Aws ) . One may then write
(1.5)
Equation (1 .2) can now be expressed by
(1.6)
with
(1.7)
The quantity AS;:; in Eq. (1.6) is now defined as the configurational entropy
change due to mixing. So when AWI2 > 0, temperature becomes a very impor-
tant factor for the complete miscibility of two liquids.
1.1.2
Flory-Huggins Interaction Parameter
Plasticizer-polymer systems form concentrated macromolecular solutions and
no particular theory has been proposed yet to treat their thermodynamic behav-
ior. The best treatment is to use the well-known Flory-Huggins theory, which
is applicable to concentrated solutions of perfectly disordered homogeneous

1.1: Thermodynamic Basis of Macromolecular Mixtures

linear polymers in monomeric solvents [8-12]. When z becomes very large,
6.Gm for such a system is expressed as
(1.8)
where n2 is the number of polymer molecules and <\>1 is the volume fraction of
solvent. The dimensionless quantity Xis known as the Flory-Huggins interac-
tion parameter, which characterizes the interaction between solvent molecules
and polymer segments for a given polymer-solvent pair. The parameter X is
temperature dependent and in many cases concentration dependent. It is re-
lated to 6.w12 by the expression
X = z 6.wl2/kT
(1.9)
where k is the Boltzmann constant. So Xis a free energy interaction parameter.
For X ::5 0, miscibility is complete. According to Flory's treatment of phase
equilibria in polymer systems [8], for an infinite-molecular-weight macromole-
cule, phase separation occurs if Xis greater than 0.5. The knowledge of Xvalues
for polymer-solvent systems may be used as a guideline in the search for a
plasticizer miscible with a given polymer. For example , if a polymer is soluble
in a low-boiling ester with a Xvalue not too close to 0.5, chances that it is also
soluble in a high-boiling-point ester are good. (At least it is worth trying.)
However, a thermodynamically good solvent is not necessarily a "practically"
good solvent. For instance, in a good varnish formulation, the solvent should
be selected such as to maintain the viscosity of the solution within acceptable
limits.
1.1.3
Solubility Parameter
In Eq. (1.6) the absolute value of 6.Hm is the most important factor in determin-
ing the sign of 6.Gm â¢ It is possible to obtain an estimate of the value for llim by
using the relation proposed by Hildebrand and Scott [2,6,9,13], assuming
6.Vm = 0,
(1.10)
where Vm is the volume of solution and 81, 82 are the solubility parameters of
components. This quantity is the square root of the internal pressure or the
cohesive energy density of the component and is expressed by
8 = (I1E/V)JI2
(1.11)
where I1E is the energy of vaporization of the component and V is its molar
volume. A serious limitation arises in the use of solubility parameters to esti-
mate llim when the forces between unlike molecules are too different in type

10

and magnitude. The notation of solubility parameter is more complex than Eq.
(l.ll) seems to indicate; the total solubility parameter may be divided into three
parts [6,13],
(l.12)
where Od is the part due to dispersion forces, op is the part due to polar forces,
and Oh is the part due to hydrogen bonding. The last part becomes important
when considering strongly hydrogen-bonding solvents such as alcohols,
amines, acids, amides, and aldehydes .
As polymers are nonvolatile, their solubility parameters cannot be calcu-
lated from their physical constants. The 0 for a given polymer may, however,
be estimated as the midpoint of known 0 values for solvents that solubilize or
swell the polymer [13,14]. As shown schematically in Fig. 1.1, the 0 value range
is larger for linear or branched polymers than for cross-linked polymers;
Some 0 values for well-known polymers are given in Table 1.1 [14,15], and
more extensive tables are published elsewhere [6,13,16-18]. Experience shows
that a polymer is soluble in a solvent when the difference between 0 values of
solvent and polymer is not larger than 25% of polymer 0 value [15]. When
mixed solvents are used , their average
~ values are of prime importance in
determining their ability to dissolve a given polymer. Thus there is a series of
mixed solvents that solubilize certain polymers and that are made of nonsol-
vents for the same polymers; some typical examples are given in Table 1.2 [2].

Phase Separation Phenomena
As mentioned earlier, temperature becomes a very important factor for com-
plete miscibility of two liquids when I1Hm > O. Partial miscibility of binary
liquid systems is a well-known phenomenon. For example, hexane and aniline
are completely miscible at a temperature above 60Â°C [2]. But below this tem-
perature complete miscibility of the two liquids depends on the composition of
the mixture. Any system having a composition given by a point under the bell-
shaped binodal curve shown in Fig. 1.2 will separate into two conjugated liquid

phases of fixed composition at a given temperature, one being a saturated
solution of aniline in hexane and the other being a saturated solution of hexane
in aniline. As the temperature increases, compositions of the conjugated solu-
tions become closer and closer and they become equal at 60"C, the upper
critical solution temperature (VCST) for that system. Other partially miscible
liquid pairs show an inverse solubility diagram with a lower critical solution
temperature (LCST); the water-triethylamine pair is a typical example of such
a system. Finally, some systems have both VCST and LCST (water and nic-
otine).
Amorphous polymers have a thermodynamic behavior that is very similar to
that of highly viscous liquids [19]. Their miscibility with poor liquid solvents
resembles that of partially miscible liquids. Obviously, there is a strong molecu-
lar-weight effect and a binodal curve exists for each homologue of a given
polymer, as shown in Fig. 1.3 [20]. As molecular weight increases, the VCST
increases and the maximum of the binodal curve is shifted to low polymer
concentration. A relation between VCST (Tc) and molecular weight (M) has
been derived [8] and is expressed as
liTe = (l/8)(l + blM1/2)
(1.13)
where 8 is the well-known theta or Flory temperature (i.e., the VCST for an
infinite-molecular-weighthomologue) and b is a constant parameter for a poly-
mer-solvent pair. Since the beginning of the 1960s it has been known that
solutions of macromolecules when heated in sealed tubes at temperatures
above the solvent boiling point show phase separation. A series of inversed
binodal curves with LCST (>VCST) can then be obtained [21,22]; they are
mirror images ofbinodal curves such as those shown in Fig. 1.3. Consequently ,
above a LCST there exists another domain of partial miscibility for a polymer
solution. The case of LCST < VCST is observed with water-soluble polymers.
The existence of LCST seems to be general for all macromolecule-solvent
systems and even for systems containing two low-molecular-weight liquids of

sufficiently different chain lengths. Phase equilibria at elevated temperature are
more pressure dependent than those at low temperature. For this reason it is
possible for a two-phase system at a constant elevated temperature to become a
homogeneous system under high pressure [23].
The preceding discussion on phase equilibria may explain the limited use of
some plastic materials at extreme temperature conditions. A perfect indoor
building material made of a plasticized polymer may become a complete mess
when used as outdoor building material in countries where temperature goes
from -60Â°Cin winter to 35Â°Cin summer, as in some northern parts of Canada.
1.2
Reversible Gelation
Gelation occurs when plasticizers and polymers are mixed together. It is a very
important phenomenon in the technology of polymer plasticization and its per-
fect realization is responsible for the good quality of finished products.
From a physicochemical point of view,gelation is the formation of a gel, i.e., a
colloidal system consisting ofa solidand a liquid; it can be a liquid-rich or a rather
dry system. The gelformation isdueto the aggregation ofsomepolymermolecules
in the plasticizersolution;as often occurs in concentrated polymer solutions. In a
dilute solution, polymer molecules are free to move throughout the solution and
their chain conformations are free to oscillate. As concentration increases, chain
entanglement becomes important and intermolecular forces between polymer
molecules also become very important. If the mutual affinity between polymer
segments is larger than the affinity between a segment and a solvent molecule,
contact points are created in some zones between polymer segments because of
intramolecular and intermolecularcohesive forces. The stability of these contact
points is concentration and temperature dependent. In moderately concentrated
solutions or at high temperature, some contact points are broken in a given zone
and some are created in others. The state of the system is intermediate between a
sol and a gel. When the polymer concentration is increased further or the
temperature lowered, chain movements, called reptations in modem polymer
physics, decrease and formation of contact points isfavored . When their number
and stability become sufficient and when the thermal energy is less than the
interaction energy between segments, the equilibrium between the geland the sol
isdisplaced infavor of gel formation. Thus gelation is possible only under certain
conditions, including a minimum polymer concentration. In too dilute a solution
gelation is not possible, since polymer chains are too far apart to form enough
contact points even at room temperature.
The gel and the lyophilic sol in equilibrium with it form a system of uniform
consistency having a continuous spatial structure that occupies all the volume
of the dispersion . A typical example is the gelation of a PVC paste that is a
heterogeneous dispersion of PVC powder in a plasticizer. When the dispersion
is heated, the polymer dissolves in the plasticizer and gelation occurs. Of
course , the temperature for perfect gelation should be above the melting point

1.3: Theory of Plasticization
15
of the polymer, but in the present case, PVC decomposes below its melting
point. So the gelation process takes place at a temperature between 160Â° and
180Â°C where PVC is reasonably stable. In this temperature range, PVC and
plasticizer form a sol initially but a gel begins to appear as concentration of
polymer in the sol increases, inducing the formation of contact points between
swelled polymer molecules. At a temperature well above room temperature,
the stability of contact points is low because of the high thermal energy and
they tend to move from one zone to another. If the solubilized polymer concen-
tration is high enough, this gel structure is stable enough at high temperature to
enable the plasticized polymer to maintain a given form or shape as during the
pressing of plasticized polymers or the modification of coating surfaces by
stamping, for example. On cooling, the kinetic energy of the chains decreases
and contact points are stabilized in the whole system, creating a network of
localized physical links. The gel structure is then solidified into an elastic
material that behaves more or less as a rubber compound , depending on its
degree of plasticization.
This description of gel structure for plasticized polymers is based on still ill-
defined hypotheses. According to X-ray diffraction analysis [24], plasticized
PVC appears as a tridimensional gel cross-linked by pseudo-microcrystallites
[25], but it behaves rather like an amorphous gel.
As mentioned earlier, the degree of realization of the gelation process deter-
mines the quality of physical properties of plasticized products such as resis-
tance to tensile stress , elasticity, adhesion, migration of plasticizer, and so on.
To accelerate the gelation process , pregelation can be produced during the
mixing step.

Theory of Plasticization
1.3.1
Effect of Plasticizers on Thermal Mechanical Deformation of
Rigid Polymeric Chains
Plasticizers are particularly used for polymers that are in a glassy state at room
temperature. Those rigid polymers become flexible by strong interactions be-
tween plasticizer molecules and chain units, lowering their brittle-tough transi-
tion or brittleness temperature (Tb) (the temperature at which a sample breaks
when struck) and their Tg value and extending the temperature range for their
rubbery or viscoelastic state behavior as shown in Fig. 1.4 [26]. This type of
plasticization has a great practical importance. Obviously, the temperature
range for the rubbery state (region b in Fig. 1.4) depends strongly on the
plasticizer content; it goes through a maximum and then disappears completely
when the polymer solution becomes too dilute, as shown by curve 5. But in
some cases the addition of plasticizers to rigid chain polymers has a minor
effect on the extension of the rubbery state domain and plasticized polymers go

directly from the glassy state to the melt state. In the case of plasticized flexible
chain polymers, Tg also decreases, but the viscoelasticity domain decreases
until it completely disappears, as shown in Fig. 1.5 [26]. Moreover, the addition
of plasticizers causes the elasticity modulus to decrease notably [26].

Effect of Plasticizers on Ts and Tg Values

the presence of crystalline parts in certain polymers, size of spherulites, hetero-
geneity of systems when plasticizers and polymers have a low mutual affinity,
and so on. However, it is generally admitted that for a miscible plasticizer-
polymer pair, the value of Tb decreases with increasing amounts of plasticizer.
This effect becomes more important at low plasticizer content, as shown in Fig.
1.6for the tricresyl phosphate-PVC system [27]. The Tg value also decreases as
the plasticizer content increases, as shown in Fig. 1.7 for PVC plasticized by
three different solvents [28].
1.3.3
The Free Volume in Amorphous Polymers
The glass transition phenomenon has been the object of many molecular theo-
ries, that of Ferry [29], further developed by Bueche [30], on the free volume
concept being widely accepted in the polymer field. The volume occupied by a
chain of amorphous polymer consists partly of free space, i.e., the volume
excluded by the movements of segments about their equilibrium position. As
shown in Fig. 1.8, the temperature coefficient for the polymer volume at con-
stant pressure (aVlaDp is higher for the viscoelastic state (curve b) than for the
glassy state (curve a), and it changes abruptly at Tg ; this is the mathematical
definition of the glass transition temperature. It can also be defined as the

temperature below which the free volume in the solid polymer does not de-
crease with temperature any more, as illustrated in the same figure. In the case
of a plasticized polymer, additional "free volume" is introduced with the plas-
ticizer, and the polymer chains are animated by local Brownian motion at
temperatures lower than TgOfor the pure polymer, as shown in Fig. 1.9. The Tg
value for a plasticized polymer decreases linearly with the increasing plasti-
cizer concentration according to the relation [29]:
(I.l4)
where WI is the weight percent of the plasticizer and k is a constant for a given
plasticizer-polymer system. In the case of polystyrene, k varies between 200
and 500Â°C depending on the plasticizer used. Of course, Equation (1.14) is
applicable only to low molecular weight plasticizers [31-33] and for a limited
low plasticizer concentration range as shown in Fig. I.l0 [31,32] for polysty-
rene (PS) in twelve different solvents. Equation (1.14) gives only the first two
terms of a more complicated expression derived for a polymer-diluent system
that fits very well to the experimental results over a larger plasticizer content
range [30]. This relation becomes, at low plasticizer content,

most polymer-diluent systems [30], the constant k in Eq. (1.14) becomes
(1.16)
This simple relation is in very good agreement with the experimental results at
high polymer concentration shown in Fig. 1.10 and can be used to predict the
effect of a given low-molecular-weight plasticizer on Tg of a concentrated poly-
mer-plasticizer system, provided Tg l is known, this quantity being much more
difficult to determine than Tgo'
The effect of plasticizers on the Tg lowering of crystalline polymers is
slightly more complicated. The Tg value is not a function of the degree of
crystallinity but only of the plasticizer concentration at constant degree of
crystallinity. It is then obvious that plasticizers affect only amorphous regions
of a crystalline polymer [34].
Since, for an amorphous polymer, the specific volume varies inversely with
the molecular weight as shown in Fig. 1.11, the free volume also varies in-
versely with the same. This is due to the fact that polymer chain ends contrib-
ute more free volume than segments belonging to the central portion of the
chain and they play the role of plasticizers. So Tg will be a function of the
molecular weight according to the relation [30]
Tg = Tge<> - K/M
(1.17)
where Tge<> is the glass transition temperature for an infinite molecular weight
and this is verified for PS as shown in Fig. 1.12 [35].The constant K is related to
the free volume contributed by a chain. In the case of PS, results show that

each end group contributes a total free volume that is about half the size of a

1.3.4
Primary and Secondary Plasticizers
Mutual miscibility between plasticizers and polymers is an important criterion
from a practical point of view. If a polymer is soluble in a plasticizer at a high
concentration of the polymer, the plasticizer is said to be a primary plasticizer.
When the polymer solubility is limited in the technologically important high
concentration range, the plasticizer is called a secondary plasticizer. In this
case, two phases are present after the plasticization process; one phase where
the polymer is only slightly plasticized and one phase where it is completely

plasticized. Polymer plasticization is present in both cases, but polymers plasti-
cized with secondary plasticizers do not deform homogeneously when stressed
as compared to primary plasticizers. The deformation appears only in the
plasticizer-rich phase and the mechanical properties of the system are poor.
1.4
Classification of Plasticizers
1.4.1
Polar Aromatic and Polar Aliphatic Plasticizers
Plasticizer properties are determined by their chemical structure because they
are affected by the polarity and flexibility of molecules. It can be said that very
mobile long-chain molecules such as aliphatic compounds have an important
effect on the Tg lowering for a given molar concentration [31-33]. But compact
molecules such as aromatic compounds or those whose flexibility is reduced by
substituents, such as chlorine, have a less important lowering effect on Tg â¢ The
polarity and flexibility of plasticizer molecules determine their interaction with
polymer segments. Plasticizers used in practice contain polar and nonpolar
groups and their ratio determines the miscibility of a plasticizer with a given
polymer. For example, Leuchs [32] has divided plasticizers for PVC into two
main groups, according to their nonpolar part:
1.
The first group consists of plasticizers having polar groups attached to
aromatic rings and is termed the polar aromatic group . Examples are phthalic
acid esters or tricresyl phosphate (TCP). An important characteristic of these
substances is the presence of the polarizable aromatic ring. They behave like
dipolar molecules [36]and have been suggested to form a link between chlorine
atoms belonging to two polymer chains or to two segments of the same chain ,
as shown in Fig. 1.13. Plasticizers belonging to this group are easily introduced
within the polymer matrix and are characterized by a good facility to produce
gelation. The polymer-plasticizer miscibility temperature is low enough for
practical use. These plasticizers are called solvent-type plasticizers and their
kerosene extraction (bleeding) .index is very low. They are not recommended
for the production of cold-resistant materials.

2.
The second group consists of plasticizers having polar groups at-
tached to aliphatic chains. It is called the polar aliphatic group . Esters from
aliphatic acids and aliphatic alcohols or alkyl esters of phosphoric acid (such as
trioctyl phosphate) are good examples. Their polar groups interact with polar
sites on polymer molecules, but since their aliphatic part is rather bulky and
flexible, the possibility that polar sites on a given polymer chain might be
screened by plasticizer molecules is likely [36]. This reduces the extent of
intermolecular interactions between two neighboring polymer chains, as shown
in Fig. 1.14. Polar aliphatic plasticizers mix less well with polymers than do
polar aromatics; for this reason they may exude from the plasticized polymer
(bloom) more easily. Their polymer solubility temperature is higher than that
for the first group. They are called oil-type plasticizers and their kerosene
extraction index is high. However, their plasticization action is more pro-
nounced than that of polar aromatic plasticizers at the same molar concentra-
tion. The aliphatic portions of the molecules retain their flexibility over a larger
temperature range, giving a better elasticity to finished products at low temper-
ature. As compared to polar aromatic plasticizers, they allow the production of
better cold-resistant materials, and, in the case of PVC, they cause less colora-
tion and dehydrochlorination under heat exposure [37,38].
In practice, plasticizers usually belong to an intermediate group. For the
plasticized material to meet the requirements for its applications, mixtures of
solvents belonging to the two groups discussed previously are used as plasti-
cizers.
1.4.2
Characteristics of Plasticizers According to Their
Chemical Structure
Plasticizers can also be divided in groups according to their chemical structure
[36, 39-42, 45].

24
I: Plasticizers
Phthalic Acid Esters.
Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DOP) and diisooctyl phtha-
late (DIOP) are largely used for PVC and its copolymers with vinyl acetate or
propene. They have well-balanced properties as plasticizers, i.e., they have
affinity to these polymers, they produce a good solvation, and they maintain a
good flexibility of finished products at low temperature. Their volatility is low
and their water resistance is good.
Diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP), octyl decyl phthalate (ODP), and dicapryl
phthalate (DCP) have a lower solvency. For this reason they are used in stable
PVC pastes.
Butyl octyl phthalate (BOP), butyl decyl phthalate (BDP), and butyl benzyl
phthalate (BBP) are mixed together to obtain special creep properties or to
modify the processibility of PVC blends. These plasticizers have a good sol-
vency and they are used to adjust melt viscosity and fusion time in the produc-
tion of high-quality foams.
The use of n-octyl n-decyl phthalate in the production of plastic materials
allows good flexibility and ductility at low temperature. Its volatility is low and
it is often used mixed with other phthalates.
Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) is mainly used for cellulose-based varnishes and for
adhesives. It is not convenient for PVC plasticization because of its relatively
high volatility, but it is sometimes used in plasticizer mixtures to improve
solvation.
Phosphoric Acid Esters.
TCP, trioctyl phosphate (TOP), diphenyl 2-ethyl-
hexyl phosphate, and tri(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate are used as flame retardants
as well as plasticizers. They have a low volatility, resist oil extraction well, and
are usually combined with other plasticizers. TCP is used with PVC and cellu-
lose nitrate especially for electrical insulators; it is not recommended for elastic
materials to be used at low temperature. TOP is a better choice in this case but
offers a lower resistance to kerosene and oil extraction. Diphenyl 2-ethylhexyl
phosphate can be used for materials designed for low-temperature applications.
Polyfunctional Fatty Acid Esters.
Dioctyl sebacate (DOS), dibutyl sebacate
(DBS), diisobutyl adipate (DIBA), monoisopropyl citrate, stearyl citrate, tri-
ethyl citrate (TEC), butyl and octyl maleates, and fumarates are very important
plasticizers for the preparation of stable PVC pastes and of low-temperature-
resistant PVC products. DOS is used most often because of its high plasticiza-
tion efficiency, its low volatility, and its resistance to water and soap solutions.
It presents many advantages for PVC products. DBS, DIBA, and monoisopro-
pyl, stearyl, and triethyl citrates are recommended for plastics components
intended for packaging of food products. Butyl and octyl maleates and fuma-
rates can be used for internal plasticization, that is, for copolymerization with
vinyl chloride, vinyl acetate, and styrene.
Castor oil and methyl and butyl ricinoleates are specially used with cellulose
nitrates.
Acetyl ricinoleates and acetoxystearates are added to PVC blends used in
cable insulation.

1.4: Classification of Plasticizers
25
Tri(ethylene glycol) di(2-ethyl) butyrate and tri(ethylene glycol) propionate
are plasticizers used with poly(vinyl butyral) sheet to form the intermediate
adhesive coating in safety glass.
Finally, esters from monofunctional fatty acids are represented by butyl
oleate and butyl stearate, which are used as secondary plasticizers (internal
polar lubricants) for PVc.
Polymeric Plasticizers [6].
Polymeric plasticizers are oligomers or polymers
of molecular weight ranging from 600 to 8000. They include poly(ethylene
glycol), polyesters, and polyepoxides.
Poly(ethylene glycol) is used to plasticize proteins, casein, gelatin, and
PVAL.
Polyester plasticizers are condensation products of dicarboxylic acids with
simple alcohols [43,44] corresponding to the two following general formulas:
Ac-G(-AcD-G)n-Ac
AI-AcD-(-G-AcD-)n-AI
where
Ac = monocarboxylic acid
G = glycol
AcD = dicarboxylic acid
Al = monofunctional alcohol
The value of n may vary from 3 to 40 for adipates and from 3 to 35 for
sebacates. Succinic, glutaric, adipic, pimelic, azelaic, trimellitic, phthalic, and
thiopropionic acids can be used as basic units.
In practice, esters from sebacic, adipic, and phthalic acids are frequently
used as polyester plasticizers. They are seldom used alone; combined with low-
molecular-weight plasticizers, they reduce the volatility of the mixed solvents,
and they offer a higher resistance to plasticizer migration and to extraction by
kerosene, oils, water, and surfactants. They are used specially in PVC-based
blends and in nitrocellulose varnishes.
Polyepoxide plasticizers comprise two basic types . The first type is the
epoxidized soybean oils (with a maximum iodine number of 6 and an oxirane
oxygen minimum of 6%), which have a good affinity to vinylic polymers [45].
Compared to plasticizers of the second type, the alkylepoxy stearates (butyl,
octyl), they are less volatile and are less effective for low-temperature plastici-
zation. Polyepoxide plasticizers have less affinity to PVC than primary plasti-
cizers. They are efficient as heat and light stabilizers and for this reason they
are used in synergetic mixtures to stabilize PVC.
Polyepoxide plasticizers are specially used for PVC, for chlorinated rubber,
and in nitrocellulose varnishes. Ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers (EVA) (vi-
nyl acetate content of 65-70% by weight) are also of industrial interest as high-
molecular-weight plasticizers for PVC, mainly because of their low cost [46]. A
polymeric plasticizer commercially available from du Pont (PB-304l) allows the

26
I: Plasticizers
preparation of a highly permanent plasticized PVC formulation. It is believed to
be a terpolymer containing ethylene, vinyl acetate, and carbon monoxide [6].
Also, butylene terephthalate-tetrahydrofuran block copolymers, with the trade
name of Hytrel (du Pont), are used as excellent permanent plasticizers of PVC
[6,47].
One of the first macromolecular plasticizers was butadiene-acrylonitrile
(BAN) rubber [10];the addition of plasticized PVC to nitrile rubber is discussed
by Emmett [48] in a series of property comparisons on sulfur-vulcanized mix-
tures. Advantages of PVC addition to nitrile rubber have been discussed and
several applications for the blend have been cited [49,50]. Optimization of
parameters available to polymer processors of this blend has been extensively
studied [51]. BAN is also used as a plasticizer for PVC-based cross-linked
foams [52].
Many miscible blends with single Tgs are commercially available [6], the
most interesting being Noryl 731 (General Electric Co.), which is a blend of
polystyrene (PS, and poly(2,6-dimethyl-l,4-phenylene oxide) (PPO, 50% by
weight).
Miscellaneous Plasticizers .
Hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons be-
long mainly to the secondary plasticizer type. Aromatic and aliphatic hydrocar-
bons are used as extenders; coumarone-indene resins and coal tar oils are
miscible with rubber and slightly miscible with vinyl polymers . Alkylnaphtha-
lenes are used as lubricants for vinylic polymers . Chlorinated hydrocarbons are
used as secondary plasticizers in PVC, rubber or cellulose acetate-based blends
to increase the resistance to inflammation.
Among other plasticizers, ortho- and p-toluenesulfonamide are used to im-
prove the processibility of urea, melamine and N-ethyl-p-toluenesulfonamide
resins and cellulose-based adhesives. N-ethyl-o-toluenesulfonamide and N-
ethyl-p-toluenesulfonamide are used for the same reason for polyamides, ca-
sein, and zein.
Pentaerythritol esters can be used instead of phthalic acid esters when low
volatility is one of the major factors in the choice of plasticizer for PVC. For
instance, pentaerythritol triacrylate can be used to plasticize PVC and to pro-
duce cross-links under UV radiation [53]. Such plasticized cross-linked PVC
has some application in the cable industry.
As mentioned previously, the great majority of known plasticizers are used
with PVC, which is unstable when exposed to heat or light. Some plasticizers
are easily oxidized and they decompose during the natural aging; this can be
corrected by adding antioxidants [54,55]. Plasticizers that do not contain reac-
tive groups, such as aromatic, hydroxylic, or amino groups, are preferred for
stability reasons [56]. It has been noticed that PVC dehydrochlorination is
always slowed down when phosphates, phthalates, adipates , and epoxidized
soybean oils are used as plasticizers. However, phosphates and most of the
phthalates accelerate the polymer coloration under heat exposure as compared
to PVC alone [57].

Plasticizers/or Other Polymers [42].
In this section commonly used plasticiz-
ers for some polymers beside PVC are listed:
Cellulosics:
DBP, dimethoxyethyl phthalate, (DMEP), triphenyl phos-
phate, cresyl diphenyl phosphate, octyl diphenyl phosphate, some gly-
colates, some sulfonamides.
Polyurethanes:
Most of the plasticizers used for PVC, DBP, DEGB, and
DMEB are preferred for their good plasticization action.
Poly(vinyl butyrals):
glycol derivatives, some adipates, some phosphates.
Poly(vinyl acetate): DBP, BBP, di(ethylene glycol) dibenzoate (DEGB),
2,2,4-trimethyl-l,3-pentanediol diisobutyrate (TXIB), some high-polar-
ity polyesters.
Table 1.3 gives a list of commonly used plasticizers together with some of
their physical properties and their performance with PVC .
1.5
Plasticizer Anomalies and Antiplasticization
One must be aware that addition of a small quantity (up to 15% by weight) of
plasticizer may produce a brittleness effect with plastic materials and some of
their mechanical properties such as impact resistance, ductility, and so on, may
be reduced [58-61]. For example, plasticized PVC suffers a reduction of 50% in
its notched impact strength value by the addition of 10% by weight of DOP as
shown in Fig. 1.15. It is usually noticed that the tensile strength and the flexural
endurance go through a maximum while the impact strength goes through a
minimum upon the addition of plasticizers [60].
It has also been observed that the refractive index of the PVC-TCP system
goes through a maximum as the TCP content increases [61]. This has been
attributed to an increase in the density of the material due to a more compact
organization of polymer chains that occurs on the addition of a small amount of
plasticizer, and X-ray diffraction has shown the formation of crystalline zones
[61,62]. This explanation has been questioned by others who propose that the
observed fragility is due to solvation by the plasticizer [63]. The solvated mac-
romolecules become unfolded and extended and can no longer support a high
impact stress. However, the first hypothesis has also been supported by other
published work [64,65].
It can be said that the greater the plasticizer solvation power, the greater the
fragility effect and the more extended is the effect to higher concentrations of
plasticizer [66]. For this reason the improvement of rigid PVC formulations is
not made by the addition of small quantities of plasticizer but by the addition of
lubricants that, instead of increasing the fragility , reduce it.
The fragility effect seems to be a general phenomenon, and this has been
confirmed for the poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-DBP [67] system and

effect is antiplasticization [69]. The concentration above which the plasticizer
exhibits normal behavior is called the critical concentration [62], and it is in-
versely proportional to the plasticization efficiency [69]. Figure 1.16 shows the

1.6
Loss of Plasticizers
Plastics containing low-molecular-weight plasticizers may become hard and
brittle after a while, and this is accompanied by a decrease in weight due to loss
of plasticizer. This loss changes the physical properties and the quality of a
plastic material with time and may be caused by
1. Plasticizer volatility. In this case, the vapor pressure of the plasticizer and
the diffusion rate of its molecules within the polymer matrix play an impor-
tant role, since the plasticizer molecules evaporate from the surface of the
material. The loss of plasticizers from some plasticized PVC samples is
given in Table 1.5 [70].
2. Extraction of plasticizer by solvents, water, oils, etc., in contact with the
plastic material.

This depreciation of plastics materials is difficult to avoid. When necessary,
it is possible in some cases to replace volatile plasticizers by macromolecular
compounds, such as polyesters, poly(ethylene glycol) derivatives, epoxides,
BAN rubbers, and so on.

Lubricants and Mold-Release Agents
2.1
Lubricants
2.1.1
Principles of Their Action
Lubricants are added to most polymers at low levels to increase the overall rate
of processing or to improve surface properties [1-4]. They have been used in
the past to facilitate extrusion, injection, compression, etc., of many polymers,
mainly PVC, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene terpolymer (ABS), PS, PMMA,
cellulose acetate (CA), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and so on. Figure 2.1
shows the relative importance of these polymers as far as the use of lubricants
is concerned [5]. The most used lubricants and their relative importance in the
United States in 1978 were [6]:
Ca and Zn stearates, 45% by weight
Waxes, 23.5% by weight
Fatty acid amides, 19% by weight
Fatty acid esters, 12% by weight
When used with a good knowledge of the problem to be solved, lubricants often
improve the properties of products (brightness, heat stability in the course of a
processing operation, light stability, resistance to degradation by corrosive
agents and to water absorption, better dispersion of additives, improved elec-
trical, optical, and mechanical properties, etc. [7]). Some examples of lubri-
cants are stearic acid and its Ca, Li, Ba, AI, Pb, etc., salts, natural waxes,
microcrystalline paraffins with a high melting point (to avoid a cloudy appear-
ance and greasy touch of finished products), mineral and vegetable oils, and
whale fat (used to transform Teflon powder into some products).

PVC, 58.6% by weight. B, Polyolefins , 14.5% by weight.
C, PS and its copolymers, 20.9% by weight. D, Other poly-
mers, 6% by weight [5].
A main function of lubricants is to prevent polymers that have a tendency
toward tackiness from sticking on metallic parts of processing machinery; this
is external lubrication. Another important function is to provide internal lubri-
cation to the polymer under processing to improve the free flow ofthe melt bulk
polymer by reducing friction between chain segments. This allows, for exam-
ple, the operation of the mixing process at a higher temperature for a better
homogenization of the mixture of the polymer with additives. These two com-
bined functions give a better output from the processing equipment, and they
also facilitate mold release.
There are many different ways of thinking about the properties, functions,
and classification of lubricants [5,8-20]. For example, in the case of internal
lubricants for PVC, it is usually believed that, contrary to plasticizers, lubri-
cants solvate only the surface of PVC spherical particles or "nodules" pro-
duced by agglomeration of PVC chains in the course of the polymerization
reaction and that behave as independent units during the melt flow of the bulk
polymer [21]. Thus the lubricant acts exactly as an oil in the case of bearing
lubrication and the spherical agglomerates slide directly on a lubricant layer
[22].
With a melt polymer a melt lubricant may form either a homogeneous phase
or a mixture of the two separate liquids according to their mutual miscibility.
This is the reason that melt PVC and a lubricant may form a two-phase system
at least, made of spherical PVC agglomerates dispersed in a liquid solution of
PVC single molecules and the melt lubricant or in the melt lubricant alone if it is
not miscible with PVC [16].
The effect of lubrication on the processibility is shown in Fig. 2.2 for three
types of differently polymerized PVC; the emulsion polymerized polymer
(curve 1) contains emulsifiers that act as lubricants [23]. Obviously, only this
type of PVC with a low molecular weight can be processed without lubricant.
The type of PVC used has also a great effect on the efficiency of each lubricant,
as shown in Figs. 2.3 and 2.4 [23].
Other important considerations in the selection of lubricants are
1. Mutual interaction between lubricants and other additives in the plastic
material (such as stabilizers, fillers, etc.) that may affect their affinity to the
polymer and produce undesired effects, such as plate-out (deposition of
residues from the melt on the metal surfaces of the processing equipment),

and overlubrication, which results in lower output because of excessive
interparticle and particle-metal slippage produced during the fusion stage.
2. The way and conditions of processing polymer compounds because these
factors may also affect the limit of affinity and the rate of migration of
lubricants.
Figure 2.5 represents the relations between the torque of the extruder, the
head pressure, the output, and the screw speed for a well-balanced lubricated
polymer, an underlubricated polymer, and an overlubricated one [9]. To be
effective a lubricant should be slightly soluble in the polymer and should have
some cohesion with the polymer molecules in order not to exude too easily. It
should also possess the following qualities [22]:
1. It should be a long-chain hydrocarbon ended by a polar group.
2. Its melting point should be such that the film produced at the surface of the
polymer particles is strong enough. For example, lubricants recommended
for the extrusion of PVC blends at 165Â°C have melting points between 100

and 120Â°C. It is believed that when lubricants with a lower melting point are
used, the film will not be strong enough and that if lubricants with a higher
melting point are used the film would not be formed at all.
2.1.2
Classification of PVC Lubricants According
to Their Specific Action
Lubricants may be divided into two basic groups, external and internal, accord-
ing to their action [8,24,25]:
External Lubricants.
External lubricants are substances with very low solu-
bility in the polymer; they exude partially from the bulk, creating a separating
layer between the polymer and the metal surface of the processing machine. It
is believed that the polar end of the lubricant molecules is strongly adsorbed to
the metal surface so as to form a stationary layer of lubricant molecules that
then initiates the formation of a multimolecular layer as shown in Fig. 2.6 [19].
The strength of the bond between a lubricant molecule and the metal surface
depends on the nature of the metal surface; it determines whether the adsorp-

tion is physical or chemical in nature . If the lubricant is an acid such as lauric
acid, it reacts with metals such as Cd and Zn but not with Ag, AI, Ni, Cr, etc.
[18].
Internal Lubricants.
Internal lubricants are substances that have a good affin-
ity to the polymer and reduce its viscosity in the melt state. Moreover, they
reduce the heat produced by the action of the friction forces. They also affect

elastic behavior in the course of successive processing steps such as swelling
and melt fracture of the bulk polymer [5]. It has also been observed that exter-
nallubricants extend the plastication time of PVC compounds and that internal
lubricants reduce it [26].
It seems that most of the substances used as lubricants fulfill more or less
two functions, internal and external lubrication. The limit of affinity between a
polymer and a lubricant is the criterion for the differentiation between the two
types of lubrication [27]. In fact, a lubricant begins to act as an externallubri-
cant above a given concentration in the polymer. If its affinity to the polymer is
limited, the mechanical properties of the polymer containing the lubricant vary
with its concentration before the limited affinity is attained. In such cases that
substance functions as a plasticizer.
2.1.3
Classification of PVC Lubricants According
to Their Chemical Structure
The division of PVC lubricants according to their chemical structure seems to
be the most objective one [4,20,28,29]. It is possible then to distinguish between
1. Saturated hydrocarbons, whose lubrication efficiency increases with the
chain length. Solid paraffins (polyethylene waxes with molecular weights
from 2000 to 10,000) are more effective than paraffin oils or low-melting
paraffins (with molecular weight from 200 to 400); a commercial example is
Wachs PA 520, molecular weight 2000. Paraffin waxes, which generally melt
over the range 65-75Â°C, are used in PVC rigid profileextrusion at a level of 1
phr (part per hundred rubber). Polyethylene waxes or oxidized polyethylene
waxes with an acid number of approximately 10-20 are most commonly
used. Oxidized polyethylene waxes are used in rigid profile extrusion at
levels of 0.1-0.2 phr.

40
2: Lubricants and Mold-Release Agents
2. Fatty acids, which act mainly as external lubricants. The higher-molecular-
weight acids have a greater affinity to PVC. Stearic acid is the one mostly
used because of its low price and its availability. Commercial materials used
as lubricants usually contain from 40to 97% stearic acid and the rest is made
of palmitic, myristic , and oleic acids. Example: stearine or 12-hydroxy-
stearic acid, commercial name, Ceroxin GL.
3. High-molecular-weight alcohols, which differ from fatty acids in their
action. They have more affinity to PVC and do not exude at concentrations
used in practice (-2%). They are considered internal lubricants. Example :
cetylstearyl alcohol, commercial name, Stenol PC.
4. Metal soaps, which are external lubricants and are among the best mold-
release agents. In some cases they improve heat and light stability of PVC.
Examples: Li, Sr, Ca, AI, Ba, Pb, etc., stearates.
5. Waxes, the most effective of which are esters offatty acid and high-molecu-
lar-weight monofunctional alcohols. The two long chains attached to the
polar group (which is respons ible for affinity to PVC) produce very good
lubrication. Examples: wax from partially saponified montanic acid (com-
mercial name, Wachs OP), ester with CZ8 and C3Z chains (commercial name,
Wachs E), stearyl stearate (commercial name, Loxiol G-30). Montan wax-
based esters, acids, and salts are longer in chain length (CZ4 to C34) than fatty
acids and are therefore more externally active. They are especially suited
for the calendering of clear rigid films and sheets.
6. Fatty acid monoesters, which have good molding properties and act as
secondary plasticizers, affecting the mechanical properties of the polymer.
Examples: butyl and octyl stearates.
7. Partially esterified polyfunctional alcohols by fatty acids, of which three
different types are used:
a. Hydrogenated tallow glycerides (HTG):
CH3(CHz)16COO-CHz
CH3(CHZ)16COO-tH
CH3(CHz)16COO-tHz
b. Glyceryl monostearates (GMS) or glyceryl monoricinoleates, which exist
in two forms: o-glyceryl monostearate: CH3(CHz)16COOCHzCHOH-
CHzOH, and l3-glyceryl monostearate: CH3(CHz)16COOCH(CHzOHh
c. Esters of sorbitol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, pentaerythritol, and
high-molecular-weight alcohols. They function as internal lubricants. Ex-
amples: glycerol monoricinoleate (commercial name, Loxiol G-IO),fatty
acid glyceryl monoesters (commercial name, Gleitmittle Hoechst FE 2).
8. Fatty acid bisamides, which have outstanding external lubrication proper-
ties. Examples: ethylene bisstearoylamide (EBS), CH3(CHzh6CONHCHr
CHzNHCO(CHz)16CH3, ethylene bisoleoylamide (EBO), CH3(CHzhCH =
CH(CHzhCONHCHzCHzNHCO(CHzhCH = CH(CHzhCH3, bisamide with
CI6 and CI8 chains (commercial name, Wachs C [Hoechstj), ethylene bis-
stearoylamide (commercial name, Interlab G 8257).

2.1.4
Lubricants for Polyolefins
41
Reports oflubricants for polyolefins are rare in the technical literature [30,31].
For polyolefins Farbwerke Hoechst AG recommends the use of Wachs PA 520,
which improves rheological properties of the melt bulk polymer and the bril-
liance of the surface of finished products without affecting mechanical proper-
ties. Furthermore, it reduces the danger of stress corrosion in thick wall pieces
produced by injection molding. It is also suitable for regulating the melt index.
Polyethylene (PE), with a molecular weight of 2000, is also recommended as a
lubricant for polyolefins by Bareco (Petrolite Corp.).
Hoechst Wachs C can be used in the production ofPE or polypropylene (PP)
films. Hoechst Wachs OP (0.1-0.3 phr) can be used for polyolefins. This last
lubricant acts also as an antistatic agent. Hoechst FA 3 (0.5 phr), a fatty acid
amide, is recommended for injection molding of polyolefins. Stearamide and
erucamide are used in polyolefin processing. They have lubricating effects but
are primarily added for the slip properties they impart to the finished prod-
ucts [4].
Witco Chemical Corporation recommends calcium stearate in PP process-
ing; it protects the die of the extruder from scratches and cuts and the sieves of
the injection molding machine from clogging. Sodium stearate is recommended
for special types ofPP. Calcium stearate is also recommended by Mallinckrodt,
Inc. (RSN 248D) to neutralize traces of catalyst in PP and to reduce the deposit
of catalysts on extruder sieves. The PVC lubricant Interstab G 8257 is also used
for polyolefins ABS and PS.
Axel Plastics Research Laboratories mentions INT 30 UDK as an internal
lubricant and a mold-release agent for polycarbonates and polyolefins. It pro-
vides better transformability and improves rheological properties of the melt
bulk polymer; it prevents the formation of flow lines in the production of sheets
by extrusion blowing. It is also an antistatic agent [30].
2.1.5
Basic Properties Necessary for Lubricants
The normal rules used for the selection of lubricants are as follows [17]:
1. Metal soaps, mainly stearates, function as external lubricants, since they
possess low affinity to all polymers.
2. Long-chain fatty acids, alcohols, and amides act as internal lubricants for
polar polymers such as PVC, polyamides, and so on, but have low affinity to
nonpolar polymers such as polyolefins.
3. Long-chain dialkyl esters have medium affinity to most polymers and can
act both as external and internal lubricants for polymers; they are often used
to obtain a balanced lubrication [9].
4. High-molecular-weight paraffin waxes function as external lubricants for
polar polymers because of their low affinity to them, but they have a high
affinity to polyolefins and are used then as internal lubricants.

In many applications different lubricants are used together to obtain special
properties for the plastics materials. The total quantity of lubricants used in
most formulations varies between 1 and 2% by weight. Lubricants are added
either during the preparation of compounds in millingmachines, extruders, and
so on, or in the course of the polymerization reaction.
Most frequently used lubricants and their relative effects are given in Table
2.1 [32].

Mold-Release Agents
2.2.1
Principles of Action
The adhesion or sticking of some plastics materials such as resins of phenol-
formaldehyde, epoxides , polyesters, and so on, on elements of processing
machines, especially molding machines, is a problem that is solved by the use
of mold-release agents. This adhesion is due not only to intermolecular forces
between the plastic and the metal but also to the mechanical sticking at the high

temperature produced by the friction of the material on walls of processing
machines.
Mold release is facilitated by a better design of molds (avoiding sharp angles,
using vents, etc.), by keeping walls of the molds clean and polished , and by
reducing the friction coefficient between plastic materials and molds. This last
approach is achieved by the use of extemallubricants or by pulverizing mold-
release agents inside molds. The use of mold-release agents increases the pro-
ductivity of molding processes such as compression molding, injection mold-
ing, production of plastic bottles by extrusion blowing, or injection blowing.
2.2.2
Some Examples of Mold-Release Agents
Waxes, soaps, and silicones are used as mold-release agents. Paraffin waxes
are not very convenient, since they are removed from mold walls by plastic
materials. Their chemical structure is such that their adhesion to metals is
weak.
Soaps offer a better adhesion to metals because of the polar part of their
molecules. However, they also can be removed by plastic materials , since they
have a long and bulky nonpolar chain that is weakly attached to the metal
surface by only one point.
Silicones, mainly polydimethylsiloxane, are excellent mold-release agents.
Their chains contain numerous polar groups that adhere strongly to the metal
surface, and their methyl groups, pointing away from the surface, facilitate the
flow of the melt plastic material. Silicones function thus as a permanent separa-
tion layer. Their heat stability is relatively high (around 300Â°C)and no carbon
film is formed when they decompose. However, their presence creates some
problems when impression or metallization is to be done afterward on the
surface of products.
Mold-release agents are used in the form of powders, oils or jellies, solu-
tions, sheets , or films. As sheets, cellophane, PVAL, CA, and so on, are used.
Some lubricants and mold-release agents with some specific applications are
listed in Table 2.2.

Macromolecular Modifiers
3.1
Introduction
Macromolecular modifiers are used to improve some physical properties,
mainly mechanical properties of polymers. They have found wide-spread
application in the reduction of basic defects of polymers in their glassy state,
mainly their resistance to low-energy impact, and they are used also to modify
rheological properties of polymer melts [I] .
The incorporation of macromolecular modifiers into glassy polymers is done
by melt mixing or by graft copolymerization. This last technique is used, for
example, when the impact strength of PS is to be improved, since adding a
macromolecular modifier such as a styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) by melt
mixing with that polymer was not found satisfactory [2]. For PVC the use of
macromolecular modifiers to improve the impact strength , mainly the notched
impact strength, which is very low in this case (close to 3 kJ m- 2) , without
affecting tensile strength, rigidity, heat distortion resistance, and so on, has
been very successful. The cross-linking copolymerization can also be used to
incorporate macromolecular modifiers in the case of PVC, but melt mixing is
also widely used. As was just mentioned, the problem of the improvement of
the impact strength of glassy polymers is related to the preservation of their
other desired physical properties and also of their processibility, resistance to
environmental aging, finished surface, and so on.
For reasons of economy, PVC modification by melt mixing is done with
powdered macromolecular modifiers. In this case most of the polymer mixing
and processing techniques can be used. For a rubbery macromolecular
modifier that can be reduced only into granules or chips, the mixing is techno-
logically more complicated and more energy consuming. Since a given macro-
molecular modifier cannot fulfill all of the properties needed for a finished

51
product, many macromolecular modifiers must be known for a given polymer
for general and specific applications .
Modification by melt mixing presents many interesting research problems.
In recent years the problem of polymer mixing and the study of the morphology
of resulting blends have become more and more scientifically and practically
important [1,3,4]. Polymer blends obtained by melt mixing are more or less
homogeneous mixtures. In the English technical literature polymer-polymer
blends are classified according to the following scale [3]:
Compatible > almost compatible > ambiguous > incompatible
This classification is based on many experimental works. The terms compatible
and incompatible are easily understood, but the other two need to be clarified
by experimental results. Variations in the meaning given to the words compati-
bility and miscibility when speaking about polymer-polymer blends are based
on experimental works using different criteria that are very subjective and not
always exact. For this reason, it is essential to return to basic thermodynamics
of mixtures and not to try to give confusing meaning to well-known terms. The
definitions of solubility, miscibility and compatibility have been well discussed
by Olabisi et al. [1]. According to these authors, solubility is the accepted term
for single-phase solvent-solvent and polymer-solvent mixtures , whereas for
polymer-polymer blends, miscibility has been chosen when such blends behave
like single-phase systems. The term compatibility can be used not to describe
single-phase behavior of polymer-polymer blends but good adhesion between
constituents, an averaging of mechanical properties, ease of blending, and the
behavior of two-phase block and graft copolymers.
3.2
Homogenization of Polymer-Polymer Systems
When the proper mixing technique is used, it is possible to attain a degree of
dispersion of two or more different polymers sufficient to prepare polymer-po-
lymer blends in most cases [5]. Even in the case of two nonmiscible polymers,
it is possible to prepare a mixture of the two by melt mixing. On cooling, the
mixture may look homogeneous, since constituents cannot separate because of
the high viscosity of the system, but phase separation can be easily detected at
the microscopic level by the study of physical properties of the system [5,6].
Two polymers are miscible when they form a thermodynamically stable
single-phase system [6]. Such is the case when the mixing of two amorphous
polymers at constant temperature and pressure is accompanied by a net de-
crease in the free enthalpy of mixing, i.e., b..Gm < 0 [1,5-8]. As mentioned in
Chapter 1, this condition is easily realized for an exothermic mixing (b..Hm< 0),
but when b..Hm > 0, the miscibility becomes possible only if Ib..Hml < TIb..Sml.
By admitting that the total thermal energy of mixing Qm = -b..Hm, it be-
comes possible to estimate the value of b..Hm. However, as shown by the

52
3: Macromolecular Modifiers
results given in Table 3.1, heat can be produced on mixing two nonmiscible
polymers [7]. This experimental fact is a good indication that !:1Sm may play an
important role in the evaluation of !:1Gm for polymer-polymer systems. Statisti-
cal and classical thermodynamics show that the entropy contribution is a func-
tion of the molecular density (number of molecules per unit volume of the
system). The higher the molecular density, the higher the degree of random-
ness. Consequently, the entropy contribution should decrease as molecular
weights of constituents increase. Thus the change in entropy per unit volume or
mass on mixing macromolecular species should be very small as compared to
low-molecular-weight constituents [1,5-9]. The value of T !:1Sm for two differ-
ent monomeric liquids is of the order of 17 x 106 J m? at room temperature. If
one admits that association forces between molecules of pure liquid polymers
and between two different liquid polymers are of negligible importance, then
T !:1Sm is of the order of 17 x 103 J m- 3 [7]. However, some amorphous
polymers behave like supercooled liquids at room temperature, and then
molecular association becomes very important. It is thus necessary to look at
the problem from another point of view in order to calculate T !:1Sm for poly-
mer-polymer systems [10]. Experimental results have shown some degree of
association between two different polymers being mixed together. The ex-
perimental estimate of the value of T !:1Sm is very difficult to realize , but it has
been shown by Flory et al. [10]that it can be calculated using the equation-of-
state approach. For example, they have calculated thermodynamic mixing
functions for the polyethylene-polyisobutylene (PE-PIB) system, and results
are shown in Table 3.2.
On the other hand, the value of !:1Hm per unit volume or mass is about the
same for two different chemical entities whether they belong to polymeric
chains or not, since in both cases the number of interacting groups is the same
independent of molecular weight. As a result, the mutual miscibility of two
different amorphous polymers is governed by the sign of /iHm , which should be
negative to form a single-phase system. But many experimental works have
demonstrated that a great number of polymer-polymer blends never reach a

thermodynamic equilibrium and that their high viscosity prevents them from
achieving complete phase separation [3]. It has been mentioned that phase
separation exists at the microscopic level (corresponding to the length of a
segment) and that this state is produced by the increase in the total enthalpy of
the system in the course of the mixing process in most cases [8].
Research works have revealed that the basic criteria that play an important
role in the determining of mutual miscibility of polymers are the following:
1. The difference between solubility parameters of polymers [3,11-14].
2. The
behavior of mixtures

[5,8,15-25].
3. The difference between polarities of polymers [3,13-15,26]

5. The regular distribution of the functional groups along the chain and the
degree of crystallinity [27]
3.3
Two-Phase Microheterogeneous Polymer-Polymer Systems
The theoretical treatment and the preparation of two-phase glassy polymer-
elastomer systems that are characterized by a high impact strength have been
discussed in many papers [2,3,15,35-38], but the problem is not yet completely
solved. It should be said, before going any further, that the resulting modifica-
tion of a glassy polymer by mixing it with an elastomer does not depend only on
the chemical nature and on the structures of the polymers; it depends also on
the method and conditions of mixing.
3.3.1
Effect of Glassy Polymer Matrix Phase on Impact Strength
It is generally admitted that the glassy polymer that forms the basic structure,
that is, the matrix of the system, should have a high molecular weight. This is
based on the fact that the quantity of the elastomer, the macromolecular modi-
fier, needed to obtain a high impact strength decreases as the molecular weight

of the glassy polymer increases, as shown in Fig. 3.1 [39]. A too low molecular
weight for this polymer will also create some difficulties at the rubbery phase
dispersion level [40].
The impact strength of the modified polymer is sometimes affected by the
technique used for its preparation. For instance, the impact strength of (BAN-
rubber}-PVC blends is higher for PVC prepared by emulsion polymerization
than for PVC prepared by suspension polymerization [40].
3.3.2
Effect of Rubbery Phase Dispersed in Glassy Matrix
on Impact Strength
The necessary properties of the rubbery phase have been discussed by many
authors [37,39-42]. They are as follows:
1.
It is necessary for the dispersed rubbery substance to have a Tg value
lower than the temperature at which the high-impact material is to be used.
Many elastomers will satisfy this condition; they are butyl rubber, polybuta-
diene, SBR, BAN,
ethylene-propene elastomer, polychloroprene, EVA,
polyisoprene, polyacrylates, PIB, and chlorinated polyethylene (CPE) elasto-
mers. However, they are not all useful for specific blends such as PVC-based
blends because they do not fulfill the other necessary properties.

2.
The rubbery constituent must have more or less affinity to the glassy
polymer forming the matrix; that is, the solubility parameters of the two poly-
meric compounds should have values not equal but not too far apart in order to
obtain a complete adhesion between the two separated phases. This point is
confirmed, for example, in the case of PVC modified by BAN rubbers for which
the 8 value increases with the acrylonitrile content in the copolymer. It is
observed that the notched impact strength of the blend is maximum for an
acrylonitrile content of about 20% by weight, but when this content is less than
20% (nonmiscible with PVC) or larger than 20% (easily miscible with PVC),
the adhesion between the rubbery phase and the glassy phase decreases, yield-
ing a lower impact strength , as shown in Fig. 3.2 [37]. Moreover, it has been
observed that the optimum impact strength of elastomer-PVC blends is ob-
tained when the rubbery constituent has a 8 value between 400and 800 JI/2 m- 3/2
less than that of PVC as shown in Fig. 3.3 for (BAN rubber)-PVC blends with
20% by weight of acrylonitrile [43].
3.
However, the rubbery phase should be immiscible with the matrix poly-
mer. Rubbers miscible with glassy polymers function as macromolecular plasti-
cizers for these polymers , showing a decrease in Tg value, toughness, elasticity
modulus, and so on. When miscible rubbers are used in small quantity, they
produce antiplasticization (see Section 1.5). Polyurethane elastomers are typi-
cal examples of those miscible rubbers [40].
4.
The optimum morphology is another property necessary for good im-
pact strengths of two-phase polymer systems . According to a theory that attri-
butes improved impact resistance to the presence of rubbery particles, it is
necessary to obtain a solid dispersion made of rubber particles of 1000-2000nm
in diameter within the glassy polymer matrix, as shown in Fig. 3.4 [44]. On the
other hand, another theory assumes that the rubbery modifier functions as a
continuous lattice-like phase having a honeycomb structure [45-47]. If the

optimum morphology, whatever it looks like, is destroyed, the impact strength
of the system decreases. For this reason the impact strength of the modified
material depends on the process it is submitted to and on the type and the
content of all other additives present in the material [48-50]. The lowering of
toughness of a material during the mixing process usually results from the
destruction of the optimum morphology because of slipping forces or overmill-
ing [37,38,40,51,52]. This effect is very noticeable in the case of PVC-EVA
blends, whereas PVC-CPE blends resist overmilling well. It is possible to
determine the sensitivity to overmilling for a blend by using the Brabender
plastograph in connection with impact strength measurements [50]. For exam-
ple, a comparison of the plastogram obtained for a PVC-EVA blend with its
notched impact strength as a function of mixing time is shown in Fig. 3.5. The
resilience goes through a maximum at the inflection point of the plastogram
where the optimum morphology of-the system is supposedly obtained [47,50].

3.3.3
Theory on Toughness of Microheterogeneous Two-Phase
Polymer-Polymer Blends
The theory on toughness of rubber-modified glassy polymers went through
many development steps [34,39-41,44-46,53-75], but it seems that the mecha-
nism of the dissipation of the impact energy is now well established.
High-impact rubber-reinforced glassy polymer systems may be divided into
two groups [45,46]:
1. Systems containing rubbery particles dispersed within the glassy matrix, as
in the case of high-impact PS and ABS.
2. Systems with the rubbery phase distributed in a continuous lattice having a
honeycomb structure. The glassy matrix is thus divided by the rubbery
lattice into more or less isolated regions.
Good examples of the second type of structure are PVC-EVA and PVC-BAN
systems. The rubbery phase dispersed in this way allows a maximum absorp-
tion of the impact energy. The rubbery-glassy matrix interphase initiates craze
formation on impact , providing points of stress concentration as shown in Fig.
3.6 [76].This structure results from the cold drawing ofthe matrix and does not
involve mass discontinuity on impact; it shows double refraction and a low
refractive index and can support a load. The crazing process appears after a
certain induction period and disappears on heating [72]. This modification of

the mass into an organized structure is related to impact energy absorption [73].
The mechanical damping of the modified polymeric material is higher than that
of the unmodified glassy polymer and can play an important role in the im-
provement of toughness of glassy polymers modified by elastomers. Thus, at
each deformation of the material, some heat is produced, which makes the
temperature of the glassy matrix increase toward its Tg value, giving more
flexibility to the material.
The particles of the rubbery phase allow the formation of many points with a
high stress concentration; most of the heat produced by the impact is dissipated
at these points, which can thus be deformed to a high degree of elongation [74].
At the same time, as the temperature increases at these points when the mate-
rial is submitted to a high impact, the Tg value of the glassy matrix decreases,
since the Poisson ratio is smaller than 0.5 [61]. The negative hydrostatic pres-
sure responsible for the lowering of Tg is created by the following factors:
1. The contraction, which is different for the two phases when the material is
cooled down.
2. The difference in the Poisson ratios for the two phases; the volume of the
glassy matrix increases under the deformation while the volume of the rub-
bery phase does not change practically, since its Poisson ratio is 0.5.
3.4
Impact Modifiers for Glassy Polymers
3.4.1
Chlorinated Polyethylene (CPE)
Chlorinated polyethylene (CPE) is largely utilized to reinforce PVC [77]. The
properties of this impact modifier depend on its molecular weight, on the de-

3.4: Impact Modifiers for Glassy Polymers
59
gree of branching of the original PE, on the mode, temperature, and degree of
chlorination, and on the regularity of the distribution of chlorine atoms along
PE chains [78]. The degree of chlorination should be between 30 and 45%.by
weight. The Tg values for CPE are between - 30 and - 10Â°Cand their molecular-
weights are above 100,000. It is possible to melt mix PVC with CPE in almost
all ratios , but when the CPE content predominates, mixing problems appear,
since the melt viscosity of CPE is larger than that of PVC.
CPE-modified PVC is commercially available and Farbwerke Hoechst
(B.R.D.) has been the first producer of this impact-PVC under the trade name
Hostalit Z [79]. Many types of PVC-CPE blends are available as powdered or
granulated products that differ from each other in CPE content, in molecular
weight of PVC, and in color. A concentrate that is almost pure CPE with a
chlorine content of 48% by weight that contains about 1% of PVC powder to
prevent the formation of agglomerates during storage is available under the
trade name Hostalit Z 9970. This product is used to prepare PVC-CPE blends
of desired composition.
For comparison, the notched Izod impact strength of unmodified PVC with a
molecular weight of 150,000 varies between 3 and 5 kJ m- 2 at room tempera-
ture , depending on the care taken in the preparation of test specimens, whereas
for PVC modified by Hostalit Z 9970 at 20% by weight , it goes up to 50 kJ m- 2 â¢
Electrical properties and the chemical resistance of PVC do not change once
modified in this way ; only the processibility, mainly in the case of extrusion, is
slightly reduced. These modified PVC materials have good light and heat stabil-
ity and they are not transparent; they can be cross-linked by peroxides and
metal oxides [80]. CPE can be used as an additive in plastics formulations to
improve flammability test ratings [81].
In more recent years, CPE has been included in the production program of
many firms such as I.C.I. , Allied Chemicals, Dow Chemical, Shown Denko,
and Israel Petrochemical Ent.
Here is a short list of well-known commercial CPE:
Hostalit Z 9970 (Farbwerke Hoechst AG, B.R.D.). It contains 1% by weight
of PVC; the chlorine content is 48% by weight; its density is 1286
kg m".
Tyrin QX 2243-6 (Dow Chemical Co., U.S.). The chlorine content is 40.2%;
its density is 1205 kg m- 3â¢
Plaskon CPE 500 (Allied Chemical Co., U.S.). The chlorine content is
40.1%; its density is 1205 kg rn".
Plaskon CPE 102(Allied Chemical Co. U.S.). The chlorine content is 45.3%;
its density is 1205 kg m- 3â¢

Ethylene-(Vinyl Acetate) Copolymers (EVA)
The
selection
of
ethylene-(vinyl
acetate)
copolymers
is
very
large
[27,31,34,82-85]. It comprises low-molecular-weight waxe s, elastomers, and
plastomers. One type of EVA has been produced commercially for many years

60
3: Macromolecular Modifiers
by E. I. du Pont de Nemours Co., Inc. (U.S.) under the trade name Elwax 150.
This copolymer contains approximately 37% by weight of vinyl acetate. It is
sold in a granular form. It is designed for the direct modification of PVC by
improving its processibility [86], but it is not recommended for the production
of transparent and high-impact plastic materials . For these applications it is
better to use Levapren 50 produced by Farbenfabrik Bayer AG (B.R.D.) [87].
Another version, Levapren 450 P, is recommended for direct modification of
glassy polymers. However, pure EVA elastomers are actually used for the
modification of PVC by direct mixing with certain restrictions, since they can-
not be supplied in a powdered form because of their rubbery character, and
mixingthem with PVC is then more complicated. For this reason one uses vinyl
chloride graft EVA for the production of many types of impact-PVC; those
containing 5-10% by weight of EVA are used for direct processibility and those
containing up to 50% of EVA are used as powdered modifiers. As commercial
examples of these types of modifiers, one may mention Levapren VC 45/50
(Bayer), Vinnol 315/65 (Wacker Chemie), and Hi-Blen (Japanese Geon).
It should be noted that PVC-EVA blends are highly sensitive to overmilling;
this sensitivity is affected by lubricants , stabilizers, fillers, and so on [50].
Low-density and high-density PE or PP can be reinforced by the addition of
EVA or ethylene-(ethyl acrylate) copolymers [1].
Examples of EVA-based modifiers are as follows:
Elwax 150(du Pont de Nemours, U.S.). The vinyl acetate content is 37% by
weight; its density is 951 kg m" : sold in small granular form.
Levapren 450P (Farbenfabrik Bayer, B.R.D.). The vinyl acetate content is
45% by weight; its density is 978 kg m": sold in small lenticular gran-
ular form.
Levapren VC 45/50 (Bayer). This is vinyl chloride grafted Levapren. The
EVA content is about 50% by weight, the chlorine content is 28%; its
density is 1163 kg m": sold in small pearls form.
3.4.3
Acrylic and Methacrylic Elastomers and MBS and
ABS Terpolymers
Good examples of these modifiers are poly(butyl acrylate) and poly(isooctyl
acrylate). These polymers have low Tg value (under -50Â°C) but they cannot be
used as impact modifiers for PVC, since they adhere too strongly to metallic
surfaces. This is why their monomers are particularly used to produce rubbery
modifiers through the preparation of linear or graft copolymers with vinyl chlo-
ride [88]. A good example of these linear copolymers is Lucovyl H 4010(Pechi-
ney-Saint-Gobain, France). Its vinyl chloride content is 50% by weight and its
density is 1135 kg m-3â¢ It is designed to produce PVC-based high-impact trans-
parent materials and when added to PVC at 20% by volume, the notched
impact strength rises to about 40 kJ m- 2 â¢ Such high-impact PVC is produced
by Pechiney-Saint-Gobain under the trade name of Lucorex.

3.4: Impact Modifiers for Glassy Polymers
61
An acrylate-(vinyl chloride) type graft copolymer is produced by BASF Corp.
under the trade name of Vinoflex 719. The molecular weight of the PVC chain is
37,000and the chloride content is 50.5% by weight. Vinoflex can be mixed with
emulsion-polymerized PVC and it is designed for outdoor applications.
For the production of wrapping materials , modifiers such as graft terpoly-
mers of the type (methyl methacrylate)-butadiene-styrene (MBS) have been
developed [89]. Some of these modifier also have the properties necessary to be
used in the production of transparent and colorless PVC-based high-impact
materials. The transparency of products is obtained when refractive indices of
both the modifier and PVC match.
The structure of MBS terpolymers is such that particles of elastomer are
wrapped in a thin layer of (methyl methacrylatel-styrene copolymer, which is
responsible for the good adhesion of the modifier to the PVC matrix. It is then
necessary to choose the best styrene-butadiene ratio not only to get the maxi-
mum adhesion to the matrix, but also to obtain the smallest differences in
refractive indices between the modifier and the PVC matrix [90,91]. Some
examples of modifiers based on MBS terpolymers are shown in Table 3.3. Graft
ABS terpolymers are used either directly as high-impact materials or as PVC
modifiers. Generally, the rubbery phase of these terpolymers is made of emul-
sion-polymerized polybutadiene, which constitutes the main chain, and the
glassy phase is made of styrene and acrylonitrile side chains. Modifiers pro-
duced from graft ABS terpolymers usually improve the finish of surfaces and
the tenacity of products and the high-temperature ductility of PVC sheets.
Some examples of these modifiers are given in Table 3.4. Other ABS-PVC
blends are also commercially available under the trade names Cycovin (Borg-
Warner), Abson (Abtec), and Polyman (Shulman). In these blends the processi-
bility and the heat distortion temperature are improved by the presence of
ABS, whereas the flame retardancy is due to PVC [1]. These blends find many
applications where high temperature may cause a severe stress on materials
used in products such as sanitary ware, power tool handles, communication
relays, electrical terminal blocks, and electric housings [93]. It is not always
necessary for ABS-polymer blends to show complete miscibility, but mechani-
cal compatibility a~ least should be observed [94]. Examples of such commer-
cial blends are bisphenol A polycarbonate-ABS available under the trade
names Cycoloy (Borg-Warner) and Bayblend (Mobay) [93-95].
Specific properties of polymers are sometimes improved when blended and
this is the case of impact PMMA-PVC blends sold commercially under the
trade names DKE (du Pont), Kydex (Rohm and Haas), and Polydene
(Shulman) [1,93,95]. Atactic PMMA forms two-phase blends with PVC but the
syndiotactic version shows miscibility with the same [1].
3.4.4
Rubbers
Rubbers are not very suitable as PVC modifiers. However, Montecatini Edison
S.p.A. has put on the market a BAN rubber (20% by weight of acrylonitrile)

* Paraloid K 120N (powdered PMMA) should be added to Paraloid KM 607 (and also to Paraloid KM 61I) to obtain a good transparency for modified
PVC. The processing of these blends is done at high temperature to produce high-quality surfaces.

in a coarse powder form that has allowed us to smooth away the technologi-
cal difficulties encountered with the mixing of PVC with rubbers . This rubber is
sold under the trade name Elaprim S-364-P and its density is 972 kg nr'. It
contains an antioxidant to prevent the coloration of products so that it can
be used in the preparation of light-colored blends. It is not recommended for
the production of transparent blends, nor for outdoor applications. The
notched impact strength of PVC materials containing 20% by volume of Ela-
prim goes above 60 kJ m?
[92].
Another rubber used in the production of impact-PVC is polybutadiene,
sold under the trade name Asadene NF 35 A (Asahi Chemical, Ind., Japan). It
has a yellowish aspect, and it contains an antioxidant to prevent coloration.
Asadene is recommended to enhance the efficiency of other modifiers, such as
EVA, ABS, MBS, and Hypalon (chlorosulfonated PE, du Pont). It is supplied
in a block form and its density is 911 kg m'. Other products named Asadene
NF 45 A and NF 55 A have a higher molecular weight. Similar rubbers are
produced by International Synthetic Rubber Co., U.S., under the trade name
Intene. (The last two mentioned companies are producing rubbers under li-
cense from Firestone Plastics, U.S., trade name Diene.)
The polybutadiene rubbers are mostly used in the production of impact-PS,
and they are also recommended, as mentioned earlier, as a substitute, in total
or in part, for some impact-PVC modifiers, mainly ABS. Contrary to this
terpolymer, polybutadiene rubbers are not suitable for the production of trans-
parent materials.
Other elastomer blends of commercial utility have been cited in the literature
[96-98]. Polyolefin blends have been utilized in many forms to achieve modifi-
cations yielding environmental stress rupture resistance and to improve impact
strength, flexibility, and filler acceptance [99,100]. The addition of ethylene-
propylene rubber (EPR) or blends of EPR and high-density PE to PP has been
specifically utilized for improving the low-temperature impact strength [l01].
Low-modulus materials can be produced from EPR-PP blends containing more
than 50% of EPR. These products include those under the trade names TPR,
Somel, and Telcar [102-105]. Addition of rubber inclusion has been shown to
yield definite improvements in the environmental stress rupture resistance
[106]. Other examples of commercial rubber-based blends are impact-PS, ABS
and bisphenol A polycarbonate blends and polysulfone blends made of a block
copolymer of polysulfone and nylon 6 [107].
3.5
Macromolecular Modifiers Used as Polymer
Processing Aids
The improvement of polymer processibility without reducing mechanical prop-
erties is a very important problem mainly in the case of difficultly processible
and thermally unstable polymers. PVC is the most important polymer among
these and the use of lubricants as PVC processing aids has been discussed in

3.5: Macromolecular Modifiers Used as Polymer Processing Aids
65
Chapter 2. Some macromolecular modifiers can also act as processing aids, and
for PVC the most efficient ones are acrylic and methacrylic polymers, MBS and
ABS terpolymers, EVA copolymers, (vinyl chloride)-(vinyl acetate) copoly-
mers, or (vinyl chloride)-propene copolymers. The efficiency of these modi-
fiers as PVC processing aids is related to a good mutual polymer-polymer
miscibility. The miscibility of EVA copolymers with PVC depends on the vinyl
acetate content of the EVA. The copolymers with more than 50% vinyl acetate
are already miscible with PVC, and they are used mainly as processing aids.
(Vinyl chloride)-(vinyl acetate) or propene copolymers also show good
properties as PVC processing aids. They mix well with this polymer and they
lower the melt viscosity indices of blends. The tensile strength and the tough-
ness of the resulting products are not affected by the presence of these copo-
lymers. High-elastic-modulus ABS terpolymers are generally utilized as mod-
ifiers when high-temperature tensile strength and minimum shrinkage are
needed for materials under processing [108]. Otherwise, they do not significant-
ly affect the physical properties of rigid PVC; for example, they do not increase
its notched impact strength contrary to low-elasticity-modulus ABS. It is also
possible to lower the melt viscosity index of blends by a factor of 10by the use
of polar elastomers such as BAN copolymers containing at least 25% of acrylo-
nitrile. But at the same time, the rigidity of the material is lowered.
Other examples of commercially available macromolecular processing aids
are [111 ,112]:
l.
Acryloid K-120N (Paraloid K-120N) (Rohm and Haas, V .S.A.). This is a
95/5 (methyl methacrylate)-(ethyl acrylate) copolymer sold in a powdered
form. When added to PVC or to PVC modified by MBS terpolymers at a rate of
3-5%, the processibility is greatly improved. So are the tensile strength , the
high-temperature elongation , and the transparency of materials. For these rea-
sons this modifier is largely used actually in the production of bottles made of
PVC-MBS blends by extrusion-blowing, particularly to obtain a constant wall
thickness for large bottles or containers.
2.
Degalan V 26 (Degussa, A.G., B.R.D.). This is a 90/10 (methyl
methacrylate)-(butyl acrylate) copolymer. It mixes well with PVC and it does
not affect its transparency, water absorption, and electrical properties. It is
suitable to modify the rheological properties of impact-PVC. It shortens the
plastication time of PVC mixtures and it improves their homogenization and
the extrusion output. The addition of Degalan V 26 also improves the heat
stability of PVC mixtures and increases the resistance of PVC-based products
to heat distortion.
Sometimes a macromolecular modifier may produce undesired effects. Such
is the case of Microthene F (powdered PE) recommended by V.S.1. Chemicals
Co. (Div., National Distillers and Chemical Corp., V.S .) as a PVC modifier.
When blended with PVC at 6% by volume, the notched impact strength of the
material goes to a maximum value of 9 kJ m? [92]; adding more Microthene
will lower this value. Since this modifier acts also as a lubricant, it lowers the
processibility of PVC blends.
Complete immiscibility may be desired in certain applications of polymer

Chapter 4
Reinforcing Fillers, Reinforcing Agents,
and Coupling Agents
With polymers, reinforcing fillers, reinforcing agents, and coupling agents form
materials called composites. They may completely change the specific proper-
ties of polymers by chemical and/or physical modification. The development
of these additives is important and their actual production is very large. It is
thus logical to treat them in this chapter in the order given in the title.
4.1
Fillers
4.1.1
General Characteristics of Fillers and Composites
Fillers are added to polymers to modify their basic properties or to lower
production costs of final products. They act on almost all properties, including
density, hardness, tensile strength , impact strength, chemical resistance, heat
distortion temperature, processibility, and even the appearance of final pro-
ducts. Fillers are widely used with rubbers and thermosetting resins, mainly
phenoplasts and aminoplasts. Their use in thermoplastics is still limited, but it
is rapidly developing [l ,2].
It is possible to distinguish between two kinds of plastic composites [3]:
1. The high-performance composite . The plastic material is used to encapsu-
late reinforcing elements (continuous fibers) to produce suitable shapes and
structures [4,5]. This is also called unidirectional reinforcement. In this case
the plastic material is the minor constituent (20-50% by volume) and the
composite is normally in the form of a laminate.

4.1: Fillers
71
2. The low-performance composite . In this case the properties of the compo-
site are nearer to those of the plastic material, the major constituent. Short
fibrous or particulate reinforcing fillers are added in small quantity (5-25%
by volume) to enhance physical properties of the plastic material, making its
processibility easier or increasing its overall quality.
4.1.2
Fillers for Thermosetting Resins
Fillers enhance most of the properties of phenoplasts and aminoplasts , but the
resulting effects depend on the nature of the fillers and on their content in the
composites. For example, the effect of wood flour content on the resistance to
compression of molded objects goes through a maximum at about 25% by
volume, as shown on Fig. 4.1.
Fillers used for phenoplasts and aminoplasts include the following:
1. Substances of organic origin, such as wood flour, used for consumption
products and in the production of electrical insulation; cellulosic fibers (tex-
tiles, paper fibers and particles) used mainly to increase impact resistance;
fruit shell flour, which increases the fluidity of plastic materials under press-
ing and enhances the dielectric properties and appearance of final products;
protein flour-casein and soya flours for example-used with carbamides.
2. Substances of inorganic origin, such as asbestos (chrysotile , anthophyllite) ,
used to increase the resistance to heat and to acids and in fibrous forms to
enhance mechanical properties; mica, which gives good dielectric properties
and good heat resistance; lead and barium compounds, used as X-rays ab-
sorbents; slate; cement; graphite ; silica; sand; talc; and so on.

Fillers for Plastomers
4.1.3.1
Polymer Reinforcement Factors
Reinforcement denotes increasing the modulus and strength of a plastic mate-
rial by adding to it a much stiffer and stronger compound. The important
factors for polymer reinforcement are the size and specific area of filler parti-
cles, chemical composition of their surface, their facility to form chains and
agglomerates, and the degree of dispersion of the particles within the polymer
[7].There are many concepts on the mode of action of fillers. Many believe that
the polymer and the filler interact only in the rubbery state [8-10]. According to
that point of view, cohesive forces between polymer molecules below Tg are
essentially larger than adsorption forces between them and the surface of filler
particles and this is why a fillerdoes not greatly enhance mechanical properties
ofthe polymer. Close to Tg , both types offorces become almost equal, because
ofthe increase in the kinetic energy of polymer molecules. In the rubbery state,
above Tg , cohesive forces become smaller than adsorption forces. Above a
given temperature, called the wettability temperature, adsorption forces pro-
duce reinforcement. This wettability temperature is always above Tg , but when
it is too far above it, adsorption forces become less important and the filler is
less active. Below the wettability temperature, partial or total separation of the
polymer from the filler surface occurs.
According to other points of view [l 1], polymer-filler interaction manifests
itself in the rubbery phase as well as in the glassy phase, but in a different way.
This assumption is supported by many works on addition of fillers to glassy
polymers. Theoretically, the increase in polymer strength should be deter-
mined by the strength of the chemical forces and by the number of oriented
chains parallel to the stress axis. However, this ideal strength, called the
" molecular strength," is many orders of magnitude larger than the real strength
of macromolecular compounds. The low molecular strength of these com-
pounds is explained by the theory of defective zones because of the fragility of
the apparently homogeneous mass [12]. A defective zone (notch, microfrac-
ture, foreign particle, etc.) creates at that point a stress concentration depend-
ing on the size of the zone, its shape, its location, and its macroscopic global
arrangement, which determines the stress distribution. The stress concentra-
tions localized at the defective zones may be larger than a weak external stress.
Defective zones lower the fracture activation energy and they participate to
initiate fracture and affect its growth. From this point of view, fillers lower the
mechanical properties of glassy polymers, since their particles may create
defective zones. This picture does not correspond exactly to reality, since, on
the other hand, filler particles may stop the formation of a regular microcrystal-
line structure and thus increase the impact strength of the composite [13]. For
example, it has been shown that precipitated calcium carbonate (Winnofil S,
I.C.I. Ltd. , England) increases the impact strength of PVC [14].
Factors facilitating fracture growth are sharp edges of filler particles and the
shape of the particles and their packing, mainly if they are localized in the zone

4.1: Fillers
73
of highest fatigue. Obviously, the formation of a fracture is facilitated by poor
cohesion between polymer molecules and the surface of filler particles. The
nature and the growth of the fractures are affected by the presence of large
particles or agglomerates, the degree of dispersion of filler particles , and attrac-
tion forces between them and polymer molecules. The growing fracture will
cross the polymeric mass or will meet a filler particle or an agglomerate. In this
last case the fracture will go through the particle or the agglomerate or will pass
around it and then cohesive forces will play an important role. If these forces in
the agglomerate or at the polymer-filler interface are smaller than the intermo-
lecular forces between polymer molecules, the filler lowers the energy neces-
sary for the formation of a new surface, decreasing at the same time the impact
strength of the composite. On the other hand, when cohesive forces are suffi-
ciently large, the fracture may split in two, increasing its course, and thus the
energy necessary to form a new surface will be larger. For example, it has been
shown that PVC as a saturated polymer is sensitive to the surface quality of
the filler particle and as a polar polymer it has a greater affinity to fillers having
polar groups [15]. Carbon blacks with low oxygen contents, being nonpolar, do
not have sufficient affinity to PVC, but once they are oxidized they behave like
silica fillersfor this polymer. Since oxidized carbon blacks affect the relaxation
process of PVC, one must admit that there is interaction between the two
components. It is also interesting that suspension-polymerized PVC behaves
differently from emulsion-polymerized-PVC toward silica fillers. The reason is
that the emulsion-polymerized polymer retains the emulsifier, a surface-active
agent, and this facilitates the dispersion of the filler in the polymer and mainly
improves the wettability of the surface of the filler particle , making the adsorp-
tion of the polymer molecules much easier. The interaction between silica
fillersand PVC molecules is also larger for the emulsion-polymerized type than
for the suspension-polymerized one.
In the case of PVC, small filler particles have little effect on its tensile and
flexural strengths, whereas large filler particles lower the tensile strength. The
PVC flexural and notch impact strengths are lowered by large polar and nonpo-
lar filler particles; however, small polar particles enhance the notch impact
strength.
The addition of fillers to PS has also been studied [16].It has been found that
the toughness of PS filled with bentonite increases to a maximum value when
9% by weight of this filler has been added . A modification of the surface of the
particles by octadecyl amine increases their affinity to PS and thus the effi-
ciency of the filler. It has also been found that the flexural and impact strengths
of PS and PMMA are diminished in all cases by the addition of fillers in increas-
ing amount, and the importance of these effects depends on the size of filler
particles.
Many research and development programs on this type of composite have
been created in recent years and many interesting aspects have been discov-
ered. As was mentioned previously, the addition of fillers to polymers affects
mainly the tensile strength and the elasticity modulus (E modulus) of compos-
ites. In addition to these properties, other important physical properties such as

74
4: Reinforcing Fillers, Reinforcing Agents, and Coupling Agents
structure stability at high temperature, thermal expansion, electrical and ther-
mal conductivities, and the permeability to gas and vapors are affected [17].
A composite forms a ternary system made of the polymer, the filler, and the
polymer-filler interface, the structure and properties of which have been dis-
cussed by many authors [18-20] . This transition layer includes polymer modifi-
cations induced by the surface of the filler particle and vice versa, filler modifi-
cations induced by the polymer (the adsorption layer), and the layer enriched in
low-molecular-weight fractions [18]. The thickness of this layer varies from 3 to
30 nm [19-20] .
Relations for the tensile strength and the E modulus of the composite and for
other interesting factors related to the transition layer have been derived [18].
In linear and cross-linked polymers, it has been found that the lowering of the
mobility of the chain segments and the slight increase in cross-link movements
that result from filler incorporation are due to adsorption forces [21].
The limitation of the macromolecules flexibility and perhaps the supermo-
lecular structures created by the presence of the filler make relaxation pro-
cesses more difficult and are responsible for increases in the elasticity modulus
and Tg values [19,22,23]. On the contrary, as long as the filler does not affect
too much the mobility of the structural segments, the E modulus is only slightly
or not at all affected [19,22].
4.1.3.2
Classifications of Fillers for Plastomers According
to Their Reinforcement Activity
Based on the mutual interaction between fillers and polymers, it is possible to
classify fillers into two groups, active and inactive [22]. This classification is
rather arbitrary [24], since it is based not only on differences in chemical
composition but also on characteristics of filler particles surfaces, particle
shape and size, and treatment of the surface by coupling agents (see Section
4.4).
The shape and size of particles depend mainly on the mode of preparation of
fillers. Most of the amorphous fillers having a spherical shape are produced by
fast processes as, for example, precipitated silicas and pyrogenic silicas. Fillers
produced by slow processes ,generally have a crystalline structure, such as
kaolin, chalk, zinc oxide, barite, and so on.
The filler activity is conditioned by the mutual adhesion of the polymer and
the filler; it corresponds to the physicochemical character of the polymer-filler
interface, which determines the extent of sorption processes on the solid sur-
face as well as the type of polymer-filler bonds.
Inactive fillers function as stress concentration agents. They imitate the
fracture in the polymer mass and lower the energy necessary for the physical
destruction of a compounded plastic [20]. In crystalline polymers it has been
determined that inactive fillers are concentrated in the amorphous regions
[19,22].
Active fillers interact with polymer molecules through van der Waals forces,

4.2: Reinforcing Agents for Laminates
75
chemisorption forces, and, eventually, covalent forces. Van der Waals forces
precede chemisorption forces , since they function only at short distances and
they manifest themselves when the surface of filler particles present good wet-
tability. These forces have a small effect on the mechanical strength of the
adhesion bond, and they may even decrease it by softening superficial layers
[25]. Chemisorption forces manifest themselves, for example, in the case of
water repulsion by the composite [25]. It is possible to create chemical bonds
with the surface of inorganic filler particles by using coupling agents (see Sec-
tion 4.4).
The effect of a filler appears after its content in the polymer matrix is suf-
ficient to form a structure capable of transmitting an exterior load. Fillers
function in the polymer matrix at short distances by affecting segments of the
main chain and side groups, mainly at the polymer-filler interface , as well as at
long distances (150-200 nm from the surface of the composite) through inter-
molecular forces [19,26].
4.2
Reinforcing Agents for Laminates
Reinforcing agents are substances having a shape and a structure, such as long
or short glass fibers, paper, glass, or metallic mats. They are necessary to
reinforce resins (mainly thermosetting resins such as phenol-formaldehyde res-
ins, polyester resins , epoxide resins , etc.) and plastomers, such as plasticized
PVC. Reinforcing agents , generally in a fibrous form, are impregnated with
polymers and then molded into different shapes. Products thus obtained are
called laminates and they possess remarkable mechanical properties.
Glass fibers are used for maximum reinforcement, but prior to their use, they
need to be delubricated (i.e., to be purified from any organic substance that
mightaffect the adhesion between glass and the resin). Delubrication is done by
any of the following methods:
1. Carbonization at 300Â°C of organic lubricants used to ease the spinning of
glass fibers
2. Burning lubricants at 500-600Â°C
3. Washing, the least efficient method
After delubrication of the fibers a coat of a substance (coupling agent, adhe-
sion promoter) is spread over the glass fibers to enhance the adhesion between
glass and the resin. As an example, methacrylato-chromium chloride (Volan A)
[27] is used to promote adhesion between glass fibers and epoxide or phenolic
resins. Silane coupling agents-for example, vinyl-trichlorosilane (Garan)
[28]-are very effective in this case. Isocyanates and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)
are also used [29]. For melamine and phenolic laminates, other types of rein-
forcing agents are used besides glass fibers. Included among these are wood,

cotton, synthetic fibers [30], and crepe paper [31,32], which ease molding pro-
cesses. Asbestos fibers are used to produce materials of high chemical resis-
tance [33].
4.2.1
Effect of Fillers or Reinforcing Agents
on Basic Physical Properties of Composites
Interaction between fillers or reinforcing agents and polymers affects the fol-
lowing basic physical properties [34]:
1. Elasticity modulus (it is more affected by reinforcing agents than by fillers).
2. Tensile strength (reinforcing agents increase it; fillers decrease it).
3. Impact strength (reinforcing agents may increase or decrease it, but fillers
decrease it).
4. Heat distortion resistance (fillersas well as reinforcing agents improve it but
the effect of reinforcing agents is greater).
5. Shrinkage (fillers and reinforcing agents decrease it; in the case of fibers,
longitudinal shrinkage is smaller than vertical shrinkage).
Among important characteristics that affect physical properties of compos-
ites are the type of additive, the shape and the size of filler particles, and the
type of coupling agent.
4.3
The Different Types of Fillers and Reinforcing Agents
4.3.1
Glass Fillers and Reinforcing Agents
Glass fillers and reinforcing agents are used in the form oflong and short fibers,
continuous-strand roving, woven roving, mats , chopped and milled fibers, solid
and hollow microspheres, and flakes. Properties of glasses used as reinforcing
agents for plastics are given in Table 4.1 [35].
4.3.1.1
Glass Fibers
Glass fibers are used to reinforce plastics in the production of a series of
materials with a wide range of cost-performance advantages. Glass fibers pro-
vide strength, dimensional stability, and heat resistance to composites [36].
The arrangement of fibers determines the direction and level of strength that is
achieved. There are three general types of fiber orientation: unidirectional,
bidirectional, and multidirectional.
Type A and G glasses are used with polyamides. There is not a large differ-
ence between the two, only that the type A lowers electrical properties of

products because of their high moisture content [21]. These products can be
improved afterward by adding aminosilanes or glycidyloxipropylsilane. Type E
glass (with 8-12% BZ03) is used in electrical applications. It is recommended
when high light transmission and maximum mechanical properties (about 10%
more than values obtained with type A glasses) are desired for the final prod-
uct. Type E glass is also used as reinforcement for laminates made with
polyesters , epoxide resins, and polyamides [37]. Glass fibers for laminates
made with polyesters must contain less than 1% of alkaline substances and
must show a good resistance to hydrolysis (0-0.12 mg of Na-O in the extract)
[29].
When two or more reinforcing agents are included in a polymer matrix, the
resultant composite system is designated as a hybrid [38]. Hybrids allow de-
signers to trade off properties and economics to achieve a cost-efficiency
balance. A common example is the hybridization of glass and carbon fibers.
A surface treatment is applied to facilitate processing, to maintain fiber
integrity, and to establish compatibility with specific resin systems.
4.3.1.2
Glass Microspheres
A knowledge of the geometry of reinforcing agents and fillers is essential to
effective use of the materials . Shapes to consider besides the fiber are the
sphere, flake, and broad miscellaneous categories including cubes, blocks , and
irregular shapes. Except for the fiber and sphere, irregularity is more common
than geometric shapes. In addition, there are considerations of size, density,
and surface characteristics [39].
Spheres clearly have no aspect ratio (ratio of length to thickness) to provide
reinforcement properties, but their geometry affords important advantages in
processing. Their effects are isotropic and they have the smallest surface area
of any shapes and they have the smallest influence on melt flow. This and a kind
of ballbearing action permit very high loading with relatively little rise in vis-
cosity. Composites filled with glass spheres have reduced and predictable
shrinkage and low distortion. With solid spheres compressive strength is parti-
cularly high, and hard and smooth surfaces can be achieved.
Solid and hollow spheres are used. Solid microspheres are also called bal-
lotinis (after the name of the first producer, Ballotini in Belgium, B.R.D. and
G.B.). They are available in many sizes, ranging from 4 to 5000 nm [40,41].
Type A glass is used in the production of solid microspheres. They enhance
many mechanical properties such as tensile strength, flexural strength, com-
pressive strength, and elasticity modulus , but they lower the ductility, the
elongation at break, and the cold flow. They are used mainly to fill polyamides
(polyamide 6,6 may contain up to 40% by weight of microspheres for injection
molding), ABS, and PVC [37]. In comparison with short glass fibers, the micro-
spheres have the same effect on water absorption and flammability of compos-
ites but at a lower production cost. In some applications they are used in
connection with short glass fibers.
Hollow spheres have the same geometric advantages as the solid ones.
Contribution to compressive strength is limited to the crush resistance of the

sphere, and this varies with the thickness and the composition of the wall [39].
They are produced from alkaline glass beads . They are used in such thermosets
as epoxies and polyesters processed by compression molding, hand layup,
sprayup, and casting. The spheres also work well in such thermoplastic sys-
tems as vinyl plastisols and foams, and they improve thermal and acoustical
insulations. Major advantages of hollow spheres are their low density and their
low cost. Thus they reduce the weight and the cost of plastic products; they
also reduce their flammability [37]. Of course, the density of hollow glass
spheres depends on their wall thickness; for example, the density is 0.142
g mL- I for a wall thickness of 1 mm for Eccospheres FTD 146 (Emerson and
Cuming, U.S.), and the density is 0.175 g mL - I for Q-Cel (Philadelphia Quartz
Co., U.S.). They are known to offer a high crush resistance [42,43].
4.3.1.3
Glass Flakes
Flakes have an aspect ratio that makes them useful in reinforcing plastics.
Flakes tend to orient as the resin mix flows and form a layered fish scale
structure. This serves as an impervious coating protecting against infiltration
and corrosion [39]. Parallel flakes pack solidly, giving a relatively high filler
content in minimal thickness. This flake orientation adapts well to a number of
molding processes, such as vacuum forming and rotational molding, and to
processes with directed flow, such as extrusion, injection molding, and
sprayup.
Flakes are produced by grinding 0.15-0.20-mm-thick glass sheets made of
semialkaline type A glass, followed by sieving. They are used essentially as
fillersfor thermosets, for example, and to increase the chemical and the micro-
biological resistances of polyesters [41]. Disadvantages of flakes are the sharp
ends, which cause high stress concentration, and the need to guard against
breaking thin flakes in mixing and molding.

4.3.2.1
Fibrous and Flaky Fillers and Fibrous Reinforcing Agents
Fibers made of calcium sulfate, silicon carbide , silicon nitride , carbon (Thornel
P produced by Union Carbide), asbestos, aromatic polyesters, Aramid, etc.,
can be used as reinforcing agents [1,33,43-47]. For example, Aramid-Kevlar
(the aromatic polyamid fiber produced by du Pont Co.) was developed to re-
place steel in radial tires [48]. It is finding broad application where light weight,
high strength and stiffness , resistance to stretch, and resistance to damage are
important. Aramid can be combined with glass or carbon fibers in hybrid com-
posites.
Carbon fibers' efficiency is low since they are fragile and they break in the
course of processing. They are supplied in the form of mats , rovings, and
prepregs (e.g., by Courtaulds, England). Polymers reinforced with these fibers,

80
4: Reinforcing Fillers, Reinforcing Agents, and Coupling Agents
when compared to those reinforced with glass fibers, have an elasticity modu-
lus twice as large, a specific modulus about three times as large, and a thermal
expansion coefficient about twice as small [42]. Carbon fibers, also often incor-
rectly called graphite fibers [49], are characterized by a combination of light
weight, high strength, and high stiffness. All carbon fibers are made by pyroly-
sis of organic precursor fibers in an inert atmosphere (from 1000 to 3OO0Â°C).
Only three precursor materials-rayon, polyacrylonitrile , and pitch-have
achieved significance in commercial production of carbon fibers.
Asbestos fibers enhance properties of finished products according to the
type of asbestos used [1]. Asbestiform is used to describe naturally occurring
inorganic minerals that, when mechanically processed, form fibrous or acicular
structures. The generic name asbestos includes chrysotile (a fibrous form of
serpentine) and a variety of amphibole fibers. Chrysotile accounts for about
95% of commercial asbestos. Both chrysotile and, to a much lesser degree,
crocidolite (an amphibole) are used in plastics at the present time. Other forms
of amphibole fibers, such as anthophyllite and tremolite, are much less fibrous
and in very limited supply. However, composites filled with asbestos fibers
show in all cases a lower tensile strength than those filled with the same quan-
tity of glass fibers. Asbestos fibers only affect positively the flexural strength ,
the dimensional stability [42], and the chemical resistance [33] of composites.
Other fibrous reinforcing agents are cellulosic fibers, PTFE, PVAL, metal-
lic, kaolin [50], and basalt [51] fibers, and mixtures of glass and mineral fibers
[46].
4.3.2.2
Whiskers, Microfibers, and Powdered Fillers
Whiskers and microfibers are discontinuous high-strength fibers that range
from a few hundred to a few thousand nanometers in diameter with a length-to-
diameter ratio from 10 to 1 to several hundred to I [1]. The major difference is
that whiskers are essentially perfect single-crystal fibers while microfibers are
generally polycrystalline or imperfect single-crystal fibers. The structure of
whiskers is acicular ; they are generally flexible and have elongations in the 2-
4% range. Microfibers generally have elongations of 1% or less.
All reinforcing whiskers are grown by various types of high-temperature
vapor transport chemical reactions that have a definite refining aspect to the
whisker precursor materials, while most microfibers are precipitated from a
solution or a molten bath. As a result, microfibers do not contain the crystalline
perfection attributed to good whisker products. The choice between whiskers
and microfibers for composite fabrication is not governed by their crystallinity
but by their respective overall qualities. More than 100 materials, including
metals, oxides, carbides, halides, nitrides, graphite, and organic compounds,
have been prepared as whiskers [1]. Specific examples are aluminum oxide,
aluminum nitride, beryllium oxide, boron carbide, magnesium oxide, silicon
carbide, and silicon nitride.
The following are a few examples of commercially available microfibers [1]:
1.
Fybex (du Pont Co.), which consists of single-crystal inorganic titanate
microfibers with relatively high modulus and reasonably high strength, which

4.3: The Different Types of Fillers and Reinforcing Agents
81
qualify it as a reinforcement for plastics. In general, molding conditions for
thermoplastics reinforced with Fybex are similar to those for unreinforced
counterparts. In general, property improvements with Fybex in thermoplastics
are comparable to those with glass fibers at equal weight loadings. The stiffness
of plastics reinforced with Fybex is generally higher than glass fiber com-
posites. Fybex has been particularly effective in reducing the coefficient of
thermal
expansion.
It
is
used
mostly
with
polyamides,
polysulfone,
poly(phenylene oxide), ABS, and PVC.
2.
Dawsonite (Aluminum Co. of America-Alcoa, U.S.), which is sodium
aluminum hydroxycarbonate, NaAI(OHhC03 , and is synthetically manufac-
tured in acicular form. It improves tensile and flexural strengths and moduli,
increases the heat deflection temperature, and lowers the coefficient of thermal
expansion of composites of PE, rigid PVC, and ABS resins. Dawsonite decom-
poses at 300-320Â°C giving off CO2 and H20, so it functions also as a flame
retardant.
3.
Franklin Fiber (Certain Feed Products Corp.), which is fibrous crystal-
line calcium sulfate in the beta anhydride form. It has a white, lustrous appear-
ance and a soft, silky feel. It is recommended for polyamides, asphalts, mineral
cement, paper, and paints. It improves the tensile strength and increases the
modulus of elasticity of plastics.
4.
Processed Mineral Fibre (Coal, Iron and Chemicals Division, a Jim
Walter Co.), which is basically 75% calcium silicate with a balance consisting
of oxides of aluminum, magnesium, and other lightweight metals. Its diameter
ranges from WOO to 10,000 nm (average 5000 nm) and its length averages
275,000 nm. The manufacturer gives an average range for the aspect ratio of
40-60.
Powdered fillers, also called low-aspect ratio fillers, are mainly of inorganic
origin. Patents mention many inorganic powdered fillers [52-54]. They function
as inactive fillers and also as reinforcing agents for many plastics, such as
polyolefins, polycarbonates, polyformaldehyde, polyamides, PVC, epoxies,
and polyesters [55,56]. Most often recommended are feldspar, wollastonite,
mullite, asbestos, silicon, silicates, cristobalite, a series of metals, AI, Zn, Pb,
Mn, Ba, Ti, Fe, Co, Ni, etc., and their oxides, carbonates, and basic mineral
compounds such as spodumene, montmorillonite, kaolin, bentonite, etc. Pow-
dered fillers are added in large quantities, 40-90% by weight of composite.
Irregular particles with relatively low-aspect ratio are not classified as rein-
forcing agents, although some, like alumina trihydrate, may be used, primarily
because they impart a specific property; they are generally treated as extenders
[57]. Even in the extender category, filler science is providing a greater variety
of materials, a larger range of particle sizes, and more surface treatment. This
surface treatment, done by coupling agents, allows us to improve rheological
properties of composites and mechanical properties of finished products.
Examples of powdered fillers having low-aspect ratio follow [55,57,58]:
1.
Calcite (CaC03) , which has a hardness of 3 on Mohs' scale and a
density of 2.7 g mL - I, is classified as a nonreinforcing filler, it improves many
physical properties of PVC, PE, PP, epoxies , polyesters, and polyurethane
foams when added at 10% by weight. Its dispersibility in the polymer matrix is

82
4: Reinforcing Fillers , Reinforcing Agents, and Coupling Agents
increased by treatment of the grain surface with stearic acid or hydrophobic
resins.
Stearic-acid-treated calcite powder is used in the production of PVC pipes
(because of its low affinity for humidity), of soft or rigid plastic shapes, and of
other composites. Calcite is also used in composites designed for electrical
insulators and cables. In the case of cross-linked PE, calcite improves its
dielectric properties, toughness, ductility, elasticity, and production cost. Cal-
cite powder specially treated for PP and thermoplasts is available from the
following producers: Pfizer Inc., Thompson, Weinman and Co., and Georgia
Marble (U.S.). PP-calcite composites contain up to 40% of calcite.
Nontreated calcite powder, but having a special crystalline structure, is
produced by Dixie Lite and Stone Co. The company's bulletin mentions that
this is a better filler than treated calcite powder for PVC pipes.
Solemite (Solem Industries) is a microground calcite powder with grain size
between 0.004 and 0.01 mm used in the production of PVC pipes, sidings,
caulkings, and coatings. It is characterized by a lower tendency to agglomerate
than other commercial calcite powders. It is also available treated with cou-
pling agents such as organotitanates (see Section 4.4.2); this treated filler de-
creases the time necessary to obtain a good dispersion in the polymer matrix,
increases the extrusion output, and increases the impact strength of compo-
sites. However, it costs about 3.5 times more than the nontreated filler.
2.
Alumina trihydrate (Ah03. 3HzO), which has a hardness of3, is used as
filler for polyester composites and as a flame retardant. Alumina trihydrate is
low in cost and must be used in light loading to be effective, so that it serves
well as a resin extender [57]. All noncombustible fillers help by reducing the
amount of resin, but alumina trihydrate also releases water when subjected to
high heat and actively retards combustion (see Section 12.3.4). It is found in
polyesters, in cast acrylics, epoxies, and PVC. Coupling agents can improve
flow of the resin mix.
3.
MgO and TiOz increase flexural strength and toughness and decrease
cold flow of composites.
4.
Fine powdered BeO , at 70% by weight, increases thermal conductivity
of epoxy resins.
5.
ZnO has a hardness of 4.5; it is used mainly as a filler for elastomers, PP,
and polyesters. The composite made of PP filled with ZnO shows a great
resistance to moisture and weathering. ZnO can also react with free carbonyl
groups in polyester resins, leading to composites with remarkable physical
properties.
6.
ZrOz and Fez03 increase notably the modulus of PP.
7.
Metallic powders, mainly aluminum and brass powders, are used with
acetals or polyamides in the production of electrical conducting composites
that can be easily metallized. Aluminum and zinc powders increase the physi-
cal properties of PP significantly, Addition of nickel powder to PVC produces
composites with increased toughness and lower porosity. Copper powder is
used as a stabilizer and reinforcing agent for polyamide 6,6.
8.
Mica,
such as muscovite [KzAI4(AhSi60zo)(OH4], and
phlogopite

83
[K2(MgFeMAhSi602o)(OH)4], improves thermal and mechanical properties of
polyurethanes, PS , ABS, SAN, and PE [59].
9.
Kaolin, a form of clay, is used as a filler in refined natural form or
calcinated for both thermosets and thermoplastics [57].
10.
Talc is a reinforcing filler for mineral-filled PP. Product uses include
many injection-molded automotive parts. Other use s include talc and glass fiber
(25/15) reinforced nylon, used in the automobile industry [I].
As has already been mentioned, powdered organic fillers are extremely im-
portant in the production of phenoplast and aminoplast composites (see Section
4.1.2).
4.3.3
Effect of Content and Size of Fillers on Composite Properties
Mechanical properties of composites made of filled phenoplasts and amino-
plasts go through a maximum value with increasing filler content (see Fig. 4.1).
But this is not the case for plastomers, since the optimal filler content depends
on the application the composite is designed for, on the desired properties of
the final product, on the processing [60] as well as on the size of filler particles
[4,5,61], and on the type of treatment of their surface [62].
In crystalline polymers, the filler content has a great effect on crystallization
kinetics and thermodynamics and on characteristics of the interfacial layer.
Their flexural and tensile strengths and elasticity depend on the filler content
[21]. Glass fibers behave as an inactive filler in polycaprolactam at low content
where the particles are individually dispersed. At higher content, filler particles
form a spatial arrangement and then glass fibers behave as a reinforcing filler. In
the case of polyamides, about 25-40% by weight of glass fibers is currently
used [63] and even up to 65% with polyamide is used in molding [53]. Tensile
strength increases only at high glass fiber content; at the beginning, it goes
through a minimum at 5% of glass fiber and then attains the value for raw
polyamide at 10% of filler and continues to increase by further additions of
glass fiber [60]. The notch impact and the flexural strengths vary also in a
similar way, with a maximum value appearing at 30% by weight of filler for the
first and at 50% for the second. This effect of the filler content is explained by a
reinforcement effect due to the arrangement of filler particles into a network at
about 30% by weight of filler; at higher content the filler particles are no more
regularly and perfectly dispersed in the polymer matrix nor wetted by polymer
molecules [64].
It should be emphasized that relations between the filler content and physi-
cal properties of a composite are specific to a filler-polymer system not only
because of the chemical nature of constituents and the specific differences
between fillers , but also because of the average molecular weight and the mo-
lecular-weight distribution of the polymer and, in the case of filled polymer
blends, because of the composition of blends.
In the case of fibers, their shape is very important besides all other charac-
teristics. The elasticity and the flexural and tensile strengths of composites are
governed by the length of fibers and by their orientation in the polymer matrix

84
4: Reinforcing Fillers, Reinforcing Agents, and Coupling Agents
[3,34,65}. It is true that long fibers ensure a good binding in the polymer matrix,
but they break easily. By using short fibers, a good dispersion of the particles is
obtained, but the overall toughness of composites is lowered. However, it is
practical to use glass fibers shorter than 0.1 mm [63]. The optimal length of
fibers for polyamide 6 composites is between 0.3 and 1mm [66], the lower limit
being 0.15-0.25 mm [67]. The uniform size distribution of fibers in the polymer
matrix is also an important factor [2l}.
4.4
Coupling Agents
Overall quality of composites can be improved by the use of coupling agents to
treat the surface of filler or reinforcing agent particles. The improvements are
more apparent when composites are exposed to high humidity and high temper-
ature. Coupling agents enhance adhesion between the filler and the polymer;
they create a strong bond between the two at their interface. Coupling agents
may be fixed to fillers prior to their addition to polymers or they may be added
directly to polymers. This last technique has the disadvantages that larger
quantities of coupling agents are required and that longer times are needed to
obtain good adhesion between the filler and the polymer compared to the case
where the coupling agent is fixed to the filler first [68}.
Surface-active agents can be used to favor interactions between a hydro-
philic filler and a hydrophobic polymer, for example, but this type of coupling is
not very effective. Stearic acid and its metallic salts are good examples of
surface-active agents. Their effect may be simply described as an increase in
the wetting of filler particle surfaces by polymer molecules. Even though the
properties of polymers are improved by the addition of surface-active agents,
their effect does not last for a long time in humid atmospheres or for a long
storage period and the physical properties deteriorate after a while.
Efficient coupling agents are silanes [1,55,62,69-71] and organotitanates
[72-74], which are easily dispersed and present a high chemical resistance.
Chromium coordination complexes and substances containing phosphorus are
also used .
Mascia [3] suggests dividing coupling agents into five basic types, all consist-
ing of organic compounds containing functional groups capable of reacting with
the polymer matrix. Coupling agents used in conjunction with glass fibers con-
tain vinyl and allylic groups for polyesters and amino groups for epoxides
together with other groups that can interact strongly with the hydroxyl groups
of the glass surface. Examples of coupling agents are given in Table 4.2.
4.4.1
Silane Coupling Agents

made of organic polymers and inorganic fillers such as glass , minerals, metals,

and their oxides. Silane coupling agents contain two different reactive groups in
their molecules and one of them can be hydrolyzed. These groups allow them
to form strong bonds with the polymer matrix and with the filler particles.
There are many organic groups that can react favorably with polymers,
namely, vinyl, allyl, amino, methacryloxy, alkylmercapto, and epoxy groups as
shown in Table 4.3 [1,62,70,71]. These coupling agents are utilized to form
bonds between glass fibers and thermosetting resins or plastomers as well.
4.4.1.1
Action Mechanism
Silane coupling agents have two distinctly different chemical reactivities, cre-
ated by the combination of hydrolyzable groups and organo-functional groups
in the same molecule. This permits chemical bonding to both the reinforcing
agent (or filler or substrate) and resin, forming a chemical bridge across the
interface.
Resulting systems exhibit improved bonding and upgraded mechanical and
electrical properties, which are retained after severe environmental aging.
The adhesion mechanism between polymers and glass fillers induced by
silane coupling agents is explained by the reaction of alkoxy substituted silanes
with water to form silanols that subsequently form Si-O-Si bonds with the
glass surface containing the hydroxyl groups. For example, silica-based glass
has a tetrahedral structure where ion Si+4 is surrounded by four oxygen ions
0-2 to result in an electrically charged complex [Si(0/2))0]-[Si(0/2)3] +' The

It is known that Na", K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ cations migrate and they concentrate

sorption of alkaline type A glass is lower than that of type E glass (see Table
4.1). This glass also has groups such as Al-OH, B-OH, Mg-OH, and Ca-OH
that become adsorption sites [76].
Fillers that do not possess OH groups originally on their surface can be
treated by alkaline reactants or by calcination [52-54] to create such groups or
to activate groups that can be transformed into OH groups.
Many silanol molecules condense simultaneously on the glass surface to
form a multilayered irregular coating [76]. However, a large fraction of the
silanol is bound to the glass surface by hydrogen bonds between silanol and OH
groups or adsorbed water molecules at the glass surface [77]. These bonds play
a minor role in the coupling between the filler and the polymer [78]. The
coupling is mainly the result of the formation of ether bonds between the silane
and the glass surface by treatment at high temperature, as illustrated in the
following steps [68,77,79]:

Organotitanate Coupling Agents
4.4.2.1
Action Mechanism
Organotitanate coupling agents create molecular bridges at the interface be-
tween inorganic fillers and the polymer matrix [1,72]. They have the advantage
offorming only a monomolecular layer. The absence of a multimolecular layer
at the interface and the chemical structure of titanates modify the surface
energy of filler particles in such a way that the melt viscosities of polymers are
lower than those obtained when other types of coupling agents are used. The
reaction between the filler and the organotitanate coupling agent is as fol-
lows [73]:

Function 1 is capable of forming a chemical bond between the titanate mole-
cule and the filler surface. Improved adhesion is the result.

Function 2 relates to the ability of the titanate molecule to transesterify. It
implies the formation of chemical bonds between the titanate and the polymer
matrix containing, for example, groups such as COOH and OH. Titanates can
gel polyesters and epoxies and cure alkyds, even though there is no unsatura-
tion in the titanate molecule backbone.
Function 3 concerns the part of the titanate molecule immediately adjacent
to the titanium center and that affects the specific effect, the resistance to
hydrolysis, the transesterification activity, and the thermal stability of tita-
nates. This part of the molecule can be represented by the following groups:

Function 4 characterizes the main part of the organic chain. Its length, its
structure, and its nature affect the surface energy and the viscosity . For exam-
ple, a long chain acts as an internal lubricant lowering the viscosity, makes
fillers more organophilic and hydrophobic, and improves tensile and impact
strengths [58]. The presence of long chains in the titanate provides entangle-
ment with polymer molecules favored by van der Waals forces between the two
species as shown in Fig. 4.2. The organic chain groups are responsible for the
liquid state of organotitanates. The presence of phenyl groups ensures compati-
bility with aromatic compounds and makes possible cross-linking reactions.

Function 5 creates bonds between substrates capable of forming crosslinks
in thermosetting resins.
Function 6 makes possible the binding of three organic groups with titanium
leading to the following advantages:
1. A triple functionality as compared to monofunctional trialkoxysilanes
2. An increase in the potential efficiency of the organic phase
These six factors combine to make organotitanates highly effective coupling
agents. A remarkable example is the case of PP filled with 70% of CaC03
treated by isopropyltriisostearyltitanate (TTS); the impact strength of the poly-
mer is increased by a factor of 7.5 and the melt index of the composite is 4.7
g/IOmin as compared to 0.1 g/IO min for PP. Plates made by injection molding
were polished, glossy , without defect, and translucent [73].

A series of organotitanate coupling agents is commercially available from
Kenrich Petrochemicals, Inc., U.S., under the general trade name Ken-React.
Table 4.5 gives a list of these coupling agents with their abbreviations [58].
4.4.3
Other Types of Coupling Agents
Mascia [3] mentions the following types of coupling agents or adhesion
promoters, besides organotitanates:
Phosphorus-containing compounds. They are used to aid adhesion of poly-
mers on metal substrates because of their chelating action toward metal
Ions.
Acids such as stearic acid, salicylic acid, and p-chlorophenyl-substituted
fatty acids.
Amines, i.e., piperidine derivatives, because the polar amino groups are not
sterically hindered and can therefore provide good alignment on the
surface of substrates.
Chromium coordination complexes with compounds containing -NH2 ,
-NH-, epoxide, amide, and isocyanate groups [52-54] are also used. Cation
active substances such as cationic styrene aminosilanes are recommended by
Dow Corning (U.S.) as coupling agents. For example,
is known under the trade name QZ-8-5069 or Z-6032 [80].
4.4.4
Application Modes for Coupling Agents
To obtain composites with good high-temperature properties and better creep
performance, a cross-linked coating has to be formed between fibers and the
polymer matrix [3].

Coupling agents are used at a rate of 0.3-3% by weight of filler. They are
applied in a solution in water or in nonpolar solvents (hexane, benzene). In
practice the solution concentration varie s between 0.1 and 0.3 g L - I . Hydroly-
sis of coupling agents is done at pH between 3.5 and 5 [69,78]. It is also
necessary to clean fibers from impurities and lubricants by washing with sol-
vents or by firing at 250-600Â°C [81].
Silanes form a 1O-20-nmthick layer but they may also form a 0.5-1-nm thick
layer that corresponds to a trimolecular layer [211. It all depends under which
form the filler is used , in the form of roving , mat, or fiber.
Adsorption equilibrium of coupling agent s from aqueous solutions is very
rapid. For example, it is attained in 30 sec in the case of a glass E filler. For this
reason the treatment takes about 1 min in practice [68,78] and the solution is
quickly removed after that time to avoid any excess of coupling agent ; then the
treated filler is dried [69,78].
4.4.5
Recommendations on the Use of Fillers and Filling Methods
The use of fillers in polymers may damage the processing equipment and care
must be taken accordingly. Aspect and qualit y of the surface of products may
be affected and their porosity may be increased by an undesired high humidity
content and by the decomposition of fillers.

96
4: Reinforcing Fillers, Reinforcing Agents, and Coupling Agent s
The addition of large quantities of fillers in polymers is done with special
machines such as rotor mixers of the Banbury type and the extrusion is made
with extruders equipped with special screws [81).

Colorants and Brightening Agents
Coloring is one of the processing steps in the production of many plastic mate-
rials. At the beginning of the plastics age, colorants were added to plastics to
hide the yellowish or brownish look caused by aging, but at the present time,
they are used mainly for aesthetic purposes. Coloring plastic materials de-
mands a full knowledge of coloring processes, which are subject to the produc-
er's appreciation of color shades, to the possible changes in the polymer and in
the pigment during processing, to aging, and to the effects of other additives
present in the plastic material [1-4].
When natural light goes through a piece of plastic material, a part may be
absorbed selectively, leading to coloring, a part may be reflected, and finallY,a
part may be scattered. Total absorption of light makes the material appear
black. When the light is only slightly scattered, the material looks transparent
and its color is the result of the combination of the wavelengths going through it
(or not being absorbed by the material); it is then colored transparent [5]. When
scattering is important, the colored material looks opalescent or opaque; it is
said to be colored opaque. The generally accepted range of wavelengths corre-
sponding to the colors of the natural light spectrum is given in Table 5.1 [5,6].
All plastic materials have a high refractive index between 1.45 and 1.70 and
the transmission is in the region of 80-90% of the incident light in the absence
of light scattering [5]. Amorphous polymers have good light transmission,
whereas crystalline polymers are usually white opaque or translucent because
of the difference in refractive index between the spherulites and the amorphous
regions. So the natural color of polymers varies from water clear for amor-
phous material s (PS, PMMA, etc .) to white opaque in the case of highly crystal-
line polymers (HDPE, polyamides, polyformaldehyde, etc.) and yellow amber
for those polymers derived from phenolic compounds. A yellow tint can also
develop as a result of decomposition of polymers by heat, photooxidation, or
light (see Chapters 9-11).

5.1
Colorants
Pigments, dyes , and substrates are used to color plastics. Pigments are colored
substances in a powdered form and are not soluble. They give, for example, a
tint and a covering power to plastic coatings. Scattering and reflection play an
important role when only partial absorption of the light takes place, that is, for
any color other than black. Consequently, a main requirement for pigments
used to impart color and opacity is that their particle size should be above the
wavelength of the light and their refractive index should be much higher than
that of plastics [5].
Dyes are complex organic substances containing one or more chromophores
and are soluble in polymers without affecting their transparency [7]. This solu-
bility results in a molecular dispersion of the dye in the polymer. An additive
functions as a dye only when it absorbs unwanted wavelengths from the visible
spectrum leaving the rest of the light to pass through the plastic material. When
the additive is only partly miscible with the polymer, it is necessary for it to
have a refractive index close to that of the polymer and to be finely dispersed in
the polymer matrix to avoid the formation of light-scattering centers. The size
of the undissolved particles in the transparent plastic material is not so critical
for light transmission [4].
Substrates are organic dyes or pigments that are fixed on a supporting mate-
rial, such as a filler [8].
Pigments are divided according to their origin, as inorganic, organic, and
metallic (powdered metals). As examples of natural inorganic pigments we
have chalk, gypsum, red ochre , burnt sienna, graphite, and so on. As synthetic
inorganic pigments one may cite lithopone (white), titanium oxide (white),

5.1: Colorants
101
chrome and cadmium yellows, chrome and cadmium oranges, cadmium red,
iron oxides (brown, black), cobalt blue, chromium oxide (green), etc. Organic
pigments must be nonmigrating substances with a resistance to temperatures
over 140Â°C, such as indanthrene, copper phthalocyanine, and diazo com-
pounds.
The majority of organic pigments are obtained from dyes that are insolubi-
lized by means of binders (thermosetting resins or gums) and converted to
particles of the desired size [4,8].
5.1.1
Inorganic Pigments
Inorganic pigments count for 75% of the pigments used in the polymer industry
[2]. Titanium dioxide, the only really white pigment, comes first on the list [9].
It has well-balanced properties, such as high tinctorial strength, high covering
power, good chemical resistance, good heat stability, and relatively low cost. It
comes in two varieties, rutile and anatase. Rutile is the most used for its higher
covering power and for its better stability for outdoor applications. Anatase is
cheaper in cost, has a bluish white tint, is easier to disperse, but tends to
precipitate out of the polymer matrix and leaves behind a fine layer of deposit
(chalking) and has limited outdoor applications because of its tendency to turn
yellow.
Iron oxides may be natural or synthetic. Synthetic oxides are preferred for
their high pigmentation capacity, and their chemical and color purities. Natural
oxides are cheaper in cost but they contain impurities that may interfere with
some of the polymer properties. Iron oxides are used as yellow, red, black,
brown shaded, and light-tan pigments.
Colored synthetic lead compounds are also largely used as pigments, the
same as for chrome yellows and molybdate oranges , which provide pure yellow
and orange shades of high light and heat stabilities. All lead, chromium, and
molybdenum pigments are cheap, but their potential as carcinogenic agents is a
serious drawback.
Cadmium pigments , mainly cadmium reds, are often used, but their high cost
and their poisoning effect limit their practical applications, in spite of their very
good light and heat stability.
Other interesting inorganic pigments are white zinc, aluminum hydrate
(green), white lead, cinnabar, and chromium oxide, hydrated or dehydrated,
used in the production of some transparent colored plastic materials.
Ultramarine blues are used as pigments to produce reddish blue violet
shades ; they have good heat and light stabilities and a good resistance to
humidity, but they are sensitive to acids and may be responsible for polymer
oxidation.
Titanates are used as yellow, green, and blue pigments [2]; they are stable
but their low tinctorial strength and their high cost reduce their application
range.

102
5: Colorants and Brightening Agents
Powdered metals such as aluminum, copper, and bronze are also used as
pigments. However, copper and bronze react chemically with some polymers
and the colored materials become dull.
5.1.2
Organic Pigments
There is a large number of organic pigments. They are carbon blacks , phthalo-
cyanines, quinacridones, perylenes, basic and acid colorants, anthraquinones,
diazines, isoindclidones, azo and azo condensation pigments [2,10].
Carbon blacks are the most used among all pigments. They have a high
pigmentation power and they improve many of the physical properties of poly-
mers, such as light stability, processibility, and mechanical properties. Channel
black has been banned in the United States since 1976; only all gas-fired chan-
nel black is still permissible in food contact applications. Other carbon blacks ,
mainly thermal and lamp carbon blacks, are used in rubber reinforcement;
acetylene carbon black is interesting for its electrical conductivity and is used
as an antistatic agent. Activated carbon is also used in some cases.
Azo pigments are the second most used pigments for plastics. They offer a
very wide choice. They may be divided in azo-colorant compounds and metal-
lic-azo compounds. Azo-colorant compounds are usually utilized combined
with pyrazolone reds, diarylide yellows and oranges, and dianisidine and tolyl
oranges. Metallic-azo compounds consist of a series of organic red pigments in
the form of calcium or barium precipitates; calcium derivatives offer a good
chemical resistance to alkalies and they allow high transparency to plastic
materials. Nickel-azo is a yellow pigment.
Phthalocyanines form the most important group of organic pigments . They
may be divided into blue and green pigments. They all offer good light stability,
good resistance to chemicals, and high tinctorial strength , and they do not
affect the transparency of plastic materials. Their cost is relatively low.
However, they may produce shrinkage of materials when used to color
polyolefins.
Pyrazolone reds are used to color PVC and rubbers because of their light
stability, but they tend to exude and have low thermal stability.
Diarylide yellows are often designated by code letters AAA, AAOT, AAOA,
and AAMX. The AAA type is not used to color plastics because of its tendency
to migrate in plastic materials. The other types are remarkable for their bright
shades and are widely used in plastics technology in spite of their low light
stability and their slight tendency toward migration.
Quinacridones are being used more and more as organic pigments for plas-
tics because they offer a series of violet, red, and golden shades. They possess
good light and heat stabilities, good resistance to migration and to chemicals
(except to oxidation agents in basic media). They are widely used in PVC-based
varnishes in the automobile industry .
Perylenes form a group of pigments with shades going from yellow to brown;

5.1: Colorants
103
they have good light stability but only a fair heat stability and an acceptable
resistance to migration; they produce dull colors.
Basic and acidic dyes offer only a narrow selection of colors . Their overall
quality is low and their use is very limited in the plastics industry.
Antraquinones are specially used for yellow and blue coloring, but only
when transparency, color, and heat and light stabilities are important.
Isoindolinones are relatively new pigments that produce yellow, orange, and
red colors. They offer good heat and light stabilities , and good resistance to
exudation, but they are expensive. They are produced mainly by Ciba-Geigy
under the trade name Cromophtal. They are used to color PP fibers and PVC-
based materials used in the automobile industry .
The chemical structures of some organic pigments used in plastic materials
are given in Table 5.2.

Criteria for Selection of Pigments
5: Colorants and Brightening Agents
The choice of pigments is governed by the following criteria:
Density.
A good stability of the pigment dispersion in the polymer matrix is
guaranteed by a small difference in densities between the two species. As long
as the size of the pigment particles does not go below 500nm, that is, the size of
a colloidal particle , the density of the pigment particle does not vary with its
size. Some examples of real and apparent densities of pigment particles are
given in Table 5.3 [11].
Covering Power.
Covering power is the facility for a coating material to cover
a plate of different colors for a given thickness and a given surface (or a given
quantity) of the coating. It depends on the difference between the refractive
indices of the pigment and the polymer. The higher the refractive index of the
pigment as compared to that of the polymer, the higher the covering power of
the pigment. For this reason a pigment may have a covering power that varies
from one polymer to another. The shade of a colored liquid material may
change after the evaporation of the solvent because of the variation in refrac-
tive index of the whole system. This happens, for example, while a varnish is
drying. The covering power of a pigment is also affected by the shape, the
structure, and the size of its particles. Lamellar pigments offer the best cover-
ing power. It is also increased by the crystalline structure and the fineness of
particles due to an increase in the reflection of the light by a larger surface area.
The covering power increases as the size of particles decreases, but below the

wavelength of the visible light (400-700 nm) the covering power begins to
decrease.
Size, Shape, and Size Distribution of Pigment Particles.
As was mentioned
previously, the stability of the suspension in the polymer matrix, the covering
power, and the color shade are determined by the size of pigment particles.
Large particles increase the heterogeneity of the system and they may lessen
mechanical properties of plastic products. Practical size limits for pigment
particles are 500 and 3000 nm.
The shape of particles, as was also mentioned , affects the covering power
and the permeation to gases and liquids. For example , lamellar pigments are
used to color anticorrosive varnishes; they form a protective thin layer against
gases, liquids, and light.
The quality of a pigment is also determined by the size distribution of the
particles since pigment must fill all the interstices. In the case of a broad
distribution, the presence of a little quantity of particles smaller than 500 nm
does not affect the uniformity of coloring, but a distribution too close to the
colloidal domain results in the formation of spots [12]. The surface of pigment
particles affects also rheological properties of suspensions or plastisols [13].
Texture.
The texture reflects the hardness of the pigment. Examples of soft
pigments are anatase, white zinc, and talc. Ultramarine and rutile, are exam-
ples of hard-textured pigments.
Tinctorial Strength.
Tinctorial strength is the ability of a given quantity of
pigment to modify the color shade. It is recommended in some applications to
add a small quantity of white titanium to get better pigmentation.
Wettability.
Wettability is related to the ability for a binder to remove superfi-
cial humidity and air trapped at the surface of pigment particles. If the surface
of the pigment is easily wetted by polar liquids such as water, the pigment is
then called hydrophilic (oxides, metal hydroxides, oxygen-containing acid
salts). Carbon blacks and most ofthe organic pigments belong to the hydropho-
bic pigments category; these are easily wetted by nonpolar liquids.
Light Stability.
Light stability depends greatly on the chemical structure of
the pigment. Changes in shades are due to photochemical oxidation of reactive
groups of the pigment. Inorganic pigments are relatively more stable, and the
stability is higher for pigments having less the reactive groups. For this reason
free reactive groups of some organic dyes are blocked by complexing agents.
The most stable salts of acidic dyes are those for which metal salts are the most
resistant. Some inorganic dyes are subjected to chemical changes; for instance,
minium is transformed into brown PbOz, Iithopone becomes gray by reduction
of ZnS into zinc. It is of prime importance to know the stability of each pigment
and to mix pigments having approximately the same light stability . The stability

106

of colors depends also on the stability of the polymer and of other additives
present in the plastic material. Most of these effects are eliminated by the
addition of UV absorbers (see Section 11.2). Brighter color shades can be
obtained by the use of brightening agents (see Section 5.2).
Chemical Reactions.
The use of pigments implies a possibility of side chemi-
cal reactions with polymers and other additives and with the atmosphere or the
medium. For example , lithopone should not be used when a polymer already
contains a lead-based stabilizer, and lead-based pigments should not be added
to a polymer stabilized by a compound containing sulfur [12].
Heat Stability.
Heat stability is one of the major characteristics for the
choice of pigment to color plastic materials. The temperatures of polymer
transformations are sometimes very high (up to 300Â°C for polyolefin pro-
cessing) and it is thus very critical for pigment stability. In general, organic
pigments are relatively more sensitive to heat than inorganic pigments. Among
the organic pigments offering the best heat stability are alizarine-based and
phenol-based colorants and certain types of phthalocyanines [8] (see Section
5.1.2). Heat stability of pigments includes exposures to low as well as to high
temperatures. Metal salts and chelates in a pigment mixture can also accelerate
degradation of polymers such as polyacetals and polyolefins. The products of
the decomposition of the polymer (e.g., PVC, cellulose 'acetate) may cause a
breakdown in the chemical structure of the coloring matter [5].
Affinity.
The affinity of the colorant to each constituent of a plastic material is
sometimes difficult to meet; a knowledge of interactions between colorants and
polymers, plasticizers, stabilizers, and other additives is of prime importance
for a good selection of a pigment to color a plastic material [11].
Besides any specific decomposition reaction, pigments may be subjected to
undesired side effects , the worst of them being exudation and blooming. Exu-
dation of a pigment may appear when a volatile plasticizer, being also a solvent
for the pigment, is used in the plastic formulation; this is also called pigment
bleeding [8,11]. Pigment exudation depends on the plasticizer content and on
the temperature. The pigment goes from the plastic material to another material
coming in contact with it.
Blooming (migration by sublimation [11]) is not well explained yet [8]. It
depends not only on the nature of the pigment, its content and the temperature,
but also on the concentration and the nature of the plasticizer in a plastic
material. It might be caused by an oversaturation of the polymer-plasticizer-
pigment mixture [8]. It might also be caused by a lack of affinity between
species present in the material; pigment appears at the surface of the material
as a nonadherent powder, since it is rejected by the mixture [11].
Machinability is an important pigment property. Poor machinability can
cause such problems as plateout (the disposition of pigment on equipment
surfaces), plugging of screen packs because of poor dispersion, inordinate in-
creases in melt flow or viscosity of the plastic, and pigment fracture during
dispersion , with resulting loss of properties.

It is possible to divide these special colorants into such categories as daylight
fluorescent colorants, phosphorescent colorants, and pearlescent colorants
[14].
Daylight fluorescent colorants are substances that transmit visible light but
absorb a part of UV light (340-400 nm) [2,15]. The absorbed energy is emitted
under illumination in the form of a light with a higher wavelength (430-460 nm);
this is fluorescence. These colorants are mainly organic compounds containing
at least four conjugated double bonds, as in stilbene derivatives. The fluores-
cence of these compounds is affected by the spatial arrangement of their mole-
cules. For example, benzidinesulfone is more fluorescent than benzidine.

Brightening agents are used to enhance the whiteness of paper and fabrics but
they are also used nOW in the technology of coloring plastic materials . They are
used to overcome the yellowish color that gives a dull look to bright colors of
certain polymers. Brightening agents are used mainly in blue, red, and violet-
colored plastics. Their effect is more important under daylight than under
artificial and indirect light. They are used at a concentration of 0.001-0.05% by
weight. They either are added directly to the monomer before polymerization
or are ground with the polymer or are solubilized with the polymer in a com-
mon solvent.
Brightening agents should not be toxic or reactive with the resin and they
should not give colored products. Their use is complicated by the presence of
Ti02, mainly in the rutile form, which has a high refractive index and which
absorbs UV light, thus lessening the efficiency of the agent. The presence of
UV absorbers (see Section 11.2)will completely eliminate the effect of bright-
ening agents.
Phosphorescent colorants are capable of storing ambient light energy and
releasing that energy at longer wavelengths than can be seen in darkness. When
fluorescent colorants are derived from organic dyes, phosphorescent colorants
are of inorganic origin, the general composition usually comprising zinc cad-
mium sulfide or calcium strontium sulfide [14].
Pearlescent colorants are not particularly wavelength sensitive. The pearl-
like sheen produced is the result of external reflection and internal or light-
scattering reflection. This condition is achieved by controlling the size and
shape of the pearlescent crystals.
5.3
Methods Used for the Coloration of Plastics
The method for coloring a plastic material is always determined by the process-
ing technique. In most cases, today, mixing of colorant with the powdered

resin at the softening temperature has been abandoned in favor of rapidly
mixingthe resin, the plasticizer, and fillers with dry colorants specially treated
to be fixed at the surface of particles of the solid powdered mixture. Examples
of such dry colorants are Lustrex (Monsanto) and Drycol (Gering) [11].The dry
method is very simple. Mix the granular polymer (treated with butyl stearate)
with the pigment in a drum turning at a given speed or in a fast operating mixer.
This technique gives best results with organic pigments. The degree of
homogeneity attained in this way is less than that with a twin-screw mixer, but
the mixingis made more rapidly. Polymers intended for extrusion can be mixed
in a granular or a powdered form with pigments directly in the extruder; in the
case of soft-textured organic pigments, a uniform coloring can be obtained in
the feed zone of the extruder.
The batch method is used for coloring when the final product is a paste or a
liquid (plastisol or paint); the pigment is added in solution in a plasticizer or a
solvent to the polymer mixture and the mixing is realized in an ordinary mixer,
a ball mill, or a single or twin-cylinder mixer. Special products (Euvinyle,
Mikrolithe, etc.) can then be used to accelerate the mixing process, in the case
of a PVC plastisol, for example. These special pigmentation agents can also be
mixed with granular polymers intended for extrusion.
Dry color concentrates that are concentrated mixtures of resins and color-
ants are also used. They can contain up to 10 times as much colorant as is
needed and are mixed with the uncolored resin during processing [2,7].
Liquid colorants are more and more used [2,16]. They are liquid or semiliq-
uid fine dispersions of pigments that can automatically be dispensed to a pro-
cessing machine consistently and efficiently. It is desirable to use liquid color-
ants containing the highest pigment loading attainable. A typical liquid coloring
system consists of a regulated pumping device that can accurately meter and
deliver a fluid colorant directly onto the screw of the plastics processing ma-
chine [17].
5.3.1
Some Examples of Methods Used for the Coloration of Most
Important Plastics
PE and PP.
PE and PP are compounded at high temperatures; it is then
necessary to use pigments of high heat stability. Coloring is done by mixing in
extruders and by the dry method.
PS.
PS in its transparent state is colored with organic dyes in solution in
aromatic hydrocarbons. The dye selected to color objects produced by injec-
tion molding must resist temperatures of up to 250Â°C. Small objects may be
superficially colored by colorants soluble in appropriate solvents.
PVC.
Plasticized PVC is more difficult to color than rigid PVC. In this last
case, any inorganic or organic dye or pigment with good heat stability up to

110
5: Colorants and Brightening Agents
190Â°C and good light stability can be used. Many of the common pigments used
to color other plastics will exude or bloom when used with plasticized PVC.
For this reason the selected pigment, besides its good light stability, must be
insoluble in the plasticizer. These conditions are met only by a small number of
pigments, such as phthalocyanines and PVC-based stable colorants [18].
Poly(vinylidene chloride) (PVDC).
With PVDC , the purity of colorant is of
prime importance. Traces of iron or zinc accelerate the polymer decomposi-
tion. Benzidine yellows and oranges and phthalocyanines are recommended for
PVDC.
PMMA.
The best way to color PMMA is to dissolve the colorant in the
monomer prior to the polymerization. Colorants that are not soluble in the
monomer are dissolved beforehand in alcohols or are added as a paste prepared
with dimethylformamide, for example. In most cases the transparency of
PMMA must be protected, and for this reason, small quantities of colorants are
used. For example, in the case of pigments, their content should be less than
0.1% by weight.
Polyamides.
Polyamides have high processing temperatures (around 250Â°C)
and the selection of colorants is thus very limited. Only those having the best
heat stability can be used [18]. Polyamide fibers and ropes or cables are colored
by soaking them in aqueous solutions of organic colorants. The major problem
with this technique is to maintain a constant concentration of the colorant in the
solution. Polyamide processing by extrusion or by injection molding offers a
wider choice of colorants, since polymers are exposed to heat only for a short
period of time in those cases.
Polyurethanes.
The same problems are met with polyurethane fibers as with
polyamide fibers. Polyurethane foams are colored with fluorescent colorants
mainly. These colorants must have good light stability and good resistance to
humidity, to exudation, and to blooming . They should not interfere with the
foam formation. Diisocyanate is usually added with the colorant.
Unsaturated Polyesters.
Since the coloration of these polymers is done by
adding the colorant to the monomer prior to polymerization, it must be stable to
the reaction conditions (temperature, catalyst) without interfering with the
polymerization process. Since unsaturated polyester laminates are largely used
in outdoor applications, the selected colorants must have a good light stability.
When possible, organic pigments should be selected for these polymers instead
of inorganic pigments because they have a smaller covering power, are more
difficult to disperse in the polymer matrix, have a more pronounced effect on
mechanical and electrical properties, and do not produce clear and bright
shades.

Chemical and Physical Blowing Agents
Blowing or foaming agents are substances that decompose or vaporize easily
at given temperatures to produce large quantities of gases or vapors . Accord-
ingly, they may be divided into chemical and physical blowing agents.
6.1
Chemical Blowing Agents
Chemical blowing agents are organic and inorganic compounds that decompose
thermally into gases not reacting with the polymer matrix. This process is
usually exothermic and irreversible; however, certain compounds that decom-
pose through thermal dissociation, such as bicarbonates, evolve gas in a revers-
ible and endothermic reaction. The characteristic property of these compounds
is their decomposition temperature, which determines their practical use as
blowing agents for a given plastic material and for its processing conditions .
All chemical blowing agents may be divided into the following groups: car-
bonates and bicarbonates, nitrites, hydrides, peroxides, oxygen-containing
acid derivatives, azo compounds, urea derivatives, hydrazines, semicarba-
zides, azides, N-nitroso compounds, and triazols.
Most of them (except for azo compounds, hydrazines , semicarbazides, N-
nitroso compounds, and triazols) are of negligible importance. They are inex-
pensive but they are insoluble in plasticizers and organic solvents. They are not
easily dispersed in polymer mixtures and cannot be stocked for a long time
because of their unstability [1]. However, barium carbonate is sometimes used
for plastics with a high foaming temperature such as ABS terpolymers, PP, and
rigid PVC. At 245Â°C under atmospheric pressure, 1 g of barium carbonate will
develop 177 mL of CO2 [2].

6.1: Chemical Blowing Agents
The required properties for blowing agents are the following [3-7]:
113
1. High stability against decomposition during storage.
2. Good affinity with the polymer to obtain a good dispersion in the polymer
bulk.
3. Maximum production of gases in a minimum time at the polymer foaming
temperature.
4. Rate of gas evolution that can be controlled independently of pressures used
for polymer processing (e.g., molding).
5. Nontoxic, noncorrosive, and odorless decomposition products. They must
have no effect on the color and other physicochemical properties of the
foam. Furthermore, they should have enough affinity to the polymer that
they do not exude or bloom at the surface of finished products.
6. Decomposition reaction that is not too exothermic.
7. Cost as low as possible.
According to their origin, blowing agents are divided into inorganic and
organic agents.
6.1.1
Inorganic Agents
Inorganic blowing agents are used mainly in rubber technology [8]. They have
limited application in the plastics technology. Here are some examples of the
most currently used ones and their decomposition mechanism:
Sodium Hydrogen
Carbonate.
Sodium hydrogen carbonate decomposes
when heated according to
or below 90Â°C in the presence of an organic acid according to
NaHC03 O
rg=;Cid)COz + HzO + sodium salt of the organic acid
Ammonium Hydrogen Carbonate .
Ammonium hydrogen carbonate begins to
decompose at 65Â°C in the following way:
Sodium Nitrate and Ammonium Chloride Mixture .
Since COz diffuses very
easily out of vulcanized rubber products, this mixture can be used advanta-
geously in those cases. The decomposition reaction proceeds in the two follow-
ing steps:
NaNOz + NH4CI ~ NH4NOz + NaCl
NH4NOz ~ 2HzO + Nz

114
6: Chemical and Physical Blowing Agents
Inorganic blowing agents are difficult to disperse in polymers; thus, in spite
of their low cost, they are seldom used. Organic blowing agents offer more
application possibilities.
6.1.2
Organic Agents
Organic blowing agents are widely used in foaming technology. Most of them
release nitrogen on decomposition. They are generally divided into azo com-
pounds, nitroso compounds, and compounds containing sulfonylhydrazide and
sulfonylsemicarbazide groups. The most used ones and their basic properties
are given in Table 6.1 [2,4,8-16]; the decomposition reactions can be controlled
so that their decomposition temperature may vary within a given range.
6.1.2.1
Characteristics
The characteristics of some well-known organic blowing agents follow.
Azodicarbonamide.
Azodicarbonamide is representative of azo compounds.
This is the most important and the most used of all organic blowing agents. It is
stable at high temperature, self-extinguishing, and nontoxic. It is easily dis-
persed in polymers even though it is not soluble in plasticizers and common
solvents. Its volume of gases produced over cost ratio is good. The decomposi-
tion temperature is between 230 and 235Â°C, but it can be reduced to 150Â°C by
using decomposition accelerators (kickers) (see Section 6.103).
The use of this blowing agent in the production of PVC-based light synthetic
leather was developed in the middle 1960s [3,14,17-24]. However, it cannot be
used alone to produce structural foams because size distribution of cells formed
in the finished products is too large. This difficulty is overcome by the applica-
tion of well-defined mixtures of foaming agents. Azodicarbonamide is still an
important constituent in those mixtures, since it prevents the formation of
spots and since its fine particles function as nuclei for cell formation. These
nucleation centers operate in the entire polymer matrix and thus eliminate the
formation of large cells at the surface of the foamed plastic material that are
responsible for surface roughness.
Azobisisobutyronitrile.
Azobisisobutyronitrile is now scarcely used and only
to foam PVC and PS. This limitation in its application comes from the high
toxicity of the dinitrile of tetramethylsuccinic acid, a major product of its
decomposition.
N,N'-dinitrosopentamethylenetetramine.
N, N' -dinitrosopentamethylenetet-
ramine is relatively unstable. It is very sensitive to heat, mainly when it
comes in direct contact with a flame. Interaction with an acid induces its
decomposition. It is only slightly soluble in water but it dissolves rapidly in
alcohols. It is decomposed slowly by light. The acidic decomposition is acceler-

ated by the presence of humidity. Its utilization is limited because of the bad
odor of its decomposition products. This can be partially corrected by adding
urea salts [24] or boric acid [I].
N ,N'-dimethyl-N,N' dinitrosoterephthalamide.
N,N'-dimethyl-N,N'-dinitro-
soterephthalamide has a low decomposition temperature and thus can be used
to foam plastics that can be processed at a temperature below 700C. For this
reason it is utilized for PVC-based plastisols and rubbers. It is relatively inex-
pensive.
In the group of hydrazine compounds, substituted sulfohydrazides are be-
coming important blowing agents. Diphenylsulfone-3 ,3'-disulfonylhydrazide is
nontoxic and is used, for example, to produce open cell foamed PVC plastisols
[25].
The semicarbazide group is mainly represented by p-toluenesulfonylsemi-
carbazide [6,15,26] and 4,4'-oxybis(benzenesulfonylsemicarbazide)
NH'CONHNHO'S~O~SO'NHNHCONH'

is used to foam PVC plastisols and rigid PVC. Its decomposition temperature is
below 115Â°C.
A new foaming and dispersing agent (Lecoza [27]) has been developed for
plastics and rubbers. The producer's bulletin mentions a decomposition tem-
perature of 230Â°Cand evolution of 220 mL of gases (N2, 65%, CO, 32%, and
CO2, 3%) per gram of agent. This foaming agent is stable at room temperature
and is self-extinguishing. The decomposition products are nontoxic.
The literature gives a wide selection of foaming agents that are more or less
important. To mention only a few, there are substituted isocyanates [28], am-
monium-carbonylsulfonate [29], substituted ureas [30-33], 2,4-dioxo-1,2-dihy-
dro-4-benzoxazine and its derivatives [34], substituted triazines [35-37], am-
monium-5-azidotetrazole
[38],
cyanamide
[39],
and
azodicarbonamide
derivatives [40].There are also some patented foaming agent mixtures contain-
ing azodicarbonamide as the major constituent [41-43].

Factors Acting on Blowing
119
The structure of a polymeric foam is affected by all its constituents. For exam-
ple, rheological properties of the polymer melt are a function of the nature of
the polymer, its molecular weight, and the nature of the plasticizer or of the
plasticizer mixture [44,45]. It is important to attain the right viscosity of the
polymer melt when the gas evolution reaches its maximum rate [46].The size of
particles of the blowing agent and their uniform dispersion in the polymer
matrix affect the cell distribution and the ratio of open cells to closed cells.
Each fine grain of a well-dispersed powdered foaming agent produces a small
quantity of gas and this is why cells stay closed . A large foaming agent
particle produces a large quantity of gas and the cell expansion is too fast and
too large; the walls between contiguous cells become thin enough to break, thus
creating open cells [44]. The open-cell to closed-cell ratio, together with the
degree of plasticization, determine the quality of a foamed plastic material in-
tended for a specific application [46]. It is possible to change the open-cell to
closed-cell ratio by a proper selection of polymer, plasticizer, foaming tempera-
ture (a lower temperature producing less open cells), and kicker. Kickers or
blowing accelerators are compounds functioning as catalysts for the decompo-
sition of the blowing agent, inducing it to decompose at a lower temperature.
Kickers may be classified according to the quantity of gases produced in their
presence at a given temperature (e.g., 180Â°Cfor the production of foamed PVC)
as [5]:
Rapid kickers:
Cd and Cd-Zn salts
Medium kickers:
Pb and Pb-Zn salts
Slow kickers:
Ba and Ba-Zn salts
A similar classification has been obtained by others [47]. There are other
substances with a different chemical structure that function as kickers. For
example, the decomposition of azodicarbonamide is activated in the presence
of the salts mentioned above and in the presence of ZnO, TiOz, triethano-
lamine, and diphenylamine [48] or of sulfonated aromatic acids and their salts
[49,50].
It is possible to increase the quantity of gases produced by using larger
quantities of kicker or by varying the size of the blowing agent particles, keep-
ing the kicker concentration constant.

Physical Blowing Agents
Physical blowing agents are compounds that expand quickly because of a phase
change such as vaporization of liquids or of compressed liquefied gases at the
foaming temperature.

They are aliphatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons, and fluoro-
chlorinated hydrocarbons. The lightness (or density) of the foamed product is
affected by the rate of vaporization of the physical blowing agent; a higher rate
produces a lighter foam. Examples of important physical blowing agents are
given in Table 6.2 together with their main characteristics [2,13].
Aliphatic hydrocarbons possess a high foaming efficiency and they are non-
toxic. However, they are highly inflammable and safety precautions must be
taken by the producers; this is a severe limitation to their use. Chlorinated
hydrocarbons do not present the flammability problem and they are largely
used as physical blowing agents. For instance, chlorinated ethylenes are rec-
ommended to foam PVC and epoxy resins.
Fluorochlorinated hydrocarbons have many of the properties of the ideal
blowing agent. They are nonflammable, are nontoxic, and have high heat
stability. Monofluorotrichloromethane (Freon 11) and 1,2,2-trifluorotrichloro-
ethane (Freon 113) are liquid at ambient temperature and they are used in the
production of rigid and flexible foams of polyurethanes, PVC, and so on. But
they have a negative effect on the atmospheric ozone layer that protects the
surface of the earth from short-wavelength radiations from the sun, and for this
reason, their use is limited by legislation in many countries.
Many other examples of applications of physical blowing agents are men-
tioned in the technical literature. A patented process to produce PVC plastisol
microporous foams gives the following list of substances as physical blowing
agents: air, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, methane , propane , ethylene, propylene,
helium, argon, pentane, heptane , hexane, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone , diethyl
ether, ethanol [51,52], hexafluoroisopropanol [53], isobutene [54], or a mixture
of pentane and methyl chloride [55].
It is also possible to produce gases for blowing processes by reacting to-
gether substances such as alkali metal borohydrides and hydroxy organic
compounds [56] or dried hydrofluoric acid and vinyl chloride [57].
The stabilization of foam structure is realized with the aid of surfactants.
They lower the interfacial tension and they increase the plasticity and the
elasticity of filmformed between the liquid and the gaseous phases. The lower-
ing of the surface tension decreases the work needed to increase the surface
duringfoaming. The increase in the superficial elasticity permits the cells' walls
to remain thick enough to prevent them from bursting. Surfactants are also
very important as foam stabilizers during foam preparations by air blowing at
high spinning speed [58-61]. Foams produced from PVC plastisols can be
stabilized by nonionic substances such as poly(ethylene glycol) ethers, heavy
alcohol esters, alkylphenols , or substances containing silicone oils [62].

Antistatic Agents
7.1
Introduction
Many organic macromolecular compounds behave as dielectrics. Usually, elec-
trons involved in chemical bonds are localized and the specific conductance of
polymers generally varies from 10- 9 to 10- 2 Scm-I at room temperature. The
electric conductance depends greatly on the temperature. It is possible to no-
tice an important increase in the specific conductance of polymers above their
Tg value. Below Tg , the specific conductance may vary from 10- 12 to 10- 19 S
cm" , and above Tg , it may increase up to 10-6 Scm-I [I]. The values of the
specific conductance of many well-known polymers are given in Table 7.1 [I].
These polymeric materials have a tendency to develop electrical charges
under repeated deformations and friction. The superficial electrical potential
may reach values up to a few tens of kilovolts, and this presents serious difficul-
ties for practical applications and to users. The electrical charges accumulated
on the surfaces of plastic materials may produce sparks that become fire hazards
in an inflammable atmosphere. For these reasons plastic containers are not
recommended for transportation and storage of inflammable liquid materials ,
unless the plastic material has been treated against charge accumulation. These
charges also cause serious problems in many other cases ; for instance , they are
produced on aircraft during takeoffs and landings. They may then interfere
seriously with the undercarriage mechanism and with radio communications
between the aircraft and ground stations.
Electrostatic charges can also be produced on the surfaces of polymeric
materials in the course of processing operations such as extrusion, calendering ,
and rollingup of plastic sheets or films. Furthermore, electrostatic charges pick
up dust and dirt particles and the surfaces of charged plastics can thus become
dull and dirty.
For the application of plastic materials in atmospheres contaminated by
inflammable substances, such as those in mines and in hospitals (where anaes-
thetics and oxygen form explosive gas mixtures) , use of electroconducting ma-

terials for conveyor belts, floor coverings, masks, pipes, bellows, etc. is recom-
mended.
It is possible to notice that the surfaces of material become easily charged
when their specific conductance is smaller than 10-8 Scm-I [2]. When two
pieces of a plastic material are rubbed together or when a piece of a plastic
material is rubbed against another material, it is possible to produce electro-
static charges, the density of which depends on the type of materials and the
period of time they are rubbed. The charges produced by rubbing are concen-
trated in different regions but only one type of charge predominates on the
surface of the material; thus, some materials become positively charged and
others become negatively charged at their surface. The sign of the surface
charges of nonmetallic materials rubbed together depends on their triboelectric
rank, which is given in Table 7.2 for some substances [2].

The electrostatic charges accumulated on the surface of macromolecular
compounds are very difficult to eliminate because of the very low electric
conductance of these materials. This is measured by the half-time electrostatic
charge decay; this value is given for some polymeric materials in Table 7.3 [2].
Since most of these materials have an appreciable value for the half-time charge
decay, charges accumulate on them when these materials are rubbed.
There are many ways to eliminate surface electrostatic charges, for exam-
ple, by increasing the humidity or the conductivity of the surrounding atmo-
sphere, by lowering the surface resistance of materials with the use of electro-
conducting carbon blacks , powdered metals, or antistatic agents [3,4].
7.2
Efficiency and Mechanism of Antistatic Agent Action
As mentioned earlier, the addition of powdered metals to polymeric materials
eliminates electrostatic charges on their surface. But electric properties of
materials such as vulcanized rubbers filled this way are not stable; for this
reason, powdered metals are used only for polymer-based electroconducting
varnishes [5,6] and adhesives [7]. In these cases, the powdered metals (Ag, Au,
Ni, AI, Cu) are impregnated with epoxy resins or added to polyamides, PVC,
silicones, etc. [l,5,8].
Electroconducting carbon blacks are largely utilized to increase the electric
conductivity of organic polymers. The electric conductivity of carbon blacks
depends on the following items:
1. The capacity to form branched or tentacular structures in the polymer ma-
trix that are responsible for the electric conductivity; this is the case for
lamp, acetylene, and furnace carbon blacks [I].

7.2: Efficiency and Mechanism of Antistatic Agent Action
127
2. The composition and the chemical structure of the surfaces of carbon blacks,
since they can fix substances by chemical adsorption, thus creating insulat-
ing layers between particles. This makes impossible the formation of elec-
troconducting structures. To prevent this problem the surface of the carbon
black particles is cleaned by heat treatments in vacuum or in an inert atmo-
sphere at 2000Â°C.
3. The size and the size distribution of carbon black particles. At first, the
specific resistance of the particles decreases with their size, and then in-
creases by further diminution of the size. It is believed that a wide size
distribution of particles favors the formation of branched structures of the
carbon black in the polymer matrix.
4. A good selection of the mixing process and the mixing conditions in order to
maintain the electroconducting structure intact.
In spite of the good properties of some carbon blacks in reducing surface
charges on plastic materials , the use of antistatic agents increases steadily. The
simplest antistatic agent is water. It is adsorbed on the surfaces of objects
exposed to a humid atmosphere and it forms a thin electroconducting layer with
impurities also present in the air. Such a layer is even formed on the surface of
hydrophobic plastic materials , probably because of the existence of a highly
viscous thin layer of dirt.
Antistatic agents generally function either as lubricants or as substances able
to create conduction channels [3,4,9]. A lubricant reduces friction and conse-
quently the buildup of surface electrostatic charges , but it will not facilitate
their dispersion. This dispersion of charges on the surface is much more
efficient through conduction channels formed by an antistatic agent even
though the density of charges at the beginning of the friction reaches a higher
value than with a lubricant.
Most antistatic agents function according to the second mechanism. Con-
duction channels that are created usually contain a thin layer of water coming
from the atmosphere and adsorbed on the antistatic agent. This implies that
antistatic agents must stay at the surface of plastic materials and must be
hygroscopic. Since the conductivity of water is-increased by the presence of
ions, an antistatic agent is much more efficient when it ionizes in the presence
of water. To function as an antistatic agent, an additive must tend to exude and
to accumulate at the surface of the polymer matrix. Its molecules are thus
stratified in many surface molecular layers. It may take many days before a
layer of sufficient thickness is formed, depending on the nature of the polymer
and on the process to which the plastic material has been submitted.
Exudation, in actual fact the efficiency of an antistatic agent, may be af-
fected by the presence of other additives, such as carbon blacks, titanium
oxide, UV absorbers containing nickel, etc. In the absence of interference from
other additives, exudation depends on the nature and on the structure of the
polymer. For example , migration of antistatic agents is more rapid in branched
PE than in linear PE or PP. For this reason the antistatic effect appears after a

128
7: Antistatic Agents
few hours in the case of branched PE and only after four to seven days in the
case of PP.
Antistatic agents may be classified according to their application mode or
according to their composition and their chemical structure. Based on their
application mode, they are classified as external or internal antistatic agents.
External antistatic agents are applied in solution in water or in alcohol by
wetting, spraying, or soaking the plastic object in the solution, followed by
drying at room temperature or under hot blown air. Their concentration varies
between 0.1 and 2% by weight. External antistatic agents are operative right
after the drying step. Unfortunately, they are easily rubbed off by handling or
by cleaning of finished products. The most important external antistatic agents
from the practical point of view are quaternary ammonium salts and phos-
phoric acid derivatives [3). The conductivity mechanism of high-temperature
boiling and of ion-producing substances is easy to understand. For substances
containing hydroxyl or amine groups, Biedermann has suggested a conductiv-
ity mechanism that is similar to protonic conductivity in water [10]:

This mechanism is based on a comparison of the conductivities of substances
of different chemical structure. For instance, primary amines are efficient as
antistatic agents but secondary amines are not. The conductivity of tertiary
amines depends on the nature ofN-hydroxyalkyl substituents. Among amides,
only N,N-disubstituted derivatives and mainly those having two hydroxyalkyl
substituents are effective. The presence of many OH groups in the molecule
makes the efficiency of the antistatic agent more independent of the humidity.
Based on the mechanism proposed by Biedermann, it is clear that compounds
leading to the formation of linear molecular aggregates by means of hydrogen
bonds will be more efficient than those leading to the formation of cyclic molec-
ular aggregates.
Internal antistatic agents are introduced directly in the polymer matrix dur-
ing compounding. To be functional, the internal antistatic agent must be only
partially miscible with the polymer to migrate slowly to the surface of the
plastic material. This condition is sometimes difficult to meet for some interest-
ing antistatic agents. As was mentioned earlier, their action appears after a few
hours and even afew .days after compounding, depending on the mutual mis-
cibility of the agent and the polymer. The content in internal antistatic agents
varies from 0.1 to 10% by weight.
Examples of external antistatic agents for PE (a polymer of very low con-
ductivity; see Table 7.1) are substances containing many hydroxyl, amine or
amide groups being able to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds . Ionizable

substances are also effective agents , since their unfavorable interaction with a
nonpolar polymer allow them to exude easily, especially at high concentration.
7.3
The Use of Antistatic Agents
The selection of an antistatic agent for a given polymer is based on its chemical
composition. Accordingly , antistatic agents may be divided in many groups, as
presented in the following sections [II-IS].
7.3.1
Antistatic Agents Containing Nitrogen
Antistatic agents containing nitrogen are made mainly of amines, amides and
their derivatives, such as amine salts, and addition compounds between ox-
iranes and aminoalcohols. Pyrrolidone, triazol, and polyamine derivatives also
belong to this group. These compounds are used as antistatic agents for
polyolefins and PS. They are not recommended for PVC. As representative
compounds belonging to this group there are
R1I
Amine oxides of the type: R,-N ~ 0

II
Fatty acid polyglycolamides of the type: R-C-NH(CH2CH20)xH
The following commercial products are typical examples (16]:
1. Alacstat C-2 (Alcolac Chemical Corp., U.S.). This is a N,N-bis(2-hydroxy-
ethyl)alkylamine used for polyolefins at 0.1% by weight.
2. Catanac 477 (American Cyanamid Co., U.S.). This is the N-(3-dodecyloxy-
2-hydroxypropyl)ethanolamine
(CI2H250CH2CHOHCH2NHCH2CH20H)
recommended for linear PE (0.15% by weight), for PS (1.5% by weight), and
for PP (1% by weight).
Other compounds containing nitrogen and used as antistatic agents are qua-
ternary ammonium salts, quaternized amines, quaternized heterocycles ob-

130
7: Antistatic Agents
tained from imidazoline and pyridine, condensation products between alkyl
amines and quaternized fatty acids or quaternized urea derivatives. Their appli-
cation as internal antistatic agents is limited by their low heat stability. Some of
these compounds can be utilized for PVC; for example:
Ammonium salts ~'-f~~' x-
Quaternized ethoxylated amine : ~'-i>CH'CH'O)'" X:

Amide of quaternized fatty acid: R1-C-NH-R
Here are some other typical examples of available commercial products [16]:
1. Catanac 609 (American Cyanamid Co., U.S.). This is N,N-bis(2-hy-
droxyethyl)-N-(3'-dodecyloxy-2'-hydroxypropyl)
methylammonium
methyl-
sulfate
supplied mainly as a 50% by weight solution in a water-propanol mixture. It is
applied as an external antistatic agent at 2% by weight (pH = 4-6) and is
recommended for phonograph records and other products made of PVC and its
copolymers. It is slightly toxic and produces skin irritation.
2. Catanic LS. This is (3-lauramidopropyl)trimethylammonium methyl-
sulfate
which exists in a crystalline form with a melting point of 99-103Â°C.
3. Catanac SP. This is stearamidopropyldimethyl-l3-hydroxyethylammo-
nium dihydrogenphosphate.
It is sold as a 35% by weight solution in a water-isopropanol mixture (pH =
6-8). It can be used as an internal and external antistatic agent at 1-3% by
weight. It begins to decompose slightly at 200Â°C and decomposes rapidly at
250Â°C. It is soluble in water, acetone, and alcohols. It is not corrosive for
metals even after prolonged contact.
4. Catanac SN. This is stearamidopropyldimethyl-l3-hydroxyethylammo-
nium nitrate

7.3: The Use of Antistatic Agents
([CI7HsCONHCHzCHzCHzN(CH3hCHzCHzOH]+N03- )
131
It is sold as a 50% by weight solution in a water-isopropanol mixture (pH =
4-6). It begins to decompose at 180Â°C,and at 250Â°C its decomposition is very
rapid . It is soluble in water, acetone, alcohols and in a series of polar solvents.
It is used as an internal and external antistatic agent for rigid PVC, polyacry-
lates , impact-PS, ABS terpolymers, paper, and textiles. When applied exter-
nally, the concentration of the solution is reduced to 1-10% by weight. It can
be applied on the surface of plastic products by rubbing them with flannel cloth
impregnated with the solution. For internal applications, the commercial solu-
tion is directly added to the polymer mixture during the milling or mixing
process.
7.3.2
Antistatic Agents Containing Phosphorus
Antistatic agents that contain phosphorus can be used for almost all polymers.
They are recommended mainly for PVC with which they also function as plasti-
cizers [11,13]. They are phosphoric acid derivatives, phosphine oxides,
triphosphoric acid derivatives, and substituted phosphoric amides. Typical ex-
amples are the following:
Phosphoric acid esters: O=P(OR)3
Ethoxylated alcohols and phosphoric acid esters: O=P[O(CHzCHzO)x-Rh
Ammonium salts of phosphoric acid esters;
7.3.3
Antistatic Agents Containing Sulfur
Antistatic agents that contain sulfur include compounds such as sulfates, sulfo-
nates, derivatives of aminosulfonic acids, condensation products of ethylenox-
ide and sulfonamides, and sulfonates of alkylbenzimidazols or of dithiocar-
bamides and sulfides [14].
They are recommended mainly for PVC and PS because they do not inter-
fere with heat stabilizers. They are not suitable for polyolefins, polyamides, and
PMMA [13]. As examples, there arealkylpolyglycolether sulfates
which are sold under the trade name of Statexan HA (Bayer).

132
7.3.4
Betaine-Type Antistatic Agents
7: Antistatic Agents
Betaine-type antistatic agents are mainly used for polyolefins . They are am-
photheric substances and can form salts with acids and bases. Typical exam-
ples are stearylbetaine and dodecyldimethyl-ethanesulfobetaine [12].
7.3.5
Non-Ion-Producing Antistatic Agents
Non-ion-producing antistatic agents are nonionizable compounds in aqueous
solution. The hydrophilic portion of the molecule is usually represented by
hydroxyl groups and the hydrophobic portion by organic groups. This group of
antistatic agents includes the following:
1. Polyhydroxy derivatives of glycerine, sugars, and fatty acids, sometimes
modified by addition of oxiranes. Most of them are nontoxic and hygieni-
cally acceptable; therefore, they can be used to produce materials that may
come in contact with alimentary and pharmaceutical products [14]. Their
major drawback is their low antistatic effects.
2. Heavy alcohol derivatives such as alkylpolyglycol ethers recommended for
polyolefins and PVC.
3. Fatty acid derivatives such as alkylpolyglycol esters used for many types of
plastics.
4. Alkylphenolpolyglycol ethers that have good heat stability; they are used
mainly for polyolefins.
5. Polyglycol ethers obtained from the reaction of glycols with oxiranes; they
are used for polyolefins. Good representatives of this group are the new
types of copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. Polyglycols
correspond to chemical structures such as H(CHRCH20)xH where R may
be hydrogen or the methyl group. Fatty acid polyglycol esters RCOz
(CHzCHzO)xH also belong to this group.
7.3.6
Combinations of Antistatic Agents
None of the antistatic agents combine all the properties needed, i.e ., antistatic
efficiency, heat stability, miscibility with the basic polymer, nontoxicity, hy-
gienic acceptability. The easiest practical answer to this problem is to use
"mixed antistatic agents" showing a synergetic effect. It concerns either the
mere mixtures of two or more antistatic agents or the so-called internal mix-
tures, which means that the same molecule contains many effective atoms.
Examples of simple antistatic agent mixtures are alkanolamines mixed with
fatty acids, alcohols, or amides and eventually with metallic oxides or hydrox-
ides. An example of a combination antistatic agent is the N-methyl-N-stearyl-

133
amide diethyl-phosphoric acid ester; the same molecule contains nitrogen and
phosphorus atoms [17].
7.3.7
Other Surfactant-Type Antistatic Agents
A number of substances that cannot be included in any of the groups given
above are good antistatic agents. They are silicone copolymers, organotin ,
organotitanium and organogermanium derivatives, oxazoline derivatives, or-
ganoboron derivatives, and perfluorated surfactants. Some of them show excel-
lent heat stability.
7.3.8
Special Antistatic Agents
This last group contains antistatic agents of which some have already been
mentioned; they do not function as surfactants but are often used combined
with other types of antistatic agents. They are electroconducting carbon blacks,
metal powders, silicic acid infusion clay, metal carbonates, aluminosilicates,
metal hydroxides and carboxylates, metal salts, inorganic phosphates, com-
plexes, organometallic compounds, and all substances that reduce friction dur-
ing the processing of plastic materials. Metallized (aluminum) glass fibers can
be used as fillers in plastics designed for the production of electromagnetic
screens [18].
At the end of this chapter it is necessary to recall that antistatic agents affect
some of the properties of polymers, such as heat stability, structural stability,
transparency, stress rupture resistance, surface aspect, ease of welding, stamp-
ing, and metallization .

Antiaging Additives (Antidegradants)

Chapter 8
Difficultly Stabilizable and Nonstabilizable
Factors Provoking Plastic Degradation
Antidegradants are substances that protect polymers against effects that may
change their structure and deteriorate their properties. These adverse effects
appear in the course of polymer processing and during utilization of plastic
materials. Antidegradants are heat stabilizers, antioxidants, metallic ion deacti-
vating agents, UV protecting agents, flame retardants, and biocides.
Polymer degradation and protection have become two of the most important
points of interest in the plastics technology in the last 30 years. The main
reason for such intensive interest is that the real properties of polymers do not
correspond to the values that they would theoretically show. Meanwhile, the
technical polymers are not processible or useful without the aid of protective
substances.
For these reasons research dealing with the stability and the stabilization of
polymers is concentrated on causes, reasons, and mechanisms of degradation.
In parallel, development work has been and is still being carried on different
stabilizers and complex stabilizing systems to overcome the degradation of
plastic materials under severe conditions of processibility or application.
Plastic materials show, when compared to other materials, a relatively high
resistance to corrosion [1 ,2]. For this reason they are the best protective mate-
rials for metals, wood, concrete, bricks, etc. It is very important to know in
which conditions they resist or are affected by different adverse substances,
media, or factors.
Corrosion of plastic materials can be defined as a change in their composi-
tion and in their properties produced by exterior condition(s) or agent(s) re-
sponsible for their deterioration. Many agents or factors such as corrosive
chemicals, heat, aging, UV, bacteria, etc. , may cause corrosion.
Degradation or corrosion is caused not only by application of plastics materi-
als for a long period of time or under severe conditions but also by transforma-
tion or preparation processes (overheating caused by polymerization reaction
or by drying) and by storage.

138
8: Factors Provoking Plastic Degradation
The knowledge of conditions under which polymers degrade is essential to
avoid and retard corrosion. Chemical properties of macromolecules are essen-
tially those of small molecules; only the reactivity is lower and the reaction
conditions may be different. For example,polymer degradation caused by
corrosive chemicals occurs in heterogeneous systems, since chemicals have to
diffuse inside polymer matrices and the rate of diffusion of adverse chemicals
depends on the chemical structure of polymers and on conditions such as
temperature, humidity, etc.
8.1
Effects of Chemically and Physically Active Media
It is possible to determine the effect on polymers of different substances or
media and to differentiate them [3]. When a medium causes a chemical reaction
with a polymer, it is called a chemically active medium [2]. These effects are
irreversible and the deterioration caused to the polymeric material is very
important. Such media are acids, bases, oxidants, and all other substances that
can cause chemical reactions such as substitution, addition, and hydrolysis. In
some cases the chemical reaction is limited to the polymer surface and pro-
duces a protective layer against a deeper deterioration by the corrosive chemi-
cal. Such surface reactions are those produced by nitric acid on vulcanized PI
and SB rubbers or by sulfuric acid on vulcanized polychloroprene and NR
[4-7].
'
A physically active medium produces a physical change in the polymer such
as swelling or solubilization without affecting the chemical structure of the
polymer. Changes caused by physically active media are reversible. Swelling
and solubilization are produced by inactive solvents. The criteria for establish-
ing solubility have already been discussed in Section 1.1.
Some substances, .such as water, produce both chemical and physical
changes when they come in contact with polymers. For instance, water is
absorbed by polycaprolactam up to 3.5% by weight of polymer at room.temper-
ature, producing swelling. This physical change becomes more important at the
boiling temperature of water, where polycaprolactam absorbs up to 12% of
water and some hydrolysis of the polyamide is produced, i.e., water becomes
also a chemically active medium.
Resistance of plastic materials to chemically active media may be affected
by the presence of additives such as asbestos fibers [8], lubricants [2], or fillers.
Effects of fillers depend on their nature and on their content in the plastic
material [9-12]. But, in general, the resistance of a plastic to chemically or
physically active media depends above all on the chemical composition and the
structure of the basic polymer, on the temperature, and on other factors.
Resistance of plastic materials to adverse media depends also on the produc-
tion mode, storage, and processing methods. Here are some points to look for
to increase this resistance.

8.2: Effect of Ionizing Radiations
139
1. To use monomers as pure as possible to produce polymers, and inactive
substances to prepare mixtures; for example, substances having a catalytic
effect on decomposition reactions, such as traces of Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, AI,
etc., should be avoided.
2. To produce polymers with a molecular weight distribution as narrow as
possible, since chains with a high molecular weight tend to break down more
easily, and chains with low molecular weight increase the number of reac-
tive end groups that may induce decomposition of polymers.
3. To eliminate after polymerization all reactive impurities such as monomer,
catalyst, that may initiate polymer decomposition.
4. To eliminate after polymerization double bonds produced in polymers dur-
ing polymerization by termination processes.
5. To control the crystallization of crystalline polymers so as to produce small
spherulites; large spherulites decrease the mechanical resistance of poly-
mers.
6. To use substances that absorb light, impacts, or to use radical, oxygen or
decomposition product quenchers (UV absorbers, macromolecular modi-
fiers, stabilizers, antioxidants, flame retardants, etc.).
7. To protect polymers while under severe conditions, such as high tempera-
ture, by an inert atmosphere (nitrogen, water vapor, carbon dioxide); weld-
ing of plastic materials is usually done by heated inert gases.
8. To avoid the use of volatile and easily extractable plasticizers.
In practice, these conditions are difficult to meet completely. However, the
best conditions for the protection of .the plastic material must be carefully
studied .
In addition to the adverse factors just mentioned, plastics can be damaged
by effects that are difficult to control, such as ionizing radiation and mechanical
stresses.
8.2
Effect of Ionizing Radiations
High-energy ionizing radiations (X rays , f3 rays, 'Y rays) produce changes in
polymer structures. Cross-linking and chain rupture occur simultaneously un-
der the effect of ionizing radiation. The polymer structure determines which
chemical change is predominant. Accordingly, polymers can be divided be-
tween the following [13]:
1. Polymers able to form cross-links, such as poly(acrylic acid esters), PS (high
molecular weight), polyesters, polyamides, PE, natural rubber, SBR, BAN,
polychloroprene, polydimethylsiloxane, PP, CPE, poly(vinyl butyral), PVC
(under certain conditions).

140
8: Factors Provoking Plastic Degradation
2. Polymers able to degrade by chain scission, such as PMMA, PTFE, poly-
triftuorochloroethylene (PCTFE), PIB, PVC, cellulose,
PVA,
poly-o-
methylstyrene and PS (low molecular weight).
The higher the molecular weight, the easier the cross-linking. Its degree
depends on the amount of radiation.
The resistance of a polymer to ionizing radiation is related to its chemical
structure. The methods used to evaluate the stability of polymers submitted to
these radiations may vary from one group of polymers to another, but in princi-
ple the experimental results show that this resistance decreases according to
the following succession of chemical structures:

This sequence shows that the benzene ring stabilizes the polymeric chain
much better as a segmental side group than as a segmental link, PS and aniline-
formaldehyde resins being the most stable polymers under ionizing radiations.
Furthermore, it is known that polar aromatic plasticizers such as phthalates
stabilize PVC against ionizing radiations. This sequence shows also that poly-
meric chains containing phenyl groups as substituents are more stable than
PTFE and PIB, for instance.
Polymer destruction initiated by ionizing radiation is accompanied by the
formation of double bonds and by the evolution of gaseous products (hydrogen,
low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, hydrochloric acid, tetraftuoroethylene,
etc.). In the presence of oxygen, oxidized structures such as hydroperoxides,

8.3: Mechanical Degradation
141
carboxylic acid groups , and carbonyl groups are formed. The destruction is
also accompanied by a change in color, going from yellowish brown to black.
The impact of J3 or 'Y rays induces the release of highly energetic electrons
according to the following reaction:
hv
AB ~ AB+ + e
The electrons so produced react with other molecules to form ions and free
radicals [14, 15]:
AB + e ~ AB+ + 2e
AB + e ~ AÂ· + B+ + 2e
AB + e ~ A+ + BÂ· + 2e
AB + e~ AÂ· + BÂ· + e
Ionizing radiation has been used for many years to modify polymers , mainly
to produce cross-linked polymers, as in the case of PE and silicone rub-
bers [16].
8.3
Mechanical Degradation
For a long time it has been believed that chemical bonds could be broken only
by chemical reactions or by the effect of heat and light but never by mechanical
forces [1]. But it is now known that calendering, kneading, grinding, and any
other transformation process imposing high shear stresses on polymer mole-
cules in the presence of atmospheric oxygen can produce polymer degradation.
The molecular weight of natural rubber is reduced industrially by mastication.
The mechanical degradation mechanism may proceed by the formation of
radicals and sometimes of free ions when macromolecule bonds are weak as
well as when they are weakened by a media of high dielectric constant [17].
Mechanical degradation affects the corrosion processes of plastic materials. Its
progression depends on the frequency of mechanical stresses, on the tempera-
ture (a low temperature makes plastics more brittle), on the oxygen pressure
(oxygen reacts with free radicals and activates their production), on the nature
and the size of additive particles, and of course on the nature and the structure
of the basic polymer.
All effects that increase friction in the polymer mass during its processing
and that simultaneously inhibit the reactivity of the free radicals produced by
those effects induce the mechanical degradation of the polymer.
Mechanical degradation cannot be stabilized . Mechanical fatigue or internal
strains imposed on the polymer mass by processing done under incorre.ct con-
ditions decrease its resistance to corrosion. PE, PS, PMMA, rigid PVC and
polyamides are sensitive to the formation of internal strains . If one of these

142
8: Factors Provoking Plastic Degradation
well-known polymers is exposed under stress to even a slightly corrosive agent
or to an atmosphere contaminated by solvents, small, fine cracks may appear
on its surface, accompanied by a sudden decrease in its mechanical properties
and even by a sudden rupture of the material [18]. This phenomenon is called
solvent-induced stress corrosion and happens also in metals. It is explained by
many facts [2], but the stress rupture resistance of different plastics is affected
by the type of processing experienced by plastics. It is commonly observed in
polymers that react easily with their monomers and that depolymerize under
heat. The choice of the temperature for polymer processing is important. For
example, in the case of PS, which is extruded at high temperature, solvent-
induced stress corrosion may occur during the processing. The corrosion is due
to the formation of styrene vapors produced by depolymerization (see Section
9.1) and that affect the polymer under the stress caused by extrusion [19].
Internal strains in polymers are created during processing by irregular cool-
ing, an overcharged mold, external forces, low-temperature (close to Tg) shap-
ing, the creation of large spherulites in the case of crystalline polymers, and the
action of the corrosive agent or of the solvent.
Additives that eliminate internal strains, such as lubricants, plasticizers,
etc., or that may affect the crystallization of crystalline polymers, such as finely
powdered fillers or miscible elastomers (PIB in PE), will overcome solvent-
induced stress corrosion.

Heat Stabilizers
9.1
Thermal Degradation
Heat may affect a polymer in two ways:
a. The polymer softens and melts eventually. The chains' kinetic energy
exceeds intermolecular forces and the polymer becomes a highly viscous liquid
mass but without any change in their chemical structure.
b. Chains break or changes in the chemical structure of chains occur. Many
macromolecular substances degrade when heated and give low-molecular-
weight products. Degradation of chains may continue down to monomers with-
out any change in their chemical structure; this type of degradation is called
depolymerization . Other macromolecules give off low-molecular-weight corro-
sive products, such as HCI, NH3, H20, etc., that contribute to the complete
destruction of materials .
According to some authors, there are three fundamental types of thermal
degradation reactions [1 ,2]:
Nonchain scission.
Random chain scission.
Depolymerization.
Examples of nonchain scissions are the following:
PVC dehydrochlorination:
- (CH2-CH)- -+ - (CH=CH)- + HCI

The first two reactions yield unsaturated polymeric products that are more
or less colored, depending on the extent of reaction. The color of the degraded
macromolecular compounds is related to the length of the resulting conjugated
double bond sequences.
This type of degradation reaction has some analytic applications in the char-
acterization of macromolecules since the quantity and the nature of low-molec-
ular-weight products correspond to the content of specific monomeric units in
certain polymers or copolymers [3,4].
Random chain scission results from homolytic scission of weak points of the
chain. Consequently, this type of degradation produces substances of different
composition and molecular weights corresponding to intra- and intermolecular
radical transfer reactions. Degradation of polyolefins and of polyacrylonitrile
(PAN) are typical examples of random chain scissions.
The mechanism of degradation depends mainly on the chemical structure of
a polymer. The heat stability of different C-C links in the main chain decreases
according to the following sequence:
C
I
-C-C-C- > -C-C-C- > -C-C-C-
I

which corresponds to the cases of polymethylene (PM), PE, PP, and PIB [5]. A
C-C bond 13 to a double bond is also a weak point in the chain.
Depolymerization occurs in the case of polymers that have a high bond
energy and that do not contain reactive groups . Polymers with no hydrogen on
a-carbon of the main chain, for example PMMA, poly-o-methylstyrene, PP,
PTFE, and poly-a-ftuoro-I3,I3-diftuorostyrene, depolymerize:

Heat Stabilizers
The rate of monomer production by pyrolysis of some polymers (e.g.,
PMMA, poly-o-rnethylstyrene, PTFE) is explained by a chain reaction mecha-
nism. The monomer is evolved at the end of the chain reaction by rupture of
C-C bonds according to an unzipping reaction mechanism without transfer all
along the chain [6]. The depolymerization mechanism is as follows:

-CH2-CHX-CH2-CHX' + CH2=CHX
-CH2-CHX-CH2-q-IXÂ· -
-CH2-CHX' + CH2=CHX
and so on.
Termination of the chain reaction may also be done by disproportionation:
-CH2-CHX' + -CH2-CHX' -
-CH2-CH2X + -CH=CHX
But some polymers produce a smaller quantity of monomers due to a trans-
fer mechanism made possible by the presence of hydrogen atoms in labile
positions, as in the case of PS or poly(alkyl acrylates). This transfer mechanism
is as follows:
-CH2-CHX-CH2-CHX-CH2-CHX- + -CH2-CHX' -
-CH2-CHX-CH2-CX-CH2-CHX- + -CH2-CH2X
The transfer determines also the molecular weight of the resulting chain.
Poly-o-methylstyrene does not contain such labile hydrogen atoms to make a
transfer possible, and this is why the yield in monomers is so high, as shown in
Table 9.1.
Polymers with only one substituent on alternating carbon atoms degrade
according to the depolymerization and the random chain scission mechanisms
[7]. Thus, Fig. 9.1 shows that the maximum quantity of styrene evolved by
pyrolysis of polystyrene is attained at 725Â°C,whereas PMMA with two substit-
uents on alternating carbon atoms degrades. much faster and the maximum
quantity of monomer released by pyrolysis is reached at a much lower tempera-
ture, as shown in Fig. 9.2 [7].

The same is true for PTFE, where no hydrogen atom is present and the C-F
bond is very strong. The C-C bond in fluorinated polymers is stronger than that
in hydrogenated polymers. The energy of dissociation of C-C bonds in benzene
is 334 kJ mol:" and in C2F6 , 518 kJ mol:" [8]. It must be said that PTFE begins
to degrade above 360Â°C but its depolymerization is much faster around
600-700Â°C, at low pressure.
Table 9.2 gives values for the heat of polymerization and the yield in mono-
mer for well-known polymers. Obviously, polymers with a heat of polymeriza-
tion above 80 kJ mol"! decompose according to scission reactions. Polymers

The following polymers do not depolymerize:
PE, PP, PVC, PYA, PVDC, PVAL , and its derivatives (esters, ethers, and
acetals).
The depolymerization reaction cannot be stabilized practically. The same is
true for random chain scission . However, the depolymerization can be slowed
down by antioxidants . For this reason heat stabilizers have become very impor-
tant in the plastics industry, mainly for halogen-containing polymers that de-
compose by nonchain scission .

Thermal Stabilizers for Halogenated Polymers and Their
Copolymers
These thermal stabilizers are used for PVC, PVDC, PCTFE, CPVC, and poly-
(vinyl fluoride) (PVF); they are also used for CPE , chlorosulfonated PE, rubber
hydrochloride, chlorinated SBR, polychlorostyrene, PVA and its copolymers,
and so on.
PVC decomposes at a temperature lower than its processing temperature,
which varies between 140 and 200Â°C [10,11]. Its decomposition produces al-
most exclusively hydrochloric acid and is accompanied by polymer coloration
going from yellow to orange , red, brown , and finally black [9,12-16]. At the
beginning, the color depends also on the presence of impurities, namely, initia-
tor traces , and additives in the polymer, and as the destruction progresses, it
depends on changes in the chemical structure produced in the polymer by
pyrolysis [17].
The mechanical properties of PVC do not change appreciably as pyrolysis
goes on and the coloration is the only noticeable exterior sign of the thermal
decomposition. The efficiency of a PVC heat stabilizer is easily judged by its
facility to stop the coloration of the polymers. The effect of a heat stabilizer
varies with the different types of commercial PVC; for this reason its specificity
must be examined for each new commercial PVC [18]. For instance, some
emulsion polymerized PVCs dried by the fluidized bed method are prestabil-
ized by sodium carbonate, which makes impossible the use of organotin heat
stabilizers. (Prestabilization occurs during polymerization or when the polymer
separates from the aqueous polymerization phase [19].) The heat stability of
this type of PVC is also determined by the drying and storage conditions.
The choice of stabilizer is guided by the nature of the other additives present
such as plasticizers [20,21], fillers, or pigments [22]that may affect the stabiliz-
ing effect or react with the stabilizer to give undesirable products that may
weaken some of the desired properties of PVC. In the best conditions, heat
stabilizers must meet the following necessary properties [23-25]:
1. To eliminate the effect of all substances, including secondary decomposition
products, that accelerate PVC decomposition or induce the corrosion of
processing equipment.
2. To replace chlorine atoms in labile positions (for instance, in allylic posi-
tions) to create more stable bonds and to minimize the number of sites
capable of initiating dehydrochlorination.
3. To modify chain reactions so as to prevent the evolution of HCI by unzip-
ping reaction mechanism responsible for the formation of sequences of con-
jugated double bonds that cause polymer coloration.
4. To prevent or to limit the formation of conjugated double bond sequences by
promoting addition reactions or by functioning as an oxidation catalyst to
stabilize the color of PVC.
5. To have affinity to PVC and as far as possible to be nontoxic.

9.2: Thermal Stabilizers for Halogenated Polymers and Their Copolymers
151
A thermal stabilizer is used to improve the chemical stability of PVC at
processing temperatures. Many highly effective PVC thermal stabilizers are
already known [16,23-29], but their action mechanism is not yet completely
established [13,30-33]. Frye and Horst [34,35] suggest the following mecha-
nism for an organic soap type heat stabilizer where chlorine atoms in labile
positions are replaced by the alkyl carboxylate group as follows:
This mechanism is based on the fact that the activation energy of dehydro-
chlorination is lower than that necessary to remove the alkyl carboxylate group
from the chains.
Another hypothesis suggests that dehydrochlorination is inhibited by recom-
bination of HCI on double bonds by the action of stabilizer according to the
following mechanism [36]:
1.

The relative comparison between reaction rate constants in step 3 gives k3 =
20k) and when k2 ~ ks, the stabilizer' HCI complex accumulates. The stabi-
lizer is efficient when k3 ~ ks , The distribution of polyene lengths depends on
the ratio of the speed of evolution of HCI to its speed of readdition.
PVC heat stabilizers may be divided into two basic groups: metallic and
organic stabilizers. The first group is formed by inorganic, organic, acid, and
basic salts of metals-such as Pb, Cd, Sr, Ba, Zn, Mg, u , Ca, Na, and their
mixtures-and mainly by organotin compounds. The second group is made of
epoxides, chelating agents (organic phosphites), antioxidants, o-phenylindole,
and urea derivatives.

9.2.1
Metallic Salt Types
9:
Heat Stabilizers
Metallic salt types, also called primary stabilizers , have been the first to be used
in large quantity to stabilize PVC even though some of them, such as calcium
stearate, are not very efficient when used alone. The latter functions also as a
lubricant, and it is very often utilized combined with barium stearate. Mixtures
of primary stabilizers or of a primary stabilizer and an organic stabilizer are
commonly used in PVC stabilization. In spite of the numerous research and
application results accumulated on primary stabilizers , a unique explanation of
their mechanism has not been found yet.
A subdivision of primary stabilizers is necessary: a first group comprises
lead-based stabilizers; the second group is formed by calcium, barium, and
strontium salts; the third one is based on cadmium and zinc salts; and the last,
larger group is made of organotin-based stabilizers.
Lead stabilizers have been known for a long time. The most important ones
are
tribasic lead
sulfate
monohydrate
(3PbOÂ·PbS04' H20), dibasic
lead
stearate (2PbOÂ·(CI7H3SCOzhPb), and dibasic lead hydrophosphite hemihy-
drate (2PbOÂ·PbHPOd HzO). Their application domain has been greatly
enlarged in recent years because of the development of many effective synerge-
tic mixtures involving them [37,38] and because of the development of techni-
ques enabling them to be handled with the minimum health hazard [39]. The
mechanism of the stabilizing effect of lead stabilizers is not simple. Their
efficiency in decoloring partly degraded PVC is probably due to their action as
accelerators of the oxidation of colored structures [40]. They also slow down
dehydrochlorination [41]. They are used mainly for PVC extrusion but some
difficulties have been encountered when they were used to stabilize PVC for
calendering.
Barium, calcium, and strontium salt-based stabilizers belong to the so-
called slow stabilizer group. This is illustrated for barium salts as compared to
other PVC stabilizers , as shown in Fig. 9.3. Slow stabilizers are never used
alone but always in combination with cadmium or zinc salt-based stabilizers.
Cadmium and zinc salt-based stabilizers possess a highly effective stabiliz-
ing effect but only at the first stage of pyrolysis. PVC colors rapidly at the very
beginning, and this is explained by a catalytic effect of products from the
reaction between HCI and the stabilizer. In general, these products are ligands
such as HZnCl3 that accelerate PVC dehydrochlorination [42]. Cadmium and
zinc compounds enhance the formation of oxygen-containing groups that func-
tion as chromophores in the degraded PVC structure [43,44]. When used alone,
metallic soaps (Ba, Ca, Cd, Zn) do not neutralize HCI produced in a stoi-
chiometric way [41,45,46].
Heat stabilization by metallic soaps depends on their anions as well as on
their cations [37]. Affinity of anions to PVC plays an important role in their
degree of dispersion in the polymer matrix [47].
Synergetic mixtures of metallic soaps (mainly Ba, Ca, Cd, and Zn) have
found wide application as heat stabilizers [16,23,24,26,30,32,34-37,45,46,
48-53]. Synergism, in this case, is the action of two heat stabilizers achieving a
higher stability than the best offered by only one of the two (see Section 10.2.6).

This is illustrated in Fig. 9.4. The synergetic effect of Ba and Cd stearate
mixtures has been previously explained by their different capacity to stabilize
coloration as well as to react with HCl. In the first place, HCI reacts with
barium stearate, and BaCh thus formed does not affect dehydrochlorination or
coloration. On the other hand, cadmium stearate is a better coloration stabilizer
and it will not be affected by HCI as long as barium stearate is not completely
reacted with HCl. When this is done, cadmium stearate begins to react with
HCI, and the CdCh formed accelerates the coloration process after a while
[51].
A more accepted point of view on the synergetic effect of Ba-Cd and Ca-Zn
soap mixtures is based on the exchange between a labile allylic chlorine atom
and an alkylcarboxylate anion [50,52-54]. The mechanism of the effect is based
on the regeneration of cadmium or zinc alkylcarboxylate from their chlorides
by the action of barium or calcium alkylcarboxylate as follows, for the Ca-Zn
pair:

154

2. -CH2CH=CHCH=CH- + CH3COOH ~ -CH2CH=CHCHCH2-
I
OCOCH 3
To sum up, the three steps can be combined in a single one as follows:
However, the basic assumption that zinc or cadmium alkylcarboxylates re-
act preferentially with HCI is questionable, since it is based on the relative
basicity of metallic soaps. This mechanism cannot explain the whitening effect
on colored degraded PVC produced by metallic soaps added to the polymer
during mixing or calendering.
Synergetic mixtures presenting no health hazard are worthy of mention.
They are zinc-based compounds mixed mainly with calcium soaps. Since zinc-
containing
stabilizers function only at very
low concentration in PVC
(0.1-0.4% by weight), it is necessary to ensure a good dispersion of the stabi-
lizer mixture in the polymer matrix to obtain the best stabilizing effect. Too
high a concentration of zinc stabilizer decreases the heat stability of PVC
appreciably [55]. To avoid this, epoxide compounds should be used as HCI
acceptors in conjunction with the stabilizer mixture.
Stabilizers may react unfavorably (physically or chemically) with other addi-
tives also present in the polymer. This is called antagonism and is illustrated in
Fig. 9.4. One must also be very careful about the exact composition of stabi-
co

lizer mixtures: Each mixture shows a maximum and eventually a minimum
efficiency at specific compositions. For example, a dibasic lead maleate and
dibasic lead stearate mixture shows a maximum efficiency at 90% by weight of
stearate in the synergetic mixture [37]. To attain the maximum synergetic ef-
fect, different stabilizer compositions are made by keeping the nature of the
cations constant and by changing the nature of the alkylcarboxylate anions [37].
The neutralization reactions between a metallic soap and HCI produce the
corresponding fatty acid, such as stearic acid, that may affect positively or
negatively, the processibility of plastic materials. The fatty acid may function
as an internal lubricant for the melt polymer and this reduces overheating
during the mixing process [47]. But since fatty acids are not very miscible with
PVC, they migrate to the polymer surface and they interfere with some surface
treatments such as welding, printing, and metallization. Stearic acid acceler-
ates PVC dehydrochlorination and coloration [42].
Here are two synergetic combinations of heat and light stabilizers for PVC
plasticized by phosphates [28]:
Barium stearate, 2.0-2.5% by weight
Cadmium stearate, 0.5-1.0% by weight
Epoxidized soya oil, 5.0-7.0% by weight
and a nontoxic combination:
Calcium stearate, 2.75% by weight
Zinc stearate, 0.25% by weight
Epoxidized soya oil, 5.0-7.0% by weight
For PVC plasticized by phthalates or by phosphates, the following combination
is also recommended [28]:
Precipitated barium-cadmium laurate, 2.0% by weight
Epoxidized soya oil, 5.0% by weight
Organotin compounds are the most widespread primary heat stabilizers .
Since the first patent taken out by Ingve in this domain [56], a great number
of organotin compounds have been found to stabilize PVC. Only tetravalent tin
derivatives, mainly di- or tri-substituted, are efficient stabilizers. Divalent tin
derivatives are not efficient [57]; they function as weak stabilizers [58]. The
same holds true for tetrasubstituted derivatives such as tetrabutyltin [59]. The
most efficient are dibutyltin or dioctyltin, but there are many possibilities for
the substitution of the two free valencies.
The commercially available organotin stabilizers may be divided into two
main groups:
1. Stabilizers containing Sn-O bonds.
2. Stabilizers containing Sn-S bonds.

156
9: Heat Stabilizers
The first group contains mainly carboxylic acid organotin salts, alkyltin ma-
leates, alkyltin alcoxides, and polyoxides. Among this great number of pat-
ented organotin compounds, only a small number of them are commercially
produced ; dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTL) is the oldest and the most widely used.
However, its low efficiency at high temperature and its lack of affinity to PVC
causes some processing problems (e.g. , when welding PVC pieces). Organotin
stabilizers derived from maleic acid that react with polyene structures in de-
graded PVC chains are most effective:
~ C H=C H C H=C H- + ROOCCH=CHCOOR--'Â» -Q-

There is a great number of such derivatives, such as dibutyltin maleate, di(dibu-
tyltin monolaurate) maleate (a), and dibutyltin di(monoocytl maleate) (b).

9.2: Thermal Stabilizers for Halogenated Polymers and Their Copolymers
157
These stabilizers are effective for all kinds of PVC except those prestabilized
by Na2C03 or containing phenolic type emulsifiers [59].
There are other different types of organotin stabilizers containing the Sn-O
bond, such as alkyltin borates [60]:
where n = 0, I, 2
or tin alkylphosphates [61].
Generally, it can be said that organotin stabilizers containing the Sn-O bond
are good light stabilizers as well as good heat stabilizers. It is possible to
increase the light-stabilizing efficiency of these compounds by the use of the
Meister Z-3 type obtained by the copolymerization of dibutyltin oxide and a
dicarboxylic acid with an unsaturated side chain [62]. The same is true for
organotin derivatives containing the Sn-S bond, offering many possibilities .
The most simple ones are organotin sulfides that are related to the four groups
being currently produced: organotin mercaptides, organotin mercaptoalcohols,
organotin thioglycolates, and organotin polymers containing sulfur.
Organotin mercaptides have the general formula
R~Sn(SR")4-n
where
R' = alkyl, aryl
R" = alkyl, aryl or a heterocyclic radical such as 2-mercaptobenzothiazyl
The first stabilizer to be produced in this group was dibutyltin didodecyl mer-
captide. Presently, this group of heat stabilizers is the most important one for
PVC.
Organotin thioglycols are essentially used as mono- or dicarboxylic acid
esters. The general formula of organotin thioglycolates is

where

-SCH2CONHR (organotin salts of thioglycolic acid amides)
-SCH2CO(CH2)nOCOCH2SH (organotin salts of diesters of thiogly-
colic acid and a diol)
Organotin polymers are prepared by reacting organotin alkoxide polymers with
thio compounds such as thiols and mercaptocarboxylic acid esters.

158
9: Heat Stabilizers
To complete this section on organotin heat stabilizers, it is necessary to dis-
cuss the more recent developments in this field. First of all, compounds con-
taining both the Sn-O and the Sn-S bonds in their molecule are very interesting
as PVC stabilizers. They combine the excellent heat-stabilizing properties of
compounds containing the Sn-S bond and the light-stabilizing efficiency of
organotin carboxylic acid esters. The best ones are Meister Z-4 and Meister S-
37, which correspond to the general formula [62]:

Organotin compounds containing the Sn-N bond are very promising as PVC
stabilizers. They are organotin sulfonamides produced by reacting sulfon-
amides with dialkyltin oxides or organotin sulfamides such as organotin ortho-
sulfobenzimide. This new group of stabilizers will certainly find an important
application for plasticized PVC, since sulfonamide, one of the products of the
stabilization reaction, is miscible with the polymer and functions as an effective
PVC plasticizer at high temperature [63]. The stabilization mechanism for this
class of compounds is not established yet in spite of the intensive work done on
model systems and on commercial products [23,24,26,27,64-70].
In general, organotin stabilizers may be considered to function in the follow-
ing ways:

2. As inhibitors for radical chain reactions [71]. (It is supposed that these
stabilizers keep radicals or decomposition centers away from each other for
a preventive protection of the polymer or else they quench radicals coming
from antioxidants.)
3. As antioxidants [72].

In all cases they slow down the dehydrochlorination reaction and the change in

More recently, synergetic mixtures of organotin stabilizers have been devel-
oped. They are all made of two organotin derivatives and a third component
[73]: mono- and dialkyltin mercaptides with one alkaline metal salt of a carbox-
ylic or a thiocarboxylic acid , or one easily dispersible alkaline metal oxide,
hydroxide, or carbonate. Organic acid metallic salts in these synergetic mix-
tures function as internal lubricants that stabilize the melt flow of the polymer,
thus avoiding overheating because of friction. Dispersible metal hydroxides
function as HCl scavengers. The efficiency of these ternary synergetic mixtures
depends on their miscibility with PVC and the other additives.
Newcomers are antimony-based stabilizers. The interest for these com-
pounds is due to the classification, in the United States, of antimony mercap-
tide as a nontoxic chemical [39].
For outdoor applications of stabilized PVC , phosphites, antioxidants, and
UV absorbers are also added to produce synergetic effects.
In general, primary stabilizers are used at loadings of 0.5-5% by weight of
polymer [69].
9.2.2
Organic Stabilizers
These stabilizers are also called secondary stabilizers and they comprise epox-
ides, organic phosphites, antioxidants, o-phenylindole, urea derivatives, and 13-
aminocrotonic acid esters.
Epoxides are generally used as secondary stabilizers combined with primary
stabilizers such as metallic soaps and organotin derivatives to ease their disper-
sion in the polymer. Polyols have a similar effect [74]. They are also scavengers
for HCI:

9: Heat Â·Stabilizers
In combination with zinc-based stabilizers polyols stabilize thermal trans-
formations of PVC [46], but they should not be used in the presence of unsatu-
rated compounds giving reaction products that exude [44].
Organic phosphites are used for their chelating effect with metallic stabiliz-
ers to prevent undesirable results that might be caused by the formation of
metallic chlorides [75,76]. Some phosphites enhance the efficiency of other
stabilizers by their antioxidizing action [66,77]. Mascia suggests the following
mechanism for their stabilizing effect [25]:
-
CHCH2-
+ P(ORh --,> - C H,CH ,~ + RCI

Organic phosphites are also dealkylated by free HCl [78]. However, their stabi-
lizing action is believed to be more complicated, since it affects the entire
degradation mechanism.
The most effective ones are arylalkyl phosphites such as isooctyl diphenyl
phosphite or nonyl diphenyl phosphite. They are often dispersed in plasticizers
before their addition to polymers.
Antioxidants and UV absorbers (see Section 11.2) are also used as second-
ary PVC stabilizers [67]. They become necessary, since double bonds created
in degraded PVC can absorb radiation in the ultraviolet range which energy is
high enough to produce more dehydrochlorination. Furthermore, these radia-
tions could decompose peroxides or hydroperoxides formed or already present
in PVC and induce radical promoted oxidation of the polymer chains [68,69].
The wavelength range that may produce these undesired effects is believed to
go from 310 to 400 nm [79-82]. UV absorbers used for PVC are mainly benzo-
triazol, benzophenone derivatives, zinc oxide, and titanium oxide.
Antioxidants stop the oxidative destruction of PVC chains. They do not
increase the induction period of the dehydrochlorination reaction, but they
decrease its speed [83]. They are also used to protect some PVC plasticizers
against oxidation [84]. Their stabilizing effect on PVC coloration caused by
heat degradation is not so evident. There is a large number of well-known
antioxidants (see Section 10.2), but in the case of PVC, the following ones
are
selected:
substituted
phenols
[85],
such
as
bisphenols
containing
polymethylene or sulfur-based bridges [86], amino compounds (but some
accelerate PVC degradation [87]), and sulfur-containing compounds. Care must
be taken when antioxidants are used together with UV absorbers, since they
have opposite functions and often show antagonism [88].
a-Phenylindole and urea derivatives are used as stabilizers for PVC that is
prestabilized by sodium carbonate. o-Phenylindole is recommended to stabilize
rigid PVC, mainly the emulsion polymerized type [26]. Urea derivatives func-
tion according to the following mechanism [89]:
-NHCONHz --,> -N=CNH2 + HCI--4 H20 + -N=CNH2
6H
tl

More effective are urea epoxide derivatives such as
CHz-CHCHz-O-@-NHCONHz
-,
/
Â°
that may react with HCl by the amido group or by the epoxide group. This is
confirmed by the fact that compounds that cannot be easily enolized lose their
stabilizing properties very rapidly. The imidochloride formed with urea deriva-
tives is yellow and PVC thus stabilized is yellow colored. Urea and its aryl
derivatives and thiourea and its derivatives are currently used as PVC stabiliz-
ers [26]. As already mentioned, p- and m-epoxiphenyl urea have the highest
efficiency [89].
Sanitary regulations, mainly in the packing industry (bottles, packing cases,
films, or sheets), impose severe restrictions on the use of stabilizers for PVC.
In many cases, synergetic mixtures of zinc and cadmium soaps have to be used;
in most countries the use of 13-aminocrotonic acid esters is permitted [90]. The
best known is thiodiethyleneglycol-bis-13-aminocrotonate (Advastab A70),
which is sometimes applied combined with small quantities of zinc and calcium
stearates (Advastab A80). Both types of powdered stabilizers are efficient for
plasticized PVC and for rigid PVC and its copolymers. They are added at a
rate of 1-2% by weight of polymer and sometimes up to 3%. Advastab Gl, a
mixture of 13-aminocrotonic acid esters (mainly of 1,4-butylene glycol and C16-
CIS alcohols), is used at a rate of 0.4% by weight of polymer because of its
limited affinity to plasticizers. In spite of this, it is used for plasticized PVC as a
supplementary stabilizer; it functions also as a lubricant.
The efficiency of 13-aminocrotonic acid esters as stabilizers is increased by
the addition of lubricants such as soya oil (2 or 3 parts by weight).
(Note: Advastab is a trade name of stabilizers formerly produced by Deutsche
Advance Production GmbH. The same stabilizers are now produced by Ciba-
Geigy under the general trade name Irgastab.)

9.2.3
Effect of Homogenization on Stabilizer Efficiency
Many research works have shown that the degree of dispersion of heat stabiliz-
ers in the polymer matrix is the most important factor for their efficiency in
practical applications [91-96] . Thus their efficiency depends on the processing
used for the plastic material. It is quite different when homogenization is done
in a static or in a dynamic way, such as in the case of pressing or mixing and
also when homogenization is done with the melt polymer at high temperature or
with the powdered polymer at ambient temperature [64,65]. Theserelnarks are
confirmed by examples illustrated in Figs. 9.5-9.8 [65]. Results show without
any doubt that homogeneity is better achieved in the melt phase because of a
better contact between the polymer and stabilizers.

Antioxidants and Metal Ion Deactivating
Agents
10.1
Thermo-oxidative Degradation
In 1897 Engler and Bach [1] reported one of the earliest studies on thermo-
oxidative degradation of materials. They developed a theory of oxidation lead-
ing to peroxides.
Very important results from studies on oxidations in the gas phase have also
been obtained. They have shown that oxidation is a radical chain reaction, and
this has been confirmed more recently by electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR) [1].
The mechanism of oxidation in the liquid phase is more difficult to study. In
spite of numerous works published in this domain, it is not yet possible to
define exactly the basic processes or their relative importance in oxidation
reactions of liquid organic substances. However, the chemiluminescence
method offers some promising applications in this field [2]. It has been used to
show the participation of RÂ· and ROi radicals in these oxidation reactions [3].
This method measures the intensity of chemiluminescence produced by the
combination of ROi radicals. Absolute rates of different oxidizing reactions,
efficiencies of initiators, and rate constants of radical reactions involving some
antioxidants have been measured with this experimental technique [4]. A
stepwise mechanism based on results from many works [1,5,6] can be sug-
gested for the oxidation of hydrocarbons in the liquid phase . The same mecha-
nism can be applied to thermal oxidation and to light-induced oxidation of
polymers [7,8]: the main steps are as follows:
Initiation:
RH + O2 ~ RÂ· + HOi
activation energy (Ea) = 126-189 kJ mol- l [9,10,11].
(1)

168
10: Antioxidant s and Metal Ion Deactivating Agents
Free radicals RÂ· derived from RH might also be formed by a bimolecular
reaction according to
2RH- 2RÂ· + Hz
(2)
which is thermodynamically possible [12]. However, E; for step 2 is 280-410 kJ
mol" [13], which is twice as large as that for the much more probable step (1).
A trimolecular reaction is also possible [14]:

The abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a polyolefin is done by an intramo-
lecular reaction:
or by an intermolecular reaction [15]:
It must be recalled that the C-H bond scission energy varies relatively accord-
ing to the following series: -CH3 > -CHz- > -t-H.

From this mechanism it becomes evident that a quantitative and detailed
interpretation ofthe oxidation reaction ofliquid hydrocarbons is impossible. In
solid phase the oxidation reaction of polyolefins is more complicated to follow
and this is worse for all other polymers . For example, in PVC the dehydro-
chlorination reaction and the formation of double bonds play very important
roles. Polyamide oxidation occurs without an induction period and is different
from that of hydrocarbons. Condensation polymers, such as epoxy resins, and
polyacrylates are oxidized only at high temperatures and are difficult to stabi-
lize, since organic antioxidants decompose at such temperatures.

10: Antioxidants and Metal Ion Deactivating Agents
Thermo-oxidation is most important in polyolefins. It happens mainly during
their thermal processing, although PE is oxidized at normal temperature [19].
Results show that oxidation of PP is in many ways similar to that of liquid
hydrocarbons [1,10]. It has been shown that RÂ· radicals are oxidized into ROi
radicals forming two types of radicals: alkyl radicals, RCHzC:HCH2R', and allyl
radicals, RCHi:HCH=CHCH2R', which are probably formed by the reaction
of an alkyl radical with a macroradical containing a double bond.
Thermo-oxidative degradation mechanisms have been studied either by cal-
endering polymers at high temperature or by measuring the absorption of oxy-
gen by polymers in closed systems. This degradation induces chain scission,
decreases mechanical properties, increases the number of carbonyl groups [20]
and increases dielectric losses [21]. An increase of 0.05% by weight in C=O
content is accompanied by a tenfold increase in tan &, and this can be used as an
analytical test for measuring this content. As thermo-oxidation goes on, other
groups, such as -OOH, -OH, and -COOH, are formed [22]. The oxygen
absorption shows an induction period that decreases as temperature or pres-
sure increases [23].
Polyolefins do not depolymerize but a series of low-molecular-weight com-
pounds is produced: paraffins, olefins, water, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde,
acetone, methanol, hydrogen peroxide, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and
hydrogen [16,24-26]. All secondary products are formed by the decomposition
of hydroperoxides, the original products [27,28]. Oxidation reactions have a
relatively high activation energy; some typical examples are given in Table 10.1
[1]. For this reason oxidation reactions depend strongly on temperature and are
therefore important at the high temperatures encountered during polymer pro-
cessing. Oxidation is more rapid in amorphous regions, where it begins [29],
and these regions enlarge as the reaction goes on [30]. In some polyolefins,
such as PE, cross-links are formed beside degradation, and this occurs mainly
at high temperature.
Paraffins degrade relatively slowly by oxidation . This is an autocatalytic
reaction that is accelerated by heat and light or by substances that function as
oxidation catalysts. Tertiary carbon atoms are the most sensitive to oxidation;
consequently, heat stability of the following polymers decreases as shown:
polyethylene > polypropylene> polyisobutylene
Unsaturated polymers oxidize much more rapidly because they contain a car-
bon atom in the allylic position. They oxidize very easily in the presence of
ozone by its addition on double bonds followed by a chain scission:
This is why antioxidants should be used for rubber-based materials intended for
outdoor applications.

As mentioned in the previous section, R', RO', and ROi radicals and hydroper-
oxides are the main products of hydrocarbon oxidation. For this reason, easily
oxidized polymers (polyolefins, polyamides, polystyrene, etc.) are stabilized by
compounds that can react directly with peroxide radicals or directly with
hydroperoxides. They are substituted phenols, aromatic amines, mercaptans,
organic sulfides, etc.; they are called antioxidants.
When antioxidants are used, the following points must be kept in mind:
1. Many antioxidants function as oxidation inhibitors only when present above
a given concentration called the critical concentration.
2. Antioxidants not only can quench active radicals but also can induce oxida-
tion under certain conditions.
3. Combinations of different antioxidants may give synergetic or antagonistic
mixtures.
From all these considerations it is clear that the use of antioxidants as efficient
oxidation inhibitors or retardants is rather complicated.
10.2.1
The Critical Concentration
The value of the induction period of the oxidation reaction (Ip ) is a measure of
antioxidant efficiency. Figure 10.1 shows the general trend of the effect of
different antioxidants on oxidation kinetics of polyolefins. Obviously, oxida-
tion progresses in the same manner as for unstabilized polymer when all the
antioxidant has been consumed. In many cases, physical properties of the
polymer change quite seriously even in the absence of oxidation during the
induction period. However, it is necessary to know the effect of antioxidants
on physical properties.
Many antioxidants are operative only above a given concentration, called
the critical concentration [AHJcril [I]. The effect of concentration on I p depends
on the nature of the antioxidant. In most cases, I p does not change for small

quantities of antioxidant but increases rapidly above a critical concentration to
reach a plateau value (curve a) or to pass through a maximum value (curve b),
as shown in Fig. 10.2. This leveling off or decreasing effect of antioxidant
concentration on its activity at high concentrations is explained by the initiation
effect ofantioxidant radicals [3I]. This hypothesis is based on results showing a
decrease in the molecular weight and physical properties of the polymer even
during the induction period [32,33] and also on the fact that some antioxidant
mixtures show antagonism [34]. Neiman [I] has suggested the following mecha-
nism for the initiation process based on these observations:
I. Initiation by oxidation of the antioxidant:
AH + O2 -
HOi + AÂ·
2. Reactive AÂ· radicals may sometimes react with the polymer to produce free
macroradicals:
AÂ· + RH -
AH + RÂ·

possible:

The critical concentration increases with the oxidation reaction tempera-
ture, i.e. , with the polymer processing temperature and the dependence of
induction period on concentration becomes less important. This means that a
higher quantity of antioxidant is necessary to obtain a sufficiently long induc-
tion period at high temperatures.
10.2.2
Action Mechanism of Antioxidants
The first antioxidants used in the polymer industry were found by trial and
error. The complete knowledge of the necessary properties of stabilizing sys-
tems against polymer oxidation was found later.
The basic objective in the selection of antioxidants is to obtain the best
stabilization with no effect on optimum values of technical properties of poly-
mers . The stabilizing effect on oxidative degradation is based on protection
against the formation of active free radicals and on nonradical decomposition of
hydroperoxides. Optimum stabilization is obtained by the combination of dif-
ferent compounds that function with different mechanisms as metallic ion deac-
tivating agents, UV absorbers, and so on.
Antioxidants are classified according to the mechanism of their effect on
polymer oxidation. Those that interrupt the oxidation chain reaction by react-
ing with the active radicals are called primary antioxidants. Those that decom-
pose hydroperoxides are called secondary antioxidants. It must be kept in mind
that antioxidant efficiency is affected by active products derived from self-
oxidation reactions of the basic polymer. It is possible to protect a highly
oxidized polymer against further oxidation by the use of peroxide decompos-
ers. Weak peroxide decomposers are effective only when they are added to the
polymer prior to the thermo-oxidative reaction [13].
10.2.3
Antioxidants that Interrupt the Oxidation Chain Reaction
(Primary Antioxidants)
Antioxidants that interrupt the oxidation chain reaction react with active radi-
cals to produce stable, less active radicals [35-38]:
ROOÂ· + AH~ ROOH + AÂ·
(inactive radical)
(I )
According to Mascia, the mechanism would be [39]
P . + AH ~ PH + A .
(2)

where P: is the propagating species and may include any of the following
groups:
-CHi,
-CH ~ , -C',
-CH20',
'OH,
etc.
I
I
R
R
This mechanism holds mainly for phenol derivatives; in these cases the inactive
radical is stabilized by resonance:
This mechanism has not been well established for aromatic amines, except in a
few cases . The same is true for mercaptans and urea derivatives, but the
existence of stabilized radicals has not been well demonstrated [13],nor has the
existence of intermediate radicals, such as RO' , leading to the formation of
stabilized radicals:
RO' + AH~ ROH + AÂ·
(3)
The reactivity of the AÂ· radical varies with the type of antioxidant. In some
cases it may react just as an RÂ· radical:
AÂ· + 02~ AOO'
(4)
and since the AOO' radical is capable of initiating the chain reaction, one has
AOO' + RH ~ AOOH + RÂ·
(5)
Obviously, reactions (4) and (5) are undesirable. Other initiation reactions are
also possible between the A radical and the polymer or the polymer hydroper-
oxide
AÂ· + RH ~ AH + RÂ·
AÂ· + ROOH ~ AOR + 'OH
(6)
(7)
Reaction (6) is possible when the AÂ· radical is very reactive. This is what
happens with some radicals from sterically hindered phenols or secondary
aromatic amines, which constitute most of the important antioxidants [40].
Stabilization of aryloxyl radical increases with the size of ortho- and para-

10.2: Antioxidants
175
substituents of phenols. Then the transfer of radical is completely blocked
when all three positions are substituted, e.g., by tertiary butyl groups that
stabilize the free radical [35]:
o
(CH'hCL$rq CH'J'
C(CH3h
(2,4,6-tri-tert-buty\phenol radical)
The AÂ· radical with the aryloxyl structure as when derived from phenols can
also be formed by the reaction of the antioxidant with the macroradical R , and
this happens mainly when the oxygen concentration is low:
AH + R'~A' + RH
or when oxygen is in its fundamental or singlet state:
AH + 30 2 ~ A- + 'OOH
AH + 102~ AÂ· + 'OOH
(8)
(9)
(9')
This reaction , which deactivates the antioxidant and which generates 'OOH
radicals, decreases at the same time the activity of the thermo-oxidation stabi-
lizer. Obviously, reactions (9) and (9') are possible only when the antioxidant
can be easily oxidized. This may happen especially at higher antioxidant con-
centrations in polymer [33,41,42].
When the aryloxyl radical AÂ· takes part in termination reactions in one of its
resonance forms, its antioxidizing effect increases:
AÂ· + ROO, ~ AOOR
2A'~ AA
AÂ· + ROÂ· ~ nonreactive products
(10)
(11)
(12)
The antioxidant can take part in all elementary phases of the oxidation reac-
tion. But the better its efficiency, the less it takes part in initiation and propaga-
tion reactions [13], and this depends on its structure [35]. The efficiency of the
stabilizer depends on the position of substituents relative to the OH group and
on their chemical character, since their mutual tolerance (compatibility) and
their affinity to polymers are of prime importance. For example, in the case of
phenolic derivatives used for polyolefins, the paraffinic character of alkyl
substituents of these antioxidants increases their affinity to the polymer. As far
as efficiency is concerned, the best positions for substituents are 2, 4, and 6.
Except for alkyl groups , the efficiency of antioxidants increases with the
presence of NH2 and SH groups.

176
10: Antioxidants and Metal Ion Deactivating Agents
It is possible to summarize results from many sources in the following points
[13,43]:
1. The antioxidant effect is increased by
a. Electron donor substituents (alkyl, CH30 , etc.) in ortho and para posi-
tions.
b. Ortho-alkyl groups branched in the a position.
2. The antioxidant effect is decreased by
a. Electron acceptor substituents (N0 2, COOH, halogens).
b. Para-alkyl groups branched in the a position.
It is necessary to say that the entire action mechanism of antioxidants that
interrupt the oxidation chain reaction cannot be sufficiently explained by reac-
tion (1) only. In this reaction mechanism, the rate-determining step (i.e., the
direct break of the active hydrogen from the molecule of antioxidant) has not
been unambiguously proved as yet. Thus many authors consider, as the rate-
determining step, reaction (14)between a complex produced at the first stage of
the mechanism and a radical ROOÂ·, a molecule of antioxidant or another radi-
cal [13,42,44-46,49]:
ROOÂ· + AH ~ [ROOÂ· ~ AH]
[ROOÂ· ~ HA] + ROOÂ· ~ nonreactive products
(13)
(14)
Formation of hydroperoxides that become potential chain reaction initiators
is characteristic of the phenolic antioxidant action mechanism. They decom-
pose at high temperature (100-150Â°C) and a portion of the antioxidant is con-
sumed by their deactivation. Their decomposition to form radicals is acceler-
ated by light [46]. For this reason phenolic antioxidants are usually not
effective at high temperatures and special antioxidants must then be used.
These stabilizers combine effective parts of phenolic antioxidants to fragments
that function by destroying peroxidic compounds .
Volatility is another point to keep in mind when antioxidants are utilized at
high temperature. For this reason condensation products containing many ben-
zene rings or polymeric antioxidants are preferred [47].
Examples of phenolic antioxidants are given in Table 10.2 [1,39]. Phenol
derivatives are used as antioxidants for different polymers. They are suitable
for polyolefins because they are very compatible with them and because they
have high boiling points and high efficiency as antioxidants. They have an
acceptable low toxicity. They protect polymers against changes in their me-
chanical properties at processing temperatures above 220Â°C.
Aromatic amine-type antioxidants do not usually affect mechanical proper-
ties of polymers processed up to 250Â°C. They are used for dark-colored materi-
als intended only for technical applications. Their efficiency is increased by the
presence of OH groups [1]. The most commonly used are secondary amines

It has also been shown that secondary amines (e.g., diphenylamine) may react
not only with free ROO' radicals but also with polymer hydroperoxides to
generate free radicals [50]:
ROOH + Ar2NH ~ H20 + RO' + Ar2N'
They are used in small quantities (0.003-0.05 mol kg-I).
Among mercaptans with a high inhibition effect mercaptobenzothiazole,
mercaptobenzimidazole, l3-naphthylthiol, and some aliphatic mercaptans such
as dodecylmercaptan are recommended. They are added in relatively large
quantity (-1% by weight), which often affects physical properties, especially
mechanical properties, of polymers because of their poor compatibility with
polyolefins. The following mechanism has been suggested for their antioxidant
activity [l ,39]:

Peroxide Decomposers (Secondary Antioxidants)
Peroxide decomposers react with peroxides to form stable products. Their low
reactivity toward dialkyl and mainly polymer peroxides limits their domain of
application [13]. The induced hydroperoxide decomposition may be generally
given by [51]
y+ ROOH~ ROH + YO
where Y represents the secondary antioxidant molecule. This mechanism is
valid for organic compounds containing sulfur, such as sulfides [52], disulfides
[53,54], xanthates, and dithiocarbamates, or phosphorus acid esters.
The organic sulfides used are mostly diphenyl sulfide, di-Bvnaphthyl sulfide,
sulfides of the thiophene series, and disulfides [I]. Their reaction with hydro-
peroxides is as follows [52]:
ROOH + R'SR' ~ R'SR' + ROH
~o

10.2: Antioxidants
179
The sulfoxides thus formed also have inhibiting properties and react with per-
oxides to produce sulfones:
ROOH + R'SOR' -
R'SOzR' + ROH
These reactions happen without formation of free radicals.
Phosphorus acid esters are very well-known antioxidants, mainly for
polyolefins, but as mentioned previously, they also find application as PVC
stabilizers (see Section 10.2.2). Good examples are tri(nonylphenyl) phosphite
(Santowhite TNPP).
P(-O- @-C,H"h
tris (mixed mono- and dinonylphenyl) phosphite (Polygard)

(H"C'--@-O-J"P(-O-Â©>C'H"h-"
and tri-p-tert-butylphenyl phosphite. Esters such as the 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-
methylphenyl ester of pyrocatechol phosphorus acid or naphthol pyrocatechol
ester, etc. [1,13,39] also fall into this class of antioxidants. They are more
effective than the triaryl phosphites. Phosphites induce hydroperoxide decom-
position. Their mechanism of action is not well understood, but it can be simply
described by the following general scheme [39,51]:
- CH-
+ P(ORh -
- CH- + 0 +- P(ORh

Some phosphites are very efficient as peroxide decomposers. They are gener-
ally noncoloring and nontoxic. Table 10.4 lists the most-used phosphites [39].
10.2.5
Carbon Blacks as Antioxidants
The use of carbon blacks as antioxidants is veryinteresting . In the case of
polyolefins, they function as UV absorbers and as antioxidants [1]. Carbon
blacks with a large specific area are much more efficient. Their efficiency as
antioxidants depends on the degree of oxidation of their surface, i.e., on the
number of OH, CO, and quinoid groups [55,56]. Carbon blacks behave as
macromolecular antioxidants and they are sometimes more efficient than any

other antioxidant. For example, in the case of PE, 3% by weight of carbon
black is more efficient than 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol at 140Â°C [1]. How-
ever, the use of carbon blacks is very complicated and care must be taken
against their antagonistic effect, which appears when they are combined with
other antioxidants such as certain phenols or amines (diphenyl p-phenylene-
diamine).
In most cases, carbon blacks show synergism when combined with other
antioxidants, mainly with sulfur-containing compounds [53,54,57,58]. The
mechanism of this synergetic effect is not very well understood.
10.2.6
Synergetic and Antagonistic Effects of Antioxidant
Combinations
As was previously mentioned, antioxidants function as inhibitors for the radical
chain propagation or as polymer hydroperoxide decomposers. Some combina-
tions of antioxidants produce a synergetic effect, i.e., the efficiency of the
mixture is higher than that of each of the antioxidants taken separately
[1,51,59,60]. The definition of synergism as applied to additive mixtures needs
to be clarified, since it is often misinterpreted. The phenomenon is illustrated
in Fig. 10.3, together with the effect known as antagonism. A synergetic mix-
ture of two or more antioxidants or stabilizers possesses an efficiency that is
higher than that of the best antioxidant functioning alone, on the same quantity
basis (component B). This means that all mixture compositions that have an
efficiency (Ip ) defined by a point in the hatched part under curve C shows
synergism. The mixture with the composition defined by X does not show

synergism, since B taken alone has a higher Ip value than the mixture. In the
case of antagonism, the mixture shows an efficiency lower than that of the
worst of the antioxidants (component A); all mixture compositions leading to a
point in the hatched part above curve D show an antagonistic effect.
Homosynergism defines the case where the antioxidants in the synergetic
mixture function according to the same mechanism, and heterosynergism is
when the antioxidants function according to different mechanisms. Hetero-
synergism can be illustrated by a synergetic mixture of a phenolic antioxidant
(such as 2,6-di-tert-octyl-4-methylphenol), which has only a little effect on the
increase of I p for PP, and of a hydroperoxide decomposer of the diphenyl
sulfide type, which has also a small efficiency when used alone. But when these
two are combined together, I p becomes much longer at 200Â°C [1]. In this exam-
ple, the synergetic composition corresponds to a 1:1 ratio, as in many other
cases. Other antioxidant composition ratios are also possible, as shown in
Table 10.5 [1]. The mechanisms of homosynergism and heterosynergism are
not yet defined, but they seem to be different from that for a single antioxidant.
However, these phenomena are very important in the plastics industry.
10.3
Metal Ion Deactivating Agents
Some metal ions (C02+ , Ni2+ , Cd2+ , Pb2+ , etc.) contained in polymers as impu-
rities may function as oxidation catalysts by accelerating hydroperoxide de-
composition [13,39,59]. Hydroperoxides are decomposed especially by heavy
metal (Co, Cu, Mn, Fe, Pb) ions already present in polymers from contact with

metallic parts of reactors and processing machines or from many other
sources, e.g., catalyst residues of Ziegler-Natta or redox initiation, pigments,
fillers, etc. The catalytic effect of these ions depends on the nature of the
polymer. It can be demonstrated by the following mechanism [61,62]:
ROOH + Me?" ~ RO' + HO- + Me(n+l)+
ROOH + Me(n+l)+ ~ ROO, + H+ + Mev'
The combination of these two reactions leads to the following net reaction:
Men +
2ROOH ~ ROO, + RO' + H20
Metallic ions oxidize more easily in organic media than in water, and this
affects their relative catalytic activity in homogeneous systems as compared to
aqueous emulsions. Metallic ions, mainly from cobalt and iron, can also form
complexes with oxygen that react with polymers to produce active free radicals
Me?" + O2 ~ [Me(n+I)+021 ~ active radicals
that may participate in the initiation of thermo-oxidation [63,64]. It is possible to
inhibit this type of undesired effect [65,66]. Metallic ions can be fixed in a stable
complex, and thus their further coordination with hydroperoxides can be pre-
vented. It is also possible to stabilize them in a valency state so that they cannot
react to decompose hydroperoxides.
Ion deactivating agents usually have negligible antioxidizing properties but
sometimes they show synergetic effects with antioxidants. They are used
mainly together with phenolic antioxidants.
Chelating agents can be used as metal deactivators. But prior to their use in a
given plastic formulation, it is necessary to know the entire composition of the
mixture. The activity of some metals bound in complexes might exceed that of
simple systems and thus accelerate self-oxidation. For example, bis-salicyli-
dene-ethylenediamine, when used with hydrocarbons, strongly accelerates
their oxidation in the presence of iron and cobalt ions, but in the presence of
copper, in concentration four times larger than that of the metal, it inhibits self-
oxidation of hydrocarbons [59].
The most important class of chelating agents is comprised of compounds
based on organic phosphines and phosphites and higher nitrogenated organic
compounds (e.g., melamine, bis-salicylidene diamines, oxamides, etc.) [39].

Ultraviolet Protecting Agents
11.1
Photo-oxidative Degradation
Light radiation contributes very actively to polymer aging, especially when
oxygen is present, which is a normal situation for most plastic materials . For
example, when natural rubber is exposed to UV radiation at 45Â°e, it oxidizes
three times as fast as in the dark at 700e [1].
The effect of natural radiation on matter can be explained by the corpuscular
or photon theory or by the wave theory of light [2]. The wavelength spectrum
of natural light goes from 0.7 nm up to 1000 nm, but only a part of it reaches the
surface of the earth . Short UV waves Â« 175 nm) are absorbed by oxygen at an
altitude of about 100km in the upper atmosphere. Most of the UV radiation in
the 175-290-nm range is absorbed by the ozone protective layer. Only a very
narrow band around 210 nm that is not absorbed either by oxygen or by ozone
is detectable at the surface of the earth by very sensitive instruments. The
shortest wavelengths from the sunlight recorded on earth are 286 nm at the
North pole, 287 nm at the Azores, and 293 nm at Davos in Switzerland [3].
Natural radiation is also partly scattered by the gas molecules and suspended
particles in the atmosphere. Since the intensity of scattered light varies with the
inverse of the wavelength to the fourth power, UV radiations are more scat-
tered than higher-wavelength radiations. In spite of all this, the intensity of UV
radiation is not completely vanished and 5% of the incident natural light that
reaches the surface of the earth is in the 300-400 nm range and has the most
harmful effect on polymers [3,4]. UV light energy is high enough to break
chemical bonds in polymers and produce degradation reactions.
According to the first law of photochemistry formulated in the works of
Grothu s (1817) and Draper (1843), only the light that is absorbed by a molecule
can be effective in producing photochemical change in the molecule [2]. Light
absorption depends on the wavelength spectrum of the incident light and on the

11.1: Photo-oxidative Degradation
187
chemical structure of the polymer (i.e., on the content of absorbing chemical
groups on the polymer chain). For example, C=O groups absorb radiation
having wavelengths of 187 and 280-320 nm. So a polymer, to be affected by
radiation, must contain chemical groups sensitive to one or more wavelengths
present in the incident light spectrum [5]. Table 11.1 gives the wavelengths that
produce the maximum degradation of some polymers [6-9].
Only a small part of the energy of the absorbed light is consumed by the
photochemical reaction [10]. The chemical reaction induced by light radiation
is explained by the corpuscular theory. According to the Stark-Einstein law ,
called the second law of photochemistry, the number of activated molecules is
a function of the number of photons absorbed, which means that the absorption
of one photon activates only one molecule [2,3]. Therefore, the energy ab-
sorbed by a system from light radiation is quantized. The number of activated
molecules (N) produced by the absorption of light energy (E) is given by the
relation
N = E/hv
where
h = Planck's constant (6.625 x 10-34 J s)
v = frequency of the radiation
(11.1)
When N is equal to the Avogadro number, the energy E is equal to I einstein,
which is related to 1 mole of substance. The energy E depends on the wave-

Table 11.2 gives values for E for different wavelengths. For example, the value
of E for a 300-nmwavelength is 399kJ mol-I, which is sufficient for the scission
of a C-C bond and for many other bonds. Table 11.3gives the bond energies for
many chemical bonds [10] and a comparison with Table 11.1 shows that many
polymers may degrade by absorption of light energy.
Light stability of polymers depends on many factors, such as their purity,
the presence of different additives, their preparation and processing history; for
example, degradation induced by processing may change their structure. PVC
photo-oxidative degradation may be used to illustrate the effect of these fac-
tors. According to Table 11.3 the bond energy is 327kJ mol:" for a C-Cl bond
and 410 kJ mol-I for a C-H bond ; a 290-nm wavelength radiation would be
then sufficient to degrade PVC. But usually this polymer begins to degrade at
much lower energy, corresponding to the 310-370-nm wavelength range. This
is due to the presence of structural defects such as conjugated double bonds
[11], to peroxidic and carboxylic groups, to hydroperoxides coming directly
from initiators or formed by oxidation [12], to impurities and to different addi-
tives. Light and metallic ions accelerate this decomposition [13,14] (see Section
10.3).

Some substances or impurities function as photosensitizers; they absorb
light and they transmit its energy to macromolecules or to other molecules that
become reactive. Iron and copper salts function as photosensitizers in the case
of PVC [15]. Other substances, on the contrary, are capable of absorbing active
light radiations (in the 220-230-nm range [16,17]) and of transforming them into
energy or radiations harmless to the polymer. These substances function as UV
absorbers or screening agents.
These observations provide a basis for explaining differences observed in
light stability of plastic materials containing the same basic polymer. Unlike
ordinary chemical reactions, photochemical reactions proceed according to
primary and secondary processes. The primary process is induced by the direct
action of light absorbed by a molecule [2] and secondary processes are the
reactions involving molecules, atoms, and radicals formed in the primary pro-
cess [3]. Secondary processes may continue to progress in darkness, and this is
why the number of molecules transformed by a photochemical reaction is not
necessarily related to the number of molecules directly affected by light radia-
tion in the primary process [3,18]. The Stark-Einstein photochemical equiva-
lent law is applicable only to primary processes.

190
II: Ultraviolet Protecting Agents
The number of moles of the light-absorbing substance that react for each
einstein of absorbed radiation is called the quantum efficiency or the quantum
yield [2,3]:
number of moles reacting
<I> = number of einsteins absorbed
The actual value of the quantum yield provides information that makes it possi-
ble to understand the nature and the importance of the secondary processes.
When <I> < 1, a part of the energy of the excited or activated molecules is lost
(by transformation to thermal energy, for example) before they can react chem-
ically or products of the primary process are formed in secondary processes.
When <I> > 1, chain reactions are initiated by the reacting molecules. Activation
of molecules depends on the radiation intensity, on its wavelength, and on
polymer chemical structure but not on the total quantity of energy absorbed
from the radiation.
There also exists a basic difference between the light effect and the heat
effect on relative rates of reactions responsible for coloration or discoloration
of polymers. For example , PVC coloration produced by thermal degradation is
very rapid as compared to that produced by photo-oxidation which is masked
by oxidation of conjugated double bonds produced by thermal dehydro-
chlorination. This oxidation is responsible for the polymer whitening. This
difference between light and heat degradation is also noticeable by the effect on
physical properties. For example, mechanical properties of PVC do not change
appreciably during thermal degradation, but when the polymer is exposed to
UV radiation, tensile and flexion strengths decrease rapidly and the polymer
becomes brittle.
Light radiation increases the brittleness of polyolefins and seriously lowers
their physical properties, mainly mechanical properties. Such degradation is
more pronounced in the presence of oxygen. All modifications produced by
photo-oxidative degradation are similar to those produced by thermal degrada-
tion and.are accelerated by an increase in light intensity [19] and tempera-
ture [20].
11.2
UV Absorbers
UV absorbers are substances that absorb a given portion of the natural light
spectrum, the energy of which is high enough to induce polymer degradation
by initiating primary free radicals or by decomposing hydroperoxides [21]. UV
absorbers or screening agents must meet the following basic conditions
[9,22-25]:
1. They should absorb 300-400-nm wavelength radiation more readily than the
polymer.

11.2: UV Absorbers
191
2. They should not react with the polymer.
3. They should transform absorbed energy into harmless energy, i.e., energy
corresponding to high wavelengths or thermal energy that does not heat the
polymer above its decomposition temperature.
4. They should be stable, i.e., capable of absorbing radiative energy without
undergoing decomposition.
Substances satisfying these conditions are colorless and do not absorb in the
high-wavelength range. It is possible to classify them according to their chemi-
cal structure as derivatives of 2-hydroxybenzophenone, esters of aromatic ac-
ids and aromatic alcohols, hydroxyphenyl-benzotriazoles, substituted acryloni-
triles, metallic complexes (excited-state quenchers), and inorganic pigments
[4,9,23,26,27].
11.2.1
Derivatives of 2-hydroxybenzophenone
Derivatives of 2-hydroxybenzophenone have highly conjugated structures and
a capacity to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds . According toChaudet [28],
capacity to form chelated cycles is a necessary condition for UV absorbency.
He found a direct relation between the degree of absorbency of a UV absorber
and the strength of the intramolecular hydrogen bond. The light energy con-
sumed by a UV absorber corresponds to the quantity of energy needed to break
that hydrogen bond. This explanation is supported by the fact that compounds
that cannot lead to the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds (benzophe-
none or 2-methoxybenzophenone) do not absorb in the UV wavelength range
[29]. The high energy of UV radiation is reduced by rearrangement into a
quinoid structure [4,2,9,30]:

UV absorbers in this class are characterized by compounds containing at
least one hydroxyl group in an ortho position on the benzene ring. It is possible
to divide them into compounds:
Containing only one OR group in the ortho position that are almost colorless
(they do not absorb above 390 nm wavelength).
Containing one OH group in the ortho position on both benzene rings that
are slightly yellow colored (they absorb in the visible part of the natural
light spectrum).

192
II : Ultraviolet Protecting Agents
As mentioned previously , benzophenone does not absorb in the UV domain
but the addition of a OH or a CH30 group in the 2 or 4 position makes the
product absorb radiations above the UV range. Substitution in the 2 position is
more effective than in the 4 position , since 4-hydroxybenzophenone does not
absorb 90% of UV radiations. Each substitution by a OH group in other than
the 4 position increases the absorption range by 10 nm downward, whereas a
CH30 substitution increases it by 5 nm in the same direction. Besides this
effect, the lengthof alkoxy radicals bound to the benzene ring does not affect
the UV absorbency of the compound but does influence its affinity to the
polymer [31].

Salicylic acid derivatives have a limited use, since their light absorption covers
only the 290-320-nm range and they undergo structure modification under
illumination (Fig. 11.1) [27].
The efficiency of certain aryl esters of aromatic acids is close to that of 2,4-
dihydroxybenzophenone [9]. They absorb in the 230-350-nm range.

11.2.3
Hydroxyphenyl Benzotriazoles
Hydroxyphenyl benzotriazoles have the following general structure [32]:
where X is H or Cl (chlorine shifts the absorption to longer wavelengths), R is
H or alkyl, R' is alkyl (R and R' increase the affinity to polymers). The most
important materials in this class are 2-(2'-hydroxyphenyl) benzotriazole and
(5'- rerz-octyl-pherryl) benzotriazole, which represent a new category of UV
absorbers. They are represented by the commercial product Tinuvin P (see
Tables 11.4[9,33,34] and 11.5[35]);its absorption power is very high in the UV
range and it shows a maximum absorbency around 400 nm. It also has very
good light stability [34,36]. Hydroxybenzotriazole derivatives generally absorb
in the 280-300 nm range.
The tendency to form chelated rings by the creation of hydrogen bonds be-
tween hydroxide and carbonyl groups or groups containing nitrogen is a char-
acteristic property of all UV absorbers. The exact mechanism of light absorp-
tion by hydroxybenzotriazoles is not known; however, the formation of

Metallic complexes or excited-state quenchers are also used to stabilize
polymers, mainly polyolefins. They are nickel and cobalt compounds corre-
sponding to the following structure [32,37]:
These additives interact with photo-excited polymer molecules and deactivate
them by dissipating the excess energy as IR radiations [4]. Metallic complexes,
based on Ni, Co, and complexes substituted by phenols, thiophenols, dithiocar-
bamates, dithiophosphinates, or phosphates, are used. Typical representatives
are nickel dibutyldithiocarbamate or (2,2'-thiobis[4-tert octylphenolato])-n-
butylamine nickel and nickel (O-ethyl 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl) phos-
phonate . But their use is not as widespread as for other UV absorbers because
they tend to be green [9].
In some cases they may be combined with titanium or zinc oxides. For
instance, polyolefins can be stabilized by a mixture of zinc oxide, titanium
oxide, and zinc alkyldithiocarbamate [26].
When pigments or carbon blacks are used as UV absorbers or screening
agents, dispersion and particle size are very important [38]. For example, good
results have been obtained for PE light radiation stability by the use of acti-
vated carbon blacks with particle sizes below 25 nm.

Flame Retardants
12.1
Burning of Plastics
Burning of plastics presents a very serious problem that limits their application
as building materials and in automobile and aviation industries, in mines, and so
on. Recent disastrous accidents have raised suspicion about them in the mind
of prospective users and severe safety regulations have been imposed on the
plastics industry.
Most of the basic commercial polymers are flammable [1]. Burning of plas-
tics is a complicated phenomenon depending mainly on the chemical structure
of polymers and on some physical factors [2]. The flammability of plastics is
particularly severe when the basic polymers undergo depolymerization to form
flammable monomers or active products. Such is the case for PS, PMMA,
polyoxymethylene (paM), NR, etc.
The presence of nonflammable elements such as Cl, N, Si, and P in polymer
chains decreases their flammability and their self-ignition (e.g., CPE, poly-
amide, polyacrylonitrile) . Some polymers become completely flame resistant
when their chains are made only of carbon and a nonflammable element; such is
the case for PTFE or PVC, poly(vinylidene chloride)(PVDC), and chlorinated
PVC(CPVC), which are extinguished immediately when taken out from the
flame. The heat of combusion of CPVC, for instance, is not sufficient to provide
the necessary thermal energy to cause the material to pyrolyze and produce
volatiles at a rate sufficient to sustain ignition; consequently, the flame will
eventually extinguish [3]. Chlorinated polymers are less flammable than their
fluorinated counterparts. Table 12.1 shows the resistance to flammability in
relation to paM of well-known commercial polymers having different chemical
structures [4]. Obviously, the resistance to flammability decreases when the
hydrogen and the oxygen contents increase in the polymeric chain. An increase
in the C/O ratio results in a decrease in the polymer flammability.

Until now it has been very difficult to find objective criteria permitting the
classification of polymers according to their behavior in flames and during
combustion. It is only possible to classify them on the basis of qualitative
criteria defined by the limited oxygen index (LOI) [5] derived from the candle-
type test [6]. This qualitative index is based on the assumption that superficial
pyrolysis of the polymer results from its heating up in an atmosphere of pyro-
lytic and combustion products and that no direct reaction takes place between
the oxidizing gas, the active particles produced in the flame in some cases, and
the polymer surface. This burning mechanism is possible only for polymers that
do not depolymerize upon heating. In all other cases the oxidation of the
polymer surface plays an important role during gas formation [4,7]. There is no
doubt that free radicals are active species in the combustion.
To understand the burning of polymers better, the combustion region may be
divided into five zones, as shown in Fig. 12.1 [7]. The first zone is defined by
the polymer layer where pyrolysis takes place and where only a small portion
of the oxidation reaction occurs. The second one is the superficial zone, where
thermal oxidation really takes place . The third zone, already gaseous, is where

low-molecular-weight products formed in the two previous zones are mixed
with heated air and are decomposed or oxidized by oxygen or by radicals
coming out of the flame. The fourth zone begins where a concentration of
degradation products is sufficient for the flame to grow and where most of the
thermal energy is released. This is where the temperature reaches its maximum
value and where light radiation is created. The fifth zone is where combustion
products are concentrated; it is also called the postcombustion zone, since this
is where oxidation reactions terminate. The thermal energy produced in this
zone and that produced in the fourth zone, together with the light radiations,
are responsible for the degradation induced in the inner part of the polymer not
already touched by the flame.
There are many methods used to determine plastic flammability, but the
limited oxygen index seems to be the most convenient one [7-10]. This test
(ASTM D-2863) is made in a very simple way by burning a small rod of a plastic
material in a Pyrex tube in the presence of oxygen and nitrogen. The tubing is
connected to flowmeters and the minimum volume of oxygen mixed with a
given volume of nitrogen necessary to maintain the combustion of the sample is
determined. The limited oxygen index is defined by
This means that polymer flammability decreases when LOI increases. This
method is also used to test the efficiency of flame retardants, but it is necessary
to mention the direction of gas flow while testing (i.e., if the gases are coming
from above or below the burning sample) [II]. Relative flammabilities as deter-
mined by LOI do not always agree with results from other tests ; it is thus
necessary to know these results for a good evaluation of the flammability of
plastic materials. Table 12.2 shows that there is no direct relation between LOI
and the enthalpy or heat content for some polymers .

Burning Mechanisms of Plastics
12: Flame Retardants
Based on thermo-oxidation mechanism of polymers (see Section 10.1), it is
possible to say that macroradicals are formed on the surface of polymers ac-
cording to the following reactions [13-17]:
Initiation:
k,
"""RH + O2 ~ """RÂ· + 'OOH
Propagation:
k,
"""RÂ· + O2 ~ """ROOÂ·
"""ROOÂ· + R'H ~ ROOH + """R'Â·
In the case of polyolefins, it is possible to suppose that macroradicals react with
oxygen to form olefins in zone 3 at temperatures close to 400Â°C:
"""RÂ· + O2 ~ olefins + 'OOH
and eventually to form epoxide groups:
which are highly flammable. In this case oxygen consumption may become so
high in this flame zone that pyrolysis predominates over oxidation because of a
lack of oxygen [18]. Oxygen atoms present in the flame may react with olefins
to give carbenes [19]
which function as reactive transition states. Acetylene can be formed from
carbenes:
where .R""" is a new macroradical.
The combustion of methane can be used as a model for the combustion inhibi-
tion mechanism in the gaseous phase. This is a radical chain reaction proceed-
ing in a series of step reactions as follows [4]:

It is interesting to note that in spite of the prevalence of oxygen in these
reactions, it takes part in only one reaction, the branching of the chain reaction.
This corresponds to the mechanism proposed for degradation of polymers con-
taining C-C and/or C-H bonds [3,20]:

The radicals that play an important role in the propagation reaction are HÂ· and
HOÂ·. Substances that decrease their concentration and increase the rate of the
termination step are retardants or inhibitors for the combustion reactions. Solid
particles may be produced by the combustion, and their presence in the gas
phase can partly reduce the activation energy for the oxidative process by the
so-called wall effect; thus larger amounts of the less active HOO' radicals are
produced [3].
Molecular oxygen plays an important role only in side reactions where two
radicals are produced from a single one and are responsible for the explosive
character of combustion.

206

Burning of polyolefins and mainly of polymers containing heteroatoms in
their chain is a more complicated process, and a detailed description of its
mechanism is beyond the scope of this chapter [1,21-23].
U.3
Classification of Flame-Retardant Agents
Enough experimental results have been obtained on burning of plastics to es-
tablish the following observations on how to improve flame retardancy of a
plastic material [23]:
I. To decrease the concentration of hydrocarbon sequences by diluting the
polymer (e.g., with fillers).
2. To decrease the concentration of oxygen or to limit its access to the polymer
with the use of nonflammable coatings, oxygen-consuming additives, or
carbonization additives.
3. To eliminate the heat in the combustion zone by
a. Inert gases or fillers.
b. Additives capable of endothermic reactions such as dehydration, dehy-
drochlorination, decarboxylation, etc.
c. Reduction of the fusion temperature of the system or the melt viscosity
of the polymer.
d. Increase in the heat conductivity of the plastic material.
4. To decrease the concentration of flammable monomers produced by depol-
ymerization (styrene, methyl methacrylate) by
a. Reduction in the rate of pyrolysis (as in items 3b and 3c).
b. The reactions of monomer on double bonds to form stable addition com-
pounds or by a cross-linking reaction.
5. To inhibit the propagation of chain reactions by elimination of atomic oxy-
gen and active radicals by
a. Recombination reactions in the presence of catalysts.
b. The action of flame retardants that produce less active particles.
6. To eliminate carbenes by
a. Catalyzed termination reactions.
b. The action of flame retardants.
Flame retardants are defined as chemical compounds that modify pyrolysis
reactions of polymers or oxidation reactions implied in the combustion by
slowing them down or by inhibiting them. In practical applications, mixtures of
flame retardants are used to combine different types of retardancy effects .
In spite of the few thousands of references on flame retardants, only a small
number of compounds are commercially produced as such. They are mainly
phosphorus, antimony, aluminum, and boron-containing compounds, chlo-

rides, and bromides [12,24-26]. Flame retardants containing lead, zinc, silicon,
zirconium, tin, bismuth, sulfur, and selenium are less common.
Most interesting flame retardant agents may be divided into the following
groups.
U.3.1
Agents Containing Phosphorus Derivatives
Phosphorus-containing flame retardants may be divided according to the oxida-
tion state of the element into phosphates Â«ROhPO), phosphites Â«ROhP), phos-
phonites Â«ROhPR'), phosphinates
Â«RO)R~PO), phosphine oxides (R3PO),
phosphines (R3P), and phosphonium salts (RxPX). It seems that compounds in
which phosphorus has the oxidation states - 3, -I, and 1 are the most efficient
[6]. These flame retardants function in the solid phase as well as in the gaseous
phase.
The generally accepted explanation of the flame-retarding action of phos-
phorus-containing substances is that the very stable poly(meta-phosphoric
acid) formed during the thermal decomposition of the plastic material creates
an insulating and protecting surface layer between the polymer and the flame
[27]. It has been found that the flame retardancy effect of these compounds
depends not only on their concentration but on the heat of their decomposition
reaction, which depends on their chemical structure. Compounds containing
phosphorus in the lowest oxidation state are the most efficient. The structural
effect is responsible for the fact that bromoalkyl phosphate with a bromine
atom bound to a secondary carbon of an alkyl substituent shows a better flame
retardancy.
The halogenated phosphorus-containing compounds represent a very impor-
tant group of flame retardants. The efficiency of some brominated derivatives is
shown in Table 12.3 [23]. A similar flame retardancy may be obtained by the
combinations of phosphorus-containing compounds with various halogen de-
rivatives. These combinations are relatively universal in their action. Phos-

phorus halides are formed that then react with 'OH, H' and O' radicals in the
gaseous phase:
PCh + 'OH ~ POCh + HÂ·
POCh + 2HÂ· ~ PCh + HzO
Subsequent hydrolysis produces PZ03 or H3P04â¢ When triphenyl phosphine
oxide is used , Pz', PO', POz', and small amounts of P: and HPO Â· are found in
zone 3 of the flame and can react with active radicals directly in that zone [28].
The synergetic effect of flame-retardant combinations containing phosphorus
and a halogen may still be increased by the reaction between degradation
products that are formed in the pyrolysis zone [29]. The HCI formed by the
decomposition of the halide
R-CI~ HCI + R'-CH=CHz
reacts with polyphosphoric acid

which is itself formed by the dehydration of phosphoric acid [30]
Phosphorus compounds as well as other currently used flame retardants
containing nitrogen, antimony, sulfur, etc. , have two unpaired electrons capa-
ble of reacting with carbenes to give more or less stable ylides
They can react with oxygenated products from the thermo-oxidative degrada-
tion of polymers to form unsaturated hydrocarbons

These flame retardants are suitable for polar polymers, but for polyolefins
their action is not sufficient. In this case they are used together with Sbz0 3 and
with halogenated compounds. Examples of the combinations mostly used are
the following: organic phosphites with halogen-containing compounds, phos-
phonitrile compounds with Sbz0 3 and with phosphates, and halogenated phos-

12.3.2
Halogen-Containing Agents
The efficiency of these agents depends on the strength of the carbon-halogen
bond. Relative efficiency of aliphatic halides decreases in the following succes-
sion:
Aliphatic bromides > aliphatic chlorides
= aromatic bromides > aromatic bromides
It is also known that aromatic bromides have a higher decomposition tempera-
ture (250-300Â°C) than aliphatic bromides (200-250Â°C) [23].
According to previous considerations, the rate of burning of a polymer de-
pends obviously on the rate of diffusion of oxygen in the flame and on the rate
of heat transfer from the flame to the polymer surface. The kinetics of exother-
mic reactions, of branching reactions, and of inhibition reactions taking place in
zone 3 of the flame also affect the rate of the combustion.
These reactions can be illustrated by the following simplified reaction steps
[31]:
Exothermic propagation reaction:
HO' + CO- CO2 + HÂ·
Chain branching reaction:
Inhibition reactions:
HO' + HX- H20 + XÂ·
XÂ· + HX -
HÂ· + X2
2HÂ· -
H2
Regeneration reaction:
RH + XÂ· -
RÂ· + HX
The role of the halide is to make the inhibition reaction possible by reducing its
activation energy below that of the propagation reaction. The halide reacts with
highly active free radicals to form combustion products of much less reactivity
and halide radicals that can regenerate active halide. The rate of the regenera-

tion reaction is very important for the efficiency of the inhibition reactions; it
decreases with the nature of the halogen in the following way [32]:
HI > HBr > Hel > HF
However, alkyl iodides are very unstable as polymer flame retardants and
fluoride radicals are so reactive that they produce hydrogen radicals:
FÂ· + H2 -
HF + HÂ·
The hydrogen radicals are themselves too reactive to function as inhibitors. So
only organic bromides and chlorides are generally used as flame retardants.
Their efficiency depends on the ease of formation of hydrogen halide.
The efficiency of these compounds depends also on their chemical structure.
For instance, it is easier to break a carbon-halide bond from a ternary carbon
than from a primary carbon, but this difference decreases as temperature in-
creases. Furthermore, dehydrochlorination is possible only when the carbon
next to the carbon-chlorine bond carries a hydrogen atom. The rate of the
dehydrohalogenation is larger when more than one halogen atom is bound to
the same carbon but when two neighboring carbons carry one halogen on each
of them, the rate of this reaction is lower [33].
A relative comparison between hydrobromic acid, hydrochloric acid, bro-
mine, and chlorine as flame retardants for PP is given in Table 12.4; the effect of
the nature of the halogen on the flame retardancy speaks for itself.
The efficiency of halides increases when they are mixed with peroxides
(mainly bromides) or with Sb20 3 (mainly chlorides). But the synergetic effect of
these mixtures is always specific to a given type of polymer. For example, the
bromide-peroxide mixture is used for PS, whereas the chloride-Sb-O, pair is
used for polyolefins [35]. The bromide-Sb-O, combination also shows a syner-
getic effect in some cases [36].
12.3.3
Agents Containing Antimony Oxide
Antimony oxide is a basic compound in most retardant systems. Used alone, its
flame retardancy is not sufficient, but, as was mentioned in the previous sec-

12.3: Classification of Flame-Retardant Agents
211
tion, when combined with halides, mainly chlorides, it forms synergetic mix-
tures of high efficiency [7]. Experimental results indicate that the best Sb :CI
ratio is 1 to 3. More effective are ternary synergetic mixtures such as Sb203-
pentabromotoluene-chloroparaffin.
The antimony oxide-alkyl(aryl) chloride system functions on heating ac-
cording to the following mechanism [7]:
RCI- HCI + R'CH=CH2
Sb203 + 6HCI -
2SbCh + 3H20
Sb203 + 2HCI -
2SbOCI + H20
Volatile SbCh reduces the formation of radicals in the flame and also affects
strongly the oxidation process that terminates the combustion. As with phos-
phorus compounds, it promotes carbonization of the polymer. It is believed
that SbOCl and SbCh already function as dehydrogenation agents in the solid
phase of the polymer in flame. Then SbOCl is transformed in oxychlorides and
SbCh is liberated:

The flame retardancy is also due to the consumption of thermal energy by these
endothermic reactions, to the inhibition of the reactions in the flame by the wall
effect, and to the release of hydrochloric acid directly in the flame. The use of
antimony sulfide and of its modified oxides is also recommended for the same
reasons. The pigmentation effect of mixtures containing Sb203 limits their use
for light-colored and transparent products [12].
12.3.4
Special Fire Retardants
Some inorganic compounds [NaHC03, Pb(C2Hs) 4, Fe(CO)s , SbCh, and the
phosphorus compounds already mentioned, for example] have a great retar-
dancy effect. It is believed that they are reduced to metals or they decompose
into metal oxides in situ and function as heterogeneous catalysts of radical
recombination reactions in the gas phase:
HÂ· + 'OH + Me- H20 + Me*
A part of the thermal energy is used to create new chemical bonds. In the case
of NaHC03 the efficiency is larger than expected; in addition to the dilution
effect by the CO2 produced from its decomposition, it is believed that the
NaOH formed functions as a catalyst for the elimination of active HÂ· and 'OH
radicals [4]:

212
NaOH + HÂ· --+ H 20 + Na-
Na- + HO' --+ NaOH
12: Flame Retardants
The dilution effect also happens in certain mixtures of inorganic salts that
decompose into nonflammable gases above 200Â°C. They are mixtures of phos-
phates and metal silicates (zinc, titanium, and other metals). For example, the
ZnC03- NH4Br system decomposes according to the following reaction:
Easily dehydrohalogenated or dehydrated compounds, such as hydrated
oxides, reduce the formation of flammable products by the endothermic effect
that accompanies their transformation. Examples are Ah03 . 3H20 used for
epoxy resins [37] and mainly hydrated aluminum hydroxides [12]. They are
cheap in cost but their low efficiency, compared to halides, necessitates that a
large quantity (50-80% by weight) be used, and this affects the properties of
plastic materials. In spite of this , aluminum hydroxides represent about 50% of
all flame retardants used in the United States, the rest being made of Sbz03,
bromine and chlorine compounds, phosphates, and phosphorus-halide com-
pounds [38].
Many other compounds of less importance function as flame retardants by
producing inert diluting gases at elevated temperature or insulating foamed
cushions or layers; examples are starch, paraformaldehyde, dicyanodiamide,
aminoacetic acid, salicylic acid, pentaerythritol benzenesulfonylhydrazide,
urea, carbonates, some foaming agents, zinc and calcium borates, (NH4h B0 4 ,
and (NH4)4 B20S [3].
It is interesting to note that cotton-based products can be treated against
combustion by boron- or phosphorus-containing products that function as cata-
lysts for the endothermic dehydration reaction of cellulose [4]:

It is also possible to protect polymers by flame-retarding coatings or var-
nishes. The nonflammability of the coating depends also on the presence of
other substances, such as solvents and plasticizers.
In some polymers the action of the flame retardant may be fulfilled by the
plasticizers listed in Table 12.5 [39].

12.3.5
General Classification of Fire Retardants and Their Choice
It is possible to classify flame or fire retardants into two groups:
1. Those permanently fixed in polymer structures, also called reactive types,
such as tetrabromodienes, pentabromophenol, hexabromophthalic anhy-
drides, polyols containing phosphorus, and halides . They are used mainly
for polyesters, polyurethanes, and epoxy resins .
2. Those added to polymers and not reacting with them during processing. This
is the case for most of the flame retardants. They are used for polyolefins,
PVC, PVA, PVAL, PS and its copolymers, etc.
When the efficiency of different flame retardants is compared, phosphorus
compounds are better than those containing antimony, chlorine, and bromine.
The most efficient are the synergetic mixtures of phosphorus and bromine-
containing compounds; the bromine content can be decreased by adding an
antimony compound, as shown in Table 12.6 [40].
The selection of flame retardants must be done with great care , since they
often affect polymer properties such as melt viscosity, light stability (which is
affected by the presence of bromine), heat stability, and other physical proper-
ties. Their choice is also affected by the processing temperature of polymers.
They must stand high temperatures without being seriously affected . In this
case a better flame retardant or a higher quantity of such a compound must be
used [41]. The amount of the flame retardant required for a given polymer is
determined by the flame temperature of the polymer. For this reason, a larger
quantity of flame retardant is used for PE than for PP because the flame temper-
ature of PE is higher [22].
The affinity offlame retardants to polymers is also important. For instance, a
high degree of crystallinity decreases the affinity of a polymer to flame retar-

dants and they may exude from the polymer matrix. Toxicity of flame retar-
dants and of their combustion products is also a major factor in their selection
[42-46]. Flame retardancy is a rather complicated phenomenon and the effect
of flame retardants depends on the fire conditions [38]. Here are some examples
of flame retardants recommended for well-known polymers:
I. Polyolefins:
a. Mixture sofsolid chloroparaffins and Sb203 with a ratioofSb : CI == I : 3.
b. Mixture s of cyclic organic halides and S~03'
c. Mixtures of organic halides and phosphorus-containing organic com-
pounds.
d. Mixtures of Sb203 and hexabromobenzene, decabromobenzene, penta-
bromodiphenylether, tetrabromo-bisphenol A, or tetrabromophthalic
anhydride.
e. Aluminum hydroxides.
2. Polypropylene fibers: brornopentaerythriol phosphate and bromophenol
phosphate-Sandoflam PU (Sandoz, Switzerland).
3. Plasticized PVC: phosphate plasticizers, liquid chloroparaffins, and Sb203â¢
4. PVA, PVAL: phosphate plasticizers, chloroparaffins, copolymers with a
monomer containing phosphorus.
5. PS and copolymers: synergetic mixtures ofbrominated compounds and per-
oxides , terpolymers with a monomer containing a halogen.
6. Polyesters: hexabromophthalic anhydride, tetrabromodienes, pentabromo-
phenol, dialkyl tetrabromophthalate, organophosphate plasticizers , most
of the inorganic fillers.
7. Polyurethanes: polyols containing a halogen, phosphorus compounds, and
both phosphorus and halogen, organophosphates.
8. Epoxy resins : tetrabromodienes alone or combined with organophosphates.
Selected flame-retardant additives are detailed in Ref. 47.

Biocides Against Biological Degradation
of Plastics
13.1
Microbiological Degradation
Biodegradation of polymers refers to the degradation and assimilation of or-
ganic polymers by living organisms, principally microorganisms such as fungi,
bacteria, and actinomycetes [1]. This microbiological corrosion of plastics is
very frequent and very difficult to prevent [2-4]. Some plastic materials are
degraded by organisms not only under a tropical climate but also under oceanic
and continental climates. Such is the case for plasticized PVC, PVAL plasti-
cized by glycerol and its derivatives, filled phenolic resins, and polycaprolac-
tone and its derivatives [1]. Biopolymers (cellulose, starch, polypeptides, cello-
phane, etc. [5])are easily microbiologically degraded. Synthetic polymers are
generally more resistant to this type of degradation, and their resistance in-
creases with molecular weight. PE provides a typical example, as shown in
Table 13.1 [1]. Polymers become more sensitive to microbiological degradation
when they have already begun to degrade by UV radiation effects that produce
chain scission. When a polymer becomes powdered, its surface increases
manyfold and microbiological degradation may follow [7].
The resistance of most synthetic polymers to biodegradation causes serious
problems from the point of view of environmental protection , and intensive
research in this fieldhas been undertaken [8]. The tendency of a plastic material
toward biodegradation depends on the following items:
1. The structure of the material, i.e., its content of carbon, nitrogen, and other
biogenetic elements that are responsible for its behavior toward microorga-
nisms.
2. The conditions and the environment in which the material is utilized.

This type of degradation is induced by metabolites, eventually enzymes,
produced by microorganisms. They attack the surface of plastics, and in films
and sheets, they may go through the materials. Most microorganisms affect
only plasticizers, emulsion residues, or fillers in plastics [9]. For example, a
sheet of PVC plasticized with dibutyl sebacate becomes brittle because of
corrosion by mycelia. Among all plasticizers, fatty acid esters, such as oleates,
ricinoleates , stearates, and laurates, are the most sensitive to biodegradation.
Esters and salts of maleic, phthalic, and phoshoric acids are more resistant.
The resistance decreases with the increasing number of carbon atoms in the
acid, but alcohols with short carbon chains produced by the hydrolysis ofthese
esters inhibit the bacterial attack [2,3]. Stearic acid-based heat stabilizers offer
good media for microorganism development.
Many synthetic polymers are entirely resistant to microbiological attack;
examples are PMMA, PAN, CA, unfilled phenolic resins, PE, rigid PVC, PIB,
and silicone rubber. On the other hand, polyamides, PVC, polycaprolactam,
PVAL, cellulose, cellulose nitrate, natural rubber, and polycaprolactone are
sensitive to fungi degradation [10]. Microbiological degradation ofbiopolymers
(starch, cellulose, gelatin, etc.) is well known [8] and the problem ofbiodegrad-
able polymers is very important, especially for those intended for medical
applications [11-13].

Some Examples of Biocides
Algae, fungi, bacteria, and yeast microorganisms responsible for biodeteriora-
tion of organic materials are distributed in the air, soil, and water. Biocides are
preservatives used to stop their proliferation. All biocides derive their activity
through interference with essential cell metabolic processes. Surface-active
agents, such as quaternary ammonium compounds, are thought to disrupt cell

of plastic materials against microbiological degradation is above all necessary
in tropical climates, especially when these materials contain biodegradable
additives.
Biocides are necessary to achieve complete protection in a highly plasticized
flexible system, such as a PVC composition that will be exposed to moisture
and weathering. The commercially available antimicrobials given in Table 13.2
[14] are registered with the Environmental Protection Agency (U.S.). They
generally have demonstrated affinity to existing plastic formations, stability
under conditions of heat up to 190Â°C, and effectiveness in controlling growth of
fungi and bacteria associated with deterioration and disfigurement of plastic
products. Copper 8-hydroxy-quinolate, which is nontoxic to humans , and
phenyl mercury salicylate, which is very toxic but highly effective, are widely
used biocides, but they are corrosive to some metals [2,3]. Other commercially
available biocides, beside those given in Tables 13.2 and 13.3 [15], are N-
trichloromethylthiotetrahydrophthalamide
(Phthaltan),
2-n-octyl-4-isothia-
zoline-3-one, the p-hydrobenzoic ester of paraben, quaternary ammonium
naphthanate salts, and tributylin oxide [4].
Biocides are added as formulation ingredients during mixing and blending
operations. In a recent innovation the biocide has been formulated as a pellet in
a polymer matrix.

13.3
Protection Against Macrobiological Depreciation
Plastic products are sometimes attacked by rodents and insects, mainly ter-
mites. Products usually degraded are cables and building materials. Protection
against this type of deterioration is very difficultto accomplish. Fillers harmful
to rodents can be used; they are mainly glass fibers. Emetics can also be used.
Protection against termites can only be realized by using coatings or sheathings
containing such materials as metals or glass that are resistant to their attack.

Brief Survey of Methods Used to
Incorporate Additives into Polymer
Matrices
As was mentioned in previous chapters, plastics are usually processed with the
aid of additives that modify their properties and their behavior during process-
ing and practical applications. Homogenization of these substances with poly-
mers is a very important part of processing technology for the preparation of
intermediate products such as granules, agglomerates, pellets, and sheets. This
facilitates the final transformation process or increases their output.
Mixing plays an important role in the preparation and processing of plastics
compositions. The output of the processing machines and the quality of the
final products depend on the good quality and the good use of these machines.
Processing efficiency improves when (a) shear forces are optimized (i.e., when
mixed materials are solid); (b) mixing is done in a small volume; (c) dead spaces
are avoided [1]. It must be recalled that mixing and blending in industrial
production machines need more time than in laboratory machines.
It is possible to divide mixing processes by the physical state of the mixed
substances and the energy consumption for the dry, liquid, viscous, elastoplas-
tic, and rubbery states. See Table 14.1.
14.1
Mixing
Powdered or liquid polymers and additives are, from an energy standpoint, the
cheapest to mix. The specific energy consumption varies from 35 to 80 kJ kg-I
to mix dry powdered or liquid substances. The simplest mixers for dry constitu-
ents are the plowshare blades drum mixer (Fig. 14.1), V-shaped tumbling mixer
(Fig. 14.2), and twin V-shaped tumbling mixer (Fig. 14.3). It is possible to
improve the mixing efficiency of these machines by modifying the shape of the
blades, by changing the shape of the stirrer, and by adding baffles in the mixer.

lethe constituents need to be mutually crushed or pulverized, the mixing can be
done in conical ball mills (Fig. 14.4);they produce homogeneous mixtures , but
they consume energy. They are used for good homogenization of pigmented
plastics, mainly for the preparation of master batches intended for the produc-
tion of varnishes or plastisols. For viscous or liquid or wet materials" sigma-
blade mixers or high-speed vertical planetary mixers (Fig. 14.5) can be used.

For highly viscous blends, the mixer needs to have a higher shear efficiency
or to be heated at higher temperatures. In this case, the energy consumption is
close to 100 kJ kg:". Mixing or pulverization of pigments needs machines
equipped with a friction blade; mixing powders with liquids is done in tur-
bomixers (Fig. 14.6).
14.2
Conglomeration
Preparation of agglomerates, mainly powdered PVC dry blends, is done to
accelerate and to facilitate gelation and plasticization processes during plastics
processing. Agglomerates are prepared in fluidized bed turbo mixers such as the
Henschl or Anker types. In these machines powdered PVC is mixed in a
fluidized state at high temperature with plasticizers, stabilizers, pigments, or
lubricants (above 100Â°C for dry blends and close to 160Â°C for plasticized
blends). The fluidized state is obtained with turbomixers (Fix. 14.7) having a
rotor linear speed of 40-60 m sec:". Figure 14.8 shows the curves giving the
temperature changes in a turbomixer for a blend of 68% by weight of PVC and
32% of a plasticizer. The power of the mixer as a function of time at different
steps of the mixing process is given in Fig. 14.9. The power and the tempera-
ture settings of turbomixers depend on the nature of PVC and on the plasticizer
concentration. These factors determine the type of resulting agglomerate. For
instance, a mixture of emulsion polymerized PVC with a maximum plasticizer
content of 30% by weight produces a dry powdered blend. For a higher plasti-
cizer content, more or less fine agglomerates with a particle size of about 4 mm
are obtained [5]. In both cases, PVC is pregelled, allowing the output of the
transformation machines (extruder, injection press , etc.) to be increased.

14: Methods Used to Incorporate Additives into Polymer Matrices
Henschel-type turbomixers presently used are suitable to blend powders,
liquids , and pastes; they are also used for thickening, agglomeration, drying,
degassing, solubilization, melting, and preparation of coloring concentrates.
They are used for cold or hot blending and as universal blenders. The standard
models for fluidized bed mixing have capacities of 10-1500 liters [6].
14.3
Kneading and Internal Mixing
Homogenization of plasticizer or solvent-free plastics (plastication) demands
high shear forces. It is accomplished by internal melt mixing to eliminate phase
boundaries between polymer particles, zones of different densities, and internal
stresses. This problem is very important mainly in mixing PVC paste-making
resin which has a surface specially treated at high temperature for a better
resistance to plasticizers [7]. The plastication is then slightly more difficult to
realize; PVC dry blends allow the use of faster processes for their transfor-
mation.
Plastication by kneading is done in variable shear roll mixers, in rotor mixers
of the Banbury or Werner-Pfleiderer type , or in twin-screw extruders or in
special mixers. Plastication made in two-roll mixers is not economical and it is
used mainly for batch production or to mix substances of different natures. For
continuous line production, single or twin-screw extruders or a Buss KO-
Kneader are used. These mixers or extruders operate in a friction mode; this
friction is obtained by a horizontal backward and forward motion of the screw.
The screw may have threads or flights of regular width or of larger width and
slantly cut in the rotational direction (see Fig. 14.10). Homogenization in these
machines is so efficient that even fish-eyes present in PE and suspension poly-
merized PVC can be disaggregated [8].
Energy consumption for plastication is essentially lower than that needed to
mix rubber formulations (see Table 14.1). The transformation energy for rigid
PVC is 700 kJ kg- 1 as compared to 1700 kJ kg- 1 for rubbers, and three-quarters
of this last quantity is used for homogenization. The output of mixing machines
is larger for plastics than for rubbers. For example, Fig. 14.11 gives the output
for the KO-Kneader as a function of the screw diameter during the preparation
of PVC or rubber mixtures.
The quality of the homogenization also depends on the mixing time, and in
extruders, it increases with the length-to-diameter ratio of the machine. A good
plastication is of prime importance in the first step of plastics processing, since
any further transformation may not be so effective that it produces homogeni-
zation of an acceptable quality.

Homogenization of polymers and plasticizers or gelation (plasticization) has
already been discussed in Sections 1.2 and 1.3.
14.4
Granulation, Pelleting, and Tableting
Granulation and pelleting of plastics are realized in special machines. Granula-
tion machines are extruders (mainly twin-screw types), kneaders, etc.,
equipped with a die-face cutter. The advantages of granules are the following:
They facilitate storage and transport.
They are easily fed to processing machines .
They make product coloration more uniform.
They make the use of plastic materials possible for small industries that are
not equipped with basic processing machines (e.g., manufactures of
shoes, bottles, cables).
The shape of granules is important [5]. They must have a large surface area
and a small dead volume. The lenticular shape (1-2 mm) is advantageous, since

228
14: Methods Used to Incorporate Additives into Polymer Matrices
it facilitates good heat transfer and adhesion to the extruder screw. The friction
effect that is responsible for good homogenization in processing machines de-
creases when granules become too fine and when their dead volume becomes
too important.
Pelleting is advantageous mainly for phenoplast and aminoplast molding
powders . A moldingpowder is a mixture of resin, filler, lubricant, and pigment.
In the case of novolac molding powder, hexamethylene tetramine is added as a
resin hardening agent. All these constituents must be well dispersed in the
powder. Dry blending is used for powdered additives and wet blending is used
for chipped or flaky additives:
Dry Blending.
Phenol-formaldehyde resin still in its resole thermoplastic state
is cold-pulverized and then perfectly mixed with fillers and other additives in a
two-roll mill heated 80-1 15Â°C. Once homogenized, the blend stays on the
warmer roll. It is then possible to cut it, since during homogenization, resin
condensation continues going partially from resole to resite, and this forms a
cohesive layer. Once cold, the blend can be pulverized.
Wet Blending .
Filler is impregnated with an aqueous emulsion or a solution of
the resin (usually in a mixture of methanol and ethanol). After evaporation of
the liquid phase, the blend is dried and reduced to powder.
Needed quantities of molding powder are measured directly in the mold.
Pelleting is done in automatic pelleting machines for light materials. Pellets
generally are cylindrical, but special molds for pelleting fibrous materials are
designed to produce prismatic pellets by pressing the materials in three rectan-
gular directions.
Pellets offer many advantages. They can be produced with defined shapes
and weights and dead space is reduced to a minimum. Degassing in the mold is
not necessary, and this is very important in the production of small objects.
Pellets permit the size of the melting chamber to be reduced and enable the use
of high-frequency preheating.
