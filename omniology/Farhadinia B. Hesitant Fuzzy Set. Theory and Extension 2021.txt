Preface
Hesitant fuzzy set has moved beyond its infancy and is now entering a maturing
phase with increased numbers and types of extensions. Up to now, the existing
extensions of hesitant fuzzy set have been encountering an increasing interest and
attracting more and more attentions. It is not an exaggeration if it is said that the
recent decade has seen the blossoming of a larger set of techniques and theoretical
outcomes for hesitant fuzzy sets and their extensions as well as applications.
Inevitably, researches on hesitant fuzzy set and its extensions have inspired
a huge amount of publications, including a considerable number of high-impact
journal contributions, numerous edited volumes, and monographs. This is while, in
spite of the existence of many good monographs, creating a comprehensive book
that covers and introduces all kinds of exiting extensions of hesitant fuzzy sets in a
uniﬁed framework has remained a little neglected or ignored. Thus, it is becoming
more and more necessary to gather and provide an organized and rather uniﬁed view
of these extensions and their key notions, with reference to the relevant literature.
According to the feedback from several experts and based on my own experience
gained through the past ten years, the main motivation of writing this book is to
provide the students, scholars, and interested readers with a monograph that covers
all kinds of exiting hesitant fuzzy extensions in a uniﬁed scheme. Further, I hope that
this all-encompassing reference book enables scientists and engineers to understand
the central aspects of hesitant fuzzy extensions.
This book gives preliminary, but fundamental, information that may be useful
for a better understanding of hesitant fuzzy extensions in a uniﬁed framework. The
current book is organized into twelve chapters that deal with twelve different but
related issues, which are listed as follows:
Chapter 1 provides the readers with further background on hesitant fuzzy set as
the core concept of this book, and fundamental information bases for the study of
direct generalized forms of hesitant fuzzy set. In this regard, the basic operational
laws, fundamental deﬁnitions, basic operations, different kinds of negations, S-
norms, and T-norms together with two kinds of ordering techniques for hesitant
fuzzy sets are presented in the ﬁrst section of this chapter. The other section
of this chapter deals with the direct extensions of hesitant fuzzy sets just by

Preface
representing their basic concepts in brief together with their corresponding set
or algebraic operations. Most popular among these direct generalizations are the
hesitant triangular fuzzy set, interval-valued hesitant fuzzy set, extended hesitant
fuzzy set, higher order of hesitant fuzzy set, dual hesitant fuzzy set, dual hesitant
triangular fuzzy set, and interval-valued dual hesitant fuzzy set.
Chapter 2, in the ﬁrst section, initially introduces the concept of hesitant fuzzy
linguistic term set that reﬂects the inconsistency and uncertainty of experts. Then,
the extended form of hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set, namely extended hesitant
fuzzy linguistic term set, is re-stated and a number of its operations are reviewed.
In the sequel, the interval-valued hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set is taken into
consideration in the third section. In the ﬁfth and fourth sections, the concepts of
proportional hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set and hesitant fuzzy uncertain linguistic
set are, respectively, addressed. The concept of dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic term
set, which allows us to take much more information into account, is reviewed in
the sixth section. Two other generalized forms of hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set,
which are known as dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic triangular set and interval-valued
dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic set, are the issues that lie at the end arguments in this
chapter.
Chapter 3 is devoted to introducing brieﬂy the concept of neutrosophic set in
the ﬁrst section. Subsequently, the concept of single-valued neutrosophic hesitant
fuzzy set, which is refereed here to as neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set, is addressed
in the second section. In the sequel, it is going to argue about the concept of interval
neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set. Although there may be reported some other kinds
of neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set by different researchers, the aforementioned two
types of neutrosophic-based hesitant fuzzy sets are enough to fully understand the
other kinds.
Chapter 4 focuses on Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy set in the ﬁrst section. Next, in
order to put forward the issues and concepts described in this chapter, an overall
view of interval-valued form of Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy set is given in the
second section. The last concept that is needed for the complete characterization
of Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy set is that examined here as the dual Pythagorean
hesitant fuzzy set.
Chapter 5 deals with q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy set in its ﬁrst section. The
concept of interval-valued q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy set is the next issue that
will be put forward in the second section of this chapter. The last concept, which is
needed for the complete characterization of q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy set, is
the dual q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy set.
Chapter 6, in the ﬁrst section, presents the core of the next concepts, known as
probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set. Then, the dual form of probabilistic hesitant fuzzy
sets is given in the second section. The third section of this chapter is dedicated to
introduce the notion of occurring probability of possible values into hesitant fuzzy
linguistic term set and deﬁne probabilistic linguistic hesitant fuzzy set. Keeping
the implication of probabilistic linguistic term set in mind, it is concerned in the
fourth section with the deﬁnition of probabilistic linguistic dual hesitant fuzzy set
by combining probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy set with dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic

term set. In the later sections, the other generalizations of probabilistic hesitant fuzzy
set, namely interval probabilistic hesitant fuzzy linguistic variable, probabilistic
neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set, Pythagorean probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set, and
q-rung orthopair probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set, will be introduced, and some of
their corresponding operations will be given.
Chapter 7 focuses ﬁrstly on the notion of type 2 hesitant fuzzy set. Then, the
interval-valued type 2 hesitant fuzzy set, which is also known as interval type 2
hesitant fuzzy set, will be given in the last section of this chapter.
Chapter 8 provides the interested reader with the concept of hesitant bipolar
fuzzy set in the ﬁrst section. The second section deals with the concept of hesitant
bipolar-valued fuzzy set that comes from bipolar concept, and it is stated more
or less different from the concept of hesitant bipolar fuzzy set. In the subsequent
section of this chapter, the concept of hesitant bipolar-valued neutrosophic set will
be addressed.
Chapter 9 introduces the concept of cubic hesitant fuzzy set and then presents
the form in which cubic hesitant fuzzy set is characterized in the form of triangle,
and hence it is known as triangular cubic hesitant fuzzy set. In the next section of
this chapter, the deﬁnition of linguistic intuitionistic cubic hesitant variable will be
stated.
Chapter 10 includes a study of complex hesitant fuzzy set together with complex
dual hesitant fuzzy set. This chapter contains the basic key points of complex dual
type 2 hesitant fuzzy set.
Chapter 11 presents the concept of picture hesitant fuzzy set and, then, introduces
the concept of interval-valued picture hesitant fuzzy set. The last section of this
chapter is devoted to presenting the concept of dual picture hesitant fuzzy set.
Chapter 12 focuses on the concept of spherical hesitant fuzzy set as a generaliza-
tion of both picture hesitant fuzzy set and Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy set for dealing
with fuzziness and uncertainty information. In the sequel, a generalized form of
spherical hesitant fuzzy set, known as T-spherical hesitant fuzzy set, will be given.
In this book, an attempt to review the researches previously conducted on
the latest baselines of hesitant fuzzy sets and their extensions is made in order
for helping the interested researchers and practitioners get informed about the
fundamental concepts and also the corresponding references on the relevant research
in this ﬁeld.

Chapter 1
Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Abstract In this chapter, we ﬁrst introduce the core concept of this book, known
as the concept of hesitant fuzzy set. By providing the reader with the next part of
the book, we are going to look at the basic topics of hesitant fuzzy sets, including
fundamental deﬁnitions, basic operations, different kinds of negations, S-norms and
T-norms together with two kinds of ordering techniques for hesitant fuzzy sets.
In the sequel, we deal with a class of direct generalizations of hesitant fuzzy set,
just by representing their concepts brieﬂy together with their corresponding set
or algebraic operations. Most popular among these direct generalizations are the
hesitant triangular fuzzy set, interval-valued hesitant fuzzy set, extended hesitant
fuzzy set, higher order of hesitant fuzzy set, dual hesitant fuzzy set, dual hesitant
triangular fuzzy set, and interval-valued dual hesitant fuzzy set.
1.1
Hesitant Fuzzy Set
In the case where different sources of vagueness appear simultaneously, the
concept of fuzzy set [58] is not able to properly model the uncertainty,
imprecise, and vague information. In order to overcome such a limitation,
different type of extensions of fuzzy set have been introduced in the literature.
Among such extensions, we may mention the intuitionistic fuzzy set [3]
allowing to be considered simultaneously the membership degree and the non-
membership degree of each element, type-2 fuzzy set [11] incorporating the
concept of uncertainty in the deﬁnition of membership function where a fuzzy
set over [0, 1] is used to model it, interval-valued fuzzy set [48] assigning to
each element a closed subinterval of [0, 1] as the membership degree of that
element, fuzzy multiset [38] being based on multiset with possibly repeated
elements.

Hesitant Fuzzy Set
However, a more widely and frequently used concept of fuzzy extensions is
hesitant fuzzy set which is introduced by Torra [47] for modelling a situation
of decision making in which an expert might consider different degrees of
membership of an element in a set.
Among the pioneer researchers, who provided a broad conceptualization
and application of hesitant fuzzy set and was followed by different researchers
on the area later, were Torra [47], Xu [52], Herrera [44], Wei [50], Liao [35],
and Farhadinia [13].
A HFS is semantically described by a function that returns a set of membership
degrees for any element in the domain, and it is given as below.
Deﬁnition 1.1 ([47]) Let X be a reference set. A hesitant fuzzy set (HFS) on X is
described by the function
A : X →℘([0, 1]),
(1.1)
which returns a non-empty subset of values in [0, 1].
Here, the notation of ℘([0, 1]) indicates the non-empty subset of values in [0, 1].
Remark 1.1 Throughout this book, the set of all HFSs on the reference set X is
denoted by HFS(X).
However, Xia and Xu [54] put forwarded the seminal deﬁnition of HFS with the
following easier mathematical representation:
Deﬁnition 1.2 ([54]) Let X be a ﬁxed reference set. A HFS on X is deﬁned in terms
of a function from X to a subset of [0, 1] which is characterized by
A = {⟨x, hA(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(1.2)
in which hA(x) is called a hesitant fuzzy element (HFE) and it denotes a set of
some values in [0, 1]. Moreover, the HFE hA(x) stands for the possible membership
degrees of the element x ∈X to the set A.
Based on the above notation, we easily ﬁnd that the HFS A = 
x∈X{hA(x)} can
be deﬁned in terms of a set of all HFEs of A in which the HFEs is considered with
ﬁnite number of elements [5].
Example 1.1 If X = {x1, x2, x3} is the reference set, hA(x1) = {0.2, 0.5, 0.6},
hA(x2) = {0.1, 0.4}, and hA(x3) = {0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.7} are the HFEs of xi (i =
1, 2, 3) to a set A, respectively. Then A can be considered as a HFS, i.e.,
A = {⟨x1, {0.2, 0.5, 0.6}⟩, ⟨x2, {0.1, 0.4}⟩, ⟨x3, {0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.7}⟩}.

1.1
Hesitant Fuzzy Set

Taking the reference set X into account, the following HFEs are known as the special
HFEs:
•
Empty set: h(x) = {0} ≜O∗;
•
Full set: h(x) = {1} ≜I ∗;
•
Complete ignorance: h(x) = [0, 1] ≜U∗;
•
Nonsense set: h(x) = { } ≜∅∗.
In order to deal with HFEs, Torra [47] introduced initially several basic opera-
tions as the following:
Deﬁnition 1.3 ([47]) Let hA be a HFE, its complement is deﬁned as:
hc
A =

γA∈hA
{1 −γA}.
(1.3)
Deﬁnition 1.4 ([47]) Let hA1 and hA2 be two HFEs, their union and intersection
are, respectively, deﬁned as follows:
hA1 ∪hA2 =

γA1∈hA1,γA2∈hA2
max{γA1, γA2},
(1.4)
hA1 ∩hA2 =

γA1∈hA1,γA2∈hA2
min{γA1, γA2}.
(1.5)
From a mathematical point of view, a HFE can be seen as the other well-known
extensions of fuzzy sets where for any x ∈X:
•
If hA(x) = {γA} with γA ∈[0, 1], then the HFE hA(x) is a fuzzy set;
•
If hA(x) = {γ 1
A, γ 2
A, . . . , γ n
A} ⊆[0, 1] with γ i
A ̸= γ j
A for i ̸= j, then the HFE
hA(x) is a multiset in which every membership is different from each other [4];
•
If hA(x) = [hA(x), hA(x)] ⊆[0, 1], then the HFE hA(x) is an interval-valued
fuzzy set [48];
•
If hA(x) = [hA(x), hA(x)] ⊆[0, 1], then by considering the mathematical
equivalence between interval-valued fuzzy sets and intuitionistic fuzzy sets [54],
the HFE hA(x) is an intuitionistic fuzzy set.
For three HFEs hA, hA1, and hA2, Xia and Xu [53] re-deﬁned the following HFE
arithmetic operations:
hA1 ⊕hA2 =

γA1∈hA1,γA2∈hA2
{γA1 + γA2 −γA1 × γA2};
(1.6)
hA1 ⊗hA2 =

γA1∈hA1,γA2∈hA2
{γA1 × γA2};
(1.7)

Hesitant Fuzzy Set
λhA =

γA∈hA
{1 −(1 −γA)λ}, λ > 0;
(1.8)
hλ
A =

γA∈hA
{γ λ
A}, λ > 0.
(1.9)
Note that the deﬁnition of set operations on HFEs is not the only possible
expressions which are described by Deﬁnitions 1.3 and 1.4. More complete classes
of expressions dedicated to the HFE set operations are those given by the classes of
negations, S-norms (or T-conorms), and T-norms. However, the above-mentioned
set operations on HFEs are called the standard fuzzy operations.
In order to produce a family of meaningful fuzzy operations on fuzzy sets or their
extensions, we consider the following axiomatic requirements [33]:
Negation/Complement Axioms
•
N1. N(0) = 1 and N(1) = 0 (Boundary conditions);
•
N2. For all a, b ∈[0, 1], if a ≤b, then N(a) ≥N(b) (Monotonicity);
•
N3. For each a ∈[0, 1], N(N(a)) = a (Involutivity),
where N : [0, 1] × [0, 1] →[0, 1].
T-norm/Intersection Axioms
•
T1. T (a, 1) = a (Boundary condition);
•
T2. For all a, b, c ∈[0, 1], if b ≤c, then T (a, b) ≤T (a, c) (Monotonicity);
•
T3. For all a, b ∈[0, 1], T (a, b) = T (b, a) (Commutativity);
•
T4. For all a, b, c ∈[0, 1], T (a, T (b, c)) = T (T (a, b), c) (Associativity),
where T : [0, 1] × [0, 1] →[0, 1].
S-norm/Union Axioms
•
S1. S(a, 0) = a (Boundary condition);
•
S2. For all a, b, c ∈[0, 1], if b ≤c, then S(a, b) ≤S(a, c) (Monotonicity);
•
S3. For all a, b ∈[0, 1], S(a, b) = S(b, a) (Commutativity);
•
S4. For all a, b, c ∈[0, 1], S(a, S(b, c)) = S(S(a, b), c) (Associativity),
where S : [0, 1] × [0, 1] →[0, 1].
We call a T-norm function T : [0, 1] × [0, 1] →[0, 1] as an Archimedean T-
norm if it is continuous and satisﬁes T (a, a) < a, and moreover, we call a S-norm
function S : [0, 1] × [0, 1] →[0, 1] as an Archimedean S-norm if it is continuous
and satisﬁes S(a, a) > a.
The theorem of T-norm/S-norm characterization [33] enables us to generate a
class of Archimedean T-norms/S-norms by using the non-unique additive generator
g as follows:
T (a, b) = g−1(g(a) + g(b)),
(1.10)

1.1
Hesitant Fuzzy Set

and similarly, an Archimedean S-norm by using the non-unique additive generator
k as the following:
S(a, b) = k−1(k(a) + k(b)),
(1.11)
in which g : [0, 1] →[0, ∞) is a strictly decreasing function such that g(1) = 0,
and k(a) = g(1 −a).
Furthermore, an Archimedean T-norm may be generated by the non-unique
multiplicative generator ˆg in the form of

In what follows, we present some T-norms (respectively, S-norms) which are
known as Algebraic, Einstein, Hamacher, and Frank T-norms (respectively, S-
norms) based on choosing different additive generators g and k [6]:
•
If g(a) = −log(a), and therefore k(a) = −log(1−a), g−1(a) = e−a, k−1(a) =
1 −e−a, then one gets Algebraic T-norm and Algebraic S-norm as:

Now, we turn to the following deﬁnitions which reveal the axiomatic skeleton
properties of fuzzy division and fuzzy subtraction (see [17]).
Division Axioms
•
T ∗1. T ∗(a, 1) = a (Boundary condition);
•
T ∗2. For all a, b, c ∈[0, 1], if b ≤c, then T ∗(b, a) ≤T ∗(c, a) (Monotonicity);
•
T ∗3. For all a ∈[0, 1], T ∗(a, a) > a (Super-idempotency),
where T ∗: [0, 1] × [0, 1] →[0, 1].
Subtraction Axioms
•
S∗1. S∗(a, 0) = a (Boundary condition);
•
S∗2. For all a, b, c ∈[0, 1], if b ≤c, then S∗(b, a) ≤S∗(c, a) (Monotonicity);
•
S∗3. For all a ∈[0, 1], S∗(a, a) < a (Sub-idempotency),
where S∗: [0, 1] × [0, 1] →[0, 1].
Farhadinia [17] proved that for the Archimedean T-norm T : [0, 1] × [0, 1] →
[0, 1] and the Archimedean S-norm S : [0, 1]×[0, 1] →[0, 1], which are expressed

Hesitant Fuzzy Set
by their additive generators in the forms of
T (a, b) = g−1(g(a) + g(b)),
(1.29)
S(a, b) = k−1(k(a) + k(b)),
(1.30)
we can derive the following results:
T (a, a) = 1,
if and only if
g(a) = −g(a),
(1.31)
S(a, a) = 0,
if and only if
k(a) = −k(a).
(1.32)
Here, g : [0, 1] →[0, ∞) is a strictly decreasing function such that g(1) = 0, and
k(a) = g(1 −a).
On the basis of the above results, we can express the operational functions T ∗, S∗
with respect to the Archimedean T-norm T : [0, 1] × [0, 1] →[0, 1] and the
Archimedean S-norm S : [0, 1] × [0, 1] →[0, 1] as follows:
T ∗(a, b) := T (a, b) = g−1(g(a) −g(b)),
(1.33)
S∗(a, b) := S(a, b) = k−1(k(a) −k(b)).
(1.34)
Hereafter, we call the functions g and k as the subtractive generators of
operational functions T ∗-norm and S∗-norm, respectively.
Also, a T ∗-norm can be expressed by its divisive generator ˆg as:
T ∗(a, b) = ˆg−1
 ˆg(a)
ˆg(b)

,
(1.35)
where ˆg(a) = exp(g(a)) for all a ∈[0, 1].
Notice that the subtractive generator of T ∗-norm (respectively, S∗-norm) is
indeed the additive generator of T -norm (respectively, S-norm), and thus the
subtractive generator of T ∗-norm inherits all the properties of the additive generator
of T -norm.
Now, we are interested in presenting a fundamental deﬁnition which provides us
with a method for producing several division and subtraction operators on HFEs.
Deﬁnition 1.6 ([17]) Let C[0, 1] be a set of some values in [0, 1], and T ∗, S∗:
[0, 1] × [0, 1] →[0, 1] be operational functions given by (1.33) and (1.34). Then,
the division and subtraction operators on C[0, 1] are, respectively, deﬁned as:
⊘(a, b) = min{1, T ∗(a, b)} = min{1, g−1(g(a) −g(b))},
(1.36)
⊖(a, b) = max{0, S∗(a, b)} = max{0, k−1(k(a) −k(b))},
(1.37)
where g : [0, 1] →[0, ∞) is a strictly decreasing function such that g(1) = 0, and
k(a) = g(1 −a).

In the following, we introduce some T ∗-norms and S∗-norms that are obtained in
accordance with different subtractive generators g and k:
•
If g(a) = −log(a), and therefore k(a) = −log(1−a), g−1(a) = e−a, k−1(a) =
1 −e−a, then one gets Algebraic T ∗-norm and Algebraic S∗-norm as:
T ∗
1 (a, b) = a
b ,
(1.38)
S∗
1(a, b) = a −b
1 −b .
(1.39)
•
If g(a) = log( 2−a
a ), and therefore k(a) = log( 2−(1−a)
1−a
), g−1(a) =
2
ea+1,
k−1(a) = 1 −
2
ea+1, then one gets Einstein T ∗-norm and Einstein S∗-norm as:
T ∗
2 (a, b) =
a(2 −b)
1 −(1 −a)(1 −b),
(1.40)
S∗
2(a, b) = a −b
1 −ab.
(1.41)
•
If g(a) = log( ϵ+(1−ϵ)a
a
), ϵ > 0, and therefore k(a) = log( ϵ+(1−ϵ)(1−a)
1−a
),
g−1(a) =
ϵ
ea+ϵ−1, k−1(a) = 1 −
ϵ
ea+ϵ−1, then one gets Hamacher T ∗-norm
and Hamacher S∗-norm as:
T ∗ϵ
3 (a, b) =
(ϵ + (1 −ϵ)b)a
ϵb −(1 −ϵ)(a −b −ab),
(1.42)
S∗ϵ
3 (a, b) =
a −b
(1 −ϵ)((1 −a)(1 −b) −(1 −a)) + (1 −b), ϵ > 0.
(1.43)
•
If g(a) = log( ϵ−1
ϵa−1), ϵ > 1, and therefore k(a) = log(
ϵ−1
ϵ1−a−1), g−1(a) =
log( ϵ−1+ea
ea
)
log(ϵ)
, k−1(a) = 1 −g−1(a) = 1 −
log( ϵ−1+ea
ea

log(ϵ)
, then one gets Frank T ∗-
norm and Frank S∗-norm as:
T ∗ϵ

1 + (ϵ −1)ϵa −1

In the sequel, we are in a position to construct several division and subtraction
operations for HFEs based on the above-deﬁned T ∗-norm and S∗-norm:

Notice that HFEs should be considered as a set of some values in the open-
interval (0, 1) to avoid zero denominator when calculating the above operational
functions.
It is worthwhile to mention that the above-proposed Algebraic division and
Algebraic subtraction are in accordance with the only ones introduced by Liao and
Xu in [36].
However, Farhadinia [17] generalized the deﬁnitions of division and subtraction
operations in Deﬁnition 1.6 in the forms of
⊘(a, b) = min{1, T ∗(a, b)} = min{1, g−1(g(a) −g(b))},
(1.54)
⊖(a, b) = max{0, S∗(a, b)} = max{0, k−1(k(a) −k(b))}.
(1.55)
In the latter formulas g : [0, 1] →[0, ∞) stands for a strictly decreasing function
such that g(1) = 0, and k(a) = g(1 −a).
Moreover, if we consider the negation operator N(a) = 1 −a, then the pair of
division and subtraction operations satisfy the following De Morgans laws:
⊘(a, b) = N(⊖(N(a), N(b))),
(1.56)
⊖(a, b) = N(⊘(N(a), N(b))).
(1.57)
Comparison of two HFEs is one of the most frequently used tool in decision
making technique. However, the number of values in different HFEs may be
different. To have a correct comparison, the two HFEs hA1(x) and hA2(x) should
have the same length lx. Suppose that l(hA1(x)) stands for the number of values in
hA1(x). In such a situation, we make the assumptions that: (see [50, 52, 54, 64])
(A1) All the elements in each hA1(x) are arranged in increasing order, and then
γ σ(j)
A1
(x) is referred to as the j-th largest value in hA1(x). (A2) If, for some x ∈X,
l(hA1(x)) ̸= l(hA2(x)), then lx = max{l(hA1(x)), l(hA2(x))}. If there are fewer
elements in hA1(x) than in hA2(x), an extension of hA1(x) should be considered
by repeating its maximum element or its minimum element or any element until it
has the same length with hA2(x). It should be noted that the selection of repeated
element depends on the decision makers’ risk preferences. The optimistic experts
expect desirable outcomes and they may add the maximum element, while the
pessimist experts expect unfavourable outcomes and they may add the minimum
element. It is not out of mind that the ﬁnal results may be different if one extends
the shorter one by adding different elements. This is quite reasonable because the
decision makers’ risk preferences can directly inﬂuence the ﬁnal decision [12, 19–
29]. Hereafter, we extend the shorter one by adding the maximum value.
Deﬁnition 1.8 ([16]) Let A1 and A2 be two HFSs on X. Then, two kinds of
ordering techniques for HFSs are presented as follows:
•
The component-wise ordering of HFSs:
A1 ≤A2
if and only if
γ σ(j)
A1
(xi) ≤γ σ(j)
A2
(xi),
1 ≤i ≤n, 1 ≤j ≤lxi.

1.2
Hesitant Triangular Fuzzy Set
13
•
The total ordering of HFSs:
A1 ⪯A2
if and only if
Sc(A1) ≤Sc(A2),
in which Sc(.) represents the score function of a HFS [54] given by
Sc(A1) = 1
n

i=1

⎝1

lxi

j=1
γ σ(j)

⎞
⎠.
(1.58)
Example 1.2 Let X = {x1, x2, x3} be the reference set, and
A1 = {⟨x1, {0.4}⟩, ⟨x2, {0.3, 0.4}⟩, ⟨x3, {0.3, 0.2, 0.5, 0.6}⟩},
A2 = {⟨x1, {0.2, 0.5}⟩, ⟨x2, {0.3}⟩, ⟨x3, {0.3, 0.2}⟩},
be two HFSs on X. Then, the HFSs A1 and A2 may be, respectively, represented by
A1 = {⟨x1, {0.4, 0.4}⟩, ⟨x2, {0.3, 0.4}⟩, ⟨x3, {0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.6}⟩},
A2 = {⟨x1, {0.2, 0.5}⟩, ⟨x2, {0.3, 0.3}⟩, ⟨x3, {0.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3}⟩}.
Using the ﬁrst ordering technique presented in Deﬁnition 1.8, we easily ﬁnd that
the HFSs A1 and A2 are not component-wise comparable because γ σ(1)
A1
(x1) ̸≤
γ σ(1)
A2 (x1) (therefore, A1 ̸≤A2) and γ σ(2)
A2 (x1) ̸≤γ σ(2)
A1
(x1) (therefore, A2 ̸≤A1).
Applying the second ordering technique represented in Deﬁnition 1.8 to the HFSs
A1 and A2 gives rise to
Sc(A1) = 1
3
0.4 + 0.4
2
+ 0.3 + 0.4
2
+ 0.2 + 0.3 + 0.5 + 0.6
4

= 0.3833,
Sc(A2) = 1

0.2 + 0.5
2
+ 0.3 + 0.3
2
+ 0.2 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3
4

= 0.3083.
This implies that A2 is totally smaller than A1 and denoted by A2 ⪯A1.

One of suitable tool for describing the uncertain membership degrees of
an element is the form of fuzzy numbers. By taking on the concept of
triangular fuzzy number into account, Yu [55] represented the concept of

triangular fuzzy hesitant number, and further, deﬁned the corresponding
arithmetic operators. Shi et al. [46] deﬁned Einstein correlated averaging
operator to evaluate the wireless network security whose information is in
the form of hesitant triangular fuzzy set. A development of hesitant triangular
fuzzy set was given by Rashid and Husnine [43] who proposed trapezoidal
valued hesitant fuzzy set. Peng [39] and Zhang et al. [60] developed some
different multiple criteria decision making techniques whose criteria values
are expressed by hesitant trapezoidal fuzzy elements. In a different manner of
construction, Deli and Karaaslan [10] introduced the concept of generalized
trapezoidal hesitant fuzzy set which is deﬁned as a generalization of hesitant
fuzzy sets and generalized fuzzy numbers.
The concept of hesitant triangular fuzzy set (HTFS) is an extension of HFS in
which the membership degree of each element is stated by the use of triangular
fuzzy numbers.
Deﬁnition 1.9 ([55]) A hesitant triangular fuzzy set (HTFS) A on X is generally
denoted by
A = {⟨x, hA(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(1.59)
in which hA(x) is referred to as the hesitant triangular fuzzy element (HTFE) and
it represents the possible membership degrees of the element x ∈X to A. In other
words, the HTFS A is deﬁned by the form of
A =

Remark 1.2 Throughout this book, the set of all HTFSs on the reference set X is
denoted by HTFS(X).
Example 1.3 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
hA(x1) = {(0.2, 0, 3, 0.45), (0.4, 0.6, 0.65), (0.5, 0.6, 0.7)}
and hA(x2) = {(0.3, 0.5, 0.55), (0.4, 0.7, 0.8)} be the HTFEs of xi (i = 1, 2) to a
set A, respectively. Then A can be considered as an HTFS, i.e.,
A = {⟨x1, {(0.2, 0, 3, 0.45), (0.4, 0.6, 0.65), (0.5, 0.6, 0.7)}⟩,
⟨x2, {(0.3, 0.5, 0.55), (0.4, 0.7, 0.8)}⟩}.
Deﬁnition 1.10 ([9]) A hesitant trapezoidal fuzzy set (HTFS) A on X is generally
denoted by
A = {⟨x, hA(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(1.61)
where hA(x) is referred to as the hesitant trapezoidal fuzzy element (HTFE) and it
represents the possible membership degrees of the element x ∈X to A. In other
words, the HTFS A can be denoted by

denoted by GTHFS(X).
Example 1.4 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
hA(x1) = {⟨(0.2, 0, 3, 0.45, 0.5), {0.4, 0.6, 0.65}⟩} and

Given three GTHFEs represented by hA, hA1, and hA2, two fundamental arithmetic

1.3
Interval-Valued Hesitant Fuzzy Set
In many practical applications, the uncertainty is usually speciﬁed between
some different values, and determination of crisp membership degrees is not
easy task. This impulsed Chen et al. [8] to deﬁne a generalization of hesitant
fuzzy set as the concept of interval-valued hesitant fuzzy set which dominates
the barrier and helps a decision maker to assign some membership degrees
for an object under a set to have several interval values [41]. The theory
of interval-valued hesitant fuzzy set has attracted more attention in decision
making ﬁelds [34, 51], and in group decision making processing [8]. Li and
Peng [34] introduced the interval-valued hesitant fuzzy Hamacher synergetic
weighted aggregation operators; Wei et al. [51] proposed a number of hesitant
interval-valued fuzzy aggregation operators; and Chen et al. [8] presented
some interval-valued hesitant preference relations.
The concept of interval-valued hesitant fuzzy set as a generalization of HFS is
similar to that encountered in intuitionistic fuzzy environments, where the concept
of intuitionistic fuzzy set has been extended to that of interval-valued intuitionistic
fuzzy set.
Deﬁnition 1.12 ([8]) An interval-valued hesitant fuzzy set (IVHFS) 
A on X is
deﬁned as:

A = {⟨x, h
A(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(1.68)
where h
A(x) is referred to as the interval-valued hesitant fuzzy element (IVHFE)
and it is in fact a set of some different interval values in [0, 1]. Further, h
A(x)
represents the possible membership degrees of the element x ∈X to 
A. In this

A can be denoted by

Example 1.5 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
h

A(x2) = {[0.3, 0.5], [0.4, 0.7]} be
the IVHFEs of xi (i = 1, 2) to a set 

A can be considered as
an IVHFS, i.e.,

Continuing in the same vein, we are easily able to obtain the product and sum

Extended Hesitant Fuzzy Set
As an extension of the hesitant fuzzy set concept, Zhu and Xu [62] proposed
the concept of extended hesitant fuzzy set as a tool to avoid loss of
information. In fact, such a consideration enables us to present information
represented by the decision makers using possible value-groups. However,
this deﬁnition of extended hesitant fuzzy set suffers from some drawbacks
which are mentioned by a fresh study conducted by Farhadinia and Herrera-
Viedma [25]. They revisited the concept of extended hesitant fuzzy set
proposed by Zhu and Xu using the Cartesian product of hesitant fuzzy sets.
Farhadinia and Xu [30] have recently dealt with a new aspect of emergency
event that used instead of usual aggregation procedure, a new fusion technique
based on the modiﬁed version of extended hesitant fuzzy set.
Deﬁnition 1.13 ([62]) Suppose that X is the reference set, and hk(x)
=
{γ δ(i)
k
(x) | i = 1, . . . , lhk} for k = 1, .., mx denote a family of mx hesitant
fuzzy elements deﬁned for a given x ∈X. Then, the version of Zhu and Xu’s [62]

1.4
Extended Hesitant Fuzzy Set
21
extended hesitant fuzzy set (Z-EHFS) is deﬁned as
`A = {⟨x, h `A(x)⟩| x ∈X}
= {⟨x, h1(x) × h2(x) × . . . × hmx(x)⟩| x ∈X}
=
⎧



⎫
⎬
⎭.
(1.79)
Before any progress can be made in deﬁning the EHFS, it is necessary to take this
point into consideration that each element of EHFS, called hereafter as the extended
hesitant fuzzy element (EHFE), is a set of n-tuples which indicates the opinion of n
number of decision makers, simultaneously.
To say more precisely, Farhadinia and Herrera-Viedma [25] considered a situ-
ation in which an EHFE is used to indicate the opinion of n = 3 decision makers
simultaneously, meanwhile the number of HFEs is 4. In such a situation, each EHFE
contains of the 3-tuple elements, meanwhile the Cartesian product of 4 HFEs is a
set of 4-tuple elements. This clearly shows that an EHFE including 3-tuple elements
is different from the Cartesian product of 4 HFEs. Hence, an element of EHFE does
not generally play the role of the element included in the Cartesian product of HFEs
as deﬁned in Zhu and Xu [62].
Farhadinia and Herrera-Viedma [25] re-deﬁned the EHFS as the following form.
Deﬁnition 1.14 ([25]) Suppose that X is the reference set. Then, an extended
hesitant fuzzy set (EHFS) is characterized by the following mathematical symbol
`A = {⟨x, h `A(x)⟩| x ∈X}
=

⎭,
(1.80)
where h `A(x) stands for an extended hesitant fuzzy element (EHFE).
Example 1.6 Suppose that X = {x1, x2} is the reference set, and h `A1(x) =
{(0.5, 0.4, 0.3), (0.5, 0.3, 0.2)} and h `A2(x) = {(0.5, 0.2, 0.2)} are two EHFEs on
X. Then, the EHFS `A is characterized by
`A = {⟨x1, h `A1(x)⟩, ⟨x2, h `A2(x)⟩}
= {⟨x1, {(0.5, 0.4, 0.3), (0.5, 0.3, 0.2)}⟩, ⟨x2, {(0.5, 0.2, 0.2)}⟩}.
Here, we are going to introduce some operational laws on the EHFEs that help
to aggregate the extended hesitant fuzzy information.

Higher Order Hesitant Fuzzy Set
The generalization of hesitant fuzzy set, known as the generalized hesitant
fuzzy set [40], has its inherent drawbacks, because it expresses the mem-
bership degrees of an element to a given set only by crisp numbers or
intuitionistic fuzzy sets. In many practical decision making problems, the
information provided by a decision maker might often be described by fuzzy
sets (instead of crisp numbers) or other fuzzy set extensions (instead of
intuitionistic fuzzy sets). Therefore, it is difﬁcult for the decision makers to
(continued)

1.5
Higher Order Hesitant Fuzzy Set
23
provide exact crisp values or just intuitionistic fuzzy sets for the membership
degrees. This difﬁculty can be avoided using a higher order of hesitant fuzzy
set introduced by Farhadinia [14] for the membership degrees. The higher
order hesitant fuzzy set is more ﬁt for the case when the decision makers have
a hesitation among several possible memberships with uncertainties.
Before going more deeply into the matter, it might be well to introduce the
concept which was ﬁrst presented by Farhadinia [14].
We suppose that X to be a reference set. Farhadinia [14] deﬁned a generalized
type of fuzzy set (G-Type FS) on X in the form of
A = {⟨x, hA(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(1.85)
where
hA : X →ψ([0, 1]).
Here, ψ([0, 1]) denotes a family of crisp or fuzzy sets that can be deﬁned with in
the universal set [0, 1].
It is noteworthy that most of the existing extensions of ordinary fuzzy set are
special cases of G-Type FS. For instance, by taking G-Type FS A given by (1.85)
into consideration, we conclude that (see [33])
•
If ψ([0, 1]) = [0, 1], then the G-Type FS A reduces to an ordinary fuzzy set;
•
If ψ([0, 1]) = ε([0, 1]) denoting the set of all closed intervals, then the G-Type
FS A reduces to an interval-valued fuzzy set;
•
If ψ([0, 1]) = F([0, 1]) denoting the set of all ordinary fuzzy sets, then the
G-Type FS A reduces to a type 2 fuzzy set;
•
If ψ([0, 1]) = L denoting a partially ordered Lattice, then the G-Type FS A
reduces to a lattice fuzzy set.
As can be seen from deﬁnition of HFS, it expresses the membership degrees of an
element to a given set only by several real numbers between 0 and 1, while in many
real-world situations assigning exact values to the membership degrees does not
describe properly the imprecise or uncertain decision information. Thus, it seems to
be not easy for the decision makers to rely on HFSs for expressing uncertainty of an
element.
To overcome the difﬁculty associated with expressing uncertainty of an element
to a given set, Farhadinia [14] introduced the concept of higher order hesitant fuzzy
set (HOHFS). This makes the membership degrees of an element for a given set to
be expressed by several possible G-Type FSs.

Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Deﬁnition 1.15 ([14]) Let X be a reference set. A higher order hesitant fuzzy set
(HOHFS) on X is deﬁned in terms of a function that when applied to X returns a
set of G-Type FSs. A HOHFS is denoted by
˘A = {⟨x, h ˘A(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(1.86)
in which h ˘A(x) is referred to as the higher order hesitant fuzzy element (HOHFE),
and it is a set of some G-Type FSs denoting the possible membership degree of the
element x ∈X to the set ˘A. In this regards, the HOHFS ˘A is also represented as:
˘A =
⎧
⎨
⎩

x,

γ ˘A∈h ˘A
{γ ˘A}

| x ∈X
⎫
⎬
⎭,
where all γ ˘A(x) are G-Type FSs on X.
Remark 1.6 Throughout this book, the set of all HOHFSs on the reference set X is
denoted by HOHFS(X).
Example 1.7 If X = {x1, x2, x3} is the reference set, then
h ˘A(x1) = {(0.2, 0.4), (0.5, 0.3)},
h ˘A(x2) = {(0.3, 0.4)},
h ˘A(x3) = {(0.3, 0.2), (0.1, 0.3), (0.5, 0.4)}
are the HOHFEs of xi (i = 1, 2, 3) to the set ˘A where the G-Type FSs γ σ(k)
˘A
(xi) =
(μki, νki) are intuitionistic fuzzy sets such that 0 ≤μki, νki ≤1 and 0 ≤μki+νki ≤
1 for k = 1, 2, . . . , lxi (i = 1, 2, . . . , |X| = 3). Then ˘A can be considered as a
HOHFS, i.e.,
˘A = {⟨x1, {(0.2, 0.4), (0.5, 0.3)}⟩, ⟨x2, {(0.3, 0.4)}⟩,
⟨x3, {(0.3, 0.2), (0.1, 0.3), (0.5, 0.4)}⟩}.
In view of Deﬁnition 1.15 and the latter review of some fuzzy set extensions, it
is easily deduced that each HOHFS becomes a type 2 fuzzy set if all its G-Type FSs
are the same. That is, if h ˘A(x) := γ σ(1)
˘A
(x) = . . . = γ σ(lx)
˘A
(x) for any x ∈X, then
the HOHFS ˘A = {⟨x, h ˘A(x)⟩| x ∈X} reduces to a type 2 fuzzy set.
It is noteworthy to mention again that the notions of interval-valued hesitant
fuzzy set [13] given in the next sections and the interval type-2 fuzzy set [37] both
are special cases of HOHFSs. A HOHFS ˘A = {⟨x, h ˘A(x)⟩| x ∈X} reduces to an
interval-valued hesitant fuzzy set, when all G-Type FSs γ σ(t)
˘A
(x) (t = 1, . . . , lx) for
any x ∈X are considered as closed intervals of real numbers in [0, 1]. Furthermore,

an interval-valued hesitant fuzzy set ˘A = {⟨x, 
γ σ(t)
˘A
∈h ˘A{γ σ(t)
˘A
}⟩| x ∈X} reduces
to an interval-valued type 2 fuzzy set, when all intervals satisfy
γ σ(1)
˘A
(x) := [γ σ(1),L

(x)] = . . . = γ σ(lx)
˘A
(x) := [γ σ(lx),L
˘A
(x), γ σ(lx),U
˘A
(x)] for any x ∈X.
Qian et al. [40] extended HFSs by the use of intuitionistic fuzzy set concept and
referred to that as the generalized hesitant fuzzy set (G-HFS). They stated that fuzzy
sets, intuitionistic fuzzy sets, and HFSs are special cases of G-HFSs. Obviously, a
G-HFS ˘A = {⟨x, h ˘A(x)⟩| x ∈X} is also a special case of HOHFS where all G-
Type FSs γ σ(1)
˘A
(x), . . . , γ σ(lx)
˘A
(x) for any x ∈X are considered as intuitionistic
fuzzy sets.

Dual Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Dual hesitant fuzzy set is a representation which seeks to combine intuitionist
fuzzy concept and hesitant fuzzy concept by uniting the advantages of these
concepts. Indeed, Zhu et al. [63] introduced the concept of dual hesitant fuzzy
set which can encompass fuzzy sets, intuitionistic fuzzy sets, hesitant fuzzy
sets, and fuzzy multisets as special cases. It is seen that dual hesitant fuzzy sets
can better deal with the situations that permit the membership and the non-
membership of an element to a given set having a few different values. Such
situations often arise in group decision making problems, such as, the study
deals with a number of dual hesitant fuzzy information aggregation operators
including mean and geometric forms of dual hesitant fuzzy Heronian concept
[56], the dual hesitant fuzzy-based group decision making technique which
assists the assessment of network information system security [57], a variety
of distance measures for dual hesitant fuzzy sets [49], and the investigation of
multiple criteria decision making problems based on Heronian mean, in which
the attribute values are assumed in the form of interval-valued dual hesitant
fuzzy information [59].
Deﬁnition 1.16 ([63]) Let X be a reference set, a dual hesitant fuzzy set (DHFS)
A on X is deﬁned in terms of two functions uA(x) and vA(x) as follows:
A = {⟨x, uA(x), vA(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(1.87)
where uA(x) and vA(x) are the sets of some different values in [0, 1] and represent
the possible membership degrees and non-membership degrees of the element x ∈
X to A, respectively.

Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Here, for all x ∈X, if we suppose that uA(x) = 
γA∈uA(x){γA}, vA(x) =

ηA∈vA(x){ηA}, γA+ ∈u+
A = 
x∈X maxγA∈uA(x){γA} and
ηA+ ∈v+
A = 
x∈X maxηA∈vA(x){ηA}, then it would be concluded that
0 ≤γA, ηA ≤1,
0 ≤γA+ + ηA+ ≤1.
For the sake of simplicity, Zhu et al. [63] called the pair hA(x) = (uA(x), vA(x)) as
the dual hesitant fuzzy element (DHFE).
Remark 1.7 Throughout this book, the set of all DHFSs on the reference set X is
denoted by DHFS(X).
Remark 1.8 It should be mentioned that the concept of DHFS is also called in the
literature [50] as the intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy set.
Before giving the deﬁnition of arithmetic operations for DHFSs, let us discuss
more or less about the complement operator for DHFSs. The complement of a DHFS
A, denoted by Ac is deﬁned in form of (see [63])
Ac = {⟨x, uc
A(x), vc
A(x)⟩| x ∈X}
=
⎧
⎪⎨
⎪⎩
{⟨x, 
ηA∈vA(x){ηA}, 
γA∈uA(x){γA}⟩|x ∈X}, if
uA ̸= ∅, vA ̸= ∅;
{⟨x, 
γA∈uA(x){1 −γA}, {∅}⟩|x ∈X},
if
uA ̸= ∅, vA = ∅;
{⟨x, {∅}, 
ηA∈vA(x){1 −ηA}⟩|x ∈X},
if
uA = ∅, vA ̸= ∅.
Example 1.8 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
hA(x1) = (uA(x1), vA(x1)) = ({0.2, 0.5}, {0.3}) and hA(x2) = (uA(x2), vA(x2)) =
({0.3, 0.4}, {0.1, 0.6}) be the DHFEs of xi (i = 1, 2) in the set A, respectively. Then
A can be considered as a DHFS, i.e.,
A = {⟨x1, {0.2, 0.5}, {0.3}⟩, ⟨x2, {0.3, 0.4}, {0.1, 0.6}⟩}.
Note that for a given DHFE hA ̸= ∅, if uA and vA possess only one value γA and ηA,
respectively, such that 0 ≤γA + ηA ≤1, then the DHFS reduces to an intuitionistic
fuzzy set [54]. If uA and vA possess only one value γA and ηA, respectively, such
that γA + ηA = 1, or uA has one value and vA = ∅, then the DHFS reduces to a
fuzzy set. If uA ̸= ∅and vA = ∅, then the DHFS reduces to a HFS.
In what follows, we will borrow deﬁnition of some set and algebraic operations
on DHFSs.
Deﬁnition 1.17 ([15]) Let X be a reference set, A1 and A2 be two DHFSs. We
deﬁne
A1 ∪A2 =

hA1∈A1,hA2∈A2
hA1 ∪hA2
= {⟨x, uA1(x) ∪uA2(x), vA1(x) ∩vA2(x)⟩|x ∈X},
(1.88)

1.7
Dual Hesitant Triangular Fuzzy Set
27
A1 ∩A2 =

hA1∈A1,hA2∈A2
hA1 ∩hA2
= {⟨x, uA1(x) ∩uA2(x), vA1(x) ∪vA2(x)⟩|x ∈X},
(1.89)
A1 ⊕A2 =

hA1∈A1,hA2∈A2
hA1 ⊕hA2
= {⟨x, uA1(x) ⊕uA2(x), vA1(x) ⊗vA2(x)⟩|x ∈X},
(1.90)
A1 ⊗A2 =

hA1∈A1,hA2∈A2
hA1 ⊗hA2
= {⟨x, uA1(x) ⊗uA2(x), vA1(x) ⊕vA2(x)⟩|x ∈X},
(1.91)
where the operations uA1(x) ⊛uA2(x) and vA1(x) ⊛vA2(x) coincide with those
deﬁned between HFSs in the preceding sections.
It is noteworthy that the above Zhu and Xu’s deﬁnition of DHFE operations are
much like that proposed by Farhadinia for DHFEs in [15].
Analogously, we can obtain the product and the sum operations of Algebraic,
Einstein, Hamacher, and Frank for DHFEs as those proposed in Deﬁnition 1.7.
The division and subtraction operations of HFEs introduced in Deﬁnition 1.7 can
be extended into that of DHFEs as follows:
Deﬁnition 1.18 ([15]) Given two DHFEs represented by hA1 = (uA1, vA1) and
hA2 = (uA2, vA2), the division and the subtraction operations on the DHFEs, which
are also DHFEs, can be described as follows:
hA1 ⊘hA2 = (uA1 ⊘uA2, vA1 ⊖vA2);
(1.92)
hA1 ⊖hA2 = (uA1 ⊖uA2, vA1 ⊘vA2),
(1.93)
where the right hand side operations can be taken as Algebraic, Einstein, Hamacher
or Frank division and subtraction operations proposed in Deﬁnition 1.7.
1.7
Dual Hesitant Triangular Fuzzy Set
The concept of dual hesitant triangular fuzzy set, which is also known as
hesitant triangular intuitionistic fuzzy [7], extends the concept of generalized
trapezoidal hesitant fuzzy set introduced by Deli and Karaaslan [10]. Zhao
et al. [61] gave the hesitant triangular fuzzy information together with a
number of aggregating operators for aggregating all the related information of

multiple attribute decision making problems. Chen and Huang [7] standard-
ized hesitant triangular intuitionistic fuzzy aggregation operators, and they
proposed several distance measures to explore their application in multiple
criteria decision making.

(DHTFS) A on X is deﬁned in terms of two functions uA(x) and vA(x) as follows:
A = {⟨x, uA(x), vA(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(1.94)
where uA(x) and vA(x) are the possible membership and non-membership degrees
of the element x ∈X to A, respectively. The dual hesitant triangular fuzzy element

{⟨(0.3, 0.5, 0.6), 0.7, 0.8⟩} be the DHTFEs of xi (i = 1, 2) to a set A, respectively.
Then A can be considered as an DHTFS, i.e.,
A = {⟨x1, ⟨(0.2, 0, 3, 0.45), 0.4, 0.6⟩, ⟨(0.3, 0, 35, 0.45), 0.3, 0.5⟩,

Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Remark 1.10 In a recent work, Alcantud et al. [1] extended the concept of
DHFS based on the combination of extended hesitant fuzzy set (EHFS) with
DHFS. Indeed, the extended DHFS (EDHFS) of degree ℵis nothing else
except the set of elements in the form of ℵ-tuple of DHFEs. In view of this
vein, the set and algebraic operations on EDHFSs are the ℵ-tuple forms of
those presented for DHFEs.
1.8
Interval-Valued Dual Hesitant Fuzzy Set
The concept of interval-valued hesitant fuzzy set was extended by Ju et al. [32]
to the interval-valued dual hesitant fuzzy set using the assignment of same
importance to the possible non-membership interval values in the interval-
valued hesitant fuzzy set. In the sequel, Peng et al. [42] employed the concepts
of Archimedean t-norm and Archimedean t-conorm to propose a number
of interval-valued dual-hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators. Divers’ type of
interval-valued dual-hesitant fuzzy operators were developed by Zang et al.
[59], Sarkar and Biswas [45] and Jiang et al. [31] for solving a variety of
group decision making problems.
Deﬁnition 1.20 ([2]) Let X be a reference set. An interval-valued dual hesitant
fuzzy set (IVDHFS) A on X is deﬁned in terms of two functions uA(x) and vA(x)
as follows:
A = {⟨x, uA(x), vA(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(1.100)
where
uA(x) =

[γ L
A ,γ U
A ]∈uA(x)
{[γ L
A , γ U
A ]};
vA(x) =

[ηL
A,ηU
A ]∈vA(x)
{[ηL
A, ηU
A]}
are some different interval values in [0, 1] and represent the possible interval
membership degrees and interval non-membership degrees of the element x ∈X,
respectively.

Here, for all x ∈X, if we suppose that γ U+
A
= 
x∈X max{γ U
A (x)} and ηU+
A
=

x∈X max{ηU
A(x)}, then it would be concluded that
0 ≤γ L
A , γ U
A , ηL
A, ηU
A ≤1,
0 ≤γ U+
A
+ ηU+
A

For the sake of simplicity,

[ηL

A]}) is called the
interval-valued dual hesitant fuzzy element (IVDHFE).
Remark 1.11 Throughout this book, the set of all IVDHFSs on the reference set X
is denoted by IVDHFS(X).
Example 1.10 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
hA(x1) = (
[γ L
A ,γ U
A ]∈uA(x1){[γ L

[ηL

[0.3, 0.3]) and
hA(x2) = (

A]}) = ([0.3, 0.4],
[0.1, 0.6]) be the IVDHFEs of xi (i = 1, 2) in the set A, respectively. Then A can
be considered as a IVDHFS, i.e.,
A = {⟨x1, [0.2, 0.5], [0.3, 0.3]⟩, ⟨x2, [0.3, 0.4], [0.1, 0.6]⟩}.

Chapter 2
Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Set
Abstract In this chapter, we ﬁrst deal with the concept of hesitant fuzzy linguistic
term set that reﬂects the inconsistency, hesitancy, and uncertainty of experts. An
extension of hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set, which is known as extended hesitant
fuzzy linguistic term set, is represented and a number of operations are reviewed for
such a concept. Then, by introducing the interval-valued hesitant fuzzy linguistic
term set concept in the third section, we reveal another form of hesitant fuzzy
linguistic term set extension. To address the proportional form of hesitant fuzzy
linguistic term sets, we create the skeleton of next section. Hesitant fuzzy uncertain
linguistic set is the topic being considered in the ﬁfth section. One of the main
extensions of hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set is the dual form by which we
take much more information into account given by decision makers. Two other
generalized forms of hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set including dual hesitant fuzzy
linguistic triangular set and interval-valued dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic set are the
issues lie at the next arguments in this chapter.
2.1
Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Set
Rodriguez et al. [14, 15] represented the concept of hesitant fuzzy linguis-
tic term set which permits a linguistic variable to own various linguistic
terms. Under hesitant fuzzy linguistic situation, Liao et al. [8] developed a
satisfactory based decision making technique. Wei et al. [25] extended the
comparison rule for hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets and studied the theory
of hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set aggregation. By the help of pessimistic
and optimistic attitudes of decision makers, Chen and Hong [2] represented
a multiple criteria linguistic decision technique. Zhu and Xu [33] introduced
the concept of hesitant fuzzy linguistic preference relation, and moreover,they
investigated its consistency. By taking comparative linguistic expressions into
account, Liu et al. [11] improved the additive consistency of the hesitant fuzzy
linguistic preference relations.

Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Set
In decision making problems with linguistic information, experts usually feel more
comfortable to express their opinions by linguistic variables (or linguistic terms)
because this approach is more realistic and it is close to the human cognitive
processes. If we take into consideration the following ﬁnite and totally ordered
discrete linguistic term set
S = {sα | α = −τ, . . . , −1, 0, 1, . . ., τ},
(2.1)
where τ is a positive integer, then we ﬁnd that sα represents a possible value for a
linguistic variable.
Notice that the linguistic term set is sometimes considered as
S = {sα | α = 0, 1, . . . , τ},
(2.2)
which is not necessarily symmetrical about the central of linguistic term sets.
As a notational convention, we assume that the mid-linguistic label s0 represents an
assessment of indifference, and the remaining linguistic labels are symmetrically
located around s0. It is necessary that the totally ordered linguistic term set S
satisﬁes the following characteristics:
1. sα < sβ if and only if α < β;
2. The negation operator is deﬁned as N(sα) = s−α.
For any two linguistic terms sα, sβ ∈S, the following properties hold true [29]:
sα ⊕sβ = sα+β;
(2.3)
sα ⊕sβ = sβ ⊕sα;
(2.4)
λsα = sλα;
(2.5)
(λ1 + λ2)sα = λ1sα ⊕λ2sα;
(2.6)
λ(sα ⊕sβ) = λsα ⊕λsβ,
(2.7)
where 0 ≤λ, λ1, λ2 ≤1.
By the inspiration of the idea of HFS [17], Rodriguez et al. [14] introduced the
hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) to overcome some difﬁculties observed
in a qualitative circumstance where a decision maker may hesitate between several
terms at the same time, or he/she needs a complex linguistic term instead of a single
linguistic term to assess a linguistic variable. Continuing that work, Liao et al. [7]
reﬁned the concept of HFLTS mathematically as follows:
Deﬁnition 2.1 ([7]) Let X be a reference set, and
S = {sα | α = −τ, . . . , −1, 0, 1, . . . , τ} be a linguistic term set. A hesitant fuzzy
linguistic term set (HFLTS) on X is mathematically shown in terms of
AS = {⟨x, hAS(x)⟩| x ∈X}.
(2.8)

2.1
Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Set
39
Here, hAS(x) is a set of some possible values in the linguistic term set S and can
be characterized by
hAS(x) =

sα(x)∈S(x)
{sα(x)}.
(2.9)
Moreover, hAS(x) is called the hesitant fuzzy linguistic element (HFLE) and we
denote hAS(x) brieﬂy by hAS.
Example 2.1 Suppose that an expert is invited to evaluate the approximate speed
of three cars x1, x2, and x3. Note that this criterion is qualitative, and therefore
it should be described by linguistic terms instead of crisp values. The expert’s
judgements over these three cars are given in the form of linguistic expressions
as: {⟨x1, {f ast, very f ast}⟩, ⟨x2, {very slow, slow, slightly slow, average}⟩,
⟨x3, {very f ast}⟩}, which establishes a HFLTS as:
AS = {⟨x1, hAS(x1) = {s2, s3}⟩,
⟨x2, hAS(x2) = {s−3, s−2, s−1, s0}⟩, ⟨x3, hAS(x3) = {s3}⟩}.
Let S = {sα | α = 0, 1, . . . , τ} be the linguistic term set, and hAS
=

sα∈S{sα}, hA1S = 
sα1∈S{sα1} and hA2S = 
sα2∈S{sα2} be three HFLEs. Some
set operations on HFLEs can be described as follows (see, e.g., [14]):
hc
AS =

sα∈S
{sτ−α};
(2.10)
hA1S ∪hA2S =

sα1,sα2∈S
{smax{α1,α2}};
(2.11)
hA1S ∩hA2S =

sα1,sα2∈S
{smin{α1,α2}}.
(2.12)
Remark 2.1 By considering this fact that a group of experts may think of
several possible linguistic values or richer expressions than a single term
for evaluating an alternative in group decision making, Wang [18] discussed
linguistic terms involved in an expression which is derived by the multiple
decision makers being not always consecutive. Therefore, Wang generalized
the concept of HFLTS to extended hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (EHFLTS)
in which the family of linguistic term sets is to be taken an ordered subset.

Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Set
2.2
Interval-Valued Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Set
Wang et al. [20] proposed the concept of interval-valued hesitant fuzzy
linguistic term set to combine the advantages of both linguistic term sets and
interval-valued hesitant fuzzy sets. Indeed, the main advantage of interval-
valued hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set is that it can describe two fuzzy
criteria of an object, namely a linguistic term and an interval-valued hesitant
fuzzy element. The former provides an evaluation value, such as "good" or
"excellent", and the latter describes the hesitancy for the given evaluation
value and denotes the interval-valued membership degrees associated with
the speciﬁc linguistic term. Meng et al. [12] in a re-phrased concept, which
was called linguistic interval hesitant fuzzy set, implemented interval-valued
hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set concept to cope with the situations where the
membership degrees of linguistic terms are intervals rather than real numbers.
Deﬁnition 2.2 ([20]) Let X be a reference set, and
S = {sα | α = −τ, . . . , −1, 0, 1, . . . , τ} be a linguistic term set. An interval-valued
hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (IVHFLTS) on X is mathematically shown in terms
of

AS = {⟨x, h
AS(x)⟩| x ∈X}.
(2.13)
Here, h
AS(x) is a set of some possible pairs of linguistic term set S together with
interval values which can be characterized by
h
AS(x) = ⟨sα(x),

[γ L

AS,γ U

AS]∈h
AS(x)
{[γ L

AS, γ U

AS]}⟩,
(2.14)
where sα(x) ∈S denotes the possible value for a linguistic variable involved in
h
AS(x).
For any x ∈X, we call h
AS(x) an interval-valued hesitant fuzzy linguistic term
element (IVHFLTE).
Remark 2.2 Throughout this book, the set of all IVHFLTSs on the reference set X
is denoted by IVHFLTS(X).
Example 2.2 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
h
AS(x1) = ⟨s2, {[0.2, 0, 3], [0.4, 0.6], [0.5, 0.6]}⟩and h
AS(x2) = ⟨s1, {[0.3, 0.5],
[0.4, 0.7]}⟩be the IVHFLTEs of xi (i = 1, 2) to a set 
AS, respectively. Then 
AS

2.2
Interval-Valued Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Set
41
can be considered as an IVHFLTS, i.e.,

AS = {⟨x1, ⟨s2, {[0.2, 0, 3], [0.4, 0.6], [0.5, 0.6]}⟩⟩,
⟨x2, ⟨s1, {[0.3, 0.5], [0.4, 0.7]}⟩⟩}.
Given three IVHFLTEs represented by h
AS, h
AS
1 and h
AS
2 , some set and algebraic

2.3
Proportional Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Set
Wang and Hao [21] introduced the proportional two-tuple model that enables
experts to assign symbolic proportions to two successive linguistic terms.
Then, Zhang et al. [31] included the proportional information into the model
of linguistic representation. Motivated by the idea of Zhang et al. [31], Wu and
Xu [27] represented a possibility distribution-based technique for address-
ing multiple criteria group decision making with hesitant fuzzy linguistic
information. In order to propose a linguistic representation model which
considers simultaneously the hesitant linguistic assessment of experts and
the proportional information of each linguistic term under a group decision
making environment, Chen et al. [1] introduced the notion of proportional
hesitant fuzzy linguistic fuzzy term set.
Deﬁnition 2.3 ([1]) Let S = {sα | α = 0, 1, . . . , τ} be a ﬁnite and totally ordered
linguistic term set with odd cardinality. A proportional hesitant fuzzy linguistic term
set (PHFLTS) on X is mathematically shown in terms of
hAS =

sα∈S,pα∈PAS
{⟨sα, pα⟩}.
(2.22)

2.4
Hesitant Fuzzy Uncertain Linguistic Set
43
Here, PAS = (p0, p1, . . . , pα, . . . , pτ) denotes a vector which represents the
proportions for linguistic terms sα’s. The value pα implies the degree of possibility
that the alternative carries an assessment value sα provided by a group of experts. It
needs to be considered that 0 ≤pα ≤1 satisﬁes &τ
α=0 pα = 1.
By considering the concepts HFLTS [14], which rolls as an ordered ﬁnite subset
of consecutive linguistic terms in S, and extended HFLTS (EHFLTS) [18], which
rolls as an ordered subset of the linguistic terms of S, we conclude that the HFLTS
elements are those provided by an expert for indicating his/her hesitancy with
several possible values for a linguistic variable. This is while, the EHFLTS elements
are those provided by a group of experts whose hesitancy is to assess the possible
values for a linguistic variable. By contrast, the PHFLTS elements can be provided
by either a group of experts who are hesitant to assess the possible values for a
linguistic variable or a group of experts who assess a linguistic variable with a single
linguistic term.
Remark 2.3 Throughout this book, the set of all PHFLTSs is denoted by
PHFLTS(X).
Given the linguistic term set S = {sα | α = 0, 1, . . . , τ} and three PHFLTSs be
represented by hAS = 
sα∈S,pα∈PAS {⟨sα, pα⟩}, hAS

and hAS

are also PHFLTSs, can be described as follows (see e.g. [1]):

Hesitant Fuzzy Uncertain Linguistic Set
Lin et al. [10] introduced the concept of hesitant fuzzy uncertain linguistic
set to overcome the limitation that arises from the case where the decision
information about alternatives is usually uncertain due to the vagueness of
inherent subjective nature of human think. In the sequel, Li et al. [6] presented

Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Set
a number of aggregation operators to deal with hesitant fuzzy uncertain
linguistic multiple criteria decision making problems. Hou and Zhuo [4]
investigated the multiple criteria decision making problems involving hesitant
fuzzy uncertain linguistic information, and furthermore, they developed a
number of aggregation operators of hesitant fuzzy uncertain linguistic infor-
mation.
Deﬁnition 2.4 ([10]) Let X be a reference set, and
S = {sα | α = −τ, . . . , −1, 0, 1, . . . , τ} be a linguistic term set. A hesitant fuzzy
uncertain linguistic set (HFULS) on X is mathematically shown in terms of
`AS = {⟨x, h `AS(x)⟩| x ∈X}.
(2.26)
Here, h `AS(x) is a set of some possible pairs of interval-valued linguistic term set S
together with values in [0, 1] which can be characterized by
h `AS(x) =

[sL
α (x), sU
α (x)],

γ `AS∈h `AS(x)
{γ `AS}

,
(2.27)
where sα(x) ∈S denotes the possible interval value for a linguistic variable
involved in h `AS(x).
Remark 2.4 Throughout this book, the set of all HFULSs on the reference set X is
denoted by HFULS(X).
Example 2.3 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
h `AS(x1) = ⟨[s2, s3], {0.2, 0, 3, 0.6}⟩and h `AS(x2) = ⟨[s−1, s0], {0.3, 0.5, 0.7}⟩be
the HFULEs of xi (i = 1, 2) to a set `AS, respectively. Then `AS can be considered
as an HFULS, i.e.,
`AS = {⟨x1, ⟨[s2, s3], {0.2, 0, 3, 0.6}⟩⟩, ⟨x2, ⟨[s−1, s0], {0.3, 0.5, 0.7}⟩⟩}.
Needless to say that for any three uncertain linguistic variables sα = [sL
α , sU
α ],
sα1 = [sL
α1, sU
α1], and sα2 = [sL
α2, sU
α2], one concludes that (see, e.g., [10])
sα1 ⊕sα2 =

Remark 2.5 Some other relevant concepts including interval-valued hesitant
fuzzy uncertain linguistic set (IVHFULS) [23], linguistic interval hesitant
fuzzy set (LIHFS) [12], interval-valued 2-tuple hesitant fuzzy linguistic
term set (IV2THFLTS) [16], and multi-hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set
(MHFLTS) [19] can be deﬁned similarly, and therefore, we do not show them
here to save space.

Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Set
2.5
Dual Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Set
Inspired by the idea of hesitant fuzzy linguistic variable, Yang and Ju [30]
combined dual hesitant fuzzy set with linguistic term set to construct the
concept of dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic set containing a linguistic term and
a set of membership and non-membership degrees. Wei et al. [24] developed
a number of aggregation operators with dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic infor-
mation and utilized them in developing some approaches for dealing with
hesitant fuzzy linguistic multiple criteria decision making problems. Zhang
et al. [32] extended Archimedean t-norm and t-conorm in order to aggregate
the dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic information. Li et al. [9] deﬁned an extended
TODIM method under dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic information, and then
they applied that technique for dealing with a stock selection problem.
Deﬁnition 2.5 ([30]) Let X be a reference set, a dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic set
(DHFLS) AS on X is deﬁned in terms of two functions uAS(x) and vAS(x) together
with the linguistic term set S = {sα | α = 0, 1, . . . , τ} as follows:
AS = {⟨x, sα(x), uAS(x), vAS(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(2.32)
where uAS(x) and vAS(x) are, respectively, the sets of some different values in
[0, 1] and represent the possible membership degrees and non-membership degrees
of the element x ∈X with respect to the linguistic term set S.
Here, for all x ∈X, if we take uAS(x) = 
γAS∈uAS(x){γAS}, vAS(x) =

ηAS∈vAS(x){ηAS}, γ +
AS ∈u+
AS = 
x∈X maxγAS∈uAS(x){γAS} and η+
AS ∈v+
AS =

x∈X maxηAS∈vAS(x){ηAS}, then we conclude that
0 ≤γAS, ηAS ≤1,
0 ≤γ +
AS + η+
AS ≤1.
For the sake of simplicity, hAS(x) = (sα(x), uAS(x), vAS(x)) is called as the dual
hesitant fuzzy linguistic element (DHFLE).
Remark 2.6 Throughout this book, the set of all DHFLSs on the reference set X is
denoted by DHFLS(X).
Remark 2.7 It should be mentioned that the concept of DHFLS is also called in the
literature [3] as the intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy linguistic set (IHFLS).
Example 2.4 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
hAS(x1) = ((sα(x1), uAS(x1), vAS(x1)) = (s2, {0.2, 0.5}, {0.3}) and hAS(x2) =
(s2(x2), uAS(x2), vAS(x2)) = (s3, {0.3, 0.4}, {0.1, 0.6}) be the DHFLEs of xi (i =
1, 2) in the set AS, respectively. Then AS can be considered as a DHFLS, i.e.,
AS = {⟨x1, s2, {0.2, 0.5}, {0.3}⟩, ⟨x2, s3, {0.3, 0.4}, {0.1, 0.6}⟩}.

2.6
Dual Hesitant Fuzzy Triangular Linguistic Set
47
For the DHFLEs hAS
= (sα, uAS, vAS), hA1S
= (sα1, uA1S, vA1S), and
hA2S = (sα2, uA2S, vA2S) the following operations are deﬁned (see [24]):
hA1S ⊕hA2S = (sα1+α2, uA1S ⊕uA2S, vA1S ⊗vA2S);
(2.33)
hA1S ⊗hA2S = (sα1×α2, uA1S ⊗uA2S, vA1S ⊕vA2S),
(2.34)
λhAS = (sλα, 1 −(1 −uAS)λ, (vAS)λ);
(2.35)
hASλ = (s(α)λ, (uAS)λ, 1 −(1 −vAS)λ),
(2.36)
where the operations uA1S ⊛uA2S and vA1S ⊛vA2S coincide with those deﬁned
between HFSs in the preceding sections.
On the basis of the above operations on DHFLEs, some relationships can be
further established for the operations on DHFLSs as follows:
Let X be a reference set, A1S and A2S be two DHFLSs. We deﬁne
A1S ⊕A2S =

hA1S∈A1S,hA2S∈A2S
hA1S ⊕hA2S
= {⟨x, sα1+α2, uA1S(x) ⊕uA2S(x),
vA1S(x) ⊗vA2S(x)⟩|x ∈X},
(2.37)
A1S ⊗A2S =

hA1S∈A1S,hA2S∈A2S
hA1S ⊗hA2S
=

⟨x, sα1×α2, uA1S(x) ⊗uA2S(x),
vA1S(x) ⊕vA2S(x)⟩|x ∈X}.
(2.38)
2.6
Dual Hesitant Fuzzy Triangular Linguistic Set
On the basis of hesitant fuzzy linguistic set, triangular linguistic term set, and
dual hesitant fuzzy set, Ju et al. [5] introduced the concept of dual hesitant
fuzzy triangular linguistic set which is composed of a triangular linguistic
term. Dual hesitant fuzzy triangular linguistic set is a set of membership and
non-membership degrees for overcoming the shortcomings of hesitant fuzzy
linguistic set.
Deﬁnition 2.6 ([5]) Let X be a reference set. A dual hesitant fuzzy triangular
linguistic set (DHFTLS) ˘AS on X is deﬁned in terms of two functions u ˘AS(x)

48
2
Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Set
and v ˘AS(x) together with the linguistic term set S = {sα | α = 0, 1, . . ., τ} as
follows:
˘AS =

⟨x, ⟨sL
α , sM
α , sU
α ⟩, u ˘AS(x), v ˘AS(x)⟩| x ∈X
$
,
(2.39)
where u ˘AS(x) and v ˘AS(x) are the sets of some different values in [0, 1] and
represent the possible membership degrees and non-membership degrees of the
element x ∈X to the triangular linguistic term set S, respectively.
Here, for all x ∈X, if we denote u ˘AS(x) = 
γ ˘AS∈u ˘AS(x){γ ˘AS}, v ˘AS(x) =

η ˘AS∈v ˘AS(x){η ˘AS}, γ +
˘AS
∈u+
˘AS
= 
x∈X maxγ ˘AS∈u ˘AS(x){γ ˘AS} and η+
˘AS
∈
v+
˘AS = 
x∈X maxη ˘AS∈v ˘AS(x){η ˘AS}, then we conclude that
0 ≤γ ˘AS, η ˘AS ≤1,
0 ≤γ +
˘AS + η+
˘AS ≤1.
For the sake of simplicity, h ˘AS(x) = (⟨sL
α , sM
α , sU
α ⟩, u ˘AS(x), v ˘AS(x)) is called
as the dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic element (DHFTLE).
Remark 2.8 Throughout this book, the set of all DHFTLSs on the reference set X
is denoted by DHFTLS(X).
Example 2.5 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
h ˘AS(x1) = (⟨sL
α , sM
α , sU
α ⟩, u ˘AS(x1), v ˘AS(x1)) = (⟨s1, s2, s3⟩, {0.2, 0.5}, {0.3})
and h ˘AS(x2) = (⟨sL
α , sM
α , sU
α ⟩, u ˘AS(x2), v ˘AS(x2)) = (⟨s−1, s0, s1⟩, {0.3, 0.4},
{0.1, 0.6}) be the DHFTLEs of xi (i = 1, 2) in the set ˘AS, respectively. Then
˘AS can be considered as a DHFTLS, i.e.,
˘AS = {⟨x1, ⟨s1, s2, s3⟩, {0.2, 0.5}, {0.3}⟩, ⟨x2, ⟨s−1, s0, s1⟩, {0.3, 0.4}, {0.1, 0.6}⟩}.

Interval-Valued Dual Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Set
Interval-valued dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic set concept has been introduced
for facilitating the calculation whenever we are required to consider linguistic
evaluation sets by considering the interval-valued dual hesitant fuzzy sets
[26]. Following this line of thought, Qi et al. [13] presented the concept of
interval-valued dual hesitant fuzzy unbalanced linguistic set together with
its power aggregation operators. Xian et al. [28] utilized the concept of
generalized interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy linguistic variable to deﬁne
an induced hybrid operator for dealing with TOPSIS-based linguistic group
decision making problems.
Deﬁnition 2.8 ([26]) Let X be a reference set. An interval-valued dual hesitant
fuzzy linguistic set (IVDHFLS) AS on X is deﬁned in terms of two functions

Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Set
uAS(x) and vAS(x) together with the linguistic term set S = {sα | α = 0, 1, . . . , τ}
as follows:
AS =

⟨x, [sL
α (x), sU
α (x)], uAS(x), vAS(x)⟩| x ∈X
$
,
(2.46)
where uAS(x) = 
[γ L
AS,γ U
AS]∈uAS(x){[γ L
AS, γ U
AS]} and
vAS(x) = 
[ηL
AS,ηU
AS]∈vAS(x){[ηL
AS, ηU

[0, 1] and represent, respectively, the possible interval-valued membership degrees
and interval-valued non-membership degrees of the element x
∈
X to the
continuous linguistic term set ˆS = {sα | s0 ≤sα ≤sτ}.
Here, for all x ∈X, if we consider γ U+
AS ∈uU
AS = 
x∈X max{γ U
AS(x)} and
ηU+
AS ∈vU
AS = 
x∈X max{ηU
AS(x)}, then we conclude that
0 ≤γ L
AS, γ U
AS, ηL
AS, ηU
AS ≤1,
0 ≤γ U+
AS + ηU+
AS ≤1.
For the sake of simplicity, hAS(x)


[ηL
AS,ηU
AS]∈vAS(x){[ηL

AS]}) is called the interval-valued dual hesitant fuzzy
linguistic element (IVDHFLE).
Remark 2.9 Throughout this book, the set of all IVDHFLSs on the reference set X
is denoted by IVDHFLS(X).
Remark 2.10 It should be mentioned that the concept of IVDHFLS is also called
in the literature [28] as the interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy linguistic set
(IVIHFLS).
Example 2.6 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
hAS(x1) = ([sL
α (x1), sU

TLEs of xi (i = 1, 2) in the set AS, respectively. Then AS can be considered as a
IVDHFLS, i.e.,
AS = {⟨x1, [s1, s3], [0.2, 0.5], [0.3, 0.3]⟩, ⟨x2, [s0, s1], [0.3, 0.4], [0.1, 0.6]⟩}.

Chapter 3
Neutrosophic Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Abstract In this chapter, we ﬁrst introduce brieﬂy the concept of neutrosophic
set, and then, we introduce the concept single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy
set which is refereed here to as neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set. In the sequel, we
are going to argue about the concept of interval neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set.
Although, there may be reported some other kinds of neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy
set by different researchers, the current two kinds of neutrosophic-based hesitant
fuzzy sets are enough to fully understand the other kinds.
3.1
Neutrosophic Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Hesitant fuzzy set and neutrosophic set are two concepts which have been
extended in two different directions so far. As a combination of these
aforementioned concepts, Ye [12] introduced the concept of single-valued
neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set, which is also known as neutrosophic hesitant
fuzzy set. Single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set not only considers
the truth, indeterminacy, and falsity membership degrees of neutrosophic set
into account but also it extends these membership degrees to a set of possible
values in a unique interval and easily expresses the incomplete and incon-
sistent information. However, in the sequel, Liu and Luo [6] presented the
certainty, score, and accuracy functions of single-valued neutrosophic hesitant
fuzzy set together with proposing the single-valued neutrosophic hesitant
fuzzy ordered weighted averaging operator. Sahin and Liu [8] investigated
some decision making problems in which the correlation coefﬁcient of single-
valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy information plays the key role. Li and
Zhang [4] increased the potential of multiple criteria decision making by
presenting the Choquet aggregation operator for single-valued neutrosophic
hesitant fuzzy information. Some other kinds of aggregation operators of
single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy sets were developed by Juan-Juan
et al. [2], and Wang and Li [10].

Neutrosophic Hesitant Fuzzy Set
By taking the reference set X into account, a neutrosophicset (NS) A on X is deﬁned
in terms of three functions uA(x), wA(x), and vA(x) as follows (see [7]):
A = {⟨x, uA(x), wA(x), vA(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(3.1)
where uA(x), wA(x), vA(x) ∈[0, 1] are, respectively, called truth, indeterminacy,
and falsity membership degrees of the element x ∈X to A.
Generally, each term uA(x), wA(x), or vA(x) may be real standard or non-standard
subsets belong to ]0−, 1+[.
Remark 3.1 In the case where the terms uA(x), wA(x), and vA(x) belong to [0, 1],
then the NS A is called single-valued neutrosophic set (SVNS).
Deﬁnition 3.1 ([12]) Let X be a reference set. A single-valued neutrosophic
hesitant fuzzy set (SVNHFS) A on X is deﬁned in terms of three functions uA(x),
wA(x), and vA(x) as follows:
A = {⟨x, uA(x), wA(x), vA(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(3.2)
where uA(x), wA(x), vA(x) ∈[0, 1] denote the possible truth, indeterminacy, and
falsity hesitant membership degrees of the element x ∈X to A, respectively.
In this regard, a SVNHFS may be presented by the form of
A =
⎧
⎨
⎩⟨x,

γA∈uA
{γA},

δA∈wA
{δA},

ηA∈vA
{ηA}⟩| x ∈X
⎫
⎬
⎭.
(3.3)
For the sake of simplicity, hA(x) = (uA(x), wA(x), vA(x)) is called as the
single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy element (SVNHFE).
Remark 3.2 Throughout this book, the set of all SVNHFSs on the reference set X
is denoted by SVNHFS(X).
Example 3.1 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
hA(x1)
=
{({0.2, 0, 3}, {0.4, 0.6}, {0.3})} and hA(x2)
=
{({0.3}, {0.5},
{0.6, 0.7, 0.8})} be the SVNHFEs of xi (i = 1, 2) to a set A, respectively. Then A
can be considered as an SVNHFS, i.e.,
A = {⟨x1, ({0.2, 0, 3}, {0.4, 0.6}, {0.3})⟩, ⟨x2, ({0.3}, {0.5}, {0.6, 0.7, 0.8})⟩}.
Given three SVNHFEs represented by

hA1 = (

hA2 = (

algebraic operations on the SVNHFEs, which are also SVNHFEs, can be described

Interval Neutrosophic Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Liu and Shi [5] introduced the concept of interval neutrosophic hesitant
fuzzy set by the use of combination of interval-valued hesitant fuzzy set and
interval neutrosophic set, which extends the truth, indeterminacy, and falsity
membership functions of an element to a given set to interval-valued hesitant
fuzzy set. Kakati et al. [3] represented the interval neutrosophic hesitant
fuzzy Einstein Choquet integral operator, and they discussed thoroughly its
properties. Ye [13] developed correlation coefﬁcients of interval neutrosophic
hesitant fuzzy sets, and he investigates the relation between correlation
coefﬁcients and similarity measures.
Deﬁnition 3.2 ([5]) Let X be a reference set, an interval neutrosophic hesitant
fuzzy set (INHFS) 
A on X is deﬁned in terms of three functions u
A(x), w
A(x),
and v
A(x) as follows:

A = {⟨x, u
A(x), w
A(x), v
A(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(3.10)
where u
A(x) = 

A(x){[ηL

A, ηU

A]} all are interval values in [0, 1], and denote
the possible truth, indeterminacy, and falsity hesitant membership degrees of the
element x ∈X to 
A, respectively.
In this regard, an INHFS may be presented by the form of

Remark 3.3 Throughout this book, the set of all INHFSs on the reference set X is
denoted by INHFS(X).

A can be considered as an INHFS, i.e.,

A = {⟨x1, ({[0.2, 0, 3], [0.4, 0.5]}, {[0.4, 0.6]}, {[0.4, 0.5]}),

Chapter 4
Pythagorean Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Abstract Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy set is the ﬁrst concept which sets up the
proper framework for this chapter. Then, in order to put forward the issues and
concepts described in this chapter, we give an overall view of interval-valued form of
Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy set relevant to this contribution. The last concept which
is needed for a complete characterization of Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy set is the
dual Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy set.
4.1
Pythagorean Hesitant Fuzzy Set
By generalizing the concept of intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy set, Khan et al. [2]
represented the concept of Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy set, and subsequently,
they developed Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy weighted averaging operator and
Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy weighted geometric operator for multiple criteria
decision making problem. Further, Khan et al. proposed the ordered types
of aforementioned operators in [3]. Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy set has been
widely used in other ﬁelds of decision making, such as the study in this
issue by Liang and Xu [4] which concerns presenting distance measures for
Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy sets, and the study of Zhong et al. [8] in which the
concentration is speciﬁed on the ﬁve parameters: membership degree, non-
membership degree, indeterminacy degree, strength of commitment about
membership, and direction of commitment.
By considering X as the reference set, Yager [6] deﬁned a Pythagorean fuzzy set
(PFS) A on X in terms of two functions uA and vA as follows:
A = {⟨x, uA(x), vA(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(4.1)
where uA(x) and vA(x) are the sets of some different values in [0, 1] and represent
membership and non-membership degrees of the element x ∈X to A, respectively.

Given a ﬁxed x ∈X, some operational laws on PFSs are deﬁned as follows [6]:
Ac = {⟨x, vA(x),uA(x)⟩| x ∈X};
A1 ∪A2 = {⟨x, max{uA1(x), uA2(x)},min{vA1(x),vA2(x)}⟩| x ∈X};

Example 4.1 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
hA(x1) = {(0.2, 0, 3)} and hA(x2) = {(0.4, 0, 3)}. Then A can be considered as an
PFS, i.e.,
A = {⟨x1, (0.2, 0, 3)⟩, ⟨x2, (0.4, 0, 3)⟩}.
Deﬁnition 4.1 ([2]) Let X be a reference set. A Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy set
(PHFS) A on X is deﬁned in terms of two functions uA(x) and vA(x) as follows:
A = {⟨x, uA(x), vA(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(4.3)
where uA(x) and vA(x) are the sets of some different values in [0, 1] and represent
the possible membership degrees and non-membership degrees of the element x ∈
X to A, respectively.
Here, for all x ∈X, if we consider uA(x) = 
γA∈uA(x){γA}, vA(x) =

ηA∈vA(x){ηA}, γA+ ∈u+
A = 
x∈X maxγA∈uA(x){γA} and
ηA+ ∈v+
A = 
x∈X maxηA∈vA(x){ηA}, then we ﬁnd that
0 ≤γA, ηA ≤1,
0 ≤(γA+)2 + (ηA+)2 ≤1.

For the sake of simplicity, the pair
hA(x) := (uA(x), vA(x)) =
⎛
⎝

γA∈uA(x)
{γA},

ηA∈vA(x)
{ηA}
⎞
⎠
(4.4)
is called as the Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy element (PHFE).
Remark 4.1 Throughout this book, the set of all PHFSs on the reference set X is
denoted by PHFS(X).
Before giving the deﬁnition of algebraic operations for PHFSs, let us discuss
more or less about the complement operator for PHFSs. The complement of a PHFS
A, denoted by Ac, is deﬁned in form of (see [6])
Ac = {⟨x, uc
A(x), vc
A(x)⟩| x ∈X}
=
⎧
⎪⎨
⎪⎩
{⟨x, 
ηA∈vA(x){ηA}, 
γA∈uA(x){γA}⟩|x ∈X}, if
uA ̸= ∅, vA ̸= ∅;
{⟨x, 
γA∈uA(x){1 −γA}, {∅}⟩|x ∈X},
if
uA ̸= ∅, vA = ∅;
{⟨x, {∅}, 
ηA∈vA(x){1 −ηA}⟩|x ∈X},
if
uA = ∅, vA ̸= ∅
such that
0 ≤γAc, ηAc ≤1,
0 ≤(γAc+)2 + (ηAc+)2 ≤1.
Example 4.2 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
hA(x1) = (uA(x1), vA(x1)) = ({0.2, 0.5}, {0.3})and hA(x2) = (uA(x2), vA(x2)) =
({0.3, 0.4}, {0.1, 0.6}). Then, hA(xi) for i = 1, 2 are the PHFEs of xi (i = 1, 2) in
the set A, because the relations
(γA+)(x1) = 0.5, (ηA+)(x1) = 0.3;
(γA+)(x2) = 0.4, (ηA+)(x2) = 0.6;
result in
(γA+)2(x1) + (ηA+)2(x1) = 0.52 + 0.32 ≤1;
(γA+)2(x2) + (ηA+)2(x2) = 0.42 + 0.62 ≤1.
Thus, A is a PHFS, and it is denoted by
A = {⟨x1, {0.2, 0.5}, {0.3}⟩, ⟨x2, {0.3, 0.4}, {0.1, 0.6}⟩}.
Remark that for a given PHFE hA ̸= ∅, if uA and vA possess only one value γA and
ηA, respectively, such that 0 ≤γA2 + ηA2 ≤1, then the PHFS reduces to an PFS
[54]. If uA ̸= ∅and vA = ∅, then the PHFS reduces to a PFS.

Pythagorean Hesitant Fuzzy Set
For the PHFEs hA = (uA, vA), hA1 = (uA1, vA1) and hA2 = (uA2, vA2) the
following operations are deﬁned:
(hA)c = (vA, uA);
(4.5)
hA1 ∪hA2 = (uA1 ∪uA2, vA1 ∩vA2);
(4.6)
hA1 ∩hA2 = (uA1 ∩uA2, vA1 ∪vA2);
(4.7)
hA1 ⊕hA2 = (uA1 ⊕uA2, vA1 ⊗vA2);
(4.8)
hA1 ⊗hA2 = (uA1 ⊗uA2, vA1 ⊕vA2),
(4.9)
where
0 ≤(γA+)2 + (ηA+)2 ≤1, 0 ≤(γA+
1 )2 + (ηA+
1 )2 ≤1, 0 ≤(γA+
2 )2 + (ηA+
2 )2 ≤1.
On the basis of the operations deﬁned on PHFEs, some set and algebraic
operations on PHFSs can be established as follows:
A1 ∪A2 =

hA1∈A1,hA2∈A2
hA1 ∪hA2
= {⟨x, uA1(x) ∪uA2(x), vA1(x) ∩vA2(x)⟩|x ∈X},
(4.10)
A1 ∩A2 =

hA1∈A1,hA2∈A2
hA1 ∩hA2
= {⟨x, uA1(x) ∩uA2(x), vA1(x) ∪vA2(x)⟩|x ∈X},
(4.11)
A1 ⊕A2 =

hA1∈A1,hA2∈A2
hA1 ⊕hA2
= {⟨x, uA1(x) ⊕uA2(x), vA1(x) ⊗vA2(x)⟩|x ∈X},
(4.12)
A1 ⊗A2 =

hA1∈A1,hA2∈A2
hA1 ⊗hA2
= {⟨x, uA1(x) ⊗uA2(x), vA1(x) ⊕vA2(x)⟩|x ∈X}.

have a few different interval values. By having this motivation, Wang et
al. [5] expanded the concept of Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy set to interval-
valued Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy set, and further developed a number of
corresponding operational laws, score function, and generalized distance
measures. Then, Zhang et al. [7] developed a series of interval-valued
Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators for applying to multiple
criteria group decision making problems.
Deﬁnition 4.2 ([7]) Let X be a reference set. An interval-valued Pythagorean
hesitant fuzzy set (IVPHFS) 
A on X is deﬁned in terms of two functions u
A(x)
and v
A(x) as follows:

A = {⟨x, u
A(x), v
A(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(4.14)
where u
A(x) and v
A(x) are some different interval values in [0, 1] and represent the
possible interval membership degrees and interval non-membership degrees of the
element x ∈X to the set 
A, respectively.
Here, for all x
∈
X, if we take u
A(x)

x∈X max{γ U

Remark 4.2 Throughout this book, the set of all IVPHFSs on the reference set X is

Dual Pythagorean Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Remark 4.3 Although, some contributions (for instance, [1]) have introduced
the concept of dual Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy set, they indeed have dealt with
the re-phrased form of Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy set which has already been
discussed in the previous section. Therefore, nothing is added here concerning
that concept.

Chapter 5
q-Rung Orthopair Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Abstract q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy set is the ﬁrst concept which sets up the
proper framework for this chapter. Then, in order to put forward the issues and
concepts described in this chapter, we give an overall view of interval-valued form
of q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy set relevant to this contribution. The last concept
which is needed for a complete characterization of q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy
set is the dual q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy set.
5.1
q-Rung Orthopair Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Liu et al. [3] proposed a number of operations, score, and accurate functions
for q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy sets together with a ranking technique of
q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy sets. Furthermore, they established a distance
measure for q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy sets in order to handle the
uncertainty involved in a related TOPSIS approach. Moreover, Wang et al. [6]
developed some distance and similarity measures of q-rung orthopair hesitant
fuzzy sets and investigated their properties. In addition to that, they deﬁned
the axiomatic form of entropy measure for q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy
sets. Hussain et al. [2] developed a series of operations, score, and accurate
functions together with comparison rule for q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy
sets, and then implemented them in a q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy-based
decision making process.
By considering the reference set X, Yager [8] proposed a q-rung orthopair fuzzy set
(q-ROFS) A on X in terms of two functions uA and vA as follows:
A = {⟨x, uA(x), vA(x)⟩| x ∈X},

q-Rung Orthopair Hesitant Fuzzy Set
where uA(x) and vA(x) are the sets of some different values in [0, 1] and represent
membership and non-membership degrees of the element x ∈X to A, respectively.
Both membership and non-membership degrees satisfy
0 ≤uq
A(x) + vq
A(x) ≤1,
(5.2)
where q > 1, and help to characterize the degree of indeterminacy πA(x) =
q)
1 −uq
A(x) + vq
A(x) for any x ∈X.
It is worth mentioning that any q-ROFS is the generalization of intuitionistic
fuzzy set and Pythagorean fuzzy set. Whenever q = 1, the q-ROFS degenerates
to an intuitionistic fuzzy set, and whenever q = 2, the q-ROFS degenerates to a
Pythagorean fuzzy set.
Given a ﬁxed x ∈X, some operational laws on q-ROFSs are deﬁned as follows
(see [4]):
Ac = {⟨x, vA(x), uA(x)⟩| x ∈X};
A1 ∪A2 = {⟨x, max{uA1(x), uA2(x)}, min{vA1(x), vA2(x)}⟩| x ∈X};
A1 ∩A2 = ,⟨x, min{uA1(x), uA2(x)}, max{vA1(x), vA2(x)}⟩| x ∈X- ;
A1 ⊕A2 =

⟨x, q)
uq
A1(x)+uq
A2(x)−uq
A1(x)×uq
A2(x), vA1(x)×vA2(x)⟩| x ∈X
$
;
A1 ⊗A2 =

⟨x, uA1(x)×uA2(x), q)

A1(x)+vq
A2(x)−vq


⟨x, (uA(x))λ, q)
1 −(1 −vq
A(x))λ, ⟩| x ∈X

,
λ > 0,
where q > 1.
Example 5.1 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
hA(x1) = {(0.2, 0.3)} and hA(x2) = {(0.8, 0.7)}. Clearly, we observe that the
element (0.8, 0.7) cannot be described by using neither intuitionistic fuzzy set nor
Pythagorean fuzzy set, but 0.83 + 0.73 ≤1. This veriﬁes the set 
A that is given by

A = {⟨x1, (0.2, 0.3)⟩, ⟨x2, (0.8, 0.7)⟩}
is a q-ROFS for q ≥3.
Deﬁnition 5.1 ([3]) Let X be a reference set. A q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy set
(q-ROHFS) A on X is deﬁned in terms of two functions uA(x) and vA(x) as follows:
A = {⟨x, uA(x), vA(x)⟩| x ∈X},

where uA(x) and vA(x) are the sets of some different values in [0, 1] and represent
the possible membership degrees and non-membership degrees of the element x ∈
X to A, respectively.
Here, for all x ∈X, if we consider uA(x) = 
γA∈uA(x){γA}, vA(x) =

ηA∈vA(x){ηA}, γA+
∈
u+
A
=

x∈X maxγA∈uA(x){γA} and ηA+
∈
v+
A
=

x∈X maxηA∈vA(x){ηA}, then we conclude that
0 ≤γA, ηA ≤1,
0 ≤(γA+)q + (ηA+)q ≤1,
q ≥1.
For the sake of simplicity, the pair
hA(x) := (uA(x), vA(x)) = (

γA∈uA(x)
{γA},

ηA∈vA(x)
{ηA})
(5.3)
is called the q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy element (q-ROHFE).
Remark 5.1 Throughout this book, the set of all q-ROHFSs on the reference set X
is denoted by q −ROHFS(X).
Before giving the deﬁnition of algebraic operations for q-ROHFSs, let us discuss
more or less about the complement operator for q-ROHFSs. The complement of a
q-ROHFS A, denoted by Ac, is deﬁned in form of
Ac = {⟨x, uc
A(x), vc
A(x)⟩| x ∈X}
=
⎧
⎪⎨
⎪⎩
{⟨x, 
ηA∈vA(x){ηA}, 
γA∈uA(x){γA}⟩|x ∈X}, if
uA ̸= ∅, vA ̸= ∅;
{⟨x, 
γA∈uA(x){1 −γA}, {∅}⟩|x ∈X},
if
uA ̸= ∅, vA = ∅;
{⟨x, {∅}, 
ηA∈vA(x){1 −ηA}⟩|x ∈X},
if
uA = ∅, vA ̸= ∅
such that
0 ≤γAc, ηAc ≤1,
0 ≤(γAc+)q + (ηAc+)q ≤1,
q ≥1.
Example 5.2 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
hA(x1) = (uA(x1), vA(x1)) = ({0.2, 0.7}, {0.8})and hA(x2) = (uA(x2), vA(x2)) =
({0.3, 0.4}, {0.1, 0.6}). Then, hA(xi) for i = 1, 2 are the q-ROHFSs of xi (i = 1, 2)
in the set A, because the relations
(γA+)(x1) = 0.7, (ηA+)(x1) = 0.8;
(γA+)(x2) = 0.4, (ηA+)(x2) = 0.6;
result in
(γA+)2(x1) + (ηA+)2(x1) = 0.73 + 0.83 ≤1;
(γA+)2(x2) + (ηA+)2(x2) = 0.43 + 0.63 ≤1.

q-Rung Orthopair Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Thus, A is a q-ROHFS (with at least q ≥3), and it is denoted by
A = {⟨x1, {0.2, 0.7}, {0.8}⟩, ⟨x2, {0.3, 0.4}, {0.1, 0.6}⟩}.
Remark that for a given q-ROHFE hA ̸= ∅, if uA and vA possess only one value γA
and ηA, respectively, such that 0 ≤γAq + ηAq ≤1, then the q-ROHFS reduces to
an q-ROHFS. If uA ̸= ∅and vA = ∅, then the q-ROHFS reduces to a q-ROFS.
For the q-ROHFEs hA = (uA, vA), hA1 = (uA1, vA1), and hA2 = (uA2, vA2) the
following operations are deﬁned:
(hA)c = (vA, uA);
(5.4)
hA1 ∪hA2 = (uA1 ∪uA2, vA1 ∩vA2);
(5.5)
hA1 ∩hA2 = (uA1 ∩uA2, vA1 ∪vA2);
(5.6)
hA1 ⊕hA2 = (uA1 ⊕uA2, vA1 ⊗vA2);
(5.7)
hA1 ⊗hA2 = (uA1 ⊗uA2, vA1 ⊕vA2),
(5.8)
where
0 ≤(γA+)q + (ηA+)q ≤1,
0 ≤(γA+
1 )q + (ηA+
1 )q ≤1,
0 ≤(γA+
2 )q + (ηA+
2 )q ≤1,
for all q ≥1.
On the basis of the operations deﬁned on q-ROHFEs, some relationships can be
further established for such operations on q-ROHFSs as follows:
A1 ∪A2 =

hA1∈A1,hA2∈A2
hA1 ∪hA2
= {⟨x, uA1(x) ∪uA2(x), vA1(x) ∩vA2(x)⟩|x ∈X},
(5.9)
A1 ∩A2 =

hA1∈A1,hA2∈A2
hA1 ∩hA2
= {⟨x, uA1(x) ∩uA2(x), vA1(x) ∪vA2(x)⟩|x ∈X},
(5.10)
A1 ⊕A2 =

hA1∈A1,hA2∈A2
hA1 ⊕hA2
= {⟨x, uA1(x) ⊕uA2(x), vA1(x) ⊗vA2(x)⟩|x ∈X},
(5.11)
A1 ⊗A2 =

hA1∈A1,hA2∈A2
hA1 ⊗hA2
= {⟨x, uA1(x) ⊗uA2(x), vA1(x) ⊕vA2(x)⟩|x ∈X}.

Interval-Valued q-Rung Orthopair Hesitant Fuzzy Set
In [7], Xu et al. presented some operations, comparison technique, and
aggregation operators of interval-valued q-rung dual hesitant fuzzy sets. Then,
Feng et al. [1] extended the operator of power Hamy mean to operators for
interval-valued q-rung dual hesitant fuzzy sets, called the interval-valued q-
rung dual hesitant fuzzy power Hamy mean and the interval-valued q-rung
dual hesitant fuzzy power weighted Hamy mean. Xu et al. [7] presented a
number of operations and a comparison technique for interval-valued q-rung
dual hesitant fuzzy sets, and then they developed some interval-valued q-rung
dual hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators.

hesitant fuzzy set (IVq-ROHFS) 

A(x) are some different interval values in [0, 1] and represent the
possible interval membership degrees and interval non-membership degrees of the
element x ∈X to the set 

Remark 5.3 It should be mentioned that the concept of IVq-ROHFS is also
referred to as the interval-valued q-rung dual hesitant fuzzy set in some
references [1].
Remark 5.4 In some references (for instance, [5]), the authors use the concept
"dual" in extending the notion of q-rung orthopair fuzzy set to the dual hesitant
q-rung orthopair fuzzy set. This is while, the notion of "dual" is hidden in
the deﬁnition of q-rung orthopair fuzzy set, and so need not to be mentioned
again. Therefore, it is enough to say that only the hesitant q-rung orthopair
fuzzy set, the interval-valued hesitant q-rung orthopair fuzzy set, and so on.

Chapter 6
Probabilistic Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Abstract In this chapter, we ﬁrstly deal with the core of the next concepts, known
as probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set. Then, the dual form of probabilistic hesitant
fuzzy sets is given. We dedicate the next part of this chapter to introduce the notion
of occurring probability of possible values into hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set
and deﬁne probabilistic linguistic hesitant fuzzy set. On the basis of probabilistic
linguistic term set, we get the deﬁnition of probabilistic linguistic dual hesitant
fuzzy set by combining probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy set with dual hesitant fuzzy
linguistic term set. The other extensions of probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set including
interval probabilistic hesitant fuzzy linguistic variable, probabilistic neutrosophic
hesitant fuzzy set, Pythagorean probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set, and q-rung orthopair
probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set will be introduced, and some their corresponding
operations will be given.
6.1
Probabilistic Hesitant Fuzzy Set
If some experts assign the same value for speciﬁed alternative in a hesitant
fuzzy-based decision making, then we cannot determine what their prefer-
ences are. To avoid the loss of hesitant fuzzy information in such a decision
making process, Zhu [26] brought probability to the concept of hesitant
fuzzy set and introduced the probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set. Zhang et al.
[24] developed the probabilistic hesitant fuzzy operations and integrations to
apply in decision making. Song et al. [19] represented a comparison technique
for making the multiple criteria decision making more efﬁciently. Zhou and
Xu [25] deﬁned a probabilistic hesitant fuzzy preference relation, and then,
they tested the consistency of the same for group decision making. Jiang and
Ma [9] developed a number of aggregation operators under arithmetic and
geometric context for probabilistic hesitant fuzzy sets.

Probabilistic Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Deﬁnition 6.1 ([21]) Let X be a reference set. A probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set
(PHFS) A on X is deﬁned in terms of the function hA(x) as follows:
A = {⟨x, hA(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(6.1)
where hA(x) is some different probabilistic values in [0, 1] representing the possible
probabilistic membership degrees of the element x ∈X to the set A, respectively.
Here, for all x ∈X, we have
hA(x) =

⟨γA,℘γA⟩∈hA(x)
{⟨γA, ℘γA⟩},
(6.2)
and it is considered γ +
A ∈
x∈X max{γA(x)} which implies that 0 ≤γA ≤1
together with 0 ≤γ +
A ≤1. Moreover, it holds that &
⟨γA,℘γA⟩∈hA(x) ℘γA = 1 for any
0 ≤℘γA ≤1.
For the sake of simplicity, hA(x) is called as the probabilistic hesitant fuzzy
element (PHFE).
Remark 6.1 Throughout this book, the set of all PHFSs on the reference set X is
denoted by PHFS(X).
Example 6.1 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
hA(x1) = 
⟨γA,℘γA⟩∈hA(x1){⟨γA, ℘γA⟩} = {⟨0.2, 0.7⟩, ⟨0.5, 0.3⟩} and hA(x2) =

⟨γA,℘γA⟩∈hA(x2){⟨γA, ℘γA⟩} = {⟨0.3, 0.2⟩, ⟨0.5, 0.8⟩} be the PHFEs of xi (i = 1, 2)
in the set A, respectively. Thus, hA(x1) and hA(x2) are two PHFEs, and then A can
be considered as a PHFS, i.e.,
A = {⟨x1, {⟨0.2, 0.7⟩, ⟨0.5, 0.3⟩}⟩, ⟨x2, {⟨0.3, 0.2⟩, ⟨0.5, 0.8⟩}⟩}.

Probabilistic Dual Hesitant Fuzzy Set
As a pioneer work concerning on the probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy
set, Hao et al. [8] proposed a class of operational laws and aggregation
operators for probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy sets. Then, they developed
an entropy measure of probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy sets for enhancing
a visual analysis technique. In the sequel, Ren et al. [13] extended TODIM
technique for probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy sets in the application of
enterprise strategic assessment. Further, Garg and Kaur [5] proposed a robust
correlation coefﬁcient for probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy sets. Ren et al. [14]
investigated a strategy selection process with an integrated AHP and VIKOR
technique under probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy set information.
Deﬁnition 6.2 ([8]) Let X be a reference set. A probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy set
(PDHFS) 
A on X is deﬁned in terms of two functions u
A(x) and v
A(x) as follows:

A = {⟨x, u
A(x), v
A(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(6.7)
where u
A(x) and v
A(x) are some different probabilistic values in [0, 1] representing
the possible probabilistic membership degrees and probabilistic non-membership
degrees of the element x ∈X to the set 
A, respectively.
Here, for all x
∈
X, if we take u

Probabilistic Hesitant Fuzzy Set
For the sake of simplicity, h
A(x) = (u

A(x)) is called the probabilistic
dual hesitant fuzzy element (PDHFE).
Remark 6.2 Throughout this book, the set of all PDHFSs on the reference set X is
denoted by PDHFS(X).

respectively. Thus, h
A(x1) and h
A(x2) are two PDHFEs, and then 

Remark 6.3 It should be mentioned that the concept of PDHFS is also
referred to as the dual hesitant fuzzy probability set [3], and the probabilistic
intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy set [23] in some references.
6.3
Probabilistic Linguistic Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Gong et al. [7] presented the probabilistic linguistic hesitant fuzzy preference
relation on the basis of probabilistic linguistic hesitant fuzzy set which not
only provides ﬂexible linguistic expression for decision makers but also gives
the occurrence probability of each element in the probabilistic linguistic
hesitant fuzzy preference relation. Zhao and Huang [22] developed the notions
of score and variance functions for probabilistic linguistic hesitant fuzzy sets
together with a set of basic operations. Then, they implemented a probabilistic
linguistic hesitant fuzzy-based distance measure in multiple criteria decision
making.
Deﬁnition 6.3 ([10]) Let X be a reference set, and S = {sα | α = 0, 1, . . ., τ} be
a linguistic term set. A probabilistic linguistic hesitant fuzzy set (PLHFS) on X is
mathematically shown in terms of
AS = {⟨x, hAS(x)⟩| x ∈X}.
(6.12)
Here, hAS(x) is a set of some possible pairs of linguistic term set S together
with probabilistic values which can be characterized in the form of
hAS(x) = ⟨sα(x),

⟨γAS,℘γAS ⟩∈hAS(x)
{⟨γAS, ℘γAS ⟩}⟩,
(6.13)
where sα(x) ∈S denotes the linguistic terms involved in hAS(x).

84

Probabilistic Hesitant Fuzzy Set
The notation hAS(x) is called hereafter probabilistic linguistic hesitant fuzzy set
(PLHFE) on X.
Remark 6.4 Throughout this book, the set of all PLHFSs on the reference set X is
denoted by PLHFS(X).
Example 6.3 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set, hAS(x1) = ⟨s2, {⟨0.2, 0.3⟩,
⟨0.4, 0.6⟩, ⟨0.5, 0.1⟩}⟩and hAS(x2) = ⟨s1, {⟨0.3, 0.5⟩, ⟨0.4, 0.5⟩}⟩be the PLHFEs
of x (i = 1, 2) to a set AS, respectively. Then AS can be considered as a PLHFS,
i.e.,
AS = {⟨x1, ⟨s2, {⟨0.2, 0.3⟩, ⟨0.4, 0.6⟩, ⟨0.5, 0.1⟩}⟩⟩,
⟨x2, ⟨s1, {⟨0.3, 0.5⟩, ⟨0.4, 0.5⟩}⟩⟩}.

6.4
Probabilistic Linguistic Dual Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Based on the probabilistic linguistic term set proposed by Pang et al. [12],
Gong and Chen [6] gave the deﬁnition of probabilistic linguistic dual hesitant
fuzzy set by combining the concept of probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy set
with the concept of dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set.
Deﬁnition 6.4 ([6]) Let X be a reference set and S = {sα | α = 0, 1, . . ., τ} be a
linguistic term set. A probabilistic linguistic dual hesitant fuzzy set (PLDHFS) AS
on X is deﬁned in terms of two functions uAS(x) and vAS(x) as follows:
AS = {⟨x, sα(x), uAS(x), vAS(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(6.21)
where uAS(x) and vAS(x) are some different probabilistic values in [0, 1] rep-
resenting the possible probabilistic membership degrees and probabilistic non-
membership degrees of the element x ∈X to the set AS, respectively. Furthermore,
sα(x) ∈S denotes the linguistic terms involved in AS(x).

86
6
Probabilistic Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Here, for all x ∈X, if we consider uAS(x) = 
⟨γAS,℘γAS ⟩∈uAS(x){⟨γAS, ℘γAS⟩},
vAS(x) = 
⟨ηAS,℘ηAS ⟩∈vAS(x){⟨ηAS, ℘ηAS ⟩}, γAS+ ∈
x∈X max{γAS(x)} and
ηAS+ ∈
x∈X max{ηAS(x)}, then we conclude that
0 ≤γAS, ηAS ≤1,
0 ≤γAS+ + ηAS+ ≤1.
Moreover, we have &
⟨γAS,℘γAS ⟩∈uAS(x) ℘γAS = &
⟨ηAS,℘ηAS ⟩∈vAS(x) ℘ηAS = 1
for any 0 ≤℘γAS, ℘ηAS ≤1.
For the sake of simplicity, hAS(x) = (sα(x), uAS(x), vAS(x)) is called the
probabilistic linguistic dual hesitant fuzzy element (PLDHFE).
Remark 6.5 Throughout this book, the set of all PLDHFSs on the reference set X
is denoted by PLDHFS(X).
Example 6.4 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set and S = {sα | α = 0, 1, . . ., 5}.
We suppose that
hAS(x1) = (sα1, 
⟨γAS,℘γAS ⟩∈uAS(x1){⟨γAS, ℘γAS ⟩}, 
⟨ηAS,℘ηAS ⟩∈vAS(x1)
{⟨ηAS, ℘ηAS⟩}) = (s1, {⟨0.2, 0.7⟩, ⟨0.5, 0.3⟩}, {⟨0.7, 1⟩}) and
hAS(x2) = (sα2, 
⟨γAS,℘γAS ⟩∈uAS(x2){⟨γAS, ℘γAS ⟩},

⟨ηAS,℘ηAS ⟩∈vAS(x2){⟨ηAS, ℘ηAS ⟩})
= (s3, {⟨0.3, 0.2⟩, ⟨0.5, 0.8⟩}, {⟨0.2, 1⟩}) are two PLDHFEs of xi (i = 1, 2) in the
set AS, respectively. Thus, hAS(x1) and hAS(x2) are two PLDHFEs, and then AS
can be considered as a PLDHFS, i.e.,
AS = {⟨x1, (s1, {⟨0.2, 0.7⟩, ⟨0.5, 0.3⟩}, {⟨0.7, 1⟩})⟩,
⟨x2, (s3, {⟨0.3, 0.2⟩, ⟨0.5, 0.8⟩}, {⟨0.2, 1⟩})⟩}.

Probabilistic Hesitant Fuzzy Set

Interval Probability Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Variable
Xian et al. [20] introduced the interval probability hesitant fuzzy linguistic
variable by taking the concept of hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set as the
evaluation part together with a novel element-reliability of evaluation. They
also gave the deﬁnition of operation rules and comparison techniques for
interval probability hesitant fuzzy linguistic variables.
Deﬁnition 6.5 ([20]) Let X be a reference set, and S
=
{sα | α
=
−τ, . . . , −1, 0, 1, . . . , τ} be a linguistic term set. An interval probability hesitant
fuzzy linguistic variable (IPHFLV) on X is mathematically shown in terms of
AS = {⟨x, hAS(x)⟩| x ∈X}.
(6.26)
Here, hAS(x) is a set of some possible pairs of linguistic term set S together
with probabilistic values which can be characterized by
hAS(x) =

⟨sα,[℘LγAS ,℘UγAS ]⟩∈hAS(x)
⟨{sα}, [℘L
γAS , ℘U
γAS ]⟩,
(6.27)
where sα ∈S denotes the linguistic terms involved in hAS(x).
Remark 6.6 Throughout this book, the set of all IPHFLVs on the reference set X is
denoted by IPHFLV(X).
Example 6.5 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
hAS(x1) = ⟨{s−1, s0, s1}, [0.6, 0.8]⟩and hAS(x2) = ⟨{s0, s1, s2}, [0.7, 0.8]⟩be the
IPHFLVs of xi (i = 1, 2) to a set AS, respectively. Then AS can be considered as
a IPHFLV, i.e.,
AS = {⟨x1, ⟨{s−1, s0, s1}, [0.6, 0.8]⟩⟩, ⟨x2, ⟨{s0, s1, s2}, [0.7, 0.8]⟩⟩}.
Given three IPHFLVs represented by

Probabilistic Neutrosophic Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Shao et al. [16] presented probabilistic neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set, and
they investigated the operation laws together with the averaging and geometric
operators for probabilistic neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy sets. Furthermore,
Shao et al. [17] developed Shao et al.’s [16] Choquet averaging and Choquet
geometric operators for probabilistic neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy sets.
Deﬁnition 6.6 ([15]) Let X be a reference set. A probabilistic neutrosophic hesitant
fuzzy set (PNHFS) A on X is deﬁned in terms of three functions uA(x), wA(x), and
vA(x) as follows:
A = {⟨x, ⟨uA(x), wA(x), vA(x)⟩⟩| x ∈X},
(6.32)
where uA(x), wA(x), vA(x) ∈[0, 1] are, respectively, called truth, indeterminacy,
and falsity membership degrees of the element x
∈
X to A corresponding
to their probabilistic information of factors in the forms of uA(x)

Remark 6.7 Throughout this book, the set of all PNHFSs on the reference set X is
denoted by PNHFS(X).
Example 6.6 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
hA(x1)
=
{⟨{⟨0.2, 0.7⟩, ⟨0.3, 0.3⟩}, {⟨0.4, 0.5⟩, ⟨0.3, 0.5⟩}, {⟨0.3, 1.0⟩}⟩} and
hA(x2)
=
{⟨{⟨0.2, 1.0⟩}, {⟨0.3, 0.5⟩, ⟨0.4, 0.5⟩}, {⟨0.3, 0.2⟩, ⟨0.6, 0.8⟩}⟩} be the
PNHFEs of xi (i = 1, 2) to a set A, respectively. Then A can be considered as an
PNHFS, i.e.,
A = {⟨x1, ⟨{⟨0.2, 0.7⟩, ⟨0.3, 0.3⟩}, {⟨0.4, 0.5⟩, ⟨0.3, 0.5⟩}, {⟨0.3, 1.0⟩}⟩,

Pythagorean Probabilistic Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Batool et al. [1] introduced the concept of Pythagorean probabilistic hesitant
fuzzy set with the constraint that the square sum of positive and negative
hesitant membership degrees is less than or equal to one. Batool et al. [2]
established a multiple criteria decision making technique on the basis of
EDAS approach under Pythagorean probabilistic hesitant fuzzy information,
and further, they developed an algorithm for addressing the uncertainty in
the selection of drugs in EmDM issues in correspondence with the clinical
analysis.
Deﬁnition 6.7 ([1]) Let X be a reference set. A Pythagorean probabilistic hesitant
fuzzy set (PPHFS) ´A on X is deﬁned in terms of two functions u ´A(x) and v ´A(x) as
follows:
´A = {⟨x, u ´A(x), v ´A(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(6.39)
where u ´A(x) and v ´A(x) are some different probabilistic values in [0, 1] representing
the possible probabilistic membership degrees and probabilistic non-membership
degrees of the element x ∈X to the set ´A, respectively.
Here, for all x
∈
X, if we take u ´A(x)
=

⟨γ ´A,℘γ ´A⟩∈u ´A(x){⟨γ ´A, ℘γ ´A⟩},
v ´A(x) = 
⟨η ´A,℘η ´A⟩∈v ´A(x){⟨η ´A, ℘η ´A⟩}, γ ´A
+ ∈
x∈X max{γ ´A(x)} and η ´A
+ ∈

x∈X max{η ´A(x)}, then we ﬁnd that
0 ≤γ ´A, η ´A ≤1,
0 ≤(γ ´A
+)2 + (η ´A
+)2 ≤1.
Moreover, &
⟨γ ´A,℘γ ´A⟩∈u ´A(x) ℘γ ´A
=
&
⟨η ´A,℘η ´A⟩∈v ´A(x) ℘η ´A
=
1 for any 0
≤
℘γ ´A, ℘η ´A ≤1.
For the sake of simplicity, h ´A(x) = (u ´A(x), v ´A(x)) is called the Pythagorean
probabilistic hesitant fuzzy element (PPHFE).

Pythagorean Probabilistic Hesitant Fuzzy Set

Remark 6.8 Throughout this book, the set of all PPHFSs on the reference set X is
denoted by PPHFS(X).
Example 6.7 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
h ´A(x1) = (
⟨γ ´A,℘γ ´A⟩∈u ´A(x1){⟨γ ´A, ℘γ ´A⟩}, 
⟨η ´A,℘η ´A⟩∈v ´A(x1){⟨η ´A, ℘η ´A⟩}
= ({⟨0.2, 0.7⟩, ⟨0.5, 0.3⟩}, {⟨0.7, 1⟩}) and
h ´A(x2) = (
⟨γ ´A,℘γ ´A⟩∈u ´A(x2){⟨γ ´A, ℘γ ´A⟩}, 
⟨η ´A,℘η ´A⟩∈v ´A(x2){⟨η ´A, ℘η ´A⟩}
= ({⟨0.3, 0.2⟩, ⟨0.5, 0.8⟩}, {⟨0.2, 1⟩}) be the PDHFEs of xi (i = 1, 2) in the set ´A,
respectively. In this case,
(γ ´A
+)(x1) = 0.5, (η ´A
+)(x1) = 0.7;
(γ ´A
+)(x2) = 0.5, (η ´A
+)(x2) = 0.2;
result in
(γ ´A
+)2(x1) + (η ´A
+)2(x1) = 0.52 + 0.72 ≤1;
(γ ´A
+)2(x2) + (η ´A
+)2(x2) = 0.52 + 0.22 ≤1.
Thus, h ´A(x1) and h ´A(x2) are two PPHFEs, and then ´A can be considered as a
PPHFS, i.e.,
´A = {⟨x1, ({⟨0.2, 0.7⟩, ⟨0.5, 0.3⟩}, {⟨0.7, 1⟩})⟩,
⟨x2, ({⟨0.3, 0.2⟩, ⟨0.5, 0.8⟩}, {⟨0.2, 1⟩})⟩}.
For the PPHFEs
h ´A = (u ´A, v ´A) = (
⟨γ ´A,℘γ ´A⟩∈u ´A{⟨γ ´A, ℘γ ´A⟩}, 

q-Rung Orthopair Probabilistic Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Li et al. [11] introduced the concept of q-rung probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy
set by the use of capturing the probability of each element in q-rung dual
hesitant fuzzy sets. Q-rung probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy set is indeed q-
rung probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set. The most prominent character of q-rung
probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy set is that it allows experts to have a ﬂexible
manner for evaluating criterion values in a complicated and realistic multiple
criteria decision making situation. In order to more effectively exploit the
opportunities for applying q-rung probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy sets, Li
et al. [11] proposed some basic operational rules, comparison technique and
distance measure of q-rung probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy sets.

q-Rung Orthopair Probabilistic Hesitant Fuzzy Set

Deﬁnition 6.8 ([11]) Let X be a reference set. A q-rung orthopair probabilistic
hesitant fuzzy set (q-ROPHFS) `A on X is deﬁned in terms of two functions u `A(x)
and v `A(x) as follows:
`A = {⟨x, u `A(x), v `A(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(6.44)
where u `A(x) and v `A(x) are some different probabilistic values in [0, 1] representing
the possible probabilistic membership degrees and probabilistic non-membership
degrees of the element x ∈X to the set `A, respectively.
Here, for all x ∈X, if we consider u `A(x) = 
⟨γ `A,℘γ `A⟩∈u `A(x){⟨γ `A, ℘γ `A⟩},
v `A(x) = 
⟨η `A,℘η `A⟩∈v `A(x){⟨η `A, ℘η `A⟩}, γ `A
+ ∈
x∈X max{γ `A(x)} and η `A
+ ∈

x∈X max{η `A(x)}, then we conclude that
0 ≤γ `A, η `A ≤1,
0 ≤(γ `A
+)q + (η `A
+)q ≤1,
q ≥1.
Moreover, &
⟨γ `A,℘γ `A⟩∈u `A(x) ℘γ `A
=
&
⟨η `A,℘η `A⟩∈v `A(x) ℘η `A
=
1 for any 0
≤
℘γ `A, ℘η `A ≤1.
For the sake of simplicity, h `A(x) = (u `A(x), v `A(x)) is called the q-rung orthopair
probabilistic hesitant fuzzy element (q-ROPHFE).
Remark 6.9 Throughout this book, the set of all q-ROPHFSs on the reference set X
is denoted by q −ROPHFS(X).
Example 6.8 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
h `A(x1) = (
⟨γ `A,℘γ `A⟩∈u `A(x1){⟨γ `A, ℘γ `A⟩}, 
⟨η `A,℘η `A⟩∈v `A(x1){⟨η `A, ℘η `A⟩}
= ({⟨0.2, 0.7⟩, ⟨0.8, 0.3⟩}, {⟨0.7, 1⟩}) and
h `A(x2) = (
⟨γ `A,℘γ `A⟩∈u `A(x2){⟨γ `A, ℘γ `A⟩}, 
⟨η `A,℘η `A⟩∈v `A(x2){⟨η `A, ℘η `A⟩}
= ({⟨0.3, 0.2⟩, ⟨0.5, 0.8⟩}, {⟨0.2, 1⟩}) be the q-ROPHFEs of xi (i = 1, 2) in the set
`A, respectively. In this case,
(γ `A
+)(x1) = 0.8, (η `A
+)(x1) = 0.7;
(γ `A
+)(x2) = 0.5, (η `A
+)(x2) = 0.2;
result in
(γ `A
+)q(x1) + (η `A
+)q(x1) = 0.8q + 0.7q ≤1;
(γ `A
+)q(x2) + (η `A
+)q(x2) = 0.5q + 0.2q ≤1,

then `A can be considered as a q-ROPHFS, i.e.,

⟨x2, ({⟨0.3, 0.2⟩, ⟨0.5, 0.8⟩}, {⟨0.2, 1⟩})⟩}.

Chapter 7
Type 2 Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Abstract In this chapter, we are ﬁrstly going to present the notion of type 2 hesitant
fuzzy set. Then, the interval-valued type 2 hesitant fuzzy set, which is also known
as interval type 2 hesitant fuzzy set, will be given in the next part of this chapter.
7.1
Type 2 Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Feng et al. [3] presented the notion of type 2 hesitant fuzzy set as a family
of subsets of the Cartesian product [0, 1] × [0, 1]. Then, they investigated an
ordering relation among type 2 hesitant fuzzy sets. In the sequel, Ozlu and
Karaaslan [5] mentioned the limitations of Feng et al.’s [3] ordering relation,
and they gave a modiﬁed type 2 hesitant fuzzy set ordering relation.
Deﬁnition 7.1 ([3]) Let X be a reference set. A type 2 hesitant fuzzy set (T2HFS)
A on X is deﬁned in terms of a function hA(x) as follows:
A = {⟨x, hA(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(7.1)
where hA(x) contains some different values in [0, 1] × [0, 1] representing a set of
determined number of dual membership functions as
hA(x) =

⟨γA(x),ψ(γA(x))⟩∈hA(x)
{⟨γA(x), ψ(γA(x))⟩}.
(7.2)
The empty and full T2HFSs are deﬁned in the forms of
h0
A(x) = {⟨0, 0⟩},
(7.3)
h1
A(x) = {⟨1, 1⟩},
(7.4)
for any x ∈X.

Type 2 Hesitant Fuzzy Set
To facilitate the comparison rule of T2HFSs, the comparison of two-dimensional
coordinate points is taken into consideration as follows (see [3]):
•
(x1, y1) ≤(x2, y2) if and only if x1 ≤x2 and y1 ≤y2;
•
max{(x1, y1), (x2, y2)} = (max{x1, x2}, max{y1, y2}).
For the sake of simplicity, hA(x) is called the type 2 hesitant fuzzy element
(T2HFE).
Remark 7.1 Throughout this book, the set of all T2HFSs on the reference set X is
denoted by T2HFS(X).
Given a T2HFS, the concept of lower, upper, α-lower, and α-upper bounds are
represented as:
•
Lower
bound:
h−
A(x)
=

⟨γA−(x),ψ(γA−(x))⟩∈h−
A(x){⟨min{γA(x)},
min{ψ(γA(x))}⟩};
•
Upper
bound:
h+
A(x)
=

⟨γA+(x),ψ(γA+(x))⟩∈h+
A(x){⟨max{γA(x)},
max{ψ(γA(x))}⟩};
•
[α, β]-Lower bound: h−
A[α,β](x) = 
⟨γA(x),ψ(γA(x))⟩∈hA(x){⟨γA(x), ψ(γA(x))⟩|
γA(x) ≤α, ψ(γA(x)) ≤β};
•
[α, β]-Upper bound: h+
A[α,β](x) = 
⟨γA(x),ψ(γA(x))⟩∈hA(x){⟨γA(x), ψ(γA(x))⟩|
γA(x) ≥α, ψ(γA(x)) ≥β}.
Example 7.1 Let X = {x} be the reference set,
hA(x) = 
⟨γA(x),ψ(γA(x))⟩∈hA(x){⟨γA(x), ψ(γA(x))⟩}
= 
⟨γA(x),ψ(γA(x))⟩∈hA(x){⟨0.2, 0.5⟩, ⟨0.4, 0.6⟩, ⟨0.6, 0.4⟩} be the T2HFEs of x
in the set A. Then, we have h−
A(x) = {⟨0.2, 0.4}⟩}, h+
A(x) = {⟨0.6, 0.6}⟩},
h−
A[0.3,0.5](x) = {⟨0.2, 0.5}⟩}, and h+
A[0.3,0.5](x) = {⟨0.4, 0.6}⟩}.
For the T2HFEs hA = 
⟨γA,ψ(γA)⟩∈hA{⟨γA, ψ(γA)⟩},
hA1
= 
⟨γA1,ψ(γA1)⟩∈hA1{⟨γA1, ψ(γA1)⟩} and hA2
= 
⟨γA2,ψ(γA2)⟩∈hA2{⟨γA2,
ψ(γA2)⟩} the following operations are deﬁned (see [3]):
hAc =

⟨γA,ψ(γA)⟩∈hA
{⟨1 −γA, 1 −ψ(γA)⟩};
(7.5)
hA1 ∪hA2 =

⟨γ ∪,ψ(γ ∪)⟩∈hA1∪hA2
{⟨γ ∪, ψ(γ ∪)⟩| ⟨γ ∪, ψ(γ ∪)⟩≥max{h−
A1, h−
A2}};
(7.6)
hA1 ∩hA2 =

⟨γ ∩,ψ(γ ∩)⟩∈hA1∩hA2
{⟨γ ∩, ψ(γ ∩)⟩| ⟨γ ∩, ψ(γ ∩)⟩≤min{h+
A1, h+
A2}}.
(7.7)

7.2
Interval Type 2 Hesitant Fuzzy Set
101
Example 7.2 Let X = {x} be the reference set,
hA1(x) = 
⟨γA1(x),ψ(γA1(x))⟩∈hA1{⟨γA1(x), ψ(γA1(x))⟩} = {⟨0.2, 0.5⟩, ⟨0.4, 0.6⟩,
⟨0.6, 0.4⟩} and hA2(x)
=

⟨γA2(x),ψ(γA2(x))⟩∈hA2{⟨γA2(x), ψ(γA2(x))⟩}
=
{⟨0.3, 0.4⟩, ⟨0.4, 0.5⟩} be two T2HFEs. Then, we achieve that h−
A1(x)
=
{⟨0.2, 0.4}⟩},
h+
A1(x)
=
{⟨0.6, 0.6}⟩},
h−
A2(x)
=
{⟨0.3, 0.4}⟩},
and h+
A2(x) = {⟨0.4, 0.5}⟩}. Therefore,
max{h−
A1, h−
A2} = {⟨0.3, 0.4}⟩};
min{h+
A1, h+
A2} = {⟨0.4, 0.5}⟩}.
Keeping the set operations in the mind, we get
hAc
1(x) = {⟨0.8, 0.5⟩, ⟨0.6, 0.4⟩, ⟨0.4, 0.6⟩};
hA1 ∪hA2 = {⟨0.4, 0.6⟩, ⟨0.6, 0.4⟩, ⟨0.3, 0.4⟩, ⟨0.4, 0.5⟩};
hA1 ∩hA2 = {⟨0.2, 0.5⟩, ⟨0.3, 0.4⟩, ⟨0.4, 0.5⟩}.
7.2
Interval Type 2 Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Hu et al. [4] presented the concept of interval type-2 hesitant fuzzy set as a
generalization of interval type-2 fuzzy set and hesitant fuzzy set. Then, they
developed a number of interval type-2 hesitant fuzzy set operation laws, score
function, and aggregation operators. Deveci [2] investigated a multiple criteria
decision making technique under interval type-2 hesitant fuzzy environment
for assessing the quality service of airline companies.
By taking the reference set X into account, a trapezoidal interval Type 2 fuzzy
number (TIT2FN) 
A on X is deﬁned in terms of two lower and upper trapezoidal
membership functions as (see [1]):

A =

Chapter 8
Hesitant Bipolar Fuzzy Set
Abstract In this chapter, we ﬁrst introduce the concept of hesitant bipolar fuzzy
set. Then, we deal with the concept that comes from bipolar concept, and it is
stated more or less different from the concept of hesitant bipolar fuzzy set. Indeed,
we are going to introduce the concept of hesitant bipolar-valued fuzzy set. In the
subsequent part of this chapter, we will represent the concept of hesitant bipolar-
valued neutrosophic set.
8.1
Hesitant Bipolar Fuzzy Set
Wei et al. [5] introduced a set of aggregation operators for aggregating hesitant
bipolar fuzzy sets and utilized them in hesitant bipolar fuzzy multiple criteria
decision making problems. Since the concept of hesitant fuzzy set cannot
accommodate incompatible bipolarity, Han et al. [4] represented the concept
of hesitant bipolar fuzzy set involved in a multiple criteria decision making
technique which has been enhanced by the adoption of TOPSIS approach. Xu
and Wei [6] presented the concept of dual hesitant bipolar fuzzy set, which
is indeed nothing else, except the concept of hesitant bipolar fuzzy set, and
developed a class of hesitant bipolar fuzzy set aggregation operators. Gao
et al. [2] in the same line of Xu and Wei [6] investigated multiple criteria
decision making problems by using the Hamacher aggregation operators
under the dual hesitant bipolar fuzzy environment.
Before dealing with the main concepts of combination of bipolar and hesitant fuzzy
notions, let us introduce the concept of bipolar fuzzy set: keeping the reference set
X in mind, a bipolar fuzzy set (BFS) A on X is deﬁned in terms of two functions
uA and vA as follows [7]:
A = {⟨x, (uA(x), vA(x))⟩| x ∈X},

Hesitant Bipolar Fuzzy Set
where uA(x) and vA(x) are, respectively, the sets of some different values in [0, 1]
and [−1, 0], and moreover, they represent positive membership degree and negative
membership degree of the element x ∈X to A, respectively. The positive and
negative membership degrees satisfy
0 ≤uA(x) ≤1,
−1 ≤vA(x) ≤0.
(8.2)
Given a ﬁxed x ∈X, some operational laws on BFSs are deﬁned as follows [3]:
Ac = {⟨x, (1 −uA(x), |vA(x)| −1)⟩| x ∈X};
A1 ∪A2 = {⟨x, (max{uA1(x), uA2(x)}, min{vA1(x), vA2(x)})⟩| x ∈X};
A1 ∩A2 = {⟨x, (min{uA1(x), uA2(x)}, max{vA1(x), vA2(x)})⟩| x ∈X};
A1 ⊕A2 = {⟨x, (uA1(x) + uA2(x) −uA1(x) × uA2(x),
−|vA1(x)| × |vA2(x)|)⟩| x ∈X};
A1 ⊗A2 = {⟨x, (uA1(x) × uA2(x), vA1(x) + vA2(x)
−vA1(x) × vA2(x))⟩| x ∈X};
λA = {⟨x, (1 −(1 −uA(x))λ, −|vA(x)|λ)⟩| x ∈X},
λ > 0;
Aλ = {⟨x, (|uA(x)|λ, −1 + |1 + vA(x)|λ)⟩| x ∈X},
λ > 0.
Example 8.1 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
(uA(x1), vA(x1)) = {(0.2, −0.3)} and (uA(x2), vA(x2)) = {(0.4, −0.8)}. With
respect to these two terms, the set A can be considered as an BFS where
A = {⟨x1, (0.2, −0.3)⟩, ⟨x2, (0.4, −0.8)⟩}.
Deﬁnition 8.1 ([5]) Let X be a reference set. A bipolar hesitant fuzzy set (BHFS)
A on X is deﬁned in terms of two functions uA(x) and vA(x) as follows:
A = {⟨x, uA(x), vA(x)⟩| x ∈X},
where the positive membership degree uA(x) ∈[0, 1] indicates the possible
satisfaction degree of an element x ∈X to the property corresponding to A, and
the negative membership degree vA(x) ∈[−1, 0] indicates the possible satisfaction
degree of an element x ∈X to some implicit counter property corresponding to A.
Here, for all x ∈X, if we consider uA(x) = 
γA∈uA(x){γA} and vA(x) =

ηA∈vA(x){ηA}, then we have
0 ≤γA ≤1,
−1 ≤ηA ≤0.

Hesitant Bipolar Fuzzy Set

For the sake of simplicity, the pair hA(x) = (uA(x), vA(x)) is called the bipolar
hesitant fuzzy element (BHFE).
Notice that hA = (uA, vA) stands here for hA = 
γA∈uA
ηA∈vA{(γA, ηA)}.
Remark 8.1 Throughout this book, the set of all BHFSs on the reference set X is
denoted by BHFS(X).
Example 8.2 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
hA(x1)
=
(uA(x1), vA(x1))
=
{(0.2, −0.5), (0.2, −0.3)} and hA(x2)
=
(uA(x2), vA(x2))
=
{(0.3, −0.4), (0.1, −0.6), (0.1, −0.8)}), then hA(xi) for
i = 1, 2 are the BHFEs of xi (i = 1, 2) in the set A. Thus, A is a BHFS, and
it is denoted by
A = {⟨x1, {(0.2, −0.5), (0.2, −0.3)}, ⟩,
⟨x2, {(0.3, −0.4), (0.1, −0.6), (0.1, −0.8)}⟩}.
For the BHFEs hA = (uA, vA), hA1 = (uA1, vA1), and hA2 = (uA2, vA2) the
following operations are deﬁned (see [5]):
hA1 ⊕hA2 = (uA1 ⊕B uA2, vA1 ⊗B vA2)
=

γA1∈uA1,ηA1∈vA1
γA2∈uA2,ηA2∈vA2
{(γA1 + γA2 −γA1 × γA2, −|ηA1||ηA2|)};
(8.3)
hA1 ⊗hA2 = (uA1 ⊗B uA2, vA1 ⊕B vA2)
=

γA1∈uA1,ηA1∈vA1
γA2∈uA2,ηA2∈vA2
{(γA1 × γA2, ηA1 + ηA2 −ηA1 × ηA2)},
(8.4)
λhA =

γA∈uA,ηA∈vA
{(1 −(1 −γA)λ, −|ηA|λ)},

{(γAλ, −1 + |1 + ηA|λ)},

Hesitant Bipolar Fuzzy Set
8.2
Hesitant Bipolar-Valued Fuzzy Set
Mandal and Ranadive [2] presented two distinguished aspects: one that
deﬁnes the concept of hesitant bipolar-valued fuzzy set, and the other that
deﬁnes the concept of bipolar-valued hesitant fuzzy set. The former concept is
the combination of the concept of bipolar-valued fuzzy set and hesitant fuzzy
set. The latter concept extends the concept of hesitant fuzzy set, by injecting
the concept of bipolar-valued fuzzy set. The fundamental characteristic of
hesitant bipolar-valued fuzzy set is the values of the positive membership
function and the negative membership function which are set of positive
numbers and negative numbers rather than exact positive number and negative
number. The fundamental characteristic of bipolar-valued hesitant fuzzy set is
the values of the membership function which is a set of bipolar-valued fuzzy
numbers rather than set of exact numbers.
Deﬁnition 8.2 ([2]) Let X be a reference set. A hesitant bipolar-valued fuzzy set
(HBVFS) 
A on X is deﬁned in terms of two functions u
A(x) and v
A(x) as follows:

A = {⟨x, u
A(x), v
A(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(8.7)
where the hesitant fuzzy positive element u
A(x) is a set of some values in [0, 1]
indicating the possible satisfaction degree of an element x ∈X to the property
corresponding to 
A, and the hesitant fuzzy negative element v
A(x) is a set of some
values in [−1, 0] indicating the possible satisfaction degree of an element x ∈X to
some implicit counter property corresponding to 
A.
Here, for all x ∈X, if we take u
A(x) = 
γ
A∈u
A(x){γ
A} and v
A(x) =

η
A∈v
A(x){η
A}, then we have
0 ≤γ
A ≤1,
−1 ≤η
A ≤0.
For the sake of simplicity, the pair h
A(x) = (u
A(x), v
A(x)) is called the hesitant
bipolar-valued fuzzy element (HBVFE).
Remark 8.2 Throughout this book, the set of all HBVFSs on the reference set X is
denoted by HBVFS(X).
Example 8.3 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
h
A(x1)
=
(u
A(x1), v
A(x1))
=
({0.2}, {−0.5 −0.3}) and h
A(x2)
=
(u
A(x2), v
A(x2)) = ({0.3, 0.1}, {−0.4, −0.6, −0.8}), then h
A(xi) for i = 1, 2
are the HBVFEs of xi (i = 1, 2) in the set 
A. Thus, 
A is a HBVFS, and it is denoted
by

A = {⟨x1, ({0.2}, {−0.5, −0.3})⟩, ⟨x2, ({0.3, 0.1}, {−0.4, −0.6, −0.8})⟩}.

Hesitant Bipolar-Valued Neutrosophic Set
Awang et al [1] presented the concept of hesitant bipolar-valued neutrosophic
set by combing the nations of bipolar neutrosophic set and hesitant fuzzy set.
The presented notion indeed generalizes the notions of fuzzy set, intuitionistic
fuzzy set, hesitant fuzzy set, single-valued neutrosophic set, single-valued
neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set, bipolar fuzzy set and bipolar neutrosophic
set. Furthermore, Awang et al [1] gave a number of basic operational laws,
union, intersection, complement and two aggregation operators for hesitant
bipolar-valued neutrosophic sets.
Deﬁnition 8.3 ([1]) Let X be a reference set. A hesitant bipolar-valued neutro-
sophic set (HBVNS) A on X is deﬁned in terms of six functions u−
A(x), u+
A(x),
w−
A(x), w+
A(x), v−
A(x), and v+
A(x) as follows:
A = {⟨x, u+
A(x), w+
A(x), v+
A(x), u−
A(x), w−
A(x), v−
A(x), ⟩| x ∈X},
(8.15)
where the positive hesitant bipolar-valued neutrosophic sets u+
A(x), w+
A(x), v+
A(x) ∈
[0, 1] indicate, respectively, the possible satisfactory degree of truth, indeterminacy,
and falsity of the element x ∈X corresponding to A, and also, the negative
hesitant bipolar-valued neutrosophic sets u−
A(x), w−
A(x), v−
A(x) ∈[−1, 0] indicate,
respectively, the possible satisfactory degree of truth, indeterminacy, and falsity of
the element x ∈X to the implicit counter property to the set A. Furthermore,
0 ≤max{u+
A(x)} + max{w+
A(x)} + max{v+
A(x)} ≤3 and −3 ≤max{u−
A(x)} +
max{w−
A(x)} + max{v−
A(x)} ≤0 for any x ∈X.
For the sake of simplicity, hA(x) = (u+
A(x), w+
A(x), v+
A(x), u−
A(x), w−
A(x),
v−
A(x)) is called the hesitant bipolar-valued neutrosophic element (HBVNE).
Remark 8.3 Throughout this book, the set of all HBVNSs on the reference set X is
denoted by HBVNS(X).
Example 8.4 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
hA(x1) = {⟨{0.2, 0.3}, {0.4}, {0.3}, {−0.1}, {−0.3}, {−0.6, −0.5}⟩} and hA(x2) =
{⟨{0.3}, {0.5}, {0.6, 0.7, 0.8}, {−0.1}, {−0.5}, {−0.2, −0.7, −0.9}⟩} be the HBV-
NSs of xi (i = 1, 2) to a set A, respectively. Then A can be considered as an
HBVNS, i.e.,
A = {⟨x1, ⟨{0.2, 0.3}, {0.4}, {0.3}, {−0.1}, {−0.3}, {−0.6, −0.5}⟩,
⟨x2, ⟨{0.3}, {0.5}, {0.6, 0.7, 0.8}, {−0.1}, {−0.5}, {−0.2, −0.7, −0.9}⟩}.

Chapter 9
Cubic Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Abstract In this chapter, we ﬁrst introduce the concept of cubic hesitant fuzzy set.
Then, we present the form that in which cubic hesitant fuzzy set is characterized in
the form of triangular, and it is known as triangular cubic hesitant fuzzy set. In the
next part of this chapter, we deal with the deﬁnition of linguistic intuitionistic cubic
hesitant variable.
9.1
Cubic Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Fu et al. [1] expressed the hybrid information of both cubic fuzzy set and
hesitant fuzzy set, and called it cubic hesitant fuzzy set. They then studied
the generalized form of distance and similarity measures of cubic hesitant
fuzzy sets. Yong et al. [8] developed a Jaccard similarity measure for cubic
hesitant fuzzy sets and implemented it in a multiple criteria decision making
technique under cubic hesitant environment. Mahmood et al. [6] investigated
and discussed about the concepts of internal (or external) cubic hesitant fuzzy
set, P(or R)-union, P(or R)-intersection of cubic hesitant fuzzy sets, P(or R)-
addition, and P(or R)-multiplication of cubic hesitant fuzzy sets.
The concept of cubic fuzzy set A on X is deﬁned as (see [5])
A = {⟨x, ιA(x), γA(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(9.1)
in which ιA(x) = [ιL
A, ιU
A] is an interval-valued fuzzy number and γA(x) is a unique
fuzzy value for the element x ∈X.

Cubic Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Suppose that for any x ∈X, A1 = (ιA1(x), γA1(x)) and A2 = (ιA2(x), γA2(x))
are to be two cubic fuzzy sets. Then,
1. (Equality): A1 = A2 if and only if ιA1(x) = ιA2(x) and γA1(x) = γA2(x);
2. (P-order): A1 ⊆P A2 if and only if ιA1(x) ⊆ιA2(x) and γA1(x) ≤γA2(x);
3. (R-order): A1 ⊆R A2 if and only if ιA1(x) ⊆ιA2(x) and γA1(x) ≥γA2(x).
Deﬁnition 9.1 ([6]) Let X be a reference set. A cubic hesitant fuzzy set (CHFS) A
on X is deﬁned in terms of uA(x) and vA(x) as follows:
A = {⟨x, uA(x), vA(x)⟩| x ∈X}

(9.2)
where uA(x) is an interval-valued hesitant fuzzy element, and vA(x) is the set of
some different values in [0, 1] arranging in an increasing order for the element x ∈
X to A.
For the sake of simplicity, hA(x) = ⟨uA(x), vA(x)⟩is called the cubic hesitant
fuzzy number (CHFN).
Remark 9.1 Throughout this book, the set of all CHFSs on the reference set X is
denoted by CHFS(X).
Example 9.1 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
hA(x1)
=
⟨uA(x1), vA(x1)⟩
=
⟨{[0.1, 0.3], [0.2, 0.5]}, {0.3, 0.4, 0.6}⟩and
hA(x2) = ⟨uA(x2), vA(x2)⟩= ⟨{[0.4, 0.8]}, {0.1, 0.4, 0.5, 0.9}⟩be the CHFEs
of xi (i = 1, 2) to a set A, respectively. Then A can be considered as a CHFS, i.e.,
A = {⟨x1, ⟨{[0.1, 0.3], [0.2, 0.5]}, {0.3, 0.4, 0.6}⟩⟩,
⟨x2, ⟨{[0.4, 0.8]}, {0.1, 0.4, 0.5, 0.9}⟩⟩}.
Suppose that for any x ∈X, hA1(x) = ⟨uA1(x), vA1(x)⟩and hA2(x) =
⟨uA2(x), vA2(x)⟩are to be two CHFEs. Then (see [6])
1. (Equality): hA1 = hA2 if and only if uA1(x) = uA2(x) and vA1(x) = vA2(x);
2. (P-order): hA1 ⊆P hA2 if and only if uA1(x) ⊆uA2(x) and vA1(x) ≤vA2(x);
3. (R-order): hA1 ⊆R hA2 if and only if uA1(x) ⊆uA2(x) and vA1(x) ≥vA2(x).
Given a ﬁxed x ∈X, some operational laws on CHFNs are deﬁned as follows
[6]:
A1c = {⟨x, 1 −uA1(x), 1 −vA1(x)⟩| x ∈X};
A1 ∪P A2 = {⟨x, max{uA1(x), uA2(x)}, max{vA1(x), vA2(x)}⟩| x ∈X};
A1 ∩P A2 = {⟨x, min{uA1(x), uA2(x)}, min{vA1(x), vA2(x)}⟩| x ∈X};

Triangular Cubic Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Fahmi et al. [1] presented the concept of triangular cubic hesitant fuzzy set,
and further some triangular cubic hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators. Fahmi
et al. [2] developed a set of basic operational laws for triangular cubic hesitant
fuzzy sets, and on the basis of triangular cubic hesitant fuzzy hamming
distance, they represented a TOPSIS technique under triangular cubic hesitant
fuzzy environment,

Linguistic Intuitionistic Cubic Hesitant Variable
Qiyas et al. [7] introduced the concept of linguistic intuitionistic cubic hesitant
variable, and furthermore, they presented a number of aggregation operators
to design a model for solving a multiple criteria decision making issues under
linguistic intuitionistic cubic hesitant environment.
We consider S = {sα | α ∈[0, τ]} as a continuous linguistic term set. Then, a
linguistic intuitionistic cubic hesitant variable is deﬁned as the following:
Deﬁnition 9.3 ([7]) Let X be a reference set. A linguistic intuitionistic cubic
hesitant variable (LICHV) AS on X is deﬁned in terms of uAS(x) and vAS(x)
as follows:

For the sake of simplicity, hAS(x) = (uAS(x), vAS(x)) is called the linguistic
intuitionistic cubic hesitant variable (LICHV).
Remark 9.3 Throughout this book, the set of all LICHVs on the reference set X is
denoted by LICHV(X).
Generally, if two LICHVs hAS(x1) and hAS(x2) have different numbers in their
HFS parts of uAS(x1), vAS(x1), uAS(x2) and vAS(x2), then the HFS parts should

be extended until all of them reach the same number based on the least common
multiple number.
Example 9.3 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
hAS(x1) = (uAS(x1), vAS(x1)) = (⟨[s1, s4], {s2, s5}⟩, ⟨[s1, s4], {s2, s6}⟩) and
hAS(x2) = (uAS(x2), vAS(x2)) = (⟨[s2, s3], {s1, s3, s5}⟩, ⟨[s1, s7], {s2, s5, s6}⟩) be
two LICHVs. Then the uniﬁed LICHVs hAS(x1) and hAS(x2) can be reconsidered
as
AS = {(⟨[s1, s4], {s2, s2, s2, s5, s5, s5}⟩, ⟨[s1, s4], {s2, s2, s2, s6, s6, s6}⟩),
(⟨[s2, s3], {s1, s1, s3, s3, s5, s5}⟩, ⟨[s1, s7], {s2, s2, s5, s5, s6, s6}⟩)}.
Assume that S = {sα | α ∈[0, τ]} where any linguistic term set s0 ≤sα ≤sτ
is continuous, and hAS = (uAS, vAS) = (⟨[sL

Chapter 10
Complex Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Abstract In this chapter, we present the concept of complex hesitant fuzzy set, and
then, we deal with complex dual hesitant fuzzy set. The last part of this chapter is
devoted to presenting the concept of complex dual type 2 hesitant fuzzy set.
10.1
Complex Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Mahmood [3] explored the approach of complex hesitant fuzzy set, which
contains truth grades in the form of subset of unit disc in the complex plane.
Then, they described the operational laws of complex hesitant fuzzy sets and
veriﬁed them by the use of a number of numerical examples. Garg et al. [1]
represented a set of generalized distance measures for complex hesitant fuzzy
sets, applied them to a decision making technique being established under the
complex hesitant fuzzy environment.
Suppose that X represents a reference set, and
A = {⟨x, γA(x)⟩| x ∈X}
(10.1)
denotes a complex fuzzy set A on X in which the notation γA(x) = ργA(x) ×
ei2π(θγA(x)) indicates a polar representation of complex-valued truth grade with the
two parameters ργA(x) and θγA(x) ∈[0, 1] (see [6]). Furthermore, the set γA(x) is
in correspondence with the element x ∈X.

Complex Hesitant Fuzzy Set
These ﬁndings provide us with a deeper understanding of complex hesitant fuzzy
set introduced below.
Deﬁnition 10.1 ([3]) Let X be a reference set. A complex hesitant fuzzy set
(CHFS) A on X is deﬁned as
A = {⟨x, hA(x)⟩| x ∈X} =

x,

γA∈hA(x)
{γA}
%
| x ∈X
$
=

x,

γA∈hA(x)
,
ργA(x) × ei2π(θγA(x))-%
| x ∈X},
(10.2)
where hA(x) is the set of different ﬁnite values in [0, 1] which represent the grade
of truth for each element x ∈X to A.
For the sake of simplicity, hA(x) is called the complex hesitant fuzzy number
(CHFN).
Remark 10.1 Throughout this book, the set of all CHFSs on the reference set X is
denoted by CHFS(X).
Example 10.1 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
hA(x1) = {0.1ei2π(0.3), 0.8ei2π(0.2), 0.3ei2π(0.5)}
and
hA(x2) = {0.2ei2π(0.4), 0.4ei2π(0.7), 0.1ei2π(0.5)} be the CHFEs of xi (i = 1, 2) to a
set A, respectively. Then A can be considered as a CHFS, i.e.,
A =
,2
x1,
,
0.1ei2π(0.3), 0.8ei2π(0.2), 0.3ei2π(0.5)-3
,
⟨x2, ,0.2ei2π(0.4), 0.4ei2π(0.7), 0.1ei2π(0.5)-⟩-.

10.2
Complex Dual Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Mahmood et al. [4] introduced the concept of complex dual hesitant fuzzy
set as an assortment of complex fuzzy set and dual hesitant fuzzy set.
Complex dual hesitant fuzzy set contains the grades of membership and non-
membership in the form of a complex number which belongs to the complex
plane in a unit disc. Mahmood et al. [4] studied a number of complex dual
hesitant fuzzy operational laws together with studying two classes of vector
similarity measures and hybrid vector similarity measures for complex dual
hesitant fuzzy sets. They also described the notion of complex interval-valued
dual hesitant fuzzy set.
Deﬁnition 10.2 ([4]) Let X be a reference set. A complex dual hesitant fuzzy set
(CDHFS) 
A on X is deﬁned in terms of u
A(x) and v
A(x) as follows:

A = {⟨x, u
A(x), v
A(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(10.6)
where

Complex Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Remark 10.2 Throughout this book, the set of all CDHFSs on the reference set X
is denoted by CDHFS(X).

be the CDHFNs of xi (i = 1, 2) to a set 
A, respectively. Then 
A can be considered

Complex Dual Type 2 Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Mahmood et al. [5] deﬁned the concept of complex dual type 2 hesitant
fuzzy set by composing the grades of truth falsity. The grades of truth and
falsity contain the grades of primary and secondary parts in the form of polar
coordinates. In continue, Mahmood et al. [5] proposed some complex dual
type 2 hesitant fuzzy operational laws, and then, they introduced a correlation
coefﬁcient and some entropy measures for complex dual type 2 hesitant fuzzy
sets.
Deﬁnition 10.3 ([5]) Let X be a reference set. A complex dual type 2 hesitant fuzzy
set (CDT2HFS) A on X is deﬁned in terms of uA(x) and vA(x) as follows:
A = {⟨x, uA(x), vA(x)⟩| x ∈X},

Chapter 11
Picture Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Abstract In this chapter, we present the concept of picture hesitant fuzzy set, and
then, we deal with interval-valued picture hesitant fuzzy set. The last part of this
chapter is devoted to presenting the concept of dual picture hesitant fuzzy set.
11.1
Picture Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Wang and Li [6] ﬁrstly represented the concept of picture hesitant fuzzy
set by combining the concepts of picture fuzzy set and hesitant fuzzy set.
They put forward a set of aggregation operators to deal with multiple criteria
decision making whose criteria are related at different priorities. Ullah et al.
[5] introduced the concept of GRA technique by the help of picture hesitant
fuzzy sets with incomplete weight information. Jan et al. [3] developed
a number of picture hesitant fuzzy-based distance measures and made a
comparison analysis of the proposed distance measures with other existing
ones. Mahmood and Ali [4] deﬁned a fuzzy cross-entropy for picture hesitant
fuzzy sets, and applied it to multiple criteria decision making. Ambrin et
al. [1] proposed a multiple criteria decision making procedure for supplier
selection using a TOPSIS technique under picture hesitant fuzzy environment.
By taking X as a reference set into account, a picture fuzzy set A on X is
characterized by three functions uA(x), wA(x), and vA(x) as follows (see [2]):
A = {⟨x, uA(x), wA(x), vA(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(11.1)
where uA(x), wA(x), and vA(x) are the sets of some different values in [0, 1] and
represent the positive, neutral, and negative membership degrees of the element x ∈
X to A, respectively. The positive, neutral, and negative membership degrees satisfy
0 ≤uA(x) + wA(x) + vA(x) ≤1

Picture Hesitant Fuzzy Set
and make a presentation of indeterminacy degree as πA(x) = 1 −uA(x)−wA(x)−
vA(x) for any x ∈X.
Given a ﬁxed x ∈X, some operational laws on PFSs are deﬁned as follows (see
[7]):
Ac = {⟨x, vA(x), wA(x), uA(x)⟩| x ∈X};
A1 ∪A2 = {⟨x, max{uA1(x), uA2(x)}, min{wA1(x), wA2(x)},
min{vA1(x), vA2(x)}⟩| x ∈X};
A1 ∩A2 = {⟨x, min{uA1(x), uA2(x)}, max{wA1(x), wA2(x)},
max{vA1(x), vA2(x)}⟩| x ∈X};
A1 ⊕A2 = {⟨x, uA1(x) + uA2(x) −uA1(x) × uA2(x), wA1(x) × wA2(x),
vA1(x) × vA2(x)}⟩| x ∈X};
A1 ⊗A2 = {⟨x, uA1(x) × uA2(x), wA1(x) + wA2(x) −wA1(x) × wA2(x),
vA1(x) + vA2(x) −vA1(x) × vA2(x)}⟩| x ∈X};
λA = {⟨x, 1 −(1 −uA(x))λ, (wA(x))λ, (vA(x))λ⟩| x ∈X}, λ > 0;
Aλ = {⟨x, (uA(x))λ, 1 −(1 −wA(x))λ, 1 −(1 −vA(x))λ⟩| x ∈X}, λ > 0.
Example 11.1 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
hA(x1) = {(0.2, 0.2, 0.3)} and hA(x2) = {(0.4, 0.1, 0.3)} be the PFEs of xi (i =
1, 2) to a set A, respectively. Then A can be considered as a PFS, i.e.,
A = {⟨x1, (0.2, 0.2, 0.3)⟩, ⟨x2, (0.4, 0.1, 0.3)⟩}.
Deﬁnition 11.1 ([6]) Let X be a reference set. A picture hesitant fuzzy set (PHFS)
A on X is deﬁned in terms of three functions uA(x), wA(x), and vA(x) as follows:
A = {⟨x, uA(x), wA(x), vA(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(11.2)
where uA(x), wA(x), and vA(x) are the sets of some different values in [0, 1] and
represent the possible positive, neutral, and negative membership degrees of the
element x ∈X to A, respectively.
Here, for all x ∈X, if we consider uA(x) = 
γA∈uA(x){γA}, wA(x) =

δA∈wA(x){δA}, vA(x) = 
ηA∈vA(x){ηA}, γ +
A ∈u+
A = 
x∈X maxγA∈uA(x){γA},
δ+
A ∈w+
A = 
x∈X maxδA∈wA(x){δA} and η+
A ∈v+
A = 
x∈X maxηA∈vA(x){ηA}, then
we conclude that
0 ≤γA, δA, ηA ≤1,
0 ≤γ +
A + δ+
A + η+
A ≤1.

11.1
Picture Hesitant Fuzzy Set
137
For the sake of simplicity, the pair hA(x) = (uA(x), wA(x), vA(x)) is called the
picture hesitant fuzzy element (PHFE).
Remark 11.1 Throughout this book, the set of all PHFSs on the reference set X is
denoted by PHFS(X).
Example 11.2 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
hA(x1) = (uA(x1), wA(x1), vA(x1)) = ({0.2, 0.3}, {0.1, 0.4}, {0.3}) and hA(x2) =
(uA(x2), wA(x2), vA(x2)) = ({0.3, 0.4}, {0.2}, {0.1, 0.2}). Then, hA(xi) for i =
1, 2 are the PHFEs of xi (i = 1, 2) in the set A, because the relations
γ +
A (x1) = 0.3, δ+
A(x1) = 0.4, η+
A(x1) = 0.3;
γ +
A (x2) = 0.4, δ+
A(x2) = 0.2, η+
A(x2) = 0.2
hold true. Thus, A is a PHFS, and it is denoted by
A = {⟨x1, ({0.2, 0.3}, {0.1, 0.4}, {0.3})⟩, ⟨x2, ({0.3, 0.4}, {0.2}, {0.1, 0.2})⟩}.
For the PHFEs hA = (uA, wA, vA), hA1
= (uA1, wA1, vA1) and hA2
=
(uA2, wA2, vA2) the following operations are deﬁned:
(hA)c = (vA, wA, uA);
(11.3)
hA1 ∪hA2 = (uA1 ∪uA2, wA1 ∩wA2, vA1 ∩vA2);
(11.4)
hA1 ∩hA2 = (uA1 ∩uA2, wA1 ∪wA2, vA1 ∪vA2);
(11.5)
hA1 ⊕hA2 = (uA1 ⊕uA2, wA1 ⊗wA2, vA1 ⊗vA2);
(11.6)
hA1 ⊗hA2 = (uA1 ⊗uA2, wA1 ⊕wA2, vA1 ⊕vA2),
(11.7)
where
0 ≤γ +
A + δ+
A + η+
A ≤1,
0 ≤γ +
A1 + δ+
A1 + η+
A1 ≤1,
0 ≤γ +
A2 + δ+
A2 + η+
A2 ≤1.
On the basis of the above operations on PHFEs, some relationships can be further
established for such operations on PHFSs as follows (see [6]):
A1 ∪A2 =

hA1∈A1,hA2∈A2
hA1 ∪hA2;
(11.8)
A1 ∩A2 =

11.2
Interval-Valued Picture Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Although there does not exist any contribution so far which deals with
interval-valued picture hesitant fuzzy set, it can be deﬁned easily by combing
the notions of picture fuzzy set and interval-valued hesitant fuzzy set.
Deﬁnition 11.2 Let X be a reference set. An interval-valued picture hesitant fuzzy
set (IVPHFS) 
A on X is deﬁned in terms of three functions u
A(x), w
A(x), and
v
A(x) as follows:

A = {⟨x, u
A(x), w
A(x), v
A(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(11.12)
where u
A(x), w
A(x) and v
A(x) are some different interval values in [0, 1] and
represent the possible interval positive, interval neutral, and interval negative
membership degrees of the element x ∈X to the set 
A, respectively.
Here, for all x ∈X, if we take u
A(x) = 
[γ L

A(x){[γ L

x∈X max{δU

A(x)} and
ηU+

A


x∈X max{ηU

For the sake of simplicity, h
A(x) = (u
A(x), w
A(x), v
A(x)) is called the interval-
valued picture hesitant fuzzy element (IVPHFE).
Remark 11.2 Throughout this book, the set of all IVPHFSs on the reference set X
is denoted by IVPHFS(X).
Example 11.3 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
h
A(x1) = (

{[0.2, 0.2]}) be the IVPHFEs of xi (i = 1, 2) in the set 
A, respectively. In this case,
γ U+(x1) = 0.4, δU+(x1) = 0.3, ηU+(x1) = 0.3;
γ U+(x2) = 0.4, δU+(x2) = 0.3, ηU+(x2) = 0.2

result in
γ U+(x1) + δU+(x1) + ηU+(x1) = 0.4 + 0.3 + 0.3 ≤1;
γ U+(x2) + δU+(x2) + ηU+(x2) = 0.4 + 0.3 + 0.2 ≤1.
Thus, h
A(x1) and h
A(x2) are two IVPHFEs, and then 
A can be considered as a
IVPHFS, i.e.,

A = {⟨x1, ({[0.2, 0.4], [0.3, 0.3]}, {[0.1, 0.2], [0.2, 0.3]}, {[0.2, 0.3]})⟩,

Chapter 12
Spherical Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Abstract In this chapter, we present the concept of spherical hesitant fuzzy set as a
generalization of both picture hesitant fuzzy set and Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy set
for dealing with fuzziness and uncertainty information. In the sequel, we are going
to re-state the extension form of spherical hesitant fuzzy set by generalizing that to
the concept of T-spherical hesitant fuzzy set.
12.1
Spherical Hesitant Fuzzy Set
By keeping the importance of logarithmic function of spherical hesitant
fuzzy set (SHFS) and its aggregation operators in mind, Khan et al. [3]
developed an algorithm to tackle the multiple criteria decision making under
spherical hesitant fuzzy environment. Naeem et al. [4] proposed a number of
aggregation operations for SHFSs by the use of sine trigonometric function,
namely the spherical hesitant fuzzy weighted average and the spherical
hesitant fuzzy weighted geometric aggregation operators.
By keeping the reference set as X in mind, a spherical fuzzy set A on X is deﬁned
[2] in terms of three functions uA(x), wA(x), and vA(x) as follows:
A = {⟨x, uA(x), wA(x), vA(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(12.1)
where uA(x), wA(x), and vA(x) are the sets of some different values in [0, 1] and
represent the positive, neutral, and negative membership degrees of the element x ∈
X to A, respectively. The positive, neutral, and negative membership degrees satisfy
0 ≤(uA(x))2 + (wA(x))2 + (vA(x))2 ≤1

Spherical Hesitant Fuzzy Set
and make a presentation of indeterminacy degree as
πA(x) =
27
1 −(uA(x))2 −(wA(x))2 −(vA(x))2 for any x ∈X. It is easily
observed that the concept of spherical fuzzy set is an extension of picture fuzzy
set.
Given a ﬁxed x ∈X, some operational laws on spherical fuzzy sets are deﬁned
as follows (see [3]):
Ac = {⟨x, vA(x), wA(x), uA(x)⟩| x ∈X};
A1 ∪A2 = {⟨x, max{uA1(x), uA2(x)}, min{wA1(x), wA2(x)},
min{vA1(x), vA2(x)}⟩| x ∈X};
A1 ∩A2 = {⟨x, min{uA1(x), uA2(x)}, max{wA1(x), wA2(x)},
max{vA1(x), vA2(x)}⟩| x ∈X};
A1 ⊕A2 = {⟨x, uA1(x) + uA2(x) −uA1(x) × uA2(x), wA1(x) × wA2(x),
vA1(x) × vA2(x)}⟩| x ∈X};
A1 ⊗A2 = {⟨x, uA1(x) × uA2(x), wA1(x) + wA2(x) −wA1(x) × wA2(x),
vA1(x) + vA2(x) −vA1(x) × vA2(x)}⟩| x ∈X};
λA = {⟨x, 1 −(1 −uA(x))λ, (wA(x))λ, (vA(x))λ⟩| x ∈X};
Aλ = {⟨x, (uA(x))λ, 1 −(1 −wA(x))λ, 1 −(1 −vA(x))λ⟩| x ∈X},
where λ > 0, and
0 ≤(uA(x))2 + (wA(x))2 + (vA(x))2 ≤1,
0 ≤(uA1(x))2 + (wA1(x))2 + (vA1(x))2 ≤1,
0 ≤(uA2(x))2 + (wA2(x))2 + (vA2(x))2 ≤1.
Example 12.1 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set.
The two sets hA(x1) = {(0.2, 0.2, 0.3)} and hA(x2) = {(0.4, 0.1, 0.3)} are spherical
fuzzy sets of xi (i = 1, 2) belonging to a set A, and this is clear from the fact that
0.22 + 0.22 + 0.32 ≤1 and 0.42 + 0.12 + 0.32 ≤1. Thus A can be considered as a
spherical fuzzy set, i.e.,
A = {⟨x1, (0.2, 0.2, 0.3)⟩, ⟨x2, (0.4, 0.1, 0.3)⟩}.
Deﬁnition 12.1 ([4]) Let X be a reference set. A spherical hesitant fuzzy set
(SHFS) A on X is deﬁned in terms of three functions uA(x), wA(x) and vA(x)
as follows:
A = {⟨x, uA(x), wA(x), wA(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(12.3)

where uA(x), wA(x), and vA(x) are the sets of some different values in [0, 1] and
represent the possible positive, neutral, and negative membership degrees of the
element x ∈X to A, respectively.
Here, for all x
∈
X, if we take uA(x)
=

γA∈uA(x){γA}, wA(x)
=

δA∈wA(x){δA}, vA(x) = 
ηA∈vA(x){ηA}, γ +
A ∈u+
A = 
x∈X maxγA∈uA(x){γA},
δ+
A ∈w+
A = 
x∈X maxδA∈wA(x){δA} and η+
A ∈v+
A = 
x∈X maxηA∈vA(x){ηA}, then
we conclude that
0 ≤γA, δA, ηA ≤1,
0 ≤(γ +
A )2 + (δ+
A)2 + (η+
A)2 ≤1.
For the sake of simplicity, the triple hA(x) = (uA(x), wA(x), vA(x)) is called
the spherical hesitant fuzzy element (SHFE).
Remark 12.1 Throughout this book, the set of all SHFSs on the reference set X is
denoted by SHFS(X).
Example 12.2 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
hA(x1) = (uA(x1), wA(x1), vA(x1)) = ({0.2, 0.3}, {0.1, 0.4}, {0.3}) and hA(x2) =
(uA(x2), wA(x2), vA(x2)) = ({0.3, 0.4}, {0.2}, {0.1, 0.2}). Then, hA(xi) for i =
1, 2 are the SHFEs of xi (i = 1, 2) in the set A, because the relations
γ +
A (x1) = 0.3, δ+
A(x1) = 0.4, η+
A(x1) = 0.3;
γ +
A (x2) = 0.4, δ+
A(x2) = 0.2, η+
A(x2) = 0.2
result in
(γ +
A )2(x1) + (δ+
A)2(x1) + (η+
A)2(x1) = 0.32 + 0.42 + 0.32 ≤1;
(γ +
A )2(x2) + (δ+
A)2(x2) + (η+
A)2(x2) = 0.42 + 0.22 + 0.22 ≤1.
Thus, A is a SHFS, and it is denoted by
A = {⟨x1, ({0.2, 0.3}, {0.1, 0.4}, {0.3})⟩, ⟨x2, ({0.3, 0.4}, {0.2}, {0.1, 0.2})⟩}.
For the SHFEs hA = (uA, wA, vA), hA1
= (uA1, wA1, vA1), and hA2
=
(uA2, wA2, vA2) the following operations are deﬁned:
(hA)c = (vA, wA, uA);
(12.4)
hA1 ∪hA2 = (uA1 ∪uA2, wA1 ∩wA2, vA1 ∩vA2);
(12.5)
hA1 ∩hA2 = (uA1 ∩uA2, wA1 ∪wA2, vA1 ∪vA2);
(12.6)
hA1 ⊕hA2 = (uA1 ⊕uA2, wA1 ⊗wA2, vA1 ⊗vA2);
(12.7)
hA1 ⊗hA2 = (uA1 ⊗uA2, wA1 ⊕wA2, vA1 ⊕vA2),

A1)2 + (η+
A1)2 ≤1,
0 ≤(γ +
A2)2 + (δ+
A2)2 + (η+
A2)2 ≤1.
On the basis of the above operations on SHFEs, some relationships can be further
established for such operations on SHFSs as follows:
A1 ∪A2 =

hA1∈A1,hA2∈A2
hA1 ∪hA2;

hA1 ⊗hA2.

12.2
T-Spherical Hesitant Fuzzy Set
Naeem et al. [4] presented the notion of T-spherical hesitant fuzzy set
(TSHFS), and they enhanced the topic with introducing basic operations for
TSHFSs using sine trigonometric function. Furthermore, they proposed some
aggregation operators for TSHFSs which are implemented in the multiple
criteria decision making in the spherical hesitant fuzzy information.
Deﬁnition 12.2 ([4]) Let X be a reference set. A T-spherical hesitant fuzzy set (T-
SHFS) 
A on X is deﬁned in terms of three functions u
A(x), w
A(x), and v
A(x) as
follows:

A = {⟨x, u
A(x), w
A(x), w
A(x)⟩| x ∈X},
(12.13)
where u
A(x), w
A(x), and v
A(x) are the sets of some different values in [0, 1] and
represent the possible positive, neutral, and negative membership degrees of the
element x ∈X to 
A, respectively.

For the sake of simplicity, the triple h
A(x) = (u
A(x), w
A(x), v
A(x)) is called
the T-spherical hesitant fuzzy element (T-SHFE).
Remark 12.2 Throughout this book, the set of all T-SHFSs on the reference set X
is denoted by T −SHFS(X).
Example 12.3 Let X = {x1, x2} be the reference set,
h
A(x1) = (u
A(x1), w
A(x1), v
A(x1)) = ({0.2, 0.3}, {0.1, 0.4}, {0.3}) and h
A(x2) =
(u
A(x2), w
A(x2), v
A(x2)) = ({0.3, 0.4}, {0.2}, {0.1, 0.2}). Then, h
A(xi) for i =
1, 2 are the T-SHFEs of xi (i = 1, 2) in the set 
A, because the relations
γ +
A (x1) = 0.3, δ+
A(x1) = 0.4, η+
A(x1) = 0.3;
γ +
A (x2) = 0.4, δ+
A(x2) = 0.2, η+
A(x2) = 0.2
result in
(γ +
A )q(x1) + (δ+
A)q(x1) + (η+
A)q(x1) = 0.3q + 0.4q + 0.3q ≤1;
(γ +
A )q(x2) + (δ+
A)q(x2) + (η+
A)q(x2) = 0.4q + 0.2q + 0.2q ≤1,
q ≥1.
Thus, 
A is a T-SHFS, and it is denoted by

A = {⟨x1, ({0.2, 0.3}, {0.1, 0.4}, {0.3})⟩, ⟨x2, ({0.3, 0.4}, {0.2}, {0.1, 0.2})⟩}.

Remark 12.3 Also, we are able to get other extensions for spherical (or T-
spherical) hesitant fuzzy set by combining the concepts declared in this book.
For instance, the concept of complex spherical fuzzy set [1] is created by
mixing the concepts of complex fuzzy set and spherical fuzzy set.
