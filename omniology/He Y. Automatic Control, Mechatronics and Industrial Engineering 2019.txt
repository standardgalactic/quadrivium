ABSTRACT: In this work, to solve the information island existing in the Distributed 
Control System (DCS) of the creep laboratory, set up a network-monitoring system which 
could integrate multiple information to deal with the information construction problems. 
Based on a TCP/IP RS485 communication protocol and data-mining technology, a system 
with field and remote monitoring software in charge of monitoring and control rights is built. 
Up to 256 creep and endurance testing machines can be remotely monitored by means of a 
mobile client or web browser. The system provides an enterprise management system, which 
makes the enterprise and test information highly integrated. The performance results show 
that the system has many advantages, such as stability, reliability and real-time monitoring.
Keywords: information island, Creep test, remote monitoring, data-mining
1 INTRODUCTION
In recent years, due to the advantages of fast transmission rate, low cost and high reliability, 
Industrial Ethernet has been widely used to monitor the test for measuring properties of metal-
lic materials at high temperature (Ning, 2015; Zhang, 2016; Chen, 2016; Wang, 2016; Sun, 
2016). At present, creep testing machines such as INSTRON, MTS, and Shimadzu have succes-
sively developed remote network monitoring systems, while domestic Creep testing machines 
still use a Distributed Control System (DCS) (INSTRON Co, 1993; Ni, 2007; Wang, Z, 2006). 
With the grouping of the steel, boiler and other industries, its organizational structure and 
product types are showing diversity. At the same time, the geographical locations of the labora-
tories are scattered, which increases the difficulty of information construction (Zhu, 2018). It is 
therefore necessary to optimize the original application system and develop a highly integrated 
remote monitoring system to improve social benefits and meet industrial needs.
The paper uses an RD2-3 creep and endurance testing machine as a prototype, based on net-
work and serial communication protocol and data-mining technology, to build a set of Intranet 
and Internet hybrid network monitoring systems. We developed the Creep Test Remote-
Monitoring System, which uses max language programming in Visual Basic, JAVA, improving 
remote query efficiency and portability. It can automatically acquire and monitor the test data, 
such as temperature, stress, strain and break time, of up to 256 electronic creep testers. In addi-
tion, Considering the timeliness of the alarm, the system is equipped with a GSM/GPRS mod-
ule. Hence the alarm signals such as break and overheating will be successively sent to the user’s 
mobile phone, iPad and other devices in the form of short messages and application-notifications.
2 SYSTEM HARDWARE STRUCTURE
As shown in Figure 1, the Creep Test Remote-Monitoring System of the paper adopts a 
three-tier structure, comprising the field layer, service layer and client layer. The field layer 
mainly includes sensors for temperature, displacement and pressure, an analog-to-digital con-
version module, MR13, PLC, 32-channel PCI-1611U multi-serial communication card, IPC 

4
and GSM/GPRS communication module. Based on the RS485 data communication bus, 
the system uses the address differentiation technology to realize the automatic acquisition 
and parameter control of the temperature, strain, load and break time of 64 RD2-3 testing 
machines. The IPC is connected to the GSM/GPRS communication module through the 
RS232 port and directly sends the alarm signals, such as break and overheating, to the user’s 
mobile phone. The four acquisition modules are as follows:
1. Temperature acquisition and control module. The three-stage independent temperature 
control is used to reduce the temperature interference of the interval. The IPC sends a 
read/write command to the MR13 through the RS485 bus to realize the independent 
acquisition and control of the temperature during the test (An et al., 2007);
2. Creep deformation acquisition module. The CBW digital displacement meter is used to 
convert the deformation displacement signal into a DC signal, which will be converted 
into a digital signal by the ADAM4017 module and then transmitted to the IPC to realize 
automatic acquisition and recording of creep deformation (An et al., 2007);
3. Fracture time acquisition module. The broken electrical signal is converted into 
a digital signal by the ADAM4017 module and then transmitted to the industrial compu-
ter to realize automatic recording and alarm of the long-term test break time (An et al., 
2007);
4. Load collection and control module. While the system retains the lever loading mode of 
the long-term test, the Siemens S7-200PLC is used to control the servo motor to rotate 
the rod to achieve precise loading. The communication between the PLC and the pressure 
sensor can be realized by using the Modbus library provided by Siemens (Huang & Wang, 
2018). The IPC further reads the load data or sends the load control parameters through 
the PCI-1611U.

The service layer uses the Advantech EKI-2528  industrial router to form a network 
between the server and four IPC, set a fixed IP for each IPC, and use a TCP/IP communica-
tion protocol to monitor up to 256 creep testers on the server at the same time. This provides 
a remote monitoring service to solve the problem of information construction caused by the 
dispersed locations of the field systems.
The client layer includes handheld devices and network terminals. The test status, data 
and enterprise information are put out to the network by the service layer. Users can directly 
monitor test on smart phones, tablet computers and other devices to make up for the lack of 
remote monitoring services.
3 SYSTEM SOFTWARE STRUCTURE
As shown in Figure 2, the field monitoring system was developed in the field layer’s IPC 
using VB language, and the remote monitoring problem was lacking for the domestic testing 
machine DCS system. The remote monitoring system was developed on the server using 
java, which improved the applicability and portability. Multi-threaded and optimized queue 
sorting prevents program blocking, allowing the server to handle both access methods in an 
orderly manner: lightweight web and client applications. In order to cater to the diversification 
brought on by enterprise grouping, the system is equipped with an enterprise information 
management platform to facilitate enterprise structure adjustment and product grasp.

3.1 Field layer
In the field control layer, the DCS user software system was developed based on the Win XP 
operating system using VB6.0. The MSComm control is used as the serial communication 
tool of the application program to allow the upper computer to read and write data from the 
serial port to the lower computer. In this paper, we use the link technology of OLE object to 
get the control handle of the ADO data object to complete VB and database connection, in 
order to store the test data in the background database. The ACCESS database is used as the 
original collection database. The IPC periodically sends a connection request to the server, 
and the SQL database data is queued and replicated to the server through the connection 
queue, data consistency, continuity and integrity. The following describes the implementation 
of the key parts:
1. GSM/GPRS communication module. Considering that the alarm is only covered by the 
server message push, it will be overwritten by other push messages of the user’s mobile 
client. Therefore, the GSM/GPRS wireless transmission technology is directly sent to the 
user’s mobile terminal in the form of short message.
2. ActiveX Data Objects (ADO). The ADO provides remote operation of the database. The 
IPC connects to the server’s SQL SEVER database through the server’s IP, port number, 
database port number, and account password to copy the data to the server database. 
The  DCS system has a good command flow application with ACCESS connection. 
Therefore, the communication code between the industrial computer and the server SQL 
SEVER is given below: 
Dim AdoConnTool As New ADODB.Connection
Dim AdoRsTool As New ADODB.Recordset
Dim strAdoConnTool As String
strAdoConnTool = “”
 strAdoConnTool = “Provider = SQLOLEDB.1;Persist Security Info = False;User ID = sa;
Password = sa123;Initial Catalog = new;Data Source = 210.35.96.142;”
‘SQL server account password and IP address
strSQL = “........”
‘Data selection
AdoConnTool.Open strAdoConnTool
‘AdoRsTool.Open strSQL, AdoConnTool, adOpenStatic, adLockReadOnly
AdoRsTool.Open strSQL, AdoConnTool, adOpenForwardOnly
AdoRsTool!username
Dim strTotal As String
strTotal = “”
If AdoRsTool.RecordCount <> 0 Then
MsgBox “connection succeeded”
......‘Data replication’
End If
AdoRsTool.Close
AdoConnTool.Close
End Sub
3.2 Service layer
This system is based on database technology, and builds the server of the two frameworks of 
B/S and C/S in the server. The monitoring adopts the B/S architecture as the main scheme 
and the C/S as the auxiliary scheme to ensure the efficient and stable operation of the sys-
tem. In the B/S framework, Apache+Tomcat is used as the web application server and the 
standard World Wide Web port 80 is configured as the web terminal request port. The Servlet 
written by java is responsible for interactively browsing and modifying data. The eclipse is 
used to develop jsp dynamic pages to realize user login, life prediction, real-time data curve, 
historical curve and other functions.

7
In the C/S framework, the server is configured with a custom TCP port greater than 1024, 
and the Socket Server is programming in java for the client connection to achieve data trans-
mission and timely push of alarm signals. The framework includes three modules as follows:
1. Data processing module: used to complete data processing and thread control. The task 
thread pool is used to provide threads for each connected client. When idle occurs in the 
collection, the queue task is started, otherwise it waits.
2. Processing module: used to complete client connection and XML file encapsulation and 
parsing. Connects to the client by comparing the sockets. When connecting, it uses the 
socket connection pool method to ensure the connection of multiple clients by initializing 
several long connections and adding identification bits.

3. Communication module. Through the data transmission channel, the data information is 
sent to the server side in an XML data format in an asynchronous manner to implement 
data interaction.
3.3 Customer layer
The client layer is mainly used for interface display and human-computer interaction. The 
web browser is only responsible for front-end page display. The mobile client uses the eclipse 
tool to develop the mobile application, which achieves user login, life prediction, real-time 
data curve, history curve, break alarm and other functions. The interface is shown in Figures 3 
and 4.
4 CONCLUSIONS
This paper builds a remote monitoring system based on TCP/IP, RS485 communication pro-
tocol and data-mining technology. The system is divided into the field layer, the service layer 
and the customer layer. The on-site and remote software are in charge of monitoring and 
control rights. Both can exchange data through ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), automatic 
acquisition and remote monitoring of temperature, stress, strain and break time data for up 
to 256 electronic creep testers. The system provides remote monitoring and enterprise man-
agement services for creep testing, which makes the enterprise and test information highly 
integrated, and provides a means for enterprise information construction. The system opera-
tion results show that the system runs stably and the test data is reliable.

A new method for integrated navigation of hypersonic cruising 
aircraft using non-Keplerian orbits
H.L. Li, D.W. Wu, B. Zhang, B.F. Yang & Y.H. Zhao
Information and Navigation College, Air Force Engineering University, Shanxi Xi’an, China
ABSTRACT: Although deeply coupled Strapdown Inertial Navigation System/Global Posi-
tioning System (SINS/GPS) technology has been considered the foremost navigation system 
in Hypersonic Cruise Vehicles (HCVs) by many research institutions, the wireless signal from 
the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is almost completely shielded by the real-gas 
effect in the hypersonic state, which results in an obvious decline in precision of the deeply 
coupled INS/GPS. Integrated INS/GNSS/CNS(Celestial Navigation System)navigation sys-
tems were adopted for HCVs. However, this increased the complexity of the system and led to 
the main filters tending to diverge in the information fusion process. Thus, a new method for 
INS/GNSS/CNS integrated navigation in hypersonic cruising aircraft based on non-Keplerian 
orbits is presented in this paper. By using the flight characteristics of the HCV, without adding 
any sensor, the non-Keplerian orbit mode of the HCV is considered to be the fourth virtual 
sensor; its exact non-Keplerian orbital model and an optimal data fusion model of a SINS/
GNSS/CNS integrated navigation system constitute a deeply coupled mode, and the orbital 
model modifies the integrated navigation system and the integrated navigation system feeds 
information back to the orbital model. Experimental results indicate that the new method has 
much better precision with respect to position and velocity than the traditional method; the 
main filters still achieve effective constringency when they are subject to interference; the pre-
cision and reliability of the INS/GNSS/CNS integrated navigation of the hypersonic cruising 
aircraft are improved. The next step of this paper is to continue the research on the nonlinear 
filtering algorithm of the integrated heterogeneous navigation sensor.
Keywords: Hypersonic cruising aircraft, integrated navigation, non-Keplerian orbits, 
information fusion, deeply coupled mode
1 INTRODUCTION
A Hypersonic Cruise Vehicle (HCV) is an aircraft which can fly for a long time continuously 
at hypersonic speeds (5–25 Ma) in near space. The HCV has three superlative characteris-
tics, which are superfast velocity of sound, super high altitude, and super long flying time. 
It centralizes new technologies in all aeronautic and aerospace disciplines, and represents 
future development directions in aeronautic and aerospace fields. It has become an impor-
tant stratagem for development by today’s great military powers of the world (Jiang et al., 
2015). However, the navigation system functionality is a challenge in the HCV, and thus it has 
become a research hotspot (Gao et al., 2014; Li et al., 2014).
The integration of the Inertial Navigation System (INS), the Celestial Navigation System 
(CNS) and the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is regarded as being the optimal 
navigation system for an HCV (Peng,2014; Kaiser et al., 2017; Serrani & Bolender, 2014). 
However, the traditional INS/CNS/GNSS adopts a federal filter that is a decentralized filter-
ing method, which has two data processes consisting of many local filters and a main filter. 
The INS’s drift is respectively revised by the CNS and the GNSS. The system state equation 
is based for the most part on the INS errors, which become the system state vectors.

10
In actual application, however, the INS/GNSS/CNS integrated navigation system uses 
three dissimilar sensors to obtain observational information. The parameters concerned in 
the integrated navigation system are the position and velocity information, but only the plat-
form misalignment angle is observed in the CNS, which does not provide the position and 
velocity information for the filter directly. For the same state, only two sensors (INS/GNSS or 
INS/CNS) are used. In the information fusion, the information from each sub-filter is differ-
ent. Therefore, the output information from two sub-filters if the federal Kalman filtering is 
straightly used is an isomerous in the main filter, which leads to the squared error matrix esti-
mator of the main filter being diverged (Yang et al., 2013). Meanwhile, the satellite navigation 
equipment is vulnerable to interference or shielding during extended-time and long-distance 
flights (He et al., 2014). All of these problems make the traditional INS/CNS/GNSS integrated 
navigation system inefficient for navigation on extended-time and long-distance HCV flights.
To eliminate the main filter distortion in traditional integrated navigation for INS/GNSS/
GNS, the research focused on the characteristics of the HCV’s non-Keplerian orbits. The 
CNS system gathers the position and velocity information using a non-Keplerian orbit 
model, and then fuses that information in the filter. Only the state model of the CNS is 
revised using the non-Keplerian orbits of the HCV in the literature (Heiligers & McInnes, 
2014), which has been expanded to the INS/GNSS/CNS integrated navigation in this paper. 
We expand the main filter to achieve optimal information fusion, which not only satisfies the 
requirement for filter stability, but also enhances the navigation accuracy and the comprehen-
sive performance of the system.
2  THE PRINCIPLE OF INS/GNSS/CNS INTEGRATED NAVIGATION 
IN HCV NON-KEPLERIAN ORBITS
In the INS/GNSS/CNS integrated navigation system of an HCV,SINS is used as the basic 
system for the integrated navigation system because of its advantages in comprehensive 
navigation parameters, good maneuvering target tracing, timely continuous output, good 
concealment, and powerful anti-jamming performance. GNSS can be compatible with sys-
tems such as BeiDou, GPS and GLONASS. To improve fault tolerance and anti-jamming 
performance, each system can be a backup system. CNS adopts the COMS APS star sensor, 
which has good radiation toleration and a large dynamic range, to output the real-time vec-
tor position with high accuracy. In that regard, the parameters concerned for the integrated 
navigation are the position and velocity information, though accurate observation of the 
platform offset angle in the CNS system does not provide the position and velocity informa-
tion for the filter directly. Therefore, by adopting a soft correction method, a system equation 
Figure 1. Schematic diagram of the integrated navigation system.

between the platform drift angle and the errors of position and velocity in the INS are estab-
lished. The platform offset information is gathered by the globally estimated outputs of the 
federal filter and the CNS observation, while the error estimation for position and veloc-
ity is calculated via the non-Keplerian orbits’ system equation. The errors for the position 
and velocity information are highly accurate, and from that, the CNS platform observation 
represents true real-time values and the global estimation output has the highest accuracy. 
Sub-filter 1 is composed of the position and velocity information coming from the system 
correction and the INS, while sub-filter 2 is composed of the position and velocity informa-
tion derived from the INS and the GNSS observation. The outputs of the two sub-filters 
are then fused in the main filter. In addition, the INS can output information by itself. The 
principle of INS/CNS/GNSS integrated navigation is depicted in Figure 1.
3  A NEW METHOD FOR INS/GNSS/CNS INTEGRATED NAVIGATION 
FOR HCV NON-KEPLERIAN ORBITS
3.1 The model for HCV non-Keplerian orbits
HCV belongs to the non-Keplerian orbits through derivation. Moreover, the model and 
applied scope between Keplerian and non-Keplerian orbits are given inNazari et al. (2014). 
Under the action of multiple forces, these forces can be synthesized into four forces, Cx, Cy, FG 
and FsF , as depicted in Figure 2. Cx is the control vector on the HCV, Cy is the aerodynamic vec-
tor on the HCV, FsF  is the thrust vector on the HCV, and FG is the gravity vector on the HCV.
According to Newtonian mechanics, the resultant force FH on the HCV is the vector sum 
of forces Cx, Cy, FG and FS
F .  Assuming that r is the vector of the earth, r  is the unit vector 
of r, G is gravitational constant, M is earth’s mass, and m is HCV’s quality, the formulations

3.2  Integrated navigation system model for hypersonic cruising aircraft based 
on non-Keplerian orbits
According to the source of system error, the strap-down inertial navigation system error and 
the star sensor installation error will be included in the state of the integrated navigation 
system, including the mathematical platform attitude error of the strap-down inertial naviga-
tion system φE, φN, φU, the velocity error δυE, δυN, δυU, the location error δL, δλ, δh, the gyro 
random constant drift εbx, εby, εbz, the accelerometer random constant error ∇bx, ∇by, ∇bz, and 
the star sensor installation error δAx, δAy, δAz, and the state vector of the integrated naviga-
tion system X is given as follows:
 
X = [φE, φN, φU, δυE, δυN, δυU, δL, δλ, δh, εbx, εby, εbz, ∇bx, ∇by, ∇bz, δAx, δAy, δAz]T
According to the system error model and state vector X, we can get the state equation for 
inertial/satellite/integrated navigation as follows:

where F is the system state matrix, G is the system noise drive array, and W(t) is the white 
noise. Moreover, wgx, wgy, wgz is the gyroscope white noise, and wax, wax, wax is the accelerometer 
white noise (Miao & Shi, 2014).
3.3 The fusion algorithm for the Keplerian orbits’ integrated navigation in hypersonic aircraft
Because the operating cycle is long for an HCV, and usually in a hypersonic maneuvering state, 
the influence of the engine’s thrust is an uncertain factor in the system state model. Measure-
ment residuals are no longer regarded as the white-noise sequence whose mean value is zero, 
such that the aircraft is navigated automatically. There is a limited capacity for the federated 
Kalman filtering method to whittle down this uncertain factor (Peng et al., 2014). To decrease 
the filter’s estimated error in the hypersonic maneuvering process for an HCV, and to improve 
the filter’s stability, an improved Kalman filtering algorithm designed for this work was fitted 
to decrease the negative influence of the state model’s uncertainty, thereby improving the per-
formance in navigating automatically during the HCV orbital maneuvering period.

As for the HCV autonomous navigation system, if the HCV maneuvers on the orbits at 
hypersonic speed, then the state equation conflicts with the truth, so the estimating error 

14
becomes greater and leads to the estimating residual error Δyt becoming greater. If it rises to 
a certain degree and leads to Py t
P
 exceeding the threshold αPy,t, the real estimating residual 
variance exceeds the theoretical value, and then the prediction error variance matrix needs to 
be reset. The method for this is to increase the value of the prediction error variance matrix, 
which is conducive to optimizing the filter gain matrix Kt, and improving the revising func-
tion of the estimating information and the position precision of the hypersonic orbits, and it 
also improves the filter’s stability in tracking performance.
4 EXPERIMENT AND RESULT ANALYSIS
With regard to the hypersonic vehicle as a simulation object, the aircraft’s parameters adopt the 
data from the US experimental aerospace aircraft called X-33 (Xiong et al., 2014), whose mass 
is 900 kg, angle of attack is 20°, and angle of tracking yaw is 8.5°. Following the simulation 
calculation, the initial velocity is 7,000 m/s, the height is 100 km, the flight time is 600 s, and the 
sampling period of SINS is 0.1 s, and 2 s for Kalman filtering. The selection for the initial filter 
values are as follows: position error δL = δλ = 3 m, δh = 10 m, velocity error 0.2 m/s, attitude 
angle error ϕΕ = ϕΝ = 5”, δh = 10 m. The gyro constant drift and gyro random drift are 0.1°/h, the 
gyro white-noise drift is 0.01°/h; the accelerometer random drift is 10−4 g, and the accelerometer 
white-noise drift is 10−5 g. The GPS receiver’s velocity error is 0.5 m/s, and the position error is

10 m. The observation error of the celestial navigation system is 3”. Set the malfunction on the 
GPS for 200–250 s for time, and bring in an outlier of 100 m for the position, with 10 m/s for the 
velocity. Set the malfunction on the GPS for 300–350 s for time, and bring in an estimated outlier 
of 5 minutes of arc. The results of the experiment are shown in Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6.
Figures 3 and 4 show that the new method used in this paper is more accurate than the 
traditional method; the filter can achieve effective convergence, and the traditional method 
starts to diffuse after 200 s, where the velocity error becomes more obvious. Figures 5 and 
6 show that the new method can achieve high-precision navigation for a hypersonic vehi-
cle, and the filter can effectively converge when encountering interference in the 300–350 s 
period, indicating that the non-Keplerian orbit parameters enhances the stabilization of the 
filter as the fourth sensor information.
5 CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, a new method for INS/GNSS/CNS integrated navigation for hypersonic vehi-
cles is proposed and the state model of the system is built using non-Keplerian orbital char-
acteristics of the hypersonic vehicle. Based upon not increasing the number of sensors, the 

16
aircraft’s internal resources are fully utilized, and the orbital parameters of the aircraft are 
used as the information for a fourth virtual sensor. First, the position and velocity infor-
mation and the information from the CNS system are obtained, and then the information 
symmetry of the two sub-filters is given. The non-Keplerian orbits’ state equation is used 
as a priori information. Finally, the main filter proceeds to optimal information fusion. The 
simulation results show that the new method is better than the traditional method. Because 
the fourth virtual sensor information is used for filtering existing information, even though 
the integrated navigation system of a given subsystem may be disturbed, the filter can still 
effectively converge and maintain high precision.
Under the existing conditions, the dynamic equations for a near-space hypersonic vehicle 
based on non-Keplerian orbits are necessary to provide the control force and the control 
torque. This is related to the aerodynamic layout and mission of the aircraft, and the solution 
process of this paper is simplified. This aspect will be further improved in future research.

ABSTRACT: Machine vision technologies have been the focus of research in the fields of 
industrial robotics and automation for more than two decades now. Over the years, these 
technologies have revolutionized the manufacturing and inspection processes industries with 
the help of sophisticated vision-based robotics systems that can gage the location of a desired 
object in a 3-dimesional space, ascertain its orientation relative to its surroundings and per-
form the task accordingly. A basic machine vision system has a single stationary camera 
mounted over the workspace to enable image acquisition. With this form of active sensing, 
the position, orientation, identity and condition of each part can be obtained. This high level 
information can be used to plan the robotic motion, such as determining how to grasp a part 
and how to avoid collisions with obstacles.
The objective of this paper is to perform a pattern matching operation and blob analysis 
on an image processing inspector. An overhead CCD camera performs the task of image 
acquisition.
1 INTRODUCTION
The study and development of robot mechanisms can be traced back to the mid-1940s, when 
master slave manipulators were designed and fabricated at Oak Ridge and the Argonne 
National Laboratories for the purpose of handling radioactive materials. The first com-
mercial computer controlled robot was introduced in the late 1950s by Unimation Inc., and 
a number of industrial experimental devices suit during the next 15 years (Bhanu, 2013). 
A robot can be defined as (Chin & Dyer, 1986).
‘A Robot is defined as reprogrammable device designed to both manipulate and transport 
parts, tools or specified manufacturing implements through variable programmed motion for 
the performance of specific manufacturing task.’ (British Robot Association, 1984).
As is the case with humans, vision capabilities endow a robot with a sophisticated sensing 
mechanism that allows the machine to respond to its environment in an intelligent and flex-
ible manner. The use of vision and other sensing elements are motivated by the continuing 

18
need to increase the flexibility and scope of the application of the robotic system (Chauhan & 
Surgenor, 2015). While proximity, touch and force sensing play a significant role in the 
improvement of the performance of robots, vision is considered to be the most powerful of a 
robot’s sensory capabilities. Robot vision is defined as a process of extracting, characterizing 
and interpreting information from images of three dimensional worlds (Li, 1996). This proc-
ess is commonly known as computer vision or machine vision and comprises six principle 
areas: sensing, preprocessing, segmentation, description, recognition, and interpretation.
To achieve the required results, the View Flex 2.8 version is used as the machine vision 
software, with the Matrox Inspector version 3.0 being used as the image processing tool. The 
View Flex is provided with an Intel camera that grabs the image. Before capturing the image 
and performing any analysis, the environment is to be calibrated using the Calibration icon 
in the View Flex. The robot used is SCORBOT ER-4u, which is equipped with SCORBASE 
software and a PID controller. The sorting is performed for three matchstick boxes using the 
pattern matching feature of the View Flex (Nagrale & Bagde, 2013).
2 THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
The View Flex interactive vision software is based on the Matrox Inspector Image Process-
ing Engine. The system also includes a USB digital color camera that provides both still and 
video images. The advanced features of the View Flex allow users to implement scientific and 
industrial applications. View Flex software offers an extensive set of optimized functions for 
image processing and enhancement, blob analysis, gauging and measurement, and pattern 
matching. The system supports applications such as precision measurement, flaw detection 
and assembly inspection to enable compliance with exacting quality requirements.
The Matrox Inspector 3.0 is an independent hardware application designed to work inter-
actively with images for image capture, storage and processing applications. Inspector is a 32 
bit Windows-based package, giving the full potential and ease of use of a graphical interface. 
It is capable of running on any system that runs Windows 95/98 or Windows NT 4.0.
2.1 Image processing capabilities
Inspector includes a variety of point-to-point, statistical, spatial filtering, Fourier transform 
and morphological operations. These operations can be used to smooth, accentuate or qual-
ify images. Inspector supports geometric operations, including interpolated resizing, rota-
tion, and distortion correction, as well as polar to rectangular unwrapping. Processing can 
be restricted to rectangular or non-rectangular Region of Interest (ROI). Processing can also 
be restricted to a selected component of a color image.
2.2 Pattern matching capabilities
This enables the finding of a pattern (referred to as a model) in an image, with sub pixel 
accuracy. Pattern matching can help solve machine vision problems, such as alignment and 
the inspection of objects.
2.3 Pattern matching
1. Automatic or manual model creation.
2. Edit model, rotate model, make/load mask, change hotspot values.
3. Apply ‘don’t care’ pixel mask to model.
4. Preprocess model to optimize search speed (circular over scan).
5. Modify default search parameters: model center, search area, positional accuracy, number 
of matches, acceptance threshold, speed, and spacing.
6. Search results: model position and angle, number of model matches in target, match scores.

19
2.4 Blob analysis capabilities
Inspector’s blob analysis capabilities allow the finding and measurement of connected regions 
of pixels (normally called blobs) within a gray scale image. Once these regions are identified, 
features for these regions can be automatically calculated, then the regions that are not of 
interest can be discarded, and the remaining regions classified according to the values of the 
features. The identification is done by the process of segmentation. The applications of blob 
analysis are:
• Presence detection
• Inspection of mechanical parts
• Tissue and material analysis
• Sequence analysis
The values of different blob features can be calculated and the image can be analyzed.
3 PROBLEM STATEMENT
The following experiments are to be conducted with the machine vision software:
I.  To perform pattern matching both with and without the application of the filter (all 
objects the same) in View Flex software using Matrox Inspector as the image process-
ing tool. Also to see the effect of changing the acceptance level.
Description of the objects used: Three similar matchstick boxes were used for the 
purpose of analysis. The boxes were of a similar color, size and brand.
II.  To perform blob analysis on the image and compare the variations in area, 
compactness and roughness in the View Flex machine vision software in conjunc-
tion w.ith Matrox Inspector.
Description of the objects used: The object is a mild steel bar prepared on a lathe 
machine with a taper turning area and a thread cutting area.
The above features of these parts are to be calculated and compared.
4 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

2. Define ROI and click the pattern matching icon. A model window appears.
3. Click the Search button to search for the three occurrences of the model in the image.
4. Change the acceptance level to 60% and 40% in the model window and apply the Search.
5. Apply a smooth filter using the image processing filters/smooth filters. The following dia-
log box appears and applies smooth filters.

 Using the Statistics tab from the result window, the statistics of all of the features can be 
studied. The trends and statistics of the three features are clearly seen in Figures 5, 6 and 7.
Area 2: Thread Cutting Zone
As above, the following results are given below for the thread cutting zone.
These statistics can be summarized in Tables 3 and 4.
The following points can be concluded from the above experiment:
i. There is a greater variation in the values of compactness and area for the taper turning 
zone.
ii. The roughness trend for both zones is very similar, but the thread cutting zone is rougher 
than the taper turning zone.
This type of analysis will be helpful for identifying faulty parts by comparing blob features 
calculated with the set of expected feature values.

6 CONCLUSIONS
Machine vision and robotics are multidisciplinary in the sense that these fields use knowledge 
taken from traditional engineering and computer programming for different parts of the 
process. The image processing with Matrox Inspector was successfully achieved. The pat-
tern matching operation and the blob analysis made with the inspector were also successful. 
Pattern matching helped to sort objects of both the same and different types. The effect of 
applying a filter to the image and changing the acceptance level was studied in the correct 
way. Blob analysis helped to compare the roughness and compactness of two surfaces, which 
can then be given to the robot for use in different applications. Blob analysis helped to find 
out the areas that are not of interest, classify them and then discard them.
7 SCOPE OF FUTURE WORK
The pattern matching analysis can be extended for PCB board for determining whether or not 
the correct numbers of diodes are placed and whether they are structurally intact. FFT analysis 
is also proposed in order to identify consistent spatial patterns in an image, which can be caused 
by systematic noise. Blob analysis can be applied to compare the features of surfaces made by 
different cutting and forming processes. The vision and the robotics system can be used for 
complex pick and place operations with the utilization of blob analysis and pattern matching.

ABSTRACT: This paper presents a system for the automatic driving of plant protection 
robots that also achieves accuracy and reliability. A method based on differential GPS obtains 
high-precision information on position and direction, and the A/B points are collected to 
obtain the AB line of the path planning. The preview point is calculated by using the straight-
line tracking model, and the desired deflection angle is obtained. The electromagnetic 
proportional hydraulic valve is controlled by PWM modulation, through the opening of the 
valve to control the expansion and contraction of the hydraulic cylinder, and the wheel is 
rotated to achieve the purpose of adjusting the turning. The system realizes a control function 
that the plant protection robot can travel straight. The plant protection robot travels at a 
speed of 1.2 m/s, the maximum deviation is 5.3 cm, and the standard deviation is 1.4 cm. The 
test results show that the system can be used for the automatic driving of plant protection 
robots, and it also has reliability.

1 INTRODUCTION
When working conditions are complicated and varied. For the field of work that lack ref-
erence, it is difficult to ensure the direction and spacing of the work by manual judgment, 
which often causes the track to be bent and overlapped. Autonomous driving technology 
therefore came into being. Autopilot technology is a relatively new trend. It is supported by 
information technology, and is used to implement a modern farming technology based on 
satellite positioning (Zhu et al., 2016). If a plant protection machine is equipped with an 
automatic driving system, it will improve the accuracy of operation, reduce repetitive opera-
tions, reduce staff workload, and improve production efficiency.
Automatic driving of agricultural machinery has been widely researched outside China. 
Thomas Bell of Stanford University installed four GPS receiving antennas on the top of a 
tractor cab and studied the application of agricultural vehicle auto-navigation technology by 
using CP-DGPS technology. The position and direction of the vehicle is estimated by measur-
ing the angle of each GPS antenna relative to the satellite and the phase difference of the GPS 
signal (Ji & Zhou, 2014). This not only increases the GPS antennas and improves the cost, but 
also makes the control algorithm more difficult. Takai (Yang et al., 2015) used the real-time 
dynamic difference global positioning system and inertial measurement unit as the naviga-
tional sensor. The test result is that the error of the tractor is 1∼3 cm at different speeds.
Chinese universities are also actively conducting research on autonomous driving of agri-
cultural machinery. Ji and Liu (2009) have developed an automatic navigation and control 
system for agricultural vehicles based on CAN bus. The steering controller is designed by 
the adaptive PID control algorithm and the proportional parameters are adjusted to achieve 
automatic control of the agricultural machinery. However, the accuracy is not high—the 
lateral deviation is 32 cm, and the average deviation is 9 cm. Luo et al. (2009) developed 

24
an automatic navigation control system for tractors based on RTK-GPS. A Dongfanghong 
X-804 tractor was taken as the object of study. Based on the fusion of the kinematics model 
and the steering control model of the agricultural machinery, the state equation of the lin-
ear tracking is derived, and the navigation controller based on PID is designed. A control 
method was proposed, which is to turn across the line.
Plant protection robots acquire high-precision positioning databased on a differential 
GPS; two antennas are used to obtain direction of robot. The preview point and the expected 
deflection angle are calculated by using the straight-line tracking model. Combined with the 
electromagnetic proportional hydraulic valve to control the steering device, we propose a path-
planning method based on the AB line in order to achieve the automatic driving of the robot.
2 RESEARCH PROGRAMME
The automatic driving of plant protection robots requires a three-part design: the vehicle 
body, vehicle-mounted system, and base station system. The vehicle body provides power 
and the steering mechanism. The vehicle-mounted system provides path planning, location 
and control decisions for automatic driving. The base station system provides differential 
information for automatic driving, so that high-precision information can be obtained. The 
overall structure of the GPS automatic driving navigation system is shown in Figure 1.
The GPS differential base station transmits the solved differential data to the receiver through 
the external radio, the obtained dual antenna GPS data are compared with the differential data 
from the receiver, and the information is sent to the Electronic Control Unit (ECU). The ECU 
controls the rotation of the steering wheel by controlling the hydraulic valve, thereby achieving 
the purpose of controlling the direction. The actual steering angle is collected by the angle sen-
sor, and it is fed back to the ECU to complete the closed loop control.
2.1 Vehicle body
In this paper, the vehicle body adopts the electric forklift chassis. It can achieve front and rear 
steering. It provides different steering modes for the autopilot test. It is convenient to com-
pare the advantages and disadvantages of automatic driving under different steering modes.
2.2 The design of the vehicle system
The vehicle system is a comprehensive system that integrates satellite receiving, high-
precision positioning and directional control. The receiver adopts UN257 board, and it 
can be positioned and directed. The electromagnetic proportional hydraulic valve adopts 
PRM2-063Y11, which has the advantages of flexible movement, low impact and vibration, 
low noise and long service life.
2.2.1 The principle of steering control
The principle of automatic driving steering is as follows. The positioning and deviation angle 
are sent to the ECU by the GPS receiver. After the internal processing of the ECU, the offset

will be obtained. Combined with the deviation, the pre-pointing point will be calculated by 
the straight-line tracking model, and then the desired declination will be obtained. The ECU 
controls the opening of the electromagnetic proportional hydraulic valve through PWM 
modulation, then controls the expansion and contraction of the hydraulic cylinder, and turns 
the wheel to achieve the purpose of adjusting the steering. The angle sensor feeds the meas-
ured true angle to the ECU for closed loop control. This is shown in Figure 2.
2.2.2 Hydraulic circuit
The electromagnetic proportional hydraulic valve is installed near the reversing valve. Under 
the premise of not changing the original hydraulic steering system of the robot, three three-
way connections are connected to the reversing valve, namely the left port, the right port and 
the oil return port; we design a parallel oil circuit with the original hydraulic steering system. 
When starting the automatic driving mode, the electromagnetic proportional hydraulic valve 
(the hydraulic valve in Figure 3) starts to work and the high-pressure oil enters the hydraulic 
valve from the P port and controls the left or right turn when in the left or right position. 
When the automatic driving mode is off, the manual adjustment mode will be initiated. At 
this time, the neutral position of the hydraulic valve starts working, the high-pressure oil is 
imported from port P, then passes through the output port to the port P of the reversing 
valve, the reversing valve starts to work and controls the steering by turning the steering 
wheel. This is shown in Figure 3.

2.2.3 The design of closed loop feedback
Angle sensors provide the true corner measurements for automatic driving. The angle sensor 
is fixed to the bracket, and it is coaxial with the rotation centre of the left wheel. It is con-
nected to the wheel through the connecting frame, so it rotates synchronously with the wheel 
to measure the true corner of the wheel. The true corner is fed back to the ECU to complete 
the closed loop control.
2.3 Base station system
The receiver has a built-in chip for interpreting the satellite message, and the satellite signal is 
processed into a fixed position deviation signal by a certain algorithm. The signal is transmit-
ted through the radio. The automatic driving system receives differential signals through the 
vehicle radio, thereby obtaining high-precision positioning data.
3 THE TEST OF AUTOMATIC DRIVING
3.1 Test process
In our system, the high-precision RTK-GPS receiver is used to reduce errors, and it is also 
used to improve measurement efficiency and accuracy of later evaluation.
Before starting the power, it is necessary to establish a GPS-RTK receiver base station. 
Because tall buildings and trees will obscure the satellite signals, the base stations are 
generally installed at a high level to avoid satellite signal interference. After completion of 
construction, the power is turned on, and after the differential signal is transmitted stably 
(the indicator lights are flashing evenly), the next step can be started.
After the base station is set up, the vehicle parameters are first calibrated, because different 
parameters will affect the test data. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a vehicle body 
model to deal with various errors that are caused by the vehicle body, as shown in Table 1.
 Wheelbase: distance between the front and rear axles of the vehicle.
 Height of antenna: the height of the GPS antenna from the ground.
 Offset of antenna: the distance from the longitudinal center of the vehicle to the GPS 
antenna.
 Height of ECU: 1 cm above the bottom of the controller chassis.
 Lateral offset: the longitudinal center axis of the car body to the center of the ECU.
 Vertical offset: ECU to rear center distance.
After the vehicle parameters are calibrated, the left and right angle sensor left and right 
limit calibration is performed. In this paper, the left limit is 1,003, the right limit is 324, and 
the center is 659.
Before the test, we set the interval to 3 m in the path planning and we select a point on the 
ground as point A (south). We drive the robot along the straight line to the other end (about 
60 m), selecting it as point B (north), and generate an AB line (north–south trend).
The automatic driving deviation of the AB line is measured. The plant protection robot 
has a forward speed of 1.2 m/s, and the frequency of GPS data update is 1 Hz. The experi-
mental conditions are sunny. First, the front steering is measured from A to B: the plant 
protection robot is driven to the AB line, at point A, the automatic driving is activated, and

data is collected synchronously. The rear steering is then measured by collecting data from 
B to A.
3.2 Analysis of test data
After processing the collected data, we obtain the deviation and draw a normal distribution 
map, so that we can visually see the straight driving deviation of the automatic driving system.
We want to evaluate the performance index of autonomous driving. According to the 
driving characteristics, we evaluate the deviation between the actual driving route and the 
planning path. Therefore, we use standard deviation and extremum to describe the driving 
performance of the automated driving system.
3.2.1 Data pre-processing
In this study, we use the pre-processing method of experimental data to reduce the interfer-
ence of the outliers generated by the test. It is difficult to ensure that the robot is zero distance 
from the path planning at the beginning of the test and we can only minimize this man-made 
error. Therefore, removing part of the data at the beginning of the test will help to ensure 
the accuracy of the test results. According to mathematical statistics research and analysis, 
combined with MATLAB software for graphical processing, we perform the corresponding 
error analysis.
The raw data of the GPS collected in the experiment uses the WGS-84 coordinate system. 
The WGS-84 coordinate system is a reference system based on the centroid of the Earth. In 
order to carry out the analysis of the test data, the evaluation results must be accurate and 
easy to understand and count. Therefore, when performing the evaluation, it is usually neces-
sary to convert the test data from the Earth coordinates to the plane rectangular coordinates 
by projection.
At present, there are many projection conversion methods commonly used in surveying 
and mapping. Usually, the UTM projection and Gauss-Krüger projection are used for coor-
dinate projection transformation. They are both isometric projections, and the projection 
method is basically the same. However, UTM has no distortion of the projection angle com-
pared to the Gauss-Krüger projection. In addition, X and Y represent longitude and latitude 
(Zhou et al., 2013). The UTM projection is adoptedin the experimental data processing. 
UTM projection positive solution formula, longitude L, latitude B, This is the formula for 
calculating the rectangular coordinates of the plane from the geodetic coordinates (L, B):

3.3 Experimental data processing
In this paper, a large volume of data from the automatic driving of the plant protection robot 
is collected and processed. The sample data include the front steering mode and the rear 
steering mode. In order to effectively reflect the sample of driving deviation, the sample data 
in both modes must be processed. In the following, two data samples are taken as an example 
for detailed description of the data processing. The error analysis is carried out according to 
the error distribution.
First of all, the paper studies the straight driving performance of the plant protection 
robot under automatic driving, so the collected measuring points are linear. The collected 
measuring points are converted into X/Y coordinates using the UTM projection, and then 
using the MATLAB mathematical tool, the straight-line equation is obtained by the least 
squares method of fitting the straight line (He et al., 2011). A normal distribution map is 
made according to the distribution of the error as shown in Figure 4.
The front steering and rear steering of the plant protection robot and their impact on the 
automatic driving deviation are analyzed. The blue dots in Figure 4a and 4b represent the 
traveling trace of the plant protection robot, and the red lines represent the fitted straight 
lines. It can be seen that the deviation of automatic driving is distributed on both sides of 
the line. For the front steering, Figure 4c represents the normal distribution of the deviation 
of automatic driving, where the maximum deviation is 5.3  cm, and the standard devia-
tion σ = 1.4 cm. For the rear steering, Figure 4d represents the normal distribution of the 
deviation of automatic driving, where the maximum deviation is 10.9 cm, and the standard 
deviation σ = 4.6 cm. Among them, 4.6 is greater than 1.4. It shows that when the plant pro-
tection robot is front steering, the automatic driving deviation is more concentrated and the 
automatic driving accuracy is higher. This is because when front steering, the steering system 
only drives the front wheel to turn. The rotating instantaneous center of the robot is mostly

near the axis of the rear axle, and the steering of the robot is consistent with the steering of 
the front wheel. When rear steering, the steering system only drives the rear wheel to turn. 
The rotating instantaneous center of the robot is mostly near the axis of the front axle, and 
the steering of the robot is opposite to the steering of the rear wheel. However, the automatic 
driving system measures the information is the position and direction of the robot, so the 
front steering is more consistent.
As shown in Figure 4, firstly, the performance of the plant protection robot based on 
differential GPS, combined with an electromagnetic proportional hydraulic valve to control 
the steering, and using an AB line to plan the path in the automatic driving mode, has high 
precision and stability along a straight line, and it can meet normal operations of plant 
protection. Second, under the conditions of this test, the front steering of the plant protection 
robot is significantly better than the rear steering.
4 CONCLUSION
The automatic driving system of a plant protection robot based on differential GPS, has the 
advantages of high accuracy and strong stability. The maximum deviation is 5.3 cm and the 
standard deviation is 1.4 cm. Position and direction information are based on differential 
GPS, and an AB line is used as the planning path to achieve the linear navigation of the plant 
protection robot. The preview point and the expected deflection angle are calculated by using 
the straight-line tracking model. The opening and direction of the electromagnetic propor-
tional hydraulic valve are controlled by PWM modulation, controlling the expansion and 
contraction of the hydraulic cylinder, thus driving the wheel to rotate. The system achieves 
precise control of straight-line tracing and the tests show that the front steering of the plant 
protection robot is significantly better than the rear steering. This applies to plant protection 
robots that have hydraulic steering systems.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, navigation has been a hot topic in the field of robotics, and 
machine vision is the most common method of autonomous navigation. Vision-based robot 
navigation is first studied, based on the three corresponding areas of pattern recognition, 
pattern matching and 3D reconstruction. Then the current situation and prospects for vari-
ous types of algorithms are discussed, which include the algorithms of obstacle detection, 
stereo matching and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). The advantages and 
disadvantages of different algorithms are summarized. Finally, the prospects for robot navi-
gation technology are discussed, and the algorithm framework that may be useful for related 
research fields is summarized.
Keywords: Quadruped robot, obstacle detection, stereo matching, SLAM
1 INTRODUCTION
With the development of robot technology, the research and development of the quadruped 
robot has become increasingly focused on autonomy. This requires the functions of envi-
ronment perception, terrain modeling and autonomous navigation, in addition to the basic 
operational function of the robot. Genuine autonomous navigation requires a quadruped 
robot to explore a completely unknown environment and establish an environmental map. As 
for the problems that accompany this process, the navigation can be defined in terms of three 
questions, namely, ‘Where am I?’, ‘Where am I going?’ and ‘How do I get there?’ The first 
and second questions can be answered by providing the robot with appropriate sensors, while 
the third question can be answered by using effective system navigation planning. Vision-
based autonomous robot navigation can roughly be divided into two categories: systems 
that require prior knowledge of the environment in which they will be operating (in this case 
the systems require maps/folders), and systems that can see the environmental conditions in 
which they will navigate (Rahmani et al., 2015). Obviously, mapless navigation is much more 
complicated than navigation based on a map. Mapless navigation systems mostly involve 
technologies that use vision information from image segmentation, optical flow, and feature 
matching.
2 OBSTACLE DETECTION
Any object that forms an impediment in the path of a robot can be called an obstacle. In 
the process of mobile real-time autonomous robot movement and navigation, it is necessary 
to achieve obstacle avoidance. In recent years, the application of visual sensors to mobile 

32
robot navigation has attracted more and more attention. The main function of visual obsta-
cle avoidance is to identify all kinds of scenes from visual information and determine the 
feasible operational region for the mobile robot.
2.1 Obstacle detection based on feature matching
Obstacle detection based on feature matching is the simplest method. It detects some special 
and obvious features of obstacles, such as edge, texture and shape. These methods perform 
image segmentation or pixel classification through color or edge information (Lowe, 2004).
2.1.1 Obstacle detection based on color
This method mainly uses the color difference between roads and obstacles to distinguish 
feasible areas from suspicious obstacles. In general, mobile robot vision obstacle avoidance 
systems mainly adopt the Hue-Intensity-Saturation (HIS) color system (She & Huang, 1994; 
Dima & Hebert, 2005; Batavia & Singh, 2001; Kunt, 1982). However, because the color of 
shadow, water-trace and leaves are not consistent with the color of a road, and may be mis-
takenly placed into the obstacle area, so we can only define the area as being a suspicious 
obstacle area by differentiating between the color information.
2.1.2 Obstacle detection by edge detection
Edge is the most basic feature of an image, which is the junction of the image region and 
another region, the place where the regional attributes are mutated, and the most concentrated 
part of the image information. Extracting edges can distinguish obstacles from backgrounds 
(Dhankhar & Sahu, 2013). There are three categories of image edge extraction methods. The 
first is based on some fixed local operation methods, such as differential and quasi-legality, 
which are classical edge extraction methods. The common differential operators include the 
Robert crossover operator, the Sobel operator, the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) operator 
and the Canny (1986) operator (Janani et al., 2012). The second category is the global extrac-
tion method based on the criterion of energy minimization, and the extraction of edges from 
the perspective of global optimization, such as relaxation and neural networks (Etemad & 
Chelappa, 1993). The third category has developed in recent years, such as the wavelet trans-
form, mathematical morphology, and shape theory. These image edge extraction methods 
have good time-frequency local characteristics. A novel feature extraction method called 
robust sparse linear discriminant analysis is proposed by Wen et al. (2018), which can select 
the most discriminative features for discriminant analysis.
2.2 Obstacle detection based on motion
Motion detection involves the following algorithmic methods: background subtraction 
(Tougaard, 1989; Xiao et al., 2003); frame difference (Zhan et al., 2007; Chu et al., 2007); opti-
cal flow (Alard & Lupton, 1998; Horn & Schunck, 1981). Background subtraction is a method 
to detect moving objects by comparing the current frame and background reference image, 
and its performance depends on a background modeling technique. It is suitable for the target 
detection of a larger and significant motion deformation obstacle, but the effect is not ideal in 
the case of uneven or multi-bend roads. The optical-flow algorithm was originally proposed by 
Horn and Schunck (1981), and the principle of this algorithm uses the information of the sur-
rounding environment at different times and estimates the optical flow through a sequence of 
images. The disadvantage is that when the contrast between the obstacle and the background 
is too small, or there is noise, shadow, transparency or occlusion, the calculated optical-flow 
distribution is not very reliable and accurate, and it has a poor real-time ability.
2.3 Obstacle detection based on stereo matching
The feature-matching algorithm or motion algorithm are monocular-vision obstacle-
detection methods which are based on a single-frame image, and a single-frame image can 

33
easily lose depth information of a scene. However, stereo vision can obtain 3D information 
about objects (Sun et al., 2003; Kanade, 1994). The commonly used detection methods are 
mainly based on binocular vision and multi-vision. Binocular vision directly simulates the 
human vision system. The basic principles of binocular vision are: first, the scene images are 
obtained from two angles with two identical cameras; then, stereo matching is performed to 
generate a disparity map; finally, depth information about the obstacle is calculated according 
to the inside and outside parameters of the camera and the disparity map.
3 STEREO-MATCHING ALGORITHMS
The study of stereo matching began in the middle of the last century. At MIT, Robert 
extended 2D image analysis to 3D scene analysis, which marked the birth of computer stereo 
vision technology and developed rapidly into a new subject (Faugeras, 1993). At the end of 
the last century, the visual computing theory created by Marr had a great influence on the 
development of stereo vision (Sonka et al., 1993) and has given rise to a relatively complete 
system, from image acquisition to the visual surface reconstruction of scenery.
3.1 Deployment of vision sensors
There are many visual-sensor configuration methods for quadruped robots. These include 
monocular vision, binocular stereo vision, multilocular stereo vision and panoramic vision. 
In addition, the combination of vision sensors and laser or ultrasound sensors has been 
widely used. Among these, the most common configuration method in autonomous naviga-
tion is binocular vision. In this method, the features from the left and right cameras can be 
matched by the geometric constraint of the outer pole line, the depth information of the 
scene can be provided on the premise of the established frame rate, and the complete feature 
information is extracted to facilitate the feature initialization.
3.2 Stereo-matching primitives
To improve the accuracy of matching and reduce the ambiguity of matching points, we need 
to select the best matching primitives to represent images. The matching primitives used in 
most matching algorithms include image color, grayscale, phase, texture, gradient, and edge 
and corner information. In order to increase the robustness of the matching, these basic 
elements are usually used in combination. According to the differences of the primitives 
used, stereo matching can be divided into three parts: the matching algorithm based on the 
region (Veksler, 2003), the feature (Venkateswar & Chellappa, 1995) and the phase (Chan 
et al., 2006).
3.3 Stereo-matching strategy
The most commonly used matching algorithms are the global-optimal matching algorithm 
and the local-optimal matching algorithm (Tombari et al., 2008). To avoid the effect of local 
extrema, the global energy function is established in the global algorithm, which mainly 
includes the smoothing constraints and similar data items. Then the global-optimization 
method is used to minimize the global energy function, to get the globally optimal disparity 
distribution. The most commonly used global-optimal matching algorithms are graph cuts 
(Hong & Chen, 2004), belief propagation (Sun et al., 2005), neural networks, and genetic. 
The disparity obtained from global matching algorithms is more accurate, but is not suit-
able for real-time processing because of its low speed. The local matching algorithm directly 
solves the local energy optimal results on the respective matching regions. This algorithm 
has low complexity and fast computation speed, so it can meet real-time requirements. How-
ever, due to the lack of global constraints, the local algorithm is vulnerable to local noise, 
object deformation and occlusion. The local matching algorithms can be divided into three 

34
categories: adaptive-window stereo-matching algorithms, adaptive-weight stereo-matching 
algorithms and multi-window stereo-matching algorithms (Adhyapak et al., 2007).
4 SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION AND MAPPING (SLAM)
Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) is a prerequisite for realizing the real auton-
omy of mobile robots. Autonomous navigation requires robots to explore in a completely 
unknown environment, establish environmental maps, locate accurately, and implement plan-
ning tasks. For a long time, the research of mapping and positioning have been independ-
ent. The location research requires a priori maps guidance. In addition, the mapping research 
requires the robot’s position and posture. Smith et al. (1988) proposed a probabilistic method 
to solve two aspects simultaneously, which uncovered the prelude to the study of SLAM. 
EKF-SLAM is a remarkable early SLAM which was designed by Paz et al. (2008). Based on 
Conditionally Independent Divide and Conquer, it was able to operate in larger environments, 
robustly and in real time. ORB-SLAM is a feature-based SLAM system that operates in real 
time, in small and large indoor and outdoor environments (Mur-Artal et al., 2015).
4.1 Reconstruction of 3D environment
3D information of scene acquisition and terrain construction by binocular vision is a pre-
requisite for a robot to walk autonomously in an unknown environment. The result of stereo 
matching is just some disparity information, and the 3D information of the scene is restored 
using a reprojection matrix of the disparity map. Using the internal and external parameters 
obtained by the camera calibration, the disparity map is converted to a depth map based on 
z(x,y) = f × b/d(x,y), in which f is the camera focal length, b is the baseline length, and d(x,y) 
and z(x,y) are the disparity and depth of pixel (x,y), respectively.
4.2 Implementation mechanism of SLAM
SLAM includes Visual Odometry (VO), optimization, loop closing, and mapping. VO esti-
mates rough camera motion according to the information of adjacent images, and provides 
a good initial value for the back end. The back end of SLAM is optimization, which reduces 
the noise of SLAM. Loop closing is used to solve the problem of time drift.
SLAM is usually solved as an a posteriori probability estimation. SLAM can be divided 
into two major categories, filter and nonlinear optimization, involving techniques such as the 
Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Particle Filters (PFs) and pose graphs.
The Kalman filter has the advantages of simplicity and astringency, but the linear hypoth-
esis of the system model is not established in many cases. EKF is the generalization of the 
Kalman filter in nonlinear systems. However, because there are many more visual features, 
and the complexity of SLAM based on EKF is the square of the characteristic number, so it 
is difficult to adapt to a large-scale environment (Miro et al., 2005).
PFs are a sequential Monte Carlo filtering method, which use some samples (particles) 
set to approximate the a posteriori probability of SLAM. PFs can represent any robot prob-
ability model expressed by the Markov chain, and have the advantage of easy realization. 
However, the probability distribution of high dimensional space requires many particles. Rao-
Blackwellized Particle Filters (RBPFs) (Miller & Campbell, 2007) are used to solve this prob-
lem: the approach divides the state space into an independent part and marginalizes one or more 
components of the part, providing an algorithm for simplifying the probability estimation.
5 CONCLUSION AND PROSPECTS
As this paper shows, much has already been accomplished in vision-based quadruped robot 
navigation. If the goal is to send the quadruped robot from one coordinate location to 

35
another, there is enough accumulated expertise to design a mobile robot that could achieve 
this within a typical building. However, if the goal is to carry out function-driven navigation, 
we are still eons away from achieving this.
With the development of machine vision technology and AI technology, how to understand 
the environment like a human being is the new direction for the vision-based autonomous robot.

ABSTRACT: Conventional power factor correction topologies like boost PFC, which have 
a rectifier on the input side, may cause conduction loss and low converting efficiency. Much 
more bridgeless PFC topologies have been developed and researched to improve efficiency 
and minimize conduction loss of overall systems. Input voltage inspection, current detection 
and common mode noise are significant issues in bridgeless PFC topologies. In this paper, an 
improved OCC bridgeless PFC control strategy, based on a peak current sampling approach, 
is proposed. In addition, simulations have been carried out through implementation of 
MATLAB and Simulink to verify a proposed control system. A bridgeless PFC with a low 
EMI circuit is demonstrated by applying IR1155S as a proof of the design.
Keywords: One-cycle control, bridgeless PFC, efficiency, electromagnetic interference, total 
harmonic distortion
1 INTRODUCTION
Conventional boost Active Power Factor Correction (APFC) topology with a rectifier always 
has at least three semiconductor devices operating during switch on or off status. Large con-
duction loss would exist in low input and high power applications (Figuerido et al., 2010). To 
improve converter efficiency, a bridgeless boost PFC topology has been proposed in recent 
years (shown in Figure 1). In this design, there is no bridge rectifier and the inductor is located 
at the AC side, the converter is considered as a double boost converter when operating in nega-
tive half cycle (Darly et al., 2010), and under each operating status, current only flows through 
two semiconductor devices which leads to low conduction loss. From Figure 1, input and out-
put sides of bridgeless PFC converters are not connected directly, and the traditional detection 
methods of voltage and current are unavailable, which leads to a challengeable control system 
compared with conventional APFC circuits (Li et al., 2009; Ribeiro et al., 2010).
Figure 1. Typical bridgeless boost PFC topology.

A small resistor connected in series at the main circuit, is considered as one of the most 
common methods to detect inductor current with no need of isolation (Pengju et al., 2009). 
For bridgeless PFC converters, isolated detection has to be carried out since inductor 
current and output side was not in common ground. Furthermore, the inductor current 
in bridgeless PFCs is bidirectional, which is different from the single direction inductor 
current in traditional PFCs (Choi et al., 2008). A proper control strategy and reliable control 
system has become one of the significant issues in the research of bridgeless PFC converters 
(Huber et al., 2008).
2 OCC CONTROL STRATEGIES
2.1 Typical OCC operating principles
Based on boost PFC operating principles of One-Cycle Control (OCC): Uin is the Input 
Voltage after Rectifier; Uo is Output Voltage; Ts is the Switching Period; and DTs is the Switch 
Conducting Time. To achieve a power factor correction, Uin is given by

2.2 Improved OCC control strategy
The IR1155S controller was designed for AC/DC PFC applications, which may cause large 
harmonic distortion when the circuit has a small inductance or operates under DCM or 
CRM modes. To prevent harmonic distortion resulting from peak current sampling, an 
improved OCC approach has been proposed based on the IR1155 controller (Wang et al., 
2008). From Equation 5

In order to decrease influence caused by electromagnetic interference, a two-diode 
bridgeless boost PFC topology was researched. A new PFC control strategy based on an 
OCC IR1155 is proposed and the overall system is presented in Figure 2. The boost inductor 
is split and located at the AC side to construct the boost structure (Masumoto et al., 2013). 
In positive half line cycle, MOSFET S1 and boost diode D1, together with the boost 
inductor, constructs a boost DC/DC converter. Meanwhile, MOSFET S2 is operating as a 
simple diode. The input current is controlled by the boost converter and follows the input 
voltage. During the other half line cycle, the circuit operation operates the same way. Thus, 
in each half line cycle, one of the MOSFET operates as an active switch and the other one 
operates as a diode; both the MOSFETs can be driven by the same signal (Su et al., 2011).
3 SIMULATION AND ANALYSIS
The simulation of an improved bridgeless PFC converter is carried out through the imple-
mentation of a proposed control strategy in MATLAB and Simulink (see Figure  3). As 
shown in Figure 4, the input voltage scales down 10 times and the input current is perfectly 
sinusoidal with input voltage. In addition, Figure 5 demonstrates the output voltage of the 
overall system with a ripple of 10 V (De Gusseme et al; 2005; El Aroudi et al., 2013).

4 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Based on the analysis above, the bridgeless PFC circuit can simplify the circuit topology and 
improve the efficiency; the OCC is the most attractive control method for the bridgeless PFC 
circuit. Figure 6 shows the prototype of the 2.5 kW improved bridgeless PFC. All voltage 
waveforms were obtained through differential probes. The input power, PF and thermal 
harmonic distortion were measured by a Tektronix PA1000 single phase power analyzer. 
The output power was measured by two Keysight 34465A digital multimeters.
Figure 7 presents the experimental curve of 220 V AC input voltage (blue) and inductor 
current (pink) at 2.5 kW load. The input current perfectly follows the input voltage. Thus, the 
power factor correction function is achieved by using an OCC.

Figure 8 shows the efficiency curves measured at both 220 V AC input voltage with a 0 Ω 
turn-on gate resistor and a 10 Ω turn-off gate resistor. It can be seen that the overall efficiency 
of a bridgeless PFC converter is above 96% at nominal load.

AC, Vout = 400 V AC and L = 880 uH. The power factor reaches around 0.99 from half load 
to full load variations.

5 CONCLUSION
Conventional PFC operating principles and control strategies were analyzed. In order to 
reduce conducting loss and improve converting efficiency, bridgeless PFC topology was pro-
posed gradually, though input voltage detection, current detection and EMI have not been 
solved effectively. This paper investigated the control logic of a traditional bridgeless PFC 
converter as well as proposing a new control strategy based on the OCC approach. Through 
carrying out the simulation and experimental works, the proposed improved bridgeless PFC 
converter is able to make a low EMI noise. A 2.5 kW bridgeless PFC prototype was devel-
oped and the experimental results demonstrate the design of a new control strategy which is 
able to achieve power factor correction.

ABSTRACT: With the massive increase of drivers in developing countries, training time in 
driving school has become limited and better utilization of resources is an emerging problem. 
This paper introduces the method of using Verilog HDL to develop I2C and UART transmit-
ter state machine based on FPGA and gyroscope. The modeling in Unity3D software on PC 
is discussed and implemented by controlling a 3D car, which lays the foundation of practical 
driving for users with Virtual Reality (VR) technology. Simulation results of system functions 
verify the validity and stability of the system.
Keywords: FPGA, State Machine, VR
1 INTRODUCTION
With the increase of automotive application scenarios, driving has become an indispensable 
skill. Especially in developing countries such as China and India, the number of driving 
school students has risen significantly. However, the learning resources in driving school are 
limited, resulting in emerging problems such as waiting time is longer than actual training 
time, and the time utilization efficiency is low. This paper therefore proposes an approach 
to improve time utilization at driving school: to simulate car driving using a new human-
computer interaction method.
Taking advantages of virtual reality (VR) technology, drive training can be enhanced with 
an alternative and more economic approach before getting into actual vehicles. VR forms 
a new human-computer interaction mode between the virtual world and the real world. By 
creating dynamic driving scenes in VR, the tool can be used to simulate different real driving 
conditions while providing trainees practical experience without driving the actual vehicle. 
Many VR programming tools have been created, in which Unity3D is an application devel-
opment tool that makes it easy to create 3D video games.
On the other hand, FPGA can flexibly modify logic control according to design require-
ments and make full use of hardware resources (Niu, 2006). By implementing FPGA in Uni-
ty3D, this paper proposes using an FPGA-based gyroscope to control a 3D model car. The 
design and implementation are presented in the following sections, in which Section 2 illus-
trates the detailed model architecture design, and Section 3 discusses the functional analysis 
and state machine design. Section 4 then presents the test validation results, and finally Sec-
tion 5 concludes the finding of this paper and lays down the foundation for future work.
2 ARCHITECTURE DESIGN
The model architecture development is shown in the following subsections. In order to real-
ize the X-axis position data acquisition from the gyroscope to FPGA, transfer the position 
information to Unity 3D on the PC-side, and then control the 3D model car using game 
development software, the design needs to complete the following steps:

46
2.1 Communication between FPGA and PC
It is established that in order to send data via the serial port, the design needs to follow the 
prescribed protocol (Yang, 2011). Communication algorithm uses the serial port module to 
send the position data to the PC end, and uses the PC serial port debugging assistant tool to 
test whether the received data satisfies the required programming format, and hence realizes 
the effective data transmission between the FPGA and the PC.
2.2 Communication between FPGA and gyroscope
The second step is the communication between the FPGA and the gyroscope. To achieve this, the 
design uses I2C synchronous communication protocol (He, 2004), which is shown in Figure 1.
The communication protocol is briefly stated as below:
Data transmission: When SCL is high and the SDA line is stable, the SDA is transmitting 
bit data; if the SDA changes, it indicates the start or end of the session. Acknowledge (ACK) 
occurs at SDA low.
Data change: SDA can change only when SCL is low.
The design requires the programming of an I2C communication module to communicate with 
the gyroscope. In order to obtain the desired angle information from the gyroscope, the internal 
register of the gyroscope should be configured after power-on, the main function register is ini-
tialized, and then the angle information is obtained from the gyroscope through the I2C module.
2.3 Serial data transfer protocol
Since FPGA and PC only use serial communication, in order for the PC to distinguish differ-
ent received data such as the angle X and the button status, the main control module in the 
FPGA needs to be programmed to encode before using the serial port to send data. The data 
processing rules are defined as follows:
Every time the serial port sends a data packet, use a newline character ‘/n’ as the end 
marker, and use ‘|’ to distinguish different data. The specifications of the data sent by each 
package are as follows:
|Gyroscope x-axis angle | Acceleration button status | Deceleration button status Newline (‘/n’).
The gyroscope data is represented by 16 bits. The design maps the 16-bit binary data to a 
4-digit quaternary number, and then converts each bit into an ASCII code. The conversion 
is shown in Figure 2.
The acceleration and deceleration button states are converted to ASCII codes ‘0’ and ‘1’ 
and sent to the serial port, with ‘0’ for release, and ‘1’ for pressing.
For example, if the sending gyroscope is placed horizontally (the x-axis angle is 0), the 
acceleration button is pressed, and the deceleration button is released. The data received by 
the serial port should be as follows:
 
| 0000 | 1 | 0 (‘/n’) 
Figure 1. I2C synchronous communication.

47
2.4 Function realization
In order to achieve a good driving experience, the design uses Unity 3D software for scene devel-
opment. Based on the existing car and track models in the software, additional data received 
from the serial port can be decoded and vehicle control codes can be programmed and inte-
grated. At the same time, continuous improvements are made to enhance the game experience.
2.5 Circuit diagram/hardware connection diagram
The circuit has a USB to TTL module, gyroscope MPU6050, and button switch. Each device 
is connected as shown in Figure 3.
2.6 Overall module layout diagram
The overall module layout diagram is illustrated in Figure 4. There are four main modules 
including the clock, main control module, communication protocol module, and the top-
level module for the serial port send.
clk is the global clock.
uart_tx is the top-level module to send by the serial port, in which the module uart_send 
sends data according to the protocol, and the baud rate module clock_set_tx generates the 
serial port clock signal to control the serial port transmission rate. The two modules use the 
uart_tx as the top-level module for external call.
Figure 2. Serial data transmission data frame format.
Figure 3. Hardware connection diagram.

48
i2c_tran is an I2C communication protocol module with an external interface, which 
can perform external I/O information control to realize read and write operations in I2C 
communication.
main_control is the main control module, which is used to control the I2C module to initial-
ize and read data from the gyroscope. It processes and packages the received data and then 
uses the serial port module to send.
3 FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS AND STATE MACHINE DESIGN
After the model is established, this section discusses the detailed functional analysis of the 
model and presents the state machine design to achieve these functions.
3.1 Serial port transmitter module
The serial port transmitter module design setting baud rate is 38400, with no parity, and 1stop bit.
To generate a 38400 baud rate, the design uses a clock division to divide the 8 MHz main 
clock clk to produce a 38400 Hz clock signal. At the same time, the enable signal start is set, 
so that the baud rate clock uart_clk_tx is generated only when the enable signal appears. 
When the 8-bit data to be transmitted is sent, the end signal of the data transmission finish is 
received, and the baud rate clock is terminated.
FPGA programming is suitable for parallel operation. In order to enable the module to send 
data according to the communication protocol, the state machine is designed to realize the 
switching of different states, that is, the state of the start bit, the data bit and the stop bit. The 
serial port transmission state machine is shown in Figure 5. Where uart_txd is the txd data line, 
start is the serial port send enable signal, and finish is the serial port send stop signal.
3.2 I2C communication module
I2C communication module is used in the design to enable intra-board communication. The 
I2C communication module contains 9 input and output pins:
 
CLK, SDA, SCL, RST, ENABLE, DATA, W_R, IO_ERROR, REGS,
where CLK is the system clock; SDA is the data transmission line; SCL is the communica-
tion clock; RST is the reset signal; ENABLE is the chip enable signal; DATA is the received 
data register; W_R is the read/write enable signal; IO_ERROR is the error signal (gyroscope

not responding); REGS16 is the bit register, in which the high eight bits store the gyroscope 
register address, and the low eight bits store the initialization register input data.
In order for the module to receive and send data correctly according to the I2C protocol, 
the program sets 14 state machines. The read and write operations are defined by the state 
machines to perform their roles, respectively. The communication state machines are shown 
in Figure 6.
3.3 Main control module
The main control module includes the gyroscope control sub-module and the serial port 
control sub-module.
3.3.1 Gyroscope control
The main control module main_control uses a frequency divider to generate a series of 
ordered clock signals to control the I2C and UART modules. The I2C and UART modules 
work on two timelines respectively, where i2c_change is used to switch the working state of 
the i2c module, and uart_rst is used to switch the send data in the serial port.
Figure 5. Serial port transmission state machine.
Figure 6. I2C communication state machines.

50
The main control module builds state machines when extracting data from the gyroscope 
and sending data to the serial port. The gyroscope control state machine is shown in Figure 7. 
The system is in the state_idle state after initial or reset. When the i2c_change pulse occurs, 
the state machine switches to the next state state_init_pwr. When state machine is in the fol-
lowing states, state_idle, state_init_pwr, state_init_smplrt, state_init_config1, state_init_gyro, 
and state_init_accel, the I2C module will be called to write data to the gyroscope register 
and initialize its power management register. It then loops in the last four state machines, 
state_read_gyroH, state_read_gyroL, state_read_accelH, and state_read_accelL, constantly 
calling the I2C module to read data from the gyroscope.
3.3.2 Serial port control
The serial port control state machine is shown in Figure 8, which is used to send data to the 
serial port in a certain frame format. The state machine is a loop structure, and the initial

transmission value is 0 × 7C-8 bit separator, which is ‘|’. Then the data is converted to quater-
nary data and then converted from bit to bit to ASCII code and sent to the serial port. It is 
followed by the 8-bit separator 0 × 7C, the converted accelerator button value, another 8-bit 
separator 0 × 7C, the converted brake button value, the carriage return 0 × 0D, and last the 
newline character 0 × 0 A. This sends a set of packed data frames from the serial port to the 
PC. The serial write port of the PC takes a line of the data each time, and the data is sorted 
to the corresponding place according to the separator so that parsing and transformation can 
be realized, hence controlling the car.
3.4 Unity-based vehicle model control module
Finally, the Unity-based vehicle model control module is integrated to achieve the model 
car control. 
3.4.1 Module description
The design uses the Unity3D physical model to design part of the control code, enhancing 
the driving experience and maximizing the advantages of the gyroscope.
3.4.2 Control strategy design
The program reads the serial data, including the data sent from the FPGA to the gyroscope’s 
X-axis and the two button switch data.
The gyroscope X-axis will be used to control the steering of the car model. The serial 
port can receive gyroscope X-axis data from −80° to +80°, which is sufficient for automotive 
steering requirements. In addition, the design ignores the −5° to +5° deflection to prevent the 
small-scale jitter that can cause unexpected steering of the car model. To provide a friendly 
operating experience, the design reduces steering sensitivity so that it reduces the risk that the 
vehicle is out of control caused by oversteering.
4 TEST EVALUATION
Test validation results are provided in this section to verify the effectiveness of the model and 
control strategy. Simulation of system functions and stability of the system are studied in details.
4.1 Serial port transmitter module
The serial port starts to send an 8-bit separator 0 × 7C, which is ‘|’. The test result is analyzed 
by the logic analyzer. The result is shown in Figure 9:
Figure 9. Serial port transmission test result.

52
Figure 11. I2C test result of read.
Figure 10. I2C test result of write.
4.2 I2C communication module
As the gyroscope is connected, the I2C write protocol waveform obtained from the logic 
analyzer is shown in Figure 10. Write 0 × 00 into the gyroscope register 0 × 6B, the gyroscope 
sends the response signal, and the data is successfully written.
As the gyroscope is connected, the I2C read protocol waveform obtained from the logic 
analyzer is shown in Figure 11. Obtained from the 0 × 44 register, it can be seen that the gyro-
scope sends a response signal and transmits the data. After receiving the data, a non-response 
signal NAK is generated, indicating obtaining the data from the gyroscope is successful.

53
4.3 Main control module—serial receiver
By using debugging assistant, the test results at the PC serial port are shown in Figure 12.
It can be seen that the PC-side serial port debugging assistant test analysis results meet the 
code requirements.
5 CONCLUSION
This paper proposes a state machine design based on FPGA + gyroscope to control a 3D 
model car, and discusses its potential to implement for VR technology integrated with life 
scenes. The model has been verified with high stability and practical real-time performance. 
However, since VR technology is still in its infancy stage, which results in expensive equip-
ment cost, technical difficulty and insufficient database, this article does not implement VR 
technology in testing, and related work needs further research in the future.

Ultra-low-altitude airdrop fuzzy sliding-mode control for a 
cargo-stuck fault
W. Wei, X.X. Sun & X.F. Deng
Equipment Management and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Engineering College, Air Force Engineering 
University, Xi’an, China
ABSTRACT: To solve the problem of cargo suddenly becoming stuck on the guide rail 
during the traction stage of ultra-low-altitude reloading of air cargo, a fuzzy sliding-mode 
variable structure control method with input and output feedback linearization is proposed. 
Firstly, according to the aircraft dynamics equation, a longitudinal mathematical model of 
the aircraft under the condition of a cargo-stuck fault is derived, and then the mathematical 
model is decoupled and linearized using input–output feedback linearization theory. Further-
more, a fuzzy sliding-mode controller with fuzzy control theory and sliding-control method 
is designed to track the system speed and attitude angle. Finally, the simulation results show 
that the designed controller has a good control effect.
Keywords: ultra-low-altitude airdrop, cargo stuck, feedback linearization, fuzzy control, 
sliding-mode control
1 INTRODUCTION
Ultra-low-altitude airdrop (Gurfil et al., 2010; Zang et al., 2013; Li, 2005) refers to large-scale 
transport aircraft descending smoothly to a height of three to ten meters above the ground, and 
equipment then being delivered to designated areas. Ultra-low-altitude airdrops have increas-
ingly been valued by experts and scholars because of their long operating range, strong maneu-
verability, fast response, good concealment characteristics, and timely and efficient support. In 
the case of an ultra-low-altitude airdrop, the pilot’s reaction time must be short because of the 
close proximity of the aircraft to the ground. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the problem 
of the safety of the aircraft when a sudden fault occurs, such as a cargo-stuck fault.
There is much research on reloading airdrop technology, both in China and further afield. 
Sun et al. (2016), Ouyang and Ding (1992) and Liu et al. (2013) used a method of separation 
modeling to study deeply the relationship between cargo and transporting aircraft, and com-
prehensively considered various influencing factors to establish a higher-accuracy model, 
closer to the actual airdrop. Liu et al. (2015) considered the airdrop model, which is decou-
pled and linearized by the use of feedback linearization theory. The designed second-order 
sliding-mode controller can track the attitude angle and speed of the carrier. Furthermore, 
Zhang et al. (2014) and Yang and Lu (2012a) proposed a control method with a sliding-mode 
disturbance observer control and backstepping control technology for reloading the airdrop 
system. In addition, on the basis of the equation of motion of the aircraft, Dai et al. (2013) 
analyzed the force between the cargo and the aircraft when the cargo is stationary, sliding or 
stuck, and established a dynamic equation for the conveyor under the corresponding condi-
tions, designing a fuzzy control to control the airdrop process.
On the basis of the above, this paper designs a fuzzy sliding-mode controller based on feed-
back linearization for the ultra-low-altitude airdrop model of a cargo-stuck fault. Firstly, the 
cargo-stuck model is linearized by utilizing feedback linearization theory. Then, two fuzzy 
logic controllers are designed to adaptively adjust the control parameters of the sliding-mode 

56
controller. The result has strong robustness and anti-interference ability while eliminating the 
chatter of the sliding-mode controller. Finally, the simulation results show that the designed 
method has good robustness and can meet the task performance indicators.
2 AIRDROP KINETIC MODEL WITH A CARGO-STUCK FAULT CONDITION
2.1 Cargo dynamics model
Combined with the basic principles of theoretical mechanics, the force of the cargo-stuck 
fault is analyzed. The interaction force between the cargo and the aircraft can be obtained 
from the dynamic equation of the cargo (Sun et al., 2016). The acceleration of the cargo is 
analyzed and obtained by the acceleration synthesis theorem (Yang & Lu, 2012b). The abso-
lute acceleration aa of the cargo is the vector sum of the implied acceleration ai, the relative 
acceleration ar and the coriolis acceleration ac, that is:

2.2 Aircraft kinematics equation
Consider the cargo as a mass point and only in longitudinal motion. The force relationship 
of the aircraft is shown in Figure 1.
In Figure 1, o is the center of mass of the aircraft, mb is the mass of the aircraft, g is 
the acceleration of gravity, V is the flight speed of the aircraft, θ, γ and α represent the 
pitch angle, the climb angle and the angle of attack, respectively. The load on the aircraft 
mainly involves gravity G, lift L, air resistance D, thrust T, cargo pressure on the aircraft 
Fcz and friction Fcx, and the torque experienced mainly consists of pitching aerodynamic 
moment My, generated by aerodynamic force and cargo movement. Disturbance torque 
is Mc.
Because the height and speed of the airdrop changes little, the formula for calculating the 
engine thrust can be simplified as:
 
T
T
Tm
p
T
+
T0
T
δ p  
(10)
where Tm is the maximum thrust of the engine, δp is the throttle-opening coefficient.
Because the altitude of the aircraft during the airdrop process is not much changed, 
the aerodynamic forces and aerodynamic moments can be linearly approximated as in

Because the aircraft is very close to the ground during an ultra-low-altitude airdrop, the 
outer-ring Proportional–Integral–Derivative (PID) control link is designed to adjust the 
flight altitude of the aircraft through the altitude change relationship H

 to 
ensure the flight safety.
3 LINEARIZATION AND DECOUPLING

to be decoupled and linearized by using the input and output precise linearization method. 
The system output is selected as H

5 FUZZY CONTROLLER DESIGN
This section introduces the design of the fuzzy sliding-mode controller with adaptive sliding-
mode surface slope, adaptive control-gain fuzzy controller and the double fuzzy sliding-mode 
variable structure controller.
5.1 Sliding-surface slope fuzzy controller design
When designing the fuzzy logic sliding-mode controller with adaptive sliding-mode surface 
slope, the slope of the sliding surface is calculated dynamically based on the state of the sys-
tem and its derivative. The structure of the controller is shown in Figure 2.
The fuzzy controller input is the error and the derivative of the error. The membership 
function of the fuzzy input is shown in Figure 3a and 3b, using NB, NM, NS, Z, PS, PM and 
PB to represent Negative Big, Negative Medium, Negative Small, Zero, Positive Small, Posi-
tive Medium and Positive Big, respectively. Output is the negative value of the slope of the 
sliding surface, and the membership function of the output precision is shown in Figure 3c. 
Take the value of slope of the traditional sliding surface as VVS, VS, S, M, B, VB and VVB 
from left to right, representing Very Very Small, Very Small, Small, Medium, Big, Very Big 
and Very Very Big. To ensure the stability of the control system, the negative value of the 
slope of the sliding surface must be a positive number.
The fuzzy rule settings are given in Table 1.
The fuzzy rule in Table 1 is based on the sliding-mode function s
e
e
i
ic

0 , the input 
error and the derivative of the error. The slope of the sliding-mode surface, which is closest to the 
system state in real time, ensures that the system can reach the sliding surface faster. To explain 
the fuzzy rules, three typical rules (of the red-marked values in Table 1) are expressed as follows:

In rule 1, when the error is negative and the derivative of the error is approximately zero, the 
negative value of the slope of the sliding surface is chosen to be a very small value to bring the 
sliding surface closer to the system. In rule 2, when the error is negative and the derivative of 
Figure 2. Structure diagram of the fuzzy sliding-mode controller.
Figure 3. Membership function: (a) error; (b) derivative of error; (c) sliding-surface slope.

the error is positive, the negative value of the slope of the sliding surface is close to one, so that 
the sliding surface is close to the system. In rule 3, when the error is approximately zero and 
the derivative of the error is positive, the slope of the sliding surface is negative. Take a very 
large value to bring the sliding surface closer to the system. For the other rules, the appropriate 
slope of the sliding surface can also be selected to make the sliding surface follow the system.
5.2 Control-gain fuzzy controller design
This section introduces the design of the fuzzy sliding-mode controller with control-gain 
adaptation. The structure is the same as that shown in Figure 2. The input of the fuzzy 
controller mainly takes the system state error and the derivative of the error, and the time-
varying control gain is the output through fuzzy logic reasoning.
The fuzzy input functions of membership are also shown in Figure 3a and 3b. The output 
membership function is shown in Figure 3c, where M is defined as a trigonometric function 
centered on the traditional control gain.

The fuzzy controller increases the control gain when the error is large, so that the system 
can reach the sliding surface faster. When the error is very small, the adjustment gain is espe-
cially small to avoid overshoot. In this way, fuzzy inference rules are established. The fuzzy 
rule settings are shown in Table 2.
When the system error is largely positive and the error derivative is approximately zero, the 
control gain takes a large value to accelerate the system state to the sliding surface. When the 
error is approximately zero and the error derivative is largely positive, the control gain should 
be taken to a very small value to avoid overshoot.
5.3 Design of a double fuzzy sliding-mode variable structure controller
Combining the two fuzzy controllers introduced in Sections 5.1 and 5.2, a dual fuzzy sliding-
mode controller is proposed. The controller structure is shown in Figure 4. The fuzzy con-
troller adjusts the sliding-mode surface slope and control gain in real time based on the sys-
tem state error and its derivative.
6 SIMULATION
The following three kinds of fuzzy controllers are combined with the sliding-mode controller 
to carry out comparative simulation to verify the control effect of the designed controller. 
The initial conditions are selected as follows:

The simulation results are shown in Figure 5.
Using a comparison analysis of the results in Figure 5a, 5b, 5c and 5d, it can be seen in the 
carrier response curves of the three fuzzy sliding-mode controllers—the overshoot, conver-
gence speed and steady state error—that the control effect of the double fuzzy sliding-mode 
controller represented by the blue curve is obviously better than the adaptive slope fuzzy

sliding-mode controller represented by the red curve, and the adaptive control-gain fuzzy 
sliding-mode controller represented by the black curve. In Figure 5e and 5f, it can be seen 
that the control signal of the double fuzzy sliding-mode controller represented by the blue 
curve is smoother.
In summary, the double fuzzy sliding-mode controller can better solve the shortcomings 
of the sliding-mode controller with large chatter. In addition, it has the advantages of faster 
convergence speed and better convergence effect. The comparison shows that the designed 
controller has better dynamic response characteristics and achieves the expected control 
effect.
7 CONCLUSION
In this paper, a fuzzy controller with sliding-mode slope adaptive characteristics and a fuzzy 
controller with control-gain adaptability are designed to overcome the inherent shortcomings 
of the sliding-mode controller and improve its control effect. The designed sliding-surface 
slope adaptive fuzzy controller not only ensures the global robustness of the system but also 
has the advantage of being insensitive to unknown uncertainty. The designed control-gain 
adaptive fuzzy controller can eliminate the chatter of the control signal and accelerate the 
stability of the system. Combining the advantages of these two fuzzy controllers, a dual fuzzy 
sliding-mode controller is designed. Finally, a simulation analysis shows that the resulting 
double fuzzy sliding-mode controller has a better control effect on the cargo-stuck fault of 
an airdrop. In addition, it has good tracking performance for system speed and attitude angle 
and can eliminate the shortcomings inherent in the sliding-mode controller.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, the guarantee cost control problem is studied for a class of 
discrete-time switched system with state delays and parameters uncertainties. Different from 
the existing methods of analysis of switching systems, we construct a new type of switching 
system model by using sojourn probability information. Considering the uncertainties of 
the system parameters, sufficient conditions of both quadratic stability and the existence of 
guaranteed cost control law of the system are derived in terms of the linear matrix inequality 
method. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed 
method.
Keywords: Discrete switched systems, Sojourn probability, Guarantee cost control
1 INTRODUCTION
For a practice system, stability is a basic requirement to ensure the system running. It can-
not reflect the essential characteristics of the system, thus other cost indicators need to be 
considered too. Generally, the control system is required to reach closed-loop asymptotic 
stability and achieve a certain performance level. One way to deal with this requirement is to 
establish an integral quadratic cost function, which means the guarantee cost control (Chang 
SS L. 1972). In the actual system, the cost function constrains the control variables. And this 
requires the input variables not to exceed a certain value; otherwise it will waste energy and 
make it difficult to control. The guaranteed cost control can handle this class of problem, 
making the control system design consistent with current production process. Thus, it is nec-
essary to study the guaranteed cost control of the systems.
A lot of achievements have been obtained in the study of the guaranteed cost control. 
The guaranteed cost control of a class of pulse switching systems with normal boundary 
uncertainty was considered (Xu H. 2008). It dealt with the reliable guaranteed cost control 
of delta operator-converted linear switching systems, which employed the moving average 
time method (Hu H. 2016). While the switching rules which have a significant impact on 
system performance levels are still commonly used, such as dwell time switching, Markov 
process switching, etc. For example, the researchers studied the problem of nonfragile guar-
anteed cost control for discrete time Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy Markovian jump system (Wu Z.G. 
2017). The problem of robust nonfragile guaranteed cost control was proposed for a class 
of uncertain Markovian jump systems with time-varying delays (Liu G. 2017). But in some 
specific systems, the probability of process transitions in Markovian jump systems is very dif-
ficult or impossible to measure (H. Chen 2015). However, some researchers only studied the 
guarantee cost control system regardless of switched system (Chang SS L. 1972, Yu L. YL 
1997). Some researchers studied the guarantee cost control of switched system but ignored 
the parameters uncertainties (Xu H. 2008, Hu H. 2016, and Wu Z.G. 2017). The guarantee 
cost control based on sojourn probability of uncertain discrete switched system has not been 
studied. This motivates the current study.

66
This paper studies the guaranteed cost control problem for a class of discrete switched sys-
tems with uncertainty parameter and state delay. Different from most existing methods, a new 
type of switching system model is constructed. Then a corresponding cost function is defined 
by using the sojourn probability information. Considering the system parameters uncertain-
ties, sufficient conditions for the system to achieve quadratic stability and the existence of the 
guaranteed cost control law are given by using the linear matrix inequality method. Finally, a 
numerical example is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

the Theorem 3.1, we consider the parameters uncertainties in the constructed switching sys-
tem model in this part.

And the proof process refers to references (Yuan Yue-hua 2014).
Remark 3.1: For the existence of the inverse of the variable in the inequality, equations (8) 
and (10) are not strictly linear matrix inequalities. Therefore, we will use a cone complementa-
rity linearization method in Laurent EI (Chaoui L.E. 1997) to find the gain Ki of the system.
The following algorithm can be derived by using the cone complementarity linearization 
method.

From Figure 1 and Figure 2, one can see clearly is that the switching system with parameters 
uncertainties can achieve almost the same stability with the system regardless of that. That is, 
the method used in this paper is effective. The designed guaranteed cost control law can ensure 
the favorable control performance of the whole system in the case of subsystem delay.
5 CONCLUSION
This paper focuses on a class of discrete time-delay switching systems with parameters uncer-
tainties, and studies the problem of guaranteed cost control. By using the sojourn probability 
information method, we have constructed a new switching system model, and defined the 
corresponding cost function. By using the linear matrix inequality method, we can obtain 
the sufficient conditions for the system quadratic stability and the existence of the guaran-
teed cost control law when considering the system parameters uncertainties. The simulation 
results have been used to verify that the method can meet the expected performance of the 
system. For future work, we will build upon the presented results to adaptive event-trigger 
control system.

ABSTRACT: This paper presents an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system that 
can be efficiently used for personalized lighting control. Using a Deep Neural Network-
Hidden Markov Model (DNN-HMM) algorithm, the system implements the dimming, 
color temperature and color adjustment of Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs) according to 
31 sets of human command words. Tests were conducted at distances of 20 cm, 50 cm 
and 100  cm in quiet and noisy environments. Results show that the mean accuracy of 
speech recognition is 94% and the response time is 0.7 s, which indicates good potential for 
commercialization.
Keywords: Automatic speech recognition, DNN-HMM, LED, lighting control
1 INTRODUCTION
Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs) have been widely used for general illumination purposes such 
as home lighting, office lighting, traffic lighting, and so on (Schubert, 2006; Krames et al., 
2007; Chen et al., 2012; Pimputkar, 2009). Controlling lights typically requires human inter-
faces that incorporate the use of standard devices such as hand- or finger-actuated switches 
or knobs and touch plates. For colored lights, additional dimensions of control complicate 
this. With the popularization of smart illumination (Schubert & Kim, 2005), Automatic 
Speech Recognition (ASR) can be a replacement for traditional control (Wang et al., 2016; 
Lei et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2011; Rabiner & Juang, 1993; Yu & Li, 2016). This paper deals 
with a new type of intelligent speech recognition system for modification of LED switch-
ing and control of hue, dimming and color temperature. It is based on an embedded offline 
recognition engine and uses a Deep Neural Network-Hidden Markov Model (DNN-HMM) 
algorithm for deep learning. The ASR system shows nearly real-time response and stable 
localized voice recognition.
2 EXPERIMENT
As shown in Figure  1, the ASR system for lighting control includes an ASR mod-
ule, an LED driver module, LED lamps and a power supply module. When a user gives 
particular command words, the ASR module responds immediately, delivering the 
processing signal to the LED drive module to control the switch, color, dimming and color 
temperature.

74
2.1 Principle of the ASR system
As shown in Figure 2, the ASR module includes a microphone array, a front-end processing 
module, a back-end processing module and a loudspeaker. The front-end processing module 
and the back-end processing module are the core of the speech recognition system. A Chip-
intelli speech recognition chip is integrated inside. The noise-reduction module receives the 
phase difference from the microphone array, and then filters the sound signals to minimize 
background noise. The noise-reduced signal is used for speech endpoint detection in the ASR 
module. Feature extraction is conducted through the DNN-HMM model. The extracted fea-
tures are matched with the speech database after decoding. Finally, the output is converted 
to analog signals through the power amplifier circuit and the speaker.
Feature extraction is a key part of the speech recognition system. The feature is displayed in 
the envelope of the short-term power spectrum of the speech. Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coeffi-
cients (MFCCs) are based on the human auditory model. The frequency axis is converted from 
linear scale to mel frequency in the frequency domain, and is then switched to the cepstrum 
domain to obtain cepstral coefficients, which will accurately describe the characteristics of this 
envelope. The specific relationship between the mel frequency and the actual frequency is:

Pattern matching is the core of the speech recognition system. The feature vector of the 
input speech is compared with the template library. The highest similarity is output as the 
recognition result. DNN models the posterior probability of the input signal. Then, it com-
bines the posterior probability with the prior probability to obtain the observed probability 
of the state. The input sample is x and the output state is s; P(s|x) represents the output of 
the DNN posterior probability, namely:

where P(s) is the prior probability of the modeling unit, and P(x) is the prior probability 
of the observed sample. The observation probability can be decoded in combination with 
HMM and language models.
2.2 LED driver module
As shown in Figure 3, the LED drive module takes the Microcontroller Unit (MCU) as the 
core. When it receives command signals from the ASR module, the MCU will control the 
LED lamps according to the set program. It then uses the Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) 
method to mix colors to realize the desired brightness, color temperature, and color. In addi-
tion, the LED driver circuit provides a suitable current for the LED array.
2.2.1 Principle of color temperature, dimming and color adjustment
Due to the visual persistence of the human eye, when the LED blinking frequency is higher 
than 85 Hz, it will be considered to be constantly bright. Thus, by turning LEDs on and off, we 
can change the duty cycle to adjust the brightness. The output voltage changes accordingly:

where UO_AVG is the average output voltage, D is the duty cycle, UP is the voltage amplitude of 
PWM voltage, ton is the on-time, and toff is the off-time. Based on Equations 3 and 4, it can 
be concluded that if on-time is increased, the duty ratio will be increased accordingly. When 
the amplitude of the voltage stays unchanged, the output voltage will increase and the lamp 
will become brighter.
The system uses common cathode RGB (Red/Green/Blue) LED lamps. The illuminating 
color can be converted into chromaticity coordinates or tristimulus values, corresponding to 
the standard chromaticity diagram of the CIE (International Commission on Illumination). 
The PWM method is used to adjust the duty ratio of RGB, so that different colors are mixed. 
Similarly, the color temperature can be adjusted according to the ratio of the warm and cold 
LED lamps. The warm-color temperature LED lamp used is 4000 K, and the cool-color 
temperature is 6500 K.
2.2.2 Principle of the LED drive circuit
Figure 4 shows a schematic diagram of part of the drive circuit. The PWM control sig-
nal is output by the MCU. The load terminal is connected by five LEDs; the middle part 
is the LED driver circuit. Among them, Q1 is a switch tube, used to protect the MCU. 
Figure 3. Principle of the LED driver module.

76
A common-emitter amplifier circuit with Q2 is used to amplify the current, achieving the 
working current of the LED.
3 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
3.1 Adjustment of lighting brightness, color temperature and color
The system realizes the communication between the ASR module and the MCU. The LEDs 
are controlled by command signals from the MCU, there by realizing the control of dimming, 
color temperature and color of illumination.
As shown in Figure 5, a–f are the six dimming levels captured in a dark environment, 
which darken from left to right. When the speech recognition module received a voice com-
mand such as ‘Brighter’, ‘Darker’, ‘Minimum brightness’ or ‘Maximum brightness’, the 
PWM circuit was adjusted to change the brightness of the LED lamps.
As shown in Figure 6, a–f are the six color temperature levels captured in a dark environ-
ment, which warm from left to right. When the speech recognition module received com-
mand terms such as ‘Natural white’ or ‘Warm white’, the duty cycle of the warm and cold 
LED lamps was adjusted to reach the corresponding color temperature level.
Figure 7 shows pictures of the 16 colors from the system in a dark environment. When the 
ASR module recognized a corresponding color command, such as ‘Correctred’ or ‘Light-
green’, the system adjusted the RGB LED duty cycles to mix the color, thus obtaining 16

3.2 The response and speech recognition rate test
Ten participants were invited into the experiment. There were 31 sets of command words, 
and each was spoken three times at a distance of 20 cm, 50 cm, and 100 cm. The experimental 
environment was not absolutely quiet and simulated everyday use.
Response time is the main factor affecting the speech recognition system experience. The 
response time was measured from the end of the human speech to the beginning of the loud-
speaker response. Currently, the response time of network speech recognition in the industry 
is about 1.5 s. In this test, the response time was 0.6 seconds, and 0.7 seconds in the noisy 
environment. The result shows that the local scheme used in our system involves less delay 
than network speech recognition.
The statistical results of the recognition rate test are shown in Table 1. The 31 sets of com-
mand words were divided into four types: wake-up, dimming, color temperature and color. 
The mean accuracy of speech recognition was 94%. The first three types of recognition rate 
test results were higher than this, but the color recognition was relatively poor.

It was found that at a distance of 20 cm, the recognition rate of partially adjusted colors 
was less than 80%, and the recognition rates of ‘Light blue’ and ‘Correct yellow’ were 78%. 
This is because the Chinese sounds of ‘light’ and ‘green’, ‘yellow’ and ‘red’ are similar to a 
certain extent, and the system was prone to errors when they were spoken.
At a distance of 50 cm, the recognition rates of ‘Correct red’, ‘Correct green’, ‘Light blue’, 
‘Correct yellow’ and ‘Correct Purple’ were below 80%. As the distance increased, the noise 
effect was more obvious and recognition errors increased. In the case of a distance of 100 cm, 
the recognition rate dropped slightly more: the recognition rate was below 80% for command 
words such as ‘Maximum brightness’ in dimming, and most (‘Correct red’, ‘Light green’, 
‘Light blue’, ‘Correct orange’, ‘Light green’, ‘Light blue’, ‘Correct yellow’, ‘Yellow green’, 
‘Correct cyan’, ‘Correct purple’ and ‘Fruit purple’) of the color adjustment type.
When analyzing recognition errors, we found that they were concentrated among words 
such as ‘correct’, ‘light’, ‘green’, ‘yellow’ and ‘red’. The distance factor was a possible cause 
for the decrease in the recognition rate. With an increase of working distance, background

noise plays a more important part in all the signals acquired by the microphone array and the 
recognition rate deteriorates. Further, because most of the testers had a Cantonese accent in 
their spoken Mandarin, this may be another reason for the error in the recognition of these 
pronunciations.
These minimization of these noise and dialect effects will be optimized in our sub sequent 
research. We will add dialect recognition to improve the recognition rate, which will also be 
improved by incorporating more samples into our speech library.
4 CONCLUSION
This paper presented an intelligent speech recognition system for LED lighting control. It 
realized human–machine voice interaction, thus controlling the switching, dimming, color 
temperature and color of LED lamps. It has great significance in solving the intelligent 
illumination control problem and promotes the commercialization of intelligent lighting 
based on voice control.

Rotary inverted pendulum system tracking and stability control 
based on input-output feedback linearization and PSO-optimized 
fractional order PID controller
Y. Yang, H.H. Zhang & R.M. Voyles

ABSTRACT: This paper is aimed to propose a controller which can achieve the tracking 
control of the rotary arm and the stability control of the inverted pendulum in the Rotary 
Inverted Pendulum (RIP) system. An Input-Output Feedback Linearized (IOFL) RIP 
system dynamics can be divided into two separate portions: one is the linearized dynamic 
portion associated with the pendulum arm, and the other is the un-linearizable portion asso-
ciated with the rotary arm. For the unlinearizable portion, a fractional order PIλDμ (FOPID) 
controller is implemented to enhance the tracking control of the rotary arm with control-
ler parameters determined from solving a prescribed optimization problem using Particle 
Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. For the linearized portion, the state feedback con-
trol gains are obtained by conventional pole-placement method. It is revealed that a much 
more robust and effective tracking and stabilizing performance can be guaranteed with the 
FOPID involved in the controller design when compared with a previously designed synthe-
sized IOFL controller for the RIP system. The new FOPID controller developed in this paper 
for the RIP system can be used as a reference to the tracking and stabilizing control of other 
complicated dynamic systems since the RIP system is a testbed for controller design of the 
fourth order Single-Input-Multiple-Output (SIMO) dynamic system.
1 INTRODUCTION
Rotary inverted pendulum (RIP) is an electro-mechanical system which is composed of two 
linked arms placed on a rigid stand. RIP system has two degree of freedoms and it has 
unique value to serve as a test platform for evaluating nonlinear controllers.
Recent researchers have focused their attention to the modeling of dynamic system using 
fractional order calculus, mainly in the cases of the system transients, such as switching on/
off, as well as the other essential features that conventional methods and transforms fail to 
capture. For example, a comparison study of integer and fractional order ultra-capacitor 
models in Dzieliński et al. (2011) showed that the fractional order description of the ultra-
capacitor dynamics validates a good match with the experimental data points. In the same 
way, a fractional calculus model was presented for the complex dynamics in biological tissues, 
and demonstrated its high precision and conciseness of fractional order model in bioengi-
neering research areas (Magin 2010). Meanwhile, Benson et al. (2013) applied fractional cal-
culus in hydrologic modeling and its simulation, whose results implied the natural existence 
of fractional order dynamic systems. Similarly, the fractional order models of basic mechani-
cal and electrical elements, such as the spring, damper, capacitor, resistor and inductor, are 
developed by utilizing fractional order calculus theories (Magin 2006). The fractional order 
model can provide much comprehensive information of the original system since it takes 
account of the transitional or interim states between two integer order states. However, due 
to the ambiguity and the deficient understanding of the physical meanings behind the frac-
tional order differentiation and integration, it is challenging to formulate fractional order 
mathematical principles towards the natural phenomena explicitly. Instead of proposing a 

80
list of assumptions to force the system dynamics to be fractional, and designing a fractional 
order controller based on the fractional order system, a novel approach is to directly apply a 
fractional order controller to an integer order system dynamics. The fractional order control-
ler involves more parameters to be adjusted, for example, for the PIλDμ controller, not only 
the proportional gain, derivative gain and integral gain need to be tuned, the fractional order 
index λ and μ also require to be properly set. The flexibility of adjusting more parameters of 
the fractional order controller implies more chance of making the overall system to deliver a 
better performance.
Over the past decades, several common dynamic systems which are hard to be expressed in 
the form of fractional order differential equations are explored by researchers. Podlubny (1998) 
studied the step response of the PIλDμ (FOPID) controller in a LTI system plant, the results 
give the evidence that FOPID has higher robustness than the traditional PID controller. Corre-
spondingly, the cases when the FOPID controller is applied to nonlinear integer order systems 
are also investigated. For instance, the fractional order parameters λ and μ are adjusted by trial 
and error to control a single-link RIP system (Liao et al. 2015). Wan et al. (2015) proposed 
the adjustable fractional order adaptive control (AFrAC) with which the fractional order β 
can be dynamically determined through optimization. Dwivedi et al. (2017) incorporated the 
frequency domain analysis to fractional order controller design processes. All these methods 
prevail only in some specific dynamic systems, but unfortunately, these fractional controller 
design methods lose their effectiveness when they are applied to the RIP system.
Previously, a synthesized input-output feedback linearization (IOFL) controller is pre-
sented to achieve the stabilization of the RIP system, but its tracking control performance 
is not investigated (Yang & Zhang 2018). As a continuous work, this paper will focus on 
RIP system tracking and stability control. For the nonlinear IOFL transformed subsystem, 
a PIλDμ is presented to ensure the tracking performance of the rotary arm. The fractional 
order parameters of the PIλDμ are optimized with the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) 
algorithm (Chong & Zak 2012). Meanwhile, The Ourstaloup filter is introduced to approxi-
mate the FOPID operator.
2 MODELING OF THE ROTARY INVERTED PENDULUM SYSTEM
2.1 Dynamics and the affine form of the rotary inverted pendulum system
The rotary inverted pendulum (RIP) system is a single-input-multi-output (SIMO) dynamic 
system. The structure of the RIP system is quite simple: a servomotor is mounted on a stand 
stage, the rotary arm is positioned horizontally with one end attached on the motor and 
the other end of the rotary arm is hinged with the end of the pendulum arm. The motor 
will drive the rotary arm to circularly move and the rotational movement of the rotary arm 
will force the swaying of the pendulum arm. The structure of the RIP system is simple with 
physical model and the coordinate system shown in Figure 1. The detailed description of the 
coordinate system has been given in Yang & Zhang (2018).

With the help of Lagrange dynamics, the nonlinear system dynamics is given in Equations 
(1) and (2), where the coefficients are summarized in Yang & Zhang (2018).

sion of Oustaloup filter (Xue 2017) is employed in this paper to estimate the effects of the 
fractional order operators as shown in Equation (6).

where overshoot Mp, steady state error Ess, settling time ts, rising time tr are related to the 
pendulum arm angle (θ) response, the state error e1(t) is associated to the rotary arm angle 
(α) response. w1, w2, w3, w4 and w5 are weighted factors selected by trial and error to bal-
ance the objective terms. In this paper, the weighted factors are chosen as follows: w1 = 10, 
w2 = 1, w2 = 0.5, w4 = 1000, w5 = 200. Therefore, the optimization problem is established with 
K = (Kp Ki Kd λ μ) forming the parameter space. To ensure the high efficiency of searching 
process in solving this minimization problem, a roughly approximated ranges of values for 
optimal parameters are empirically specified, i.e., K p
K ∈[

PSO is a soft computing algorithm which is based on randomized evolutionary population

4 SIMULATION RESULTS
To test the performance of the optimized PIλDμ controller, a simulation experiment is con-
ducted with Simulink. The simulation of the RIP system involves two parts: one is the system 
dynamics module to emulate the nonlinear dynamics of the RIP system after IOFL trans-
formation, the other one is the fractional order PID controller module consisting of a PIλDμ 
controller with its parameters adjusted by solving an optimization problem using PSO algo-
rithm. In this Simulink model, the feedback sensor block and the actuator block are neglected 
given that the sensor and actuators exhibit much higher frequency bandwidth than other 
components of the system. To get the optimal parameters of the FOPID controller block, 
the overall Simulink block is coupled with an optimization loop program. A step input signal 
(amplitude = 1, step time = 0) and a sinusoidal signal (amplitude = 1, frequency = 1.5 π rad/s, 
phase = 0 rad) are considered as the input signals to test the rotary arm’s tracking performance.
The system responses are divided into four parts: θ response and θ  response corresponding 
to the rotary arm, α response and α  response corresponding to the pendulum arm. In this 
paper, the simulation results with original synthesized IOFL controller constructed in Yang & 
Zhang (2018) are employed to compare with the simulation results of the optimized PIλDμ

equipped with the original synthesized IOFL controller as shown in Figure 3(b).
5 CONCLUSION
Beyond the random disturbances on the rotary arm, with unit step as well as sinusoidal 
signal imposed to the rotary arm, the simultaneous control of the tracking and stabilization 
of the RIP system is achieved. The RIP system dynamics is first treated with input-output 
feedback linearization, because one portion of the transformed system dynamics can be seen 
as a second-order linear time invariant system characterizing α responses (the pendulum 
arm). Since the other portion is a second-order nonlinear dynamics representing θ responses 
(the rotary arm), the transformed RIP dynamics is equipped with a fractional order PID 
controller, out of which the five parameters are optimally determined with PSO algorithm. 
Compared with the system performance resulted from the original synthesized IOFL con-
troller, it is displayed that not only the global asymptotical stability is guaranteed by the new 
optimized PIλDμ controller, but also the tracking control of the rotary arm is engaged. As 
a trade-off, the new approach needs to identify the optimal values of five parameters in the 
PIλDμ controller by utilizing PSO algorithm to minimize the specified loss function, while for 
the original synthesized IOFL controller, only two parameters’ optimal values need to be esti-
mated using genetic algorithm. The controller developed in this paper can be generalized to 
applications that require the system dynamics to be stabilized and the indicated components 
of the system need to have capability to track a specified input signals.

ABSTRACT: The Human-Computer Interface (HCI) of a Distributed Control System 
(DCS) is the most important interaction medium between human and industrial systems. The 
cognitive performance of DCS HCI can directly affect the operational safety and efficiency 
of industrial systems. The cognitive behavior of DCS HCI is studied to clarify the interaction 
process and influencing factors during DCS operation and monitoring tasks. The test indexes 
and methods based on eye movement data and subjective fatigue data are proposed. The 
DCS HCI cognitive performance test procedure is designed by combining eye tracking tests 
and subjective fatigue tests. The DCS HCI cognitive performance of a black background 
and a gray background is tested and compared. The results show that the gray background 
DCS HCI has an advantage in cognitive performance, and the black background DCS HCI 
brings higher cognitive fatigue and lower efficiency. This method is significant in reducing the 
cognitive load and improving the interaction efficiency for DCS HCI.
Keywords: distributed control system, human-computer interface, cognitive performance, 
eye movement data
1 INTRODUCTION
A Distributed Control System (DCS) is a distributed computer control system based on 
a microprocessor. The remarkable characteristics of a DCS are centralized operation and 
monitoring of industrial processes, while control tasks are completed by different computer 
control devices. The DCS is currently the most widely used in the industrial control field, 
and has been widely used in aviation, transportation, the chemical industry, manufacturing, 
energy, nuclear power and other industrial control fields.
Usually, a DCS concentrates information and human-computer interaction equipment in 
a centralized control room for information display and operation. In the current advanced 
DCS, the human-computer interface (HCI) based on computer technology, has gradually 
become the core interaction medium between the operators and the industrial system for 
information display, control input, management and so on.
The operators’ monitoring and operation is based on the video display units, interactive 
graphical HCI, special keyboard, mouse or track ball. The form of the DCS HCI elements 
include general appearance, groups, points, trends, warnings, operation guidance and flow-
charts, to make the monitoring and operation centralized and convenient. DCS HCI task 
failure may lead to industrial system operation safety problems. DCS HCI is responsible for 
the normal, abnormal and post-accident display and control of industrial systems. At the 
same time, huge potential risks concentrated on a few operators for the centralized moni-
toring and operation, and it plays a direct and vital role in the efficiency and safety of the 
industrial control system (Guofang et al., 2016). For example, the Three Mile Island and the 
Chernobyl nuclear power plant accidents are closely related to the human-machine interac-
tion system. Therefore, it is necessary to research the cognitive performance of DCS HCI in 

86
industrial systems, so as to ensure that the cognitive performance of DCS HCI matches well 
with the demand of manipulation and the ability of operators.
The research of HCI cognitive performance has been paid more and more attention to 
improve operational performance and reduce cognitive pressure (Wu et al., 2017). Tradi-
tional HCI cognitive performance research methods include user interviews, experimental 
observation, questionnaire surveys and so on. For example, Park and Yung (2006) and Jou et 
al., (2009) used the Task Load Index (TLX) scale to study the emergency tasks of industrial 
systems, the cognitive performance and load of specific tasks in the main control room. Jing 
et al., (2018) studied the influence of HCI shape coding on information search and target 
cognition performance. Its limitations lie in relying on subjective feeling and experience to 
evaluate the cognitive performance. The result is a subjective feeling value, and it is difficult 
to accurately describe the state of cognitive performance. The test results are subjective and 
lack the defects of users’ objective data support.
In recent years, human physiological data has been used in HCI cognitive research. For 
example, lo Storto (2013) used eye movement data in website interface cognitive performance 
and cognitive pressure research. Ha et al., (2006) used eye movement data to study the cogni-
tive load of accident diagnosis tasks in industrial systems. Ha et al., (2016) used eye tracking 
data for operator thinking in a nuclear power plant. Eye movement data was used to measure 
visual attention and interest points (Balcombea et al., 2017). Based on the direct correlation 
between physiological data and HCI monitoring and the operation task process, the test data 
is objective and real-time, which belongs to the accurate cognitive research method. HCI 
researches based on physiological parameters have become a trend.
This paper mainly studies the DCS HCI cognitive behavior model and the cognitive per-
formance test method. The effective DCS HCI cognitive performance test method is proposed.
2 DCS HCI COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR MODEL
The DCS HCI of industrial systems provides information display in the way of simulating flow 
chart, bar chart, numerical meter, trend curve, table, button, dialog box and so on. It can com-
plete dynamic data display, operation and alarm and so on. The information display of DCS 
HCI is closely connected with the principle of the industrial process system. The dynamic and 
static information of DCS HCI should be monitored and the coupling relationship is complex.
The operator’s cognition process for the DCS HCI includes the perception, memory, 
thinking processing, selection, decision making and other activities of HCI information. 
DCS HCI information interaction involves information stimulation, information transmis-
sion feedback, and output and result correlation (Jingling, 2014). The cognitive behavior 
model of DCS HCI is as show in Figure 1.
a. First, the DCS HCI stimulus information is presented in the visual vision and audition 
mode, such as device icons, process simulation diagrams and other changes, such as flick-
ering output. The operators register the sensation of HCI stimulation through the vision 
and audio perception organs and store the input stimulus information.
Figure 1. Cognitive behavior model of DCS HCI.

87
b. Operators’ perception is the processing of sensory information formed by stimulation of 
DCS HCI, so as to form a complete information reflection.
c. After the sensory and perceptual integration of stimulus information, the operators began 
to think and make decisions based on the information. This stage involves the working 
memory and long term memory of the operators.
d. The operators are able to respond to the stimulus by choosing the form of response choice. 
In some cases, the operators will choose not to respond to the HCI stimulus, but the infor-
mation is stored in their long-term memory, and then their short-term memory is retrieved 
from the long-term memory to enter the execution of the short-term memory.
e. After the process of information output has been processed, the operators decide the 
operation reaction activity on DCS HCI stimulation.
The information process requirements of DCS HCI are severe and require more cognitive 
resources. Operators’ cognitive resources are limited. The DCS HCI exceeds the limits of 
their cognitive resources and will inevitably lead to low monitoring efficiency, high psycho-
logical pressure and mis-operation rate (Li et al., 2016).
3 DCS HCI COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE TEST INDEXES
The DCS HCI cognitive performance test is based on the combination of eye movement meas-
urement and subjective evaluation. The subjective scale and objective physiological data of the 
target object in the interaction process on DCS HCI experience are obtained through the study 
of the operator’s eye movement and subjective evaluation in the simulation task experiment.
a. The eye movement data refers to duration data and count data of eye movements. Test 
indexes: ϕ. The fixation count: the count of eye fixation points to be paid attention to on 
DCS HCI during the task process. κ. Duration data includes first fixation duration, total 
fixation duration and total visit duration of Regions of Interest (ROI). Here, fixation 
duration refers to the time used for eye movement to stay at a specific ROI and to search 
for the fixations. λ. ROI visit count represents the number of eye visits to a region. The 
value is less than or equal to the number of fixation counts. And the value is more than 1, 
representing the seeing back behavior of operators.
b. Fatigue evaluation scale: psychological evaluation can be measured, analyzed and evaluated by 
scientific, objective and standard measurement methods. It is the most simple, portable and 
subjective evaluation method. The fatigue evaluation scale is designed by the equidistant table 
to evaluate the psychological pressure, fatigue, eye swelling and comfort of the operators.
4 DCS HCI COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE TEST EXPERIMENT
4.1 Test experiment method
In the test experiment, the tester simulates the task process of DCS HCI. Condensate water 
HCI of a thermal energy industry is selected as the test object. The screen size displaying the 
condensate water HCI is 22 inches and the resolution is 1280*800. The DCS HCI task proc-
ess is performed by simulation testers, at the same time, eye movement data and subjective 
fatigue tests are measured in real time.
Objective: In the field of DCS, the most commonly used HCI background colors include 
black and gray. The cognitive performance of a black background (RGB:0,0,0) and a gray 
background (RGB:222,222,222) DCS HCI are tested and compared.
Test equipment: eye movement test equipment is the Tobii Pro X3–120 portable screen eye 
tracker, the eye movement data acquisition software is Tobii Studio.
Fatigue tests used the fatigue evaluation scale.
The experimental task flow is as follows:
a. The testers rest for 2 minutes before the start of the experiment to prepare for the best 
working condition.

88
b. Eye movement calibration at the end of 2 minutes.
c. Start the task of simulating the condensate water HCI. The time is 15 minutes. During this 
duration, the tester’s eye movement data is recorded in real time.
d. After the implementation of the task, fatigue is evaluated. The subjective psychological 
evaluation index from low to high with 0∼10 as the score and orally reporting fatigue.
e. Complete the data record and analyze it.
4.2 Test experiment method case
The test scene is shown in Figure 2. The visualized fixation and ROI statistics and analysis 
chart of the DCS HCI for a black background and a gray background of the thermal power 
industry system as shown in Figure 3.
The fixation statistics chart shows the tester’s sight position, sequence and observation 
time in a specific region on the DCS HCI. Therefore, the main characteristics of fixation 
trajectories are to reveal the fixation time sequence or location and observation time. The 
numbers in the circle represent the order of the tester to observe the interface, and the time 
of observation is usually expressed as the duration of the fixation point, which is represented 
by the dots of different diameters on the fixation path chart. The longer the observation time 
is, the greater the diameter of the dots.
On the DCS HCI, the region that needs the tester to focus attention is divided into ROIs 
to test whether the tester’s performance meets the design intention and goal. This experiment 
divides 14 ROIs into the DCS HCI. (1) time to first fixation of ROI: the shorter the time of 
an ROI is found, the sooner the representative is searched, or more easy it is to search; (2) 
fixation count before first fixation of ROI is similar to the first fixation time, describing the 
count of fixations before the discovery of a specific region, and the smaller the number, the 
faster the target is searched. A comparison chart of time to first fixation of, and fixation

and gray background).

count before fixation duration of ROI on DCS HCI between the black background and the 
gray background is shown in Figure 4 and Table 1.
According to the chart of time to first fixation of ROI on a DCS HCI with a black back-
ground, the tester’s visual search order is from the ROI 1 to the ROI 14 smooth, basically 
conforming to the visual observation logic order in the HCI design. The fixation sequence of 
DCS HCI of the gray background is approximately the same as the black background, but 
there is a difference: the first fixation of ROI 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14 of the gray background is 
more rapid and direct, as shown in Table 1. And the time to first fixation of is shorter, and the 
fixation count before first fixation of ROI is less. For ROI 3, 8, 9, 12 and 13, the time to first 
fixation of is shorter and the fixation count before first fixation of ROI is less for the black 
background HCI, but for the ROI 2 and 11, although the time to first fixation of is shorter in 
the black background HCI, but the fixation count before first fixation of ROI is less.
The first fixation duration represents the first time the tester’s attention time to a specific 
region on DCS HCI is long, the first observation time of the HCI is long, indicating that the 
correlation of the elements of HCI is strong, as shown in Figure 5.
According to the first fixation duration, there is a great difference between the black back-
ground and the gray background. The length distribution of each ROI in the black back-
ground is shorter than the gray background, which indicates that the correlation between the 
elements in the gray background is stronger.
Total fixation duration represents the test user’ total attention time to a specific region on 
DCS HCI. The comparison chart of total fixation duration of ROI on DCS HCI between 
the black background and the gray background is shown in Figure 6.
According to the total fixation duration, the total fixation duration is longer on the gray 
background HCI, indicating that the continuous attention of the tester is more stable on the 
gray background HCI. For ROI 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, 11 and 12, the tester’s attention is significantly 
higher than the remaining ROI.
The visits count represents the count of visits to a specific region. The count is less than equal 
to the fixations count, and the count is more than 1 representing the occurrence of the return.

The more difficult it is to recognize and extract information of DCS HCI; the longer the fixation 
duration indicates that the tester needs to spend more time to extract the information. The fixa-
tions count usually indicates that the tester has more meaningless fixations and lower cognitive 
performance. As shown in Figure 7, according to the visits counts, the visits counts are more uni-
formly relative to the fixations count to each ROI. But still there is a higher degree of attention to 
ROI 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, 11, and 12. Compared with the black background, visits counts to each ROI of 
the gray background is more and more uniform, indicating that the gray background DCS HCI 
is more comfortable for the tester, allowing lower cognitive load and higher attention.
After the DCS HCI eye movement test, subjective fatigue evaluation was carried out. In 
this experiment, the tester is required to report the mental pressure, fatigue, eye swelling 
and comfort, in the form of an oral report after the execution of the simulation task, with 
the equal distance between 0–10. The lower the score, the lower the pressure, the easier on 
the eye it is, and the more comfortable the eyes are. On the other hand, the fatigue degree is 
higher. From Figure 8, it can be seen very intuitively that the black background will cause the 
maximum fatigue for the tester. For the gray background, the fixations assignment is more 
uniform and the fixations time is longer.

5 CONCLUSIONS
The cognitive performance of DCS HCI is researched. The HCI cognitive behavior model 
and its influencing factors are defined. A cognitive performance test method based on eye 
movement data and subjective fatigue evaluation is proposed for DCS HCI. Aiming at the 
comparison of the cognitive performance test between a black background and a gray back-
ground HCI, the test method and process is designed. HCI eye movement data and subjective 
fatigue evaluation data are collected. The test results show that a gray background HCI has 
obvious advantages in efficient cognition, low pressure load and attention concentration. 
The feasibility of this method for a DCS HCI cognitive performance test is verified. In the 
further research, eye movement and cerebral blood oxygen measurements will be used to 
verify the validity of synchronous measurement mode data in cognitive research.

ABSTRACT: Bypass operations were first proposed by the Japanese power sector in the 
1970s. Through half a century of engineering exploration and development, bypass opera-
tions have achieved relatively sound systems. The bypass operation takes three main forms: 
bypass cable, transformer vehicle, and generating car. The overhaul of distribution network 
transformers is the major objective of transformer vehicle work. At present, the study of 
transformer vehicles has been limited to improving the continuity of power supply. There are 
fewer analyses of user-side power quality during operations to ensure power supply reliabil-
ity. In order to provide users with higher-quality power, we use MATLAB software to simu-
late and analyze the change of power waveform in a distribution network during replacement 
operations involving a transformer vehicle. On the basis of a controlling variable method, we 
identify the variables that produce least impact on the power quality of the user side, thereby 
ensuring high quality and reliability of power supply.
1 INTRODUCTION
Electrical energy has become an indispensable component of production and people’s lives. 
Power quality is therefore an important factor affecting people’s quality of life. In order to 
improve the continuity of electrical energy, power supply companies carry out many innova-
tions. Bypass operations are the main way to improve the continuity of power quality (Shi & 
Chen, 2017; Hu et al., 2016). The working principle of a bypass operation is load transfer. 
Load transfer involves the transfer of the distribution transformer load to the transformer 
vehicle. The transformer vehicle acts like a bridge between the power network and the user. 
A bypass operation can reduce the impact on users of power outages caused by maintenance, 
thereby improving the quality of the power supply (Hong et al., 2016; Wei et al., 2012). At the 
same time, the transformer vehicle can also be used for temporary construction and power 
supply and can prevent inconvenience and safety hazards caused by long take-up lines during 
construction. The transformer vehicle has good worth: it can share load during peak periods 
of electricity consumption and guarantee power supply quality.
Research on transformer vehicles mainly started with field construction reports and, at 
present, is based on the experience of repeated operations in engineering practice through 
live working. Analysis and research into their influence on customer power quality is still 
insufficient. In order to provide users with more stable and high-quality electricity, this paper 
analyzes the problem of cutting off the impulse current at different time nodes, the integrity 
of the voltage waveform on the user side, and identifying the optimal access point (Xu et al., 
2016; Wang & Tang, 2003; He et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2013). In this paper, MATLAB simu-
lation software (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) is used to build a simple and func-
tional power grid model, and the influence of the transformer vehicle on different power grid 
stages is analyzed. The simulation starts from the regular maintenance of substations in the 

96
distribution network. It realizes the complete operational process for the transformer vehicle 
in the distribution network without interruption of operation. During the process, simu-
lation data for the user-side voltage waveform and the current change in the transformer 
vehicle substation are obtained. The influence of load transfer on users and the distribution 
network itself is analyzed.
2 MODEL FRAMEWORK CONSTRUCTION
In this paper, the basic grid model is used as the simulation framework. This basic framework 
has the advantages of simple structure, complete function and obvious simulation effect. In 
the network, we can clearly see the change of power quality on the user side during the whole 
process of load transfer, and can search for the optimal access point through variable adjust-
ment of the control variables. The construction of a complex and large-scale representa-
tive power network would involve more variables and a slower simulation process, making it 
harder to obtain a large number of comparative simulation results.
Figure 1 shows a basic power system simulation model, which contains a power generation 
module. This simulated module can generate a basic three-phase power with a frequency of 
50 Hz and a voltage of 30 kV. The initial voltage is converted into 500 kV ultra-high voltage 
by a booster substation. The power is transmitted over a standard length of high-voltage 
cable, which is protected by three-section current. A distribution substation is installed at the 
end of the voltage transmission line. The transformation ratio of substations is 50:1. Con-
verting the ultra-high voltage of 500 kV on the high-voltage transmission line to the 10 kV 
ring network cabinet voltage used in the distribution network, the voltage of the 10 kV dis-
tribution network is converted to low-voltage output through a 25:1step-down transformer.
In the construction of the power grid system, the distribution network step-down transformer 
is divided into separate sub-modules, which is conducive to observation and research. The simu-
lated transformer sub-module is shown in Figure 2. The core part of the sub-module is a 25:1 
three-phase step-down transformer. It includes a three-phase circuit breaker which simulates the 
operation of the transformer and a three-phase grounding point. The construction of the trans-
former vehicle is basically the same as that of this step-down transformer module.
In order to simulate the influence of the load shifting of the transformer vehicle to the user 
side and the power grid more accurately, the parameter configuration of the whole power 
grid should be close to that of the real power grid. In the configuration of power plants, 
a three-phase power supply module is used to simulate the power generation directly. The 
module provides three-phase electrical stability and waveform integrity. The capacity of the

50 Hz. The step-up transformer capacity is 60 MVA and the rated frequency is 50 Hz. The 
primary-side rated voltage is 30 kV, and the secondary-side rated voltage is 500 kV. The 
length of the high-voltage transmission line is 300 km. The value of resistance, capacitance, 
and reactance per unit length is uniform. The national standard high-voltage transmission 
line has the same specified value. The capacity of the transformer at the end of the high-
voltage transmission line is 60 MVA. Electrical energy is wasted during transmission over 
high-voltage transmission lines. Therefore, the rated voltage of the primary side of the step-
down transformer is 450 kV, and the rated voltage of the secondary side is 10 kV. In the 
transformer on the distribution network, the simulated user-side consumption is small and 
the user side is not complicated. Therefore, the rated capacity of the distribution network is 
small, with a capacity of 50 kVA.
3 POWER QUALITY ANALYSIS
3.1 Transformer maintenance simulation
The aim is to comprehensively study voltage and current changes in the power network 
during load shifting. The simulation is for different directions and different categories of 
simulation, including two types of transformer periodic maintenance and simulation of a 
transformer aging and being updated. The setting of breaker can be set up in simulation. In 
order to obtain the experimental data more quickly, the use of a three-phase power supply 
instead of power plants can effectively reduce the system stability preparation time, ensuring 
that the whole system can be stabilized in 0.2 seconds.
There are different ways to repair and replace, but the result of the simulation is the same 
as that of the real world: the working principle is load shifting. In the setting of circuit 
breaker parameters, the time of the original state can be changed by the initial breaking state 
of the circuit breaker. In order to obtain a large amount of simulation data conveniently, the 
whole simulation process is set to last 5 seconds. After 0.2 seconds, the power system volt-
age is basically stable and the simulated process can start. At 0.21 seconds, the transformer 
vehicle will be connected to the system to carry out voltage synchronization, so as to prepare 
for the removal of the transformer. At 0.3 seconds, the right-hand side of the transformer 
close to the user-side circuit breaker is cut off, and at 0.33 seconds the left-hand side cir-
cuit breaker of the transformer is cut off. The transformer is detached from the power grid 
and the transformer discharge is completed as soon as possible, preventing internal residual 
power in the transformer from being discharged elsewhere and increasing maintenance risk. 
Between 0.33 seconds and 4 seconds, the transformer’s maintenance, replacement and other 
operations are conducted. At 4.3 seconds, the transformer is reconnected to the power grid 
to carry out voltage synchronization and allow the removal of the transformer vehicle. At 
Figure 2. Simulation model of transformer sub-module in a distribution network.

4.5 seconds, the transformer vehicle is removed from the system and its transformer is dis-
charged as soon as possible, so as to complete the process.
3.2 Simulation results and analysis
This paper develops a simulation of the different effects of load transfer on the power grid 
and its users under different conditions. The standard unitary value is used for comparison. 
When the maintenance plan is received, the power grid is working normally for the users. The 
maintenance unit builds the transformer vehicle and lays the bypass cable. The transformer 
vehicle is allowed to settle into a stable working state for a period of time in parallel to the 
transformer in the distribution network. Following stable operation of the power system at 
0.2 s, the 0.19 s transformer vehicle has just changed the access system. After 0.3 s, the trans-
former vehicle changes the waveform stability, with removal of transformer circuit-breakers 
on both sides of the distribution network at 0.32 s.
The initial grid connection and removal simulation is shown in Figure 3. As can be seen 
from the figure, when the transformer vehicle’s transformer is first connected to the power 
system, the waveform of the transformer vehicle (the bottom trace) is very disorderly and there 
is no stable voltage fluctuation following the small grid. However, this has little impact on the 
main power network and almost no impact on the user side. It proves that the transformer 
vehicle is merged into the power system when it is in normal operation; changing the vehicle 
will not cause obvious power interference to the user side, nor will it pollute the main power 
network. Between 0.19 and 0.3 s on the horizontal axis shown in Figure 3, the waveform of the 
transformer vehicle (the bottom trace) is unstable. The transformer in the distribution network 
should not be removed at this time. After 0.3 s, the waveform of the transformer vehicle is basi-
cally stable, and the transformer in the distribution network can be removed. When removing 
transformer in load. It can be seen from Figure 3 that the removal of the distribution network 
transformer at 0.32 s has a greater impact on the transformer vehicle under the same load con-
ditions. At this time, the three-phase current value of the transformer vehicle varies markedly, 
resulting in a large current inrush, which lasts 10–15 ms. The user side also has the same effect, 
and the user-side voltage reflects a transient distortion. However, there is no obvious effect on 
the stability of the overall user-side voltage or waveform integrity. After 0.34 s, the transformer 
in the distribution network is completely removed without voltage. After grounding discharge, 
this transformer is repaired and replaced.
Transformer maintenance and replacement process in distribution network. The distri-
bution load of the small power grid distribution network is transferred to the transformer 
vehicle. The user side does not experience waveform distortion in the whole process, nor 
overvoltage or other adverse conditions. The working state of the transformer vehicle is sta-
ble, and the working state of the power grid is stable. Once the distribution transformer has 
been overhauled or replaced, it needs to be reconnected to the distribution network. When 
it is replaced at 4.3 seconds (0.2 s on the horizontal axis in Figure 4), the transformer of the

distribution network is merged into the distribution network and will cause transient distor-
tion on the user side. The larger the distortion is, the smaller the impact on the transformer 
vehicle. When the transformer vehicle changes into a single phase, the voltage will change 
and the remaining two phases will work normally. Once the distribution network transformer 
can supply stable power to the user side, at 4.32 seconds (0.22 s in Figure 4), the transformer 
vehicle can be removed from the distribution network. In the process of removing the load 
from the transformer vehicle, there is no obvious effect on the voltage waveform of the user 
side, nor on the transformer in the distribution network. The transformer will be discharged 
from the distribution network to remove the transformer. The transformer maintenance and 
transformer replacement operation is then complete.
3.3 Analysis of factors affecting cutting angle
The aim of this section is to evaluate the influence of different disconnection angles on the user 
side of the distribution transformer and explore when to remove the distribution transformer 
and minimize the impact on the user side. Based on a single-phase benchmark, the effect of 
transformer removal from the distribution network at different single-phase periodic nodes on 
the user side is evaluated, on the basis of a power frequency voltage f = 50 Hz, a voltage period 
T = 0.02 s, and an angular frequency of about 314. The simulation diagrams of the influence 
of removing the distribution network transformer on the user-side voltage and the transformer 
vehicle at different angles are shown in Figures 5 through 8. When changing the control angle 
of the user side, the single-phase angle is variable. The effect of different disconnection angles 
on the user side and the impact on the transformer vehicle can be seen. From top to bottom, 
each figure shows the user-side voltage, the high-voltage side of the distribution network trans-
former, and the impact on the current of the transformer vehicle.
Comparing the degree of influence of different cutting angles on the user side and the dis-
tribution network, the results show that the 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270° disconnections all produce 
instantaneous distortion on the user side. This phenomenon is small and its duration is very

short. When the power grid is cut off at 90° and 270°, the voltage fluctuation is greater. The 
larger impact current inside the transformer vehicle can cause greater impact on the power 
quality of the user side. The influence of the 0° and 180° disconnections on the power distri-
bution substation on the user side is relatively small. When the impulse current produced by 
the transformer vehicle is small, the substation with the distribution network removed has the 
least influence on the power quality of the users.
4 CONCLUSION
In order to improve the power quality on the user side, we studied the change of user-side 
voltage and impulse current of the transformer vehicle in the maintenance operation of a 
distribution substation. In this paper, the operational process associated with a transformer 
vehicle was simulated with MATLAB. The following conclusions are drawn from the com-
parison of power quality changes on the user side:
1. The transformer vehicle has almost no effect on the voltage waveform of the user side and 
distribution network when it is connected to a stable distribution network. This character-
istic enables the transformer vehicle to share part of the load at the peak-load stage for the

distribution transformer, improving the continuity and reliability of power supply. From 
the simulation charts, the distribution network of different capacity transformer vehicles 
with no load and no load is obtained. The time from no-load to stable operation varies. 
Distribution network transformer removal can only be carried out in a phase of stable 
operation; otherwise, it will lead to power supply disorder on the user side. The shock cur-
rent of the transformer vehicle may be too large and can even lead to the collapse of the 
distribution network with the consequence of power failure for users.
2. Once stable operation of the transformer vehicle has been achieved, the distribution trans-
former can be disconnected. The effect of different disconnection angles on the user side 
and the transformer vehicle varies, as can be seen from the simulation diagrams. When 
the disconnection angle is 0°, large voltage fluctuation on the user side will cause certain 
damage to users’ electrical appliances. The transformer vehicle will produce a large impact 
current, which will reduce the service life of the transformer vehicle. When the transformer 
is removed at 180°, the effect on the user side will be minimal. No overvoltage is generated, 
and the impact current of the transformer vehicle is also small. The phase diagram of three-
phase power is 180°. In addition, the two phases of electricity are equal to the opposite 
voltage amplitude. At this point, the removal or introduction of transformers to the entire 
distribution network and the user side of the transformer vehicle will have less impact.

1 INTRODUCTION
The efficiency of the electric machine is varied depending on the type of machine and its 
characteristics. When choosing an electric machine for an EV it is not only the efficiency that 
matters other factors such as cost, reliability etc. are important as well. The various types of 
electric machines used in EVs can be divided into two group commutator machines and com-
mutator less machines. The commutator machines are primarily the DC machines. The DC 
machines need commutator and brushes to feed current to the armature. The brushes are worn 
over time and this makes DC machines more maintenance, heavy than other electric machines. 
The other group of electric machines is as mentioned the commutator less machines. Two of 
the most used commutator less machines are the induction machine (IM) and the permanent 
magnet synchronous machine (PMSM). The benefit of using IMs is low cost, high reliability 
and maintenance free operation (Zeraoulia et al. 2006). Compared to the DC machine, the 
IM has additional advantages such as light weight nature, small volume and high efficiency 
(Casadei et al. 2010). The benefit of using PMSM is its high efficiency and high-power density. 
However, the PMSM also suffers from some disadvantages such as cost because of the price of 
rare-earth magnets, safety in case of wreck and possibility of magnet demagnetization because 
of temperature or control failure (AbdElhafez et al. 2017). Induction motors are extensively 
used for the traction applications, due to its simple structure and easy control. In terms of 
efficiency and power density the BLDC motor is the best choice but when reliability and 
controllability come to the picture Induction motor proves its ability. Tradeoff in Induction 
motor design is carried out with different frequencies to determine the optimal the perform-
ance of the motor (Wang et al. 2005). The thermal and electrical characteristics to be analyzed 
and validated with different heating temperatures (Ulu, Korman & Kömürgözm 2017). The 
performance of the motor can be improved with cooling techniques, along with designing the 

104
mechanical constraints of the motor (Kim et al. 2013). Optimization has been carried out to 
improve the machine performance such as starting torque and efficiency (Jeon et al. 2011).
2 STATUS OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN INDIA
India’s mission is to make all vehicles as electric powered, Fuel Powered automotive vehicles 
have become an inevitable one for transportation from one place to another. In the developing 
era, utmost importance has been given to make a better environment with very low emission. 
In India vehicle increased from 0.3 million in 1951 to 58.3 million in 2001–02. An electric car 
is powered by an electric motor instead of a gasoline engine. The electric motor gets energy 
from a controller, which regulates the amount of power-based on the driver’s use of an accel-
erator pedal. The electric car (also known as electric vehicle or EV) uses energy stored in its 
rechargeable batteries, which are recharged by common household electricity. It doesn’t pollute 
the world; hence the clean and clear energy can be utilized for the traction. India plans to make 
completely electric vehicles in 2030, to provide pollution free environment, as of now India has 
4350 electric cars on the road (Wang et al. 2005, Ulu et al. 2017, Kim et al. 2013 & International 
Energy Agency IEA). Global automotive sector consumes around 30% in the world, in which 
this is the 2nd largest producer of CO2. In 1997 India consumed around 57% of energy and in 
2010 it’s increased to 85%. It’s expected to reach 92% by the year of 2020.Today the automo-
bile sector in India is the upcoming sector which will boom up in the future. This sector has 
been growing at a CAGR in excess of 15% over the last 5–7 years. It contributed 2.77 to 6% 
in improving the national GDP rate. India has 19 passenger car manufacturers, 14 commercial 
vehicles, 16 2/3 wheelers and 12 tractors along with these 5 manufacturers of Engines.
3 DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF INDUCTION MOTOR
Induction motor is the best choice for traction applications. The characteristics of the different 
motors are compared and the results are depicted for the conclusion of choosing he motors.
The electric motor is the heart of the traction vehicles, the motor can be designed by con-
sidering the major mechanical loading such as yoke thickness, frame size, parameters such as 
poles, frequency, rated speed, slip, the electrical loading parameters such as number of conduc-
tors. The magnetic circuit of the motor is constituted by the lamination of the stator, the rotor, 
and the air-gap. The energy conversion is assisted by the flux in the air-gap, driven by magneto-
motive-force (mmf) produced in the stator winding. The mmf required to drive the flux is 
influenced by the reluctance of the magnetic circuit. The reluctance of the magnetic circuit is 
determined by the length and the relative permeability of the material as given in Equation 1.

magnetic circuit is influenced by the shape of the slot and the air-gap. Material composi-
tion of stamping influences the relative permeability and the saturation factor coefficient. 
Reduced reluctance circuit needs less mmf to force the flux, and hence results in less magnet-
izing current. Hence, the output power, power factor, and efficiency improve significantly.

The Induction motor with single cage is found to be 59.1 N-m and the rated torque of the 
Induction motor is found to be 108 N-m. The induction motor with single cage is analyzed 
and performance is compared. In general the double cage induction motor is capable of pro-
ducing high starting torque and less current and better efficiency during running condition. 
Further the double cage rotors have two classifications with different material for both the 
cages and other one with different material for both the cages. In other case a gap is allowed 
between the two rotor cages
The performance of the machine like torque, starting current, power factor, all these param-
eters depends on the material which we choose. The properties of the material have the direct 
effect on the performance on the machine. The BH Curve of the material shows the proper-
ties of the material, the performance of the material depends on the material properties and 
its characteristics. The two materials M19 and M47 have been considered for choosing the

of the machine is presented.
5 CONCLUSIONS
The Induction motor for the traction application is designed and analyzed using FEM analy-
sis. The starting torque for single cage rotor is 59.1 N-m, and the torque for double cage 
induction motor is found to be 79.8 N-m, the performance of the induction motor is found 
to be improved with the double cage rotor bar. Along with these the rotor bar material is 
compared and the performance is shown above, it’s clear that the Induction motor produces 
better efficiency with copper bar. Thus, the induction motor can be best opted for the trac-
tion applications with minimizing the cost of the special motors.

ABSTRACT: The high-voltage circuit breaker is commonly used electrical equipment, and 
the opening/closing coil is the key component of its operating mechanism. The coil current 
reflects the motion characteristic of the circuit breaker. This paper explains the structure 
of the opening/closing coil, and then describes a method to diagnose a circuit breaker fault 
based on detecting its opening/closing current. The method is applied to a 550 kV circuit 
breaker in a converter station. It shows that coil current detection of a circuit breaker is an 
effective method of identifying some hidden mechanical defects in the circuit breaker. Based 
on this method, some previously undiscoverable mechanical faults could be diagnosed, and 
the result is useful to the security and stability of the power system.

1 INTRODUCTION
The opening/closing coil is an important component in the operating mechanism of a high-
voltage circuit breaker. As a primary control unit in the circuit breaker, the structure of the 
opening/closing coil is generally a kind of solenoid electromagnet. When a current passes 
through the opening/closing coil, a magnetic flux is generated, and the iron core inside the 
coil is magnetically attracted, thereby controlling the circuit breaker in the completion of the 
opening or closing operation. Therefore, the function of the opening/closing coil is to convert 
the electrical energy from the power source into magnetic energy, and then into mechanical 
work output through the action of the iron core (Xu et al., 2000).
During the opening and closing process, the coil current changes with time. The current 
waveform reflects the status of the opening/closing coil itself and the control mechanism 
during operation. It contains a large amount of information that can be used for mechani-
cal fault diagnosis. By monitoring the current of the opening/closing coil, the starting time 
of the operating mechanism, the movement time of the iron core, and the energization time 
required by the coil can be calculated. This can be utilized to judge the distance of travel of 
the iron core, the core binding, the coil status (such as whether there is a turn-to-turn short 
circuit) and the action status of the operating mechanism (Dai & Jiao, 2011; Bian, 2012; 
Chen, 2009).

2 STRUCTURE OF OPENING/CLOSING COIL
The opening coil and closing coil have the same structure, as shown in Figure 1. In principle, 
the coil consists of three individual parts: the electrical part, the mechanical part and the 
hydraulic part. The electrical part is mainly composed of a solenoid coil, moving iron core, 
static iron core and ejector rod. The mechanical part includes a connecting lever and its work-
ing chamber. The hydraulic part includes a valve stem, ball valve, return spring and oil gallery.
The ejector rod is fixed in the moving iron core. When the solenoid coil passes current, 
the iron core is subjected to electromagnetic force and drives the ejector rod downward. The 
bottom end of the ejector rod presses the connecting lever and opens the ball valve through 
the valve stem. Then, the high- and low-pressure oil galleries of the circuit breaker hydrau-
lic mechanism are penetrated. When the current in the solenoid coil disappears, under the 
hydraulic pressure generated by the ball valve and the return spring, the connecting lever and 
the ejector rod are reset, and the valve is thus closed.
3 CURRENT OF OPENING/CLOSING COIL
Laboratory and on-site inspection experience show that the current waveform of an open-
ing/closing coil has good repeatability (Meng et al., 2006). The normal current waveform is 
shown in Figure 2.
According to the current waveform of the opening/closing coil, the current has two peak points 
and one valley point, and the waveform can be divided into four stages according to the move-
ment of the iron core (Song et al., 2011; Yuan et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2013; Zhong et al., 2011):
• Stage 1: T0–T1. T0 is the starting point of the circuit breaker opening and closing operation. 
T1 is the starting moment of the core movement, when the current in the coil rises enough 
to drive the movement of the core. This stage is characterized by an exponential rise in cur-
rent and the iron core is at rest. T1 is related to the controlling power voltage and the coil 
resistance.
Figure 1. Structure of opening/closing coil.

113
 I1 is the starting moment current of the iron core. This value is the maximum current dur-
ing the T0–T1 section and reflects the initial position of the iron core and the resistance at 
idle.
• Stage 2: T1–T2. The core moves to produce a counter-electromotive force and the coil cur-
rent drops. T2 is the valley point of the control current and represents the actuation by the 
core of the load of the operating mechanism, thus significantly decelerating or stopping 
its movement. It is the total movement time of the core.
 As the counter-electromotive force is added to the circuit, the coil current will decrease. I2 
is the core stop moment current, and is the minimum current during the T1–T2 section. It 
reflects the magnitude of resistance during over-travel and the maximum movement speed 
of the core.
• Stage 3: T2–T3. The iron core stops moving and the current rises exponentially. I3 is the 
maximum working current of the coil. This value is the maximum current between T2 
and T3. It is the maximum working current of the coil when the moving iron core stops. It 
reflects the DC resistance of the coil, and whether there is a short circuit inside the coil or 
a loose-joint failure.
• Stage 4: T3–T4. When the auxiliary switch is turned off, an arc is generated and jumps 
between the auxiliary switch contacts. The arc voltage rises rapidly, forcing the current to 
decrease until it is extinguished at time T4.
Taking T0 as the zero point of the commanding time, the mechanical characteristics of the 
circuit breaker can be obtained by extracting the four time-characteristic parameters of T1, 
T2, T3 and T4 and the three current-characteristic parameters of I1, I2 and I3 from the current 
waveform (Mu et al., 2013).
4 DETECTION OF OPENING/CLOSING COIL CURRENT
Since the 550 kV Gas-Insulated Switchgear (GIS) equipment of a ±500 kV converter sta-
tion was first put into operation, failures during the circuit breakers’ reclosing have occurred 
many times, which has seriously affected the safe and stable operation of the power grid. In 
the most recent fault, an instantaneous ground fault occurred in line C, and the protection 
action tripped the 5052 and 5053 circuit breakers. Then, after the protection was issued, the 
5052 and 5053 circuit breakers’ C-phase reclosing failed. The inconsistent protection action 
tripped three phases.
In order to analyze more deeply the cause of the circuit breaker failure, the mechanical 
fault of the circuit breaker is diagnosed on the basis of the current-detection technology of 
the opening/closing coil. The compensation-loop current sensor is used to detect the coil cur-
rent signal. The detection object includes the closing coils and the opening coils of the 5052 
and 5053 C phases, and the closing and opening coils of the 5053 A phase for comparison. 
Figure 2. Current waveform of opening/closing coil.

114
The time-characteristic and current-characteristic values and the coils’ direct resistance are 
shown in Table 1.
According to the test results, the characteristic value I3 of each opening and closing coil are 
basically equal, and the direct resistance of the coils is normal (36 Ω ±10%). Therefore, short 
circuits inside the coils and loose-joint failures can be discounted.
Comparing the measurement results, the current waveforms of the opening coils of the 
5052 and 5053 C phases, in which the reclosing failure occurs, are different from other coils, 
and the characteristic values T2 and I1 (highlighted in bold type in Table 1) are smaller than 
in other phases.
Through on-site inspection of the circuit breaker operating mechanism, it is found that the 
operating mechanism is clean, without debris or oil leakage. Therefore, the opening coils of 
the 5052 and 5053 C phases may have an internal fault.
5 DISASSEMBLY ANALYSIS OF OPENING/CLOSING COIL
The two opening coils were disassembled. Oil traces were found on the ejector rods of the 
5052 and 5053 C-phase opening coils, as illustrated in Figure 3. After each ejector rod was 
inserted downward, the movement of the ejector rod was relatively slow when it rebounded, 
and it could not automatically be returned normally.
Combined with the current waveform detection result of the opening and closing coils, it 
is judged that the ejector rods of the 5052 and 5053 C-phase opening coils are not returning 
to position before the fault. The iron core and the ejector rod are in the intermediate stroke 
position before the opening coil is energized, and the electromagnetic attraction force is thus 
larger than in the idle position. Therefore, the required current (I1) for driving the core and 
the ejector rod to overcome the resistance is smaller. At the same time, due to the incomplete 
return, the travel distance of the core is shorter, so the core’s movement time (T2) is shorter.
Under normal working conditions, when the circuit breaker is closing, the closing coil will 
be energized. Then, the closing control valve is opened, and the high-pressure oil flows from 
the closing control valve to the lower side of the piston rod, driving the piston rod upward, 
and then the circuit breaker is closed. At this time, on one side of the opening coil is high-
pressure oil, and on the other side is low-pressure oil (Rao et al., 2012; Rao, 2012).
If there exists a fault in the opening coil, causing the ejector rod and the iron core to fail 
to return completely, the valve in the opening coil cannot be closed, and the high- and low-
pressure hydraulic circuits cannot be completely separated. During the closing process, some 
of the high-pressure oil flows back to the low-pressure fuel tank through the opening coil, 
so that the driving force of the high-pressure oil on the closing circuit is insufficient, and the 
closing operation cannot be completed.
According to the on-site inspection, during the operation of the circuit breaker corre-
sponding to the opening coil fault, the disc spring displacements of the mechanisms are 
significantly larger than their normal values.

The mechanism state for the circuit breaker’s closing position is shown in Figure 4; the red 
elements represent high-pressure oil and the blue elements represent low-pressure oil.
The defective opening coils were disassembled to further analyze the causes of the ram 
ejector rod and oil traces. After disassembly, it was found that there was more grease on the 
connecting lever. Although the outer seal of the coil was tight, there was no special ‘inter-
nal seal’ between the mechanical and electrical parts of the coil. The overuse of grease had 
caused some of the grease to enter the electrical portion of the coil along the ejector rod, 
resulting in an increase in friction between the ejector rod and the core. When the coil is ener-
gized, the electromagnetic force is large enough to overcome the frictional force to drive the 
core and the ejector movement. Once the coil is de-energized, the ejector rod mainly relies on 
the return spring to return to position; however, the return spring has less force, and this is 
insufficient to overcome the frictional force and drive the ejector rod to return to its original 
position.

tion; (b) horizontal cross section.

The overuse of grease in the connecting lever section is caused by poor process control by 
the manufacturer. According to the manufacturer’s standard process requirements, it is only 
necessary to use a small amount of grease at the contact areas between the connecting lever, 
the stem and the ejector rod. However, it was found that grease had been applied everywhere 
on the connecting lever. A brush is used to apply grease to the connecting lever in the factory 
but it is difficult to apply a small amount of grease evenly using this type of tool. In addition, 
under the influence of the heater inside the mechanism, the internal temperature is higher 
and lowers the viscosity of the grease on the connecting lever. Together, the overuse of grease 
and the higher ambient temperature cause the ‘internal leak’ of the grease.
6 CONCLUSIONS
A circuit breaker’s opening/closing coil current contains a lot of mechanical information 
about the circuit breaker. By detecting and analyzing the current waveform of the opening 
and closing coil, a mechanical defect in the circuit breaker can be effectively found. This 
paper introduces the operating principle of a hydraulic mechanism and the structure of the 
opening/closing coil. Based on the current-detection technology of the opening/closing coil, 
the reason for the frequent closing or reclosing failures of circuit breakers in a converter sta-
tion is analyzed.
At present, the detection technology of the opening/closing coil current is rarely applied 
in power grid inspection. The conclusions of this paper can provide a reference for the wider 
application and popularization of this technology in the power grid.

ABSTRACT: The main purpose of this design is to provide a stable reference voltage for a 
switch magnetism-sensing circuit. Because of the inherent characteristics of the circuit, the 
reference voltage is set to 3.3 V. In this paper, the reference voltage source is designed to have 
a wide input range, a stable output and a good temperature characteristic. The simulation 
results of the reference voltage and the complete design layout are described. The simulation 
results based on a 4 μm 25 V bipolar process verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis 
and the feasibility of the proposed methods.
Keywords: Reference voltage, constant current, temperature coefficient
1 INTRODUCTION
In recent years, the techniques around analog Integrated Circuits (ICs) have undergone 
big change. This places high demands on the voltage, power consumption, precision and 
response speed in an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) design. It is becoming 
increasingly difficult for the circuit structure of a traditional reference voltage source to 
meet the design requirement (Allen & Holberg, 2005; Gray & Meyer, 1993; Hastings, 2004). 
At present, there are three main types of design for a reference voltage source: the buried 
Zener diode, the Extra Implanted Field-Effect Transistor (XFET), and the bandgap refer-
ence voltage source. The buried Zener diode and the XFET reference voltage sources feature 
high precision and good stability. However, the buried Zener diode has a high power supply 
voltage and high power consumption, and XFET reference voltage source manufacturing is 
complex and is not compatible with the bipolar process. The traditional bandgap reference 
voltage source can be compatible with the bipolar process, and a circuit with high precision 
and low temperature coefficient (Qin et al., 2006). By adjusting the parameters of the emit-
ter area and resistance, an output voltage with zero temperature coefficient can be achieved. 
However, the voltage is fixed at 1.25 V and cannot meet the switch magnetism-sensing cir-
cuit’s reference voltage circuit requirements; at the same time, the reference voltage will be 
affected by the operational amplifier input offset voltage (Bilotti et al., 1997; Huang et al., 
2015).
On the basis of this analysis, we propose a novel reference voltage source structure. Our 
circuit has a small area, low temperature coefficient and stable performance; it does not 
require changes to the original process (i.e. the original circuit can be smoothly upgraded).
2 ANALYSIS OF THE TRADITIONAL REFERENCE VOLTAGE SOURCE
2.1 Circuit analysis
Figure 1 shows a traditional reference voltage source circuit. The circuit is composed of 
differential amplifiers, P-type Metal-Oxide-Semiconductors (PMOSs) M1 and M2, bipo-
lar transistors Q1 and Q2, and resistors R1–R3. From Figure 1, we can obtain the equation 
Vref_conventional = Vbe1 + (R2VTlnn)/R3. The reference voltage with zero temperature coefficient is 

118
calculated by taking the derivative with respect to temperature: Vref_conventional = Vbe1 + 17.2 VT ≈ 
1.25 V, Vbe/ T ≈ −1.5 mV/K, VT/ T ≈ 0.087 mV/K. It can be seen that the traditional refer-
ence circuit Vref_conventional is locked in at 1.25 V.
2.2 Defect analysis
The traditional reference voltage source circuit contains an operational amplifier, and its 
symmetry is not good. Therefore, the operational amplifier is affected by the input offset 
voltage, resulting in an error in the reference voltage. The input offset voltage can be quanti-
fied as VOS, and the new equations Vbe1 ± VOS ≈ Vbe2 + R3Ic2 and Vref_conventional = Vbe2 + (R3 + R2)
Ic2 can be derived. So, Vref_conventional = Vbe2 + (1 + R2/R3) (VT lnn ± VOS). As can be seen from 
the equation, VOS is amplified by a factor of (1 + R2/R3). Thus, it is inevitable that an error 
exists in Vref_conventional. More importantly, VOS changes with temperature, which increases the 
temperature coefficient of the conventional reference voltage source. The previous analysis 
shows that the reference voltage Vref_conventional is locked in at 1.25 V. Therefore, it cannot satisfy 
the reference voltage demand of the switch magnetism-sensing circuit.
3 A NEW DESIGN FOR A REFERENCE VOLTAGE SOURCE
We can obtain the following equation from Figure 2: Vbe1 = Vbe2 + IoRe. Q1 and Q2 have the 
same parameters; Io is the output reference current. On the basis of the base-emitter voltage 
formula of the triode, Vbe = VTln(Ic/Is), it is easy to derive Equation 1:

where VT is thermal voltage (VT = kT/q, where k = 1.38×10–23 J is the Boltzmann constant, 
q is the electron charge and T is absolute temperature); Ic is the collector current and Is is 
the inverse saturation current. The parameters of triodes Q1 and Q2 are the same (Is1 = Is2). 
According to Figure 2, Ic1 of collector current can be replaced by Iref if we overlook the func-
tion of the base current. Similarly, Ic2 can be replaced by Io and we know that:

Io is the required current for our method and we can see that Io is constant. Therefore, a 
new reference voltage source circuit is designed based on this source circuit; the circuit is 
composed of a reference voltage source circuit, start-up circuit, isolating circuit, feedback 
loop and switch magnetism-sensing circuit, as shown in Figure 3. The switch magnetism-
sensing circuit is not our focus, so we will not describe it further in this paper.

The ratio of each resistance and zero temperature coefficient voltage of Vref can be obtained 
from the derivative with respect to temperature. At the same time, the range of reference volt-
age is changed by adjusting the resistances of R6 and R8.
3.2 Start-up circuit
The function of the start-up circuit is to make the circuit avoid the zero state when the circuit 
starts, and enter the working state without disturbing normal function. The start-up circuit 
includes transistors T1, T2, T3, T9 and T10 and resistors R1 and R2. When the circuit is pow-
ered, the voltage at point E rises up and turns on the T9. T9 provides a path for the current 
mirror. When the current mirror composed of T1 and T2 is turned on, the voltage at point 
C rises and T3 turns on. The reference voltage regulator circuit (inside the red dotted box in 
Figure 3) starts to work.
3.3 Isolating circuit
Once the reference voltage regulator circuit is working, the voltage at point D rises and T5 
turns on. Then the voltage at point C is pulled low and T3 turns off. The start-up circuit is

separated from the reference voltage regulator circuit. The reference voltage can be set inde-
pendently of the supply voltage.
4 SIMULATION
Based on the performance indexes of the relevant modules and the relative parameters of the 
existing commercial chips, the main technical indexes of the overall circuit and the reference 
voltage source circuit are determined, as shown in Tables 1 and 2. The key point of the test is 
whether the design will affect the switch magnetism-sensing circuit when the supply voltage 
varies between 4.5 and 24 V.
In this paper, the circuit design provides a reference voltage for the switch magnetism-
sensing circuit. Therefore, we first observe whether the overall circuit functions correctly.
The simulation results are shown in Figure 4, and the magnetic signal is simulated with a 
sinusoidal signal. When the magnetic field intensity is higher than the upper limit threshold, 
the circuit output will be HIGH, and when the intensity is lower than the lower limit thresh-
old, the circuit output will be LOW. The performance index conforms to design requirements. 
The output rise time tr is the time interval for the response curve to increase from 10% to 90%: 
TM0 − TM2 ≈ (1.91809–1.91794) ms = 0.05 μs, as shown in Figure 4a. The result is less than 
0.2 μs, which conforms to the requirements of the design. The output fall time tf is the time 
interval for the response curve to fall from 90% to 10%: TM1 − TM3 ≈ (1.91809–1.91794) ms = 
0.05 μs, as shown in Figure 4b. Again, the result is less than 0.2 μs, which conforms to the 
requirements of the design.
Next, we need to verify whether the design will be affected by the reference voltage source cir-
cuit and the switch magnetism-sensing circuit when the supply voltage varies from 4.5 to 24 V.
The output voltage stability is an important basis for reference circuit performance. 
According to the above analysis, by substituting relevant design parameters into Equation 6, 
we can see that the reference voltage value is approximately 3.3 V. At a temperature of 25°C, 
the simulation result for reference voltage Vref is shown in Figure 5b (DC scan of the reference 
voltage). The output voltage only changes by 87.0304 mV when the input voltage changes 
from 4.32 to 24 V, and the output error is 0.47%, which is far lower than 1%: thus, it meets 
the performance requirements.
Another important indicator of the reference source is its stability over a wide tempera-
ture range. Temperature Coefficient (TC) is an important parameter in measuring the tem-
perature change of the output voltage of a bandgap reference voltage source. The simulation

result is shown in Figure 5a. The reference voltage changes 9.23102 mV when the tempera-
ture changes from 0 to 150°C and VDD = 10 V. The TC of the voltage reference source is 18.65 
ppm/°C, which meets the design requirement.
As shown in Figure 6, with power supply voltages of 5, 15 and 21 V, the curve of the ref-
erence voltage with temperature change is obtained. Under a constant supply voltage, the 
temperature is changed from 0 to 150 °C and the error in the reference voltage is lower than 
27 mV. Under constant temperature, the supply voltage is changed from 5 to 21 V and the 
error in the reference voltage is lower than 90 mV.
In this paper, the design of the chip layout is completed using a BCD 4 μm 25 V bipolar 
process. Figure 7 shows the chip layout and the location of the reference voltage source. The 
layout is connected by a single layer of metal wire, with an area of 1.225692 mm2 (length ×

from 5 to 25 V, the operating point (BOP), release point (BRP) and hysteresis (BHY) of the chip 
remained about the same. That is to say, the chip can work normally under a 5–25 V supply 
voltage.
Compared with the traditional reference, we can see that the improved chip supports 
a wider supply voltage range, its layout area is smaller, and its reference voltage is higher 
(Bilotti et al., 1997; Huang et al., 2015; Zeng et al., 2018).
5 CONCLUSION
This design provides a stable reference voltage for the switch magnetism-sensing circuit. The 
simulation results show that the output voltage only changes 87.0304 mV when the input 
voltage changes from 4.32 to 24 V, and the output error is only 0.47%. At the same time, the 
reference voltage changes 9.23102 mV when the temperature changes from 0 to 150°C, and 
the temperature coefficient is 18.65 ppm/°C.

1 INTRODUCTION
As a new charging method, wireless charging technology is receiving more and more peo-
ple’s favor. However, a new problem has arisen. On the one hand, transmission power and 
transmission efficiency are affected by the alignment accuracy. On the other hand, part of 
power is consumed on metal due to the eddy current effect when metal is mixed in the energy 
transmission region, which greatly increases the charging time. More seriously, lots of heat 
is generated due to the metal eddy current effect. The sharply rising temperature can easily 
lead to serious safety accidents, which could cause great harm to people’s lives and property. 
Therefore, the problem of alignment and foreign object detection in the wireless charging sys-
tem urgently needs to be solved (Zhou, 2018; Wang, 2010; Ma et al., 2017; Bai et al., 2017).
A set of detection methods is proposed in this paper, which completely solves the prob-
lem of alignment detection, metal foreign object detection, both before charging and dur-
ing charging. The software algorithm is designed to include the detection algorithm in each 
charging process and the complete detection flow chart.
2 STRUCTURE OF THE IMPROVED BALANCED COIL
In this paper, an improved balanced coil structure is proposed, which can be used in metal 
detection during the process of wireless charging. It takes into account both the wireless 
charging alignment and metal foreign object detection.
The coil adopts a figure of eight structure, including part A and part B, as shown in 
Figure 1. Ideally, when there is no foreign matter in electromagnetic coupling area, the elec-
tromagnetic fields passing through the two detection coils A and B are completely the same. 
According to the principle of electromagnetic induction, the electromotive force induced by 

124
the A and B coils are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Since the electromotive 
forces of the A and B coils are cancelled, the total output voltage of the balanced coil is zero. 
However, when foreign objects are mixed in the charging system, the magnetic fields passing 
through A and B are not the same and the induced electromotive force is not equal. There-
fore, the balance coil terminal voltage is not zero. According to this terminal voltage signal, 
we can judge that metal foreign metal matter has been mixed in the magnetic field coupling 
region (Yang et al., 2015; S. Yamazaki et al., 2002).
The balanced coil is laid on the surface of the transmitting coil, coupled with the trans-
mitting coil and the receiving coil without occupying extra space. As shown in Figure 2, the 
structure has the advantages of simple device and high sensitivity.
When the balanced coil is used for alignment detection, the principle is similar. As shown 
in Figure 3, when the transmitter and receiver coils are offset in the X-axis direction, the 
terminal voltage of the balanced coil is not zero. By detecting the voltage value of the bal-
ance coil, it is determined whether the wireless charging system is accurately positioned in 
the X-axis direction.
3 THE DETECTION ALGORITHM
Alignment and foreign object detection circuit includes: rectification and filtering circuit; 
voltage amplification circuit; comparator circuit; Arm processor. Figure 4 shows the process 
flow of detection signal.

3.1 Alignment detection
In order to solve the problems that the unbalanced voltage caused by the alignment is much 
larger than the imbalance voltage caused by metal foreign metal objects, as charging system 
applies low-power operation during alignment detection. In the comparison of the coil volt-
age and the alignment threshold, if it is greater than the maximum voltage allowed for the 
alignment, a command to stop charging is issued and a warning for re-alignment is issued to 
the user (Qu, 2016; Low et al., 2010). The detection flow is as shown in Figure 4.
3.2 Metal foreign objects detection
For metal detection in wireless charging, this article studies two phases of foreign object 
detection, including metal detection before charging and metal detection during charging. 
The following two separate metal detections are separately described.
Before the start of charging, only the transmitter coil exists. In the experiment, a fixed AC 
voltage was applied to the transmission coil to record the terminal voltage of the balance 
coil when there are no metal foreign objects. When there is metal placed over the transmit-
ting coil, the terminal voltage of the balance coil is different from the situation when there 
is no metal foreign object. When the voltage change value is greater than the threshold, the 
processor considers that there is metal foreign matter mixed in, and therefore it will alert the 
user, whilst at the same time, the charging mechanism will be locked to be in a non-chargeable 
state. The detection process is shown in Figure 6.
In order to solve the problem of unbalanced voltage caused by coil winding asymmetry 
and alignment inaccuracy, the feedback voltage −U2 is introduced. First, the unbalanced

voltage is completely cancelled out by the feedback voltage to ensure that the balance coil 
terminal voltage is zero at the charging start time, and then the metal detection in the charg-
ing process can be performed.
Through experimental observation, the power fluctuations in normal charging cause the 
little sudden changes in the balance coil terminal voltage. Therefore, the voltage is collected at 
intervals of one second in each sampling period, and the average value is acquired three times 
in succession. This value is compared with the value measured in the next cycle, so that the 
influence of power fluctuation on the detection can be avoided. In addition, large power bursts 
occur due to the switching time of the charging phase. At the moment of phase transition, 
foreign object detection is stopped. After waiting for a smooth transition to the new charging 
stage, restart the foreign object detection. The detection flow chart is shown in Figure 7.
An improved balance coil detection method is used to simultaneously handle two issues of 
wireless charging alignment and foreign matter detection. This article proposes innovatively 
a set of alignment and metal foreign object detection solutions, which are divided into three 
phases. The specific solution is as follows.
The first stage is metal detection before charging. At the factory, a fixed AC voltage is 
applied to the transmitting coil to record the terminal voltage as a factory value without 
metal foreign matter. When there is metal placed over the transmit coil, the balance coil 
terminal voltage changes. Because the transmission magnetic field is weak and the metal 
foreign body causes a small change in the balance coil terminal voltage, an amplifier is used 
to amplify the voltage of the collected balance coil by ten times. When the voltage change 
value is greater than the threshold, the processor considers that there is a metal foreign object 
mixed in to alert the user and at the same time the charging mechanism is locked to be in a 
non-chargeable state. If it is determined that there is no foreign matter mixed in, the charging 
system will be in a chargeable state and the device waits to enter the second stage.
The second stage is alignment detection. If it is determined in the first stage that there is 
no foreign matter mixed in, the electric device will be allowed to enter the charging area for 
alignment. Applying low power to charge after alignment, the balanced coil balancing voltage 
is collected in this low-power charging situation. At this time, the unbalanced voltage on both 
sides of the coil is compared with the allowable threshold voltage of the alignment. If the volt-
age is greater than the threshold voltage, the charging instruction will be stopped and will give 
the user a reminder of re-alignment. If the alignment is normal, it will enter the third stage.
The third stage is metal detection during charging. After the alignment detection, the device 
starts charging. The unbalanced voltage at this time is first recorded, and the feedback is intro-
duced to cancel out the unbalanced voltage caused by coil winding asymmetry and alignment 
inaccuracy. Subsequently, the balance coil terminal voltage is collected once every second, the 
voltage values are collected three times in succession during each sampling period to obtain the 
mean value, and the recorded mean value is compared with the value measured in the next cycle. 
If the voltage change is larger than the voltage change threshold caused by the normal power 
fluctuation, it is considered that there is foreign matter mixed in until the end of the charging

process. In addition, foreign object detection is stopped at the transition of the charging stage. 
After waiting for a smooth transition to the new charging stage, foreign object detection restarts.

experimental results are shown in Table 3. The experiment verified that the algorithm is fea-
sible and practical.
5 CONCLUSION
Firstly, an improved balanced coil structure was introduced that can take into account align-
ment and foreign objects detection. Then, a set of detection methods was proposed for the 
detection problems, which completely solved the problems of detection of the alignment and 
detection of metal foreign objects before and during charging. The detection algorithm in 
the charging process, as well as a comprehensive inspection flow chart, is designed. Finally, 
the experiment verified that the algorithm is feasible and practical. Limitations still exist in 
this study. Owing to the limited time and labor, only 11 sets of weights were simulated, which 
may be insufficient for the uncertainty analysis. A more detailed study, such as supported by 
the Monte Carlo simulation, should be further conducted to quantify the uncertainty of eco-
corridor construction, which may lead to a deviation of positioning ecological engineers.

equipment in nuclear power plants

ABSTRACT: Maintaining healthy operating conditions of major equipment in nuclear 
power plants is an important foundation for safeguarding nuclear safety. Focusing on char-
acteristics of equipment operation, management requirements and equipment status infor-
mation, an evaluation method suitable for assessment of the health condition of major 
equipment is proposed. Taking full advantage of existing equipment monitoring data, this 
method is composed of a system for multi-level indicator establishment, and an architecture 
model for this system based on equipment failure phenomena. In the meantime, a method 
combining variable indicator weight distribution and fuzzy synthetic evaluation is proposed, 
which applies an analytic hierarchy process to recognize the deterioration in key indicators 
for major equipment in nuclear power plants. This method is shown to be simple and practi-
cal for evaluating the health status of main pump shaft systems.
Keywords: nuclear power equipment, analytic hierarchy process, fuzzy synthetic assessment
1 INTRODUCTION
Major equipment is the core and main resource for nuclear power plant production as well as 
an important guarantee of nuclear safety. During the normal operational period of primary 
circuit equipment, operators cannot enter nuclear islands to conduct repairs, and managers 
need to promptly establish intervention programs, such as contingency or outage plans, based 
on equipment health conditions to ensure the reliability of nuclear island equipment. Before 
overhaul, managers should also comprehensively assess the health condition of nuclear 
island equipment to arrange maintenance plans and tasks properly. In recent years, with 
more serious ramifications attaching to insufficient or excessive maintenance, research and 
application of condition-based maintenance have gradually become widespread. Compared 
to preventive maintenance, condition-based maintenance can extend equipment life, ensure 
safe and reliable operation of equipment, and significantly improve equipment reliability and 
economy (Lin, 2016; Li et al., 2012; Ahmad & Kamaruddin, 2012). According to the equip-
ment health assessment results, condition-based maintenance comprehensively assesses the 
equipment health condition by obtaining data that characterizes the operational status of 
the equipment, and predicts equipment-condition trends and failure risk in order to develop the 
corresponding condition-based maintenance schedules (Yu, 2015; Lin et al., 2014).
Synthetic evaluation models of equipment have mainly involved such methods as princi-
pal component analysis, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), fuzzy mathematics, artificial 
neural networks or gray clustering. Because of their applicability to the assessment of com-
plex equipment conditions, a combination of fuzzy synthetic evaluation and AHP has been 
widely applied. Meanwhile, more and more scholars have devoted time to combining various 
evaluation algorithms to develop new synthetic evaluation models and theories. Yu Qian, 
who has been conducting a great deal of research on electrical equipment health assessment, 
established a method for assessing the health condition of major equipment such as trans-
formers (Yu & Li, 2013; Li, 2015; Zhang et al., 2013). Based on AHP and fuzzy synthetic 

130
evaluation, Fu Xuewei developed a multiple-experts cloud-model fuzzy AHP method and 
achieved remarkable application results (Fu, 2011). Li Rong proposed a synthetic assessment 
of the health condition of bridges based on the AHP and fuzzy synthetic evaluation meth-
ods, and applied a genetic algorithm to optimize weight value selection (Li, 2007). Luo Li 
established an assessment index system and evaluation theories for railway tamping vehicles 
(Luo, 2014). Wang Chuan established an evaluation system for equipment vibration indices 
and verified the indicators’ validity with examples (Wang, 2011). Many scholars have con-
ducted a great deal of research on theoretical systems and algorithms for major equipment 
health assessments in various industries. However, because of the sensitivity and complexity 
of nuclear power equipment, there has not been any in-depth theoretical and synthetic evalu-
ation research on the health condition of nuclear equipment to date.
In this paper, a health condition assessment method for major equipment at nuclear power 
plants is presented, and a comprehensive, balanced and practical model for equipment health 
condition evaluation is established to provide a reference for the health management and 
maintenance of nuclear plant equipment.
2 EVALUATION INDEX SYSTEM
Condition evaluation indices are key to establishing equipment evaluation models. However, 
because most of the major equipment at nuclear power plants involves complex functional 
systems and structures with many influencing factors, it is necessary to establish the evalua-
tion index model based on existing equipment monitoring systems at nuclear power plants.
Equipment-condition monitoring parameters, the most direct parameters to characterize 
equipment health conditions, are the main source of equipment evaluation indices. In real-
ity, the health condition of an indicator is not only related to its parameter value, but also 
its change trend and type. Taking main pump vibration in a nuclear island as an example, in 
the process of analyzing the health condition of the axis displacement index, besides shaft 
displacement, attention should also be paid to axial displacement ratio, ratio variation, devia-
tion value, deviation variation and trend analysis results for both axes. If each program is 
taken as a monitoring task, the indicator evaluation result can be judged by multiple moni-
toring tasks.
A monitoring task often corresponds to different fault modes and fault phenomena. 
Therefore, when selecting equipment indicators and monitoring tasks, it is necessary to ana-
lyze equipment fault modes first, then identify equipment fault phenomena to formulate 
monitoring tasks. Based on the importance of different failure modes, repeated monitoring 
tasks should be avoided under the premise of guaranteeing complete and comprehensive 
reflection of the equipment health condition, and the evaluation indicator is identified by the 
filtered monitoring tasks to establish the indicator models shown in Figure 1.
In order to fully reflect the equipment health condition, besides condition monitoring 
parameters, fault and defect indicators, safety indicators, reliability indicators and environ-
mental protection indicators should also be established according to equipment functions 
and characteristics.

3 EQUIPMENT HEALTH EVALUATION MODEL
A great number of phenomena in the objective world are fuzzy because their development 
represents a spectrum from quantitative changes to qualitative changes and clear bounda-
ries cannot be found between them (He & Zheng, 2013). By quantifying the uncertainty of 
research objects, fuzzy theory uses computers to handle the information and thus, quanti-
tatively describes the uncertainty of the objects (Shen, 2015). Based on fuzzy mathematics, 
fuzzy synthetic assessment is a method that quantifies the unclear, non-quantitative factors 
to synthetically assess the grade of membership (Li, 2013).
3.1 Identification of index weight
At present, the commonly used subjective weight determination methods are expert evalu-
ation and AHP, of which AHP can express and process the experts’ subjective judgments 
in the form of quantity and calculate the weights of equipment through mathematical 
methods using strict logic. When analyzing complex systems with very many indices, AHP 
helps confirm weights appropriately, which is difficult for the expert evaluation method. An 
importance-scale criterion should be selected according to the characteristics of equipment 
indices when using AHP to establish weighting models. The traditional criterion of impor-
tance scale divides the importance of indicators into ten levels, which makes it difficult 
to make accurate judgments in actual use and increases the risk of inconsistent judgment 
matrices. In order to improve applicability, based on the classification management prac-
tice of equipment at nuclear power plants, the importance scale is divided into four levels: 
economic, common, important and key, from which the determined economic-level index is 
directly excluded as redundant because it has little impact on equipment. The importance-
scale values of common-, important- and key-level indices correspond to one, two and three, 
respectively.
After classifying the index importance, the judgment matrix C needs to be established 
according to the importance-scale values. The matrix is as follows:

After establishing the judgment matrix C, the maximum eigenvalue λmax and the corre-

Generally, the weight distribution models established with this method do not need to 
be verified for the consistency of the judgment matrix. If verification is needed for several 
indicators, it can be conducted on the basis of the traditional verification method presented 
by Saaty (1980).
3.2 Fuzzy synthetic assessment model
By constructing multi-level fuzzy subsets, the fuzzy synthetic evaluation quantifies various 
influencing factors of the evaluated object according to the fuzzy indicators, and then uses 
the fuzzy transformation principle to obtain comprehensive indices. In addition to index sets 

132
and index weights, the fuzzy synthetic evaluation also needs to establish a comment set and 
the membership functions of the indices.
The establishment of a comment set is mainly based on equipment evaluation require-
ments and industry characteristics. According to the usual practice of plant health assess-
ment at nuclear power plants, the equipment health condition can generally be divided into 
four levels: health, attention, warning and alarm, which, respectively, correspond to four 
colors: green, white, yellow and red (Yuan, 2016). In other words, the comment set H can be 
expressed as H = [green, white, yellow, and red].
Construction of the index comment membership function should be determined based 
on major equipment management habits in nuclear power plants in order to match the 
evaluation result with the actual situation and enhance the value of on-site application. 
According to the characteristics of nuclear power plant equipment management, after the 
major equipment index parameters reach pre-warning or alarm values, all specialized and 
operations departments should analyze the equipment situation or implement correspond-
ing intervention measures and contingency plans. Therefore, according to the requirements 
of existing equipment management systems of nuclear power plants, in order to guarantee 
the principle that the evaluation result matches the on-site equipment management, the 
membership function can be simulated by rectangular distribution when constructing the 
membership function of the yellow and red states. The white and green evaluation reflects 
an initial degradation of equipment health, which does not involve mandatory management 
requirements, so the initial state can be determined on the basis of the equipment health 
degradation mechanism. Most equipment failure processes continuously develop and accu-
mulate, which means the equipment health deterioration is a process ranging from zero to 
one, and the relationship between parameter value and equipment condition is relatively 
fuzzy. However, although the equipment does not significantly deteriorate when the indica-
tor value deviates from a historically normal range, the equipment condition is apparently 
more likely to be abnormal.
Based on the above principle, when establishing the membership function of the 
evaluation set, fitting can be performed according to the distribution curve shown in 
Figure 2.
In Figure 2, Gh, Gl, Wh, Wl, Yh, Yl, Rh and Rl are deterministic boundaries of corresponding 
color state and their values can be selected from the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) 
guidelines (Yuan, 2016). With adequate historical sample data, a 95% confidence interval for 
the sample data distribution during a normal historical period can be selected as the values 
of Gh and Gl, and a 99.7% confidence interval can be selected as the values of Wh and Wl. 
In normal operational processes, exceeding Wh and Wl is considered to be a low-probability 
event, and the membership degree that belongs to white is one. According to Figure 2, the 
membership function of the corresponding evaluation sets of red, yellow, white and green 
states is shown as:

The indicator evaluation results should be determined through monitoring tasks, and each 
monitoring task is actually a different monitoring and evaluation method of the correspond-
ing indicators. The evaluation result vector of indicator I should be equal to the most dete-
riorative assessment results in the related monitoring tasks.
In reality, weighted-average principles can be used to determine the relative degree of dete-
rioration for each monitoring task. The evaluation rating is regarded as a kind of relative 
position in the weighted-average principle. In order to process quantitatively, the numbers 
zero, one, three and nine can be used to localize each indicator level and define the rank of 
each grade. Each rank in the monitoring task result vector is weighted and summed to obtain 
the relative position of the evaluated object. The monitoring task result with the highest rela-
tive position A is selected as the indicator evaluation result, which is expressed by:

where o is the fuzzy operator.
The commonly used fuzzy operators include the main factor outstanding type, the fully 
constrained type and the weighted-average type. The weighted-average fuzzy operator is 
appropriate to the health assessment of major equipment because it can calculate the con-
tribution to the evaluation target according to the weight of each evaluation index, and can 
comprehensively balance the impact of different indicators. When using a weighted-average 
fuzzy operator, the element mj in the evaluation result vector M is calculated as:

3.3 Variable weight theory
Due to the complex system design of major equipment and the large numbers of key indi-
cators affecting equipment health, each key indicator is only assigned a very small weight. 
As a result, the overall impact of each indicator on the equipment is limited, meaning that 
although the equipment may be abnormal or even broken, the health grading retains an illu-
sion of good health. Apparently, it is difficult to apply such a synthetic evaluation result to 
the actual project. The comprehensive variable weighting theory can reflect the equilibrium 
of various elements and states in integrated decisions. The physical meaning of the indica-
tor weight reflects the degree of attention paid to the indicator during the equipment health 
assessment. In fact, when the equipment indicator is only slightly degraded, it will not signifi-
cantly improve the assessor’s attention to the index. Only if the index has a significant degree 
of degradation, such as an indicator’s color changing to yellow or red, will the assessor’s atten-
tion be rapidly raised, which means the weight of the index increases. Similarly, there is no 
need to change the weight for non-critical indicators, because of the limited impact on equip-
ment of their serious deterioration.
In application, first, it is necessary to select the index that needs to change the variable 
weight, according to the influence of the indicator on equipment following serious dete-
rioration. Then, calculate the evaluation vector of each index according to the principle of 
maximum membership before calculating the synthetic evaluation result; multiply a given 
coefficient Kω according to the evaluation of red or yellow status, where Kω is proportional 
to the total number of indicators n, the degree of indicator deterioration m, and the extent 
of impact on overall assessment results Km under this degree of deterioration. Normalize the 
newly obtained indicator after the weighting is adjusted, and update the weights in Equa-
tion 10 to obtain the new equipment health condition after variable weighting:

3.4 Evaluation result
Through fuzzy synthetic evaluation, the fuzzy vectors of equipment health condition can be 
obtained. In order to get a clear evaluation conclusion, this paper adopts a method of calculat-
ing evaluation results using the fuzzy vector and standard vector closeness of each clear state.
The clear standard vectors for selecting green, white, yellow and red are [1, 0, 0, 0], [0 1 0 0], 
[0 0 1 0], [0 0 0 1]. The Euclidean distance approach method is applied to the approximation

4 HEALTH CONDITION EVALUATION OF A NUCLEAR ISLAND MAIN PUMP
The main pump is the power source for a nuclear island primary circuit flow and the heart of 
the nuclear island. The main pump health condition is crucial to keeping the nuclear power 
plant running steadily and safely. Therefore, it is necessary to periodically evaluate the health 
state of the main pump and ensure its reliable operation. At present, the main pumps of 
nuclear power units in China are almost all shaft seal pumps, meaning the pump shaft seal 
system serves as a pressure boundary of the primary circuit. Safe and reliable operation is an 
important guarantee of the nuclear safety of nuclear power plants. In this paper, the health 
assessment of the main pump shaft seal system is taken as an example to illustrate the ration-
ality of synthetic evaluation.
Figure 3 shows the shaft seal system structure, which is composed of three shaft seal sys-
tems. Through analysis of fault modes and fault phenomena, the main evaluation indicators 
of the main shaft seal system are obtained, as shown in Figure 4.
The evaluation model for each monitoring task is established according to the membership 
function model and parameter selection method described in Section 2.2: the relevant model 
parameters are shown in Table 1.
In order to establish the evaluation model according to the indicator weight described in 
Section 2.1, this article takes the weight vector of each indicator W = [0.3, 0.3, 0.1, 0.2, 0.1], 
and selects nuclear power plant main pump data from August 2017 for evaluation. The cor-
responding index data are the worst values during the statistical period, and the evaluation 
vector results for each monitoring task are calculated as:

According to the operational requirements and equipment characteristics, indicators I01 and 
I02 are selected as key indicators, and the others are non-key indicators. Because I01 and I02 
indicators have not deteriorated severely, there is no need to calculate the variable weight coef-
ficients. The synthetic evaluation results of the shaft seal system calculated via Equation 9 are:
 
W
[
]
οR = [
ο
 
(15)
On the basis of the resulting fuzzy vectors, the lattice closeness of the remaining states’ color 
standard vectors is calculated. The lattice closeness of the result vector to the standard vector 
of green, white, yellow and red states are 0.85, 0.8, 0.69 and 0.69, respectively. This result state 
is closest to the green state, followed by the white state. This means the color of the device is 
determined as green, but engineers still need to pay more attention to the equipment param-
eters, especially the change of shaft seal injection flow and the #1 shaft seal leakage changes.
If the flow of #1 shaft seal seriously deteriorates to 800 L/h or more, the evaluation result 
of M01 becomes yellow at this time and the other parameters are unchanged. If the indicator 
weight remains, the synthetic evaluation result will turn to [0.362 0.338 0.3 0]. According to 
the European proximity method, the synthetic evaluation state of the shaft seal system is still 
green, which obviously does not match the practical situation. Therefore, it is necessary to 
change the weight of the key indicators when they deteriorate, as per Section 2.3. If the vari-
able coefficient is taken as kω = 8, the subsequent results with variable weight evaluation are 
[0.117 0.109 0.774 0]. According to the European approach method, the synthetic evaluation

the health condition assessment of major equipment in nuclear power plants, this paper

ABSTRACT: Aiming at the problem that the current neutral grounding decision method 
lacks quantitative measurement of electric shock risk, this paper proposes an optimization 
decision method. Firstly, according to the influence factor of the neutral grounding method, 
the decision target set of electric shock risk, over voltage risk, life cycle cost and reliability is 
constructed. Secondly, based on minimizing the inconsistency between each scheme and deci-
sion makers, the decision problem is transformed into the linear programming problem, and 
the weights of each target are obtained. Then, use the weighted Euclidean distance to rank the 
neutral grounding schemes. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is verified by a practical 
example. The method, which combined the influence of decision makers, relevant standards 
and objective factors on the choice of neutral point grounding method, has strong practical 
significance.
1 INTRODUCTION
Reasonable neutral grounding method should balance the safety, economy and reliability 
of the distribution network. Selection decisions on the neutral grounding method have been 
studied in considerable literature. The weighting coefficient of the neutral grounding method 
is obtained by expert scoring method, and the largest weighted is selected as the best ground-
ing method (Fu et al. 2010). The corresponding function is established based on the influenc-
ing factors of the neutral grounding method, and establishing the neutral grounding method 
by the fuzzy principle (Gan et al. 2013). Combining the reliability evaluation of the distribu-
tion network and the economic operation cost for safety factors, to calculate the cost of the 
distribution network under different neutral grounding modes. And the reliability index is the 
constraint condition to achieve the decision (Lu et al. 2006). But, the methods mentioned in 
do not consider the corresponding standards or specifications, so the results obtained may 
conflict with the standards. And they neglected the impact of different neutral grounding 
methods on personal safety when constructing the index evaluation system.
Based on the multi-dimensional preference linear programming analysis method, this 
paper proposes an optimization decision method for the neutral grounding method. Firstly, 
it build the four goals of personal electric shock risk, over voltage risk, life cycle cost and reli-
ability; Secondly, aiming at the minimum degree of inconsistency between each program and 
decision makers, transforming the decision problem into the linear programming problem. 
Thirdly, using the weighted Euclidean distance to rank the neutral grounding schemes, and 
the optimal neutral grounding method is obtained. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is 
verified by an example.

2 PERSONAL ELECTRICAL SHOCK RISK ASSESSMENT INDICATORS
Due to the grounding fault current of the large current grounding system is so large and the 
duration is short, while the grounding fault current of the small current grounding system is 
small and has a long duration, it is necessary to combine both of them to measure the risk of 
personal electric shock in different grounding methods.

It can be known from equation (1–2) that the ground faults in different neutral grounding 
modes corresponds to a circular danger zone where a step voltage electric shock may occur, 
and the size of the circular danger zone is determined by the fault current and the fault dura-
tion. Defining personal electric shock risk φ is

3 DECISION MODEL DESIGN BASED ON LINMAP
Assume that the solution set of the multi-objective decision problem of the finite scheme is 
A = {A1, A2, … An}, the target set is B = {B1, B2, … Bm}, the attribute value of Ai for the target 
Bj is xij. Then the decision matrix is X = (xij)n × m. Normalize decision matrix X and the normal-
ized decision matrix is Y = (yij)n × m. Decision makers get ordered sets Λ by comparing pairs of

4 NEUTRAL GROUNDING METHOD DECISION TARGET SET
According to the principle that the evaluation indicators are as comprehensive as possible, 
the neutral point grounding decision target set is divided into safety indicators, reliability 
indicators and cost indicators.
The safety index comprehensively reflects the impact of different neutral grounding meth-
ods on system and personal safety. The cost indicator refers to the full life cycle cost of each 
neutral point grounding method. The reliability index reflects the adaptability of each neutral 
grounding method to the distribution network
4.1 Decision target calculation
4.1.1 Safety indicators
1. Personal risk of electric shock
The personal electric shock risk indicator (B1) considers the fault point current and the fault dura-
tion. Assuming that the single-phase ground fault current is evenly distributed the risk of per-
sonal electric shock under different neutral grounding modes can be obtained by equation (1–3).
Ungrounded system personal electric shock risk φ1 is computed:

4.1.3 Reliability index
The neutral grounding mode selection needs to meet the user’s requirements for reliable 
power supply, and its impact on the distribution network is mainly the line trip rate under the 
single-phase ground fault of the line. So, the reliability index (B4) can be measured by the line 
trip frequency caused by the single-phase ground fault. For the feeder i, the failure rate is λi, 
the probability that the fault is a single-phase ground fault is ηi, and the probability that the 
single-phase ground fault is a permanent fault is σi.

4.2 Decision process
Figure 3 is a flow chart of the neutral point grounding method decision based on the 
LINMAP method:
5 ANALYSIS OF SIMULATION RESULTS
The proposed method is applied to the modification of a city distribution network, select-
ing a substation to be transformed as the decision object. The basic information is shown in 
Table 1. The scheme of the neutral point transformation of the substation is as follows:
Scheme A1: adopt the neutral point ungrounding method, configure the corresponding 
line selection device, and the line selection accuracy rate shall not be lower than 80%;
Scheme A2: The neutral point is grounded by the arc suppression coil, and the correspond-
ing line selection device is configured. The ground fault current is compensated to within 
10 A, and the line selection accuracy is not less than 80%;
Scheme A3: Neutral point is grounded by small resistance, and small resistance is taken as 
10 Ω. Zero-sequence over-current protection is configured. The zero-sequence I segment of 
the feeder is set to 60 A, and the action time is 0.5 s. The zero-sequence of the feeder is set to 
25 A, and the action time is 1.0 s.
Scheme A4: The neutral point is grounded by a small resistor, and the small resistor is 16 
Ω. Zero-sequence over-current protection is configured. The zero-sequence I segment of the 
feeder is set to 60 A, and the action time is 0.5 s. The zero-sequence of the feeder is set to 
25 A, and the action time is 1.0 s.
Table 2 lists the basic parameters of the security indicators, reliability indicators, and eco-
nomic indicators used for calculation and analysis.

 That is to say, the arc suppression coil grounding scheme and the small 
resistance grounding scheme are superior to the ungrounded scheme, and the order of the arc sup-
pression coil grounding scheme and the small resistance grounding scheme cannot be determined.
Assume δ = 0.005, ωc = 0.05, then, the weighted vector ω = {0.05 0.05 0.05 0.85} and the

Then the weighted Euclidean distance of each scheme is: S1 = 0.97, S2 = 0.013, S3 = 0.16, S4 = 0.13.

,  then the scheme A2 is the best way to use 
the arc suppression coil grounding method. Therefore, the substation only needs to re-verify 
the capacitor current to ensure that the ground fault current is compensated within 10 A. At the 
same time, configure the appropriate line selection device.
6 CONCLUSION
Neutral grounding method decision affects the safety, economy and reliability of the distribu-
tion system and it is a multi-objective decision-making problem of limited scheme. Aiming at 
the problem that the current neutral grounding decision method lacks quantitative measurement 
of electric shock risk, this paper proposes an optimization decision method for neutral point 
grounding in distribution network considering the risk of electric shock. The method minimizes 
the inconsistency between each scheme and the decision makers’ preferences, combines the influ-
ence of decision makers, relevant standards and objective factors on decision-making, and trans-
forms decision-making problems into linear programming problems. The target set structure 
covers personal electric shock risk, over voltage risk, life cycle cost and reliability, which compre-
hensively reflects the influence of neutral grounding method on the power distribution system, 
and the effectiveness of the proposed method, is verified by a practical example.

dependent on the ability of its electrodes to avoid fracture failure brought by de/litigation 
during charging/discharging cycles. In this paper we study the effect of film thickness, on 
the formation of crack patterns systematically. Applying the Mixed-mode Cohesive Zone 
interface model on the film/substrate system, a developed finite element numerical model has 
been carried out under plane strain condition, the whole fracture process and crack pattern 
of silicon film with different thickness is documented. With the growth of the Si film thick-
ness, the average crack spacing length is increase, which is in good qualitative agreement with 
former experimental results and other theoretical model. The results shown that two-dimen-
sional film-substrate system model can capture the essential features of cracking patterns of 
electrode materials and effectively characterize the relationship between crack pattern of thin 
film Lithium-Ion Battery electrodes and the thickness of Si thin film.

1 INTRODUCTION
In lithium-ion batteries, anode materials are one of the important factors that affect the 
capacity and performance of batteries. Silicon and lithium can form various alloys with high 
capacity (up to 4200 mAh/g) and low reactivity with electrolyte. Silicon is a promising anode

material for lithium-ion batteries because of its abundant reserves and low cost. However, in 
the charge- discharge process, the deintercalation lithium reaction of silicon will be accompa-
nied by large volume changes (∼300%), resulting in the destruction of the material structure, 
resulting in the separation of electrode materials, and then loss of electrical contact, resulting 
in rapid capacity degradation and deterioration of cycle performance. How to improve the 
cycling performance of silicon-based anode materials while obtaining high capacity is the 
research focus of silicon-based materials. In recent years, thin film materials have developed 
rapidly, with high specific capacity and good cycling performance, so silicon film electrode 
materials have also been paid attention to (Tarascon and Armand, 2001).
The two-dimensional film-substrate system model of thin film Lithium-Ion Battery elec-
trodes is conducted through microscopic observations of Si thin film electrodes and crack 
pattern analysis after electrochemical litigation and delithiation cycles tests. The relationship 
between crack pattern of thin film Lithium-Ion Battery electrodes and the thickness of Si thin 
film is investigated by adopting mixed-mode cohesive interface model. Because of the char-
acteristics of cohesion model, it can also simulate the whole process of crack initiation and 
propagation with loading.
2 THE MIXED-MODE COHESIVE INTERFACE MODEL
In the present investigation, a mixed-mode cohesive interface model developed by Turon 
(Turon et al., 2004, Turon et al., 2006) will be used to describe the damage evolution of 
interface. Figure 2 shows the scheme of the mixed-mode cohesive interface model within the 
space of both traction and separation displacements, and shows the relationship between 
the mixed-mode cohesive model with the pure normal separation cohesive model as well 
as with the pure shear separation cohesive model. Referring to Figure 2, the both triangle

3 THEORETICAL MODEL OF CRACK PATTERN
In order to simplify the problem, a square pattern electrode with length of acr and height of h 
is shown in Figure 3. On delithiation, the Si film undergoes a tensile stress of σ Y
σ Si.  However, 
the Si film cannot yield or fracture freely because of the constrain from the substrate and the 
friction at the Si film/substrate interface τ cr
int.  According to the force balance (Li et al., 2011) 
of the Si film:

4 FINITE ELEMENT MODEL
Finite element method (FEM) is used in numerical simulations for crack pattern. The 2D 
finite element model and finite element mesh are shown in Figure 4. The mixed-mode cohe-
sive interface model was used to describe the interface. The plain strain element (CPE4) was 
adopted in Si film and substrate which constitutive relation is elastic. The cohesive element 
COH2D4 was adopted in interface. The under surface of substrate is fixed.
As shown in Figure 5, the width of continuous Si segment is the crack line spacing. The 
number of interfaces between Si segments with complete failure is called the number of 
cracks.
5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
The finite element simulation results of crack patterns of Si films with different thicknesses 
were shown in Figure 6. During the calculation, the thickness of Si film (h) is changed form 1 
to 5 με, whereas the substrate thickness (H = 5 με) remains unchanged. As shown in Figure 6, 
from top to bottom, the crack pattern simulation results of h/H = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1 are 
given respectively. It can be seen that as the thickness of the Si film decreases, more and more 
islands are formed and the crack spacing (island width) becomes smaller and smaller. This is 
consistent with experimental phenomena.
The quantitative relationship between the number of cracks and the thickness of Si film 
was shown in Figure 7. With the increase of thickness of Si film, the number of cracks 
decreases gradually, which means that the average crack spacing (island width) increases.
As shown in Figure 8, the comparison between the simulation results of the average 
crack spacing and that predicted by formula (4) for Si films with different thickness after 
fragmentation was given. The formula (4) shows the linear relationship between the aver-
age crack spacing and the thickness of Si film. It can be seen that the simulation results 
are in good agreement with the formula derivation and the linear relationship observed 
experimentally.

6 CONCLUSIONS
The two-dimensional film-substrate system model of thin film Lithium-Ion Battery elec-
trodes is conducted through microscopic observations of Si thin film electrodes and crack 
pattern analysis after electrochemical lithiation and delithiation cycles tests. The relationship 
between crack pattern of thin film Lithium-Ion Battery electrodes and the thickness of Si 
thin film is investigated by adopting mixed-mode cohesive interface model. With the increase 
of thickness of Si film, the average crack spacing increases. There is a linear relationship 
between the thickness of Si film and the average crack length. The present results shown that 
two-dimensional film-substrate system model can capture the essential features of cracking 
patterns of electrode materials and effectively characterize the relationship between crack 
pattern of thin film Lithium-Ion Battery electrodes and the thickness of Si thin film.

1 INTRODUCTION
Electric energy has the advantages of being clean, safe and convenient. Through directly con-
suming electric energy and large-scale centralized conversion, it can increase fuel using effi-
ciency and reduce pollutant emissions, to improve the terminal energy structure and promote 
environmental protection (Han 2018). Presently, energy saving and emission reduction issues 
has been prioritized to national strategic plan. The electric energy substitution included in 
the plan, has become a research frontier of energy conservation and environmental protec-
tion as a major measure to realize energy strategy transformation.
The State Grid Corporation is also promoting the implementation of electric drainage and 
irrigation in an all-round way. Many irrigation and drainage areas have built platform trans-
formers to provide electric power for irrigation and drainage equipment. However, due to the 
wide range of drainage and irrigation areas and strong seasonal characteristics, the current 
average annual utilization rate of platform transformers is low, resulting to poor quality of 
electric energy. Therefore, it is imperative to optimize the power grid for platform transform-
ers to realize the prosperous development of electric energy substitution.
2  RESEARCH STATUS OF AGRICULTURAL ELECTRIC IRRIGATION 
AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING
In order to reduce the low utilization efficiency and serious pollutant emission caused by 
direct consumption of fossil fuels, many countries have applied electromechanical technology 
to agricultural drainage and irrigation projects. For instance, Holland, Japan and the United 
States and other countries are developing rapidly in this respect (Cheng 2005).
In Dutch, low-lying drainage problems are very prominent. Agricultural drainage and 
irrigation pumping stations are characterized by low head and large flow. The Netherlands 

156
Emotton drainage station has a maximum head of 2.3 m, a single flow of 37.5 m3/s and the 
total drainage capacity of 150 m3/s. In recent years, Japan has built a large number of drain-
age pumping stations for farmland irrigation and water logging problems. A total of 6 tubu-
lar pumps with a diameter of 4.2 m were installed at the New River Estuary Pump Station. 
The head is 2.6 m and the flow rate of a single pump is 40 m3/s. Foreign agricultural electric 
drainage and irrigation projects are characterized by advanced technology, equipment, excel-
lent engineering quality and high degree of automated operation. They also pay attention to 
the maintenance and update of electromechanical engineering equipment in time.
In China, the electromechanical drainage and irrigation industry have developed rapidly 
recently. In 2016, the State Development and Reform Commission and other eight ministries 
jointly issued the “Guiding Opinions on Promoting Electric Energy Replacement”. This clearly 
pointed out that it is necessary to speed up power supply of pumping station combining with 
the construction of high-standard farmland and the promotion of agricultural water-saving 
irrigation (NDRC 2016). In Gansu Province, the electricity price of agricultural drainage 
and irrigation is designed to guide the application of electric drainage and irrigation system 
(Zhang 2011). The Chinese Academy of Electrical Sciences has designed an adaptive load 
distribution transformer which can realize voltage tap-changer adjustment and automatic 
switching of rated capacity operation mode according to the actual situation of system volt-
age and load without cutting off load (Wang et al. 2014). Nanjing Nari Group are also devel-
oping an integral distribution transformer and power quality control equipment to simplify 
the whole platform structure and facilitates installation.
3  CONCEPT AND SIGNIFICANCE OF AGRICULTURAL ELECTRIC 
DRAINAGE AND IRRIGATION
3.1 Concept and significance of electric energy substitution
Electric energy substitution refers to the use of electric energy to replace the energy consump-
tion mode of coal and oil burning in the terminal energy consumption link. Electric energy 
substitution is of great significance for promoting the energy consumption revolution, imple-
menting the national clean energy strategy. From the perspective of drainage and irrigation, 
promoting the “Guiding Opinions on Promoting Electric Energy Substitution”, is to speed up 
the power supply of pumping station in an all-round way as well as building an efficient and 
energy-saving agricultural electric drainage and irrigation system.
3.2 Concept and significance of agricultural electric irrigation and drainage system
Drainage and irrigation project refer to the engineering and technical measures to use power 
machinery to drive water pump, drain and then irrigate the field. The electromechanical irriga-
tion and drainage project applied to farmland irrigation is called agricultural electric irriga-
tion and drainage. The agricultural irrigation and drainage project plays an irreplaceable role 
in improving agricultural production conditions, building stable and high-yield farmland and 
solving high water supply demands. The in-field project application of agricultural power irri-
gation and drainage mainly involves advanced water-saving irrigation methods such as sprin-
kler irrigation and drip irrigation (Lan et al. 2010, Yuan et al. 2017, Zhu et al. 2018, Li et al. 
2018).
Sprinkler irrigation is shown in Figure 1. It makes use of pump pressure or natural water 
gravity to supply water to the field through pressure pipeline. Water is sprayed into the air 
through the nozzle to form fine water droplets, which are evenly sprayed on the farmland to 
provide necessary water requirements for normal growth of crops. The practice has proved 
that spraying has the advantages of increased production, water saving, labor saving, soil 
conservation, fertilizer retention, strong adaptability, easy mechanization and automation 
(Xu et al. 2018, Tang et al. 2018, Lu et al. 2018).
Microirrigation, as shown in Figure 2, is another new type of water-saving irrigation tech-
nology that can transport the water and nutrients required for crop growth with a small flow

rate according to crop water requirements, through a piping system and a special emitter 
installed on the final pipeline. Compared to traditional full-surface moist ground irrigation 
and sprinkler irrigation, micro-irrigation only wets part of the soil near the root zone of the 
crop with a small amount of water. Micro-irrigation makes it very convenient to apply water 
to the soil near each plant maintaining low water stress to meet crop growth needs.
4 EXISTING PROBLEMS AND OPTIMIZATION METHODS
Pumping stations can create a good environment for irrigation and drainage of farmland 
as well as playing a great role in ensuring the safety of grain production. It can promote the 
development of clean energy more effectively by optimizing the traditional drainage and 
irrigation pumping stations into the electromechanical systems.
4.1 Problems in agricultural electric drainage system
Adopting electric energy substitution and upgrading the traditional pumping station into an 
electric drainage and irrigation system is conducive to promote the energy revolution, but in 
the process of pumping station renovation, the following problems need to be solved.
1. Low power factor
The main load of drainage and irrigation pumping station comes from asynchronous motor, 
which has the characteristics of strong seasonality, large single motor capacity and relatively 
concentrated power consumption time. Because of its simple structure, low price, durability 
and high efficiency, asynchronous motors are widely used in small and medium pumping sta-
tions to drive pumps. However, when the motor is running, it needs to absorb a great deal of 
inductive reactive current from the grid. For drainage and irrigation pumping stations, the 
operation under low power factor not only increases the power supply and distribution loss, 
but also probably be fined by the power supply department so that the economic and social 
benefits cannot be brought into full play. Therefore, the reactive power compensation for the 
motor can greatly reduce the line voltage, power loss, and improve economic and social benefits 
(Dai, Hu 2009).

158
2. Large change of power load rate
Agricultural electricity, especially in the agricultural electric drainage system, relies more on 
seasons throughout the year. The power load is very low in the winter, while very high in the 
summer. For instance, when not pumping water, the transformer is only used for electricity 
consumption by villagers, with low load rate and high line loss rate. But in the busy agri-
cultural season, the load increases sharply resulting to an overload or even the transformer 
burned out. Therefore, forecasting the agricultural electricity drainage and irrigation load and 
making the power grid supply at high load rate is of great interest to improve the utilization 
efficiency (Yang, Cheng 2018).
4.2 Optimization research
1. Reactive power compensation technology
 Compensation methods
  Parallel capacitor banks are usually used to compensate the reactive power, which can be 
divided into two modes: local compensation and centralized automatic compensation. Due 
to the use of automatic compensation devices and shunt circuit breakers to switch capacitor 
banks, the investment of centralized automatic compensation is large and it is generally not 
used in pumping stations. Local reactive power compensation has been widely used in pumping 
stations because it can synchronously switch with load and no special circuit breaker is needed.
 Compensation requirements
  According to the regulation of “Technical Guidelines for Voltage and Reactive Power in 
Power Systems”, the power factors of power users should meet the following requirements: 
The power factors of industrial users with high voltage power supply should be above 0.9; 
the power factor of other power users (whose power factor are above 100kVar) and large-
sized or medium-sized power irrigation and drainage stations should be more than 0.85. 
The necessary reactive power compensation devices should be installed if the above require-
ments are not met.
 Compensation capacity
  In order to prevent the self-excited overvoltage generated when the motor is out of opera-
tion, the compensation capacity is generally not greater than the no-load reactive power of 
the motor (Dai, Hu 2009), which can be calculated as formula (1):
 
Q =

(1)
  where: Qc = the capacity of the compensation capacitor, kVar; UN = rated voltage, kV; 
I0 = the no-load current of motor, A.
 For motors with large mechanical inertia of the motor for drain irrigation, the compensa-
tion capacity can be appropriately increased. The motor for drain irrigation is often pow-
ered off with the mechanical load of the pump. Therefore, the motor speed drops sharply 
and the self-excited overvoltage does not occur even if the compensation capacity is slightly 
larger than the no-load reactive load of the motor. For ordinary motors for irrigation and 
drainage, the compensation capacity can be determined by the following formula (2):
 
Qc

Q = (

(2)
 where: PN = the rated active power of the motor for drain irrigation, kW.
2. Analysis of power load
One of the characteristics of electric power production is that the power cannot be stored 
in large scale. The use of electricity for irrigation and drainage in agriculture has strong sea-
sonality. The change of power load within the day is relatively small, but during the month, 
especially during the quarter and year, the load changes greatly. Therefore, it is necessary 
to establish evaluation indexes and prediction method for the electrical load of agricultural 
electric drainage and irrigation systems.

159
 the indexes of power load
 Proper description and accurate estimation of load variation characteristics can be 
achieved through the analysis and calculation of some specific index parameters.
 Load rate
 The daily load rate and daily minimum load rate are used to describe the characteristics 
of daily load curve and to characterize the daily imbalance. Higher load rate is conducive 
to the economic operation of drainage and irrigation power system. For the agricultural 
electric irrigation and drainage system, the daily electric load change is small, so the daily 
load rate and the daily minimum load rate are generally small.
 Monthly load rate
 The monthly load rate is mainly related to electricity consumption structure, and seasonal 
changes. For the agricultural electric irrigation and drainage project, it accounts for a large 
proportion of rural electricity consumption, and thus has a greater impact on the monthly 
load rate. Since the irrigation and drainage project is seasonal, it will be affected by natural 
rainfall. And the natural rainfall is uneven. This imbalance also leads to the imbalance of 
electricity consumption in agricultural irrigation and drainage.
 Seasonal load rate
 The seasonal load rate, also known as the seasonal imbalance factor, reflects the seasonal 
variation of the power load. It is mainly affected by the seasonal configuration of the elec-
trical equipment, the annual overhaul of the equipment.
 Annual load rate
 The annual load rate is a comprehensive indicator. It is the ratio of annual average load to 
annual maximum load.
 The peak-to-valley difference
 The peak-to-valley difference is defined as the difference between the highest load and the 
lowest load. It directly reflects the peaking capacity required by the grid. For agricultural 
irrigation and drainage, seasonal changes have a great impact on peak-to-valley difference.
 Annual maximum load utilization hours
 Annual maximum load utilization hours are mainly used to measure the time utilization 
efficiency.
 Mathematical forecasting methods for power load
 Least squares
 The trend of load development can be predicted by the least squares method which is to 
express the development trend of the load sequence by equation and then use the trend 
equation to predict the future trend development. The least squares method is used to 
determine the development trend curve, and the sum of the squares of the deviations of 
the actual values  of the load sequence from the trend is required to be the smallest.
 Regression analysis
 The regression analysis method fits the past load records with random characteristics to 
obtain certain curve, and then extends the curve to the appropriate time to obtain the load 
prediction value at that time. The dependent variable of the regression equation is the 
power system load, and the independent variables are various factors that affect the load 
of the electric irrigation and drainage system, such as the pump station scale, the pump 
type, the operating conditions and the area size controlled by the pumping station.
 Fuzzy control method
 Power load forecasting is the use of past data to find out the law of load changes, and thus pre-
dict the trend and state of power load in the future. In actual forecasting, it is often carried out 
in the conditions that the historical load and the related environmental factors are not clear, so 
fuzzy mathematics provides an effective means for such problems. In recent years, more com-
bined methods have emerged, such as fuzzy regression, fuzzy clustering, fuzzy neural network.

5 CONCLUSION
The characteristics of agricultural electricity are different from those of industrial and residential 
electricity consumption. Agricultural electricity consumption is very uneven during the year, but 
relatively balanced during a single day. The seasonality is the most important characteristic of 
agricultural drainage load. It is determined by the seasonality of agricultural production.
Finding the existing problems, considering various factors like project scale, pump type, 
drainage area and drainage operation conditions, analyzing the characteristics of agricultural 
irrigation and drainage systems and establishing electric load characteristic, only in these 
ways, can we build a cleaner and more efficient agricultural irrigation and drainage project, 
and promote the benign development of electric energy substitution.

Beijing, China
ABSTRACT: Knowledge of design rationale provides support for design reuse, innova-
tive design, collaborative design and other design behaviors. It is difficult to guarantee the 
accuracy and universality of design knowledge in a single instance of design rationale, and 
it is difficult for designers to reuse the design knowledge directly. This paper proposes a 
design rationale knowledge-discovery method based on frequent-pattern mining. In order to 
facilitate the mining of frequent patterns from a fine-grained design rationale model, we first 
transform it into a label graph, then extract the frequent patterns from the label graph, and 
then transform these into a design rationale model. Then, through the design rationale model 
fragment integrity detection and inference method, the extracted design rationale model 
structure is perfected as a complete design rationale model fragment. Finally, the validity of 
this method is illustrated by way of an example of design rationale models for an automatic 
marking machine.

1 INTRODUCTION
According to modern design theory, design is a creative activity based on knowledge. The 
acquisition and application of new knowledge is the core of design, and is of great significance. 
Design rationale is an explicit expression of the systematic knowledge of the design process. The 
purpose of research into the acquisition, recording and modeling of design rationale knowl-
edge is to realize the reuse of design rationality. Design rationale knowledge supports design 
reuse, innovative design, collaborative design and other design activities. Currently, the reuse 
of design rationality is mainly supported by design rationale retrieval and model processing.
DRed (Bracewell et al., 2004, 2009) builds a design rationale model node index through 
keywords. Based on the user entering the keywords and the semantic retrieval of their syno-
nyms, the results are returned to the user after sorting. In addition, DRed realizes tunnel link-
ing, which supports the retrieval of associated nodes in different charts. Hong-wei Wang and 
colleagues improved the original retrieval method of DRed and proposed a structure-based 
design rationale retrieval method (Wang et al., 2012). This method makes use of implicit struc-
tural relations in the DRed model, the designer’s design situation information, and semantic 
information in the design node to realize design rationale retrieval. Luye Li and colleagues put 
forward the expression method of rationale design based on ontology, and a retrieval method 
based on ontology: keywords retrieval, natural language retrieval and retrieval based on design 
rationale record (Li et al., 2013a, 2013b). The Issue, Solution and Artifact Layer (ISAL) model 
(Liang et al., 2010) provides users with a series of interactive interfaces for design rationale 
retrieval. This approach enables users to perform multiple types of retrieval and displays the 
details of the problem layer, solution layer and product layer through the display interface. 
With more and more comprehensive and detailed knowledge of design rationality model 

162
description, the design rationality model becomes bigger and bigger. This large model makes 
it difficult for users to browse and retrieve, and to find the design knowledge they need accu-
rately and quickly. Based on the knowledge reasoning of Web Ontology Language (OWL) 
description logic, Hu and colleagues (Hu, 2013; Jing et al., 2013) realized the segmentation 
and extraction of the design context of a fine-grained design rationality model. This method 
encapsulates and expresses the knowledge of design rationality in design rationality segments. 
Aiming at a design rationality model driven by intention, Shi-kai Jing and colleagues pro-
posed a semantically based extraction method for design rationality fragments (Jing et al., 
2014). It is difficult for designers to directly reuse design knowledge because the accuracy 
and universality of design knowledge in a single design rationale model is difficult to guar-
antee. In response to these challenges, we propose a design rationale knowledge-discovery 
method based on frequent-pattern mining. The basic idea is that a design knowledge or model 
mechanism with poor accuracy and universality is a small-probability event in a large number 
of design rationale model cases. In order to facilitate the mining of frequent patterns from 
fine-grained design rationale models, this paper first converts them into labeled graphs, then 
excavates the frequent patterns from the labeled graphs, and finally converts them into design 
rationale models. The ontology-based design rationality model is composed of multiple design 
fragments, combined according to certain logic. Each design rationality fragment describes a 
relatively complete design task. The frequently discovered design rationale model structure 
is often not a complete design fragment. In this paper, the structure of the excavated design 
rationality model is improved to form a complete design rationality model fragment.
2  DESIGN RATIONALE MODEL AND MAPPING MECHANISM 
OF A LABEL GRAPH
The fine-grained design rationale model mainly consists of the relationship between nodes. 
A label graph consists of vertices and edges. Mapping mechanism for fine-grained design 
rationale model into label the vertices in the graph, nodes in a fine-grained design rationale 
models of relationship between nodes into label the edges in the graph, at the same time gen-
erate model mapping table used to explain the excavated frequent subgraphs. Figure 1 shows 
a typical example of a fine-grained design rationale model, and Figure 2 shows the model’s 
conversion into a label graph. Table 1 is the relational mapping table associated with this 
conversion. The standard code of a graph is a formal description of it. It is possible to deter-
mine whether a graph is isomorphic by inspecting this standardized coding. In this paper, 
the Depth-First Search (DFS) (Yan & Han, 2002) algorithm is used to realize the standard-
ized encoding of the graph.

3  INCREMENTAL FREQUENT-PATTERN MINING BASED 
ON DFS ENCODING
The label graph in this paper is transformed from the fine-grained design rationale model, 
which has the structural characteristics of the design rationale model. This label graph con-
tains only a small number of rings.
For frequent-pattern mining of labeled graphs with a small number of rings, Li et al. (2007) 
proposed a mining algorithm that first mined frequent subtrees and then extended to frequent 
subgraphs. The algorithm selects a frequent edge as the initial node, and then expands the fre-
quent subtree by adding frequent edges. The frequent inner edges of the subtrees are selected 
from frequent edge sets to produce frequent subtrees. The algorithm is shown in Figure 3.
The growth-type frequent-pattern mining algorithm based on DFS encoding mainly con-
sists of three parts: the first manages the atlas, extracts necessary information, and generates

frequent edge sets; the second generates frequent subtrees on the basis of frequent edge sets; 
the third extends the frequent subtree to the frequent subgraph.
The modification of the original algorithm in this paper is mainly reflected in that the 
infrequent edge set (H) is output through traversal and sorted according to the degree of 
support. Infrequent edge sets are important for the extension of typical design knowledge 
fragments. The inverse of the mined frequent subgraph needs to be mapped to the frequent 
design rationale model according to the mapping table.
4  DESIGN RATIONALE MODEL FREQUENT-PATTERN INTEGRITY 
DETECTION AND INFERENCE
The frequent structure of the design rationale model, which is mined by a growth-type 
frequent pattern based on DFS encoding, is a frequent pattern in the mathematical sense, 
regardless of its semantic constraints. Design rationale models generated directly from fre-
quent subgraphs by inverse mapping are often only the combination of several nodes and 
their relations, and cannot represent complete design knowledge. Therefore, there is a need 
to excavate the design of the rationale structure of frequent integrity testing and reasoning, 
according to certain rules, to expand and tailor, to express an independent relatively complete 
design knowledge, and to ensure the integrity of its semantic level.
We divide the excavated design rationale frequent structure into three types: intention 
analysis fragments, intention realization fragments and scheme evaluation fragments. 
These three types of structural fragments correspond to three types of design knowl-
edge mined from fine-grained design rationale models. The intention analysis fragment 
describes how the designer decomposes an abstract initial intention into several relatively 
independent sub-intentions. The intention realization fragment describes the designer’s 
proposal for multiple possible design schemes for the design element intention, as well as 
the evaluation and implementation process of the design scheme. The scheme evaluation 
fragment considers the design basis for a given design scheme, and gathers its positive or 
negative aspects.
The design intention fragment excavated by the mining algorithm must include the initial 
design intention node and the sub-intention node. If the frequent patterns mined by a mining 
algorithm have initial intention nodes and sub-intention nodes, the integrity detection and 
inference of intention analysis fragments are carried out. If the frequent patterns mined by 
the mining algorithm contain a design intention node and at least one design scheme node, 
it can be extended by inference to complete the intention realization fragment. If the main 
structure of a frequent pattern is the design scheme or design decision node and its related 
design basis, it can be treated as a scheme evaluation fragment.
5 APPLICATION EXAMPLES
Taking the design rationale model for an automated marking machine as an example, this 
paper explains the design rationale knowledge-discovery method based on frequent-pattern 
mining proposed in this paper. First of all, we construct ten different models to describe the 
knowledge of the marking machine design rationale; Figure 4 shows one example.
After building multiple design rationale models, we transform them into label graphs 
and build relational mapping tables. All the label graphs converted from the marking 
machine design rationale model are imported into the graph set, and then multiple frequent 
subgraphs are mined, using a growth-type frequent-subgraph mining algorithm based on 
DFS encoding. Three representative frequent subgraphs were selected from multiple fre-
quent subgraphs, as shown in Figure 5 (a1, a2 and a3). Frequent-pattern integrity detection 
and inference are carried out for the frequent subgraphs to generate relatively independent 
and complete fragments of the design rationale model, also as shown in Figure 5 (b1, b2 
and b3).

6 CONCLUSION AND PROSPECTS FOR ADAPTATION
Aiming at the problem that the accuracy and reliability of design knowledge are difficult to 
guarantee in a single design rationale model example, this paper proposes a design rationale 
knowledge-discovery method based on frequent-pattern mining. In this paper, the design 
rationale model is transformed into a label graph, and the frequent patterns are found from 
the label graph set transformed by multiple design rationale models, through a growth-type 
frequent-subgraph mining algorithm based on DFS. In this paper, three kinds of design 
rationale knowledge fragments and their integrity detection and inference methods are pro-
posed to realize the inverse mapping and interpretation of frequent subgraphs. Finally, the 
validity of this method is illustrated by its application to the design rationale model for a 
marking machine.

Transfer alignment of large misalignment angles with a Quaternion 
algorithm combining Strong Tracking and Cubature Kalman 
Filtering (QSTCKF)
K. Liu, L. Yan, Z.G. Zhu & Y. Zhao
Beijing Institute of Aerospace Control Device, Beijing, China
ABSTRACT: Transfer alignment is usually applied to weapon systems that need a rapid 
launch and complex external environment. In actual conditions, the misalignment angles 
are usually not small and the error model cannot be processed simply by linear filtering for 
large misalignment angles. In this paper, a large misalignment angle error model based on the 
multiplicative quaternion is derived, and a quaternion strong-tracking fifth-order cubature 
Kalman filter is proposed. To keep the quaternion’s norm unchanged during the filtering 
process, a quadratic Padé approximation method is used in the quaternion iterative decoding 
process. The adaptive fading factor from a strong tracking filter is added to the time update 
and measurement update equations from the fifth-order quaternion cubature Kalman filter; 
thus, the gain matrix can be adaptively adjusted, and the filtering divergence can be effec-
tively prevented. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can solve the problem 
of transfer alignment for large misalignment angles, and the proposed algorithm can improve 
the transfer alignment accuracy and rate of convergence in large misalignment angle cases.
Keywords: large misalignment, transfer alignment, strong tracking filter, fifth-order cuba-
ture Kalman filter
1 INTRODUCTION
Initial alignment is a key link before an inertial device enters navigation. It can be said that 
the accuracy of initial alignment determines the final navigation accuracy. Conventional ini-
tial alignment methods include the compass loop method and optimal filtering method, but 
the compass loop method utilizing the compass method requires that the vehicle is under 
static conditions. The second method utilizes modern control theory to estimate the mis-
alignment angles between the on-board Master Inertial Navigation System (MINS) and the 
low-accuracy Strapdown INS (SINS) of weapon systems.
It is impossible to guarantee that the initial misalignment angle is small when transfer 
alignment actually takes place. When the filtering algorithm adopts an Extended Kalman 
Filtering (EKF) algorithm, the EKF algorithm only provides a first-order approximation 
to the nonlinear object. When the system is highly nonlinear, the EKF algorithm will cause 
a large truncation error, resulting in filtering divergence (Forbes, 2010). Unscented Kalman 
Filtering (UKF) can obtain higher accuracy than EKF (Chang et al., 2013), but for nonlinear 
systems with higher dimensions, a covariant non-positive definite situation easily occurs. If 
UKF is adopted, it will cause filtering divergence and affect filtering accuracy. The Particle 
Filter (PF) based on a Monte Carlo sampling strategy requires a large amount of calculation, 
which leads to a time delay and particle degradation. Based on third-order spherical radial 
cubature rules, Cubature Kalman Filtering (CKF) is proposed (Arasaratnam & Haykin, 
2009). Although the estimation speed is improved, the estimation accuracy is lower than PF.
In the literature (Sun & Tang, 2012; Gao et al., 2011, Guo et al., 2017), an error model based 
on large azimuth misalignment angles is proposed, but the horizontal misalignment angle is 

168
still assumed to be small. Using quaternions instead of attitude angle can solve the situation of 
level misalignment angle for a small angle. However, quaternions are rotation vectors and can-
not be directly involved in the operation. Reference (Markley et al., 2007) based on Frononius 
norm calculating the weighted average of the quaternion. The algorithm obtains the weighted-
average quaternions by calculating the extreme value of the attitude-matrix cost function. 
Based on this method, Quaternion UKF (QUKF) (Zhou et al., 2011) and Quaternion CKF 
(QCKF) (Chen et al., 2013) algorithms are proposed and applied to transfer alignment. Li and 
Sun (2013) proposed the combination of CKF and a Strong Tracking Filter (STF) algorithm, 
which effectively improved the tracking accuracy and robustness of filtering.
In this paper, large misalignment angles of transfer alignment based on a quaternion error 
model are established. The algorithm uses Padé approximation in the recurrence formula 
that guarantees the norm of quaternion invariance. In addition, a strong tracking algorithm 
combined with a fifth-order CKF algorithm is proposed. The simulation results show that 
the proposed algorithm (QSTCKF) is superior to both QCKF and QUKF in convergence 
speed and accuracy.

where n stands for the navigation coordinate, n′ is the computational navigation coordinate, 
φx, φy and φz are the misalignment angles between n and n′.
However, when the misalignment angle is large, the above linear simplification cannot be 
made, and the nonlinear error model needs to be rederived. Based on the small misalignment 
angle model, the large misalignment angles based on the quaternion are derived.

2.3 Error model of the inertial device and installation
The errors of the SINS gyroscope and accelerometer are modeled, and the error of the trans-
fer alignment inertial device is a combination of constant error and Gaussian white noise, 
then the error model of the gyros is:

, 

(13)
where ∇s is the constant bias of accelerometers, ∇w is the output noise of the accelerometers.
When the MINS is installed on the carrier, there is an installation error between SINS and 
MINS. The installation error is unchanged, the quaternion of installation error is:
 
qm
s = 0  
(14)
2.4 State equation
Because the system noise of the quaternion cannot be directly added and subtracted, the 
process noise and measurement noise in the error model are extended to the state vector. 
According to Equations 7, 11, 12, 13 and 14, the system state vector can be written as:
 
x
x
x
w
k
q T
k
e T

T T

[(

where xq is the quaternion part of the state vector, and xe is the non-quaternion part of the 
state vector, respectively:

wk is the system noise vector, and is the zero mean Gaussian white noise, the variance is Qk; vk 
is the observed noise vector, and is the zero mean Gaussian white noise, and the variance is Rk.
2.5 Measurement equation
The matching method of transfer alignment is velocity matching and attitude quaternion 
matching. The velocity measurement is the difference of velocity between MINS and SINS; 
velocity of MINS should compensate the lever arm error. The velocity measurement is:
 
Z

n

V n′n
 
(15)
where V n′n  is the calculated velocity of SINS, Vn is the velocity of MINS and Vr
V n  is the error 
velocity of the lever arm effect.
The measurement of the attitude quaternion is:

between MINS and SINS and qn

According to the definition, the nonlinear measurement equation is established as

4 IMPROVED FIFTH-ORDER QCKF ALGORITHM
The CKF algorithm adopts the principle of spherical radial cubature, and the estimation 
accuracy is higher when the nonlinear model is established more accurately. However, the 
external environment of transfer alignment is relatively complex and the system model can-
not be very accurate, which will lead to a large estimation error when filtering. Therefore, 
the STF is combined with the fifth-order CKF algorithm in the delivery of transfer align-
ment; the elimination factor obtained from the calculation in STF is substituted into the time 
update and measurement update equations. In addition, a new strongly tracking fifth-order 
cubature Kalman filter (QSTCKF) algorithm is proposed. The new algorithm can adapt to 
the system with strong nonlinearity, and can also adapt to the complex and variable environ-
ment effectively. The specific algorithm for QSTCKF is applied as follows:
1. Calculate the cubature points of QSTCKF:

5 SIMULATION TEST AND ANALYSIS
To verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, a simulation experiment was carried out. In this 
simulation experiment, first, the motion trajectory of the carrier was established as a uniform 
linear motion and, in the process, the vehicle swing maneuver mode was rolled around the 
vertical axis of the carrier. Carrier of initial position for the east longitude 119°, latitude 
39°, the speed of the uniform is 5 m/s, affected by the waves of the sea and in the process of 
driving pitch, roll and yaw wave motion by sine wave simulation, because the time is short, a 
simplified treatment for real waves do, with only a sine wave simulation:

where θm, γm and ψm are the maximum values of attitude angle; θ0, γ0 and ψ0 are the initial 
angle; let θm = 7°, γm = 10°, ψm = 5°; θ0 = 10°, γ0 = 15°, ψ0 = 20°; ωθ = 2π/15 rad/s, ωγ = π/7 rad/s, 
ωψ = π/8 rad/s, ϕ0 = 30°.

It is assumed that there is no error in the output information of MINS during the align-
ment, and there is a large error in the accuracy of SINS. The assumption is that the gyro 
constant drift of SINS is 0.1°/h, the intensity of Gaussian white noise of the gyroscope is 
(0.01°/h)2, the accelerometer bias is 10−4 g and the intensity of Gaussian white noise is (10−4 g)2. 
The simulation time is 480 s. In comparison with QUKF and QCKF, the new QSTCKF fil-
tering algorithm simulation results are shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3.

It can be seen from the simulation diagrams that the newly proposed algorithm is superior 
to QUKF and QCKF in terms of convergence speed and convergence accuracy. The error 
curve of roll angle and pitch angle can be rapidly convergent within 40” by using fifth-order 
STCKF, and the yaw angle can be rapidly convergent within 5’.
6 CONCLUSION
The error equation based on the multiplicative quaternion is derived in detail. According to 
the system’s strong nonlinearity, the proposed algorithm combines a strong tracking algo-
rithm with the fifth-order CKF algorithm. The specific steps of the algorithm realization are 
derived in detail, which verifies the effectiveness of the algorithm. Meanwhile, QUKF and 
QCKF are compared and analyzed with QSTCKF.
Based on this research, we can derive the following conclusions: the error equation based 
on the quaternion avoids small-angle approximation and is no longer limited to the case of 
a small misalignment angle. The proposed algorithm combines a STF and fifth-order CKF. 
An adaptive fading factor is introduced into the calculation, adjusting the gain matrix in real 
time according to the residual, giving the filtering algorithm of the nonlinear system strong 
robustness. The simulation results show that under the condition of a complex peripheral 
environment, the proposed algorithm has strong adaptability, fast convergence speed and 
high convergence precision.

Overall satellite model composition research using Model-Based 
Systems Engineering (MBSE)
R.L. Wu, Z. Peng, X.H. Gao, Y.Q. Xia & H. Jiang
Institute of Telecommunication Satellite, China Academy of Space Technology, Beijing, China
ABSTRACT: Due to the increasing complexity of satellite systems, the disadvantages of 
the traditional Text-based System Engineering (TSE) method are becoming notable, such as 
non-unification of data sources, limited descriptive ability, development processes subject 
to breakpoint management, and so on. In this paper, Model-Based Systems Engineering 
(MBSE) has been used to solve the problems existing in present satellite development systems. 
An overall satellite model structure derived from MBSE has been generated according to the 
requirements analysis of different satellite development stages.
Keywords: satellite, MBSE, overall model
1 INTRODUCTION
Traditional satellite system development mainly relies on a variety of documents for overall 
design, manufacturing, testing and project management, that is, Text-based System Engineering 
(TSE) (Zhang et al., 2014). Often, these documents are developed separately by different staff 
within an organization, with specific disciplines responsible for different sections (Russell, 
2012). The design and manufacturing parameters are scattered among various documents in 
the TSE method, while some parameters exist in more than one document. Several documents 
are needed to finish one design or manufacturing activity. The management of projects based 
on TSE also relies on documents, that determines the projects development mainly depend on 
manually. With the increasing scale and complexity of satellite systems, the TSE method can 
no longer satisfy satellite design and manufacturing needs.
In recent years, Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) has become the focus of 
research and application of satellite system engineering. MBSE is the formal and standardized 
application of modeling methods in system engineering activities, which enables modeling 
methods to support system requirements in every development stage, such as design, analysis, 
verification and validation activities. These activities start from the conceptual design stage 
and continue through all life-cycle stages of product development progress (Han et al., 2014).
The MBSE method takes the model as the foundation of system description, and has to 
satisfy the needs of satellite design, manufacture and orbital operation. From the definition, 
there is no essential difference between the MBSE method and the TSE method in terms of 
basic theory and process. The difference is mainly in the form of design process management, 
work form and design result display. In the MBSE method, every activity can be described 
as a model instead of a document, and the parameters can be transmitted automatically on 
an appropriate platform. This means that as soon as all the parameters needed for a task 
are ready, the task leader will know that the task can be started without any command or 
reminder from others.
This paper proposes an innovative method based on the MBSE concept to support 
complex system characteristics for satellite design, simulation, integration, testing and 
in-orbit management. An MBSE-based structure for the overall satellite model and its 
method of implementation is created according to current satellite development processes.

2 REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS
Due to increasing complexity, the design, manufacture and management of satellites has become 
a set of collaborative tasks shared among multidisciplinary, distributed teams. The overall satel-
lite model should meet the requirements of the satellite’s life-cycle development, including all 
kinds of data and models for the different stages of the development. The satellite development 
process can be divided into three stages: design; Assembly, Integration and Testing (AIT); in-
orbit operation. Requirements analysis is carried out on the basis of these three stages.
2.1 Requirements analysis in the design stage
Overall satellite design, subsystem design and product design are carried out in the design stage:
a. The overall satellite design is the high-level design of the satellite system. User require-
ments are transformed into functions and performance parameters of systems, and sys-
tems are composed of several subsystems (Xu, 2003).
b. Subsystem design plays an important role in overall satellite design. The result of subsys-
tem design should satisfy the design index of the subsystem and be compatible with other 
subsystems’ functions, physics and program interfaces.
c. Product design is the basis of satellite system design. The product design results determine 
the final performance of the system.
Figure 1 shows the simplified data flow in the overall design process of the satellite. From 
the diagram, it can be determined that the model framework for the overall design stage 
should contain the following content:
a. All parameters required or generated during the overall design, subsystem design and 
product design phases that are needed to maintain the basic operation of the overall sys-
tem. The amount of data is large and the data flow direction is complicated. Optimized 
data management is very important for efficient operation of the system.
b. Satellite requirements analysis model based on user requirements; large system constraints 
have to be created, and subsystem indices are distributed by satellite requirements analysis.
c. Subsystem models, which are the main components of the overall design model. Sub-
system simulation analysis models (including a 3D model) are also needed, which can 
be further divided into a system requirements analysis model and subsystem simulation 
analysis model if necessary. Subsystem models need a lot of basic data and generate a lot 
of intermediate data while they are running.
2.2 Requirements analysis in the AIT stage
The AIT process is a vital phase in the progress of satellite development. Satellite assembly 
and testing are interspersed with each other throughout the AIT phase, and cannot be strictly 
segregated by development time or phase.
Figure 1. Simplified data flow of the overall satellite design process.

179
Satellite assembly includes the design of satellite assembly and its implementation. Satellite 
assembly design is the process of planning and promoting demands on satellite AIT require-
ments, and finally writing them into documents and drawings, according to requirements 
from system, subsystem, and overall integration tests. Satellite assembly implementation can 
be divided into component assembly, functional component assembly, cabin assembly and 
overall satellite assembly. The quality of satellite assembly will directly affect the satellite 
performance. According to statistics from the Russian Space Department, satellite assembly 
workload accounts for 35% of the total processing capacity of the satellite (Xu, 2003).
Satellite testing is a necessary part of satellite development. Through a comprehensive and 
systematic test of the satellite, the design faults and manufacturing technological defects of 
the satellite are fully exposed, and early failure detection of electronic components and/or 
lack of software are found to ensure the high quality of satellite products.
AIT is a stage of the satellite development process that involves interaction with physical 
models. The model construction involved in satellite assembly is shown in Figure 2:
a. An assembly design model that is an effective merger of structural design, thermal design 
and overall configuration can fully describe satellite assembly and integration. The model 
is the basis of the process design model, which can be directly used to guide workers to 
conduct assembly operation.
b. The assembly status data at various stages should be recorded, such as the grounding 
resistance of the products, the state of on-board plugs, and so on. The data not only 
records the status of the satellite assembly, but can also be compared with the design val-
ues, allowing assembly problems to be found in time, and could be used in assembly model 
updating.
Figure 3 shows the model composition and data flows for the testing of the subsystems 
and the overall satellite testing:
a. The subsystem or overall satellite test model (including the test program) can be con-
structed according to the simulation analysis model of each subsystem, which is built in 
the design phase. Several test models can be built if necessary.
b. A large amount of test data is produced at each stage, such as mechanical, thermal and 
electrical test data. All these data reflect the real performance of the satellite, and must be 
compared with the design index to confirm whether the satellite performance will meet the 
system requirements.
2.3 Requirements analysis in the in-orbit operation stage
During the in-orbit operation of the satellite, various engineering parameters of the satellite 
in orbit are transmitted through a Tracking Telemetry and Command (TT&C) subsystem. 
Instructions are sent to the satellite in order to control its attitude, orbit and working state.
Satellite in-orbit parameters reflect the true operating status of the satellite in orbit. The 
parameters can be compared with satellite design data to make sure that the satellite is

functioning normally, and can also be used in model updating for optimal satellite system 
design. Figure 4 represents the data flow directions between the in-orbit data and satellite 
model analysis data during the satellite’s in-orbit operational phase.
3 OVERALL SATELLITE MODEL COMPOSITION
From the requirements analysis outlined in the previous section, it can be seen that the overall 
satellite model is divided into two main parts: a basic database and a system construction 
model (Graignic et al., 2013), described in more detail below.
3.1 Basic database
To perform a simulation of a satellite system, engineers have to gather numerous data about 
the system they have to analyze. The basic database covers the data required and produced 
by the satellite development process at various stages of design, manufacture, testing and 
in-orbit operation. Figure  5  shows the high-level composition of the satellite database, 
including all the data needed or produced in the process of satellite development:
» Data needed in the design phase, such as user indices, large system constraints, subsystem 
indices, on-board products’ design and performance parameters, intermediate calculation 
values, and other related parameters necessary for subsystem design or overall design;
» Data produced in the AIT phase, such as assembly status data, test data and other process 
data;
» In-orbit data transmitted through the TT & C subsystem.
Each data item mentioned above exists uniquely and independently in the system with 
a specific identity, and can be used by any model in the overall satellite model system. 
Figure 3. Simplified satellite test model.
Figure 4. Interactions between satellite in-orbit data and satellite model analysis data.

181
Data identification and management methods for this database are very important for this 
system, because they can determine the efficiency of the system’s operation.
3.2 Satellite system construction model
According to the different application stages and application levels of the satellite model, the 
system architecture model can be divided into four levels in the MBSE method: requirements 
model, analysis model, functional model and physical model, as shown in Figure 6 (Estefan, 
2008). With the exception of the physical model, each level of the model can be further 
divided into several sublevels:
a. Requirements model: includes the satellite requirements analysis model and subsystem 
requirements analysis model, which are the top level of the entire system model. System 
and subsystem indices are carried out through the requirements model and are important 
parameters for the simulation analysis model.
b. Analysis model: includes each subsystem simulation model, which is the important method 
and basis for overall detailed design. To a certain extent, the analysis models form a virtual 
satellite system and describe how the satellite works and how it should perform ahead of 
its manufacture.
c. Functional model: includes the satellite assembly design model and the test model, which 
is the level at which the models are associated with real objects. The virtual model guides 
workers in how to assemble the products into a whole satellite and how to test the per-
formance of the satellite.
d. Physical model: refers to the real objects, and takes the single on-board product as the 
smallest unit, according to the design and manufacturing requirements of the whole sat-
ellite. Workers assemble the products and test the satellite performance according to the 
functional model, obtaining the real status data and real performance data, and then feed-
ing back the data to the model.
Figure 6 shows the relationship between the requirements model, analysis model, func-
tional model and physical model. The four levels are in a progressive structure, which can

meet the requirements of satellite life-cycle development, and each model level interacts with 
the basic database directly. Such a model architecture has the following advantages:
a. The unified data source ensures consistency of data and reduces errors arising through 
data transmission.
b. The unified data source makes the maintenance and management of the data easier.
c. Each subsystem model and each level model are managed in a real-time interactive plat-
form. Once all the parameters needed in a model are ready, the model can run automati-
cally and produce the analysis results, which feedback to the database. Any other model 
in the system that needs the results will know the parameters are ready as soon as the 
results are produced. Such spontaneous driving of the model fundamentally changes 
the serial development model based on text, and can effectively improve development 
efficiency.
d. It is conducive to the integration of the knowledge engineering management method and 
the foundation for future intelligent satellite manufacturing.
4 CONCLUSION
An overall satellite model composition has been proposed in this paper, based on an MBSE 
approach. The problems existing in the original TSE method (such as data sources not being 
unified, limited descriptive ability, and so on) are solved via the system’s operational mecha-
nisms. However, the design and management platform appropriate to satellite development 
must, in future, be chosen carefully to promote the application of this modeling system.

Review of propulsion subsystems for a high-orbit 
Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite
H.F. Zhang & L. Jian
Beijing Institute of Spacecraft System Engineering, Beijing, China
ABSTRACT: High-orbit satellites with larger antennae as loads require large station-keeping 
velocity increments and rational propulsion systems. We compared the bipropellant propulsion 
system, hybrid propulsion system and ion bipropellant system in terms of system weight, con-
figuration layout difficulty, and so on. The weight of the hybrid propulsion system is the lowest 
on the premise of the same velocity increment within a given weight range. Compared with the 
extant platform, the modification to a hybrid propulsion system is minor and the complexity 
is relatively low; plume effect and jet contamination of the arc-jet thruster are lower than oth-
ers, and the thrust and station-keeping efficiency of hybrid propulsion systems with an arc-jet 
thruster are higher. In conclusion, compared with other systems, the hybrid propulsion system 
can better meet the requirements of high-orbit satellites with large antennae.
Keywords: High-orbit SAR satellite, hybrid mode propulsion system, arc thruster, system 
weight, configuration layout and complexity, plume effect and jet
1 INTRODUCTION
The Geosynchronous-orbiting Synthetic-Aperture Radar (GEOSAR) satellite is totally new 
in China. As a satellite with large antennae, the weight is relatively high, beyond the carrying 
capacity of a regular satellite platform, leading to a high station-keeping velocity increment, 
which places high requirements on the design of the propulsion system. It is difficult for the 
traditional bipropellant propulsion system to meet the requirements of this satellite. This 
review compared three system solutions—the traditional bipropellant propulsion system, 
a hybrid propulsion system based on bipropellant and arc, and a traditional chemical and 
ion propulsion system—in terms of the system weight, system inheritance and complexity, 
thruster plume effect, thruster-specific impulse and efficiency of use.
2 COMPARISON OF SYSTEM WEIGHT
According to the demand characteristics of satellite payload and in-orbit velocity increments, the 
total weight of the propulsion subsystem is important for the realization of the overall mission.

Figure 2. Comparison of the total weights in the bipropellant + ion propulsion system and the hybrid-
mode propulsion system of a foreign communication satellite orbit and station-keeping mode for vari-
ous in-orbit velocity increments.
Taking an orbit design of a high-orbit satellite as an example, the satellite station-keeping veloc-
ity increment is 166.848 m/s. Based on this velocity increment and parameters for the propulsion 
system, we compared the weight requirement in a bipropellant propulsion system, ion bipropel-
lant system and hybrid propulsion system, and found that the total weight of the hybrid-mode 
propulsion system is smallest (Table 1) (Smith, Aadland et al., 1997; Smith, Roberts et al., 1997).
According to the scale of the satellite, the total weights in bipropellant, ion and hybrid pro-
pulsion systems were calculated under the different requirements of in-orbit velocity incre-
ments (Figure 1). It can be seen that there is an advantage in the hybrid propulsion system 
unless the in-orbit velocity increment of the satellite is very high and exceeds a certain limit.

185
Based on experience in the application of foreign communication satellite electric propul-
sion, the ion propulsion system can be only used in North-South Station-Keeping (NSSK)
because of the large volume and fixed installation position. Because of its small volume 
and convenient installation, an arc-jet thruster can be used for East-West Station-Keeping 
(EWSK) and NSSK. In Figure 2, there is a comparison of the total weights in the bipropel-
lant and ion propulsion system and the hybrid propulsion system of a foreign communica-
tion satellite orbit and station-keeping mode for various in-orbit velocity increments.
3 COMPARISON OF STRUCTURE LAYOUT AND SYSTEM COMPLEXITY
Compared with the Chinese DFH-4 communications satellite platform, the hybrid-mode 
propulsion system has a gas–liquid supply system consistent with the traditional bipropellant 
propulsion system. The orbit transform motor and thruster are changed accordingly, which 
are on the periphery of the satellite and have no effect on its internal layout. In addition, 
two arc thruster powers are added. Compared with the traditional bipropellant propulsion 
system, the hybrid propulsion system involves fewer changes, is simpler, and can be directly 
loaded into the load compartment.
The bipropellant and ion propulsion system requires more modification and requires 
reconfiguration of the ion propulsion system, including a storage supply system, thruster, 
ion thruster power supply and vector adjustment structure, which is incompatible with the 
traditional chemical propulsion system, requiring more internal space in the satellite and 
making the whole system more complicated. At present, the satellite is built on the DFH-4 
platform. The antenna takes one-third of the cabin space and the loaded elements are many 
and the weight is large. Therefore, there is no space in the cabin in which to place a storage 
and supply system. The specific configuration comparison is shown in Table 2 (Hotta et al., 
1998; Morgan & Meinhardt, 1999; Zubeet al., 2003).
Only the hybrid-mode propulsion system can meet the requirements of the entire satellite 
in the case of satellites using electric propulsion.
4 COMPARISON OF THRUSTER PLUME AND JET MATTER
According to the current design of various domestic thrusters, the diameter of the 10 N thruster 
nozzle is 40 mm and the plume divergence angle is 30°. For the ion thruster, the nozzle diameter 
is 200 mm and the plume divergence angle is 15°. The nozzle diameter of the arc thruster is 
12 mm and its plume divergence angle is 17°. All the parameters are listed in Table 3.
The mechanism of the arc thruster involves heating the decomposition products of mono-
propellant anhydrous hydrazine (N2H4), which will not pollute the antenna. The spray of the 
ion thruster spray is plasma, which cannot be completely neutralized and will attach to the 
antenna mesh surface causing huge influences on the antenna (Stechman et al., 2000; Wu 
et al., 2001; Krismer et al., 2003).

186
According to the analysis of the satellite plume and jet, the antenna can be protected from 
the plume only by using an arc thruster with a small nozzle diameter, a relatively small plume 
divergence angle and minimal spray contamination (Fisher & Meyer, 1998).
5 COMPARISON OF SYSTEM POSITION-RETENTION PERFORMANCE
In a satellite with large antennae, the in-orbit imaging task consumes a lot of power, the 
demand for heat dissipation is great and the mission takes a long time (loading work for 
0.5 hour, heat dissipation for one hour). It is necessary to reduce position-retention times and 
increase the retention cycle, while saving the propellant in the orbital position (Zube et al., 
1998).
The position-retention performance of the different thrusters is summarized in Table 4. 
The time and period of position retention are mostly determined by the magnitude and effi-
ciency of the thrust. When the thrust of the arc thruster is 130 mN/kW or more, the use 
efficiency is 0.9. When the thrust of a 10 N thruster is 10 N, the use efficiency is 0.88. When 
the thrust of the ion thruster is 26 mN/kW, the use efficiency is 0.7.
For the station-keeping system, the 10 N thruster of a bipropellant propulsion system can 
be used for a single operation of 0.5 hour, once every two weeks in the maintenance of the 
inclination and regression accuracy. The arc thruster of a hybrid propulsion system can be 
used in a single operation for four hours, once a week, and the ion propulsion system can be 
used in a single operation for two hours, twice a day.

Based on the demands of the satellite and a working mode of load on for 0.5 hour and heat 
dissipation charging for one hour, only the electric propulsion with fewer working times (high 
thrust power ratio) can be used. Therefore, for a LZ-1 satellite, electric propulsion is the best 
choice (Skelly & Kay, 1997; De Grys et al., 2005).
6 SUMMARY
In this review, we compared the system weight, structural layout, system complexity and thruster 
plume of the bipropellant propulsion system, hybrid propulsion system and bipropellant and 
ion propulsion system in high-orbit SAR satellites. Because the arc thruster can provide greater 
speed increments for the same weight, the configuration layout is simpler, the plume and jet 
pollution are smaller and the thrust and efficiency are higher, the hybrid propulsion system with 
an arc thruster is more suitable for satellites with large antenna loads in high orbit.

on customer demand in a processing-equipment Product–Service 
System (PSS)

Vision Measurement, Huaqiao University, Xiamen, China
ABSTRACT: Currently, market competition is intensifying and customer demand is 
diverse. The traditional ‘product and after-sales service’ mode can no longer adapt to latest 
market demands. In order to increase profits and enhance competitiveness, companies are 
linking products and services to customers as a single entity, the Product–Service System 
(PSS). In this paper, a conceptual framework for the design of a processing-equipment PSS 
(pe-PSS) is proposed. The main functions of the framework and design process are illus-
trated. Finally, some key enabling technologies are described in detail, that is, identification 
and analysis of customer demand, feature matching between customer demand and service 
technology, division of product and service modules, configuration design and optimization 
of the pe-PSS.
Keywords: customer demand, pe-PSS, framework, design
1 INTRODUCTION
Due to improvements in raw materials, labor costs and global environmental protection, 
competition in the manufacturing industry has intensified and profit margins have shrunk. 
Low value-added industrial products can no longer meet the requirements of manufactur-
ing enterprises and environmental development (Gaiardelli et al., 2014; Aurich et al., 2006; 
Cavalieri & Pezzotta, 2012). In the past, most companies simply sold material products, 
and this traditional business model has been unable to bring huge profits to enterprises. In 
order to achieve sustainable development, more and more enterprises are transforming from 
product manufacturers to product service providers. Based on customer demand, a series 
of customized services are provided to customers by enterprises. These value-added services 
include product operation, maintenance, upgrading, recycling, and so on.
In order to adapt to this strategic change, a new concept has been established—the 
Product–Service System (PSS). The idea is intended to provide customers with solutions, 
including products and services (Reim et al., 2015). With the continuous changes in market 
demand, customer requirements of processing equipment are becoming higher and higher. 
The processing equipment referred to here includes Computerized Numerical Control (CNC) 
machining equipment, such as CNC lathes, CNC milling machines, machining centers and so 
on. In addition, due to the professional, high-end precision and other characteristics of such 
processing equipment, there are high requirements around its design, use and maintenance. 
Typically, customers lack experience in the operation and maintenance of such processing 
equipment. The traditional model of ‘product and after-sales service’ cannot meet the cus-
tomer’s individual needs. To this end, processing equipment and related services are inte-
grated by product manufacturers or service providers, and the end-customer is provided with 
a processing-equipment Product–Service System (pe-PSS).

190
Configuration design is considered to be a key aspect of the development of a PSS. The 
aim is to provide a solution composed of material products and services based on customer 
demand. When the scheme is designed, it is necessary to maximize the profit of the company 
while satisfying the customer’s needs.
For a configuration design in pe-PSS, the performance, cost and other factors are mostly 
determined in the initial design phase. Once the scheme is determined, the performance and 
cost of the pe-PSS will not be controlled if a change occurs during system execution. There-
fore, one of the issues that current research institutes should pay attention to is how to design 
a low-cost pe-PSS based on customer demand. In this paper, a conceptual framework for 
product–service configuration in pe-PSSs is proposed.
2  FRAMEWORK OF A PROCESSING-EQUIPMENT 
PRODUCT–SERVICE SYSTEM
2.1 Framework
The conceptual framework of the pe-PSS configuration design implementation model is 
shown in Figure 1. The framework consists of three layers, that is, the key technology layer at 
the bottom, the application method layer in the middle and the system layer on the top. The 
key technology layer includes four supported technologies that ensure the application layer 
can run smoothly. In the middle application layer, some main functions of the framework are 
included, and the design flow of a configuration scheme of a pe-PSS is given. The system 
layer supports the data and information of the whole design framework, including user infor-
mation, a service module database, and a service process and resource database.
Figure 1. Configuration design framework for a pe-PSS.

191
2.2 Design process
In some cases, clearly understanding how a scheme of pe-PSS is designed, can help us iden-
tify some of the associated problems and difficulties. First of all, customer requirements are 
obtained through a Web terminal, and these requirements are often general. Therefore, it is 
necessary to identify, decompose and analyze the importance of these requirements, obtain-
ing an operational requirement unit. Then, many requirement units with different weights are 
mapped and the corresponding technical features are obtained. According to the technical 
characteristics of these solutions, the product module and the service module are divided 
according to the customer usage preference. Then, the initial scheme of pe-PSS configuration 
is obtained through the solution of these modules. In the end, whether the customer is satis-
fied with the scheme indicates whether or not the configuration is successful.
3 SUPPORTED KEY TECHNOLOGIES
In this section, some key enabling technologies are described in detail to ensure that the 
framework operates smoothly, that is, identification and analysis of customer demand, fea-
ture matching between customer demand and service technology, division of product and 
service modules, configuration design and optimization of the pe-PSS.
3.1 Identification and analysis of customer demand
Given that customer demand is often reflected in a customer’s production activities, ambigu-
ity can be high and difficult to identify. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the customer’s 
activities in different situations. Through deep understanding and analysis of customer activ-
ities, the needs of industrial products and services at different life-cycle stages are actively 
obtained. As shown in Figure 2, the fuzzy requirements of customers are refined into specific 
product requirements and corresponding service requirements. Then, these requirements are 
refined to obtain non-decomposable demand units.
Figure 2. Customer demand model.

192
The functions of the four layers in the model are as follows:
• Layer 1: This layer is the initial customer requirements layer. Different makes and models 
of products are associated with different customer needs (e.g. CK CNC machine tools, 
CJK CNC machine tools).
• Layer 2: This layer is a preliminary classification of customer needs. Combined with the 
idea of product–service, customer demand is decomposed into two parts: product require-
ments and service requirements.
• Layer 3: This layer contains different categories of requirements for service requirements 
and product requirements. Different requirements are analyzed and combined. The prod-
uct requirement categories are identified by upper-case letters, the service requirements 
are identified by lower-case letters, and the sub-requirements are identified by numbers. 
For example, A1 represents the first sub-requirement in the first category of product 
requirements and c2 represents the second sub-requirement in the third category of serv-
ice requirements. On the basis of this method, all of the different sub-requirements are 
numbered.
• Layer 4: This layer represents the ultimate non-decomposable requirement unit. Accord-
ing to the decomposition rules, the sub-requirements are decomposed and merged to 
obtain a series of requirement units. The coding rules for this layer are given. A product 
requirement unit is represented by the lower-case letter k and numbered from one. A 
service requirement unit is represented by the lower-case letter p, and numbered from 
one to n.
According to customer demand preference, the weights of technical characteristics of 
follow-up services are determined. Customer demand is also a measure of the quality of the 
subsequent product and service configuration scheme. When determining service require-
ments and their weights, the results are not unique because different experts have differ-
ing views. A method based on a standard weighting matrix can deal with these subjective 
and fuzzy service requirements effectively, and can achieve more accurate customer demand. 
Then, the key service requirements are identified to prepare for the subsequent scheme design 
and optimization. Figure 3 shows the flow chart of customer-demand importance analysis.
3.2 Feature matching between customer demand
Through analysis of customer demand and decomposition, several demand units are derived. 
However, these units are demands for products and services and cannot direct the configura-
tion design of pe-PSS. In the configuration process, engineers also need to map these customer 
requirements to the technical features of products and services from a technical point of view.
Figure 3. Flow of customer-demand importance analysis.

193
In this paper, Quality Function Deployment (QFD) is used as a transformation tool to 
establish the relationship matrix between customer requirements and technical features. 
Through the transformation of a relational matrix, customer requirements are transformed 
into technical features of products. QFD is used to obtain the information needed in the 
process of product or service configuration and its structure is shown in Figure 4.
As can be seen from Figure 4, the structure contains the customer requirement unit and its 
requirement weight. The requirement unit is an independent and specific unit obtained from 
the decomposition of customer requirements. By resolving the importance of the require-
ment unit, the weight of each requirement unit can be obtained. Expectations are set up to 
represent the degree of customer demand for products or services. Each expectation cor-
responds to each requirement unit and has a mapping relationship with the technical target 
feature.
In configuration design, the technical characteristics determined by the engineer play a 
decisive role in the whole configuration design process. The content described by technical 
features includes two aspects: qualitative description and quantitative description. For exam-
ple, the diameter of the spindle hole is 600 mm, in which ‘the diameter of the spindle hole’ 
is a technical feature, and ‘ϕ 600 mm’ is a quantitative description. The correlation between 
the customer demand unit and the technical feature is represented by rij. The degree of cor-
relation between the units of items i and the technical feature of item j is usually expressed 
by rij. There are four relationships: strong correlation, intermediate correlation, weak correla-
tion and uncorrelated. In order to quantitatively describe the correlation between customer 
demand and technical characteristics, a correlation evaluation table is established, which is 
shown in Table 1.
A correlation matrix is used to describe the relationship between customer requirement 
units and technical features. The matrix and the weight of the technical feature are used to 
describe its importance. The target value of the technical feature is the expected value of the 
possible target of the technical feature. It corresponds to the technical feature and provides 
the basis for the subsequent configuration design.
Some of the obtained technical features can be directly mapped from customer require-
ments. For some fuzzy requirement information, rough set theory is used to determine the

corresponding technical features. Considering the potential conflicts between different service 
technology features, reasonable solutions are needed. For example, on the basis of require-
ments mapping, a certain service conflict resolution method is used to identify and analyze 
the feature conflict of service technology, and finally solve the problem.
3.3 Division of product and service modules
At present, due to the advantages of modular design, more and more attention is being paid 
to the design of a PSS. It should be noted that the division of product modules is a key ele-
ment in modular design, and the partition of service modules is configuration-oriented. The 
purpose is to realize the rapid provision and application of services. The design of a serv-
ice module should be oriented to a physical product, and the partition of a service module 
should be consistent with that of a physical product. The aim is to facilitate the implementa-
tion of service modules and the refinement of physical products.
Based on the analysis of customer demand, the whole life-cycle approach is used to 
divide the product modules from the point of view of structure and function. The structure 
attributes and function attributes are decomposed, and the module partition criterion for the 
whole life cycle is obtained. The correlation matrix of parts is established by analyzing the 
interrelations between parts. According to the constraints of the rules, a part relationship 
model is constructed to express the relative relationship between the parts. Finally, the fuzzy 
mean clustering algorithm is used to cluster each part and obtain the product module. Tak-
ing aCJK CNC machine tool product as an example, dividing the related module, is shown 
in Table 2.
From the point of view of manufacturing enterprises, the service provided to customers 
is also a product. The service module is a relatively independent service function carrier 
which is provided by the service provider for customers. It is the construction element of a 
product–service scheme. It is composed of a series of service components with interrelated 
relationships. Each service module contains the same function but a different performance 
module instance. A module example refers to the concrete implementation of a service 
module. Thus, ‘system fault diagnosis, network feedback response within two hours’ and 
‘engineer manual diagnosis, video and voice feedback within four hours’ are two examples 
of a diagnostic service module. They are both for fault diagnosis, but their service perform-
ance is not the same. Therefore, the service module can be created on the basis of fuzzy 
tree graph theory; then, the module is selected according to the importance of the module 
to customer demand.
3.4 Configuration design and optimization of pe-PSS
A multi-objective optimization model for pe-PSS solution configuration optimization was 
established. This model can enhance the flexibility of industrial product service solution 
design and satisfy the customer’s customization requirements quickly. The scheme is based 
on the degree of correlation between industrial product module examples and technical

features, service cost and service response time. By solving the model, a set of configuration 
optimization solutions for a series of service schemes is obtained. Then, based on the criteria 
of customer satisfaction, the scheme in the service configuration optimization scheme set is 
further selected in order to obtain the best service scheme.
4 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
A framework of a pe-PSS based on customer demand is proposed. The function and design 
idea of the framework are expounded. In order to ensure the operation of the frame-work, 
some key support technologies are described, including customer requirement identification 
and analysis, customer demand and service technology feature matching, product and service 
module partition, configuration design and optimization of pe-PSS.
Further research on the relationship between product and service modules, configuration 
design algorithms will be carried out in the future.

ABSTRACT: To resolve the problem due to drift and noise in attitude estimation process 
of MEMS inertial measuring unit on quadrotor, an improved algorithm based on comple-
mentary filtering is presented. A test platform of quadrotor carried out with MPU9250 as 
attitude measuring unit is established. Both under static and dynamic conditions, attitude 
data obtained from different methods are collected and compared, including Kalman filter-
ing algorithm for information integration, data fusion with traditional complementary filter-
ing, and our improved filtering fusion algorithm. Experimental results show that the present 
improved attitude fusion algorithm has advantages in terms of higher estimation precision 
and lesser drift and noise errors of the final attitude angle in different conditions, and is easy 
to implement in low cost aircraft control system.
Keywords: quadrotor, complementary filtering, attitude fusion, MPU9250
1 INTRODUCTION
Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is an aircraft with no pilot on board. UAV is now increas-
ingly used as a cost effective and timely method of several applications, such as navigation, 
rescuing and reconnaissance. There exist many advantages of UAV technology, such as low 
cost, ecological operation, and most of all (Ammour et al. 2017). In general, there are four 
categories of UAV, namely single rotor helicopters, multi rotor-crafts, fixed wing planes and 
hybrid combinations (Kanellakis & Nikolakopoulos 2017). Among UAV the class of multi 
rotor-crafts can be further divided into tri-copters, quad-rotor, hexa-rotor and octa-copters. 
In the UAV community, the quadrotor is more popular than the others. It can be operated 
both indoors and outdoors and is a fast and agile platform for demanding maneuvers, e.g., 
hovering or moving along a target in close quarters.
An attitude solution aims to obtain the real-time accurate attitude angle of the aircraft. 
Accurate acquisition of attitude information is the premise for drones to achieve stable 
flight. The accuracy and speed of attitude calculation will directly affect the stability and 
reliability of the flight control algorithm. With the attitude calculation accuracy requiring, 
how the attitude data fusion refines is still a hot topic in current research. In the commonly 
used MEMS inertial navigation devices, gyroscopes will bring zero drift and integration 
error. Accelerometers are easily interfered by noise or vibration. Magnetometers are sus-
ceptible to interference from external magnetic fields (Kang et al. 2012).
To solve the problems and improve the measurement accuracy of the attitude angle, many 
algorithms based on the Kalman filtering principle were used. For instance, Feng et al. pro-
posed an improved extended Kalman filter algorithm (BPNN-EKF) to improve the accu-
racy greatly (Feng et al. 2017). He et al. used a modified iterative EKF (IEKF) algorithm, 
which improved filtering precision (He et al. 2015). Wang et al. used Kalman filter algorithm 
to improve the accuracy of the attitude measurement of the aircraft (Wang &Yang 2013). 

198
Pan et al. used the attitude estimation algorithm based on Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), 
which achieved higher stability, solution accuracy and convergence speed than EKF (Pan 
et al. 2012). Tang et al. used the Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF) algorithm to estimate the 
performance better than UKF (Tang et al. 2012).
Although previous works improved the accuracy of attitude calculation, they are not 
suitable for low-cost embedded attitude measurement systems, because they often suffered 
from a large amount of mathematical computations. In this paper, an improved algorithm 
is introduced. It uses magnetometers and accelerometers to reduce attitude errors caused by 
gyroscopes deviation in MEMS sensor. In addition, to correct gyroscope bias, a proportional-
integral (PI) controller is proposed into the control system. The experiment demonstrates 
that improved algorithm has merits in small computational complexity, good real-time per-
formance and high precision.

3 OUR APPROACH
Among MEMS sensors, a gyroscope is able to generate high-precision attitude estimation 
data in a short period of time, whereas the data generated by accelerometers and magnetom-
eters is comparably poor. It is worth noticing that the gyroscope suffers from integral errors 
due to drift over time, leading the degradation to the attitude accuracy gradually. By contrast, 
the measurement errors of accelerometers and magnetometers do not increase (He & Chen 
2016). In other words, with respect to the dynamic characteristics the gyroscope outperforms 
accelerometers and magnetometers. Thus, complementary filtering algorithm (Wang et al. 
2016) was proposed to fuse data of the three types of MEMS sensors, in order to improve the 
final accuracy of attitude calculation and dynamic characteristic of control systems.
However, since the stop band attenuation of a low-pass filter is slow, the noise becomes 
large. Besides, if the filter’s parameters are fixed, it is difficult to achieve optimal estimation 
values. In order to address these issues, we propose a new algorithm where the PI controller is 
introduced to reduce errors from MEMS sensors, i.e., gyroscopes, accelerometers, and mag-
netometers. The algorithm is improved based on the classical method called complementary 
filtering (Wang et al. 2016). Dynamic compensation coefficients are Kp and Ki. Weights of 
accelerometers and magnetometers are reduced, when noise interference size increases. In 
this case, it mainly relies on the gyroscope to perform attitude determination, improving the 
fusion precision of the attitude data. The implementation flowchart of the improved algo-
rithm is displayed by Figure 1.
The procedure of our algorithm is as follows:
1. Unitize accelerometer and magnetometer measured value. In the carrier coordinate sys-

4 EXPERIMENT
4.1 Experimental environment
To verify feasibility and effectiveness of our algorithm, we established a test platform and used 
a small four-axis aircraft to be controlled. The main control chip adopts STM32F411 that has a 
rich peripheral interface. The attitude chip uses the nine-axis MPU9250, which owns DMP (Dig-
ital Motion Processor) and supports MPL. MPU9250 is connected to the main control chip by 
software IIC. Real-time attitude and solved attitude angle information are received by computer 
through serial communication. Measuring range of gyroscope output is ±2 000°/s, and cutoff 
frequency of low-pass filters is 50 Hz. In PI controller, parameters are kp = 10 and ki = 0.008.
4.2 Experimental comparison and analysis
In static environments, attitude angles calculated by Kalman filtering algorithm (KL) (Wang 
et al. 2016), first-order complementary filtering algorithm (FF) (Nan et al. 2017), second-
order complementary filtering algorithm (SF) (Nan et al. 2017), DMP solution (He & Chen 
2016) and improved complementary filtering algorithm (OURES) are calculated, test results 
shown in Figure 2. Attitude angles respectively calculated by accelerometer (AC) and gyro-
scope (GY) are shown in Figure 3.
Figure 2. Comparison of experimental results of OURES, KL, DMP, FF, SF.

201
It can be seen from Figure 3 that angles directly calculated by accelerometers own noise 
interference. Experimental results prove that angles calculated by gyroscopes drift nearly 
1° within one minute. According to Figure 2, it reveals that calculation of first-order and 
second-order complementary filtering algorithm filters out some spikes and still exists large 
fluctuation, having a much better effect. Improved complementary filtering algorithm shows 
very good results, with relative static standard error of 0.01°.
To verify effectiveness of algorithm in dynamic environment, several dynamic calculations 
are performed on the four-rotor aircraft hardware platform. Test results of different algo-
rithm are shown in Figure 4. Attitude angles respectively calculated by accelerometers and 
gyroscopes are indicated in Figure 5.
Figure  4 reflects that both Kalman filter algorithm and improved complementary fil-
ter algorithm can effectively filter out some interfere of high frequency signal. Compared 
with improved complementary filtering, second-order complementary filtering, first-order 
complementary filtering and Kalman filtering have some delay. Since second-order com-
plementary filtering calculation is relatively large, real-time tracking performance is worse 
than first-order filtering effect. It is smoother than first-order complementary filtering curve, 
curve relatively lagging. Improved algorithm that can effectively filter out some signal inter-
ference is smoother than traditional algorithm filtering curve, because proportional-integral 
(PI) controller is introduced. Improved complementary filter which mirrors a better solu-
tion than traditional complementary filter can improve stability of system attitude solution.

5 CONCLUSION
Accurate acquisition of attitude data is the premise for drones to achieve smooth and stable 
flight. This paper studies processing method of aircraft attitude information fusion, and 
a proportional-integral (PI) controller is proposed into the control system. Motivated by 
traditional complementary filter fusion, an improved complementary filtering algorithm is 
presented to fuse multi-sensor data. A hardware test platform is set up to test and compare 
attitude information acquired from different methods in static and dynamic environments. 
The comparison results show that the present improved filter algorithm can avoid that gyro-
scopes solve attitude independently. The algorithm effectively compensates output error of 
attitude angle. Also, it can inhibit drift and noise of attitude angle in static conditions and 
track change of attitude angle quickly in dynamic condition. Thus, the precision of attitude 
angle estimation is improved and stability of the system attitude calculation is enhanced.

ABSTRACT: For specialized equipment such as roller coasters, design and safety analysis 
are very important. In this paper, the dynamic performance of a four-ring (four-loop) roller 
coaster is investigated. The velocity, acceleration and force curves of various elements are 
simulated using ADAMS software. The acceleration of the roller coaster is experimentally 
measured by using an accelerometer, and the results align closely with the simulation (the 
maximum error is 4.5%). From the results, we found that the value of dynamic response of 
the first car is larger than the others, and it should be considered to represent a higher level of 
risk. The changes of dynamic responses of the roller coaster under different loads and differ-
ent wind speeds are then analyzed. We found that the peak acceleration of the roller coaster 
decreases with the increase of wind speed, while the force on the connecting fork increases 
with the increase of load of the roller coaster.
Keywords: four-ring roller coaster, dynamic simulation, acceleration, force
1 INTRODUCTION
The roller coaster is an important feature of amusement parks, and with the progression 
towards more exciting, higher-speed rides, stricter requirements for the design of compo-
nents and analysis of their safety have been proposed. However, the traditional roller coaster 
design method (design–manufacture–test–improve–test) has the disadvantages of long cycle 
times and high costs, and it is difficult to guarantee safety (Zheng, 2002).
Researchers inside and outside China have carried out simulation research on roller coast-
ers from different perspectives and achieved results. Within China, Yin and co-workers (Yin 
et al., 2012) used spline curves to build the required track for a roller coaster simulation, 
establishing a reference for roller coaster dynamics modeling. Chen and Guan (2010) used 
ADAMS dynamics simulation software (MSC Corporation, Newport Beach, CA, USA) to 
establish a roller coaster dynamics model and carry out simulation analysis. The simulation 
validity was verified by comparing the speed data obtained with measured data. Outside 
China, Teng and co-workers (Teng et al., 2010) established a roller coaster dynamics model 
and carried out a dynamics analysis: the error between the analysis result and the actual 
measurement was only 6.4%, which establishes a reference for follow-up safety analysis.
The research outlined above has provided a basis for the dynamic simulation of roller coast-
ers. In order to further study the dynamic parameters of roller coasters, this paper took a 
four-ring (four-loop) roller coaster as its research object, carried out dynamic simulation using 
ADAMS, and obtained the roller coaster velocity, acceleration and force curves of its com-
ponents. On the basis of the model validation analysis, the dynamic parameters of the roller 
coaster under different wind speeds and different load conditions were then compared and 
analyzed. The conclusions can provide a reference for the design and safety analysis of roller 
coasters.

2 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ROLLER COASTER DYNAMICS MODEL
The four-ring roller coaster principally consists of the car body and the track. There are four 
cars in total, which are equipped with five wheel-groups. Individual cars are connected by 
connecting forks, of which there are three. The roller coaster track is 471 m long and contains 
a lifting section, downhill section, vertical ring section, floating ring section and spiral sec-
tion. The track is composed of track tube, supporting tube, sleeper, and column.
2.1 The modeling of the roller coaster
Without affecting the dynamic simulation, the car body is simplified and the key connectors 
between the car bodies are retained by using SolidWorks modeling software (Dassault Sys-
tèmes, Vélizy-Villacoublay, France). The center curve of the supporting pipe can be obtained 
from the three-dimensional coordinates of the supporting pipe, and then the center curve 
of the left and right tracks can be obtained by coordinate transformation according to the 
inclination angle of the track and the relative positions of the left and right branch tracks 
(Liang et al., 2006).
2.2 Adding constraints and loading
The constraints of the roller coaster dynamic simulation include fixed-pair, rotating-pair 
and point-line constraints. The contact relationship between real wheels and the track is very 
complex, and the modeling is difficult to calculate accurately. The point-line constraint is 
therefore used to simplify the wheel–rail relationship. The roller coaster will bear the gravity, 
friction, wind resistance, and traction when climbing. The force of gravity is applied to the 
roller coaster retrospectively, and then solved.
2.3 Model verification
In order to verify the accuracy of the model, the acceleration at six representative points on 
the track (see Figure 1) is measured with an accelerometer and compared with the simulated 
acceleration. The comparison results are shown in Table 1.

The comparison error for the six points is within 5%, and the maximum error is only 4.5%. 
The model and method are therefore credible.
3 ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION OF SIMULATION RESULTS
Velocity, acceleration and force on connectors are important dynamic parameters of roller 
coasters for running safety. Vehicle load and wind speed are also important factors. There-
fore, the vertical acceleration and the forces on the different connecting parts are compared 
under the conditions of full load and 15 m/s wind speed. The different running conditions are 
then also studied with reverse wind speeds (−5 m/s, −10 m/s and −15 m/s) and different loads 
(full load, half-load, and no load).
3.1 Velocity analysis
Under natural conditions, the wind may come from any direction, and the windward area of 
the roller coaster is constantly changing during operation. Only the most dangerous situa-
tion was therefore evaluated, that is, the wind direction always opposite to the direction of 
travel of the roller coaster and the largest windward area. The simulation results for different 
headwinds are shown in Figure 2.
As shown in Figure 2, the completion time of the simulation increases with the increase of 
wind speed, while the maximum peak velocity decreases with the increase of wind speed. The 
maximum difference in peak velocity is 2.5 m/s.
3.2 Acceleration analysis
Figure 3 shows that there is a difference in the vertical acceleration of different cars; the peak 
acceleration of the first car is −34.9 m/s2, the acceleration of the rear car is −30.3 m/s2, and 
the accelerations of the two middle cars are 29.6 and 27.1 m/s2. Rides in the first and last cars 
are therefore more exciting than in the middle cars.
Figure 2. Different wind-force velocity curves.
Figure 3. Vertical acceleration–time curves for different cars.

210
The simulation results under different wind speeds and loads are shown in Figure 4. From 
Figure 4a, it can be seen that the acceleration of the first vehicle under different wind speeds 
has obvious lag, and the peak acceleration decreases with the increase of the wind speed. The 
maximum acceleration difference is 3.7 m/s2. From Figure 4b, it can be seen that the lag of 
acceleration for different cars is small under different loads, and the peak value and trend of 
change are not different. The load of the roller coaster has little effect on acceleration.
3.3 Force analysis
There are five wheel-groups and three connecting forks in the four-ring roller coaster, and the 
number of parts increases from the first car to the last car. The wheel–rail contact force of 
different wheel-groups and different connecting-fork forces is shown in Figure 5.
Figure 5a shows that the force on the front wheel group of the first car is the largest, with 
a peak value of 72,317 N. This is more than six times that on the other wheels, wherein the 
forces are similar to one another. Figure 5b shows that the maximum force on the connecting 
fork between the first car and the second car is 35,925 N, and the forces on the other con-
necting forks are similar. Therefore, the front wheel of the first car, and the connecting fork 
between the first and second cars should be taken as the key points in the safety inspection 
analysis.
The wheel–rail contact force and connecting-fork force under different load conditions are 
shown in Figure 6. As can be seen in Figure 6a, the wheel–rail contact force under different 
loads has a lag, and the lag increases gradually with the increase of load. Figure 6b shows 
that the force on the connecting fork under different loads increases with the increase of load, 
and the difference of peak force between full load and no load is 11,481 N. Therefore, it can 
be seen that the roller coaster is subject to higher forces (and is potentially more dangerous) 
under the conditions of higher loads and wind speeds, and these conditions should be the 
primary object of safety analysis.

4 CONCLUSIONS
A dynamic simulation model of a roller coaster is first established by using ADAMS soft-
ware, and the speed, acceleration and force of connecting parts and time-varying curves of 
the wheel–rail contact force are obtained. The maximum error between the simulated accel-
eration and the measured acceleration is only 4.5%, which shows that the simulation result 
is credible.
Secondly, the maximum peak velocity and peak acceleration decrease with the increase of 
wind speed. Through comparing and analyzing the acceleration, fork force and wheel–rail 
contact force of different roller coaster cars, it is found that the acceleration peak value of the 
first car is largest; the wheel–rail contact force on the front wheel of the first car is 72,317 N, 
which is more than six times that of the other wheel-groups, and the fork force decreases 
gradually from the front to the rear of the train. The first car, under full load conditions, 
should therefore be the focus of safety analyses and checks.

Structural response of welded plates to implementation of different 
weld passes for a specific weld throat
A.H. Eslampanah
R&D Sector, Machine Sazi Arak Company, Arak, Iran
ABSTRACT: Finite Element welding simulation is a useful method in which temperature 
distribution, distortion and residual stresses can be predicted. A three-dimensional model 
with moving heat source has represented the most accurate results with the capacity of moni-
toring effects of different parameters like welding speed. This paper evaluates how making 
a specific throat of a fillet welded joint by one or two passes distorts the joint. Thus, an FE 
model using a moving heat source has been employed. One pass and two passes were simu-
lated to somehow that in the two passes model, each weld line produced half of the weld 
area. Since other parameters including voltage and current welding have been assumed to be 
constant, weld speed in the two passes simulation became double that of the one pass model. 
Interesting results showed that this two pass welding leads to more unfavorable results.
Keywords: Finite element method, welding, residual stress, distortion
1 INTRODUCTION
Arc welding relies on the intense local heating of a joint where a certain amount of base metal 
is melted and fused with additional metal from the welding electrode. This intense local heat-
ing causes severe thermal gradients in the welded components while the non-uniform expan-
sion and contraction of the weld and surrounding base material produces residual stress 
and distortion. A thermal elastic-plastic finite element method can be effectively used to 
predict welding residual stress and distortion for welded joints made by plates. Many scien-
tists have worked on describing welding deformation and residual stress of fillet welds using 
appropriate models and its simulation (Barsoum & Barsoum, 2009 and Eslampanah et al., 
2011). Now, the double ellipsoidal model (Goldak & Akhlaghi, 2005) is widely accepted and 
applied in simulations. One common distortion due to the welding process is buckling and 
this often happens in weldments. When thin plates are welded, compressive stresses occur 
in areas away from the weld and can cause buckling distortion. Where buckling distortion 
occurs, the magnitude of distortion tends to be very large. Therefore, Finite Element Method 
(FEM) could also be a useful tool to predict welding buckling distortion in thin-walled alu-
minum T-joints (Asle Zaeem et al., 2007). Aalami-aleagha and Eslampanah (2012) investi-
gated residual stress and deformation on an unsymmetrical T-joint using both numerical and 
experimental methods. In that study, a surface heat flux simulates the transferred heat energy 
from arc combined with a volumetric heat flux which simulates the thermal energy of molten 
metal droplets. In this investigation, according to the nature of Shielded Metal Arc Welding 
(SMAW) and experimental observations, an ellipsoidal shape in which dissimilar dimensions 
at the front and rear was considered for both volumetric and surface heat flux. Then the 
mechanical constraint effect on residual stress and deformation was investigated.
Since evaluation of welding residual stress and distortion is a time-consuming analysis, it 
is very important to find a way to reduce this time. Eliminating one or more parameters can 
effectively reduce the time. In the case of elimination of one dimension only, several investiga-
tions were performed. For a butt weld pipe, the difference between 2-D and 3-D models was 

214
evaluated (Kyoungsoo et al., 2013). The results from the 2-D analysis have shown a similar stress 
distribution to that of the cross section of the 3-D analysis. Comparing the results between 2-D 
and 3-D analysis demonstrated an approximate 10% difference in axial stress, and 5% difference 
in circumferential stress. Although 2-D models save analyzing time, they decrease the accuracy 
of results. In this 2-D model, it is not possible to investigate welding speed and mechanical 
constraints. Eslampanah et al. (2015) presented a new simplified heat source model in which 
the parameter of time was eliminated during welding. Since this model can be 3-D, there is the 
possibility to evaluate constraint effects on welded specimens (Eslampanah et al., 2015).
In this study, a thermal elastic-plastic finite element method is used to estimate inherent defor-
mations and residual stresses for a T-fillet welded model. The aim is to investigate how using 
more weld passes influences residual stress and distortion of the specimen. Hence, to perform 
a final weld throat two different models were assumed: one which made the throat in one weld 
pass; and the other in two passes (in which each pass produced a half of the weld area). In order 
to reduce heat input for the second model, the weld speed was doubled and the other parameters 
remained constant. Since weld speed is a crucial parameter here, a 3-D model was employed. To 
validate the results, data from literature have been used (Aalami-aleagha et al., 2012).

To evaluate the results, three paths have been considered according to Figure 1b. Shielded 
metal arc welding was used with electrode E6013 with a 3.2 mm diameter.

one pass and represents the sequences for the model that makes a 4 mm throat by 2 weld 
passes.
3 FINITE ELEMENT SIMULATION
3.1 Thermo-mechanical analysis
The analysis procedure was based on uncoupled formulations for the calculation of welding 
residual stress, deformation and also temperature distribution.
A computational thermal elastic-plastic finite element procedure was developed to cal-
culate welding deformations of fillet welded joints. The temperature-dependent thermal-
physical properties such as specific heat, conductivity, density and temperature-dependent 
thermal-mechanical properties, such as Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, thermal expansion 
coefficient and yield strength were used for thermal and mechanical analysis, respectively 
(Aalami-aleagha & Eslampanah, 2012). The mechanical properties of the weld metal are 
considered to be the same as the parent metal.
In this study, the thermo-mechanical behavior of the welded joint is simulated using 
uncoupled formulations: first, the temperature distribution is calculated using heat transfer 
analysis and then the results used for mechanical analysis subsequently. An 8-node linear 
transfer brick element (DC3D8) was employed for the 3-D thermal analysis and a 3-D 8-node 
bi-quadratic stress/displacement quadrilateral with reduced integration (C3D8R) was used in 
the structural analysis. A relatively dense mesh was adopted close to the weld line in order to 
represent the temperature and strain gradients accurately—the further away the weld line, the 
longer the size of the elements. The complete model contains approximately 11,750 elements. 
The smallest element size is 2 × 2 × 1.7 mm approximately, based on mesh density analysis. As 
can be seen in Table 1, this simulation consists of four time steps, with each time step auto-
matically divided into subsequences by the ABAQUS software. Boundary conditions were 
carried out according to Figure 2. Fixtures limited the angular deformation of the flange 
and web plates.
The model adopted the technique of element birth and death to simulate weld filler mate-
rial. The elements in the weld beads which were born in the latter stages of the process have 
been subjected to change in the stiffness value (Aalami-aleagha & Eslampanah, 2012).

3.2 Heat transfer analysis
In order to consider the moving heat source in SMAW, a combination of surface and volu-
metric heat source was assumed (Barsoum, 2008). The rear and front of the electrode used 
in the welding process have dissimilar thermal situations due to the absorption of thermal 
energy by the molten metal in the front and ejection of energy from the rear due to the occur-
rence of the solidification process and latent heat. The surface heat flux for the front and 
rear of the welding zone has been modeled by the following equations (Aalami-aleagha & 
Eslampanah, 2012).

where x′ and z′ denote the local coordinates which are rotated 45º due to the working angle

The power of the welding arc (QArc) is given in Equation 3 where QWire, volumetric part of 
heat source, is attributed to the power of the molten metal droplets. In this equation η, I and 
U represent efficiency, arc current and arc voltage respectively:

In this analysis heat flux from the molten metal droplets is assumed to be 70% of the total 
heat, and the surface heat flux 30% of the total heat flux. The arc efficiency, η, is assumed to 
be 0.7. Using FORTRAN programming, the heat source was modeled by the ABAQUS user 
subroutine DFLUX for heat flux. The initial temperature was assumed to be 25oc. The user 
defined subroutine FILM was developed to simulate the combined convection and radiation 
(Eslampanah et al., 2015):

3.3 Mechanical model
The second stage of the analysis involves the use of temperature histories predicted by 
the thermal model as an input for a mechanical model. Due to the temperature gradient, 
the thermal strain is calculated by using the temperature-dependent coefficient of ther-
mal expansion. Mechanical boundary conditions are applied in two different conditions, 
in the first to prevent rigid body motion, and in the other one to simulate fixtures, see 
Figure 2.
4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Residual stresses and deflection have been obtained from the analysis. Figure 3 shows the ver-
tical displacement of the flange along γ path located at the middle of weld line. Experiment 
results (Aalami-aleagha & Eslampanah, 2012) are related to one pass welding condition at 
each side. Obviously, the simulation is in good agreement with the experiment results, so the 
numerical results are considered acceptable. Here, the effect of applying two passes instead 
of one pass on deflection is observed. The curves show that displacement increases when the 
specimen is heated by a welding heat source with double the speed.

217
Surprisingly the displacement magnitude rises considerably (2.3 times greater at the edge) 
when each weld line is heated twice. Moreover, increasing the welding speed results in higher 
temperature gradients in the plates.
Figure 4 compares residual stresses between the two models along the alpha (α) path as 
defined in Figure 1. The graphs show that at the end of the path, after the peaks, both con-
ditions resulted in the same magnitude and trends while, at the start, compressive residual 
stresses for the two pass condition reached considerably higher values. At the middle of the 
path, tensile residual stresses for the two pass model have worse results also, with a longitu-
dinal residual stress and transverse residual stress of almost 40 MPa and 35 MPa higher than 
the one pass model, respectively. On the other hand, welding by two passes could mitigate 
maximum transverse residual stress from 180 MPa to 148 MPa as per Figure 4b, meanwhile 
it caused the peak longitudinal stress to raise around 13 MPa.
Figure 5 shows that applying two passes would exacerbate the situation in path β. A maxi-
mum stress was recorded of 135 MPa for the two pass model here.

5 CONCLUSION
Residual stress and distortion in fillet welded joints were evaluated for two different condi-
tions for a weld throat of 4 mm: in one, the throat was produced by one pass and, in the other, 
in two passes. The speed in two pass model was considered twice that of one pass. Generally, 
the results demonstrated that the residual stresses and distortion of the two pass model were 
higher than the one pass model. Nevertheless, two pass conditions caused a considerably 
reduced maximum tensile transverse residual stress.

ABSTRACT: Metal Inert Gas (MIG) welding is one of the most broadly used welding 
processes in mass production, as well as in small scale industries. The main reason for this 
is that MIG welding can weld both ferrous and non-ferrous metals. The aim of the present 
study is to experimentally investigate the ultimate tensile strength during the MIG weld-
ing of AISI 304. The input parameters used for the experimental work were wire speed, 
gas flow rate and welding time. Mean effect plot and S/N ratio graphs have been used to 
optimize the welding parameters of MIG on AISI 304 stainless steel using the Taguchi 
method and ANOVA. It has been observed that wire speed has the largest effect on the 
tensile strength of AISI 304 steel MIG weldments. The optimum welding conditions for 
greater strength were wire speed (m/min), gas flow rate (liters/min) and welding time (sec).

1 INTRODUCTION
Welding is a fabrication technology that is used to join materials, usually metals or thermoplas-
tics, by causing fusion, which usually results by melting the base metal. Welding is considered 
to be the most economical and efficient way to join metals permanently. It is the only way of

joining two or more pieces of metal in order to make them act as a single piece. Welding ranks 
highly among industrial processes and involves more sciences and variables than those involved 
in any other industrial process. There are many ways to make a weld and many different types 
of welding. Some processes require sparks, while others do not even require extra heat. Weld-
ing can be done anywhere in all sorts of environments, outdoors or indoors, underwater and 
even in outer space. At present, welding is required in all kinds of fields, including agriculture, 
construction and vehicle manufacturing, and even on oil drilling rigs. Welding can be divided 
into various categories. Figure 1 shows the different types of welding techniques.
1.1 MIG welding
Metal Inert Gas (MIG) welding is a process in which a consumable wire electrode is fed into 
an arc and welds pool at a steady but adjustable rate, while a continuous envelope of inert gas 
flows out around the wire and shields the weld from contamination by the atmosphere. The 
MIG welding process has several advantages, which accounts for its popularity and increased 
use in the welding industries. The most common application of MIG welding is for automo-
tive repair and it can be performed on any variety of vehicles. MIG welding can also be easily 
incorporated into robotics and can even be used to reinforce the surface of a worn out rail-
way track. MIG welding will help to contribute to the creation of automobiles, the building 
of bridges and, even more importantly, is a more efficient way to weld.
1.1.2 Working principle
As shown in Figure 2, the electrode used in this process is in the form of a coil and it is con-
tinuously fed toward the work during the process. At the same time, inert gas (e.g. argon, 
helium) is passed around the electrode from the same torch. Inert gas, usually argon, helium 
or a suitable mixture of these, is used to prevent the atmosphere from contacting the molten 
metal and HAZ. When gas is supplied it gets ionized and an arc is initiated in between the 
electrode and the work piece. Heat is therefore produced. The electrode melts due to the heat 
and molten filler metal falls on to the heated joint. An arc may be produced between a con-
tinuously fed wire and the work. Continuous welding with a coiled wire helps the high metal 
depositions rate and high welding speed. The filler wire is generally connected to the positive 
polarity of the DC source forming one of the electrodes. The work piece is connected to 
the negative polarity. The power source could be a constant voltage DC power source, with 
electrode positive, and it yields a stable arc and smooth metal transfer with least spatter for 
the entire current range.
AISI 304 stainless steel has been selected as the work material to be welded by MIG weld-
ing. Two of the desirable mechanical properties of AISI 304 are high strength and high duc-
tility. The chemical composition and properties of AISI 304 are shown in Tables 1 and 2.

2 LITERATURE SURVEY
The maximum yielding stress of two pieces of AISI 1040 medium carbon steel welded together 
with the help of metal inert gas welding. The parameters used to carry out this research were 
welding voltage, current, wire speed and gas flow rate. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) 
was applied to these welding parameters in order to find the optimized MIG welding parameters 
for maximum yielding stress (Hooda et al., 2012). Experiments were also performed on alumi-
num alloys of grades 6061 and 5083, which were welded with metal inert gas welding to find 
the hardness of the MIG welding joint using the Taguchi method. The parameters involved in 
this study were welding speed, welding current and welding voltage (Kanwal & Jadoun, 2015). 
Parametric optimization was determined when two dissimilar pieces of metal stainless steel (SS 
304) and low carbon steel were welded together using MIG welding. The parameters on which 
the analysis was done were current, voltage and travel speed. ANOVA and the Taguchi technique 
were applied for the optimization using MINITAB 13 computer software (Chauhan & Jadoun, 
2014). A research study was carried out to determine the optimized value of the MIG welding 
parameters needed to attain the maximum tensile strength of aluminum alloy AM- 40 (EN AW 
5083). Welding current and welding voltage were the parameters used to judge this study (Saxena 
et al., 2015). The effect of MIG welding on AISI 1030’s ultimate tensile strength was observed. 
The major parameters used in this study were welding speed and welding current. ANOVA and 
the Taguchi technique were practiced in order to generate an orthogonal array, so as to optimize 
the characteristics, such as signal to noise ratio (Patil & Waghmare, 2013). A research study has 
been presented on cold reduced low carbon steel IS 513 GR ‘D’ welded together using metal inert 
gas. Welding current, wire elongation and welding voltage were used as the welding parameters 
for the observation. The signal to noise ratio, ANOVA and orthogonal array of L9were used to 
optimize the input parameters and Taguchi methods were employed on weld width and weld 
height (Verma & Singh, 2014). The effect on the Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) of theST-37 low 
alloy steel material was demonstrated, and the parameters being worked upon were current (A), 
voltage (V), gas flow rate and speed. The experiment was done by using a L9 orthogonal array to

find out the UTS. Confirmatory experiments were also performed to find out the optimal range 
sets of current, voltage speed and gas flow rate (Utkarsh et al., 2014). The effect of three process 
parameters on MIG welding was investigated, and the parameters chosen for the study were cur-
rent, voltage and gas flow rate. Their effect on the tensile strength of welded joints on C20 carbon 
steel grade was studied. Taguchi’s L9 orthogonal array method was used for the optimization of 
these parameters. From the results we could conclude that voltage affected both the mean and 
variation of tensile strength, whereas the current had a significant effect on mean variation only 
(Ibrahim et al., 2012).
3 EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS: MATERIAL AND PROCESS
Work metal, AISI 304 stainless steel was welded together using AISI 308L filler material in 
MIG welding apparatus. This was used due to its comparable properties with AISI 304. An 
AISI 308L spool is shown in Figure 3.
Experiments were carried out based on Taguchi’s L9 and the ANOVA method. Three factors, 
i.e. wire speed, gas flow rate and welding time, were selected in order to conduct the experiment, 
with three levels each. The selected parameters and their levels are shown in Table 3.
During this study, tensile strength was measured after conducting a total of nine experi-
ments. A total number of 18 pieces of AISI 304 were cut down from raw material. These 
pieces were then welded in pairs, as per the L9 orthogonal array suggested by Taguchi’s 
design. The welded joints are shown in Figure 4.

It could be noted that wire speed has the largest effect on the strength of AISI 304 steel 
at weld bead in MIG welding. The welding speed has the smallest outcome on the tensile 
strength. From the above main effect plot, it may be observed that the optimum conditions 
for hardness of weld parts are, A3, B1 and C2, i.e. wire speed (10 m/min), gas flow rate (8 
liters/min) and welding time (7 sec).
The interaction plot, shown in Figure 7, which is the combination of all three parameters 
interacting with each other at different levels, gives the idea that wire speed, gas flow rate and 
welding time all had considerable effects on the weld bead hardness of AISI 304 stainless 
steel.

225
4 CONCLUSIONS
It can be concluded from the experimental investigation that, for the optimum ultimate ten-
sile strength of the weld zone during the metal inert gas welding of AISI 304 stainless steel, 
wire speed and gas flow rate could have a significant contribution. The AISI 304 steel opti-
mum welding conditions for higher tensile strength were, welding speed (10 m/min), gas flow 
rate (8 liters/min) and welding time (7 sec).

1 INTRODUCTION
Research on the cryogenic treatment of materials have become a hot topic in recent years 
(Chetan & Reo, 2017; Sanjeev et al., 2017), in which the studies on cryogenic treatment of 
aluminum alloy are more common. At the end of the century, Tang and Huang (1998) was 
the first to report the results of cyclic treatment (i.e. cryogenic treatment) simultaneously 
improving the strength and plasticity of aluminum alloy LD10. Subsequently, Jin et al. (2000) 
reported that cryogenic treatment can improve the volume stability of an aluminum alloy 
(ZL108) piston, as well as its strength, elongation and hardness, and observed that the point-
like eutectic (Si) in the matrix structure was more uniform. Chen and Li (2000a) and Chen and 
Li (2000b) reported the results of the cryogenic treatment of aluminum and aluminum alloys, 
in which they concluded that the most deformed aluminum alloys had an increase in tensile 
strength, but decreased plasticity. This was obtained by the cryogenic treatment of deformed 
aluminum alloys 1–8 series, and proposed the concept of grain rotation. Since then, research 
on the cryogenic treatment of aluminum alloys has attracted much attention. Research has 
mainly involved the improvement of microstructure and performance, the enhancement of 
dimensional stability and wear resistance, the elimination of residual stress, and the study 
of a corresponding mechanism. In particular, the influence of cryogenic treatment on the 
microstructure and properties of materials has mostly been studied. Aluminum alloys are 
divided into two categories: deformation and casting. Deformation aluminum alloys contain 
nine series and casting aluminum alloys are subdivided into six categories. Adding the state 
of every kind of aluminum alloy, the material of aluminum alloy can be said to be various. 
Most of the research on cryogenic treatment of aluminum alloys focuses on improving the 
structure, performance, process optimization and mechanism analysis of different materials. 
Based on the aluminum alloy material, the scope of the material of aluminum alloy refer 
to cryogenic treatment was summarized. As the deformation and cast aluminum alloy to

2  STUDY ON CRYOGENIC TREATMENT OF DEFORMED 
ALUMINUM ALLOYS
Deformable aluminum alloy is widely used in transportation, aerospace and other fields. 
At present, 2XXX, 3XXX, 6XXX and 7XXX series deformable aluminum alloys are most 
widely researched and used for cryogenic treatment. The effect and mechanism of cryogenic 
treatment on them are described below.
2.1 Cryogenic treatment on 2XXX series deformed aluminum alloys
The 2014 aluminum alloy has high strength and hardness, good plasticity and toughness 
as well as good forging, heat resistance and weldability, so it has been well applied in the 
aerospace field. With the rapid development of high-speed railway in recent years, 2014 
aluminum alloy is often used in various parts of this industry. However, the service life of 
the parts is reduced because of its low corrosion resistance, which limits the range of the 
engineering application to varying degrees. To improve these shortcomings, Xu et al. (2014) 
studied 12 kinds of composite processes including cryogenic treatment; they discovered two 
important processes. One of them was that a solid solution treatment for 80 mins at 505°C 
with water cooling, plus a cryogenic treatment holding for 20h, followed by an aging treat-
ment for 12h at 160°C. The second was a solid solution treatment for 80 mins at 505°C, 
water cooling plus an aging treatment for 12h at 120°C, followed by a regression treatment 
for 15 mins at 200°C, water cooling and an aging treatment for 12h at 160°C. The first proc-
ess dealt with cryogenic treatment after water cooling, and when compared to the second 
process without cryogenic treatment, the hardness and corrosion resistance of the aluminum 
alloy was significantly improved. In addition to high strength and good heat resistance, 2024 
aluminum alloy also has the advantages of low density. Therefore, it is often used for the 
structural parts of aircraft, such as covering, skeleton, rib beam and partition frame. The 
study by Wang et al. (2012) showed that 2024 aluminum alloy after cryogenic treatment not 
only reduced the residual stress of quenching and promoted the second phase precipitation, 
but also significantly improved fatigue and corrosion resistance performance.
2.2 Cryogenic treatment on 3XXX series deformed aluminum alloy
The cryogenic treatment of 3XXX series deformed aluminum alloy mainly focused on 3104 
aluminum alloy. It is usually used for making aluminum cans, light bulb covers, roof panels 
and colored aluminum sheets because of its high strength, good formability and corrosion 
resistance. Wen and Zhang (2016) cryogenically treated the 3104 aluminum alloy sample 
before homogenization, and by this, the lamellar Al6Mn phase appeared in the structure 
(which had the effect of inhibiting grain coarsening). Finally, the structure became more 
uniform and refine. Research by Fan et al. (2015) indicated that the strength and plasticity of 
3104 aluminum alloy was significantly improved by cryogenic treatment, and it was believed 
that the best composite process of the alloy was a homogeneous treatment for 10h after 
cryogenic treatment for 6h. Zhang et al. (2014a) performed a cryogenic treatment on recycled 
3104 aluminum alloy before homogenization, and this obtained the smallest Al6Mn phase 
size; approximately 3.25 ± 1.18 μm, which is a quantitative result of cryogenic treatment 
affecting the precipitated phase size. Some studies (Zhang et al., 2014b) also showed that the 
tensile strength, yield strength and elongation of 3014 aluminum alloy was increased by 29%, 
41% and 11% respectively, after the aluminum alloy was homogenized after cryogenic treat-
ment, and the strength and toughness were also improved.
2.3 Cryogenic treatment of 6XXX series deformed aluminum alloys
The cryogenic treatment of 6XXX deformation aluminum alloys mainly involves 6005, 
6061, 6005A and 6082 aluminum alloy. Among them, more uniform and fine precipitated 
strengthening phases were generated at the grain boundary in the 6005 aluminum alloy when 

229
its samples were subjected to cryogenic treatment after water quenching (Wan et al., 2013), 
which improved the alloy’s hardness and strength, but reduced its plasticity and toughness. 
However, the needle-like β phases (Mg2Si) were precipitated uniformly and diffusely in the 
intracrystalline, and the thick stick shaped β(Mg2Si) phases were precipitated discontinuously 
in the grain boundary in 6061 aluminum alloy subjected to cryogenic treatment (Wang et al., 
2016). It was also found that tensile strength, yield strength and elongation were improved 
by the treatment. Some researchers also discovered (Ni et al., 2018) that the elongation of 
6061 aluminum alloy can be significantly improved by cryogenic treatment, but the abrasion 
resistance of the alloy decreased. After cryogenic treatment on the cold metal transition 
welding joint of the 6061 aluminum alloy (Liu et al., 2017), the tensile strength, elongation 
and microhardness of the joint were improved, which was consistent with literature (Wang 
et al., 2016). However, it is obvious that 6005 and 6061 aluminum alloys are contradictory 
in terms of the effect of cryogenic treatment on plasticity and toughness. More accurate 
understanding requires further research and exploration. The welding joints of 6065A and 
6082 aluminum alloys were usually treated cryogenically because this gave good weld per-
formance. The 6065A aluminum alloy welding joint that underwent three cycles of cryogenic 
treatment (Ji et al., 2016) appeared to have a strengthened phase β(Mg2Si), and a series of 
fine precipitated phases, such as dispersion distribution Si and α-AlFeSi, which caused the 
joint to significantly increase in tensile strength and slightly decreased elongation. When the 
welding joint of 6082 aluminum alloy was treated at 540°C for a 50 mins solid solution water 
cooling and −196°C for a 20 h cryogenic treatment, the strength and plasticity of the joint 
had improved (Ge et al., 2015). It can be seen that both 6065A and 6082 aluminum alloy 
welding joints can dramatically improve their strength after cryogenic treatment, but whether 
the plasticity is improved is closely related to the specific cryogenic process.
2.4 Cryogenic treatment on 7XXX deformed aluminum alloys
The deformable aluminum alloy of 7XXX series is mainly divided into two types: one is a 
welded component material (Al-Zn-Mg series), the other is a high-strength alloy material 
(Al-Zn-Mg-Cu series). The application of the 7XXX aluminum alloys in the aerospace 
industry is very extensive. The crystalline grains of Al-Zn0.078-Mg0.018-Cu0.015 alloy was 
refined after cryogenic treatment (Li et al., 2015); this improved its mechanical properties. 
After aging treatment, the cryogenic treatment on the alloy induced a second phase 
precipitation discontinuously distributed along the grain boundary at the Guinier Preston 
zone in the aluminum matrix, which promoted the performance of the alloy. After solid solu-
tion treatment, 7A04 aluminum alloy was performed by cryogenic treatment, then a large 
number of precipitated phases were produced in and out of the grains whose distributions 
were uniform (Chen et al., 2012). Through such process, the hardness and tensile strength 
increased significantly, but plasticity and toughness improved slightly. After cryogenic treat-
ment, the strength and corrosion resistance of the extruded 7A04 aluminum alloy, that 
underwent the solid solution aging treatment, was improved in different degrees (Xu and 
Bu, 2015), and the alloy’s corrosion degree was related to the cryogenic time. After cryogenic 
treatment, the hardness, elastic modulus, hard elastic ratio (ratio of hardness and elastic 
modulus) and elastic recovery coefficient of LC9 (new brand 7A09) aluminum alloy were 
observably increased, but the friction factor was reduced, and its anti-indentation deforma-
tion ability was markedly improved (Liu et al., 2013). Cryogenic treatment can effectively 
enhance the tensile strength and microhardness of the 7A52 aluminum alloy welding joint 
(Zhang et al., 2014c), which was more obvious in the weld area.
3 CRYOGENIC TREATMENT OF CAST ALUMINUM ALLOY
Cast aluminum alloy has been widely used in the civil, aviation, marine and vehicle indus-
try due to its excellent casting performance, corrosion resistance and mechanical proper-
ties. The research results and applications of cryogenic treatment have attracted more and 

230
more attention. The residual stress of the ZL205A transition ring decreased by nearly 20%, 
and its tensile strength and yield strength were promoted when it was treated by a cooling 
and heating cycle (i.e. cryogenic treatment) (Bi et al., 2016). The tensile strength of A319 
alloy at room temperature improved slightly after cryogenic treatment, while the elongation 
increased significantly (Yang et al., 2014). However, if the alloy was treated with a solid 
solution plus an aging treatment before cryogenic treatment, both its tensile strength and 
elongation were markedly increased (Feng et al., 2014). Due to its advantages of low density, 
light weight, good thermal conductivity, low thermal expansion coefficient, excellent casting 
performance, volume stability, good abrasion resistance and corrosion resistance, hypereu-
tectic high-silicon aluminum alloy was commonly used as the piston material for automobile 
engines. The hardness, tensile strength and wear resistance of the high-silicon aluminum alloy 
that was solidified rapidly, can be improved by cryogenic treatment. The improving effect 
was related to the order of cryogenic cooling and the number of cryogenic applications (Shi 
et al., 2012). The research results showed that solid solution treatment plus cryogenic treat-
ment (for 24 h and on 2 occasions), together with an artificial aging treatment, was the best. 
The hardness, wear resistance and tensile strength of the hot-deposited and hot-extruded 
Al-Si alloy were significantly raised through deep cryogenic treatment (Wang et al., 2012), 
whose optimal treatment process was solid solution treatment plus cryogenic treatment and 
an aging treatment, which was consistent with the results in Shi et al. (2012). Cryogenic treat-
ment can promote the precipitation of the second phase in hypereutectic Al-Si alloy (Tian 
et al., 2017) and refine the grain. Meanwhile, it can significantly increase the hardness, tensile 
strength and elongation of the alloy. The effects of improving performance were related to 
the cryogenic time.
4 MECHANISM OF CRYOGENIC TREATMENT ON ALUMINUM ALLOY
Tang and Huang (1998) proposed that circulation processing (i.e. cryogenic treatment) 
produces a large number of helical dislocations, dislocation loops and even dislocation cells. 
At the same time, the original grains are divided into many sub-crystals, which mutually 
interact and entangle, then markedly enhance structure stability; this also improves the 
performance of the mechanics of the materials. Meanwhile the residual stress of the alloy is 
reduced and the distribution of the stress becomes relatively uniform. The formation mecha-
nism of dislocation and the precipitation law of the second phase has not been studied thor-
oughly by Tang and Huang (1998). Chen and Li (2000a) proposed the volume contraction 
and grain rotation effects in cryogenic treatment. The volume contraction effect is based on 
the law of thermal expansion and cold contraction of solids, which is actually the common 
law of all cryogenic materials. Volume shrinkage can lead to the following results: (1) the 
partial defects such as vacancies and micropores within the materials can be closed by the 
contraction; (2) the strain causes the lattice to contract, resulting in the atomic spacing to 
decrease, and the dislocation slip resistance to increase; (3) the contraction causes consider-
able internal stress in the material and induces a large number of dislocations; and (4) as a 
result, the internal energy is increased and sedimentary phases are precipitated. All these 
changes are conducive to improving the strength of materials. The grain rotation effect was 
proposed by Chen and Li (2000a) to solve the problem that the strength of aluminum alloy 
cannot always be improved by the process of cryogenic treatment. The so-called grain rota-
tion refers to the fact that a large number of dislocations and sub-crystals are generated in the 
material due to volume contraction during the cryogenic treatment process. Recovery recrys-
tallization is produced during the cryogenic recovery process, which causes the grains of alu-
minum alloy to rotate and form recrystallization texture in a selective orientation. When the 
grain orientation is conducive to preventing dislocation slip, the strength of the material can 
be promoted. It can be seen that the rotational effect of grain proposed is actually based on 
volume contraction. In addition, as mentioned by Chen and Li (2000b), the problem of grain 
rotation caused by cryogenic treatment is relatively complicated, and its preferred orientation 
depends not only on the alloy composition of the material, but also on the manufacturing 

231
process of the material. Some aluminum alloys have no improvement in their performance 
after cryogenic treatment, and there are other interpretation mechanisms besides the grain 
rotational effect (Jin et al., 2005). Based on the research of Tang and Huang (1998) and 
Chen and Li (2000a), the mechanism of the cryogenic treatment of aluminum alloys has 
been studied thoroughly by the authors of this paper. Volume shrinkage was taken as volume 
strain, and a quantitative relationship between stress and temperature was established by 
using Hooke’s law (Jin et al., 2005). The quantitative relationship can be used to estimate the 
amount of pressure added to aluminum alloys during cryogenic treatment. The formation 
mechanism of dislocation and the precipitation mechanism of the strengthening phase of 
cryogenic treatments on aluminum alloys can be described qualitatively and quantitatively by 
using the defect theory of crystal. Aluminum alloys acquire compressive stress in the proc-
ess of cryogenic treatment, which induces a large number of dislocations. At the same time, 
aluminum alloys under low temperatures also receive a lot of a saturation point defects (e.g. 
vacancy); under the effect of penetration, the dislocations proliferate. The dislocations on the 
one hand, through their own intertwining and pinning, improve the toughness of the alloy, 
but on the other hand, they interact with the solute atoms to result in sediment precipitation; 
thus, the dispersion is strengthened and improves the performance of the alloy.
5 CONCLUSIONS AND PROSPECTS
1. Both deformed and cast aluminum alloys can improve mechanical properties, fine struc-
ture and enhance corrosion resistance through cryogenic treatment.
2. The process of aluminum alloy cryogenic treatment has been basically understood. That 
is, the process effect of solid solution treatment plus cryogenic treatment, plus aging 
treatment, is better. Specific cryogenic parameters have been adjusted due to different 
materials.
3. The mechanism of the cryogenic treatment on aluminum alloys can be explained by the 
viewpoints put forward by Guangping Tang, Ding Chen and Fangwei Jin.
4. Further research work needs to be carried out in the future to make breakthroughs in 
cryogenic assembly and cryogenic machining, as well as design experimental research to 
confirm the theoretical results of mechanisms on cryogenic treatment.

ABSTRACT: We describe research carried out on a loaded cylinder for future generations 
of space-based optical cameras. This work requires the application of Carbon-Fiber-Rein-
forced Polymer (CFRP). In order to meet the requirements of light weight and stability, a 
higher-modulus carbon-fiber-composite material may be used. In this paper, an equivalent 
model of the loaded cylinder is established. The static deformation of the loaded cylinder 
using M40J/epoxy resin and M55J/Cyanate Ester (CE) composites is analyzed using the finite 
element method. The analysis results show that the static deformation stability is improved by 
32.8% using the M55J/CE composite material. The loaded cylinder manufactured with M55J/
CE was tested and the results proved that the equivalent model and its finite element analysis 
are reasonable and reliable, laying the foundation for subsequent engineering application.
Keywords: Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP), space optical camera, loaded cylinder
1 INTRODUCTION
Due to its high modulus, light weight, high strength and low coefficient of thermal expansion, 
high-modulus carbon fiber has the advantages of high stiffness, high structural dimensional 
stability, good fatigue resistance and good vibration resistance, and is an ideal reinforcement for 
structural spacecraft composites (Zhou, 2017a, 2017b; Romeo, 1995; Romeo & Martin, 2007).
In recent years, space-based optical cameras have developed in the direction of high reso-
lution, long focal length, large aperture, large field of view, large volume, and lighter weight. 
To reduce the weight of space cameras, lightweight structural materials with excellent proper-
ties must be used. Carbon-fiber composite is one of the best choices (Koyanagi et al., 2010; 
Utsunomiya et al., 2012).
Because the supporting structure between the optical elements involves great precision and 
requires high rigidity, the linear expansion coefficient of the construction material must be 
extremely constrained, and the space application requires the density to be as low as possible. 
Therefore, high-modulus Carbon-Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) is gradually gaining 
wider application (Zou et al., 2017; Chen et al., 1998, 2000).
The development of a high-stability loaded cylinder is one of the important factors that 
determine the imaging accuracy of the camera system. The loaded cylinder is the main 
loaded structure between the main and secondary mirror elements. It must be of low den-
sity, high rigidity and good stability. A CFRP loaded cylinder made of M40J/epoxy resin 
composite has been used in satellite cameras. However, the influence of gravity should also 
be considered when the loaded cylinder is used for detection on the ground. If the rigidity 

234
of the loaded cylinder is insufficient, the optical axis of the main mirror and the secondary 
mirror will be tilted, which will seriously affect the imaging quality of the camera. Therefore, 
the structural design of a CFRP loaded cylinder must meet the requirements of the static 
load and space mechanics environmental test at the same time, and have sufficient margins 
of strength and stiffness.
This paper studies and compares two loaded cylinders of high-modulus carbon-fiber com-
posites—M40J/epoxy resin and M55J/Cyanate Ester (CE) – to provide analysis methods and 
test data for subsequent application of M55J/CE composites.
The loaded cylinder of an existing coaxial camera (see Figure 1) is made of M40J/epoxy 
composites, mainly composed of carbon-fiber composites, but with a front flange, middle 
flange and rear flange made of titanium alloy. The middle flange is connected to the camera 
case, the front flange is connected to the main mirror part (which weighs 50 kg), and the 
rear flange is connected to the secondary mirror part (which weighs 13 kg). In ground-based 
detection, because of the effect of the earth’s gravity, it was found that during the adjustment 
of the optical machine, even if the amount of tilt of the secondary mirror with respect to the 
primary mirror is only 0.1′′, there is a coma on the image plane exceeding the requirements 
of the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) of the optical system. An MTF that affects the 
entire optical system fails to meet the technical specifications.
2 EQUIVALENT MODEL ESTABLISHMENT
As illustrated in Figure 3, the loaded cylinder is simplified to a circular-section cantilever 
beam model. Using similar principles, it is necessary to determine the simulation load form 
and weight characteristics of a loaded cylinder sample.
The load-bearing deformation test results of a loaded cylinder of M40J/epoxy composite 
are measured when a 13 kg secondary mirror component load is mounted on the left end of 
the middle flange at 456.24 mm of the total length of the 694 mm loaded cylinder, and the 
right end of the middle flange is at 237.76 mm (see Figure 2). When the 50 kg main mirror 
part is mounted to simulate load, then the detected tilt of the primary and secondary optical 
axes is approximately 1′′.
In order to simplify the model for follow-up engineering test verification, the equivalent 
conversion work needs to be performed.
According to the micro-deformation category, where the static loading deformation of the 
loaded cylinder is on a very small scale, the mechanical form of the ‘double cantilever on both 
sides of the middle fixing branch’ of the loaded cylinder of the M40J epoxy material can be 
equivalent to the theory of small deformation mechanics of the material. The mechanical 
form of the ‘single cantilever on one side of the fixed side’ is shown in Figure 2.
According to the linear equivalence principle, under small deflection the equivalent mass 
me is known from the torque equivalence relationship as:

In determining the weight of the simulated load of the loaded cylinder sample, the mechan-

This, when solved, indicates that me2 = 0.29 kg. In addition, given that the cantilever end of 
the loaded cylinder sample has a flange with a mass of about 100 g, the simulation load of 
the loaded cylinder sample is determined to be 200 g.

3 FINITE ELEMENT SIMULATION ANALYSIS
In order to bring our engineering analysis closer to reality, the construction of the finite element 
analysis model mainly follows the principles of uniform dimensions, reasonable energy and load 
equivalence. The energy equivalent of the finite element model is embodied in the mass and stiff-
ness equivalents. The meshing on the key force or heat transfer path should be more compact 
in order to accurately reflect the forces and thermal loads and ensure the equivalent stiffness of 
the structure; regardless of whether the load is static or dynamic, the point of application of the 
vector load, the size of the load, and the direction of the load should be handled. The magnitude 
and position of the scalar load must be exactly equivalent, and must be consistent with the actual 
project. Based on these principles, the finite element model is established as shown in Figure 5.
In terms of unit division, the loaded cylinder parts (including end flanges) in the finite 
element model all use hexahedral elements with high calculation accuracy. Any part that has

a connection with the loaded cylinder but is not critical (such as a test stand or simulated 
load) is replaced by a boundary constraint or a mass unit, and the connection relationship is 
a rigid connection of rbe2.
Some parameters of the M40J and M55J high-molded composites, based on actual test 
data, are shown in Table 1. The results of the calculation and analysis of the impact load tube 
under gravity are shown in Table 2. The deformation clouds of the load-bearing cylinders for 
the two CFRP materials are shown in Figure 6.
Based on the results of simulation analysis, in combination with the calculated formula 
for the tilt amount of the optical axis, the tilt values of the optical axis of the primary and 
secondary mirrors under the gravity load deformation of the two loaded cylinders are as 
shown in Table 3.
4 LOADED CYLINDER STATIC TEST VERIFICATION
The loaded cylinder was machined with M55J+ cyanate ester carbon-fiber composites, 
mounted on test stands (see Figure 7), and then mounted on precision optical tables with 
optical theodolites. A high-precision mirror (as shown in Figure 8) was used, aligned and 
zeroed using an optical theodolite, and the angle of the mirror recorded as a test reference.
The loaded cylinder sample was put on the left cantilever flange, because the load is thin 
and the shape is symmetrical, so that the deviation between the load center of gravity and the 
rotary axis of the loaded cylinder sample is less than ±1 mm. The angle of the front and rear 
mirrors is recorded again. The angular deviation of the two recordings can be converted into 
the tilting amount for the optical axis of the loaded cylinder.
In the test process, in order to reduce operational error, three groups of tests were con-
ducted; in addition, in order to remove error introduced by the micro-deformation of the test

support under load, the angular difference between the front and rear mirrors was measured 
before and after the load was added, as shown in Table 4.
As indicated in Table 3, the optical axis tilt calculated by the finite element analysis was 
0.727′′. The test results (average 0.77′′) are basically consistent with this result, which verifies 
that the simplified model and the simulation results are credible.
5 CONCLUSION
The test results of the static load deformation of the loaded cylinder specimen are in good 
agreement with the finite element analysis results, effectively validating the reliability of the 
simplified model and the simulation analysis results. The results of finite element analysis 
show that the reliability of the space camera support cylinder has been greatly improved 
with the use of the M55J composite. For the same loaded cylinder model, M55J/cyanate 
ester improves the overall stiffness of the model compared to M40J/epoxy resin composites, 
reducing the tilt of the primary and secondary mirror axes from 1.08287′′ to 0.72723′′. The 
mechanical deformation stability increased by 32.8%.

Experimental investigation of the influence of cutting parameters 
on surface roughness in machining Inconel 718
B. Sarkar, M.M. Reddy & S. Debnath
Curtin University, Miri, Malaysia 
ABSTRACT: We investigated the influence of cutting parameters on surface roughness 
when machining Inconel 718 using a carbide (K5000-U) end mill. A series of experiments 
were carried out to find a suitable range of machining parameters. A design technique 
was used to reduce the number of experiments through differing combinations. Response 
surface methodology was used to develop a predictive model and an analysis of variance 
was employed to validate it. The model was also validated with additional experiments and 
showed good agreement. The results show that a combination of high cutting speed with a 
low feed rate and depth of cut achieved a good surface finish. It was observed that the depth 
of cut had a greater influence on surface quality than the feed rate or cutting speed.
Keywords: Nickel alloy, carbide end mill, surface roughness
1 INTRODUCTION
Nickel alloys are used extensively in the aerospace, automotive, petrochemical, marine, mili-
tary and biomedical industries, as well as in the power plant and nuclear sectors (Pervaiz 
et al., 2014). Because these alloys maintain high strength and hardness at elevated tempera-
tures, machining is difficult to perform. Properties such as low thermal conductivity, high 
strain hardening, high hardness at elevated temperature and high chemical reactivity are 
responsible for the poor machinability rating of nickel alloys (Jawaid et al., 2001). High cut-
ting force and temperature develop at the tool–workpiece interface during machining. The 
high strength and hardness lead to rapid tool wear and poorly machined surfaces (Ezugwu & 
Bonney, 2004). Many researchers have suggested using coated tools where possible to mini-
mize tool wear and improve surface quality (Dudzinski et al., 2004). Ali et al. (2017) studied 
wear behavior in high-speed machining of Inconel 718 with a solid SiAlON milling tool. The 
results show prominent diffusion wear and generation of high temperature at the cutting zone, 
which leads to the severe adhesion of workpieces to the flank and rake faces of the tools. Hao 
et al. (2017) used a SiAlON ceramic tool for milling and revealed that abrasive wear leads 
to poorly machined surfaces at low cutting speeds (50–200 m/min). Ucuna et al. (2015) per-
formed dry milling with Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC)-coated and uncoated carbide tools. 
The result clearly shows that DLC-coated tools generated less Built-Up Edge (BUE) and 
burr formation than the uncoated ones. The literature suggests that tool geometry and cut-
ting parameters have significant influences on the machinability of nickel-based superalloys 
(Pawade et al., 2008; Nalbant et al., 2007; Amini et al., 2014). Cantero et al. (2013) analyzed 
tool wear mechanisms in the turning of Inconel 718 in wet and dry cutting conditions using 
multilayer TiAl/TiAlN-coated carbide tools with different geometrical parameters. They 
reported that at a high velocity of 70 m/min, increasing the side cutting-edge angle reduced 
chipping wear, and avoided BUE and notching. At a lower cutting speed of 50 m/min, the 
tool life increased significantly. Pawade et al. (2007) observed a low degree of work hardening 
for a 20° chamfered edge insert with a cutting speed of 300 mm/min, a feed rate of 0.15 mm/
rev and a depth of cut of 0.50 mm. Cutting parameters also have a significant influence on 

240
machinability and a good combination of cutting parameters can significantly improve the 
machinability of nickel-based superalloys. Zhaopeng et al. (2011) found BUE at a low cut-
ting speed of 20 m/min, which was exacerbated by an increase in cutting speed. Hang et al. 
(2013) also observed BUE formation at a low cutting speed of 25 m/min with TiAlN-coated 
carbide tools. In an experimental study, Liao et al. (2008) suggested that a cutting speed in the 
range of 90–110 m/min is appropriate for slot milling, and 55–135 m/min is suitable for side 
milling of superalloys. Turning with TiCN/Al2O3-coated carbide tool inserts produces excel-
lent surface quality at a cutting speed of 60 m/min (Devillez et al., 2011). Cutting parameters 
are important factors that influence the machined surface quality when cutting nickel-based 
alloys. In this research, the machining of Inconel 718 with a carbide tool was performed in 
end milling to investigate the effect of cutting parameters on surface roughness.
2 EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
This experimental study was conducted in dry cutting conditions using a V30 Horizontal 
CNC machine (Leadwell CNC Corporation, Taiwan). The rectangular workpiece material 
used was Inconel 718 with dimensions of 202 mm × 102 mm × 12 mm. Detailed informa-
tion on the chemical composition of the Inconel 718 alloy is provided in Table 1. Four-flute 
carbide end mills with a helix angle of 55° and a diameter of 8 mm were used for machining. 
A surface roughness tester (Mitutoyo SJ-210) was used to measure the machined surface at 
three different positions. The average surface roughness (Ra) value was recorded.
In the present study, an experimental design with a Central Composite Design (CCD) 
technique was used to minimize the number of experiments. For CCD, the number of experi-
ments required can be determined from Equation 1:

where n represents the number of experiments and k is the total number of parameters

The experimental results are used to develop a predictive model using a Response Surface 
Methodology (RSM). The proposed relationship between the output response and input 
variables can be represented by Equation 2:

sion coefficient bi = 1, 2, 3,… is computed by the regression method using the experimen-
tal results. The significance of factors and their interactions are computed using statistical 
analysis. The optimum response model and setting of parameters are generated according to 
the response model in Equation 2. A total of 20 runs or sets of experiments were conducted 
with different cutting parameters on the basis of CCD. The surface finish was recorded 
at three locations for each run. Table 2 shows the range of cutting parameters used in the

ance (ANOVA). A design expert was used to establish the design matrix and to analyze the 
experimental data.
3 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Table 3 shows the surface roughness value for all 20 combinations of experimental runs. It 
was observed that the temperature at the cutting zone increased due to the increase of the 
cutting parameters during machining. The heat developed at the cutting zone may lead to 
poor surface quality and rapid tool wear.
The experimental results suggested a second-order predictive model for surface roughness.

The developed model was verified using ANOVA. The model’s F-value is 3.78, which 
implies that the model is significant, and the values of ‘Prob > F’, at less than 0.0500, indicate 
that the model terms are significant. On the basis of the ANOVA result, the depth of cut has 
a more significant influence on surface roughness than the cutting speed or feed rate.
Figure 1a shows the perturbation plot for the cutting parameters. The plot indicates that 
surface roughness increases with increasing feed rate and depth of cut, while it decreases with 
an increase in cutting speed. The interaction effect of different cutting parameters on surface 
roughness is shown in Figures 1b, 1c and 1d. Figure 1b indicates that the surface roughness 
increases with an increase in feed rate and decreases with increasing speed. The influences of 
cutting speed and depth of cut on surface roughness are shown in Figure 1c: the graph shows 
that the surface roughness increases with an increase of depth of cut and decreases with 
increasing cutting speed. The effects of feed rate and depth of cut on surface roughness are

presented in Figure 1d, which indicates that the surface roughness increases with an increase 
of feed rate or depth of cut.
Figures 2a and 2b show surface roughness vs spindle speed and feed rate at a depth of cut 
of 0.275 mm. They show a good surface finish with increasing spindle speed, but a poorer 
finish with increasing feed rate. Figures 2c and 2d plot surface roughness vs spindle speed 
and depth of cut at a feed rate of 75 mm/rev. Surface roughness increases with an increase in 
depth of cut and decreases with an increase in cutting speed. Figures 2e and 2f show surface 
roughness vs feed rate and depth of cut at a spindle speed of 650 rpm: surface roughness 
increases with increasing feed rate and depth of cut. From these diagrams, it may be observed 
that poor surface roughness was generated due to an increase in feed rate and depth of cut, 
while surface roughness was improved with an increase of cutting speed.
Depth of cut is the most influential parameter on surface roughness, followed by cutting 
speed and feed rate. The lowest surface roughness was observed at a spindle speed of 1100 
rpm; in other words, a cutting speed of 28 m/min, a depth of cut of 0.05 mm and a feed rate 
of 30 mm/rev.

5 CONCLUSIONS
The effect of machining parameters (cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut) on surface 
roughness was experimentally investigated and a mathematical predictive model developed 
using RSM for Inconel 718. The validity of the model was verified by ANOVA. The experi-
mental validation shows close agreement with the model. The results show that a good sur-
face finish is obtained at a higher cutting speed, low feed rate and low depth of cut in the 
selected range of cutting parameters.

ABSTRACT: The present investigation includes the study of the Friction Stir Welding 
(FSW) of aluminum alloys in order to determine the optimum parameters of welding, such 
as tool rotation speed, tool materials and the number of passes needed to meet the objective 
of maximizing the hardness of the weld zone. A large number of interactions exist at different 
levels between the various parameters selected, so in order to perform the minimum amount 
of experimentation with optimum results, a Design of Experiments (DOE) approach was 
employed. In order to attain the target and optimize the results, Taguchi’s DOE approach 
and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were employed. After a literature survey, the appropri-
ate orthogonal array L-9 was selected and the experimentation was performed at three lev-
els. Following this, an experimentation analysis of the result was undertaken using Minitab 
15 statistical software to find the effect of the variation and percentage contribution of each 
factor. The experimentation was carried out to maximize the hardness of the welded zone.

1 INTRODUCTION
Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a joining process in a solid state in which a non-consumable 
rotating tool is used to join two facing surfaces. Temperature is produced between the tool and 
the material due to the rubbing action between them and this creates a very soft region near 
the FSW tool. At that point the two bits of metal are mechanically intermixed at the site of 
the joint, at which point the mollified metal (because of the hoisted temperature) can be joined 
by utilizing the mechanical weight, which is connected by the apparatus, much like a joining 
clay or mixture (Bahrami et al., 2004). The strong state nature of FSW prompts a few focal 
points over combination welding strategies as issues related with cooling from the fluid stage 
are evaded. Deformities, for example, porosity, solute redistribution, cementing breaking and 
liquation splitting, do not emerge in FSW (Balasubramanian, 2008). By and large, FSW has 
been found to create a low convergence of deformities and is extremely tolerant of varieties in 
parameters and materials. FSW has numerous applications, such as for freezer panels, panels 
for deck and divider construction, Apple’s cutting edge iMac, China’s high speed railway car-
riages, NASA’s Orion Spacecraft and so forth. During FSW a non-consumable rotating tool 
with a specially designed pin and shoulder is inserted into the abutting edges of the sheets 
or plates to be joined and traversed along the line of the joint (Biallas et al., 1999; Bradshaw 
et al., 1998; Bussu et al. 1999; Casalino et al., 2013). The length of the pin is slightly less than 
the weld depth required and the tool shoulder should be in intimate contact with the work 

246
piece surface. The pin is then moved against the work piece. The half-plate, where the direc-
tion of the tool rotation is the same as that of the welding, is called the advancing side, while 
the other side is designated as being the retreating side (Cavaliere et al., 2008; Cavaliere et al., 
2009; Cederqvist et al. 2001; Colwell et al. 2013; Elangovan et al. 2007). The proceeding side is 
on the right, where the tool rotation direction is the same as the tool travel direction (reverse 
to the direction of metal flow) and the retreating side is on the left, where the tool rotation is 
opposite the tool travel direction (parallel to the direction of metal flow).
2 PROBLEM FORMULATION
The selection of parameters and their interactions is as per Taguchi’s orthogonal arrays. The 
array has been designed in such a way that it can handle maximum numbers of factors in 
definite numbers of experimental runs, as compared to full factorial design. The columns are 
balanced and are of an orthogonal nature. This means that in each pair of columns, all of 
the factor combinations happen an equal number of times. The orthogonal designs allow the 
evaluation of the influence of each factor on the response independently of all other factors. 
When the degrees of freedom are known, then it is easy to select an orthogonal array.
3 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
The procedure used by the Taguchi method is that firstly the objective function is defined, 
then the selection of the parameters is considered, which will affect the system performance. 
Once these tasks are completed, the next assignment is to explain the number levels and the 
total degree of freedom. Then the experimental run, as per the defined levels of the param-
eters, is performed, and then the results are analyzed in order to find out the effects of the 
different parameters.
In the present study, the objective function is to maximize hardness and get a fine micro-
structure. In this research, the S/N ratio is used to measure the quality of the characteristics 
and the significant machining parameters through Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and “F” 
test values. The experimental results are confirmed having hardness as Higher the Better values.

3.1.2 Tool material
The three tool materials that are used for welding the work piece are Mild Steel, High-Speed 
Steel (HSS or HS) and High Carbon High Chromium.
3.2 Sample preparation
Before going for welding on a vertical milling machine, the samples were prepared according 
to requirement on a power hacksaw, machined from the edges and then grinded to get them 
to fit in the vice. To get a good weld, the joint edges of the plates were matched properly (face 
to face). Properly matched edges are imperative for a good quality weld; failure to do this can 
lead to defects.
3.3 Tool geometry for FSW
The standard tool geometry of an FSW tool is shown in Figure 2. It is a single piece tool hav-
ing three main parts. It is prepared by the turning of a 20 mm diameter mild steel rod. Both the 
shank diameter and the shoulder diameter will be 16 mm, and the pin diameter and pin length 
are 5 mm.

4 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE
During the experimentation, the two AA 6070 plates with dimensions 110 × 40 × 6 mm (L × b 
× t) respectively are placed on a vice in a manner that prevents the displacement of the plates 
during welding and fixed along the travel line of the welding tool. The tool is fixed firmly in the 
tool collect of respective dimension and rotated at the required rpm. The tool pin is plunged ver-
tically into the joint line between the work pieces, while the tool is rotating. Due to the velocity 
difference between the rotating tool and the stationary work piece, heat is produced by frictional 
work and material deformation begins. To perform the welding, the rotating tool is traversed 
along the line, while the shoulder of the tool remains in intimate contact with the plate surface. 
The shoulder confirms the underlying material so that void formation and porosity behind the 
probe are prevented. As the heat is transferred into the surrounding material, the temperature 
rises and the material softens without reaching the melting point (hence known as solid state 
process). As the pin is moved in the direction of the welding, the leading face of the pin, assisted 
by a specified pin profile, forces the plasticized material to the back of the pin while applying a 
substantial forging force to consolidate the weld metal. When the weld distance is covered, the 
tool is pulled out of the work piece, leaving behind an exit hole as a footprint of the tool.

5.1.1 Analysis of variance for Vickers hardness
The results were analyzed using ANOVA in order to identify the significant factors affecting 
the Vickers hardness. The ANOVA for Vickers hardness at a 95% confidence interval is given. 
The variation data for each factor and their interactions were F-tested to find the significance 
of each. The principle of the F-test is that the larger the F value for a particular parameter, 
the greater the effect on the performance characteristic due to the change in that process 
parameter. The ANOVA Table shows that rotational speed (F 11.09 value), tool material 
(F 3.39 value) and no. of passes (F 11.74 value) are the factors that significantly affect the 
hardness. The type of pass has the highest contribution to hardness. The results of the main 
effects for S/N ratio to hardness are shown in Figures 3 and 4, which show the variation of 
hardness with the input parameters.
6 CONCLUSIONS
The present experimentation of friction stir welding was performed on AA6063, which is 
widely used in the automobile industry, aircraft industry and ship manufacturing. The fol-
lowing was concluded from the results:

250
• The process parameters that significantly affect hardness are tool rotational speed, tool 
material and type of pass affect.

ABSTRACT: The mechanical properties of origami folding pattern core sandwich plates 
made of AlSi10Mg aluminum alloy have been investigated in this paper. The sandwich panel 
was fabricated using 3D printing technology and tested under a quasi-static out-of-plane com-
pressive load. An explicit Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of Miura-ori models was developed 
and validated using the experimental results. Furthermore, parametric studies were performed 
on Miura-ori models that were subjected to quasi-static out-of-plane compression, through 
which the relationships between the mechanical properties and the geometric parameters were 
established. The results show that the compressive strength of the sandwich structure with a 
Miura-ori core decreased approximately linearly with the increase of the folding angle, and first 
increased and then decreased with the increase of the dihedral angle α. Finally, the mechani-
cal properties of sandwich structures with a Miura-ori core and with a zigzag-based core were 
compared. It was shown that they have almost equal performance in terms of compressive force.

1 INTRODUCTION
Sandwich structures are widely used in the aerospace and automotive industries due to their 
high stiffness/weight ratio and energy absorption capacity (Wadley et al., 2003). Typical sand-
wich structures consist of two thin, stiff and strong face sheets separated by a lightweight 
core. The mechanical behavior of sandwich structures depends on the material used for con-
struction, the geometry of the face sheets and, especially, the core topology design. Rigid 
origami materials have attracted interest for the innovative design of mechanical metamateri-
als (Li & Wang, 2017). Investigations were carried out on sandwich structures that had an 
origami structure as their core, and they were found to improve shell bending stiffness and 
give higher strength/weight ratios (Kilchert et al., 2014). Compared to conventional foam 
and honeycomb-based structures, origami-based sandwich structures provide a good interior 
space for multiple functions, such as cross-flow heat exchange, shape morphing and high 
intensity dynamic load protection (Kooistra et al., 2004). Miura-ori is a classic origami fold-
ing pattern whose main constituents are parallelogram facets.
Miura-ori based fold cores have been regarded as a potential substitute for conventional 
honeycomb cores due to their excellent properties, such as a simple structure and continuously 

252
adjustable stiffness. As a result, many studies on Miura-ori inspired folded core sandwich struc-
tures are available in the literature. Heimbs et al. (2010) studied the mechanical behavior under 
compression, shear and impact loads of the folded cores made from prepreg sheets of carbon 
fiber/aramid fiber. Zhou et al. (2014) presented a parametric study on the mechanical properties 
of a variety of Miura-based folded core models that were virtually tested by quasi-static com-
pression, shear and bending using the finite element method. Baranger et al. (2011) studied the 
out-of-plane compression performance of individual Miura-ori origami cores through experi-
ments and calculations. In addition, Eidini & Paulino (2015) present a technique for creating 
zigzag-based mechanical metamaterials by combining origami folding techniques with kirigami. 
The studies preserve the remarkable properties of Miura-ori and expand on its design space. The 
zigzag-based folded material is appropriate for a wide range of applications, from mechanical 
metamaterials to deployable structures. However, few articles have studied the effect of origami 
core parameters on the mechanical properties of the AlSi10Mg sandwich structure and whether 
having an origami configuration as the folded core leads to better mechanical properties.
In this paper, the sandwich structures with Miura-ori based cores and zigzag-based 
cores using AlSi10Mg aluminum alloy by 3D printing technique. The detailed mechanical 
responses of the sandwich structures under a compressive load were studied by means of 
experiments and finite elements. The compressive load was measured and used to verify the 
accuracy of the numerical results. The influences of the folded core’s topology parameters on 
the performance of the sandwich structures were investigated, based on the FEA simulations. 
Finally, the mechanical characteristics of the two structures, both the Miura-ori based core 
and the zigzag-based folded core, were compared and analyzed.
2 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE AND METHODS
2.1 The geometry of Miura-ori and zigzag-based cores
The Miura-ori pattern can be constructed by the tessellation of multiple units. A unit consists 
of four identical parallelograms, as seen in Figure 1(a). The mountain and valley crease lines 
are marked as solid and dotted lines, respectively. For the sake of simplicity, in this paper, we 
set the length of the connected sides of the parallelogram to be equal and the length of the 
side is defined as a = b = l. Its folding motion can be described by the folding angle ϕ and the 
dihedral angle a. From the geometric relations, it can be seen that the angles α, β and ϕ are

not completely independent. The rigid folding motion of the patterned sheet can be repre-
sented (Qiao, 2016) as follows:

when the height H is given as a constant 10 mm and the motion of the unit only depends on 
the angle α and angle ϕ.
Figure 1(b) shows the BCHn (Basic unit Cell with Hole) zigzag-based pattern. The top 
view is of a V-shaped fold, including two identical parallelogram facets connected along the 
ridges with length a. Its geometry can be defined by the facet parameters a, b, and α, and by 
the folding angle ϕ. The length of the side is defined as a = b = l, the same as the Miura-ori 
parameter definition. Two different scales of V-shapes, with the same angle ϕ, are connected 
along joining fold lines. The length b of the parallelogram facets in the left zigzag strip of 
V-shapes is half that of the strip on the right in the unit cell shown.
2.2 Sample preparation
In order to simplify the simulation calculation, the origami core unit cell was selected as the 
research object. The relative density ( )
ρ)  of the folded core is calculated as:

where, ρc, tm, Sm and ρm are, respectively, the core density, the thickness of the folded core, 
total area and material density. Su is the base area of the unit cell and H is the height of the 
unit cell as a constant 10 mm. The relative density ρ  is equal to 0.2, and this is used for all of 
the models studied in this paper. The proposed sandwich core structures are fabricated using 
a 3D printer, as shown in Figure 2(a). Both the faces and the core are assumed to be made 
of AlSi10Mg aluminum alloy. The detailed material parameters are summarized in Table 1 
(Kempen et al., 2012). The structural unit cell parameters of the prepared origami sandwich 
structure are shown in Table 2.
2.3 Measurement of mechanical properties
The compression test on the sandwich structures with an origami folding pattern core of 
AlSi10Mg aluminum alloy was performed on a universal testing machine INSTRON 3369. 
Figure 2. Fabrication and compression test of the origami folding pattern core sandwich plates.

254
The testing device is shown in Figure 2(b). The lower plate is completely fixed, and the uni-
form compressive load is exerted through the upper plate, with an applied nominal displace-
ment rate of 0.5 mm/min at the ambient temperature. The compressive stress-strain curve and 
the force-displacement curve are recorded. Finally, in order to explore the structural changes 
of the Al-based folded core during the compression process, a digital camera was used to 
record the deformation process under different strains. The experimental data showed good 
consistency with the simulation results from Figure 3(a).
2.4 Characteristics of compressive responses
The deformation behaviors in the compression are shown in Figure 3(b). It can be seen that 
the stress-strain curve of the A1-based origami sandwich structure is similar to that of gen-
eral metal porous materials (Maskery et al., 2016), and it also has three distinct stages, i.e. 
elastic zone, plateau zone and densification zone. In the first stage, the folded cores exhibited 
linear-elasticity up to the yielding point where the peak load was reached. This was followed 
by strain hardening, where localized buckling instability occurred in the folded core panel 
corresponding to the load, which began to decline as the displacement increased. As the 
compressive load increased, the buckling panel would deform further and come into contact 
with the adjacent panels to form new supports. In the final stage, the folded core of the entire 
structure was completely compacted resulting in the stress being raised rapidly.
2.5 FEA models
In order to investigate the effects of geometric parameters on the mechanical properties under 
out-of-plane compression, a numerical analysis model was created through LS-DYNA. The 
FEA model was meshed with four-node shell elements according to the defined element size. 
Two rigid faces were applied to the upper and lower panels of the sandwich structure and a 
displacement load was applied to the upper rigid face. The lower rigid face was limited by dis-
placement constraints. For quasi-static loading cases, the strain rate effect is not considered.
2.6 Influence of unit cell parameters on the deformation of the Miura-ori core
It can be seen from Figure 4 that when the height of the rod unit structure and the deployment 
angle are not changed, the compressive strength of the sandwich structure with the Miura-
based folded core will decrease approximately linearly with the increase of the deployment 
angle. When the included angle is 30°, the compressive strength of the structure is 7.4 MPa, 
and when the included angle is 70°, the compressive strength of the structure is only 2.8 MPa. 
Figure 5 shows that when the height of the rod unit structure and the angle of the two faces 
are constant, the compressive strength of the sandwich structure with the Miura-based folded

core will firstly increase and then decrease with the increase of the expansion angle α. The 
maximum value is reached at around 67°.
2.7 Comparison between Miura-ori and zigzag-based cores of equal areal density
In this section, the mechanical properties of the Miura-ori cores are compared to BCHn pat-
tern cores with the same relative density, i.e. 0.2 ρm. The detailed structural parameters can be 
seen in Table 2. Figure 6 shows the compression stress-strain curves of two structures with 
Miura-ori and BCHn-based cores. The yield points of the two structures are very similar, 
indicating that they have the same load bearing capacity. Therefore, when two sandwich plates 
are used as a structure in applications, the sandwich structure with the BCHn pattern core may 
have more advantages, because of the hole, for multiple functions, such as alignment.
3 CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, the sandwich plates with Miura-ori and zigzag-based cores of AlSi10Mg alumi-
num alloy were fabricated using 3D printing technology. Quasi-static out-of-plane compressive 
tests were conducted on the manufactured specimens. FEA models of the structural unit cell 
with a folded core were developed and validated with the experimental results. The effects of 
geometric parameters on the mechanical properties of the Miura-ori structure were investi-
gated. The results showed that the compressive strength of the sandwich structure decreased 
approximately linearly with the increase of the folding angle, and firstly increased and then 
decreased with the increase of the dihedral angle α. Finally, the models with a Miura-ori core 
and with a zigzag-based core were compared. The deformation patterns were almost the same.

on the gyroscope

ABSTRACT: The crawler robot has the advantages of small grounding pressure, wide sup-
porting area and better maneuvering characteristics; it is suitable for working in complex 
environments such as soft ground and muddy roads. But achieving accurate steering control 
of crawler robots is still a technical problem when the crawler is used as the robot moving 
chassis. According to the theory of steering dynamics, we analyzed the steering character-
istics of the crawler robot and knew that the current output from the motor on both sides 
of the crawler affects the longitudinal speed, lateral speed and steering angle of the crawler 
robot. Therefore, we designed the detailed scheme of the crawler robot steering control sys-
tem and achieved control of the current output from the motor on both sides of the crawler 
based on the dSPACE hardware-in-the-loop simulation control platform. Considering the 
gyroscope as the steering control angle detection component, it plays a key role in the accu-
racy and rapidity of the steering angle control in the robot steering control. So, we designed 
the gyroscope dynamic performance test system and the specific experiment for the gyro-
scope rotation dynamics. The experimental results show that the steady-state error of the 
gyroscope angle is 0.8 degree. The error range can meet the measurement requirements of the 
steering angle of the crawler robot, and precise control of the robot steering can be realized.

1 INTRODUCTION
With the continuous development of mobile robot technology, the application range and 
functions of mobile robots have been greatly expanded and improved and have been widely 
used in the fields of industry, agriculture, national defense, medical care, rescue, and service. 
There are many types of mobile robots, and the movement methods of the robot can be 
divided into wheel type, leg type, led-wheel type, crawler type (Huang et al., 2015) and so on. 
Among them, the crawler robot is different from the general wheeled or leg robots. It has the 
advantages of small grounding pressure, wide supporting area and better maneuvering char-
acteristics (Chen & Chen, 2007) and it is suitable for working in complex environments such 
as soft ground and muddy roads. But achieving accurate steering control of crawler robots is 
still a technical problem when the crawler was used as the robot moving chassis. Therefore, it 
is of great significance to study the steering control of crawler robots.
Unlike other mobile robots, crawler robots realize the steering function by using the sliding 
mechanism of the crawler and the ground. During the steering process, the large steering resist-
ance torque is generated by the wide contact area between the crawler and the ground. And the 
imbalance between the steering resistance torque and the motor output torque causes a large 
non-systematic error, which affects the accuracy and flexibility of the steering of the robot 
(Gao, J. 2015). At present, there is much research on the steering characteristics of crawler 
robots. But most of this is in the theoretical research stage and there is relatively little literature 
on experimental research on the steering performance of crawler robots. Chen et al. (2007) 
established a vehicle motion control system model based on the control system simulation 

260
platform and did simulation analysis of the steering characteristics of the robot under different 
rotational speeds and different turning radii. The correctness of the model was verified. Rao 
et al. (2015) established the steering resistance torque model of the crawler robot at low speed 
and high speed steering and analyzed the steering parameters of the robot’s structural param-
eters, steering radius, steering power and flexibility during large radius and small radius steering 
motions. The model is simulated and the variation law between the steering radius, steering 
power, slip angle and steering flexibility of the robot is obtained, but the steering performance 
is not verified by experiments. Rui et al. (2015) comprehensively tested the crawler and acquisi-
tion methods of the steering performance parameters of the crawler robot, and proposed a 
method of measuring the steering trajectory using the GPS-based steering performance test 
system to obtain the actual turning radius of the crawler vehicle. They combined the NI test 
system, storage speed torque meter and other devices to achieve the test for the steering per-
formance parameters of the robot. The test result of the steering performance of the robot is 
very good, but the test cost is too high.
In summary, the main purpose of the current steering performance test of the crawler vehi-
cle is still based on the steering performance of the vehicle. Usually, the steering performance 
parameters of one or several turning radii are mainly tested, and then the relevant parameter 
model is established. Finally, the model is verified by simulation experiments. However, the spe-
cific experimental verification is lacking. In order to realize the comprehensive and systematic 
research on the steering characteristics of the crawler robot, this paper first analyzes the steering 
characteristics of the crawler robot from the perspective of steering kinematics and dynamics, 
and shows the steering system control scheme of the crawler robot. Considering the gyroscope 
as the steering control angle detection component which plays a key role in the accuracy and 
rapidity of the steering angle control in the robot steering control, the gyroscope dynamic per-
formance test system is designed, and a specific experiment is designed to analyze the gyroscope 
rotation dynamic characteristics. Finally, the experimental results are analyzed and studied.
2 STEERING DYNAMICS ANALYSIS OF THE CRAWLER ROBOT
Since the crawler is selected as the robot moving chassis, precise motion control is the key to 
the effectiveness of the steering control of the crawler robot. Therefore, before the control of 
the crawler robot, it is necessary to perform kinematics and dynamics analysis on the robot 
mobile platform, obtain its dynamic model, and then add it to the steering motion controller. 
In this paper, we use the force dynamic equilibrium method (Xu & Zhou, 2008) to determine 
the dynamic model of the crawler platform.
Assuming that the crawler robot is running on a horizontal plane, any moment of its 
motion can be regarded as the rotation around a certain point P. The point P is called the 
instantaneous center of rotation of the crawler robot, referred to as the instantaneous center. 
When the robot moves in a straight line, the instantaneous center P can be considered to be 
at infinity. Figure 1 depicts the motion diagram of the crawler robot moving platform. In 
Figure 1. Motion schematic diagram of the crawler robot mobile platform.

Figure 1, L is the length of the crawler and ground contact section, O’ is the geometric center 
of the robot platform, R is the instantaneous turning radius of point O’, Vh and Vw are the 
longitudinal forward speed and the lateral sliding velocity of the robot platform, and ω is 
the rotational angular velocity of the robot platform. The generalized coordinate vector of 
the defined platform is q = [x, y, θ]T, where x, y represents the coordinate value of the platform 
geometric center point O’ in the world coordinate system XOY, and θ represents the angle 
between the platform longitudinal axis and the world coordinate system Y axes. Let the mass 
of the robot platform be m, and the moment of inertia corresponding to O’ is I. Refer to the 
previous research (Xu & Zhou, 2008) in which the dynamic equation of the crawler mobile 
platform is used. And in that equation, G is the gravity of the crawler platform at the O’ point, 
u is the platform steering resistance coefficient, f is the running resistance coefficient, io is the 
current output by the outer crawler motor, ii is the current output by the inner crawler motor, k 
is the conversion coefficient between the motor output torque, the transmission efficiency and 
the transmission ratio of the driving wheel are constant values, andρ is the middle convert of

3 THE SCHEME OF THE STEERING CONTROL SYSTEM
As shown in Figure 2, the steering control system of the crawler robot is a double closed-loop 
control system and consists of a tracked robot moving platform, a angle controller, two speed 
controllers, two motors, two incremental encoders, and an MPU6050 gyroscope.
In the steering control system of the crawler robot, the attitude angle control loop is used 
as the outer loop, and the motor speed control loop on both sides of the crawler is used as 
the inner loop, and the control system is realized based on a dSPACE hardware-in-the-loop 
simulation control platform. In the outer loop, the angle of deviation Δθ from the reference 
angle θd and the feedback angle θf is converted into the reference speed ωd, wherein, the ref-
erence angle θd is given by the task decision layer or is set by itself, and the feedback angle 
θf is measured using the MPU6050 gyro sensor. In the inner loop, the reference speed ωd is 
respectively used as the reference speed of the closed-loop control of the motor speed on 
both sides, and the speed deviation Δω1 from the reference speed ωd and the feedback speed 
ωf1 which is measured by the incremental encoder1 controls the left motor through the speed 
controller1. In the same way, the speed deviation Δω2 from the reference speed ωd and the 
feedback speed ωf2 which is measured by the incremental encoder2 controls the right motor 
through the speed controller2. This makes it possible to carry out differential control of the 
two-sided motor of the robot, thereby realizing steering control of the crawler robot. How-
ever, in order to achieve accurate and effective steering control of the crawler robot, accurate 
angle control must be achieved. To achieve precise angle control, it is necessary to realize the 
angle measurement. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the dynamic characteristics of the 
attitude angle of the gyro sensor.

4 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN FOR THE GYRO DYNAMIC ANALYSIS
4.1 Test system of the gyro dynamic characteristics
The test system is shown in Figure 3. The system uses a single shaft servo turntable placed 
on an independent foundation as the experimental platform, a dSPACE/MicroAutoBoxII 
controller as the control platform, and a ControlDesk NG as the data recording, online 
observation, and processing platform. When in use, the gyroscope is installed perpendicular 
to the plane of the turntable using a special fixture. The rotation speed signal of the turntable 
is connected to the servo motor on the turntable shaft through the calibration network and 
servo driver to form a servo control loop.
4.2 Test method of the gyro dynamic characteristic
The gyro angle dynamic characteristic test experiment takes the output angle of the single-
axis servo motor as the reference angle, fixes the gyro sensor on the single-axis servo motor 
shaft, makes the gyroscope geometric center and the servo motor shaft coaxial, and makes 
the electricity for the controller, the gyro, the instrument and servo motor turntable. The 
experiment mainly tests the dynamic characteristics of the gyro sensor following the servo 
motor start acceleration phase, and the virtual operation software ControlDesk NG records 
the angle value of the gyro sensor output and the dynamic response time of the gyroscope 
following the turning of the servo motor. In order to fully investigate the angular error of the 
gyro sensor at small angles and large angles, the experiment is performed at various angles 
differing by 30 degrees between 0 and 360 degrees. Each angle is tested three times, and the 
test at different angles includes forward and reverse rotations.
5 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
In the case of forward rotation, the angle measured mean is obtained from the measured gyro 
angle and the dynamic response time at the corresponding rotation angle, and the relative 
error of each angle is obtained according to the angle measured mean and the servo motor 
reference angle value. The calculation results are shown in Table 1. The reverse situation is the 
same as the forward rotation, and the relative error is also obtained from the angle measured 
mean. The calculation results are shown in Table 2.
Figure 3. Test system of gyro dynamic characteristics.

263
The average of the relative errors in the forward and reverse directions was measured, and 
from this we get: in the case of forward rotation, the average relative error of the angle is 
0.77%; in the case of reverse, the error is 0.56%.
6 CONCLUSION
In this paper, according to the theory of steering dynamics, the steering characteristics of 
the crawler robot were analyzed. Then the detailed scheme of the steering control system of 
the crawler robot is given and the dynamic performance test of the gyroscope was designed. 
The experimental results show that the steady-state error of the gyroscope angle is less than 
0.8%. The results show that the steady-state error of the gyroscope is 0.8 degrees. The angle 
error range can meet the measurement requirements of the steering angle of the crawler 
robot.

ABSTRACT: In this era of depleting natural resources, renewable energy resources 
like solar power must be captured effectively to meet future power needs. As far India is 
considered, the installed electrical power capacity is 329.20 GW. Out of this, only 12.28 GW 
is supplied by solar power plants. One of the main reasons for the poor output from solar 
farms is the dust deposition on solar panels. Different observations of the effect of dust and 
other particles on solar panels states that the efficiency of solar farms will reduce drastically. 
To get the maximum output from solar panels, frequent cleaning is necessary. This work 
focuses on the design, development and analysis of portable solar panel cleaning equipment 
which can be installed in any kind of solar Photovoltaic (PV) farm.

1 INTRODUCTION
The use of electricity is increasing every day. But generation is not on par with consumption. 
There are two main general categories of electricity generation—renewable and non-renew-
able energy sources. Solar PV systems, wind energy systems, hydro power plants, biomass 
and geothermal power plants come under renewable energy sources. But when considering 
the present scenario, hydro power plants must be considered under non-renewable energy 
sources since the availability of water is reducing day by day (El-Shobokshy & Hussein, 
1993). Coal, oil, and natural gas, which come under the fossil fuel category, can be mentioned 
as non-renewable energy sources. In India, 59.2% of the total power generation is contributed 
by thermal power plants which mainly use coal. About 14.8% is contributed by hydro power 
plants and only 16% of total power generation is contributed by renewable energy sources 
which include solar PV, wind energy and biomass (Goossens et al., 1993). Depending more 
on non-renewable energy sources is no longer sustainable under current demand profiles. The 
importance of renewable energy sources is increasing each day. Out of the available renewable 
energy sources, solar PV is easily available everywhere with very little one-time investment. 
Dust accumulation is a significant problem for the solar power industry, so several different 

266
types of solar panel cleaning solutions are available across the world. Most of them are 
constrained to only one particular solar farm and the same system cannot be installed directly 
on other solar farms with different type of solar panels and ground structure (Shobokshy & 
Hussein 1993; Sulaiman et al., 2011; Garg, 1973). Eccopia is one of the famous companies 
which provides solar panel cleaning solutions. It uses a simple rail-like structure in which the 
cleaning head moves across a bank of panels of size 1600 mm × 990 mm (Eccopia E4). It’s a 
dry cleaning method and it uses a microfiber cloth to clean the solar panels. Another model 
is the Serbot Swiss Innovations (SERBOT Swiss Innovations) Geeko Solar Farm in which 
a ground vehicle is used to carry water and other necessary supplies to clean solar panels. A 
large brush in size of 2 to 3 moves above the solar panels to clean them. Another model from 
the same brand is Geeko Solar which is used to clean rooftop solar panels. This uses a mini 
robot-like device which moves above the panels to perform cleaning. Clean Solar Solutions 
(Clean Solar Solutions) is a UK based solar panel cleaning company that offers automated 
cleaning solutions for solar panels. They have various solutions for cleaning solar panels such 
as spray systems, manual cleaning using hoses and water with specially designed brushes, and 
semi-automated cleaning for solar farms. This robot is similar to SERBOT Swiss innova-
tions. The dimensions of the robot are equal to the width of the panel row. The dirt is cleaned 
by combining rotating brushes with water. In this work, a solar panel cleaning robot has been 
developed. It is capable of adapting for any kind of solar farms and easily programmable. 
The main advantage is that it can be transported to any location of solar farm with ease. This 
robot is capable of tracking the edges of the solar panels to move in a straight direction and 
it can turn once it reaches any edge of panels.
2  SOLAR PANEL CLEANING ROBOT AND STANDARD SOLAR 
PANEL DIMENSIONS
A standard solar panel with the most common dimensions has been selected for the test-
ing and design of a solar panel cleaning robot. Table  1 details the standard solar panel 
dimensions.
Table 2 details the dimensions of the cleaning robot. Consider if the solar panels are kept 
vertical, from the dimensions it can be stated that the robot can clean more than half of a sin-
gle solar panel on one path since the length of brush is more than half of the breadth of the 
solar panel. On the return path, it can clean the remaining area. There are a few other options 
when designing the brush for the cleaning robot. Designing a brush for the entire breadth of 
solar panel will be a tedious task and it cannot be fabricated so easily. If the length of brush is 
kept below that of half of the solar panel width, it requires more than three trips to complete 
the cleaning of a single panel. A brush with more than half the width of the solar panel will 
be a good option and that has been fabricated.

3 SELECTION OF OPTIMUM CLEANING MECHANISM
The major dust seen on solar panels are fine particles of soil, sand, dust carried by wind, 
and bird droppings. It is possible to avoid bird droppings since the chance of birds coming 
to solar farms is less. To clean the remaining dust particles, a simple scrubbing mechanism 
will do the work. A set of cylindrical brushes with fine nylon bristles can be selected to clean 
the solar panels. Hard bristles will damage the solar panels and their efficiency may reduce. 
An occasional cleaning using water is preferred so that it can wipe off all those hard dust 
particles which are stuck on the panels. The cleaning method selected here is finalized after 
many tests and trial runs. The type of brush is decided initially and the type of bristles used 
and their grade is decided after trial runs. This brush consists of six rows of bristles with a 
length of 50 mm each. Initially the brushes are driven by a Brushless DC (BLDC) motor with 
a gearbox assembly. Various speeds are set on the BLDC motor and the cleaning efficiency 
is analyzed. At higher speeds, the chance for flying dust is more. The comparison of various 
speeds and pressures applied by brush are discussed in Table 3. The pressure of the brush on 
the solar panel is varied using two linear actuators. Changing the height of the cleaning head 
will result in varying brush pressure on the solar panel.
From Table 3 it is evident that effective cleaning is achieved at 200 rpm when the distance 
between brush and solar panel is kept at 10 mm since it allows the brush bristles to bend a 
little and clean effectively.
4 BLOCK DIAGRAM OF SOLAR PANEL CLEANING ROBOT
A CAD model of the proposed solar panel cleaning robot has been developed in CAD mod-
eling software. Aluminum sheets of the required thickness have been selected and are cut 
to the specific dimensions using a laser cutting technique. These pieces are then bent using 
conventional methods and assembled to form a desired robotic structure. The dimensions 
are same as that mentioned in Table 2. The working robot is controlled by an ATMEGA 
2560 microcontroller. The entire system is powered by a 12 V DC source. Eight infrared sen-
sors are installed at the four corners of the robot to detect the edges of the solar panel for 
tracking a path as well as preventing the robot from falling from the solar panels. Four DC 
geared motors are used in this robot; two for driving the cleaning brushes and two for the 
wheels for robot movement. The motors used to drive the robot are equipped with encoders 
so that precise movement of robot can be achieved. Feedbacks from the encoders is given 
to the microcontrollers to get a closed-loop system. The brush motors are programmed to 
run at a constant speed (200 rpm) in opposite directions. There are two motor drivers each 
capable of driving two motors at a time with bidirectional feature is used to drive four motors 
in this design. The maximum current the driver can withstand is 10 A. The driver unit also

has overcurrent protection as well as blocked rotor detection features. The purpose of the 
linear actuators is to raise or lower the entire unit according to the brush conditions. If the 
robot is equipped with a new set of brushes with long bristles, the clearance required between 
the solar panel and the robot will need to be more. As the brushes deteriorate with use, the 
contact between the brush and the solar panel gets reduced. In such conditions, the entire 
robot can be lowered to make the brush touch the solar panel. This adjustment can be made 
manually using the HMI unit. The linear actuators also have a feedback mechanism which 
gives analog outputs from which the robot can detect the position of the stroke of the linear 
actuator. The feedback from the linear actuators is then given to the microcontroller for a 
close-loop operation. The HMI method used in this robot consists of a Nokia 5110 1.5″ 
84 × 48 display with a backlight. The operator can communicate with the robot through this 
unit. Infrared sensors used to detect the edges of the solar panel and track a path to achieve 
proper cleaning. The selection of motors and linear actuators is done after a thorough study 
on the weight of robot, inclination to be kept and the time required by the robot to travel 
from bottom to top of the solar panel etc. The specifications of the DC geared motor with 
encoder are shown in Table 4. The linear actuators used in this robot are from the Actuonix 
brands L12 series. These linear actuators are driven by DC geared motors with a rack and 
pinion method to achieve linear movement. The specifications of the linear actuators are

5 WORKING AND PROGRAM FLOW
The solar panel cleaning robot is fully controlled by an ATMEGA 2560 microcontroller. 
This controller is programmed in a particular flow such that it will initially check the status 
of the brushes and arrange the height of the robot accordingly. Initially the operator will be 
asked whether to change the brush position or not. If the operator selects yes, the next two 
options will be displayed in the HMI unit. The operator can enter the distance to move the 
robot up or down manually or select any predefined values. After entering these distance 
values, the robot will ask from which corner the clearing should start – either left or right. In 
the next step, robot will start cleaning. The eight infrared sensors placed at the four corners 
of the robot track the edges of the solar panel so it moves straight. If the initial starting side 
is selected as left, the two IR sensors on the left of the robot will act as edge tracking sen-
sors. In normal running conditions, the two edge tracking sensors will be outside the solar 
panel. If they come inside the panel, this will be detected and the corresponding motor speed 
will be varied to keep it on track. Consider a solar array with two panels kept vertical. The 
solar panel cleaning robot is kept on the right side of the panel. From there, it starts moving 
forward tracking the edges of solar panel with the help of the IR sensor. Once it reaches the 
end of second panel, the robot makes a – turn and comes down. Then it moves to the next set 
of panels in that array and the same steps are repeated. Once four of the sensors located at 
front and any of the sides come out, the robot will stop cleaning and stay at the same place. 
This occurs when the robot reaches the end of the last panel in the array. The operator has to 
manually take the robot and put it on the next array to start cleaning it. The major drawback 
mentioned in existing systems is rectified in this model by making small changes in the soft-
ware program to match the solar farm layout. This model is also independent of the number 
or size of solar panels. The programming for the robot’s microcontroller ATMEGA 2560 is 
done using Arduino programming software. The flow of the program is shown in Figure 2. 
Initial coding for the Nokia 5110 display has been done. The first part of the program directs 
the flow to the next section according to inputs from the operator. i.e., if the operator selects 
a brush changing option, the program will jump to the linear actuator section and, after 
executing that task, it will return to the main screen. Once the brush setting is complete, the 
program will shift to the tracking edges and the section activating the motors. The outputs

from IR sensors are used to operate the wheel motors and the output from wheel motor 
encoders is used to obtain a constant speed for the operation. The brush motors are set to run 
constantly at 200 rpm without any changes. The trial run results are really amazing as there 
are no dust particles left on solar panels.
The edges of the panels are neatly cleaned which is a main location for dust to accumulate. 
For hard and stuck dust, the robot is made to run two times on the same route to ensure that 
they are neatly cleaned. This robot can clean one solar panel in 15 seconds which means that 
an array of 20 panels can be cleaned in less than seven minutes taken into consideration the 
time taken by the robot to turn at each end-point. The flowchart for the program is shown 
in Figure 2.
6 RESULTS AND OBSERVATIONS
The following details represent the after effect of dust deposition on the efficiency of solar 
panels. An experimental study of solar farms has been made to understand the exact power 
loss occurring because of dust. Solar farm details are provided in Tables 6 and 7.
These technical specifications of solar farm and solar panels come under standard test 
conditions. In real time application, their efficiency depends on the various factors which 
are mentioned in the previous section. Initially the test is done for one single panel and then 
determined for the entire farm. A single panel is entirely covered with dust to analyze the 
effect on its performance. The maximum and minimum efficiency of a single solar panel 
without dust is 13.36% and 9.25% respectively. The maximum and minimum efficiency of a 
single solar panel with dust is 5.64% and 2.33% respectively. So, if this is considered for the 
whole solar farm, the overall efficiency will be drastically reduced due to the effect of dust. 
The proposed plant’s installed capacity is 1 MW. With the effect of dust, we can expect a loss 
in efficiency of between 30 and40% depending on several factors like the amount of dust, 
the type of dust, and its concentration. By utilizing the proposed solar panel cleaning robot, 
the power drop due to dust deposition can be completely overcome and thereby achieving the 
desired output from the solar panels.

7 CONCLUSIONS
The design and development of a solar panel cleaning robot has been done effectively. From 
the results of trial run, it is found that the cleaning is efficient and less time consuming.
The main advantage of this solar panel clearing method is that it is easily portable and 
adaptable to any kind of solar farms unlike the other permanent fixing methods mentioned 
in the studies. The cleanliness of the solar panel before and after cleaning has been deeply 
studied and it shows that the output from the solar panel after cleaning is 30–40% above 
panels covered with dust.

Application of a factor graph in MEMS IMU self-alignment 
technology
H.F. Xing, H. Yang, C. Wang & M. Guo
Tsinghua University, Beijing, China
ABSTRACT: In this work, we describe a novel and feasible technology for the self-align-
ment of Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) 
on swing bases. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report on the joint 
use of the Rotation Modulation Technique (RMT), Inertial Space Gravity Based Alignment 
(ISGBA) and factor graph for self-alignment in MEMS IMUs. RMT is adopted to suppress 
the impact of inertial sensors bias. Hence ISGBA allows small alignment errors when used 
with RMT under swing condition. As a result, a factor graph is used to further optimize the 
state estimation and solve for attitude angles through a message-passing algorithm. Analysis 
of the experimental data showed that the standard deviations of the pitch, roll, and heading 
solved using the proposed method were 0.011°, 0.008°, and 1.057°, respectively. These results 
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

1 INTRODUCTION
The performance of micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) inertial measurement units 
(IMUs) has greatly improved following advances in science and technology. MEMS IMUs 
have achieved wide commercial applications such as in mobile phones, unmanned aerial vehi-
cles (UAVs) and robots owing to their small size, low cost, and light weight (Deppe et al., 
2017). Therefore, MEMS IMU has always been a burning research topic.
Initial alignment involves calculating the transformation matrix from the body frame to 
the navigation frame, and needs to be performed prior to solving for inertial navigation (Liu 
et al., 2016). Due to the low precision of MEMS gyros, the initial alignment of MEMS IMUs 
generally require the heading information provided by other sensors such as magnetometers 
or satellite receivers (Meiling et al., 2017). The MEMS gyroscope north seeker performs its 
function through a rotation modulation technique (RMT) on a static base without relying 
on other sensors (Iozan et al., 2012). However, the error is significant under swing circum-
stances. The eastward gyro drift has the greatest influence on the heading accuracy, but RMT 
can effectively suppress the effect of the MEMS inertial sensors constant bias that makes it 
possible to achieve alignment on a swing base (Xing et al., 2018). A swing base is defined as a 
disturbing condition, such as a moored ship, or a vehicle affected by engine vibration.
This paper proposes the joint use of RMT, inertial space gravity based alignment (ISGBA) 
and a factor graph to achieve self-alignment in MEMS IMUs on a swing base. A factor graph 
is a typical probability graph model and a multivariate global function that is factored into 
the product of several local functions. The message-passing algorithm for factor graphs is the 
sum-product algorithm (SPA) (Kschischang et al., 2002). Due to the versatility of the factor 
graph message-passing algorithm, it has a wide range of applications in adaptive filtering, 
channel equalization, encoding and decoding, and signal processing (Loeliger, 2004).

274
Hauke Strasdat compares factor graphs with Kalman filter-based algorithms and con-
cludes that factor graphs are more efficient in visual simultaneous localizations and mapping 
(SLAM) applications (Strasdat et al., 2012). Factor graphs can achieve the optimization of 
state in terms of navigation with multi-sensors (Chen et al., 2016). Some scholars developed 
real-time navigation algorithms and systems based on factor graphs, with a system frame-
work that offers good adaptability and flexibility (Chiu et al., 2014, Chiu et al., 2013). Factor 
graphs can visualize the processing of complex data, shows good scalability and flexibility, 
and can greatly save computing resources (Kaess et al., 2008). At present, factor graphs have 
been successfully applied in many fields. The key behind its popularity is that factor graphs 
use natural and human-readable graphical language to express problems (Ta et al., 2014).
This paper introduces factor graphs in the self-alignment process in MEMS IMUs. It was 
used to further optimize attitude estimation based on the results obtained by applying the 
RMT and ISGBA methods.
2 TECHNICAL APPROACH
This section analyzes the self-alignment technology for MEMS IMUs under swing condi-
tion. The technology proposed in this paper involves the joint use of three techniques: RMT, 
ISGBA, and factor graphs. For better explanation of these techniques, definitions of coordi-
nate frames are first provided.
In this paper, the e frame is the earth-fixed frame, the i frame represents inertial frame, the 
n frame is the navigation frame (East-North-Up coordinate frame), the b frame is the body 
frame, the s frame is the IMU frame that rotates synchronously with the IMU while the ib0 
frame is the body inertial frame formed by consolidating the b frame in inertial space. Next, 
we will discuss the key techniques involved in this paper.
2.1 Rotation modulation technique
To simplify the analysis, the RMT principle is analyzed under static condition and it is 
assumed that the b and n frames coincide.
As shown in Figure 1, the counter clockwise direction is defined as the positive direction, 
whereas ω is the angular rate of rotation around the z-axis. The s frame is coincident with the 
b frame at initial time.
Since the RMT has similar effects on the accelerometer bias and the gyro drift, we only 
analyze the gyro drift here. After time t, the gyro drift in the n frame is as shown below:

It can be seen that the bias of the inertial sensor is modulated into a periodic signal in the 
n frame, and integrates to zero in a complete rotation period. The constant bias of inertial 
sensors in the direction of the rotation axis cannot be modulated. This is the basic principle 
of the RMT. Further, to reduce the influence of the scale factor error, this paper uses the 
reciprocating rotation method shown in Figure 1.
2.2 Inertial space gravity based alignment
Given that the rotation speed of the earth is constant, the rotation angle of gravity g in 
the inertial space can be accurately calculated as long as the time is accurate. The direction 
change of g in the inertial space contains the northward information, so the IMU can be 
aligned according to the movement of g in the inertial space.
The purpose of ISGBA in rotary MEMS IMUs is to calculate the transformation matrix

optimization is always needed for better accuracy.
2.3 Factor graph
The factor graph is a graphical model composed of variable nodes, factor nodes, and lines. It 
is intuitive and easy to understand when expressing functions. The basic idea behind this algo-
rithm is connecting the state variables and measurement information using a graph model. 
After the available measurement values are given, the maximum posterior probability (MAP) 
estimate of the joint probability distribution function (PDF) is calculated for all states.
Factor graphs are introduced into state optimization, and SPA, as explained in (Kschis-
chang et al., 2002). The velocity error of the MEMS IMU under swing condition can be used 
as an observation. Therefore, the state model and the observation model can be obtained as

3 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Turntable-based experiment on real data was carried out. As shown in Figure 4a, the MEMS 
IMU was installed on a three-axis turntable with the performance parameters listed in 
Table 1.
We set the parameters of the turntable control program so that the inner frame and the 
middle frame swung and the outer frame can be rotated reciprocally. Table  2  shows the 
parameters. Figure 5 displays the angular rate and acceleration of the MEMS IMU for one 
test. A total of 10 trials were performed to verify the reproducibility. As shown in Figure 4b, 
the actual attitude of the last stop position acquired with a high-end INS, Epsilon 20, was 
used as a reference. The roll, pitch and heading angle obtained using Epsilon20 were about 
0°, 0° and 166° (anticlockwise).
The data were processed from the z-axis rotation until the end of rotation, as shown in 
Figure 5. The ISGBA algorithm was used to deal with the 10 sets of data obtained from the 
turntable experiment, with the results shown in Figure 6. The mean and standard deviation 
(SD) of the attitude angles at the end of alignment obtained using the ISGBA method is 
listed in Table 3.

As can be seen from the Table 3, the difference between the attitude angles calculated 
using the ISGBA algorithm and the real attitude angles obtained using Epsilon20 is small. 
These results are used for further optimization of the state estimation. A factor graph and a 
Kalman filter are used here for the optimal estimation of state. The effect of the two methods 
applied to one test is shown in Figure 7.
The mean and SD of the estimated attitude angles at the last time are shown in Table 4. 
It can be seen that the two optimal methods for the estimation of state can both improve the 
alignment accuracy. However, the factor graph offers slightly better result than Kalman filter, 
thereby verifying the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
4 CONCLUSION
This paper presented a self-aligned technology for MEMS IMUs under swing conditions. The 
RMT, ISGBA algorithm and the factor graph that make up the technology were illustrated 
in detail. The following conclusions can be drawn: (1) The RMT and ISGBA algorithms are 
critical in achieving self-alignment in MEMS IMUs and reduces the alignment error. (2) This 
paper verified that factor graphs can meet the requirements for the optimal estimation of 
state. The standard deviations of the pitch, roll, and heading obtained using the factor graph 
were 0.011°, 0.008°, and 1.057°, respectively. (3) Factor graphs are intuitive and flexible, and 
this is one of the reasons they have become a hot research topic in the field of navigation and 
information fusion in recent years.

The MEMS IMU self-alignment approach proposed in this paper does not require aiding 
sensors such as magnetometers; hence it improves the application range of MEMS IMUs. 
If MEMS inertial sensors with better performance are used, this method can achieve higher 
accuracy. Future work may focus on error analysis and design of a practical rotary MEMS 
IMU.

Modeling and simulation of dynamic fire assignment for aircraft
M. Zhong, R.N. Yang, J. Wu & H. Zhang
Air Force Engineering University, Xi’an Shanxi, China
ABSTRACT: Dynamic Weapon-Target Assignment (DWTA) is crucially important under 
the condition when a limited number of weapons need to be employed immediately. We study 
the problem using the multi-objective optimization model consisting of Static Weapon-Target 
Assignment models (SWTA). The SWTA of the next wave is used as an input by the strike 
effect of the previous wave, and the model is updated. Aiming at the high speed of the algo-
rithm, the Multi-Objective Evolutionary Decomposition Algorithm (MOEA/D) is improved, 
and the conjugate gradient method is mixed to search for optimization. The simulation results 
show that the improved algorithm improves the speed of the algorithm and completes the 
dynamic weapon-target assignment while retaining the advantages of the MOEA/D algorithm.
Keywords: weapon-target assignment, weapons science and technology, decomposition 
multi-objective optimization algorithm, conjugate gradient algorithm
1 INTRODUCTION
Weapon-Target Assignment (WTA) is a process in which weapons are reasonably allocated 
to specific targets, taking into account operational objectives, target characteristics, weapon 
performance and other factors (Zhang et al., 2015). WTA is a pivot in battlefield planning, 
and it is an important factor in determining combat effectiveness (Bayrak et al., 2013). It 
mainly includes Static Weapon-Target Assignment (SWTA) and Dynamic Weapon-Target 
Assignment (DWTA). Traditional SWTA does not take account of time. However, in actual 
combats, the battlefield situation changes rapidly. The DWTA is important for prompt deci-
sion-making in the fast changing battlefield situation.
DWTA is a multi-hit wave assignment model, which consists of several wavelet SWTA. 
The next wave decision-making adjusts and redistributes the target parameters according 
to the results of previous attacks. In recent years, the research on DWTA has been on the rise. 
The goal-based DWTA model (Xin et al., 2010; Xin et al., 2011) and the asset-based DWTA 
model (Hosein & Athans, 1990; Havens, 2002) have been proposed. The DWTA model pro-
posed in this paper considers the target value, threat, weapon cost and other factors to make 
the model closer to the actual combat situation. Threats are associated with time, that is, high 
threat targets that have not been destroyed will be prioritized later on.
The WTA model is a completely Non-deterministic Polynomial (NP) problem, as it cannot 
be directly calculated, except through “guessing” to get the results. Researchers use multi-
objective optimization algorithms and other heuristic algorithms to solve the problem. The 
Decomposition Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA/D) searches by means of randomness. The 
algorithm is not easy to drop into local optimal solutions, but has good convergence and 
uniformity of Pareto optimal solution set. However, due to the real-time and complexity 
of DWTA, the algorithm has higher speed and convergence requirements. In this paper, an 
improved decomposition evolution algorithm based on hybrid conjugate gradient method 
is proposed. The algorithm not only retains the advantages of MOEA/D, but also has good 
convergence. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm improves the compu-
tation speed and convergence over the original algorithm.

2 PROBLEM MODELING
2.1 DWTA model analysis
In actual combat, due to technical constraints, aircrafts cannot launch all the firepower units 
carried in one wave at a time. It is easy to destroy one target with all the firepower, but it will 
reduce the effectiveness of firepower distribution and result in the risk of undestroyed targets 
remaining. Real-time battlefield should divide attacks into multiple waves.
This paper proposes the use of the multi-wave weapon-target assignment model, (DWTA), 
which is based on the traditional WTA model.

The DWTA model consists of several SWTA processes. The input of the model is updated 
according to the attacking effect of the previous wave, the threat of the battlefield, the value 
of the target and other factors, and inputs into the SWTA model to generate a new wave of 
weapon-target assignment scheme. The model is shown in Figure 1.
2.2 Target analysis of pre-strike
Let’s denote n as the number of pre-attack targets is n, and is (I = 1, 2, 3... N) The target 
value. The weight of each target value is determined by the Analytic Hierarchy Process 
(AHP), which constructs the judgment matrix of each index and obtains its corresponding 
eigenvectors. The relative weight of one index to another can be obtained after normalization. 
Assign 1 as unimportant, 3 as equal, 5 as important, 7 as extremely important, between each 
score take 2, 4, 6, the use of expert evaluation of the target value table shown in Table 1.
The target value evaluation table is converted into a matrix of n × n, vi  is the 1/n power of 
the product of each row element in the matrix.

Denote the target threat as Wi (I = 1, 2, 3... N). If the target is not destroyed in this wave, it will 
still be threatened when the aircraft launches fire in the next wave, so the threat of the undestroyed 
target will increase with the times of attack. The threat value of the t-th wave at target i is:

2.4 DWTA optimization model
The DWTA model is based on SWTA model. With the change of attack wave number t, the 
number of each type of firepower unit, attack target state, target threat and other factors 
change accordingly.

284
After the t-wave attack ends, the target parameters are reset according to the battlefield 
feedback. If the target j is destroyed, the target value vj = 0 and the target threat wj = 0. 
The target parameters vj(t + 1) wj(t + 1) Pj(t + 1) are updated to establish the t+1th-order 
firepower model SWTA (t+1).
3 HYBRID CONJUGATE GRADIENT METHOD FOR MOEA/D ALGORITHM
3.1 MOEA/D algorithm
Compared with other kinds of evolutionary algorithms, the core strategy of the MOEA/D algo-
rithm is to decompose the multi-objective optimization problem into several single-objective 
optimization problems, and then perform computations on the decomposed single-objective 
problem (Tan, 2013). Compared with the MOGLS and NSGA-II evolutionary algorithms, 
their sub-problems can co-evolve without repetitive optimization sub-problems, which improves 
computational efficiency (Zhang et al., 2015; Ding, 2012). They also won the 2009 CEC contest 
because of their excellent algorithm performance (Zhang et al., 2009). However, due to its large 
coding length and large population size, the convergence speed of the algorithm is relatively 
slow, and there is still a certain gap between the speed requirements of real-time planning.
3.2 Conjugate gradient method
The conjugate gradient method (Jiang et al., 2007; Hong & Mo, 2009) is a deterministic 
algorithm based on steepest descent method (Wu et al., 2010) and the Newton method (Xue 
et al., 2008). Compared with Newton’s method, it does not need to compute Hesse matrix 
and has good quadratic termination, but it is easy to fall into local optimum when solving 
optimization problems.
3.3 Hybrid evolutionary algorithm
3.3.1 Analysis of hybrid evolutionary algorithm
For solving the multi-wave firepower distribution model DWTA, not only the optimization 
of the algorithm solution is required, but also the real-time planning of each wave firepower 
distribution model is required according to the battlefield feedback. Also, the time window is 
short, and the convergence speed of the algorithm is also required.
According to the characteristics of the two algorithms, the two algorithms can be com-
bined. Combining the advantages of good global convergence of the MOEA/D algorithm 
and fast convergence speed of the conjugate gradient method, a MOEA/D algorithm based 
on the conjugate gradient method is proposed. Previously, some researches have combined 
the conjugate gradient method with the MOEA/D algorithm. In their literature (Gen & 
Cheng, 1997), the conjugate gradient method is used to search all individuals in the popu-
lation of the MOEA/D algorithm, but the computational complexity of the algorithm is 
too large and the speed advantage is lost. In order to improve the searching ability of the 
MOEA/D algorithm, the central individual of the population is used as the initial searching 
point, and the conjugate gradient method is used to search for new individuals, instead of 
the lowest fitness individuals in the original population. Let the population size be n and the 
population individual be a

 then the population center individual a0 is:

3.3.2 Algorithm flow
The MOEA/D algorithm flow of the hybrid conjugate gradient method is as follows:
Step 1: Population initialization
Step 2: Individual neighbor selection

285
Step 3:  Calculating the fitness value, selecting the individual a0 of the population center
Step 4:  Searching the initial search point a0 using the conjugate gradient method, and after 
reaching the iteration precision or number of times, obtaining the search result set an
i
Step 5:  Generate a new individual from an
i  and calculate the fitness value, and replace the 
individual with the lowest fitness value in the population with the new individual
Step 6: Neighbors optimize each other to generate new individuals;
Step 7:  The population is updated, and it is judged whether the loop is over. If it is not fin-
ished, go to step 2 and continue the loop until the loop ends;

4.2 Simulation results analysis
4.2.1 Analysis of Pareto front-end diagram
The MOEA/D algorithm and the hybrid conjugate gradient algorithm are used to plan the 
first wave, SWTA (1). In the simulation experiment using the traditional MOEA/D algo-
rithm, the Pareto curve has been stabilized in the 200 s, and the convergence time is 22 sec-
onds. Using a mixed MOEA/D algorithm to solve the target, the algorithm converges steadily 
after 80 iterations using 14 seconds. The Pareto front-end diagrams of the two methods are 
shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3.

Figures  2 and 3  show that the hybrid conjugate gradient MOEA/D algorithm has a 
smoother Pareto curve than the traditional MOEA/D algorithm. There is no interruption in 
Figure 3, so the curve continuity is better. In summary, the improved MOEA/D algorithm 
has been improved in terms of convergence, speed and diversity of the solution distribution.
4.2.2 Analysis of weapon-target assignment results
The first wave of weapon-target assignment results is shown in Table 4.
The probability of target destruction is calculated on the basis of the first wave of weapon-
target assignment. 
1P( )1 = 0.8, P2
P ( )1 = 0.9, P3P ( )1 = 0.95, P4
P ( )1 = 0.8, P5P ( )1 = 0.95. Assuming 
that the target with a destroying probability of more than 95% is destroyed, the target param-
eters are updated for SWTA (2) and SWTA (3). The results of weapon-target assignment are 
shown in Tables 5 and 6.
The model has carried on an effective firepower distribution to the target. It generates hits 
on high-value “key targets” undestroyed by the last wave after considering the target value 
and threat, and the cost of weapons.

5 CONCLUSION
In this paper, an improved decomposition multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is used to 
solve the dynamic firepower allocation problem with multi-wave strikes. In contrast with the 
traditional weapon-target assignment model, the proposed algorithm considers the target 
value, target threat, fire unit value and other elements all together, so is closer to the actual 
combat situation. It has an important practical significance.

Microblog topic mining based on a combined TF-IDF 
and LDA topic model
B. Ge, W. Zheng, G.M. Yang, Y. Lu & H.J. Zheng
Anhui University of Science and Technology, Huainan, Anhui, China
ABSTRACT: Because keywords in a microblog topic are affected by time of release, 
influence and ways to emphasize special words (such as “#” and “
”), a standalone Latent 
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model cannot accurately cluster microblog keywords 
into microblog topics. This paper proposes a mining method based on a combined Term 
Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and LDA topic model, which can 
accurately mine microblog keywords and cluster them into microblog topics. This method 
can effectively overcome the data sparsity problem caused by the length restriction on the 
microblog. First, we collect microblogs containing keywords (such as “Internet”) from 
the Internet, and perform a pretreatment on them. Then microblog weightings such as 
release time, influence and keywords are extracted using the TF-IDF algorithm. Finally, 
the set containing these weighted keywords is used as an input document to train an LDA 
topic model and achieve the topic mining of the microblog. After recall and precision rate 
evaluation, this method demonstrates better alignment with the topic of the microblog.
1 INTRODUCTION
Through market investigation, society and business are often aware of trending topics and 
the discussions around them. A microblog is a good channel for mining information, but 
the text information of a microblog contains extremely large and varied data. Within the 
text information stream of a microblog, the traditional data mining method based on word 
frequency is too simple and cannot intuitively and effectively explore a microblog’s topic. In 
order to gather similar contents or microblogs together and accurately explore microblog 
topics, this paper proposes a microblog topic mining method based on a combined Term 
Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) 
topic model, which involves the weighting of the microblog’s time of release, influence and 
keywords in developing research and experiments.
Microblog topic mining can be divided into two parts: keyword extraction by TF-IDF, 
and clustering keywords into topics through the LDA topic model. The detailed process is 
as follows:
1. Collect the microblog texts containing the current keywords via the Internet and perform 
word segmentation on the microblog texts;
2. Use the TF-IDF algorithm and comprehensively consider the release time, influence and 
keywords of the microblog to extract a microblog keyword weighting and form a keyword 
document;
3. Train the LDA topic model with these keyword sets as input, and cluster the keywords 
into topics according to the probability distribution;
4. Finally, compare the above results with the topic mining results produced by the use of a 
standalone LDA topic model in order to draw conclusions.

2.1 TF-IDF study
The TF-IDF algorithm and its improved algorithm are widely applied and can be used to 
process a continuous data flow. This algorithm can realize the test of a real data flow and 
also capture the most frequent items (Erra et al., 2015). A new distance-based term weighting 
method is also based on TF-IDF. This method can prevent the term weighting from being 
compromised in the case of overly large news amounts. The experimental results show that 
this method can perform better than the standalone TF-IDF in terms of news classification 
and clustering (Chen, 2017). Combined with the news event evolution model, TF-IDF recal-
culated the weightings and completed the integration of the models. The results show that 
this method is better than the baseline (Wen et al., 2017).
2.2 LDA topic model study
Recent studies have shown that topic models such as LDA are widely applied. In order to 
prune irrelevant tweets, a novel method to improve topics learned from Twitter content with-
out modifying the basic machinery of LDA was applied (Hajjem & Latiri, 2017). In order to 
improve the efficiency of the model, an Enriched LDA (ELDA) model was shown to improve 
the validity and accuracy of topic identification (Shams & Baraani-Dastjerdi, 2017). In addi-
tion, the LDA model can be used for text categorization. A news classification method in 
TF-IDF, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and LDA thematic model. The classification result 
precision is improved to some extent (Cao et al., 2017).
3  RESEARCH ON MINING MICROBLOG TOPICS BASED ON A COMBINED 
TF-IDF AND LDA TOPIC MODEL
The LDA topic model is a method to extract keywords based on word frequency and has 
been widely used in text mining. In this section, we describe how we combine a microblog’s 
release time, influence and keywords into three aspects of a proposed mining method based 
on a combined TF-IDF and LDA topic model.
3.1 Extracting microblog keyword weighting based on TF-IDF
This paper extracts the keywords of microblog texts preprocessed by the TF-IDF model, 
which are combined with the microblog’s weightings in terms of time of release, influence, 
and keywords.
3.1.1 Microblog’s release-time weighting
The release-time weighting of the microblog is based on when the microblog was released 
and the index describing the importance of the keywords. The closer the microblog release 
time is to the point of topic mining, the greater the time weighting of the keywords. Thereby, 
all time-tagged microblogs are aggregated into documents, and the microblog keywords are 
extracted through TF-IDF. The time weighting corresponding to the microblog release is 
added to the keywords, and reflects the time value of the microblog. The microblog’s release-
time weighting is calculated using Equations 1 and 2:
 
P
Ki
K
i
t
∑
 
(1)
 
weight
i
time(
)
word =α
β
+
α
 
(2)
where Ki represents the full microblog in time period t. Based on the time of the microblog, 
the time weighting is added to the keywords; a0 is the initial time weighting of the microblog 
keywords, β is the incremental weighting with time, and weighttime(word) is the microblog’s 
release-time weighting.

293
3.1.2 Microblog’s influence weighting
The microblog’s influence weighting is based on the number of fans and the number of likes 
on the blogposts that describe the importance of keywords. Therefore, in the extraction of 
keywords from a microblog with a high number of fans and high praise, the keywords acquire 
a greater weight of influence for the microblog. Thus, when weighted—setting a threshold 
on the number of fans and the number of likes of the microblog—keywords extracted from 
the microblog with more than 1,000 fans are given microblog ‘fans weights’, and keywords 
extracted from the microblog with more than 100 fans are given microblog ‘like weights’. The 
sum of the microblog’s fans weight and its like weight results in the microblog’s influence 
weighting:

In Equation 3, weightfans(word) represents the number of microblog fans, X0 represents 
the initial value of the microblog’s fans weight, and N represents the number of fans. When 
the number of fans does not reach the threshold of 1,000, the microblog’s fans weight takes 
the initial weight. When the number of fans is 1,000 or more, the microblog’s fans weight 
increases with N. Equation 4 indicates the value of the microblog’s like weight: Y0 repre-
sents the initial value of the microblog’s like weight, M represents the number of microblog 
likes, and when the number of likes does not reach the threshold of 100, microblog fans 
weight weightforword(word) with M increments. In Equation 5, weighteffect(word) denotes the 
influence weighting of the microblog, which is the sum of the fans weight and the like 
weight.
3.1.3 Microblog’s keyword weighting
The microblog’s keyword weighting means the way to emphasize special words associated 
with the microblog, an indicator that describes the importance of keywords. The “#” and 
“
” characters in the microblog are custom expressions by which the microblog emphasizes 
its content. The words enclosed by “#” or “
” tend to indicate the topic of the document. 
Therefore, this paper gives higher weight to words enclosed by “#” and “
” characters. 
In order to highlight the importance of the subject in the description of the microblog, it is 
necessary to highlight the importance of words in the description of the microblog’s topic in 
“#” and “
”. But “#” and “
” have been included in the Institute of Computing Technol-
ogy, Chinese Lexical Analysis System (ICTCLAS) word segmentation tool in the table, and 
they must be removed from the participle table. The definition of the microblog’s keyword 
weighting is shown in Equation 6:
 
weight
i
(word)
a
new
= 2
0  
(6)
where weightnew(word) is the microblog’s keyword weighting, and a0 is the initial weighting of 
the word.
In the process of extracting keywords, TF-IDF adds these three weightings to the key-
words, namely, the microblog’s weighting of release time, the microblog’s weighting of influ-
ence, and the microblog’s weighting of keywords. The sum of the three weightings is the 
keywords weighting, as shown in Equation 7:
 
 weight

(7)
where weightword is the keywords weighting, and keywords are extracted by TF-IDF in combi-
nation with the keywords weighting to form a keywords document. This keywords document 
is then input to the LDA topic model.

294
3.2 Keywords clustering based on the LDA topic model
The keywords weighting is composed of three aspects of the microblog: release time, influ-
ence, and keywords. We combine the keywords weighting with the combined TF-IDF and 
LDA topic model to extract the microblog topic. We are extracting keywords from microblog 
texts by TF-IDF and giving keywords the appropriate keywords weighting. The LDA topic 
model can be used to model the texts’ probability. The basic idea is that each text can represent 
the mixed distribution of a series of topics. It can be expressed as P(z). Each topic represents 
the probability distribution of all words in the vocabulary and can be expressed as P(wi|zi). 
Hence, the probability distribution of each word in the text can be expressed as follows:
 
P(w )
P(w | z
j)P(z
j
j)
P(w
)
i
j)P(z
j
j
T
P(w | z
P(w
=
=
=∑

(8)
The data set of keywords is used as the method of input training of the LDA model. K 
words are required to generate M documents containing N words. Word probability means the 
probability distribution of the words. Parameter-W and Parameter-T represent the parame-
ters at word level of the material. Topic probability represents the variable at document level. 
Each document corresponds to one topic probability. In other words, the probability of gen-
erating the topic varies from one document to another. Sampling of topic probability should 
be conducted for each document. Topic and article are the variables at word level. The topic 
is generated by topic probability. The article is jointly generated by topic and Parameter-W. 
Each word corresponds to one topic. The model is illustrated in Figure 1.
4 RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS
Taking into account the huge number of users and amount of information on the Sina micro-
blog, we selected only some of the user data for our research. We extracted more than 10,000 
online microblog messages from 500 authenticated Sina Weibo users between 1 June 2017 
and 31 December 2017.
4.1 Comparison and analysis
The keywords were extracted by D-algorithm and combined with the microblog’s weightings 
of release time, influence and keywords to reduce the length of the keyword data in order 
to obtain new data text. We then clustered the keywords in the new data text using the LDA

topic model, intercepting the first four keywords of each topic and comparing them with a 
standalone LDA topic model, as shown in Table 1.
In order to compare the accuracy of a standalone LDA topic model and the TF-IDF and 
LDA topic model that combines keyword weights in the mining of microblog topics, the 
measures used are precision P, recall R and F-measure. The scheme is shown in Table 2.
The specific definitions of P, R and F-measure are shown in Equations 9, 10 and 11:

From the experimental results comparing the two topic mining strategies, the TF-IDF 
and LDA topic model combined with keywords weightings produces higher precision, recall, 
and F-measure values than the standalone LDA topic model. This illustrates the value of the 
combination of TF-IDF and keywords weighting with the LDA topic model, which has the 
advantages of a stronger ability to mine information, a higher information accuracy, and 
effectively overcomes the data sparsity problem caused by the limited length of the microblog 
and can accurately mine the topics of the microblog.
5 CONCLUSION
With the rise of new media, represented by the microblog, it is difficult to extract the valu-
able information behind the data from the original massive, disordered and noisy plethora of 
microblog data. This paper presents a topic mining method based on a combined TF-IDF 
and LDA topic model of the microblog’s specific topic; first, by collecting words containing 
keywords from the online microblog, and then performing a pretreatment on these microb-
logs. The weightings of the microblog’s release time, influence and keywords are extracted 
using the TF-IDF algorithm. Finally, the set containing these weighted keywords is used as 
an input document to train and complete the topic mining of the microblog. Through this 
experiment, we found that the method of combining the microblog’s release time, influence 
and keyword weightings using the TF-IDF and LDA topic model can ensure the accuracy 
of the current topic mining of microblogs from many angles, and make the semantics of 
each keyword of the topic more cohesive: the distinction between microblog topics is made 
more obvious. Precision, recall, and F-measure values have been improved. Therefore, in 
conclusion, the combination of the microblog’s release time, influence and keyword weight-
ings using the combined TF-IDF and LDA topic model strategy is much more aligned with 
a specific microblog topic than the standalone use of the LDA topic model.

Application of collaborative representation in audio 
signal recognition
Q.F. Huang & X.J. Li
Zhonghuan Information College, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, China
ABSTRACT: Feature extraction and classifier design are the main problems of acoustic signal 
recognition algorithms. In this paper, we extract the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients of the 
acoustic features of vehicles in complex scenes. Collaborative representation is introduced for 
the design of a classification scheme (Collaborative Representative Classification, CRC), which 
synthetically considers the relationship among samples. Experiments show that the proposed 
algorithm produces good performance in vehicle recognition for the case of a complex data set. 
Compared with other classification algorithms, the method improves the precision of recognition.
Keywords: collaborative representation, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, vehicle recog-
nition, complex scenes
1 INTRODUCTION
Recently, sparse coding or sparse representation (Zhang et al., 2011) has been widely studied 
to solve signal recognition, partially due to the progress of l0-norm and l1-norm minimization 
techniques. In pattern classification, sparse representation can also be used to classify a signal 
and detect a target.
Sparse representation codes a signal y over a dictionary ϕ, such that y≈ϕα where α is 
a sparse vector. The sparsity of α can be measured by l0-norm, which counts the number 
of non-zeros in α. Because the combinatorial l0-norm is NP-hard, the l1-minimization, as 
the closest convey function to l0-norm minimization, is widely employed in sparse coding: 
n ||
||
||
||
α
α ||
. ||
ε
1
2||
φ
. .||
||
.
≤
||||||
, where ε is a small constant. Although l1-minimization is much 
more efficient than l0-minimization, it is still time-consuming, and hence many fast algo-
rithms have been proposed to speed up the l1-minimization process.
Most literature (e.g. Kopparapu & Laxminarayana, 2010; Boucheron et al., 2012) places 
too much emphasis on the role of l1-norm sparsity in signal classification, while the role 
of collaborative representation, using the training samples from all classes to represent the 
query sample y, is largely ignored.
In this paper we propose a new classification scheme, namely Collaborative Representation 
Classification (CRC), which has significantly less complexity than Sparse Representation Clas-
sification (SRC), but leads to very competitive classification results. Section 2 briefly reviews the 
Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) algorithms (Gang et al., 2010) that are used to 
extract the audio features. Section 3 briefly reviews SRC (Yang et al., 2011; Kua et al., 2011) and 
Section 4 presents the CRC scheme (McLaughlin et al., 2017; Larrain et al., 2017; Feng & Zhou, 
2016). Section 5 presents the results of extensive experiments, and Section 6 concludes the paper.
2 MFCC ALGORITHMS
MFCC algorithms involve the following steps when used for parameter extraction:

298
1. Endpoint detection
 
For an original audio signal, we need to detect the starting point and termination point, 
and then delete the silent segment. In this way, we can reduce the amount of calculation 
and improve the accuracy of feature extraction.
2. Pre-emphasis
 
In order to obtain a flat signal spectrum, which can make spectrum analysis easier, we usu-
ally achieve it by the application of a digital pre-emphasis filter H(z) after the signal has 
been sampled and quantized:

3. Windowing
 
Because the audio signal is a typical time-varying signal, we use a Hamming window to 
cut out N audio signal samples. Every sample continues for about 10 ms, so we get a series 
of approximately stable signals.

4. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) conversion and energy spectrum
 
The audio signal is fast and unstable in the time domain, so we usually convert the signal 
to the frequency domain by using a FFT conversion to obtain the spectrum and energy 
spectrum of the signal.
5. MFCC parameter and differential cepstrum
 
We use 24 triangular window filters for signal filtering, to simulate the masking effect of 
the human ear. We take the log of the output and then do a discrete cosine transforma-
tion. After this, we obtain the standard MFCC parameter; in order to better reflect the 
dynamic characteristic of the acoustic signals and improve recognition accuracy, we need 
the differential cepstrum:

3 THE SRC SCHEME
Natural signals, such as sound, image or seismic data, can be stored in compressed form, in 
terms of their projection, given a suitable basis. When the basis is chosen properly, a large 
number of projection coefficients are either zero or small enough to be ignored. If a signal has 
only s non-zero coefficients, it is said to be s-sparse. If a large number of projection coefficients 
are small enough to be ignored, then the signal is said to be compressible. The signal acquisi-
tion model of Compressed Sensing (CS) is quite similar to a conventional sensing framework. 
If χ represents the signal to be sensed, then the sensing process may be represented as:
 
Y = Φχ
Φ
 
(4)
where Φ is an m-by-n measurement matrix and Y is a measurement vector. The signal of 
interest χ can be expressed on a representational basis as:
 
x = χ  
(5)
where x is the s-sparse vector, representing projection coefficients of χ on Ψ. Measurement 
vector Y can now be rewritten in terms of x as:
 
Y
x
θx  
(6)

299
where θ = ΦΨ is an (m × n) – dimensional, reconstruction matrix. In a signal reconstruction 
model, we need to solve Y
x
θx . However, in a signal classification model, instead of recov-
ering the signal, we need to find the appropriate category for the signal; we call this Sparse 
Representation Classification (SRC). The SRC algorithm involves the following steps:
1. Normalize the columns of X to have unit l2-norm.
2. Code y over X via l1-minimization:

(9)
From the above, we can see that the SRC involves two key aspects: first, the coding vector 
of query sample y is required to be sparse; second, the coding of y is performed collabora-
tively over the dataset X, instead of each subset Xi.
4 COLLABORATIVE REPRESENTATION-BASED CLASSIFICATION (CRC)
Sparsity is the key insight in compressed sensing—most signals admit a decomposition over 
a reduced set of signals from the same class. Unfortunately, there is no known algebraic solu-
tion to such an l1-regularized least-squares formulation. A combined l1/l2 regularization tends 
to robustify/group the coefficients of the solution while enforcing sparsity. The representa-
tion obtained, seen as a linear decomposition over a pool of samples, has a structural mean-
ing in that the residuals and the solution coefficients reveal the importance of each sample 
(or group thereof) for the new input query. This information is used in the classification (or 
assignment) of the query sample to the most appropriate class of samples (the one with mini-
mum residual error or largest coefficient impact).
The basic Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) problem aims at optimizing:

5 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
5.1 Experimental data
All the experimental data in this paper is from the wireless sensor network database (the 
Acoustic Vehicle Classification Dataset) of the SITEX02 experiment of Project SensIT at 
DARPA: http://www.ecs.umass.edu/∼mduarte/Software.html [accessed 7 December 2018]. The 
database contains two audio files of military vehicles: an Assault Amphibian Vehicle (AAV) 
and a Dragon Wagon (DW).
5.2 Description and experimental results
For the experiment we select the audio signal with a frequency of 4,960 Hz (see Figure 1), and 
then use the FFT and MFCC algorithms to extract features.
First, we use the SRC algorithms to classify the signal using either an FFT or an MFCC eigen-
vector, and then we make a comparison of the two eigenvectors (see Figure 2). For the experiment, 
we used 90 samples. After extracting the features, we randomly selected n samples as training 
samples, and used the remainder as testing samples. Finally, we compared the recognition rate.
From Table 1, we can see that as the number of training samples is increased, the recognition 
rate of both eigenvectors increases slightly for each classification algorithm. In addition, we can 
see that the MFCC eigenvectors perform better than the FFT eigenvectors in classifying the 
AAV signal, and a little worse than the latter in classifying the DW signal. However, if we con-
sider the overall performance, we can see that the MFCC eigenvectors outperform the FFT ones.

301
Thus, having extracted the MFCC eigenvectors, we used either the SRC or the CRC algo-
rithm to classify the signal, and then made a comparison of the two. For the experiment, we 
used 90 samples. After extracting the features, we randomly selected n samples as training 
samples, and used the remainder as testing samples. Last, we compared the recognition rate 
and time cost of the two algorithms.

From Table 2, we can see that as the number of training samples is increased, the time cost 
of both algorithms increases, while the overall recognition rate increases slightly. Although 
the CRC algorithm produces a slightly lower recognition rate than the SRC algorithm, it 
costs much less in time terms.
6 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we briefly introduce the acoustic signal recognition system and its component 
parts. Then we introduce a new acoustic signal recognition algorithm, CRC, and make a 
detailed comparison with the SRC method, comparing recognition rate and time cost. We 
find that the CRC algorithm has almost the same recognition rate as SRC, but at a much 
lower cost in time. However, we have not investigated further the impact that different sig-
nals may have on the result. In ongoing research, we may explore the method prior to signal 
extraction. Because SRC is becoming increasingly popular in signal processing, the advan-
tage of CRC in costing much less time should give it broader application in the future.

Structured assessment of ABET student outcomes ‘a’ and ‘e’ in 
mathematics for engineering students
S. Kadry
Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Faculty of Science, Beirut Arab University, Lebanon
ABSTRACT: Student outcomes are statements that describe the attributes, skills and abili-
ties that students should have by the time of graduation. For quality assurance evaluation, 
these outcomes must be assessed through the curriculum and extracurricular activities. In 
order to evaluate the level to which an outcome has been met, it is necessary to select some 
courses where the outcome is highly covered. Whether an outcome is ‘highly’ covered can be 
identified using Bloom’s taxonomy levels, the number of hours of coverage, the weighting of 
its assessment and other parameters. Course goals must be linked to the student outcomes 
and defined in measurable terms. Using just the two ABET outcomes ‘a’ and ‘e’ as examples, 
this paper presents a structured approach to directly and indirectly assessing student out-
comes in mathematics through a partial differential equation course and by defining appro-
priate measurable course goals. The strategy to assess the outcomes is also explained.
Keywords: assessment, outcomes, ABET, accreditation
1 INTRODUCTION
Academic accreditation is an official recognition and validation that a higher education insti-
tution is assessed positively or negatively against a set of standards and criteria. It is a sign 
of the quality of continuous assessment and improvement of their programs. There are two 
types of academic accreditation: institutional and specialized. The first of these accredits the 
institution as a whole and not a specific program within the institution, which is what the 
specialized accreditation does. This research study focuses on this second type of accredita-
tion. One of the important factors of this accreditation is involving different stakeholders 
and the community (parents, employers, etc.) in the process of assessment. Accreditation 
benefits students, instructors and the community. Accreditation is evidence that an academic 
program that leads to a degree has met certain standards essential in producing graduates 
who are ready to enter their chosen professions. Students who graduate from accredited uni-
versities have access to enhanced opportunities in employment, licensure (e.g. Professional 
Engineer), registration and certification (e.g. IEEE society membership), graduate education 
and global mobility (e.g. student transfer acceptance, applications for graduate schools).
ABET (formerly the Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology) is a nonprofit 
and non-governmental accreditation agency for academic programs in four disciplines: applied 
science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology. As of 22 November 2014, ABET 
accredits more than 3,400 academic programs at nearly 700 colleges and universities in 28 
countries (USA and 27 other countries). ABET provides specialized, programmatic accredita-
tion that evaluates an individual program of study, rather than evaluating the entire institution.
ABET accreditation processes and procedures are totally voluntary and achieved through 
peer review. It provides assurance that a college or university program meets the quality 
standards established by the profession for which the program prepares its students. In the 
USA, ABET is recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA), and 
by mutual agreement with many countries like Canada and Australia.

Recently, I developed a systematic process to assess the student outcomes in mathematics 
courses (Kadry, 2015a, 2015b). In this paper, I focus on just two outcomes as an example, 
and discuss the new approach I used to develop an assessment methodology in mathematics 
courses, conforming with ABET accreditation standards (ABET, 2018).
2 STUDENT OUTCOMES
ABET requires each program seeking accreditation to develop a clear set of student out-
comes (referred to as Criterion 3), collect direct and indirect assessment data through several 
courses and surveys, determine the degree to which the outcomes are achieved, and use the 
results of the evaluation to improve the program. The ABET website has several documents 
related to assessment (ABET, 2018).
Criterion 3 (Student Outcomes) of the ABET Criteria is a set of characteristics that each 
program must have documented in relation to student outcomes that prepare graduates to 
accomplish the institutional program educational objectives. As mentioned, student out-
comes describe the attributes, skills, and abilities that students should have upon graduating 
from the program. Listed below are the 11 student outcomes defined by ABET (normally 
referred to as ‘a to k’):
a. An ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering;
b. An ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data;
c. An ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic 
constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, 
manufacturability, and sustainability;
d. An ability to function on multidisciplinary teams;
e. An ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems;
f. An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility;
g. An ability to communicate effectively;
h. The broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a 
global, economic, environmental, and societal context;
i. Recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in, lifelong learning;
j. A knowledge of contemporary issues;
k. An ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engi-
neering practice.
Every core course in a curriculum includes a set of course goals; the goals are linked to the 
student outcomes (i.e. ‘a to k’). At the end of a semester, instructors are expected to measure 
those outcomes using direct and indirect assessment for the courses they have taught.
3 ASSESSMENT TYPES
Broadly speaking, there are two types of assessment: formative and summative. Formative 
assessment observes student learning progressively during the learning process. For example, 
the instructor asks students at the end of each class for their feedback and, based on that, the 
instructor might adjust his/her teaching method of the topic in the next class. The assessment 
techniques for this type may include quizzes, minutes paper, very small survey, and so on.
Summative assessment evaluates student learning at the end of a chapter or topic. The 
assessment technique for this type may include exams, projects, presentations, and so on.
4 PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
A performance indicator is a statement that includes an action verb. This verb is usually taken 
from Bloom’s taxonomy in order to be measurable. The idea here is to use the measurable verb 

305
in order to evaluate accurately and effectively whether a student outcome can be judged to 
have been achieved. Performance indicators are quantitative tools and are usually expressed 
as a rate, ratio or percentage. In ABET terminology (ABET, 2018), performance indicators 
are “effective assessments that use relevant direct, indirect, quantitative and qualitative meas-
ures as appropriate to the outcome being measured”. However, with growing maturity in the 
assessment process, programs are expected to place greater emphasis on direct assessment 
of student learning, based on demonstrable student work, rather than indirect assessment, 
which is based on student, alumni, or employer surveys.
In this paper, I will focus solely on outcomes ‘a’ and ‘e’ as examples, and describe the assess-
ment methodology. I will also use direct and indirect assessment of the outcome through evalu-
ation of student work and survey. Clearly, outcomes ‘a’ and ‘e’ are broad statements and their 
assessment requires de composition into a number of simpler measurable aspects that allow 
one to determine the extent to which the outcome is met. In ABET literature, these measurable 
aspects are known as performance indicators. Performance indicators are written with action 
verbs such as define, demonstrate, discriminate, evaluate, and interpret. Performance indicators 
also spell out specific subject contents (Darandari & Murphy, 2013; Briedis, 2002; Keshavarz & 
Baghdarnia, 2007; Bloxham & Boyd, 2007). In this case, we select a partial differential equation 
course for assessment. The reason for selection of this course is explained below.
4.1 Bloom’s taxonomy in the math context
Table 1 describes Bloom’s taxonomy and related measurable verbs that can be applied in 
math assessment.
It is strongly recommended that the verbs in Table 1 are used while preparing the ‘course 
goals’ of mathematics courses so that the assessment of the outcomes is made more 
straightforward.
4.2 Outcomes ‘a’ and ‘e’
In order to remove any ambiguity and understand more deeply the difference between these 
two outcomes, I shall break them down to different factors, so the assessment of each one 
becomes more accurate.
Outcome ‘a’: An ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering.
• a1: Apply knowledge of mathematics to distinguish between dependent and independent 
variables. Describe derivative and integral of functions. Select an appropriate model. Use 
analytical and numerical techniques to solve equations. Apply concepts of integral and dif-
ferential calculus and linear algebra to solve problems.
• a2: Apply knowledge of science and engineering to describe the principal of physical, 
chemical or biological systems. Apply thermodynamic principles. Apply materials princi-
ples. Analyze data using statistics principles. Analyze models of systems.
Outcome ‘e’: An ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems.
• e1: Identifies and understands all problems associated with current methods.
• e2: Uses knowledge to construct models of physical systems.
• e3: Identifies and analyzes potential solutions to engineering problem.
• e4: Assesses the effectiveness and accuracy of different approach.
• e5: Indicates how theory can be used in practice.
• e6: Select appropriate solutions to the engineering problem.
4.3 Course goals
An example of the course goals of a Partial Differential Equation (PDE) course might be:
− CG1: Model engineering systems using PDE(e)
− CG2: Solve linear first and second order PDE(a)

306
− CG3: Find Fourier series of function(a)
− ….
− ….
The letters contained in parentheses indicate the associated student outcome.
5 OUTCOMES ASSESSMENT
In order to assess outcomes ‘a’ and ‘e’, I will use direct and indirect assessment. For the direct 
assessment, I will include in the exam the problem described below and illustrated in Figure 1.
A thin rectangular plate coincides with the region defined by 2≤ x ≤ 8, 1≤ y ≤ 5. The left end 
and the bottom of the plate are insulated. The top of the plate is held at temperature zero, and 
the right end of the plate is held at temperature f(y)=y.
Q1: Model the problem using a partial differential equation.
Q2: Solve the partial differential equation obtained in Q1, using an appropriate technique.
As we can see, Q1 addresses CG1 and covers outcome ‘e’ (in particular, e2) and Q2 addresses 
CG2 and covers outcome ‘a’ (in particular, a1). Now, in order to decide if the outcome is 
achieved, we need to define the associated threshold. For instance, we can say that if 70% of 
students get 70 and above on Q1 then outcome ‘e’ is achieved in this course; otherwise, we need 
to identify and implement some improvements in relation to CG1 for the next semester.

For the indirect assessment, we use a survey, as illustrated in Table 2, that students and 
instructors are required to complete at the end of the term.
The outcome is achieved if the average of all students is ‘3’ or above, for example, and the 
same for the instructor evaluation. At the end, an outcome is achieved in this course if all 
assessment, direct and indirect, is achieved.
We recommend that each outcome is assessed over three courses. Hence an outcome is achieved 
if it is achieved in at least two courses. Thus, in the example of Figure 2, outcome ‘e’ is achieved.

6 CONCLUSION
In this paper, I explained the difference between the two ABET student outcomes ‘a’ and 
‘e’, and how a faculty can assess these through direct and indirect assessment. The proposed 
strategy can be extended to cover all other outcomes.

ABSTRACT: Voiceprint recognition is one of the most popular biometric recognition tech-
nologies, which can recognize the identity of the speaker through the voice. Based on Con-
volutional Neural Network (CNN) and deep Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) voiceprint 
recognition program, the research of voiceprint recognition technology is called CDRNN. 
The CDRNN processes the speaker’s original speech information through a series of proc-
esses and generates a two-dimensional spectrogram. The CNN is better than the advantage 
of processing the image to extract the personality characteristics of the speech signal from 
the spectrogram. These personality features are then inputted into the deep RNN. Voiceprint 
identification is then used to determine the identity of the speaker. The experimental results 
showed that the CDRNN can obtain better recognition accuracy than other schemes such as 
Gaussian Mixture Model-Universal Background Model (GMM-UBM).
Keywords: voiceprint recognition, deep recurrent neural network, convolutional neural net-
work, spectrogram
1 INTRODUCTION
Compared with the traditional account password scheme, the identity authentication mecha-
nism based on the biometrics (Jain et al., 2004) of people has a more secure and reliable 
advantage. Voiceprint recognition technology has a wide range of needs and prospects in the 
fields of finance, online transactions, and national defense (Furui, 1997).
There has been much research on voiceprint recognition technology. Early research on 
speaker recognition concentrated on feature parameter extraction and model matching. From 
the aspect of acoustic feature parameter extraction, the simulated auditory feature line of 
linear predictive coefficients, perceptual linear prediction coefficients (Hermansky, 1990) 
and mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (Vergin et al., 1999) have been proposed. For model 
matching, speech recognition technology is used in human voiceprint recognition such as 
dynamic time warping (Dutta, 2008), vector quantization (Gray, 1990), artificial neural network 
(Gardner & Dorling, 1998; Jain et al., 1996) and other technologies. The Gaussian Mixture 
Model (GMM) is one of the key methods of voiceprint recognition because of its simple 
and reliable performance and stable performance (Reynolds & Rose, 1995). Based on GMM, 
Reynolds proposed the Gaussian Mixture Model-Universal Background Model (GUM-UBM) 
to push the voiceprint recognition to practical applications (Reynolds et al., 2000).
With the development of deep learning technology, it achieved good results in the field 
of image processing and speech recognition (Abdel-Hamid et al., 2012; Schmidhuber, 2014; 
Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014) such as Palaz et al. (2015) who analyzed the Convolutional Neu-
ral Network (CNN), and for voice recognition, achieved good results. Inspired by this, some 
studies began to apply deep learning techniques to speaker recognition (Kanagasundaram 
et al., 2016; Phapatanaburi et al., 2016; Richardson et al., 2015). Richardson used Deep 
Neural Networks (DNN) for speaker recognition, and extracted a frame-level feature from 

310
speech signals by constructing an i-vector system based on bottleneck features. Phapatan-
aburi used GMM and DNN to identify dialects in the dialect environment with reverbera-
tion. Kanagasundaram (2016) used a singular phoneme, combined with DNN and simplified 
the Gaussian probability linear discriminant analysis to model a phrase’s tone signal and to 
identify the speaker. Since speech information is a continuous context-correlated signal, and 
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) is good at processing sequence signals, Graves (Graves 
et al., 2013; Sak et al., 2014) introduced the identification of speakers through RNN. Wang 
et al., (2016) used CNN and RNN to complete multi-label image classification, Fan et al., 
(2016) used it for video-based emotional perception, and Jiang et al., (2016) used it for event 
detection of motion video and so on, but there is almost no work for voiceprint recognition.
CNN is good at image feature extraction, and an RNN network has advantages in timing 
modeling. Therefore, combining the advantages of CNN and RNN, this paper proposes a Voice-
print Recognition Mechanism (CDRNN) based on CNN and deep RNN, and applies CNN and 
RNN to voiceprint recognition. The CDRNN first converts the speaker’s original speech into a 
spectrogram, and then uses the structural advantages of CNN to automatically extract the speak-
er’s personality characteristics from the spectrogram; these personality features are inputted into 
the deep RNN to complete the classification. Achieve the recognition of the speaker’s voiceprint.
2 CDRNN DESIGN
After generation of the spectrogram, this data will be inputted into the neural network for feature 
extraction and classification. This paper uses the CNN and deep RNN network to realize the 
feature extraction and classification of speech signals. CNN is particularly good at processing 
images, and the spectrogram is actually a two-dimensional grayscale image. The various proper-
ties of the image reflect various characteristics of the speaker’s voice signal. Therefore, taking the 
spectrogram as input, the CNN network automatically extracts the personality features of the 
speech segment from the inputted two-dimensional grayscale spectrogram. CNN consists of mul-
tiple convolutional layers and pooling layers, where the convolutional layer can extract different 
features of the speech segment, and the pooling layer can perform translation, scaling or other 
deformation operations on the inputted two-dimensional grayscale image. After pooling, the 
same post-pooling features are still generated, thereby reducing the impact of spectrum changes.
The CNN structure part is composed of n convolution pooling units, as shown in Figure 1, 
where n needs to be set according to actual conditions.
The structure of a convolutional pooling unit is shown in Figure 2. The ReLU is the activation 
function and max pool is the pooling function. In order to enable the network to converge quickly, 
the training speed of the network is also accelerated by the batch normalization algorithm.

For the convolution pooling unit, when the pooling layer performs the pooling operation, 
it only pools on the frequency and does not pool in time. This is mainly because pooling 
in time is likely to result in loss of timing information in the spectrogram. In addition, the 
number of convolutional pooling units and feature maps, the number of feature maps, the 
size of the convolution kernel, and the size of the step and even the size of the pooled area, 
also needs to be set experimentally based on specific problems and data sets.
2.1 Deep RNN network design
When the CNN network processes the two-dimensional gray image of the spectrogram, its out-
put is used as an input to the deep RNN to perform further time series modeling. The deep RNN 
is constructed by superimposing the hidden layers of several RNNs, with the output of the previ-
ous hidden layer being the input of the next hidden layer. Compared to the neurons in the normal 
hidden layer, the neurons contained in the hidden layer of the deep RNN are connected.
2.1.1 Deep RNN input layer design
The CNN network processes the input spectrogram through n convolution pooling units. 
The processed output is a C-small spectrum with a size of F × T, where C is the Number of 
Feature Maps, and F and T are the Height and Width of the output petmap, respectively. A 
sequence can be used to represent the output of the CNN network: S = [S1, S1, … Si, ST]; 
1 ≤ i ≤ T; and the element Si in the sequence is a size C × F vector. CNN will output T vectors 
of size C × F, there is a correspondence between them. CNN network output sequence Si as 
an input at Time i for RNN. That is, the input of RNN, at Time i, is a vector of C × F dimen-
sion, and its step size is equal to T. Figure 3 shows the correspondence between the output 
sequence of the CNN and the RNN input.
2.1.2 RNN hidden layer
Deep RNN is stacked by a plurality of RNN, where in each layer of the input sequence as the 
output sequence of the next layer; this structure is shown in Figure 4. Compared with traditional 
Figure 3. CNN network output as RNN network input.

neural networks, deep RNN is characterized by a time feedback loop at each level. For practical 
problems, the hidden layer in deep RNN usually uses improved RNNs, such as LSTM-RNN or 
GRU-RNN, which solves the problem of a lack of long-term dependencies in the basic RNN. 
This allows the neural network to remember input data for a longer span of time. For deep 
RNN networks, when designing the structure of a hidden layer, the number of nodes in the hid-
den layer of the hidden layer needs to be considered. These two parameters also need to be set 
according to actual needs. In general, under the tendency of the same number of parameters, 
setting more layers can achieve better results than increasing the number of nodes per layer.
2.1.3 Deep RNN output layer
The output layer of deep RNN is classified using a softmax classifier, and the softmax classi-
fication makes the number of nodes in the output layer correspond to the number of speakers.
2.2 Network model training
The training of the CDRNN model adopts the method of supervised learning. First, all 
the data should be labeled, and then the data and the corresponding label are used as the 
training set. Assuming that the Number of Speech Signals to be Trained is K (generated by 
K speakers), the sequence of the spectrogram generated by the i-th speech signal is Si = (Si1, 
Si2, … Sim), where m is the Number of Spectrograms generated by the speech signal, and the 
j-th spectrogram Sij corresponds to a Two-Dimensional Matrix. Giving it a tag value of i−1 
means that all the spectrograms of the same speaker have the same tag, and this tag identifies 
the speaker’s ID Sij, and its label i−1 constitutes a Training Sample (Sij, i −1).
Before the training samples are trained, the sample data needs to be normalized. The data 
is scaled to a certain extent, mapped to a cell, thereby removing the unit limit of the data, 
and converted to a dimensionless number. At the same time, the data can be standardized to 
improve the convergence speed and accuracy of the model. In this paper, the min-max stand-
ardization mechanism commonly used in machine learning is used to normalize each pixel 
of a two-dimensional gray image. After data normalization, the pixel value interval is [0,1].
The CDRNN selects the cross-entropy function as the cost function, and uses the Error 
Back Propagation (BP) and Back Propagation Through Time (BPTT) algorithms to calculate 
the gradient and complete the training of the sample data.
2.3 Network model identification
The speaker produces a test speech signal that is pre-processed to generate n spectrograms, 
which are also normalized and then sequentially input into the CDRNN network model. 
The model will eventually output the ID of the speaker corresponding to each spectrogram. 
Obviously, n spectrograms will output the n IDs, and the ID with the most occurrences is 
considered to be the speaker ID of the test voice.

3 SIMULATION EXPERIMENT
3.1 Experimental setup
The experimental platform using Google’s open source deep learning framework is Tensor-
Flow. The sample data is trained on the TensorFlow platform, and the trained model, can be 
transplanted to the mobile phone. The latter can sample the speaker’s voice and identify the 
voiceprint through the trained model. The machine that trains the sample data is configured 
as: Intel(R) Core™ i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz8 core CPU and 2 NVIDIA GTX980Ti (6G) 
GPU. The memory size is 24G.
3.1.1 Voice data set
The speech data used in the experiment was collected from the real environment. 10 to 20 
minutes of voice data was recorded for each of the 40 different students via a smartphone. 
Due to environmental factors, background noise data was inevitably included in the collected 
speech signals. Each student’s speech data was divided into speech segments of 1s duration, 
with the first 80% of the data as the training data set and the last 20% of the data as the test 
data set. The recognition rate =
×
n
n
1n
100%,  of which n1 is the Number of Correct Speech 
Segments and n is the Total Number of Speech Segments in the test data set.
3.1.2 Spectral parameters
When generating a spectrogram for each speech segment, the frame length is set to 512; 256 pixels 
are then obtained after generating the spectrogram, which corresponds to the height of the spec-
trogram. In fact, only the first 128 pixels are taken during the experiment because the frequency 
of the speech signal is generally in the range of 300–3000 Hz, and the signal outside the interval is 
a noise signal, which can be ignored. The other parameter frame shift is set to 160. Since the sam-
pling frequency is 16 KHz, the speech segment of 1s duration will generate 16, 000 sample points. 
A 100 frames can be obtained, which means that the spectrogram width is 100 pixels.
3.1.3 CNN structural parameters
The parameters of the CNN, such as the number of convolution pooling units, the step 
size, the convolution kernel size, and the number of feature maps, are determined based on 
the parameters of the actual data set. After actual adjustment, the parameters of the CNN 
structure are set as follows:
a. The number of convolution pooling units is n = 4. The number of feature maps for the 
first pooled unit is set to 32, and the number of feature maps for the last three pooled units 
is set to 64.
b. The convolutional layer has a convolution kernel size of 5 × 5 and a step size of 1 × 1, and 
convolution is performed both in the frequency and time direction.
c. The size of the pooled area is set to 1 × 1. The step size is still 1 × 1, and the pooling is 
performed only in the frequency direction.
3.1.4 Deep RNN structure parameters
The two important parameters of deep RNN are the number of layers of the RNN and the 
number of nodes per layer. RNN more layers, the stronger the ability to identify the speaker 
ID. This means that a large number of layers of the RNN and the number of nodes per layer 
easier to over-fitting. RNN structures obtained by various different combinations of the two 
parameters, and tested recognition rate under different network structures. The number of 
layers at the highest recognition rate and the network structure corresponding to each layer 
of RNN selection nodes are used as Deep RNN parameters.
As shown in Figure 5, the number of layers of the RNN is 1, 3, 5, and 7, and the number of 
nodes per layer is 128, 256, and 512, so that 12 combinations can be obtained; corresponding 
to 12 network models. It was seen, with increasing number of RNN layers, that the recognition 
rate rose substantially. Similarly, when the number of RNN layers were not more than 5 (more 
nodes on each layer) the higher the recognition rate. However, when the number of RNN layers 

314
is 7, the number of nodes per layer is 512, and the recognition rate is lower than the recognition 
rate when the number of nodes per layer is 256. This shows that the more layers and the number 
of nodes per layer, the worse the recognition result is. The reason is that as the number of layers 
and the number of nodes per layer increase, the geometric number of parameters increases, and 
the size of the training set is limited, which easily leads to over-fitting. Based on the experimental 
results, the number of RNN layers is set to 7, and the number of nodes per layer is set to 256.
3.2 Experimental results
Firstly, the recognition accuracy of the four mechanisms based on CDRNN, GMM-UBM 
(Reynolds et al., 2000), DNN (Kanagasundaram et al., 2016) and GMM-DNN (Phapatanaburi 
et al., 2016) on this speech data set was compared. The results are shown in Figure 6. As the 
number of speakers increases, the recognition rate of the four mechanisms decreases, and the 
recognition rate of GMM-UBM decreases very rapidly. This is because the value of the key 
parameter mixture in GMM-UBM has a greater impact on the result. The recognition rate of 
CDRNN is slower, and the recognition rate of GMM-UBM is about 18% higher, especially 
when the number of speakers is large. In addition, CDRNN is about 6% higher than DNN and 
GMM-DNN, indicating that the back-end uses RNN to get better results than using DNN.
The CDRNN uses a front-end network model such as CNN+RNN. It compares perform-
ance with a deep network model that uses only RNN modeling, a front-end DNN and a 
back-end using RNN.
Figure 7 shows the recognition accuracy of the above three models when the number of RNN 
layers is 1, 3, and 5, and the number of nodes per layer is 256. It can be seen that with the increase 
in number of RNN layers, the recognition accuracy of the three network models has been 
Figure 5. Recognition rate of different network parameters in deep RNN.
Figure 6. Performance comparison of the four schemes.

315
improved to some extent, and the recognition accuracy of the RNN network model is the lowest. 
On the premise that the back-end uses the same RNN network, the recognition rate obtained by 
the front-end using the CNN network is higher than that of the front-end using the DNN net-
work. Then the front-end of the network model is fixed as a CNN network, and the back-end is a 
DNN and RNN network, respectively. The number of layers is 1, 3, 5, and the number of nodes 
in each layer is 128, 256 and 512 respectively. The result is shown in the Figure 8.
As can be seen from Figure 8, the recognition rate also increases as the number of layers 
and the number of nodes per layer increases. Regardless of the number of layers in the back-
end network of the two models and the number of nodes in each layer, when the parameters 
are the same, the recognition rate of the CNN+RNN network model is about 4% higher than 
that of CNN+DNN. This reflects the advantages of the CNN+RNN structure.

4 CONCLUSION
Using CNN’s ability to process images and RNN’s ability to model time series data, this 
paper proposes a CDRNN model that combines the advantages of CNN and RNN and uses 
it for voiceprint recognition. Through the comparison of real voice data sets, using CDRNN 
for training and testing, the accuracy of voiceprint recognition is higher than other models.

ABSTRACT: The algorithms used in Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) congestion 
control are the main reason for the performance of a given TCP variant. There are different 
implementations among TCP: Tahoe, Reno, NewReno, SACK and Vegas. Simulation was 
used to evaluate these TCP congestion control algorithms from many aspects, such as effec-
tive resource utilization (throughput utilization and packet-dropping probability). A network 
simulator was used with different scenarios and factors to influence the performance of the 
TCP variants. Under congested network conditions, the more conservative algorithm of TCP 
Vegas achieves higher throughput and a lower dropped-packet rate than the more aggressive 
algorithms of the other TCP variants tested.
Keywords: TCP, congestions, TCP variants, Network Simulator
1 INTRODUCTION
The algorithms for Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) congestion control are the main 
reason for the performance of a TCP variant. There are different implementations among 
TCP: Tahoe, Reno, NewReno, SACK and Vegas. Simulation will be used to evaluate these 
TCP congestion control algorithms from many aspects, such as effective resource utilization 
(throughput utilization and packet-dropping probability) A network simulator with different 
scenarios and factors that affect the performance of a TCP variant will be used. Focus will 
be given to the effect of different queue-type algorithms, such as DropTail and RED, and dif-
ferent buffer sizes. Simulations to compare TCPs Tahoe, NewReno, Reno, SACK and Vegas 
in different situations will also be carried out. All the simulations use File Transfer Protocol 
(FTP) as a traffic source. The ratio of number of packets received in a given time will be used 
to indicate the throughput occupancy (cwnd/time = throughput). The capacity of the buffer 
and window sizes are the number of units in the packet. Our first evaluation will compare 
the impact of resource utilization to show the available network bandwidth as a performance 
metric (effective throughput) for each TCP variant and the percentage drop when each type of 
variant is running alone on a congested network. Our second evaluation answers the question 
of how frequently each of the TCP protocol variants drops packets when two different TCP 
agents are running together and sharing a bottle necked path.
2 THROUGHPUT RATE
Figure 1 depicts Topology 1, a simple simulation network. The circle (R) indicates a finite-
buffer DropTail gateway, and the other circles (S and D) indicate sender and receiver hosts. 
The links are labeled with their bandwidth capacity and propagation delay. The parameters 

318
used in the simulation are shown in Table 1, and were used in the simulation and an error 
model was introduced to simulate packet dropping and enable comparison of the effective 
throughput for each of these five congestion control algorithms.
Measurement of the performance of Tahoe, NewReno, Vegas, Reno and SACK protocols 
on Topology 1 was undertaken, the results of which are shown in Table 2. In terms of the 
throughput utilization of these TCP protocols, the simulation results over5 s show that in this 
scenario TCP Vegas achieves a higher throughput and lower dropped-packet percentage than 
the other TCP variants.
3 PACKET-DROPPING PROBABILITY
To investigate packet-dropping rates, the network configuration shown in Figure 2 (Topology 
2) was used. R1 and R2 are finite-buffer switches and S1 to S4 are the end hosts. Connection 
1 transfers packets from S1 to S3, while Connection 2 transfers from S2 to S4. The links are 
labeled with their capacities and propagation delays and Table 3 details all the parameters 
used in the topology.
In a series of simulations, Connections 1 and 2were each configured to a different TCP pro-
tocol variant, in order to obtain ten result combinations, as shown in Table 4. These two-sender-
agent experiments are designed to test the dropping rates of TCPs Tahoe (Kadry & Al-Issa, 2015; 
Parvez et al., 2010), NewReno, Reno, SACK and Vegas when two of them are running together.

The results in Table 4 show the number of packets dropped by the TCP variants when two of 
them compete with each other. These results show that TCP Vegas has a lower rate of dropped 
packets than the other protocols (Afanasyev et al., 2010; Ibrahim et al., 2009), with the number 
varying between 3 and 6. TCP Vegas only loses a small number of packets because it uses a 
conservative algorithm that can enable it to detect and predict the congestion of an network 
before it happens. The other TCP protocols use aggressive algorithms to increase their window 
size until packet dropping occurs. When the SACK, NewReno, Reno and Tahoe protocols are 
competing, they share the bandwidth but at the expense of higher loss rates.

4 FAIRNESS BETWEEN THE SAME TCP AGENTS
This section explores the fairness between connections that have the same or different delay 
when identical variants of TCP run together on one bottlenecked link and share the bandwidth. 
An experiment on the effect of delay on TCPs Reno, SACK, NewReno, Tahoe and Vegas is 
carried out, together with a check of the behaviors of TCP variants in this situation.
In the simulation of network Topology 3 (illustrated in Figure 3), R1 and R2 are limited 
key buffers and S1 to S4 are the host ends. Connection 1 transfers packets from S2 to S4, and 
Connection 2 from S1 to S3. In each simulation, senders S1 and S2 are the same variants of 
TCP, such as two Tahoe, two NewReno, two Vegas, two SACK, and two Reno TCP agents, 
respectively. The links with capacity restriction (1.5 Mbps) and/or propagation delay are where 
the bandwidth or the router capacity generate a congestion state in the network. Other links 
operate at 10 Mbps and other simulation parameters are detailed in Table 5. The delay of the 
link connecting R2 and S3, which is denoted by X in Figure 3, was changed to show the effect 
of delay on the fairness between different connections; X had two values (1 msand30 ms).

5 CONCLUSION
On links where there is traffic or congestion, TCP Vegas produces the highest throughput 
and lowest rate of packet drop of the TCP protocol variants tested (Vegas, Tahoe, NewReno, 
Reno and SACK). The performance of TCP Vegas is perfect when congestion appears and 
the number of dropped packets is between 3 and 6 when running with the other TCP proto-
cols. When the SACK, NewReno, Reno and Tahoe protocols are in competition, they share 
the bandwidth almost half and half, but at the expense of higher loss rates.

ABSTRACT: The underwater image enhancement is a challenging for the low signal-to-
noise ratio and uneven illumination under water. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a 
novel image enhancement algorithm. First of all, the knowledge representation of the under-
water image is constructed by rough set. Then the image is divided into optimal partition 
according to the approximate equivalence relation between upper and lower approximation. 
Finally, an improved affine shadow formation model is used to enhance each layer of the 
image based on the optimal partition. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the 
algorithm.
1 INTRODUCTION
Due to the complexity of the underwater environment, the quality of the underwater images 
is usually unsatisfactory. In order to improve the image quality acquired from underwater, 
image enhancement is considered in this paper. The image enhancement is mainly divided 
into three categories (Wang W. et al. 2018). That is image enhancement based on additive 
noise model, statistical model and multiplicative noise model (Xu Y. et al. 2017). Such as 
Mask, Wallis, Curvelet, Contourlet, Retinex algorithm and so on. The Mask algorithm is 
commonly used in enhancing the SNR image. However, this algorithm needs to determine 
the optimal adaptive filter size (Shi C. et al. 2014). The Wallis algorithm is not suitable for a 
single image as it has to select the normal image and calculate the mean and variance (Tian J. 
et al. 2016). The Curvelet and Contourlet methods can effectively capture the outline of the 
image information, but they will result in a pseudo Gibbs phenomenon (Nason G. & Stevens 
K. 2015, Puranikmath S.S. & Vani K. 2016, Jai J.B.J. & Sudha G.F. 2014). The Retinex algo-
rithm which simulates the characteristics of the human visual system is widely used in solving 
such problem (Chang H. et al. 2015). Image enhancement based on Gaussian mixture model 
nonlinear mapping and image enhancement based on fuzzy C-means clustering method are 
lack of the protection of texture details (Zhao F. et al. 2016, Meena Prakash R. & Shantha 
S.K.R. 2016). The above methods cannot be directly used in processing the images obtained 
from the complex underwater environment. Rough set is a classic theory in studying incom-
plete and uncertain data expression. Rough set can acquire knowledge from large data and 
generate some mathematical rules. Therefore, it is feasible to apply rough set theory for image 
information processing (Guo Y. et al. 2017).
This paper proposes a novel image enhancement algorithm based on the rough set. The 
knowledge representation of the underwater image is used to gain the optimal partition. 
Then the improved affine shadow formation model is used to enhance each layer of the crack 
image based on the optimal partition. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the 
proposed algorithm.

2 THE PROPOSED METHOD
2.1 Modeling of image knowledge representation through rough set
First of all, the image knowledge representation based on rough set is established. Here we 
define a four-tuple:
 
S
f
(
,
V
) 
(1)
where U refers to the domain comprised by all the pixels of the image. R refers to the pixel 
gray and other attributes of the collection. V refers to the range value of the property R that 
is, the range of gray value with the same attribute in the image. f refers to the information 
function, that is, the mapping of pixels in the image to its attribute range.

(2)
Secondly, background is extracted to get the light distribution of the image. Regard neigh-
borhood image pixel gray value as knowledge R1. X and Y are the width and height of 
the image, respectively. K(i, j) is the neighborhood pixel value. Mask parameter filters the 
whole image through linear spatial mask. The value is calculated by Formula (2). The original 
underwater image and the result of background knowledge are shown in Figure 1.
Then, the brightness layers are calculated according to the upper and lower approximation 
(Phophalia A. & Mitra S.K. 2015). All pixels are divided into N sets. Each layer has the same 
brightness values. The results when N = 10 are shown in Figure 2.
2.2 Obtaining the optimal layer and enhancing the image layer by layer
After obtaining the brightness layers, the layer with over illumination or low illumination is 
repaired. Here we define [α β] (0 < α < β  < 1) is the normal area. And i < α ⋅ N is the dark 
area. i > β ⋅ N is the over illumination area. Then the repaired formula (3) is used for each layer.

upper and lower approximation is shown in Figure 3. From Figure 3, we can see when the 
number of layers is small, there are some obvious boundaries among the layers. It shows 
that the division is not enough. On the contrary, when the number of layers is large, for 
example N = 10, the result is shown in Figure 4. Amount of calculation will be significantly 
increased. It means there is an optimal division of layers between 10 and 200, leading to a 
better enhancement performance with the less calculation time.

is shown in Figure 5.
3 EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we show the performance of the proposed method by enhancing four typical 
images as shown in Figure 6.
In order to verify the performance improvement, we compare the proposed algorithm with 
other methods. Figure 7 shows a typical original image and the results of Mask (Shi C. et al. 
2014), Wallis (Tian J. et al. 2016), Retinex (Tao F. et al. 2017) and the proposed method  
(PRO), respectively.
As can be seen from Figure 7. Mask algorithm has enhanced the texture of the shaded area 
in some degree but not completely. Excessive illumination area has been added too. Wallis 
algorithm has balanced the illumination in local area, but due to the division of blocks there 
are some clear dividing lines among the blocks. The Retinex algorithm has better gray bal-
ance effect. However, the gray-scale of the original image is changed and the image contrast 
is reduced. The proposed algorithm has the best gray balance effect, with the texture feature

has been well preserved. In particular, the texture of the image boundary region is well main-
tained and enhanced.
4 CONCLUSION
In this paper, an underwater dam crack image enhancement algorithm based on Rough Set 
has been presented. The proposed algorithm can solve the low signal-to-noise ratio and une-
ven illumination problems of the image by upper/lower approximation. Besides, the proposed 
algorithm has the advantage of solving the optimal division for the set of pixels with approxi-
mate gray-scale. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Multi-sensor data fusion for sign language recognition based on 
dynamic Bayesian networks and convolution neural networks

Department of Electronic Information Engineering, Xi’an Technological University, 
Xi’an City, P.R. China
ABSTRACT: A new multi-sensor fusion framework is proposed, which is based on 
Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) for Sign Lan-
guage Recognition (SLR). In this framework, a Microsoft Kinect, which is a low-cost RGB-D 
sensor, is used as a tool for the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). In our method, firstly, 
the color and depth videos are collected using Kinect, then all image sequences features are 
extracted out using the CNN. The color and depth feature sequences are input into the DBN 
as observation data. Based on the graph model fusion machine, the maximum hidden state 
probability is calculated as recognition results of dynamic isolated sign language. The dataset is 
tested using the existing SLR methods. Using the proposed DBN+CNN SLR framework, the 
highest recognition rate can reach 99.40%. The test results show that our approach is effective.

1 INTRODUCTION
Sign language always provides a natural interaction pattern between people with normal 
hearing and those with a hearing impairment. The Sign Language Recognition (SLR) sys-
tem is designed to provide a powerful and reliable interface. As mentioned in (Chen et al., 
2003; Pugeault et al., 2012; Marin et al., 2016), the SLR system is playing an increasingly 
significant role in gesture-driven Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) systems. Hence, many 
researchers try their efforts on automatic hand gesture recognition. Recently, some low-cost 
depth sensors have been developed for new methods of HCI. Kinect is an effective and inex-
pensive device for acquiring depth data, and it has been successfully used in SLR systems 
(Almeida et al., 2014; Elons et al., 2014).
Recently, many sign language and hand gesture recognition systems have also utilized 3D 
depth sensors, such as Kinect. (Lang et al., 2012) proposed an open source framework for 
isolated gesture recognition using Kinect. The 25 symbols of the German Sign Language 
(GSL) were discriminated by the HMM and the accuracy went up to 97%. Pugeault et al., 
(2012) developed an interactive American Sign Language (ASL) hand-spelling system using 
Kinect, which uses static symbols. They also use depth and color information to complete 
hand segmentation, and the hand characteristics are extracted using Gabor filtering. The 
letters are recognized using a random forest classifier. The authors add a dictionary to the 
system, allowing users to select letters that are not clearly defined. Pedersoli et al., (2014) use 
a Kinect sensor to develop a system that recognizes static and dynamic gestures. Its principle 
is to extract the angle characteristics among hand centers in continuous frames based on the 
motion trajectory of the 3D hand.
Although the HMM is extremely powerful for the modeling of time series data, it can 
only be used in a simple state space with discrete hidden variables. Assume that we have two 
hidden variables, which are essentially independent, but these procedures affect each other 

330
and are highly related to each other. The state space will be as large as the product of the 
dimensions of all hidden variables if we use a traditional HMM to express a model with a 
single hidden variable. Therefore, we need a lot of data to estimate the model parameters. 
In addition, the conventional HMM can be used if the conditions under the Markov model 
are satisfied. Brand et al., (1997) construct CHMM by coupling HMM, which means that 
the model is likely to have interactions between different morphological structures and proc-
esses of mutual influence. Such issues frequently appear at computer vision, speech or both. 
The CHMM has been regarded as a particular type of Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) 
(Chu, & Huang, 2007), because its structure can capture the dependent relationship of asyn-
chronous and time modes between two different information channels. Brand et al., (1997) 
indicated that the CHMM was superior to traditional HMM in recognizing hand gestures, 
and its accuracy rate can reach 94.2%. A CHMM is regarded as multiple HMM collec-
tions, one of which is equivalent to a data flow. Nefian et al., (2002) simulate the audio and 
video sequences using an audio-visual word recognition system based on the double current 
CHMM. According to the report, the accuracy rate of word recognition can reach 98.14%, 
which is better than the basic HMM models. In this paper, we use a multi-sensor data fusion 
framework for sign language recognition using the CHMM.
2 PROPOSED SYSTEM
2.1 Overview of the system
In this paper, firstly, we use a multi-sensor device to get sign language information. As shown 
in Figure 1, Kinect is a good choice to obtain color and depth sign language sequence images 
at the same time. Secondly, based on the Convolution Neural Network (CNN), we can extract 
features of color and depth images. The CNN-based image features always provide excellent 
performance in many areas of computer vision, such as pattern recognition, image retrieval, 
video tracking and so on. Thirdly, the color and depth image feature sequences are input into 
the Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN). Based on inference of graph model probability, the 
image sequences can be classified correctly.
2.2 Extract features using the CNN
The CNN has made successful achievements in computer vision and solved many problems 
of feed-forward neural networks. The convolution layer is used to find the local relationship 
of the input layer, and the role of pooling layers is to gradually reduce the input dimension. 
When the CNN is used for gesture recognition tasks, the image is as input of the network, at 
the same time, the network will output the image labels or category probability. In this paper, 
we use the CNN to extract features of color and depth images, before the fully-connected 
layer is connected to the softmax regression layer, the CNN output image features, as shown 
in Figure 2. There are ten layers in the CNN, including an input layer, three convolution 
layers, three nonlinear layers, two max pooling layers, one fully-connected layer and one clas-
sification output layer. The first convolution layer is computed using 8 different 3 × 3 kernels 
Figure 1. Multi-sensor data fusion based on DBN for sign language recognition.

331
and the 8 feature maps are obtained, and the second convolution layer is computed using 16 
different 3 × 3 kernels, and 16 feature maps are obtained. The convolution layers are used to 
find the local relationship of the input layer. The corresponding pooling layer is the largest 
pooling layer in the 2 × 2 neighborhood domain, and the original size of the feature map is 
obtained. Similarly, the third convolution layer has 32 different 3 × 3 kernels. The fifth pool-
ing layer is connected to a fully-connected layer as the feature vector output.
2.3 Using DBN inference to classify sign language
2.3.1 Using DBN to represent sign language sequences
In this article, we use a revised Couple Hidden Markov Model (CHMM) for sign language 
sequential data modeling. The CHMM is a probability graph model, according to graph 
model theory, and the revised CHMM can be regarded as a kind of DBN (Marin et al., 2005).
As we all know, we often use the DBN to represent non-stationary random signals. Based 
on the DBN, we can analyze or calculate many non-stationary random signals. It is reason-
able to use the DBN graph model to describe human body movement according to graph 
model and non-liner signal processing theory. As Figure 3 shows, we build a mixed-state 
DBN model to represent a motion sequence. Our motivation is summarized as follows: (1) 
first of all, for a given input sequence signal Y(C), similar as the HMM viterbi encode, we 
can use the CHMM principle to estimate main sensor hidden sequence X(C) and assist-
ant sensor sequence X(D). (2) based on the X(D) and Y(D), in addition, another HMM is 
built, this means that there is a close relationship between the X(C) and the Y(D). Mean-
while, the Y(D) is as new-information to renew the prior estimation of X(C). Based on above 
analysis, we combine the two HMM together to build a mix-state DBN model, as shown in 
Figure 3.

2.3.2 Inference
In the DBN, the inference goal is to get the posterior probability of the hidden state. In order 
to achieve inference of the mixed-state DBN, we can first divide the DBN into two sub-
graphs: D-HMM and HMM, as shown in Figure 4. The D-HMM (Depth-Hidden Markov 
Model) is constructed based on HMM, the depth state sequence is added into color-based 
state sequence, and the final color state would be decided by color-based observation and 
depth-based state. Another sub-graph is HMM.
The detail of graph model inference can be described as follows. Firstly, HMM inference 
is discussed.

Based on above mentioned graph model inference, according to maximum probability 
sequence theory, we can obtain multi-sensor data fusion sign language classification results.
3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To test the proposed framework, we collected a sign language dataset. In this section, we 
firstly discuss the details of the sign language dataset. Next, we use DBN to show the recog-
nition results.
3.1 Dataset collection
As shown in Figure 5, we have collected datasets of sign language based on the Chinese 
Sign Language (CSL), which is composed of ten dynamic symbols. All gestures are done by 
only one hand. All sign gestures were done by the school’s ten different signers. Each signer 
repeats each signature gesture ten times, so that each signer creates a total of 100 signature 
gestures. Hence, we have collected 10,000 samples of symbolic words. The dataset includes 
various sign words. Datasets can be obtained online in future research (Nefian et al., 2002).
3.2 Sign language recognition consequence
We will divide the complete dataset into three parts, 60% of the total data is used for train-
ing, and the remaining data is used as the verification set and testing. We have tested our 
framework on the Core i5 CPU with 8 GB of RAM on the Microsoft Windows 10 operating 
system, and spent approximately 5 minutes on training the dataset.
In Figure 6, we show three kinds of sign language recognition results based on differ-
ent recognition composition. 6,000 images are considered as training data, 1,000 images are 
regarded as validation data, 3,000 images are taken as testing data. We only use depth camera 
to get video sequence. In Figure 6(a), we use the CNN (D) + Softmax method to classify 
sign language. The confusion matrix of testing data recognition is shown, the accuracy is 
91.6%. In Figure 6(b), we use the CNN(C) + Softmax method to classify sign language. In 
Figure 6(c), the confusion matrix of testing data recognition is shown, the accuracy is 95.4%, 
In Figure 6(a), we use the CNN(C) + CNN(D) + DBN method to classify sign language. In 
Figure 6(c), the confusion matrix of testing data recognition is shown, the accuracy is 99.2%.
To test the performance of DBN-based data fusion model, various recognition compo-
sition methods are compared. As shown Table 1, the overall recognition accuracy of the 
Figure 5. Illustration of collected sign language dataset, the color sequence is corresponding to depth 
sequence.

CNN(C) + CNN (D) + DBN composition is up to 99.40%. Compared with our method, 
the accuracy of the CNN (D) + Softmax composition is 91.2% and the accuracy of the 
CNN(C) + Softmax composition is 95.2%. The comparison results indicate that our method 
is perfect.
In Figure 7 some experiment results are illustrated, for example, in Figure 7(a), some key-
frame images in video are shown. The video recognition results are shown in Figure 7(c), and 
if we compare labels from Figure 7(b) to Figure 7(c), there is little difference between predic-
tion and truth, which means the results indicate that our proposed method is effectiveness.
4 CONCLUSIONS
In this article, we have proposed a SLR algorithm based on multi-sensor data fusion and 
deep learning. The method firstly built a mix-DBN to describe the SLR system, and in this 
model, the features are extracted using the CNN. Next, a fusion approach was proposed, 
based on graph model theory. Additionally we have tested the proposed algorithm on our 
SLR database. The comparison between the experimental results and the existing methods 
shows that this method is effective.

Weakly supervised co-segmentation by neural attention
Y. Zhao, F. Zhang, Z.L. Zhang & X.H. Liang
State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems, School of Computer Science 
and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China
ABSTRACT: Most existing co-segmentation algorithms mainly focus on using low-
level features, failing to deal with complex scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly 
supervised method that can learn high-level features of different images in an image group for 
accurate common object segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a top-down neural atten-
tion model to generate class-specific maps as aprior hint about possible foreground locations. 
Then, we apply a Fully Connected Conditional Random Field (FC-CRF) model for accurate 
boundary recovery. Our method only requires image-level classification tags as supervision, 
so it can significantly reduce the cost in producing training data. The comparison experi-
ments on the public datasets iCoseg and MSRC demonstrate the superior performance of 
the proposed method.
Keywords: co-segmentation, convolutional neural network, neural attention
1 INTRODUCTION
With the advance in digital cameras, smart phones and photo-sharing websites, people are now 
likely to amass large numbers of images, which might contain common objects. In computer 
vision, image segmentation has been one of the most attractive topics in the last few decades.
Given a set of images which share an object from the same semantic category, co-segmentation 
acts to segment the common objects. Most co-segmentation methods assume that the common 
objects have the same low-level features, such as color and intensity. However, these methods 
may fail when the scene is complex or when the objects are in the same class but are not the same.
Due to the observation that the low-level features are not robust enough, in this paper we 
propose an approach for co-segmentation based on extracting high-level semantic cues. Our 
approach is to adopt a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to support automatic high-
level feature extraction. CNN has been demonstrated to have superior performance in feature 
extraction for many computer vision areas (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; He et al., 2016; Ren et al., 
2017), especially the ability to capture semantic meaning. Fully supervised learning is costly

and inefficient because the ground truth data is manual pixel-wise annotation. Our approach 
of weak supervision only needs image-level tags as supervision. We adopt a top-down neural 
attention model CAM (Zhou et al., 2016) and it can map the class into an attention map 
which is able to capture the semantic information. Therefore, we obtain the class-specific 
attention map by mapping the common object class. Figure 1 shows the intermediate and 
final results of our method.
2 RELATED WORK
2.1 Co-segmentation
Since image co-segmentation was first put forward by Rother et al. (2006), it has received a 
lot of attention. They presented the MRF-based co-segmentation method, which segmented 
common objects through adding a foreground similarity constraint into traditional MRF-
based segmentation methods. Hochbaum and Singh (2009) then proposed a method that 
rewards the foreground similarity, with the result that the energy function could be optimized 
by a graph-cuts algorithm. Chang et al. (2011) introduced a co-saliency prior and used it to 
construct the MRF data terms; the submodular energy function could also be efficiently 
optimized with graph cut. Collins et al. (2012) used Random Walker (RW) segmentation 
as the core segmentation algorithm, rather than the traditional MRF approach. Rubinstein 
et al. (2013) proposed to use dense correspondences between images to capture the sparsity 
and visual variability of the common objects, so it ignores the noise that might be salient 
within their own images but did not commonly occur in others. For each image, Li et al. 
(2016) proposed a multi-search strategy to extract each target individually, and an adaptive 
decision criterion was raised to give each candidate a reliable judgment automatically. Most 
of these co-segmentation methods assume the common objects contain similar colors. The 
fixed features are used to measure the foreground similarity for co-segmentation, which pro-
duces unsuccessful co-segmentation results when different common objects contain different 
types of low-level features.
2.2 Top-down neural attention of CNNs
Top-down factors such as expectations, goals and knowledge can influence the co-segmenta-
tion result. Various methods have been proposed for modelling the top-down neural atten-
tion. Simonyan et al. (2014) applied a CNN to visualize relevant image regions for a certain 
class by activated hidden neurons. They made use of a back-propagation process to extract 
the attention maps. Cao et al. (2015) proposed feedback CNN architecture for capturing 
the top-down attention mechanism that could successfully identify task-relevant regions. 
Zhou et al. (2016) developed a mapping method by using the global average pooling layer in 
CNNs which has remarkable localization ability despite only being trained on image-level 
labels.
3 MODEL
Given a set of M images 
i
M
{ }
I i
=1 for co-segmentation, the foreground of Ii is the area Ri con-
taining an instance of the common object.
Figure 2 illustrates the procedure for our weakly supervised co-segmentation method. We 
establish two training sets which contain the same image classes as that in the iCoseg dataset 
and the MSRC dataset. Then we train a ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016) for classification with 
only image-level tags. The Softmax loss function is represented in the following equation:

where K is the number of classes, yi = {0,1} represents the existence of the corresponding 
class label, and k is the neural unit whose class label is 1.
The class of the input image group is identified by the predicted probability of each image. 
We can extract the top-down attention maps through the remarkable localization ability of 
CAM. Due to the pooling, the size of the feature maps is small and the attention maps are 
vague and blurred after up-sampling. Therefore, we apply a fully connected CRF model to 
refine the results.
3.1 Identifying the co-class
The co-class is the class of the image group where each image contains the same category 
of object. Although the ResNet-50 achieves a high classification accuracy, a small number 
of images still cannot be classified correctly. Determining the image class only by individual 
image is therefore not reliable enough. To tackle the problem, we exploit the classification 
result of related images to address the limitation of a single image. We identify the co-class 
of the input image group by summing the predicted probabilities corresponding to the clas-
sification labels of each image, which is formulated as follows:
 
c
argma
g
x
P
m
n
n m
P
∑
,  
(3)
where c is the class of the image group, and Pn,m is the probability that the n-th image is clas-
sified into the m-th class. The class having the maximum sum of probabilities is regarded as 
the co-class for the image group.
3.2 Extracting attention map
The attention map for a particular category indicates the discriminative image regions used 
by the CNN to identify that category. We extract our attention map by CAM, which is illus-
trated in Figure 3.
We perform global average pooling instead of max pooling on the convolutional feature 
maps and use those as features for a fully-connected layer that produces the Softmax output 
layer. The importance of the image regions can be represented by the weights of the output 
layer. Global average pooling outputs the spatial average of the feature map of each unit 
at the last convolutional layer. The class-specific attention map, which represents high-level

semantic information, is obtained by computing a weighted sum of the feature maps of 
the last convolutional layer. We define Ac as the attention map for co-class c, and it can be 
obtained as follows:

where wk
c  is the weight corresponding to co-class c for unit k, and Fk is the k-th feature map 
of the last convolutional layer. In Figure 4, we show some results of CAM and we observe 
that discriminative regions of each image for co-class are highlighted.
3.3 Refining by fully connected CRF
As a classical probabilistic graphical model, Fully Connected Conditional Random Field 
(FC-CRF) (Krahenbuhl & Koltun, 2011) considers both node priors and consistency between 
nodes. Since the attention map obtained in the previous subsection is vague, we apply an FC-
CRF model to both enhance spatial coherence and refine boundary accuracy. Every pixel is 
regarded as a node, and every node is connected to every other node. The energy function is 
showed as follows:

4 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
In this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two public datasets 
iCoseg (Batra et al., 2010) and MSRC (Winn et al., 2005). The MSRC and iCoseg datasets 
are widely used in co-segmentation which contain pixel-wise, level, manually labelled ground 
truth.
To quantitatively evaluate the performance of our proposed method against the state-
of-the-art co-segmentation methods, we adopt two widely used evaluation metrics: IoU 
(Intersection over Union) score and mean error rate. The quantitative comparison result will 
be presented in subsection 4.2.
In the experiments, we use the ResNet-50 trained over ImageNet dataset (Krizhevsky et al., 
2012) as a basic CNN, and fine-tune it with the training dataset which has the same class as 
iCoseg or MSRC; notice that we treat the players in white and red as two different classes. We 
implemented the proposed method with Caffe (Jia et al., 2014) and the experiments are con-
ducted on a PC with an Intel Xeon CPU and a TITAN X GPU. For fine-tuned details, the 
learning rate is 0.001 and the momentum is 0.9. As for hyper-parameters of fully connected 
CRF, we use the following parameters: w1 = w2 = 1, σα = 40, σβ = 10, σγ = 3.
4.1 Subjective results
For subjective comparison, we apply our method on two benchmark datasets, iCoseg and 
MSRC, to further test the performance. The co-segmentation results of ten classes are shown 
in Figure 5; the left block is from iCoseg and the other is from MSRC. For each image class, 
five original images and the co-segmentation results are presented.
The images in the same group contain considerable changes in viewpoints, outlines and 
illumination. In some more challenging image groups, the background is complex and the 
target objects are diverse.
The co-segmentation result will be more robust if the high-level semantic information is 
included. The examples in groups ‘dog’ and ‘cat’ indicate that our proposed method can 
effectively locate the co-segmentation objects even when the target objects vary significantly, 
such as by color, shape, and texture. In relation to groups ‘face’ and ‘car’, whose background 
is very complicated, our proposed method has a strong ability to suppress the complex back-
ground, benefitting from the semantic information.
4.2 Quantitative results
We evaluate the proposed co-segmentation method by the mean error rate and IoU score. 
The error rate is defined as the ratio of the number of wrongly segmented pixels to the total 
number of pixels, meaning that a small error rate refers to a successful segmentation and the 
mean error rate over all images is used to evaluate the performance of an image group.
In Tables 1 and 2, we compare our method with the existing co-segmentation approaches: Li 
et al. (2016), Joulin et al. (2010), Joulin et al. (2012), Vicente et al. (2011), Meng et al. (2012) and 

342
Wang et al. (2014). Since there is no unified evaluation measurement, we adopt a different meas-
urement for iCoseg (mean error rate) and MSRC (Intersection-over-Union score) in order to use 
as many publicly available evaluation results as possible for fair comparison. It can be seen that 
our proposed method achieves promising performance; it achieves the lowest error rates for many

dataset and the right block is the MSRC dataset.

image groups. The other comparison methods also achieve good performance in the iCoseg data-
set, since the common objects contain similar colors in the iCoseg dataset. For MSRC dataset, the 
IoU rates over all classes are 0.61, 0.63, 0.59, 0.39, 0.44 and 0.72 for the methods in Li et al. (2016), 
Wang et al. (2014), Meng et al. (2012), Joulin et al. (2010), Joulin et al. (2012) and our proposed 
method, respectively. The IoU score is increased by our proposed method.
4.3 Discussion
In our experiment, we use ResNet-50 as the basic CNN, and the attention map generated 
from ResNet-50 is satisfactory. To further improve the result, enhancing the performance of 
the attention map in both precision and recall is significant.
In this paper, common targets are mainly defined as objects of the same category. How-
ever, in the iCoseg dataset, an image group of football players exists; players in red clothes or 
white are more likely to be viewed as the real common targets since they appear in every sin-
gle image and are highly correlated with each other. Accordingly, we treat football players in 
red and white clothes as two different classes. To some extent, the problem was solved. Thus, 
integrating with high-level features in our method will give a better solution.
5 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we discover the top-down neural attention and introduce high-level semantic fea-
tures into co-segmentation by CAM. We propose a weakly supervised co-segmentation method 
by class-specific attention and FC-CRF. The attention map has the ability to highlight dis-
criminative object regions across a set of relevant images without requiring pixel-level or any 
bounding box annotations. In our evaluation on the challenging iCoseg dataset and the MSRC 
dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method qualitatively and quantitatively.
If the attention map can cover all the implied common targets, it will improve the effi-
ciency of the proposed method. In the future, we will extend our proposed learning method 
with more discriminative ability for co-segmentation.
