CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION TO
WINDOWS 11
1.1. The Evolution of Windows: A Brief History
Windows 11 represents the latest evolution in Microsoftâs long history of
operating systems. To truly understand the significance of Windows 11, itâs
essential to take a brief journey through the history of Windows.
Early Windows Versions
The journey begins with Windows 1.0, released in 1985. It was a graphical
user interface (GUI) shell for MS-DOS and introduced the concept of
overlapping windows, icons, and menus. Windows 2.0 followed,
introducing features like desktop icons and improved graphics.
Windows 3.0, released in 1990, was a significant milestone. It brought true
multitasking, enhanced graphics, and support for more applications.
Windows 3.1 and Windows 3.11 (Workgroups) further refined the
experience.
The Windows 95 Era
Windows 95, released inâyou guessed itâ1995, was a game-changer. It
introduced the iconic Start menu, taskbar, and the 32-bit architecture. Plug
and Play hardware support made life easier for users.
The Windows NT Lineage
Windows NT, initially released in 1993, was the foundation for Windows
2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10. This lineage brought a robust and stable
platform for businesses and power users.

Windows XP: A Fan Favorite
Windows XP, released in 2001, became a fan favorite. Its polished interface
and improved stability made it a long-lasting choice for many users.
The Windows 7 and 8 Era
Windows 7 (2009) and Windows 8 (2012) brought significant changes, with
Windows 7 focusing on refining the Windows experience, and Windows 8
introducing a touch-centric interface.
Windows 10: A Step Towards Convergence
Windows 10, launched in 2015, aimed to unify the Windows ecosystem
across devices. It introduced features like the Cortana virtual assistant, the
Edge browser, and a universal app platform.
Enter Windows 11
And now, we arrive at Windows 11. Released in 2021, Windows 11 builds
upon the foundation of Windows 10 while introducing a refreshed user
interface, new features, and enhanced performance. Itâs designed to provide
a modern and efficient computing experience.
In this book, we will explore the ins and outs of Windows 11, from its user
interface to advanced customization, security, and productivity features.
Whether youâre a new user or upgrading from a previous version, this book
will help you master Windows 11 and make the most of your computing
experience. Letâs dive in!
1.2. Overview of Windows 11: Key Features and
Enhancements

Windows 11 brings a host of key features and enhancements that make it a
notable upgrade from its predecessor, Windows 10. In this section, weâll
delve into the standout features and improvements that define Windows 11.
Redesigned Start Menu and Taskbar
One of the most noticeable changes in Windows 11 is the redesigned Start
Menu and Taskbar. The Start Menu is now centered, providing a cleaner
and more modern look. Live Tiles are replaced with static icons for a
streamlined appearance. The Taskbar is also centered by default but can be
moved to the left if you prefer the classic alignment.
To customize the Taskbar position, right-click on it, go to "Taskbar
settings," and choose your preferred alignment under "Taskbar alignment."
Snap Layouts and Snap Groups
Windows 11 introduces Snap Layouts and Snap Groups, making
multitasking more efficient. Snap Layouts allow you to easily arrange open
windows into various layouts, such as side by side or in a grid. Snap Groups
help you organize and switch between groups of apps and windows.
To use Snap Layouts, drag a window to the screen's edge, and it will snap
into a suggested layout. To create a Snap Group, open multiple apps, right-
click on a taskbar group, and select "Group."
Widgets for Quick Information
Widgets are a new addition to Windows 11, providing at-a-glance
information such as weather, news, calendar events, and more. You can
access widgets by clicking the Widgets button on the Taskbar.

To customize widgets, click the Widgets button, then click the three dots at
the top of the widgets panel and select "Add widgets" to choose the ones
you want to see.
Enhanced Virtual Desktops
Virtual Desktops have been enhanced in Windows 11. You can now
customize each desktop with different wallpapers and apps. Itâs an excellent
way to organize your workspaces for different tasks or projects.
To create a new Virtual Desktop, press Win + Tab, then click "New
Desktop" at the top. To move windows between desktops, drag them to the
desired desktop in the Task View.
Redesigned Microsoft Store
The Microsoft Store has undergone a significant redesign, making it more
user-friendly and efficient. It offers a wider range of apps, including support
for Android apps, and allows developers more flexibility in publishing their
software.
Explore the new Microsoft Store by clicking the Microsoft Store icon on
your Taskbar. You'll find a refreshed interface and a wider selection of apps.
Gaming Enhancements
For gamers, Windows 11 brings several enhancements, including DirectX
12 Ultimate support, Auto HDR for compatible games, and integration with
Xbox Game Pass.
To enable Auto HDR, make sure your hardware supports it, and then enable
it in the Windows settings under "Gaming" > "Xbox Game Pass."

These are just a few of the key features and improvements in Windows 11.
As we delve deeper into this book, youâll discover even more ways to make
the most of your Windows 11 experience.

you use most frequently. You can customize this section by right-clicking
on an app and selecting âPin to Start.â
Below the Pinned section, youâll find Recommended apps based on your
usage patterns. These suggestions can help you discover new apps or
quickly access commonly used ones.
The Taskbar

The Taskbar in Windows 11 is typically centered, but you can move it to the
left if you prefer the classic alignment. It hosts icons for various functions,
including the Start Menu, Task View, Widgets, and system notifications.
To move the Taskbar to the left, right-click on it, go to "Taskbar settings,"
and change the "Taskbar alignment" to "Left."

punctuation in file names. Avoid special characters or symbols that
may cause compatibility issues.
4. Use Underscores or Hyphens: When separating words in a file name,
consider using underscores (_) or hyphens (-) instead of spaces for
better compatibility.
5. Version Numbers: If you frequently update files, consider including
version numbers in file names (e.g., âProject_Report_V1.docxâ).
6. Consistent Capitalization: Choose a consistent capitalization style
(e.g., camelCase, TitleCase, or lowercase) and stick to it.
File Metadata

File metadata, such as tags and properties, can be valuable for organizing
and searching for files. Windows 11 allows you to add metadata to files:
1. Tags: You can add tags to files to categorize them. Right-click on a
file, select âProperties,â and go to the âDetailsâ tab to add tags.
2. File Properties: In the âDetailsâ tab of file properties, you can enter
additional information like author, title, and comments. This can be
useful for document management.
Regular Cleanup
Maintaining your file system requires periodic cleanup:
1. Delete Unnecessary Files: Regularly go through your files and delete
any that are no longer needed. This reduces clutter and frees up storage
space.
2. Move or Archive Old Files: For files you want to keep but donât need
to access frequently, consider moving them to an archive folder or an
external drive.
3. Empty the Recycle Bin: After deleting files, remember to empty the
Recycle Bin to free up disk space.
Backups
Always maintain backups of important files to protect against data loss. Use
Windows 11âs built-in backup tools or third-party backup solutions to
regularly back up your files to an external drive or cloud storage.

organized and maintainable. Modules are collections of functions and
variables that can be easily shared and imported into your scripts.
Hereâs an example of defining a simple function in PowerShell:
function Say-Hello {
param (
[string]$Name
)

Write-Host "Hello, $Name!"
}
# Call the function
Say-Hello -Name "John"
2. Error Handling
Effective error handling is crucial in scripting. PowerShell provides
mechanisms to catch and handle errors gracefully. The try, catch, and finally
blocks allow you to control what happens when an error occurs. For
example:
try {
# Attempt an operation that may generate an error
Get-Content -Path "NonExistentFile.txt"
}
catch {
# Handle the error
Write-Host "An error occurred: $_"
}
finally {

# Code in this block runs regardless of whether there was an error
Write-Host "Cleanup or final actions here"
}
3. Remote Script Execution
PowerShell enables you to run scripts on remote computers. The Invoke-
Command cmdlet allows you to execute commands or scripts on remote
machines, making it a powerful tool for managing and automating tasks
across a network.
# Execute a command on a remote computer
Invoke-Command -ComputerName "RemoteComputer" -ScriptBlock {
Get-Process }
4. Scheduled Tasks
You can use PowerShell to create and manage scheduled tasks. The New-
ScheduledTaskTrigger and Register-ScheduledTask cmdlets allow you to
schedule scripts to run at specific times or intervals.
# Create a scheduled task that runs a script daily
$Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Daily -At "3:00 AM"
Register-ScheduledTask -Action { Invoke-Expression -Command

PowerShell Desired State Configuration is a powerful feature for ensuring
that your systems are configured as desired and remain in the desired state.
You define configurations using PowerShell scripts, and DSC ensures that
systems comply with those configurations.
# Define a DSC configuration
Configuration MyConfiguration {
Node "localhost" {
WindowsFeature IIS {
Ensure = "Present"
Name = "Web-Server"
}
}
}
# Apply the configuration
MyConfiguration
Start-DscConfiguration -Path .\MyConfiguration -Wait -Verbose
6. Working with JSON and REST APIs

PowerShell excels at working with structured data like JSON. You can use
ConvertTo-Json and ConvertFrom-Json cmdlets to interact with JSON data.
Additionally, PowerShell can make HTTP requests to REST APIs using
Invoke-RestMethod.
# Fetch data from a REST API
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.example.com/data"
$response | ConvertTo-Json | Set-Content -Path "data.json"

Section 11.4: Understanding User Account
Control (UAC) and Permissions
User Account Control (UAC) is a crucial security feature in Windows 11
that helps protect your computer and data by controlling and limiting the
permissions of applications and processes. In this section, weâll explore
UAC, its purpose, and how to manage it effectively.
What is User Account Control (UAC)?
UAC was introduced in Windows Vista and has been a part of every
Windows version since. Its primary purpose is to prevent unauthorized
changes to your computer and data by requiring that certain actions and
tasks be approved by an administrator or user with administrative
privileges.
When UAC is enabled, Windows distinguishes between standard user
accounts and administrator accounts. Standard users have limited access to
system files and settings, while administrator accounts have elevated
privileges. Even if youâre using an administrator account, many tasks and
applications run with standard user permissions by default.
How UAC Works
When an application or process attempts to perform a task that requires
elevated privileges (e.g., making system changes, installing software, or
modifying critical settings), UAC prompts the user with a dialog box asking
for permission. This dialog box is known as the UAC prompt or elevation
prompt.
The UAC prompt includes the following options:

â¢  Yes: This option allows the task to proceed with administrative
privileges. If you initiated the action intentionally, you can click âYesâ to
continue.
â¢  No: Clicking âNoâ denies the task the required administrative privileges,
and it wonât be executed.
â¢  Show Details: If available, this option provides more information about
the task before making a decision.
Configuring UAC Settings
You can configure UAC settings to meet your security and convenience
preferences. To access UAC settings:
1. Open Control Panel.
2. Go to System and Security.
3. Under Security and Maintenance, click on Change User Account
Control settings.
Youâll see a slider with four levels of UAC control:
â¢  Always notify: This is the highest security level. It prompts for consent
for any action that requires administrative privileges.
â¢  Notify me only when apps try to make changes: This is the default
setting. It notifies you when apps attempt to make changes but not for
Windows settings changes.

â¢  Notify me only when apps try to make changes (do not dim my
desktop): Similar to the previous setting, but it doesnât dim the screen
when showing the UAC prompt.
â¢  Never notify: This is the lowest security level. UAC is effectively
disabled, and actions requiring administrative privileges proceed without
prompts.
Itâs essential to strike a balance between security and convenience when
configuring UAC. While disabling it entirely can make your system more
vulnerable to unauthorized changes, setting it too high may lead to frequent

LRESULT CALLBACK WindowProc(HWND hwnd, UINT uMsg,
WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam) {
switch (uMsg) {
case WM_DESTROY:
PostQuitMessage(0);
return 0;
default:
return DefWindowProc(hwnd, uMsg, wParam, lParam);
}
}
int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE
hPrevInstance, LPSTR lpCmdLine, int nCmdShow) {
// Register the window class

const wchar_t CLASS_NAME[] = L"SampleWindowClass";
WNDCLASS wc = {0};
wc.lpfnWndProc = WindowProc;
wc.hInstance = hInstance;
wc.lpszClassName = CLASS_NAME;
RegisterClass(&wc);
// Create the window
HWND hwnd = CreateWindowEx(
0,  // Optional window styles
CLASS_NAME,  // Window class
L"Sample Window",  // Window title
WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW,  // Window style
CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT,  // Window position
CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT,  // Window size
NULL,  // Parent window
NULL,  // Menu

hInstance,  // Instance handle

);
if (hwnd == NULL) {
return 0;
}
ShowWindow(hwnd, nCmdShow);
// Main message loop
MSG msg = {0};
while (GetMessage(&msg, NULL, 0, 0)) {
TranslateMessage(&msg);
DispatchMessage(&msg);
}
return 0;
}
This code creates a basic window using the Windows API, which responds
to the WM_DESTROY message and exits when the window is closed.
