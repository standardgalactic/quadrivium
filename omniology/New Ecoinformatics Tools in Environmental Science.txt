Preface
The design problem of geoinformation monitoring systems needs the solution of a
wide spectrum of tasks incoming to the competence of many areas of knowledge.
The complex character of this problem is stipulated by the assembly of heteroge-
neous and differently systematic and applied research that is realized in many
countries in the framework of national and international environmental programs.
The basic goal of all similar researches consists in the attempt to answer the unique
basic question: What structure and working regime of the observation system are to
be in order to guarantee the reliable assessments of its current state and the prog-
nosis of its evolution in the nearest and perspective future? Unfortunately, present
science does not give an afﬁrmative reply to this question. Ecoinformatics tries to
answer this question by developing new informational technologies and producing
a theoretical base for a new stage of the environmental science developing.
Ecoinformatics is the science of information in ecology and environmental
science that integrates environmental and information sciences. Ecoinformatics tries
to create the tools for the assessment and analysis of natural systems that exist under
different conditions. In this context, ecoinformatics develops computer technologies
relevant to the management of ecological data and information delivered existing
and planned geoinformational systems. As a result ecoinformatics proposes new
tools based on the coupled use of ecological, geophysical, and mathematical
knowledge to integrate information, data, methods, algorithms, and computer
technologies for providing ecological data to scientiﬁc or policy making processes.
Ecoinformatics is studying the problems that arise due to use of informatics
methods for solution of environment control tasks. It is developed areas such as
elaboration of new informational technologies for monitoring data processing,
making and development of algorithms for spatial–temporal interpolation, analysis
of correlation functions in the nature–anthropogenic systems taking into account
hierarchy of spatial and temporal scales, and search for the most efﬁcient methods
for the synthesis of monitoring system structures.
Ecoinformatics devotes priority to technologies in the framework in which the
informatics methods are used for research of dynamic characteristics of environ-
mental systems, assessment of large-scale consequences of anthropogenic activity,
v

and prognosis of biogeochemical processes from local to global scales. This ﬁeld of
study also includes a creation and application of mathematical models for natural
and anthropogenic processes, search of criteria for reliable assessment of human
living condition quality, and detection of causes stimulating the disturbances of
sanitary epidemiological conditions in the environment.
Ecoinformatics studies theoretical and applied tasks that are aimed at under-
standing the role of mathematical modeling methods, theory of complex systems,
nonlinear programming, computer cartography, remote sensing technology, and
expert systems in the study of processes happening in the environment.
Ecoinformatics joins knowledge from such areas as physics, mathematics,
biology, chemistry, sociology, ecology, economics, and law that solve environ-
mental problems. It helps to ﬁnd answers to many questions on the conﬂicts
between nature and human society. Most experts suggest that an efﬁcient way to
resolve these conﬂicts would be creation of a uniﬁed planetary-scale adaptive
geoinformation monitoring system, which should be based on knowledge bases and
global datasets that are constantly updated. The adaptive nature of such a system
should be provided by continuously correcting the data acquisition mode and by
varying the parameters and structure of the global model.
This book develops ideas and technologies that could help solve many envi-
ronmental problems and describes a simulation system based on sets of computer
algorithms that process data from global and regional monitoring. The book has ten
chapters that consider various aspects of the environmental problems and develops
information-modeling technologies for operational diagnostics of environmental
processes including stressful natural phenomena. In particular, the book discusses
the following topics:
• Natural catastrophes as a dynamic category of environmental phenomena;
• Remote sensing and mathematical modeling for effective forecast of large-scale
land territories and water areas behavior;
• Practical applications of microwave radiometric technologies along with other
remote sensing technologies in different situations in hydrology for underground
water mapping and for ﬁre hazard determination in forested and peat bog
environments;
• Decision making in complicated conditions;
• Evolution modeling in ecology and hydrometeorology;
• Arctic Basin pollution dynamics under intensive anthropogenic forcing due to a
variety of industrial activities;
• Target-oriented models that may be effective in socioeconomic areas; and
• Regional and global ecological monitoring functioning based on the funda-
mentals of the noosphere paradigm.
The book discusses the global implications of environmental degradation—a
model for predicting anthropogenic inﬂuences on global environmental change and
for incorporating monitoring data into the predictions. Global problems of the
nature–society system dynamics are considered and the key problems of ensuring
vi
Preface

its sustainable development are studied. Emphasis is placed on global geoinfor-
mation monitoring, which could provide a reliable control for the development of
environmental processes by obtaining prognostic estimates of the consequences
of the realization of anthropogenic projects. Ecoinformatics tools developed in this
book offer a new approach to the study of global environmental changes, focusing
on it as an area of study involving many scientiﬁc disciplines. These tools provide a
unique insight into the social context of global changes in biogeochemical cycles,
and is a timely contribution to the current debate into global warming and sus-
tainable development of the nature–society system.
The book is aimed at specialists dealing with the development of information-
modeling technologies to protect the natural world. Global modeling, climate
change, problems inherent in relationships between society and nature, geopolitics,
international relations, and methodology of interdisciplinary studies are studied in-
depth. It is of special interest to designers and users of information-modeling
technologies in the ﬁeld of population protection from natural disasters.

Summary
The greatly enhanced awareness today of environmental problems has led to a
resurgence of interest in all aspects of global environmental monitoring. The need
to reduce pollution of the hydrosphere and to reduce the risk of damage from
extreme environmental processes has led to a large increase in the number of the-
oretical and applied investigations in the ﬁeld of global ecoinformatics. The growth
of needs in practically all spheres of remote environmental monitoring has resulted
in numerous problems arising from the many unsolved tasks including the
assessment of important characteristics of the soil–plant formations and oceans. It
has become a priority to develop new concepts and approaches for assessing and
dealing with natural and man-made system dynamics. A major priority is global
problems connected with creation of effective information technologies to data
processing within the environment studies.
The complexity, importance, and interdisciplinary nature of ecoinformatics
allow the solution of many environmental problems by means of combined use of
environmental monitoring systems and mathematical models. The main objective
of the book lies in the working information technology for the combined use of
modeling technology and remote sensing measurements in the assessment of
environmental system states as well as to illustrate this technology with computer
calculations for various environmental problems. Different tasks related to the
assessment and prognosis of natural systems’ dynamics are solved based on the
remote sensing measurements using mobile platforms. New information-modeling
technology is proposed to be used for optimization of remote sensing monitoring
systems. This technology is based on sets of computer algorithms for compre-
hensive analysis of data from global and regional monitoring systems.
The chapters in the theoretical part of the book contain descriptions of rigorous
algorithms and environmental models. The applied part considers speciﬁc problems
of environmental dynamics in areas of different countries where on-site experiments
were realized to test new information-modeling technology that enhances the GIS
to GIMS.

This book is the result of a detailed study of the environment by means of
computer algorithms and simulation models. It describes the sets of algorithms and
models for comprehensive analysis of data from global and regional monitoring
systems. The main purpose of this book is to develop a universal information-
modeling technology to estimate the characteristics of environmental subsystems
both at global and regional scales. Applied mathematicians, hydrologists, geo-
physicists, radiophysicists, and other researchers of the environment will ﬁnd a
wealth of information in this book.
This book should prove useful to students in a variety of disciplines since it
provides basic information in an interdisciplinary area and encourages students,
through the references supplied, to seek out and to read the original monographs
and articles cited. It should also be of interest to professionals in academia, in
consulting ofﬁces, and government agencies, and to others responsible for the
investigation, evaluation, and solution of complicated environmental issues.

Information-Modeling Technology
for the Environmental Monitoring
1.1 The Principal Conception of the Information-Modeling
Technology
The methods of the local environment diagnostics do not provide complex
assessment for an environmental element (i.e., natural objects or process states),
especially in the case when this environmental element occupies extensive space.
Any technical means for the data collection of the environment allow production of
information that is characterized as episodic in time and fragmentary in space. In
particular, the microwave remote-sensing systems that are widely used to equip the
ﬂying laboratories and the natural-resources satellites supply the data sets that are
geographically distributed. Reconstruction of the information obtained is possible
only by employing methods of spatial-temporal interpolation for the development
of which several techniques and algorithms of simulation modeling have been used
in the past (e.g., Cakaj 2010; Cracknell et al. 2009a; Krapivin and Shutko 2012).
For example, the spatial modeling has been widely used for the interpretation of the
data obtained by environmental instruments, which monitor the lithosphere, cryo-
sphere, hydrosphere, vegetation interfaces and urban environments (Kelly et al.
2005; Polishchuk and Polishchuk 2013; Soldatov 2011; Kareiva 2001; Le Corbusie
1977; Lu and Li 2003; Safai et al. 2004).
For the accomplishment of the complex task of the environmental diagnostics, it
is necessary to built up a system that incorporates such functions, as well as data
collection (by means of remote sensing and in-situ methods), their analysis and
processing. A system of this type is capable to conduct systematic observations and
assessments of the environmental state, to predetermine forecasting diagnostics of
changes of the environmental elements (due to anthropogenic impacts) and to
analyze the evolution of environmental processes, taking into account the anthro-
pogenic scenarios. One of the system functions is to provide warnings about
undesirable changes in the environment. Attainment of such functions for

environmental monitoring is feasible with the use of simulation methods allowing
the development of a model for the investigation of the natural subsystem.
The development of models for the description of environmental, biogeo-
chemical, hydrophysical, climatic and socio-economic processes (that provide the
synthesis of images for its subsystems), inevitably demands the establishment of
monitoring systems with processing and formation of suitable databases. As has
already been demonstrated by many authors there exist several balanced criteria for
the information selection, taking into account the hierarchy in the cause-effect
correlations within the biosphere. These include a co-ordination of the acceptance
and the depth in the spatial discretisation, in order the atmosphere, the land eco-
systems and the hydrosphere to be fully described (Krapivin 2000b; Mustard 2001;
Smith 2008).
As it has already been shown by numerous studies, an application of mathe-
matical modeling for the satellite monitoring systems may yield practical outcome
only with the creation of a unique data network that should be consolidated to the
model of nature-society system (NSS). In general, the reconstruction of a spatial
image of a speciﬁc territory of the ecosystem by utilizing the multi-channel
information from different sensors requires the accomplishment of the optimization
task. For the latter, it is necessary to determine the optimal structure for the
monitoring system with high reliability of the results obtained.
To accomplish this task the Global Information—Modeling System (GIMS) that
has been developed by Krapivin (1993, 2000d) could be employed. The GIMS tool
considers each environmental sub-system as a part of the global nature-society
system. In this case, a speciﬁc model of the ecosystem has boundary conditions that
are deﬁned by GIMS. The development and use of the GIMS is mainly based on the
Information-Modeling Technology for the Environmental Monitoring (IMTEM)
that optimizes the monitoring system structure at the expense of its adaptive regime.
A conceptual scheme of an adaptive regime for environmental monitoring premises
the assumption of architecture of such monitoring system, which brings together
knowledge from different disciplines and enables to manage the supply of this
knowledge. This is possible through the combined use of GIS technology, simu-
lation modeling and methods for expert systems (Maguire et al. 1991).
The global information system (GIS)
tool guarantees the geographical data
processing, the relation with existing databases and the topological representation
for studied territories. With the help of technology modeling, the GIS can be
extended to GIMS, modifying some functions of the user interface for computer
cartographic systems, including forecasting assessments of conditions for envi-
ronmental system functioning within predeﬁned scenarios. Furthermore, these
parametric changes can be used both for the evaluation of model coefﬁcients and for
the prognostic assessment of environmental dynamics based on the evolutionary
modeling. Such a modiﬁcation requires the support of combining mathematical
modeling with remote sensing to solve the following problems (Krapivin and
Shutko 2012):

Information-Modeling Technology for the Environmental Monitoring

• Forecast of the onset and the dangerous level of natural disasters, the emergency
situations and the manmade catastrophes.
• Control of possible disasters and catastrophes (including complex meteorolog-
ical conditions) with the provision of information for decision making.
• Impact assessment of disasters and catastrophes for cities, agricultural and forest
areas, sea and coastal ﬂora and fauna.
• Delivery plans for rescue operations.
The broadening of the GIS functions to the GIMS by means of the IMTEM
technology enables to solve key work packages of large-scale industrial centers,
like the following:
• Investigation of seasonal parameters for municipal and suburban landscapes,
geophysical ﬁelds and local anomalies of various types, detection of laws for
phenomenological and topological characteristics of disasters, representation of
the investigation results in the form of thematic maps of standardized scales.
• Development of the proper methodology for the assessment of ecological and
sanitary state of living, industrial, forest-park and suburban zones, reservoirs and
rivers, main heating and gasoline lines, transport and electrical nets.
• Investigation of seasonal and daily dynamics of characteristics for areas where
municipal and industrial wastes are stores, as well as for pollution sources of
land covers, atmosphere and reservoirs.
• Solution of inverse tasks and elaboration of statistical similarity criteria with
regard to the local anthropogenic and geophysical features of municipal and
suburban territories, low atmosphere, cloudiness and ozone layer, pollution
dynamics and their features.
Monitoring systems based on IMTEM technology can be carried out using the
data delivered from the following levels of information with appropriate techniques,
methodical and metrology bases:
(1) Measurements by means of satellite sensors.
• estimations of global ecological characteristics for studied region (taking
into account the monitoring needs for lower levels).
• determination of the optical transparency, the state of gas and aerosol
constituents in the Earth’s atmosphere.
• principal characteristics of anthropogenic pollution of the atmosphere (e.g.,
state of the ozone layer) and water basins.
• state of land covers and architectural objects.
(2) Special investigations performed by the boards of multi-purpose and special
ﬂying laboratories about the:
• ecological characteristics of regional environment (taking into account the
third and fourth level needs).
• energetic and polarization characteristics of microwave ﬁelds that charac-
terize the urban and other landscapes.
1.1

• radio-thermal and radar images of urban regions, megacities, forests, etc.
• images and parameters of heat ﬁeld of landscape in near and far IR-ranges.
• optical power of transparency, speciﬁc humidity and other atmospheric
characteristics observed in nadir and zenith directions.
(3) Helicopter and light-aviation laboratories that supply the eco-monitoring data
in the height region 80–500 m about the:
• regional ecological characteristics (taking into account the needs for the
ground-based stations and ﬂying observational platforms).
• surface air pollution by gases and solid aerosols.
• background level and anomalies of the environmental radio-activity and
heat ﬁelds (in the IR and SHF ranges).
• manmade air pollution in residential areas.
(4) Observational laboratories based on automobiles and ships as well as in-situ
stations. The main target of these laboratories and stations is the detection of
the anomalies in the local environment.
(5) This level is supported by GIS, IMTEM and GIMS technologies:
• collection, annotation and accumulation of data supplied by the four levels
of eco-monitoring, bringing them to unique spatial-temporal co-ordinates.
• express analysis and processing of the experimental and calculated esti-
mations for the state of the environmental elements with allocation of their
features and their connection to the speciﬁc points on the area and map.
• identiﬁcation of pollutant sources and other disturbances in the environ-
ment, assessment of dynamics and forecasting of the consequences from
pollutant impacts on ecological and sanitary conditions, detection of the
ways for the pollutants migration and determination of concentration of
unhealthy contaminants on regional territory.
• preparation of the consumer’s information in the standardized formats that
provide the reconstruction of objective image for ecological and sanitary
situation, as well as substantiation of ways for rational solution of present
and perspective nature-conservative problems.
The hierarchical structure of environmental monitoring systems optimizes the
use of ﬁnancial resources with high quality of ﬁnal results. This is the basic
argument for the creation of geoinformation monitoring systems using the tech-
nology of hierarchical synthesis. In particular, GIS is the most developed tech-
nology of environmental monitoring. GIS technology is used in many countries
with very high economic efﬁciency and lies at the interfaces between databases and
remote sensing. The main components of GIS are the computer-assisted network,
database, network communication and system representation of real situation on the
display. Numerous examples of the GIS synthesis show that GIS technology pro-
vides a convenient tool for the population to control the monitoring regime and it is
an efﬁcient mechanism for the integration of multiple-factor information about the
object under investigation. However, GIS has serious limitations when monitoring
4

Information-Modeling Technology for the Environmental Monitoring

complex problems must be solved to form the dynamical image of environmental
sub-system under the conditions of incomplete information. Basic ﬂaw of the GIS
technology is that it is not oriented to the multifaceted forecast of the state of the
monitoring object. In this regard, Krapivin and Varotsos (2007, 2008) proposed the
GIS modiﬁcation by means of a combined use of GIS and modeling technologies.
The result of this attempt is the development of a new GIMS technology based on
the formula GIMS = GIS ∪IMTEM. This GIMS technology eliminates many of the
above-said GIS ﬂaws and allows the establishment of monitoring systems that
display prognosis functions. The GIMS architecture is shown in Fig. 1.1.
In principle, the required information may be obtained by using in-situ and
remote sensing measurements and by getting access to a-prior knowledge-based
data in the GIS databases. However, the following problems must be solved:
• what kind of instruments should be used to conduct the so-called ground-truth
and remote sensing measurements?
• what is the cost to be paid for the in-situ and remote sensing information?
• what kind of balance should be taken into account for the information content of
the in-situ and remote sensing observations along with their corresponding cost?
and

• what kind of mathematical models must be used for both the interpolation and
the extrapolation of data, in terms of time and space in order to reduce the
frequency and thus the cost of the observations and to increase the reliability of
forecasting the environmental behavior of the observed items?
These and other problems are often solved by using a monitoring system, which
is based on the combination of the functions of environmental data acquisition,
control and analysis, as well as forecasting the characteristics of the most important
processes in the environment. In other words, this uniﬁcation forms the new
information technology called the GIMS-technology. The relationship between
GIMS and GIS technologies was deﬁned above by the formula GIMS = GIS ∪
IMTEM that increases the spectrum of the solved environmental problems
(Krapivin and Shutko 2012; Shutko and Krapivin 2011).
The GIMS technology was successfully tested and applied in many countries in
the World. It has been proven that the advantages of GIMS application consist, ﬁrst
of all, in the following capabilities (Shutko et al. 2010):
• to plan in situ and remote parts of experiment, optimizing the customer
requirements for a quality of data and its cost;
• to simulate the data in the form of maps having in fact the data measured along
the ﬂight line by collecting the in situ measurements and the remote observa-
tions without using scanning technologies which are extremely cost-effective;
• to forecast/predict the behavior of the examined environmental/geophysical
systems; and
• to expand the scale of the examined areas from regional to global by combining
optimally the volume/amount and the essence of the in situ and remote obser-
vations and by using this operational data set in modeling process according to
the required algorithmic and programming tasks.
Three of the demonstrative examples of the GIMS technology application are the
creation of the GIMS for Bulgaria, Aral Sea, Okhotsk Sea and Sea of Azov
(Kondratyev et al. 2002; Krapivin and Shutko 1989; Krapivin et al. 2007c, 2009d;
Shutko and Krapivin 2010). This experience has shown that GIMS technology must
be developed by the standardization and universalization of its functions, which is
described in the next section.
1.2 Information-Modeling Technology as a Key Instrument
for the Solution of Environmental Problems
1.2.1 Standardization and Universalization of the Functions
of the Global Information-Modeling System
The GIMS includes a set of items whose functions are determined by a number of
standard tasks. These items form the informational architecture of the monitoring

system, which includes the basis of models that describe the environmental sub-
systems that enable environmental diagnosis. A GIMS—oriented system shell is
formed to formalize the input information. An additional database level is syn-
thesized to have multiple assignments of semantic structures with real environ-
mental subsystems with variable dimensions. Such GIMS completion is formed
through IMTEM that offers additional functions, like:
• maximum utilization of the monitoring data about the environmental objects in
presence of unremovable information;
• conducting experiments from ground locations, mobile platforms and aircraft/
satellite combining the advantages of microwave radiometers, optical sensors
and other means;
• incorporation into the remotely sensed data ﬂow of the GPS-positioned in situ
measurements and prior knowledge-based information; and
• adaptation of the GIMS structure and functions to the environmental sub-system
under the study.
Let us designate semantic structures by the matrix symbol Ai ¼
ai1;...;is

, where
element ai1,…,is matches the object, process, phenomenon, event or other envi-
ronmental bifurcation. Actually, matrix Ai is the parametrical image of the real
environmental subsystem with its speciﬁc features. Parameter s reﬂects the
dimension of the informational type for the subsystem section. The structures {Ai}
identify both the spatial distributionof the subsystem components and their types
and parameters. The basic structures of {Ai} have four dimensions: i1 by latitude, i2
by longitude, i3 by height, and i4 by time. Other structures of {Ai} determine model
coefﬁcients, types of soil-plant formations (SPFs), precipitation, temperature,
radiation, etc.
The semantic structures {Ai}, called identiﬁers, are used by the basic models for
the formation of initial ﬁelds, validation of model output, and for preparation of the
ﬁnal or intermediate reports. Land cover classiﬁcation is the main function of the
GIMS. The identiﬁer of basic land cover classes provides a correspondence
between different types of SPFs and their parameters and spatial structure. An
example of such an identiﬁer is given in Fig. 1.2. Each of the identiﬁer elements can
have a vector structure connected with the description of various classiﬁcations of
land cover and allowing the formation of global land cover classiﬁcation maps by
means of interpolation and extrapolation through the analysis of satellite data.
The GIMS database together with the structures of the {Ai} consists of infor-
mation about the model coefﬁcients and a set of scenario fragments. The structures
{Ai} link up the knowledge base with the database. Each symbol of Ai is decoded in
conformity with the depth hierarchy and reﬂects just how reliable the description of
the environmental subsystem is, both qualitatively and quantitatively.
Identiﬁcation procedure allows formal description of the environmental sub-
system image with ﬁxation of geographical coordinates. According to scheme of
Fig. 1.2, series of identiﬁers are placed to the GIMS database. These identiﬁers
1.2

form studied subsystem image and allows classiﬁcation of spatial pixels both
contoured by subsystem territory and no owned. In particular, such identiﬁer can
represented in the form of matrix Ak ¼

 where

ij lies beyond the bounds of studied territory N;

As a result, the topological procedure in the studied environmental subsystem
located in territory Ξ of the existing database can be performed automatically taking
into account its spatial pixel hierarchy. This procedure is schematically shown in
Fig. 1.3.

1.2.2 Simulation Experiment Based on the Global
Information-Modeling System
Application of the GIMS technology for the solution of speciﬁc environmental
tasks demands development of required models and use of proper algorithms for the
evaluation of parameters for these models. Realization of simulation experiment by
means of the GIMS starts from isolation of area Ξ, where the studied environmental

GIMS database

subsystem is functioning. It is realized by means of the procedure that is depicted in
Fig. 1.3. The area Ξ is covered by geographical network {φi, λj} with the dis-
cretization steps Δφi and Δλ by latitude and longitude, respectively. All processes
and elements located on pixel Ξij = {(φ, λ): φi ≤φ ≤φi + Δφi; λj ≤λ ≤λj + Δλj} is
homogeneous and is modeled by point models. In the case of water surface, the
water body of pixel Ξij is divided by layers with thickness Δzk, namely 3D pixels
Ξijk = {(φ, λ, z): (φ, λ)∈Ξij, zk ≤z ≤zk + Δzk} are deﬁned. The atmosphere above the
pixel Ξij is divided by altitude in levels with thickness Δhs.
The interactions in the studied environmental subsystem are considered as
interactions between its elements that are located within the pixels that are base
network for the numerical schemes of the simulation experiment.
The pixels Ξij and Ξijk are not uniform considering their parameters and their
functional characteristics. In other words, the model binding to database is realized
through an heterogeneity. Moreover, to avoid the redundancy in the model structure
it is a priori supposed that all elements and processes of territory Ξ have speciﬁc
spatial discretization. The variability of the spatial discretizations within different
items of the model is neutralized in algorithmic level by coordinating the data ﬂows
from the monitoring system. As a result, the model structure is irrespective from the
database structure and therefore it does not change when database structure is
changed. Similar independence is realized between the model items. It is achieved
by means of basic information pathway that controls the data exchange between
items through inputs and outputs only. In the case of disconnection of some items,
their outputs are replaced by the available database outputs. It is schematically
shown in the Fig. 1.4.
The user forms a spatial image of the environmental subsystem and a man-
agement regime of the simulation experiment that is supported by the existing
database and the already structured knowledge base. As a result, the formalized
structure of the algorithmic and modelled procedures is generated, in such a manner
as to be oriented to the climatic zone and the socio-economic conditions of its
operation. This structure has features of intellectual information system that help to
realize the simulation experiments without additional processing of algorithms and
models. The user may choose algorithms and models and their modiﬁcations from
the existing knowledge base of GIMS reaching the required level of adequacy in the
description of the studied environmental subsystem.
The basic principles of the GIMS technology are:
(1) Integration, uniﬁcation and coordination of the existing environmental
monitoring systems based on the unique organizational and science-methodic
base.
(2) Optimization of equipment and economic resources for synthesis of the
environmental monitoring systems, their functioning and modiﬁcations.
(3) Coordination and compatibility of information ﬂuxes in the monitoring system
by using the unique coordinate-time system, common system for classiﬁca-
tion, coding, formats and data structure.
10

Information-Modeling Technology for the Environmental Monitoring

(4) Focus of the admittance to information through international informational
networks with maximum extension of user service.
(5) Independence of the environmental monitoring by the disparity of state bor-
ders and ecosystem boundaries.
Realization of these principles provides simulation modeling experiments of
different spatial scales, i.e., from local to global. In this case, the functioning of
GIMS is presented in Fig. 1.5. This scheme depicts the support of the simulation
experiment in its adaptive regime, when it is regularly performing the model
modernization and the monitoring system structure management. Thus, the GIMS
technology optimizes the information ﬂuxes to achieve effective result from all
possible sensors. The latter is schematically explained in Fig. 1.6.
Thus, the GIMS technology considers any environmental subsystem as an ele-
ment of nature interacting through biospheric, climatic, and socio-economic pro-
cesses. A model is then created describing these interactions and the functioning of
various levels of the space-time hierarchy of the whole combination of processes in
the subsystem. The model encompasses characteristic features for typical elements
of the natural and anthropogenic processes and its development is based on the
existing information base. The model structure is directed towards the adaptive
regime of its use (Fig. 1.7).

Information-Modeling Technology for the Environmental Monitoring

The combination of the environmental information acquisition system, the
model of the typical geoecosystem functioning, the computer cartography system
and the tools of artiﬁcial intelligence will result in the building of the geoinfor-
mation monitoring system of the typical element, capable of implementing the
following tasks:
• evaluation of the global change effects on the environment of the typical element
of the nature/society system;
• evaluation of the role of environmental change occurring in the typical element
due to climatic and biospheric changes on the Earth and its territories;
• evaluation of the environmental state of the atmosphere, hydrosphere and soil-
plant;
• formation and renewal of information structures based on ecological, climatic,
demographic and economic parameters;
• operative cartography of the situation of the landscape;
• forecast of the ecological consequences from the implementation of anthropo-
genic scenarios;
• designation of land covers, natural phenomena, populated landscapes, surface
contaminations of landscapes, hydrological systems and forests;
• safety evaluation of population.
The construction of the GIMS is associated with the biosphere, climate and
social medium which are characterized by a given level of spatial hierarchy.

1.3 Structural Aspects of Information-Modelling
Technology
1.3.1 Description of the Structure of a Common Global
Information-Modeling System
The GIMS-structure includes blocks which serve the following main operations:
• Data collection (collects current information about the system soil/canopy: soil
moisture, depth of aquifer, soil salinity, biomass of vegetation, rainfall rate,
others);
• Data preprocessing, their classiﬁcation and storage in the database;
• Modeling (simulation) of different kinds of ecological, hydrological, agricul-
tural, climatologic processes in different geophysical and environmental sys-
tems. These are blocks containing a variety of models of agricultural crops
productivity, of irrigation systems functioning, geo-ecology and epidemiologi-
cal models of certain deceases transmitted by vectors, and others;
• Assessment of the current state of a particular geophysical system;
• Forecast of the system’s state in the future;
• A feedback support.
The data collection block consists of two main sub-blocks, namely:
• a sub-block for collecting prior knowledge-based information;
• a sub-block for collecting current data of the in situ measurements and the
remote observations from mobile, aircraft and satellite platforms.
The ﬁrst of these two sub-blocks plays a very important role in GIMS by
constituting a model of the observed geo-ecosystem. It includes the relationships
describing different geo-ecosystems functioning as well as the relationships
between the geo-ecosystem and the surrounding media.
The second sub-block consists of three boxes providing the following
operations:
• In situ measurements that include sampling (probes) and utilizing current
information accessible from the meteorological stations and from other acces-
sible sources.
• Remote observations from the aircraft (piloted and unmanned). There are dif-
ferent types of sensors used for remote sensing observations. Among them are
the sensors operating in optical, infrared, and microwave bands of electro-
magnetic wavelengths. The data measured by all of them can potentially be used
in GIMS. In the majority of cases we have considered in this box the data
collected by passive microwave radiometers and partly by the infrared radi-
ometers have been used. These sensors provide the measurements of the
following parameters:
14

Information-Modeling Technology for the Environmental Monitoring

(a) soil moisture,
(b) depth to a shallow aquifer,
(c) biomass of vegetation above a water surface (rice crop, wetland vegeta-
tion) or above a wet ground,
(d) the temperature assessments of a water surface, land and dense vegetation
canopy.
• Satellite observations of the Earth/Atmosphere/Ocean/Biosphere. Optical sen-
sors provide crop type and land use classiﬁcation with a ground resolution of
about 1–50 m. Infrared sensors provide measurements of the surface tempera-
ture of land, water and upper boundary of vegetative canopy with a ground
resolution of 10–100 m. Microwave radiometers provide estimates of soil
moisture, general condition of vegetation, temperature variations of ocean sur-
face and of the surface of dry land with a spatial resolution of around 20–50 km.
Algorithmic and programming maintenance of the GIMS implement the
following functions:

given level of spatial hierarchy. Table 1.1 gives general description of the items of

The item PADAS implements the task of the experimental planning by per-
forming the analysis of the structure of the environmental data acquisition system,
making use of data derived by satellites, ﬂying laboratories, and movable and
stationary ground observation facilities. The laboratories are equipped with the
necessary software and hardware tools to allow determination of the degree of the
environmental contamination, of the ecological situation, mapping of the charac-
teristic geological formations, detection of soil subsurface centers of ecological
defects, performing the all-weather land-cover classiﬁcation and detection of per-
mafrost disturbances, oil spills, forest states and pollution of bodies of water.
The item IDPDA accomplishes methods and algorithms for synchronous anal-
ysis of aero-space information and ground measurements using space-time inter-
polation procedures. Retrieval of the data and their reduction to the conventional
time scale is performed. Model parameters are determined. Thematic classiﬁcation
of the data is carried out, in order to perform space-time combination of images in
the optical, IR and microwave ranges and of trace measurements obtained from
devices of various types.
The algorithms that are developed in the item CM are suitable for the drawing of
computer maps with characteristic marks for evaluating the ecological situation.
Multilevel scaling and fragmentation of the territory is envisaged. The output maps
with the information required by the user is provided through the user interface.
Models of atmospheric pollution developed due to evaporation and burning of
oil products, natural gas and other outputs of industrial enterprises are employed
within the item ESA. In particular, the problem of the evaluation of the atmosphere
dust content is solved. The gas and aerosol composition of the near-earth atmo-
spheric layer are provided and forecasting maps of their distribution over the earth’s
surface are drawn.
Item ESSPC focuses on the following tasks:
• classiﬁcation of the ﬂoristic background taking into account the microrelief, soil
type and its salinity, humidiﬁcation and the degree of the soil brine
mineralization;

• determination of the structural topology of the land cover;
• emergence of forests, swamps, agricultural crops and pastures.
In the item ESWMA the complex simulation model of the territory is formulated
taking into account the seasonal changes of surface and river runoff, the inﬂuence of
snow cover and permafrost and the regime of precipitation and evapotranspiration.
A model is developed by employing the water quality dynamics for the hydrologic
network of the territory.
The item REES accomplishes the algorithms for the evaluation of the damage to
nature, economic stability and population health, depending on the environmental
changes that are connected with the natural trends of meteorological, biogeo-
chemical, biogeocenotic, micro-biologic, radiologic and other natural processes as
well as the enhancement of the manmade environmental stress.
The task of revealing the sources of environmental pollution is implemented in
the item ICESD. This subsystem determines the source coordinates, the magnitude
and the possible time of the non-planned incoming of polluting substances. The
dynamic characteristics of the pollution sources are herein given. Additionally, the a
priori unknown pollution sources are revealed and the directions of possible
trans-boundary transport of pollutants are determined.
The software-mathematical algorithms are formulating in the item IS in order to
provide the user with intelligent support in performing the complex analysis of
objective information formed in the framework of the simulation experiment. The
necessary information for the objective dialogue with the global model of the nature/
society system model is provided in a convenient form for the user. The input of the
data processing corrections is also provided. The knowledge base of the anthro-
pogenic, demographic and socio-economic processes on the territory is formed.
1.3.2 The Subsystems of the Global Information-Modeling
System
The items PADAS and IDPDA ensure the fulﬁllment of such GIMS technology
functions as systematic collection, generalization, storage, utilization and distribu-
tion of information about the environmental parameters in the form that is adapted
to the users. The technical realization of these functions is implemented by using
ﬁber-optical sensors and measuring systems (Burkov and Krapivin 2009). The use
of the optical ﬁber technology for data transmission within the environmental
monitoring systems improves their reliability and the survivability of the infor-
mation-measuring systems. These effects are achieved as a result of the optical ﬁber
measuring systems that have not interference effects and their functioning does no
depend on the electromagnetic radiation and other physical ﬁelds. Under this,
synchronization of the ground ﬁber optical sensors with the satellite microwave
radiometers is achieved without noises deduced from the electromagnetic ﬁelds,
high temperatures and aggressive mediums (Burkov et al. 2008).

As mentioned above the item IDPDA analyses the environmental information
and in that way helps to assess real state of the nature/society subsystems within
concrete space-temporal boundaries. Here it is necessary to note that measurements
conducted by satellites or ﬂying laboratories deliver small volumes of statistically
reliable samples. Moreover, these data are usually non-stationary. The formation of
the input information in the GIMS based on monitoring data that received epi-
sodically in time and fragmentarily in space is a problem, which can be solved by
using speciﬁc algorithms that are included in the item IDPDA. These algorithms are
described in Chap. 2. Choice of one of them is realized automatically by item
IDPDA depending on the type of treated task. Large-scale tasks of cartographic
representation of monitoring data are carried out using spline or differential inter-
polation. In the case, when un-removable information uncertainty exists, then the
evolutionary modeling method is employed.
The method of differential approximation has universal character and as unique
method of the theory of approximation functions is often used for the analysis of
dynamic information. In the case when the task of data reconstruction within the
inter-trass space is performed, the method of differential approximation reduces this
task to that of the measurement data reduction to unique time. Moreover, coupled
use of the differential approximation and spline-approximation methods raises the
precision of task solution when there exist cross-trasses of satellites and ﬂying
laboratories.
The study of the natural objects and processes using remote sensing methods has
promoted the evolutionary technology paradigm as a knowledge technology
directed towards the restored adaptation (Bukatova et al. 1991). This paradigm lies
in the GIMS technology base. Succession for this paradigm needs the improvement
of “super-intellect” taking into consideration of un-removable information uncer-
tainty that is practically always present in the global ecoinformatics. The evolu-
tionary modeling is such a super-intellect. It is a method of adaptive structural
identiﬁcation of objects, based on the synthesis of structured models using the
simulation mechanisms of natural evolution and their self-organization.
The evolutionary intellectual technology creates the model for nature-society
subsystem that appears an unexpected temporal change. This model guarantees the
elimination of information uncertainty at any time of monitoring. Figure 1.8
illustrates the main scheme for this technology. In the usual case, there are two
processes that are permanently alternated—the process of structural adaptation and
the process of usage. The arbitrary stage of adaptation is characterized by synthesis
of models that are used for forecasting, interpolation and other operations with
fragmentary data. The most efﬁcient model is the choice from stage to stage of
adaptation. The procedure of evolutionary selection between models provides the
GIMS functioning that is practically unlimited in time when an un-removable
informational uncertainty is present.
The item CM performs informational ﬁlling of the ﬁnal maps according to user’s
requirements and prepares operative informational bulletins following the changing
situations at all spatial scales. Cartographic identiﬁcation of the environmental
objects is realized in accordance to the schemes depicted in Figs. 1.2 and 1.3.

Information-Modeling Technology for the Environmental Monitoring

The GIMS using mainly the item ESA develops models that describe processes
of the air-pollution spread due to different anthropogenic activity. The change in the
concentration of every atmospheric pollutant C is described by the following
equation:
@C t; u; k; h
ð
Þ=@t þ r  V!C ¼ rD  rC þ R
ð1:1Þ
where V! Vu; Vk; Vh


is the wind velocity, φ and λ are latitude and longitude,
respectively; h is the altitude, t is the time, D is the molecular diffusion coefﬁcient,
R is the changes due to atmospheric turbulence, emission and mixing.
The item ESA refers to model of Gauss-type as an essential procedure for the
dispersion of the atmospheric pollutants. This model requires a preliminary input
information about the height of pollution source and dispersion characteristics
within the pollutant cloud. The different approximations of the Gauss stream in the
neighborhood of the pollutant sources depend on the stability parameters of the
atmospheric surface layer. The model conﬁguration depends on geographical
coordinates. For example, clusters with stable and unstable air-pollutant ﬂuxes are
considered primarily within the boundaries between the areas land and water. With
this approach, three speciﬁc zones can be selected: the zone with undisturbed
dispersion, the precipitation zone and the delay zone. Each zone has speciﬁc
equations for the parameterization of the air-pollution dispersion.
In the zone with undisturbed dispersion, the pattern of distribution of the air-
pollutants ﬂuxes is inﬂuenced by an homogeneous and stable layer, i.e.,:

where φ is the wind direction, λ is the abscissa, h is the ordinate, σφ and σp are the

In the second zone the air-pollution cloud forms under instability conditions and
therefore the calculation of the air-pollutant concentrations requires a broadened

The Gauss-type model describes well the ﬁelds of air-pollutants over territories
at scales up to 100 km. For large territories, other types of models are used. For
example, Eulerian and Lagrangian models are used when Gaussian model appears
high errors. The item ESA employs these models depending on the territory area
and taking into account the availability of monitoring data.

provides interim information on other items that parameterize the functions of the
soil-vegetation systems and detects disturbances in ecological and sanitary condi-
tions. The initial information about the item ESWM consists of data on soil-plant

formations, reliefs, the spatial distribution of pollution sources, the conﬁguration of
river systems, the statistics of climate trends, water resources and their use.
Risk evaluation of the ecological safety and the health of the population is
important function of the GIMS. Implementation of this task is achieved using the
item REES which allow for short-term and long-term forecasts, to deliver data on
environmental characteristics to management services, to inform different agencies
about disasters and ecologically dangerous events. This function of GIMS allows
the implementation of recommendations to normalize and strengthen ecological
situations, and the perfection of ecological safety systems. It develops the algo-
rithms that help to assess the environmental damage, economic stability shock, and
the deterioration of population health depending on the regional natural and man-
made changes of meteorological trends, biogeochemical, microbiological and
radiological processes. Indicators of biocomplexity, biodiversity, survivability, and
bioavailability are assessed along with it.

Information-Modeling Technology for the Environmental Monitoring

An important structural feature of the GIMS is that it is constituted by the global
simulation model for nature/society system that controls information ﬂuxes between
global databases and the GIMS database protected from the exaggeration and
uncertainty at the same time. Α truly global model plays the role of context
information for the GIMS workspace. Hierarchical structure of this workspace is
determined by series of directories and ﬁles stored in the conﬁguration that is
identical to structure shown in Figs. 1.3 and 1.4. Subsystem of intelligent support
helps user to overcome isolated virtually unsolved questions displaying all the
questionable features of the studied problem. One of such unsolved question is the
choice of an adequate model. Choice of the model type done at the ﬁrst stage of the
GIMS synthesis is often a poorly formalized procedure. In this case, it is required to
run the following stages:
• primary informal description of the monitoring object;
• formulation of the objectives for investigation;
• substantial analysis of the a priori information about the environmental
subsystem;
• development of the mathematical (formalized) model for the subsystem
functioning;
• set-up of the modelling algorithm;
• synthesis of software package for the model run in a computer;
• model veriﬁcation and evaluation of its parameters;
• choice of the alternative versions of the model to adapt to the structure of the
GIMS database;
• elaboration of scenarios on simulation experiments that reﬂect the objectives of
the research model; and
• utilization of the model in an operational monitoring system.
Synthesis of the model as part of the GIMS item requires setting boundaries of
the object monitoring. This stage includes this model and models of more high
levels that parameterize the environment beyond those boundaries. The number of
the model levels depends on the spatial resolution of the monitoring system. The
model must be equipped with the following functions:
1. The measuring function that uses similarity of the model and the object to be
modeled.
2. The descriptive function that characterizes the object features in its various
states.
3. The interpretative function that describes the power of the model adaptability
and the applications of its results.
4. The explanatory function which represents the model ability for the interpre-
tation of the monitoring data in accordance with the terms of formal tools of
mathematical methods used in the model.
5. The prognostic function which is associated with the probability to forecast the
evolution of the environmental subsystem with given precision and for condi-
tions under which it is not observed.
1.3

6. The criterion function of the model, which allows the veriﬁcation of the cor-
rectness of the environmental knowledge and suggests the ability to model the
experiment for the purpose of receiving new information.
1.3.3 The Global Information-Modeling System-Based
on Monitoring Systems
Structural ﬁlling of the real information-modeling system depends on several cir-
cumstances. The owner of the system may have requirements that are not performed
as part of the basic version of GIMS. In this case the additional items are syn-
thesized and basic version of the GIMS is built by connecting the new items to the
central information line. Some experience of such procedures is presented in
Table 1.4 that features a series of regional information-modeling systems (RIMS)
synthesized during the last time.
The composition of real GIMS starts with analysing all the data on the moni-
toring subsystem. Usually these data are used to develop the methodology of
sharing the remotely sensed data, the in situ measurements and information per-
manently collected from the existing meteorological stations which provided non-
stop measurements of precipitation, soil moisture, soil and atmospheric temperature
at different levels, and other data. In the case of RIMS-B, the availability of all this
instrumentation and corresponding data allows the development of a management
technology for non-stop monitoring of soil moisture and moisture related param-
eters, such as dryness index, risk of water shortage in local areas, drought, and
others.
As seen from Table 1.14 the GIMS technology has been successfully tested and
applied in many regions. It has shown that the advantages of applying GIMS
provide ﬁrstly the following capabilities:
• to design the in-situ and remote parts of the experiment optimizing customer
requirements for data quality and cost;
• to simulate the actual measurements along the ﬂight line in the form of maps,
with the collection of the in-situ measurements and remote observations not
using scanning technologies, which is extremely cost-effective;
• to forecast/predict the behavior of the examined environmental/geophysical
subsystems; and
• to expand the scale of the examined areas from regional to global by combining
optimally the volume/amount and the essence of the in situ and remote obser-
vations and by using these operational data in the modeling process according to
the required algorithmic and computer programming tasks.
Each implementation of GIMS technology has theoretical and experimental
section which has both its general concept and also the development of its speciﬁc
spacecraft, aircraft and ground-based platforms. Therefore, the actual composition

Table 1.5 shows the stages for the RIMS-B synthesis. The implementation of
these stages allowed the demonstrational ﬂights of the aircraft laboratory Miramap

A comparison of in-situ, remote sensing and modeling results leads to the following
conclusions:
• for the practical use of the GIMS technology in the Bulgarian conditions it is
necessary to create the archive of characteristics for soil-plant formations that
reﬂect the spatial distributions of soil types and their features, as well as the
biometrical and production characteristics of vegetation cover; and
• it is necessary to implement studies and to establish timely warnings about the
quasi-stationary character of the climate and geophysical parameters both in
separate regions and on a national basis.

Information-Modeling Technology for the Environmental Monitoring

McCulloch 2003; Pollak 1990). These methods were the foundation for a new
science called “evoinformatics” (Krapivin and Potapov 2002; Nitu et al. 2004). This
science lies at the boundary of disciplines such as neurocybernetics, cognitive
psychology, artiﬁcial intelligence, theory of systems, theory of survivability, and
systemology.
Recent advances in informatics and information technology have enabled
mathematical modeling and computer technology applications to enter such
domains as ecology, biophysics, and medicine. The concept of experimental model
has lost its novelty since long ago and has been replaced by the term of “computing
experiment”, which is used in many studies covering a vast range of subjects
including the biospheric experiments (Kondratyev et al. 2003b, 2004b). All such
works imply a priori availability of a more or less adequate model implemented as
an array of tools in an algorithmic language. To manipulate a model to carry out a
series of speciﬁc computing experiments one needs a general purpose computer. It
is at this point that the researcher may be challenged with insurmountable difﬁ-
culties caused by constraints on the computer’s memory and speed of operation.
Many of such endeavors indicate that modern hardware can handle relatively
complex models. Yet the same experience prompts the need for constant
improvement of modeling techniques, because the researcher runs into conﬂict
between his desire to enhance the accuracy of a model and limited capabilities of
the computer. Building a model that is completely representative of a real world
entity is clearly not feasible: on the one hand, taking account of all the parameters
of the entity leads to the “evil of multi-dimensionality” and, on the other hand,
simple models that can only cope with a small number of parameters are simply not
up to the task of simulating the complex entities under consideration. Besides, such
projects involve ocean physics, geophysics, global ecology, socio-economics, etc.
The building of an adequate model is in principle impossible because of unat-
tainability of information completeness. Such systems can only deal with applied
problems from the domains of global ecology, biophysics, and medicine. Fur-
thermore, difﬁculties in these subject areas arise at the early stages of research (e.g.,
when attempting to formulate a model).
What is to be done when the currently available knowledge does not allow for
synthesis of a mathematical model of an entity or a process? The answer on this
question gives a theory of learning computers of the evolutionary type. We shall
retain the term “model” although it is used here in a somewhat different sense. What
it implies here is the description of entities changing over time in an unpredictable
manner and, by virtue of this, ensuring the irremovability of information uncer-
tainty at any moment. Such are natural systems studied e.g. in global ecology,
geophysics, biophysics and medicine. Consequently, a model treated in a broad
sense must provide for continuous adaptation to the changing behavior and struc-
ture of the observed entity. It is clear that universal models can be built only
through synthesis of particular models. Models of this kind are implemented for
problems of recognition and prediction.
Thus, let a real-world object A has some unknown algorithm of operation, only
some previous history of operation of ﬁnite length been known. We need to
1.4
The Evolutionary Modeling as an Item of …
33

efﬁciently simulate the functioning of A by using models built for some system
operating in the real time. It is necessary to build a sequence of improving models
{Ak}, where k = 1, 2, …. Cybernetics began to ponder how this could be attained
virtually from the moment the ﬁrst, primitive by today’s standard, machines
emerged. It was then that the idea of creating artiﬁcial intelligence and designing
“thinking machines” appeared, giving rise to the development of robotics. Being
aware that a computer is an obedient executor of some program, cybernetics
doggedly worked on the possibility of imparting to the machine a measure of
unpredictable behavior with some facets of “innovation”. Treating intelligence as
the ability to correctly respond to a novel situation, scientists came to the conclusion
that machines capable of adapting to the level of individual components and their
structural organization are in fact feasible.
The idea of model-free learning for computer is discussed during last years. The
basic problem is how to teach a computer by changing the structure of relations
between its elements. This analogy with the neural operation of the brain estab-
lished in neurophysiology yielded fruit and helped advance far along the scale of
artiﬁcial intelligence capabilities. Fogel et al. (1966) gave an impetus to an entirely
new cybernetic trend.
Evolutionary modeling on the whole can be represented by a hierarchical two-tier
procedure (Fig. 1.15). At the ﬁrst tier there are two constantly alternating processes
conventionally termed the structural adaptation and utilization processes. At the kth
stage of adaptation at the time of operation of the structural adaptation algorithm,
models of the sequence {As,i}, i = 1, …, Ms are synthesized. Special rules form
memory from the most effective models \A1
s; . . .; Ak
s [ . At the stage of utilization
following the stage of adaptation, the system selects the most efﬁcient model.
A schematic diagram of the ith step of kth stage of adaptation of models is represented
in Fig. 1.16. The “object” block here denotes that the real-world object is deﬁned by
some previous history.
The procedure of the evolutionary selection of models provides for a virtually
time-unlimited operation of the system under irremovable information uncertainty.
Apart from the previous history which, as a rule, does not meet the requirements of
traditional statistical analysis, the researcher has no other available information.
Under such conditions one obviously has to use the maximum of available infor-
mation, in particular, that on the operation of the adaptation and utilization stages.
Fig. 1.15 Schematic representation of the concept of evolutionary modeling (Bukatova et al.
1991)

Information-Modeling Technology for the Environmental Monitoring

In the parametric adaptation algorithm, this information is used as early as the
adaptation of the ﬁrst-tier parameters, i.e. the characteristic number for each mode
of changes; multiplicity of the change mode utilization; length of the change mode
list; the distribution of change modes in the list; the distribution of k-models of Ai
k,
memory volume at the stage of adaptation, the prehistory length, etc.
The endeavors to search for a building block base to synthesize network with a
variable structure in an attempt to create special ﬂexible hardware based on the new
principles of information processing have offered up some results. Recent advances
in microelectronics have helped solve the problem of selecting components for
structures with variable ﬁelds of relations (Bukatova 1992).
The uniﬁcation and specialization are characteristic features of the evolutionary
software as a consequence of the minimum of a priori information, effective mech-
anisms of adaptation and the modular principle of realization. With the orientation to
up-to-date personal computer engineering and diverse range of application problems,
these speciﬁc features have made it possible to work out evolutionary computation
technologies, in which for an active dialogue with a user, a set of software modules is
realized, as well as the adjustment of the evolutionary facility to the speciﬁcity of the
problem being solved (Bukatova et al. 1991). Regardless of the ﬁeld of application,
evolutionary technology with software support is characterized by adaptability,
ﬂexibility, dynamism, self-correction. At the same time, the main distinction consists
in the high effectiveness and adjustability under the conditions of the maximum
informative uncertainty, including that of an irremovable character. This approach
permits to realize the adaptive procedure in Fig. 1.5. Evolutionary modeling tech-
nology really does give a new structure of the AIMS (Fig. 1.17).
Evolutionary modeling is effective at bringing about an adaptation process within
the AIMS technology to correct the functional and parametric structure of the basic
model. Search of correlations for the description local function in framework of
common adaptation procedure other methods can use. For example, Fang and Liang
(2003) studied two LAI retrieval schemes with the neural network algorithm:

• extraction of LAI from atmospherically corrected surface reﬂectance;
• extraction of LAI from top-of-atmosphere (TOA) raw radiances detected by the
Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor.
LAI is estimated through the inversion of an RT model basing on the Landsat
ETM+ reﬂectance and radiance data. The ﬁrst step in this procedure is the creating
of an appropriate Lookup Table (LUT) method. Then, the Markov Chain Reﬂec-
tance Model (MCRM) is used.
1.4.2 Tools of Evolutionary Modeling Technology
Realization of type model screening in framework of evolution procedure needs to
deﬁne model class that will be used. There are two possible alternatives for model
type choice:
Fig. 1.17 Structure of the geoinformation monitoring system and its evolutionary devices
36

Information-Modeling Technology for the Environmental Monitoring

• analytical or simulation/computational type that has not a relation to the subject
area for study; or
• mathematical equations describing the subject area.
In the ﬁrs case a model type can be one of the following:
• self-organizing model (Ivachnenko et al. 1984);
• model of neural computation (Jordan and Sejnowski 2001; Obermayer and
Sejnowski 2001);
• genetic model (Neale and Cardon 1992); and
• graphical model (Koller and Friedman 2009).
In the second case mathematical equations are formed depending on the subject
area that is considered. Selection of model type in many respects is no simple task.
Expert experience plays important role.
One of simple methods is method of self-organizing models that used effectively
for the problem solution of the spatial-temporal recovery of the data of monitoring.
The idea of this approach is based on traditional functions approximation theory.
Let an object or process be described by the model Ψ = f(a1, …, n) where
parameters {ai} reﬂect the quantitative, functional, and structural sections of the
phenomenon under study. A multitude of possible types of the function f is deter-
mined on basis of an expert estimation with consideration of a priori information and
heuristic set of partial descriptions of the phenomenon. The training sequence {fi} is
constructed which serves the basis for multi-row selection to choose the model of an
optimal complexity and acceptable accuracy. The ﬁrst level of selection consists in
calculation of the row {ys}, where yi ¼ g ai1; ai
ð
Þ
s ¼ 1; . . .; L ¼ C2
n; i ¼ 1; . . .; n


.
The second level of selection gives the row {zp}, where zp ¼ g yj1; yj


ðp ¼ 1; . . .; C2
L; j ¼ 1; . . .; LÞ. The process of selection is continued till the most
regular mathematical description of the phenomenon under study is obtained. Esti-
mation of the accuracy of the obtained model and the choice of the moment of the end
of the process of selection depend on the chosen criterion of discrepancy between
theoretic and empirical image of phenomenon. The root mean square deviation cri-
terion is most often used, and polynomial serves as the function f. The procedure of the
models selection consists in a gradual complication of the polynomial approximation.
Method of the group consideration of arguments has been described in detail in
the work of Ivachnenko et al. (1984), where its various modiﬁcations are given with
examples of the efﬁcient use in solving the applied problems.
Models of neural computation are usually applied for neuro-biological compu-
tation. For example, the Hodgkin–Huxley model, widely regarded as one of the
great achievements of 20th-century biophysics, describes how action potentials in
neurons are initiated and propagated in axons via voltage-gated ion channels. It is a
set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations that that approximates the electrical
characteristics of excitable cells such as neurons and cardiac myocytes. These
equations were introduced by Hodgkin and Huxley (1952) to explain the results
of voltage clamp experiments on the squid giant axon. Analytic solutions do not
exist, but the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (Marquardt 1963), a modiﬁed
1.4
The Evolutionary Modeling as an Item of …
37

Gauss–Newton algorithm, is often used to ﬁt these equations to voltage-clamp data.
This algorithm, known as the damped least squares method, provides a numerical
solution to the problem of minimizing a function, generally nonlinear, over a space
of parameters of the function.
Subsequent development of these approaches to the solution of tasks related to
biological evolution simulation is based on parameterization of basic evolution
factors—hereditary mutability, competition, and selection. Progress in this direction
was achieved due to the introduction of structured model (C-model) into evolu-
tionary schemes (Bukatova and Makrusev 2003, 2004a, b).
Bukatova and Matveev (2004b) developed an idea of neuron networks for tasks
when the processing images are needed. In this case there are three possibilities for
neuron network selection:
1. Neuron network as ﬁnite-automat stratiﬁed model or Petri net (René and
Hassane 2005).
2. Modiﬁcation of NeuroShell 2, Neural Analyzer, and BrainMaker Pro depending
on the concrete neuro-paradigm (Lowd 1977).
3. Integrity-evolutionary integration medium that includes tools for structural
search of effective conﬁguration of neuron net.
Each of case includes the tools for structural search of efﬁcient conﬁguration for
neuron network. Let input measurements xc(t) from ﬁnite-dimensional space X are
transformed to the solutions yc(t) from ﬁnite-dimensional space Y by means of
neuron network that realizes unknown transformer F. In this case it is needed to
synthesis F: X →Y. This operation can be realized by means of evolutionary
synthesis algorithm represented in Figs. 1.15 and 1.16. This algorithm uses neurons
and connections between them. Quantity criterion deﬁnes the compromise between
network complexity and precision results. This compromise is achieved in frame-
work of structural evolutionary synthesis that is based on stochastic search of C-
models. Variety of possible situations is considered by Bukatova and Makrusev
(2004a, b). Particularly, Krapivin et al. (2008a) considering the problem of infor-
mation-measuring system synthesize use a modern technologies and element base of
microelectronics and optoelectronics jointly with adaptive-evolutionary technology.
Gulyaev et al. (1987, 1989) developed technology of evolutionary computer that is
based on the optical electronics element base including discrete logical elements.

1.5.1 Principal Structure of Global Model
Solution of global environmental problems is possible by means of the GIMS
technology that parameterizes processes in the nature/society system (NSS) of
global scale. There exist various approaches to the synthesis of a global model to
38

describe all aspects of man’s interactions with environmental bodies and with their
physical, biological and chemical systems. One such way has its origin in the
studies of the Computer Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow
(Krapivin et al. 1982). A global model of this type is formed on basis of the detailed
description of the climate system with the consideration of a small set of biospheric
components. This strategy of global modeling is adhered to in the Potsdam Institute
for Climate Impact Research studies (Boysen 2000) where the Moscow Global
Model prototypes are developed. More than 30 climate models are being developed
in different countries as attempts to bring forth new trends in the science of global
change (Demirchian, Kondratyev 2004; Claussen et al. 1999). Unfortunately glo-
bal- and regional-scale studies on the processes and impacts of global change using
this approach have not produced results that are enough satisfactory. That is why
another approach to the global modeling problem has been developed by many
authors (Krapivin 1993; Sellers et al. 1996; Kondratyev et al. 2002; Degermendzhi
et al. 2009). This approach is known as evolutionary modeling.
The traditional approaches to building a global model encounter some difﬁculties
of the algorithmic description with respect to many socio-economic, ecological and
climatic processes so that one has to deal with information uncertainty. These
approaches to global modeling simply ignore such uncertainty and consequently the
structure of the resultant models does not adequately reﬂect the real processes.
Evolutionary modeling makes it possible to remove this drawback by the synthesis
of a combined model whose structure is subject to adaptation against the back-
ground of the history of a system of the biosphere and climate components. The
implementation of such a model can also be combined in various classes of models
using conventional software and hardware and special-purpose processors of the
evolutionary type. The form of such combination is diverse, depending on the
spatial-temporal completeness of the databases.
The experience in global modeling abounds in examples of insolvable problems
encountered when looking for ways to describe the scientiﬁc and technological
advances and human activity in its diverse manifestations. No lesser difﬁculties
arise in modeling climate described by a superimposition of processes with different
temporal variability rates. As to completeness of description in the global model, it
is impossible to clearly delineate the bounds of information availability and the
extent of the required spatial and structural detail. Therefore, without going into
natural-philosophical analysis of global problems, and skirting the issue of the
ultimate solution to global modeling, we will conﬁne ourselves to the discussion of
only one of the possible approaches. This approach will demonstrate in which way
evolutionary modeling implemented on special processors can help overcome
computing, algorithmic and other difﬁculties of global modeling. All of this does
imply that a search for effective models of the traditional type can apt be considered
perspective. At present, the building of global biogeocenotic models is not seen as
difﬁcult. Many such models have been created, and the gathering of information to
support them is under way. The history of the interaction of the biosphere with the
climate system and human society is not known sufﬁciently, which is one of the
hurdles, e.g. in the description of climatic cycles. To build a global model
1.5
A Global Model as Unit of the Information-Modeling Technology
39

accounting for the interaction of the biosphere, climate system, magnetosphere, etc.
it is necessary to apply the evolutionary approach which helps to overcome the
uncertainties in the description of this interaction. As a result of the adjustment of
such a model to the history of the prescribed cycle, we will obtain a model
implicitly tracing various regularities of the dynamics of the biosphere in the past
and allowing for forecast assessments to be made in the same temporal cycle.
A special-processor version of this model completely removes all the existing
algorithmic and computing hurdles arising from the large dimensionality of the
global model and the conditions of irreducible nonparametrical uncertainty.
Figure 1.18 shows the conceptual diagram of this new type of global model. The
data archive is formed here as two structures. Data of the ﬁrst type for the computer
models of the biosphere processes are stored as climatic maps and as tables of the
model equation coefﬁcients. It is necessary to ﬁll in all cells of the schematic maps.
Data of the second type are represented as fragments recorded disparately (possibly
irregularly) in time and space, i.e. CO2 concentration, temperature, precipitation,
pressure, population numbers, availability of resources, etc. Data of this type are
used to adjust the evolutionary processor to the given class of models, e.g. ﬁnite
automata. As a result of this procedure the model is adapted to the history of the
prescribed time cycle. As has been shown by Bukatova et al. (1991) a stable
Fig. 1.18 Structure of global model using the evolutionary blocks
40

Information-Modeling Technology for the Environmental Monitoring

forecast is produced with 75–95 % reliability covering several temporal steps. The
extent of a forecast is determined by the depth of the history against the background
of the saturation of the effect. Given the need for a forecast under the conditions of
change in the trends of human economic activities, an evolutionary processor is
adjusted to the assigned scenario, thus automatically providing for simulation of the
corresponding response of the biosphere to this change.
The suggested structure of the global model thus ensures a ﬂexible combination
of models of the traditional and evolutionary types. The proposed approach helps
escape the need to model unstable processes (climatic, socio-economic, demo-
graphic, etc.) and provides for overcoming uncertainty. A model of this new type
makes it possible to go from learning experiments to the assessment of the viability
of the biosphere with regard to actual trends of anthropogenic stresses in all regions
of the globe.
A departure from the established global modeling techniques based on the new
information technology makes it possible to proceed to creating a global system of
monitoring with the global model as a portion of the support for the system. The
structure of such a system is represented in Fig. 1.19. Application of the evolu-
tionary computer technology provides for categorization of the whole system by a
class of subsystems with variable structure and for making it adaptable to changes
in the natural process or entity under observation. Furthermore, it becomes possible
to detail heterogeneously the natural systems under study in the space of phase
variables, and to select nonuniform geographical grids in a sampling analysis of the
planetary surface, i.e. arbitrary insertion of signiﬁcant regularities at the regional
level becomes possible.
The automatic system for processing of global information is aimed at the
acquisition of combined models reﬂected in the real-time scale of the climatic and
anthropogenic changes in the biosphere and based on the known history (or, rather,
its simulation). The system relies on the set of models of biosphere processes and,
using software of other units with the help of the scenario of anthropogenic
behavior formulated at input, provides for prompt assessment of the environmental
state and for forecast assessments within the framework of this scenario. The
automatic system for processing of global information also consists of the advan-
tage in that it formulates the entry and bound conditions for particular built-in
models in the study of regional systems and virtually substitutes for ﬁeld mea-
surements of those conditions.
The ﬁrst version of the global model (Krapivin et al. 1982) was oriented towards
rigid spatial-temporal detailing and therefore required a large quantity of infor-
mation. The subsequent development of an automatic system for processing of
global information has made it possible, owing to the evolutionary technology, to
reject the generally accepted regular geophysical grid in archive development and to
solve this problem using algorithms for the recovery of spatial-temporal
information.
Global model aims to parameterize the main processes that take place in the
biosphere/climate/society system. The existing global knowledge and databases

enables the synthesis model describing the interactions between areas and elements
of this system represented in Figs. 1.20, 1.21 and 1.22.
1.5.2 Global Biogeochemical Cycles as Units of Global Model
Interactions between the abiotic factors of the environment and living organisms of
the biosphere are accompanied by a continuous matter cycle in nature. Different
species of living organisms assimilate substances needed for their growth and life

support emitting to the environment products of metabolism and other complex
mineral and organic compounds of chemical elements in the form of non-assimi-
lated food or dead biomasses. As a result of the biosphere evolution, a stable chain
of global biogeochemical cycles has been formed whose violation in the second half
of the 20th century has made humankind face many principal problems such as an
unpredicted climate change due to the greenhouse effect, a decrease of biodiversity,
progressing desertiﬁcation, and many others. Indeed, questions about what is the
matter with the Earth’s climate and what are the consequences for the ozone layer
depletion remain unanswered despite huge economic expenditures on their study.
Now it is clear that these and other nature-protection questions cannot be
answered without developing an effective global monitoring system based on the
global model of the biosphere/climate/society system as GIMS item, one of the
basic units of which is the unit simulating the biogeochemical cycles of basic
chemical elements of the biosphere (Zhu and Anderson 2002; Kondratyev et al.
2002). It is this approach under conditions of implementation of the Kyoto Protocol
(KP) ideas that will make it possible to assess the anthropogenic ﬂuxes of pollu-
tants and to estimate permissible emissions of carbon, chlorine, sulfur, ﬂuorine,
methane, and other chemical elements to the environment as well as to regulate the
problems of the GHGs emissions market (Kalb et al. 2004; Pan 2005).

Fundamental connections between characteristics of the biological state of the
environment, such as biodiversity in ecosystems, the state and dynamics of food
chains, and interactions of the biosystem with the cycle of biogenic elements have
been poorly studied, both in land and water ecosystems. Among numerous ques-
tions appearing in studies of the global biogeochemical processes the following are
of key importance:

(3) What mechanisms control the ability of ecosystems to rapidly restore and what
are indicators that reﬂect this ability of ecosystems?
• How do an introduction of new species to ecosystems and an appearance of
new unstudied diseases affect the development of biogeochemical cycles in
land and water ecosystems?

• What basic parameters and characteristics of ecosystems affect their ability
to restore after anthropogenic forcings?
The global CO2 biogeochemical cycle is in the centre of attention of scientists.
Specialists of many countries try to answer the following questions:
(i)
What concentrations of CO2 can be expected in future with present or
predicted rates of organic fuels burning?
(ii)
What climate changes can result from increased concentrations of CO2?
(iii)
What are consequences of climate changes for the biosphere?
(iv)
What can the mankind undertake in order to either reduce negative con-
sequences of climate change or prevent them?
Clearly, according to rough model estimates, the industrial civilization should
now search for new sources of energy which would decrease the rates of organic
fuel burning and, hence, reduce the external forcings on natural biogeochemical
cycled. The atmosphere is one of the important reservoirs taking part in formation
of these cycles. On the whole, chemistry and physics of the atmospheric processes
suffer changes, without a study of which reliable assessment of the state of the
atmosphere and the dynamics and photochemical processes in it is impossible
(Brasseur 2005).
During the last decade the words “greenhouse effect” could be seen in numerous
publications on the problems of global climate change on Earth (Ichikawa 2004).
This term implies a totality of descriptions of the effects appearing in the climate
system and connected with a number of natural and anthropogenic processes. On
the whole, the notion of the greenhouse effect refers to an explanation of changes in
the atmospheric thermal regime, as a result of the impact of some gases on the
process of solar radiation absorption. Many gases are characterized by a high
stability and long residence in the atmosphere (Table 1.7). Carbon dioxide is one of
them. As for the role of CO2, more than a century ago, Arrhenius (1896) was the
ﬁrst to draw the conclusion that its emission in fuels burning can lead to a climate
warming. In subsequent decades this sagacious conclusion turned out to be a weird
foresight and sorrowful forecast. After all, in the global historical long-range per-
spective, CO2 content in the atmosphere had been changing stably with variations
of about 20 ppm, at least, during 11,000 years before the industrial epoch. In this
long-term context the anthropogenic increase of atmospheric CO2 by *100 ppm
for the last 200 years is a dramatic change in the global carbon cycle. This increase

is connected with emissions to the atmosphere of *400 PgC during this period
mainly due to deforestation and fossil fuel burning.
Numerous long-term observations in various latitudinal belts show a high level
of correlation between temperature and CO2 content. The atmosphere-ocean
interaction contributes most into this dependence. Though the atmosphere and the
ocean are in equilibrium with respect to CO2 exchange, still this equilibrium is
regularly violated. The most serious causes of this violation are:
(1) SST variations;
(2) changes in the ocean volume; and
(3) changes in the regime of the vertical circulation of the ocean.
In general, an efﬁciency of these causes can be characterized by the following
ratio of the forcing on CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. The ﬁrst cause
contributes about 65 % into the change of the CO2 partial pressure in the atmo-
sphere (pa). The remaining 35 % are contributed by the second and third causes.
Quantitatively, this relationship is characterized by a 6 % increase of the atmo-
spheric CO2 partial pressure per 1 °C increase of the temperature of the ocean’s
upper layer. Also, a 1 % decrease of the ocean volume raises pa by 3 %. On the
whole, as Perry (2001) notes, understanding the role of the atmosphere-ocean

system in global changes requires a study of its dynamics with consideration of
various kinds of information for a long historical period. Of course, it is important
here to reasonably use the respective models and data from the paleocenographic
record. This is only possible with coordination of various programs on study of the
atmosphere-ocean system.
An assessment of the greenhouse effect requires a complex consideration of the
interaction of all processes of energy transformation on Earth. However, in the
diversity of processes (from astronomical to biological) that affect the climate
system on various time scales, there exists a hierarchy in their signiﬁcance. But this
hierarchy cannot be constant, since the role of some processes can vary in a wide
range of their signiﬁcance for climatic variations. Consideration of one factor
separately simpliﬁes an analysis of its impact on climate. In fact, the impact of the
greenhouse effect is determined by an exceeding of surface temperature TL over the
effective temperature Te. The Earth’s surface temperature TL is a function of surface
emissivity κ. The effective temperature Te is a function of emissivity α of the
atmosphere-land-ocean system. In general, the parameters κ and α depend on many
factors, in particular, on the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. There are a lot of
simple and complicated numerical models where attempts have been made to
parameterize these dependences. Unfortunately, there is not a single model that can
meet the requirements of adequacy and reliably describe the prehistory of the
climatic trends on Earth. Nevertheless, one can state that the greenhouse effect
depends non-linearly on the difference TL −Te, that is, on atmospheric turbidity,
especially in the long-wave region. The more CO2 is in the atmosphere, the stronger
is the atmospheric turbidity. The strongest effect of CO2 on the atmospheric tur-
bidity is in the long-wave region 12–18 μm. This effect is weaker in the wavelength
intervals 7–8, 9–10, 2.0, 2.7, and 4.3 μm. It is clear that with the increasing partial
pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere the role of various bands of CO2 will grow, and
it means that with the intensiﬁed CO2 absorption bands the upward long-wave
radiation ﬂux will decrease. At the same time, the downward long-wave radiation
ﬂux on the Earth surface will increase. From the available estimates, a reduction of
the upward and increase of the downward ﬂuxes are estimated at 2.5 and
1.3 W m−2, respectively.
Thus, to estimate the level of the greenhouse effect due to CO2 and other GHGs
(Table 1.8), it is necessary to know how to predict their concentration in the
atmosphere, with all feedbacks in their global biogeochemical cycle taken into
account (Watson et al. 2000; Krapivin and Potapov 2007). This problem touches
upon several spheres of science—biogeochemistry, geochemistry, soil science,
ecology, agrochemistry, geology, oceanology, physiology, and radiochemistry. The
present methods of the global ecoinformatics enable one to combine knowledge
accumulated in these ﬁelds.
Of course, the global cycle of chemical elements should be studied not only to be
able to assess the climatic consequences of the anthropogenic activity but also to
understand the prospects of the environmental dynamics from the viewpoint of its
quality and possibility of life. Since the cycles of chemical elements in nature are
closely connected with living substance activity, one can single out the geological,

biogenic, and biological cycles of this rotation. The biogenic cycle includes sub-
cycles, such as biogeochemical, biogeocenotic, and geochemical.
Land ecosystems play an important role in the biogeochemical cycles’ dynamics
on Earth. The anthropogenic changes in vegetation covers affect the biogeochemical
cycles and, thereby, other processes, climate included. The most well-known and
important biogeochemical cycles, for example, include cycles of carbon, nitrogen,
oxygen, phosphorus, and water. Biogeochemical cycles always involve equilibrium
states: a balance in the cycling of the element between land surface compartments.
Chemical elements participate in the processes of photosynthesis and respiration of
plants, as well as their dying-off, through which their exchange is formed between
compartments and elements of land ecosystems. The most characteristic features of
biogeochemical cycles of individual chemical elements are as follows:
• The nitrogen cycle is a much more complicated biogeochemical cycle but also
cycles through living parts and nonliving parts including the water, land, and air.
Nitrogen is a very important element in that it is part of both proteins, present in
the composition of the amino acids that make up proteins, as well as nucleic
acids such as DNA and RNA, present in nitrogenous bases. The largest reservoir
of nitrogen is the atmosphere, in which about 78 % of nitrogen is contained as
nitrogen gas (N2). Nitrogen gas is “ﬁxed,” in a process called nitrogen ﬁxation.
Nitrogen ﬁxation combines nitrogen with oxygen to create nitrates (NO3).
• The oxygen cycle is the biogeochemical cycle that describes the movement of
oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs: the atmosphere, the bio-
sphere, and the lithosphere. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is
photosynthesis, which is responsible for the modern Earth’s atmosphere and life.
• The carbon cycle is the biogeochemical cycle by which carbon is exchanged
between the biosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere of the Earth.
The cycle is usually thought of as four major reservoirs of carbon interconnected
by pathways of exchange. The reservoirs are the atmosphere, the terrestrial
biosphere (which usually includes freshwater systems and non-living organic
material, such as soil carbon), the oceans, and the sediments.
• The phosphorus cycle is the biogeochemical cycle that describes the movement
of phosphorus through the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. Unlike

many other biogeochemicals, the atmosphere does not play a signiﬁcant role in
the movements of phosphorus, because phosphorus and phosphorus-based
compounds are usually solids at the typical ranges of temperature and pressure
found on Earth.
• The essential steps of the sulfur cycle are:
(1) Mineralization of organic sulfur to the inorganic form, hydrogen sulﬁde:
(H2S).
(2) Oxidation of sulﬁde and elemental sulfur (S) and related compounds to
sulfate (SO42).
(3) Reduction of sulfate to sulﬁde.
(4) Microbial immobilization of the sulfur compounds and subsequent incor-
poration into the organic form of sulfur.
• The water cycle is the continuous circulation of water within the Earth’s
hydrosphere. As water moves through the cycle, it changes state between liquid,
solid, and gas phases.
• Hydrogen is one of the constituents of water. It recycles as in the other bio-
geochemical cycles. It is actively involved with the other cycles like the carbon
cycle, nitrogen cycle and sulfur cycle as well.
A detailed description of biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phospho-
rus, sulfur, and water in land ecosystems has been given in a works of Kondratyev
et al. (2003b, c). The main reservoirs of these elements are biomass and soil,
between which a matter exchange takes place through respiration of plants, their
photosynthesis and dying-off. Modeling of this exchange requires knowledge of the
spatial structure of vegetation cover and its classiﬁcation.
• Population density;
• Potential natural vegetation;
• Cropland extent from 1700 to present;
• Grazing land extent;
• Built-up land extent;
• The major crops extent;
• Land suitability for cultivation.
Of course, an accurate assessment of the ﬂuxes of chemical elements in the
atmosphere-vegetation-soil system is only possible with a detailed inventory of land
covers. For instance, Fang et al. (2001) have undertaken such an inventory for
seven time periods over the territory of China, marking planted and natural forests.
It was shown that a maximum rate (0.035 PgC year−1) of carbon assimilation from
the atmosphere was observed between 1989 and 1993, with the periods of maxi-
mum for different types of forests not coinciding. This conﬁrms the fact that for an
accurate and reliable calculation of carbon ﬂuxes in the atmosphere-vegetation-soil
system, one should have characteristics of vegetation covers of different types
distributed in space and time. And since there is no such concentrated data, all
available estimates of CO2 sinks on land cannot be considered reliable. This is
1.5

conﬁrmed by the data of the structural analysis of the forest ecosystems’ biodi-
versity in South Asia, Far East, and Japan performed by the Institute for Global
Environmental Strategies (IGES) and in which estimates of the rates of forests’
degradation are given (Inoue and Isozaki 2003). As Austin et al. (2004) have
shown, the sporadic nature of water availability in arid and deserted territories is the
cause of great shifts in the C/N ratio and, hence, considerable heterogeneities in the
biogeochemical cycles of these territories.
From estimates of Stoll-Kleemann and O’Riordan (2004), about 70 % of land
surface are anthropogenically affected causing changes in biodiversity thousands
times faster than it takes place naturally. Global biodiversity cannot be maintained
without changing the strategy of human behaviour in the sphere of the environ-
mental protection. Therefore, one should expect a crisis in biodiversity, unless the
international cooperation on its protection becomes effective.
Global scales of variability of the biogeochemical cycles of many elements
raises a problem of control of the state of water ecosystems not only with local
sources of pollution taken into account, but also, and to a greater extent, distant
transports of chemical matter and biological pollutions. Input of various substances
to water ecosystems leads to a degradation of ﬁsh populations and a change in
sanitary conditions for population in adjacent regions. The ways of penetration of
undesired substances to water ecosystems are diverse, including river and shore
runs-off as basic highways of pollutants propagation. Therefore, protection of water
ecosystems under present-day conditions of globalization requires technologies and
systems to control additional ﬂuxes of nitrogen and phosphorus which provide a
minimum of the oxygen balance violation and preserve natural trends of the living
elements’ biomass. As Fourie et al. (2004) noted, it is especially important for water
ecosystems in many regions of Africa, where only the atmosphere is an external
source of additional biogenic elements.
Inland water ecosystems are divided into fresh-water and salted ecosystems. The
simplest scheme of life organization in these ecosystems consists in interactions of
living elements with abiotic components (penetration of light, water currents, dis-
solved nutrient concentrations, and suspended solids). The producers supply O2 to
the aquatic systems through photosynthesis. This O2 is then used by the producers,
consumers and decomposers through aerobic respiration. The CO2 enters an aquatic
system from the atmosphere and through aerobic respiration by producers, con-
sumers, and decomposers and it’s removed by photosynthesizing producers. The
concentration of oxygen in water depends on the amount of pollutants entering the
ecosystem. These pollutants, depending on their type, can affect directly the aquatic
organisms and indirectly through the process of eutrophication. As a result, the
input of pollutants to the water ecosystemleads to a change of its role in the gas
exchange with the atmosphere.
There are not less than 1,500 substances as pollutants in freshwater ecosystems.
Among them are the following:
52

Information-Modeling Technology for the Environmental Monitoring

• Acids and alkalies. Most freshwater lakes, streams, and ponds have a natural pH
in the range of 6–8. Acid deposition has many harmful ecological effects when
the pH of most aquatic systems falls below 6 and especially below 5.
• Anions. The most toxic form of cyanide is free cyanide, which includes the
cyanide anion itself and hydrogen cyanide, HCN, either in a gaseous or aqueous
state. One teaspoon of a 2 % cyanide solution can kill a person.
• Detergents. There are two kinds of detergents with different characteristics:
phosphate detergents and surfactant detergents. Detergents that contain phos-
phates are highly caustic, and surfactant detergents are very toxic.
• Gases. Some gases that can harm aquatic freshwater life are gases such as
chlorine, ammonia and methane.
• Heat. Respiration and growth rates may be changed and these may alter the
feeding rates of organisms. The reproduction period may be brought forward
and development may be speeded up. Parasites and diseases may also be
affected. An increase of temperature also means a decrease in oxygen solubility.
• Heavy metals. The most common heavy metal pollutants are arsenic, cadmium,
chromium, copper, nickel, lead and mercury. Some metals, such as manganese,
iron, copper, and zinc are essential micronutrients. Each type of heavy metals in
its own way affects the water ecosystem’s biochemistry and can accumulate in
bottom deposits and in the biomass of living elements.
• Nutrients. Too many nutrients stimulate the rapid growth of plants and algae,
clogging waterways and sometimes creating blooms of toxic blue-green algae.
This process is called eutrophication.
• Organic pollution. Organic pollution occurs when large quantities of organic
compounds, which act as substrates for microorganisms, are released into
watercourses. Organic pollutants consist of proteins, carbohydrates, fats and
nucleic acids in a multiplicity of combinations. Organic pollution affects the
organisms living in a stream by lowering the available oxygen in the water.
• Pathogens. A pathogen is an organism that produces a disease.
The process of eutrophication is the most widespread phenomenon in the life of
water ecosystems. An excess amount of nitrogen and phosphorus leads to a rapid
growth of phytoplankton or algae biomass, and as a result, the content of oxygen in
the water decreases sharply, and the mortality of living organisms grows substan-
tially. The gas exchange with the atmosphere is violated. From available estimates,
the share of eutrophicated lakes on different continents constitutes: Asia—54 %,
Europe—53 %, North America—48 %, South America—41 %, and Africa—28 %.
In the present-day world, it is difﬁcult to differentiate the anthropogenic process of
eutrophication from natural because of globalized biogeochemical cycles and dif-
ﬁcult control of the ﬂuxes of chemical elements through the atmosphere and river
run-off.
Stability of the biosphere as a global ecosystem and its self-regulating ability are
determined by the cyclic character of the processes of exchange with matter,
energy, and information taking place in it and realized due to the incoming solar
1.5

energy and activity of living substance. These processes manifest themselves in the
following three basic forms:
(1) Biological cycle covers all biophyllic elements and vitally important mic-
roelements and is characterized by selection of light-weight isotopes of car-
bon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur from heavier forms.
(2) Water cycle in the biosphere determines the planetary transitions of various
components such as aerosols, microorganisms, dissolved and suspended
substances.
(3) Processes of erosion, chemical denudation, transition, sedimentation, and
accumulation of mechanical and chemical deposits on land and in the ocean
provide the global circulation of matter and energy.
Therefore a discussion of the greenhouse effect problem cannot by constructive
without a complex consideration of feedbacks of the CO2 cycle with the biogeo-
chemical processes in the presence of other elements such as nitrogen, sulfur,
phosphorus, methane, ozone, water, and others (Fasham 2003; Melillo et al. 2003;
Wang et al. 2005). The processes of CO2 assimilation from the atmosphere are
affected by numerous natural and anthropogenic factors manifested through a long
chain of cause-and-effect bonds. For instance, acid rains affect the state of the
vegetation cover and the latter affects the CO2 exchange at the atmosphere-land
boundary. The use of nitrogen (≈90 × 106 t N year−1) and phosphorus fertilizers in
agriculture changes the role of cultural plants in assimilation of atmospheric CO2 and
affects the rates of decomposition of the soil organic matter. Besides, in agriculture
manure is an important source of greenhouse gases CH4 and N2O. So, Park et al.
(2006) studied the ﬂuxes of CH4 and N2O from supplies of liquid pig manure under
cold climate conditions at an annual mean temperature below 10 °C at the farms of
Ontario (Canada) for the period 2000–2002. At the annual mean air temperature
8.4 °C the manure temperature was, on the average, higher by 4 °C, and an average
content of dry matter in manure and decomposition potential ranged within 0.6–3 %
and −232 ÷ 333 mV. Average ﬂuxes of N2O changed depending on the ﬁrm from
zero to 337.6 μg m−2 s−1 in summer and to 101.8 μg m−2 s−1 in winter. Monthly
mean ﬂuxes of CH4 ranged between 4.6 × 10−3 and 1.05 mg m−2 s−1. The presence
of such data for the globe would make it possible to specify the structure of the
biogeochemical cycle of GHGs.
However, the complexity of the biogeochemical cycles of GHGs and estimates
of how well they are understood indicate the necessity of caution when predicting
global changes and the development of new information technologies to study these
cycles in correlation with other global processes. The developed countries spend
huge resources to create an information base which would provide reliable pre-
dictions of climate change. But, practically all international programs targeting this
are investigating parts of the overall scheme. For instance, the scientiﬁc priorities of
the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) program include:

• Determine how changes in basin-scale forcing affect the dynamics of the North
Paciﬁc Drift Current and how these dynamics affect the nutrient and carbon
trapping capacity of the California Current System.
• Understand the imbalance between nitrogen ﬁxation and denitriﬁcation (the
marine nitrogen cycle) and its relationship to the ability of the oceanic biological
pump to sequester anthropogenic carbon dioxide.
• Quantify how regime shifts interact with seasonal and stochastic variability to
produce extreme events such as the recent coccolithophorid bloom in the Bering
Sea and the basin-scale hypoxia (Murata and Takizawa 2002; Weeks et al.
2004).
Unfortunately, even a complex program such as the GCP cannot resolve the
problem of assessing enough information for reliable prediction of global change.
One of the technologies capable to constructively resolve this problem is the GIMS-
technology.
On the whole, many chemical elements, especially GHGs, getting to the envi-
ronment from anthropogenic sources, become an object of not only biogeochemical
analysis but also of economic consideration. Such a multi-purpose analysis in
connection with CH4 was carried out at the Second International Conference in
Novosibirsk in 2000 (Bazhin 2000; Byakola 2000). Such connections should be
thoroughly systematized and parameterized. Otherwise it is impossible to speak
about any reliable assessment of the role of the biosphere in assimilation of excess
CO2 from the atmosphere. Complex studies in this direction are being carried out,
for instance, in several laboratories in the USA and Europe (Friedrich 2001).
Measurements of spatial and temporal distributions of gases related to the global
CO2 cycle are made in the zones of the functioning observatories with the use of
ﬂying laboratories and specialized stationary platforms. Accumulation of such data
will make it possible to reveal dependences needed for the global model. However,
the USA take their irreconcilable stand with respect to the Kyoto Protocol despite

(541 × 107 t CO2 year−1) of all its anthropogenic sources over the globe. In March
2001, President Bush said he wouldn’t be ratifying the Kyoto Protocol because it
could signiﬁcantly damage the country ﬁnancially. He was also concerned about the
pressure on “industrialized” countries to cut back on carbon dioxide, while
developing countries weren’t expected to cut theirs back too. Emissions in America
have continued to rise and are now 11 % higher than in 1990, even though when
they did temporarily sign up to Kyoto, they promised a 6 % reduction.
All this conﬁrms the fact that fragmentary studies of the global carbon cycle (i.e.,
not based on a complex such as that described in Krapivin and Kondratyev (2002)
will always raise doubts. For global conclusions, like those made in the Kyoto
Protocol recommendations, we need to be sure that the predicted global conse-
quences are accurate. Nevertheless, such conclusions and assessments are neces-
sary. Unfortunately, most of the international programs on the subject considered
are not aimed at the development of the global modeling technology and do not
concentrate the efforts of specialists on deriving numerical NSS models.

A Global Model as Unit of the Information-Modeling Technology

Existing global models are simple and inadequately provided with data bases.
Three directions in the global modeling have been described in the works of
Kondratyev et al. (2002) and Boysen (2000). In each of them one or several
components are absent, but on the whole, conceptually they are mutually additively.
This makes it possible to combine them and, hence, to derive a global model which
would take into account the most important processes in the nature-society system.
One of them is the gas exchange between the atmosphere and vegetation cover
described in global models at a very high level. Nevertheless, models of land
ecosystem have recently appeared, such as Biome-GCP, Forest-GCP or TsuBiMo
(Wang et al. 2005; Alexandrov et al. 2005) which simulate the supplies and ﬂuxes
of energy, water, hydrogen, and nitrogen in the vegetation cover, litter, and soil,
which enables us to specify the role of land in regulating radiation balance of the
atmosphere-plant-soil system. In particular, Wang et al. (2005) have studied the
ﬂuxes of H2O, CO2, and nitrogen in the plains of North China from the data on
vegetation and soils for 2002 and showed that the model Biome-GCP provides a
reliable assessment of the response of land ecosystems to the anthropogenic
interference into the natural balance of water, carbon, and nitrogen. Without any
interference these ecosystems are in a balanced state with regard to these elements,
but interference intensiﬁes the ﬂuxes of CO2 and H2O, and excess nitrogen gets into
the soil and neighboring water basins, contaminating them.
Clearly, a systematization of the models of land ecosystems and their intro-
duction to GIMS as alternative units, whose application is regulated by available
data bases, will make it possible to markedly reduce the level of uncertainty in the
estimates of CO2 sinks and sources. Such a study has been exempliﬁed in the work
of Alexandrov et al. (2005) where a calibration of TsuBiMo by the data base of the
Osnabrueck Centre for Environment and Technology (Germany) is demonstrated.
The proposed scheme of calibration consists of four stages:
(1) Reduction of the number of unspeciﬁed parameters of the model by intro-
ducing a generalized parameter.
(2) Evaluation of generalized parameters from available data base.
(3) Formation of the empirical model relating generalized parameters to climate.
(4) Establishing relationship between the global multitude of generalized
parameters and global ﬁelds of climatic variables.
Applying this scheme of calculation to the TsuBiMo model, Alexandrov et al.
(2005), from measurements of CO2 ﬂuxes in the neighborhood of Takayama
(Japan), constructed an empirical model to calculate monthly mean temperatures
and showed that the accuracy of calculations of the inter-annual and intra-annual
variability of biomes productivity can be substantially increased on a local level.
The photochemical system of the atmosphere has been poorly studied and is not
considered in global models. Knowledge of the laws of changes in the incoming
radiation intensity in connection with the effects of its assimilation by gases and
aerosols will make it possible to raise the accuracy of the greenhouse effect esti-
mates. And ﬁrst of all, of importance here is the role of molecular nitrogen, ozone,
water vapour, nitric oxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, CH4, CO2, and other
56

gases. Greenhouse gases, other than CO2, can in the future play an unpredictable
role in formation of the Earth radiation balance. Therefore some models are pro-
posed here which enable one to parameterize part of the indicated elements.
1.6 Block Schemes of Models for Biogeochemical Cycles
1.6.1 Schemes of the Global Carbon Cycle
The reliability of the assessment of the role of CO2 in the greenhouse effect for-
mation depends on a detailed consideration of the global biogeochemical carbon
cycle dynamics in the models and on the accuracy of the assessment of its char-
acteristics. There are dozens of diagrams of the global carbon cycle in the form of
CO2 changes. Consider some of them to demonstrate their principal features and to
understand the limit for necessary details of the simulation of the carbon cycle
compounds, beyond which it is impossible to obtain an additional knowledge about
this cycle and, hence, about the greenhouse effect due to CO2. Note that all known
diagrams of the global CO2 cycle are divided into two classes: point wise (globally
averaged) and spatial (locally averaged). All the diagrams are similar in that the
biosphere is divided into the atmosphere, oceans, and land ecosystems. Many
diagrams divide carbon into organic and inorganic forms. As a rule, the time step of
averaging all processes and reservoirs of carbon is assumed to be 1 year, and
therefore the atmospheric reservoir is considered as homogeneously mixed-up
(pointwise). The World Ocean and surface ecosystems are considerably detailed.
This detailing is based on global data bases for these reservoirs of carbon. As a rule,
the ﬁnal results of the diagrams studies are either of methodical character or they
predict the atmospheric CO2 concentrations within the limits of a certain scenario of
the anthropogenic activity.
The schemes in Figs. 1.23 and 1.24 give an idea about the amounts of carbon
supplies for its basic reservoirs. The estimates shown in this scheme differ drasti-
cally from the estimates by other authors. Nevertheless, their relationships and
orders of magnitude coincide in most cases. As seen, the largest carbon supply is
concentrated in the World Ocean. A minimum of it is in the atmosphere.
Natural processes determining the global carbon cycle dynamics have various
time scales. Some of them, such as burying the dead organic matter at the bottom of
the oceans, have characteristic time scales of hundreds and thousands years. Others,
for instance the biological carbon cycle on land, have a period of several tens of
years. Therefore a consideration of the timescales of the carbon cycle in the bio-
sphere is an important stage of studies of the dynamics of the CO2 content in the
atmosphere. Here it is also important to consider the fact that the characteristic time
of the complete mixing of the atmosphere constitutes from several months to
2 years. Regular measurements at different stations of monitoring have shown that
the CO2 concentration varies considerably during 1 year. The difference between
maximum and minimum estimates of the atmospheric CO2 concentrations varies
1.5

from 10 ppm at the South Pole to 15 × 10 ppm at the NH high-latitudes. This spatial
non-uniformity is explained by the presence in the Northern Hemisphere of large
seasonally photosynthesizing vegetation communities.
Diagram of the fast carbon cycle represented in Fig. 1.25 shows the movement
of carbon between land, atmosphere, and oceans in billions of tons of carbon per
year. Yellow numbers are natural ﬂuxes, red are human contributions in billions of
tons of carbon per year. White numbers indicate stored carbon. As it follows from
Figs. 1.23, 1.24 and 1.25 latitudinal distribution of CO2 in the atmosphere has non-
linear character. An increased CO2 content in the NH atmosphere is closely con-
nected with the impact of human activity through direct CO2 emissions and due to
the impact on vegetation cover. Almost 90 % of total carbon emissions due to
organic fuel burning fall on the zone 30oN–60oN. It follows from the data in
Table 1.9 that the conceptual schemes of the global biogeochemical cycle of carbon
dioxide should also consider the spatial non-uniformity of atmospheric processes
(Kaminski et al. 2001).
An important constituent of most of the conceptual schemes of the global carbon
cycle is the structure of carbon ﬂuxes in the World Ocean. As follows from
Table 1.9, there is a certain information possibility to select in the oceans several
layers by depths and to distinguish between the spatial non-uniformities in the
structure of the ocean surface. Most of the authors consider the vertical structure of

the oceans in the form of two or three layers covering the photic layer and deep
layers. Within the photic layer, the layers can be selected above and beneath the
thermocline. The spatial non-uniformity of the ocean is demonstrated through
upwelling and latitudinal zones, with different rates and directions of the oceans-
atmosphere CO2 exchange. More detailed schemes of the global carbon cycle take
into account non-uniformities in the carbonate system of the oceans, which makes it
possible to considerably increase the accuracy of the respective models. Two of the
widely used schemes of this type are shown in Figs. 1.26 and 1.27.
The role of the World Ocean in the global CO2 cycle is mainly manifested
through the process of its exchange on the atmosphere-ocean border. The intensity
of gas exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere is determined by the
dynamic characteristics of the turbulent layers of water and air near the interface.
Here, numerous physical schemes appear that reﬂect the situations of sea wave
formation, as well as formation of foam and various ﬁlms. As a result, carbon
dioxide either dissolves in the ocean providing thereby the inﬂow of CO2 needed
for photosynthesis or is emitted from the ocean into the atmosphere. The cause of
this binary situation on the air-water border is the difference between the partial
pressures of CO2 in the atmosphere and CO2 dissolved in the water. Actually, this

directed transport of CO2 on the border “atmosphere-ocean” is more complicated.
Its study requires expensive ﬁeld experiments and a detailed classiﬁcation of both
synoptic and physico-geographical situations on the oceans’ surface.
In the programmes of studies of the global carbon cycles the emphasis is placed
on the role of surface ecosystems in its formation (Houghton et al. 2001). In the
process of photosynthesis, plants assimilate carbon dioxide and, on the contrary, the
decomposing dead plants emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Thus a con-
tinuous CO2 exchange between living and dead organic matter and the atmosphere
takes place in the land biosphere. There are many conceptual diagrams, which
formalize this exchange and serve the basis for global models of the carbon cycle.
Two examples of such diagrams are given in Figs. 1.28 and 1.29.
Clearly, the accuracy of estimates of carbon ﬂuxes in the terrestrial part of the
biosphere is the function of a detailed quantization of the types of soil-plant

formations and accuracy of the parameterization of the biocenotic processes. In this
regard the world maps of vegetation and soils have been drawn, their areas esti-
mated, and data on the vital functions of soil microorganisms have been accumu-
lated, and technologies of an operational monitoring of landscapes have been
worked out. Unfortunately, there are no reliable enough estimates of the limits for
considering details of the soil-plant formations, which would provide the needed
accuracy of the carbon ﬂuxes estimation. To solve this problem, a global model of
carbon cycle is needed which would reﬂect a hierarchy of important, by their expert
estimates, constituents of the biosphere and the processes of carbon transformation.
An exemplary scheme of carbon ﬂux in this model is characterized in Fig. 1.30.
Numerical experiments with this model will make it possible to obtain comparative
assessments of the consequences of complicating its various constituents and
thereby to approach sequentially the level of an optimal spatial quantization.

1.6.2 Conceptual Schemes of the Nitrogen Cycle in Nature
The global cycle of nitrogen as one of the nutrient elements is a mosaic structure of
local processes of its compounds formed due to water migration and atmospheric
processes. The present-day nitrogen cycle is strongly subject to anthropogenic
forcings manifested through interference into the nitrogen cycle both directly and
via the inﬂuence on the related processes. Therefore the construction of an adequate

whole complex of natural processes and those initiated by humans. A general
description of supplies and ﬂuxes of nitrogen is schematically given in Figs. 1.31,
1.32, 1.33, 1.34 and 1.35.
The natural sources of nitrogen oxides are connected with the vital functions of
bacteria, volcanic eruptions, as well as several atmospheric phenomena (e.g.,
lightening discharges). The biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen includes the processes

such as ﬁxation, mineralization, nitriﬁcation, assimilation, and dissimilation. The
structural schemes of these processes have been described in detail by many
authors. Their complexity level is determined by the goal of studies, availability of
data on the rates of transformation of the nitrogen-containing compounds and their
supplies, by the level of detailing, etc.
Nitrogen moves in the biosphere by a complicated meandering structure of
ﬂuxes consisting of a hierarchy of cycles at various levels of life organization. From
the atmosphere, nitrogen enters the cells of microorganisms, from which it goes to
soil and then to higher plants, animals, and humans. Dying off of living organisms
results in the turn of nitrogen to the soil, from which it is either consumed by plants
and living organisms or is emitted to the atmosphere. About the same scheme of
nitrogen oxide cycling is inherent to the hydrosphere. The characteristic feature
of these cycles is their openness connected with the available processes of removal
of nitrogen from the biospheric balance into rocks, from where it returns much
slower. Taking into account the nature of the nitrogen cycle in the biosphere and its
reservoir structure enables one to formulate a global scheme of nitrogen ﬂuxes.
To simplify the calculation scheme presented in Fig. 1.35, advection processes in
the balance equations of nitrogen cycle can be described by a superposition of the
ﬂuxes HN
14 and HN
15. The computer realization of these equations introduces into
them some corrections for the agreement between the dimensionalities of the

the estimates of the ﬂuxes HN

given below for their consideration in the GIMS
should be corrected following this criterion. Detailed description of the nitrogen
cycle as unit of the GIMS was given by Nitu et al. (2000a).
1.6.3 Conceptual Schemes of the Global Oxygen Cycle
The oxygen cycle in nature is composed of characteristic biogeochemical transi-
tions between the reservoirs of basic constituents circulating in the biosphere
(Kasting and Canﬁeld 2012). Therefore the block-scheme of the oxygen exchange
is similar to those of sulfur, nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorus (Figs. 1.36 and 1.37).
However, oxygen refers to the constituents spread over the globe most widely,
which makes it one of the substantial components of the biogeochemical cycles. Its
amount in the Earth’s crust, including the hydrosphere, reaches 49 % by mass. The
lithosphere (without the ocean and the atmosphere) contains 47.2 % of oxygen,
water—88.89 %. In the ocean water, oxygen constitutes 85.82 %, the living
substance contains 65 % by mass. These estimates testify to a signiﬁcance of
oxygen for the biosphere, an appearance and existence of which are determined by
the presence of oxygen. Now about 39 × 1014 t O2 circulate in the biosphere,

surface waters of the World Ocean. On the whole, for the oceans and long-lived
biota, oxygen completes its cycle for 500 and 50 years, respectively.
Oxygen is present in the biosphere in the form of molecular oxygen (O2), ozone
(O3), atomic oxygen (O), and as a constituent of various oxides. On the one hand,
oxygen maintains life on the Earth due to the process of respiration and formation
of the ozone layer, and on the other hand, it itself is the product of the organisms’
functioning. This fact hinders a description of its cycle, since it requires a synthesis
of the descriptions of various processes. Here an attempt has been made to describe
the cycle and to derive a model of the global biogeochemical oxygen cycle
(MGBO) as unit of the BCSS global model.
Many authors believe that in the nearest future nothing threatens the stability of
the global biogeochemical cycle of oxygen. This statement is not valid for ozone,
whose concentration and spatial distribution suffered serious changes during the last
decades. According to Kondratyev and Varotsos (2000), the available observations
of the vertical proﬁle of atmospheric ozone show a very complicated spatial and
temporal variability that depends on many characteristics of the nature-society
system. The MGBO unit at a parameterization of ozone ﬂuxes follows a numerical
model by Aloyan (2004) and Arutiunian et al. (2004), with a needed correlation
taken into account. This correction consists in the substitution of some functional
dependence for scenarios reﬂecting the dynamics of changes in concentrations of
the chemicals not described in the global model of the carbon cycle.

Now and in the geological past there have been two sources of oxygen—
endogenic and photosynthetical. Without dwelling upon the respective scientiﬁc
discussions and all existing concepts, we shall try to describe the sources of oxygen
in the present biosphere, following numerous studies in this ﬁeld.
The basic source of atomic oxygen is the photosynthesis of plants, whose
equation has the form:
light
2H2O + CO2
COH + H2O + O2
                      chlorophyll 
Photosynthesis produces annually above 50 × 109 t of oxygen, that is, of an
order of 3.3 × 1014 % of its supplies in the atmosphere. Hence, we see that only due
to photosynthesis can the oxygen supplies in the atmosphere be totally renewed
during a time period of 300 thousand years. About 80 % of the total amount of
oxygen produced by photosynthesis result from phytoplankton functioning, and
land vegetation communities produce only 20 %.
Global scheme of oxygen cycle in the BCSS was proposed by Krapivin and
Varotsos (2008) that is represented in Fig. 1.38.

1.6.4 Biogeochemical Cycle of Methane
The SMKP item of the BCSS model includes additional descriptions of the methane
cycle components that are not taken into account in other biogeochemical cycles.
Methane like carbon dioxide belongs to greenhouse gases. The spectrum of its
natural and anthropogenic sources is wide, and its greenhouse effect exceeds 20
times that of CO2 though its concentration (*1.6 ppm) in the atmosphere is about
200 times less than that of CO2 (Polischuk and Polischuk 2013). By the greenhouse
effect, it is now second to carbon dioxide. Methane also affects the ozone content in
the stratosphere and plays a key role in transformation of chemically active Cl into
less active HCl. Before the human interference, the natural cycle of methane had
been balanced with respect to climate. With extracting natural combustible gases
consisting by 90–95 % of methane, humankind has contributed to this cycle factors
of instability and uncertainty. In the whole, during the last 200 years the anthro-
pogenic contribution to the input of CH4 to the atmosphere has doubled. A situation
has occurred when the difference between methane concentrations at Poles reaches
150 ppb. Most of the authors estimated the level of the global emission of methane
into the atmosphere at 535 × 106 t CH4 year−1, of which 375 × 106 t CH4 year−1 is
of anthropogenic origin (50 × 106 t CH4 year−1 being from the rice ﬁelds).

The anthropogenic input of methane is expected to grow within the next
20–30 years, though in some developed regions, measures are taken to reduce the
anthropogenic emissions of methane into the atmosphere. Nevertheless, the con-
centration of methane in the present atmosphere increases 7 times faster than the
growth of CO2 concentration, so that its amount increases annually by 2 %, that is,
by the year 2020 the amount of methane in the atmosphere can double compared to
2000, which, from numerous estimates, will lead to a global warming by
0.2–0.4 °C. Like in the case of CO2, these estimates will remain rather doubtful and
contradictory until the global model mentioned above is synthesized. However,

with present knowledge, only ﬁrst steps are possible in modeling all these features
of the global cycle of CH4.
The sources of methane are oil, sedimentary and ejected rocks, bottom sediments
of lakes, seas, oceans, and other objects of the hydrosphere, as well as soil, peat-
bogs, rice plantations, and others:
• natural gas and oil extracting and reﬁning systems;
• vital functions of animals;
• heaps of solid waste;
• coal mines functioning;
• processing of stock-breeding waste;
• sewage processing;
• anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in ﬂooded rice ﬁelds;
• fossil fuel burning at stationary and mobile systems;
• burning of agricultural waste, biomass, rubbish, and ﬁres in savannahs; and
• various industrial processes.
The basic reaction of methane formation due to anaerobic fermentation or
mineralization of organic matter is as follows:
C6H12O6 ! 3CO2 þ 3CH4:
Sinks for tropospheric methane are:
• reaction with hydroxyl radical (*90 %);
• transport to the stratosphere (*5 %); and
• oxidation in dry soil (*5 %).
Ways of methane transformation, as shown in Table 1.13, include numerous
processes by 70–80 % of biogenic origin mostly affected by humans. Of course, the
signiﬁcance of these processes varies depending on many natural and anthropo-
genic parameters. Relationships of individual elements of correlation between the
cycles of CO2, CH4, and other chemicals vary, too. At any rate, it is clear that
depending on the strategy adopted for the nature-society system, in due course the
composition of the terrestrial atmosphere will change substantially. Sufﬁce it to say
that only burning of 1 m3 of methane extracts from the atmosphere 2 m3 O2. From
the open dust-heaps and municipal and industrial sewage, the atmosphere receives
annually about 2 % of anthropogenic methane (*270–460 × 106 t C). These
integral estimates do not permit one to calculate an actual distribution of CH4 ﬂux
in the atmosphere.
A certain contribution to detailing of the spatial distribution of the sources of
methane was made at the Second International Conference on the problems of
methane held in Novosibirsk in 2000. Proceedings of this Conference contain
concrete data on the sources of methane in many regions of the globe. For instance,
according to Byakola (2000), within the framework of the international UNEP/GDP
project, an inventory of the sources and sinks of CO2 and CH4 has been made for
the territory of Uganda (236 × 103 km2). In Uganda, basic anthropogenic sources of
74

methane are agriculture, municipal sewage, and biomass burning. In 1990, the

205.45 × 103 t and 23.45 × 103 t CH4, respectively. The agricultural waste burning
added 3.55 × 103 t CH4.
Naturally, Uganda needs to reduce the GHGs emissions, but the threshold at
which such emissions must not be exceeded is unknown. Of course, the stock-
breeding and rice production in Uganda will develop in future, increasing thereby
the volumes of CH4 emitted to the atmosphere. Hence, a balanced correlation
should be sought of the economy in the country and the state of the environment.
This problem can be solved with the use of new technologies of nature use. In
particular, one of the ways to reduce CH4 emissions is a secondary utilization of
organic waste, for instance, in paper production. In Uganda, up to 16 % of the urban
wastes are used in paper production.
The gas transport systems are one of the powerful anthropogenic sources of CH4.
The work of Coconea et al. (2000) contains information about methane emissions
from pipelines in the territory of Romania, the country that signed the Lisbon
Protocol in 1994 and now supports the Kyoto Protocol. Romania is the ﬁrst country
in Europe where in 1917 a 50-km pipeline was laid to transport natural gas. At
present, natural gas constitutes 36 % of energy resources of the country, the share of
oil and coal constituting 32.6 and 15.2 %, respectively. Therefore the problem of
anthropogenic input of CH4 from the territory of Romania into the atmosphere is
rather urgent. Here, like in Uganda, the saving technologies play an important role,
reducing by 38.9 % the leakage of methane from the pipelines during the last
20 years constituting 55.35 % in 1994 with respect to the leakage in 1987. On the
whole, both extraction and distribution of coal, oil, and gas in the territory of

Romania give 56 % of the total amount of CH4 emitted from this territory. Agri-
culture takes the second place (29 %).
One of the signiﬁcant sources of CH4 is the territory of Russia, which contributes
to the atmosphere about 47 × 106 t CH4 year−1, and this ﬂux is expected to reach
78 × 106 t CH4 year−1 by 2025. This increase will be caused by the developing
infrastructure of the gas, oil, and coal industry. On global scales, these trends will
be practically observed in all countries. In Table 1.13 the contribution of the coal
industry into CH4 production is estimated for various global regions. These
estimates are determined by technologies used in the coal industry. On the
average, the contributions of various sources into the coal industry itself constitute:
70 %—underground ventilation in the coal-mines, 20 %—underground drainage;
5 %—surface loading and unloading operations; 4 %—opencast mining of
deposits; 1 %—derelict mines.
The global cycle of methane has been studied inadequately, and therefore its
modeling faces a lot of unsolved problems. The CH4 ﬂuxes from the waterlogged
territories have been studied best. These ﬂuxes constitute about 20 % of the total
input of methane to the atmosphere from all sources (Tables 1.14 and 1.15). Note
that almost 80 % of the sources of methane are of the biological nature, so that the
anthropogenic interference into its natural cycle is also possible through violation of
various biospheric processes. In particular, on the waterlogged territories, methane
forms only due to biological processes.
The hydrospheric sources of methane can be presented by a multi-layer model
(Figs. 1.39, 1.40 and 1.41). This scheme describes the vertical structures of most of
the water bodies. Methane forms in the layer of bottom deposits due to bacteria
functioning, and in the zone with oxygen, methane is partially oxidized giving
carbon dioxide CH4 + 2O2 →CO2 + 2H2O + E. Bacteria taking part in methane

methane gets to the atmosphere and, in contrast to CO2, practically does not return
to the water medium. This is somehow connected with the fact that the CH4
solubility in water is almost 40 times lower than that of CO2. The lifetime τH of

methane in the atmosphere is estimated at about 5 years. Its extraction from the
atmosphere takes place due to the participation of methane in photochemical
reactions, resulting in methane oxidation ﬁrst to CO, and then to CO2. The cycle
CO–OH–CP4 plays an important role in the cycle of methane:
OH + CH4 ! CH3 þ H2O; OH þ CO ! CO2 þ H
The participating OH-radicals form in the atmosphere during the water vapor
photolysis. As a result, atmospheric methane is oxidized.
Methane ﬂuxes Ci (i = 1–13) are functions of temperature, microbial population,
geographical coordinates and other environmental characteristics that are speciﬁc
for pixels Ξij. For example, Panikov and Dedysh (2000) developed the model for
methane emission to the atmosphere from snow-covered bogs in West Siberia. This
approach can be used for the modeling of anaerobic formation of CH4 in pixels with
the permafrost. In this case ﬂux C8 can be described by the equation:
dC8=dt ¼ lX 1  Y
ð
Þ=Y;
where μ is speciﬁc growth rate of respective microbial population with biomass X,
Y is biomass yield per unit of substrate consumed. Microbial biomass X is formed
with the following law:
dX=dt ¼ lX;
where μ = μmaxSR/(S + KS), S is catabolic substrate concentration, R is the function
of physiological state, KS is saturation constant, numerically equal to that substrate
concentration at which microbial speciﬁc growth rate attains the half of maximal
value (μ = 0.5μmax).
Natural wetlands and rice paddies deliver to the atmosphere more 30 % of global
CH4 emission. Flux C3 can be parameterized by the following equation:
C3 ¼ Hrf1 Ts
ð
Þf2 h
ð Þf3 pH
ð
Þf4 rp
 
;
where Hr is heterotrophic respiration, Ts is soil temperature, h is water table
position, rp is redox potential, functions fi (i = 1–4) parameterized the CH4 emission
rates. Fluxes C1 and C2 that characterize major atmospheric CH4 sinks are mainly
parameterized by its reaction with hydroxyl (OH) radical. These ﬂuxes depend on
the OH levels and reaction rate. Under this, it is known that increase in methane
leads to positive feedback (Xu et al. 2007; Krapivin and Varotsos 2008).
The human interference into the processes described by this diagram breaks the
natural stability of the balance CH4/CO/CO2. In particular, the reclaiming of marshes
is one of such destabilizing factors. For instance, the drainage of 20 % of marshes leads
o a natural reduction of CH4 emissions from the marshes by 20 %, and on the whole,
the amount of methane is reduced by 4 %, which practically does not inﬂuence
climate, but causes changes in the biogeochemical cycles of ozone and carbon dioxide

with unpredicted consequences. These estimates are important for the ﬁnal conclusion
about the level of the integral greenhouse effect. However, the solution of this problem
is connected with many factors, neglecting of which leads to serious errors. For
instance, the CH4 ﬂux on the border atmosphere-marsh depends on the vertical proﬁle
of the temperature in the marsh body. In a simplest case, if we denote as TW(z, t) the
temperature at a time moment t at a depth z and write the equation of heat conductivity
@TWðz; tÞ
@t
¼ a2 @2TWðz; tÞ
@z2
ð1:6Þ
where a2 ¼ Kc1q1, К is the coefﬁcient of heat conductivity, c is speciﬁc heat
capacity, q is the medium density, then an estimation of the ﬂux F1
CH4 as a time
function becomes dependent of the multitude of the poorly assessed characteristics
of the environment.
Let the marsh surface temperature vary cyclically with frequency ω and
amplitude A, decreasing with depth: TW (0, t) = A(z) · cos(ωt), where
AðzÞ ¼ Að0Þ  exp 
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
x

r


ð1:7Þ
The solution to Eq. (1.7) enables us to trace the temperature variations TW(z, t) and
suggests the conclusion that in this case these variations weakly depend on TW(0, t).
Even if TW(0, t) increases by 2 °C, then according to (1.7), the amplitude of temper-
ature changes with depth will rapidly decrease to 0.97, 0.33, and 0.01 °C at depths
40 cm, 2 m, and 3 m, respectively. Hence, with a 2 °C increase in the average global
atmospheric temperature, ﬂux F1
CH4 will increase by no more than 1.4 %.
Comparing the global signiﬁcance of the CO2 and CH4 cycles in the system
atmosphere-marshes, note that the CO2 cycle promotes a climatic stabilization,
whereas the CH4 cycle intensiﬁes the climate changes. With a climate warming the
marshes assimilate part of CO2 from the atmosphere and reduce thereby the
greenhouse effect. On the contrary, when the climate warms due to increasing F1
CH4,
the greenhouse effect intensiﬁes.
The western Siberian region of Russia is characterized by numerous intensive
natural and anthropogenic sources of methane formation. These are marshes, tun-
dra, permafrost, oil and gas deposits. In this region the ﬂux F1
CH4 varies widely both
during a year and shorter time periods. From measurements carried out by
Jagovkina et al. (2000) at the coastline of Yamal in June 1996, the CH4 concen-
tration in the atmosphere at a height of 2 m varied from 1.83 ppmv in June, 18 to
1.98 ppmv in June, 23, with an average daily value of 0.032 ppmv.
The peatbogs of Siberia are quite special in the global cycle of methane. They
play a unique role in the biogeochemical cycles of methane and carbon dioxide. On
the one hand, they are a non-anthropogenic source of CH4 and CO2, but on the
other hand, they are intensive assimilators of carbon from the atmosphere and
extract it from the natural cycle for a long time. The marshes of West Siberia, for
80
1
Information-Modeling Technology for the Environmental Monitoring

instance, contain 20–30 % of the global carbon supplies. The intensity of CH4
emissions from the marshes is, on the average, almost 2,000 times weaker than that
of CO2. 35–50 % of all methane emitted from the territory of Russia fall on the
marshes. The West Siberian marshes emit to the atmosphere not more than
1.7 × 106 t CH4 year−1, which does not exceed 1 % of the global CH4 ﬂux. The
spatial heterogeneity of the ﬂux F1
CH4 is high, which is determined by diverse
characteristics of the marsh ecosystems. In particular, the upper oligotrophic
coniferous-shrubby sphagnous swamps emit 0.9–10 mg C m−2 h−1 (Dementjeva
2000). This estimate is rather approximate, since the scattering of such estimates by
various authors constitutes hundreds of percent. For instance, a drained sphagnous
swamp of the transitional type can emit 142–204 g C m2 h1, and the rush-
sphagnous bogs—83.5–309 mg C m2 h1.
The main mechanism for the formation of methane in a marsh is connected with
the functioning of special groups of microorganisms. Part of methane due to dif-
fusion is emitted to the atmosphere, but most of methane remains in the peat layer
and is gradually emitted to the atmosphere.
Remaking the nature, humankind interferes into the natural biogeochemical
balance of greenhouse gases practically all over the world. One of the aspects of
this remaking is a reduction of the areas of marshes and their transformation into
agricultural ﬁelds. Diverse human agricultural activity adds to the atmosphere 20 %
of all the anthropogenic ﬂux of greenhouse gases. For instance, in the USA it is
30 %. The stockbreeding contributes considerably to this ﬂux. In California and
Wisconsin each hectare of pastures emits annually 502 kg CH4 (or 10,511 kg CO2)
and 134 kg CH4 (or 2,814 kg CO2), respectively. In New Zealand such emissions of
CH4 are estimated at 291 kg CH4 (or 6,110 kg CO2) (Johnson and Ulyatt 2000).
Among the Kyoto Protocol signatories, England takes the ninth place by the
volume of reduced emissions of greenhouse gases. The decreasing trend of methane
emissions is part of the general reduction of emissions of six greenhouse gases (CO2,
CH4, N2O, hydroﬂuorocarbons, perﬂuorocarbons, sulfur hexaﬂuoride) from 1990.
In 2000 the greenhouse emissions decreased by 15 % compared to 1990. By 2010,
the CH4 emissions will constitute 20,134 t year−1. This reduction will be reached
mainly due to new technologies in processing the wastes and in the coal industry. On
the whole, in England, according to the developed scenario, emissions of methane by
2010 will decrease by 14 % in agriculture, by 82 % in the coal industry, by 29 % in
the oil and gas industry, and by 73 % in wastes processing. The possibility of
realization of this scenario is conﬁrmed by the CH4 decreasing trend in 1998
compared to 1990. For instance, during this period, emissions of methane in the coal
industry have decreased by 64 %, and in wastes processing by 29 %. In 1990, the
share of wastes processing in England constituted 32 % of all CH4 emissions, only
3 % of these emissions being connected with sewage processing.
In agriculture, emissions of CH4 in England constituted 1,037 × 103 t in 1990
and 998 × 103 t in 1998. The scenario of reduction of the ﬂux F1
CH4 from the
territory of England due to improved technologies in agriculture foresees emissions
of 902–983 × 103 t CH4 in 2010. The CH4 emission from burning the agricultural
1.6
Block Schemes of Models for Biogeochemical Cycles
81

wastes is completely excluded, and in the stockbreeding, emissions of methane are
reduced by 8 % compared to 1990.
In the coal industry in England, emissions of methane in 1990 constituted
819 × 103 t with the main contribution to this ﬂux made by underground operations.
This constituted 24 % of the whole ﬂux of methane from the territory of England. In
1998 the ﬂux F1
CH4 decreased to 264 × 103 t and by 2010 it should decrease to
218 × 103 t. A similar decreasing trend of methane emissions from the territory of
England remains in the oil and gas industry, too. According to the scenario, the
contribution of these sectors of energy production into the ﬂux F1
CH4 will decrease
from 540 × 103 t in 1990 to 349–464 × 103 t in 2010 (Meadows 2000).
1.6.5 Block-Schemes of Global Sulfur Cycle
Very likely the major sulfur ﬂuxes of both natural and anthropogenic origin have
been described by Ivanov (1981) and Ivanov and Freney (1983). An increase of
intensity and spatial distribution of anthropogenic processes during the last decades
has also manifested itself through a change of the scale of propagation of sulfur
compounds in the biosphere. This effect is conﬁrmed by that compared with the
pre-industrial period, sedimentation of sulfur over the continents and oceans has
increased by 162.5 and 24.6 %, respectively. Emissions of sulfur to the atmosphere
reached 93 × 106 tS year−1. The anthropogenic ﬂux of sulfur in the form of SO2 is
easily estimated, provided 3.1 × 1012 kg of coal are globally burnt every year, with
an average content of sulfur in it 2.5 % (by weight) (Berndt et al. 2004).
An improvement of the global model of the biosphere is connected with an
extension of biogeochemical cycles considered in it. A necessity to include in the
model a unit describing sulfur ﬂuxes in nature systems is dictated by dependence of
biotic processes on the content of sulfur in the biosphere compartments. Available
data on supplies and ﬂuxes of sulfur compounds in the atmosphere, soils, vegetation
cover, and hydrosphere, enable one to formulate mathematical relationships to
describe the global sulfur cycle.
Sulfur compounds affect strongly the quality of the environment and change its
role in regulation of the greenhouse effect. For instance, in December 1952 a fog
consisting of a mixture of smoke and coal dust covered London. As a result, during
1 week more than 2,000 people died of air pollution. These events had happed
before, but had not been recorded as in this case. Measurements carried out in the St.
Bartholomew hospital have shown that the concentration of particles of smoke and
SO2 exceeded several milligrams per m3. In general, London at that time depended
on the use of coal for space heating and energy production, and therefore after that
event attempts have been undertaken to remove sulfur from coal before its burning.
But nevertheless, in 1962 the tragedy repeated with 800 victims due to smog.

Information-Modeling Technology for the Environmental Monitoring

Beginning from 1970, in the OECD countries the problem of air quality has
become the subject of studies at many scientiﬁc centers. Oil from the counties of the
Middle East becomes the main source of energy. The content of sulfur in oil
constitutes 2.5–3 %. In 1985 some European countries signed the CLRTAP pro-
tocol on a 30 % reduction of sulfur emissions. As a result, now SO2 emissions
decreased by more than 50 % compared to 1980. Of course, this was possible
largely due to transition of Europe to the use of Russian gas.
It should be mentioned that along with the formation of acid rains, sulfur
compounds directly affect a decrease of the greenhouse effect. For instance, sulfate
ion has an opposite effect on a change of air temperature compared to CO2 and,
hence, reduces the effect of climate warming. Photochemistry of sulfur cycle has
two the most important reactions:
• reaction from source gases to SO2, and
• reactions leading from SO2 to H2SO4.
The global sulfur cycle consists of the mosaic structure of local ﬂuxes of its
compounds with other elements formed due to water migration and atmospheric
processes. It is schematically shown in Figs. 1.42 and 1.43. The conceptual schemes
of the global and regional cycles of sulfur have been described in detail by many
authors (Nitu et al. 2000b; Krapivin and Varotsos 2008). However, the existing
Fig. 1.42 Principal scheme of global sulfur cycle (http://www.enviroliteracy.org)
1.6
Block Schemes of Models for Biogeochemical Cycles
83

models have been developed for autonomous functioning and usage, which makes
is difﬁcult to include them into the global model without substantial changes in their
parametric space. The model of the global sulfur cycle proposed here has been
derived in the form of a unit with inputs and outputs, which enables one to match it
with other units of the global model via their inputs and outputs.
In contrast to hydrogen, sulfur compounds cannot be attributed to long-lived
elements of the biosphere. For example, the living time of sulfur oxide in the
atmosphere does not exceed 15 days. Therefore in the unit of sulfur the spatial
digitization of its natural and anthropogenic reservoirs should be planned to reﬂect
the local distributions of sulfur in the vicinity of its sources and to enable us to
estimate the intensities of the inter-regional ﬂuxes of sulfur compounds.
Analysis of schemes of global sulfur cycle represented in Figs. 1.41 and 1.42
shows that the quantitative estimate of different natural processes involved in the
global sulfur cycle appears much more complicated. It is evidently there is rela-
tionship between general biological processes of the sulfur cycle and some reac-
tions of the carbon cycle. Existing data about these relationships and other
parameters of global sulfur cycle give a possibility to form principal scheme of the
MGBS unit of the BCSS global model (Fig. 1.44).
1.6.6 Conceptual Schemes of Global Phosphorus Cycle
The phosphorus cycle is one of the slowest biogeochemical cycles that describe the
movement of phosphorus through the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere.
Unlike other biogeochemical cycles, the atmosphere does not play a signiﬁcant role

in the movement of phosphorus. In contrast to nitrogen, the main reservoir of
phosphorus in the biosphere is not the atmosphere but the rocks and other deposits
formed in the past geological epochs, which, being subject to erosion, emit phos-
phates. Besides, there are other mechanisms of the return of phosphorus to the
biospheric cycle, but, as a rule, they are not that efﬁcient. One of these mechanisms is
ﬁsh catching, returning to land from the hydrosphere about 60 × 103 t P/year, as well
as an extraction of phosphorus-containing rocks estimated at 1–2 × 106 t P/year. The
present cycle of phosphorus is closed by its ﬂuxes to the bottom deposits in the
World Ocean to which it gets with sewage, as well as with the coast and river run-off.
Schematic diagrams of global phosphorus cycle are represented in Figs. 1.45 and
1.46. They reﬂect main processes of phosphorus in the environment:
• phosphorus is an essential nutrient for plants and animals which use of it to build
nuclei acid, phosphorus bilayer, and adenosine triphosphate;
• phosphorus minerals are used to build strong bones and teeth;
• phosphorus comes from dead organic matter and from the weathering/erosion of
phosphates from rocks; and
• plants get it from the soil and animals get it from eating plants.

1.7 Models of Global Biogeochemical Cycles
1.7.1 Key Aspects of Global Biogeochemical Cycles
Key aspects of global biogeochemical cycles were discussed by Krapivin and
Varotsos (2008). Global model of the biosphere/climate/society system is basic unit
of the GIMS that parameterizes main biogeochemical cycles providing boundary
information conditions for RIMS. Figures 1.30, 1.35, 1.38, 1.43 and 1.45 give a
possibility to write balance equations for each biogeochemical cycle.
Fundamental connections between characteristics of the biological state of the
environment, such as biodiversity in ecosystems, the state and dynamics of food
chains, and interactions of the biosystem with the cycle of biogenic elements have
been poorly studied, both in land and water ecosystems. Among numerous ques-
tions appearing in studies of the global biogeochemical processes the following are
of key importance:
(1) What physical, biological, chemical and social processes are the basic ones in
regulation of the cycles of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, water and other elements
both in space and in time?
• What mathematical relations are determinants in the parameterization of
biological processes in the computer models of biogeochemical cycles?
• What are dependences between biodiversity, stricture of ecological chains,
and biogeochemical cycles in land and water ecosystems?
• What processes are determinants in the transport of biogenic salts and
pollutants in space in general and between various ecosystems, in
particular?
• What are mechanisms that relate one biogeochemical cycle to another, and
do general principles of parameterization of these relations exist or they
depend on the type of chemical elements and ecosystems under
consideration?
(2) What are forms and ways of anthropogenic interference to global biogeo-
chemical cycles?
• How do humans inﬂuence the biogeochemical cycles, change their rates
and spatial distributions of chemical elements, forming inputs and outputs
of numerical models, and what are consequences of this interference?
• How does a change in the land use strategy affect the re-distribution of
chemical elements in space and in time?
• What anthropogenic pollutants are important for the biogeochemical
inﬂuence on ecosystems and how to predict them?
1.7
Models of Global Biogeochemical Cycles
87

(3) What mechanisms control the ability of ecosystems to rapidly restore and what
are indicators that reﬂect this ability of ecosystems?
• How do an introduction of new species to ecosystems and an appearance of
new unstudied diseases affect the development of biogeochemical cycles in
land and water ecosystems?
• What feedbacks between ecosystems and climate are critical and how these
feedbacks are parameterized in computer models?
• Can the data on the past biogeochemical cycles be used for their prediction
in the future?
• What basic parameters and characteristics of ecosystems affect their ability
to restore after anthropogenic forcings?
The interactions of biogeochemical cycles inﬂuence and maintain our climate
system. Land use and fossil fuel emissions are currently impacting the biogeo-
chemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur on land, in the atmosphere, and in
the oceans (Schulze et al. 2001). Our understanding of biogeochemical cycles is
directly related to the research and analyses that are brought to them, and to the
methods that are used. Jacobson (2000) notes that the study of cycles as a model for
the earth’s changing climate has become a new science. Earth Systems Science is
the basis for understanding all aspects of anthropogenic global change, such as
chemically forced global climate change. Earth Systems Science is an integrated
discipline that has been rapidly developing over the last two decades.
Biogeochemical cycles are characterized by the variety of pathways which are
passed by chemical elements. Ecosystems have many biogeochemical cycles
operating as a part of the global or regional system, for example the water cycle, the
carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle, etc. All chemical elements occurring in organisms
are part of biogeochemical cycles. In addition to being a part of living organisms,
these chemical elements also cycle through abiotic factors of ecosystems such as
water (hydrosphere), land (lithosphere), and/or the air (atmosphere). All of this
performs the biogeochemical cycle modeling as very ambiguous task.
1.7.2 The Carbon Cycle Modeling
The carbon cycle is the biogeochemical cycle by which carbon is exchanged among
the biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere of the Earth.
Figures 1.23, 1.24, 1.25, 1.26, 1.27, 1.28 and 1.29 present a diversity of possible
scheme for modeling.
Considering the notations in Fig. 1.30, the balance equations to describe the
global carbon cycle are written as:

The ﬂux QU is formed from HC

where σOP and σL are the areas of the water basins ΞOP and ΞL, respectively; Ξ is
the biosphere area, ΞO is the World Ocean area.
Fluxes HC
i are described in Krapivin and Varotsos (2008). In particular, main
signiﬁcance is given to the HC
3 ﬂux of CO2 dissolved in the upper layer of the ocean
that can be calculated by the formula

pa
p
=ð1 þ 0:5CSÞ
where ψ(TL) is the function of the effect of temperature on CO2 solubility, CS is the
water salinity. An expression of the ψ function has been studied inadequately.
There are only some experimental estimates (Alekseev et al. 1992). Of course, a lot
of simpliﬁed approaches to the determination of the direction of CO2 ﬂuxes on the
atmosphere-ocean border prevail here. In a simplest case, the ﬂuxes HC
2 and HC
3 can
be considered as mutually exclusive. That is, a valve is supposed to exist on the
atmosphere-ocean border. Its switching is determined by the pH parameter. A
critical level of pH is about 8.11. At pH ≤8.11 the ocean assimilates CO2, and at
pH > 8.11 the ocean emits CO2.
The MGBC item of the BCSS global model is correlated with the MGBO,
MGBN, MGBP and MGBS items. Each of them is described by the system of
1.7

differential equations that reﬂect the balance relationships between corresponding
reservoirs. For example, oxygen and ozone cycles depend on the photosynthesis
both in oceans and on the land.
1.7.3 Nitrogen Cycle Modeling
A comparative analysis of the model schemes of the ﬂux diagrams of nitrogen
compounds in nature proposed by various experts makes it possible to construct a
block-scheme presented in Fig. 1.35. Here the atmosphere, soil, lithosphere, and
hydrosphere are considered as nitrogen reservoirs. Three ﬁrst reservoirs are
described by 2-D models, and the hydrosphere is described by a 3-D multi-layer
model. The characteristics of nitrogen ﬂuxes between these reservoirs are given in
Table 1.11. The equations of the model are written as

To simplify the calculation scheme presented in the diagram in Fig. 1.35,
advective processes in the equations of the MGBN item can be described by a
superposition of the ﬂuxes HN
14 and HN
15. The computer realization of the equations of
the MGBN item introduces into the equations of the MGBN item some corrections
for the agreement between the dimensionalities of the variables in conformity with
the spatial digitization of Ξ. Therefore the estimates of the ﬂuxes HN
i given below for
their consideration in the MGBN should be corrected following this criterion.
Different versions of the MGBN unit of the BCSS model can be synthesized
depending on the parameterization of ﬂuxes HN
i . Krapivin and Varotsos (2008) the
ﬂux HN
16 of nitrogen ﬁxed in the atmosphere over any ocean basin described by the
relationship:
HN
16 ¼ ½k1ðh1ÞDT þ k2RWNA;
where ΔT is the atmospheric temperature variation, θ1 is the indicator of the tem-
perature dependence of the rate of atmospheric ﬁxation of nitrogen, RW is precip-
itation, λ1 and λ2 are the coefﬁcients.
The equation of atmospheric ﬁxation over a land site Ξij is written by analogy to
HN
16:
HN
8;ij ¼ ½k3ðh1ÞDT þ k4RW;ijNA;
where λ3 and λ4 are coefﬁcients.
To estimate the coefﬁcients λi (i = 1, …, 4), as a ﬁrst approximation one can
use average data on nitrogen ﬂuxes and precipitation. If we assume HN
16 ¼
9:96  103 t km2 year1; HN
8 ¼ 0:027 t km2 year1, estimate local precipita-
tion over the ocean and land at 1.01 and 0.24 m year−1, respectively, and the
convective precipitation over the ocean and land at 0.19 and 0.116 m year−1,
respectively, we obtain λ1 = 0.00498, λ2 = 0.00458, λ3 = 0.0135, and λ4 = 0.0285.
These estimates are easily speciﬁed with account of local data at a ﬁxed time
moment for smaller regions and water bodies.
The ﬂux of nitrogen HN
1 is determined by the geothermal activity of the Earth. Its
estimates testify to a necessity of consideration of this constituent in the global
model. In particular, for instance, in the nitrogen fumaroles of Vesuvius the content
of nitrogen by weight constitutes 98 %, in gases of the lavas of the Hawaiian
volcanoes there are only 5.7 % of nitrogen, and over the globe an input of juvenile
nitrogen averages 0.4 × 106 t year−1. Let HN
1 be a function of time approximating a
statistical series of observations. A more strict account of this ﬂux of nitrogen in the
model can be realized by using the algorithms of parameterization of random
processes, for instance, with the use of the evolutionary modeling. However, within
the global model, orientated toward describing the processes in time steps of
decades, it is enough to use average annual data.

The ﬂux HN
1 can be, to some extent, interpreted as a compensation for the ﬂuxes
HN
13 and HN
21.
The nitrogen supplies on land consist of the assimilable nitrogen in soil
NS2 ≈0.19 × 104 t km−2, in plants (12 × 109 t), and living organisms (0.2 × 109 t). A
diversity of nitrogen ﬂuxes is formed here of the processes of nitrifucation, deni-
triﬁcation, ammoniﬁcation, ﬁxation, and river run-off. The intensities of these ﬂuxes
depend on climatic conditions, temperature regime, moistening, as well as chemical
and physical properties of soil. Many qualitative and quantitative characteristics of
these dependences have been described in the literature (Hellebrand et al. 2003).
Let us consider some of them.
Nitriﬁcation is the biological oxidation of ammonia with oxygen into nitrite
followed by the oxidation of these nitrites into nitrates. Nitriﬁcation is an important
step in the nitrogen cycle in soil. Nitriﬁcation involves the oxidation of nitrogen by
specialized bacteria (Nitrosomonas, Nitrobacter, etc.). The return of nitrogen to the
cycle due to living micro-organisms is one of the stabilizing natural processes.
Simplifying the whole process of the transformation of ammonia salts into nitrates,
present the activity of heterotrophic micro-organisms and saprophags as a gen-
eralized process of the organic matter decomposition. The rate of the organic matter
decomposition and nitriﬁcation increases with an increasing temperature, reaching
its optimal value at Ta = 34.5 °C. Therefore for the ﬂux HN
3 an approximation
HN
3 ¼ kN jMj can be assumed, where Mκ is the rate of the dying-off of the com-
ponent κ, λNκ is the content of nitrogen in the component κ.
Denitriﬁcation process exists in anoxic environments when nitrate and nitrite act

on land are important
channels of the input of nitrogen into the atmosphere. The intensity of these pro-
cesses depends on temperature, humidity, pollution of soils with poisonous
chemicals, and pH. The quantitative and functional characteristics of these de-
pendences have been well studied. Within the global model it is possible to take
into account only the factors of temperature and humidity:
HN
7 ¼ k6hDT
2 WS
NS
k1 þ NS
;
where WS is soil moisture, θ2 is the temperature coefﬁcient, λ6 and k1 are empirical
parameters. If we assume HN
7 ¼ 0:318 t/km2=year, then λ6 = 0.496, k1 = 0.556.
In the biological cycle of nitrogen of importance are the processes of its ﬁxation
by microorganisms and plants whose intensity is estimated at 148 × 106 t year−1.
The rate of ﬁxation, depending on the character of the medium, can vary reaching
3 × 109 t year−1 in highly productive regions. The nitrogen ﬂux HN
10 depends on the
distribution
of

described
by
the
equation
HN
10 ¼ rjkjRj=rij, where σκ is the area under vegetation of the κ type on the
territory Ξij of the area σij, Rκ is the productivity of plants of the κ type, λκ is the
coefﬁcient.

Information-Modeling Technology for the Environmental Monitoring

Fixation of nitrogen by plants directly from the soil via the root systems (ﬂux
HN
6 ) occupies a principle place in the cycle of nitrogen, especially on the territories
with cultural vegetation. For instance, an increase of the share of legumes in
agriculture can raise HN
6 up to 35 t km−2 year−1. Therefore a consideration of this
ﬂux in the model is necessary and can be realized in the following form:
HN
6 ¼ rjRjlj=rij
where μκ is the constant.
The rate of assimilation of nitrogen by the roots of plants is known to depend
much on the soil temperature regime, decreasing a little with the temperature
lowering to 8–10 °C and dropping at temperatures below 5–6 °C. The motion of
nitrogen from the roots to the upper parts of the plants slows down, too. The
formula for HN
6 reﬂects this regularity through the respective reactions of the plants’
productivity with the time lag neglected.
On land, plants assimilate annually about 30 × 106 t N from the atmosphere and
more than 5.3 × 106 t N directly from the soil. Approximate estimates of the
productivity of various types of vegetation average Rκ = 710–3243 t km−2 year−1.
Hence, we have μκ = 0.134 × 10−5 to 0.506 × 10−4.
On global scales, the ways of nitrogen migration include the transport of its
compounds between land and oceans due to water run-off. The annual input of
nitrogen from land into the World Ocean is estimated at 38.6 × 106 t. If the total
sink to the ocean from land is described by the function WSO, then the nitrogen ﬂux
HN
11 can be approximated by the expression
HN
11 ¼ kNNS2 1  exp kNWSO
ð
Þ
½
;
where λN and kN are the coefﬁcients. The functional form foresees that the nitrogen
ﬂux from land to the ocean is equal to zero in the absence of the run-off and its
stabilization at a level λN, with the run-off volume considerably increasing. To
estimate the parameters λN and kN, it is necessary to take into account the spatial
heterogeneity of the types of soil-vegetation formations, relief, and other geo-
physical parameters. In particular, the content of nitrogen compounds in water
differs as a function of the run-off territory. The river waters in the forest regions
with the temperate climate contain 0.4 mg ‘−1 of nitrates, for the arid climate this
value is 1.45 mg ‘−1. The concentration of nitrates increases sharply in drainage
waters of the irrigation systems (5.5 mg ‘−1), in the river waters of thickly popu-
lated regions (25 mg ‘−1), and reaches a maximum in the soil solutions of the salted
irrigates soils (200 mg ‘−1). Ground waters contain from 10 to 100 mg ‘−1 of
nitrates. The total run-off of water into the World Ocean reaches 50 × 103 km3,
30 % of which being the underground run-off, hence, the total ﬂux of nitrogen per
unit area of the ocean will be 0.107 t year−1. Assuming WSO = 0.337 m and that a
95 % level of the sink saturation is reached at a ﬁvefold increase of WSO, we obtain
kN = 1.367, λN = 0.708.

The surface part of the nitrogen cycle contains a constant process of removal of
nitrogen from the biosphere into deposits, in particular, as a result of accumulation
of saltpetre on the Earth surface through erosion and alkalifying. From the available
estimates, HN

23. This relationship follows from the fact that during the geological period
the loss of nitrogen had been balanced by its input. Of course, in the present
biosphere, with the changing intensity of most of the ﬂuxes enumerated in
Table 1.11, this balance has started breaking due to increasing ﬂuxes HN
9 and HN
19.
Finally, one should mention the fact that in connection with the persistent C/N
ratio for different types of soils and climatic zones for nitrogen ﬂuxes it is important
to ﬁnd correlations between factors of biogeochemical cycles’ regulation on a
regional level. Quite special here are arid regions where soils are poor in micro-
organisms, and the regime of moisture cycle is determined by division into dry and
wet seasons. In this connection, Austin et al. (2004) shown that the episodic nature
of water availability in arid and semiarid ecosystems has signiﬁcant consequences
on belowground carbon and nutrient cycling. Pulsed water events directly control
the C/N of microbially available substrate. A level of this control depends on the
spatial and temporal heterogeneity of vegetation cover, topographic position and
soil texture. Seasonal distribution of water pulses ﬁnally lead to the change in
biogeochemical cycling in water-limited ecosystems. Schematic outline of bio-
geochemical cycles of C and N in arid and semiarid ecosystems under dry season,
and after a rainfall pulse is given in Fig. 1.33.
In the seawater, nitrogen is present in the form of dissolved gas, ions of
ammonium NH4þ, nitrite NO2, nitrate NO3, and in the form of various organic
compounds. Inorganic nitrogen compounds are assimilated by algae and phyto-
plankton and thus transfer into organic forms that serve as food for living organ-
isms. An expenditure of inorganic nitrogen supplies is compensated by atmospheric
precipitation, river run-off, and mineralization of organic remains in the process of
the living organisms functioning and dying-off. According to Ivanov (1978),
nitrogen ﬂuxes in sea water can be schematically shown in Fig. 1.35. Of course, not
all nitrogen ﬂuxes available in nature have been taken into account. A diversity of
the ways of nitrogen transformation in water has been studied inadequately, though
the available information is sufﬁcient for the global model. The processes, such as
replenishing the nitrogen supplies in water due to lysis of detritus and functioning
of living organisms, the nitrogen exchange between photic and deep layers of the
ocean, as well as nitrogen ﬁxation at photosynthesis and denitriﬁcation, have been
thoroughly studied and described in literature. Also, there are rough estimates of
nitrogen supplies in the ocean, according to which one can assume, on the average,
that NU = NP = 0.77 × 104 t km−2 and NL = NF = 105 t km−2. More detailed spatial
distributions of nitrogen supplies in the hydrosphere can be calculated from the data
on biomass, dissolved organic matter, and concentration of dissolved oxygen. The
volume relationships of dissolved nitrogen are related to the volume of oxygen as
m‘ N2/l = 1.06 + 1.63 m‘ O2/l.

The nitrogen supplies in water bodies are replenished due to bacterial decom-
position of organic sediments and dissolved organic matter. Consider the compo-
nent D denoting the content of dead organic matter in the water medium. On its
basis, one can write the following relationship: HN
18 ¼ kDDðu; k; z; tÞ, where λD is
the indicator of the nitrogen content and the rate of detritus lysis. The free nitrogen
supplies in the water medium are also replenished in the process of functioning of
various organisms. With account of phytoplankton Φ and nekton r, we have:
HN
4 ¼ HN
r þ HN
U;
HN
r ¼ krTr;
HN
U ¼ kUTU;
where Tr and TΦ are the characteristics of metabolic processes, respectively, in
nekton and phytoplankton, λr and λΦ are the coefﬁcients. To determine the averages
of these coefﬁcients, assume Tr ¼ 0:194 t km2 year1; TU ¼ 0:125 t km2 year1;
HN
r ¼ HN
U ¼ 0:83  103 t km2 year1. Then λr = 0.00428, λΦ = 0.00664.
The process of denitriﬁcation in the water medium delivers considerable
amounts of nitrogen into the atmosphere: HN
20 ¼ k5ðh2ÞDTNUðu; k; z; tÞ, where λ5
and θ2 are the constants.
The biological ﬁxation of nitrogen in the water medium constitutes about
10 × 106 t year−1, reaching 20.7 × 106 t year−1 in the photic layer of the ocean, and
(36–1,800) × 104 t km−3 year−1 in small lakes. For the World Ocean, HN
17 ¼ 0:0277
t km2 year1, on the average. Assuming HN
17 ¼ kR RU, where RΦ is the phyto-
plankton produce averaging 168.8 t km−2 year−1, we obtain λR = 0.164 × 10−3.
The characteristic feature of the nitrogen cycle in the water medium is its
transport due to gravitational sedimentation, vertical convection, turbulent diffu-
sion, and convergence. The processes of nitrogen transport by migrating animals
are almost negligible and can be neglected in the global model. The simplest form
of description of the vertical ﬂuxes of nitrogen is reduced to the model
HN
14 ¼ kjDNj; HN
15 ¼ kqDNq, where κ = (U, P, L), ρ = (P, L, F).
The present contribution of human activity to the general biospheric cycle of
nitrogen has reached a level when the consequences of the introduced changes
become unpredictable and probably rather catastrophic. The epidemiological
studies testify to the growth of respiration diseases on the territories with high
concentrations of nitrogen and sulfur oxides as well as photochemical oxidizers.
The harmful effect of nitrogen oxides on living organisms starts manifesting itself
when the level 940 m kg m−3 is exceeded. In general, the consequences of the
nitrogen pollution of the biosphere are more complicated. For instance, on the one
hand, the technogenic accumulation of nitrogen from the atmosphere at fertilizer
production plays a positive role by raising the productivity of land and water
ecosystems, and on the other hand, it causes an undesirable eutrophication of water
basins. Removal of nitrogen from the atmosphere for industrial and agricultural
needs is compensated for by a technogenic input of nitrogen into the atmosphere
with the burning of solid and liquid fuel. A considerable share is contributed here
by the transport emitting nitrogen oxides reaching, for instance, in the USA,
11.7 × 106 t year−1. However, even an observance of this physical equilibrium
1.7

cannot substitute for the chemico-biological balance. Therefore in this multi-
functional hierarchical set of global ﬂuxes of nitrogen, the most vulnerable knots
and bonds should be revealed, which is only possible within a well-planned
numerical experiment.
Preliminary estimates of an increasing anthropogenic pressure on the nitrogen
ﬂuxes between the biospheric elements suggest a hypothesis about a strong cor-

expenditure RMG, anthropogenic input of nitrogen into the atmosphere HN
19, and
intensity of emissions of general pollutions ZVG. The quantitative characteristics of
the factors of these dependences can be obtained from the known trends. From
some estimates, an amount of nitrogen oxides emitted into the atmosphere is pro-
portional to the weight of the used fuel with a 4 % annual increasing trend. The
scales of the industrial ﬁxation of nitrogen for the last 40 years increased by a factor
of 5, reaching a value that could have been ﬁxed by every ecosystem on the Earth
before the use of the present agricultural technology. In 1968 the global industry
gave about 30 × 106 t of ﬁxed nitrogen and in 2000 this value reached 1 billion.
Formalize these correlations as the following models:
HN
9 ¼ min UðKÞGðK; tÞ; NArK=r
f
g; HN
2 ¼ kAGRMG; HN
19 ¼ kGAZVG
where K is the number of an economic region, G is the average population density
of the K region, σK is the area of the K region. The coefﬁcients U, λAG, and λGA are
determined from analysis of available information about the processes in (4.27). If we
assume that HN
2 ¼ 0:154 t km2 year1; HN
19 ¼ 0:102 t km2 year1 and HN
9 ¼
0:283 t km2 year1, then at G ¼ 24:4 men km2; RMG ¼ 30:5 oil units km−2
year−1, and ZVG = 3.39 t km−2 year−1, we obtain U = 0.283, λAG = 0.504 × 10−2, and
λGA = 0.03.
1.7.4 Oxygen and Ozone Cycles Modeling
If we denote by RΦ(φ, λ, t) and Rκ(φ, λ, t) the produce of phytoplankton Φ and land
surface of the κ type at the Earth surface point (φ, λ) at a time moment t, then the
oxygen ﬂuxes to the hydrosphere and from land to the atmosphere can be described
by relationships:
HO
1 ¼ aURU HO
2 ¼ ajRj HO
21 ¼ aSRU
where the coefﬁcients aΦ, aκ, and aS depend on phytoplankton species and the type
of vegetation. For their averaging we use the data on the ﬂuxes: HO
1 ¼
140 t O2 km2 year1,
HO
2 ¼ 70 t O2 km2 year1,
HO
2 ¼ 600 t O2 km2 year1,
RΦ = 401.3 t km−2 year−1, Rκ = 102.4 t km−2 year−1. Then aΦ = 0.35, aκ = 0.68,
96

Information-Modeling Technology for the Environmental Monitoring

aS = 1.49. Of course, these estimates have a considerable spatial and temporal
scatter. In particular, using the data on the productivity of some oceans, we obtain
the values of the coefﬁcient aΦ: the Atlantic Ocean—0.53; the Indian Ocean—0.25;
the Arctic Ocean—11.1; the Paciﬁc Ocean—0.64.
Apart from photosynthesis, photolysis can be a source of oxygen in the atmo-
sphere, that is, the decomposition of water vapour under the inﬂuence of UV
radiation in the upper layers of the atmosphere. However, the intensity of this
source in the present conditions is negligible. Nevertheless, denote this ﬂux by
HO
3 ¼ aHWA, where WA is the water vapour content in the atmosphere, aH is the
empirical coefﬁcient. If we assume that in the upper layers of the atmosphere a
constant share of WA can reside, then at HO
3 ¼ 0:0039 t O2 km2 year1 and
WA = 0.025 m, we have aH = 1.56 × 10−7 per year.
Vernadsky (1944) considered rocks metamorphism, basaltic volcanism, and
underground radioactive waters as possible sources of oxygen. However, there are
no sufﬁciently reliable estimates of these ﬂuxes and therefore it is impossible to
parameterize them.
The oxidation process both on land and in the water medium is the basic con-
sumer of oxygen on the Earth. The ability of oxygen to react with many elements of
the Earth crust forms the ﬂuxes of oxygen leaving the biospheric reservoirs. The
balance between the income-and-expenditure ﬂuxes of oxygen has been reached in
the course of the biospheric evolution.
Oxygen is spent on respiration of plants, animals, humans, and on the dead
organic matter decomposition both in the hydrosphere and on land. To parameterize
the income parts of the oxygen balance, linear models are used in MGBO unit.
Atmospheric ozone constitutes 0.64 × 10−6 of the atmospheric mass and belongs
to optically active gases. It absorbs UV solar radiation in the range 200–300 nm,
strongly affecting thereby the thermal regime of the stratosphere. Besides, ozone
has a number of vibration-rotation bands of absorption in the IR spectral region
(9.57 μm) and partially absorbs visible radiation in the Chappuis band (0.6 μm).
The formation and destruction of ozone have been described in detail (Kondratyev
and Varotsos 2000).
Ozone forms in the upper stratosphere from molecular oxygen under the inﬂu-
ence of UV solar radiation. In the lower stratosphere and troposphere, the source of
ozone is the decomposition of nitrogen dioxide under the inﬂuence of UV and
visible radiation. The formation of the vertical proﬁle of the ozone concentration is
connected with its meridional and vertical transports. The general characteristic of
this proﬁle is the total amount of ozone measured by the thickness of its layer in the
Dobson units (1DU = 0.001 cm).
Ozone was ﬁrst measured in the mid-19th century. At that time, a maximum of
ozone, for instance, over Europe and in the region of Great Lakes varied within
17–23 ppbv. At present, the ozone layer over western regions of North America in
April–October is characterized by quantities 30 ± 5 ppbv. Due to a rapid economic
growth of many Asiatic regions followed by increased volumes of consumed fossil
fuels and respective increase of NOx and SO2 emissions (5 % per year, on the
1.7
Models of Global Biogeochemical Cycles
97

average), there is an increasing trend of monthly mean ozone concentration by 2–6
ppbv per year with the rate preserved till 2013. This is despite the attempts
undertaken in Europe and North America on reduction of emissions to the atmo-
sphere of chemical compounds by 8–10 %. Therefore local measures on the ozone
layer stabilization on a global scale have no prospects.
The ozone destruction is a complex set of photochemical reactions with par-
ticipation of the compounds of hydrogen, nitrogen, and chlorine. From the available
estimates, 50–70 % of ozone are destructed by nitrogen compounds, 20–30 %—by
oxygen O, 10–20 %—by water-containing particles of HOx, and less that 1 %—by
chlorine compounds. The prevailing role of nitrogen compounds in ozone
destruction has been conﬁrmed for all latitudes. The equation of photochemical
equilibrium between concentrations of ozone and nitrogen oxides is [NO] · [O3]/
[NO2] = μ, where the equilibrium constant μ depends on the solar radiation intensity
and can range from 0 to 0.02.
There are various approaches to a parameterization of the process of formation
and destruction of the ozone layer. The complexity of derivation of the dynamic
models of the ozone cycle in the atmosphere is connected with its participation in
more than 75 chemical reactions, a qualitative and quantitative description of which
is impossible without deriving detailed models of numerous minor gas components
of the atmosphere. Nevertheless, there are empirical models of the ozone layer,
which make it possible, in the present climatic situation, to obtain adequate spatial
distributions of ozone. For instance, Bekoriukov and Fedorov (1987) derived a
simple empirical model of the total ozone content conﬁrmed by the observation data
for the Southern Hemisphere:

where Pn
m are non-normalized spherical functions of the n degree, of the m order,
an,m and an,-m are the empirical coefﬁcients whose values are given in Bekoryukov
and Fedorov (1987) and in Krapivin and Kondratyev (2002).
There are also static models to describe the vertical proﬁle of the ozone density
distribution. One of such models is the Kruger formula:
O3 h
ð Þ ¼ 51:4 exp  h  40
ð
Þ=4:2
½

MjC=M3

:
With the combined use of static and prognostic models it is possible to predict
the levels of O3 concentration on a real time scale. But in this case it is necessary to
describe the photochemical reactions with other components of the atmosphere and,
to a greater extent, NO2 taken into account (Agirre-Basurko et al. 2006). Other
models of ozone have been reviewed by Kondratyev and Varostos (2000).
The simplest dynamic model of the ozone layer can be written in the form of a
balance equation that reﬂects its income-expenditure components. The ozone
supplies are replenished due to the impact of UV radiation on oxygen

a rate HO
14 ¼ O3=T3, where T3 is the lifetime of ozone molecules depending on
atmospheric pollution: T3 ¼ TO
3  e1B. The lifetime TO
3 of the ozone molecules in a
perfect atmosphere averages 50–60 days. Nitrogen oxides participating in the
contrary to HO
12 cycle of ozone destruction contribute much to the magnitude of B.
Studies of the history of biospheric evolution reveal a close correlation between
the oxygen production intensity and the development of life on Earth. And although
the expected relative oscillations of the oxygen concentration in the near future do
not exceed 10 %, the considered impacts on the biosphere do not cover all potential
anthropogenic trends, and therefore cannot be considered reliable. Therefore let us
analyze the constituents of possible mechanisms for violation of the natural balance
of oxygen. Naturally, our concern is for not only an increase but also a decrease of
the oxygen content in the atmosphere.
The oxygen cycle is complicated by its ability to take part in a lot of chemical
reactions giving a multitude of epicycles. This fact makes the oxygen cycle sufﬁ-
ciently stable but hinders an assessment of its stability.
Anthropogenic forcing on numerous epicycles of oxygen manifests itself both
directly through its involvement in other cycles of substances at fuel burning and
production of various materials, and indirectly through environmental pollution and
biospheric destruction. Therefore a parameterization of the anthropogenic impact on
the oxygen balance is realized within other units of the global model. The ﬂux HO
18
taken into account in the scheme in Fig. 1.38 completely covers direst consumption
of oxygen both in industry and in agriculture. Assume HO
18 ¼ y1RMG, where RMG is
the rate of the natural resourcesexpenditure, and y1 is the coefﬁcient (≈0.084).
The ﬂuxes HO
15 and HO
16 are strongly affected by anthropogenic forcings. Their
variations are caused by discharges of high-temperature industrial sewage con-
taining considerable amounts of oxidizers as well as by the oil-polluted water
bodies. The quantitative characteristics of the change of oxygen dissolved in water
as a function of temperature have been studied comprehensively. The empirical
formula to calculate the concentration of the seawater dissolved oxygen has the
form (Ramad 1981): [O2 dissolved] = 80/(0.2TO −7.1), where [O2] is expressed in
mg/‘, TO in °C. The estimates of oxygen solubility in water are well known
(Krapivin and Kondratyev 2002).
The ﬂuxes HO
9 and HO
19, balancing in natural conditions the oxygen ﬂuxes into
the water medium, at an anthropogenic forcing increase, as a rule, due to more
active aerobic bacteria and increasing metabolic needs of animals. For instance, a
10 °C increase of water temperatureincreases the oxygen expenditure on respiration
of marine animals by a factor of 2.2.
One of the negative manifestations of the anthropogenic impact on the oxygen
cycle is a depletion of the ozone layer, especially marked in the polar regions. There
are various hypotheses on the causes of sharply changing concentrations of ozone,
as well as discussions on the so-called “ozone hole” over the Antarctic. The main
cause of all violations is connected with the progressing human activity accom-
panied by the growing volumes of long-lived components emitted to the atmo-
sphere (e.g., freons). The consequences of these violations are very serious, and the
1.7
Models of Global Biogeochemical Cycles
99

real scales of danger threatening the life on the Earth can be estimated only with the
use of the global model of the nature-society system.
A diversity of the anthropogenic impacts on the global biogeochemical cycle of
oxygen is determined by direct and indirect causes of breaking the natural balance
of oxygen. According to the equation of photosynthesis, the gram-molecular
amounts of assimilated CO2 and emitted O2 are equal. Also equal are the gram-
molecular amounts of assimilated O2 and emitted CO2 for the dead organic matter
decomposition and fuel burning. Hence, for time periods of tens and hundreds of
years, a change of the CO2 amount in the atmosphere is accompanied by the same
change of O2, but in the opposite direction. For instance, a CO2 doubling in the
atmosphere leads to a decrease of the amount of O2. But, since the volume con-
centration of CO2 in the atmosphere is now estimated at 0.031 %, and that of O2 at
20.946 %, in this case a decrease of O2 will constitute only 0.15 % of the total O2
content in the atmosphere.
Imagine the following situation. Let the total biomass of the biosphere
(*9.6 × 1011 t C), all organic matter of soil (*14 × 1011 t C), and all fossil chemical
fuel, the explored supplies of which constitute 128 × 1011 t of conditional fuel
(64 × 1011 t C) be burnt. Then the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere increases by a
factor of 12.5, and that of O2, respectively, decreases but only by 1.75 %. Hence, the
amount of oxygen during hundreds of years has to be practically constant.
However, it should be borne in mind that the region of excess anthropogenic
emissions of CO2 and, hence, O2 assimilation is concentrated on a small area of
cities and forest ﬁres. Since the concentrations in the atmosphere do not equalize
instantly, a gradient of O2 concentrations can appear around these sites, when the
oxygen provision will be insufﬁcient for animals and humans. Therefore the model
of the global oxygen cycle (MGBO unit) reﬂecting the spatial heterogeneities in the
distributions of O2 concentrations, enables one to reveal such dangerous territories.
An interaction between the cycles of oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, and
carbon manifests itself through the processes of oxidation and decomposition. The
level of detailing the global model units does not permit one to reﬂect all the diversity
of these processes. Therefore in the simplest case, when only averaged characteristics
of the oxygen cycle elements are taken into account, the scheme in Fig. 1.38 of the
global O2 ﬂuxes can be presented as the schemes in Figs. 1.36 and 1.37. The indicated
stability of the O2 concentration in the atmosphere makes it possible to simplify a
description of the MGBO unit, using a single balance equation:

where k0 and kL are the indicators of the rate of O2 emission due to photosynthesis
in the ocean and on land, respectively, νs is the indicator of the role of respiration of
land vegetation (s = L), animals (s = F), and humans (s = G) in the removal of
oxygen from the atmosphere, μQ is the rate of O2 consumption at the decomposition
of the soil dead organic matter.

1.7.5 Global Methane Budget Modeling
Methane is produced and released from a range of natural and human sources main of
which are shown in Figs. 1.39 and 1.40. Understanding the Earth’s methane cycle is a
necessary step for evaluating the effectiveness of emission reduction schemes,
detecting changes in biological sources and sinks that are inﬂuenced by climate
feedbacks, and predicting, and perhaps mitigating, future methane emissions.
According to Bazhin (2000), the ﬂux F1
CH4 (Fig. 1.39) in every water basin with
a vertical stratiform structure forms in an active layer beneath the water layer.
Practically, all aqua-geo-systems have such a structure. The layer, where methane
forms, has two areas. In the bottom area located at a depth h, methane has the form
of bubbles. Above this layer, due to diffusion, the concentration of methane
decreases, and the bubbles disappear. Let us denote as DCH4ðzÞ the coefﬁcient of
methane diffusion at a depth z, then the stationary behaviour of the whole system
shown in Fig. 1.39 is described by the equation:
d
dz DCH4ðzÞ d
dz MðzÞ


 FCH4ðzÞ þ F1
CH4 þ F2
CH4 ¼ 0
Model calculations and ﬁeld measurements performed by Bazhin (2000), show,
for instance, that on the rice ﬁelds hb = 1.3 m, FCH4 ¼ 1:31:7
ð
Þ  1012
mol cm3 s1. According to Khalil et al. (2000), the rice ﬁelds play a signiﬁcant role in
the gas balance of the atmosphere due to emissions of CH4, CO, N2O, H2, and CHCl3.
For instance, in China the rice ﬁelds deliver these gases to the atmosphere at the
following rates (mg/m2 h): CH4—900 ÷ 50,000; CO—80–100; H2—5–30; N2O—
50–1,000; CHCl—1–8. A wide scatter of these estimates is explained by highly
unstable ﬂuxes of these gases due to the rice growing technology. For instance, the use
of sulphates on the rice ﬁelds increases emissions of methane by 12.0–58.9 %
depending on other characteristics of these ﬁelds (Liping et al. 2000).
Thus an estimation of the ﬂux F1
CH4 as a function of a given territory with account
of natural and anthropogenic processes taking place there requires ﬁrst of all a
detailed inventory of methane sources as well as natural and anthropogenic systems
functioning on this territory. Examples of such an inventory given above serve the
basis for development of studies in this direction.
The dynamics of the CH4 content HA in the atmosphere can be parameterized by
a simple balance relationship:
@HA
@t þ Vu
@HA
@u þ Vk
@HA
@k ¼ F1
CH4ðt; u; k; NÞ  HAðt; u; kÞ
sH
where Ξ is the identiﬁer of the type of the natural or technogenic system.
On the whole, the ﬂuxes of methane in the environment are rather diverse. The
scheme in Fig. 1.39 and data in Fig. 1.40 reﬂect, to some extent, this diversity.

1.7.6 Global Sulfur Cycle Modeling
Modeling of global sulfur cycle is particularly needed in connection with acid rains.
There are numerous models that are parameterized global sulfur cycle taking into
consideration of different hypotheses and assumptions concerning the chemistry and
transport components. One of the known global models for the sulfur cycle is
STOCHEM-Ed model (Collins et al. 1998). It is 3-D Lagrangian chemistry-transport
model. Stevenson et al. (2003) studied modiﬁed STOCHEM-Ed model taking into
consideration of the volcanic component. It was shown that:
• volcanic emissions constitute 10 % of the global SO2 source to the atmosphere,
but from 26 % of the SO2 burden, and 14 % of the sulfate aerosol burden; and
• volcanic SO2 dominates large regions of the free troposphere, particularly in the
tropics.
The version of the sulfur unit proposed here, in contrast to the known hydro-
dynamic models of the long-distance transport, takes into account the ﬂuxes of
sulfur compounds between the hydrosphere, atmosphere, soil, and biota. The model
does not consider the vertical stratiﬁcation of the atmosphere. The characteristics of
sulfur ﬂuxes averaged vertically are calculated for both the land and ocean (Fasham
2003; Zaikov et al. 1991; Zlatev et al. 1992). The spatial digitization of the bio-
sphere and the World Ocean corresponds to the criterion inherent to the global
model. The elements of the block-scheme of the model of the biogeochemical cycle
of sulfur are described in Tables 1.16 and 1.17. This scheme is realized in every cell
Ωij of the Earth’s surface and in every compartment Ωijk of the World Ocean.
Interaction between the cells and compartments is organized through the climate
unit of the global model. Therefore the equations of the sulfur unit lack the terms
reﬂecting the dynamic patter of the spatial transformation of the sulfur reservoirs.
With notations assumed in Tables 1.16 and 1.17 taken into account, the equations
describing the balance relationships between the reservoirs of sulfur compounds
will be written in the form:

The equations of the MGBS item in each cell of the spatial division of the ocean
surface are supplemented with initial conditions (Table 1.17). The calculation
procedure to estimate the sulfur concentration consists of two stages. At each time
moment ti, ﬁrst for all cells Ξij, the equations of the MGBS item are solved by the
method of quasi-linearization, and all reservoirs of sulfur are estimated for
ti+1 = ti + Δt, where a time step Δt is chosen from the condition of convergence of
the calculation procedure. Then at the moment ti+1 with the use of the climate unit
of the global model these estimates are speciﬁed with account of the atmospheric
transport and ocean currents over the time Δt.
The sulfur supplies in the reservoirs are measured in mg S m−3, the sulfur ﬂuxes
have the dimensionality mg S m−3 day−1. The sulfur supplies in the water medium
are calculated with the volumes of the compartments Ωijk taken into account. To
estimate the sulfur supplies in the atmosphere, it is assumed that an effective
thickness of the atmosphere h is an input parameter either introduced into the model
by the user or prescribed as the constants from Table 1.17, or received from the
climate unit of the global model. The quantitative estimates of the ﬂuxes in the
right-hand parts of the equations are obtained in different units of the global model.
The anthropogenic ﬂuxes of sulfur H1, H6, C2, C6, and C10 are simulated in the unit
of scenarios. The ﬂuxes H3, H5, H9, C1, C5, and C20 are prescribed either by the
climate unit or formed in the unit of scenarios. The accuracy of different functional
presentations of the ﬂuxes in the equations of the MGBS item corresponds to the
accuracy of similar ﬂuxes of the biogeochemical cycles of hydrogen, phosphorus,
and nitrogen. The rate of emission of H2S into the atmosphere at humus

decomposition is described by the linear function C3 = μ1(pH) · SO4L · TL, where
μ1 is the proportion coefﬁcient depending on soil acidity, day−1 K−1; TL is the soil
temperature, °K. The initial value of SO4L is estimated proceeding from the humus
supply considering that the content of sulfur in humus is prescribed by the
parameter ag, %. According to the available observations of the input of H2S into
the atmosphere from the ocean, the ﬂux H4 varies widely from low values to high
values at the transition from the stagnant waters to zones of upwellings. The ﬂux H4
is assumed to be the function of the ratio of the rates of H2S oxidation in the photic
layer to the rate of the vertical uplifting of water. Therefore to describe the H4 ﬂux,
use the parameter tH2SU, which reﬂects the life-time of H2S in the water medium:
H4 = H2SU/tH2SU. Determine the value of tH2SU as a function of the rate of the
vertical advection vz and concentration of oxygen O2 in the upper layer ZH2S thick:
tH2SU = H2SOU · vz(θ2 + O2)/[O2(θ1 + vz)], where the constants θ1 and θ2 are
determined empirically, the value of O2 is either calculated by the oxygen unit of
the global model or prescribed from the global database.
The reaction of oxidation of H2S to SO2 in the atmosphere, on land, and over the
water surface is characterized by a rapid process of the reaction of hydrogen sulphide
with atomic and molecular oxygen. At the same time, the reaction of H2S with O3 in
the gas phase is slow. It is impossible to describe within the global model the
diversity of the situations appearing here, however, an inclusion of the ﬂuxes H2 and
C4 into the unit of sulfur enabled one to take into account the correlation between the
cycles of sulfur and oxygen. These ﬂuxes are parameterized with the use of the
indicator tH2SA of the life-time of H2S in the atmosphere: C4 = AH2 SL/tH2SA,
H2 = AH2SO/tH2SA. The mechanism to remove SO2 from the atmosphere is described
by the ﬂuxes H7, H8, H27, C7, C8, and C9. Schematically this mechanism consists of a
set of interconnected reactions of SO2 with atomic oxygen under the inﬂuence of
various catalysts. A study of the succession of reaction enables one to estimate the
life-time of SO2 for oxidation over land tSO2L and water surface tSO2A1. This makes it
possible to assume the following parameterizations of the ﬂuxes H8 and C9:
H8 = ASO2O/tSO2A1, C9 = ASO2L/tSO2L.
Sulfur dioxide is assimilated from the atmosphere by rocks, vegetation, and
other Earth’s covers. Over the water surface this assimilation is connected with the
intensity of turbulent gas ﬂuxes and surface roughness. We describe a dry depo-
sition of SO2 over the vegetation by the model C7 = q2RX, where q2 ¼

(calculated by the biogeocenotic unit of the global model); q′2 is the proportion
coefﬁcient. The parameters rtl and rs are functions of the types of the soil-vegetation
formations and estimated, respectively, at 0.05 and 4.5 for the forests, 0.9 and 3 for
grass cover, 0.5 and 2 for bushes, 0.8 and 1 for bare soils, 1.9 and 0 for water
surfaces, 2 and 10 for snow cover.
The process of washing-out of SO2 from the atmosphere with changing phase to

the function: C8 = q1lW · ASO2L with the Langmuir coefﬁcient (Mon et al. 2006) q1l
and precipitation intensity W(φ, λ, t). An interaction of the acid rain with the Earth
surface elements is reﬂected by the ﬂuxes C18, C21, and C22 for land and H25, H26,
and H27 for water surface. To parameterize these ﬂuxes, assume the hypothesis that
the reservoirs of H2SO4L and H2SO4O are spent in proportion to the out-ﬂuxes, and
the coefﬁcients of this proportion are the controlling parameters of the numerical
experiments: C18 = h1 · H2SO4L, C22 = h2 · RX · H2SO4L, C21 = h3Ta · H2SO4L,
H25 = h6 H2SO4O, H26 = h4Ta H2SO4O, H27 = h5 · RFI · H2SO4O, h1 + h2 · RX +
h3Ta = 1, h4Ta + h5 · RFI + h6 = 1, where Ta(φ, λ, t) is the air surface temperature.
Parameterize the ﬂuxes H7 and H24 by the relationships: H7 = ASO2O/tSO2A2,
H24 = q1lW · ASO2O, where tSO2A2 is the life-time of SO2 over the water surface.
Sulphates interacting with the ecosystems and establishing an interaction of the
sulfur cycle with other biogeochemical processes are one of the most important
elements in the global cycle of sulfur. Numerous complicated transformations of
sulphates in the environment are described by a set of ﬂuxes H7, H8, H10, H11, H12,
C9, C11, C12, C13 for the atmospheric reservoir and the ﬂuxes H13, H18, H19, H20,
H22, C3, C14, C15, C16 for land and the World Ocean.
Physical mechanisms for the transport of sulphates from the atmosphere to the
soil and water medium are connected with dry and wet sedimentation. An efﬁcient
model of the wet removal of particles and gases from the atmosphere was proposed
by Langmann (2000): a substitution of the mechanism of the aerosols and gases by
a simpliﬁed binary model enables one to match it with other units of the global
model: H10 = μW · ASO4O, H11 = ρvO · ASO4O, C11 = b3W · ASO4L,
C12 = d1va · ASO4L, where vO and va are the rates of the aerosols dry deposition
over the water surface and land, respectively; μ, b3, ρ, and d1 are the constants.
The return of sulphates from the soil and water medium to the atmosphere is
connected with rock weathering and spray above the rough water surface:
C13 = d2 · RATE · SO4L, H12 = θ · RATE · SO4U, where RATE (φ, λ, t) is the wind
speed over the surface, m/s; d2 and θ are the empirical coefﬁcients.
The ﬂux C14 relates the surface and water reservoirs of sulfur. Let σ be the share
of the river system area on land and d3—the proportion coefﬁcient, then
C14 = d3W · SO4L + (C11 + C12)σ. The surface part of the sulfur cycle is connected
with the functioning of the system atmosphere-vegetation-soil. Plants adsorb sulfur
from the atmosphere in the form of SO2 (ﬂuxes C7 and C22) and assimilate sulfur
from the soil in the form of SO42 (ﬂux C15). In the hierarchy of the soil processes
two levels can be selected deﬁning the sulfur reservoirs as “dead organics” and
“SO42 in soil”. The transitions between them are described by the ﬂux
C16 = b2STL, where the coefﬁcient b2 = b2,1b2,2 reﬂects the rate b2,1 of transition of
sulfur contained in dead organics into the form assimilated by vegetation The
coefﬁcient b2,2 indicated the content of sulfur in dead plants.
The ﬂuxes of sulfur in the water medium according to studies by Bodenbender
et al. (1999), depend on the biological processes in the water bodies and constitute
an isolated part of the global cycle of sulfur that contains only the ﬂuxes that
1.7

107

connect it with the atmospheric and surface cycles. Rough estimates show that the rates
of the sulfur cycle in the water of the seas and oceans do not play a substantial role for
the remaining parts of its global cycle. And though this speciﬁc feature does exist, for
the purity of the numerical experiment, in the proposed model the internal hydrospheric
ﬂuxes of sulfur compounds are separated in space and parameterized with the same
details like other ﬂuxes of sulfur in the atmosphere and on land. This excessiveness is
important for other units of the global model as well. In particular, it is important for the
parameterization of photosynthesis whose rate RFI affects the closure of other bio-
geochemical cycles. Finally, assume: H13 = γ · RFI, H14 = b · MFI, H15 = f · DU,
H16 = p · DD, H17 = q · DD, H18 = H2SOD/tH2SOD, H19 = u · SO4D, H20 = a1vD · SO4D,
H21 = b1vD · H2SOD, H22 = H2SOU/tH2SOU, H23 = g · DU, where MFI is the mass of
dead phytoplankton, tH2SOU and tH2SOD is the time of complete oxidation of H2S in the
sea water in the photic and deep layers, respectively; γ, b, f, p, q, u, a1, b1, and g are the
constants.
The anthropogenic input to the sulfur unit is realized through the prescribed
ﬂuxes C2, C6, C10, H1, and H6 in the form of the functions of the spatial coordinates
and time.

Determine now the functional and dynamic characteristics of the ﬂuxes of
phosphorus (Table 1.18) based on analysis of the existing ideas about their nature.
The atmospheric cycle is governed by rock weathering, volcanic eruptions, and by
washing-out of phosphorus by precipitation. From the available estimates, the
phosphorus content in the lithosphere constitutes 0.093 %, and the processes of
weathering deliver annually into the atmosphere about 0.2 × 106 t P, on the average.
Since these processes are of a complicated stochastic nature and their models are
absent, in the ﬁrst approximation the ﬂuxes HP
1 and HP
19 will be considered constant.
The continental cycle of phosphorus is determined by ten ﬂuxes (Fig. 1.45)
closed by a single component PS indicating the phosphorus supplies on land in the
soil-vegetation formations and in animals. The supplies of phosphorus in soils are

1.8 Climate Unit of the Global Model
The climatic component of the GIMS is the greatest difﬁculty in the synthesis of the
global model, because it is characterized by a lot of feedbacks, most of which being
unstable. Among them are such as ice-albedo, water vapour-radiation, cloudiness-
radiation, aerosol-radiation, and many others. The functioning of the Earth climatic
system is determined by the state of the atmosphere, oceans, cryosphere, surface of
the continents with land biota, lakes, rivers, ground waters, and various anthro-
pogenic structures. Therefore the construction of the model of climate requires a
consideration of numerous factors, whose role in its formation in many cases has
been studied inadequately. So far, attempts to derive a numerical model of the Earth
climatic system have not given the results that could be used in the GIMS. Also, it
is not safe to say that a realization of the GCP plans will clarify the problem. But
without a parameterization of climate the questions concerning the problem of the
greenhouse effect will remain unanswered.
There are two approaches to the synthesis of the climatic system. One approach
is based on inclusion of biospheric components into the existing climate models or
in those under development. The other approach consists in the development of a
unit within the numerical model of the biosphere, which would simulate depen-
dences of biospheric components on climate parameters. In the former case,
problems appear of unstable solutions of the respective systems of differential
equations, which make it difﬁcult to predict global environmental changes. In the
latter case there is a possibility to obtain steady prognostic estimates of the envi-
ronmental changes, but their reliability depends on the accuracy of parameterization
of correlations between the elements of climate and the biosphere. The second
approach is preferable, because it permits one to combine the climate models,
which can be described on the level of scenario, with the numerical model of the
biosphere. A detailed analysis of the problems of climate modeling and assessment
of the present state of the problems can be found in Kondratyev et al. (2004a).
Some models of individual components of the BCSS, which correspond to the
second approach, are discussed here. Among them are models of the atmospheric
general circulation, atmosphere-ocean interaction, sensitivity of climate parameters
to boundary conditions on the Earth’s surface, interaction of biogeochemical and
climatic processes, and others.
The climatic system is a physical-chemical-biological system with unlimited
degrees of freedom. Therefore, any attempts to model this complex system are
connected with serious difﬁculties. This explains a diversity of parametric descrip-
tions of some processes in this system. For the global model with a time step of
digitization up to 1 year, the use of two versions can be acceptable. The ﬁrst version
consists in a combined use of correlations between particular processes of the for-
mation of the climatic situation on a given territory together with the climate sce-
narios. The second version is based on the use of the global monitoring data, which
are the basis for the formation of data series about climatic parameters with their
territorial and temporal attachment and used to retrieve a complete pattern of their
1.8

spatial distribution. One of the widespread correlation functions is the dependence of
variations of average temperature ΔT of the atmosphere on the CO2 content in it:
DT ¼

n 	 1;
5:25n2 þ 12:55n  7:3;
n\1

ð1:8Þ
where ξ is the ratio between the present content of CO2 in the atmosphere Ca(t) and
its pre-industrial level Ca(1850).
As seen from (1.8), T is an increasing function of the amount of atmospheric
CO2. A 20 % increase of CO2 in the atmosphere raises the temperature by 0.3 °C. A
doubling of atmospheric CO2 causes an increase of T by 1.3 °C. A detailed analysis
of the function (1.8) and a comparison of the observed combined variations of
ΔT and ξ show that the use of the model (1.8) makes it possible to simplify the
climate unit of the global model. In particular, if ðDTÞ2½CO2 is calculated by (1.8)
with a doubled concentration of atmospheric CO2, then to assess the present trends
in changes of Tg the following formula can be used:
DT ¼ ðDTÞ2½CO2lnn=ln2 ;
ð1:9Þ
where, from the assumed estimates, the pre-industrial value of Ca(1850) = 270 ppm.
The formula (1.9) satisfactorily approximates the known data with an error of about
50 %. It follows from (1.9) with Ca(1980) = 338 ppm that ΔT = 1.3 °K, whereas a
real warming is estimated by many authors at 0.6 °K.
Of course, the results of the recent discussions on the greenhouse effect
in
connection with the growth of the CO2 partial pressure in the terrestrial atmosphere
should be reﬂected in GIMS. The formula (1.9) takes into account the impact of
CO2. According to Mintzer (1987), there is a possibility to broaden a consideration
of the temperature effect of other greenhouse gases:

The value of to is identiﬁed with the year 1980, when the GHG concentrations
were known. To calculate DTCO2, one can use a more accurate formula by Krapivin
(1993).
Among simple formulas of calculations of the latitudinal distribution of average
temperature over the globe one can indicate the schemes proposed by Sergin
(1974):

TN,min(TS,min) and TN,max(TS,max) are minimum and maximum temperatures at the
North (South) Pole, respectively, °C; tΔ is the duration of the year in units of

authors use the estimates TN,min = −30 °C, TN,max = 0 °C, TS,min = −50 °C, TS,
max = −10 °C, Te = 28 °C.
Of course, these zonally averaged temperatures scatter widely, which leads to
considerable errors. To more accurate reﬂect the role of various factors in changes
of the basic climatic parameter—temperature, it is necessary to calculate the con-
tribution of each factor separately. This can be done with an assumed additivity of
the role of feedbacks: ΔTa,ﬁnal = ΔTa + ΔTa,feedback. In some models authors
introduce the feedback coefﬁcient β: ΔTa,ﬁnal = β · ΔTa. The β parameter is
expressed through the ampliﬁcation index g: β = 1/(1 −g). The value of the g index
is equivalent to albedo α, which on a global scale is a function of Ta. This
dependence can be roughly approximated by the formula

Here Tice and Tfree are average planetary temperatures at which the whole surface
of the Earth is ice-covered or ice-free, respectively; b is the coefﬁcient of transition
between critical conditions of the Earth’s albedo. Usually it is assumed that
Tice ∈[263, 283] °K.
Simple and rough climate models can be speciﬁed through account of the
characteristic times of feedbacks functioning. Some estimates of the time of
establishing the equilibrium states in the interaction of climate sub-systems are
given in Table 1.19. The lag time of reactions within BCSS varies widely, and its
consideration is necessary when assessing the consequences of changes within one
or several climate sub-systems. In particular, the supplies of cold in the Antarctic
ice sheet are so huge that to raise its temperature to 0 °C, the average temperature of
the World Ocean should be lowered by 2 °C, that is, to obtain To = 3.7 °C instead of
To = 5.7 °C. With account of the data in Table 1.19, it will take hundreds of years to
reach it. The observed rate of the anthropogenic climate warming does not dispose
of such energy supplies.
The mechanism of the anthropogenic impact on the climate system is manifested
through GHG emissions, albedo change due to reconstruction of the Earth’s covers,
interference into water cycle, and atmospheric pollution. Aerosol particles with the
radius 10−7 ± 10−2 cm are observed almost at all altitudes of the atmosphere.
Particles of non-anthropogenic origin get to the atmosphere from land or ocean
surface and result from in-situ chemical reactions. Particles of anthropogenic origin
result mainly from fuel burning. Table 1.20 gives an idea about relationships
between these ﬂuxes of particles into the atmosphere.

The mechanism of the effect of particles on atmospheric temperature is explained
by that solar radiation coming to the Earth, mainly within the range 0.4–4 μm, is
partially reﬂected and absorbed by them. The global albedo of the surface-atmo-
sphere system varies, too. Besides, the particles affect the processes of moisture
condensation in the atmosphere, since clouds, rain, and snow form with their
participation. Take the heat balance equation of the system “surface-atmosphere”:
ð1  aÞ E

where Ts is the average efﬁcient temperature of the system’s emission, close to the
temperature of the average energy level near the surface 400 mb, E

0:487 cal/cm2=min is the mean-hemispherical intensity of the incoming solar
radiation; α is albedo; σ = 8.14 × 10−11 cal/cm2/min is the Stefan-Boltzmann
constant, Ea is total intensity of the anthropogenic sources of energy per unit
surface.
Let albedo α = αo −Δα, where αo = 0.35 is the albedo in present conditions, Δα
is a small part of albedo determined by the impact of anthropogenic aerosols. From
the Eq. (1.11) we obtain an expression for temperature:

It follows from Eq. (1.13) that the temperature at not so strong anthropogenic
impacts is the sum of the terms describing the bonds in the system “surface-

Note that the contribution of T1 in present conditions is very small. Assuming
that Ea = 4 × 10−5 cal/cm2 min and, hence, Ea=E
o ¼ 8:21  104, then
T1 = 0.0079 °C. Thus the direct impact of the global energy on the atmospheric
average temperature is now negligible. It follows from the expression for T1 that to
raise the atmospheric temperature by 0.5 °C due to thermal emissions, the condition
Ea=E
o ¼ 0:0052 should be satisﬁed, and this means an increase of anthropogenic
heat ﬂuxes to the environment by a factor of 63.4. This is equivalent to energy
release at the annual burning of 570 × 109 t of conventional fuel.
If we assume that the energy production is proportional to the size of population,
then T1 ¼ 96:046kTGGrS=E
o, where G is the population density, men/km2; σS is
the land area, km2; kTG is the per capita amount of produced energy, cal/min.
If we neglect the impact of aerosol on the atmospheric thermal regime, then the
direct radiation E, its change dE and the change of atmospheric turbidity dB will be
related as: dE/E = −kBdB, where kB = 0.1154 km2/t is the proportion coefﬁcient, B is
the amount of anthropogenic aerosols, t/km2. After integrating this equation, we

Since the average emission of anthropogenic aerosols is estimated by many
authors at 300 × 106 t/year, and the average period of the aerosols residence in the
atmosphere is estimated at 3 weeks, 17.262 × 106 tons of particles, on the average,

reside in the atmosphere. In this case it follows from the formula for T2 that the
atmospheric temperature should decrease by 0.84 °C/year.
Some experts, instead of the index β, consider the factor of atmospheric turbidity
BT, deﬁning it as a ratio of the coefﬁcient of attenuation of solar energy in the real
atmosphere αr to the coefﬁcient of attenuation in an ideal atmosphere αI:
BT = αr/αI = (αI + αW −αA)/αI, where αW and αA are the coefﬁcients of attenuation
by water vapor and by aerosols, respectively. The following estimates are assumed
in GIMS:
BT ¼

3:5 in tropical latitudes;
2:0 at reduced contents of dust and water vapour:

An experience of the global climate modeling testiﬁes to the fact that the desire of
many experts to accurately and completely take into account all possible feedbacks
and compounds of the climate system leads to complicated mathematical problems,
the solution of which a huge amount of data is needed, and in most cases the solutions
of the respective equations turn out to be unstable. Therefore, the use of these
complicated models as a unit of the global model of the GIMS, leads to a negative
result, that is, to impossibility to construct an efﬁcient model. The most encouraging
approach is to combine the climate models with the data of global monitoring. The
scheme of this combination is very simple. The existing surface and satellite systems
of monitoring the climate-forming processes cover some part of the cells {Ξij} of the
Earth surface. Over these cells, measurements are made of temperature, cloudiness,
water vapor content, aerosols and gases, albedo, and various parameters of energy
ﬂuxes. Use of simple climate models and of methods of spatial and temporal inter-
polations enables one to reconstruct, based on these measurements, a complete
pattern of distribution of climatic parameters over the whole territory Ξ.
1.9 Conclusion
Main idea of global information-modeling technology was proposed by Krapivin
et al. (1982). First versions of the GIMS were successfully tested in Former USSR
(Russia, Moldova, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan), where different applied tasks were
solved (Krapivin and Phillips 2001a; Chukhlantsev et al. 2004; Krapivin et al.
2007c; Krapivin and Shutko 2012; Shutko et al. 2010):
• earlier detection of the forest ﬁre isolated areas;
• monitoring of surface soil moisture in the interests of agriculture;
• determination of depth to a shallow water table (down to 2 m in humid areas and
down to 3–5 m in arid/dry areas); and
• assessment of underground moistening level.

During last years the GIMS was successfully tested and applied in many
countries in the World including Bulgaria, Poland, Hungary, Vietnam, Cuba, USA
and Holland (Krapivin and Shutko 2012). It has been proven that the advantages of
GIMS application consist ﬁrst of all in the following capabilities:
• contours of water seepage through hydrotechnical constructions (levees, dams,
destroyed drainage systems, different kinds of leaks);
• biomass of vegetation above a water surface or wet ground;
• increase in temperature in land, forested and volcano areas;
• changes in salinity/mineralization and temperature of a water surface;
• water surface pollution, oil slicks on a water surface;
• on-ground snow melting; and
• ice on a water surface and on the roads, runways.
Thus, the GIMS provides remote sensing, on-ground (in situ) samplings, using
GIS-information and mathematical modeling of physics-chemical processes in
selected areas. GIMS-technology can effectively be applied for solving many
agricultural, hydrological, environmental and many other Earth related problems. In
common, GIMS-technology solves numerous environmental tasks that GIS tech-
nology struggles with, such as:
• The study of environmental processes and systems that change quickly and are
unstable.
• Assessing the ecosystems in regions where monitoring systems do not exist.
• Optimization of the environmental monitoring systems.
• Reconstruction of spatial image of the system basing on the restricted
information.
• Revealing the characteristic features of the environmental system evolution.

Remote-Sensing Technologies and Data
Processing Algorithms
2.1 Remote Sensing Methods
Remote sensing of the land covers, atmosphere and World Ocean aquatories is
based on the registration of background or reﬂected and scattered electromagnetic
radiation. Such knowledge is necessary to get data about the properties of envi-
ronmental elements as it explains the dependence of thermal emission on its own
physical and geothermal parameters. Also the scattering mechanisms and active
radiation reﬂection are functions of these parameters (Borodin 2008; Bui Ta Long
1998; Shutko et al. 1994, 2010; Krapivin and Shutko 2002, 2012; Petty 1995;
Schimel 1995; Golovachev et al. 2004; Cheremisin 2013; Savinikh et al. 2007).
The waves (or frequencies) of electromagnetic emission used for remote sensing
in environmental monitoring systems occupy a wide spectrum from 0.3 μm to 1.3 m
and cover the subranges: near ultraviolet (0.3–0.4 μm), visible (0.4–0.76 μm), near
infrared (IR: 0.76–1.5 μm), middle and far IR (1.5 μm–1 mm), super high frequency
(SHF: 1 mm–1.3 m). The SHF-range is divided into three basic subranges: milli-
meters (1–10 mm), centimeters (1–10 cm), and decimeters (10–130 dm). Two sub-
ranges called usually as L-band (15.8–63 cm) and P-band (63–100 cm) are used by
many authors.
The real range choosed for objective study of the environment has to take on
board many conditions such as the absorption and scattering of electromagnetic
waves by the Earth’s atmosphere and its interactions with the Earth’s land covers
and water surfaces. The atmosphere is an extremely limiting factor when choosing a
working range for remote monitoring. For instance, the P-band can used for abyssal
sensing from the ﬂying laboratories, but its application in satellite monitoring
systems is beset with problems because the ionosphere acts as a screen. A similar
situation is found with ultraviolet radiation which is intensively absorbed by
atmospheric gases. In order words, there is a question about the atmosphere clarity
for speciﬁc wavelengths. For example, some wavelengths in the IR and submilli-
meter ranges are intensively absorbed by water vapor which practically precludes

them from consideration as remote-sensing tools. Clouds have a powerful effect on
light radiation and create obstacles to land surface observation from space over
many territories (Klyuev 2000; Justice et al. 1995; Grankov 1994; Asrar and Dozier
1994).
Knowledge of the atmosphere admitting function in the given synoptical and
geographical conditions is the key task under the synthesis of the remote monitoring
system. As a rule this task is solved during the realization of measurements. For
this, one or several channels use waves that are relatively powerfully absorbed or
are dispersed by different atmosphere components; these are added to the basic
channels. The content of relative component is determined by the effect of these
waves relaxation on the various latitudes (or the integrated content, depending on
the task). The measurement results correction is introduced by the basic channels
using these additional data.
The speciﬁed physical special features of the environment remote sensing are
inherent to the super high frequence and ultra short waves ranges which are the
foundation of the radiometric geoinformation monitoring systems. These systems
allowed the many tasks involved in operative identiﬁcation of natural phenomena to
be solved and new methods and technologies for remote diagnosis of natural and
natural/technogenic systems to be developed.
Microwave methods can be conditionally divided into two classes: active and
passive. The methods that study the character of the reﬂection, scattering and
absorption of the waves emitted by the source with known spectral density are
deﬁned as active. The optical range includes such sources: the Sun, lasers and other
light emitters. Active methods used widely in radiolocation systems are in the radio
range. The power of reﬂected and dispersed radiation, its spectral composition and
polarization characteristics, phase and propagation time are the study objects in this
case.
Passive methods are based on the heat emission analysis of natural formations.
The fact that thermal emission is determined by substance temperature and its
physical parameters is taken into account here. That is why passive methods are
used for the temperature measurement and for the determination of different
environmental parameters. These measurements are effective particularly under
multi-channel sensing co-ordinated with the data processing algorithms (Sarkisyan
2000; Sellers et al. 1996; Krapivin and Mkrtchyan 1991; Bondur et al. 2010;
Krapivin et al. 2010a, b).
Let us now move on and consider the speciﬁc features of radiophysical methods
(i.e., those in which the radio waves are used). Basic attention is here concentrated
on the SHF-range since namely this range is applied in the remote sensing systems
located on ﬂy-laboratories and satellites (Kondratyev 2000a; Kondratyev et al.
1990a; Krapivin and Phillips 2001; Shutko et al. 2010). Microwave radiometer
systems are used intensively on numerous satellites. These systems secure the
operative control of more then twenty basic geophysical parameters forming
weather and climatic processes (Bondur et al. 2009).
Main speciﬁc features of radiometric methods are connected with high radio-
clearness of the atmosphere. It is one of its advantage in comparison with optical
120

and infrared methods. The possibility of the letters is restricted mainly by absorbing
and dispersing qualities of the atmosphere. The main problem here is cloud which is
opaque in these wavelengths and, hence, the receipt of necessary data about the
environment state is prevented. This makes it difﬁcult to obtain operative data when
such tasks as the diagnosis of extraordinary and disastrous natural or technogenic
anomalies need to be solved. Certainly, the use of devices of optical and infrared
ranges is possible only in the regions with small cloudiness. Hence, main advantage
of radiophysical methods for the remote monitoring is its all-weatherness. Never-
theless, there are still problems here, which scientists from many countries are
addressing. For example, the absorption line of water vapors exists for λ = 1.35 cm,
and the oxygen absorption zone effects for λ = 0.5 cm.
Radio waves can penetrate under the vegetation cover canopy and into the soil
layer depth. That is why the use of radiophysical methods allow to assess the
vegetation and soil state and to deﬁne many its properties (Krapivin 2000b;
Krapivin et al. 1998b; Metternicht 1998; Burkov and Krapivin 2009; Krapivin and
Vilkova 1990).
The remote sensing topics cover many theoretical and experimental investiga-
tions of the most current specializations within the ﬁelds of geoscience, ecology,
radiophysics, biochemistry, oceanology, applied mathematics, cybernetics, clima-
tology, and other sciences (Klyuev 2000; Grankov and Milshin 2004, 2010;
Haarbrink et al. 2011). This chapter mainly considers the role played by the
microwave range in the measurement of environmental parameters. It consists in
development and experimental validation of the high-precision remote sensing
methods with aim:
(1) to study natural and anthropogenic processes,
(2) to establish relationships between atmospheric, ionospheric and surface
phenomena,
(3) to ﬁnd the long-scale changes connected with climatic, meteorological, seis-
mological and human activity,
(4) to investigate the ﬁeld of microwave and optical remote sensing for detection
of areas of water seepage through irrigation constructions, levees and dykes
and for revealing of areas with dangerously high groundwater level, and
(5) to develop a synergetic remote sensing technology for raised groundwater and
seepage detection by using jointly spectral microwave and optical approach.
This chapter describes an experience in the remote sensing of the Earth from
space. This experience allows obtaining the radio holographic data base for
establishing regular and statistical relationships describing inﬂuence of the natural
and anthropogenic factors on the ionosphere, atmosphere, and developing the
adaptive models for simulation of the greenhouse effect.
Existing experience in remote sensing is characterized by different applications.
For example, remote sensing methods for the land surface monitoring given pos-
sibility to introduce series of indices that help to solve numerous tasks:
2.1
Remote Sensing Methods
121

(1) NDVI—Normalized Difference Vegetation Index is an index of plant
“greenness” or photosynthetic activity, and is one of the most commonly used
vegetation indices.
(2) EVI—Enhanced Vegetation Index was speciﬁcally developed to:
• be more sensitive to changes in areas having high biomass (a serious
shortcoming of NDVI),
• reduce the inﬂuence of atmospheric conditions on vegetation index values,
and
• correct for canopy background signals.
EVI tends to be more sensitive to plant canopy differences like leaf area index
(LAI), canopy structure, and plant phenology and stress than does NDVI
which generally responds just to the amount of chlorophyll present.
(3) SAVI—Soil-adjusted Vegetation Index was developed as a modiﬁcation of the
NDVI to correct for the inﬂuence of soil brightness when vegetative cover is
low
(4) MSAVI—Modiﬁed Soil-adjusted Vegetation Index is soil adjusted vegetation
indices that seeks to address some of the limitation of NDVI when applied to
areas with a high degree of exposed soil surface.
(5) SATVI—Soil-adjusted Total Vegetation Index is a modiﬁcation of several
earlier vegetation indices that correlates with the amount of green and
senescent vegetation present on the ground.
(6) Microwave Vegetation Index (MVI) uses microwave readings from two dif-
ferent frequencies to determine the cover of vegetation. Each of these different
frequencies has the ability to penetrate vegetation canopyto a different degree,
and the relative different in reﬂectance between these two can be interepreted
to give an index of vegetation cover.
(7) Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) was deﬁned to highlight areas that have burned
and to index the severity of a burn using Landsat TM imagery.
(8) Biological Crust Index uses a unique feature of the phycobilin pigment found
in cyanobacterial soil crusts, resulting in a relatively higher reﬂectance in the
blue spectral region compared to soil without cyanobacteria.
(9) Burned Area Reﬂectance Classiﬁcation (BARC) is a method using remotely
sensed data to assess the severity of ﬁre damage to vegetated areas developed
by the US Forest Service and US Geological Survey.
Remote sensing methods widely penetrate to other areas. The fundamental task
that is subject of many studies consists in development and experimental validation
of the high-precision methods and algorithms for restoration of the time-spatial
distribution of the physical parameters of the atmosphere, ionosphere and the
Earth’s surface using the radio ﬁelds measured on some interface or curve in space
(radio hologram). Radio hologram can be registered using small satellite in space or
an airplane in the atmosphere. Application of the satellite radio holography for
global geophysical monitoring is justiﬁed by existence of the space radio systems
122

Remote-Sensing Technologies and Data Processing Algorithms

designed for radio navigation, radio communication and other civilian tasks. Many
of these radio systems are emitting permanently radio signals having high coher-
ence and stability properties. This allows one to develop radio holographic methods
that can be realized with help of the high stability and coherence of the radio signals
of the space radio systems. The radio holographic analysis of the satellite radio
holograms can be used as a tool for elaborating the data base containing important
geophysical information on the global scale with aim to reveal natural and
anthropogenic processes, to establish relationships between atmospheric, iono-
spheric and surface phenomena and to ﬁnd the long-scale changes connected with
climatic, meteorological, seismological and human activity. The database can be
elaborated by means of radio holographic processing of the radio holograms reg-
istered by exiting and future satellite missions (e.g. Mir, GPS/MET, CHAMP,
SAC-C radio occultation experiments). The next fundamental and practical prob-
lems are needed to solve:
1. Elaborating the radio holographic methods for high-precision determination of
the spatial distribution of the physical parameters of the atmosphere, ionosphere
and the Earth’s surface.
2. Development of the database for global geophysical monitoring of the physical
parameters of the atmosphere, ionosphere and the Earth’s surface using radio
holograms registered by low orbital satellites.
3. Analysis of the elaborated data base with aim to ﬁnd the radio-physical
parameters that are sensitive to long-scale changes in the state of the atmo-
sphere, ionosphere and the Earth’s surface.
4. Elaboration of the radio holographic technology for bistatic radiolocation of the
atmospheric boundary layer and the terrestrial surfaces. The aims of this tech-
nology are:
• to determine the humidity and the vertical gradients of the refractivity in the
boundary layer of the atmosphere; and
• to measure parameters of the terrestrial surfaces (wind roughness and long-
scale waves in the oceans, ice distribution in the polar regions).
Elaboration of the polarimetric and interferometer methods for studying physical
parameters of the land surfaces: the electric permittivity, conductivity, soil mois-
ture, foliage parameters and the long-scale relief changes connected with seismic
and anthropogenic activity. Elaboration of the database of the global geophysical
monitoring of the Earth’s surface and the atmospheric boundary layer by means of
the processing of the radio holograms registered by MIR, GPS/MET, CHAMP,
SAC-C missions.
5. Investigation of the ionospheric effects of the natural and anthropogenic pro-
cesses by means of analysis of the radio holograms registered on the commu-
nication line satellite-satellite and Earth-satellite.
6. Modeling the greenhouse effect by means of the analysis of the developed
global geophysical database.

The experience of elaborating the theory of the radio holographic investigation
of Earth and its gas-plasma environment from space was described in publications
by Liou et al. (2003, 2010), Pavelyev et al. (2002, 2003, 2010).
Positive scientiﬁc results are achieved owing to the combined use of remote
sensing and ecoinformatics tools. With the global effect of climate change, ecoin-
formatics is an emerging drench of research where new techniques, tools and
infrastructure are being developed to enable more in-depth study of processes in the
nature/society system with effective employment of scientiﬁc data collection
instruments such as sensors, satellites, scientiﬁc experiments and simulations. As
Myers and Atkinson (2008) remark, ecoinformatics is the combination of multiple
environmental datasets and modeling tools used to test ecological hypotheses and
derive information.
2.2 Remote Sensing Techniques
Remote sensing is the observation and measurement of objects from a distance, i.e.
instruments or recorders are not in direct contact with objects under investigation.
Remote sensing depends upon measuring some kind of energy that is emitted,
transmitted, or reﬂected from an object in order to determine certain physical
properties of the object. One of the most common types of remote sensing is
microwave radiometry, which along with many other techniques is used for the
equipment of ﬂying laboratory and satellites.
There are several types of instrumentation that can be used for environmental
investigations. For examination of soil type, or surface moisture, the ones that come to
mind are thermal infrared radiometers, active radar systems, and the passive micro-
wave radiometers. A system of non-scanning single-beam microwave radiometers
was designed in Kotelnikov Institute of Radioengineering and Electronics (Shutko
et al. 2010). The basic technical parameters of this system are given in Tables 2.1 and
2.2. Common view of portable radiometers is given in Figs. 2.1 and 2.2.

The radar systems, including Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (IFSAR),
share the same frequency band as the microwave radiometers. Therefore they have
similar wave propagation characteristics, although the radar systems are actively
transmitting and measuring the return values. The radar/IFSAR systems rely on
surface texture to reduce surface boundary conditions.
Passive microwave systems only record the naturally emitted radiation, which is
a function of the soil moisture content within the ﬁrst several centimeters/deci-
meters and is less inﬂuenced by surface roughness. From a given height above the

ground surface radar systems have a much smaller ground sample distance, or pixel
size, than the passive systems. To compensate, the passive system can be ﬂown on
light aircraft at very low altitudes, as low as 500 ft above the mean terrain.
Thermal infrared radiometers (TIR) and the microwave radiometers both mea-
sure natural radiation from a thermodynamic process. TIR sensors are further
inﬂuenced by cloud, fog, smoke, solar radiation and other similar atmospheric
conditions. However, TIR operating in 10–12.5 μ wavelengths range are mainly
sensitive to the temperature variations which take place within a thin surface layer
of the object being imaged. This temperature variation could be the result of many
things, such as warm water, or steam leaking from underground pipes, poor insu-
lation properties on buildings, efﬂuent from a manufacturing process, etc.
Microwave radiometers, on the other hand, measure the natural radiation at mm,
cm and dm wavelengths that is primarily a function of soil moisture content in the
ﬁrst couple of centimeters/decimeters of the Earth’s surface.
Considerable experience of remote sensing in global scale was started with the
launch of orbital space station “Mir” which was complex science-research complex
(Fig. 2.3). This station was launched at February 20, 1986 and was submerged at
March 23, 2001 in the Paciﬁc Ocean.
Instrument complex of Mir space station for remote sensing functions was
equipped in specialized modules that were named as Spectr and Priroda (Nature).
Module Spectr has optical-visual and photometric instruments as well as lidar and
photographic cameras for the monitoring of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, as
well as for medical-biological investigations. Priroda (Nature) conceived for remote-
sensing research from orbit, was also sitting on the ground partially completed until
Russian-US cooperation revived the project. It became the last element, which
completed the construction of Mir. Module Mir had specialized complex of sensors:
• trace, panoramic and scanning microwave radiometers (radiometric system Ikar,
Tables 2.3 and 2.4);

• 64-channels IR-spectrometric system Istok;
• UV-spectrometric systems of visual and IR-range; and
• active radiophysical and optical systems.
Solution of speciﬁc environmental tasks requires the optimization of instru-
mental and algorithmic means. It can be realized by means of the GIMS-technology
methods. The ratio between experimental and theoretical methods in this case is
deﬁned by the complexity of environmental system that is to be studied. Cumu-
lative experience of the GIMS application is based on the solution of national

Historically this experience was started in 1980 with equipping of ﬂying labora-
tories based on bi-plane AN-2, twin-engine plane IL-14, 4-engine plane IL-18,
helicopters MI-2, MI-8 and Ka-26 (Krapivin and Shutko 2011, 2012; Shutko et al.
2010; Haarbrink et al. 2011). In the ensuing years, this set of carriers was widened.

Flying laboratory IL-18 has given a possibility to solve numerous environmental
tasks practically in real time. On-board system represented in Fig. 2.4 registered
environmental characteristics and at the same time processed existing and delivered

modeling system that interrogated all sensors with time period equaled to 0.01 s and
taking into consideration of navigation information all results were referred to the
geographical coordinates.

destroyed in 1990 when USSR was breaked. However, this experience was
developed in Russia (Krapivin and Shutko 2012).
One of effective multi-frequency polarimetric synthetic aperture radar system
was created in the 90s by the Russian Corporation Vega for surface and subsurface
sensing. It is airborne IMARC SAR system. This Corporation created radiometer
system Radius operating at the wavelengths of 0.8, 2, 5.5, 21 and 43 cm (Fig. 2.6,
Table 2.5). Main features of the IMARC SAR complex are given in Table 2.6.
The IMARC is a four-wavelength polarimetric airborne SAR system designed at
Radioengineering Corporation Vega (Kutuza et al. 2000). Radar system operates at
wavelengths: X (3.9 cm), L (23 cm), P (68 cm), and VHF (2.54 m); polarizations in
all bands: VV, HH, VH, and HV; spatial resolution is around 12 ± 8 m; maximum
swath is 24 km. The carrier of this system was a twin-turbine jet airplane TU-134A
and other planes. The main IMARC SAR mission goals were to map the charac-
teristics of Earth covers (including soil hydrological regimes), to map the ground
terrain in a presence of vegetation with eliminating of the inﬂuence of vegetation
and, to produce elevation models, to detect areas with on-ground and underground
irregularities, etc. (Shutko et al. 2010; Krapivin and Shutko 2012).
Airborne SAR system IMARC can use for solution the following tasks:
• surface sensing of ocean, ice and vegetation;
• subsurface sensing of scattering objects and deep layers.

Remote-Sensing Technologies and Data Processing Algorithms

Multi-frequency polarimetric SAR gives new possibilities for operative remote
sensing of sea, soil, vegetation, ice cover and other Earth surfaces. The algorithms
used for deep-layer remote sensing, which is undertaken layer-by-layer, make it
possible to solve a narrow set of environmental problems.
The larger the wavelength, the higher the inﬂuence of deeper soil layers—this
fact allows the development of methods of thick-layer deep sensing using multi-
frequency radar systems. For subsurface sensing the use of long waves of P and
VHF bands is required.
Information about soil properties (soil moisture) proﬁles can be received from
the analysis of measurements of scattering at different wavelengths. To calculate the
inﬂuence of soil moisture proﬁle into backscattering cross section it is necessary to
develop the models of reﬂection from the layers situated at different depth. Solution
of the inverse problem can be obtained by setting the measurement of backscatter at
several wavelengths and at different polarization modes. For complete information
about soil moisture proﬁle it is necessary to solve the problem of images inter-
pretation in broad band of wavelengths including meter band where attenuation in
soil and vegetation is comparably low.
The results of multi-band radar survey obtained with the help of 4-bands air-
borne SAR IMARC (Radioengineering Corporation Vega) illustrate the possibility
of measuring of hydrological soil regimes and water lenses allocation in Kara-Kum
desert. Lenses of underground water at the depth of 50–70 m were detected. Results
were validated by control well-boring. We can see at radar images:

Application of GIMS technology depends on just how complex the solution to
the environmental tasks under consideration is in a given time period at a given
precision. An effective instrument using GIMS technology was synthesized by
Miramap (a private-sector Dutch\Company) in response to a European Space
Incubator initiative from the ESA Technology Transfer & Promotion (TTP) Ofﬁce.
The TTP ofﬁce is contributing to the capitalization of space-based technology and
know-how for the beneﬁt of Europe’s economy and science. The innovation of
microwave radiometer (MR) mapping company (Miramap) was nominated for the
Holland Innovation Price in 2005 and was quoted in several newspapers and
magazines such as the Dutch Financial Times.
The Miramap instrument consists of three microwave sensors in X-band, C-band
and L-band which are all Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) integrated
(Fig. 2.7, Tables 2.7, 2.8, 2.9 and 2.10). The X-band and C-band sensor makes a
conical scan at constant incidence angle over a wide swath, while the L-band sensor
makes a twin-beam oscillating scan. The small instrument sizes and weights enable
use of a low-cost light aircraft as the observing platform, providing decision makers
with a new affordable tool. The platform on which these instruments are ﬂown is a

reliable and safe twin Aero Commander (Krapivin and Shutko 2012; Krapivin et al.
2012a). The aircraft is specially modiﬁed to simultaneously carry a range of other
instruments, such as (digital) photogrammetric cameras, lidar scanners, thermal
infrared and multi-spectral sensors. The capability to measure such a comprehen-
sive range of remotely sensed parameters from a single low-cost airborne platform
is unique worldwide.
With whole set of sensor shown in Tables 2.7, 2.8 and 2.9, company Miramap
provides the customers exactly with the parameters and environmental conditions
given in Table 1.18 including:
• surface soil moisture,
• underground moistening,
• depth to a shallow water table (down to 2 m in humid areas and down to 3–5 m
in arid/dry areas),
• located on the surface and shallowly buried metal objects of a reasonable size
under the conditions of dry ground,
• contours of water seepage through hydrotechnical constructions (levees, dams,
destroyed drainage systems, different kinds of leaks),
• biomass of vegetation above a water surface or wet ground,
• increase in temperature in land, forested and volcano areas,
• changes in salinity/mineralization and temperature of a water surface,
• water surface pollution, oil slicks on a water surface,
• on-ground snow melting,
• ice on a water surface and on the roads, runways.
Some indices of the effectiveness of the GIMS-technology realized in framework
of Miramap’s ﬂying research laboratory are the following:
(1) Soil moisture content
• operating range is 0.02–0.5 g/cm3
• maximum absolute error is:
– when vegetation biomass is less than 2 kg/m2–0.05 g/cm3;
– when vegetation biomass is greater than 2 kg/m2–0.07 g/cm3.
(2) Depth to a shallow water table
• operating range is:
– for humid or swampy areas—0.2–2 m;
– for dry arid areas, deserts—0.2–5 m;
• maximum absolute error is 0.3–0.6 m.
(3) Plant biomass (above wet soil or water surface):
• operating range is 0–3 kg/m2;
• maximum absolute error is 0.2 kg/m2.

(4) Salt and pollutant concentration of water areas (off-shore zones, lakes):
• operating range is 1–300 ppt;
• maximum absolute error is 1–5 ppt;
• relative error is 0.5 ppt.
Large-scale investigations on the creation of microwave research carrying
platforms were realized by Microwave Remote Sensing Division (MRSD) in 2002
through 2005 within the NASA Center for Hydrology, Soil Climatology and
Remote Sensing (HSCaRS) at Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University
(AAMU). This Division was capable of performing microwave radiometric data
interpretation and conducting studies in ﬁeld conditions, from mobile platform and
unmanned helicopter.
The antennas, radiometers, data collection system and an embedded Global
Positioning System (GPS) receiver were mounted on the manned Rover type mobile
platform and unmanned helicopter platform Microwave Autonomous Copter System
(MACS) for measuring the soil-plant system radiation. All radiometers were mounted
on a folding mounting panel to observe horizontally polarized radiation when folding
the panel is situated between the nadir through zenith looking angle. The GPS
information was used to register the microwave reading to a common coordinate
system of the study area. The data capture rate was set to 1 measurement per second in
each of the radiometric channels and GPS readings.
The manned “Rover” type mobile platform is a modiﬁed Gator utility vehicle. This
two-seater vehicle has a 286 cc, air-cooled, 4-cycle gasoline engine. Its towing
capacity is 500 lb (226 kg) with a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h). The instrument
platform (or mounting frame) for the radiometers and other instruments was
assembled at AAMU research station. The aluminum folding panel of 1.5 m × 1.5 m
connecting all system components was designed so that the incidence angle from 0°
(nadir) to 180° (sky) could be easily obtainable (Figs. 2.8 and 2.9 and Table 2.11).
The radiometers were mounted with the antennas viewing off to the right hand side of
the platform at an incidence angle of 10°. The radiometer “Rover” shuttled back and
forth in a north-south direction at a speed of 2–5 mph. using the developed remote
sensing system data obtained from a height of 2 m provided the spatial resolution of
1.4 m of land area.
The unmanned helicopter platform MACS was equipped with a 6 cm radiometer
(incidence angle 5°) mounted on the nose of the AutoCopterTM onto a stabilized
gimbal with pan/tilt interface which attenuates vibrations (Fig. 2.10, and Table 2.12).
The MACS is a modiﬁed AutoCopterTM, a small unmanned helicopter platform that
can ﬂy autonomously (ﬂy a pre-programmed ﬂight path) or semi-autonomously (with
an operator directing the maneuvers). This is a product of Neural-Robotics, Inc. (NRI)
of Huntsville, AL.
The unmanned helicopter advantage is its patented ﬂight control system con-
sisting of multiple neural network modules working together. The result is an
autonomous helicopter that adapts to changing conditions and provides an extre-
mely stable platform for hundreds of applications. The AutoCopterTM is 2.18 m in
length (from tip of tail rotor to tip of main rotor) and weighs approximately 13.6 kg.

It carries a payload of up to 6.8 kg. Basic avionics consist of a PC/104 computer,
altitude and heading reference system (AHRS), GPS receiver (WAAS-compatible),
downward pointing range ﬁnder (ultrasonic sensor), barometric pressure sensor, and
heading-hold gyro. The standard transmitter is used as the “ground station.”
The Ground Control Station (GCS) with a ﬂight planning program “Way
Planner” was used with the AutoCopterTM. This is a self-contained Windows-based
application that unlocks the power of fully autonomous ﬂight. The program enables
mission planning in 2D using stored satellite images. Flight plans were uploaded to
the AutoCopterTM via data link enabling the aircraft to takeoff, climb, ﬂy its pro-
grammed route, and land fully autonomously. The programmed ﬂight consisted of
an autonomous launch with 16 waypoints, a climb to 30 m, followed by a transition
to forward ﬂight at a velocity of 2 m/s and auto-landing.
During ﬂight the aircraft has the ability to state data (aircraft altitude, speed, and
other parameters in real time on the GCS screen in 2D and 3D. While maintaining
airspeed, altitude and heading, 8 ﬂight lines were ﬂown at a distance of *500 m at
30 m intervals. The time it took the helicopter to ﬂy from waypoint to waypoint
(north-south direction) was *4.5 min totaling *40 min of ﬂight time. Because the

2.3 Microwave Radiometry and Remote Sensing
of the Environment
Microwave radiometry, or passive microwave remote sensing, is one of the radio-
physical methods used for remote observations of the environment. It is based on
measurements of the natural electromagnetic radiation of objects in the millimeter
to decimeter range of wavelengths. The theoretical aspects of radiophysical mon-
itoring are determined by organizing a measurement procedure in the active or
passive regimes of electromagnetic radiation propagation. An active sensing tech-
nology is based on the radiolocation methods, and a passive one is based on the
background radiation registration. In both cases, theoretical tasks of microwave
monitoring are connected with the study of electromagnetic waves propagation in
the environment and, of course in the ﬁrst place, in the atmosphere and near
ionosphere (Kondratyev and Fedchenko 1992; Yakovlev 2001; Yakovlev et al.
2009; Chukhlantsev 2006; Gulyaev et al. 2009; Pavelyev et al. 2010).
In the active regime the talk is about the propagation of electromagnetic waves
of various ranges from the emitter to the receiver. Two cases are possible here. In
the ﬁrst case, the transmitter and receiver have different position in the environment
and the decision about the assessment of the environment parameters is accepted on
the base of registered distortion of transmitted signal. In the second case, the
transmitter and receiver are combined so that estimation of the environment
parameters is made on the base of analysis of the emitted signal absorption and
distortion of received its reﬂection. Clearly, the time it takes the signal to propagate
in the environment is the information parameter. An active form of microwave
monitoring is typical for the atmosphere radiotranslusense method.
Basic advantage of microwave remote sensing lies in its largely immune to
clouds, precipitation, smoke, etc. and a capacity to penetrate sand, soil, rock,
vegetation, dry snow, ice, etc. Knowledge of the physical processes associated with
energy emission at microwave range gives a possibility to calculate a variety
of surface and atmospheric parameters, including air temperature, sea surface
temperature, salinity, soil moisture, sea ice, precipitation, the total amount of water
vapor and the total amount of liquid water in the atmospheric column directly above
or below the instrument.
The passive methods of microwave monitoring are based on SHF-radiometry. The
existence of resonance absorption ﬁelds in SHF range allows remote reconstruction
of meteorological atmosphere parameters such as the vertical proﬁles of temperature,
humidity, total water vapor mass, water storage in the clouds, and precipitation
intensity, etc. The possibility to receive data not only about the properties of water and
2.2
Remote Sensing Techniques
139

land surfaces but also about deep characteristics depends on the choice of electro-
magnetic range. In the infrared range, total emission is formed into very thin surface
layer. Electromagnetic waves of microwave range are absorbed powerfully by the
land and water surfaces. The depth of its spread into the water environment is
measured in hundredth of millimetre; whereas dry soils, continental ices, and dry
snow this value can reach several tens of wavelengths. It allows to realize the remote
investigations of soil, ice and snow covers up to considerable depths.
Penetrating ability of radio-waves gives the advantage particularly under the
sensing of land covers. Vegetation without a dense canopy (grass, cereals, etc.)
absorbs radio waves weakly and this is the reason radio-observation of soil covers
through this vegetation is possible. Radio-waves can spread across the soil up to the
depth reaching one metre.
Main defect of microwave radiometric observations consists in the comparative
low spatial resolution in comparison with the optical range. In the radio-range the
high spatial resolution is achieved by the multichannel application and speciﬁc data
processing methods. It demands large economic investments.
Let us consider some aspects of active location. Let us supposed that irradiation
at the nadir of a smooth plot is realized. In this case the signal power reﬂected from
the land surface equals W = pGA|κ0|2(16πH2)−1, where p is the emitted power, G is
the coefﬁcient of directed action of antenna, A is the efﬁcient antenna area, H is the
antenna height above the ground surface, κ0 is the surface reﬂection coefﬁcient. If
all instrumental parameters and antenna height are known the ratio of power
accepted to that of the one received determines the value of the reﬂection coefﬁ-
cient. In the case when the soil is uniform by depth the reﬂection coefﬁcient equals
κ0 = (ε1/2 −1)/(ε1/2 + 1), where ε is the dielectric ground permittivity. For the
estimation of ε the following approximate formula exists
e ¼
e1=2
w pw þ e1=2
s
½1  pw

;

where εw is the dielectric water permittivity, pw is the relative volume concentration
of free moisture in the soil, εs ≈(1 + 0.5ρs)2 is the dielectric permittivity of dry
ground, and ρs is the dry ground density (1–2 g cm−3).
From Eq. (2.1) it is seen that reﬂected signal power give a possibility to
determine the reﬂection coefﬁcient and, consequently, dielectric ground perme-
ability. The value of ε deﬁnes the ground density when it is dry or the water content
if it is wet.
Dielectric properties of land covers are basic to use the radiometric methods for
its diagnosis under different situations. Speciﬁcally, the knowledge of spectral
coefﬁcient for the emission in the millimetre range allows to estimate the properties
of snow or ice layer.
The reﬂection coefﬁcient is determined as well as by passive methods using the
measurements of radiothermal emission intensity. The intensity of background
radiation at microwave range according to the Kirhgof law is characterized by the
brightness temperature

where κ is the emission coefﬁcient (or absorbing surface ability, or the blackness

Expression (2.2) characterizes the thermal emission of the surface but does not
take into account the emission falling on the surface or reﬂected by it. The coef-
ﬁcient κ is described by Frenel reﬂective formula. The thermodynamic and
brightness temperatures are measured in Kelvins: T(K) = t(°C) + 273. The emis-
sivity is a function of dielectric permittivity of the object/surface of observation. For
a land surface, the dielectric permittivity is ﬁrst of all a function of soil moisture.
The higher a soil moisture content, the higher the permittivity of soil, the lower the
emissivity/intensity of radiation/brightness temperature of this piece of land.
For a water surface, the dielectric permittivity is ﬁrst of all a function of electric
conductivity of a water solution that is dependent on a concentration of salts, acids,
on a presence of oil ﬁlms and many other chemical substances. For example, the
higher salinity of water, the higher the dielectric permittivity of water solution, the
lower the emissivity/intensity of radiation/brightness temperature of this water
body. Within the 2–30 cm band, for t = 10–30 °C, the radiation characteristics of
several surface types are shown in Table 2.13. Table 2.14 shows the sensitivity of
radiation in the X-band (2–3 cm) and L-band (18–30 cm) to the changes in free
water content in bare soil, soil density, salinity and temperature of the soil surface.
These data show that the main parameter affecting the intensity of a bare soil
radiation, practically independent of spectral band, is the soil moisture. Based on
this sensitivity it is feasible to estimate the value of soil moisture without a priori
data on the soil parameters.
The power registered by completely concerted receiver equals W = κTjΔf where
Δf is the received emission branch. In the case when the model of soil with the ﬂat

surface is considered the emission and reﬂection coefﬁcients are correlated by the
formula κ = |κ0|2. Consequently the knowledge of emission coefﬁcient allows to
estimate the reﬂection coefﬁcient and electrophysical properties of ground. Under
this it is necessary to know the soil temperature T or to calibrate the radiometer
using the land covers with emission coefﬁcients which are known. Theoretical bases
of remote methods, as a rule, have approximate character. This has to do with the
need for simpliﬁed prepositions. For example, among the simpliﬁcations often used
are uniformity of environmental parameters distribution by the depths or height,
absolute transparency of the area, the land covers smoothness. The models syn-
thesized under these simpliﬁcations reﬂect restricted spectrum of the studied phe-
nomenon properties. That is why the estimation of model adequation is necessary.
The problem of wavelengths choice and the combination of its ranges with the
classes of solved tasks is now within sight of many investigators. Theoretical
foundation of this choice lies in the area of the thermal radiation transmission
theory. Speciﬁcally, for the monochromatic case the transmission equation has
dI zð Þ=dz ¼ J zð Þ  aI zð Þ;
ð2:3Þ
where α is the absorption coefﬁcient, J(z) is the emission source distributed by z,
I(z) is the emission intensity in the point z. Under this for the unscattering atmo-
sphere the following equation is valid: J(z) = ε1(z)B(z), where ε is the atmosphere
emissivity,

h, c and k are fundamental constants, f = νc is the frequency. For the microwave
branch where the observed frequency is in the region of a few hundred gigahertz or
less it takes place a condition hf ≪kT and the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation is
valid: B(z) = 2kTλ−2. Here k = 1.38 × 10−20 mW Hz−1K−1 is the Boltzmann’s
constant, λ is the wavelength.

The weight function Q u
ð Þ ¼ @ sðu; 1Þ=@u describes an inﬂuence of various
atmospheric layers to the receiving signal. The formula (2.4) makes the expression
(2.2) into a whole. The examples of speciﬁc values Tj are given in Table 2.15.
Microwave measurement calibration is important in remote monitoring. Cali-
bration procedure can be deﬁned as the process of relating signals that can be
extracted from a measurement radiometric system to the physical characteristics of
a target such as its brightness temperature. The main goal of a calibration process is
in getting all measurements to account with a unique scale. In the passive regime
for this aim the objects having known brightness temperature are used (see
Table 2.16). Usually it is selected the forest or the freshwater reservoir. In this case
the radiobrightness temperature of forest is equaled to the thermodynamical tem-
perature of the trees canopy, and the radiobrightness temperature of reservoir is
calculated with the known algorithms (Yakimov 1996; Ferm and Hultberg 1999;
Burkov and Krapivin 2009; Krapivin and Shutko 2012).
2.3.1 Remote-Sensing Technologies in the Infrared
and Optical Bands
There exist no less than 10 technologies for remote sensing of the environment.
Between them are those not widely known and not widely applicable for our case,
namely: ultra-sound methods, radar sensing beyond the horizon, solar radiation
sensing and a few others.

For our case—that is, using the GIMS as the key instrument to solve environ-
mental problems, for decision-making procedures in the GIMS, for geoscience and
remote sensing, and for oceanic engineering—and for the very typical example of
diagnosing and preventing at an earlier stage the buildup of extensive moisture in
the soil, water barrier failure, and ﬂood development the most acceptable, useful
and effective, instruments, and technologies that have been proven in a number of
domestic and international campaigns are the following:
(1) Optical (digital photo and/or video cameras, spectrometers).
(2) Lidar (Laser 3-D scanner).
(3) Thermal IR-radiometers.
(4) Microwave radiometers.
(5) Radar (Synthetic Aperture Radar—SAR).
(6) Short pulse nadir viewing subsurface dielectric irregularities ﬁnder.
(7) Georadar (subsurface dielectric irregularities ﬁnder of on-ground location, also
nadir viewing).
Table 2.17 presents the effectiveness estimates of ﬁrst 5 of total 7 rather widely
used instruments with regard to their application for remote sensing of water and
land areas. Crosses in the Table 2.7 indicate the degree of capability (and thus of
usefulness) of different sensors to registration of different parameter variations or
changes in different situations in typical/characteristic environments. Three crosses
indicate the highest possible rank of effectiveness, one cross—minimum one.
Why are ﬁve of the seven, rather than seven of the seven, presented types of
sensors discussed? The answers are as follows:
(a) sensors 6 and 7 are still not used so widely as the ﬁrst 5 sensors,
(b) these two sensors were not used in the development of the GIMS, and
(c) special conditions are needed to organize a ﬂight campaign and to include in it
these sensors and Radar, including Synthetic Aperture Radar, which are
effective and useful, but heavy, of a big size and expensive tools for aircraft
and spacecraft remote sensing.
These technologies are under the development primarily in JPL and Vega Radio
Corporation in Russia and available for potential users.
Table 2.17 gives rough but effective assessments of how basic remote sensors,
operating at both passive and active microwaves in the infrared and optical bands,
behave under the basic parameters and conditions inherent in the following
scenarios:
• Oceanic, sea or fresh/water surface.
• Plane and rough water surface.
• Foam-covered and oil spill-covered water surface.
• Water-vegetative canopy system.
• Bare land surface.
• Vegetation-covered soil.
• Atmosphere-tree crown system (when sensing upward through the canopy).

As we mentioned above, the crosses in Table 2.17 characterize the information
content (usefulness) of different sensors, beginning from a single cross (the lowest
rate of usefulness) and moving to three crosses (highest usefulness). Thus this table
allows one to obtain preliminary assessments of the effectiveness of the expected
results of some experimental campaign under the development.
Of course, Table 2.17 reﬂects the expert-level opinion regarding the usefulness
of different sensors. This opinion was created by them based on multi year studies

of the spectral properties of different environments. This personal experience was
used to develop, test, and put into practice truly multi-spectral remote-sensing
technologies providing state-of-the art information by means of an optimum set of
sensors, such as those installed on board of the Dutch/U.S./Russia Miramap aircraft
equipped with the above mentioned multi-spectral passive/radiometric microwave,
thermal infrared, color digital orthophoto cameras, and lidar (laser 3-D scanner
working in the near-infrared band).
2.4 Monitoring of the Soil-Plant Formations
Land cover change is an important environmental process. Studying and monitoring
this change are signiﬁcant when assessing the variations and dynamics of the global
biogeochemical cycles of greenhouse gases. One of effective satellite instruments
that gives a possibility to detect the disturbances of the globe’s land surface is the
Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) of NASA’s Earth
Observing System (EOS).
MODIS is a key instrument aboard the Terra (EOS AM) and Aqua (EOS PM)
satellites. Terra’s orbit around the Earth is timed so that it passes from north to
south across the equator in the morning, while Aqua passes south to north over the
equator in the afternoon. Terra MODIS and Aqua MODIS are viewing the entire
Earth’s surface every 1–2 days, acquiring data in 36 spectral bands, or groups of
wavelengths. These data will improve our understanding of global dynamics and
processes occurring on the land, in the oceans, and in the lower atmosphere.
MODIS is playing a vital role in the development of validated, global, interactive
Earth system models able to predict global change accurately enough to assist
policy makers in making sound decisions concerning the protection of our
environment.
Understanding Earth system processes and their interdependencies through
observation, theory, and modeling, is the objective of many international programs
such as the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP), the Interna-
tional Human Dimensions Programme (IHDP), the World Climate Research Pro-
gramme (WCRP), and the Global Carbon Project (GCP). However, this is only
possible if reliable and operative information about the land covers is available.
Undoubtedly, the use of this information demands the creation of algorithms and
models to improve the quality of environmental monitoring.
A remote monitoring of the soil-plant formations is aimed at assessing biological
productivity, understanding interactions inside the soil-vegetation-atmosphere
system, evaluating biome dynamics, modeling biogeochemical cycles paying par-
ticular attention to the role played by vegetation, and controlling vegetation
resources.
Land covers are characterized by high landscape diversity having various soil
and plant types, water-salt and temperature regimes, the cultivating of surface layer,
and macrorelief. The soil includes solid particles, water (soil mixture) and air. Solid

particles consist of mineral and organic matter. Basic mass of majority soils forms
mineral substances (mineral soils): particles of size more 3 mm form the stony soil
part, particles from 0.01 to 1 mm are called as “physical sand”, and particles less
0.01 mm are “physical” clay. The minerals that make up the soil consist basically of
two oxides: SiO2 and Al2O3. The content of organic substances (mainly humus)
ﬂuctuates in such soils between 1 and 10 % by the weight. All these circumstances,
when the monitoring system of land covers is designed, lead to the necessity of
microwave channels choice to be informative. The many lengthy investigations in
this ﬁeld facilitate choosing the most effective wave range for monitoring many
types of vegetation and soils. Studies of agricultural systems, forest, and arid zones
are inevitable very detailed. Such areas as the control of hydrological soil regime
under the forest canopy and the study of reforestation dynamics in the regions of
clearing and forest ﬁres are perspective scientiﬁc ﬁelds to be studied at the nearest
time in the microwave monitoring. This can be done by using the decimeter range
in which the forest canopy is transparent in the microwave range and, consequently,
soil up to the ground waters level can be sensed. Experimental characteristics of the
natural microwave L-band emission of a forest are described by Chukhlantsev and
Shutko (1988), Phillips et al. (2004), and Chukhlantsev (2006).
A possibility of wood-bushes vegetation inventory by means of radiolocation
sensing is based on the correlation between the coefﬁcients of SHF waves back
scattering and the structure and dielectric properties of vegetation. Using radiolo-
cation systems to control forests is stipulated by the possibilities of additional data
being received together with remote measurements in the visible and IR ranges
(Savin and Bondur 2000).
Global mapping of vegetation in the scale determined by economic needs of
given region is main task of the satellite based radiolocators under the forest
observations. Speciﬁcally, the forest protection from the ﬁres is one of directions in
the development of remote monitoring to assess the vegetation state. Present
satellite- and aviation- based monitoring systems solve many signiﬁcant problems:
• Operative assessment of the forest’s ﬁre risk;
• The forest watering mapping under the putting out ﬁre in the forest;
• The mapping of the forest ﬁres contours through the smoke layer and trees
canopy;
• The determination of the energetic ﬁre parameters;
• The forest state determination after ﬁre;
Investigations of radiothermal emission from natural layers of a forest that are
combustible such as the lichen, mosses, grass rags, died pine needles, and scrub
have brought about methodologies to identify forest ﬁre parameters based on the
measurements of radiothermal emission in microwave range of electromagnetic
spectrum. The examples of radiobrightness temperature in the forest burning zone
are given in Figs. 2.11 and 2.12. The leading and rear edges of ﬁre and the burnt
forest in between can clearly be distinguished.
Comparing radiobrightness temperatures registered in different wavelengths
shows that forest ﬁres emissivity increases with the wavelength decrease and
2.4

depends on the ﬁre type. Given in Fig. 2.12 averaged results for the dependencies of
radiobrightness temperatures spectrum from various components of forest ﬁre under
different wavelengths allow to classify these components with high precision.
The GIMS synthesis with the functions of forest ﬁre control on the large areas
demands the creation of applied models describing the forest ﬁre-ripening
processes. The foundation of such models is, certainly, the knowledge how the
intensity of radiothermal emission of forest landscape element depends on its water-
content. Many observations show that statistical characteristics of the forest

microwave emissions are changed with the ﬁre-ripening growth for the layers of
combustible timbers. Speciﬁcally, such a dependence can be represented in the
following form (Yakimov 1996):
Tj ¼ jðk; wÞTSð1  expfaðk; wÞhgÞ þ TjSexpfaðk; wÞhg;
where κ and α are emission and absorption coefﬁcient, respectively; w is the water
content in the timber, h is the thickness of emitting layer, TS is the soil temperature,
TjS is the soil brightness temperature. The following deciding factor, based on the
calculating the ﬁrst-order (M) and second-order (σ) moment for the set of Tj cor-
responding to the forest territory and registered on the wavelength λ = 2.25 cm were
proposed by Yakimov (1996). The value M (mean) is compared with the threshold
equaled to d = 7.251σ + 249.876. If M ≥d then forest plot has average or higher
ﬁre-dangerous. If M < d then ﬁre-dangerous of given forest plot is low. This
deciding rule is to be extended by the forest ﬁre model. An example of such a
model is one describing forest ﬁre as a running wave or as self-supporting process
of local energy release into the active environment.
The millimeter range (1–30 mm and 30–300 GHz bands) is best for land cover
diagnosis. As numerous experimental investigations show, addicting millimeter
range channels to the monitoring system enhances the accuracy of soil-plant for-
mations classiﬁcation by separating out roughnesses and small formations. It is
especially important for anthropogenic landscape monitoring.
McCloy and Lucht (2004) developed a method for comparing the complex
spatio-temporal patterns present in two long-time series of data of the seasonal
cycles of vegetation for a large part of the global land surface. It is based on the
use of two datasets derived from global satellite observations (AVHRR) and
Lund-Potsdam-Jena dynamic global vegetation model (LPJ-DGVM). McCloy and
Lucht (2004) showed that the LPJ model generally corresponds well with natural
vegetation whereas the former is primarily dependent on climate. Due to a lack of
representation of agriculture in the model, the correspondence with actual vegeta-
tive status was poor.
2.5 Microwave Monitoring of the Soil Moisture
2.5.1 Introduction
A series of world wide large scale Soil Moisture Experiments (SMEX) have been
conducted from 1997 to 2005 by the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis-
tration (NASA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),
Hydrology and Remote Sensing Laboratory, with the involvement of institutions in
the USA, Japan and Brazil (Jackson et al. 2002). The primary objective of those

experiments was to evaluate the capabilities of satellite microwave sensors for soil
moisture mapping on a planetary scale. The experiments to date have all utilized a
combination of aircraft microwave measurements and in situ measurements to
achieve the goal.
Soil moisture was recognized by the NASA Post 2002 Program as a critical
measurement. Operational determination of soil moisture spatial-temporal vari-
ability plays a leading role in regional and global studies of the water, biogeo-
chemical and energy cycles. The efforts are targeted on the improvement of
spacecraft microwave radiometric assessments of soil moisture to the level of data
acceptability when reliable predictions of regional to global hydrologic regimes can
be provided. Soil moisture is a key state variable in hydrology: it is the switch that
controls the proportion of rainfall that percolates, runs off, or evaporated from the
land. It is the life-giving substance for vegetation. Soil moisture integrates pre-
cipitation and evaporation over periods of days to weeks and introduces a signiﬁ-
cant element of memory in the atmosphere-land system. There is strong
climatological and modeling evidence that the fast recycling of water through
evapotranspiration and precipitation is the primary factor in the persistence of dry or
wet anomalies over large continental regions during summer. As a result, soil
moisture is possibly one of the most signiﬁcant land surface boundary conditions
controlling the exchange of water and energy with the atmosphere.
Remote sensing of the environment by means of passive microwaves or
microwave radiometry is based on retrieval algorithms that relate the environmental
parameters (such as soil moisture, vegetation type and biomass, forest stem volume,
water equivalent, physical temperature, and others) to the remotely sensed radiation
characteristics (spectral brightness temperature, polarization). Microwave emission
from a natural object is governed by the interaction of electromagnetic waves with a
natural medium that is determined by its geometrical structure and dielectric and
electric properties of the medium constituents. In turn, these properties are con-
nected with geophysical and biophysical parameters of the medium that enables the
retrieval of these parameters from remotely measured characteristics of electro-
magnetic waves emitted or scattered by the object. Therefore, dielectric and electric
properties of natural media constituents and their relationships to geophysical and
biophysical parameters play a crucial role in microwave remote sensing of the
environment. Besides, the dielectric permittivity of a medium or its real part and its
imaginary part determines the penetration depth of electromagnetic waves in the
medium that is very important for subsurface remote sensing of soil moisture and
for soil moisture sensing under vegetative canopies.
The impact of microwave radiometer pixel size on the reliability of soil moisture
assessments for different landscapes and minimization of the number of in situ
locations for sampling soil moisture, temperature and vegetation parameters are key
elements of the study. As a result, a combined approach for soil moisture mapping
from a regional to global scale using microwave radiometric observations, labo-
ratory tests, in situ measurements and mathematical modeling of the soil-vegetation
system inherent in different landscapes is to be developed as a highly calibration
150

and validation input to the series of the NASA and USDA Soil Moisture Experi-
ments (SMEX) in the interests of hydrological science, technology and applica-
tions. In this aspect, the following problems are arising in the microwave
monitoring of soil moisture:
• development of models parameterizing biometrical, soil properties and radio-
metric data for typical sites;
• comparative evaluation of seasonal patterns in series of satellite, ground-truth
(and/or aerial) and laboratory data and simulations of soil-vegetation model;
• conduct intercomparisons of radiation data and mean values of soil moisture
data at different depths with regard for the type of vegetation cover and amount
of biomass;
• choice of constructive scheme for the data calibration basing on the available
radiative transfer model and results of measurements;
• spectral radiometric data processing related to soil moisture and vegetation
cover parameters and results of modeling;
• development of mathematical model for soil-vegetation system dynamics using
satellite, ﬁeld and laboratory data;
• combining approach to parameterization of data needed for description of water
balance in soil-vegetation system and of data delivered from microwave satellite
(AMSR-E/Aqua, etc.) spacecraft observations, ground based microwave
observations, laboratory tests, in situ measurements (sampling) and mathemat-
ical modeling; and
• using data of attenuation in vegetation and dielectric properties of soil and
vegetation samples as calibration and validation input to the GIMS.
2.5.2 Microwave Technology
The fundamental principles of soil moisture retrieval by means of the use of passive
microwave sensors and microwave radiometric technique for measuring soil
moisture properties have been established by Shutko (1986) and his disciples.
During a series of experiments, microwave radiometers were put on satellites,
aircraft, and ground-based vehicles. L-band passive microwave measurements were
the most informative in these experiments. Numerous investigations of sensitivity
of microwave measurements to vegetation biomass and soil moisture have shown
that remote sensing data give a possibility to solve important tasks from hydrology
and agriculture and to realize operational diagnostics of damage of stressful natural
processes. For instance, Ferrazzoli et al. (1992) carid out a comparative evaluation
of the potential of active and passive radiometers in estimating vegetation biomass
and soil moisture content. It was shown that low frequency data (L band) at a steep
incidence angle (10°) conﬁrm that both the backscattering coefﬁcient and the
normalized temperature are correlated and sensitive to soil moisture content.
2.5
Microwave Monitoring of the Soil Moisture
151

Interrelations between the characteristics of the microwave emission ﬁeld of
moisted soil and of the soil liquid water content, soil density, temperature and
mineralization level of liquid water are the properties studied both theoretically and
by ﬁeld measurements. Both research and ﬁeld studies show that microwave
radiometric measurements permit estimates of 7–10 moisture levels in the top 0.1–
1.0 wavelengths of soil and 3–7 grades of the subsurface water level between 0 and
1.5–3.5 m.
The soil moisture is divided into solidly united, loosely united, and free. United
moisture is the water adsorbed by ground particles at the surface and takes the form
of a ﬁlm of thickness equal to no more than six to eight molecular layers. The
volume of united moisture in the soil layer is determined by the soil type and is
ﬂuctuated in the wide interval from 2–3 % for sandy soil to 30–40 % for clay and
loess soils. United water is unattainable by plants and does not inﬂuence the salt
regime of soil. That is why the monitoring system is to realize that kind of moisture
classiﬁcation in the soil.
The soil moisture is expressed in percent of dry soil weight. Radiation models of
different types of soil moisture that consider soil density, temperature, and salinity
have been studied in great detail. The data required to ascertain moisture levels can
be obtained by means of brightness temperature contrasts, degree of polarization,
and spectral characteristics at centimeter and decimeter wavelengths. Wavelengths
2.25, 18 and 30 cm proved to be the most informative to solve this task. The
microwave radiation model describing the land cover emittively under the condi-
tions of heterogeneously moistened layer is based on the existence of vertical
heterogeneity in the dielectric permeability coefﬁcient (see Formula (2.1)):
ε ≅(1 + 0.5ρs)2. The value of ε is informative indicator of the moisture soil
variation. As soil moisture begin to grows the ε increases at ﬁrst slowly, if soil was
dry, then it increases more rapidly. The weak dependence of ε on the initial
moisture stage, explained by moisture tied up in the soil, can be characterized as
having small dielectric permeability. The variety of experimental dependencies of ε
from the soil types and moisturizing levels was given by many authors (Shutko
1986; Engman and Chauhan 1995; Borodin and Krapivin 1998; Schmugge 1990;
Tsegaye et al. 2005). Such a knowledge base combined with application of GIMS
technology allows ascertaining water content, Ws(z), diagnostics in the soil layer.
Basic types of moisture proﬁles Ws(z) of real soils and corresponding proﬁles, ε(z),
of dielectric constant were described by Reutov and Shutko (1986). Four major
types of vertical moisture proﬁles have been identiﬁed from an analysis of the
moistening characteristics of the various climatic zones in the Former Soviet Union.
In other climatic zones it is necessary to have such identiﬁcation. As a matter of fact
the task is reduced to the function Ws(z) reconstruction when the values Wsi = Ws(zi)
are known and the following conditions are satisﬁed:
@Ws=@zjz¼0  C;
0  Ws zð Þ  Ks zð Þ;
ð2:5Þ
where Ks(z) is the given function.
152

Remote-Sensing Technologies and Data Processing Algorithms

Practice has shown that, irrespective of the climatic zone, microwave radiome-
ters need to be used to achieve acceptable precision when reconstructing the vertical
proﬁle of moisture in a soil layer to a depth of one meter. There is a priori
information about average soil moisture for depths 50 cm (Ws2) and 100 cm (Ws3).
The value Ws1 is estimated by means of microwave radiometers with wavelengths
λ = 10 and 30 cm. Then the following approximation W
s ðzÞ ¼ az3 þ bz2 þ cz þ d
is considered, where unknown coefﬁcients are calculated from the condition of
minimal deviation between the W
s ðziÞ and Wsi (i = 1, 2, 3). For this to be done
conditions (2.5) have to be realized. This methodology allows soil moisture to be
determined by remote monitoring over large areas with an error no greater than
0.3 g cm−3 for a biomass of vegetable cover no smaller than 2 kg m−2 and with an
error up to 0.07 g cm−3 for a biomass greater than 2 kg m−2.
The knowledge of function Ws(z) allows to use the model of water balance of
territory to reconstruct the dynamical soil properties and other water balance ele-
ments as the functions of geophysical and ecological parameters. Experimental
valuation of thickness of upper soil layer on the lower boundary of which every
6 days after rain or watering the capillary connections breaking is taken place
(Fig. 2.13). Typical thickness of this dried up layer oscillates between 3 and 5 cm.

The reﬂection coefﬁcient estimations for the microwave range reﬂected from this
layer are given in Table 2.18.
Optimal choice of the electromagnetic radiation range and model synthesis based
on methodologies to measure the moisture content in the soil demands further
investigation of the conditions that inﬂuence emission ﬁelds in the atmosphere-soil-
vegetation system (Grankov and Mil’shin 1994; Engman and Chauhan 1995).
These investigations are to be correlated with application of remote sensing to
agricultural crop forecasting and in selected water resources management.
Figure 2.14 presents the sample of microwave radiometers application and the
use of spatial interpolation methods to solve the task of agriculture ﬁelds moni-
toring providing the soil moisture mapping. This can be done radiometers with 18
and 27 cm wavelengths located on a ﬂying laboratory. The experiments of such
type are realized in the climatic conditions of Moldavia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Cuba,
Vietnam, Russia, and USA (Shutko et al. 2010; Krapivin and Shutko 2012). These
experiments showned GIMS technology allows speciﬁc geophysical conditions to
have practically valid results from monitoring. To reconstruct the spatial distribu-
tion of soil moisture with precision of 20 %, the ﬂying laboratory in most cases
needs to ﬂy parallel routes at height H ≈200 m with a distance between them of no
more than 500 m. The interval between measurements, when the precision of
forecast for synoptical parameters is 10 % and for precipitation is 15 %, can be
monthly if the precision of soil moisture estimation is planned to be less that 50 %.

Guha et al. (2003) considered a series of experiments using the Electronically
Scanned Thin Array Radiometer (ESTAR). The Southern Great Plains Experiment
(SGPE-99), within the framework of which ESTAR-derived soil moisture ﬁelds
were studied, took place in a region of the United States that is characterized by a
relatively homogeneous geography, variable surface ﬂux properties, and large
seasonal variation in temperature and speciﬁc humidity. In addition to ESTAR, 4
different microwave radiometers operating in the L-(1-2 GHz), S-(2-4 GHz), and
C-(4-8 GHz) bands were ﬂown on aircraft. The instruments included the Polari-
metric Scanning Radiometer (PSR/C) the Step Frequency Microwave Radiometer
(Step-C), and the Airborne C-band Microwave Radiometer (ACMR) operating
in the C-band and the Passive and Active L- and S- Band System (PALS) in the
L- and S- bands. Passive microwave data were also collected by the Tropical
Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite and the Special Sensor Microwave
Imager (SSM/I) sensor.
Within these measurements, the problem of distinguishing between the water
contents in soil and vegetation cover was solved. An empirically derived piecewise
function was used to solve this problem. The vegetation water content (VWC) was
calculated with the following correlation:

Figure 2.15 demonstrates some results received by means of the GIMS using for
remote sensing data processing. Detailed and geo-referenced maps identifying the
locations of saturated and dry levees can be produced using microwave radiometric
measurements from a light aircraft or helicopter, and integrated with GPS for posi-
tioning and orientation. The development of synergetic remote sensing technology
for raised groundwater and seepage detection by the joint use of microwave and
optical data along with GIS databases is an effective and most contemporary way of
supporting risk assessment and facilitating disaster prevention and management.
2.5.3 Geoinformation System to Monitor Agriculture
The GIMS technology was set up to solve the wide range of problems arising in
agriculture (Reutov and Shutko 1986; Shutko 1986; Chukhlantsev 1986; Chukhlantsev
and Shutko 1988; Shutko et al. 2006a, b, 2010; Krapivin and Shutko 2012). The

have been of considerable interest to scientists and engineers who designed the Geo-
Information Monitoring System of Agricultural Function (GIMSAF).
Microwave radiometric technique for measuring soil moisture characteristics
have been developed and widely used in many regions by Shutko et al. (2010). This
experience was used in the GIMSAF to ﬁnd a procedure to determine the water
content and moisture proﬁles in soil layers a meter thick and without vegetation
cover by means of remote sensing. The procedure is based on the dependence of
microwave emissivity of soil on its moisture. The procedure takes into account the
variations of temperature, density and roughness of natural soils.
The GIMSAF performs:
• collection of information pertaining to the current parameters of the soil-vege-
tation system (moisture, shallow water table, soil salinity, biomass of the veg-
etation) over regions of various area;
• processing of the information above within the framework of a model simulating
the biogeocenotic, physical and chemical processes in the soil-vegetation system
with the aim of evaluating its current state and predicting its development and
potential productivity;
• represents current and predicted information as a schematic maps with spatio-
temporal detailing within a controlled structure;
• making technological decisions that are optimum from the point of view of
providing the maximal biological productivity of agriculture vegetation;
The GIMSAF structure includes units of:
• collection of information;
• initial information processing and accumulation of data for simulating the
agricultural vegetation productivity and water conditions;
• predicting the geosystem state;
• evaluation of the disparity between the measured and predicted trends in the
geosystem processes;
• making decision pertaining to the measurement scheduling and geosystem
controlling;
• service support in operation with input and output data.
The data collection unit is based on remotely sensed data and prior knowledge of
the state of an object and meteorological parameters. Remote pickups switch on a
microwave radiometric complex provided with computer programs that permit to
obtain operational area information at the desired degree of detailing concerning the
soil moisture content to a depth of 0–100 cm, the subsoil water level to a depth of
0–3 m, the salt concentration of the soil in a range of 3–90 g L−1, the vegetation
biomass, the degree of mineralization and contamination in reservoirs. Moisture
measurement operating range is 0.0–0.6 g cm−3 with maximal absolute error
equaled to the vegetation biomass less and more 200 t ha−1 to 0.05 and 0.05–
0.08 g cm−3, respectively.
The operation of the information processing units is based on a computer program
package providing spatio-temporal interpolation of remote trace measurements and
2.5

point surface measurements in addition to information ﬂow stabilization in the event
of the information collection system failing. The program package also realizes the
description of the dynamics of the moisture and biological, physical, chemical and
energetic processes in the interaction between the soil, vegetation, atmosphere and
energy sources including factors of anthropogenic effects.
The adaptation of the information processing units to the actual conditions in the
region studied is accomplished by introducing sets of coefﬁcients and characteristic
dependencies.
The trend-correcting and decision making units are based on evaluating the state
of the object under consideration, predicting its development, and ascertaining the
sensitivity of the system to potential production and technological measures put
forward by experts.
Let us now list some of the features of the GIMSAF and some of its differences
from similarly designated systems:
• use of remote radiophysical sensors pickups providing area, operative and
quantitative information on the state of objects;
• ability to function at various levels of information support (remote, surface and a
priory data set or part of them or without such data);
• fully open to further development regarding technological and software support
and full compatibility with any sensor, information, consulting, and expert
systems;
• algorithms that have the ability to adapt make the system self-regulating and, in
particular, noise immune;
• compatible means of bringing about production and technological decisions.
Application results are expected to include:
• obtaining reliable operative, area and quantitative information on the parameters
of the object and its general state with prediction;
• evaluation of the expediency and efﬁciency of anthropogenic effect on the
agriculture and melioration objects;
• optimum productional and technological decisions made with the help of a
simulational experiment and providing an increase in the object control
efﬁciency.
Developing GIMSAF based on a joint use of remote measurements, in situ data,
GIS information and mathematical modeling of temporal-spatial variations in soil-
vegetation systems in local, regional and global scales needs the following sub-
systems and phases of whole system accomplishment:
• Dual-channel multi-polarized SAR measurements from spacecraft with a spatial
resolution of 5–10 m for obtaining basic/strategic/global information about the
condition of corn crop ﬁelds.
• Selective dual-channel multi-polarized SAR measurements from aircraft with a
spatial resolution of 1.5–5 m for obtaining synchronous with spacecraft infor-
mation about the condition of agriculture vegetation in a regional scale.

• Selective four-channel, dual-channel and dual-polarized microwave radiometric
measurements from aircraft for determination of corn crop germination and corn
crop biomass in the areas with big and medium size ﬁelds; comparison of this
data with SAR estimates of vegetation biomass and yield assessments; SAR
estimates calibration and validation.
• Technical calibration of SAR and microwave radiometric signals with corre-
sponding technical means.
• The real-time or near-real-time data processing in form of maps and interpre-
tation in terms of crop germination at early phase of growth, crop biomass
before harvesting, vegetation homogeneity inside the corn ﬁelds and ﬁnally of
the expected yield.
• Additional information: Disaster management, revealing ﬂooding, drought,
hurricanes, others, observing annual dynamics inside and around the crop ﬁelds.
2.6 Microwave Radiometric Observations of Temperature
Anomalies
The microwave range is an informative component of the multi-channel systems
that monitor temperature anomalies on the Earth surface such as forest ﬁres, peat
bog ﬁres, areas of geothermal activity, etc. Measurements of radiation contrasts
make it possible to localize on a land surface the areas with anomalously high and
low brightness temperature values due to the temperature variations with respect to
a mean value of effective background radiation. Numerous experimental investi-
gations shown that radiobrightness contrasts registered by the radiometers with
wavelengths 0.8 and 3.4 cm in the areas of the burnings in the forests, peat bogs,
and peateries can achieve values ΔTj ∈[200, 300]K. The most important result is
that the microwave range is sensitive to the surface temperature variations, and
hence, the detection of possible burning hotbeds can be preventive. Speciﬁcally,
microwave monitoring of the peat bogs allows to ﬁx interior zones of the tem-
perature anomalies when external signs are absent.
Wildﬁres and peat burning are extreme events for many regions of Russia,
Australia, USA, Canada and other countries. Wildﬁres occur on every continent
except Antarctica. They are a force that we cannot really control, and thus under-
standing, appreciating, and learning to live with wildﬁre is ultimately our wisest
public policy. These events cause principal changes to forest ecosystem dynamics
and inﬂuence on regional climate. Population considers these events as disasters
bringing economical losses and victims. Therefore, earlier detection of these events
with timely warnings is main task of environmental monitoring systems. Solution
of tasks arising here is subject of numerous publications (Alvarado et al. 1998;
Johnson and Miyanishi 2001; Wuerthner 2006; Johnson 1996; Fuller 1991; Perona
and Brebbia 2010; Brebbia 2012).

Johnson (1996) assembles the relevant studies of ﬁre intensity, rate of spread,
fuel consumption, ﬁre frequency, and ﬁre weather in the North American boreal
forest. The central thesis is that the North American boreal forest has at least four
wildﬁre characteristics that are important in understanding the dynamics of its plant
populations:
• the large size of the burns with respect to dispersal distances;
• the short recurrence time of ﬁre with respect to tree lifespans;
• the high mortality of plants due to the predominance of crown ﬁres; and
• a good germination surface due to the large area of the forest ﬂoor that is
covered by ash.
Perona and Brebbia (2010) note that as in the past, future forest ﬁre scenarios are
impacted by climatic trends and changes in climatic extremes, as well as by
anthropogenic pressure. It is to be expected that future trends, especially in the
Mediterranean regions, will certainly lead to an increasing impact of human pres-
sure on the natural environment. Increases in tourism and enlargement of urban
residential areas invading the countryside are basic causes of anthropogenic
changes in the environment. Forecasting the effects of both factors (climatic and
anthropogenic) and separating their effects on forest ﬁres frequencies may be
particularly difﬁcult, but is essential to improve our knowledge of forest ﬁre
occurrence probability and to better organize prevention and ﬁghting activities. At
the same time, estimation of the possible increase of ﬁre risk over coming years is
important, taking into account also the diverse ﬁre prone environments present in
the Mediterranean as well as many other areas (mountain slopes, coastal zones,
large islands, etc.). Book written by Perona and Brebbia (2010) contains peer-
reviewed papers presented at the Second International Conference on Modeling,
Monitoring and Management of Forest Fires held in Kos, Greece, in 2010. The
papers covered important topics in the ﬁeld of prevention and ﬁghting of forest
ﬁres, including: Computational Methods and Experiments; Air Quality and Health
Risk Models; Detection, Monitoring and Response Systems; Decision Support
Systems; Resource Optimization; Risk Assessment and Vulnerability Assessment.
Brebbia (2012) includes selected papers presented at the Third International
Conference on Modeling, Monitoring and Management of Forest Fires, held in May
2012. The Conference is the third in a series of biennial conferences organized by
the Wessex Institute of Technology on the topic of applying computer techniques to
the difﬁcult ﬁeld of forest ﬁre prevention, management, and mitigation. In order to
prevent or reduce major loss of life and property, and damage to the environment, it
is important to be able to analyze the behavior of forest ﬁres. To do so requires the
development of computer codes that can take into consideration a large number of
different parameters.
Main problem of wildﬁre control is earlier detection of ﬁre point. The problems
arising here are solved by many authors (Artemov et al. 1974; Borodin et al. 1976,
1978; Borodin and Mitnik 1977; Solimini 1995; Bonafoni et al. 2011). One of efﬁcient
methods is microwave radiometry technology which gives possibility to detect tem-
perature anomalies in forested areas. Numerous experimental investigations have
160
2
Remote-Sensing Technologies and Data Processing Algorithms

shown that wavelengths 0.8 and 3.4 cm register radio-brightness contrasts ΔTb ∈[200,
300] °K. The most important fact is that microwave range is sensitive to the surface
temperature change what allows the detection of heat sources on the peat bogs and in
forests. It is indicated that microwave monitoring of peat bogs and forests can detect the
ﬁre point with warning.
In common case, passive radiation of the surface registered at the wavelengths λ1
and λ2 gives ΔTb ≈κΔzdTs/dz where Δz = z2 – z1 (z2 > z1) is the difference of the
depth between sub-surface layers, dTs/dz = −Q/kT, Q is the heat ﬂux intensity, kT is
the thermal-conductivity coefﬁcient for layer Δz. SHF-radiometer sensitivity usually
equals dTs/dz ≈0.1–1.0 °/m. It allows measurement of water content in vegetation
biomass what gives the possibility to assess ﬁre dangerousness using corresponding
models. Effectiveness of microwave monitoring of forested areas depends on the
model structure of vegetation environment. Ground ﬁre is the most problematic
object for its detection because of presence of radiation attenuation in the vegetation
cover. Multi-channel sensing promotes the solution of many tasks, arising here, by
means of cluster analysis application.
Use of three-layers model of the ﬂame-smoke-tree crown gives αP = (1–exp
{−κ1})exp(−κ2) exp(−κ3) where αP is the emissivity of ﬁreplace of the lower forest
ﬁre, κI is the attenuation coefﬁcient for ﬂame radiation (i = 1), smoke (i = 2) and the
whole of crown (i = 3). Attenuation coefﬁcient of tree crown is function of tree
types. It is determined that absorption in crown grows strongly with decrease of
wavelengths. Figure 2.16 shows a dependence of radio-brightness contrasts from
wavelengths.
Observations show that statistical characteristics of SHF-radiation for forested
areas are changed with growth of ﬁre readiness for layers of combustible forest
materials. As an example, such dependence can be written in the form (Yakimov
1996):
Tb ¼ jðk; wÞTsð1  expfaðk; wÞhg þ Tbsexpfaðk; wÞhg;
Fig. 2.16 Averaged spectr of radio-brightness contrasts for separate elements of the forest ﬁre:

and burned-out zone

where κ and α are the radiation and attenuation coefﬁcients, respectively; w is the
medium moisture content; h is the radiative layer depth; Ts is the soil temperature;
Tbs is the soil brightness temperature. Yakimov (1996) proposed the following
decision rule based on the calculation of mathematical average M* and standard
deviation σ* for series of Tb for forested area using wavelength 2.25 cm. Value M*
is compared with threshold d = 7.2514σ* + 249.876. If M* ≥d then considered
forested area has average or higher forest ﬁre dangerous. If M* < d then ﬁre
dangerous of considered area is low.
The forest ﬁre scale depends on the series of factors such as water content in
vegetations, topography, and wind direction. Water content in the plants is the most
important factor regulating the speed of forest ﬁre evolution. Maki et al. (2004) and
Rahimzadeh-Bajgiran et el. (2012) studied relations between different indexes of
forest ﬁres and determined that the most perspective indexes are:
• vegetation dryness index (VDI);
• temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI);
• water deﬁcit index (WDI); and
• normalized difference water index (NDWI).
To assess the water content in vegetation it is needed to use indicators FMC (fuel
moisture content) and EWT (equivalent water thickness):
FMC=100 % ¼ FW  DW
ð
Þ=FW; EWT g=cm2


¼ FW  DW
ð
Þ=r;
where σ is the area of leaves in crown (cm2), FW is the wet weight of vegetations
(g) and DW is the dry weight of vegetation (g).
Indicators NDWI, WDI and VDI are calculated by means of the following
formulae:
NDWI ¼ Tb;NIR  Tb;SNIR


= Tb;NIR þ Tb;SNIR


;
WDI ¼ 1  D1=D2; VDI ¼ 1  D3=D4;
where Tb,NIR is the brightness temperature registered in near IR range, Tb,SNIR is the
brightness temperature registered in shot-wave IR range, Δ1 is the distance on the
phase plane (NDWI, NDVI) between conditions when water deﬁcit (D) and excess
(C) take place under low-density vegetation, Δ2 is the distance between conditions
of dense (A) and low-density (B) vegetation, Δ3 and Δ4 are distances between
measured NDVI and NDWI and between sides of parallelogram with corners in
points A, B, C and D (dense vegetation and moisture excess) on plane (NDWI,
NDVI) under NDVI = const, respectively. Index NDWI is calculated basing on the
measurements received from satellite SPOT in channels 430–470, 610–680, 780–
890 and 1,580–1,750 nm. NDVI value is usually assessed with use of measure-
ments received by means of sensors in red and near IR ranges from satellite
Landsat.

coefﬁcients of which are shown in Table 2.19.
Experimental results of the ﬁre dangerous assessment are represented in
Figs. 2.17, 2.18, 2.19, 2.20 and 2.21. Figure 2.16 shows proﬁle of radio-brightness
temperature ﬁxed by means of radiometer 0.8 cm under monitoring of burned peat
piles, peat bog and forest ﬁre. Increase of radio-brightness temperature for case of
burned peat piles equals to 100–200 K. Increase of radio-brightness temperature for
case of peat bog monitoring is 100–300 K. Finally, increase of radio-brightness
temperature for forest ﬁre case is 30–70 K. These variations exceed levels of phone
radiation variations (5–20 K) and equipment noise (1–5 K).
Figures 2.18 and 2.19 show radio-thermal specters of peat bogs from which it is
followed that emissivity coefﬁcient of peat bog has anomalous decrease for
wavelengths 10–20 cm and has considerable increase of absorption coefﬁcient.
These features follow from capillary-porous peat structure with abrupt differences
of volumetric and dielectric characteristics of peat particles in space between of
which there exist large quantity of coupled water and air.

brightness temperatures registered in different directions of ﬂying laboratory traces.
Total error of radio-brightness contrasts is near to 2 K. Results given here show that
microwave radiometers allow the detection of ﬁre in its beginning with high
probability.
Another important area for the application of microwave radiometry is remote
control of geothermal sources. Microwave monitoring facilitates analyzing the

activity and classifying geophysical structures in areas where geothermal sources are
active. In such areas the water content of rocks is insigniﬁcant and, hence, the depth of
electromagnetic wave spread is increased to equal the inverse value of the absorption
coefﬁcient per unit of depth z. Multi-channel measurements based on use of the
microwave range use and application of GIMS technology allow soils to be
reliably classiﬁed and thermal situations mapped. Figure 2.23 demonstrates

In connection with the change climate problem the forest ﬁres monitoring gains
speciﬁc role in the global ecoinformatics. The forest state and its inﬂuence on the
greenhouse gases concentration is impossible for the reliable assessment of the
present and future tendencies in the environment change. That is the reason a global
geoinformation monitoring system has to have built into it a function to effect such
an assessment. For such a function to be brought about there needs to be a model
that can identify the forest state from radiothermal radiation. For such a model to be
created there needs to be knowledge of the dependencies of forest radiothermal
radiation on different wavelengths to reconstruct the moisture content of forest
timber at various layers and its combustibility. Investigations of many authors
shown that application of microwave sensing in the range 0.8 ÷ 20 cm allows to
estimate the ﬁre-dangerous for the waterlogged forests.
Multi-channel sensing allows using cluster analysis algorithms to distinguish and
classify ﬁre risk classes. The accuracy of this methodology depends on the detail of
description by the model of the forest structure reﬂecting the canopy state and trees
density. The most difﬁcult to identify are forest edge ﬁres. In this case the three-
layers model of the ﬂame-smoke-canopy system is effective:
aP ¼ ð1  expfj1gÞexpðj2Þexpðj3Þ;
where αP is the emittive ability of the forest near-land ﬁre hotbed, κi is the emission
relaxation coefﬁcient by the ﬂame (i = 1), by the smoke (i = 2), and by the canopy
(i = 3). The emission relaxation coefﬁcients are functions of the trees type. It was
established that absorption in the canopy increases with high speed as the wave-
length is decreasing. Consequently, the receipt of emissions and the discovery of
forest near-land ﬁres become difﬁcult when trees have a compact structure.
Nevertheless, wavelengths 0.8–1.5 cm enable forest ﬁres to be estimated with high

reliability in most cases. It is connected with that main contribution to the micro-
wave emission by the ﬁre hotbed gives the ﬂame particles having the sizes up to
100–300 μm. The burning zone gives the radiobrightness temperature increase on
the wavelength 0.8 cm equaled about 200 K. It exceeds the radiometers sensitivity
limit. Therefore, microwave monitoring of forest ﬁres in contradiction to optical
methods does not depend on the weather conditions.

The problem of temperature anomalies diagnosis demands the development of
speciﬁc algorithms for the data processing. Joint use of microwave radiometers and
model of atmosphere-soil-vegetation system allow to have the efﬁcient technology
to solve this problem. Microwave observations provide estimates of the vertical
proﬁles of temperature in the ground as a result of the dependence of effectively
emitted layer on wavelength. Two wavelengths are normally used in practice.
Applied model describing the temperature proﬁle is based on the assumption about
the proﬁle form. Thus, the effectiveness of microwave radiometry for thermal
source detection and intensity measurement depends on just how adequate this
assumption is. The minimum temperature gradient determined from the radiation
data at two wavelengths is approximately 0.3–1 °cm−1. Note that effectiveness of
microwave range is much higher then infrared radiometry due to the ability of
electromagnetic microwaves for penetration into a soil.
2.7 The Atmosphere Microwave Monitoring
The present state of industrial technologies, energy supply, and transportation
worldwide coupled with the, growing number of massive industrial complexes are in
continuous conﬂict with ecological standards for natural environment quality, lead-
ing to greater risks of accidents, anthropogenic and natural catastrophes, and natural
disasters in many parts of the world. All of which highlights the necessity for unin-
terrupted control of the most vulnerable environment subsystem—the atmosphere.
A role of microwave methods to solve this problem consists in the expansion of the
atmosphere monitoring system functions basing on the optical control principles.
Since the atmosphere is almost limpid for many radio waves its effectiveness under
the atmosphere parameters measurement turn out to be insigniﬁcant especially in the
local scales. Nevertheless, numerous experimental investigations using a ﬂying

laboratory and satellites show that microwave sensing of the atmosphere is not as
good as optical methods on the short traces but is indispensable for atmospheric
control over large areas. A choice of wave range for the atmosphere sensing is
determined both by the special features of given task and by spatial scales.
A concept of assumed ecological loading on the atmosphere essentially depends
on the level of spatial-temporal consideration of the proceeding processes in the
interaction between natural environment and anthropogenic factors. Four levels
corresponding to the ecological monitoring systems can be shown.
The global level (planetary) predicts the impact of anthropogenic inﬂuences on
the atmosphere during intervals from several months to tens of years. Macrolevel
(continental) considers the processes connected with the trans-boundary moving of
the atmosphere pollutants between the countries or continents. A functioning of
monitoring systems is regulated by legislative statements. Spatial and temporal
scales spread thousands km and several months to year, respectively. Mesolevel
(regional) considers the atmosphere pollution process over restricted territory with
the selection of pollution sources and its chemical components. The spatial structure
of considered processes is detailed by 100 m–100 km. Temporal scales is changed
from several hours to units days. The monitoring systems of this signiﬁcance level
control the atmosphere state in the large industrial cities. Microlevel (local) con-
siders the processes of atmosphere pollution over the areas having linear sizes from
several to hundreds meters with the timescales from units to 10 min. The moni-
toring systems of this level registers single phenomenon with detail study of spatial
distributions of atmosphere parameters in the local area. Such systems usually are
used to control the atmosphere contamination in the zone of dangerous industries.
The atmosphere pollution sources are divided on stationary and unstationary
one. Each source is characterized by the quantity of emitted contaminants with the
speciﬁc properties per unit time, by the temperature of emitted aerial mixture, by the
altitude above the earth surface, by the velocity of emitted mixture, and by
the geographical coordinates. Under this the source types are distinguished by the
geometric form (point, linera, areal) and by the emission regime (continuous action,
periodical, emitting a volley). Moreover, atmospheric pollution sources can be
classiﬁed by their hazard levels. In the ﬁrst place large chemical industries, ground
and underground oil- and gas- reservoirs, gas- and product- pipes, industrial res-
ervoirs of liquid ammonia, chlorine, concentrated sulphuric acid, and also industries
connected with the emission of sulphur gas, nitrogen oxides, and hydrogen sulﬁde
are selected (Straub 1989; Liou et al. 2010; Krapivin and Nazaryan 1997).
Classiﬁcational characteristics of scaleness and of physical-chemical state of
atmosphere pollution sources simplify the monitoring system design. Although
pollution source categories can be precisely classiﬁed, adequate monitoring systems
often do not exist. Nevertheless, in each concrete case such correlations are inev-
itably established when an atmospheric pollutant dynamics model is created.
Remote sensing methods of the atmosphere are based on the study of electro-
magnetic and acoustic waves propagation. In the laser sensing optical radiation
scattering on the aerosol and atmosphere gases molecules is used. In the radiolo-
cation sensing the effects of turbulent pulsation is taken into account. Laser sensing

is certainly effective at determining the chemical composition of the atmosphere,
wind speed, temperature, cloud parameters, and dust formations (Klyuev 2000).
The diagnostics of water content in the clouds, compound of atmosphere gases and
aerosols by its thermal radiation in the microwave range is based on the spectral
measurements (Strelkov and Soldatova 1989).
Many authors use the millimeter wavelength band to diagnose atmospheric
gases. Strelkov (1995, 1996) implemented the estimates of atmospheric track
optical depths between two satellites on admixture gases CO and N2O resonance
absorption frequency in millimetre and submillimetre bands with taking into
account the data on their atmospheric concentrations. It was shown that optical
depths are completely deﬁned by admixture gases from the sighting dis-
tances ≈15 km and can be measured, which indicates the use of the active remote
sensing method of the atmosphere for CO and N2O contents deﬁnition. Intrusion of
these gases to the atmosphere is caused by anthropogenic factors to a considerable
extent. But it is problem for many biogeochemical processes such as ozone cycle.
That is why possibility of the measurement of these gases concentration with
satellite systems is signiﬁcant achievement.
Strelkov (1996) developed new method for measuring the concentration of water
vapor in the mesopause by active sensing at resonance wavelengths of the rotational
spectrum. He showed that for two-frequency sensing, simultaneous measurement of
the height proﬁles of the concentration of water vapor and of the temperature within
the mesopause is possible. This method is based on the fact that within the
mesopause water vapor completely determines the optical depth of the sensing path
in the centres of its spectral lines with wavelengths λ ≥0.5 mm. Moreover the
absorption coefﬁcient in the centre of the line with resonance frequency fi is
described by the expression

Scientiﬁc and technical achievements in the satellite monitoring of atmosphere
gases are important in connection with the greenhouse effect and ozone problems
(Kondratyev and Varotsos 2000; Zuev 2000; Krapivin and Nitu 2011). The active
and passive sensing of some atmospheric gases from satellite board with millimetre
and submillimetre wavelengths allow to measure the content of O2, O3, N2O, H2O,
CO, BrO, ClO and HCl. For example, the possibility of active sensing of the added
gas is equivalent to the possibility of reliable measurement of the inter satellites
trace optical depth, τ, stipulated by the gas:

The radio-trauslusense method with using two satellites at frequencies of strong
gas absorption lines proves to be effective approach to the ozone layer characteristic
measuring (Strelkov 1995; Yakovlev 2001; Yakovlev et al. 2009). Enhancement of
this method is given by Yakovlev et al. (2009). Radio-eclipsing method of the Earth
sensing is proposed. Principal scheme of this method is characterized in Fig. 2.25.

2.7
The Atmosphere Microwave Monitoring
171

This method is based on the effect of variations in the intensity of electromagnetic
ﬁeld, as well as in the phase and frequency of radiowaves under the transmission of
atmosphere and ionosphere. Eclipse monitoring of the atmosphere and ionosphere
is dependent on the inverse problem being solved so that it can deﬁne the vertical
proﬁles of electron concentrations, refraction coefﬁcients and atmospheric tem-
peratures. Subsequent development of this method would involve creation of
algorithms that might make it possible to identify atmospheric and ionospheric
characteristics based on regular measurements.
According to the estimations by many authors the greatest role of microwave
radiometry is displayed under the precipitation and clouds monitoring. For the ﬁrst
time these possibilities were demonstrated by the experiments with satellite
“Cosmos-243” in 1968, and then many space microwave measurements were real-
ized by means of SMMR (Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer), SSM/I,
TRMM, and multichannel on-board systems placed on the cosmic station “Mir” what
was sunk in 2001.
Local measurements of water vapor concentration in the atmosphere reliable are
registered with wavelength 1.35 cm. Under this the dependence of atmosphere
radiobrightness temperature on the integrated content of water vapor can be well
described by a linear function with a slope equal to ≈19 K g−1 cm−1.
The application of radio waves from the centimeter and millimeter ranges to
diagnose atmospheric properties has been pretty successful because of weak, unlike
the optical and IR ranges, interaction with cloud particles, dust, and atmospheric gas
molecules. Radio wave interaction with rain drops, on the contrary, is resonant and
expressed by the intensive absorption and scattering of wave energy. Therefore,
microwave devices of the active and passive sensing at present time are unique
means giving a possibility to receive from space the data about the precipitation
parameters in global scale.
Microwave observations of precipitation are based on the measurements and
calculations of four Stock; s parameters (Zagorin 1999; Zagorin and Kutuza 1998;
Kutuza et al. 1998, 2000): S = {S1, S2, S3, S4), where S1 is the total intensivity of
radiation, S2 is the difference between the radiation intensivities of horizontal and
vertical signal polarization, S3 is the difference of radiation intensivities with linear
orthogonal polarizations respect to the coordinates system turned by 45°, S4 is the
difference of radiation intensivities of right and left circular polarization. The
Reileigh-Jeans approximation gives S1 = 2kBTjλ−2, where kB is the Boltzmann’s
constant (=1.38 × 1020 mW Hz−1K−1), λ is the wavelength. These parameters are
the functions of radiobrightness temperatures Tj of radiation, receiving by the
channels of vertical, TV, horizontal, Th, under the angle ±45°, T±45, and circular
(right, Tr, and left, Tl) polarizations, and also they are expressed as functions of
complex amplitude for the vertical, EV, and horizontal, Eh, components of electric
ﬁeld intensity of radiothermal emission (Zagorin abnd Kutuza 1998):

The Stock’s parameters, measured directly in ﬁeld experiments, together with
other measurements and using cluster analysis allow clouds and rains types to be
realized. Figures 2.26 and 2.27 give data about the correlation of the Stock’s
parameters with the rain intensity calculated by Zagorin (1999). The maximum
Fig. 2.26 A dependence of third Stock’s parameter from the rainfall intensity. A thickness of the
rain layer is 3 km. A descending microwave emission with the angle of 50° to the zenith is
considered. The drops slope angle is equaled to 5° (Zagorin 1999)

spectral dependencies of the second, third, and fourth Stock’s parameters on
microwave Sun radiation dispersed as a result of rain intensity increasing are dis-
placed to the low-frequency region (up to ≈6 GHz). So, for the rain layer having
the thickness in 4 km under the Sun observation under corner in 20° regarding the
horizont the maximal values of S2, S3 and S4 are achieved under the rain intensity
r = 12.5 mm h−1 and for the frequency ≈13.5 GHz. They are equaled: S2 = 220 K,
S3 = 44.6 K and S4 = 5.95 K. When r = 50 mm h−1 and frequency ≈6 GHz these
parameters are the following: S2 = 483 K, S3 = 101.5 K, and S4 = 28.5 K.
Polarization radiometry of precipitation is based on two effects: the nonspherical
form of rain drops and the existence of a distinct direction in which the symmetrical
axes of falling drops are oriented. This means that the emission and absorption of
radio waves having vertical and horizontal polarizations that differ in directions
from the orientation of symmetrical axes of rain drops can be distinguished. For this
reason the azimuth simmetry of radiothermal ﬁeld of the rain emission is absent.
And this means that microwave emission of the rain is partly polarized. Therefore,
the task of precipitation diagnostics is reduced to ﬁnding the degree of dependence
of the emission polarization parameters (polarization degree, slop angle of polari-
zation plane, polarization ellipse form, etc.) on characteristics of the state of the
environment in which rain is dispersing.
The ﬁrst polarization radiometric measurements of the rain descending micro-
wave emission were realized by Kutuza (1977), and then were motivated and
developed by the experiments and theoretically in the subsequent investigations.
The results of measurements of Tj in general and difference channels of microwave
radiometer at λ = 2.25 cm (13.3 GHz) given the estimations of degree of linear
polarization of rain radio-emission. When intensity of steady downpour was
changed between 0.5 and 2.5 mm h−1 it was equaled to 5.5 %. The rains having the
convective type with the intensity more 5 mm h−1 had the degree of linear polar-
ization which was increased until 8.5 %. These estimations guarantee the distinct
delimitation of the rain zones.
The methodology set up to estimate the parameters involved in the distribution
of rain drops by size developed by Gasiewski and Kunkee (1994) is based on the
measurements of two Stock’s parameters, S1 and S2. The gist of methodology
consists in solving an inverse task under the preposition that non-spherical drops
have an exponential distribution with two unknown parameters determined by the
data about S1 and S2. The contribution of values of third and fourth Stock’s
parameters to the solution of rain diagnostics task is determined by the expansion of
estimated parameters. So, S3 is proportional to the differential relaxation, Δ1, of
radiowave. The fourth Stock’s parameter is proportional to the product of Δ1 and
differential phase displacement, Δ2. A value of Δ = Δ1 + iΔ2 is called as the rain
anisotropy parameter and it can be measured directly. Theoretical dependencies of
Δ from different parameters of the rain are studied by Gasiewski and Kunkee
(1994). It was shown that the spreading in the distribution by the slop corner to the
vertical of projections of drops symmetry axis in the plane which is orthogonal to
the direction of wave spreading exercise largest inﬂuence on the precision of Δ
estimation. Statistical models describing the orientation of drops allow the average
174

value and dispersion to be connected with the Gaussian distribution law of drops
according to the orientations of wind ﬁeld parameters (Zagorin 1999). It was dis-
covered that when dispersion of drops orientation less 30 % theoretical and
experimental estimations of Δ are similar in the value. It allows to use the devel-
oped models of rain in practice.
The atmosphere microwave control supposes the existence of radiation source in
the microwave range. Such a source can be Sun, the radio-emission of which in its
calm state (when the ﬂashes are absent) within the frequency region λ ∈[2,100]
GHz can be characterized by Tj ∈[5 × 103, 1.5 × 104] K. Non-polarized microwave
radiation of Sun is relaxed and polarized by the rain, and average relation S2/
S1 ≈0.0528. The radiometers dislocation and choice of its ranges for such
microwave source is actual task of present radiophysics. This task is combined with
the formation of Tj level on the radiometer output as the function of ﬁelds com-
position on its antenna. This composition depends on the character of litter surface
the repeated reﬂections of radiowaves from which are to take into account under the
solution of inverse task arising in the atmosphere radiometry. In the conditions
when the atmosphere-litter surface system has a symmetry by the azimuth, and
when emitting and scattering atmosphere particles are oriented chatically, and the
litter surface is mirrory- or diffusely- reﬂecting, then S1 ≠0, S2 ≠0, S3 = S4 = 0.
When the symmetry by the azimuth is absent, and when atmosphere particles have
the orientation direction differing from vertical, and when spreading surface
roughness is characterized by the asymmetrical distribution of slopes we receive:
S1 ≠0, S2 ≠0, S3 ≠0, S4 ≠0. The fourth Stock’s parameter S4 which characterizes
the polarization ellipticity, becomes unequal to zero when the radiothermal emis-
sion undergoes no less two-fold scattering into the hydrometers volume or on the
surface roughness (Zagorin 1999).
An important stage in precipitation monitoring is clearly optimizing registered
radiation frequencies. This was partly done by Sasaki et al. (1989), who based on
measurements showed that the frequencies near 1 GHz are the most informative.
This result is corroborated by the curves given in Figs. 2.28 and 2.29.
The perspectivism of the radiophysical methods used for the design of an
atmospheric control system is substantiated by the many theoretical and empirical
investigations. The basic problem consists in forming a knowledge base to maintain
correlations between atmospheric characteristics (properties) and the behavior of
electromagnetic waves inside the atmosphere. The basis on which atmospheric
process models have been built reﬂecting the combinations of spatiotemporal scales
is again an important element in the study of these correlations.
As it follows from the investigations by Yakovlev (2001) effective methodics of
the atmosphere monitoring system design is connected with the radio occultation
studies of the atmosphere and ionosphere. The setup necessary to bring about such
measurements is based on placing the transmitter on a satellite orbiting Earth and
placing the receiver on a geostationary satellite. As result such structure secures
continuous regime of atmosphere vertical transection with the obtaining of its
parameters distribution by the altitude. The task is reduced to identifying the values
2.7
The Atmosphere Microwave Monitoring

of these parameters using data about signal absorption and ﬂuctuation as a result of
propagating along the changing tracks between satellites.
The inﬂuence of the atmosphere and ionosphere on the parameters of refraction,
ﬂuctuation, relaxation, absorption, decay, and change in signal frequency has been
studied in detail. Depending on the orbit position of the satellite this inﬂuence
makes it possible to receive data about the atmosphere and ionosphere in concrete
regions of the planet. A total spatial image for part or of the atmosphere can be had
by data processing using GIMS technology.
It is possible to distinguish between the direct and inverse tasks of radio-
translusense. The direct task arises when the atmosphere model is used to determine
the above mentioned changes in electromagnetic waves for a given satellite

trajectory. The inverse task consists in the determination of the atmosphere and
ionosphere parameters through experimental data describing the signal variations.
The method of atmosphere radio-translusense can be used when the microwave
emission receiver is sited on the Earth’s surface. Using the Doppler effect on
wavelength 1.35 cm (22.235 GHz) in this case allows the vertical distribution of
water vapor in the uppermost atmosphere to be received with acceptable precision.
Atmospheric microwave sensing can be expanded to consider the possibility of
estimating a wider set of its parameters. To do so would mean solving a complex
mathematical task connected with the prognosis of the microwaves relaxation
according to sensing routes in the atmosphere. Millimetre range causes special
interest in this respect. According to the investigations by Meriakri (1992) and
Strelkov (1995) many gases have discrete absorption spectre in the waves of mil-
limetre and submillimetre ranges. This allows the average concentration of the gas
component along the sensing route to be calculated based on estimating electro-
magnetic wave absorption. An example of such a calculation is given in Table 2.20.
A special feature of the millimeter range is the possibility to form narrowly
directed radio-bundles because of the relatively small apertures of the emitters. The
task of atmosphere parameter estimation can be transformed to registering varia-
tions in signal relaxation on the sensing route between the receiver and transmitter
followed by solving a suitable integral equation that takes into account the
refraction of electromagnetic waves in the troposphere, cross-diffraction of signal
bundles, and possible variations in the vertical distribution of refraction indicators
along the route. Monitoring systems of low atmosphere also call for the inﬂuence of
land covers on the propagation of millimeter waves to be taken into consideration.
Millimetre and submillimetre ranges under the using of active and passive
sensing regimes ensure the reliable estimation of content in the atmosphere of
certain chlorine compounds, carbon oxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and water
vapors, as well allow to determine the wind spead and temperature (Strelkov 1995,
1996). The prospect of these ranges bringing about bi-static radio-translusense of
the atmosphere is down to the moderate price of ﬁeld measurements and existing
theoretical results concerning the methodologies used to reconstruct atmospheric
spatial distribution parameters along observational routes.

The application of microwave range for the atmosphere diagnostics can not be
effective without the creation of measurement data processing systems. Such sys-
tems are based on simulation models that make reconstructing atmospheric char-
acteristics possible by making good use of multichannel sensing data. What is more,
the obligatory presence of the optical and IR ranges between the channels of such
systems results in an essential gain in monitoring system informativeness.
In framework of the GIMS technology application, a simulation system for the
atmosphere pollution physics (SSAPP) was designed as the experimental system for
the control and identiﬁcation of sources polluting the atmosphere basin (Krapivin
et al. 1996, 1997a, b; Bondur et al. 2009). The SSAPP is intended to reconstruct
multi-component non-stationary pollutant ﬁelds and identify local pollutant sour-
ces. The SSAPP uses the procedure of adaptive synthesis of simulation model
describing the three-components of pollution ﬁeld as basic algorithm. This proce-
dure consists in dynamic development of the simulation model as a result of esti-
mating the divergence between model output and data registered by means of
measuring devices in various ranges of electromagnetic spectrum.
Putting current a priory information about the coordinates of measuring devices,
pollutant sources, and parameters into a simulation model is brought about through
coordination with a topographical map of the territory being controlled. The model
optimization and ranges set control are realized with consideration of the presence
database and available technical resources. The system is adapted automatically to
the spatial scales of territory the pollution of which is simulated. The set of tasks
solved by the SSAPP includes:
• calculation of inﬂuence area for each source included in the system database;
• determination of sensitivity area for each measuring device;
• reconstruction of spatial distribution of pollutants;
• identiﬁcation of the causes behind dangerous pollution zones arizing;
• search of unknown pollution sources.
The SSAPP foundation is set of models describing the atmosphere dynamics and
contaminants spreading over the restricted territory up to whole planet. The meso
and micro levels can be imitated by a set of Gaussian models, the choice of which
depends on the parameters provided by the monitoring system’s database. Global-
and macro-levels of the atmospheric contaminants spreading are described with the
models of Euler and Lagrange types.
2.8 Microwave Radiometry in Remote Monitoring
of the Ocean
The formation of radiothermal ﬁeld emission of the ocean in the microwave range
depends on the water temperature and salinity, surface roughness, concentration of
chlorophyll and other components of oceanic environment. Remote registration of
this ﬁeld demands to take into account also such factors as evaporation, precipitation,

foam-formation, cloudiness, intensity variations of direct and scattered solar radia-
tion. That is why the design of microwave remote monitoring systems on the base of
registration of ocean emission in microwave range comes to the solution of set of
complex mathematical tasks. Parameters reﬂecting the state of the atmosphere-ocean
system have an important inﬂuence on how the spatial structure of the radiothermal
ﬁeld of this system is formed. So, outside zones of rain, snow and hail clouds when
for wavelength λ ≥0.8 cm total absorption by the atmosphere is insigniﬁcant,
phenomenological theory of radiation transmission is applied to determine the
radiobrightness temperatures, Tj, for the atmosphere-ocean system. In zones of drop
clouds presence, relative contribution of scattering processes for the emission on
wavelength λ ≥0.8 cm to the formation of ﬁeld {Tj} consists from 5 to 50 %. This
means that in these zones the scattering effects are to be taken into account under the
microwave radiometry data processing received from the ocean surface.
In common case, when the registration of Tj is realized by satellite-based system
from the height H under the observation angle θ respect to the local vertical for
wavelength λ the following functional correlation of radiobrightness temperature
with thermodynamic and physical characteristics of atmosphere-ocean system is
valid (Savorskij 1992):

and proposed a constructive algorithm to calculate the surface temperature TS with
the measurements of Tj,h and Tj,V under the observation angle θ = 45°: ÒS = (Òj,h)2/
(2Tj,h −Tj,v). This algorithm has the precision less ±3 K. It is valid for the cal-
culation both TSO and land thermodynamic temperature. The Tj practically depends
on TSO linearly with the slope from 0.35 to 0.5. An increase of salinity from 0 to
40 ‰ is provided with the increase of Tj under λ < 3 cm by values no exceeding 3 K
and with essential decrease of Tj under λ ∈[8, 10] cm by the values up to 40 K. The
dependence slope of this decreasing as the function of S is function of TSO.
Knowledge of the radiation dependencies of water surface properties on the total
spectrum of water surface parameters is the essential basis of a radiometric control
system of the ocean surface.
In the case of water object with great conductivity (sea water) for the decimetre
range the following correlation is valid: κ ≅0.5(f/σ)1/2, where f is the radiowave
frequency, σ is the water conductivity. This expression allows to estimate the water
conductivity if the water thermal emission is measured. If the substance dissolved in
the water and its conductivity are known the dissolved substance concentration is

calculated by the using of thermal radioemission. Hence the microwave radiometry
can be used for the monitoring of reservoirs pollution.
The emissive and reﬂective abilities of a sea surface in microwave region is very
connected with ocean environment parameters such as the water temperature,
salinity, dielectric constant, and roughness. Sasaki et al. (1988) shown that 6.7–
18.6 GHz band has high informativity to diagnose the atmosphere-ocean system. It
was established that correlation between radiobrightness temperatures of atmosphere
and sea surface has linear character and that reﬂective ability on horizontal polari-
zation at the frequency 18.6 GHz is higher then on vertical polarization. Moreover, it
is observed that there exists an obvious dependence of radiobrightness temperature
ﬂuctuations of the sea surface on wind speed. It equals for the horizontal polarization
to 0.5 and 1.0 K m−1 s at 6.7 and 18.6 GHz, respectively. In the case of vertical
polarization these values equal to 0.3–0.8 and 0.6–1.5 K m−1s, respectively.
The sensitivity of the sea surface brightness temperature, TBP(K), for the
polarization P-type to the variations in the wind speed, V(m s−1) is determined by
value (Figs. 2.30 and 2.31):

where ai (i = 1, …, k) are the oceanic environmental parameters contributing to
TBP change except for wind speed. The value of ω is almost linearly correlated with
wind speed at constant sea surface temperature and salinity, so @2TBP=@V2  0.
Then TBP ¼ TBOPðhÞ þ V@TBPðhÞ=@V, where TBOP is the brightness temperature of
the calm sea surface (K), θ is the zenith angle of incident radiation. According to the
Kirchoff’s law we have the following wind speed sensitivity of reﬂectiv-
ity:@cPðhÞ=@V ¼ @ePðhÞ=@V. It gives the following expression for reﬂectivity at

Under conditions of wind-induced sea roughness, when sea wave are so big that
radio waves of the centimeter and decimeter ranges cannot be used, scattering and
emission characteristics can be estimated by means of Kirchoff’s approximation.
In the range of centimetre waves, where electrophysical properties of water are
comparatively known, the expression (2.7) allows to determine water surface
temperature when its radiothermal emission is measured.
In common case the task of ocean surface diagnosis comes to the reverse of
function Tj = F(a1, …, ak) in the relation of geophysical parameters set {ai}. The
function F reﬂects the type of aquatory radiation model. Linear models allowing to

calculate a standard deviation of Tj are widely used: δi = kiδai, ki = ∂F/∂ai, where δai
is the standard deviation of parameter ai. The estimations of κi are given by Nelepo
et al. (1985).
Having synthesized a radiation model, F can then be used to control ocean
surface pollution and the atmosphere-ocean system is considered as a three-layers
environment: atmosphere-pollutant-water. For calculation of Frenel’s coefﬁcients
to estimate the emittive property κλ of this system, knowledge of the dielectric
permeability of the pollutant layer is needed. Therefore, for oil spills in the
microwave range there is weak dependence of the dielectric constant on λ and the
values of losses are typically small. For example, the raw oil spill is characterized
by value Reελ ∈[1.6, 3]. Speciﬁcally, for λ = 0.8 cm we have ελ = δi = kiδai,
ki = ∂F/∂ai. Certainly ελ is changed depending on the oil quality and time interval of
its placing in the water.
Any pollutant of water environment forms on the water surface some emulsion
layer which exists during certain time interval. Dielectric permeability of this layer
can be calculated by means of the mixture formula: ελ = [(1 −W1)(ελ,1)1/3 + W1
(ε λ,2)1/3]3, where W1 is the water content in the emulsion volume, ελ,1 and ελ,2 are
the dielectric permeabilities of pollutant and water, respectively. Figure 2.32
demonstrates the frequency of ελ for the case of oil pollution.
The methodics of radiation model synthesis for three-layers environment is
applied to the microwave diagnostics of the ice cover. Here ελ is explained as
dielectric permeability of the ice layer (Melentyev et al. 1998).
Variety of theoretical and experimental investigations of the ocean/atmosphere
system includes the application of remote sensing technologies based on microwave
monitoring. For example, Grankov and Milshin (2009) studied experimentally (in
the laboratory) a behavior of characteristics of the water surface being initially
under the room temperature and sharply cooled with liquid nitrogen: variations of
an intensity of natural microwave radiation at the wavelength 2.25 cm and infrared
heat radiation in the window 10.5 μm, as well as a value of the heat content

(enthalpy) in the upper water surface layer. A comparison of evolutions of the heat
contents computed from the difference between temperatures of upper and bottom
boundaries of the subsurface layer with evolutions of microwave and infrared
radiation intensity is conducted.
Here, it is again necessary to remark that difference between microwave and
infrared ranges consists in their response on the atmosphere state:
• intensity of super high frequency is deﬁned by means of the product of emis-
sivity coefﬁcient (κ) and thermodynamic temperature (T) within the limits of
efﬁcient radiation layer (lef) where dTb/dT ≤0.5 and lef equals to the part of
centimeter; and
• IR-range methods can be used only in the cases when the atmosphere is free
from aerosols, hydrometeors, and clouds as well as lef equals to the part of
millimeter.
Usually, the values of sensible qh and latent qe heat at the air-sea boundary are
calculated by means of well known in the meteorology formulae:
qh ¼ cp q ct ts  ta

where ta is the air temperature, P is the atmospheric pressure; e is the atmosphere

temperature, eo is the the air humidity, ct is the numbers of Schmidt (heat
exchange), ce is the number of Dalton (moisture exchange), L is the speciﬁc heat of
evaporation, cp is the speciﬁc air heat under constant pressure, and ρ is the atmo-
sphere density.
Formulae (2.10) can be used for calculation of sensible and latent heat ﬂuxes
only in aquatories that are serviced by meteorological stations. Figure 2.33 repre-
sents such calculations for NDBC SMKF1 during hurricane Katrina evolution.
Capability of satellite SHF-radiometric methods to evaluate the characteristics of
large-scale heat and dynamic interaction of the atmosphere and ocean is based on
the use of resonance absorption of radiowaves 1.35 cm by atmospheric moisture. In
this case different models are used (Skou 2008; Pampaloni and Paloscia 2000). One
of such simple model is usually used:
I ¼ I1 þ I2 þ I3

2.9 An Adaptive Technology to Classify and Interpret
Remote-Sensing Data of the Water Surface
Qualitatively
Collecting and processing information in a geoinformation monitoring system can
only be done by effective monitoring of the object under consideration and involves
using simulation modeling, information collecting, and information processing
(Armand et al. 1987; Burkov and Krapivin 2009).
From the position of system analysis, the system of collection and processing of
the information in geoinformation monitoring represents the structure uniting the
computers of various classes, databases and the advanced problem-oriented soft-
ware. Creation of such system demands the development of formalized description
of the information ﬂows and unique methodology of its processing.
Development of geoinformation monitoring systems requires the decision of a
set of problems related to the formation of data measurement ﬂows to be solved.
The problem of classiﬁcation of aquatories using the remote sensing measurements
is one of important among them. Various algorithms of the theory of image rec-
ognition, statistical decisions and cluster analysis are used to solve this problem.
At the present time, there are many image recognition methods, mainly because
of the variety of statements about concrete tasks. The problem of recognition
consists in the division of some group of objects into the classes at the base of
certain requirements. The objects having general properties are related to one class.
An initial data for the solution of a recognition problem are results of some
observations or the direct measurements that are named initial attributes.
Method of taxonomy (clustering) is one of the important methods of recognition
and classiﬁcation of images.
Let’s assume set of M it is required to divide by not crossed subsets (clusters),
and the elements included in the same clusters should be close to each other enough
from the point of view of the chosen criterion of nearness, and elements from
different clusters should be far enough from each other. In one of many possible
statements of this task two numbers, a and b (0 < a < b), are given. It is considered,
that two elements x and y are close to each other enough, if p(x, y) < a, and are far
enough from each other, if p(x, y) > b.
King’s method is well known in taxonomy and gives good results when the
quantity of available information in assumed clusters is moderate. According to this
method the distance between groups of points in space of attributes is deﬁned as
distance between centers of masses of these groups. Clustering in this case is based
on the assumption that sites of the increased density in the space of attributes
correspond to similar situations.
The feature of remote measurements is information acquisition, when the data of
measurements, acquired during tracing of ﬂying system along routes of survey, are
directed to input of the processing system. As result the two dimensional image of
investigated object is registered. Statistical model of spottiness for investigated
space is one of models for this image.

Remote-Sensing Technologies and Data Processing Algorithms

In real conditions, the study of spots, the acquiring of their statistical charac-
teristics and their using in a problem of detection is enough a complex problem.
Criteria have to be developed to distinguish spots from other phenomena. For
example, it is necessary to determine such threshold the exceeding of which is the
spot indicator. Also it is necessary to develop model presentation of processes of
spots detection.
The method of the thresholds determination is the most obvious and simple way
for spots deﬁnition. In this case that part of space belongs to area of spots, on which
the parameter of environment measured within the chosen channel exceeds value
(l+) or, on the contrary, does not exceed value (l−) a threshold. Let y = y (x1, x2) is
function of coordinates (x1, x2) of points within considered region. If “level surface”
y = const is outlined at the region surface, then the closed curves of level y that
bound the spots are projected on it.
Algorithms for simulation of spottiness are based on the numerical solution of
the algebraic inequalities determining coordinates of internal points of spots. It is
impossible to write the equation of spots contours in a general.
Therefore contours of spots are described by system of the simple algebraic
equations connected among themselves by equation Σφi(x, y) = 0, where φi(x, y) is
the equation of an elementary curve. For simpliﬁcation of software realization of
simulation of spottiness image as the equations φi(x, y) the equation of a circle with
varied coordinates of the centre and radius is accepted. Complex forms of spots are
formed by overlapping on a plane of the drawing of several circles with different
parameters that is deﬁned by system of inequalities of a kind:
X
x  ai
ð
Þ2þ y  bi
ð
Þ2ri
n
o
 0
where x, y are the cartesian coordinates of internal points of spots, ai, bi, and ri are
coordinates of the centre and radius ith circle, respectively, n is quantity of the
circles composing the modeled image.
To simulate the randomness of background distribution for spottiness the
spottiness model parameters ai, bi, and ri are set by means of random-number
generators. By changing laws of distribution of random numbers and their statistical
parameters, it is possible to receive statistically different spottiness images.
The list of software items of the simulation system for classiﬁcation of the
phenomena on a terrestrial surface is given in Table 2.21. An important point about
the system’s algorithms and the software is the possibility of spatial interpolation
and data restoration using remote and in situ measurements.
One of main aspects of the practical importance of developed system is quali-
tative interpretation and visualization of results of remote measurements.
For primary processing of remote measurements it is useful to apply an owerage-
connecting method of cluster analysis to detect the speciﬁc informational zones.
That method is effective under small volumes of sampling. Two variants of this
approach can be brought about by the way in which algorithms and index spaces
are organized.
2.9
An Adaptive Technology to Classify …
187

In the system designed to classify phenomena on a terrestrial surface automat-
ically the two variants of this approach are program modules CASRS and CALRS,
distinguished by the way in which attribute spaces and comparison algorithms are
organized.
Software item CASRS is focused on the attribute space of remote sensors. The
CALRS module allocates areas of equal instability based on local variations in
sensor data. Distinction between the algorithms of comparison in these items
consists in the taking into account or neglecting of interrelations of the neigh-
bouring counts of sensors. Item CASRS forms clusters without taking into account
a geographical generality of radiometers indications. Item CALRS forms continu-
ous spatial clusters.
CASRS and CALRS automatically exclude from consideration the calibrations
information. Item CASRS consists from six groups of operators. The ﬁrst group
carries out the organization of data ﬁles. Averaging of the information using ﬁnal
set of radiometer readings is made by the second group of operators. The third
group of operators ﬁnds minimal cluster distances then two points on which this
distance is realized are allocated. The fourth group of operators investigates
changes of minimal cluster distances on the given step of procedure and in case of
occurrence of sharp changes carries out visualization of clusters structure. The ﬁfth
group of operators unites the nearest clusters and recalculates their characteristics.
The sixth group of operators develops a criterion for the algorithm to stop.
Analysis of statistical characteristics of “spottiness” for three types of areas of
Atlantic and Paciﬁc oceans was conducted. These statistical characteristics were
determined for the most informative thresholds. At that time statistical character-
istics of “spottiness” for the same areas, selected using criteria of minimal value of
coefﬁcient of correlation for joint sample of positive and negative spots. Analysis of
these characteristics showed, that the statistical characteristics of “spottiness”
coincide for areas with temperate sea roughness and storm zones. Minimum for the
coefﬁcient of correlation ρmin is run down for a case of most informative thresholds.
But for quiet area the situation is different.

From the aforesaid follows that statistical characteristics for “spottiness” of
brightness temperatures in microwaves can be used for detection and classiﬁcation
of the phenomena on a surface of the ocean that was caused by a degree of sea
roughness.
Analysis of empirical histograms for spottiness of brightness temperatures in
microwaves shows that in most cases (l+, l−) are characteristics that can be coor-
dinated with the exponential distribution while their amplitude can be coordinated
with the normal distribution. Therefore, to detect and classify phenomena on ocean
surfaces it is necessary to apply the best possible algorithms when programming/
teaching the computer to make statistical decisions about distributions.
2.10 A Device to Measure Geophysical and Hydrophysical
Parameters
According to algorithms of the multi-channel microwave monitoring discussed by
Krapivin and Shutko (2012), it is possible to promptly measure the wind speed, sea
surface roughness and water temperature as the base characteristics to calculate
other parameters of the environment. From these measurements, a mutual control of
the accuracy of correction of the estimates of the atmosphere-ocean gas exchange is
realized. Solution of the correction equations in a general case requires the use of
the criterion of discrepancy between theoretical and empirical estimates of the
parameters or correlations. Usually for this purpose, a criterion of mean square
deviation is used. The reliability and efﬁciency of determination of solutions for the
system of equations relating the theoretical and empirical estimates can be increased
if their dispersive characteristics are taken as a criterion of discrepancy of these
solutions (Nitu et al. 2013a).
Let the proper emission of the sea be measured simultaneously with the help of
n radiometers, each operating at a ﬁxed wavelength λj (j = 1, …, n). As a result at the
moment ti at the output of each radiometer the values Zij (i = 1, …, M) are ﬁxed, so that
Zij = Tj + ξij, where Tj is the brightness temperature of a sea site at the wavelength λj,
and ξij is the random value (noise) with the zero mean and dispersion r2
j .
Let the correlation between the brightness temperature and m parameters of the
sea be linear:

For the real use of this algorithm in the radiometric monitoring system the fol-
lowing arrangement can be suggested. Put the n-channel commutation unit and
n units of dispersion calculation between the outputs of radiometers and respective
inputs of the microprocessor in series. At the radiometers’ inputs we plug in
switches, which are connected through a control unit with the ﬁrst group of outputs
of the microprocessor, and to the second group of the microprocessor’s outputs are
linked up the resolver, whose second group of outputs is connected, respectively,
with the radiometers’ outputs. Each unit to calculate dispersion consists of the
in-series connected quantizers of the mean value calculator, divisor, summator and
second divisor, and the quantizers output is connected with the second input of the
summator. The resolver consists of identical channels, each containing a summator,
n outputs of which are connected with n multipliers. Some inputs of the multipliers
form the ﬁrst group of the resolver’s inputs, others—the second group of its inputs,
the number of channels being equal to the number of the parameters to be measured.
Figure 2.34 shows the structural scheme of an arrangement to measure the
parameters of geophysical and hydrophysical objects. The scheme in Fig. 2.35
explains the structure of the unit to calculate dispersion. The resolver is charac-
terized in Fig. 2.36. The apparatus operates as follows. When radiometers 1 are
calibrated, the signals Zij from their outputs through the multi-channel switching
unit 2 enter the unit 3 of the dispersion calculator. The antennas are switched off
from radiometers. In unit 3 the dispersion is calculated using the algorithm.

enter the control unit 6 which forms the signal that switches off radiometers 1, for
which the partial coefﬁcients are equal or close to zero, that is, the information
channels automatically get excluded. At the same time, the systems of equations to
be solved get compressed. This step makes it possible to contract not only the
volume of calculations but also to increase the accuracy of estimating the param-
eters of the environmental objects being sounded.

Once dispersions have been determined, the commutator 2 blocks the input of
data from non-information channels. The data from information channels enter the
resolver 5. The signal at the multiplier’s output corresponds to the value of one of
the parameters to be estimated.
2.11 Direct and Inverse Problems of Microwave
Monitoring
2.11.1 Typical Inverse Task of the Microwave Radiometry
An approach to the inverse problem of microwave monitoring is based on assuming
a linear functional correlation between radiobrightness contrasts and the charac-
teristics of the monitored object. The search of analytical relationships relating the
radiobrightness temperature of the environment to its thermodynamic and electro-
physical characteristics covers more general classes of the functional models. The
most general form of such dependence is as follows:
Tbi ¼ ji

ð2:13Þ
where T(h) is the thermodynamic proﬁle of the environment, Tbi is the radiobrightness
temperature at the frequency νi, γi(h) is the proﬁle of the absorption coefﬁcient of the
environment, κi is the emissivity of the environment.

Relationship (2.13) makes it possible using T(h) and γi(h) to ﬁnd Tbi (direct
problem) and by Tbi to calculate T(h) and γi(h) (inverse problem). The proposed
method to solve these problems is based on the use of T(h) and γi(h) and their
derivatives at the point h = 0 with some additional limitations resulting from the
transformations made below. Write the relationship (2.13) in the form:

2.11.2 Estimation of Radiobrightness Response Function
of the Ocean-Atmosphere System on Variations
in Heat Fluxes
The problem of using the satellite passive microwave radiometric methods for the
analysis of the roles of the ocean and atmosphere (in respect of their priority) in heat
interaction over various space and time scales is one of important for solution in
tropical cyclogenesis. This problem is long attracts the specialists engaged in the
oceanology, meteorology, atmospheric sciences, etc. Some data of measurements
from the Meteor-3M MTVZA device (Module of Temperature and Vlazhnost
(humidity) Zonding of the Atmosphere), data of the DMSP (SSM/I) and EOS-Aqua
(AMSR-E) radiometers can be used for solving this problem.

The phenomena of a time delay of the ocean/atmosphere system brightness
temperature response in the resonant spectral domains 5.9 and 13.5 mm on the
variations of surface heat ﬂuxes is described by the Duamel’s integral equation:
Tbðt; kÞ ¼
Zt
0
qðsÞrðt  sÞds
ð2:23Þ
were Tb(t,λ) is radiobrightness temperature for wavelength λ (K), q(t) is heat ﬂux on
the ocean-atmosphere interface (W/m2/h), τ is time delay (hours), r(t) is response
delay function (K/(W/m2/h)).
Solution of Eq. (2.23) can be theoretically realized by traditional methods which
are used for solution of inverse tasks in the form of integral equation of the ﬁrst
type. But in real case, functions Tb(t,λ) and q(t) have discrete form as restricted in
the time numerical sets. Therefore, traditional methods such as Laplace transfor-
mation or iterative procedure (Tricomi 1960) lead to large errors. More effective
method for solution of Eq. (2.23) was proposed by Grankov and Soldatov (2005). It
consists in the use of exponential approximation:

Numerical calculations in Fig. 2.37 show that such approach to solution of
Eq. (2.23) gives errors no more 5–7 %. We see that time delay exists between
radiobrightness temperature and heat ﬂux. This is important for calibration of
satellite measurements. Calculation of the function r(t) of the brightness tempera-
ture Tb response (sensitivity) to the total heat ﬂuxes q the variation is clearly
demonstrated. In this case, brightness temperatures were calculated from the
oceanographic, meteorological, and aerological data, observed in the experiment
with ATLANTEX-90 synchronized with use of the DMSP F-08 heat ﬂuxes data
q obtained from the vessel Victor Bugaev during the cyclone of 9–13 April 1990.

2.12 Algorithms for Remote Data Processing
2.12.1 Introduction
Spatial reconstruction of the vegetation radiometric image, based on fragmentary
data, demands the development of new algorithms. There exist many approaches to
this task. For example, Yoshioka (2004) discussed the problem of extraction of
useful information from satellite imageries by means of algebraic manipulation.
The concept of vegetation isolines was underpinned for the three-layer system

soil-canopy-atmosphere. The relationship between the reﬂectances at two different
wavelengths (650 and 940 nm) over this system comprising atmosphere, canopy,
and soil layers was derived. Below several algorithms are proposed.
Realization of measurements usually is connected with complex model choice
and its planning. Evaluation of initial data and coefﬁcients for model needs the
statistical method application. Here, the task of representative sampling deﬁnition is
arisen. Important problem consists in the choice of criterion that gives a possibility
to form this sample. One of possible criterion is based on calculation of value of


=Sn, where n is the average value,

n ¼ 1

Formation of representative sampling is realized with the following rule: if
R ≤R0 then ξi is registered and is taken into account as effective signal; if R > R0
then ξI is considered as noise and does not ﬁx into set {ξi}. Parameter R0 is deﬁned
in Table 2.22.
It is evident that statistical data that is used to draw conclusions and inferences
should be accurate and consistent. This is important in order to ensure the validity
of all the inferences drawn on the basis of the raw data. Statistical analysis as a
research methodology for ecological studies comes into collision with the problem
of raw data non-stationary what needs new approaches and tools for the decision
making and scientiﬁc conclusions.
2.12.2 Data Reconstruction Using the Harmonic Functions
The process of spreading of heat in the plane homogeneous media G with constant
thermophysical characteristics (density ρ, speciﬁc heat C and conductivity coefﬁ-
cient K; ρ, C, K = const > 0) is described by the equation:
@T=@t ¼ a2ð@2T=@u2 þ @2T=@k2Þ;
ð2:24Þ
where T = T(φ,λ,t) is the temperature of the media at the point with spatial coor-
dinates (φ,λ) ∈G at time t; a2 = K/Cρ is the temperature-conductivity coefﬁcient of
G, φ and λ are the latitude and longitude respectively.

If the thermal transport process is stationary then Eq. (2.24) transforms to the
Laplace equation:
div  gradT ¼ @2T=@u2 þ @2T=@k2
ð2:25Þ
The solution of Eq. (2.25) is the harmonic function of the spatial coordinates φ and
λ. In accordance with the Rayleigh-Jeans law (DeWitt and Nutter 1988) the brightness
temperature as a result of remote microwave measurements is Ta(φ,λ) = Ta(φ,λ,μ,θ),
where μ is the wavelength, θ is the observation angle and (μ,θ = const). It is proposed
that for the any small area VM at an arbitrary point M ∈G the brightness temperature is
a linear function of the temperature of the media:
Taðu; kÞ ¼ AM þ BMTðu; kÞ;
ðu; kÞ 2 VM;
ð2:26Þ
where AM and BM are constants.
Formula (2.26) follows from the theoretical and experimental estimations of Ta
(Krapivin and Potapov 2001; Burkov and Krapivin 2009). For media which are
homogeneous in depth, the formula Ta = κT is valid. Here κ = κ(μ,θ,ε) is the media
radiation coefﬁcient where ε is the dielectrical permeability. According to the
experimental estimations the radiance of fresh water measured by means of radi-
ometers with wavelengths of 5–8 cm is a linear function of T. The slope of this
dependence is 0.35–0.50 K/°C. An increase in the water salinity S from 0 to 16 ‰ is
accompanied by a decrease in the sensitivity of the irradiation ﬁeld to the temperature
variations. This effect is observed for wavelengths from 10 to 50 cm. The sensitivity
of the irradiation ﬁeld to variations in T is a minimum when the following conditions
are realized: μS ≅700; 0 ≤T ≤30 °C; 0 ≤S ≤180 ‰; 0 ≤θ ≤25°.
From Eq. (2.26) it follows that Ta at every point M ∈G satisﬁes the following
condition:
Taðu; kÞ ¼ 1
2p
Z2p
0
Taðu þ r  cos a; k þ r  sin aÞda;
where the integral is over a circle of radius r centered at (φ,λ).
This condition is valid for any r (0 < r < rM) where rM is the radius of the area
VM. Therefore Ta is a harmonic function within G. A typical task here is the search
of the harmonic function Ta(φ, λ) within G when Taðu; kÞ ¼ ~TaðuÞ on the boundary
Γ of G (u ∈Γ, u = φ + iλ). Such a function is the real part of some analytic function
W(z) given by:

lðfÞ=ðf  zÞdf;
ð2:27Þ
where μ(ζ) is the real density, ζ ∈Γ and z = φ + iλ is an arbitrary internal point of
G. We have Re[W(u)] and Im [dζ∕(ζ – u)] = −cos(r,n)dσ/r where r is the distance
between ζ and u, dσ is an element of Γ and n is the external normal to Γ. As z →u

2.12.3 Method for Parametric Identiﬁcation
of Environmental Objects
Radiometers determine the brightness temperatures Zij (i = 1, …, M; j = 1, …, n)
given by Zij = Tj + ξij, where M is the number of measurements, n is number of
radiometers, Tj is the real value of the brightness temperature for wavelength μj and
ξij is the noise with zero mean and dispersion σj. The problem is to determine the
correlation function Tj = fj(X), where X = {x1, …., xm} are geophysical, ecological,
biogeochemical or other parameters. There are many algorithms for the deﬁnition of
the function f. As a general rule, the mean-square criterion is used for this purpose.
But such an approach has one defect: the impossibility of taking the dispersion
properties of the noise Ε = {ξij} into consideration.
Let the function f be linear. Then we have the following system of equations for
parameters Aij:
k Aij k X ¼ T þ E

It is necessary to solve Eq. (2.28) such that its solution has minimum dispersion.

2.12.4 Method of Differential Approximation
Databases of the environment monitoring systems not always correspond to the
parametrical fullness in framework of the GIMS technology standard. Therefore an
algorithm that allows to adapt the database to this standard is considered. Let us
suppose that N characteristics, xi (i = 1, …, N), of environment are measured at the
times ts (s = 1, …, M). Formal dependence between xi is represented by the system
of differential equations with unknown coefﬁcients {aijk, bij}:

The Newton-Raphson method (Ram 2010) gives a possibility to solve system

2.12.5 Quasi-Linearization Method
The number of problems that crop up in ecoinformatics leads to the necessity of
integrating generally non-linear integro-differential equations; but, in a majority of
cases, these equations are not integrable by elementary or special functions. To
solve them, as a rule, it is necessary to make use of the latest achievements of
calculating methods and technics. In many problems the use of well-known
numerical methods to solve initial value problems—even by means of modern high-
speed electronic computers—does not come up with desired results. The existing
approximate methods of solving integro-differential equations are based as rule on
replacing derivatives by ﬁnite differences and represent a complicated multi-step
process, which in practical problems cannot be solved on computers reasonably
quickly. Therefore in solving practical problems we have to search other means of
approximate solutions for integro-differential equations, without using the ﬁnite-
difference methods.
In the method considered here, the integro-differential equation is substituted in
each subinterval of the independent variable by an easily integrable ordinary dif-
ferential equation with constant coefﬁcients; this method is not a new theoretical
idea for it was known to Euler. However, here the error estimations are obtained for
the ﬁrst time, and methods applicable to various problems are developed in detail.

The initial conditions are

Assuming that Eq. (2.49) with the initial conditions (2.52) has a unique con-

divide the interval [a,b] by a sequence of points x0 = a, x1, …, xm = b, hk = xk+1 −xk.
On each subinterval [xk,xk+1], k = 0, 1, …, m −1 let us replace Eq. (2.49) by the
following linear differential equation of the nth order with constant coefﬁcients

where the constants are determined from the initial conditions at the beginning of

the kernek G(x,y) and g(x) are twice continuously differentiable functions of x,
G(x,x) ≠0. Then, as it is known, Eqs. (2.74) and (2.75) have unique solutions
φ1(x) and φ2(x) respectively which are continuous and differentiable in [a,b] for any
value of λ. The case when G(x,x) = 0 for some point in the interval [a,b] or for the
entire interval needs special consideration. In our case, Eq. (2.74) is equivalent to

Therefore, the argument used to ﬁnd an approximate solution of (2.75) is valid
for Eq. (2.74) as well.
In traditional way the Eq. (2.75) is solved by replacing the integral of the
equation by a ﬁnite sum of some quadratic formula. Applying this approach let us
divide the interval [a,b] by a sequence of points x0 ¼ a\x1\x2\    \xm ¼ b
into elementary intervals Δj = [xj,xj+1], and instead of (2.75) let us write the

Chapter 3
Environmental Decision-Making
3.1 Introduction
Environmental decisions are made based on different kinds of information. In a
speciﬁc decision-making situation the choice of the appropriate tool depends on the
decision context. In fact, there are numerous available tools which provide decision
support. Adoption and substantiation of decisions are essential parts of the whole set
of tasks related to artiﬁcial intelligence. Decision making procedures play a key role
as far as classiﬁcation and recognition tasks are concerned. In suppressing number of
cases, decision rules are synthesized under the assumption that characteristics
describing the objects for study are independent. In the case of environmental
monitoring, the characteristics of nature and man-made systems are strongly corre-
lated. Therefore, in this case, decision-making procedures have to be stable and take
into account evolution processes.
In artiﬁcial intelligence, an expert system is a computer system which emulates
the decision-making ability of a human expert (Jackson 1999; Murphy 2012; Russel
and Norvig 2009). Expert systems are designed to solve complex problems by
reasoning about knowledge, like an expert, and not by following the procedure of a
developer as in the case of conventional programming. Both knowledge base and
decision making procedures are crucial in expert system technology. Expert sys-
tems operate like a human brain and thus they offer many advantages for users
when compared to traditional programs.
Every expert system has a major ﬂaw, which explains its low success despite the
principles on which it is based having existed for 70 years: knowledge collection
and its interpretation into rules, or knowledge engineering. Most developers have
no automated method to perform this task; instead they work manually, increasing
the likelihood of errors. Expert knowledge is generally not well understood. For
instance, rules may either be contradictory or poorly written and as a result unus-
able, or they even may not exist. Worse still, most expert systems use a compu-
tational engine incapable of reasoning. As a result, an expert system often works

poorly and the project is abandoned (Laudon 2011). However, correct development
methodology can mitigate these problems. There exists software capable of inter-
viewing a true expert on a subject and automatically writing the rule or knowledge
base, depending on the answers. The expert system can then be simultaneously run
before the true expert’s eyes, performing a consistency of rules check. Experts and
users can check the quality of the software before it is ﬁnished.
The main mission of expert systems is to automatize and to computerize the
decision making processes in different applied areas. The applications of expert
systems ﬁnd their way into most applications. For example, Karasulu and Kor-
ukoglu (2012) applied subtraction method that uses the frame differencing in order
to develop an expert system for moving object detection. The basic idea is to
subtract the current frame from a background image and to classify each pixel either
as foreground or as background by comparing the difference with a threshold.
Therefore, the moving object is detected and tracked by using frame differencing
and by learning an updated background model. In addition, simulated annealing is
an optimization technique for soft computing in the artiﬁcial intelligence area. This
expert system can be used for tropical cyclone tracking.
There are numerous expert systems in different practical applications of
knowledge. Such systems are used for prospecting medical diagnosis or as edu-
cational aids. Moreover, they are used in engineering and manufacture in the
control of robots, where they interrelate with vision systems. The initial attempts to
apply artiﬁcial intelligence to generalized problems made limited progress. How-
ever, more signiﬁcant progress could be made in a restricted ﬁeld of interest.
The period from the end of the 20th century to the beginning of the 21st century
is characterized not only by the exacerbation of the environment but also by
prognosis of negative consequences in global scale, because of anthropogenic
impacts. Particularly, this exacerbation was intensiﬁed after the Kyoto Protocol. A
settlement of arising disputes concerning the processes of the environment evolu-
tion is undoubtedly related to the efﬁciency of environmental monitoring systems
synthesis, on which remote sensing technologies—both passive and active type—
depend (Krapivin et al. 2009b, 2010a, 2011).
Methodical support of remote sensing systems of land covers and radio-com-
munication stations by data about the character of screening effect of the vegetation
cover at ﬁxed moment of the time and in the concrete geographical point, requires
the development of a technology which could reconstruct spatial images using the
episodic in the time and fragmentary in the space observations.
The environmental monitoring regime can foresee decision making situations in
real time based on the data accumulated up until the moment of the decision making
or as a result of the prior data analysis without correlation to the current time. The
statistical analysis of several events monitored by the system can be carried out by
numerous methods. The applicability of these methods is determined in each case
by a set of probabilistic parameters which characterize the phenomenon under
study. However, non-steady state and parametrical uncertainty demand a search for
new methods capable of making the decision using fragmentary time and space
data. Such methods are proposed by a sequential analysis and evolutionary

technology (Bukatova et al. 1991; Nitu et al. 2004; Lai 2001; Soldatov 2010, 2011;
Soldatov et al. 2010a, b; Moberg 2006).
With the development of alternative methods of making statistical decisions, the
problem of searching an objective estimation of the parameters of the processes
taking place in the environment has obtained a new substantiation. This problem
can be approached by two methods; on the one hand, a classical one based on the
procedure of a-priori limitation of the number of observations, and on the other
hand a successive analysis based on the procedure of the step-by-step resolve
making. The development of computer technologies enables one to realize both
approaches in the form of a single system of making statistical decisions.
Making decisions on detection of some effect in the process of continuous
environmental monitoring depends on the scheme of measurements organization.
The classical approach directs the observation system to a collection of a ﬁxed
volume of data, with their subsequent processing revealing certain effects or
properties in the area under study. The method of successive analysis does not
divide these stages but it alternates them. In other words, the monitoring data
processing is carried out after each measurement. Hence, the algorithmic load in the
successive procedure changes dynamically, whereas in a classical case the data are
processed at a ﬁnal stage. From the viewpoint of the formation of the structure of an
adequate automated resolver, these approaches should be realized in the form of
individual units, the choice between which can vary in the monitoring dynamics.
However, for this purpose high professionalism is required. Therefore, in the
proposed structure of the resolver the operator only controls the parameters of the
choice between the alternative hypotheses.
The decision theory makes us consider the above-formulated problem of using
sequential analysis in the procedure of the choice between the competing hypoth-
eses in a more general form and with regard to all aspects appearing in such a
problem. The list of the problems which should be solved before making a resolve
covers the following subjects:
• selection of an efﬁcient criterion to estimate the parameters;
• determination of the character of probabilistic characteristics of the process
under study;
• a-priori assessment of possible losses on the accuracy of decisions.
One of the features of the automated system of making statistical resolves is the
presence of a wide spectrum of functions, which should—if possible—provide a
solution for most of intermediate and ﬁnal problems of assessment of the situation
in the monitoring regime. Therefore, the system should include the following units:
(1) visualization of the measured data in the form of direct images, histograms,
sum and frequencies by time intervals;
(2) calculation of statistical characteristics of the observation results (mean, dis-
persion, moments of the third and higher order, excess, coefﬁcient of asym-
metry, entropy, etc.);
(3) construction of empirical density and function of probabilities distribution;
3.1
Introduction
223

(4) construction of theoretical distribution of probabilities with its assessment by
one of the statistical criteria;
(5) calculation of characteristics for the procedure of adopting hypotheses by the
Neyman-Pearson classical method with the resulting assessment of the pro-
cedure by the current volume of samples;
(6) calculation of characteristics of the procedure of successive analysis and
visualization of its state;
(7) realization of the functions of the operator’s access to the system’s units at any
step of the system’s functioning with possibilities to make resolves on
changing the parameters of the procedure or ceasing measurements; and
(8) visualization of the resolves.
This set of units ensures the formation of the model of the measurement pro-
cedure depending on the a-priori information about the parameters and the character
of the process under study. At the same time, the operator is able to test the
accuracy of the input information and promptly change the strategy of monitoring.
On the whole, the set of the indicated units is an automated system for making
statistical decisions.
Moberg (2006) considered environmental systems analysis (ESA) tools as a
quantitative and multidisciplinary research ﬁeld aimed at combining, interpreting
and communicating knowledge from the natural and social sciences and technology.
In other words, ESA delivers methods and tools for the environmental assessment of
human‐made systems using a systems perspective. Between the tools that are most
frequently used, Moberg (2006) indicated on the following tools:
• SEA (Strategic Environmental Assessment) that is a procedural tool for han-
dling environmental (and sustainability) aspects in strategic decision‐making
(policies, programmes and plans); and
• EIA (Environmental Impact Assessment) that is a procedural tool required by
law in some situations and that describes the environmental impact of a sug-
gested project and its alternatives (e.g., the construction and localization of a
waste incineration plant).
In general, not only these but also other tools play a crucial role in managing and
minimizing the risk and the uncertainty arising because of the environmental decision
making procedures. Uncertainty, which may be both scientiﬁcally and socially based,
is a typical feature of decision-making processes. Speciﬁcally, environmental
decisions are complex, since environment comprises many components, numerous
processes, complex interconnections and feedback mechanisms. Uncertainty concept
has different forms and kinds. The main problem of environmental decision-making is
how the uncertainty can be reduced. This chapter describes constructive algorithms
and methods as a solution to this problem.

3.2 Procedures for Classical and Sequential
Decision-Making
3.2.1 Classical Neyman-Pearson Decision-Making Procedure
The classical decision-making procedure is based on the given volume, n, of the
measurements. The value of n is determined by a priori information about
the probability density function fa(x1, …, xn) where the random variables {xi} are
the observation data. The hypotheses H0 and H1 are that a 0 or a 1 is prescribed,
respectively. The distinction between these hypotheses is based on the synthesis of
the boundary for the optimal critical area, E1, in the hyper-surface of the form:
Ln ¼ Ln x1; . . .; xn
ð
Þ ¼ fa1 x1; . . .; xn
ð
Þ=fa0 x1; . . .; xn
ð
Þ ¼ C
ð3:1Þ
where
fa x1; . . .; xn
ð
Þ ¼

n
i¼1
fa xi
ð Þ;
fa(x) is the probability density function of the variable x with the unknown
parameter a and C is a constant determined under the condition that E1 has a given
level of the error of the ﬁrst kind α.
The ratio of conditional probabilities in Eq. (3.1), which is called likelihood
ratio, provides the ﬁnal choice between the above hypotheses:
(1) if Ln ≤C then hypothesis H0 is accepted,
(2) if Ln > C then hypothesis H1 is chosen.
In general, there are many criteria such as Bayesian minimum error, minimax,
etc. Dalton and Dougherty (2011) derived a closed-form analytic representation of
the Bayesian minimum mean-square error estimator for linear classiﬁcation
assuming Gaussian models. This is presented in a general framework permitting a
structure on the covariance matrices and a very ﬂexible class of prior parameter
distributions with four free parameters. Closed-form solutions are provided for
known scaled identity and arbitrary covariance matrices. Minimax theory is
developed in the framework of game theory (Krapivin 1972; Krapivin and Klimov
1995, 1997; Myerson 1997).
The content of hypotheses H0 and H1 depends on the speciﬁc conditions of the
task. In fact, there are two steps to use for these criteria. The ﬁrst step is the
synthesis of the empirical function of the probability distribution for the observed
variable x. The second step is its transformation to f(x) using, for example, the
Neyman-Pearson criterion (Fig. 3.1).
Let us consider the case of a uniform data set where the selected values
xi (i = 1, …, n) are independent realizations of the same casual value n having the
density fa0(x) for the hypothesis H0 and the density fa1(x) when the hypothesis H1 is

true. In this case, the parameter a of the real density fa can be equal to neither a0
or a1.
Errors of the ﬁrst kind, a, and the second kind, b, satisfy the following formulas
respectively:

Neyman-Pearson theory focuses on testing a statistical hypothesis provided that
the volume of observations allows the calculation of basic statistical characteristics
including the empirical distribution function. In this case, theoretical probability
density function fa(x) is assessed on the base of χ2-criterion. Unfortunately,
empirical results of environmental monitoring usually do not satisfy this condition.
In this case a sequential procedure is used where the sample size is not ﬁxed in
advance. Instead, data are evaluated as they are collected, and further sampling is
stopped in accordance with a pre-deﬁned stopping rule as soon as signiﬁcant results
are observed. Thus, a conclusion may sometimes be reached at a much earlier stage

than would be possible with more classical hypothesis testing or estimation and
consequently at lower ﬁnancial and/or human cost.
3.2.2 Sequential Decision-Making Procedure
The sequential procedure of the decision making process allows the minimization
of the detection time when the existing phenomenon is taking place (Fig. 3.2). The
sequential procedure has the following basic characteristic (Wald 2004):

Accordingly, L(a0) = 1 −α and L(a1) = β, and it thus follows that the average
number of observations in a sequential procedure equals to:

The universality of the distribution (3.12) follows from its duality to the
Gaussian distribution. As far back as 1960 Wald showed that if Ean
j
j and Da n are
sufﬁciently small in comparison to lnA and lnB, the distribution of m/Ea mdeﬁned by
the expression (3.11) will be a close approximation to the real one even for n not
distributed by the Gaussian law.
Theoretical aspects of the universality of the distribution Wc(x) are important for
the integrated estimation of the sequential procedure efﬁciency. However, these are
not the principal aspects for experimental applications. For that reason, as a rule, the
synthesis of the decision making system is perceived without these considerations.
In fact, the volume of the measurements, as a rule, is small and the central limit
theorem doesn’t work. The statistical difﬁculties arising from this can be overcome
by evolutionary modeling (Bukatova et al. 1991), intelligent technology (Nitu et al.
2000b) and the use of other algorithms.
3.3 Decision-Making Procedure Using the Sequential
Analysis
In contradiction to the Neyman-Pearson criterion (Yan and Blum 2001), the
sequential procedure doesn’t separate the stages of measurement and data processing
but it alternates them. This is represented schematically in Fig. 3.2 incomparison to
Fig. 3.4 Response of the
density of the Wald’s

Procedures for Classical and Sequential …

the classical procedure which is shown in Fig. 3.1. According to these ﬁgures, the
algorithmic load of the sequential procedure changes dynamically, while at the same
time the classical procedure realizes the data processing stage only on the ﬁnishing
step of the experiment. Hence, the synthesis of the efﬁcient decision making system
(DMS) poses the following problems:
i. selection of the criterion for the parameters estimation;
ii. revealing of the probabilistic characteristics of the process studied;
iii. a priori estimation of the possible losses concerning the precision of the
decisions taken; and
iv. prognosis of the dynamic stability for the experiment results.
The DMS should have a wide spectrum of functions:
i. visualization of the measurement data in the form of direct soft copy, discrete
distribution and statistical parameters;
ii. calculation of the statistical characteristics (mean, central second and third order
moments, asymmetry and excess coefﬁcients, expression of the entropy, etc.);
iii. synthesis of the empirical and theoretical distribution functions;
iv. valuation of the parameters which are used in the Neyman-Pearson and the
sequential procedures of the hypotheses decision; and
v. realization of the user access to all the functions of the decision making system.
According to the scheme represented in Fig. 3.5 the decision-making system
should have an expert control level. The unit DMSP-I controls the decision making
procedure through its inputs and outputs. According to the functions of the sub-
units described in Table 3.1 the user can promptly interfere in any arbitrary stage of
the computer experiment, correcting the parameters of the decision making pro-
cedure or even ceasing it.
The sub-unit CTT manages the calculation process taking into account the
character of the task. It forms the variants that correspond to the concrete combi-
nation of the errors of the ﬁrst and second kind, a and b. Based on this combination,
the sub-unit CTT produces a set of parameters to manage the other sub-units.
Depending on a and b, the simpliﬁed procedures are possible. For example, two
variants for the asymmetric thresholds A and B are:
(1) B = β∕(1 −α) →0, A = (1 −β)/α →const; and
(2) B = β∕(1 −α) = const, A = (1 −β)/α →∞.
In other words, the errors a and b are unequal in value. Particularly:
(1) β →0, α = const; or
(2) β = const, α →0.
230

Environmental Decision-Making

In these cases, the sequential procedure will ﬁnish with the probability equal to 1
if the following conditions are satisﬁed:
(1) Ea ζ > 0, ζ = ln[fa1(ξ)/fa(ξ)]; or
(2) Ea ζ0 < 0.
The probability of completion of the procedure is small when one of the
following conditions is not satisﬁed:
(1) β >> α, Ea ζ > 0; or
(2) α >> β, Eaζ < 0.
The user can visualize the state of the procedure as shown in Fig. 3.6.
Unit VMD coordinates system input with the separate channels of measured
data. As each random process {xi} is executed, analyses are carried out to eliminate
errors and to represent input signals in a form that is acceptable for the other units.
The unit CSC calculates signal characteristics:

3.4 Important Parameters of the Sequential Analysis
Procedure
An investigation of the sum of xn of independent random values having the same
distribution imposes a double task on the distribution function, P(xn < x) = F1(x),
both for ﬁxed n and for the variable case. The situation of comparison between xn
and some level C arises in both cases. However, in the second case this task is
transformed into the study of the distribution function, P(m < n) = F2(n), of the
chance number m of components by which xm ﬁrst exceeds the level C = C(α, β):
xi < C (i = 1, …, m −1), xm  C.
In conformity with the central limit theorem, in the ﬁrst case the distribution
F1(x) approaches the normal distribution when n →∞. In the second case, we have
the distribution represented by expression (3.12). The following correlation
between these distributions exists:

The expression (3.13) makes it possible to study the sequential analysis distri-
bution using the characteristics of U. As seen from (3.11), the distribution function
Wc(x) is deﬁned on the half-space [0, ∞] and it has one maximum at the point
x = mc. In fact, we have:

The position of the Wc(y) maximum changes depending only on the parameter
c remaining less than one (mc < 1). Moreover, mc →0 when c →0 and mc →1
when c →∞. Comparing Eqs. (3.1) and (3.14), we ﬁnd:

Hence, the function Wc(y) degenerates under c →0 or c →∞into the delta-

Thus, the random value m=Em is asymptotically normal with average value and

and (3.22) can receive various analytical approximations of Wc. For example, let us
represent Φ(y) by the following:

Thus, formula (3.26) allows us to calculate Wc(x) for various values of c and
x. The free parameters x1 and x2 inﬂuence the calculation error. Practically, the
values x1 = 2.2 and x2 = 7.5 are acceptable. Moreover, a problem of convergence of
the above rows appears when parameter c is increasing. It is easy to see that
Wc(x) ≈Φ[(x −1)c1/2] for c ≫1 and Wc(x) ≈1 −exp(−cx/2) when x →∞.
The formula (3.13) is the basic expression for the calculation of Wc(x). The large

As mentioned above, the sequential method helps to tackle some unsolved
problems related to minimizing the detection delay time, and to detect a point where
safe environmental process becomes dangerous. As seen from Eq. (3.12) and
Figs. 3.3 and 3.8, there are environmental processes, for which parameter c tends to
large values. In these cases, the approximations of function Wc(x) given above can
help to overcome this situation.
3.5 Processing the Multichannel Information
3.5.1 Introduction
The schematic diagram of a monitoring system for detecting anomalies on the
Earth’s surface involves many levels. The search organization structure may contain
a more profound hierarchy including processing of information from satellites,
238

Environmental Decision-Making

airborne and ﬂoating laboratories, and stationary systems. In spite of the possibility
of deﬁnite realization of this structure and the applicable computer technique, there
exists, nevertheless, one general problem whose solution determines the detection
efﬁciency. This task involves the organization of in-line data processing at all
detection system levels under real-time conditions, ensuring an uninterrupted
matching of the operation of all the cybernetic devices of the system and also taking
into account the limitation on their functional characteristics.
Statistical analysis of the information at each level of the monitoring system is
completed by making the following two subsequent decisions:
(1) storage of features of the landscape elements for the accumulation of addi-
tional information about them,
(2) completion on the presence of an anomaly and transmission of its character-
istics to the next data processing level.
These two stages determine the efﬁcacy of the detection system. At the ﬁrst stage
selection and storage of parameters of the elements of landscapes suspected of
being anomalous are dependent on the character of the algorithm used for singling
out the two-dimensional signal against the background noise. They are also asso-
ciated with the gradual ﬁlling of the main storage. The second stage determines the
magnitude of the detection probability, depending on the criteria of registration of
the landscape elements selected at the ﬁrst stage for further analysis. As a conse-
quence, the problem of matching the ﬂow of information between the processing
stages under monitoring conditions and at minimal losses arises. The solution to
this problem involves two procedures of parallel component processing, forming
the intermediate information delay either as a constant computer memory buffer
size or for a ﬁxed storage time.
3.5.2 Multi-channel Statistical Analyzer
Real monitoring systems have series of informational channels the efﬁciency of
whom depends on the solved task. Usually, the principal scheme of monitoring
system has the form of some transformation F. Its structure and functions are
deﬁned by the items realizing separate operations on the analysis and transforma-
tion of measurement data. This is given schematically in Fig. 3.9.
The general scheme of sensing the environmental elements assumes that the ﬂux
of data {Tb} from the j-th measuring device can be analyzed both separately and
together with the data from other channels. In fact, there is a digital processor of the
type of a personal computer with a speed equal to V operations per second. The task
is set to identify an unknown vector parameter Tb = {Tb1, …, Tbn} characterizing
the state of the controlled object (e.g., in the problems of microwave monitoring`
these are brightness temperatures). To solve this problem, an algorithm of the
parallel-in-time analysis of the vector Tb components is proposed, which makes it
3.5
Processing the Multichannel Information
239

possible to reduce the time of data processing, but in this case the problem of the
data ﬂow agreement exists.
Two situations are possible:
(1) the system has time to analyze the whole chain of vectors without delay in
individual channels, and
(2) at some moments, a delay occurs in some channels. In a general case, two
types of delay are possible: in time and in volume.
Assume constant delays in time τ1, …, τk, and delays in volume m1, m2, …, mk.
In the ﬁrst case, the process of choosing the vector Tb is realized by a channel-to-
channel procedure when the vector components Tbj are accumulated with the time
delay intervals τi and then they are transmitted to the chain {Tbi}. The number of
delayed estimates of Tbi in each channel is random and therefore the buffer memory
of each channel should be reserved. In the second case, a random value is the time
of delay τi (i = 1, …, k), and the volumes of the buffers mi are ﬁxed. In both cases, it
is necessary to assess the probability not to miss a real value of the vector Tb and to
ﬁnd optimal values of τi and mi corresponding to the maximum level of this
probability.
Let the on-board computer memory has M cells. The statistical analyzer realizes
with time the simultaneous parallel selection of components of the “suspected”
variant of the vector parameter b = b*. This is achieved by work of the K consec-
utive devices or by algorithms of selection of component values bi (i = 1, …,
K) corresponding to the space of anomalous features. To “stabilize” the process of
selecting the anomaly variant, it is possible to create two kinds of constant delays
between the selection devices of the anomalous components: constant delay with
number of “candidates” and constant delay with time.
The two delay modes allow one to have a more ﬂexible organization of the dis-
tribution of M memory elements for storing the intermediate values of the “suspected”
components. Because of the random character of the whole process, the statistical
analyzer is apt to make transient errors due to the overﬂow of the computer memory

capacity intended for the delays. Therefore it is necessary to obtain an assessment for
the probability of appearance of errors and to ﬁnd memory capacities for delays
M1 þ    þ Mk\M and for the distribution of time delay intervals t1, …, tK.
Let selection b
i be realized in the volume sample ni, basing each selection on Ni
reasonable values bi. In this case, the non-anomalous value bi is taken as the
anomalous value with probability αi and it is rejected with probability 1 −αi. The
probability of appearance of “candidates” during time ti = ri αi Si is given by:

without delay. If μi > riαi, the “candidates” fb

to be analyzed before the arrival of fb
iþ1g. Therefore, the variants are delayed at Fi.
The probability that the number of “candidates” will not exceed the mean values ri

Denoting the memory capacity intended for delay of the ith component of b by

(i = 1, …, K). Then the probability of non-overﬂow of memory Mi will be: P

where Ni is the number of possible variants of values bi.
Let this probability differ from unity by no more than δi. Then we obtain an
equation for determining the delay value ti (i = 1, …, K):

For an unambiguous determination of the numerical value of ri let us ﬁnd the
probability of “non-emptying” of the delay, i.e. the probability that during the
exhaustive search for Ni values of the i’th component, at least one “candidate” will
be under delay, and then demand that this probability is within the permissible
limits. Thus,

estimated by the inequality:

Thus, by solving Eq. (3.30) and inserting its root into Eq. (3.32), we obtain two
probable values of emptying the delay: qi = Ni[1 −Φ(vi)]. Hence, that root of
Eq. (3.30) is chosen to be reasonable with respect to the quality of the numerical
delay value.
If the binomial distribution miðsÞ cannot be approximated precisely enough by
the normal distribution, we can use the Poisson distribution: mðsÞ ≈p(s) = (rα)sexp

Furthermore, all the arguments regarding the inference from this equation are

Generally, the calculation procedure for ti can be realized by the computer for
any expression miðsÞ. But since Niαi ≫1 is practically always the same, the
agreements presented are extremely real and simple.
Thus, at a given time delay the probability of error of the whole anomaly

In the case of τi ≥mini/αi, the variants from Fi enter Fi+1 more rarely than on
average. According to the matching condition of the whole ﬂow, they have time to
pass by without delay. At τi < mini/αi, the b
i variants do not have time to be
processed at Fi+1 and are delayed at Fi. It is necessary to determine the numerical
values of mi (i = 1, …, K) so that mi ≤Mi and in the process of an exhaustive search
for the ith component there should be a deﬁnite probability of no overﬂow and no
delay emptying.
Let us take advantage of the approximate expression of Pascal’s distribution via

To ensure the predetermined probability of non-overﬂow of Mi memory, it is

The evaluation of probability of the on-board computer memory overﬂowing
under monitoring conditions of processing information through the K channels as
considered above enables one—in deﬁnite situations—to calculate the parameters
of the system, to estimate its efﬁcacy, and to choose one of the two processing
methods which has already been indicated above. Both delay variants discussed
above are equivalent in the requisite additional memory capacity and operation
time. Indeed, if Δi = σi, then ri = Ri, i.e. the delay in the ﬁrst variant equals the
number of variants considered in the second. Similarly, assuming qi = εi, we obtain
the equality ri = Ri. Therefore, the choice of the kind of delay should be determined
by technical considerations of its realization.
3.6 Applications of the Sequential Decision-Making
Procedure
Sequential analysis applications are mainly occurred when the under study sto-
chastic processes are time-dependent and the researcher is not able to form repre-
sentative samples. Carvalho and Lopes (2007) developed and implemented a
simulation-based sequential algorithm to estimate a univariate Markov switching
stochastic volatility model and showed that the sequential algorithm can perform
accurate sequential inferences. It was shown that a useful tool for modeling time
varying variables and for measure of risk is stochastic volatility models.

Environmental Decision-Making

Sequential method helps to understand how the model’s output depends on its
input, in some region of the input parameter space. In other words, sequential
screening allows the focusing only on the important parameters what fasters the
study process that doing the analysis over all the parameters. For example, the
problem of earlier detection of tropical cyclone beginning is solved taking into
account numerous meteorological and geophysical characteristics of the ocean/
atmosphere system delivered by the GOOS including TAO/TRITON/PIRATA/
RAMA system (Krapivin and Soldatov 2009b; Sukov et al. 2008a). It is evident that
restricted number of between these parameters is important.
The sequential decision making procedure is used to estimate the parameters of
the land surface based on the remote data received by the ﬂying laboratory Il-18
(Fig. 2.4) which was used for a long time in Former Soviet Union and which was
unique remote-sensing system. The measurements were obtained by radiometers of
0.4, 0.8, 2.25, 11, 21, and 27 cm wavelength. The sets of radiobrightness tem-
peratures {Tj} are registered and Tj,min, Tj,max and Tj,mean are calculated. As a result,
they are transformed to the normalized sets {Tj/Tj,max} or {ΔTj = Tj – Tj,mean}.
Figure 3.10 gives examples of such transformations. The registered radiobrightness
temperatures are typical for the land covers of the eastern Caspian Sea coast. This is
a region of saline lands, dry sands, saline waters, dense bushes, and populated
landscapes. As it is seen in Fig. 3.11, multi-channel measurements provide the data
sets, making it possible to distinguish the land surface cover. Moreover, an appli-
cation of the sequential analysis procedure guarantees the solution to this task in
real-time on-board the ﬂying laboratory.
The radiobrightness temperature sets, made discrete by the quasi-uniform sub-
sets, are transformed to combinations of distribution characteristics which make
possible the formation of the multi-dimensional image state of the land surface. An
example of the cluster analysis application is given in Fig. 3.12. Real brightness

temperatures of this example are given in Fig. 3.13 and the statistical parameters of
the distributions are given in Table 3.2. The use of brightness temperatures of multi-
channel measurements allows reliable recognition of land surfaces regardless of the
climatic zone (Fig. 3.14). It is easy to see that the varied distributions do not
correspond to the land surface structure. However, the parametric space expansion
increases the efﬁciency of the decision system by including the distribution
characteristics.
The optimal procedure of the functioning of the decision system consists in the
joint use of the classical and sequential algorithms for data processing (see Fig. 3.5).
This procedure saves time and gives the operative parameters of the distributions

3.7 Disaster Decision-Making
It is evident that methods of local diagnostics of the environment do not permit a
complex assessment of the state of a natural object or process, especially if this
element of the environment covers a vast area. In the problems of geoinformation
monitoring, situations occur when it is necessary to make a decision in real time,
with limited capabilities of the applied means of data collection and processing. In
this connection, the scheme of Fig. 3.16 proposes a monitoring procedure that
formalizes the decision making on the operative diagnose of the studied environ-
mental subsystem. According to this scheme, the regular control of the environ-
mental elements is realized with the use of technical measuring means and
algorithms for observational data processing (Kondratyev and Krapivin 2005a).
With the development of the civilization, the problem of the future environment
changes forecasting and bound with them changes of the living conditions for people
becomes all more current importance. The origin and spread of dangerous natural
phenomena do not only ruin the lifes of living beings, but they also cause serious
economic damage (Kondratyev and Krapivin 2005; Milne 2004; Gardner 2002).
Such phenomena are known as natural catastrophes. Historically, natural anomalies
on different spatio-temporal scales have played an important role in the evolution of
nature, causing and actuating the mechanisms of natural systems regulation. Wild-
ﬁres can serve a special example of the similar sort of anomalies (Kondratyev et al.

2006b). With the development of industry and the growth of the population density,
these mechanisms have suffered signiﬁcant change and the threat to life is thereby
intensiﬁed (Nazaretyan 2004; Podlazov 2001; Shahramantyan 2003). This is mainly
connected with growth and spreading of the amplitude of anthropogenic changes in
the environment. Numerous studies of the problems that have cropped up in recent
years showed that the frequency and the power of disastrous natural phenomena is
growing and is posing increased risk of greater losses of human lifes, economic
losses, and breaches of the social infrastructure. For instance, only in 2001 about 650
natural catastrophes occurred in the world. These natural catastrophes took away the
lifes of more than 25 thousands of people and caused an economic damage of more
than US$ 35 bn. The overall picture of the last years is dominated by the accumu-
lation of severe earthquakes to an extent seldom experienced in recent decades.
Several major catastrophes in 2010 resulted in substantial losses and in an excep-
tionally high number of fatalities. Altogether, 950 natural catastrophes were
recorded, nine-tenths of which were weather-related events like storms and ﬂoods.
According to this total, 2010 has been the year with the second-highest number of
natural catastrophes since 1980, markedly exceeding the annual average for the last
10 years (785 events per year). The overall losses amounted to around US$ 130 bn, of
which approximately US$ 37 bn was insured. This puts 2010 among the six most
loss-intensive years for the insurance industry since 1980. The level of overall losses
was slightly above the high average of the past 10 years. Year 2011 continues this
tendency. An exceptional accumulation of very severe natural catastrophes makes
2011 the highest-ever loss year on record, even after the ﬁrst half-year. Unfortu-
nately, there is no reliable prognosis of the future level of global natural disasters.
Such factors are mainly functions of the readiness of the territory to reduce the
risk of the losses and greatly change at time. In 2002, for example, there were 700
signiﬁcant catastrophes causing the death of 11,000 people and an economic
damage of US$ 55 bn. The greatest loss was caused by ﬂoods. The spatial distri-
bution of the catastrophes showed a typical strong spottiness (i.e., unevenness). For
example, the list of human victims in 2002 is characterized by the following factors:
Africa—a number of the catastrophes 51 (661 deaths), America—181 (825), Asia—
261 (8,570), Australia and Oceania—69 (61), Europe—136 (459) (Bondur et al.
2009). Subsequent years are also characterized by numerous human victims and
economic losses. For example, 354 natural disasters took place during 2008 and as
a result 236,000 people died and 211,628,186 were affected. This compares to the
average for 2000–2007 of 397 natural disasters, with 66,812 deaths and a total of
231,588,104 people affected.
Natural catastrophes can be divided into different categories. Environmental
phenomena that kill and displace thousands of people who are essential to the
economy of a given region are classiﬁed as large natural catastrophes. It thus
follows that the scale of natural catastrophes depends on the level of the economic
development of the region, which deﬁnes the degree of protection of population
from disastrous natural phenomena. So, the study of a phenomenon, in accordance
with the natural catastrophes, must be accompanied by the analysis of a poverty
level for the population of given region. The results of studies during the last
250
3
Environmental Decision-Making

25 years show that losses from natural catastrophes are much greater in developing
countries than in economically developed regions. Taking into account that in
recent decades the number and power of natural catastrophes has increased by about
ﬁve times and the danger they pose by about nine times, the threat to the population
of these countries in the near future becomes abundantly clear. For that reason,
forecasting and warning of crisis phenomena must be a subject of worry for all
countries, regardless of their economic development.
At present, the theory of catastrophes and the analysis of risk are well developed
(Brebbia 2004). Their application to events and processes in the real environment
requires to synthesize a global model of the NSS that employs the technical
facilities of satellite monitoring. The solution of the problems that arise here is the
subject of ecoinformatics, which provides the joining of analytical simple, semi-
empirical and complex nonlinear models of ecosystems with updated global data-
base. Many international and national programs of environmental study, directed at
problem solving and spatial orientation, have recently raised the level of thematic
coordination to reach the necessary level of efﬁciency. An example of such coor-
dination is the Global Carbon Project and Earth Observing System, which between
them contain information and technical facilities of the highest quality for esti-
mation and forecasting of NSS dynamic features.
The development of the constructive ways to forecast natural catastrophes
requires decisions regarding a set of problems:
• Adaptation of ecoinformatics methods to the problem of diagnosing and fore-
casting natural catastrophes in all their variety.
• Formation of the statistical characteristics of the natural catastrophes in their
history aspect, selecting categories and deﬁning spatial and temporary scales of
the disastrous change of the human habitation. The analysis of the natural
catastrophes history is important for understanding the modern dependencies
between crisis in nature and society. The statistical characteristics of the natural
catastrophes in their dynamics allow the formulation of the basic positions to
mathematical theory of the catastrophes and deﬁne the priority directions of the
studies.
• Developing a concept and synthesizing a survivability model to estimate the
inﬂuence of natural catastrophes on human habitation.
• The study of the objective laws of the interaction between different components
and processes in global NSS in interconnection with such capacious notion, as
biological complexity of the ecosystem (biocomplexity), considering it as a
function of biological, physical, chemical, social, and behavioral interactions of
the environmental subsystems, including living organisms and their community.
The notion of biocomplexity is linked to objective laws that govern the way the
biosphere functions by uniting its ecosystems and natural/economic systems on
different scales, from local to global. A joint formalized description of the
biological, geochemical, geophysical, and anthropogenic factors and processes
occurring at a given level of the spatiotemporal hierarchy of scales is called for
3.7
Disaster Decision-Making
251

here. It is also important to evaluate the possibility of using different indicators,
such as biocomplexity, to show the approach of a natural catastrophe.
• Investigating correlations between survivability, biocomplexity, and NSS evo-
lution using global-modeling technologies. Creating global model blocks,
describing regularities and trends in the environment, to ascertain stressful sit-
uations initiated by economic or political activity.
• Consideration of the demographic premises of the arising of the natural catas-
trophes and discovery of mechanisms regulating the nature environment and
preventing the realization of these premises.
• Synthesis of the NSS model and the development of a computer method to carry
out calculations in order to assess the consequences of a realization of various
anthropogenic activity scenarios.
Walker (2003) fairly noticed that the notion of the natural catastrophe is vague
and its determination depends on many factors. Grigoryev and Kondratyev (2001)
deﬁned the natural catastrophe as “exceeding and dangerous situation in vital
activity of the population, caused by essential disadvantage changes in the envi-
ronment”, or “as uneven changes in the system, appearing in the manner of its
sudden answer to ﬂuent changes of the external environment”. The amount of such
critical situations in the environment is increasing. At present, the following phe-
nomenon pertains to natural catastrophes: ﬂoods, droughts, hurricanes, storms,
tornado, tsunami, earthquakes, landslides, collapses, coldness, volcanic eruptions,
wildﬁres, windstorms, sandstorms, avalanches, strong frosts, heat, epidemics, pla-
gues of locust, and many other natural phenomena. In the future, this list may
enlarge to account of the origin of new type of natural catastrophes such as colli-
sions with cosmic body and generated person—bioterrorism, nuclear catastrophes,
magnetic ﬁeld reversal, plague, robot aggression, alien aggression, cultural decline,
etc. For this reason, it is important to develop efﬁcient quantitative technologies and
criteria so that warnings about the appearance of dangerous disastrous natural
phenomena can be issued with high reliability.
Many authors consider the notion of the natural catastropheto be associated with
the notion of ecological safety, which ﬁrst appeared when the need to estimate the
risk facing the population in a given area to get insurance to cover health, buildings,
or other property as a result of changing environmental parameters arose. These
changes can be triggered by both natural and anthropogenic causes. In the ﬁrst case,
the dangerous situation appears at the expense of ﬂuctuations in natural processes
connected with change of the ecological situation, origin of epidemics or by natural
disaster. In the second case, danger appears as nature reaction to anthropogenic
activity. For instance, Gardner (2002) investigated the change in the natural envi-
ronment of the Himalayas in India and came to the conclusion that factors such as
reforestation and change in vegetable cover induce and amplify instability in this
region. This results in land resource degradation and increased destruction of the
natural environment because of ﬂoods. Field and Raupach (2004) and Abrahamson
(1989) interfaced the change of regularities of the appearance of natural catastro-
phes with growth of instability in the carbon-climate-society system. According to
252
3
Environmental Decision-Making

Field et al. (2002), like instability can increase in nearest two decades by a con-
siderable extent at the expense of the change of the many features of the World
Ocean ecosystem. Milne (2004), analyzed the history of different large catastrophes
and made pessimistic forecasts for the fate of humankind, using terms like
“doomsday”.
In general case, the rise of ecological danger on given territory is due to
deﬂections of environmental parameters for limits, where living organism under
long stay begins to change on direction not corresponding to natural process to
evolution. The notion “ecological danger” or “ecological safety” are connected with
notions of stability, vitality, and wholeness of biosphere and its elements. More-
over, the NSS, being self-organizing and self-structuring system that is developed
according to the laws of evolution, creates collections of ecological niches, the
acceptability of which for the population of given territory is deﬁned, as a rule, in
accordance with national criteria (a set of environmental quality criteria, religious
dogmas, national traditions, etc.).
When considering the viability conditions for life on Earth, it is necessary to
move away from human-oriented standards to assess the level of environmental
degradation, since local and regional changes in the environment in the course of
time become global. The amplitudes of these changes are deﬁned by mechanisms of
the NSS functioning, which provide the optimality of changes in its elements.
Humankind has increasingly deviated from this optimality in its interaction with
environmental abiotic and biotic formations. However, human society—as just
another NSS element—will in time understand its large-scale relationship with
nature, as a result of many sciences and studying the causal relationship in this
system (Kondratyev et al. 2003b).
The ecological environment in which people are living is a complex dynamic
system. Its stability in time depends on the regularity of its structure, material
composition, energy balance, and stability of its reactions on the same external
inﬂuences. The system stability can be disturbed as a result of inﬂuences from both
passive and active external impacts. In other words, in modern conditions nature N
and human society H, forming a united planetary system and having hierarchical
structures ( N
j j; H
j j), interact pursuing their own goals (N, H). From a formal
standpoint, this interaction can be considered a casual process η(x, t) with an
unknown distribution law, presenting the tension level between subsystems N and
H or evaluating the state of one of them. Here x = {x1, …, xn} is a set of the
identiﬁcation features of the subsystems N and H, being components of the possible
indicator of the arising natural catastrophe i.e. deﬂections η(x, t) for limits, where
state of the subsystem N becomes threatening for H. It thus follows that the pur-
poses and behaviors of subsystems N and H are functions of the factor η, and their
behaviors can be antagonistic, indifferent, or cooperative depending on η. The main
goal of the subsystem H consists in the achievement of the high living standard with
warranty of the permanent survival in the comfort conditions. The goal and
behavior of the subsystem N are deﬁned by the objective laws of co-evolution (it
follows to call the attention to this context on concept of the biotic regulation of
environment (Kondratyev et al. 2003b, 2004b). In this sense, the division between
3.7
Disaster Decision-Making

N and H is conditional and can be interpreted as the division of all natural processes
into controlled and non-controlled. As world population increases, natural catas-
trophes will intensify the sensation of unconformity reﬂected in the social and
cultural conditions of many regions.
From the viewpoint of the theory of systems, H and N are open systems. Without
going into philosophical and methodical aspects of this division, we assume that
systems are symmetrical from the viewpoint of their simulation. In addition, the
system H disposes technology, science, economic potential, industry and agriculture,
sociological structure, size of the population, etc. The process of the interaction
between the systems N and H brings about a change of η, the level of which inﬂu-
ences upon the structures of H and H. Really, there exists the threshold ηmax, outside
of which mankind ceases to exist, but nature survives. Asymmetry of the subsystems
N and H in this sense causes change of the goal and strategy of system H. Probably, in
modern conditions the value of η approaches to ηmax with high velocity, but therefore
separate components of the H possible to refer to the cooperative class. Since modern
social-economic structure of the world is presented by the countries, it is reasonable
to consider the country as functional system element of H. The function η(x, t) reﬂects
the result of the interaction between countries or between countries and nature. The
collection of the results of these interactions can be described by matrix B ¼

Many scientiﬁc theories are dedicated to the study of complex systems inter-
action of the different nature. In the asymmetrical case considered here, the question
is about the survivability of system H and about ﬁnding a way to estimate the future
dynamics of system H. According to Podlazov (2001), reﬂexive behavior of H will
eventually help mankind to ﬁnd technology of the behavior that will be capable to
compare advantages and danger, to understand the principal restrictions of our
possibilities and to realize the new threats in good time.
As a result of the many aspects of the environmental change in recent decades,
many authors have come up with multiple concepts to describe the NSS on a global
basis and models of different complexity to parameterize the dynamics of biospheric
characteristics. The presence of the global database containing various information
characteristics allows to consider and to evaluate the consequences of a possible
realization of the different scenarios of the subsystem H development. Traditional
approaches to synthesizing global models are founded on considering collections of
balance equations, in which parameters {xi} take the form of functions, arguments,
factors, and conditions of the transition between parametric descriptions of envi-
ronmental processes. Moreover, other approaches based on evolutionary and neural
network algorithms have been used (Nitu et al. 2004). The organization of the N∪H
global model functioning can be presented in the manner of a conceptual scheme
254

described by Kondratyev et al. (2004a). The realization of this scheme is performed
by the introduction of the geographical cell {φi, λj} with spatial steps Δφi and Δλj for
the land surface and World Ocean by the latitude and longitude, respectively. So, all
processes and NSS elements are considered as uniform and are parameterized by
point models within the pixel Ωij = {(φ, λ): φi ≤φ ≤φi + Δφi, λj ≤λ ≤λj + Δλj}. The
choice of the pixel size is deﬁned by a set of conditions that depend on the spatial
resolution of satellite measurements and the availability of a necessary global data-
base. In the case of water surface, the water body of pixel Ωij is divided by depth z to
layers, i.e. three-dimensional volumes Ωijk = {(φ, λ, z): (φ, λ) ∈Ωij, zk ≤z ≤zk + Δzk}
are formed. All elements of Ωijk are considered as uniform. Finally, atmosphere
above the pixel Ωij is digitized by the height in accordance with the atmospheric
pressure levels, or on typical layers by height.
It is clear that the creation of a global model is possible only with attraction of the
knowledge and data on given multidisciplinary level. Among the ensemble of global
models we consider the best to be that described by Kondratyev et al. (2004a). A block
diagram of this model is submitted in Fig. 1.21. Kondratyev et al. (2002) describe an
adaptive procedure for a global model into a geoinformation monitoring system.
The approach of the moment of the arising of the natural catastrophe is char-
acterized by hit of the vector {xi} in a certain cluster of multi-dimensional space Xc.
In other words, going from purely verbal discourses to quantitative determination of
this process, we shall enter the generalized feature I(t) of the natural catastrophe and
shall identify it with graduated scale N, for which the presence of the relations of the
type N1\N2; N1 [ N2 or N1 
 N2 is postulated. This means that there always
exists such value of I tð Þ ¼ q, which deﬁnes the level of vicinity of the arising of the
natural catastrophe of a given type: N ! q ¼ f ðNÞ, where f is certain transforma-
tion of the notion “natural catastrophe” in number. As a result, the value h ¼
I tð Þ  q
j
j deﬁnes the expected interval of time before the catastrophe comes.
Let us try to ﬁnd a satisfactory model to portray a natural catastrophe by means of
notions and signs that comply with a formalized description and transformation. For
this purpose, we shall select m element-subsystems of undermost level in system N∪H.
The interaction between these element-subsystems is deﬁned by the matrix function
A ¼ jjaijjj, where aij is a factor of level of dependencies of the relations between
subsystem i and j. Then, the characteristic I(t) can be deﬁned as the following sum:

Entering indicator I brings a scheme to monitor and forecast natural catastrophes
much closer. We now present the possible structure of a monitoring system that has
functions to search for, forecasts, and plots the course of a natural catastrophe.
Three levels are selected in the system: holder, resolver and searcher, the blocks of
which have the following function:
(1) periodic examination of the Earth’s surface elements;
(2) memorizing suspicious elements;
(3) forming of traces of the moving anomaly from suspect elements;
(4) accumulation in time of data on ﬁxed elements of the Earth’s surface to carry
out a statistical analysis in order to decide whether the ﬁxed suspicious ele-
ments are of noise or signal in character; and
(5) stage-by-stage localization of the procedure of the search for an anomaly.
The efﬁciency of such a monitoring system depends on the parameters used by
technical facilities to take measurements and on the algorithms for data processing.
The environmental model, used in parallel with formation and statistical test of the
row {IΩ(t)} and adapted to mode of the monitoring in accordance with GIMS-based
adaptation scheme, plays an important role.
Employing these criteria when studying natural catastrophes reveals that both
form and behavior IΩ(t) have a typical type for each process in the environment.
One of the difﬁcult problems consists in determination of these forms and corre-
sponding to their categorizations. For instance, a such often appearing of dangerous
natural phenomena, as landslides and mudﬂows, has typical signs of the preliminary
change in the relief and landscape, which are successfully registered with satellite in
optical range. Moreover, aerial images and in situ measurements of relief slopes,
hillsides, and hydrologic networks permit forecasting such events several days
before. However, the limited possibility of the optical range under the cloudiness or
vegetable cover has to be overcome by introducing the systems of the remote
sensing in microwave range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Then, in addition to
the above-mentioned indicators of landslides and mudﬂows, it is possible to add
such informative parameters as soil moisture and biomass, since increase in soil
moistureleads to the appearance of landslides, while increase in the biomass is
indicative of strengthening the restraining role played by vegetation cover in pre-
venting soil rocks moving. Particularly, this is important when supervision is
snowed-stone or simply snow avalanches. Creating a catalog of such indicators for
all possible natural catastrophes and adding them to the knowledge base of a
monitoring system is a necessary stage in increasing its efﬁciency.
The knowledge of the informative indicators set

characterizing the natural
catastrophe of j-th type and a priori determination of its cluster X j in space of these
indicators allows to calculate the velocity vj of the approach of the point

to the
center of X j during the satellite observation and, thereby, to evaluate the time of the
coming of the catastrophe. Other algorithms can be used to forecast natural
catastrophes. For instance, forecasting of the forest ﬁre is possible by means of
dependencies of forest radiothermal radiation on different length of the waves from

the combustible timber moistening, as a rule, being situated by the layers.
Knowledge of such dependencies facilitates assessing the risk of forest ﬁre taking
into account the water content in plant cover and in the upper layer of soil.
Many studies have shown that there is real possibility to assess the ﬁre dan-
gerous of the waterlogged and marsh forest taking into consideration the water
content in vegetable cover and upper soil layer, using the microwave measurements
within the range of 0.8–30 cm. Multi-channel observations allow to solve the task
of the forests classiﬁcation by the ﬁre-mature categories by means of algorithms of
the cluster analysis. The efﬁciency of such methods depends on the detailed
descriptions of forest structure in model, reﬂecting the state of the canopy and
density of trees. Undergrowth ﬁres are the most dangerous and difﬁcult to detect.
The three-layer model of the soil-stem-canopy system is efﬁcient in this case when
it is coordinated with the ﬁre risk indicator I(λ1, λ2) = [Tb(λ1) −Tb(λ2)]/
[Tb(λ1) + Tb(λ2)]. For instance, under λ1 = 0.8 cm and λ2 = 3.2 cm indicator
I changes approximately from −0.25 in zone of the absence of the forest burning to
0.54 in zone of the ﬁre. In the ﬁeld of appearance of ﬁrst signs of the litter burning
I ≈0.23. In addition, the value of I weakly depends on the distribution of com-
bustible layers in the forest such as lichens, mosses, grassy rags, died pine-needles
or leaves.
Realization of such a three-level mode for decision making about the imminence
of natural catastrophedepends on the spatiotemporal scales of the monitoring sys-
tem corresponding with characteristics of the natural phenomena. The most com-
plex for decision making are delayed action natural catastrophes, the realization of
which can take decades. Ozone holes, global warming, desertiﬁcation, biodiversity
reduction, overpopulation of the Earth, etc. belong to expected catastrophes. The
solution to the basic task of reliable forecasting such undesirable natural phe-
nomena can be realized via the GIMS using global databases, current satellites, and
in situ measurements.

Ecoinformatics Problems of the World
Ocean
4.1 The Present Day of the World Ocean
A more detailed description of the production processes in the ocean ecosystems is
needed in order to increase the reliability of assessing the role of the World Ocean
in the global carbon cycle. The biological processes play an important role along
with the physical and chemical processes of transformation and motion of carbon in
the ocean medium. In particular, phytoplankton, like the nutrient elements,
assimilates dissolved CO2 from the salt water. As a result, an organic substance,
that partially goes to the nutrient chains of the trophic pyramid of a given basin of
the World Ocean and partially descends to bottom sediments, is formed. A totality
of all processes of carbon motion in the ocean medium creates a gradient of the CO2
concentration between surface and deep waters. Therefore, the study of the structure
and functioning of the ocean ecosystems becomes one of the most important and
rapidly developing directions of marine biology. Its various aspects are being
developed in many countries within the framework of the International Biological
Programme. In particular, the international programme JGOFS (Joint Global Ocean
Flux Study) is dedicated to the study of biochemical processes in the ocean in order
to obtain a deeper knowledge of the response of the ocean to external forcings. One
of the goals of such studies is to obtain a method to predict the system’s behaviour
as a result of changes of some of its parameters. However, due to the unique nature
and broad spatial extent of the World Ocean, it is difﬁcult to quantitatively estimate
all the elements of the system at different moments of its development and in
different regions of the World Ocean and, moreover, to assess the effect of their
change on the functioning of the system on the whole. With this aim in view,
regular expeditions are organized, databases of the satellite monitoring of the World
Ocean basins are accumulated, and methods of using the model approach for these
purposes are developed. Of course, an accuracy of assessing the role of water
ecosystems on global changes of GHGs cycles in general strongly depends on a

thorough and accurate description of photosynthesis as a function of the environ-
mental parameters and especially considering its seasonal variations.
The ocean covering approximately 71 % of the planet’s surface gives 1 % of a
substantial amount of food products consumed by humans, the remaining 99 % they
obtain from the cultivated land. The ocean contains 97 % of the Earth’s water, and
oceanographers have stated that only 5 % of the World Ocean has been explored.
The total volume is approximately 1.3 billion cubic kilometers with an average
depth of 3,682 m (Matthew and Walter 2010). It provides food in the form of ﬁsh
and shellﬁsh—about 91 million tons are caught each year. At the same time, the
total amount of organic matter produced in the ocean is approximately equal to that
produced by land vegetation. By rough estimates, the total biomass of nekton
constitutes 5.3 × 109 t. The catch of ﬁsh and other species from the World Ocean is
estimated at 70 × 106 t/year, which constitutes 20 % of protein consumed by
humans. The catch of traditional species is close to a limit (*90–100 × 106 t/year).
However, it is not a limit to the industrial ability of the ocean ecosystems in general,
since the supplies of krill and other biological objects are still used little.
This disagreement between the role of the land and ocean ecosystems in food
production is explained, ﬁrst of all, by the fact that an intensive cultural economy is
realized on land, whereas this cultural economy is weakly developed in the seas and
oceans. Therefore, possible ways of increasing the ocean bioproductivity have not
been applied yet. First, humankind uses the ﬁnal trophic chains of natural com-
munities of the World Ocean: ﬁsh and whales. Each successive trophic level
obtained about 0.1 share of energy accumulated at a previous level. On land, two
levels of organisms (vegetation, herbivorous animals) are used, while in the ocean
and in the seas up to 5 levels. The direct use of non-ﬁsh species will make it
possible to sharply increase an amount of proteins obtained from the ocean.
Second, a question about the transition from free ﬁshing to cultural methods of
economy in the World Ocean is posed; the question of an artiﬁcial increase of
productivity of the biological communities of the ocean. To do this, it is necessary,
ﬁrst of all, to study the methods of controlling the output of the ﬁnal produce in the
biological systems of the World Ocean. To determine the rational ways of affecting
the ocean communities, it is necessary to study their structure and functioning, in
order to understand the production processes, transformations of matter and energy
ﬂux at different trophic levels of the ocean ecosystems. It is also necessary to
develop a theory of control in the biological systems of the coastal waters and the
open ocean, which differ both in natural hydrophysical and biogeochemical
parameters as well as in the extent of anthropogenic impacts.
Marine communities are complicated biological systems of populations of
individual species. As a result of their interaction, communities are in dynamic
development. Their spatial structure is mostly determined by the composition of
numerous biotic and abiotic factors, which depend on a totality of the oceanic
parameters. The latter are determined by the laws of general circulation of the ocean
waters, including tides and ebbs, zones of convergence and divergence, wind and
thermohaline currents, etc.

Ecoinformatics Problems of the World Ocean

In the late 20th century an urgent problem of predicting the dynamics of the
ocean systems in conditions of increasing anthropogenic impacts (chemical poi-
soning, mechanical liquidation of living organisms, environmental changes) as well
as assessing their role in the dynamics of the whole biosphere arose. So, recent
studies of the climatic impact of greenhouse gases have shown that the role of the
World Ocean in this process has been underestimated. In particular, according to
Kondratyev and Johannessen (1993) and which concern the role of the arctic basins
of the World Ocean in the formation of the global CO2 cycle, previous assessments
of this role were incorrect. This is connected with the fact that an account of
biological and gravitational processes playing the combined role of a pump that
pumps carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to deep layers of the ocean was
inadequate in the earlier models of the global biogeochemical carbon cycle.
Therefore, speciﬁed models of the working regime for this pump with climatic
zones taken into account may play an important role in predicting estimates of the
greenhouse effect.
The impact of the ocean ecosystems on the biogeochemical cycles is manifested
through the atmosphere-water border and is usually parameterized based on the
observational data. However, in this impact the vertical structure of the processes
taking place in the ocean medium is very important. The nature of these processes
depends much on external factors. For instance, according to Legendre and
Legendre (1998), in the arctic zones of the World Ocean the patchy structure of the
springtime blossoming of phytoplankton is determined by the winter conditions of
ice formation and the subsequent ice melting. In other zones, these external factors
are pollution of the atmosphere and ocean surface, changes in the phytoplankton
living conditions and functioning of the carbonate system.
Phytoplankton is at one of the initial stages of the trophic hierarchy of the ocean
system. As ﬁeld observations have shown, the World Ocean has a patchy structure
formed by a combination of non-uniform spatial distributions of insolation level,
temperature, salinity, concentration of nutrient elements, hydrodynamic character-
istics, etc. The vertical structure of the phytoplankton distribution is less diverse and
possesses rather universal properties. These properties are manifested through the
existence of one-to-four vertical maxima of phytoplankton biomass.
The variability of the patchy topology and vertical structure is connected with
seasonal cycles and has been well studied experimentally in many climatic zones of
the World Ocean. The typical qualitative and quantitative indicators of this vari-
ability have been found. The combined distributions of abiotic, hydrological, and
biotic components of the ocean ecosystems have been studied.
The complexity and mutual dependence of all the processes in the ocean sub-
stantially hinder the uncovering of the laws of formation of phytoplankton spots and
establishing the correlations between various factors of regulating the trophic
relationships intensity in the ocean ecosystems. For instance, many studies revealed
a close relationship between primary production and phytoplankton amount. At the
same time, this relationship gets broken depending on a combination of the synoptic
situation and insolation. It turns out that an extent of breaking depends much on a
combination of the groups of phytoplankton (Legendre and Legendre 1998).
4.1
The Present Day of the World Ocean
261

An analysis of the accumulated observation data on assessments of the produce
of seas and oceans and an attempt of many authors to uncover the laws of the
produce formation characteristic of various water basins have revealed various laws
in local relationships between productivity and environmental parameters.
An efﬁcient method of studying the vertical structure of the ocean ecosystems is
their numerical modeling based on measurements of their characteristics (Kuck
et al. 2000). To derive the model, it is necessary to know the structure of trophic
relationships in the ecosystems, speciﬁc features of hydrological conditions and
information about other characteristics of the environment. An experience of the
modeling has shown a possibility of an efﬁcient prediction of the dynamics of the
World Ocean communities. An example of such models is a 3-D model of the
ecosystem of the Peruvian current (Krapivin 1996), of the Okhotsk Sea (Aota et al.
1993; Mkrtchyan and Krapivin 2011; Kaevitser et al. 2013; Krapivin and Thu
2001) and others. In all these models the unit of parameterization of the vertical
structure of the ecosystem is central.
4.2 World Ocean and Inland Reservoirs
Acuteness of problems arising because of global climate change is mainly
explained by the uncertainty of many environmental problems connected with the
World Ocean and inland seas. As a result, many countries develop scientiﬁc pro-
grams oriented to the study of global and regional hydrophysical processes both for
understanding environmental processes and for the progress in geopolitical, social-
economic and technical interests (Krapivin et al. 1990, 1991, 1994a, b, 1998c,
2005a, b, 2006a, 2007c). It is clear that the progress in this direction depends on the
complex approach that should be based on new information technologies. An
example of such a program is the Federal Purposeful Program “World Ocean” of
the Russian Federation.
The Basic Program objective is the solution to the following tasks:
• investigation of the World Ocean environment and key processes occurring in it;
• fundamental investigations of interaction processes between the ocean and the
atmosphere including processes of global scale (greenhouse effect, energy and
mass exchange, biogeochemical cycles of carbon and oxygen, etc.);
• investigation of natural environment and resource potential of continental shelf;
• study and monitoring of the World Ocean conditions and hydrometeorological
situation in bordering seas;
• study of ecosystem dynamics and sea biological resources to discover new
aquatories for ﬁshing;
• investigation of structure and evolution of the earth’s crust on the bottom of
oceans and seas;
• prognosis and assessment of the World Ocean mineral resources;
• navigation-hydrographic and hydrometeorological maintenance of national tasks;
262
4
Ecoinformatics Problems of the World Ocean

• research of natural and anthropogenic extreme processes in sea aquatories and
coastal zones (earthquakes, tsunami, wildﬁres, ﬂoods, volcano eruptions, oil
leakages, etc.); and
• monitoring of the World Ocean to detect polluted zones and to assess ecosystem
state.
The solution to these tasks demands the development and the application of new
information technologies. Speciﬁc interest is stimulated by the growing pollution of
coastal seas. An example of such a sea is Baltic Sea, where the inﬂuence of anthro-
pogenic factors plays a signiﬁcant role. North-Western International Cleaner Pro-
duction and Environment Management Centre was organized in Sankt-Petersburg
(Russian Federation) to control these factors. One principal and very important
problem of Baltic Sea environment is the oil hydrocarbon pollution. In connection
with this, Ship Analytics International Company (USA) created the system
CRISISTM oriented to the warning and the elimination of oil hydrocarbon ﬂood. This
system can also model the crisis situation and realize education of disaster over-
coming. The main objective of this system is realized by means of the creation of a
base station for liquidation of oil ﬂoods. This station is located in the zone of Baltic
shipyard and its function is to collect oil products and to promote them for utilization.
Ships are a basic source of Baltic Sea pollution in the Russian zone, because they
make unapproved emissions of processed waters including oil products as well as
Neva River outﬂow. Kondratyev et al. (2002) proposed the solution of the problems
arising here by means of the synthesis of the GIMS, which is described in Chap. 1.
The application of the GIMS to solve the tasks mentioned above can support:
• training information-measuring optical and microwave system of expert level
for operative diagnostics of water quality both in situ and laboratory conditions;
• intellectual simulation model of regional water balance;
• database renewed in on-line mode including the data about pollutant sources of
given territory with characteristics of sewage (volumes, pollutant compositions,
exceeding of limits);
• dislocation and operational status of measuring systems controlling the water
chemistry of dangerous sites; and
• new architecture of antirecessionary situation-analytic centre which collects
information from measuring systems and co-ordinates the GIMS functions to
decision making in operative mode.
Sea oil and gas condensation deposits are usually situated in zones of sufﬁciently
intensive anthropogenic inﬂuences on the environment. Consequently, the task of
designing and creating the ecological monitoring system to control the sea aquatory
must consider the state of the atmospheric and water environments for the adjoining
aquatories.
For the sea aquatory of the oil deposit zone, the practical realization of the GIMS—
technology concept demands a thorough analysis of hydrophysical and synoptic
characteristics and the choice of technical systems to measure the environment
4.2

parameters under the local climate (low temperatures, icing, rough sea state, etc.)
taking into consideration the distance from land. The variations of the interannual
climatic regimes that are connected with changes of the water surface state and of the
insolation are also important. Climate conditions of the functioning of the ecological
monitoring system in the zone of oil extraction put deﬁnite restrictions on the
structure of the measurement system. These restrictions are usually connected with
the absence of possibilities for the free arrangement of the measuring and transmitting
devices in any arbitrary point of the aquatory; and for this reason the tasks of mea-
surements planning and the choice of effective algorithms for data processing are of
great concern.
An investigation of such a dynamic environment as the water systems demands the
creation of complex algorithms for the data processing of the ﬁeld observations
including a set of various models giving a possibility to reconstruct the spatial image
of the studied object basing on the incomplete information. The water systems
(oceans, seas, rivers, etc.) were investigated during last decades by means of ﬂying
and ﬂoating laboratories. This gave the opportunity to develop the effective methods
for the description of the dynamics of the water systems having different spatial scales.
In most cases, the ﬁeld and satellite observations are connected with the measure-
ments of temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, current directions and velocities.
The set of hydrophysical observations is more detailed in the anthropogenic zones.
Let us designate a point on the water surface by φ latitude and by λ longitude.
A rectangular coordinate system (φ, λ, z), where the z axis has the value z = 0 on the
water surface and value z > 0 with depth, is selected to describe the sets of the
observation data. In these coordinates any measurement is represented as a function
ξ(φ, λ, z, t) which is a time-dependent random variable. The processing of the sets of
such values demands the application of special methods. As a rule, these methods
include non-stationarity reduction procedures using spatio-temporal discretization.
The choice of spatio-temporal scales is deﬁned by the dynamic characteristics of the
water space and by the speciﬁc tasks that must be reached. Table 4.1 describes the
scheme of Fig. 4.1 and explains a possible structure of the interconnections between
spatial and temporal scales. It is observed that the accumulation of data sets by the
monitoring system may be realized taking into consideration discrete situations
distinguished in the framework of a problem that should be solved. A certain level
of reliability in the assessment of the system state under study can be achieved only
when a mathematical model is used. It combines space and time into a single
interwoven continuum.
The data sets containing the experimental estimations of the circulation char-
acteristics for the sea environment always include periodical, unperiodical, sta-
tionary and non-stationary ﬂuctuations. That explains why the sets of measurements
should be corrected, taking into account the scalability of the processes under study.
Hence, follows the planning of the special features of the measurements.
The study of the oil pollution of the World Ocean is one of the most important
problems of environmental monitoring. The global scale of this process demands
the application of monitoring systems, giving the possibility of controlling the water
environment over enormous areas. Satellite-based systems are an example of such
264

approaches. An analysis of measurement data shows that remote sensing of the
water surface by means of devices using various wavelengths makes possible to
detect oil spills on the water surface in order to determine the type of oil and to
estimate the oil spill parameters (area, thickness, volume). Remote sensing

techniques based on microwave radiometry allow to determine the oil pollution of
the water surface under arbitrary weather conditions.
An extensive application of remote sensing techniques depends on the knowledge
of the processes of interaction between oil and sea water, its optical and electric
characteristics, the impact of the atmosphere and other factors on the propagation of
electromagnetic waves. The combination of microwave and IR (infrared) ranges with
mathematical modeling techniques is an effective method to discover oil spills on the
water surface. The distinction between the emittance and the temperature of polluted
and fresh water surface areas is the physical base for the remote sensing of oil spills by
means of microwave—and IR—radiometers. The emittance j of the three-layer
system atmosphere-oil-water having smooth boundaries of the sections can
be calculated with α formulae suggested by Kondratyev et al. (1996). Figure 4.2
gives an example of the dependence of the emittance variations Dj for the
atmosphere-oil-water system as a function of the oil spill thickness α.
The oil spill dielectric properties occupy an intermediate position between free
space (atmosphere) and water. As a result, the arising of a ﬁlm leads to the effect of
medium co-ordination (to the decrease in the reﬂection coefﬁcient) and to the
growth of the surface radiobrightness temperature. As the oil ﬁlm thickness
increases, the value TY = κT0 (T0 is the surface temperature) at ﬁrst increases, but
then an interchange of maxima and minima is observed. From Fig. 4.2 it is obvious
that it is necessary to simultaneously measure the radiobrightness temperature by
means of radiometers with different wavelengths in order to remove the uncertainty
in the ﬁlm thickness determination.
Thin ﬁlms, arising under small volumes of spilled oil or in the near-boundary
area of the oil spills, do not change the emittive ability of a smooth water surface in
Fig. 4.2 The emittive ability of oil spills having different thickness (Mitnik 1977). Wavelengths

microwave-range. However, disturbed surface areas covered with thin oil ﬁlms are
characterized by lowered values of TY, due to the suppression of high-frequency
components in the rough sea spectrum. The value and sign of the radiation contrast of
the spills on the clean water background depend on the thickness and optical prop-
erties of the oil ﬁlms, the hydrometeorogical conditions, the time of the day, etc.
Fundamental experimental investigations of water oil pollution by means of
microwave- and IR-radiometers have been described by many authors (Mitnik
1977; Bogorodsky et al. 1976). Field experiments have shown that satisfactory
results were attained when radiometers with wavelengths of 8–12 μm, and 0.34,
0.8, 1.5 and 8.5 cm were used. The sensitivity of the radiometer relative to its
antenna inputs equaled 0.1–0.3 K under the time constant of 1 s. The experiments
were performed with a ﬂying laboratory at a height from 100 to 200 m. The
radiometers were calibrated using blackbody radiobrightness temperatures or by
means of calculations for a calm water surface under a cloudy sky. Thin ﬁlms are
recognized with high accuracy by means of IR-radiometers. Most thick ﬁlms are
detected with high reliability by means of microwave radiometers.
The oil ﬁlm thickness can be estimated by the dependence of the radiobrightness
temperature variation ΔTY, on the emittance ability, Dj:
DTY ¼ Dj T0  1  TY;atm=T0



;
where T0 is the surface temperature, TY,atm is the atmosphere radiobrightness
temperature calculated by radiosensing data and the value (1 −TY,atm/T0) charac-
terizes the inﬂuence of the atmosphere.
The geometric parameters of the oil ﬁlms are deﬁned by means of photogram-
metric methods the base of which is the spectrozonal photo-picture on the various
wavelengths. The ranges 0.4–0.5 and 0.7–0.8 μm are the most informative for
solving this task. The oil products registered with wavelengths 0.4–0.5 μm are a
light spot upon the dark background of the water image. The image registered by
wavelengths 0.7–0.8 μm helps to decipher the water surface.
The registration of the oil spills can be realized by means of active sensing
methods. For example, the oil spill exposed by the near ultraviolet radiation begins
ﬂuorescence in the visible range (0.6–0.7 μm). This ﬂuorescence can be registered
by the adaptive identiﬁer in the real time regime (Krapivin et al. 2001).
The above methods allow us to consider two versions of the monitoring system
for controlling the gas extraction zone. The ﬁrst version corresponds to the oil
extraction system situated completely below the water surface where the stationary
position of remote sensing systems is impossible. In this case, the monitoring
system structure has submerged measuring subsystems ﬁxed by anchors and
emerged subsystems placed on ﬂying or ﬂoating laboratories. The estimation of the
concentration of pollutants emitted to the atmosphere is realized by modeling
calculations. For this aim, the gradient of the gas components and the advection
speed are measured in the surface layer. Moreover, it is possible to use the emerged
measuring sub-systems.
4.2
World Ocean and Inland Reservoirs
267

Speciﬁc attention is given to the seas and inland reservoirs. A typical example is
the Baltic Sea (Knuuttila et al. 2011). This region is controlled by the Helsinki
Commission which is concerned about reliable data on inputs into the Baltic Sea
from land-based sources, as well as information about the signiﬁcance of different
pollution sources. Data on waterborne inputs to the Baltic Sea and the development
in these inputs have been even more important after the agreement on the
HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP) in 2007. The BSAP recognizes the need
to reduce nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) inputs to a maximum allowable level.
BSAP is an ambitious programme to restore the good ecological status of the Baltic
marine environment by 2021.
The Baltic Sea is a relatively young and ecologically vulnerable water body. The
state of the pelagic and coastal waters has suffered from human activities. Rhein-
heimer (1998) has given a detailed analysis of the pollution problems related to the
Baltic Sea at the end of the 20th century. The health of the Baltic Sea has been
seriously damaged since the 1960s due to the excessive pollution from the countries
in its catchment area. The Baltic Sea is almost totally surrounded by land and,
therefore, more endangered by pollution than other marine areas. The sources of
marine pollution are municipal and industrial waste that outputs directly into the sea
or via rivers, and atmospheric inputs mainly from trafﬁc and agriculture. The
increase of inorganic plant nutrients (NH3, NOx, PO4) caused eutrophication and,
consequently, oxygen depletion in coastal bottom waters as well as in the depths of
the open sea. In the anoxic sediments, hydrogen sulﬁde can be produced by protein-
decomposing and sulfate-reducing bacteria. The bottom fauna will be destroyed and
only H2S tolerant microorganisms can survive. Originating from cellulose manu-
facturing and from paper mills, large amounts of poisonous chlorinated compounds
contaminated the coastal waters of Sweden and Finland until the 1980s. Most of
this material is still present in sediments of the central Baltic Sea and can be
resuspended by near bottom currents. To reduce pollution and improve the situation
in the Baltic Sea, the surrounding countries organized the Helsinki Convention,
which came into force on 3.5.1980. The Helsinki Commission (HELCOM),
founded in 1974, acts as coordinator and is responsible for the enforcement of the
Baltic monitoring program and international research projects. The activities of
HELCOM have led to the reduction of dangerous pollutants which in turn has
caused the regeneration of ﬂora and fauna in some areas. Rheinheimer (1998)
expressed that further improvements can be expected.
The beginning of 21st century is characterized by attempts to harmonize the
policies and actions in the coastal countries through various conventions and pro-
grams in order to improve the state of the Baltic Sea. Knuuttila et al. (2011) present
the main results from the PLC-5 Project. These include quantiﬁed annual water-
borne total loads of nitrogen and phosphorus from 1994 to 2008 to provide a basis
for evaluating any trends in the total ﬂow normalized waterborne inputs to the
Baltic Sea. The contributions from different point and diffuse sources, including the
natural background load, are also estimated and described. An estimate of the total
inputs of some heavy metals is also included. Furthermore, the report includes
268

assessments of the major remaining gaps to reach the HELCOM Baltic Sea Action
Plan (BSAP) nutrient reduction target as well the need for further measures.
Russia’s Baltic Sea pollution problems are mainly connected with St-Peters-
burg’s ﬂow of industrial waste into the sea. Neva River and ports are basic sources
of pollutants carried out to sea from Russian territory. The Neva is the only river
ﬂowing from Lake Ladoga. It ﬂows through the city Saint Petersburg, three smaller
towns of Shlisselburg, Kirovsk and Otradnoye, and dozens of settlements. The river
is navigable throughout and is part of the Volga–Baltic Waterway and White Sea—
Baltic Canal. This means that Baltic Sea pollution problems have to be solved in the
framework of Russian national ecological strategy.
Marine pollution occurs when harmful or potentially harmful effects result from
the entry of chemicals, particles, industrial, agricultural and residential waste, noise,
or the spread of invasive organisms into the ocean. Most sources of marine pol-
lution are land based. The pollution often comes from nonpoint sources such as
agricultural runoff, wind-blown debris and dust. Nutrient pollution, a form of water
pollution, refers to the contamination by excessive inputs of nutrients. It is a pri-
mary cause of eutrophication of surface waters, in which excess nutrients, usually
nitrogen or phosphorus, stimulate algal growth. There are many different ways to
categorize, and examine the inputs of pollution into marine ecosystems:
• Pollutants enter rivers and the sea directly from urban sewerage and industrial
waste discharges, sometimes in the form of hazardous toxic wastes.
• Surface runoff from farming, as well as urban runoff and runoff from the con-
struction of roads, buildings, ports, channels, and harbours, can carry soil and
particles laden with carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and minerals.
• Ships can pollute waterways and oceans in many ways.
• Pathway of marine pollution through the atmosphere is realized by means of
wind transport of dust and debris.
The solution to many problems connected with the marine pollution can be
realized by means of the GIMS technology application.
4.3 Interactions Between the Atmosphere and the Ocean
The knowledge of exchange processes between the atmosphere and the ocean is
very important in assessing the greenhouse effect of CO2. In most of the known
models of the global CO2 cycle the relationship between partial pressure of CO2
dissolved in water (pc) and general concentration CU of inorganic carbon in the
surface waters is calculated based on the buffer coefﬁcient:
n ¼ pc  pc;o


CU;o CU  CU;o

1=pc;o;
4.2
World Ocean and Inland Reservoirs

where the “o” index refers to the pre-industrial period. However, numerous
observations show that the use of only this coefﬁcient when calculating the ﬂuxes
HC
2 and HC
3 (Fig. 1.30 and Table 1.10) gives rough estimates, without taking into
account the effect of many factors.
One of the ﬁrst attempts to consider the spatial heterogeneity of the World Ocean
and to simulate the impact of temperature gradients on the CO2 exchange between
the upper layer of the ocean and the atmosphere has been made by Bjorkstrom
(1979). An idea to divide the World Ocean basins into two parts corresponding to
warm and cold waters has been later developed by numerous authors (Nefedova
and Tarko 1993). Pervaniuk (2001) developed this scheme dividing the World
Ocean surface into 211 homogeneous basins. This discretization was based on
combining the basins 4o × 5o in size. The adjacent cells of this grid with similar
directions of the vertical components of the water ﬂow velocities are combined into
one water basin. The average annual ﬁeld of the water ﬂow velocities was con-
sidered at a depth of 75 m. The size of water basins was determined taking into
account the dependence of CO2 ﬂuxes on the climatic factors. A maximum of the
latitudinal size of the basin was assumed to be 8o. Above 80oN the World Ocean is
presented as one site.
A most complete study of the physical mechanisms of the CO2 transport under
different conditions of the water-air interface has been carried out in Alexeev et al.
(1992). Here for the ﬁrst time, detailed measurements of CO2 ﬂuxes have been
made, and their dependence on the parameters of the state of the atmosphere-ocean
interface has been analyzed, taking into account the wind-driven mixing, the
appearance of foam on the water surface, waves breaking, and pollution. Parametric
descriptions of the process of the ocean-atmosphere gas exchange have been pro-
posed for each type of the water-air interface conditions (McGillis et al. 2001). For
instance, it was shown that the intensity of gas exchange grows substantially as the
sea roughness and foam layer increase. For a foam layer 5 cm thick, the rate of gas
exchange exceeds the gas exchange across a free surface by a factor of 2.4. This fact
is important for the evaluation of the gas exchange in the tidal zones and strong-
storm regions, where the foam stretches may be several cm thick. The result con-
nected with the availability of the surface active substances (SASs) in the upper
layer of the ocean is also very interesting. When SASs reach about 7.8 × 10−4 %
(volume), other conditions being equal, the rate of gas exchange reduces to 60 %.
However, where there is foam formation this effect decreases substantially.
On the whole, over the World Ocean basins the estimates of the CO2 ﬂux
between the atmosphere and the upper layer of the ocean vary between 16 and
1,250 mol/m2/year). This variability means that the global model of the CO2 bio-
geochemical cycle should accurately consider every feature mentioned.
In a stationary state the hydrosphere and atmosphere are in a certain equilibrium
with respect to CO2 exchange, being broken with ﬂuctuations of temperature, ocean
surface level, vertical circulation regime, etc. An amount of CO2 assimilated and
emitted in the process of exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere consti-
tutes 55.6 × 109 tC/year. The algae assimilate 16.7 × 109 tC/year from the
270
4
Ecoinformatics Problems of the World Ocean

atmosphere. These values are non-uniformly distributed over the water surface and
strongly vary in time. The characteristic place in the CO2 exchange is occupied by
the Arctic Ocean, whose low temperatures determine a high absolute content of
CO2 dissolved in the surface layer in any season. On the average, in the summer,
the arctic waters mainly assimilate CO2 and emit O2 to the atmosphere, whereas in
winter they emit CO2 and assimilate O2. This clearly expressed seasonal change is
smoothed down in the basins of the North Atlantic seas where a decrease of the ice
cover, an increase of the period of photosynthetic activity and the existing fall-
winter vertical convection lead to an intensiﬁcation of the gas exchange with the
atmosphere towards prevailing of the HC
3 ﬂux. Carbon constitutes 0.18 × 109 tC/
year of the amount of CO2 assimilated from the atmosphere. The contribution of the
arctic water basins into the removal of excess carbonic acid from the atmosphere is
small compared to the total assimilation of CO2 by the World Ocean, which is
estimated at 5.2–6.6 × 109 tC/year, (Table 4.2). However, this assessment is rather
underestimated, considering the results obtained by Kelley (1987). The average
estimates show that the partial pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere exceeds that in
the arctic seas by 110 ppm. The CO2 deﬁcit in the marine medium takes place
mainly during springtime blossoming and is estimated at *450 gC/m2. This means
that the CO2 ﬂux from the atmosphere into the marine medium can vary from 1.5 to
4.0 gC/m2/day. This assessment changes considerably as a function of longitude.
For instance, the Norwegian Sea has a deﬁcit of the CO2 partial pressure between
20 and 50 ppm, and the Bering Sea ΔpCO2 ≅70 ppm. A clear linear correlation is
observed with the proportion coefﬁcient 10 ppm CO2 per °C between the CO2
content in the sea water and its temperature.

In conclusion, the arctic waters play the role of a pump that pumps away carbon
dioxide from the atmosphere. Therefore, a detailed study of this process is needed
to specify the global model of carbon cycle and to raise the accuracy of the esti-
mation of the greenhouse effect due to emissions of anthropogenic CO2.
On the whole, in the synthesis of the global model of the CO2 biogeochemical
cycle, the unit that simulates the ocean part of this cycle must describe the func-
tioning of the ocean carbonate system. Alexeev et al. (1992), analyzed the system
CO2-HCO3-CO3
2−and the distribution of pH values of the ocean waters and found
out that more than 80 % of dissolved carbon dioxide are in the form of hydro-
carbonate ion of HCO3. This means that only a ﬁrst stage of dissociation of car-
bonic acid can be reliably considered in the synthesis of the model of the ocean
carbonate system.
On global scales, in the World Ocean regions with cold waters (northern lati-
tudes, upwelling zones) the ﬂux HC
3 prevails while in the warm waters the ﬂux HC
2 .
The dynamics of this regime is maintained by reactions that take place in the
hydrosphere between CO2 and water resulting in the formation of carbonic acid:
HCO3 þ H2O
,
H2CO3 þ OH ;
CO2
3 þ 2H2O
,
H2CO3 þ 2OH ;
In the salt water, there are dissolved carbon dioxide, non-dissociated molecules
of H2CO3, anions of HCO3, and CO3
2−. They all are in equilibrium:
CO2 þ H2O , H2CO3 , HCO
3 þ Hþ , CO2
3 þ 2Hþ
An equilibrium state between carbonic acid bicarbonate and carbonate ions
establishes rapidly. The solution of CO2 and formation of H2CO3 take place much
slower. However, since many authors dispute the availability of H2CO3, the sum-
marized concentration of CO2 and H2CO3 should be considered, denoting it as
[CO2]. Let us introduce notations to characterize the total concentration of inter-
mediate components

Based on (4.7) through (4.10), and considering the experimental data, Eriksson
(1963) showed that a 1 °C increase of the temperature of the upper layer of the
marine medium causes an increase of the partial pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere
by 4.2–5.8 %, a 1 % decrease of the water volume implies an increase of the partial
pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere by 3 %, with 1 % of carbon dioxide in the water
medium precipitating as CaCO3. With variations of the equilibrium state in deep
layers of the hydrosphere a 1 % output of CO2 in the form of gas is followed by a
1 % sediment of CO2 in the form of CaCO3. Moreover, variations in the CO2 partial
pressure correlate with changes of the concentration of phosphorus P, so that a
decrease of P in deep layers by 1 % leads to an increase of pc by 5.6 %.
4.3
Interactions Between the Atmosphere and the Ocean
273

Eriksson (1963) found out that a 1 % increase of alkalinity causes a 2.26 %
decrease of the CO2 partial pressure in the atmosphere and a 98 % reduction of total
CO2 supply in the hydrosphere. When there is no external input of Ca into the
hydrosphere, a 1 % increase of alkalinity causes an increase of the rate of CaCO3
deposition and the total alkalinity decreases by 0.92 %. Thus, a 1 % increase of the
water alkalinity is equivalent to an increase of pH by 0.5.
An equilibrium between various components of the hydrospheric carbonate
system depends on temperature and pressure, a combination of which correlates
with pH so that at a given temperature and pressure the equilibrium is a function of
only pH = −lg[H+]. The effect of temperature on pH in the ﬁrst approximation can
be described by the Merrey law (Ivanov 1978): ΔpH = −0.0111ΔT, valid at pH ∈
[7.5, 8.4], T ∈[1–30] oC, and salinity from 10 to 40o/oo. The dependence of pH on
pressure pc follows the Buch-Grippenberg law: pH = dΔpc, where, on the average,
d = −0.0254. A more accurate presentation of this law is given in Table 4.3.
The connection between the equilibrium condition of CO2 exchange and pH on the
atmosphere-ocean border is such that when the CO2 pressure in the atmosphere
reaches 330 × 10−6 atm, equilibrium occurs at 20 °C for pH = 8.16 and at 0 °C for
pH = 8.11. For a lower pH value, the ocean assimilates CO2, while for a higher pH
value the ocean emits CO2. Hence, the structure of the ocean carbonate system should
be thoroughly studied in order to describe the functions of the ﬂuxes HC
2 and HC
3 on the
atmosphere-ocean border. A simpliﬁed description of these ﬂuxes is usually based on
the comparison of the partial pressures of CO2 in the atmosphere and in the ocean.
According to the data in Alexeev et al. (1992), the ﬂuxes HC
2 and HC
3 are well
approximated by the function HC
i = ki(pa−pc)1/2, where pa and pc are the partial
pressures of CO2 in the atmosphere and in the ocean, respectively. The partial pressure
of CO2 in the atmosphere at the level of the ocean can be calculated using the formula:
pa ¼ 0:421542  1018 MC 273:15 þ T
ð
Þ;
where MC is the CO2 mass in tons and T is the air temperature in °C.
According to Bjorkstrom (1979), the functional dependence of pc on the
parameters of the ocean carbonate system can be presented in the form of
pc = [CO2]/K0. From the condition of chemical equilibrium, according to the
Eqs. (4.4) and (4.5), it follows:

The exchange processes taking place on the atmosphere-ocean border have been
experimentally studied by Kiseleva (1990), Zaitsev (1988), and others. In their
works it has been shown that at high wind speeds the rate of gas exchange sharply
increases. This is connected with the mechanism of the foam formation on wave
crests as well as an intensive catching of air bubbles and their penetration beneath
the water surface. The dependence of the amount of spray Q on the height over the
water surface is well approximated by a linear function. For instance, for the wind
speed V = 11.1 m/s this approximation is (Kiseleva 1990):

Experimental estimates of the net gas transport due to the droplet mechanism
have shown that the CO2 ﬂux between water and air can vary from 1.44 mg CO2/
m2/h in the absence of wave breaking to 26.6 mg CO2/m2/h. The rate of the gas
exchange on the atmosphere-ocean border is markedly affected by the foam for-
mation on the ocean surface. In this case, the rate of the gas exchange can increase
up to 28 %. All this suggests the conclusion that a detailed modeling of the
mechanisms of the atmosphere-water CO2 transport is needed. The satellite World
Ocean monitoring allows one to identify the zones of foam formation and, hence,
along with the modeling of the processes of foam formation, to perform direct
measurements of the areas of the foam-covered basins.
The mechanism of the air bubbles behaviour in the upper layer of the ocean has
been poorly studied. The available theoretical results are based, as a rule, on a
number of suppositions, which in many cases can drastically distort the ideas about
real processes of the gas exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean. Among
these suppositions the following have been used most often:
• air bubbles in the upper layer of the ocean practically instantly acquire the
temperature of the environment, since the molecular coefﬁcient of heat con-
ductivity exceeds that of gases by 2–3 orders of magnitude;
• air bubbles in water do not affect its dynamics; and
• air bubbles do not merge in water.
The size of air bubbles in water varies constantly because of their gradual
solution. The gas ﬂux through the bubbles is described by the relationship:
Q ¼ 4pRD Dp

Re is the Reynolds number (Re = 2vR/D), Pe—is the Pekle number (Pe = vR/v),
v is water viscosity, v is the velocity of the bubble’s motion, D is the coefﬁcient of
the gas molecular diffusion.
Of course, the ocean surface condition substantially affects its gas exchange with
the atmosphere. The size of the basins covered with either foam or white caps
directly depends on a combination of the parameters such as wind speed, water
temperature, and sea currents. An analysis of the statistical characteristics of the
patchy pattern of the ocean surface made by many experts makes it possible to
describe the percentage distribution of the areas covered with foam (Sf) and white
caps (Sl) with the following binary functions of wind speed V (at a height of 10 m):

It is clear that the structure of the atmosphere-ocean border can affect the gas
exchange within widely varying values of ﬂuxes HC
2 and HC
3 (see Fig. 1.30).
Unfortunately, the level of knowledge of the laws of changes of the atmosphere-
ocean border structure as a function of synoptic situations does not permit a clear
estimation of the limits of detailing the processes taking place on this border, to obtain
the values of the ﬂuxes HC
2 and HC
3 close to real ones. This means that at this stage of
the synthesis of the global model of the CO2 cycle some uncertainty still exists.
4.4 The Zonal Model of the Global Carbon Cycle
in the Atmosphere-Ocean System
Consider one of the versions of parameterization of the carbon dioxide global
dynamics in the atmosphere-ocean system proposed and studied by Nefedova
(1994). The spatial heterogeneity of the World Ocean is approximated by the zonal
scheme in accordance with the latitudinal dependence of the climatic processes as
well as processes of mixing in the atmosphere and in the oceans. There are 14
latitudinal zones 10o in size. In the vertical, there are three layers in the World
Ocean: the upper quasi-homogeneous layer (UQHL) with a time-dependent
thickness, thermocline, and deep ocean. As a result, the World Ocean is divided
into 42 volume parts. An upwelling is assumed to exist between 40oN and 40oS
along with a downwelling in high latitudes. In the UQL the water ﬂows poleward

(Fig. 1.27). Over each water basin, the atmosphere is simulated by a point model.

The partial pressure of CO2 dissolved in the surface waters is proportional to its

describe the functioning of the ocean carbonate system. For the quantitative solu-
tion of this system one can use, for instance, the methods of secants. As a result, we

4.5 Modelling the Carbon Cycle in the World Ocean
Along with the physical-chemical processes of transformation of carbon com-
pounds in the hydrosphere mentioned above, the general circulation in the World
Ocean plays an important role in their long-range transport. According to the
available estimates, about 80 % (*1.7 Gt) of organic matter formed in the process
of photosynthesis descends to deeper layers and oxidizes giving CO2. This process
is balanced by a slow lifting of water, and thereby a situation for a stable CO2
exchange is formed. However, in local situations there are strong deviations from
the stable conditions, which can be described only by the scheme of the spatial-
temporal structure of the ocean waters motion. The block-scheme of this structure
identiﬁes the surface, intermediate, deep, and bottom waters as well as the currents
topography on every horizon. The simulation models of the World Ocean circu-
lation widely vary in the scientiﬁc literature, therefore the development of this part
of the global model unit is not difﬁcult.
Following Nitu et al. (2000b), by the depth z the ocean can be divided into four
basic layers: photic to well-heated depths (ΩU = U[zi,zi+1], z0 = 0; i = 0, 1, …,
m – 1); intermediate (ΩP = U[zi,zi+1], i = m, …, m + n – 1); deep (ΩL = U[zi,zi+1],
i = m + n, …, m + n + l – 1), and bottom ΩF. By the hydro-physical-ecological
characteristics the layer ΩU as a function of latitude φ, longitude λ, and season t can
be attributed to warm or cold waters, the layer ΩP is photic but always with low
water temperatures, in the layer ΩL the phytoplankton is not produced. Finally, the
layer ΩF plays the role of a boundary layer.
On the average, the layer ΩU has the area 360 × 1012 m2 and depth zm ≅75 m,
the warm waters covering area 240 × 1012 m2. The layer ΩP is located at depths
280

Ecoinformatics Problems of the World Ocean

from zm to zm+n ≅200 m. In concrete model realizations given in Krapivin and
Kondratyev (2002) the following assumptions have been made: m = 10, n = 2, l = 8.
The vertical CO2 transport in the ocean is determined by advective ﬂuxes HC
19;ij and
gravitational sedimentation of dead organic matter (the ﬂux HC
20;ij). An advective
transport from the i-th into the j-th reservoir of the ocean is considered proportional to
the concentration of carbon in the respective reservoirs: HC
19;ij = λ2,ijCa,i (a = U,P,L),
where λ2,ij = Vij/Vi, Vij is the water volume transported per unit time from the i-th
reservoir into the j-th reservoir; Vi is the volume of the i-th reservoir.
The following algorithm is widely used for the parameterization of the process of
carbon sedimentation. The ﬂux under unit area of the ocean is supposed to decrease
exponentially with depth. If we denote the inﬂow of organic matter in the i-th reservoir
as gi and the net outﬂow of organic matter from the water surface as H20T, we obtain:

where σi is the area of the i-th reservoir, Ds is the characteristic time of the organic

sition in each reservoir is equal to:

However, if the time of the transition of the organic matter particles from one layer
to another is short compared to Ds, then it is better to take HC
20;i ¼ k1Ca;i; HC
16;i ¼
k4CF;i: In addition to these ﬂuxes, one should take into account the ﬂuxes of detritus
decomposition, solution of bottom sediments, and carbon consumption in the process
of photosynthesis:
HC
17;i ¼ Const:; HC
18;i ¼ k3DL;i; HC
22;i ¼ k3DU;i; HC
21;i ¼ C31RU;i:
The estimates for the modeled parameters of the particular oceanic processes of
carbon cycle scatter widely. For instance, from the data of various authors the
estimates of assimilation of carbon from the hydrosphere in the process of photo-
synthesis range from 10 to 155 Gt C/year. The value 127.8 Gt C/year is the most
widely used. However, because of large dispersions of these estimates the calcu-
lation of the C31 coefﬁcient is fraught with a great uncertainty and therefore
numerical experiments with the use of other, more accurate data are required in
order to be speciﬁed.
Finally, let us suppose the surface layers of the ocean are ﬁlled with carbon due to
its run-offfrom the land HC
24;i ¼ C7Wsio; HC
23;i ¼ C8WHio; where Wsio and WHio are the
river and underground run-offs into the World Ocean, respectively.

4.6 Organic Carbon and Oceanic Ecosystems
4.6.1 Models of the Oceanic Ecosystems
Each element of the ocean ecosystem A can be described by α number of param-
eters, and the connection between the elements can be presented as the connection
between the respective parameters. Then, on the whole, the ecosystem A can be
described by N time-dependent parameters x*(t) = {xj(t), j = 1,…,N}. The structure
∣A(t)∣and behaviour A tð Þ of the ecosystem A which can be observed in more or less
detail, are the functions of these parameters. Therefore the ecosystem itself
A(t) = {∣A(t)∣, A tð Þ}, as a collection of the structure and behaviour, is the function of
these parameters:
A tð Þ ¼ F x tð Þ
ð
Þ
ð4:15Þ
Hence, according to (4.15) with a change of the time t the ecosystem A will be
characterized by the trajectory in the (N + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space. The
following abstract formation will be considered a model of the ecosystem A(t):
AM tð Þ ¼ FM x;M


;
ð4:16Þ
that depends on M ≤N components of the vector x*(t) ({x*,M(t)}∈{x*(t)}) and
considers all the connections existing between them.
The nearer M is to N and the more completely the connections between the vector
x*,M(t) components are taken into account, the less is a disagreement of the trajectories
of the ecosystem A(t) and its model AM(t). The latter can be measured by any natural
measure, for instance, by a maximum of absolute difference of all the respective
coordinates of trajectories or by the integral of absolute difference of all respective
coordinates for a ﬁnal time period. In other words, introduce some goal functional
V ¼ Q fxi tð Þg
ð
Þ
ð4:17Þ
on the trajectory of the ecosystem A(t). The form of the Q function is determined by
the requirements made by the system A to the environment. The natural evolu-
tionary process is considered to lead to an optimal system and therefore the system
Aopt,M (t), which ensures an extremum of the functional (4.17), can be considered an
optimal model of the ecosystem A.
The value of disagreement between the trajectories of the ecosystem A and an
optimal model Aopt,M(t) is affected by the degree of correspondence of the goal
functional V chosen by the relationship (4.17) to a real goal A of the ecosystem
A. The set G = {A1, …, Ar, …, Am} of possible reliable goals {Ar} of the ecosystem
can be derived on the basis of the experience accumulated by oceanologists. Then,
determining Aopt,M,r = gr(Ar), Ar∈G, we obtain a limited assembly of possible
optimal systems Aopt,M,r (r = 1, …, m), whose trajectories together with the tra-
jectory of the ecosystem A, are within the space of possible trajectories. If we ﬁnd
282

this, we can ﬁnd the most reliable goal of the ecosystem

According to the principles mentioned above, the derivation of a numerical
model of the ocean ecosystem A (Fig. 4.3) requires either a detailed description of
its states or derivation of an adequate complex of numerical models of energy
exchange between the trophic levels, taking place in A, as well as interactions of the
biotic, abiotic, and hydrophysical factors. Of course, in this case an availability of a
certain set of hypothesis is assumed concerning the character of the balance rela-
tionships in the ecosystem A.
The basic hypothesis is that in the ecosystem A the only original source of
energy and matter for all forms of life is the solar radiation energy (E). According to
numerous theoretical and experimental studies, the sun light penetration into deep
layers of the ocean follows an exponential law

where E0 = E(φ, λ, 0, t) is the illumination of the ocean surface, α is the coefﬁcient
of light absorption by the ﬁltered sea water; δ, β, and ν are the coefﬁcients of light
attenuation due to phytoplankton (p), detritus (d), and zooplankton (Z), respec-
tively; u and ζ are the parameters chosen in a concrete situation to bring E(φ, λ, z, t)
closer to a real pattern of illumination changing with depth. It must be noted that the
impact of the biomass of other trophic levels on water transparency is considered to
be negligibly small.
Illumination affects the rate of photosynthesis Rp. The Rp parameter as a function
of E has a maximum at an optimal value of Emax, which drifts from this critical
value when the illumination increases or decreases. A maximum of Rp at various
latitudes φ is located at depths varying as a function of season (i.e. sun elevation).
Thus, this variability with depth is most pronounced in the tropical zones. On the
average, the photosynthesis maximum is located at depths 10–30 m, and in the open
water bodies it can be observed at depths below 30 m. Here Emax = 65–85 cal/cm2/
day. Beginning from the depths where E = 20–25 cal/cm2/day, photosynthesis
decreases in proportion to E. An apparent suppression of phytoplankton by light is
observed at E > 100 cal/cm2/day. These estimates are quite different in the northern
latitudes, where the photosynthesis maximum is located—as a rule—on the surface.
The rate of photosynthesis at a depth z depends on the water temperature TW, the
concentration of biogenic elements n, and the phytoplankton biomass p, as well as
on other factors, which are not considered here. To express this dependence, var-
ious equations are used, which in either form reﬂect the limiting role of the elements
E, n, and p. Considering that @p=p@z→0 at n →0 and @p=p@z →const with
increasing n, the following function is taken as the basic one to describe the
photosynthesis intensity at a depth z:

k is the proportion coefﬁcient; k0(TW) is the function characterizing the dependence of
the rate of photosynthesis on the water temperature TW; Amax is an assimilation
number in the region of maximum photosynthesis (an increment per unit weight of
the phytoplankton organisms); γ1, γ2, θ, and m are the constants the choice of which
can determine the species characteristics of the phytoplankton elements. For Amax
the following estimates are valid: Amax = 5.94Emax in the region of the photosynthesis
minimum and 2.69Emax for other regions. According to these estimates, an
assimilation number of the tropical phytoplankton in the region of the maximum
photosynthesis
averages
11–12
mgC/h.
Thus,
for
the
Peru
upwelling
Amax = 6.25 mgC/h. The light saturation of photosynthesis in the equatorial regions is
reached at 9 cal/cm2/day.

As for the dependence of k0(TW), the speciﬁc intensity of the phytoplankton
photosynthesis ﬁrst increases with the temperature changing from low to high
values, reaches in some interval of temperatures a maximum value optimal for p,
and then, with the further increase of the temperature it begins to decrease. Near the
maximum the following approximation is often used:

The dependence of the rate of photosynthesis on the concentration of nutrient
elements n(φ, λ, z, t) (phosphorus, silicon, nitrogen, and others), expressed in the
formula (4.19) by the exponential term, is, of course, more complicated. The
nutrient elements are one of the most important parts of the ecosystem, since they
regulate the energy ﬂux in the ecosystem. The nutrient elements supplies are spent
in the process of photosynthesis at a rate Rn, usually approximated by the
expression Rn = δRp, where δ is the proportion coefﬁcient. The nutrient elements
supplies are replenished due to their sweeping out with the lifting of deep waters,
where their supplies are formed as a result of chemical processes of the dead
organic matter decomposition. This process is controlled by several abiotic con-
ditions which are characteristic of various climatic zones of the World Ocean. The
vertical ﬂux of nutrient elements is determined by conditions of water mixing. In
the tropical zones, where the vertical structure of the water has a clear 3-layer
conﬁguration with a layer where the temperature leaps suddenly (the layer of
thermocline), the vertical motion of nutrient elements is conﬁned to this layer. In the
water bodies where the thermocline is located at depths 40–100 m, the upper layer
is usually poor in nutrient elements, and their input to this layer takes place only in
the zones of upwelling. In this case, the average rate of the vertical water lifting
beneath the thermocline varies within 10–3–10–2 cm/s, and in the zones of
upwelling (break-through of the thermocline) it can reach 0.1 cm/s.
4.6.2 Equations of the World Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics
The entire volume of ocean water is considered as a single biocenosis, in which the
ﬂux of organic matter produced in the surface layers and then descending to
maximum depths of the ocean is the main connecting factor. All model parameters
are assumed to be able to change as functions of place and time, and their para-
metric description is made by average characteristics (i.e., deterministic models).
Let us suppose the food bonds between trophic levels are adequately described
by the Ivlev model (i.e., the consumption of various kinds of food by the i-th trophic
level is proportional to the efﬁciency of their biomasses). Taking into account the
diagram of food bonds shown in Fig. 4.3 and the structure of the trophic pyramid of
a typical ocean ecosystem, we can consider each trophic level in detail.
Bacterioplankton b plays an important role in the trophic chains of the ocean. By
the available estimates, not less than 30 % of the bacterioplankton mass is in natural
4.6

aggregates exceeding 3–5 μ in size, therefore the ﬁltrates can feed on this biomass.
This fact must be taken into account when deriving a model of the ecosystem, since
in many regions of the World Ocean the bacteria production is comparable with the
production of phytoplankton (Kolber et al. 2001). Bacteria taking a special place in
the trophic pyramid, differ by a variable exchange, strongly decreasing with the
deﬁcit of food, which is followed by the respective decrease of the rate of their
growth. The food for bacteria is mainly detritus d and dissolved organic matter
g emitted by phytoplankton (Hansell and Carlson 2002). As a result, the ration for
bacteria can be described by the Ivlev formula

Zooplankton is an important trophic element in the ocean ecosystem. In the
scheme of Fig. 4.3 it is presented by an integral level Z, which implies the presence
of a large number of sub-levels with the intersecting trophic bonds. Zooplankton
consumes phyto- and bacterioplankton. Zooplankton itself feeds a lot of animals, in
the scheme of Fig. 4.3 denoted as nekton r and detritofugs D.
Describe the zooplankton ration by the Ivlev formula:
RZ ¼ kZ 1  exp mB




;
ð4:28Þ
where B is the biomass of the accessible food
B ¼ max 0; B  Bmin
f
g


; kZ is a
maximum of the ration with an excess of food, ν is the coefﬁcient characterizing the
level of starvation. The ration maximum is assumed to be equal to the needs of
food, which—in turn—are determined by the exchange intensity T1 and a maxi-
mum possible increment P1 at a given intensity of exchange. Both latter parameters
are related to the coefﬁcient q2 = P1/(P1 + T1), so that we obtain:
kZ ¼ T1u 1  q2;max


;
where 1/u is the food assimilation, q2,max = max q2.
The formula (4.28) implies that with a small amount of food the ration of zoo-
plankton grows in proportion to the amount of food, but as the ration approaches to a
maximum of kZ, its dependence on B diminishes. Since in fact one trophic level never
eats out the other, there is a limitation in (4.28) that establishes RZ = 0 at B ≤Bmin,
where Bmin is a minimum of the unconsumed food biomass. In (4.26) the p parameter
plays the same role, but in the process of the phytoplankton cells’ mortality.
Thus, a change of the zooplankton biomass follows the law described by the
following differential equation:

the losses of the zooplankton biomass due to unconsumed food, expenditures on
respiration and mortality, respectively. Let us describe the latter three parameters by
relationships
HZ ¼ hZRZ; TZ ¼ tZZ; MZ ¼ ðlZ þ lZ;1ZÞZ;
ð4:30Þ
where the coefﬁcients hZ, tZ, μZ, and μZ,1 are determined empirically for a concrete
species of zooplankton.
As seen from (4.29), zooplankton is considered as a passive element of the
ecosystem subject to physical processes of transference in space with the motion of
water masses. However, zooplankton is known to migrate mainly in the vertical
direction. In the given model a simple mechanism can be used to simulate the
process of the vertical migration of zooplankton. For this purpose, let us divide the
whole water thickness into two layers: 0 ≤z ≤z0 and z0 < z ≤H. The zooplankton
migration between these layers is supposed to depend on food availability. Hence,
some part of zooplankton from the layer [z0, H] can satisfy its needs of food in the
layer [0, z0]. So, the whole vertical proﬁle B(φ, λ, z, t) is considered, having taken
into account Bmin.
The coefﬁcients Cas (a = p, Z) in the formulas (4.25) and (4.29) are determined
on the supposition that the consumption of various kinds of food in the s-th trophic
level is proportional to their efﬁcient biomasses:

Ta = taa is the expenditure on energy exchange, Ma = (μa + μa,1a)a is the mortality,
ρg is the indicator of the rate of replenishing the supplies of nutrient elements due to
decomposition of the dissolved organic matter, δ is the coefﬁcient of consumption
of nutrient elements in the process of photosynthesis.
As follows from Eqs. (4.32) and (4.33), a supposition that the elements of nekton
and detritus consumers do not move in space with the motion of the water masses is
made in the model. These elements are assumed to migrate independent of the
hydrophysical conditions of their environment. Let us consider two possible ver-
sions of modeling the processes of migration. The ﬁrst version is connected with an
addition to the right-hand parts of the Eqs. (4.32) and (4.33) of the terms describing
the turbulent mixing with the coefﬁcients k2
* > k2. In other words, the process of
migration is identiﬁed with the process of an intensiﬁed turbulent mixing, that
means it is accidental. However, the process of ﬁsh migration manifests some
expediency in the choice of the direction of their movement. According to the
biological principle of adaptation, the migration of ﬁsh is subject to the principle of
the complex maximization of the efﬁcient food ration, with the environmental
parameters remaining within the conditions of their habitat. Hence, the motion of
ﬁsh in space with characteristic velocities ensures their location in the regions
where at this time the food and other abiotic conditions (temperature, salinity,
dissolved oxygen, chemicals concentration) are most favourable. This means that
ﬁsh migrates in the direction of a maximum gradient of the efﬁcient food with the
preserved limitations of the environmental parameters.
4.6.3 The Vertical Structure of the Ocean
To qualitatively assess the role of the World Ocean ecosystems in the global carbon
cycle, it is useful to consider some aspects of the laws of formation of the vertical
distributions of organic matter. According to the Eq. (4.25), the number s of
maxima in its solution, p(φ, λ, z, t) at a ﬁxed time at any point (φ, λ) is determined
by the number l of changes of the sign of the derivative @p=@z, with s ≤0.5(1 + l).
It is important to know the location of the phytoplankton biomass maxima as a
function of the depth in order to understand the whole range of the biogeocenotic
processes in the ocean ecosystem. Of course, the amount and the location of the
4.6
Organic Carbon and Oceanic Ecosystems
289

p function maxima are determined by many characteristics of the water medium,
among which the hydrological heterogeneity between various layers of the water
space is one of the important ones. The results of numerous ﬁeld studies show that
there can be four maxima of phytoplankton and by the depth these maxima can
locate from the surface down to 500 m. Of course, in most cases there are one-two
maxima down to 50–100 m.
A theoretical analysis of the Eq. (4.25) is possible after its simpliﬁcation:
dp=dz ¼ F zð Þp  mN zð Þ  w zð Þ;
ð4:37Þ
where F, N, and w are the rate of photosynthesis, the zooplankton density, and the
rate of sedimentation, respectively, at a depth z. The concentration of nutrient
elements n(z) is supposed to be taken into account in the form of the function F(z).
The Eq. (4.37) is linearly related to p, and therefore it will not change if it is
multiplied on both sides by the value

The character of the p(z) distribution from the viewpoint of the number of
maxima and their location is important for the speciﬁcation of the role of various
depths in the functioning of the ocean carbonic system. So, it will be investigated
based on (4.41). For:
gðhÞ ¼

wðhÞ ¼

Thus, p(h) is the functional of g(h) and ψ(h). The g function has a simple
interpretation if h2 > h1, then the difference g(h2) −g(h1) represents the zooplankton
biomass located in the layer h1 ≤z ≤h2. The functions g(h) and ψ(h) are mono-
tonically non-decreasing, since T(h) and F(h) are not negative.
Before proceeding to a qualitative analysis of the function p(h), let us obtain
some auxiliary results. The following sets are introduced:

formulate the monotonicity properties of the function p(h). Since φ(h) does not

In the set X ¼ X

With an increasing depth in other stationary conditions the water temperature is
known to monotonically decrease, dropping sharply in the layer of the thermocline
(i.e., (@p=@z)τ ≤0). The similar term (@p=@z)M has the form of the sectionally
continuous non-positive function. However, due to the physical processes of
mixing a situation can appear when this monotonicity gets broken.
The values of the constituent (@p=@z)Z depend on the distribution of N(z).
The term (@p=@z)T is totally determined by the hydrological conditions through the

water thickness, and its behaviour can change arbitrarily. Apparently, in the layer
above the thermocline (@p=@z)O ≤0.
Studies of all components in totality will make it possible to determine the
number of changes of the sign of the derivative (@p=@z), which uniquely determines
the number of the phytoplankton maxima. In particular, if @p=@z changes the sign
seven times in the layer under study, and (@p=@z)z=0 > 0 and (@p=@z)z→∞< 0, then
the function p(z) has four maxima.
Finally, assuming that zooplankton uniformly eat out phytoplankton through the
depth of the layer considered, and neglecting in Eq. (4.43) all constituents apart
from the ﬁrst one, based on Eq. (4.41) we obtain the following expression for the

4.6.4 Model of the Peruvian Current Ecosystem
Each region of the World Ocean has characteristic hydrophysical and ecological
properties. Therefore, with these properties taken into account, a speciﬁcation of the
model of the carbon cycle in the World Ocean will raise the reliability of the model
assessment of the role of the ocean systems in the assimilation of excess CO2 from
the atmosphere. With this aim in view, let us consider the region of the Peruvian
Current characterized by high concentrations of nutrient elements (mkg-at/‘):
nitrites (0.6–0.8); nitrates (5.5–14.9); phosphates (0.6–1.31); silicic acids (3–45),
and large values of primary production (cal/m2/day): 17.9–69.3 for phytoplankton;
3.26 for bacteria; 0.12–0.73 for zooplankton, and 0.7–3 for nekton (mainly,
anchovy). Near the Peruvian coastline there is the most powerful on the Earth
upwelling of deep waters that feeds the photic layer of the bordering region of the
ocean with nutrient elements. Here the main object of the industrial ﬁshing is
294
4
Ecoinformatics Problems of the World Ocean

anchovy whose average production is estimated at 100 × 108 kg/year. From the
available data, anchovy constitutes above 95 % of the catch, and therefore the
derivation of the model of the functioning of the Peruvian ecosystem is also
important for the economy of the bordering states. Of course, the real limits of the
interaction of the natural-anthropogenic system of the concrete state of South
America with the global environment are impossible to assess without taking into
account the role of the ecosystem of the Peruvian Current.
The Peruvian Current refers to the regions of the World Ocean where compli-
cated interconnected and interdependent physical, biological, and chemical pro-
cesses take place on a relatively small area. Near the coastlines of Peru and Chili the
production of organic substance is so large that the available oxygen is not enough
for it to be oxidized, and as a result, a layer with an oxygen deﬁcit appears at depths
100–800 m. This is accompanied by underfeeding of fauna.
In the hierarchic structure of the trophic relationships of the Peruvian Current
community, the following components can be selected (Fig. 4.4): B1—bacterio-
plankton; B2—phytoplankton; B3—phytophag; B4—predatory zooplankton; B5—
industrial anchovy; B6—anchovy grubs; B7—predatory ﬁsh; B9—anchovy young-
sters; B10—detritus; B13—dissolved organic matter (cal/m3); B8—birds (birds/m2);
B12—biogenic elements (mg/m3); B14—dissolved oxygen (m‘/‘); B11—volume of
anchovy catch (t/km2). The characteristic feature of the trophic graph of the system
is the availability of connections between the components of the ocean biocenoses
(B5, B7, B9) and the land biocenoses (B8). An introduction of this connection into
the model has turned out to be essential, since the maritime birds (cormorants,
pelicans, etc.) in the regions of the Peruvian current markedly affect the dynamics of
the whole system. From the available estimates, anchovy constitutes from 80 to
96 % of the food spectrum for birds. Therefore the characteristic feature of the
developed model is an account of the element of interaction of the land and ocean
Fig. 4.4 The block-scheme of the Peruvian Current ecosystem model (PCEM)
4.6
Organic Carbon and Oceanic Ecosystems
295

biocenoses expressed by the introduction of trophic bonds between birds and
anchovy. The trophic pressure on anchovy from other ﬁsh is expressed by a single
connection with the component B7—which is mainly Chili pelamyd (Sarda chili-
ensis), though anchovy is in the food spectrum for other animals, too.
The block-scheme of the PCEM reﬂects the elements of the atmosphere-ocean
interaction reduced to a mutual exchange with oxygen, with the given rates of
invasion and evasion.
The whole system receives the solar radiation energy E whose intensity is
estimated by the formula (4.18) at α = 0.013, δ = β = ν = 5 × 10−5. A change of the
biomass of the i-th component (i = 1–7, 9) is described by the balance equation

The block of climatic and anthropogenic impacts on the PCE is described
according to the procedure of GIMS. It was assumed that the scope of pollution of the
PCE area is determined by the mean pollution level of the Paciﬁc and is qualitatively
characterized by the quantity 0.13 ≤θ ≤0.27 mg/m2 of conventional pollutant.
Temperature variations were incorporated into the model by using a database in
the form of the charts of its distribution in space and allowing for seasonal variations
according to the diagram in Fig. 4.5. In this case, the discretization of data in time
and space agrees with discretization steps adopted in the computer realization of the
PCEM as the GIMS item. Temperature anomalies that take place in the area of the
PCE are known as El Niño years by the magnitude of quantity 4 ≤Δσε ≤6 K. We
would like to note that a more accurate simulation of El Niño is an independent task.
The temperature regime of the PCE is affected by strong variations in solar
radiation which are due to varying cloudiness near the coasts and in the open ocean.
In the narrow off-shore zone, where cloudiness is practically non-existent, radiation
is 1.5 times as high as in the adjoining ocean areas and attains magnitudes of the
order of E(φ, λ, 0, t) = 2.64 W/m2. The mean energy of solar radiation is 1.85 W/m2.

isothermal layer varies, on the average, within a wide range from 10 m at the South
America’s coast to 130 m in the west part of the region. The position of thermocline
is determined by the separation boundary between surface and sub-surface waters.

where H0 and H1 are the occurrence depths of thermocline near the shore and in the
open ocean, respectively; δ is the distance of the strip of maximum thermocline
depth from the shore that is described by function G(λ) (Fig. 4.6).
The dynamics of biogeocenotic processes in the PCE is largely dependent on the
variable structure of currents. It is assumed that Vφ = |V|cosα, Vλ = |V|sinα with angle α
showing the direction of the current at each point of the plane (φ, λ) at depth z.
The mathematical description of ﬁsh migrations is proved to be the most com-
plex element in the construction of the PCEM. Lyapunov (1971) proposed that
the migration process should be identiﬁed with the intense turbulent diffusion with
the coefﬁcient |ν*| >> |ν|. Krapivin (1978) realized this algorithm and has shown that
the estimation of ν* to be a very incorrect task. The investigations by Radakov
(1972) revealed that the process of ﬁsh migration is accompanied by an external
appearance of purposeful behavior. Therefore, the law of migration which follows
from the general biological principle of adaptation and long-term adaptability is
formulated: migrations of anchovy, predatory ﬁshes and birds are subordinated to
the principle of complex maximization of effective nutritive ration Pi (i = 5, 7, 8, 9),

given the preservation of favourable temperature conditions. In other words, trav-
eling of migrating species takes place at velocities characteristic for them in the
direction of the maximum gradient of effective food, given the adherence to tem-
perature restrictions.
The PCEM makes it possible to carry out computer experiments for an esti-
mation of the PCE response to anthropogenic impacts on the exterior conditions or
to climate change. The initial data and model coefﬁcients are given in Table 4.4. For
the young and commercial anchovy the temperatures σ ≤289 K and for predatory
ﬁshes σ ≥288 K were deemed to be acceptable. The rate of ﬁsh migration was
determined by the value of 0.03 m/s, and for birds 0.14 m/s. The thermocline
position was described by the binary function (4.49) with δ = δs in spring, summer

(Krapivin 1996).
Seasonal and latitudinal temperature variations are known to occur in the PCE
area. The natural cycles of such variations have been incorporated in the model by
consulting the available real data and it appears interesting to consider herein the
departures of temperature from these model values. Figure 4.7 shows the biomass
of the anchovy and predatory ﬁshes versus temperature ﬂuctuations. As seen from
Fig. 4.7, if the system is functioning under normal temperature conditions, a clear-
cut division between the habitation areas of the anchovy and predatory ﬁshes is
observed. In this case, the maximum concentration of the anchovy biomass is
observed to occur in the offshore zone about 1.5°–2° wide in longitude, whereas the
biomass of predatory ﬁshes attains its maximum concentration in the open ocean.
This pattern is observed throughout the area and appears to be stable 30–40 days
later for the model distributions of temperature. This pattern falls apart as soon as
the overall temperature background is subject to change. A reduction in the general
temperature level by 1 K accounts for the fact that the habitation areas of anchovy
and predatory ﬁshes increasingly intersect. Moreover, in this case their total bio-
mass rises by about 10 %. In the El Niño periods the effect of diffusion of the
ecosystem into the offshore and open-ocean parts disappears completely, being

accompanied by a decline in the total biomass of anchovy and predatory ﬁshes.
These effects were observed by Marti (1971) and Parin (1971).
To estimate the survivability of the PCE, Krapivin (1996) has introduced the
survivability function:

Figure 4.8 shows the survivability function (4.50) for various departures of
temperature from its model value. We will consider the system to be in a living state
if the condition J(t) > κ J(t0) is carried out for t ≥t0, where κ < 1 is the level of
survivability. It is obvious that temperature ﬂuctuations by ±7 K bring the system to
a ‘dead state’ after 70 days for +7 K and after 190 days for −7 K. Water temperature
ﬂuctuations within ±5 K turn out to be non-dangerous to the system, but they may
be the cause of its conversion into a different quasi-stationary state. This follows
from the comparison of the phase patterns of behaviour of the system trajectories
similar to these given in Fig. 4.9 where the PCE dynamics in the plane of B5 × B7 is
given under different initial states.
It is supposed that ﬂuctuations of solar radiation energy cause proportional vari-
ations of the water temperature. A climate block of GIMS is used for the calculation of
atmospheric temperature σA in Ω. A temperature regime of PCE is described by the
Fig. 4.8 The estimation of

model of Vinogradov et al. (1975), Vinogradov (1975). Additional conditions are
also taken into account as follows. Suppose that the difference Δσ(φ, λ, z, t) between
the water temperature above the thermocline (z < H) and σA linearly increases with
higher latitudes. This difference is Δσ(0, λ, z, t) = 0 and Δσ(30°S, λ, z, t) ≤0.2σA. Δσ is
independent of longitude. The difference between the water temperature under the
thermocline (z > H) and the atmospheric temperature is independent of geographical
coordinates. Changes in the depth of the thermocline due to light ﬂuctuations should
be neglected. Then we shall use the parameter R as a free parameter to assign light
ﬂuctuations.
Figures 4.10 and 4.11 give instances of the calculations of the vertical structure
of the PCE and J(t) for variations of light at the surface. These results point to the
presence of a regularity observable throughout the area and are indicative of the
increase of E(φ, λ, 0, t). If, in general, in the case of the biosphere a 2 % reduction in
E(φ, λ, 0, t) is likely to result in glaciations. In the case of the PCE, ﬂuctuations of
E(φ, λ, 0, t) within −60 % to +700 % (Fig. 4.11) are safe for this system. This effect
has a local character when the safe level is deﬁned by the condition J(t) ≥0.5. This
condition corresponds to the situation when the system loses more that 70 % of
biomass. The integral result from such effects can be understood only in the
framework of GIMS.
The function E(φ, λ, 0, t) in Eq. (4.48) depends on the state of the atmosphere.
The simulation experiments show that the PCE survivability permissible reductions
of the atmosphere transparency must not be more than 2.5 times. Above this
threshold the system is bound to perish.
The role of oxygen is taken into account by the model in terms of production,
mortality rates and spending on energy exchange within the environment. Simula-
tion experiments point to great inhomogeneities of the saturation of waters with

oxygen both in horizontal sections and in depth. At the places of oxygen deﬁcit
(<6 mg/m3) a drastic reduction in the biomass of the higher trophic levels is
observed, but no stable pattern is noted either with respect to the waters little sat-
urated or those oversaturated. Accordingly, for the region as a whole these zones are
observed to be travelling apparently due to hydrodynamic processes on a non-stable
pattern without causing any perceptible damage to the entire community.

Fluctuations in the saturation of waters with oxygen may have an anthropogenic
origin, for instance, they may be due to oil pollutions or to large discharges of
sewage waters. The PCEM permits us to set some hypothetic experiments,
some instances of which are given in Figs. 4.12 and 4.13. It is noticeable that the
model displays a high degree of stability with respect to the initial saturation of
water with oxygen and from the behavior of J(t) we see how rapidly the PCE
proceeds to the quasi-stationary regime of functioning at B14(φ, λ, z, t0) ≥60 mg/m3

and how long it takes to overcome the initial shortage of oxygen in the case of
B14(φ, λ, z, t0) = 16 mg/m3. For B14(φ, λ, z, t0) < 16 mg/m3 the PCE is unable to
proceed to the stationary regime of functioning.
The PCEM is observed to be even more sensitive to a dynamic effect on the
process of water saturation with oxygen. This clearly follows from the behaviour of J
(t) in Fig. 4.13. A reduction of the oxygen production by 10 % does not inﬂuence the
PCE dynamics. A subsequent decrease of δ14 in Eq. (4.47) leads up to the dis-
placement in the stable state of the PCE. The PCE does not survive when the
parameter δ14 is decreased by 22 %. Figure 4.11 illustrates the important qualitative
result when Eq. (4.50) gives a possibility for the search of the dangerous zones in Ω.
Table 4.5 gives the results obtained in computing the PCE dynamics in the case
of a variation of the concentration of nutrients at the initial moment of time t0 and at
the depth z > 150 m. From the comparison of the results contained herein it follows
that a variation of the nutrient concentration within a wide range at the moment
t = t0 does not practically affect the behaviour of the system at the moments t >> t0.
The system ‘health’ with time from the ‘blows’ it has suffered and proceeds to the
same functioning level.
It is different when at depths z > 150 m B12 becomes close or inferior to a certain
value B12,min. In this case, the system is unable to make up for the introduced
ﬂuctuations and at B12 >> 0.1 mg/m3 the system begins to experience the effect of
strong limitation throughout the area. Such a reduction in the nutrient concentration
is, for instance, possible in the case of contamination of bottom sediments with oil
products.
The effect of variations in the velocity of vertical advection plays an important
role in the PCE evolution. To estimate turbulent escape of nutrients into layers
overlying the thermocline, it is assumed that the velocity of water uprise is equal to
10–3 cm/s in the PCEM. The obtained data point to the fact that, on the average, the
integrated pattern of the distribution of community elements is not subject to any
signiﬁcant variations within the velocity range from 3 × 10−4 to 10−2 and even
10−1 cm/s, but is observed that it is drastically distorted under a higher. Slow water
lifting (<10−4 cm/s) results the ecosystem extinction.
The simulation experiments enable us to answer the question about securing an
increase in the productivity of the PCE through the creation of artiﬁcial upwellings.
For the PCE this can be achieved within up to 40 %. In the open ocean the higher
velocity of vertical advection improves, on the one hand, nutrients supply for surface-
adjoining waters and, on the other it brings down the water temperature, thereby
drastically restricting the productivity of the system. Moreover, on account of the
lengthy trophic chain in the open ocean, the ultimate effect of increased nutrients
saturation proves to be insigniﬁcant. In the shelf zone the nutrients limitation is absent.
In terms of the GIMS, the PCEM can be considered as one step to the hierar-
chical biosphere model. The PCEM proposed herein is based on the experience of
preceding investigations. The choice of the composition of the system mainly
reﬂects the concepts of the trophic and physiochemical nature of links between the
components of the PCE, as are maintained by marine ecologists. In contrast to the
earlier proposed models of marine and oceanic ecosystems, the PCEM is
4.6
Organic Carbon and Oceanic Ecosystems

characterized by a wider coverage of processes taking place in the system. It allows
for their variations in time and space.
The structure of the PCEM software provides an opportunity for an early cor-
rection of functional dependencies in the model equations, for introducing and
exclusion of components, reorientation of trophic graph and introduction of other
hypothetic situations.
A further improvement of the PCEM involves consideration of new data on
ecosystem elements and processes taking place in the system, allowance for water
heterogeneity and salinity and speciﬁcation of the trophic graph on its higher levels.

Ecoinformatics Problems of the World Ocean

The model of El Niño should be developed in the form of an additional block.
Progress towards a more detailed parameterization of the PCE depends on the
database development and the use of satellite observations.
4.6.5 Model of the Upwelling Ecosystem
The zones of the deep waters lifting in the World Ocean called upwellings are
known to exhibit a high productivity. An upwelling results from the surface waters
wind-driven from the shore, dispersing currents, or water retreat from the shore for
other reasons. The rates of water lifting and the upwelling stability are determined
by several synoptic parameters. A most characteristic value of the vertical velocity
of water lifting in the zone of upwelling is 0.77 × 10−3 m/s. The depths from which
the water starts lifting vary widely, but the depths around 200 m prevail.
High oceanic productivity occurs in areas of upwelling in the ocean, particularly
along continental shelves (red areas on map in Fig. 4.14). The coastal upwelling in
these regions is the result of deep oceanic currents (Fig. 4.15) colliding with sharp
coastal shelves, forcing nutrient-rich cool water to the surface. Over 90 % of the
world’s living biomass is contained in the oceans, yet only about 0.2 % of marine
production is harvested. High oceanic productivity occurs in areas of upwelling in
the ocean, particularly along continental shelves (red areas on map). The coastal
upwelling in these regions is the result of deep oceanic currents colliding with sharp
coastal shelves, forcing nutrient-rich cool water to the surface. Over 90 % of the
world’s living biomass is contained in the oceans, yet only about 0.2 % of marine

production is harvested. The Peruvian upwelling is a 300 × 300 mile area adjacent
to the coast and is the most biologically productive coastal upwelling system on
Earth. Carbon levels (an indicator of production) are tens of times higher than those
of the next most productive upwelling region, the California current.
High productivity is observed in ecosystems located in zones of coral reefs
(Fig. 4.16). Coral reef ecosystems contain distinct zones that represent different kinds
of habitats. Usually, three major zones are recognized: the fore reef, reef crest, and
the back reef (frequently referred to as the reef lagoon). All three zones are physically
and ecologically interconnected. Reef life and oceanic processes create opportunities
for exchange of seawater, sediments, nutrients, and marine life among one another.
Let us consider the ocean ecosystem in the zone of upwelling proceeding from
the concept of the successive development of community from the moment of its
formation in the region of the deep waters lifting to the climax state in the oligo-
trophic region of convergence, and derive a model of the upwelling ecosystem

(MUE). Between these moments the system developed in time and, respectively,
moves together with the water ﬂow. In this case, changes take place both in the total
energy supply in the community and in its structure (spatial, trophic, speciﬁc). The
basic moments of these changes have been generally studied in numerous ﬁeld
investigations. Therefore, the correspondence of the model calculations to these
ideas can be one of the criteria of the model adequacy.
Supposing that the ecosystem develops uniformly horizontally from the zone of
upwelling, changes are observed both through the depth z with a step Δz = 10 м and in
time with a step Δt = 1 day. The horizontal velocity of water ﬂow from the zone of
upwelling is assumed to be constant and equal to V = Vφ = Vλ, so that the distance of a
unit volume of water from the zone of upwelling is equal to Δr = (Δφ2 + Δλ2) = VΔt.
The state of the ecosystem on each horizon z = const is determined by illumination
E(z, t), concentration of nutrient elements n(z,t) and detritus d(z, t), biomass of phy-
toplankton, p(z, t), bacteria b(z, t), protozoa Z1(z, t), microzooplankton Z2(z, t), small
ﬁltraters Z3(z, t), large ﬁltraters Z4(z, t), small predatory cyclopoids Z5(z, t), predatory
calanoids Z6(z, t), large predatory chaetognaths and polychaete Z7(z, t). Protozoa
include infusorian and radiolarian, microzooplankton includes naupliuses of all
copepod. Based on studies of the food for tropical plankton animals, small ﬁltraters
(<1 mm in size) are plankton animals such as Oikopleura, copepods Clausocalanus,
Paracalanus, Acartia, Lucicutia, small ostracode Conchoecia. Large ﬁltraters
include copepod larger than 1 mm, such as Undinula, Pleuromamma, Centropages,
Temora, Scolecythrix, and others, baby euphasiids, pteropod, etc. In the trophic
pyramid the impact of nekton elements is considered negligibly small. The food
bonds between the enumerated elements are shown in the scheme in Fig. 4.17.
It is assumed that 30 % of the mass of bacteria is in natural aggregates >3–5 μm in
size, which can be eaten and assimilated by ﬁltraters (Z3, Z4); nauplii (Z2), protozoa
(Z1), and small ﬁltraters (Z3) can also feed on non-aggregated bacterioplankton.
The trophic bonds between the elements are described based on the energy
principle. Biomass, rates of producing and exchange, and rations are expressed in
energy units (cal/m3 or cal/m2).
Like in the general model of the ocean ecosystem, the original source of energy
and substance in the community is the primary production of phytoplankton (Rp).
The solar radiation energy (E) and nutrient elements (n) come from outside. The
vertical structure of the water medium is described by a 3-layer model with one
layer above the thermocline, one layer of sharp gradient, and one layer of lower
gradients beneath the thermocline. The upper (zb) and lower (zl) boundaries of the
layer with sharp gradients are assumed to be located (depth in metres):

Thus, the thermocline at an initial time moment t = 0 is located in the layer 10–30 m,
descending gradually down to 120–150 m on the 50th day and to 150–190 m on the
100th day.
The supply of nutrient elements in the layer 0–200 m is replenished at the
expense of detritus decomposition and emission of unassimilated food by living
elements of the community, as well as at the expense of the input from deep layers
(z > 200 m) due to turbulent mixing (coefﬁcient k2) and vertical advection (velocity
VZ). The content of nutrients in organic matter is constant and constitutes 10 %.

To calculate the ration for the elements of zooplankton by the formula (4.28), the
coefﬁcient ν is determined from the condition ν = 0.01/Bmin. When calculating the
coefﬁcients Cij, it is assumed that the food needs refer to various food objects in
proportion to their biomasses taking into account food selectivity. The coefﬁcients
Cij for all elements of the ecosystem are given in Fig. 4.18.
The daily migrations of zooplankton are simulated by an addition to the daily
ration of the elements Zj (j = 4–7), located in the layer 0–50 m, of some share (kZ) of
total food needs of the same elements of the community but in the layer 50–200 m.

Various scenarios both of migration and nutrition of the elements of zooplankton

ecosystem during 50–70 days arrives at stationary regime. It means that the eco-
system of the upwelling zone ‘forgets’ these ﬂuctuations in initial concentrations.

It is supposed that water covers the distance from the upwelling zone to the
oligotrophy zone in more that 60 days. Figure 4.21 characterizes this evolution
process. It is seen that biomasses of phytoplankton and bacterioplankton reach
maximal levels at 5–10 and 10–15 days, respectively. Small ﬁltraters are slow in
their evolution, but large ﬁltrators are evolved more slowly. Biomass of large
ﬁltrators reaches maximal level only in the 30 day. Existing feedbacks control the
evolution processes for all living ecosystem elements and their biomasses slowly
decrease as a system is moving from the upwelling zone. Flows of nutrient salts that
lift from deep waters through thermocline and vertical turbulence play main role in
this evolution. Ecosystem results quasi-stationary level at 50–60 days characterized
low biomasses of all living elements. Under this situation, stable balance is
achieved between photosynthesis intensity and nutrient salts inﬂow from deep
layers.
Numerous experimental observations for the ecosystems of the upwelling zones
have veriﬁed these model results concerning a dissociation of maximal biomasses
of living elements during ecosystem evolution. Table 4.6 characterizes the precision
of the modeling results. Bacterioplankton biomass proves to be larger in real data. It
is evident that this follows from the failure to take account of allochtonous organic
matter as element of the bacterioplankton food. In general, modeling and obser-
vational results are similar. This conclusion is conﬁrmed by results represented in
Fig. 4.22 where the vertical structure of the ecosystem is given. One can see that
phytoplankton biomass is uniformly big during the ﬁrst 5 days in the layer 0–50 m.

All of the other living elements have more or less sharply deﬁned and enough
narrow maximum by the depth. However, reserve of nutrient salts is almost fully
used up in upper layer during 10 days, but nevertheless maximum of phytoplankton
biomass is kept at the depth of 10–20 m. Two-maxima structure is formed
beginning from 20–30 days of the system evolution when nutrient salts enter across
thermocline to upper water layers. In this case, the thermocline depth is 55–75 m.
Fig. 4.22 Dynamics of vertical structure of the upwelling ecosystem elements

Vertical transport of nutrient salts from under thermocline begins to play a
signiﬁcant role when biogenic level of upper layers is depleted. Hence, lower
maximum of phytoplankton biomass becomes bigger of upper maximum. Later on
under the thermocline deepening for 80–100 m and more, illumination of its upper
boundary is insufﬁcient for intensive evolution of the phytoplankton what leads to
the separation of lower maximum from the thermocline. Such effect was observed
by Vinogradov et al. (1970) in a pelagic community of the tropical ocean. Complete
disappearance of lower maximum is observed after 50–60 days for the oligotrophy
and ultra-oligotrophy regions.
It is important to assess a sensitivity of upwelling ecosystem to the variations of
environmental parameters and to understand when it is stable. The system is stable
during time T if biomasses of its elements are varied in ‘physiologically acceptable
limits’. Tables 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 and 4.10 give some assessments of the model sensitivity
to the variations of its parameters.
As it is seen from Table 4.7, variations on the food assimilation coefﬁcient by
±20 % lead to the growth of mean-square deviation of the model trajectory by no
more than 4 % for Z3 + Z4 and by 70 % for Z2. Microzooplankton and ﬁltraters are
more sensitive to the variations of the energetic exchange coefﬁcient (T) and
undigested food coefﬁcient (H) than predators. The results of Table 4.10 show that
repetitive change of initial biomasses of predators is displayed during no more than
20–30 days. After that, ecosystem approaches the stable regime of its evolution.
As it follows from Fig. 4.23 the evolution of the ecosystem depends consider-
ably on the solar radiation. An increase in surface illuminance leads to the insig-
niﬁcant deepening of lower maximum and to more consumption of nutrient salts
above thermocline that causes the phytoplankton depression in the surface layer.
Daily illumination equaled 2,000 kcal/m2 is followed by maximal photosynthesis in

under sufﬁcient concentration of nutrient salts inﬂuence the vertical structure of the
ecosystem elements with the same forms.
The effects of the nutrient salt concentrations at the initial time of the upwelling
ecosystem formation are shown in Table 4.11. Variations of nutrient salts from 100
to 400 mg/m3 and more, practically are displayed only in the beginning of the
ecosystem evolution. The MUE gives a possibility to study different hypothetical
scenarios taking into consideration many situations. For example, Fig. 4.24 char-
acterizes the ecosystem dynamics for absence of predatory elements. In this case,

upwelling ecosystem does not achieve the stability and this means that predatory
elements are the regulating factor.
Ratio of phytoplankton production to its biomass (p/b—coefﬁcient) is, generally,
one of the important characteristics of oceanic ecosystem and it deﬁnes the eco-
system stability character. For example, Fig. 4.25 shows that upwelling ecosystem
evolution for its p/b—coefﬁcient always equals to 3. In fact, p/b—coefﬁcient
changes depends on the time, beginning from 15 in upwelling zone and ﬁnishing by
1 in the oligotrophy zone (Vinogradov et al. (1970, 1975).

Simulation experiments analogous to these given above, help to assess the
ecosystem characteristics, the measurement of which in real conditions is impos-
sible or inaccurate. One of such characteristic is the vertical water lifting velocity
Vz, the existing evaluations of which vary in a range from 10−4 to 0.1 cm/s. The
MUE experiments show that when Vz < 10−4 cm/s upwelling ecosystem evolves
during no more than several days, but when Vz > 10−1 cm/s it rapidly collapses
without stable state.
4.7 Biocomplexity Indicator as a Predictor
of the Ecosystem State
The ecosystem complexity is formed in transition of its relations with environment.
Almost every ecological system is complex. Classical examples of complex eco-
system include the behaviour of upwelling ecosystems discussed above. For
instance, tropical cyclones bringing heavy destructions on the land generate the
zones of upwelling in the ocean and create conditions for high productivity of
phytoplankton due to the lifting of biogenic elements from depths to surface waters.
As a result, the trophic pyramid of the zone of the tropical cyclone’s impact
becomes complex leading to the growth of biocomplexity of the ecosystem of this
zone. In general, humans inﬂuence on oceanic ecosystems is growing and as a
result, it is necessary to search the indicators for the control of oceanic ecosystem
productivity and survivability. Biocomplexity is one of such indicators that help to
resolve much of the controversy about the impact that humans are having on health
and stability of oceanic ecosystems relative to the effects of natural changes in the
ocean. Biocomplexity indicator can help to investigate any environmental system
taking into consideration the existing nonlinearities and feedback processes
(Krapivin 2008a).
According to Szathmáry and Griesemer (2003), the ratio between living and
non-living substances determines the vitality of the natural system and answers the
question whether it is alive. The natural system accomplishes the transition between
its extreme states due to its changing complexity, whose indicator can serve a
forerunner of a critical state. In particular, such transitions can be caused by climate
change. The successful search of such indicators depends on our knowledge of the
laws of the living world and its evolution. The basic concepts of ecology developed
by Beeby and Brennan (2003) suggest the conclusion that living systems of any
level respond to an approaching natural catastrophe.
The problem of the interaction of various elements and processes in the global
nature-society system (NSS)
in common, and in the ocean-atmosphere system
(OAS) in particular, has recently attracted the attention of many scientists. Attempts
to assess and forecast the dynamics of this interaction have been made in different
scientiﬁc directions. One of these attempts is the Biocomplexity Program set up in
the U.S.A. by the National Science Foundation, which plans to study and
4.6

understand relationships between the dynamics of complexity of biological,
physical, and social systems and trends in changes of the present habitat. Within the
framework of this program, the complexity of the system interacting with the
environment is connected with phenomena appearing in case of the contact of a
living system with the environment on a global scale.
Biocomplexity is a derivative of biological, physical, chemical, social and
behavioural interactions of the environmental subsystems, including living organisms
and global population. As a matter of fact, the notion of biocomplexity is closely
connected with the laws of biospheric functioning as a unity of the forming ecosys-
tems and natural-economic systems of various scales, from local to global. Therefore,
a combined formalized description of biological, geochemical, geophysical, and
anthropogenic factors and processes taking place at a given level of the spatial-
temporal hierarchy of scales is needed in order to deﬁne biocomplexity and assess it.
Manifestation of biocomplexity is a characteristic indicator of all systems of the
environment connected with life. The elements of this manifestation are studied
within the theory of stability and survivability of ecosystems. It should be noted that
the formation of biocomplexity includes indicators of the degree of mutual modi-
ﬁcation of the interacting systems, and it means that biocomplexity should be
studied with due regard to both spatial and biological levels of organization. The
difﬁculty lies in the complicated behaviour of the object under study, especially if
the human factor is considered as a result of which the number of stress situations in
the environment is constantly growing.
Humankind has accumulated knowledge about the environmental systems. The
use of this knowledge to study biocomplexity is possible within the framework of
synthesizing a global model that reﬂects the laws of interactions between envi-
ronmental elements and permits assessing just how efﬁcient it is at constructing
different scenarios in the development of human society, based on the actual data of
ground and satellite measurements. Consequently, this problem serves the basis of
all questions set forth by the Biocomplexity Program.
Studies of the interaction process are aimed—as a rule—at understanding and
assessing the consequences of a given interaction. The reliability and accuracy of
such assessments depend on criteria taken as the basis in conclusions, examination,
and recommendations. At present, there is no agreement on what technique to
choose such criteria for lack of a single scientiﬁcally substantiated approach to the
ecological criteria of economic impacts on the environment. The accuracy of the
ecological examination of the existing and planned production systems as well as
the representativeness of the data of global geoinformation monitoring depends on
the choice of such criteria.
Processes taking place in the environment can be represented as a totality of
interactions between its subsystems. Since a human is one of its elements, it is
impossible, for example, to simply divide the environment into interacting bio-
sphere and society: everything on Earth is correlated. The problem is to ﬁnd
mechanisms to describe relevant correlations and interdependences which would
reliably reﬂect the environmental dynamics and answer the questions formulated in
“Biocomplexity” programme:
326
4
Ecoinformatics Problems of the World Ocean

1. How does the complexity of biological, physical, and social systems in the
environment occur and change?
2. What are the mechanisms for spontaneous development of many events in the
environment?
3. How do the environmental systems with the living components including those
created by man respond and adapt themselves to stress situations?
4. How do information, energy and matter move within the environmental systems
and through their levels of organization?
5. Is it possible to forecast the adaptability of the system and to give prognostic
estimates of its changes?
6. How does humankind affect and respond to biocomplexity in natural systems?
Many other, also important and signiﬁcant questions can be added to this enu-
meration. For instance, up to what level of complexity should space-borne obser-
vation systems be improved so that their information to be of a sufﬁciently high
standard to reliably estimate the state of the environment, even only at the moment
of receiving this information? The question of an optimal location of the geoin-
formation monitoring means at different levels of its established organization is also
important. It is also crucial to understand, which forerunners of natural disasters can
be measured using the existing space-borne systems?
Environmental biocomplexity is, to some extent, an indicator of interaction
between its systems. In this way, one can introduce the unit Ξ of biocomplexity
varying with conditions when all interactions in the environment are reduced to the
level corresponding to the natural process of evolution. Thus, we obtain an integral
indicator of the environmental state, on the whole, with bioavailability, biodiversity
and survivability taken into account. This indicator characterizes all kinds of
interaction of the environmental components. So, for instance, in biological inter-
actions connected with relations of the type “predator-prey” or “competition for
energy resource”, there is some minimal level of available food when it becomes
practically inaccessible, and the consumer-producer interaction stops. The chemical
and physical processes of interaction of environmental elements also depend on the
sets of certain critical parameters.
All this emphasizes that biocomplexity refers to categories difﬁcult to measure
and express quantitatively. However, we shall try to give formalized quantitative
evaluations. Proceeding to quantitative numerical scale Ξ, we postulate that there
are relations of the type Ξ1 < Ξ2, Ξ1 > Ξ2 or Ξ1 ≡Ξ2. In other words, there is always
a value of this scale ρ, which determines the level of biocomplexity Ξ →ρ = f(Ξ),
where f is a transformation of the notion of biocomplexity into a number.
Let us try to ﬁnd a satisfactory model which will transform the verbal deﬁnition
of biocomplexity into notions and features that can be formalized and converted.
With this aim in view, we select in NSS or OAS m elements—subsystems of the
lowest level, whose interaction is determined by binary matrix function A ¼
aij

 ,
where aij = 0 if elements i and j do not interact; aij ≠0 if elements i and j interact.
4.7
Biocomplexity Indicator as a Predictor of the Ecosystem State
327

aij can be interpreted as a level of interaction of elements i and j. Then, any point ξ
∈Ξ is determined as the sum
n ¼
X
m
i¼1
ki
X
n
j¼1
bjaij
where weight coefﬁcients ki (i = 1,…, m) and βj (j = 1,…, n) determine the meaning
of appropriate elements from interacting systems. Nature of these elements depends
on their role within the systems.
It is clear that ξ = ξ(φ, λ, t) where φ and λ are geographic latitude and longitude,
respectively, t is the current time. For some territory Ω the indicator of biocom-
plexity is determined as an average value:
nXðtÞ ¼ 1=r
ð
Þ
Z
u;k
ð
Þ2 X
n u; k; t
ð
Þdudk;
ð4:51Þ
where σ is the area of the territory Ω.
Thus, the indicator ξΩ(t) plays the role of the integral index of NSS complexity,
reﬂecting the individuality of its structure and behaviour at each time moment t in a
space Ω. In accordance with the laws of natural evolution, a decrease (increase) of
the parameter ξΩ will follow an increase (reduction) of biodiversity and ability of
natural-anthropogenic systems to survive. Since a decrease of biodiversity breaks
the completeness of biogeochemical cycles and leads to an increase of load on
irreversible resources, the binary structure of the matrix A favors resource-depleting
technologies, and the vector of energy exchange between NSS subsystems shifts to
the state when the level of its survivability lowers.
The NSS consists of elements-subsystems Bi (i = 1,…, m), whose interaction is
formed in time depending on many factors. The NSS biocomplexity is the sum of
structural and dynamic complexities of its elements. In other words, the NSS
biocomplexity is formed in the process of interaction of its parts {Bi}. In due
course, the subsystems Bi can change their state and, consequently, the topology of
their bonds. The evolutionary mechanism for adapting the subsystems Bi to the
environment suggests the hypothesis that each subsystem Bi, independent of its
structure, possesses the structure Bi,S, behavior Bi,B and goal Bi,G. Thus, Bi = {Bi,S,
Bi,B, Bi,G}. The goal Bi,G of the subsystem Bi is to achieve a certain preferable state.
The expedience of the structure Bi,S and the purposefulness of behaviour Bi,B of the
subsystem Bi is estimated by the efﬁciency of reaching the goal Bi,G.
This can be exempliﬁed by the process of migration of nekton elements. Fish
migrates towards a maximum gradient of nutritional ration with due regard to
possible limitations of the water medium parameters (temperature, salinity, oxygen
concentration, pollution, etc.). Hence, the goal Bi,G of the elements of nekton is to
enlarge their ration, and their behaviour Bi,B consists in calculation of the trajectory
of shifting in the process of formation of shoals, which can be presented in terms of
Bi,S for each kind of the nekton elements.

Ecoinformatics Problems of the World Ocean

Since the interaction of subsystems {Bi} is connected with chemical and energy
cycles, it is natural to suppose that each subsystem Bi organizes the geochemical
and geophysical transformations of matter and energy in order to preserve its
stability. The formalized approach to this process rests on the supposition that in the
NSS structure an exchange takes place between subsystems Bi of some amount V of
spent resources for some amount W of consumed resources ((V,W)-exchange).
Natural disasters prevent a group of subsystems Bi of a certain region from
accomplishing a proﬁtable (V,W)-exchange during some time. In a general case,
W = W(V,Bi,{Bk, k∈K}), where K is a multitude of the numbers of subsystems
contacting with the subsystem Bi. Denoting that BK = {Bk, k∈K}, the interaction of
the subsystem Bi with its environment BK will result in the following (V,W)-
exchanges:
Wi;0 ¼ max
Bi min
BK WiðVi; Bi; BKÞ ¼ WiðVi; Bi;opt; BK;optÞ;
WK;0 ¼ max
BK min
Bi WKðVK; Bi; BKÞ ¼ WKðVK; Bi;opt; BK;optÞ:
Hence, when determining the levels Vi and VK, the goal of the subsystem Bi
becomes slightly vague. Since there are limiting factors in nature, in this case it is
natural to assume the presence of some threshold Vi,min, at the reaching of which the
energy resource of the subsystem stops being spent on getting an external resource.
This means that at Vi ≤Vi,min the subsystem Bi moves on to the regime of regen-
eration of the internal resource. In other words, at Vi ≤Vi,min the biocomplexity
indicator ξΩ(t) decreases due to broken connections of the subsystem Bi with other
subsystems. In a general case, Vmin is the structural step function, so the transition
aij from the state aij ≠0 to the state aij = 0 does not take place for all j simulta-
neously. In other cases the interaction of subsystems {Bi} can stop depending on
various combinations of their parameters. The formalized description of possible
situations of the interaction of subsystems {Bi} can be carried out using a simu-
lation model of NSS functioning.
The study of the structure and functioning of the ocean’s ecosystems becomes
one of the most important and rapidly developing directions of marine biology. Its
various aspects are being developed in many countries within the International
Biological Program (IBP) (Mourant 1964). One of the goals of this study is to
obtain a possibility to forecast the system’s behavior as a result of changing some of
its parameters. However, due to uniqueness and great spatial extent of the World
Ocean’s ecosystems, it is difﬁcult to quantitatively evaluate all the elements of the
system at different moments of its development and in different regions of the
ocean, and the more so, to assess the impact of their change on the functioning of
the system, on the whole. Therefore, the use of a model approach is one of the ways
to solve these problems.

4.8 Oil and Gas Extraction in Seas
The gas extraction zone according to the GIMS technology should have a structure
with subsystems enumerated in Table 4.12. The design of the gas extraction zone is
connected with the interpretation and detailing of the structural and functional
properties of these subsystems. The experience of such investigations shows that
the ﬁrst stage demands the solution of the following tasks in order to design the
system of environmental monitoring:
• an elaboration of a science-based and economically covered criterion to assess
the atmosphere and water environment state in the area of the gas extraction
zone inﬂuence;
• an analysis of the hydrophysical structures and aquatory formation to be taken
into account by the gas extraction zone monitoring system;
• the preparation of propositions on the structure of the software and hardware for
the gas extraction zone monitoring system taking into consideration the real
conditions of the initial informational ﬁeld, the presence of developed tech-
nologies for monitoring the data processing, and environment quality standards;
• an elaboration of a version of the project describing in detail the hierarchy of the
subsystems and their elements with instructions for the algorithmical and
technical infrastructure of the environmental monitoring system;
• preparation of the technical project for the environmental monitoring system
with the indication of the ﬁnal variant chosen, and with the substantiation of the
set of devices, the software, the informational network components, the control
structure and recommendations for the operation of the system; and
• preparation of the technical documentation for the full set of monitoring system
components with detailed calculation of the reliability, functional effectivity and
stability, and with recommendations of possible modernization stages reﬂecting
the consideration of the system operational experience.

Ecoinformatics Problems of the World Ocean

The monitoring system design depends on the conditions of its functioning.
These conditions are connected basically with the hydrophysical properties of the
environment. The synoptical situation inﬂuences the speed of the degradation
processes and of the oil product transport through the food chains. All aquatories
can be placed by the hydrophysical parameters into two classes: freezing and
nonfreezing. It is evident that from the view point of modeling, the second class is a
special case of the ﬁrst class when the snow and ice cover thickness equals zero.
Therefore, the ﬁrst class is considered in detail. The Shtockman’s gas extraction
zone situated in the Barents Sea with high variability of the synoptic situation is
accompanied during the year by periods of sharp change in the hydrophysical state
of the sea environment. In this zone, the air masses brought from the Atlantic Ocean
and the Central Arctic aquatories collide and mix up. The monsoon character of the
Barents Sea climate is shown by the presence of winds in the low atmospheric
layers which blow from the ocean to the land in summer and in the opposite
direction during the whole winter. The winter season (October–March) is charac-
terized by strong cyclonic activity (the largest number of days with storms and
maximal repetition of strong winds). The ice cover achieves its maximal size in
April. During the June–August the period of cyclonic activity is minimal.
The properties mentioned above allow us to make the obvious conclusion that
the technical realization of the system to measure the oil pollutants of Shtockman’s
gas extraction zone demands the realization of devices protected from great
physical loads and considerable temperature variations. At the same time, powerful
turbulence of the lower atmosphere layer near the water surface in the winter
reduces the quantity of measurements points in space which are required to give the
necessary information. If the wind speed is more than 5 m s−1 and the atmosphere
turbulence is high then the atmosphere can be considered as well mixed with a
sufﬁcient precision on the territory of 50 × 50 km. In this case, the measurements
can be realized at two or three sites of the aquatory. On the contrary, in the summer
(June–August), when the intensity of the atmosphere turbulence is decreased, the
measurements need to be realized in the area of inﬂuence of each oil well. The
assessment of dispersion of the pollutant and the calculation of its spatial distri-
bution are realized by means of corresponding models of atmosphere dynamics.
The most important stage of the analysis and design of the measuring system to
determine the oil pollution level consists in the description of the sea environment
dynamics. It is known that an oil spill spreading on the sea surface is subordinated
to the superposition of two processes. The ﬁrst is the spill drift due to sea current,
wind and surface waves. The second is the spill spreading over a calm surface.
For the Barents Sea the second process can be not be taken into account under
the synthesis of the gas extraction zone measurement network. This process should
be taken into account only in the hydrophysical model to reﬂect the total range of
the hydrophysical processes.
An analysis of many models describing the oil spreading over the sea surface
gives the following results. The velocity of oil spill motion equals 60 % of the
current speed and 2–4 % of the wind speed. When ice cover exists the wind
component is absent.
4.8
Oil and Gas Extraction in Seas

The character of the gas condensation deposit measuring subsystem securing the
assessment of oil concentration into the sea water thickness essentially depends on
the possibility of putting algorithms into the information processing unit and of
reconstructing the forms of the oil spatial distribution based on data fragmentary in
space and episodical in time. The synthesis of an adequate model to describe the oil
product kinetics in the sea environment under the arctic conditions is an important
procedure.
Calculations show that oil pollution in the arctic climate can persist for several
years. Therefore, the danger of its accumulation is great. The transformation pro-
cesses of oil pollution to other forms under the arctic climate are essentially slowed
down in comparison with the analogous processes in warmer waters.
It is known that contributions to the process of sea water self-cleaning equal
0–70 % for evaporation, 15–30 % for photo-oxidation, and 2–7 % for biological
utilization. In summer conditions the transformation of 0–60 % of the raw oil mass
is realized during 40 days. In winter, these estimations are decreased by approxi-
mately three times. In this period, the process of oil products accumulation by the
ice enters into the action. The intensity of this process depends on the ice porosity.
A perceptible contribution to the aquatory cleaning is introduced by the drifting ice
which secures oil removal in quantities estimated at 25 % of its own weight.
However, the participation of ice in the process of sea surface cleaning from oil
pollution has had negative results. The oil captured by the ice is moved to other
aquatories and practically the same volume is returned to the water environment
when the ice melts. This exchange between aquatories should be taken into con-
sideration under the monitoring system design, since the oil pollutants can reach a
controlled aquatory by such a way. That is why in winter the control of the ice
pollution level in adjoining aquatories is needed.
Shtockman’s gas condensation deposit zone is characterized by such generalized
synoptic and hydrophysical situations which provide the conditions when this zone
is covered by ice during 5 months (from February to June). From February to
March, the ice drifts to the North or to the North–West. Under these conditions, the
drift speed is estimated at 100 km month−1. As a result, the polluted ice reaches the
Central Arctic Basin where it thaws and the oil comes into the water.
The Shtockman’s gas condensation deposit zone is under the inﬂuence of the
West Novaya Zemlya current branch that forms the east boundary of the cyclonic
cycle in the region of the central depression. The conﬁguration of the formation of
the moving water masses suggests that it is necessary to control its southern and
eastern boundaries in order to discover the pollutants brought to the Shtockman’s
gas condensation deposit aquatory from other aquatories.
The oil products are characterized by a multi-component process that expands
the situations set of its behaviour in the sea water. Among the most important
processes of transformation of the oil products in the sea water it is necessary to
indicate the following: dissolving, evaporation, spreading to the deep layers in the
form of drops, oxidation, absorption by suspended organic matter, biosedimenta-
tion, and bacterial decomposition. The objective laws of formation of all these
processes were studied and, therefore, it is necessary to take this into account under
332

the monitoring system design. This will allow the reduction of the standards to the
composition of the measuring equipment and to the regime of the measurements
realization.
The biodegradation of the oil hydrocarbons is an important process of oil
elimination in the sea environment. This process is connected with bacterioplank-
ton, phytoplankton and other sea animals functioning. Taking this process into
consideration in the monitoring system is possible at the expense of including the
ecosystem model of Shtockman’s gas condensation deposit aquatory in the moni-
toring system software. The conceptual model base is represented in Fig. 4.26.
An elaboration of the Shtockman’s gas ﬁeld ecosystem model demands the
consideration of the physical structure of the environment. This structure has a
seasonal character. The parametrization of its vertical structure is possible under the
consideration of results received earlier by many authors (Legendre and Krapivin
1992; Legendre and Legendre 1998; Emery and Thomson 2001; Vinogradov et al.
2001).
The scheme of Fig. 4.26 represents the typical structure of vertical division of the
sea environment. This permits the realization of the scheme of Fig. 4.27.
An ecological monitoring system of practically any anthropogenic-loading
object demands the consideration of all components foreseen by the GIMS tech-
nology. However, natural conditions of the monitoring system functioning demand
the revision of the GIMS formal structure. It is quite evident that in the case
considered, the following standards have to be provided:
• the measuring devices should function reliably under low temperatures;
• the measuring network infrastructure should not demand any additional
construction;
• the informational network should secure the data concept in the framework of
international standards;

• the data processing subsystem should reduce the conditions made by the
demands on the measuring subsystem;
• the data presentation subsystem should allow to the gas condensation deposit
administration the possibility of multi-shape assessment of the environment
state;
• the monitoring system should be combined with other informational systems
(regional, national, and international).
The experience of synthesis of GIS and expert systems having the function of
nature-protection calls for the necessity of observing the conception and subsequent
stages under the realization of the natural environmental monitoring systems
(Krapivin and Shutko 2012) to propose the SEM infrastructure in the form repre-
sented by Fig. 4.27.
The environmental monitoring system software package must be oriented to the
realization of an algorithmical set giving the possibility to realize the following
minimal set of functions:
• integrated assessment of the ecological state of the aquatory;
• assessment of the ecological state of the aquatory for each of its components;
• assessment of the integrated ecological state of the aquatory in the spot, on the
square area and for the total space;
• identiﬁcation of the pollution source; and
• predictional assessment of the ecological state of the aquatory.
The answers to questions arising under the realization of these functions and the
decision making demand transformation of the measurement data in acceptable
format. This can be realized by means of the software package listed below:

• measurement data calibration;
• measurement data ﬁltration;
• technical tools for scanning and blending functions of the measuring devices
with the informational unit;
• decision making about the existence of an external situation;
• spatial-temporal coordination of multiple data types;
• spatial interpolation of the measurement data and formation of spatial images;
• reconstruction of the spatial distribution of environmental characteristics on the
basis of measurements which are fragmentary over the aquatory and the depth;
• calculation of kinetic characteristics of the pollutants in the sea water under
climatic conditions of the sea region;
• calculation of gas contaminants and solid particles content in the atmosphere
over the gas condensat deposit aquatory;
• assessment of the ecological situation of the controlling zone in accordance with
the given criterion;
• synchronization of informational ﬂuxes and securing of its dumping to the data
processing centre in a volley;
• realization of physical-chemical processes in the system atmosphere-sea-gas ﬁeld;
• formation of short- and long- term forecastings of common ecological situations
in the gas ﬁeld zone;
• identiﬁcation of sources causing the disturbance of ecological standards on all
controlled parameters taking into account the accepted criteria set;
• realization of computer cartography algorithms;
• choice of the program system for database control, the elaboration of data
maintenance in the monitoring system informational network and its accumu-
lation to the database;
• software for the user interface;
• software for database maintenance;
• reconstruction of omitted functions under incomplete and inexact information;
• accumulation of knowledge about different speciﬁc and typical situations; and
• formation of the operative data under emergency situations.
Algorithmical support of the monitoring system database has a double load. On
the one hand, the accumulation of data about the functioning of the ecological
system of the gas ﬁeld zone allows us to increase the reliability of receiving
assessments of the ecological situations and to decrease the demands to the mea-
suring subsystem. On the other hand, the monitoring system database can be used
as a fragment of the regional or national database.
The monitoring system functioning is secured by the correlation between the
measuring subsystem, the regenerated database and the model. According to Aota
et al. (1993), continuous monitoring can be realized with sufﬁcient stability only
under adaptive algorithmical support. The dynamic correlation of the functioning
regimes for all subsystems is represented schematically in Fig. 4.28. According to
this scheme, the measuring subsystem can work in discrete regimes together with
the model. Detectors of emergency situations work only in the continuous regime.

1996; Phillips et al. 1997; Mkrtchyan et al. 2004, 2011, 2013; Man et al. 2010). The
results of these expeditions spread over many contaminants of anthropogenic
origin. Here, only one example of oil pollution is considered. Namely it is a matter
of investigations by means of Adaptive Identiﬁer of some water bodies situated on
the territory of South Vietnam. The most important aquatory of South Vietnam is
the area Ω of South-China Sea bordering on Vung Tau city where there exists the
exploration and extraction of oil from the sea bottom. In 1975, the Vietnam Oil and
Gas General Directorate was set up. The majority of the oil companies (Vietsov-
petro, Petrolimex, PetroVietnam) realize national and international projects con-
cerning the exploration and exploitation of the oil and gas extraction zone.
The quality of sea water in this area mainly depends on the oil and gas extraction
zone and the ﬂows of the Mekong and Saigon rivers. The aquatory Ω is restricted
on the north by the coast line running in a north-easterly direction, on the west and
east by the meridians 106oE and 109oE, respectively, and on the south by the
parallel 8.5° north latitude. The water current scheme of this aquatory is considered
as given. According to the existing data it can be approximated by a seasonal
scheme with the attachment to winter (τw), spring (τs), summer (τu) and fall (τa).

Ecoinformatics Problems of the World Ocean

On average during the fall and winter the currents are directed along the coast line
in a north-easterly direction (α = 45o). During the remaining time the currents have
the opposite direction (α = 225o). The speed value is varied insigniﬁcantly both in
space and in time. Near the coastline this speed equals to 2–6 km h−1. The further
one gets from coastline the speed variations are 0.7–4.8 km h−1. It is supposed that
depths the hij are constant on the whole aquatory Ω. The vertical gradient of the
water temperature is considered as negligibly small. The synoptic regime during the
year is approximated by a binary situation: the rainy season exists during May–
October, while from November to April the dry season takes its place.
Table 4.13 consists of some results of oil pollution measurements by means of
Adaptive Identiﬁer. Simulation results are given in Figs. 4.29 and 4.30. As follows
from Fig. 4.29 under the above suppositions, the average annual distributions of oil
hydrocarbons on the aquatory Ω are essentially nonuniform. Taking an average by
the seasons eliminated the inﬂuence of pollution drift by the currents and revealed
the places where oil hydrocarbons always come to the upper sea layer. The degree
of oil hydrocarbon accumulation in the surface-water layer varies between the limits
of 25–130 mg m−2. This is sometimes higher than the oil hydrocarbon concen-
tration in the open ocean and signiﬁcantly lower than in the very polluted waters.
Figure 4.30 forecasts the oil hydrocarbon distribution on the whole aquatory Ω.
It was supposed that the oil hydrocarbon concentration (O) on the boundary ΩB is a
constant equal to 0.001 mg L−1 and is brought into Ω in conformity with the
scheme of the currents stored in the ESECEZ database.

As seen from Fig. 4.30, the stabilized distribution
R
Oðu; k; z; tÞdz is sufﬁciently
well co-ordinated with the direction of the currents. The formation of a ﬁeld with
increased oil hydrocarbon concentration situated near the Vung Tau shelf zone is
explained by the supposition that in the oil and gas extraction site the following

averaged by all seasons. It is supposed that the oil hydrocarbon concentration in ΩR∪ΩP and in oil
and gas extraction zone is constant and is equal to 0.06 mg L−1

conditions occur: Oðu; k; z; tÞ ¼ 0:09 mg L1 in the upper layer, and Oðu; k; z; tÞ ¼
0:05 mg L1 in the remaining water depth. Under other suppositions, the structure
of the distribution Oðu; k; z; tÞ is does not change. Only while the pollution scales
change.
The creation of the monitoring system for the oil and gas extraction zone situated
in the South-China Sea foresees the distinguishing of oil pollution sources. That is
why Adaptive Identiﬁer was used to estimate the oil pollution of the main rivers of
South Vietnam (Saigon and Dong Nai). Apart from this, the task of distinguishing
between oil and salt spills on the water surface of reservoirs, where industrial
biological production is realized, was solved. Moreover, the control of water quality
in the Dongnai river is important for the ecological service of HoChiMinh City.
Table 4.14 and Fig. 4.31 represent some experimental data. It is obvious that the
Saigon river is characterized by unstable formations of oil clots moving randomly
by depth. The predictability of the Saigon river pollution level equals 60–70 %

during 1 day. It is clear that including in the monitoring system functions for the
control of Saigon river pollution demands additional information about the
dynamics of the rise and fall of the tides. This information has to be parameterized
and stored in the monitoring system knowledge base, or come from the measuring
subsystem.
At present, the Dong Nai River has a low pollution level. Measurements data
received by Adaptive Identiﬁer shows a high stability of oil pollution distribution in
this river. Therefore, the realization of the monitoring system function to control oil
pollution of the Dong Nai River can be considered as a future stage.
Finally, Fig. 4.31 represents hourly dynamics of the oil pollution level for both
rivers. The measurements by Adaptive Identiﬁer are realized for the Saigon River at
its middle in the HoChiMinh city center and for the Dong Nai River in the drinking
water station at the distance of 30 m from the waterfront. Comparison of the curves
of Fig. 4.31 shows that control of the oil pollution near this station should be
realized by means of Adaptive Identiﬁer in the continuous regime and has the
possibility to control the water standard. It is more difﬁcult to control the water
standard in the Saigon River, where hourly variations of the pollution level oscillate
between the limits of 100–300 %. Such oscillations are caused by complex
hydrodynamic conditions of the spreading of the pollutants. A combination of high
current velocity, rise and fall of the tides and high turbulence causes the formation
of pollutant clots which move as closed water volumes.

4.10 Estimation of Oil Hydrocarbon Pollution Parameters
in Sea Water
The problem of identiﬁcation and assessment of oil pollution parameters in the
water environment has been studied sufﬁciently. The existing methods of oil dis-
covery in the water may be divided into two groups, surface ﬁlm and suspension,
corresponding to the state of the oil hydrocarbons. The oil and oil products, by their
physical-chemical properties, can form water ﬁlms, clots, emulsions, and solutions
in the sea. The oil ﬁlms have thicknesses from fractions of a millimetre to several
centimetres. All this determines the methods of oil pollution monitoring.
The choice of monitoring method is determined by the oil pollution level. It is
known that oil pollution exercises inﬂuence on the physical-chemical processes
taking place in the sea water. Speciﬁcally, the surface strength for oil and oil
products is two-four times less than for non-polluted water. The thermal conduc-
tivities and thermal capacities of water and oil are distinct and equal respectively to
0.599 W m−1K−1 and 4.187 kJ kg−1K−1 for water and to 0.15 W m−1K−1 and 1.7–
2.1 kJ kg−1K−1 for oil. These distinctions inﬂuence the many processes in the
atmosphere-water system. Oil pollution ﬁlms decrease thermal conductivity and
thermal capacity of the upper sea layer. They change the evaporation process
decreasing it by 1.5 times or more, they disturb the gas exchange between the
atmosphere and sea water, and they change the water temperature. All these effects
are used for the design of measuring devices to estimate the oil pollution level
(Klyuev 2000; Marhaba et al. 2000). Microwave methods are described by
Krapivin (2000). Inhere we consider optical methods.
On a level with the above mentioned effects of sea water oil pollution there
exists an optical effect which is determined by the change in sea surface albedo and
by the variation of the interior optical properties of sea water. Theoretical
approaches to the problem of light spreading in the sea water environment or its
reﬂection from the sea surface are connected with the consideration of various
tasks. For example, calculation of the reﬂection coefﬁcient under different sea
environment states is given by Kabanov et al. (2000). Theoretical and experimental
studies show the existence of contrasts in the reﬂecting properties of oil ﬁlms and a
non-polluted water surface (Fig. 4.32). Certainly, these contrasts are functions of
many parameters: wavelength, oil ﬁlm thickness, vision angle, salinity, water
roughness, light intensity, and content of other contaminants. As shown by Hong
et al. (1994), the use of spectral measurements at a range of 380–700 nm allows one
to have a reliable technique for the detection of oil pollution on the water surface.
The Adaptive Identiﬁer is designed on the principle shown in Figs. 9.11 and 9.12
. Adaptive Identiﬁer consists of a multi-channel device registering the light scat-
tered in the water or reﬂected from the surface in the visible range, of an infor-
mational interface and of software. The principle of the functioning of the system
consists in the registration in numerical code n∈[7, 128] of spectra {Tn(λ): λ∈[λi, λi
+1], i = 0, 1, …, n −1} on the basis of which the solution about the existence of oil
pollution is taken and the assessment of its parameters is realized. Speciﬁcally, for
4.10
Estimation of Oil Hydrocarbon Pollution …
341

n = 7 the basic spectral characteristics of the channels are given in Fig. 4.33. It is
easy to see that the spectral characteristics of the Adaptive Identiﬁer interference
ﬁlters have pronounced maxima and insigniﬁcant intersections. The maximal
conductance of the channels is observed under λ1 = 398 nm, λ2 = 439 nm, λ3 =
480 nm, λ4 = 510 nm, λ5 = 583 nm, λ6 = 631 nm, and λ7 = 680 nm. A typical
correlation matrix with the addition of the solar radiation spectrum [λ0, λn] is
represented in Table 4.15. The stability of this matrix equals to 5 %.
An increase in the size of n certainly expands the possibilities for oil pollution
classiﬁcation. Adaptive Identiﬁer gives such possibilities. A combined use of real-
time spectrometry measurements and data processing methods has been imple-
mented for the ﬁrst time in an Adaptative Identiﬁer. Its creation becomes possible
due to the new approach in the ﬁeld of polarization optics. An effective elemental
basis for polarization optics and a method of discrete modulation of the polarization
mode have been developed (Kovalev et al. 1999). The application of simple and
highly effective polarization switches and sets of silicon photodiodes with arbitrary
access to them has essentially simpliﬁed the problem of creating compact and
cheap
polarization-optical
devices:
spectro-photometers,
spectro-polarimeters,
spectro-ellipsometers etc.
The technology of combined use of spectrometry and algorithms of identiﬁca-
tion and recognition has—for the ﬁrst time—allowed the creation of a standard
integral complex of instrumental, algorithmical, modular and software tools for the
collection and processing of data on the aquatic environment with forecasting and
decision-making functions. The adaptive identiﬁer of a second version has a set of
modiﬁcations intended on application under different conditions. A stationary
version covers the complete set of technical and algorithmic tools providing for
real-time measurements. This version can be used if a power supply line with a
voltage of 220 V is available. A handhold ﬁeld version of the Adaptive Identiﬁer
provides two applications. If a notebook computer is available under ﬁeld

conditions (in the absence of a power supply line), the whole spectrum of the
adaptive identiﬁer is realized in real-time mode. Otherwise, the results of the
measurements are stored in an off-line storage unit and are processed later.
The algorithmic support of Adaptive Identiﬁer is based on a complex application
of methods of recognition and classiﬁcation of discrete images formed on the basis
of 35 spectra registered during a ﬁxed period of time. A time interval of 1 s is
usually established and provides about 60 values of brightness for each of the 35
optical channels. The spectra obtained are sources of sets of statistical parameters
and different characteristics united into vector spaces for their comparison with
standard samples stored on the computer. The technology of this comparison
depends on the diversity of identiﬁcation methods.
The adaptive identiﬁer is designed to learn from the measurement of spectral
characteristics and the simultaneous independent measurement of the content of
chemical elements in the aquatic environment. As a result, a standard bank is
formed in the knowledge base, the comparison with which provides the solution to
the identiﬁcation problem. The software of the adaptive identiﬁer provides different
algorithms for the solution to this problem, and cluster analysis is among them.
The adaptive identiﬁer can be used in different ﬁelds where the quality of water
should be estimated or the presence of a particular set of chemical elements should
be revealed. The adaptive identiﬁer solves these problems by real-time monitoring
of the aquatic environment. In the stationary version, it allows the tracking of the
dynamics of the water quality in a stream, and when placed on a ship, it allows the
measurement of water pollution parameters along the route.
The functionality of the adaptive identiﬁer can be extended by increasing the
volume of standards in the knowledge base. The use of a natural light source allows
the examination of soils, the identiﬁcation of oil products on a water surface, the
determination of the degree of pollution of atmospheric air and the estimation of the
conditions of other objects of the environment, whose spectral images may change.
That is why the adaptive identiﬁer is a universal measuring device the use of which
in the monitoring system allows one to have operative information, not only on the
arising of oil pollution, but also about other pollutants which may appear in the oil
and gas extraction zone.
4.11 Adaptive Technologies and Sea Navigation
The GIMS technology is instrument for the increase in effectiveness of decision
making under management complex processes and systems subjected to the
inﬂuence of external factors and being in steady development or moving. One of the
GIMS application areas is sea navigation where management of physical system
ship-sea is connected with solution of many tasks in operative regime of mea-
surement and identiﬁcation of environmental characteristics. Remote hydrophysical
experiment is more reliable method for the control and management of ship-sea
system (Krylov et al. 1981).

Ecoinformatics Problems of the World Ocean

The ship moving on the dynamical sea surface is described by the theory of
automatic control equations. These equations are extended by hydrophysical cor-
relations reﬂecting functional dependencies between the ship moving parameters
and characteristics of sea currents and turbulent ﬂows. Complete series of equations
describing the ship-sea system dynamics has a set of parameters which determine
the state of this system. Methods for assessment of these parameters developed in
the experimental hydrophysics give in most cases averaged by time and space
values that does not correspond to the demand of efﬁcacy and do not give the
possibility to have in full measure the complex database for the ship management in
real time regime, for example, by means of their realization in the autopilot mode.
Speciﬁcally, this is important in zones of ports where calculation of safety condi-
tions for ship has to be operative.
Remote monitoring methods of sea surface in the aggregate with data processing
algorithms are characterized by responsiveness. The development of these methods
with reference to the sea navigation problems is one of the ecoinformatics tasks
(Krapivin and Thu 2001). The reception of initial information for the calculation of
ship velocity and course basing on the whole data received from navigation systems
and on remote sensing data is considered as experimental ecoinformatics task the
solution of which is realized by the choice of the most reliable information sources
and rational methods for its processing.
Moving or stopping ship is subjected by action of forces formed by complex of
processes taking place into the sea arising of which connects with the wind, tem-
perature gradients, water density variations, gravitation waves etc. Trajectory tasks
of the ship handling are divided into two classes. The ﬁrst class has local character
when the operative control of physical processes in the ship-sea system is needed.
These tasks are arisen in the connection with the necessity to prevent the ship
intense heaving or to decrease the yaw angle. In this situation, the measuring remote
sensing system is installed on the ship board. The second class of tasks is connected
with an assessment of sea state on long distances of ship course under information
security for its management systems. Generation of such information is possible by
using satellites, ﬂying laboratories or coastal systems.
The task is in the regulator design which is located on the ship provides optimal
control of the ship course basing on the receiving information about the sea state
and meteorological parameters. Since environmental parameters during the ship
moving are changing, the regulator must have adaptability function with time
interval that is less time between changes of environmental parameters.
The principal scheme for adaptive regulation of the ship control parameters,
using GIMS, consists in the determination of the ship location and assessment of
discrepancy in forecasting ship course basing on the data from on-board navigation
sensors and radio-navigation satellite systems. Correcting controlling parameters of
the ship moving course are calculated on the base of this discrepancy value. The
ship course warning interval is selected by the navigator depending on the real
situation or is optimized automatically if this decision is not taken.

the ship course and rough sea as well as on different restrictions for the ship moving
(other ships, waterway etc.). Adaptive regulator of the ship course provided with this
model gives in real time recommendations for the ship course change minimizing the
risk of emergency conditions (strike with barrier, beaching etc.).
Figure 4.34 explains the interrelation between physical factors in the ship-sea
system. According to this scheme, period and frequency of collision between ship
and waves is calculated using the following formulas:
Te ¼ Lx=½Vx  Vcosv;
xl ¼ 2p½Vx  Vcosv=Lx;
ð4:52Þ
where Te is the period of the ship collision with wave components, ωl is the angle
frequency of collision (=2π/Tl), Lω is the wavelength, V is the ship speed, Vω is the wave
velocity, χ is the corner between the ship speed vector and the direction of waves.
From Fig. 4.34 and Eq. (4.52) it is easy to see that if sea wave is moving stern of
ship (90° < χ < 270°, cos χ < 0), the frequency of collisions is more than in other
cases (0° ≤χ ≤90°, 270° ≤χ ≤360°). Ship moving before the wave can be
associated with small values of Vω −Vcos χ and, therefore, frequency of collisions
will be also low in contrast to other situations. Hence, physical factors of the ship-
sea system dynamics are essentially diverse into two zones of the angle χ changes.
The knowledge of these factors gives the possibility to control a ship management.
In the case of an astern wave, according to (4.52) there are three situations:
• If Vω > Vcosχ there is an overtaking wave. In this case, waves overhaul the ship
and the frequency of collisions between the ship and waves is low.
• If Vω = Vcosχ there is a semi-static situation. In this case, the frequency of
collisions between the ship and waves is near zero and if at the time t = 0 the
ship is situated in stable position regarding to waves, this state is retained at any
time t = t1.

• If Vω < Vcosχ there is an escaping wave. This situation corresponds to the case
when the frequency of collisions as in the case Vω > Vcosχ can be lower but
opposite by sign, and ship will overhaul the wave.
For example, for a ship having length 152.4 m (0.5 < Lω/L < 1.5) with ratio
height/length = 1/48 under χ = 30° and = 60°, V = 9.3 m/s when Vω > Vcosχ. In this
case, maximal lateral movement amplitudes can reach about 2.5°. Amplitude will
be growing linearly with an increase of relation wave height/wavelength, while
frequency will be changing intensively as L1/2 and collision amplitude will be
increasing with growth of the ship velocity but will sharply decrease if the wave-
length becomes lower.
Practical navigation takes into account the physical forces which stimulate the
ship drift using an approximate model (Matusevich 1956)

Problems of the ship management under its approach to the port and the cal-
culation of powers affecting it under berthing in the port have speciﬁc place in
navigation. The solution of these problems demands the study of wave energy
formation causes that is connected with different sources of water mass ﬂuctuation,
due to the variety in physical inﬂuence of sea environment on the ship. Methods
based on the wave energy balance equations are used to solve the tasks arising here.

Seiche oscillation takes place in the port zone, due to the penetration of low-
frequency oscillations from the open sea to the port zone. This oscillation stimulates
a very dangerous phenomenon called as harbor oscillation that leads to disagreeable
consequences for the ship. Cycles of harbor oscillations range from 0.5 s to 4 min
with an amplitude of horizontal oscillations equal to 4 m. According to the theory of
formation of low-frequency oscillations two systems of wind-induced waves exist
in the sea. One of them is a resonance system with phase speed equal to the wind
speed. The second system is under-resonance with smaller phase speed that steadily
increases. Two maxima correspond to these systems in the energetic spectrum of
wind-induced sea roughness. The origin of such a situation is impossible under long
strong stable wind above vast aquatory (linear range about 100 km). The calculation
of low-frequency oscillations in coastal zone can be realized using the following

The ship moving on sea surface is deﬁned by numerous factors which were listed
above as well by Earth magnetic ﬁeld, inaccuracy of navigation devices and errors
in the measurements of distance up to the lightships. This implies that ship moving
has stochastic character. Let the ship start his moving from point O of rectangular
system of coordinates φOλ at time t = 0. It is supposed that ship shift on the axis φ
is forced by regular factor shifting it by Δφ ≥0 at time unit. Ship shift Δη on axis λ
has stochastic character with distribution

where a and σ2 are the average of distribution and dispersion of Δη, respectively.
As a result, the ship will be in coordinates (φT, η) at time t = T under the ﬁnal
goal to achieve a point (φT, 0). It is supposed that axis φ and axis t are identical.
Time T for the ship moving from point O to point (φT, η) equals to T = φT/Δφ.
Let us divide the ship path into intervals from which it passes during time periods
t1, …, tn+1 (t1 + ···+tn+1 = T) and it is supposed that a = 0 when t = 0. Then at the moment
t1 the ship will be to the position (φt1, η1) where ( g1

Ecoinformatics Problems of the World Ocean

4.12 Conclusion
The World Ocean is among the biggest reservoirs for life on the Earth. Therefore, it
is important to learn about the issues—pollution, overﬁshing, and global warming
chief among them—and the possible solutions for protecting the ocean. There are
many problems a solution to which should be the subject of present society:
• Overexploitation of the World Ocean resources reaches unacceptable levels. For
example, the biomass of global ﬁsh stocks has been allowed to run down to the
point where it is no longer possible to catch the amount ofﬁsh that could be caught.
• The oceans are rising and getting warmer faster than predicted. Global warming
is creating a climate time bomb by storing enormous amounts of heat in the
waters of the World Ocean. Warmer waters change trophic pyramids and global
circulation processes in the atmosphere-land-ocean system. The destruction of
the ocean’s most important predators has signiﬁcant consequences that ripple
down the basic food chains.
• Ocean acidiﬁcation is destined to be one of the biggest issues humanity has ever
over faced. Ocean acidiﬁcation refers to the reduction in the pH of the ocean
over an extended period time, caused preliminary by the uptake of carbon
dioxide from the atmosphere. Research and understanding of this progressive
process is important for ﬁshing and biological processes. The average global
surface ocean pH has already fallen from a pre-industrial value of 8.2–8.1,
corresponding to an increase in acidity of about 30 %. Values of 7.8–7.9 are
expected by 2100, representing a doubling of acidity.
• One of the critical ocean issues is coral reefs. Live coral are colonies of small
animals embedded in calcium carbonate shells. Coral reefs are some of the
world’s most productive ecosystems, providing complex and varied marine
habitats that support a wide range of other organisms. Coral reefs are dying
around the world. In particular, coral mining, agricultural and urban runoff,
pollution (organic and inorganic), overﬁshing, blast ﬁshing, disease, and the
digging of canals and assess into islands and bays are localized threats to coral
ecosystems. Protection and restoration of coral reef environments is very
prominent for the World Ocean management.
• One of the exacerbated dilemmas of the oceans is offshore drilling for the oil
production. When oil is extracted from the ocean ﬂoor, other chemicals like
mercury, arsenic, and lead come up with it. Furthermore, the infrastructure
projects to transport the oil often create worse problems, eroding the coastline.
The mercury is absorbed by organisms on the bottom of the food chain. Bigger
ﬁshes eat smaller ﬁshes. The consumption of ﬁsh is by far the most signiﬁcant
source of ingestion-related mercury exposure in humans and animals.
• Ocean dead zones are widened. Dead zones are hypoxic (low-oxygen) areas in
the world’s oceans caused by extensive nutrient pollution (nitrogen and phos-
phorous). Low oxygen levels recorded along numerous coastal waters where
intensive economics is developed. Today, more than 500 dead zones are
growing around the globe.
4.12
Conclusion
353

Ocean health protection has not alternative. A focus on how to protect the World
Ocean is important in order to solve the climate warming problem. Ecoinformatics
methods can help to solve the tasks arising here. It is impermissible for humanity to
realize large-scale anthropogenic projects without their preliminary consideration
by means of simulation experiments. The GIMS technology helps to realize such
simulation experiments taking into consideration different hypothetical scenarios.

Chapter 5
Ecoinformatics Problems of Global
Climate Change
5.1 Common Questions of Global Climate Change
Climate is the average pattern of weather over the long term. The earth’s climate
has warmed and cooled for millions of years, since long before people appeared on
the scene. The unprecedented growth of interest in the problems of climate
observed during the last decades has stimulated both scientiﬁc and applied devel-
opments which have considerably advanced our understanding of the causes of
present climate changes, the laws of paleoclimate. They have also advanced the
development of scenarios for possible future changes of climate, though it must be
stressed that scenarios are not predictions and that their potential for developing
predictions must be assessed as doubtful. Unfortunately the growing interest in
climate is, in part, explained by the important role played by various speculative
exaggerations and apocalyptic ‘predictions’ (e.g., complete melting of the arctic sea
ice in the ﬁrst half of this century).
The problems of climate change, formulated as anthropogenic global warming,
have therefore, become a focus of geopolitics and global environmental policy.
Presidents and prime ministers of several countries now discuss whether the Kyoto
Protocol (KP) should be considered as a scientiﬁcally justiﬁed document. Confu-
sion is caused, in particular, by the lack of sufﬁciently clear and agreed terminology.
Ignoring the very complicated notion of climate itself (which needs a separate
discussion), one should remember that climate change was deﬁned as being an-
thropogenically induced. One of the main unresolved problems is the absence of
convincing quantitative estimates of the contribution of anthropogenic factors to the
formation of global climate, though there can be no doubt that anthropogenic
forcing of climate does exist.
Some international documents containing analyses of current ideas of climate
refer to a consensus with respect to scientiﬁc conclusions contained in these doc-
uments. This wrongly assumes that the development of science is determined not by
different views and relevant discussions, but by a general agreement and even

voting. Apart from the question of deﬁnitions, the issue of uncertain conceptual
estimates concerning various aspects of the climate problem remains of importance.
In particular, this refers to the main conclusion of the summary of the IPCC reports
(IPCC 2001, 2005, 2007) which claims that: “… An increasing body of observa-
tions gives a collective picture of a warming world and most of the observed
warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to human activities”.
It is a pity that in the recent (2003) article in the British newspaper The Guardian
the former chairman of the IPCC Working Group 1 Professor J. Houghton
(Houghton 2003; Houghton et al. 2001) compared the threat of anthropogenic
climate changes with weapons of mass destruction, and accused the USA of their
refusal to support the concept of global warming and KP as being the basic cause of
this threat. No matter how paradoxical it may be, such a statement has been made
against a background of an increasing understanding of imperfections in present
global climate models and the absence of their adequate veriﬁcation, which makes
the predictions on the basis of numerical modeling no more than conditional sce-
narios. As for the USA, their huge efforts to support climate studies should be
encouraged. These efforts have a special emphasis on the improvement of the
observing system and on developments in the ﬁeld of climate problems in general
(Kondratyev and Krapivin 2001a; McBrean 1998; Randall et al. 2007).
The statement of the Intergovernmental Group G-8 published on 2 July 2003
(G8 2003) has justly emphasized that in the years to come efforts will be con-
centrated on three directions:
(1) co-ordination of global observations strategies;
(2) provision of a pure, more stable and efﬁcient application of energy; and
(3) provision
of
sustainable
agricultural
production
and
preservation
of
biodiversity.
The Earth’s climate system has indeed changed markedly since the industrial
revolution, with some changes being of anthropogenic origin. The consequences of
climate change do present a serious challenge to the policy-makers responsible for
the environmental policy. This alone makes the acquisition of objective information
on climate change, of its impact and possible responses, most urgent. With this aim
in mind, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the UN Environ-
mental Programme in 1988 organized the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) divided into three working groups (WG) with spheres of respon-
sibility for the:
(1) scientiﬁc aspects of climate and its change (WG-I);

The IPCC has so far prepared series of detailed reports as well as several special
reports and technical papers (Pachauri and Reisinger 2007; Griggs and Noguer
2002; Alcamo et al. 1994; WMO 2000; Woodcock 1999a, b). The fourth synthesis
IPCC-2007 Report provides integrated view of climate change paying attention to
the following six themes:
356

Ecoinformatics Problems of Global Climate Change

• role of information on observed changes in climate and the effects of past
climate change in natural the NSS;
• causes of change considering both natural and anthropogenic drivers of climate
change;
• future climate change and its impacts;
• adaptation and mitigation options and responses related with sustainable
development;
• the long-term perspectives and analyses scientiﬁc, technical and socio-economic
aspects relevant to adaptation and mitigation; and
• robust ﬁndings and key uncertainties.
Analysis of the observational data as contained in TAR led to the conclusion that
global climate change is taking place. The Reports IPCC (2001, 2005, 2007) give a
detailed review of the observational data of the spatial-temporal variability of the
concentrations of various GHGs and aerosols in the atmosphere. The adequacy of
numerical models was discussed from the viewpoint of the climate-forming factors
and the usefulness of models to predict climate change in the future. The main
conclusion about anthropogenic impacts on climate was that “there is new and
stronger evidence that most of the warming observed during the last 50 years has
been determined by human activity”. According to all prognostic estimates con-
sidered in TAR, both surface air temperature (SAT) increase and sea level rise
should take place during the 21st century.
When characterizing the IPCC data for the empirical diagnostics of climate,
Folland et al. (2002) drew attention to the uncertainty of the deﬁnitions of some
basic concepts. According to IPCC terminology, climate changes are statistically
substantial variations of an average state or its variability, whose stability is pre-
served for long time periods (for decades and longer). Climate changes can be
natural in origin (connected both with internal processes and external impacts) and/
or may be determined by anthropogenic factors, such as changes in the atmospheric
composition or land use. This deﬁnition differs from that suggested in the Frame-
work Climate Change Convention (FCCC), where climate changes are only of
anthropogenic origin, in contrast to natural climate change. In accordance with the
IPCC terminology, climatic variability means variations of the average state and
other statistical characteristics (MSD, repeatability of extreme events, etc.) of cli-
mate on every temporal and spatial scale, beyond individual weather phenomena.
Hence, climate variability can be both of natural (due to internal processes and
external forcings) and anthropogenic origin: possess both of internal and external
variability. As Folland et al. (2002) have noted, seven key questions are most
important for the diagnostics of observed changes and the climate variability:
(1) How signiﬁcant is climate warming?
(2) Is currently observed warming signiﬁcant?
(3) How rapidly has the climate changed in the distant past?
(4) Have precipitation and atmospheric water content changed?
(5) Do changes in the general circulation of the atmosphere and ocean take place?
5.1
Common Questions of Global Climate Change
357

(6) Have climate variability and climate extremes changed?
(7) Are observed trends internally coordinated?
In order to answer the above questions, the reliability of observational data is
fundamental. Adequate empirical diagnostics of climate remain impossible without
such observational data. Yet the information concerning numerous meteorological
parameters, so very important for documentation, detection and attribution of cli-
mate change, remains inadequate for the drawing of reliable conclusions. This is
especially true for the global trends of those parameters (e.g., precipitation), which
are characterized by a great regional variability.
Folland et al. (2002) have answered some of the questions above. A comparison
of the secular change of global average annual sea surface temperature (SST), land
surface air temperature (LSAT), and nocturnal marine air temperature (NMAT)
over the ocean for the period 1861–2000 on the whole revealed some similarity,
though the warming in the 1980s from LSAT data turned out to be stronger, and the
NMAT data showed a moderate cooling at the end of the 19th century not
demonstrated by SST data. The global temperature trend can be interpreted
cautiously as equivalent linear warming over 140 years, constituting 0.61 °C at a
95 % conﬁdence level with an uncertainty range of ±0.16 °C. Later on, in 1901 a
warming by 0.57 °C took place with an uncertainty range of ±0.17 °C. These
estimates suggest that at the beginning from the end of the 19th century, an average
global warming by 0.6 °C took place, with the interval of estimates corresponding
to a 95 % conﬁdence level equal to 0.4–0.8 °C.
The spatial structure of the temperature ﬁeld in the 20th century was characterized
by a comparatively uniform warming in the tropics and by a considerable variability
in the extratropical latitudes. The warming between 1910 and 1945 was initially
concentrated in the Northern Atlantic and the adjacent regions. The Northern
Hemisphere was characterized by cooling between 1946 and 1975, while in the
Southern Hemisphere some warming was observed during this period. The temper-
ature rise observed during the last decades (1970–2000) turns out, on the whole, to
have been globally synchronous and clearly manifested across Northern Hemisphere
continents in winter and spring. In some Southern Hemisphere regions and in the
Atlantic, however, a small all-year-round cooling was observed. A temperature
decrease in the Northern Atlantic between 1960 and 1985 was later followed by an
opposite trend. On the whole, the climate warming over the period of measurements
was more uniform in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere. In
many continental regions between 1950 and 1993, the temperature increased more
rapidly at night than during daytime (this does not refer, however, to coastal regions).
The rate of temperature increase varied from 0.1 to 0.2 °C/10 years.
According to the data of aerological observations, the air temperature in the
lower and middle troposphere was increasing after 1958 at a rate of 0.1 °C/10 years,
but in the upper troposphere (after 1960) it remained more or less constant. A
combined analysis of the aerological and satellite information has shown that in the
period 1979–2000 the temperature trend in the lower troposphere was weak,
whereas near the land surface it turned out to be statistically signiﬁcant and reached
358
5
Ecoinformatics Problems of Global Climate Change

0.16 ± 0.06 °C/10 years. The statistically substantial trend of the difference between
the Earth’s surface and the lower troposphere constituted 0.13 ± 0.06 °C/10 years,
which differs from the data for the period 1958–1978, when the average global
temperature in the lower troposphere increased more rapidly (by 0.03 °C/10 years)
than near the surface. The considerable differences between the temperature trends
in the lower troposphere and near the surface are most likely to be real. So far, these
differences cannot be convincingly explained. The climate warming in the Northern
Hemisphere observed in the 20th century was the most substantial over the last
1,000 years according to the observational warming (Mikolajewicz et al. 2004;
Islam et al. 2005; Jacobson 2000).
Special attention has been paid in the IPCC Reports (IPCC 2001, 2005, 2007) to
the possibility for predicting future climatic changes. The chaotic character of the
atmospheric dynamics limits the long-term weather forecasts to 1 or 2 weeks and
prevents the prediction of a detailed climate change (e.g., it is impossible to predict
precipitation in Great Britain for the winter of 2050). However, it is possible to
consider climate projections, that is, to develop scenarios of probable climate
changes, due to the continuing growth of GHGs concentrations in the atmosphere.
Such scenarios, if credible, may be useful for decision-makers in the ﬁeld of eco-
logical policy. The basic method to make such scenarios tangible involves the use
of numerical climate models Climate that simulate interactive processes in the
atmosphere-ocean-land surface-cryosphere-biosphere climatic system (Jönsson
et al. 2004). As Collins and Senior (2002) noted, because there are so many such
models, the serious difﬁculty arises as to which is the best model to choose. As this
problem of choice is insoluble, there remains the possibility of comparing the
climate scenarios obtained by using various models.
According to the IPCC recommendations, four levels of projection reliability are
considered:
(1) from reliable to very probable (in this case there is an agreement between the
results for most of the models);
(2) very probably (an agreement of new projections obtained with the latest
models);
(3) probable (new projections with an agreement for a small number of models);
and
(4) restrictedly probable (model results are not certain but changes are physically
possible).
A principal difﬁculty in giving substance to the projections is the impossibility of
determining agreed predictions on how GHGs concentrations will evolve in future,
which makes it necessary to take into account a totality of various scenarios. The
huge thermal inertia of the World Ocean dictates a possibility of delayed climatic
impacts of the GHGs concentrations, which has already increased.
Calculations of annual average global SAT using the energy-balance climate
model with various scenarios of the temporal variations of CO2 concentrations have
led to SAT intervals in 2020, 2050, and 2100 to be 0.3–0.9, 0.7–2.6, and 1.4–5.8 °C
5.1
Common Questions of Global Climate Change
359

respectively. Due to the ocean thermal inertia, a delayed warming should manifest
itself within 0.1–0.2 °C/10 years (such a delay can take place over several decades).
The following conclusions can be attributed to the category of projections with
the highest reliability (Collins and Senior 2002):
(1)
surface air warming should be accompanied by a tropospheric warming and
stratospheric cooling (the latter is due to a decrease of the upward longwave
radiation ﬂux from the troposphere);
(2)
faster warming on land compared to oceanic regions (as a result of the great
thermal inertia of the ocean); a faster warming in the high-mountain regions
(due to albedo feedbacks);
(3)
aerosol-induced atmospheric cooling holds a SAT increase (new estimates
suggest the conclusion about a weaker manifestation of the aerosol impact);
(4)
presence of the warming minima in the North Atlantic and in the circumpolar
regions of the oceans in the Southern Hemisphere due to mixing in the
oceanic thickness;
(5)
decrease of the snow and sea ice cover extent in the Northern Hemisphere;
(6)
increase of the average global content of water vapor in the atmosphere,
enhancement of precipitation and evaporation, as well as intensiﬁcation of
the global water cycle;
(7)
intensiﬁcation (on average) of precipitation in the tropical and high latitudes,
but its attenuation in the sub-tropical latitudes;
(8)
increase of precipitation intensity (more substantial than expected as a result
of precipitation enhancement, on average);
(9)
summertime decrease of soil moisture in the middle regions of the continents
due to intensiﬁed evaporation;
(10)
intensiﬁcation of the El Niño regime in the tropical Paciﬁc with a stronger
warming in the eastern regions than in the western ones, which is accom-
panied by an eastward shift of the precipitation zones;
(11)
intensiﬁcation of the interannual variability of the summer monsoon in the
Northern Hemisphere;
(12)
more frequent appearance of high-temperature extremes but infrequent
occurrence of temperature minima (with an increasing amplitude of the
diurnal temperature course in many regions and with a greater enhancement
of nocturnal temperature minima compared to the daytime maxima);
(13)
higher reliability of conclusions about temperature changes compared to
those about precipitation;
(14)
attenuation of the thermohaline circulation (THC) that causes a decrease of
the warming in the North Atlantic (the effect of the THC dynamics cannot
however compensate for the warming in West Europe due to the growing
concentration of GHGs); and
(15)
most intensive penetration of the warming into the ocean depth in high
latitude where the vertical mixing is most intensive.
As for the estimates characterized by a lower level of reliability, the conclusion
(at level 4) about the lack of an agreed view on the changing frequency of storms in
360
5

middle latitudes, is of special interest here, as is a similar lack of agreement about
the changing frequency of occurrence of tropical cyclones under global warming.
An important future task is to improve climate models, aimed at reaching eventually
a level of reliability that would enable the prediction of climatic changes.
Allen (2002) has discussed the basic conclusions contained in the “Summary for
policy-makers” (SPM) of the Third IPCC Report and especially of its main con-
clusion that “There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed
during the last 50 years should be attributed to human activity”. This conclusion
supplements the statement according to which “as follows from the present climate
models, it is very unlikely that the warming taking place during the last 100 years
was determined only by the internal variability” (“very unlikely” means that there is
less than one chance of ten for an opposite statement to be well-founded).
Clearly, the reality of such a statement depends on an adequate modeling of the
observed climatic variability. Analysis of the results of the relevant calculations using
six different models has shown that three of six models reproduce climate variability
on time scales from 10 to 50 years which agrees with the observational data.
Another conclusion in SPM (TAR) is that “reconstruction of data on climate for
the last 1,000 years shows that the present warming is unusual and it is unlikely that
it can be only of natural origin” (“unlikely” means that there is less than one chance
of three for an opposite conclusion).
This conclusion is supplemented with the following: “Numerical modeling of the
response to only natural disturbing forces does not explain the warming that took
place in the second half of the 20th century”. This view is based on the analysis of
the results from the numerical modeling of changes in the average global SAT during
the last 50 years. It follows from this that a consideration of natural forcings (solar
activity, volcanic eruptions) has demonstrated a climatic cooling (mainly due to
large-scale eruptions in 1982 and 1991) which has allowed the conclusion that the
impact of only natural climatic factors is unlikely. However, there is only one chance
in three that it was so: such carefulness is due to insufﬁcient reliability based on
indirect information concerning natural forcings in the past.
Results of numerical modeling cannot explain the pre-1940 climate warming
with only anthropogenic factors taken into account, but are quite adequate con-
sidering both natural and anthropogenic impacts (GHGs and sulphate aerosol). As it
was mentioned in SPM of TAR, “these results… do not exclude possibilities of
contributions of other forcings”. It is possible therefore that good agreement of the
calculated and observed secular trends of SAT may in part be determined by a
random mutual compensation of uncertainties. Another important illustration of the
inadequacy of the numerical modeling results is their difference with observations
concerning temperature changes near the Earth’s surface and in the free tropo-
sphere. If, as according to models, the tropospheric temperature increases more
rapidly than near the surface, then the analysis of observational data between 1979
and 2000 reveals that the temperature increase in the free troposphere is slower and
probably is absent at all (Chou et al. 2002; Collins et al. 1998; Conant et al. 2002).
When assessing the content of the IPCC-2001 Report, Griggs and Noguer (2002)
argued that this report:
5.1
Common Questions of Global Climate Change
361

(1) contains a most complete description of the current ideas about the known and
unknown aspects of the climate system and the associated factors;
(2) is based on the knowledge of an international group of experts;
(3) is prepared and based on open and professional reviewing;
(4) is based on scientiﬁc publications.
Sadly, none of these statements can be convincingly substantiated. The IPCC-
2001 Report has therefore been strongly criticized in the scientiﬁc literature
(Cracknell et al. 2009a, b). In fourth report since 1990, the IPCC offered its strongest
language yet that Earth’s climate is warming and humans are largely responsible:
Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of
increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and
ice, and rising global mean sea level.
Most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid-20th century
is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations.
Discernible human inﬂuences now extend to other aspects of climate, including ocean
warming, continental-average temperatures, temperature extremes, and wind patterns.
Earth has warmed, sea levels have begun to rise at an accelerated rate, and
Northern Hemisphere snow cover has decreased substantially over the past
150 years (Fig. 5.1). These facts are not controversial. The big change from the
IPCC’s last report, in 2001, is the level of conﬁdence on if humans are to blame. In
that report, human-emitted (anthropogenic) greenhouse gases were estimated to be
likely responsible for Earth’s temperature increase (67–90 % chance), while the
new report says it is very likely (greater than 90 % chance).
On 24th December 2009 the UN General Assembly adopted a Resolution
(A/RES/64/236) agreeing to hold the United Nations Conference on Sustainable
Development (UNCSD) in 2012—also referred to as ‘Rio+20’. The Conference
seeks three objectives:
• securing renewed political commitment to sustainable development,
• assessing the progress and implementation gaps in meeting already agreed
commitments, and
• addressing new and emerging challenges.
The Member States have agreed on the following two themes for the Conference:
green economy within the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication,
and institutional framework for sustainable development. The U.N. Conference on
Sustainable Development (Rio+20), a once-a-decade meeting aimed at reconciling
economic and environmental aspirations, has produced a nonbinding declaration,
committing the world’s politicians to modest goals. The proposals set out at the
beginning, such as providing universalenergyaccessand doublingrenewable by2030.
Discussions about global climate change and sustain development problems
which dialog politics, is useful only in restricted sense. Real solution of these
problems is possible in the framework of international working groups used to
complete the mathematical models of the nature-society system.

5.2 General Problems of Global Climate Dynamics
A growing interest in the problems of global climate change determined by its great
practical value and contradictory character of assessments of anthropogenic con-
tribution to climate change, dictates, ﬁrst of all, a necessity of analysis of the
available observational data. Studies of global climate change are connected, ﬁrst of
all, with an accomplishment of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP)

which can be considered as a further development of the Global Atmospheric
Research Programme (GARP), started in 1967, in accordance with an agreement
between the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and International Council
of Scientiﬁc Unions (ICSU) (Kondratyev 1992; Haque 2005; Arneth et al. 2002).
One of the goals of the agreement was to study “… the physical processes in the
troposphere and stratosphere which are important for understanding the factors that
determine the statistical properties of atmospheric general circulation, which can
lead to a better understanding of the physical bases of climate”.
At a ﬁrst session of the Joint Committee on GARP planning held in 1967, the
results of the global numerical climate modeling with the use of a 3D model with a
prescribed doubled CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, have been presented. In
1980, the GARP was transformed into WCRP. Since then, the problem of potential
global climate change due to the GHGs concentration growth has become the
subject of not only science but also politics (Boehmer-Christiansen 1997, 2000;
Zillman 2000; Crowley 2000; Demircian et al. 2002; Frederick 1994). Moreover,
climate problems have always been connected with economics.
The anxiety about a potential global ecological crisis was growing during the last
years. Many investigators (*70 %) of climate believe that the “emissions trading”
will not be an efﬁcient mean of GHGs emissions reduction, since it is based not on
the real reduction of emissions but on the tactics of economic measures. Therefore,
a possibility of practical accomplishment of KP recommendations to reduce GHGs
emissions, raises doubts. This assessment agrees with the fact that there are con-
siderable differences in assessments of climate change (especially on regional
scales), based on the use of various numerical models (Kerr 2000). The conclusion
that under conditions of the supposed global climate warming the agricultural
productivity in different countries will remain high, is not less important (though in
different regions there will be both “winners” and “losers”) and thus of key
importance will be an adaptation of agriculture to changing climate (Sirotenko
2000).
Crichton (2005) discussed the problems arisen in modern climatology con-
cerning the survivability of people when global temperature will increase. General
consensus about future trends in global temperature does not exist among experts.
Some say temperatures will increase by 1.5 °C over the next century, some say
5 °C. Majority of experts tries to solve this problem (Kondratyev 2001, 2002). But
there exist experts who propose to see what happens. As Diamond (2005) points
Crichton’s (2005) strategy of “just it out” is a sure path to dirty air, famine, water
shortages, war, and death. Diamond (2005) examines why certain ancient societies,
such as Easter Islanders and Norse Greenlanders, disappeared, and how many
modern societies are on the same path of destruction due to bad choice made in
response to environmental circumstances.
In accordance with the 1987 UN Resolution on the Environment and Devel-
opment, the ICSU and WMO decided in November 1988 to organize the IPCC.
Representatives of about 30 countries have come to the conclusion about a
necessity not only to analyze the existing ideas of possible anthropogenic climate
change but also to consider its probable impacts on the environment and society as
364

well as to discuss measures needed to prevent undesirable consequences of such
impacts. An important result of IPCC efforts was the development of the FCCC.
The third Conference of representatives of FCCC signatory powers in Kyoto in
December 1997 ended with signing the Kyoto Protocol, the most important part of
which consists in recommendations of the levels of CO2 emissions reduction by the
countries listed in Appendix 1 of the KP (Table 5.1). Relevant discussions were
focused mainly on discussion of economic consequences of emissions reduction
and ignored the problem of substantiation of recommended levels of reduction,

years 2008–2012 (compared to 1990 levels) (Najam and Sagar 1998)

which causes a serious concern, especially from the viewpoint of further prospects
of development of global biospheric processes.
The 2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference was the 18th yearly
session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the 1992 United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 8th session of the
Meeting of the Parties (CMP) to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol (the protocol having been
developed under the UNFCCC’s charter). The conference took place from Monday
26 November to Saturday 8 December 2012, at the Qatar National Convention
Centre in Doha.
At the 2012 Doha climate change talks, Parties to the Kyoto Protocol agreed to a
second commitment period of emissions reductions from 1 January 2013 to 31
December 2020, which takes the form of an amendment to the Protocol. The 37
countries with binding targets in the second commitment period are Australia, all
members of the European Union, Belarus, Croatia, Iceland, Kazakhstan, Norway,
Switzerland, and Ukraine. However, a last minute objection at the conference by
Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan indicates that they will likely withdraw
from the Protocol or not ratify the Protocol amendment. Collectively, these coun-
tries will reduce their emissions 18 % below their 1990 level between 2013 and
2020. The targets may be strengthened by 2014. The emissions targets speciﬁed in
second commitment period will apply to about 15 % of the world’s greenhouse gas
emissions. Several Annex I Parties who participated in Kyoto’s ﬁrst-round have not
taken on new targets in the second commitment period, and are Japan, New Zea-
land, and Russia. Other Annex I Parties without second-round targets are the United
States (which never became a member to Protocol) and Canada (which withdrew
from the Kyoto Protocol effective 2012).
As for the situation with developing countries, in this connection, the main fact
consists in inability of developed countries to perceive the key signiﬁcance of the
principle of equality (this refers, in particular, to the problem of per-capita emis-
sions). It is easy to predict that the discussed arbitrariness in resolving the problem
will remain in the future, though it is apparent that the principles of equality,
responsibility, and efﬁciency formulated in the Climate Convention should serve
the basis. The KP recommendations are in apparent contradiction with these
principles.
The key aspect of the FCCC consists, in the series of recommendations for
reduction, of GHGs emissions to the atmosphere, in order to prevent undesirable
anthropogenic climate changes. As Hulme and Parry (1998) noted, an adoption of
the Protocol on GHGs emissions reduction at the Third FCCC Conference held in
Kyoto in December 1997 can serve a manifestation of the anxiety of the world
community about potential danger for sustainable development of anthropogenic
impacts on climate. The logic of GHGs emissions reduction proceeds from two
assumptions:
366
5
Ecoinformatics Problems of Global Climate Change

(1) a reduction of emissions will make it possible to avoid in the future a dan-
gerous climate change; and
(2) it is cheaper to reduce emissions and provide softer climate changes than to
adapt to the changed climate.
However, the problem is that neither scientists nor politicians have adequately
studied and estimated the destructions, which can be avoided in accomplishing any
scenario of GHGs emissions reduction, and relative expenditures on adaptation or
softening. This is a very complicated problem and therefore it is most difﬁcult to
substantiate an adequate strategy.
In this connection, Hulme and Parry (1998) obtained and discussed estimates of
climate change for Great Britain based on the use of four scenarios of GHGs
emissions reduction (only CO2 has been considered) for the period 1990–2100:
IS92 (uncontrolled increase of emissions without their reduction); KYOTO (a 5.2 %
reduction of emissions by the year 2010 compared to 1990 by the “ﬁrst list”
countries, that is, industrial countries, with subsequently stabilized emissions (other
countries follow the “trajectory” of IS92); KYOTO+ (after 2010, the “ﬁrst list”
countries continue to reduce emissions by 1 % per year; for other countries—IS92);
KYOTO++ (the same as KYOTO+ for the “ﬁrst list” countries; after 2020, other
countries reduce emissions by 1 % per year). The MINUS-60 scenario of global
CO2 reduction by 60 % by the year 2010 has been considered, too.
Data in Table 5.2 illustrate the estimates of respective changes (increase) of the
annual mean SAT in Great Britain (in these calculations the impact of atmospheric
aerosol was left out of account). As it is seen, all discussed measures on CO2
emissions reduction provide only a negligible restraining of climate warming. This
means a necessity to pay a much more serious attention to development of the
strategy of adaptation to climate change.
McBean (1998) emphasized that though in the context of FCCC the emphasis
has been placed on the problem of GHGs emissions reduction, clause 4 of FCCC
foresees also the necessity:
(1) to support efforts (scientiﬁc, technological, technical, socio-economic) in the
interests of further scientiﬁc developments, systematic observations and cre-
ation of the climate data archive, bearing in mind to get a better understanding
of the causes of climate change and its socio-economic consequences;

(2) to provide an exchange of the respective scientiﬁc, technological, technical,
socio-economic, and juridical information to substantiate the strategies of
responding to climate change; and
(3) to intensify measures on development of education, improvement of qualiﬁ-
cation, and informing the population about climate change.
At the Intergovernmental meeting on WCP held in April 1993, a decision was
made on the expedience of complex development on climate problems which was
called Climate Agenda (CA) aimed at providing a more efﬁcient coordination of
respective efforts. The CA supported by WMO, UNEP, ICSU, UNESCO, FAO,
WHO was concentrated on four directions:
(1) Prospects of development of science of climate, and weather forecast.
(2) Climate services needed to ensure sustainable development.
(3) Study of climatic forcings and development of strategies of responding to the
forcings to minimize their consequences.
(4) Adequately planned observations of the climate system.
For the organized realization of the CA, the Interdisciplinary Committee on
Climate Agenda (IACCA) was formed in March 1999 in Paris as a result of a
substantial reorganization of the Coordination Committee on CA.
According to the adopted agreement, scientiﬁc developments are the sphere of
responsibility of WCRP, whereas IPCC answers for negotiations and recommen-
dations of the needed environmental policy. Efforts have been performed on the
basis of a close cooperation between WCRP and IPCC, though not without some
problems consisting, ﬁrst of all, in underestimation by politicians of the signiﬁcance
of the problem of improving the observation means and in insufﬁcient understanding
by scientiﬁc community of speciﬁc character of information needed for politicians.
As Bolin (1998, 1999) has noted, in the context of the latter, the most important
conclusion of the Second IPCC-1995 Report consisted in that “the balance of
evidence supposes a marked impact of man on global climate”, though on the other
hand, it was noted that “our ability to quantitatively estimate the impact of man on
global climate is now limited, since the expected signal appears just now at the
background of natural variability as well as in view of available uncertainties (in
estimates) of key factors”. Such conclusions have been mainly supported by sci-
entiﬁc community and stimulated further developments, the results of which have
been generalized in the Third IPCC-2001 Report.
In this connection, Bolin (1998, 1999) emphasized that “negotiations between
countries that have ratiﬁed the FCCC, have shown that substantial political actions are
scarcely probable, if the impact of humans’ activity on global climate is not proved”.
The absence of the needed understanding of the impact of climate on humans and
ecosystems has determined the resistance of some countries to measures on limitation
of the anthropogenic impact on climate. An important aspect of the problem is
groundless statements of the “green” about the growth of the frequency of extreme
natural phenomena such as storms, tropical cyclones, ﬂoods, and others. This question
requires, however, further thorough analysis (Grigoryev and Kondratyev 2001).

Ecoinformatics Problems of Global Climate Change

One of the key unresolved problems is the forecast of development of energy
production, increase of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, and, respectively,
radiative forcing (RF). According to the Special IPCC-1994 Report, various sce-
narios determine a possible increase of CO2 emissions by 2,100 within 2–60 GtC
(compared to the current value 7.5 GtC), that is, the obtained estimates differ by a
factor of 30 (with the use of all coal and natural gas resources known, the con-
centration of CO2 can increase to 450 ppm).
Data in Table 5.3 illustrate possible changes of RF at different levels of CO2
concentration stabilization in the atmosphere (the key unresolved problems consist,
however, in that what level of stabilization can be considered acceptable). In this
connection, special attention should be ﬁxed on further development of global
carbon cycle studies, especially bearing in mind the unresolved problem of the “lost
sink”, which is partially determined, apparently, by the functioning of land eco-
systems as CO2 sinks (on the whole, the role of the biospheric dynamics in the
formation of carbon cycle is far from being clear). Quite urgent (but also very
complicated) is the modeling of the nature-society interaction with long-term non-
linear changes of climate system taken into account. The concept of the risk as
applied to the problem of climate change moves up to the foreground.
As follows from the above-said and a huge amount of publications on the key
aspects of climate, one of the sufﬁciently problematic tasks is a regulation at sci-
entiﬁc, economic, and political levels of the problem brought forth by the Kyoto
Protocol. Perhaps, Barenbaum (2002, 2004) and Syvorotkin (2002) were ﬁrst who
formulated its reconciliatory solution, practically explained the mechanisms of
closing global carbon cycle, and demonstrated its correlation with the cycles of
other GHGs and water. Semenov (2004) pointed to the important role of the phase
transitions of water, especially between liquid and solid ones. Masses of ice and
permafrost are buffers of temperature changes, playing the role of the climate-
forming function. Based on the model calculations, Semenov (2004) analyzed the
impact of climate change on the vertical distribution of temperature under condi-
tions of permafrost and determined the laws of the deep seasonal melting of the
continental permafrost with the growing greenhouse effect. The main conclusion is
that the vertical heat transfer and water phase transitions in the surface layer of the
northern-latitude lithosphere are climatic stabilizers.

General Problems of Global Climate Dynamics

As has been mentioned above, the prevailing “anthropogenic” concept of global
climate change is based on information on the secular change of the annual mean
global mean SAT that was calculated from the data of observations at the land
meteorological networks and ship observations of water temperature in the upper
layer of the World Ocean, as well as numerical modeling of SAT change during the
last one and a half century. Meanwhile, there is no doubt that the information
content of the notion of global mean SAT needs further analysis, and being cal-
culated from the data of observations, the SAT values are not only aggravated with
errors which are difﬁcult to estimate, but also are insufﬁciently representative. On
the other hand, it is obviously that reliable results concerning climatic variability
can be obtained only by considering the 3D air temperature ﬁelds and other climatic
parameters, that is, by analysis of climate variability on regional scales. In this
connection, substantiation of strategies of national and regional studies becomes
especially urgent.
The World Climate Conference (Moscow, 29 September–3 October 2003) has
stimulated the publication of a number of summarizing papers on the current studies
of global climate dynamics (Demirchian and Kondratyev 2004; Kondratyev and
Krapivin 2004a, b) with due regard to the earlier results (Kondratyev 1982;
Kondratyev and Moskalenko 1984; Kondratyev and Johannessen 1993). The
related key conclusion consists in establishing the presence of serious uncertainties
in results in the ﬁelds of both empirical diagnostics and numerical climate
modeling. Of exclusive importance becomes adequate substantiation and efﬁcient
realization of further developments in order to reduce the level of existing uncer-
tainties and to assess the reliability of global climate forecasts.
Planning of further efforts in the ﬁeld of global climate studies should be based
on the two international programmes: WCRP and IGBP. A new programme
COPES (Coordinated Observations and Prediction of the Earth System) approved
by the WCRP Joint Scientiﬁc Committee is aimed at substantiation of a new
strategy and goals of WCRP for the period 2005–2015 (COPES 2004), the
beginning of which coincides with the 25th anniversary of WCRP. As it is known,
two main goals of WCRP consist in assessing of the climate predictability and the
degree of anthropogenic impact on climate. Achievement of these goals should be
based on accomplishing the interdisciplinary studies of the climatic system
“atmosphere-hydrosphere-lithosphere-cryosphere-biosphere” inﬂuenced by various
external factors (including anthropogenic). Such studies should foresee, in
particular:
• observations of changes taking place in the climate system;
• better understanding of the climate variability (mechanisms that determine this
variability) on regional scales;
• assessment of substantial trends of regional and global climates;
• development of numerical modeling methods able to simulate the spatial-tem-
poral variability in a wide range of scales and useful for operational predictions;
• study of the climate system’s sensitivity to natural and anthropogenic forcings,
quantitative assessment of contributions of various forcings;
370
5
Ecoinformatics Problems of Global Climate Change

• analysis of the nature and predictability of the annual change and interannual
variability of the climate system on regional and global scales to create the
scientiﬁc basis for operational predictions of climatic variability in the interests
of sustainable development; and
• detection of climate change and recognition of its causes (especially of
anthropogenic origin) in the context of the UN Framework Convention on
Climate Change (FCCC) and developments of IPCC.
The 25th anniversary of WCRP is one of the stimuli to summarize the main
results and substantiate the perspectives of further developments in connection with
an appearance of new possibilities and advancements which include the solution of
complex interdisciplinary problems such as:
(a) Forecasting the climate system’s dynamics on time scales of weeks—seasons—
years—decades—centuries considering possibilities of climate forecast for
centuries with the use of initial data for observed numerous parameters char-
acterizing the state of the climate system. Solution of the respective problems
requires not only radical improvement of the existing means of numerical cli-
mate modeling but, ﬁrst of all, adequate substantiation of requirements to
observational data and substantial development of the global observational
system (these questions have been discussed in detail elsewhere (Kondratyev
1998a, b; Kondratyev and Cracknell 1998).
(b) Development of methods for numerical modeling of global ecodynamics and—
in this context—climate dynamics with due regard to interactive chemical
processes, formation of global carbon cycle, land and ocean ecosystem
dynamics (Kondratyev and Krapivin 2003a, b; Kondratyev et al. 2003a, b, c, d).
In other words, the problem of global climate change should be considered as an
interactive component of global changes. One should also emphasize the sig-
niﬁcance of the problems of risk connected with natural and anthropogenic
catastrophes (Kondratyev et al. 2006a, b), as well as unexpected “turns” in the
evolution of the global biosphere. The latter are illustrated by new (and
demanding further thorough investigation) supposition about an important role
of the ﬁne structure of the spectrum of solar radiation
(determined by the
presence of Fraunhofer lines) in evolution of the biosphere and, in particular, in
development of immunodeﬁciency (Kondratyev et al. 2004a, b).
(c) Analysis of signiﬁcance of an adequate understanding and reliable climate
forecasts from the viewpoint of provision of sustainable development (the
urgency of this problem has become especially acute in connection with the
ratiﬁcation of the KP by Russia and, thus, its coming into effect).
These general goals can be achieved only by means of an efﬁcient coordination
of efforts within international programmes such as WCRP, IGBP, IHDP (socio-
economic aspects of global change), DIVERSITAS (International Biodiversity
Programme), and others.
The main goal of the present stage of the WCRP development is an adequate
(well coordinated) solution of the problems of obtaining needed observational data,
5.2
General Problems of Global Climate Dynamics

a deeper understanding of the laws of the climate system, and provision of reliable
forecast of its dynamics. This strategy planned for the period 2005–2015 should be
realized within the COPES programme, based on accomplishment of the projects
included into WCRP and directed at the following problems of development
(COPES 2004):
(1)
Determination of possibility and assessment of expected reliability of the
seasonal forecasts of climate for all regions of the globe with the use of
available climate models and observation data, as well as more adequate
information
with
further
development
of
models
and
systems
of
observations.
(2)
Further development and test of adequacy of the ensemble forecasts of
natural and anthropogenic variability of climate.
(3)
Scientiﬁc substantiation and analysis of adequacy of methods of regional
climate forecasts on different temporal scales.
(4)
Development of reliably veriﬁed models of climate dynamics with chemical
processes taken into account.
(5)
Realistic numerical modeling of the glacier-interglacier cycles with the use of
general circulation models.
(6)
Shortening of the intervals of uncertainties of the estimates of sensitivity of
numerical climate modeling results to external forcings.
(7)
Improvement of numerical modeling of arid climates and analysis of their
reliability.
(8)
Improvement of numerical modeling of monsoon climates and analysis of
their reliability.
(9)
Cooperation with IPCC WG-1 in the interests of preparation of AR4 Fourth
IPCC Report on climate problems.
(10)
Analysis of reasons why, how, and where the modes of climate variability
change in response to anthropogenic forcings, and affects of such processes
on the long-term climatic variability.
(11)
Assessment of predictability of intraseasonal climate changes based on the
use of interactive models.
(12)
Determination of spatial-temporal scales of predictability of temperature,
salinity, and general circulation of the ocean.
(13)
Speciﬁcation of forecasts of anthropogenic rise of the World Ocean level.
(14)
Support to efforts on re-analysis of data on variability of the climate system’s
components.
This enumeration is far from being complete, and this clearly follows from
information discussed in recent overviews (Kondratyev 2004a, b; Kondratyev et al.
2003a, b, c, d). As it has been mentioned, one of the important problems of COPES
consists in analysis of the information content of the data of observations of various
climatic parameters from the viewpoint of evaluation of contribution of these data,
to the increase of reliability of climate forecasts on different spatial-temporal scales.
Resolving of problems connected with this aspect of COPES, will require coordi-
nated efforts on collection, accumulation, and re-analysis of the climatological
372

information in order to obtain an internally coordinated (dynamically balanced)
structure ensuring an adequate simulation of variability of the climate system in the
interests of climate forecast. Naturally, ﬁrst steps in this direction should consist in
substantiation of an adequate global observational system and detailed requirements
to observation data (these problems are far from being resolved). One of the related
steps was an accomplishment of the COPES project of coordinated frequented
observations in 2002–2004 within the sub-programme of the experiment on study
of global energy and water cycles (GEWEX) as part of WCRP, the key questions of
which were (COPES 2004):
• Do variations of the rate of water cycle take place due to climate change?
• To what degree do local weather changes result from anthropogenic (or natural)
global climate change?
• Is it possible to forecast precipitation on spatial-temporal scales determined by
requirements connected with solving of applied problems?
• How can the total impact of processes determining water cycle be taken into
account (parameterized) in weather forecasts and climate models?
A new stage of the GEWEX programme is connected with accomplishment of a
complete global description of water and energy cycles, as well as the development
of improved forecasts of precipitation and water cycle variability (with due regard
to natural and anthropogenic climate changes), bearing in mind resolution of var-
ious practical problems, especially those concerning water resources. As Lawford
(2004) pointed out, the following items are playing an increased role: the use of
space-borne observational means such as an experimental satellite CloudSat for
radar measurements of the vertical structure of clouds and their properties; the
system of polar-orbiting environmental satellites (NPOESS); means of remote
sensing of soil moisture and ocean water salinity (SMOS); programme to study the
state of the hydrosphere (Hydros) with the global survey of changes of soil moisture
and conditions of surface permafrost melting and global precipitation measurement
(GPM). The Integrated Global Observing Strategy (IGOS) planned for 10 years and
combined systems of global Earth observations (GEOSS) favour the coordination
of such developments. Within the programme of partnership IGOS (IGOS-P) plans
are being made to create observational systems with the use of routine (in-situ) and
satellite observational means. In this connection, the problem-oriented special
complex ﬁeld experiments such as CEOP (Koike 2004) aimed mainly at studies of
global water cycle should play a special role.
The main goal of CEOP project started in October 2002 and completed by the
end of 2004 was to assess the impact of the sources and sinks of heat and moisture
on land on the global climate formation. The CEOP was considered as a pilot
project in accomplishing global observations of water cycle within the partnership
in strategy of global observations (IGOS-P) (Wanders et al. 2012).
Another important observational component of GEWEX and CLIVAR (pro-
grammes of climate studies) is the project of multi-disciplinary analysis of the
African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA), which is a continuation of
the project CATCH to study the tropical atmosphere and water cycle interaction.
5.2
General Problems of Global Climate Dynamics
373

AMMA has two phases: (1) 2002–2010 and (2) 2010–2020 (http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/
view/badc.nerc.ac.uk__ATOM__dataent_amma). AMMA is an international pro-
ject to improve our knowledge and understanding of the West African Monsoon
(WAM) and its variability. AMMA is motivated by an interest in fundamental
scientiﬁc issues and by the societal need for improved prediction of the West
African Monsoon and its impacts on West African nations. The societal need to
develop strategies that reduce the socioeconomic impacts of the variability of the
West African Monsoon forces the AMMA will facilitate the multidisciplinary
research required to provide improved predictions of the WAM and its impacts.
AMMA promotes international coordination of ongoing activities, basic research
and a multi-year campaign over West Africa and the tropical Atlantic. AMMA
develops close partnerships between those involved in basic research of the West
African Monsoon, operational forecasting and decision making, and it will establish
blended training and education activities for African technical institutions and
schools.
The observational programs of special importance include the Third Interna-
tional Polar Year (IPY) planned for 2007–2009 with coordination carried out by the
scientiﬁc enterprising group CliC on the problems of climate and cryosphere. First
IPY was realized in 1932–1933 and second IPY occurred 75 years after the ﬁrst
IPY (1957–1958). The latest IPY brought about the most ambitious Arctic climate
change research project ever undertaken in Canada, a CAD research program called
the Circumpolar Flaw Lead (CFL) System Study. Led by University of Manitoba
Professor David Barber, a Canada Research Chair, the project involved more than
300 scientists from 16 countries, including over 40 faculty members, research
associates, graduate students, technicians and support staff from the University of
Manitoba.
The THORPEX program should be more informative and longer-term. This
international programme of atmospheric studies planned for 10 years is carried out
under aegis of the WMO Commission on Atmospheric Sciences and is a part of the
World Weather Research Programme (WWRP). The main goal of the programme is
to work out methods of weather prediction (especially its manifestations which
especially strongly affect humans’ life and economic activity) with an adequate use
of the data of conventional and satellite observations. The THORPEX should
culminate in a 1-year global meteorological experiment during the period 2010–
2015. The fundamental problem of exclusive importance is the development of a
full-scale system of global climate observations (GCOS) to obtain long and
homogeneous series of high-quality data on the climate system parameters, bearing
in mind the solution of the following set of problems (Steffen et al. 2004):
• Climate monitoring for quantitative estimates of natural climate change in a
wide range of spatial-temporal scales and for recognition of anthropogenic
climate change.
• Detection and quantitative estimates of various (especially anthropogenic)
factors of climate change.
374
5
Ecoinformatics Problems of Global Climate Change

• Diagnostic analysis to get a deeper understanding of the dynamics of climate
system and its components, including evaluation of contributions of natural
climate change.
• Development and analysis of reliability of various hypotheses on the factors of
climatic variability on different spatial-temporal scales, as well as assessment of
climate predictability.
• Studies of various climate-forming dynamic, physical, chemical, and biological
processes with their interactivity taken into account.
• Further improvement of climate models for climate forecasts on time scales
from inter-seasonal to inter-annual variability.
The latter problem is especially urgent: despite serious achievements in devel-
opment of methods of numerical climate modeling, the current climate models are
still inadequate. This concerns, ﬁrst of all, consideration (parameterization) of
chemical and biological processes in the climate system. Still unresolved funda-
mental problems of climate theory include:
• interactive numerical modeling of climate and carbon cycle (Cracknell et al.
2009; Kondratyev and Krapivin 2004a; Kondratyev et al. 2003c);
• consideration of biospheric dynamics including continental and marine eco-
systems in this context of importance, is the concept of biotic regulation of the
environment (Kondratyev et al. 2003d, e); and
• parameterization of chemical processes in the troposphere and stratosphere,
simulation of paleoclimate dynamics (Lohmann and Sirocko 2004; Lohmann
et al. 2004; Mikolajewicz et al. 2004; Schneider et al. 2004; Sirocko et al. 2004),
etc.
The analysis of adequacy of the numerical modeling results by comparing with
observational data is of decisive importance. The problem of primary importance is
the development of approaches to NSS numerical modeling. This will require an
accomplishment of an efﬁcient coordination of efforts within four main international
programmes: WCRP, IGBP, IHDP, and DIVERSITAS. In this connection, one
should mention a timely appearance in IGBP of the programme AIMES (analysis,
integration, and numerical modeling of the Earth system). The challenge for
AIMES is to achieve a deeper and more quantitative understanding of the role of
human perturbations to the Earth’s biogeochemical cycles and their interactions
with the coupled physical climate system. AIMES will focus on:
• The functioning of global biogeochemical cycles, including interactions and
feedbacks with the physical climate system;
• The interplay between human activities and biogeochemical cycles, both in the
past and into the future;
• How the biogeochemical cycles function on different time scales.
The program of future climate studies is connected, ﬁrst of all, with the WCRP
perspectives based mainly on results obtained in the course of completed pro-
grammes, such as TOGA (study of Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere:
5.2
General Problems of Global Climate Dynamics
375

1985–1994); WOCE (World Ocean Circulation Experiment: 1982–2002); ACSYS
(study of the Arctic climate: 1994–2003). The scientiﬁc goal of the WCRP’s Arctic
Climate System Study (ACSYS) project is to ascertain the role of the Arctic in
global climate by attempting to ﬁnd answers to the following related questions
(Lemke and Jacobi 2012):
• What are the global consequences of natural or human-induced change in the
Arctic climate system?
• Is the Arctic climate system as sensitive to increased greenhouse gas concen-
trations as climate models suggest?
Problems of TOGA and WOCE will be continued within the project CLIVAR to
study the climate variability on time scales from seasons (with emphasis on the
problem of monsoons) to centuries (in this case, detection and assessment of
anthropogenic impacts on climate will play a key role), the main goals of which are:
• Description and understanding of physical processes responsible for variability
and predictability of climate on seasonal, inter-annual, decadal, and centennial
scales based on the use of available observations data and interactive models of
climate system.
• Use of paleoclimatic information for a better understanding of present (and
possibly future) climate change.
• Development of methods to forecast climate change on scales from seasonal to
inter-annual based on the use of global interactive prognostic models.
• Understanding and prediction of the climate system’s response to increasing
concentrations of MGCs and aerosol, as well as subsequent comparison of
numerical modeling results with observational data with emphasis on separation
of anthropogenic changes from natural climate “signals”.
An accomplishment of the CLIVAR project should answer the following
questions, in particular:
• Will El Niño take place next year?
• What climate will be in Asia next summer and will the next monsoon bring
droughts or ﬂoods?
• What will be the next winter in Northern Europe: “warm and wet” or “cold and
dry”?
• What is the global climate warming due to anthropogenic impacts?
• How high can be the World Ocean level in the 21st century?
• Will the global climate warming cause an increase of the frequency of extreme
weather
phenomena
and
will
these
phenomena
intensify
and
become
widespread?
• Are sudden climate changes possible?
As has been mentioned, studies of global systems of monsoons are of primary
importance for CLIVAR. This has been favoured by the successful accomplishment
of the ﬁeld experiment SALLJEX on studies of the south-American jet stream in the
troposphere, which was part of a wider project VAMOS (Wood et al. 2011) to
376

analyze the variability of the system of American monsoons. Also of great
importance are studies of the role of processes in the ocean in climate formation,
including problems such as variability of thermohaline circulation in the Atlantic
Ocean; dynamics and predictability of the intra-tropical convergence zone in the
Atlantic Ocean and its impact on regional climate; atmospheric forcings, their
connection with processes in the upper layer of the ocean and feedbacks with SAT,
including an assessment of the role of Kuroshio Current; and upwelling in the
Paciﬁc Ocean. In this connection, close attention is devoted to improvement of the
observational network in cooperation with GCOS (Global Climate Observation
System) and GOOS (Global Ocean Observation System).
An important place in the WCRP programme is occupied, as before, by the project
SPARC, the main goal of which is to study the climatic impact of the stratosphere,
taking into account interactive chemical, dynamic, and radiative processes that
control the atmospheric circulation in the stratosphere and its chemical composition,
including the ozone content whose changes determine variations of the UV solar
radiation that reaches the Earth’s surface (Kondratyev and Varotsos 1996, 2000;
Wauben et al. 1997). A substantial task of SPARC is recognition and quantitative
description of the long-term trends of the water vapour and ozone content in the
stratosphere, as well as temperature. The beginning of the second decade of the
SPARC functioning has been marked by close attention to such problems as
stratosphere-troposphere interaction (parameterization of the stratosphere in climate
models), interactive impact of chemical processes on climate, stratospheric indicators
of climate change, various aspects of the problems of assimilation of the data of
observations of stratospheric parameters. Creation of new models of the stratosphere
has opened up possibilities to reliably simulate the dynamics of the “ozone hole” in
the polar stratosphere. By the end of 2004, the estimation of the stratospheric aerosol
dynamics was completed, and a new initiative is to study the processes of formation
and evolution of polar stratospheric clouds.
General SPARC themes and activities address areas of societal concern such as:
• Climate variability and change. A central issue within SPARC is the impact of
changing atmospheric composition on circulation and weather, from increasing
surface temperatures to severe weather events and rising sea-levels. The
stratosphere represents a signiﬁcant source of variability and internal memory of
the climate system.
• Ozone. Ozone and the ozone layer are of major concern to life on Earth. SPARC
provides key scientiﬁc support to the WMO/UNEP Ozone Assessments that are
produced every 4 years in accordance with the mandate of the signatories of the
Montreal Protocol.
• Atmospheric chemistry and aerosols. Atmospheric chemistry is a cornerstone
for understanding the evolution of the climate system. The effect of greenhouse
gases (GHGs) and ozone depleting substances (ODSs) has been to warm the
Earth’s surface, while cooling the stratosphere. SPARC has been actively
involved in advancing our understanding of the chemical processes that affect
climate.
5.2
General Problems of Global Climate Dynamics
377

• Polar processes. Melting ice sheets and shrinking sea-ice extent and thickness
greatly affect not only the polar areas, but coastal regions all over the globe.
SPARC is teaming up with other interested research institutes to bring its
expertise to bear on scientiﬁc issues speciﬁc to the polar areas.
The project CliC, being a continuation and development of the programme
CCSS, is directed at further studies of the impact of processes in the Arctic on the
global climate formation. The related problems include: determination of the role of
the Arctic Ocean waters and ice cover dynamics as factors of strong changes of the
arctic climate; study of sensitivity of the arctic climate system to the growing
concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere. The urgency of these and other problems
is determined, in particular, by obtaining new data of observations, demonstrating
substantial changes of the global cryosphere, including:
• a small extent of multi-year arctic ice cover (with minimum values in September
2002 and in 2003);
• intensive melting of Greenland glaciers from the beginning of satellite obser-
vations in 1980 (note that according to the latest radio-altimeter data, the coastal
parts of glaciers have been melting, whereas in the centre of ice cover there was
an accumulation of ice); and
• destruction of the ice shelf Larsen B in the region of Western Antarctic in 2002;
accelerated melting of mountain glaciers on all continents.
One of the important tasks of CliC is to study possible additional GHGs emissions
to the atmosphere in permafrost melting (Fig. 5.2). It is known that permafrost, as a
critical part of the Earth’s climate system, covers 24 % of the land in the northern
hemisphere. It also stores approximately 1.5 trillion tons of carbon—twice the
amount of carbon currently in the atmosphere. The permafrost carbon feedback is not
present in the global climate change models used to estimate how warm the earth
could get over the next century. As a result of climate change, permafrost is at risk of
melting, releasing the stored carbon in the form of carbon dioxide and methane. As it
follows from Fig. 5.2, permafrost structure is not uniform and depends on the land
covers. Therefore, a creation of permafrost database with spatial distribution of its
characteristics is principal stage of climate modeling processes.
An important circumstance is the impossibility of reliable short-range and long-
range climate forecasts without an adequate consideration of cryospheric processes
(Kondratyev and Johannessen 1993; Marshall 2011; Vallis and Thoumi 2012; Kerr
2000). This concerns, in particular, the solution of an important problem, such as
forecast of possible rise of the World Ocean level under conditions of global
climate warming. Some other global aspects of CliC include studies of: thermo-
haline circulation (fresh water inﬂow to the North Atlantic); snow and ice covers;
reliable methods of taking into account the permafrost and ice cover dynamics in
climate models; changes of solid precipitation with the use of new methods of
observations.

In addition to above, permafrost is structurally important, and its melting has
been known to cause erosion, disappearance of lakes, landslides, and ground
subsidence. It will also cause changes in plant species composition at high latitudes.
Thawing permafrost has signiﬁcant effects on surface and subsurface regimes,
including those governing hydrology and energy and moisture balance. Ecosystem
diversity, composition, and productivity are not only impacted by increasing air
temperatures, but by the associated effects of increasing ground temperatures as
well. Because of this, thawing permafrost has signiﬁcant impacts on infrastructure
and ecosystems. Where ground ice contents are comparatively high, permafrost
degradation can have signiﬁcant impacts (Turetsky et al. 2007).
The international IPAB programme of observations using the instruments
mounted on sea buoys in the SH oceans started really in 1995 under aegis of
WCRP, and deserves further support. IPAB is a self-sustaining project of the
WCRP, and provides a link between institutions with Antarctic and Southern Ocean
interests. IPAB was formally established, following a 1 year pilot phase, at a
meeting in Helsinki, Finland in June 1994. IPAB aims to establish and maintain a
network of drifting buoys in the Antarctic sea-ice zone, which monitor ice motion,
pressure and temperature. The IPAB Antarctic Drifting Buoy Data archive, pres-
ently spanning the years 1995–1998, includes measurements of buoy position,
atmospheric pressure, air temperature, and sea surface temperature. Data are
organized by daily and 3-h averages and the raw, instantaneous, non-interpolated
data values. Data were collected from buoys initially deployed in three study

regions: East Antarctica; the Weddell Sea; and the Bellingshausen, Amundsen, and
Ross Seas (Heil and Allison 1999; WMO 2000).
First of all, it is important to perceive the fact that the discussed climate problems
can be solved only on the basis of a complex study of interactions of all major
climate system components. Moreover, the climate problem should be considered
as a part of a much more general and extremely difﬁcult problem of study and
simulation of NSS dynamics. This approach is based and has been constructively
realized in some recent publications (Krapivin and Varotsos 2007, 2008; Krapivin
and Shutko 2012). Unfortunately, such developments within WCRP and related
projects are still (in the context under discussion) deprived of the needed systematic
and constructive character.
As for some aspects of IGBP (and ﬁrst of all, in the context of COPES), the
following problems, in particular, need further consideration and more convincing
substantiation:
1. Adequacy of available observational database from the viewpoint of its
completeness and reliability.
As an example illustrating the urgency of such problems, one can refer to the
data on mean annual mean global SAT. As Essex and McKitrick (2002) have justly
noted, even deﬁnition and meaning of this notion have not been clearly substan-
tiated, though it is these data on mean global SAT for the last 1.5 century that have
formed the basis of the most important conclusions about the nature of present
climate change and various practical recommendations (including the KP). Of no
less importance is the fact that the global mean SAT is the product of averaging
with the use of rather fragmentary information (especially it refers to the late 19th to
early 20th century), consisting of a combination of the data of air temperature
observations on land (the problem of ﬁltering out the contribution of the urban “heat
islands” from observations at meteorological stations has not been adequately
solved as yet) and results of ship observations of water temperature in the upper
layer of the ocean, methodically complicated and far from being representative. One
of the convincing illustrations of discrepancy (and insufﬁcient reliability) of
available meteorological information is a heated discussion on principally important
differences between the data on SAT trends and results of tropospheric temperature
retrieval from the data of satellite microwave observations (Kondratyev 2004a, b;
Christy and Spencer 2003). One more illustration is unreliable manifestation of the
so-called “hockey stick” (a sharp increase of mean global SAT for the last decades
at the background of a weak variability during the previous millennium, which
excludes, in particular, phenomena such as “Little Ice Age” which is of principal
importance for characteristic of the global warming (McIntyre and McKitrick
2003). On the one hand, it means a necessity to continue analysis of reliability of
information on global mean SAT values (there is no doubt that the “orthodox”
estimation of global warming 0.6 ± 0.2 °C is conditional). On the other hand, there
is an acute need of substantiation of a single global system of climate observations
in the context of global change.
As for the latter circumstance, at ﬁrst sight, the situation is quite safe: during the
last years, some programs have been developed, such as GCOS, GOOS, GTOS
380
5
Ecoinformatics Problems of Global Climate Change

(global system of land surface observations), IGOS (Integral Global Observational
System), and others. In fact, a single global observational system is needed in the
interests of NSS dynamics monitoring, containing the problem-oriented units based
on substantiation of priorities. The most important aspect of substantiation of such a
system is an optimization of relationship between the use of conventional and
satellite observational means. In this connection, there is no doubt that multi-billion
expenditures on creation of the EOS system consisting of three satellites equipped
with complexes of the most up-to-date instrumentation have turned out to be not
properly justiﬁed (Goody 2002).
2. The role of biospheric dynamics as an interactive component of climate
system.
The fact of biotic regulation of the environment still has not been acknowledged
(Kondratyev et al. 2003d, 2004b), though the Amsterdam Declaration reﬂects a
substantial progress achieved in this direction. The ﬁrst step in this direction should
be an interactive consideration of global carbon cycle instead of a-priori prescrip-
tion of arbitrary scenarios of changes of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere
(Krapivin and Varotsos 2008).
3. Greenhouse effect.
With tremendous importance attached to anthropogenic changes of the atmo-
spheric greenhouse effect as the most important climate-forming factors, the
absence in the COPES programme of a section specially dedicated to these prob-
lems seems a paradox. Therefore, some contradictory opinions appear about the
contributions of various components of the greenhouse effect to the formation of
global climate. So, for instance, Hansen et al. (2002) believe (though one should
note that opinions of this group of specialists sometimes suffer sudden changes),
that since there is an approximate mutual compensation of RF of different signs due
to carbon dioxide and aerosol, the consideration of contribution to the atmospheric
greenhouse effect enhancement, determined by the growth of methane concentra-
tion, is of major importance for the prognostic RF values. On the whole, it is
necessary to take into consideration all GHGs effects and to take into account the
speciﬁc characteristics of water vapors, methane, ozone, carbon dioxide, nitrous
oxide, etc.
4. Atmospheric aerosol and clouds.
In view of a more important role of atmospheric aerosol and clouds in the RF
formation (and, hence, climate change) compared to MGCs, the respective prob-
lems should attract much more serious attention (Kondratyev 2005). It means, in
particular, a necessity of the aerosol-cloud sector in the COPES programme. The
same refers to the problems of “atmospheric ozone (both stratospheric and tropo-
spheric) and climate” (Braesicke and Pyle 2004; Kondratyev and Varotsos 2000;
Friedrich 2001).
The basic conclusion made by Kondratyev et al. (2006a) about the mechanisms
of formation and properties of atmospheric aerosols is that existing climate models
are still far from being adequate. This situation is especially substantial in the
context of consideration of aerosol as one of the most important climate-forming
factors. On the one hand, it is obvious that an interactive consideration of aerosol,
5.2
General Problems of Global Climate Dynamics
381

such as a climate-forming atmospheric component, is needed, and on the other
hand, there is no doubt that the still highly uncertain data on the global spatial-
temporal variability of aerosol properties and mechanisms of formation do not
permit an adequate parameterization of the aerosol dynamics in climate models,
where the most them predict only a few general trends.
5. Natural disasters.
The problems of risk and natural disasters are of special importance in the
context of analysis of the role of non-linear dynamics of climate system, as a factor
of sudden and strong climate change in reaching certain threshold levels of forcing.
Knutson et al. (2010) discuss the problem concerning the existence of correlation
between climate change and tropical cyclogenesis processes. Unfortunately, the
historical data do not conﬁrm the presence of such correlation with high reliability.
However, the existing climate models show the presence of globally averaged
increase in the tropical cyclone intensities to 2100 by 2–11 %, under the reduction
of their frequency by 6–34 %.
6. Solar radiation.
Still neglected in “orthodox” climate studies, solar radiation is an important
problem of possible impacts of solar activity on climate, via various mechanisms of
formation of positive feedbacks with solar activity-induced changes of the content
of some MGCs in the atmosphere (in particular, nitrogen dioxide) and cloud cover
properties (Douglass et al. 2004). In this connection, the work of Solanki et al.
(2004) deserves attention. They detected a strong anomaly of solar activity during
the last decades, compared to its quieter level during the preceding 11,000 years.
Thus, the main conclusion is that further serious efforts are needed to substan-
tiate a new strategy of global climate studies. However, it is important to remark
that this strategy cannot be realized adequately without more precise account of the
problem of nature-society interaction (Krapivin and Varotsos 2007, 2008).
5.3 Empirical Diagnostics of the Global Climate
5.3.1 Introduction
The main cause of contradictions in studies of the present climate and its changes,
represents the inadequacy of the available observational databases. They remain
incomplete and of poor quality. In this connection, Mohr and Bridge (2003) have
carried out a thorough analysis of evolution of the global observing system. As it is
well known, climate is characterized by many parameters, such as air temperature
and humidity near the Earth surface and in the free atmosphere; precipitation (liquid
or solid); amount of cloud cover and the height of its lower and upper boundaries,
microphysical and optical properties of clouds; radiation budget and its compo-
nents; microphysical and optical parameters of atmospheric aerosols; atmospheric
chemical composition, and more. However, the empirical analysis of climatic data
is usually limited by the results of SAT observations, with data series available for
382
5
Ecoinformatics Problems of Global Climate Change

no more than 100–150 years. Even these data series are heterogeneous, especially
with regard to the global database as the main source of information for proving
evidence for global warming idea. Also, it should be borne in mind that the globally
averaged secular trend of SAT values is based, to a large extent, on the use of
imperfect observed data of sea surface temperature (SST).
The most important (and controversial) conclusion concerning the anthropogenic
nature of present day climate change is based on the analysis of the SAT and SST
combined data, that is on the secular trend of mean global average annual surface
temperature (GST). There exist both positive and negative anomalies of the GST
that indicate the observed temperature deviation from the reference value. In this
connection, two questions arise:
(1) about the information content of the notion of GST (this problem was for-
mulated by Essex and McKitrick (2002); and
(2) about the reliability of GST values determined, in particular, by fragmentary
data for the Southern Hemisphere, as well as the still unresolved problem of
urban “heat islands”.
An urban heat island (UHI) is a metropolitan area that is signiﬁcantly warmer
than its surrounding rural areas due to human activities. The phenomenon was ﬁrst
investigated and described by Luke Howard in the 1810s, although he was not the
one to name the phenomenon (Howard 1820). The temperature difference is usually
larger at night than during the day, and is most apparent when winds are weak.
Seasonally, UHI is seen during both summer and winter. The main cause of the
urban heat island is the modiﬁcation of the land surface by urban development,
which uses materials which effectively retain heat. Waste heat generated by energy
usage is a secondary contributor (Li and Zhao 2012). As a population center grows,
it tends to expand its area, and increase in its average temperature. The less-used
term heat island refers to any area, populated or not, which is consistently hotter
than the surrounding area.
Studies on the reliability of the SAT observations are continuing from the per-
spective of observational techniques. For more than 100 years, SAT was measured
with the glass thermometers, but now arrangements to protect the thermometers
from direct solar radiation and wind have been repeatedly changed. This dictates a
necessity for ﬁltering out SAT data to provide homogeneous data series. In the
period from April till August 2000 at the station of the Nebraska State University,
USA (40° 83′N; 96° 67′W), Hubbard et al. (2004) carried out comparative SAT
observations over smooth grass cover with the use of various protections of ther-
mometers. At the same time, direct solar radiation and wind speed were measured.
Analysis of observations has shown that differences of observed data can reach
several tenths of a degree. Therefore, a technique has been proposed to increase the
homogeneity of observation series which substantially increases the homogeneity
of the series. However, it does not permit the exclusion of the effect of calibration
errors and drift of the temperature sensor’s sensitivity.
For the diagnostics of the observational data, emphasis should be put on the
analysis of climate variability in which a consideration not of averages but moments
5.3
Empirical Diagnostics of the Global Climate
383

of higher orders is important. Unfortunately, there have been no attempts to use this
approach. The same approach refers to estimates of the internal correlation of
observation series. McKitrick (2010), having analyzed the secular trend of SAT,
showed that with the ﬁltered-out contribution to temperature variations during the
last several decades at the expense of internal correlations (i.e., determined by the
climatic system’s inertia), it turns out that practically the temperature has not
changed. There is a paradox: an increase of the global average SAT during the last
20–30 years is the principal basis for the conclusion concerning the anthropogenic
contribution to the present-day climate changes.
5.3.2 Air Temperature
According to SAT observations discussed in IPCC (2001), during the period from
1860 to the present its annual and global averages increased by 0.76 ± 0.19 °C
Figs. 5.3 and 5.4 show the time series of the combined global land and marine
surface temperature record from 1880 to 2013. This is approximately 0.15 °C
higher than the value given in the IPCC-1996 report, which was explained by a high
SAT level between 1995 and 2000. The observed data revealed a strong spatial-
temporal variability of the mean annual SAT on the globe. This manifested itself,
for instance, in that the climate warming in the 20th century took place during two

warming)
384

Ecoinformatics Problems of Global Climate Change

time periods: 1919–1945 and from 1976 until now. It follows from global climate
diagnostics that the warming in the Northern Hemisphere in the 20th century was,
apparently, the strongest during the last 1,000 years, the 1990s being the warmest
decade, and the year 1998, the warmest year (Hansen and Sato 2001; Hansen et al.
1997, 2010).
The period 2001–2010 (0.477 °C above 1961–1990 mean) was 0.217 °C warmer
than the 1991–2000 decade (0.270 °C above the 1961–1990 average). The warmest
year of the entire series was 2010, with a temperature of 0.540 °C above the 1961–
1990 mean. The value for this year, given the uncertainties discussed in Morice
et al. (2012) is not distinguishable from the years 1998 (0.523 °C) and 2005
(0.534 °C). The coldest year of the 21st century (2008 with a value of 0.383 °C)
was warmer than all years in the 20th century with the exception of 1998 and 1997
(0.390 °C). The ﬁrst 2 years of the present decade (2011 and 2012) are cooler than
the average for 2001–2010, but warmer than all years before 2000 except for 1998.
An important feature of the climate dynamics was that, on the average, the rate
of increase of nocturnal (minimum) SAT values on land was almost twice as high
compared to that of diurnal (maximum) SAT values, starting from 1950 (0.2 °C
against 0.1 °C per 10 years). This favored an increase in the duration of the frost-
free periods in many regions of mid- and high latitudes.
The IPCC-2001 Report does not mention a previously assumed enhanced
increase of climate warming in the NH high latitudes as a characteristic indicator of
anthropogenic global warming. However, an analysis of direct SAT measurements
at the “North Pole” stations during 30 years (Adamenko and Kondratyev 1990), as
well as of dendroclimatic indirect data for the last 2–3 centuries, shows that there
had been no homogeneous enhancement of such warming. Climatic changes during
the last century and the last decade were characterized by a strong spatial-temporal
heterogeneity: in the Arctic, the regions of both warming and cooling of climate
were formed simultaneously (see also Moritz et al. 2002).
Fig. 5.4 The global average sea surface temperature (SST) update for Feb. 2013 is −0.01 °C,
relative to the 2003–2006 average (http://www.drroyspencer.com/global-microwave-sea-surface-
temperature-update-for-feb-2013)
5.3
Empirical Diagnostics of the Global Climate
385

From satellite observations (beginning from 1979), the trend of global average
temperature for the lower troposphere (0–8 km) was +0.07 °C per 10 years (Christy
and Spenser 2003). According to the data of aerological soundings there was an
increase of the global average temperature of the lower troposphere by about 0.03 °C
per 10 years, being much below the SAT increase (*0.15 °C per 10 years) (Waple
and Lawrimore 2003). This difference in warming manifests itself mainly in the
oceanic regions in the tropics and sub-tropics, and it is not clear why such is the case
(Christy and Spenser 2003). The results of the numerical climate modeling show that
the global warming should be stronger in the free troposphere than near the surface.
The difference of temperature trends near the surface and in the troposphere has
caused heated discussion in the scientiﬁc literature (Christy and Spenser 2003;
Waple and Lawrimore 2003). Since the reliability of the satellite remote sensing
data raises no doubts, and their spatial representativeness (on global scales) is more
reliable than that of the data of surface measurements, this difference should be
interpreted as necessitating further analysis of the SAT and SST data adequacy.
Data on changes in the height of the tropopause have recently attracted rapt
attention. The height of the tropopause depends on the location, notably the latitude,
as shown in the Fig. 5.5. As Santer et al. (2003) noted, starting from 1979, the
height of the tropopause increased by several hundred meters, agreeing with the
results of numerical climate modeling, taking into account the growth of GHGs
concentrations, whose contribution prevails, again, in “enigmatic” agreement of the
observed and calculated data. As it follows from Fig. 5.4 the tropopause height does
not gradually drop from low to high latitudes. Rather, it drops rapidly in the area of
the subtropical and polar front jets (Linacre and Geerts 1997).
Studies of the dynamics of the tropical tropopause layer are of great interest for
quantitative estimates of climate change and an understanding of mechanisms for
the troposphere-stratosphere interactions. These circumstances have stimulated
recent serious attention to studies of the climatic structure and variability of the
tropical tropopause, as well mechanisms responsible for the formation of this
Fig. 5.5 The height of the
tropopause

structure. Serious attention has also been paid to analysis of data on the content of
water vapor in the stratosphere and mechanisms for the formation of thin cirrus
clouds in the tropics. Randel et al. (2003) undertook studies of the structure and
variability of the temperature ﬁeld in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere
of the tropics (at altitudes about 10–30 km) from the data of radio-occultation
observations for the period from April 1995 till February 1997, using the satellite
system designed for geodetic measurements (GPS). A comparison with a large
number (several hundreds) of synchronous aerological soundings has shown that a
retrieval of the vertical temperature proﬁles from GPS/MET data provides reliable
enough information.
Analysis of the obtained results suggested that the spatial structure and vari-
ability of the tropopause altitude determined by a “cool point” (minimum tem-
perature) of the vertical temperature proﬁle are governed mainly by wave-like
ﬂuctuations like Kelvin waves. A strong correlation was observed between tem-
perature from GPS/MET data and outgoing longwave radiation, which can serve as
an indirect indicator of penetrating convection in the tropics. This correlation
conﬁrms a reality of temperature ﬂuctuation revealed from GPS/MET data and
opens possibilities of quantitative assessments of the response of large-scale tem-
perature ﬁeld in the tropics to time-varying conditions of convection, revealing
coherent wavelike variations at altitudes between 12 and 18 km.
5.3.3 Snow and Ice Cover
Snow and ice cover estimation is important for climate change studies and suc-
cessful water resource management. Sea ice is important component in the global
climate system. Sea ice regulates of heat, moisture and salinity in the polar oceans.
Sea ice area is considerable varied in both hemispheres. In the Northern Hemi-
sphere, the total extent of sea ice varies from a minimum of about 7.8 × 106 km2 in
September to a maximum of about 14.8 × 106 km2 in March. In the Southern
Hemisphere, the extent varies from about 4.0 × 106 km2 in February to about
20.0 × 106 km2 in September (Parkinson 1994; Hall et al. 1995; Parkinson et al.
1987; Orheim 1999). Since the end of the 1960s, a 10 % decrease of the snow cover
extent has been observed, as well as a 2-week reduction of the annual duration of
lakes and river ice-cover in NH middle and high latitudes, while in the non-polar
regions mountain glaciers are retreating. In 2002, NH snow cover extent constituted
25.4 million km2, on the average by 0.2 million km2, less than during the preceding
30 years. The annual trend of snow cover changes from 2.7 (August) to 46.9
(January) million km2 (Waple and Lawrimore 2002). Also, starting from the 1950s,
the extent of NH ice cover in spring and summer has been decreasing by 10–15 %.
During the last decades (in the periods “late summer—early fall”) the Arctic sea ice
cover thickness has probably decreased by about 40 %, with winter decrease being
less substantial. From regular satellite observations (starting from the 1970s) no
marked trend in the extent of ice cover in the Antarctic has been observed.
5.3
Empirical Diagnostics of the Global Climate
387

In recent years, satellite data have indicated an even more evident reduction in
regional ice cover. Table 5.4, Figs. 5.6 and 5.7 contain some characteristics of sea
ice extent and its variations. All estimated values in Table 5.4, were based on the
NSIDC passive microwave satellite data, which represent the best method to
monitor sea ice, because of the ability to snow data through most clouds and during
darkness. Observations of polar oceans derived from microwave instruments are
essential for tracking the ice edge, estimating sea ice concentration, and classifying
sea ice types.
Figure 5.8 characterizes yearly distribution of the arctic sea ice area. This and
analogous data regularly delivered by different satellite instruments mainly of the U.
S. National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). Kelley et al. (2003) developed an
algorithm to estimate global snow cover volume from spaceborne passive micro-
wave remote sensing observations. This algorithm is a simple dynamic approach to
retrieve global snow depth estimation. This approach, in contrast to statistic
approach, assumes that snowpack properties are spatially and temporally dynamic
and requires two simple empirical models of density and snowpack grain radius
evolution, plus a dense media radiative transfer model based on the quasicrystalline
approximation and sticky particle theory.
Ananicheva (2005) notes that the main parameter, which determines the extent
and evolution of much of the terrestrial cryosphere, is the position of the bottom
boundary of equal snow line altitudes, where potential snow accumulation and
melting are of the same value. There exist and other indicators that characterize
climate zones:
• climatic snow line (CSL) and
• glacier equilibrium line altitude (ELA).

The CSL is the point above which snow and ice cover the ground throughout the
year. The actual snow line may seasonally be signiﬁcantly lower. Typical CSLs are
given in Table 5.5. The ELA marks the area or zone on a glacier where annual
accumulation and ablation are equal.
Numerical modeling using global climate models has shown (from considering
the growing concentration of GHGs and aerosols) that climate warming should
increase in the Arctic because of a feedback determined by the melting of the sea

the observed data, SAT has increased during the last decades over most of the
Arctic. One of the regions where a warming has taken place is northern Alaska
(especially in winter and in spring). In this connection, Stone et al. (2002) have
analyzed the data on climatic changes in the North of Alaska to reveal their impact
on the annual trend of the snow cover extent (SCE) and the impact of SCE changes
on the surface radiation budget (SRB) and SAT. The NASA/GEWEX SRB
Release-3.0 data sets contains global 3-hourly, daily, monthly/3-hourly, and
monthly averages of surface and top-of atmosphere (TOA) longwave and short-
wave radiative parameters on a 1° × 1° grid.
The Northern Hemisphere EASE-Grid 2.0 Weekly Snow Cover and Sea Ice
Extent Version 4 product combine snow cover and sea ice extent at weekly intervals
from 23 October 1978 through 31 December 2010, and snow cover alone from 03
October 1966 through 31 December 2010. Snow cover extent for this data set is
based on the NOAA/NCDC Climate Data Record (CDR) of Northern Hemisphere
(NH) Snow Cover Extent (SCE) regridded to the EASE-Grid. The NOAA/NCDC
CDR of Northern Hemisphere Snow Cover Extent data were derived from the
manual interpretation of AVHRR, GOES, and other visible-band satellite data
(Helfrich et al. 2007; NOAA 2012). Sea ice extent is regridded to EASE-Grid from
Sea Ice Concentrations from Nimbus-7 SMMR and DMSP SSM/I-SSMIS Passive
Microwave Data. Designed to facilitate the study of Northern Hemisphere seasonal
ﬂuctuations of snow cover and sea ice extent, the data set also includes monthly
climatologies, describing the average extent, probability of occurrence, and
variance. Data are provided in ﬂat, unsigned binary ﬁles and are available via FTP.

5.3.4 Sea Surface Level and Heat Content of the Ocean
Upper Layer
Sea surface level is usually presented as mean sea level, that is the average height of
the sea’s surface. Detection of long-time variations of mean sea level can provide
information on climate change. During the 20th century, the World Ocean surface
level rose by 0.1–0.2 m. Apparently, this was caused by the thermal expansion of
sea water and ice melting on land due to the global warming. The rate of the World
Ocean level rise in the 20th century apparently exceeded that observed during the
last 3,000 years by a factor of ten. Beginning from the end of the 1950s (when SST
changes became large-scale), the heat content of the ocean upper layer has also been

increasing. Between 1870 and 2004, global average sea levels rose 195 mm (7.7 in)
(Church and White 2006). From 1950 to 2009, measurements show an average
annual rise in sea level of 1.7 ± 0.3 mm per year, with satellite data showing a rise
of 3.3 ± 0.4 mm per year from 1993 to 2009 (Nicholls et al. 2010), a faster rate of
increase than previously estimated (IPCC 2007). For at least the last 100 years, sea
level has been rising at an average rate of about 1.8 mm per year. Most of this rise
can be attributed to the increase in temperature of the sea and the resulting slight
thermal expansion of the upper 500 m of sea water.
Operative data about sea level is delivered by the Global Sea Level Observing
System (GLOSS) that aims at the establishment of high quality global and regional
sea level networks for application to climate, oceanographic and coastal sea level
research. The main component of GLOSS is the Global Core Network (GCN) of 290
sea level stations around the world for long term climate change and oceanographic
sea level monitoring (Fig. 5.9). Figures 5.10 and 5.11 characterize data about sea
level dynamics. Figure 5.10 shows the sea level change as a function of temperature.
Hourly, daily and monthly sea level data are provided and hosted by Joint Archive
for Sea level (JASL)-NODC and the University of Hawaii Sea Level Center
(UHSLC) from stations in tropical and subtropical areas of the Paciﬁc, Atlantic, and
Indian Oceans. Most data are from tide gauges but some data are delivered from
bottom-mounted pressure gauges. Global sea level data are also delivered from
satellite altimeter data (http://data.nodc.noaa.gov/accession/0053056).
Levitus et al. (2001) analyzed data on the warming of some components of the
climatic system during the second half of the 20th century. These data were derived
from the growth of the heat content of the atmosphere and ocean as well as from
estimates of the heat losses due to melting of some components of the cryosphere.
These ﬁndings have led to the conclusion that the heat content of the atmosphere
and ocean is rising. The growth of the heat content in the 3-km ocean layer between

1950 and 1990 exceeded, at least, by an order of magnitude, the increase of the heat
content in other components of the climate system. While the observed increase of
the ocean heat content between 1955 and 1996 reached 18.2 × 1022 J, then for the
atmosphere it constituted only 6.6 × 1021 J. As for the values of latent heat due to
water phase transformations, they were: 8.1 × 1021 J (a decrease of the mass of
glaciers on land); 3.2 × 1021 J (a decrease of the sea ice cover extent in the
Antarctic); 1.1 × 1021 J (melting of mountain glaciers); 4.6 × 1019 J (a decrease of
the snow cover extent in the Northern Hemisphere); 2.4 × 1019 J (melting of
permafrost in the Arctic).

The observed data were compared with results of numerical modeling using the
GFDL interactive model of the “atmosphere-ocean” system taking into account the
radiative forcings due to:
(1) the observed growth of GHGs concentrations, changes of the sulphate aerosol
content in the atmosphere and extra-atmospheric insolation; and
(2) volcanic aerosol; as well as GHGs and sulphate aerosol only.
The resulting comparisons have led to the conclusion that the observed changes
of the ocean heat content can be explained, mainly, by the growth of GHGs con-
centrations in the atmosphere, though one should bear in mind a substantial
uncertainty concerning the estimate of radiative forcings (RF) due to sulphate
aerosol and volcanic eruptions.
Cai and Whetton (2002) drew attention to the fact that the ocean dynamics can
considerably affect future global-scale precipitation. Developments in these difﬁcult
problems are based on the use of both observed data and results of numerical
modeling, and have led to quite different conclusions. The climatic warming of the
last decades was characterized by the spatial structure similar to that of the El Niño/
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event. But since there are no data on such a structure
for the whole century, the observed structure of warming is assumed to be a
manifestation of the multi-decadal natural variability of climate, not the result of the
greenhouse forcing.
Moritz et al. (2002) revealed a substantial inadequacy of climate models as
applied to the Arctic conditions. In most cases, calculated AO (Arctic oscillations)
trends turned out to be weaker compared to observed ones. The calculated climate
warming is greater in the fall over the Arctic Ocean, while the observed warming is
at a maximum in winter and over the continents in spring.
Prestrud et al. (2007) analyzes data about ice and snow in polar and mountain
regions of the world covering all parts of the cryosphere (the world of ice): snow,
land ice, sea ice, river and lake ice, and frozen ground. They present information on
the trends in ice and snow, the outlook for this century and beyond, and the
consequences to ecosystems and human well-being of changes in ice and snow. But
this book is also about sea-level rise and the islands in the South Paciﬁc, and about
shrinking glaciers and the great rivers of Asia. It is about the way the Earth’s
climate is changing and causing ice and snow to melt—and how melting ice and
snow are changing the Earth’s climate.
Singh et al. (2011) published encyclopedia that mainly focuses on the various
aspects of snow, ice and glaciers, but also covers other cryospheric branches, and
provides an up-to-date information and basic concepts on relevant topics. It
includes alphabetically arranged and professionally written, comprehensive and
authoritative academic articles by well-known international experts in individual
ﬁelds. The encyclopedia contains a broad spectrum of topics, ranging from the
atmospheric processes responsible for snow formation; transformation of snow to
ice and changes in their properties; classiﬁcation of ice and glaciers and their
worldwide distribution; glaciation and ice ages; glacier dynamics; glacier surface
and subsurface characteristics; geomorphic processes and landscape formation;

hydrology and sedimentary systems; permafrost degradation; hazards caused by
cryospheric changes; and trends of glacier retreat on the global scale along with the
impact of climate change.
Singh et al. (2011) note that the earth’s cryosphere, which includes snow, glaciers
and ice caps, ice sheets, ice shelves, sea ice, river and lake ice, and frozen ground,
contains about 75 % of the earth’s fresh water. It exists at almost all latitudes, from the
tropics to the poles, and plays a vital role in controlling the global climate system. It
also provides direct visible evidence of the effect of climate change, and, therefore,
requires proper understanding of the complex dynamics.
5.3.5 Other Climatic Parameters
Data on global soil temperature (GST) are important for climate diagnostics. As
Majorovicz et al. (2002) have noted, an analysis of the GST data obtained in
different regions of Canada by measuring the ground temperature in bore-holes,
revealed considerable spatial differentiation both in GST increase observed in the
20th century, and in the onset of the warming. For instance, from measurements in
21 bore-holes covering a period of the last 1,000 year, warming was detected
(within 1–3 °C) during the last 200 years. The warming was preceded by a long
cooling trend in the region 80°–96°W, 46°–50°N, which continued until the
beginning of the 19th century. According to data for ten bore-holes in central
Canada, the temperature had reached a minimum about the year 1820 with a
subsequent warming by about 1.5 °C. In western Canada, during the last 100 years
the warming reached 2 °C.
An analysis has been made by Majorovicz et al. (2002) of more adequate
information on GST from data of measurements in 141 bore-holes at a depth of
several hundred meters. The holes were drilled in 1970–1990. The results obtained
revealed an intensive warming that started in the 18–19th centuries, which followed
a long period of cooling (especially during the Little Ice Age), continuing during
the rest of the millennium. The time of the onset of the present warming differed
between regions. An analysis of the spatial distribution of the GST changes over the
territory of Canada revealed a substantial delay in the onset of the present warming
in the east-to-west direction, with a higher level of the GST increase in the 20th
century in western Canada. This conclusion is conﬁrmed by the data of SAT
observations. It should be noted that the GST increase in eastern Canada had begun
about 100 years before the industrial era.
Characteristics of the atmospheric general circulation are important components
of climate diagnostics. Wallace and Thompson (2002) pointed out that the west-
eastern zonal wind component averaged over the 55°N latitudinal belt can be a
representative indicator of the primary mode of the surface air pressure anomalies—
the Northern Hemisphere annual mode (NAM) that is hemispheric scale patterns of
climate variability. Both NAM and a similar index SAM for the Southern Hemi-
sphere are typical signatures of symbiotic relationships between the meridional
5.3

proﬁles of the west-eastern transport in the respective hemisphere and wave dis-
turbances superimposed on this transport. Their index determined (using a
respective normalization) as a coefﬁcient for the ﬁrst term of NAM expansion in
empirical orthogonal functions, can serve as the quantitative characteristic of the
modes. The presence of the positive NAM (or SAM) index denoted the existence of
a relatively strong west-eastern transport.
During the last years, it was recognized that dynamic factors contribute much to
observed temperature trends. For instance, in 1995 a marked similarity was
observed between the spatial distributions of the SAT ﬁeld and NAM ﬂuctuations
for the last 30 years, with a clear increase of the NAM index. The increasing trend
of the index was accompanied by mild winters, changes of the spatial distribution of
precipitation in Europe, and the ozone layer depletion in the latitudinal belt >40°N.
Similar data are available for the Southern Hemisphere. The main conclusion is that
along with the ENSO event, both NAM and SAM are the leading factors of the
global atmospheric variability. In this regard, attention should be focused on the
problem of the 30-year trend of NAM towards an IM increase (after 1995 the index
lowered). It is still not clear whether this trend is a part of long-term oscillations.
Figure 5.12 represents NAM for the Northern Hemisphere. When there’s a deﬁcit
of air mass in the red areas, there tends to be a surplus in the blue areas, and vice
versa. At the same time, the jet stream winds tend to speed up or slow down in the
direction of the green arrows. A similar pattern exists in the Southern Hemisphere.

Feldstein and Franzke (2006) examined composites of the sea level pressure,
40-h Pa, and 300-h Pa streamfunction ﬁelds during NAO and NAM persistent events
to test null hypothesis. Standard statistical techniques were used, such as t tests for the
differences of means. This study addresses the question of whether persistent events
of the NAO and the NAM teleconnection patterns are distinguishable from each
other. Standard daily index time series are used to specify the amplitude of the NAO
and NAM patterns. It is found that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected even at the
80 % conﬁdence level. The wave-breaking characteristics during the NAM life cycle
are also examined. Both the positive and negative NAM phases yield the same wave-
breaking properties as those for the NAO. The results suggest that not only are the
NAO and NAM persistent events indistinguishable, but that the NAO/NAM events
are neither conﬁned to the North Atlantic, nor are they annular.
The observational data show that during the 20th century an increase of pre-
cipitation constituted 0.5–1 % per 10 years over most of land surface in the middle
and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, but a decrease (by about 0.3 % per
10 years) took place over most of land surface in sub-tropical latitudes, which has
recently weakened, however. As for the World Ocean, the lack of adequate
observational data has not permitted the identiﬁcation of any reliable trends of
precipitation. In recent decades, intensive and extreme precipitation in the middle
and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere has probably become more frequent.
Beginning from the mid-1970s the ENSO events have been frequent, stable and
intensive. This ENSO dynamics was reﬂected in speciﬁc regional variations of
precipitation and SAT in most of the zones of the tropics and sub-tropics. Data on
the intensity and frequency of occurrence of the tropical and extratropical cyclones
as well as local storms still remain fragmentary and inadequate and do not permit to
draw conclusions on any trends.
Changes in the biosphere are also important indicators of climate. One of them is
the bleaching of corals. It is important to recognize that enhanced atmospheric
forcings on coral reefs do not lead to their disappearance but to their transformation
into more resistant species (Chin 2011; Hughes et al. 2003). Changes of sea water
properties are one more indicator (Broecker 2003). The properties of sea water are a
function of temperature, salinity (i.e. total dissolved solids in g kg−1) and pressure
(Table 5.6).
5.3.6 Concentrations of Greenhouse Gases
and Anthropogenic Aerosol in the Atmosphere
A greenhouse gas (GHG) is a gas in an atmosphere that absorbs and emits radiation
within the thermal infrared range. This process is the fundamental cause of the
greenhouse effect. The primary greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere are
water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Table 5.7 contents
list of greenhouse gases and their characteristics related to the climate. Aside from
water vapor, which has a residence time of about 9 days, major greenhouse gases

are well-mixed, and take many years to leave the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases in
the atmosphere absorb and re-emit some of the outgoing energy radiated from the
Earth’s surface, causing that heat to be retained in the lower atmosphere. The global
warming potential (GWP) depends on both the efﬁciency of the molecule as a
greenhouse gas and its atmospheric lifetime (Table 5.8).
From 1750 till now the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased by
about one third, reaching the highest level for the last 420 thousand years (and,
probably, during the last 20 million years), which is illustrated by the data from ice
cores (IPCC 2001, 2007). The growth of CO2 concentration by about two thirds
during the last 20 years is explained by emissions to the atmosphere from fossil fuel
burning (contributions of deforestation and, to a lesser extent, cement industry
constitute one third). Figure 5.13 characterizes this data. It is of interest that by the
end of 1999, CO2 emissions in the USA exceeded their 1990 level by 12 %, and by
2013 their further increase should raise this value by another 10 %. Nevertheless,
according to the Kyoto Protocol, the emissions should be reduced by 7 % by 2013
compared to the level of 1990, which requires a total reduction in emissions of by
about 25 %.
According to available observational data, both the World Ocean and land are
currently global sinks for CO2. In the ocean, both chemical and biological processes
are responsible; on land we observe an enhanced “fertilization” of vegetation due to
increased concentrations of CO2 and nitrogen, as well as with changes in land use.
Yet much remains unclear about the global carbon cycle (Kondratyev et al. 2003c).
In particular, contradictions in the estimates of the role of the biosphere and ocean
in the global carbon cycle remain to be resolved.
There is no doubt that fossil fuel burning will remain the main factor in the
growth of CO2 concentration in the 21st century. The role of the biosphere (both the
ocean and land) as a barrier to the growth of CO2 concentration will be reduced in
time. According to the IPCC-2001 Report, the probable interval of CO2

concentration values by the end of the century will constitute 540–970 ppm (pre-
industrial and present values are, respectively, 280 and 367 ppm). Changes of land
use are also an important factor of the global carbon cycle, but all carbon emitted to
the atmosphere due to land use will be assimilated by the land biosphere. This could
only lead to a decrease of CO2 concentration within 40–70 ppm. As for the
prognostic estimates of the concentrations of other GHGs, they vary widely. So, for
instance, it is concluded from some estimates that the role of tropospheric ozone as
a greenhouse gas can be equal to the contribution of methane and will be sub-
stantial, as being the factor of deterioration of air quality over most of the northern
hemisphere.
The concentration of methane in the atmosphere increased by a factor of 2.5,
compared with that observed in 1750, and continues to grow. The annual rate of CH4
increase was reduced, however, and became more variable in the 1990s compared
with the 1980s. From the beginning of 1750, nitrous oxide concentration
has increased by 16 %. With the implementation of the Montreal Protocol, con-
centrations of several halocarbon compounds functioning as GHG and ozone-
destructing gases either, have increased more slowly or started decreasing. However,
concentrations of their substitutes and some other synthetic compounds started to
grow rapidly (e.g., perﬂuorocarbons, PFC, and sulphur hexaﬂuoride, SF6).
As for the properties of atmospheric aerosol and its climatic impact, respective
current information has been reviewed in detail in (Kondratyev et al. 2003c;
Krapivin and Varotsos 2008). In this connection, it is pointed out again that the
supposed anthropogenic nature of the present global climate warming was explained
by the warming caused by the growth in GHGs concentrations (primarily CO2 and
CH4), as well as cooling due to anthropogenic aerosols. However, if the estimates of
the “greenhouse” warming can be considered as sufﬁciently reliable, then the
respective calculations of radiative forcing (RF) due to aerosol are very uncertain. Of
no less importance is the fact that, while the global distribution of the “greenhouse”
RF is comparatively uniform, the case of the “aerosol” RF is characterized by a
strong spatial-temporal variability (including changes of the sign of RF).

5.3.7 Paleoclimatic Information
Paleoclimatic information is an important source of data for the comparative
analysis of the present and past climates. Analysis of the data of paleoclimatic
observations reveals large-scale abrupt climate changes in the past, when the cli-
mate system had exceeded certain threshold levels. Though some mechanisms for
such changes have been identiﬁed and the existing methods of numerical climate
modeling are being gradually improved, the existing models still do not permit a
reliable reconstruction of past climatic changes. With emphasis on the climatic
implications of the growth of GHGs concentrations in the atmosphere, less effort
has been made to study possible sudden climate changes that may be of natural
origin, though possibly intensiﬁed by anthropogenic forcings.
Since such changes lie beyond the problems addressed in the UN FCCC, Alley
et al. (2003) undertook a conceptual evaluation of the problem of large-scale abrupt
climate changes. Though the available long-term stabilizing feedbacks have
determined the existence on the Earth of comparatively persistent global climate for
about 4 billion years, with characteristic time scales from 1 year to 1 million years,
feedbacks prevailing in the climate system had favored an enhancement of forcings
on climate. So, for instance, changes of global average SAT within 5–6 °C during
the glaciation cycles apparently resulted from very weak forcings due to variations
of the orbital parameters.
It is still more surprising that during several decades and in the absence of external
forcings, regional changes have taken place, reaching 30–50 % of those, that had taken
place in the epochs of glaciations. Data from the period of instrumental observations
have revealed abrupt climatic changes, quite often accompanied by serious socio-
economic consequences. So, for instance, the warming in many northern regions in the
20th century took place in two rapid “steps”, which enables one to suppose that in this
case there was a superposition of the anthropogenic trend on inter-annual natural
variability. Special attention was paid to the role of the ENSO event. The latter also
refers to a sharp change of the climate system in the Paciﬁc region in 1976–1977.
Considerable abrupt changes of regional climate in the period of Paleocene were
detected from paleoclimatic reconstructions. They had been manifested as changes
of the frequency of occurrence of hurricanes, ﬂoods, and especially droughts.
Regional SAT changes reaching 8–16 °C had happened in the periods of 10 years
and shorter. Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) oscillations can serve as an example of
large-scale sudden changes. DO events are rapid climate ﬂuctuations that occurred
25 times during the last glacial period.
The climatic system involves numerous factors that intensify climatic changes
with minimum forcings. The withering or death of plants, for example, may cause a
decrease of evapotranspiration and hence lead to precipitation attenuation, which
may further increase drought conditions. In the cold-climate regions the snow cover
formation is accompanied by a strong increase of albedo, which favours further
cooling (the so-called “albedo effect”). Substantial climatic feedbacks are associated
with the dynamics of the thermohaline circulation.
5.3
Empirical Diagnostics of the Global Climate
401

While the factors of enhancement of either changes or stability of climate are
comparatively well known, the understanding of the factors in the spatial distri-
bution of anomalies over large regions, including the globe, is of great importance.
In this connection, further studies of various modes of the general circulation of the
atmosphere and the ocean (ENSO, DO oscillations, etc.) are important, as it is
the respective improvement of general circulation models. Most important here are
the potential effects of abrupt climatic changes on ecology and economy, as current
estimates are generally based on the assumption of slow and gradual change.
Abrupt climate changes were especially substantial in periods of the transition of
one climatic state to another. Therefore, if anthropogenic forcings of climate can
favor the drifting of the climate system towards a threshold level, the possibility of
raising the probability of abrupt climate changes also increases. Of great importance
has not only the amount but also the rate of anthropogenic forcings on the climate
system. So, for instance, a faster climate warming should favor a stronger attenu-
ation of the thermohaline circulation, as this may promote an acceleration of the
shift to the threshold of climatic changes (it is important that under these conditions,
thermohaline circulation dynamics becomes less predictable). To accept adequate
solutions in the ﬁeld of ecological policy, a deeper understanding of the whole
spectrum of possible sudden climate changes is extremely important. Difﬁculties in
the identiﬁcation and quantitative estimation of all possible causes of sudden cli-
mate change and low predictability near threshold levels, testify the fact that the
problem of abrupt climate changes will always be aggravated by more serious
uncertainties, than the problem of slow change. Under these conditions the
development of ways to provide the stability and high adaptability of economics
and ecosystems is of great importance.
5.4 Interactive Components of Climate System
5.4.1 Anomalous Situations and Climate
Kosaka and Xie (2013) considered the hiatus in global warming mentioned that
despite the continued increase in atmospheric GHG concentrations, the annual-
mean global temperature has not risen in the twenty-ﬁrst century. Figure 5.14
represent variations of temperature for 2002–2012. Compared to seasonal norms, in
September 2013 the coolest area on the globe was south of South Africa in the
southern ocean, where temperatures in the troposphere were about 2.49 °C cooler
than normal. The warmest area was in the Wilkes Land area of the east Antarctic,
where tropospheric temperatures were 5.20 °C warmer than seasonal norms.
Climate change manifests itself both on global and regional scales. One of the
important features of climate formation not only on regional but also on global
scales consists in considerable variability determined by internal dynamics of cli-
mate system. One of the most substantial factors of internal dynamics is the El
Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event. One of the recent climate warming due to
402

ENSO started in October–November 2002 and ended in March–April 2003.
However, despite the end of ENSO in the period of boreal spring, the ENSO-
induced warming has led to regional anomalous rains in a wide range of the Paciﬁc
Ocean, including the formation of the zone of increased moisture content along the
western coast of South America and the region of moisture deﬁciency in the eastern
part of Australia as well as in the south-western sector of the Paciﬁc Ocean.
The global mean SAT in 2003 turned out to be close to three maximum values
observed during the period from 1880, but below the record level of SAT in 1998.
An increase of global mean SAT in 2003 compared to an average value for 1961–
1990 constituted 0.46 °C. According to the data of satellite thermal sounding, the
global mean temperature of the middle troposphere in 2003 was third by the level of
warming, compared to the average value for 1979–1998 period. The annual global
average surface temperature anomaly for 2011 was +0.07 °C, with the 1981–2010
average as a baseline. 2012 was the ninth warmest year with global average tem-
perature 14.45 °C. This is 0.45 ± 0.10 °C above the 1961–1990 average. The trend
of global average temperature is 0.68 °C/Century. August 2013 was the 342nd
consecutive month (more than 28 years) with a global temperature above the 20th-
century average. These data show that SAT is changed with some dispersion rel-
ative to some climatic trend that is represented in Fig. 5.9.
In general, history represents the temperature anomalies regularly:
• 1923/1924—During a period of 160 days from 31 October 1923 to 7 April
1924, the Western Australian town of Marble Bar set a world record for the most
consecutive days above 38 °C.
• On July 14 1954, the thermometer reached 47 °C at East St. Louis, Illinois,
which remains the record highest temperature for that state.

• 1980—The Dallas/Fort Worth area experienced 42 consecutive days with high
temperatures above 38 °C, with temperatures reaching 47 °C at Wichita Falls,
Texas on June 28.
• During the summer of 1983 temperatures over 38 °C were common across Iowa,
Missouri, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota, Nebraska
and certain parts of Kentucky; the summer of 1983 remains one of the hottest
summers ever recorded in many of the states affected.
• 2001—Newark, New Jersey tied its all-time record high temperature of 41 °C
with a heat index of over 50 °C.
• 2003—In Portugal, the temperatures reached as high as 47 °C in the south.
• The European heat wave of 2006 was the second massive heat wave to hit the
continent in 4 years, with temperatures rising to 40 °C in Paris; in Ireland, which
has a moderate maritime climate, temperatures of over 32 °C were reported.
Temperatures of 35 °C were reached in the Benelux and Germany (in some
areas 38 °C, while Great Britain recorded 37 °C.
• 2006—Temperatures in some parts of South Dakota exceeded 46 °C. Also,
California experienced temperatures that were extraordinarily high, with records
ranging from 40 to 54.4 °C. On July 22, the County of Los Angeles recorded its
highest temperature ever at 48 °C.
• 2007—Bulgaria experienced its hottest year on record, with previously unre-
corded temperatures above 45 °C. The Indian city of Datia experienced tem-
peratures of 48 °C.
• 2008—Alice Springs in Australia’s Northern Territory recorded ten consecutive
days of temperatures above 40 °C with the average temperature for that month
being 39.8 °C. In March, Adelaide, South Australia experienced maximum
temperatures of above 35 °C for 15 consecutive days, 7 days more than the
previous longest stretch of 35 °C days. The March heat wave also included
eleven consecutive days above 38 °C. The heat wave was especially notable
because it occurred in March, an autumn month, in which Adelaide averages
only 2.3 days above 35 °C.
• 2009—Adelaide, South Australia was hit by a heat wave with temperatures
reaching 40 °C for 6 days in a row, while many rural areas experienced tem-
peratures hovering around about mid *40 °C. Kyancutta on the Eyre Peninsula
endured at least 1 day at 48 °C. In neighbouring Victoria recorded 3 consecutive
days over 43 °C, and also recorded its highest ever temperature 8 days later in a
secondary heatwave, with the mercury peaking at 46.4 °C.
• 2010—On 26 May, at Mohenjo-daro, Sindh province in Pakistan, a national
record of high temperature of 53.5 °C occurred.
• In late July and early August 2011, temperatures in Iraq were exceeding 49 °C
(Baghdad—52 °C).
The summer of 2003, in some regions of Western Europe, was one of the
warmest summer seasons with heat waves affecting mainly Central and Western
Europe. Two anomalous heat waves taking place in June and July–August (espe-
cially the second wave) were especially powerful. Droughts accompanying them
404

have caused forest ﬁres, which covered a considerable part of the territory in the
south of France and in Portugal in July and August. The summer of 2003 in
Western Europe was apparently the hottest over the period after the year 1540. The
heat wave in France killed 11,000 people. In Germany that summer was the hottest
in the 20th century and (except some regions of northern and north-western
Germany) the hottest over the whole period of instrumental observations.
The most substantial anomalous situations that happened in March 2003
included:
(1) extremely intensive precipitation in the middle part of the Atlantic Ocean, in
the south-east and eastern coast of the USA;
(2) extremely low SAT values and unusual snowfalls over the European territory
of Russia;
(3) 546 tornados in May in the USA, which was unprecedented;
(4) a long-term drought in the west of the USA, where in some regions it was the
fourth and 50 year of a considerable deﬁciency of precipitation;
(5) heavy brush ﬁres in the eastern part of Australia in January and powerful forest
ﬁres in the south of California in October;
(6) anomalously intensive precipitation in Western Africa and in Sahel;
(7) return to the normal level of precipitation on the Indian sub-continent in the
period of summer monsoon; and
(8) close-to-record extent of the “ozone hole” in the Antarctic reaching a maxi-
mum of 28.2 million km2 in September 2003.
The globally averaged temperature for 2012 (14.6 °C) marked the 10th warmest
year since record keeping began in 1880. It also marked the 36th consecutive year
with a global temperature above the 20th century average. The last below-average
annual temperature was 1976. Including 2012, all 12 years to date in the 21st
century (2001–2012) rank among the 14 warmest in the 133-year period of record.
Only 1 year during the 20th century—1998—was warmer than 2012.
Last years have been marked by an increased interest in study of the present
climate change in high latitudes of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, which is
mostly determined by decision to conduct in 2007–2008 the Third International Polar
Year. The major conclusions concerning the Arctic climate diagnostics are concen-
trated on analysis of the spatial-temporal variability of polar climate instead of
exaggerated attention to unfounded simpliﬁcation of the situation as manifesting
itself through a homogeneous anthropogenic enhancement of climate warming in
high latitudes. In this context, of great interest are new results of the paleoclimatic
analysis of an ice core from the station “Vostok” (Vakulenko et al. 2004), which
demonstrated a negative correlation between changes of CO2 concentration in the
atmosphere and air temperature. Paleoclimatic developments become a more and
more actual way to study the laws of present climate dynamics (Widmann et al. 2004).
From the data on the Antarctic discussed in the report (Levinson and Waple
2004), it follows that the last decade in this region was anomalously cold. From the
late 1970s to the mid-winter of 1990, the sea ice cover extent round the Antarctic
continent was growing.

The monograph of Filatov (2004) dedicated to studies of climate of Karelia can
serve an example of the informational analysis of the regional features of climate. New
developments dedicated to the climate of cities (Mayers 2004) and analysis of indi-
vidual long series of meteorological observations (Alessio et al. 2004; Garcia-Barrón
and Pita 2004) have made an important contribution to studies of regional climate
change. A new important stage in comprehending the data of empirical diagnostics of
climate was the development and application of interactive models of climate system
and an ensemble approach to numerical climate modeling.
There exist many climate models which are differed between them by spatial
resolution, input information, conditions of use, and by algorithms. For example, in
Java Climate Model climate change is inﬂuenced by complex interlinked processes.
This interactive model lets you explore the system and how we can change it, simply
by adjusting with your mouse parameters and observing the effect instantly on diverse
plots ranging from socioeconomic drivers to climate impacts. The core science cal-
culation methods are calibrated to be consistent with results from the Intergovern-
mental Panel on Climate Change, implemented efﬁciently in the java language, to
enable anybody to access this tool via the internet and explore diverse scenarios and
the sensitivity of projections to risk/value assessment and scientiﬁc uncertainties.
As has been repeatedly emphasized, the interactive components of the present
climate system include a broad spectrum of natural and natural-anthropogenic sub-
systems and processes, without a complex study of which, it is impossible to
reliably select prevailing trends in climate change. In this connection, one should
enumerate the most important ones:
• Global water cycle. Effect of “cloud” feedbacks.
• Global carbon cycle. Interaction of water and carbon cycles.
• Land use and land surface changes.
• Present trends of the GHGs content in the atmosphere and mechanisms of their
control.
• Interaction of climate and land ecosystems’ productivity.
• Effect of the climate regime shifts on marine ecosystems.
• Control of natural resourcesNatural to neutralize negative consequences of
humans’ activity.
• Socio-economic aspects of ecodynamics and climate and their analysis for
optimization of land use strategy.
• Interactions between processes in the geosphere and biosphere and their
dependence of cosmic impacts.
5.4.2 Climate Change, Forests, and Agriculture
Forest and agriculture ecosystems are the environmental components most sensitive
to climate change. The former, determine many characteristics of biogeochemical
cycles of GHGs, and the latter form the man-environment interaction. Problems

appearing here are thoroughly studied within many international programmes on
the environment and climate. Especially, they are emphasized in the national pro-
grammes of the USA. In particular, analysis of consequences with the use of
various scenarios of possible changes of global climate has led to the conclusion
that in the case of several scenarios, the impact on forestry and agriculture in the
USA will be economically favourable. Partially, it is connected with the growth of
forests productivity (due to the growth of CO2 concentration) and determined by the
ability of forests to adapt to climate change. As for agriculture, according to
available prognostic estimates for the period up to 2060, the positive impact of the
process of global warming on agriculture in the USA will be less economically
favourable than it follows from the earlier estimates.
Unfortunately, in view of the global and poorly studied character of correlation
between climate change and behaviour of vegetation cover (forest ecosystems, in
particular) at present there are no reliable estimates of the consequences of climate
change for their productivity. The study of the problems appearing here has been
just started.
One of the principal aspects of the anthropogenic impact on the environment is
the evaluation of the consequences of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. The
published results estimating the greenhouse effect and excess CO2 distribution in
the biosphere, which bear on this problem, are widely varying and sometimes
contradictory or else they are too ﬂatly stated. This is a natural consequence of all
kinds of simpliﬁcations adopted in modeling the global CO2 cycle. The GIMS
makes it possible to create an effective monitoring system allowing the estimation
of the spatial distribution of the carbon sinks and sources in real time.
Before this, some problems should be solved to assess the role of the anthro-
pogenic use of the Earth’s surface. In particular, among these problems there is the
problem of the formalized description of the processes of change of the structure of
the Earth land covers, such as afforestation, forest reconstruction, deforestation and
the associated carbon supplies. Understanding of the meteorological processes as
functions of the greenhouse gases is one of the key problems of humankind in the
ﬁrst decade of the third Millennium. Only an adequate knowledge of the meteo-
rological phenomena on various spatial-temporal scales under conditions of varying
supplies of CO2 and other greenhouse gases will enable one to make correct and
constructive decisions in the ﬁeld of global environmental protection.
The dynamics of the surface ecosystems depends on interactions between bio-
geochemical cycles, which during the last decade of the 20th century suffered
signiﬁcant anthropogenic modiﬁcation, especially to the cycles of carbon, nitrogen,
and water. The surface ecosystems, in which carbon remains in the living biomass,
decomposing organic matter, and the soil, play an important role in the global CO2
cycle. Carbon exchanges between these reservoirs and the atmosphere take place
through photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition, and burning. Human interfer-
ence into this process takes place through changing the structure of the vegetation
covers, pollution of the water basin surfaces and of the soil areas, as well as through
direct emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere.
5.4
Interactive Components of Climate System
407

The role of various ecosystems in the formation of carbon supplies to the bio-
spheric reservoirs determines the rate and direction of changes to the regional
meteorological situations and to the global climate. The accuracy of assessment of
the level of these changes depends on the reliability of the data on the inventory of
the surface ecosystems.
Existing environmental data show that knowledge of the rates and trends of
carbon accumulation in the surface ecosystems are rather uncertain. However, it is
clear that the surface ecosystems are important assimilators of excess CO2.
Understanding the details of such assimilation, is only possible through modeling
the process of plant growth; that is, considering the effect of the nutrient elements of
the soil and other biophysical factors on plant photosynthesis. Therefore, the forest
ecosystems and associated processes of natural afforestation, forest reconstruction,
and deforestation should be studied in detail. In a forested area, the volume of the
reservoir of CO2 from the atmosphere is a function of the density of the forest
canopy, and in a given period of time a change of this volume is determined by the
level and character of the dynamic processes of transition of one type of forest into
another. The causes of this transition can be natural, anthropogenic, or mixed.
Biocenology tries to create a universal theory of such transitions, but so far there is
only a qualitative description of the observed transitions.
Let us return brieﬂy to the problem of anthropogenic changes of the structure of
forest ranges. In the Kyoto Protocol its solution is connected with the problem of
deﬁnition of such notations as forest, afforestation, tree planting, deforestation,
biome, surface cover, land use, degradation, etc. Anyhow, a question arises here: to
what extent is the use of either deﬁnition justiﬁed at making a decision and how
does the result of its realization depend on their quality? The Kyoto Protocol not
only does not answer this question, it even does not put it. In this respect, Table 5.9
is demonstrative and serves the basis for drawing various conclusions. In fact, a
huge range of uncertainty exists here due to which the processes of afforestation and

deforestation cannot be estimated uniquely. Clearly, a single correct way to solve
the principal problem and the respective partial problems is to make a detailed
inventory of the forest ranges and to use the obtained data in the global model. The
speciﬁc features of this inventory should be determined in an adaptive regime of
using the model, gradually changing the spatial-temporal scales, starting from the
known model with a mean-annual time step and the one of geographical grids
4° × 5°, 1° × 1° or 0.5° × 0.5°.
5.4.3 Observational Data
Analysis of observational data is reduced, as a rule, to the consideration of two
categories of information:
(1) SAT changes for the last 1.5 century (and especially during the last 20–
30 years, when an increase of the global mean annual mean SAT was at a
maximum).
(2) Paleoclimatic changes. They attract attention from the viewpoint of their
comparison with present climatic trends and, to some extent, as an analog to
possible climate change in the future (such attempts are being continued,
though inadequacy of paleoanalogs for future climate forecast has been
repeatedly and convincingly argumented).
By deﬁnition, climate is characterized by values of meteorological parameters
averaged over 30 years (so, for instance, climate anomalies in 2010 are determined
as deviations from averages over the period 1981–2010). An analysis of the spatial-
temporal climate variability for individual years is also widely practiced. In par-
ticular, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) publishes annual surveys
of global climate. In these reports attempts are being made to answer the most
important questions:
• Does a climate warming take place?
• Is the moisture cycle intensity changing?
• Is the general circulation of the atmosphere and ocean changing?
• Do extreme climate changes (storms, droughts, ﬂoods) intensify?
• Is a reliable estimate of the anthropogenic contribution to climate change
possible?
The decade of the 1990s, on the whole, was the warmest over the whole period
of meteorological observations (beginning from 1860), and the year 1999 was the
ﬁfth year by the level of anomalies of the global mean annual mean SAT (+0.33 °C)
for the period 1860–1999 (also the ﬁfth was the average SAT anomaly (+0.45 °C)
in the Northern Hemisphere, but in the Southern Hemisphere it was only the tenth
(+0.20 °C)).
The band of maximum annual mean SAT extended from the continent of North
America eastward across the Atlantic Ocean and the Eurasian continent to the
5.4
Interactive Components of Climate System
409

equatorial band of the western sector of the Paciﬁc Ocean. Minimum SAT anom-
alies were observed in a broad band of the central and north-eastern regions of the
Paciﬁc Ocean (including a decrease of SAT). An analysis of observational data
revealed the prevailing of positive temperature anomalies in 1999 in many regions
of the globe. The most apparent anomalous situations include both warming and
cooling, including:
(1) The cold wave observed in January has brought a SAT decrease in Norway,
Sweden, and in some regions of Russia to the levels not observed since the late
19th century.
(2) A temperature decrease in February in Western Europe was followed, in
particular, by heavy snowfalls in the Alps.
(3) In Western Australia the SAT decreased to values below the norm, though an
extreme warming in early January has led to intensive brush ﬁres.
(4) The March temperature in Iceland was at a minimum for the last 20 years.
(5) In April, powerful heat waves formed in the northern and central regions of
India, and in July and August—in the north-eastern and middle-western
regions of the USA.
(6) Unusually hot and dry weather was observed in the western part of Russia
(SAT anomalies in the central and north-western regions of the European
territory of Russia exceeded 5 °C).
7) On the Australian continent, maximum average SAT in November—
December turned out to be the lowest after 1950.
(8) The second half of the year was colder (than usual) in central and southern
Africa; the Sahel region was colder, wetter, and with more clouds than during
the preceding years.
(9) The warming in the USA during the last 50 years was weaker than over the
rest of the globe, with a weak cooling in the eastern part of the USA.
The land and ocean surface temperature decrease in the tropics in 1999 was
determined by the year-long La Niña event. This year was characterized by a great
number of destructive meteorological catastrophes, especially ﬂoods. In Australia,
USA, and Asia there was a multitude of tropical storms, in Europe—heavy
snowfalls, avalanches, and storms; in the USA—the drought and tornado.
The global mean annual SAT value in the late 20th century exceeded by more
than 0.6 °C the value recorded in the late 19th century (the error of this estimate
±0.2 °C corresponds to a 95 % conﬁdence level). Analysis of the SAT observational
data suggested the conclusion that from the beginning of 1850, there has been an
irregular but substantial trend of climate warming on a global scale. This trend was
very weak in the period from the mid-19th century till 1910, and then it increased to
0.1 °C during 10 years (from combined data on SAT and SST in the period 1910–
1940 and during the last two decades). Two positive episodes of cooling were
separated by the interval of a weak cooling, especially in the Northern Hemisphere.
In the periods from 1951–1960 to 1981–1990 the sign of the inter-hemispherical
difference of temperatures changed: the Northern Hemisphere became colder than
the Southern Hemisphere.

Ecoinformatics Problems of Global Climate Change

As Moron et al. (1998) noted, the present global warming was considered by
some specialists as connected with sudden changes in the region of the Paciﬁc
Ocean about 1976 or with a gradual warming of the tropical band of the Paciﬁc
Ocean as well as with other regional-scale phenomena. The irregular trend men-
tioned above and an attempt to recognize the external forcings on it (anthropogenic
or natural), complicated by the presence of the internally determined variability of
the climate system, have been traditionally based on the interpretation of the trend
as red noise (or, later, on the idea that the trend’s variability is determined by that it
is regularly “immersed” in noise).
The existence of such regularities has been well established and ascribed mainly
(if not completely) to instability of the interactive “atmosphere-ocean” system in the
tropical Paciﬁc Ocean. Periodicities of about 4–6 years and 2–3 years connected
with the ENSO event have been detected. Such regularities on scales of decadal and
inter-decadal variability were more difﬁcult to detect in view of insufﬁcient length
of the observation series (Krapivin and Nitu 2009).
In this connection, Moron et al. (1998) undertook a detailed analysis of all
available data on the spatial-temporal variability of the SAT ﬁelds of the World
Ocean and for its individual regions with the use of a multi-channel singular
spectral analysis (MSSA). The main goal of analysis was to detect the laws of
variability and inter-basin relationships between SST on time scales from inter-
annual to inter-decadal. The length of observational data series was sufﬁcient for a
reliable analysis of SST variability on time scales 2–15 years, though the statistical
reliability of results for longer periods is more difﬁcult to guarantee.
In view of a great interest in SST variability in the Atlantic Ocean, the major
attention was given to this region. The strongest climatic signal was an irregular
long-term SST trend. The use of the MSSA method for data processing for the 20th
century revealed the well-known regularities mentioned above: a gradual increase
of SST in both hemispheres in 1910-1940, with the subsequent increase of SST in
the Northern Hemisphere till the mid-1950s; but a lower SST in the Southern
Hemisphere; northern hemisphere ocean cooling in the 1960s until the end of the
1970s; and an initial stability and then increase of SST in both hemispheres in the
1980s with a small weakening of this trend during the last years.
An insufﬁcient length of the series of instrumental observations makes impos-
sible to interpret the enumerated global laws as a manifestation of more or less
monotonic increase of SST or as part of long-tern centennial oscillations (according
to indirect data, oscillations were observed with periods from 65 to 500 years).
Possible external factors of variability include: the growth of CO2 concentration,
change of extra-atmospheric insolation, volcanic eruptions. A new and surprising
result was a detection of the fact that a large-scale warming and cooling was
preceded by the same SST variability near the southern edge of Greenland and
(soon after that) in the central part of the Paciﬁc Ocean in the Northern Hemisphere.
This reﬂects an important role of high-latitude processes in the North Atlantic and
possible interaction (via the atmosphere) with the Paciﬁc Ocean.
On time scales of about decadal variability (7–12 years) there have not been
observed any regular oscillations, which are coherent on global scales. In the
5.4

411

Northern Atlantic, there were 13–15-year and 90-year oscillations. Near Cape
Hatteras there were inter-decadal oscillations which propagated along Gulf-stream
to the zone of the North Atlantic, where their phases change (similar results
obtained earlier were rather contradictory). In the context of the search of inter-
decadal oscillations of ENSO the data considered did not reveal any substantial
maximum of SST variability with periods longer than 10 years in either the Paciﬁc
Ocean or the whole World Ocean, but in the Indian Ocean there were observed 20-
year SST oscillations, especially regular during the ﬁrst half of the 20th century
(oscillations of this kind have been observed earlier).
Analysis of 7–8-year oscillations revealed the contradictory character of their
phase in the sub-tropical and sub-polar cycles of the North Atlantic. As for the inter-
annual variability (2–6 years), three dominating periods were recorded: 24–30, 40,
and 60–65 months. The ﬁrst period is a well known quasi-biannual ENSO com-
ponent which most strongly manifests itself in the tropics of the eastern sector of the
Paciﬁc Ocean, with anomalies of the constant sign propagating along the western
coastline of North and South America (in other oceans such a variability is negli-
gibly small).
An important new result consists in detection of two clearly differing low-
frequency modes of oscillation, combined by the common physical nature of the
quasi-four-year mode and characterized by a drastic change of periodicity in 1960—
from *5 years to almost 4 years. This set of observational data suggests the con-
clusion that the ENSO irregularity occurs due to interaction of the internal instability
of the atmosphere-ocean system in the tropical Paciﬁc Ocean with the annual change.
Since the mode of quasi-biannual oscillations exists also in other oceans, but does not
correlate practically with the index of the southern oscillations, one should assume
that a stronger quasi-four-year signal forming here can remotely propagate beyond the
Paciﬁc Ocean, whereas the opposite process is practically impossible.
A weak oscillation with periods about 28–30 months is observed in the SST ﬁeld
in the SH Atlantic Ocean and agrees with the Hermanito event observed earlier,
which is, probably, an ENSO analog. The results discussed are a stage of devel-
opments, aimed at comparison of numerical modeling results with the data of
observations using the 2- and 3-D models of the atmosphere-ocean system.
An important contribution into the idea of SST changes in the past has been
made by analysis of the data of temperature observations in boreholes. So, for
instance, Bodri and Čermák (1999) noted that while the amplitude of long-term
SAT changes in transitions from glaciations to inter-glacial periods reached
10–15 K, during the Holocene (the last 10–14 thousand years) changes of the order
of several degrees K took place on time scales from decades to several centuries. In
this connection, an analysis has been made of the data on the vertical proﬁles of
temperature, measured at different depths in bore-holes on the territory of the
Czechia and maps were drawn of SAT changes on the territory of Czechia taking
place

Huang et al. (2000) discussed the results of processing the data on temperature
measured at different depths in 616 bore-holes in the Southern Hemisphere, which
412

has opened up possibilities to retrieve the change of global mean temperature for
ﬁve centuries. The data for 479 holes revealed the global warming by about 1.0 K
taking place during the last ﬁve centuries. Only during the 20th century, the
warmest one, an increase of the continents’ surface temperature reached 0.5 K
(about 80 % of climate warming fell on the 19th–20th centuries). The warming
during the ﬁve centuries had been stronger in the Northern Hemisphere (1.1 K) than
in the Southern Hemisphere (0.8 K). On the whole, the results obtained agree
with conclusions drawn on the basis of data on tree rings, though the latter
demonstrate a weaker centennial SAT trend, which can be explained by special
features of dendroclimatic methods.
Analysis of paleo-information on SAT obtained from the data on oxygen iso-
topes in Greenland ice cores for the Quaternary period has shown that long-term
temperature changes are superimposed by faster changes on time scales from
millennium to 10 years (Bowen 2000). An analysis of the Antarctic ice cores
revealed similar changes. In particular, in both polar regions, substantial changes of
temperature had taken place in the period of Holocene.
The data on plankton foraminifera Neogloboquadrina pachyderma from the
north-eastern region of the Atlantic (west of Ireland) made it possible to retrieve the
SST and trace the Heinrich events connected with icebergs’ outbrakes.
Information on the content of carbon dioxide and methane in air bubbles con-
tained in ice cores reﬂects an important role of those MGCs in climate formation.
For instance, it was shown that during four interglacial periods temperature in the
Antarctic had changed about 4,000 years earlier than changes of CO2 concentration.
New results of numerical modeling of the dynamics of the El Niño event caused
by variations of the orbital parameters, have satisfactorily followed “Milankowich”
frequencies during the last 150,000 years as well as variations on a time scale of
about a millennium (Morén and Påsse 2001). However, most surprising was a
detection of climate variations with the period of 1,450 years from different data for
different regions of the globe, which had regularly repeated, in particular, in
Greenland during the last 110,000 years, including the last glaciation and Holocene
(an increase of the amplitude of such changes was observed in the periods of
glaciation). These results reﬂect a radical reorganization of the climate system
taking place during comparatively short time periods. Holocene looked (compared
with these changes) like a period of comparatively stable climate. There is no doubt
that in the absence of climatic feedbacks, the growth of GHGs concentration in the
atmosphere should bring forth a climate warming. However, a real situation turns
out to be much more complicated, and to understand it, a reliable detection and
quantitative estimates of the role of feedbacks are needed. Otherwise, a reliable
forecast of climate change in the future is impossible. Since one of the very
important sources of respective information is peat-bogs, they should be thoroughly
protected.
Having analyzed the data of satellite observations of SST started from 1982,
Strong et al. (2000) noted a warming over most of the tropics and in mid-latitudes
of the Northern Hemisphere (with the global mean trend +0.005 °C per year not
exceeding the limits of observation errors). Less representative SH SST data reﬂect
5.4

the existence of the opposite cooling trend (the problem of SST data reliability
needs serious attention).
According to the data of Levitus et al. (2000), during the last 50 years (1948–
1998) the World Ocean has substantially warmed. The upper 300-m layer has
warmed most (by 0.31 °C, on the average), whereas the temperature of the 3-km
layer increased by 0.06 °C. This increase of the temperature of the upper layer of
the ocean had preceded the SAT increase started in 1970.
Satellite data on the sea ice cover extent are important as an indicator of the
global climate dynamics. Gloersen et al. (1999) detected a statistically substantial
decrease of the global area of sea ice, constituting (−0.01 ± 0.003) 106 km2 per
10 years.
Microwave remote sensing data is quite special, analysis of which has not
revealed any substantial changes of average temperature of the lower troposphere
during the last decades. This is conﬁrmed also by results of aerologic soundings.
From the data of Woodcock (1999a, b), the global mean SAT in October 1999 was
0.2 °C below the average value for the period 1979–1999. The earth’s average
temperature rose by 0.8 °C during the last century. That change is in the mean
global temperature that has been calculated for each year since 1880. The history of
average global temperature is based on data gathered around the world at weather
stations, on ships and by satellites. Despite the overall increase, global temperatures
have not climbed steadily during the decades. The average global annual temper-
ature hovered around 13.7 °C from the 1880s through the 1910s. During the 1920s–
1940s, temperatures climbed about 0.1 °C each decade. The mean global temper-
atures were then stabilized at roughly 14.0 °C until the 1980s. The world has mainly
grown hotter since 1980, at a rate of nearly 0.2 °C per decade. The annual global
temperature from 2000 to 2009 was 0.61 °C higher than the average temperature for
1951–1980. If the current rate of increase continues, the world will warm by 2 °C in
the next century. The years 2010–2013 were warmest in the GISS analysis:
• The global land and ocean surface temperature (land and ocean) for 2010 tied
(with 2005) as the warmest of the 131-year record.
• The year 2010 was also the wettest year on record, globally, in terms of pre-
cipitation measured. Precipitation in 2010 was much more variable than tem-
perature on smaller scales (region-to-region and even within regions). This is
typical of any year.
• The year 2010 tied with 2005 in all three global-scale components: the global
land temperature, the global ocean temperature, and the global land and ocean
surface temperature.
• The year 2010 was the 34th consecutive year with a global temperature above
the 20th century average. The last year with a global temperature below the
average was 1976.
• December was the 310th consecutive month with a global temperature above the
20th century average. The last month with below average temperatures was
February 1985.

• March, April and May of 2010 were each the warmest on record (for the month).
This ties 2010 with 1998, as the years with the most such “warmest months” on
record, with three each.
• The current 2012 global average temperature is 14.45 °C. This is 0.45 ± 0.10 °C
above the 1961–1990 average.
Santer et al. (2000) have discussed the causes of different trends of SAT and the
lower troposphere temperature. Having analyzed the SAT data for the periods
1925–1944 and 1978–1999, Delworth and Knutson (2000) came to the conclusion
that the main cause of SAT changes was a combined impact of anthropogenic RF
and unusually substantial many-decadal internal variability of the climate system.
An important indicator of climate dynamics can be satellite data on changes of
the balance of the mass of Greenland glaciers. Results of laser altimetry in northern
Greenland, for the period 1994–1999, show that, on the whole, at altitudes above
2 km the ice sheet was balanced, with local changes of different signs. A decrease of
the glacier’s thickness dominated at low altitudes, exceeding 1 m per year, which is
enough to raise the World Ocean level by 0.13 mm per year (this is equivalent to
about 7 % of the observed rise of the ocean’s level).
The data of observations of the moisture cycle parameters still remain frag-
mentary. An exception are publications such as Russo et al. (2000), in which an
analysis has been made at the Observatory of the Genoa University of the change of
the diurnal sum of precipitation for 1833–1985, and a decrease of the quantity of
rainy days for the whole period of observations has been revealed, as well as a
considerable growth of rain rate starting from 1950. During the last 30 years there
was a considerable increase of the number of days with intensive precipitation.
Yu et al. (1999) performed an analysis of available climate data on the heat
balance of the atmosphere with the use of results of both observations and calcu-
lations. The atmospheric radiation budget was found from the data of satellite
observations of the ﬂuxes of outgoing shortwave and longwave radiation and
radiation ﬂuxes at surface level retrieved from satellite data. Quantities of turbulent
heat ﬂuxes at surface level were taken from the data of observations within the
COADS programme, and the horizontal heat transport was calculated with the use
of the respective meteorological information. To minimize random errors, the
spatial-temporal averaging was made: the zonally averaged components of the
atmospheric heat balance components for the latitudinal band 50°N—50°S, as well
as values for this latitudinal band have been considered.
An analysis of the data discussed has shown that it is impossible to close the
atmospheric heat balance: additional 20 W m−2 are needed. Attempts to use dif-
ferent versions of the input volumes of information did not help to remove this
“disbalance”. Since the closing of water vapour balance with the use of the same
data was successful, one can assume that the cause of this “disbalance” is an
inadequacy of estimates of the atmospheric radiation budget, manifesting though
underestimated solar radiation absorbed by the atmosphere.
Having analyzed the completeness and reliability of the available data of climatic
observations, Folland et al. (2000) have come to the conclusion that the existing
5.4
Interactive Components of Climate System
415

volume and quality of data make it impossible to give adequate answers to the ques-
tions enumerated above. In this connection, anxiety is aroused because of the degra-
dation of the systems of conventional meteorological observations, taking place during
the last decades, which are of importance also for calibration of the satellite remote
sensing results. Therefore, even calculations of decadal mean values of climate
parameters are difﬁcult for some regions of Africa and vast regions of the World Ocean.
Discussing the observed regularities of global climate change with time and its
causes, Wallace (1998) noted the ﬁrst-priority to consider the following problems:
(1) periodic climate change due to variations of extra-atmospheric solar radiation;
(2) quasi-periodic climate variability (its most vivid manifestation—quasi-bien-
nial oscillations in the equatorial stratosphere);
(3) ENSO event (in view of a wide range of frequencies, this event cannot be
considered quasi-periodic);
(4) inter-decadal climate variations, which are to a great extent determined by the
internal intra-seasonal and intra-annual variability of the climate system;
(5) climate variability on time scales from inter-decadal to centennial;
(6) analysis of statistical signiﬁcance of estimates of unprecedented events and
“shifts of regimes” in the light of time-dependent series of many climatic
parameters; and
(7) revealing the phase relationships between climate change on tine scales from
inter-annual to inter-decadal.
An important fact is that most of climate variability can be described by a
separate consideration of dependencies on time and space coordinates. In view of
an exceptional complexity of the climate system, with its numerous degrees
of freedom and a multitude of feedbacks, highly regular structures and modes
of climate evolution can be rather an exception than a rule. “Rough” schemes of
parametrization for reconstructing the structure and evolution of climate anomalies
without superﬂuous detail should have a higher degree of stability. Important cli-
matic “signals” considered in solving the problems of detection and forecast of
global climate change should be seen “with the naked eye”. A much more com-
plicated problem than usually supposed is an assessment of statistical signiﬁcance
of some quantitative characteristics of climate variability, especially unprecedented
events and “shifts of regime” from the data on time series of limited duration (as a
rule, in view of time-dependence of such series).
Apparently, one of the perspective directions of studies of climatic time-
dependence and related catastrophic events of the type of the tropical storm Katrina,
which 13 years after Hurricane Andrew was the most powerful in the history of
Miami (Florida), caused the USA a huge economic damage, completely sub-
merging New Orleans and ruining a huge amount of constructions in late August
2005, is a search of connections between temperature variations of different scales
in different water bodies of the World Ocean. For instance, Chang et al. (2000) and
Yamagata et al. (2004) have shown that there is a stable correlation between
changes of water surface temperature in the Indian and Paciﬁc Oceans, which
especially strongly manifest themselves in the season of monsoons in the Indian
416

Ocean basin. The ENSO event favouring the propagation of the sub-tropical anti-
cyclone over the Western Paciﬁc plays a marked role in stirring up of feedback
mechanisms. Studies of appearing correlations are successfully carried out with the
use of an interactive ensemble CGCM developed at the Centre for Ocean-Land-
Atmosphere Studies (COLA).
A new method to simulate and diagnose the observed climate variability has
been developed by Schneider (2006). A method, which can be used to retrospec-
tively simulate and understand the evolution of surface temperature using reanalysis
surface ﬂuxes and a coupled GCM, has been developed. The method has two parts:
(1) weather noise surface ﬂuxes are extracted from the reanalysis surface ﬂuxes by
removing the ensemble mean response of an AGCM ensemble to the observed
surface temperature evolution; and
(2) an interactive ensemble (IE) CGCM (an ensemble of atmospheric models
coupled to a single OGCM) is then forced by this noise.
The IE CGCM will reproduce the observed surface temperature evolution up to
errors in the model, the reanalysis surface ﬂuxes, and the ocean initial state given
certain conditions. These conditions are that there is no internal ocean “weather
noise” or coupled instabilities. External forcing must also be taken into account
properly (Schneider et al. 2009; Despres et al. 1986).
In the Paciﬁc Ocean there are two key regions which play an important role in
variability of the upper water layer temperature. These are western and central
sectors of the northern Paciﬁc Ocean. Changes taking place here affect the climatic
situation in many regions of Asia and in more remote areas (Nakamura and
Yamagata 1997). Therefore, study of complicated climatic situations in the Paciﬁc
region is important for detection of latent dependences between stimulators of
global climate change in the future (Timmermann et al. 1999).
The Secretariat of the Paciﬁc Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) has
been designated by Paciﬁc heads of government as the lead agency to coordinate
the region’s response to this challenge. Climate change is already disproportion-
ately affecting the islands of the Paciﬁc. Although islanders have done little to
contribute to the cause—less than 0.03 % of current global greenhouse gas emis-
sions—they are among the ﬁrst to be affected. Most islands are experiencing cli-
mate change impacts on communities, infrastructure, water supply, coastal and
forest ecosystems, ﬁsheries, agriculture, and human health. The consequences of
sea level rise, sea temperature increases, ocean acidiﬁcation, altered rainfall
patterns, and overall temperature rise will be increasingly felt (Faletau et al. 2012).
5.4.4 Climate-Forming Factors
Discussing the prospects of developments within the CLIVAR program of study of
climate variability, Bolin (1999) emphasized that “IPCC was very careful in its
assessments in order to stick to conclusions known from scientiﬁc literature, which
5.4
Interactive Components of Climate System
417

serve the basis for such assessments. The key fact is that it is necessary to distin-
guish between something that can be considered real and which remains uncertain.
As for the future climate forecasts, many uncertainties still remain. This approach
has determined the conﬁdence in scientiﬁc community when making concrete
decisions and should be preserved in future”.
Bolin (1999) emphasized that though the IPCC-1995 assessment report contains
the statement that global climate change taking place in the 20th century is partially
determined by humans’ activity, this conclusion was formulated very carefully. An
evaluation of the probable contribution of random climate variations independent of
humans’ impact in this context was of principal importance. Results of recent
studies have clariﬁed this question, showing that random variations of global mean
SAT on time scales from decades to centuries for the last 600 years were within
±0.2 °C or less (this conclusion, as has been mentioned above, disagrees with data
of observations from which it follows that SAT changed in the past in wider limits).
In this connection (as Bolin (1999) believes), the skeptics about estimates of the
contribution of anthropogenic warming for the last 50–75 years should be asked
how one can explain a much stronger global warming observed during the last
decades.
In reports of ofﬁcial representatives of several countries at Conferences in Kyoto
and Buenos Aires and in mass media, weather and climate anomalies like tropical
hurricanes and unusual El Niño were ascribed to the impacts of global warming.
These opinions should, however, be thoroughly tested scientiﬁcally, though a
possibility of more frequent anomalous events under conditions of global warming
is not excluded. Therefore, especially urgent becomes the development of methods
of climate forecasts on regional scales, bearing in mind, ﬁrst of all, the period of
2008–2012.
In Bolin’s (1999) opinion, to assess the socio-economic consequences of the
accomplishment of measures foreseen by the Kyoto Protocol on GHGs emissions
reduction, it is very important to develop integral models—a combination of
models of climate, carbon cycle, as well as power engineering and socio-economic
development, which will require much more time and much effort. In this respect, a
difﬁcult problem is to validate such models in order to analyze their reliability. The
absence of an adequate validation means that the results of numerical modeling
with the use of integral models can be considered only as possible scenarios but not
forecasts.
Characterizing the climatic forcings, Hansen et al. (1998, 1999) pointed out that
they are still not determined with an accuracy that is sufﬁcient for reliable climate
forecasts. There is reliable information about the GHGs content in the atmosphere,
which determines a positive RF, but serious difﬁculties are connected with
assessments of the impacts caused by such factors as atmospheric aerosol, clouds,
land use change, causing a negative RF, which determines a partial compensation of
the “greenhouse” climate warming. One of the consequences of this compensation
consists in a much more signiﬁcant role of changes of extra-atmospheric insolation
(solar constant—SC) as a climate-forming factor than it was supposed earlier, based
on numerical modeling with only GHGs contribution taken into account (the
418

“greenhouse” RF due to the growth of CO2 concentration in the period from the
beginning of the industrial revolution to nowadays was estimated at about
1.5 W m−2).
In connection with these circumstances, Hansen et al. (1998, 1999) obtained new
estimates of global mean RF. The data in Table 5.10 characterize the results of
analytical approximation (with an error of about 10 %) of various components of the
“greenhouse” RF (the recent detection of SF5CF3 as a substantial GHG shows that
the problem of substantiation of GHG priority cannot be considered resolved
completely). The GHG concentrations are expressed in ppm (CO2, c); ppb (CH4, m);
ppb (CFC-11, x; CFC-12, y); CFC—chloroﬂuoroorganic compounds (freons). The
total RF value is 2.3 ± 0.25 W m−2. The fact that the rate of RF increased from 0.01
to 0.04 W m−2 per year over the period 1950–1970, during subsequent 20 years
decreased down to 0.03 W m−2 per year, in connection with the decreasing rate of the
growth of CO2 concentration (despite the continuing growth of CO2 emissions), is of
great interest, although the reasons remaining unclear. A certain contribution was
made also by the reduction of the growth of CO2 concentration, but also for
unknown reasons.
The RF due to the growing concentration of tropospheric ozone was estimated at
0.4 ± 0.15 W m−2. A drop of stratospheric ozone could result in the RF equal to
−0.2 ± 0.1 W m−2. Although these changes of the sign are mutually partly com-
pensated, it does not mean their insigniﬁcance, since variations of the ozone content
in the troposphere and stratosphere affect substantially and in a different way the
formation of the vertical proﬁle of temperature.
As for the RF due to aerosol, its determination is still unreliable for lack of
adequate information on the real atmospheric aerosol. A numerical modeling, with
anthropogenic sulphate, organic, and soil aerosol taken into account (with a latent
consideration of soot aerosol by prescribed realistic aerosol absorption), for pre-
scribed global distributions of aerosol optical thickness has made it possible to
evaluate the global distributions of RF and balanced surface temperature, and then
to obtain respective global mean values of changes of RF (ΔF) and surface tem-
perature (ΔTs) for purely scattering aerosol (single scattering albedo ω = 1) and
more realistic aerosol (Table 5.11).

Hansen et al. (1998) noted that most reliable value of total RF due to aerosol
constitutes −0.4 ± 0.3 W m−2 instead of the value −0.54 given in Table 5.6, though
in any case this estimate remains very uncertain due to unreliable input data on
aerosol properties.
Anthropogenic RF changes due to clouds are undouptedly more substantial than
those due to aerosol, but they are even more uncertain. Such changes (including the
impact of aircraft contrails) mainly result from the indirect impact of anthropogenic
aerosol, which causes (functioning as condensation nuclei) variations of cloud
droplets size distribution and optical properties. Rough estimates give the “cloud” RF
from −1 to −1.5 W m−2, but it can change by an order of magnitude (depending on
prescribed input parameters). Conditional value 1þ0:5
1 W m−2 can be assumed. Some
increase of cloud amount observed in the 20th century may be attributed to indirect
impact of aerosol. Speciﬁcation of the obtained estimates requires an accomplishment
of complex observational programmes in different regions of the globe.
The contribution of land-use changes into RF variations is connected with
processes of deforestation, desertiﬁcation, and biomass burning, which affect the
surface albedo and roughness as well as evapotranspiration. It is also important that
the bare surface albedo changes more strongly being covered with snow than
vegetation. Approximate estimates of the ERB change due to land-use evolution
were −0.2 ± 0.2 W m−2.
The natural RF due to SC changes during the last century (including an indirect
impact on the ozone layer) can be assumed to equal 0.4 ± 0.2 W m−2. Since the total
RF constitutes only about 1 W m−2, the contribution of extra-atmospheric insolation
variability could play a substantial role. Volcanic eruptions cause RF changes from
0.2 to −0.5 W m−2 (these estimates are, however, conditional). For analysis of
possible anthropogenic impact on global climate, extremely important are estimates
of sensitivity of the climate system to external forcings. Hansen et al. (1998)
assumed that the change of global mean SAT at a doubled CO2 concentration
should constitute 3 ± 1 °C. Since the RF estimates are not reliable enough, it is
expedient to use different scenarios of RF change. One of the developments in this
sphere is a study of Tett et al. (1999) and IPCC (2007).
The simulations of the 19th and 20th centuries are based upon changes in long-
lived greenhouse gases (LLGHGs) that are reasonably constrained by the observa-
tional record. Therefore, the models have qualitatively similar temporal evolutions
of their radiative forcing time histories for LLGHGs (e.g., see Fig. 5.15). However,

estimates of future concentrations of LLGHGs and other radiatively active species
are clearly subject to signiﬁcant uncertainties. The evolution of these species is
governed by a variety of factors that are difﬁcult to predict, including changes in
population, energy use, energy sources and emissions. For these reasons, a range of
projections of future climate change has been conducted using coupled AOGCMs.
The future concentrations of LLGHGs and the anthropogenic emissions of sulphur
dioxide (SO2), a chemical precursor of sulphate aerosol, are obtained from several
scenarios considered representative of low, medium and high emission trajectories.
These basic scenarios and other forcing agents incorporated in the AOGCM pro-
jections, including several types of natural and anthropogenic aerosols, are discussed
in IPCC (2007).
Crowley (2000) estimated the contribution of various factors to climate forma-
tion (SAT change) for the last 1,000 years using the energy-balance climate model.
According to the results obtained:
(1) Changes of global mean SAT during the last 1,000 years may be explained as
a result of the combined impact of the known RFs (in the pre-industrial epoch
41–64 % of SAT changes had taken place due to the extra-atmospheric
insolation and volcanic activity).
(2) Global warming observed in the 20th century was mainly of anthropogenic
(“greenhouse”) origin, substantially exceeding the internally caused variability
of the climate system.
Unfortunately, the argumentation contained in the study of Crowley (2000) is
unconvincing even from the viewpoint of explanation of the centennial change of

(Watanabe et al. 2011; Takemura et al. 2005). This is an illustrative example of the forcings as
implemented and computed in one of the climate models participating in the AR4. Note that there
could be differences in the RFs among models. Most models simulate roughly similar evolution of

global mean SAT. For instance, the causes of climate cooling in the late 19th—
early 20th century have not been explained. Of course, the model considered cannot
simulate changes of regional climate. The role of North-Atlantic oscillations in
climate formation has not been revealed. On the whole, the fact that possibilities of
approximate energy-balance models do not exceed the limits of substantiation of
rather conditional scenarios of climate but cannot describe the dynamics of the real
climate system raises no doubts. This conclusion refers also to results obtained with
much more complicated global interactive climate models (Liao et al. 2011).
On the whole, global climate models (GCMs) are comprised of fundamental
concepts (laws) and parameterisations of physical, biological, and chemical com-
ponents of the climate system. These concepts and parameterisations are expressed
as mathematical equations, averaged over time and grid volumes. The equations
describe the evolution of many variables (e.g. temperature, wind speed, humidity
and pressure) and together deﬁne the state of the atmosphere. These equations are
then converted to a programming language, deﬁning among other things their
possible interacting with other formulations, so that they can be solved on a
computer and integrated forward in discrete time steps.
A very simple model of the radiative equilibrium of the Earth is:

where the left hand side represents the incoming energy from the Sun and the right

Noting that climate models with a low spatial resolution (*3°–6° lat.) cannot
reliably simulate (and, moreover, forecast) climate changes on regional scales,
Mearns et al. (1999) showed that to resolve such problems, two approaches can be
used:
(1) statistical (with regard to observational data) scaling (reducing to a higher
spatial resolution) of the numerical modeling results obtained with the help of
low-resolution models;
(2) expanding such models by including the “nested” regional models with a
higher resolution.
In this connection, Mearns et al. (1999) undertook a comparison of scenarios of
anthropogenic climate change (with a doubled CO2 concentration) calculated with
the use of the NCAR “nested” model RegCM2 and semi-empirical method of
422
5

scaling (SDS). In both cases large-scale numerical modeling was carried out with
the use of the GCM model developed in the Australian Scientiﬁc-Industrial Centre
(CSIRO).
The results obtained show that the RegCM2 model reveals a stronger spatial
variability of the ﬁelds of temperature and precipitation than the SDS model, which
leads, however, to a greater amplitude of the annual change of temperature, than the
models RegCM2 or GCM. The diurnal change of temperature turned out to be
weaker in the cases of SDS and GCM than RegCM2, and the amplitude of the
diurnal change of precipitation varied in the interval between those corresponding
to SDS and RegCM2. Calculations with RegCM2 reproduce both an increase and
decrease of probability of precipitation with a doubled CO2 concentration, whereas
SDS gave only an increase of precipitation.
One of the causes of differences mentioned above could be the fact that the semi-
empirical model SFS is based on the data that refer only to surface level 700 gPa,
whereas in two other models the vertical structure of the atmosphere is taken into
account. This comparison does not permit, however, to draw a conclusion, which of
the results obtained reﬂects “correctly” the impact of forcing. To answer this
question and establish the cause of these differences, the numerical modeling should
be further improved.
One of the important illustrations of highly uncertain theoretical estimates of the
causes of climate change is a re-assessment of the role of the “Milankowich
mechanism”, as the main factor of paleodynamics of climate observed during the
last years.
According to the Milankowich theory (Morén and Påsse 2001), changes of
paleoclimate had been determined by latitudinal re-distribution of extra-atmo-
spheric insolation and in the annual change as a result of variations of the
parameters of the Earth’s orbit (especially it refers to glacial-interglacial cycles
during the Quaternary period) which include:
(1) inclination of the rotation axis with respect to the orbital plane (ﬂuctuating
within 22–24.5° with the current estimate 23.4°; average periodicity of vari-
ations constitutes 41,000 years and affects mainly the high-latitude insolation);
(2) precession of equinoctial points affecting the time of the onset of equinoxes
and solstices, which tells mainly on low-latitude insolation (precession is
characterized by dual periodicities 19,000 and 23,000 years); and
(3) eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit which changes from almost circular to strongly
elliptical with a periodicity of about 95,800 years (these changes cause a
modulation of precession.
Milankowich supposed, in particular, that the summertime low-level insolation
in high latitudes is the cause of the onset of glaciations and formation of ice sheets.
The resulting increase of surface albedo determines the functioning of a positive
feedback which intensiﬁes the impact of insolation decrease. The summertime low-
level insolation was observed at a minimum angle of the orbit’s inclination, high
eccentricity, and at an apogee in the NH summer. According to Milankowich’s
calculations, this conﬁguration took place 185, 115, and 70 thousand years ago.
5.4

423

Although during the last years the concept of Milankowich has been acknowl-
edged (but not completely), its individual aspects have been critically analyzed.
This had two reasons:
(1) many new geological data of analysis of the cores of sea bottom rocks and ice
cores have appeared; and
(2) a considerable progress has been achieved in numerical climate modeling.
An analysis of both these sources of information has shown that an adequate
explanation of paleoclimate changes is only possible with regard for not only
variations of the orbital parameters, but also other climate-forming factors—in
particular, variations of the GHGs content in the atmosphere which include carbon
dioxide as most important.
In this connection, Palutikof et al. (1999) performed an analysis of new geo-
logical data on paleoclimate changes, with a higher temporal resolution, in the
context of present ideas of the global climate dynamics. The data of analysis of ice
cores and pollen obtained in 1990 have led to the following two important general
conclusions:
(1) part of observational data does not conﬁrm the glaciation cycles having been
determined by the Milankowich mechanism (this refers especially to data on
δ18O in calcite veins Devils Hole in the U.S.S. Nevada, which testify to
opposite phases of the cycles of glaciation and theory of Milankowich); and
(2) it follows from other data that this mechanism can explain only slow quasi-
periodic variations but not the short-term variability (on time scales from
decades to millennia), with respect to which it has turned out that it had
happened much more often than it was supposed.
This variability of the global mean temperature could reach several degrees
during several decades. In particular, a large-scale sudden climate cooling had
happened in the Ames interglacial period (*122,000 years ago), when climatic
conditions had been very close to the present ones. A typical example of a short-
term climatic variability is the Heinrich and Dansgaard/Oeshger events (Keigwin
and Boyle 2000). Such events can be repeated in the future.
Many uncertainties remain also, concerning the impacts of present changes of
extra-atmospheric insolation on climate. Soon et al. (2000) have demonstrated, for
instance, the presence of hyper-sensitivity of the climate system to changes in UV
insolation, whose effect is intensiﬁed by feedback due to statistical stability of
clouds, effect of tropical cirrus clouds, and stratospheric ozone (the “ozone-climate”
problem needs a special analysis).
An interactive consideration of the biospheric dynamics as a climate system’s
component is of particular interest. The signiﬁcance of this problem can be exem-
pliﬁed by estimates of the climatic impact of deforestation in the tropical Amazon
basin, obtained by Bunyard (1999). Nature in the Amazon basin (ﬁrst of all, wet
tropical forests WTF) performs a number of important functions, still not completely
taken into account of including the energy input from the tropics to higher latitudes,
which, however, is under threat in view of a high rate of WTF destruction.
424
5
Ecoinformatics Problems of Global Climate Change

According to present assessment, every year up to 17 million ha of tropical
forests are removed, with *6 million ha falling on the basin of Brazil Amazon. By
the end of 1988, 21 million have been deforested, and 10 years later this area
reached 27.5 million ha, which exceeds the territory of Great Britain.
The WTF destruction is important from the viewpoint of the impact on the
global carbon cycle, since there is a danger of transformation of the WTF zone from
the sink to the source of carbon for the atmosphere. Not less substantial are the
ecological aspects of WTF elimination, in view of ecological uniqueness of the
tropical forests of Central and South America. According to available estimates,
deforestation only in the basin of Brazil Amazon (over the area 360 million ha) will
result in the annual sink of carbon up to 0.56 billion t, and on global scales the level
of this source can reach 4 billion t C per year. Bearing in mind that in 1988, as a
result of forest ﬁres, the tropical forests were burned over an area of about 9 million
ha, then due to only this source the atmosphere could get 1–2 billion t C.
Over the virgin tropical forests, about 75 % of the incoming solar radiation are
spent on evapotranspiration. Therefore, removal of WTF will result in radical
changes of energy exchange and global atmospheric circulation. Changes of local
climate should be even more substantial, especially from the viewpoint of precip-
itation, which can be reduced by 65 %. Of key importance is the fact that the
threshold level of WTF elimination that determines the loss by the ecosystem of its
self-support ability, remains unclear. For instance, if it is 20 %, then this threshold
has been exceeded already.
Bengtsson (1999) drew attention to the fact that since non-linear processes
exhibit the prevailing impact on climate system’s variability, it is impossible to
establish any simple connection between external forcings (e.g., the growth of the
GHGs content or variability of extra-atmospheric insolation) and response of the
climate system to such forcings. With the unpredictability of some factors of cli-
mate taken into account, the difﬁculty of distinguishing between anthropogenic and
natural variability of climate becomes apparent and even increases due to the fact
that both internally and externally forced modes of climate variability are deter-
mined by the same mechanisms and feedbacks.
Although a considerable progress has been recently achieved in numerical
modeling of the climate system, it refers mainly to the atmosphere, which is testiﬁed
by correspondence of the results of numerical modeling of atmospheric circulation
to observational data. Results of the “ensemble” numerical experiments indicate
that the 3D atmospheric circulation in the tropics is mainly determined by the
impact of boundary conditions, whereas in high latitudes the impact of atmospheric
dynamics prevails. The simulation of water cycle in the atmospheric turned out to
be rather realistic.
A considerable progress in modeling of the interactive atmosphere-ocean system
has made it possible to successfully predict the seasonal and inter-annual variability
and, in particular, El Niño events. An adequate consideration of the processes on
land surface has ensured a substantial increase of reliability of hydrological fore-
casts (including the river run-off).
5.4

In this context, Bengtsson (1999) discussed the progress in numerical climate
modeling in three directions. A successful accomplishment of the TOGA program
has made an important contribution to provision of the transition to operational
forecasts of the seasonal and inter-annual variability considering the prescribed
SAT changes in the tropics, which has determined the critical importance of reliable
SAT data. The second of these directions is connected with numerical modeling of
climate change on scales of decades and longer and especially with explanation
of the centennial change of global mean annual mean SAT. Apparently, in the case
of long-term climatic variability the stochastic forcing can be considered as a zero
hypothesis.
A consideration of the impact of low-frequency climatic ﬂuctuations on the level
of the Caspian Sea has shown that the long-term variability of the level is connected
ﬁrst of all with SST anomalies in the eastern sector of the tropical Paciﬁc Ocean. It
turned out that positive SST anomalies correlate with enhanced precipitation in the
basin of the Volga watershed and vice versa. The main cause of variations of the
Caspian Sea level is the long-term dynamics of ENSO events, which should be
considered chaotic.
An important part of the discussed problem is the study of anthropogenic climate
change. Calculations have shown that a doubling of CO2 concentration should
result in the outgoing longwave radiation at the level of tropopause decreasing by
3.1 W m−2 and the downward longwave radiation ﬂux in the stratosphere growing
by about 1.3 W m−2. Thus the total RF at the tropospheric top level will constitute
4.4 W m−2. Calculations of the resulting SAT change with the use of 11 climate
models revealed a warming within 2.1–4.8 °C, as well as intensiﬁcation of global
mean precipitation within 1–10 %.
According to Bengtsson (1999), before 1980, the centennial change of the global
mean SAT was characterized by the prevailing contribution of natural variability
with the subsequent increase of the anthropogenic contribution. An important task
of subsequent developments is to improve the numerical modeling (ﬁrst of all, from
the viewpoint of a more adequate consideration of various mechanisms of feed-
backs) in order to provide reliable forecasts on regional and local scales. Quite an
urgent problem of global modeling consists in the interactive consideration of
biogeochemical cycles.
One of the most important aspects of numerical climate modeling is an
assessment of the contribution of anthropogenic climate-forming factors. In this
connection, Allen et al. (1999) discussed the possibilities of recognition, evaluation,
and forecast of the contribution of anthropogenic global climate change, charac-
terized by the SAT, with regard for available data of observations and numerical
modeling. The latter is carried out bearing in mind the internal variability of the
climate system, as well as the impact of the greenhouse effect (and respective
climate warming) and sulphate aerosol (the effect of climate cooling).
The four global 3D models of interactive atmosphere-ocean system predicted
an increase of the global mean SAT for the decade 2036–2046 (compared to
pre-industrial level) within 1.1–2.3 K. Calculations of the climate system sensitivity
to a doubled CO2 concentration gave values within 2.5–3.5 K. According to
426
5
Ecoinformatics Problems of Global Climate Change

HadCM2-G5 climate model developed at the Hadley Centre (Great Britain), the
global mean “greenhouse” warming in the period 1996–2004 should constitute
1.35 K, and the “sulphate” cooling will constitute 0.35 K, and thus the resulting
warming will reach 1 K.
With the anthropogenic SAT increase in the 20th century equal to 0.25–0.5 K
per 100 years, the calculations made with a simple climate model, predict the 1–2 K
uncertainty of the balanced SAT forecast by the year 2040. Such estimates can,
however, be sufﬁciently reliable only with an adequate consideration of the char-
acteristic time of the ocean’s adaptation. A critically important aspect of prognostic
estimates is a necessity to take into account possible sudden non-linear climate
changes, which seriously limits the lead time of forecasts.
The most attractive perspective for assessment and forecast of anthropogenic
SAT changes is connected with analysis of the spatial-temporal variability of the
SAT ﬁelds that takes into account the impacts of the greenhouse effect and aerosol.
Realization of this approach is seriously complicated, however, by impossibility of
reliable prescription of aerosol forcing on the SAT ﬁeld. A serious problem is also a
necessity to take into account the climatic impact of changes in the content of
stratospheric and tropospheric ozone.
5.4.5 Contradictoriness of the Climate Study Results
The problem of anthropogenic global warming is now in the centre of attention of
not only specialists but also wide circles of population. With a deeper under-
standing of this problem, there appears a feeling of inconsistency of the results
obtained in this ﬁeld, especially during the last decade. In this connection, Mahlman
(1998) carried out an overview of such results aimed at analyzing of the funda-
mental scientiﬁc aspects of the problem under discussion, in which the emphasis is
placed on the role of numerical modeling and analysis of observational data in
understanding of the present climate change. The monograph by Weber (1992) has
been dedicated to the same theme.
The main difﬁculty in understanding the causes of climate change is connected
with a still preserved impossibility of an adequate consideration of climatic feed-
backs. First of all, this refers to the cloud-radiation feedback, direct and indirect
(through the impact on radiative properties of clouds) climatic impact of atmo-
spheric aerosol as well as the impact of the atmosphere-ocean interaction on climate
formation.
The often ignored speciﬁc manifestation of the “greenhouse” climate warming is
the system’s large inertia (the thermal “memory” of deep layers of the ocean spans
centuries and even thousands of years). Schlesinger et al. (2000) pointed out,
for instance, the existence of the global SAT oscillations with a period of about
65–70 years from the observational data for the period 1858–1992. It is important
that principal differences between numerical modeling (and forecasts) of weather
and climate should be taken into account. In the case of numerical climate
5.4
Interactive Components of Climate System
427

modeling, it is important to use “tuning” and adjustment because of the difﬁculty of
an adequate consideration of a complicated totality of interactive processes and
spatial-temporal scales. In this context, the use of paleoclimatic data plays a sub-
stantial role, though they cannot be analogs to a possible climate change in the
future.
A serious anxiety has been caused by inadequacy of global observation systems
and degradation of ground observations, especially manifesting themselves in some
cases. Mahlman (1998) emphasized that the controversy of the problem of
anthropogenic climate change consists in the absence of reliable quantitative esti-
mates of relationship between the contributions of natural and anthropogenic factors
of changes. This circumstance creates serious difﬁculties in practical realization of
recommendations contained in the Kyoto Protocol.
Such conclusions, discussed in detail before, have received universal recogni-
tion, illustrated by the recent review of Grassl (2000). In this context, quite sur-
prising is the wide use of the term “climate change” as determining only the
anthropogenic change. The substitution of the notion of “climate change” (in its
true meaning) with the term “global warming”
is also incorrect, since both
observational data and the results of numerical modeling indicate a highly inho-
mogeneous present climate change, far from being reduced to only SAT increase.
Such terminological misunderstanding is not accidental, however. It is aimed at
disinformation for the sake of establishing a false conception of anthropogenic
(“greenhouse”) global warming, which has been convincingly explained by
Boehmer-Christiansen (1997, 2000), who analyzed the political motivation of this
concept. Cracknell (2009) continues of discussion about global warming.
In August 1997, the U.S. Minister of geology V. Babbitt, addressing about 3,000
participants of the annual Congress of the U.S. Ecological Society, said that they
should implement their civil obligation—help to convince skeptical American public
that global warming is both real and dangerous: “We have a scientiﬁc consensus but
we have not a public consensus”. In this connection, Morris (1997) carried out an
overview of available scientiﬁc information in order to analyze the grounds for this
opinion, since many specialists do not share the apocalyptic predictions of anthro-
pogenic global warming. The emphasis in the overview has been placed on the
problem of distinguishing between natural and anthropogenic climate change.
In the mid-1970s the forecasts of global cooling due to sulphate aerosol pre-
dicted, for instance, that this impact will limit an increase of global mean tem-
perature due to enhanced greenhouse effect of the atmosphere by less than 2 °C
even with a 8-fold increase of CO2 concentration. The warming trend observed in
the 1980s has attracted attention to the problem of climate warming. At the height
of the summer of 1988, (Hansen et al. 1988; Hansen 1998) declared at the U.S.
Congress a 99 % probability of anthropogenic global warming and its destructive
consequences for the ecosystems in the future, as well as a consensus reached
among specialists on this problem, though many meteorologists and climatologists
did not share those views: respective developments did not permit to establish
reliable cause-and-effect relationships between anthropogenic GHGs emissions and
observed the climate change.
428

Ecoinformatics Problems of Global Climate Change

The political motivation of the support to the global “greenhouse” warming
conception has determined a gigantic growth of governmental ﬁnancing of such
developments in the USA in the period 1990–1995 from 600 million dollars to
1.8 billion dollars.
In the context of contributions of different factors to the formation of global
climate, Morris (1997) emphasized an importance of the combined consideration of
contributions of the “greenhouse” warming and solar activity, which during the
period of instrumental observations constituted 0.31 and 0.41 °C, respectively.
According to these estimates, a doubling of CO2 concentration will lead to a global
warming within 1.26–1.33 °C. With such climate changes, there are no grounds to
expect often predicted catastrophic consequences, such as the rise of the World
Ocean level and an increase of epidemic diseases. However, there is no doubt that
one should expect an increase of the agricultural yield. On the whole, the climate
warming consequences should be positive. Although reliable forecasts of ecological
consequences of GHGs emissions are still impossible, it is apparent that their
reduction will strongly affect the economy. Therefore, the main conclusion which
may be made, is that one should not try to prevent still unreliably predicted climate
change but adapt to it.
In view of the climate problem complexity, relevant scientiﬁc publications
usually emphasize a serious uncertainty of the available estimates, which favours
the possibility to continue studies, but on the other hand, is fraught with serious
consequences in the context of ecological policy. As Boehmer-Christiansen (1997)
noted, “ecological” bureaucrats and experts as well as well-organized representa-
tives of the sphere of fuel-energy industry are interested in the proof of the existence
of anthropogenic warming and want to obtain the needed scientiﬁc support. These
three groups with common interests support non-governmental ecological organi-
zations and thoroughly consolidate them after the Conference in Rio.
The main target of the “green” pressure is the governmental hierarchy which, in
view of a wide range of its responsibility, as a rule, either does not want or cannot
realize the needed measures including the ecological taxes, subsidizing develop-
ment of the renewable energy sources, nuclear energy, public transport, energy
efﬁciency, and others. The World Bank (WB) and Global Ecological Fund (GEF)
are also lobbied for, to support numerous and expensive developments which are
controlled by numerous experts and specialists in the sphere of ﬁnances. These
experts are the most vigorous advocates of measures to prevent the supposed
undesirable climate change, and the WB and respective UN organizations more and
more use their recommendations, in particular, those connected with the so-called
“Joint Implementation”.
This system is based on such fundamental documents as the International
Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the scientiﬁc bases are the IPCC
reports. To achieve these goals, the following components should be provided:
science that substantiates the threats; the “green movement” that expresses emo-
tions; rhetoric and “principle of precaution”; developments of new technologies
aimed at reducing the GHGs emissions; bureaucratic bodies that prepare the needed
plans and develop strategies.
5.4
Interactive Components of Climate System
429

And only after that can politicians, who should ensure the ﬁnancial support
in order to transform plans into concrete actions, start acting. In this context,
Boehmer-Christiansen (1997) discussed various circumstances concerning “scien-
tiﬁc provision”. Clearly, the IPCC Reports may be the fundamental documents, if
anthropogenic impact on climate is really dangerous. However, the difﬁcult prob-
lem is how to determine the criteria of “danger” and who should be responsible for
it (considering also the socio-economic and political factors).
Still there are many uncertainties in this problem. In particular, in connection
with the discussion of necessity to reduce GHGs emission, the emphasis is placed
on decreasing the scale of the use of coal, especially in electric power production
(while for natural gas the conditional “factor of CO2 emissions” constitutes 15, in
the case of coal it reaches 25 and more, being very variable). An “attack” on coal
was not, however, connected with ecological motives. The question of ecology did
not rise at all till the mid-1980s, when the price of oil and gas dropped (especially in
1986). As to resolve the appearing economic problems, some ecological allies were
needed to provide the competitive ability of “pure” energy for the sake of “sus-
tainable development”.
It is no mere chance that the IPCC was forethought in 1995, really planned in
1987, and started functioning in 1988. Governments of various countries support
the plans of GHGs emissions reduction not for ecological but for other reasons:
enhancement of national nuclear energy (Germany); an increase of the export
potential for electric power produced by nuclear power stations and gas (France,
Norway); an increase of the size of ﬁnancial support, etc. Naturally, the countries
where electric power depends on coal, are most skeptical about the “greenhouse”
warming.
Having analyzed the role of various international organizations and programs in
the problem of global climate change, Boehmer-Christiansen (1997) emphasized:
“Climate policy cannot be understood without a deeper analysis of the role of
science and scientiﬁc understanding of the coalition of non-ecological interests
(both commercial and bureaucratic) which serve as a driving force of development
of events on international scales. Where this coalition will lead us, remains unclear,
so far”.
Constructive prospects of resolving this problem are connected with the devel-
opment and application of complex models to assess possible changes of climate
and socio-economic development. In the detailed overview of methods and results
of numerical modeling of global climate change with regard for dynamics of socio-
economic processes, prepared by Parson and Fisher-Vanden (1997), the main
aspects of the so-called integral assessments (IA) have been discussed. The main
goal of such developments is to substantiate recommendations for people making
respective decisions concerning the ecological policy.
Four concrete goals include the following problems:
(1) assessment of possible response to climate change;
(2) analysis of the structure of scientiﬁc bases of modeling and characteristic
uncertainties of the results obtained;
430
5
Ecoinformatics Problems of Global Climate Change

(3) comparative estimates of possible risks; and
(4) analysis of the achieved scientiﬁc progress.
During the last several decades, two approaches prevailed in developments of IA
models:
(1) use of assessments obtained by interdisciplinary groups of experts; and
(2) formal numerical modeling.
The former approach is characteristic of IPCC efforts and developments within
the Montreal Protocol, whereas the latter approach was realized by individual
specialists. The emphasis was placed on the use of IA models to analyze possible
impacts of climate change on the development of energy and economy in the
context of the problem of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere.
The general assessment of the results obtained consists in that the IA models
cannot be used to substantiate the highly specialized measures in view of the
insufﬁciently detailed character of such models. However, the use of such models is
important for assessment of possible uncertainties and, hence, expediency of
making any decisions. In this case, it is important that considerable uncertainties
concerning the system on the whole or recommendations on the needed ecological
policy, can turn out to be not those uncertainties that are most important for
understanding the processes responsible for understanding changes taking place in
the environment or characterized by most substantial variability.
Considering the data for concrete models, it is possible to range uncertainties by
their signiﬁcance, but this ranging depends on speciﬁc character of the models.
Although the use of IA models has made it possible to substantiate some correla-
tions of dynamics of the socio-economic development and variability of the envi-
ronment, the relevant results should be considered only preliminary. So far, the use
of IA models has made only a small contribution to estimation of comparative risks
and to obtaining the answer to the fundamental question, to what degree and in
which respects a possible climate change is most substantial.
In view of these circumstances, the results of the use of IA models to substantiate an
adequate ecological policy have been, so far, rather limited, and this refers especially to
purely didactic estimates based on the use of simple models. The main problems of the
IA models’ improvement include: overcoming insufﬁcient understanding of probable
impacts and possibilities of adaptation; poorly substantiated or absent at all descrip-
tions of social and behavioural processes in developing countries; very limited ideas of
a scarcely probable, but radical climate change. Despite these and other unresolved
problems, the urgency of further efforts in development of IA models is obvious.
In conclusion, again, it is emphasized that an improvement of the global
observation system is of great importance. The urgency of this problem has been
illustrated in Demirchian et al. (2002) where the complicated spatial-temporal SAT
variability in high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere has been demonstrated, as
well as the groundlessness of the “greenhouse” warming conception, according to
which under conditions of the Arctic the effect of the growth of GHGs concen-
tration should manifest itself especially strongly.

5.5.1 Climate and Civilization
Cities are one of the most substantial and evident phenomena of the present civi-
lization development. Despite an apparent controversy of their development, for
most of the planetary population they are a symbol of progress. But nevertheless,
“cities do not deserve their epoch, they are not worthy of us”. This opinion of the
outstanding French architect and town-builder Le Corbusie (1977), voiced as far
back as 1925, is valid even now. One of the major causes of this assessment is an
unfavourable ecological situation, and another one is a continuous growth of the
urban population. During the next 20 years most of the population in developing
countries will live in cities. This fact, like the problems of large cities, attracts
serious attention of many investigators (Grigoryev and Kondratyev 2004; Bulkeley
and Betsill 2003; Kondratyev et al. 2006a).
The main feature at the turn of the 20th century is the continuing growth of
megalopolises. If in 1970 the urban population constituted 35 % of the planetary
population, in 2000 it was already almost 50 %. It was supposed that by the year 2023
more than 3.3 billion people will live in cities. The prevailing contribution (90 %) is
made by the cities of developing countries (Grigoryev and Kondratyev 2004).
Forecasts of urbanization development for the nearest 30 years show that from
the viewpoint of population location, cities head the list. In 2030, the size of the
urban population can reach 60 % of the global population.
Serious progress in many spheres of vital activity, which is connected with the
growth of cities, is accompanied by heavy negative consequences. They are rather
diverse and connected, in particular, with the poverty of many city-dwellers, low
level of health, high mortality, environmental degradation, as well as shortcomings
in the infrastructure and development of the municipal services. Of these problems,
the most important is the environmental situation and lack of readiness of infra-
structures to protect population against natural disasters. That’s the initial cause of
other numerous negative aspects of the urban life (ﬁrst of all, city-dwellers’ health
and poverty). This hinders the progressive positive development of cities. Of
course, speciﬁc features of urbanization in the regions of different continents differ
drastically. The highest level of urbanization is observed in the countries of North
America (77.2 %), Latin America (75.3 %); and Europe (74.8 %). In other regions
these indicators are as follows: Oceania and Australia—70.2 %, Asia—36.7 %, and
Africa—37.9 %. This statistics is quite natural and reﬂects the difference of the
countries by the level of industrial development.
For individual countries, the urbanization phenomenon is characterized by the
following indicators: Belgium—97.3 %, Iceland—92.5 %, Uruguay—91.3 %,
Great Britain—89.5 %, the Netherlands—89.4 %, Germany—87.5 %, Venezuela—
86.6 %, Argentina—85.9 %, Chili—85.7 %, Denmark—85.3 %, Sweden—83.3 %,
Brazil—81.3 %. Analysis of these and other indicators of urbanization shows that
432
5
Ecoinformatics Problems of Global Climate Change

there is a dependence of population concentration on the frequency of unfavourable
and dangerous natural phenomena on a given territory. In particular, in Iceland the
settling is affected by volcanic activity, in the Netherlands—by the ﬂoods of
lowlands. In Chili, vast territories are covered with deserts and mountains, in
Uruguay ﬂoods happen frequently. In Brazil and Venezuela large areas are covered
with tropical forests. Apparently, in other regions, natural disasters also affect the
settling of population. However, this dependence remains poorly studied.
In North America, despite the general high level of population concentration in
the cities, in the two greatest countries of the continent—the USA and Canada—in
2000 the level of urbanization did not reach 80 % (77.2 and 77.1 %, respectively).
By 2015, only in the USA the level of urbanization will exceed this threshold and
reach 81 %. This is explained, at least, by two reasons. One of them is the presence
in these countries of vast ﬂat territories within which there is plenty of safe (in
natural respect) and comfortable places for settling. Of course, the holding factor of
the growth of large cities is also a high standard of life in both countries, both in
cities (large and small) and at rural localities.
At present, the least urbanized are the countries in Africa. At present time, the
level of urbanization in Africa is characterized by the following data: Libya (88 %),
Gaboon (81.4 %), Djibouti (83.3 %), Western Sahara (95.4 %), Tunisia (66.2 %),
Algeria (57.7 %), South Africa (57.7 %) and Equatorial Guinea (49.3 %). A low
level of the urban population will remain here by 2015, not exceeding 50 % in most
countries. The urbanization of most of Africa is moving fast forward, especially
south of the Sahara. During 2000–2005 urbanization growth was 4.7 % in Eastern
Africa and 2.09 % in South Africa under average 3.76 % for all Africa.
In Asia, in the year 2000, among 50 countries 80 % threshold of the urban
population was exceeded only in 11 countries. Large countries on this list is only
Korea (81.9 %). In most densely populated countries the level of urbanization is:
China (32.1 %), India (28.4 %), Indonesia (40.9 %), and Pakistan (37.0 %). A high
level of urbanization is observed in Japan (78.8 %), which is explained by the
impact of unfavourable natural factors, such as tsunami, volcanic eruptions,
earthquakes, and typhoons. Asian cities are growing rapidly. Another 1.1 billion
people will live in the region’s cities in the next 20 years. By 2030, more than 55 %
of the population of Asia will be urban.
One of the features of the current urbanization is the rise of cities and urban
agglomerations. In North America, by the year 2000 such cities numbered 41 (37 in
the USA and 4 in Canada). Among them were 3 cities with population exceeding 5
millions: New York (16,649 thousands), Los Angeles (13,140 thousands), and
Chicago (6,951 thousands). Among the European countries, Russia and Germany
head the list (11 and 13 cities-millionaires, respectively). In Europe there are only
four cities with population more than 5 millions: Paris (9,264 thousands), Moscow
(9,321 thousands), Essen (6,541 thousands), and London (7,640 thousands). In
Africa, there are three such cities: Kinshasa (5,064 thousands), Cairo (10,552
thousands), and Lagos (13,427 thousands). By the year 2015, about 500 mega-cities
with population more than 1 million should rise.

Thus, an analysis of the general trend in settling the planetary population carried
out by Grigoryev and Kondratyev (2004) has shown that on the whole, the number
of cities-millionaires is growing, but the rate of the growth differs in different
regions. The global characteristics of the present population dynamics in the cities
are as follows:
1. On the whole, at present the urbanization is characteristic of all countries in the
world. Cities are growing in number, the percentage of the urban population
increases. However, the rate of urbanization is slowing down.
2. The cities-millionaires are growing in number. But in the countries with a high
level of development the growth of population in the cities-millionaires is at a
minimum. At present it is slowing down, and in many cities it stopped alto-
gether. In developing, poor countries the growth of population in the cities-
millionaires is slow but to a lesser extent.
3. The characteristic feature of the development of urbanization now and in future
is the formation of cities with population above 5 and even 10 millions, which
are called mega-cities. It is especially interesting to study these cities, since they
exhibit features of the future process of urbanization, and, as a matter of fact, the
features of the future of humankind. They concentrate a multitude of positive
aspects from the viewpoint of humans’ activity. At the same time, in such cities
every negative aspect of the phenomenon discussed clearly shows itself, espe-
cially in the countries with developing economy.
The 21st century is an epoch of the transition of the planetary population to new
living conditions within the globalization of many processes. Of course, the elements
of globalization of various kinds of humans’ activity have been observed before,
even many centuries ago, due to trade, navigation, and military expansions. How-
ever, its present features have greatly changed. Globalization of any phenomena has
accelerated and is covering larger areas. The range of phenomena incorporated in
planetary processes has drastically broadened. The main thing is that not only chains
of events have appeared and propagated on a global scale. The whole world and
various kinds of human activity—economy, politics, science, technology, engi-
neering—have turned out to be involved in the process of globalization. Moreover,
the whole world has turned out to be not simply in globalization chains, but in a web
of chains of events which are propagating across the globe.
Cities, especially large ones, have become the key point of the process of
globalization. Globalization in cities is accompanied by many positive phenomena.
Among them are, for instance, prompt information on possible acts of terrorism,
approaching tropical cyclones, which can threaten the human life, information on
global propagation of dangerous infectious diseases, information about new med-
icines, and many others. Negative aspects of globalization are also known, which
vividly and painfully manifest themselves in the cities. Among them are: propa-
gation of drugs, epidemics, criminality, etc. Ecological problems in the cities also
contain negative components. These are pollution of the atmosphere and hydro-
sphere, high risk of propagation of epidemics resulting from destructions after
earthquakes, hurricanes, and ﬂoods.

Ecoinformatics Problems of Global Climate Change

Contrasts in the ecological situation in the cities connected with the socio-
economic factors, are clearly seen with an access of population to objects of san-
itation as an example. People’s security in case of natural disasters depends sub-
stantially on this indicator. The best access to such objects is provided in the cities
of North America (100 % access), Europe (99 %), Australia and Oceania (99 %). A
much lower level of sanitary-hygiene provision is founded in the cities of Africa
(84 %) and Latin America (87 %). A low level of access of city-dwellers to normal
services is in the cities of Asia (78 %), and the worst sanitary conditions are in India
(46 %), Nigeria (61 %), Ghana and Pakistan (53 %).
The cities of the world differ substantially in their waste. For instance, every
year, on average, the cities with populations of 1 million or more in Russia dump
about 3.5 million t of solid and concentrated waste. Its main constituents are
(thousands of tons): wood waste (400), paper (9), textile (8), and glass breakage (3).
Most of waste is in the cities of highly developed industrial countries, such as the
USA and Canada, where per-capita waste is estimated at 2 and 1.5 kg day−1. In the
cities of Latin America it is 1.0 kg day−1. Of course, of greater importance is not
the amount of waste but possibilities and practice of its processing. In contrast to
the cities of the USA and Canada, where the waste is processed practically com-
pletely, in most of the cities of South America, from 20 to 50 % of garbage are not
removed at all (Gurberlet 2003).
Large cities concentrate a lot of anthropogenic processes on small territories, the
state of which is determined by the ecological, material, sanitary-epidemiological,
social, cultural, political, religious, and other speciﬁc features of society. All these
features deﬁne input variables when determining the danger threatening the city-
dwellers in case of a natural disaster. Clearly, for the optimal growth of cities in
harmony with the environment, will be the development of criteria of the ecological
risk in cities and their indication; and development of an efﬁcient system of indicators
of the ecological situations in the cities. At present, there are a lot of such indicators.
As a rule, they concern individual elements of the environment. Examples are
information systems of assessment of the quality and condition of the water medium,
sanitary-epidemiological situation, quality of atmospheric air, etc. Alimov et al.
(1999) undertook a multi-criterial assessment of the medium quality and the state of
the urban ecosystem of St.-Petersburg. Flood (1995) described the system of indi-
cators used by the U.N. having studied more than 100 cities of the world.
Indicators of various phenomena in the cities are efﬁcient means to analyze and
monitor the interaction between the cities and the environment. Among the indicators
of the ecological situation in the cities, two large groups can be selected. The ﬁrst
group includes indicators of the environment, directly affecting the humans’ activity
and the ecological situation. First of all, it concerns the indicators of air and water
quality. Such indicators as the area of green plantations are widely used and to a lesser
extent the characteristics of their state. During the last decades emphasis has been
placed on several geoecological characteristics of the urban environment of tech-
nogenic origin. Among them are: the level of noise, radioactive pollution, impact of
local electromagnetic ﬁelds. The second group includes indicators characterizing the
level of poverty, health, special features of infrastructure, transport, the state of
5.5

available housing, and quality of the environmental control. A detailed analysis of
some of them has been made by Grigoryev and Kondratyev (2004).
In Europe, in 1999, within the framework of conception “Towards sustainable
development at a local level: European indicators of sustainability”, ten indicators
have been proposed (Grigoryev and Kondratyev 2004):
• satisfaction of citizens with the standard of living at a settlement;
• contribution of the cities to the global climate change;
• population mobility and passenger trafﬁc;
• availability of public accommodations and services;
• air quality at a settlement;
• transportation of children to school and from school;
• control according to principles of sustainable development;
• noise pollution;
• stable land use; and
• output of products that favours the sustainable development.
The main apparent shortcoming of these indicators is their inadequacy and some
vagueness. Here concrete indicators are absent, such as:
• quality of drinking water;
• rate of mortality (including infant mortality);
• per-capita gross production;
• quantity of paupers and waifs; and
• crime rate.
From the viewpoint of the urban population security during natural disasters, the
use of such indicators would make it possible to resolve many problems of averting
great human losses and reducing the economic damage. Of course, all of these
problems can be resolved by using a global model that describes maximum amount
of processes and sub-systems of the environment. Such a model has been proposed
in Kondratyev et al. (2004a). It can be realized only within the framework of the
agreement signed by 60 countries on uniﬁcation of national systems of observation
of the environment into a global system.
Major disparities in the level of urbanization exist among development groups.
Thus, whereas the proportion of urban population in the more developed regions
was already nearly 54 % in 1950, it will still take another decade for half of the
population of the less developed regions to live in urban areas (Fig. 5.16).
The world urban population is expected to increase by 72 % by 2050, from 3.6
billion in 2011 to 6.3 billion in 2050. By mid-century the world urban population
will likely be the same size as the world’s total population was in 2002. Virtually all
of the expected growth in the world population will be concentrated in the urban
areas of the less developed regions, whose population is projected to increase from
2.7 billion in 2011 to 5.1 billion in 2050. Over the same period, the rural population
of the less developed regions is expected to decline from 3.1 billion to 2.9 billion.
In the more developed regions, the urban population is projected to increase
modestly, from 1 billion in 2011 to 1.1 billion in 2050 (UN 2012).

Ecoinformatics Problems of Global Climate Change

The world rural population is expected to reach a maximum of 3.4 billion in
2021 and to decline slowly thereafter, to reach 3.05 billion in 2050. These global
trends are driven mostly by the dynamics of rural population growth in the less
developed regions, which house today almost 92 % of the world rural population.
Whereas the rural population of the more developed regions has been declining
steadily during the second half of the twentieth century and will continue to do so
for the foreseeable future, the rural population of the less developed regions more
than doubled since 1950 and will likely continue to grow until 2021 before a long-
term decline sets in (UN 2012).
5.5.2 Climate and Energetics
Globalization processes and their present tendencies put many problems connected
with the search of strategy for the control by the waste products of different sectors of
the economics. Regions with unstable structure of the NSS dynamics cause special
anxiety. Particularly, the presence of the uncertainty in future development of oil and
gas import from reservoirs of Middle East and North Africa for the reason of the
extension of China and India role leads to the uncertainty in the prediction of future
ﬂuxes of anthropogenic CO2. It is expected that under the conservation of present
tendency in the economic development in these regions CO2 emission can increase by
52 % to 2030 in comparison with present level (WEO 2002, 2004, 2005, 2013).
The need for energy in Middle East and North Africa is regulated by the
requirements of growing population and by growth of the economics. The need for
Fig. 5.16 Urban and rural population by development group, 1950–2050 (UN 2012)
5.5
Climate, Energetics and Global Urbanization
437

the primary energy in this region to 2030 can be more than double. At the same
time oil extraction can increase approximately by 75 % and gas by three times. A
quota of this region within the oil extraction will increase from 35 to 44 % in 2030.
All this will be possible under the investments of 56 billion dollars per year to the
energetic infrastructure development in the countries of Middle East and North
Africa. It is connected with deﬁned levels of the risk for the countries G8. Different
scenarios of the development for the regions of Middle East and North Africa are
here naturally arisen to be connected with levels of investments and prices a con-
sideration of which introduces the uncertainty in global CO2 emission (Cozzi 2003;
IEA 2013c).
Special IPCC Reports (IPCC 2005, 2007) and IEA (2013a, b, c) analyzing the
information of long standing analysis of the environment changes give a set of
assessments and make some conclusions about the tendencies and causes of these
changes:
• World proved oil reserves at the end of 2012 reached 1668.9 billion barrels,
sufﬁcient to meet 52.9 years of global production. World oil production increased
by 1.9 million b/d in 2012, more than double the growth of global consumption.
World proved natural gas reserves at end-2012 stood at 187.3 trillion m3, sufﬁ-
cient to meet 55.7 years of global production. World natural gas production
increased by 1.9 % in 2012. World proved reserves of coal in 2012 were sufﬁcient
to meet 109 years of global production. Global coal production grew by 2 %.
• Global energy consumption and related CO2 entering to the atmosphere in 21st
century continues to increase. Fossil fuels deliver 86 % of world energy and are
the source for 75 % of anthropogenic emission of CO2 to the atmosphere. World
energy consumption increases from 524 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu)
in 2010 to 630 quadrillion Btu in 2020 and 820 quadrillion in 2040, a 30-year
increase of 56 %.
• Global consumption of primary energy increased in the average with speed
equaled to 1.4 % during 1990–1995 and with speed 1.6 % from 1995 to 2001.
Under this, the rates of energy consumption increase are distributed by the
economics sectors with the following shares: 0.3–0.9 % in industry, 2.1–2.2 %
in the transport, 2.1–2.7 % in the building sector and −0.8 to −2.4 % in the
agriculture. According to IEA (2013a, b, c) data from 1990 to 2012, the average
energy use per person increased 10 % while world population increased 27 %.
Regional energy use also grew from 1990 to 2008: the Middle East increased by
170 %, China by 146 %, India by 91 %, Africa by 70 %, Latin America
by 66 %, the USA by 20 %, the EU-27 block by 7 %, and world overall grew by
39
%.

2008,
total

energy
consumption
was
474
EJ
(132,000 TWh). This is equivalent to an average power use of 15 TW
(2.0 × 1010 hp). The annual potential for renewable energy is: solar energy
1,575 EJ (438,000 TWh), wind power 640 EJ (180,000 TWh), geothermal
energy 5,000 EJ (1,400,000 TWh), biomass 276 EJ (77,000 TWh), hydropower
50 EJ (14,000 TWh) and ocean energy 1 EJ (280 TWh).

• The production of electricity in 2009 was 20,053 TWh. Sources of electricity
were fossil fuels 67 %, renewable energy 16 % (mainly hydroelectric, wind,
solar and biomass), and nuclear power 13 %, and other sources were 3 %. The
majority of fossil fuel usage for the generation of electricity was coal and gas.
Oil was 5.5 %, as it is the most expensive common commodity used to produce
electrical energy. Ninety-two percent of renewable energy was hydroelectric
followed by wind at 6 % and geothermal at 1.8 %. Solar photovoltaic was
0.06 %, and solar thermal was 0.004 %. Greenhouse gas emissions from power
plants and other industrial facilities declined by 4.5 % from 2011 to 2012 as
utilities continued to switch from coal to natural gas to generate electricity and
produced slightly less power overall. Taking into consideration of emission
factor equaled 7.0555 × 10−4 metric tons CO2/kWh, 2,250 MtC was emitted to
the atmosphere in 2011 out of the electric power production. It is expected that
coal will be occupy the energetic niche 36 % to the 2020.
• An average CO2 emission was increased by 1 % during 1990–1995 and by
1.4 % from 1995 to 2001. The most input to the CO2 emission gives the electric
power generation. Under this, the contribution of separate economic sectors
was: 1.7–2.0 %—industry, 2.0–2.3 %—building, and −1.0 to −2.8 %—
agriculture.
• Many experts will expect that the level of 550 ppm CO2 stabilization on can be
reached to 2100 due to the reduction of its emission by 7–70 %. Such uncer-
tainty is determined by the variety between the estimations of CO2 sources and
sinks both natural and anthropogenic.
• Total emission of CO2 under the fossil fuel combustion for 2001 was assessed as
24 GtCO2 (6.6 GtC) per year. Under this 47 % of this emission was realized by
developed countries, 13 % by countries with transient economics, and 25 % by
developing countries from Paciﬁc sector of Asia. Input of separate sources was:
263 MtC/year—automobile industry, 1,173 MtC/year—building and manufac-
tories, 1,150 MtC/year—traveling transport, and 520 MtC/year—residential
areas.
• Input of greenhouse gases to the variation of the Earth’s radiation balance is
20 % for CO2 and 6 % for nitrogen oxides.
Tables 5.12, 5.13 and 5.14 characterizes a distribution of CO2 emission by the
economic sectors and regions. It is expected that growth of CO2 emissions by total
volume is changed from 24,409 MtCO2 in 2002 to 33,284 MtCO2 in 2015, and it
achieved 38,790 MtCO2 to 2025 exceeded the level of 1990 by 81 %.
Despite the fact that Kyoto Protocol after its ratiﬁcation by Russia 16 February
2005 came into force for more than 55 countries its recommendations on the CO2
emission reduction no simplify the realization of real prognosis of the energetics
development during nearest decades. Nevertheless,supposing that all countries
signed the Kyoto Protocol will follow to its recommendations, we receive that
average rate of CO2 emission increase due to fossil fuels combustion during 2002–
2025 will be to equal to 2 %. The prognosis can be improved to a certain extent,
taking into consideration of data given in Table 5.15 where a comparison between
5.5

all economics and the most representative regions is given by the index of their
development effectiveness. It is necessary to take into account the presence of the
effect in the reduction of GDP efﬁciency, along with the population growth and
GDP increase for the enhancement of the human development index (HDI). In fact,

the ideal model of globalization is to provide for the HDI alignment by all countries
out of the surplus resources redistribution. However, such model is far from reality
and therefore existing predictions of increase in CO2 emissions have considerable
varieties by the estimations of rates and volumes. Data of Table 5.16 indicate

eloquently a current heterogeneity in the world distribution of resources, and
consequently the role of separate regions in the environment improvement.
Rates of changes of the anthropogenic carbon ﬂuxes intensity in the future could
vary depending on the technologic achievements, weighed economic policy, and
replacement of priorities of energetics by the laws satisﬁed to the stabilization
conditions of environment quality indicators. An expected increase of science-
technical progress efﬁciency is with consideration of such progress in future to
decrease continuously relative rates of anthropogenic CO2 ﬂuxes to the atmosphere.
And this means that achievement of high HDI level in the countries with transition
and developing economics can realized without violent changes of climate due to
anthropogenic causes. As it is seen from Table 5.16 USA that did not sign the
Kyoto Protocol occupy special place. USA projected with own initiative (RGGI)
according to which the elaboration of the reduction strategy of greenhouse gases is
planned. This strategy will be satisﬁed only to the USA national interests. This
initiative assumes a development of the methods for the management of greenhouse
gases emission to be the regulator of marketable interrelations between states
concerning their exchange by the carbon quotes.
Important globalization aspect is an impossibility to assess with reliability the
development of separate processes within present conditions of the NSS func-
tioning and without the analysis of all correlations that exist in real world. In this
sense, numerous International Programs can have signiﬁcance only as means of
data and knowledge accumulation, but no as technology for the environment study.
Speciﬁc dependence is observed between the energetics and biogeochemical cycles.

Ecoinformatics Problems of Global Climate Change

Development of present energetics and its nearest future is closely connected
with the use of natural gas, oil and coal. The processing of these fossils in the
industry and other sectors of economics leads inevitably to the emission of many
other gases to the atmosphere with more high potential of the atmosphere heating
(Fig. 5.17). Prognosis of the energetics development in the future depends on the
reliable parameterization of socio-economic processes in the GMNSS. According to
EIA (2005),world has several clusters that differ by their economic development:
• Countries with developed market economics covering 15 % of the world pop-
ulation. It is countries of North America, West Europe, Australia and New
Zealand.
• Countries with transition economics having 6 % of world population and
including East Europe and countries of Former Soviet Union.
• Countries with developing economics (78 % of world population):

In other aspects, countries can be selected by groupings (Table 5.17):
• Countries that ratiﬁed, accepted, supported or approved of the Kyoto Protocol.
• Countries of EU.
• Countries of G8.
• Three countries of NAFTA.
• Thirty countries of OECD.
• Eleven countries of OPEC.
• Eight countries of developing Paciﬁc basin.
• Seven countries of the Persian Gulf.
Absolutely, it is obvious that coordinated strategies of the energetics develop-
ment exist within each of these clusters, but there exist the contradictions. An
optimality of such structure can be found by means of the (V, W)-exchange model
described by Kondratyev et al. (2006b). A methodic developed in EIA (2005) for
the prognosis of energetics development up to 2025 gave the possibility to make
weighed estimations for the rates of needs in the energy sources, the realizing of
which leads to the achievement of CO2 atmospheric concentration equaled to

550 ppm in the end of 21 century (Fig. 5.18). In some degree, this will be connected
with the priorities redistribution between sectors of the economics. It is expected
that signiﬁcantly increase the role of transport loads on the environment. If in 1990
the transport part was equaled to 20 % of consumed energy, but to 2005 this level
approach to 40 %. But at the same time, the progress in the industry will bring to the
reduction of consumed energy from 38 % in 1990 to 17 % in 2095. It is expected
that role of such sectors of the economics, as electric power production and building
is signiﬁcantly not changed. The forecasts given in Fig. 5.18 and realized by
different experts, characterize the presence of high uncertainty in the initial data of
biogeochemical block of GMNSS. From this, it is seen that synthesize of global
model for economic development has special attention for the models of biogeo-
chemical cycles and for the assessment of their role in the formation of the envi-
ronment state.

5.6 Thunderstorms as a Component of the Global
Ecodynamics
Thunderstorms are the most powerful storms in the Earth’s atmosphere. Annually,
an estimated of 16 million thunderstorms happen across the world. Thunderstorms
are capable of causing extensive damage to both life and property. Thunderstorms
affect small areas when compared with hurricanes and winter storms. The typical
thunderstorm is 15 miles in diameter and lasts an average of 30 min. Nevertheless,
thunderstorm activity is closely connected with the atmosphere instability in global
scale, which impacts on global biogeochemical cycles (Kurz and Grewe 2002; Mo
et al. 2002).
The level of understanding the photochemical processes in the troposphere that
affect its composition, depends substantially on adequacy of ideas about the budget
and distribution of nitrogen oxides NOx (NO + NO2). Due to reactions of the
catalytic cycle with the participation of peroxides radicals, NOx play the decisive
role in the processes of tropospheric ozone formation and affect the cycle of HOx
(OH + HO2). One of the most important unclear aspects of the problem under
discussion is the insufﬁcient reliability of data on the contribution of lightning
strikes to the global budget of NOx. According to the earlier estimates, this con-
tribution varied within 2–20 Tg N year−1, with most probable values of about
2–6 Tg N year−1 (Kondratyev et al. 2006a).
Crawford et al. (2000) carried out an analysis of results of aircraft measurements
within the program of the ﬁeld experiment SONEX on studies of ozone and
nitrogen oxides in the troposphere. Results of the analysis revealed the presence in
the upper troposphere of episodes of NOx concentration increase determined,
apparently, by the impact of lightning strikes. The correlation with speciﬁc periods
of lightning activity could be found out from analysis of “reverse” trajectories of the
motion of air masses as well as from the data of observations at the national
network of lightning record. The Lagrangian numerical modeling of “reverse”
trajectories has been carried out to trace the evolution of NOx plumes during a
1–2-day interval between their occurrence and obtaining of aircraft measurement
data. Calculations were made for pre-calculation of expected changes of concen-
trations of HNO3, H2O2, CH3COOH, HO2, and OH. Depending on conditions, the
initial concentration of NOx varied within 1–7 ppb. Since the calculated estimates
of HNO3 concentration turned out to be overestimated compared to those observed,
the reasons of such differences were analyzed and it was shown that the observed
values of H2O2 concentration agree with the supposed removal of H2O2 from the
atmosphere due to convection. Although it is possible that in the upper troposphere
the concentration of CH3COOH grows due to convection, the numerical modeling
has led to the conclusion that this increase can be only of short duration (less than
2 h), which excludes the possibility to detect this component during aircraft mea-
surement. The possibility of CH3COOH concentration increase is excluded too, in
view of a high level of NO concentration.

Thunderstorms as a Component of the Global …
447

The reaction between NO and HO2 in all the cases considered, favors a decrease
of HO2 concentration. In some cases the calculated values of OH concentration
doubled, but at a maximum level of NOx concentration the loss of hydroxyl due to
the reaction OH + NO2 compensates the formation of hydroxyl due to reactions
NO2 + NO. An additional increase of OH by 30–60 % can, however, result from
convective transfer of CH3COOH.
To form an estimate of the contribution of lightning and anthropogenic sources
to the formation of NOx concentration on global scales, Kurz and Grewe (2002)
undertook a numerical modeling of the frequency and global distribution of
lightning strikes and the resulting formation of NOx using the complex model of
climate and chemical processes taking place in the atmosphere ECHAM4.L39
(DRL)/CHEM(E39/C), whose important feature is a realistic simulation of pro-
cesses responsible for the formation of penetrating convection.
Calculated estimates of the height of convective clouds, on the whole, agree well
with those observed. But in mid-latitudes of Western Europe the calculated values
were underestimated. The calculated spatial distribution of lightning strikes agrees
well with the observed distribution, though the calculated ratio of the density of
strikes over land and over the oceans turned out to be underestimated. In the mid-
latitudes of Western Europe the density of strikes is underestimated compared to
that observed, which can be explained by inadequate scheme of convection
parameterization.
According to numerical modeling results, the NOx formation is most intensive in
the tropics and in mid-latitudes, and is clearly separated (in space) from NOx
emissions due to aviation. The lightning-induced maximum level of NOx emissions
is located at altitudes approximately 5 km below the level of the tropopause, with
the level of emissions exceeding 3 times the respective anthropogenic level. Besides
this, it is important that maximum aircraft emissions of NOx tend to be at much
higher altitudes and farther north (being concentrated mainly within the North-
Atlantic corridor 30–60°N at a level of about 200 h Pa, that is, 12 km) compared to
NOx formed due to lightning strikes.
Zhang et al. (2003a, b) analyzed the possibilities of numerical modeling of
nitrogen oxides formed due to lightning strikes using the 2D version of the model
that simulates an electrization of the storm. It is supposed that the formation of NO
is determined by dissipation of energy, whose value is calculated from the value of
the electric ﬁeld before and after a lightning strike. The rate of formation of energy
responsible for NO formation is 9.2 × 1016 molecules J−1. Considering a limited set
of chemical reactions in which NO, NO2, and O3 participate, a numerical modeling
has been carried out of processes taking place in a small storm with 10 intra-cloud
strikes during 2 min. The level of dissipation of energy varied between 0.024 and
0.28 GJ. After cessation of lightning strikes the integration continued during 18 min
more. Analysis of the modeling results has shown that the mixing ratio of NO
formed within a cloud (by order of magnitude) is 10 ppb after most powerful strikes
and 1–2 ppb on the windward side of the thundercloud anvil at the end of the
integration interval. These estimates agree with the data of observations. A com-
parison with results of the earlier numerical modeling with the use of different 2D

model revealed, on the whole, an agreement of estimates, but the results discussed
are characterized by greater volumes of energy at high altitudes, which can partially
result from a longer integration time and lacking of consideration of the strikes onto
the Earth in the model in question, as well as from some assumptions made earlier.
On the whole, the numerical modeling of lightning formation carried out recently
and their impact on NO formation should be considered more adequate than in
previous studies. The necessity of further improvement of the model has determined
the development of a new 3D model of the processes of formation of electric
charges in thunderclouds with a more complete than earlier consideration of
chemical processes of nitrogen oxides formation under the inﬂuence of lightning
strikes (Zhang et al. 2003b).
A totality of considered GHGs includes in this case NO, NO2, O3, CO, CH4,
OH, and HNO3. The numerical modeling has been carried out for concrete con-
ditions of thunderclouds (storm) observed on 19 July 1981 with 18 intra-cloud
strikes during 3 min. The numerical modeling has been carried out for a period of
38 min, before the thundercloud dissipated. The level of energy dissipated at
lightning strikes varied within 0.91–2.28 GJ. The maximum level of the NOx
mixing ratio due to lightning strikes reached 35.8 ppb. At the cloud’s dissipation,
after cessation of lightning strikes, maximum concentrations of NO and NO2 (in
both cases) constituted about 6.3 ppb and were observed at an altitude of about
4 km. The NO mixing ratio in an anvil reached a maximum of about 2 ppb at an
altitude of about 10.5 km. These results agree well with observational data.
Quite surprising was the formation of the NO2 plume at a concentration of about
0.5 ppb, which reached the surface. In the case of NO there was no plume. On the
other hand, NO was transported from the cloud’s centre to the anvil absent in the
case of NO2, which was determined, probably, by the impact of photolysis. The
ratio of concentrations NO2/NO decreased with altitude in accordance with
observational data. The formation of NO calculated per unit length averaged
2.03 × 1022 molecules m−1. The results obtained show that the short-lived storms
determine the formation of the vertical proﬁle of NOx concentration, that differs
from the earlier observed C-shape proﬁle.
Mansell et al. (2002) carried out a numerical modeling of lightning strikes with the
use of a stochastic model of dielectric break and parameterization of electriﬁcation
mechanisms. This model enables one to simulate a 2D development of a strike as a
stochastic “step-by-step” process. The strike channels propagate over a homogeneous
spatial grid, and the direction of propagation (including diagonals) for each step is
considered random with the probability of the choice of a certain direction depending
on the total electric ﬁeld. After each step, the electric ﬁelds are calculated anew with
the use of the Poisson equation in order to take into account the impact of the
channel’s conductivity. The applied parameterization of the process of lightning
strikes formation, provides a realistic 3D simulation of ramiﬁed strikes. The model is
able to simulate the formation of different kinds of lightning strikes, including intra-
cloud strikes, negative and positive strikes “cloud-ground” (CG).
According to numerical modeling results, the hypothesis that negative strikes
appear only when the region of the positive strike is located beneath the centre of
5.6
Thunderstorms as a Component of the Global …
449

the negative strike can be considered substantiated. The calculated positive CG
strikes were observed only in the parts of the thundercloud, where two charged
layers located near the Earth had an approximately similar “normal dipole” struc-
ture (i.e., positive charges were above negative ones).
Brown et al. (2002) studied the relationships between CG lightning strikes and
the stages of the vertical motions development in the region of thunder centre,
taking as an example the data of observations of a multi-cell thundercloud centre
formed on 11 July 1989 in the region of the city of Elgin (North Dakota). Radar
observations of reﬂectance and vertical velocity enabled one to identify some cells
within the thunder centre and trace the evolution of each cell. The evolution process
took place in accordance with the model of thunder centre developed in the late
1940s and in the following succession (Bréon 2004):
• maturing of upward motions and increase of the cells vertical extent at the stage
of cumulus clouds development;
• maximum development of vertical motions in the upper part of a cell and
downward ﬂuxes with rains from the middle part of the cell; and
• light rains at the stage of the cell’s dissipation.
On 11 July there was observed a trend in the formation of the cell clusters, each
cluster consisting of both growing (at the stage of maturing) and disintegrating
cells. There were no CG strikes when the zone of storm’s convection contained
only one cluster of cells. The strikes took place only in the presence of two or more
clusters. Except from two cases, lightning strikes were observed in the zone of the
storm’s convection, as a rule, closer to the growing (mature) than to dissipating
cells. The discussed observational data favor the hypothesis according to which
rains falling at the sites of downward ﬂuxes determine the conditions favoring the
formation of lightning strikes that reach the Earth. However, it follows from
observations that the complicated structure of the electrical ﬁeld caused by super-
imposed ﬁelds of several cells especially favors an appearance of CG strikes. This
situation can promote an earlier formation of CG strikes in the process of new storm
cells formation.
Although studies of lightning were started in the late 1700s, only in the early
20th century observations of the electric ﬁeld were carried out to retrieve the spatial
distribution of charges in thunderclouds responsible for the formation of lightning.
Then intensive studies began of the distribution of low-frequency electromagnetic
waves generated by lightning strikes (atmospherics). Random natural ﬁelds
received on the Earth’s surface in the frequency range from several Hz to MHz are
created mainly by thunderstorm sources. Their study for a formalized description in
the interests of radar observations has been carried out by Remizov (1985). Radio-
noise caused by thunderstorms is disastrous for communication systems just as
thunderstorms themselves are disastrous for population as a factor that can lead to
ﬁres and destructions.
Chronis and Anagnostou (2003) discussed the preliminary results of the func-
tioning of the experimental network recording the lightning strikes (ZEUS), which
consists of six receivers located in Western Europe and functions from July 2001.

The receivers make it possible to record the lightning-generated low-frequency
electromagnetic waves (5–15 kHz) which propagate via the waveguide “Earth—
ionosphere” over distances of several thousands kilometers. Estimates have been
obtained of the errors of observations at the network ZEUS (from the viewpoint of
reliability of detection, localization, and characteristic of lightning strikes) by
comparing with the data of independent observations. Such comparisons have been
made for three regions: the eastern coast of the USA/north-western sector of the
Atlantic Ocean, Africa, and Spain. Data for comparison came from the results of
observations made with the use of the lightning sensor mounted on the TRMM
satellite to study precipitation in the tropics, as well as data of the Spanish network
for lightning observations. Results of the comparisons have shown that the errors of
localization (determination of coordinates) of lightning vary within 40–400 km at
distances up to 5,000 km and farther. Within the territory on which the network is
located the errors do not exceed 40 km.
The formation of positive charges in the lower parts of clouds revealed by
calculations with the use of the so-called tripole model of thunderclouds, was
veriﬁed by results of direct balloon soundings and remote sensing from the data of
ground measurements of the electric ﬁeld. However, since the sources of these
charges have not been understood clearly, Mo et al. (2002) undertook direct aircraft
measurements of positive charges in the lower parts of clouds with the use of two
aircraft ﬂying close by.
Data of observations obtained near New Mexico (USA) on 10 August 1997
demonstrated (at least, in some cases) that near the bottoms of clouds (at an altitude
of about 3.4 km) there were located positive charges formed, apparently, under the
inﬂuence of lightning strikes. The charge recorded in one of the cases at an altitude
of about 4 km was *1.25 C, which agrees with the data of balloon and ground
measurements of electric ﬁelds. Numerical modeling with electric ﬁelds prescribed
from the data of aircraft observations near the idealized charge dipole with the
instant introduction of the positive charge gave results which agree well with
observations. The observational data indicate that at a ripe stage of formation of the
horizontal distribution of the charge near the cloud bottom, this distribution can be
very complicated and is characterized by a combination of the contacting regions
with opposite charges.
Rakov and Tuni (2003) studied an adequacy of numerical modeling of the
lightning electric ﬁeld at a great distance using the model of the transmission line
(TL) and modiﬁed model MTLE taking into account an exponential decrease of
current with altitude depending on polar angle (elevation) and the rate of propa-
gation of the opposite charge. The shape of the wave of the latter was approximated
by a step function. The same presentation was used for the TL model, whereas in
the case of the MTLE model it was supposed that the electric ﬁeld increases
instantly to the level corresponding to TL and then decreases exponentially. The
exponential decrease with altitude (in the case of MTLE) results in a considerable
decrease of the electric ﬁeld intensity during about 1 microsecond after reaching a
maximum, especially at low values of the polar angle and high rate of propagation.

Calculations made by Marshall and Stolzenburg (2002) showed that in the case
of positive CG strikes at which Q-ﬂashes occur, the level of energy constitutes
about 1 × 1010 J, and the area of strike is *40 × 40 km2. An estimation of total
electrostatic energy stored in two stratus clouds of mesoscale convective cloud
system gave values 5 × 1011 and 2 × 1012 J. These levels of energy are sufﬁcient to
provide hundreds or thousands of typical lightning strikes but only 10–100 positive
CG strikes with the accompanying Q-ﬂashes.
Using the Pockels sensors (Miki et al. 2002) in the International Center for
Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT) in the State of Florida, Miki et al. (2002)
carried out measurements of the shape of the electric ﬁeld wave at horizontal
distances from 0.1 to 1.5 m from the lightning channel. The dynamic range of the
measuring system varied between 20 kW m−2 and 5 MW m−2, and the band width
in the interval from 50 GHz to 1 MHz. Also, electric ﬁelds were measured near the
bottom of the channel and at distances 5, 15, and 30 m from the lightning channel.
Using the Pockels sensors, measurements of electric ﬁelds were made for 36 strikes
in 9 “trigger” ﬂashes. 8 of 36 strikes measurements were also made of horizontal
electric ﬁelds. According to the results obtained, the shape of the electric ﬁeld wave
looks like an impulse with its front edge determined by the strike leader, and the
rear edge determined by the inverse strike. Six of 36 studied shapes of the electric
ﬁeld wave were close the V-shape, whereas the other 30 were characterized by
much slower variations in the phase of reverse strike than at the leader stage. The
vertical electric ﬁeld reached a maximum in the interval from 176 kW m−1 to
1.5 MW m−1 (an average of 577 kW m−1), and the horizontal electric ﬁeld—in the
range between 495 kW m−1 and 1.2 MW m−1 (an average of 821 kW m−1). These
values are characterized by a 40 % underestimation.
5.7 The Numerical Modeling of the 3-D Distribution
of Aerosol and Climate
Developments concerning the 3-D ﬁeld of concentration and properties of aerosol
in the context of substantiation of air quality models have contributed much to
numerical modeling of the role of aerosol in the formation of climate.
The aerosol component of CMAQ model described by Binkowski and Roselle
(2003) for multiscale assessments of air quality, is aimed at efﬁcient and time-
saving simulation of the atmospheric aerosol dynamics. The aerosol size distribu-
tion is represented as a superposition of three log-normal modes of aerosol which
include the small-sized mode PM-2.5 (D < 2.5 μm) consisting of two sub-modes—
Aitken nuclei (D < 0.1 μm) and accumulation sub-mode (D = 0.1–2.5 μm), as well
as large-sized mode PM-10 (D = 2.5–10 μm). The process of the aerosol properties
evolution is described with coagulation, growth and formation of new particles.
In consideration of the aerosol components, the PM-2.5 and PM-10 modes of
primary emissions of elemental and organic carbon, as well as dust and other
452

Ecoinformatics Problems of Global Climate Change

particles have been taken into account. Secondary components of aerosol were
sulphate, nitrate, ammonium, water, and secondary organic compounds, of natural
and anthropogenic origin. A parameterization of aerosol light extinction in the
visible spectral region has been made with the use of Mie formulae and empirical
relationships veriﬁed by observational data. Algorithms have been described by
Binkowski and Roselle (2003) which simulate interactions between aerosol and
cloudiness. The obtained results have been illustrated by calculated data with the
use of the box and 3-D models.
Mebust et al. (2003) performed a preliminary analysis of the adequacy of Model-
3 developed by a group of scientists for a multi-scale assessment of air quality
(CMAQ) by comparing calculated and observed values of visibility indices and
concentration of various components of aerosol. Comparisons with the data of
meteorological visibility observations at 130 airports of the USA for the period 11–
15 July 1995 have shown that calculated values of CMAQ parameters, on the
whole, reliably reﬂect the main laws of the spatial-temporal variability of visibility,
including the spatial gradients and extreme levels of visibility.
However, an application of both calculation techniques used in CMAQ to cal-
culate light extinction (with Mie formulae and empirical methods) has led to an
underestimation of visibility reduction (i.e., to its overestimation). In the case of
calculations with Mie formulae, the normalized mean difference (NMD) and nor-
malized mean error (NME) are −21.7 and 25.41 %, respectively, and in case of
empirical method −35.5 and 36.2 %. In most cases the accuracy of the calculated
values agree with the observed ones only with the accuracy of the coefﬁcient 2,
though the correlation coefﬁcient is 0.25 and 0.24.
A special comparison has been made in Mebust et al. (2003) with the use of
observed concentrations of sulphate, nitrate, PM-2.5, PM-10, and organic carbon at
18 stations in June 1995. In this case, comparisons have led to the conclusion that
except good results for sulphate (the mean systematic difference of the mass con-
centration constitutes 0.15 μg m−3, and NMD = 3.1 %), the model gave a systematic
underestimation of concentration in aerosol of nitrate (−0.10 μg m−3, −33.1 %),
PM-2.5 (−3.9 μg m−3, −30.1 %), PM-10 (−5.66 μg m−3, −29.2 %), and organic
carbon (−0.78 μg m−3, −33.7 %). The adequacy of simulation on concentrations of
various components is as follows: sulphate (r2 = 0.63, average error 1.75 μg m−3,
NME = 36.2 %); PM-2.5 (0.55, 5.00 μg m−3, 38.5 %); organic carbon (0.25,
0.94 μg m−3, 40.6 %); PM-10 (0.13, 9.85 μg m−3, 50.8 %), and nitrate (0.01,
0.33 μg m−3, 104.3 %). Except for nitrate, in 75–80 % of cases the calculated values
of concentration agree with those observed within the coefﬁcient 2.
Solar radiation absorption in the atmosphere by BC-containing aerosol can cause
a change of the radiative warming of the atmosphere and surface, which, in turn,
affects the dynamics and hydrological processes responsible for the cloud cover
formation. In this connection, Conant et al. (2002) considered a new microphysical
mechanism of the BC impact on climate, consisting of the fact that the radiative
warming due to solar radiation absorption in the presence of BC-containing CCN
slows down or even prevents CCN from functioning as centers of cloud droplets
formation. The temperature of BC-containing droplets turns out to be higher (as a
5.7
The Numerical Modeling of the 3-D Distribution …
453

result of their warming due to solar radiation absorption) by shares of degree with
respect to the environment, which leads to an increase of water vapor pressure on
droplets and limits an activation caused by most strongly absorbing CCN.
In connection with this, it has been proposed to generalize the Köhler theory
which determines the dependence of the equilibrium water vapor pressure on the
level of water assimilation, with the size of CCN and the share of BC taken into
account. This dependence manifests itself most clearly in case of CCN with the
volume of BC greater than a sphere with D = 500 nm. In the presence of aerosol
with a relative content of BC by mass less than 10 % (per each particle), a 10 %
decrease of CCN number density can occur due to a solar warming, with a 0.01 %
level of critical oversaturation. On the other hand, the effect of warming due to
absorption by BC on activation with a −0.1 % level of critical oversaturation is
negligibly small.
Analysis of observational data has led to the conclusion about a global strato-
sphere cooling during the last decades, though the rate of cooling depended on
duration of observation series and was speciﬁc for various regions of the globe.
While in high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere the cooling trend has been
observed beginning from 1980, in the Northern Hemisphere most substantial
changes took place after 1990. The common opinion about the nature of strato-
spheric cooling in the Southern Hemisphere is based on the fact that it is connected
mainly with chemically induced ozone depletion. Here a mechanism of radiative-
chemical feedback forms, since a cooling leads to ozone depletion. A quite different
situation is observed in the Northern Hemisphere, where the internally induced
climate system’s dynamics should play an important role.
Manzini et al. (2003) undertook a numerical modeling of the atmospheric cir-
culation sensitivity to ozone depletion and to the growth of GHGs concentration,
with chemical reactions in the atmosphere taken into account. With this aim in
view, three series of numerical modeling have been carried out under ﬁxed
boundary conditions for the recent past (1960) and present conditions (1990 and
2000), considering changes of GHGs concentrations, total organic chlorine and
average SST. Changes of the ozone content were calculated with simulation of
interactivity of the processes considered.
The numerical modeling results indicate a decrease of the ozone content in the
stratosphere. Under conditions of the Antarctic, in 1990 and 2000 an “ozone hole”
formed, which was absent, however in 1960, as observations showed. In the
stratosphere and mesosphere, the temperature was decreasing during the whole
period under consideration, which was most clearly manifested at the level of
stratopause and in the lower stratosphere in the region of the South Pole, which
agrees with observational data. In the lower stratosphere of the Arctic, a cooling in
March (compared to 1960 conditions) was detected only from calculations for 2000.
The activity of long waves propagating in winter from the troposphere in 1960
and 2000 turned out to be comparable. This suggests the conclusion about the
contribution of ozone depletion and an increase of GHGs concentration to the
cooling taking place in the lower stratosphere of the Arctic in 1960 and 2000. The
obtained results suggest the conclusion that the extremely low temperatures
454
5
Ecoinformatics Problems of Global Climate Change

observed in March during the last decade, could result from radiative and chemical
processes, though a possible impact of other factors cannot be excluded.
A comparison of numerical modeling results for 1960 and 2000 revealed an
enhancement of downward ﬂuxes in the mesosphere in the period of cooling of the
lower stratosphere (in March in the Arctic and in October in the Antarctic). An
enhancement of downward ﬂuxed (downwelling) in the mesosphere can be explained
as a response of gravity waves to wind intensiﬁcation connected with a cooling of the
lower stratosphere. The downwardshift of the enhanced downwelling with atime shift
of about 1 month can be partially explained by the impact of planetary waves. An
enhancement of the dynamically induced warming connected with an enhanced
downwelling favors a limitation of stratospheric cooling and intensiﬁcation of the
circumpolar vortex in the lower stratosphere and, thus, favors an ozone layer recon-
struction due to such a feedback. Both in the Arctic and in the Antarctic a cooling due
to ozone depletion covers a region where polar stratospheric clouds (PSC) form in
spring, whose extent has increased between 1960 and 2000. The increase of PSC
amount could lead to ozone depletion in 2000 as revealed by calculations.
Based on the use of the NCAR CCM-3 (version 3) model, Kristjansson (2002)
obtained new estimates of the indirect climatic impact of sulphate and BC aerosol
due to the aerosol impact on cloud cover dynamics. Two versions of the aerosol
impact on clouds have been considered. One of them (the ﬁrst indirect effect or the
effect of radius) is connected with that the appearance of additional aerosol particles
as CCN leads to a decrease of the size of cloud droplets. The second indirect effect
manifests itself through a suppressed coalescence of droplets due to a decrease of
the size of droplets and hence, an increase of clouds lifetime (the effect of lifetime).
Both these effects raise the cloud albedo.
The global ﬁelds of aerosol concentration have been simulated in Kristjansson
(2002) with the use of submodels of aerosol formation built in the climate model,
with the respective “life cycles” taken into account. Besides, characteristics of
background aerosol and the dynamics of the background aerosol size distribution
have been described. The droplets number density in liquid-water clouds was
calculated with the prescribed levels of oversaturation. The obtained size distri-
bution of cloud droplets and the outgoing SWR ﬂuxes agree well with the results of
satellite observations.
With the use of the data on aerosol properties contained in IPCC-2001 Report, it
has been shown that in the case of global averaging a 5.3 % decrease of the cloud
droplets radius (by 0.58 μm for the average radius of droplets 10.31 μm) and a 4.9 %
increase of cloud water content due to the impact of anthropogenic aerosol take place.
Maximum changes of these two parameters take place (by the order of their signif-
icance) in the regions of south-eastern Asia (here the content of sulphate aerosol is at
a maximum and the solar zenith angle is at a minimum), Northern Atlantic, Europe,
Siberia, and the eastern USA. Similar changes are also observed in the values of
indirect RF, whose global average value is −1.8 W m−2, with contributions of
changes of droplets’ radius and lifetime being, respectively, −1.3 and −0.46 W m−2.
A repetition of the numerical experiment with the use of calculated data for
2100, according to the IPCC A2 scenario, has not changed the global average
5.7
The Numerical Modeling of the 3-D Distribution …

estimate of RF, but revealed a shift of maximum indirect effect of aerosol to the
tropical zone. Experiments on sensitivity have led to the conclusion that the impact
of changes of cloud droplets radius is about 3 times stronger than that of changes of
clouds lifetime, as well as that the contribution of carbon aerosol is small compared
to total indirect climatic impact of aerosol. An approximate character of the
obtained results is determined, ﬁrst of all, by neglecting some types of aerosol—for
instance, organic carbon aerosol (this is connected with the absence of needed
information about aerosol), as well as an exclusion from consideration of ice clouds
and the impact of the processes discussed on the LWR transfer. The climate model
is planned to be further developed by taking into account the ocean-atmosphere
interaction with stronger emphasis on regional effects.
Cook and Highwood (2004) have been the ﬁrst who undertook a numerical
modeling of the climatic impact of aerosol absorbing solar radiation within the
“interim” model of atmospheric general circulation, IGCM, developed at Reading
University (USA). The 22-layer global model IGCM of the system “atmosphere—
2-m mixed layer of the ocean” has been realized over the grid 5° lat. × 5° long. and
ensures a simulation of equilibrium climate after integration for a period of 5 years
(in fact, calculations have been made for 30 years). The results obtained in Cook
and Highwood (2004) indicate that the sign of direct ARF cannot be considered as a
representative characteristic of the sign of real changes of global average annual
average SAT. The related important fact is that the climatic sensitivity to radiation
absorbing aerosol is much stronger than the climatic sensitivity to the “greenhouse”
warming due to the growth of CO2 concentration. The situation is determined by a
change of cloud amount in the process of climate formation (SAT change).
When single-scattering albedo of the aerosol is <0.95, the low-level cloud amount
decreases, which determines the functioning of the respective positive feedback. On
the other hand, changes of the upper-level cloud amount manifest themselves as the
process of negative feedback formation. The total impact of clouds is determined by
the balance between two effects of the opposite signs and depends strongly on the
choice of the parameterization scheme for the cloud cover dynamics. These results of
numerical modeling revealed a distinct “semi-direct” impact of aerosol on climate. In
this connection, a supposition has been made in Cook and Highwood (2004) that in
all GCM models, the aerosol-cloud feedback due to absorbing aerosols is implicitly
present. This situation suggests the conclusion about critical importance of an
adequate parameterization of cloud cover dynamics (in particular, in the context of
hypothesis of “semi-direct” ARF proposed by Hansen et al. (1997)). According to
IGCM model, clouds play an extremely important role in the formation of the
climatic system’s response to the atmospheric aerosol dynamics.
Takemura et al. (2005) applied a coupled model of the long-range transport and
atmospheric general circulation to estimate changes of cloud cover characteristics,
precipitation, and temperature due to direct and indirect ARF. The obtained esti-
mates of the efﬁcient radius of cloud droplets, cloud-induced RF (CRF) are in
satisfactory agreement with the data of satellite observations. The numerical
modeling revealed a global-scale decrease of an efﬁcient radius of droplets due to
indirect anthropogenic ARF. On the other hand, changes of the cloud water and
456
5
Ecoinformatics Problems of Global Climate Change

precipitation are determined by a variation of the dynamical hydrological cycle with
a temperature change by the aerosol direct and indirect effect rather than the second
indirect effect itself. The global mean direct and indirect anthropogenic ARFs at the
tropopause by anthropogenic aerosols are calculated to be −0.1 and −0.9 W m−2,
respectively. It has been suggested therefore that aerosol particles reduce the
increase in the SAT due to GHGs approximately by 40 %, on the global mean.
Quaas et al. (2004) have used three ensembles of simulations with the LMDZ
general circulation model developed at the Laboratoire de Mètèorologie Dynamique
to assess the radiative impacts of ﬁve GHGs (CO2, CH4, N2O, CFC-11, and CFC-
12), as well as sulphate aerosols for the time period 1930–1989 (sea surface tem-
perature was prescribed). It has been shown that the GHGs concentration increase
results in a reduction of clouds at all atmospheric levels, thus decreasing the total
greenhouse effect in the longwave spectrum and increasing absorption of solar
radiation by reduction of cloud albedo. Since different changes in high- (decrease)
and low-level (increase) cloudiness have been obtained, the ﬁnal result was a
slightly positive net effect due to cloudiness changes. The total aerosol effect
including the aerosol direct and indirect effects remains strongly negative.
Lohmann (2004) has studied the global impact of aerosols on the riming rate of
snow crystals of different shapes with cloud droplets in stratiform clouds using the
AGCM general circulation model to answer the question: can anthropogenic
aerosols decrease the snowfall rate? The ﬁnal answer was that in accordance with
the present-day simulation there had been a slight increase of the snowfall rate over
pre-industrial times.
The opinion expressed by Jacobson et al. (2002) that control of emissions of BC
aerosol and organic matter to the atmosphere due to fossil fuel burning can become
an efﬁcient method of slowing the global warming, has caused a hot discussion.
Feichter et al. (2003) noted this connection that according to estimates obtained by
Jacobson, emissions to the atmosphere of carbon aerosol (BC and organic carbon,
OC) due to fossil fuel burning can cause an increase of global average SAT by
0.35 K. However, there is doubt with respect to grounds for conclusions in this
study connected with, that the emissions under discussion contain also sulphur
dioxide (which determines the formation of sulphate aerosol). Besides, emissions
affect both absorption and scattering of shortwave radiation, which they can cause
both warming and cooling. Still, more important is the fact that the climate model
GATOR-GCMM used by Jacobson has not been tested for adequacy by comparing
with other models and with observational data, which is necessary, especially since
calculations for 6 years cannot ensure a simulation of an equilibrium climate.
Penner (2003) has made some comments.
Chock et al. (2003) have made remarks on the results of Jacobson (2002)
concerning the adequacy of the applied climate model, reliability of input infor-
mation, and substantiation of the needed ecological policy. As for the input
information, it was assumed that annual emissions of BC and OC constituted 6.4
and 10.1 TgC year−1. The assumed ratio OM:BC = 3.1:1 is equivalent to global
emissions of OM and OM-submicron aerosol reaching 19.9 and 15.9 TgC year−1,
respectively, that is, much higher than the estimates mentioned above. Besides,
5.7
The Numerical Modeling of the 3-D Distribution …
457

drawbacks have been noted such as incomplete consideration of climatic indirect
ARF, which leads to a climate cooling, and an unacceptable simpliﬁcation of the
climate model. In his reply to these and other comments, Jacobson (2003 a, b, c)
rejected them as incorrect and groundless.
With respect to the discussion mentioned above, it should be emphasized that the
most important thing, as follows from the above review, is that all earlier obtained
estimates of the impact of aerosol on global climate are highly uncertain.

In the process of measurements or calculations, for each pollutant of the type ξ
the function of concentration distribution Pðu; k; h; tÞ is formed. Depending on
time, at each point ðu; k; hÞ a series of data Pn1; P2
n; . . .; Pn
n; . . . is formed. Because
of measurements and calculations errors due to incorrect data, the choice of situ-
ations Pn\MCLn or Pn  MCLn is made at each time moment t on the basis of the
respective statistical assessment in distinguishing between two versions:
(1) the decision is made on the basis of a totality of indicators, and
(2) the decision is made on the basis of each indicator separately.
In the latter case, the inequality Pn  MCLn is tested for stability during a
prescribed time interval Δt. In the case of meeting the condition Pn  MCLn
during this time interval the display gives a signal with the respective information.
The time Δt is determined at expert level in the process of the system’s exploitation
to minimize the amount of false alarms or, from condition of maximum probability
not to miss a situation with a violated MCL. The actual choice of Δt depends on the
multitude of local anthropogenic and other factors and refers to the user’s com-
petence. To make it easier, as to obtain an expert estimate or to make a decision in
the real time regime, especially in the case of the use of an integral criterion, the
user receives estimates of all indicators on a homogeneous normalized scale.
Let q l; i; j; k
ð
Þ be the indicator of the atmospheric quality in the compartment
Ωi,j,k by the l-th parameter. To reduce all indicators to a single scale, we normalize
them:
Ql ¼ Q l; i; j; k
ð
Þ ¼ q l; i; j; k
ð
Þ= max
i;j;k q l; i; j; k
ð
Þ
Then the results of normalization are smoothed by height (k), latitude (i), longitude
(j) and the whole territory Ω. The smoothed results are used to assess the air quality of
territories by the user’s choice. The ﬁnal decision is made on the basis of comparison
of Ql estimates with a set of threshold values included in data base. The complex
assessment of the state of the atmosphere over a given part of the territory Ω is made
by the vector parameter Q ¼ Q1; . . .; Qn
ð
Þ. This n-dimensional vector belongs to
some indicator space X, each point in which corresponds to a concrete combination of
MCLξ (prescribed by the user). The whole space X is divided into two parts: X0—
pollution does not exceed acceptable levels; X1—pollution reaches a dangerous level.
A concrete realization of Q is estimated by belonging to one of these sub-spaces.
Thus, the main stages of ESPAP functioning are described by the scheme pre-
sented in Fig. 5.22. Of course, the quality of the decisions made depends on the
adequacy of information in the data base. Table 5.20 shows a fragment of the data
base. These database fragments and various modiﬁcations of parametric descrip-
tions of partial processes of aerosol transformation are controlled by a totality of
identiﬁers which the user disposes of through such schemes of interaction with the
system as scrolling windows and hierarchical menu. Therefore, a multitude of
identiﬁers is used at the level of the system’s manager who sees to the compatibility
of its functions.

The ESPAP provides a wide hierarchical dialogue for the user with the computer
version of the simulation system of aerosol propagation in the atmosphere. An
adaptation to the territory in the regime of dialogue is accomplished at the expense
of identiﬁers which ensure the formation of database fragments responsible for the
structure of surface covers, meteorological situation, and environmental parameters
including information about the sources of aerosols and their characteristics. The
operator’s interaction is shown schematically in Fig. 5.23.
The ESPAP operates with schematic maps containing conditional images of the
Earth surface or distributions of the atmospheric parameters. The schematic pre-
sentation of the modeling results is connected with their transformation into one of
the following forms of distribution of the parameter to be estimated:
• schematic representation (1-D, 2-D, 3-D);
• symbolic representation of a 2-D image;
• tabulated representation by a set of formats;

5.9 Modeling Aerosol Transport in the Atmosphere
5.9.1 Relationships Between the Scales of Atmospheric
Mixing Processes and the Choice of Models
An experience gained from many studies on modeling the atmospheric processes of
pollutants transport dictates a necessity to classify these processes in accordance
with interrelationships between spatial and temporal scales (Aloyan 2004; Dimov
et al. 2004; Mehdizadeh and Rifal 2004). The need of this classiﬁcation has been
substantiated in many international programs, such as “Global Changes”, “Global
Atmospheric Chemistry” (IGAC), “Modeling of Global Biogeochemical Cycles”
(MGBC), and others. The need and even necessity of classiﬁcation of physical
processes of atmospheric mixing is dictated by parameters of the systems for
measurements (monitoring) of atmospheric characteristics, requirements of sim-
plicity of the models of the aerosol and gases transport in the atmosphere, as well as

by limitations of available data bases. The interaction of these causes leads to a
range of spatial scales, which provides an efﬁcient parameterization of the processes
of propagation of the atmospheric pollution and agrees with international standards.
At present, the GEODAS standard is the most widespread, it has nine levels of
spatial resolution from one degree to half-second in longitude and latitude. Seven
scales of cartographic presentation of data are provided (Table 5.21).
Data on these scales can be obtained by the synthesis of satellite data and data of
national monitoring systems. The latter are important because they specify the data
domain and select priorities characteristic of a given region. For instance, for
developed countries the operational assessments of air quality in the zones of
megapolises and large industrial enterprises, are of great importance. For devel-
oping countries, the control of trans-boundary transport of pollutants is of principal
importance as well as an assessment of possible change of atmospheric air in
connection with the building of industrial plants. The ratio of scales given in
Table 5.21 corresponds to a majority of situations of atmospheric monitoring.
Along with the problem of choosing the scales of spatial resolution, there is a
problem of their agreement with time scales. This problem is important for the
formation of the structure of numerical models which describe the pollutants’
dynamics in the atmosphere. According to preliminary estimates of the International
Geosphere-Biosphere Program, there is a scale of transitions in temporal and spatial
measurements between complexity and depth of the hierarchic structure of con-
nections considered in the model. So far, the developed models practically ignored
this fact, and therefore it was often impossible to apply them to the natural object
under study. An agreed discretization scale for natural phenomena to be used in
models, proposed by Nitu et al. (2000a, b, 2004), which enables one to classify the
natural phenomena with due account of their hierarchic subordination on temporal
and spatial scales. This classiﬁcation is based on the fundamental understanding of
the hierarchy in the general theory of systems. According to this theory, the
behavior of any complicated system is determined by the triad of frequencies of its
variability, which provides an agreement between coherence and stability of the
system. This makes it possible to exclude from consideration unnecessary details in
the model’s structure, by the prescribed time scale or to establish a minimum time
step from data on spatial scale. For instance, if in the model the time step is chosen
to be equal to 1 year, there is no sense in taking into account such processes as
atmospheric turbulence. In other words, in this case the atmosphere can be

described with a point model, and all attempts to develop complicated constructions
to describe the processes of atmospheric motion, cannot improve the reliability of
the model but will increase its complexity.
A more strict theoretical substantiation of this approach is a combined
description of dynamic processes with different characteristic time scales, which
results in parameters of mathematical description referring to different processes
and strongly (by orders of magnitude) differing from each other. This enables one to
divide these processes into three groups:
• processes referring to a chosen time scale;
• processes which, with respect to time scale, can be considered as being in
dynamic equilibrium (quasi-stationary) and for which some parameterization
can be introduced (fast processes); and
• processes which, with respect to the chosen time scale, can be considered
constant, that is, static (slow processes).
As an example, we take a numerical model of the biogeochemical cycle of
carbon which includes both the geological-time-scale processes and fast processes
(photosynthesis, respiration). If the aim of the model is to study the dynamics of
CO2 content in the atmosphere over several decades, the geological processes with
characteristic timescales of millions of years, should be excluded from consider-
ation and the processes should be parameterized with characteristic timescales of
days, for instance, processes of living biomass formation with photosynthesis. In
general, the problems mentioned have not been solved yet, and there is no con-
structive mechanism for matching the spatial and temporal scales. Each scientist
follows a principle of his own in choosing the model elements for their subsequent
realization. Unfortunately, at this stage there appear unavoidable deviations of the
model from reality.
Characteristic time intervals of variability for most natural processes are well
known. Here are some of them:
• processes of deposition—minutes, hours;
• plants’ transpiration—hours, days;
• formation of plants’ biomass—days, months;
• changes in communities of plants and animals—months, years;
• soil formation—years, centuries; and
• geomorphological processes—centuries, millennia.
Therefore, a systematization of timescales for the processes considered should
follow a synthesis of the system of models. As a result, priorities for models and
their units as well as software structure can be determined.
Because of difﬁculties to parameterize atmospheric processes, there are many
models of atmospheric dynamics. The type of the model correlates strongly with the
spatial scale. A consideration in the models of the processes of physical mixing
together with chemical processes taking place in the atmosphere is determined by the
accuracy level. The developed models, depending on the spatial scale, take into
account processes of physical transformation of pollutants from micro-processes in
5.9

clouds to large-scale atmospheric motions. Depending on this, models are divided into
dispersive, Gaussian, Eulerian and Lagrangian (Rasmussen and Williams 2006;
Rodean 1996; Laudon and Traver 2011). Within this system, there is anhierarchy of
models taking into account or neglecting the vertical structure of the atmosphere,
atmosphere-surface (land, water) interaction, exchange processes between clouds, and
vertical air ﬂuxes depending on relationships between synoptic and physical param-
eters of the atmosphere. One of the examples of such studies is a series of versions of
the ICLIPS model with the spatial resolution 500 × 500 km and a time step of 1 year
(Integrierte Abschatzung von Klimaschutzstrategien) (Toth et al. 2000). A more
accurate model ECMWF (European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast) has
the spatial resolution 150 × 150 km and a time step of 6 h (Gregory et al. 2000).
It is impossible to establish an unambiguous connection between the scale of the
model and its internal infrastructure without taking into account various charac-
teristics of the model. Therefore, the estimates given in Table 5.22 should be
considered as recommendations, directed at the modeler’s aim giving him a pos-
sibility to assess an expedience of including certain components into the model.
5.9.2 Interrelationship Between the Types of Models
and Aerosol Characteristics
The formation of the ﬁelds of atmospheric pollution from natural and anthropogenic
sources depends strongly on the physical characteristics of pollutants. Clearly, for a
complete understanding of the processes of formation and growth of clouds and

precipitation, it is necessary to consider all dynamic microphysical interactive
processes. These processes are determined by a combination of physico-chemical
parameters of the atmosphere itself and pollutant components, which are charac-
terized by strongly variable characteristics such as weight, concentration, size,
shape, phase state, and electric charge. For instance, the classiﬁcation of atmo-
spheric aerosol pollution adopted by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) includes three basic classes and eight sub-classes. This
classiﬁcation is sufﬁcient to be used in models which do not take into account the
size of aerosol particles and do not include the ion-level processes.
The existing classiﬁcation of particles by the size covers the particles’ diameters
from 0.0001 μm to 1 cm. Within this range, solid particles with D = 0.0001–1 μm
are considered as smoke components, while liquid particles are elements of fog.
Particles exceeding 1 μm in diameter are interpreted as dust or spray. Depending on
the size, the role of particles in dynamic processes of atmospheric pollution
changes, too. Particles with diameter less than 1 μm form smog, tens of μm—clouds
and fog, hundreds of μm—haze and drizzle, thousands of μm—rain. This classi-
ﬁcation simpliﬁes the choice of the model’s structure, if the nature of processes of
atmospheric pollution is known. In a more complicated situation, when the size
spectrum of aerosol particles is sufﬁciently broad, the division of pollutants by their
physical and chemical characteristics enables one to synthesize the complicated
model as a totality of hierarchically submitted partial models and to simplify
thereby the procedure of calculation of dynamic characteristics of the polluted
atmosphere.
The physical characteristics of atmospheric pollution include also the rate of
gravitational deposition, residence in the atmosphere, and phase state. Some of the
atmospheric gas components such as N2, O2, He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, and H2 have a
very long lifetime. The lifetime of CO2, O3, N2O, and CH4 is from several years to
decades. Such gases as H2O, NO2, NO, NH3, SO2, H2S, CO, HCl, and I2 live in the
atmosphere only several days or weeks. Depending only on this characteristic to
describe the dynamics of various gases in the atmosphere, one can choose an
adequate model with minimum requirements for database (Kondratyev et al. 2006a;
Bornstein 1999).
For the choice of the type of the polluted atmosphere dynamics model, the size
of an aerosol particle is of great importance. The mentioned intervals only partly
cover a possible classiﬁcation of aerosols. Additional information is needed about
the source of pollutant which further speciﬁes the parametric space of the model.
The knowledge of the cause of pollution simpliﬁes the choice of the model type. Of
course, the classiﬁcation and typiﬁcation of aerosols and gases can be more
detailed. For instance, there are tens of the types of smoke. The size of smoke
particles can be 1–0.01 μm for resin smoke, 0.15–0.01 μm for tobacco smoke, etc.
Here, in the model, it is necessary to consider micro-processes connected with the
motion of these particles. For instance, the run of a particle of carbonaceous smoke
during t seconds averages 0.00068 t/D cm. Filling the base of knowledge of the
monitoring system with such dependences is one of the ﬁrst-priority problems of
ecoinformatics.
5.9
Modeling Aerosol Transport in the Atmosphere

In modeling, the scattering of gases and particles in the atmosphere is important to
know the difference between the polluted and clear atmosphere properties. Also, one
should always bear in mind the vertical heterogeneity of the atmosphere. On a global
scale, the formation of air quality depends on processes at all levels of the atmosphere:
the troposphere, stratosphere, hemosphere, and ionosphere. For instance, in the
problem of the impact of aviation on the atmosphere, it is necessary to take into
account the interaction between the troposphere and stratosphere. In studying the
ﬂuxes of pollutants from the surface sources, the motion of the lower atmosphere is
considered ﬁrst of all. Of course, here of importance is the spatial scale and, hence, the
time interval of the pollutants’ residence in the atmosphere. Data known for the clear
atmosphere should be used in the control simulation experiments.
Pollutants emitted to the atmosphere are subject to gravitational sedimentation,
turbulent mixing, wind-driven transport, and washing out by rain. A totality of these
impacts determines the character of behavior of the polluting cloud, shape and type
of the ﬂux of pollutants, as well as the spatial structure of the distribution of aerosol
number density over a given territory.
Smoke and other atmospheric aerosols are gravitationally inﬂuenced and interact
with solar radiation, gases and ions. In the surface layer, this interaction is sup-
plemented with different effects of the surface (vegetation cover, soil, land surface
roughness, and sea surface roughness).
The role of sedimentation is more substantial in case of large particles, larger in
diameter than sub-micron particles. Small particles sediment are much slower
compared to their transport by the moving atmosphere, and therefore in many models
this vertical constituent is neglected. Note that for the process of sedimentation the
diameter of particles is less important than their density. For instance, soot structures
with a low efﬁcient density and large aerodynamic cross-section are easily wind-
driven and sediment much slower than the compact particles of the same mass. The
rate of sedimentation of particles with D = 0.1–1 μm averages 0.001 m s−1, which is
negligibly small compared to the rate of atmospheric transport.
In case of heavily polluted formations one can observe the process of photo-
phores consisting in particles’ lifting due to non-uniform solar heating. However,
the possibility of this phenomenon and its characteristics have been poorly studied,
therefore in a ﬁrst approximation, many experts leave it out of account, especially
because during time intervals longer than a day, due to Brownian motion, an
irregular heating of particles decreases. Finally, such physical process should be
pointed out as particles coagulation consisting in capture of one particle by another
due to different rates of motion. In this case, particles can either stick together or be
repelled, so that diverse situations of their interactions arise which determine the
shape of the cloud of pollutants and can prolong their lifetime in the atmosphere.
The washing-out is a very important process of removal of pollutants from the
atmosphere. Here two situations are possible. One is connected with a simple
capture of particles by rain droplets, the other—with the so-called nucleation
process. This process is connected with oversaturated water vapor condensation on
470

the surface of aerosol particles, which leads to the formation of water droplets or ice
crystals with subsequent deposition onto land surface. Therefore, one of the ways to
specify the model of aerosol dynamics in the atmosphere is to include them in a unit
of parameterization of water cycle in its different phase states.
The ﬁnal estimation of the residence time for a given pollutant in the atmosphere
is realized with the use of the respective models. This estimation has been given in
detail in Picket (1987), Baltrenas et al. (2003). Here the meteorological features of
pollutants propagation in the atmosphere are described, the scales of transport and
scattering of pollutants are analyzed, models are constructed which predict the
concentration of pollutants, algorithms of parameterization of the processes of
clouds and pollutants’ jets formation are simulated and the ratios are given to
describe the vertical structure of the atmosphere. The Earth’s radiation budget
components are analyzed and the simplest characteristics of relationships between
pressure, wind, temperature, and humidity are given. The state of the atmosphere is
classiﬁed as neutral, unstable and stable by the scale of the vertical temperature
lapse rate, which considerably simpliﬁes the process of parameterization of the
vertical gradients and rates. The scale of atmospheric phenomena is estimated over
the time interval from 1 s to 1 month, and with spatial scale varying from 20 to
1,000 km. Within this scale, processes of transport and scattering of atmospheric
pollutants are analyzed from point sources, as well as moving and covering the ﬁnal
territory.
In general, a change of the concentration of any pollutant C is described with the
following equation:
@C t; u; k; h
ð
Þ=@t þ r  ~VC ¼ rD  rC þ R
ð5:3Þ
where ~V Vu; Vk; Vh


is the wind speed, φ is the latitude, λ is the longitude, h is the
height, t is the time, D is the coefﬁcient of molecular diffusion, R is the change due
to atmospheric turbidity, emission, and mixing.
Detailed description of the terms of Eq. (5.3) needs an analysis of speciﬁc
processes of atmospheric propagation of pollutants and construction of respective
units of a general model (dynamic, correlative, probabilistic, system, evolutionary,
etc.). As examples of such units, we shall consider the parameterizations used
successfully in models ICLIPS, ECMWF, and others.
Problems of chemical interaction of atmospheric pollutants are also important,
and their consideration in modeling further complicates the study. Therefore, most
of the models of pollutants propagation in the atmosphere assume a-priori that all
components are mutually neutral. However, in some cases a parameterization of the
processes of chemical conversion of pollutants is possible due to the use of sta-
tistical characteristics of chemical reactions or by describing the laws of phase
transitions. In particular, a simple model of SO2 conversion into H2SO4 turned out
to be sufﬁciently efﬁcient (Kondratyev et al. 2004a).

where W = 0.1 % day−1 in the daytime and 0.01 % day−1 at night.
Numerous models have been created to simulate the process of sedimentation of
pollutants. So, for instance, Sinik et al. (1985) proposed several parameterizations

over the leeward surface, θ1 is the lower level of potential temperature over the
source of the pollution (°K), |Δθ/Δx3| is the absolute value of the rate of motion over
the source.
The desire to simplify the parameterization of individual sub-processes of the
atmospheric pollution dynamics, led in many cases to the development of sufﬁ-
ciently simple and efﬁcient models, requiring a small database. Numerous studies
472

Ecoinformatics Problems of Global Climate Change

have been dedicated to the classiﬁcation of situations taking place in the real
atmosphere with pollutants emitted from the point sources (stacks, etc.). Sufﬁciently
complete classiﬁcation can be found in Scorer (1997), where ten types are given of
the behavior of the pollutants’ jet (smoke) in the vicinity of an isolated point source
(stack): folded, spiral, ﬂagwise; sedimenting, broadening, expanding, breaking,
bifurcational, fumigating, and rising. In each of these cases a Gauss-type model can
be used with a minimum of input information. The monitoring system should only
be able to distinguish between these situations based on measurements of meteo-
rological parameters. For instance, the folded shape of the jet can be formed due to
a rough surface (high buildings, hilly locality) in clear sunny weather. Smoke
particles are wind-driven in zig-zag inside the broadening and gradually sedi-
menting jet. The breaking jet is typical of the second half of day in summer, when
the atmosphere is well heated, and convective motions of air masses prevail.
One of the units of the atmospheric pollution model describes the process of
emission of aerosol to the atmosphere. In most cases the Gauss-type model is used:




ð5:5Þ
where r is the distance to the center of the pollutants’ jet, σr is the horizontal size of
the jet, f(h) is the vertical distribution of the mass of pollutants, M = QΔt is the mass
of pollutants in the jet, Q is the rate of emission from the source, Δt is the
time step. The f function can be approximated by the following dependence: f
(h) = 1/H for 0.5H < h < 1.5H and 0 in the opposite case (H is the effective height of
the jet). For instance, to calculate H, the following formula has been proposed
Despres et al. (1986):
H ¼

h

Z þ 0:49V1Q0:29
h

(
where Qh is the rate of the heat ﬂux from the source (stack), cal s−1; Z is the height
of the source, m.
To simplify the process of simulation of the pollutants ﬁeld in the zone of the
source, the ﬂux can be quantized into individual formations (small clouds, dust
masses), each being considered separately as a homogeneous cloud. In particular,
for quantization of the ﬂux into n parts over the time Dt, the following formula can
be used: n = 2VDt/H. For instance, at the wind speed V = 5 m/s and Z = 100 m we
obtain that some clusters can be emitted from the stack every 10 s. As a result, the
process of simulating the dynamics of the whole emitted jet is much simpliﬁed. So,
for instance, in modeling the propagation of sulphur one can additionally distin-
guish between sulphur-forming components.

5.9.3 Types of Aerosol Models
Models of the atmospheric pollution dynamics are divided into Gaussian, Eulerian,
and Lagrangian methods of parameterization which describe processes of pollutant
scattering. Within each type there are statistical, box, correlative, and determinate
sub-models. The most important division of the models’ space is the division by the
methods applied, since in this case the models are strictly divided by their infor-
mation bases.
The Gauss-type models need information about the height of the source of
pollutants and dispersion characteristics inside the pollutants’ cloud. Different
approximations of the Gauss jet in the vicinity of a point source depend on
parameters of atmospheric surface layer stability. The model’s conﬁguration is
affected by the geophysical characteristics. With the source present in the zone of
transition from water surface to land, clusters can be selected with stable and
unstable behavior of the pollutants jet. With respect to the horizontal coordinate
x on land, with wind direction along this coordinate, three zones can be selected
with characteristic features: the zone of undisturbed dispersion, the zone of depo-
sition; and the zone of delay. Detailed description of the related models is given in
Eqs. (1.2)–(1.5). These models describe well the ﬁelds of pollutant over territories
on scales up to 100 km. For large territories, other types of models are used.
The information base of the Euler- and Lagrange-type models is formed
according to the Cauchy problem for Eq. (1.5). Depending on a variety of real
situations the data base composition ensuring a realization of the model of the
pollutants transport becomes hierarchical. This hierarchy determines a relationship
between spatial and temporal scales, it determines an accuracy of the model and its
other characteristics. Numerous global data bases consist, as a rule, of information
levels with an object orientation.
Knowledge of the wind ﬁeld components is necessary for modeling the pro-
cesses of atmospheric pollutants propagation over the territory of the region inde-
pendent of a spatial scale. In the presence of many sources of atmospheric pollution
in the region, information is needed about the 3-D wind ﬁeld, and this is only
possible with combined measurements and modeling. Usually, for large regions or
in studies of conditions of pollutants propagation at the land-water boundary, the
grid Euler-type model is used:

For practical application of Eqs. (5.6)–(5.10), the following should be taken into
account: deviation and rising of the ﬂux over the hills, thermal friction, tunneling
effect in valleys, thermal impacts of islands, lakes, and mountains. Additions to the
given system of equations are made proceeding from an actual conﬁguration and
topology of the region.
The Gauss-type models are used, as a rule, to parameterize the processes of
pollutants’ propagation near high sources. The best studied modiﬁcations of the
PGT dispersion model (Pasquill–Gifford–Turner) adequately describes the surface
ﬂuxes of pollutants and less accurately the ﬂuxes formed from the highly located
sources. Raaschou-Nielsen et al. (2000) have modiﬁed the PGT model providing it
with more universal functions for an arbitrary point source. The modiﬁcation is
based on the base Gauss-type model to describe the concentration of pollutants in
the surface layer of the atmosphere:

where Q is the source power, hef is the average height of the pollutants cloud, u is

Important parameters of the model (5.11) are parameters of the pollutant jet
scattering. They are complex functions of the meteorological situations. Theoretical
and observational studies of many authors have shown that the turbulence and
diffusion in the convective boundary layer are controlled by two important
parameters: the height of mixing zi and the scale of convection rate w*:

The vertical σw and horizontal σv constituents of the rate of deviation of the
turbulent ﬂux from the centre of the convective cloud are proportional to w* and,

For the parameter of mechanical scattering σzm the ratio to the rate of mechanical
turbulence σwm is not so simple as in the case of convective turbulence. This is
connected with the fact that the size of the scale characterizing the mechanical scat-
tering, in contrast to the case of convective changes with altitude, is less than the
convection scale. Therefore, for the unstable state the following dependences are used:

where L is the Monin-Obukhov length.
Thus, both terms on the right in formula (5.14) are estimated. Now determine the
σλ parameter in Eq. (5.11). The characteristic of horizontal scattering of the pol-
lutant is well approximated with the formula:

In this expression the ﬁrst and second terms in brackets represent the contri-
bution of convective and mechanical turbulence, respectively. For nocturnal con-
ditions, the ﬁrst term is equal to zero. For the stable atmosphere and at weak winds,
the ratio u=u decreases rapidly with the growing stability. Nevertheless, numerous
observations have shown that the horizontal scattering with an hourly averaging can
exceed the values for the unstable atmosphere. The horizontal rate ﬂuctuates with
the constant amplitude about 0.5 m s−1. As the horizontal scattering remains pro-
portional to ﬂuctuations of horizontal wind, the u* parameter in Eq. (5.19) for the
case of stable stratiﬁcation can be changed for 0.5 m s−1. It means that σλ will never
be less than 0:5u=u.

According to the Eq. (5.11), the accuracy of calculation of the aerosol con-
centration at a point with coordinates (φ, λ) depends substantially on wind speed.
An estimate of the aerosol density in a given space volume depends on the accuracy
of its estimation at a given height. For instance, in the case of unstable stratiﬁcation
the wind speed is approximated with its value at a height of the source, and under
stable conditions the wind speed is calculated by the vertical averaging of its values.
According to Monin and Obukhov (1954), we have

where z0 is the linear size of surface roughness, Ψm are universal functions of

the wind speed is estimated with the formula (5.20) at z ≤zB and is assumed to be
equal to u(z) = u(zB) for all heights z > zB, where zB = max{0.1zi, |L|.
Practical application of the Gauss-type models has many aspects appearing,
depending on the multitude of the factors of the natural-anthropogenic environment.
This includes an effect of buoyancy of aerosol particles in the atmosphere,
intermittent atmospheric layers, and many others. Raaschou-Nielsen et al. (2000)
proposed to calculate the hef parameters using the following formulas:

A multitude of possible situations with the use of the Gauss-type model is
determined by locality topology, the presence of the boundaries of the sea-land
type, mountains, and others. A consideration of a concrete situation enables one to
simplify the formulas and raise their reliability. In particular, Wang and
Christiansen (1986) considered such situations at the lake-land boundary. At the
water-land boundary the air ﬂux is continuously adjusting itself to the wind ﬁeld
conﬁguration forming into jets, corresponding to mechanical and temperature
conditions. Under conditions of a persistent coastal heat layer the gradient of
aerosol concentration can be stable, which depends on the distance of the source
from the shore. Here the following formula is valid:

With the zd value known from (5.21) one can easily ﬁnd zeq, and the effective
height Y of the jet is found as the sum: Y ¼ zeq þ hs, where hs is the height of the
stack. The whole zone of the aerosol cloud propagation with wind s blowing from
the water towards land is divided into zones of stability, instability, and the aerosol
cloud lowering. Such a digitization of space simpliﬁes the model, reducing the
needed data base and increases its reliability. In each zone, the use of the Gauss-
type model leads to a simpliﬁed parameterization of the process of aerosol scat-
tering and facilitates an interpretation of the modeling results.
In the undisturbed dispersion zone, the distribution of the aerosol jet in the
homogeneous stable atmospheric layer is described with the base Gaussian equation

For the leeward distance φ, where 0.47L(φ) ≤σz(φ) ≤0.8L(φ), the concentration
of aerosol is calculated by interpolation between its estimates in the boundary zones
according to formula (5.22).
Modeling the processes of aerosol propagation in the surface layer is connected
with the simulation of dependences on wind speed, air temperature and humidity as
3-D functions of time and space coordinates. One of such models of the planetary
boundary layer (PBL) has been described in Bornstein (1999). The model contains
two units. The ﬁrst unit analytically simulates the PBL processes. The ﬁeld of
aerosol is averaged and presented by a 1-D structure. Another transitional layer of
the atmosphere is described by hydrodynamic and thermodynamic equations solved
numerically with the use of the ﬁnite difference schemes. Equations for the atmo-
spheric transition layer are derived on the assumption that the atmosphere is
incompressible and hydrostatic, water vapour does not change its properties, the
potential temperature is calculated with the formula θ = T + Γz, where T is the air
temperature, Γ is the rate of dry adiabatic cooling, z is the vertical coordinate.
Equations for the atmospheric transition layer are as follows:

(u,v,w) are projections of wind speed onto rectangular coordinates x, y and z,
respectively, KH is the coefﬁcient of horizontal turbulent mixing, ρa is the air
density, q is the speciﬁc humidity. A strict solution of these equations is impossible
in general, and therefore it is necessary to choose a suitable discrete grid on which
these equations are substituted with the ﬁnite-difference equations. The step of time
quantization and the size of discrete space grid should meet the condition:
Dt 	 minfDx=u; Dy=v; Dz=wg.
In practice, instead of this sufﬁciently cumbersome scheme, simulation schemes
are often used based on the acceptable quantization of space. In this case the

of aerosol washing out with precipitation, v2s is the rate of dry deposition, V ¼
fVu; Vk; Vhg are the wind speed components.
The model of this type is used to calculate the aerosol concentration in the
atmosphere, as a rule, for the scales of territory exceeding 50 km. Simpliﬁed
schemes of calculation of the C function are drawn by dividing the space into units
Du  Dk  Dh, and at each height hk a step-by-step calculation of concentration

is made. The calculation scheme can be further simpliﬁed by
dividing the procedure into two stages. First, for each level of the vertical digiti-
zation of space the distribution of Cs t; ui; kj; hk


and then the processes of the
vertical transition of aerosols is taken into account. This scheme enables one to
easily move on to vertically averaged levels depending on available information
about the parameters of the atmospheric vertical stratiﬁcation. Convergence of such
a procedure depends on relationships between the parameters Dt; Du; Dk; Dh.
The Euler-type model contains many degrees of freedom including the consid-
eration of various scenarios. The base of knowledge of the simulation system (the
description of ESPAP is given below) contains sets of parameterizations of partial
processes of aerosol transformation, and a concrete choice is made by the user.
Information in data and knowledge bases are structured according to a multitude of
spatial and object identiﬁers—matrix structures {Am}. In particular, in the “default
mode” regime the following parameterizations are used.
In accordance with the structure of the identiﬁer describing the sources of pol-
lution, in each compartment Δφ × Δλ the passport information about the rates of
emission of the s-th pollutant is put in: minimum and maximum rates Es,min and Es,
max, respectively. In the absence of additional information about some source, the Es
value is calculated according to the procedure of the uniform distribution over the
interval [Es,min, Es,max] or another law of distribution is assumed (e.g., the Gauss law).
The functional description for v1s and v2s is important, and the model’s adequacy
depends on it. Therefore, many studies have been dedicated to this problem. It has
been proven that the following linear approximation of the functions v1s and v2s is
most acceptable:

The coefﬁcient of proportionality Kis can be function of time and space coor-
dinates and depends on the physical state of the surface. With the use of the
identiﬁer ||μij|| this dependence can be broadened. For instance, the version μij = 0
can mean that the dry deposition in the model is neglected at all. For μij = 1 the

for NO2 and HNO3), Hmix is the height of the atmospheric mixed layer (m), d is the
parameter considering the physical state of the surface (d = 1 for dry surface, d = 2
for wet surface, etc.).
With the use of the μij parameter the system of modeling can govern the choice
of various dependences of the rate of dry deposition in a wide range of synoptic
parameters and other environmental characteristics contained in the base of
knowledge. For instance, for μij = 2 the following model is chosen:

By analogy with the previous case, in modeling the rate of wet deposition of

positions, since in general, the v1s value is the function of many factors, some of
them not always being estimated reliably. For convenience of computer modeling,

5.10 Ordinary Climate Parameterizations
The GIMS climate item is the most problematic element for the realization. The use
of existing global climate models as the GIMS item leads to high uncertainty within
the modeling results. In this case, precision and prognosis depth are characterized
by instability and low reliability. The use of small climate models gives the pos-
sibility to reduce these negative circumstances, but leads to other restrictions.
Actual climate predicting procedures as a background process in GIMS are usually
changed by climate scenarios. Different international and national institutes try to
elaborate such scenarios. The Climate Scenario section of the Data Distribution
Centre (DDC) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is one of
them. The DDC distributes a number of datasets, derived from various climate
modeling experiments, using general circulation models (GCMs) that are com-
monly used in the construction and application of climate change scenarios for
climate change impacts assessments. The intention is to provide a common set of
scenario data for use in climate impacts research that may get reported in the Fourth
Assessment Report of the IPCC and beyond (IPCC 2007; Pachauri and Reisinger
2007).
Mu et al. (2002) investigated the uncertainties caused by the errors of the initial
states and the parameters in the numerical model. Three problems of predictability
in numerical weather and climate prediction are proposed, which are related to the
maximum predictable time, the maximum prediction error, and the maximum
admissible errors of the initial values and the parameters in the model respectively.
The three problems are then formulated into nonlinear optimization problems.
Effective approaches to deal with these nonlinear optimization problems are pro-
vided. The Lorenz’ model is employed to demonstrate how to use these ideas in
dealing with these three problems.
Therefore, one of the most important problem within the global and regional
studies of the NSS is the generation of climate forecast systems of various seasonal-
to-decadal time scales. These systems are to have input information which can be
delivered by existing or monitoring systems planned. Energy use statistics has
principal importance in this aspect. Figure 5.24 shows a huge discrepancy between
the highest energy users and the lowest. Knowledge this statistics can help to form
the more realistic climate scenarios.
Authors of NRC (2013) note that more accurate forecasts of climate conditions
over time periods of weeks to a few years could help people plan agricultural
activities, mitigate drought, and manage energy resources, amongst other activities.
However, current forecast systems have limited ability on these time-scales. Models
for such climate forecasts must take into account complex interactions among the
ocean, atmosphere, and land surface. Such processes can be difﬁcult to represent
realistically. To improve the quality of forecasts, NRC (2013) makes recommen-
dations about the development of the tools used in forecasting and about speciﬁc
research goals for improving.

Ecoinformatics Problems of Global Climate Change

Development of global model for the assessing nature-society system dynamics
is impossible without adequate climate model. Existing climate models practically
have not biospheric components. Complexity of these models results to the insta-
bility of prognosis. Therefore, really climatic blocks of future global model are to be
based on simple climate models such as it is shown in Fig. 5.25.
It is evident that the climatic component of global biospheric model is most
difﬁcult for the synthesis, since it is characterized by numerous feedbacks, most of
which are unstable. As it was above mentioned these feedbacks include ice-albedo,
watervapor-radiation, cloud-radiation, and aerosol-radiation. That is why there are
two main approaches to climate model synthesis. One approach is based on
inclusion of biospheric components in climate models that have already been
created or developed. The other approach consists in development of a unit within

the numerical model of the biosphere which would simulate the dependences of
biospheric components on climate parameters. In the ﬁrst case, unstable solutions of
respective systems of differential equations appear problematical, which hinders
prognostic estimates of global environmental change. In the second case, there is a
probability to obtain stable forecasts of environmental change, but their reliability
depends on the accuracy of parameterization of correlations between elements of
the biosphere and climate. The second approach has the advantage of incorporating
models which can be described at a scenario level.

The Arctic Environmental Problems
6.1 Introduction
Arctic region is currently undergoing unprecedented warming and drying, as well as
dramatic changes in human use. Global climate change science includes important
themes related to the understanding of annual and inter-annual balances of carbon,
methane, water and other greenhouse gases and their stability. In cases when the
concentration of the main greenhouse gas is continuing to increase at an alarming
rate, the Arctic Basin obtains important role as possible global climate regulator.
Speciﬁc importance in this aspect belongs to arctic soils in the tundra and permafrost.
Due to microorganism activity, thawing tundra releases the CO2 with increasing rate
when atmospheric temperature is growing.
Arctic- wide inter-governmental cooperation protecting the Arctic environment
formally began in 1991 with the establishment of the Arctic Environmental Pro-
tection Strategy (AEPS), which was later transformed into the Arctic Council in
1996. Recent growing attention to the Arctic environmental problems is motivated
by a number of circumstances, including (AMAP 2010; Walker et al. 1998, 2008;
Callaghan et al. 2011; Girnis et al. 2003; Krapivin and Mkrtchyan 2009b, c, 2010,
2012; Nitu et al. 2010; Peterson and Krantz 2008; Prestrud et al. 2007; Schneider
2006; Shapovalov 2010; Shultze et al. 2001):
(1) a stronger sensitivity of high latitude environment to various external forcings;
(2) better understanding of the importance of numerous interactions and depen-
dencies between components of the Earth’s system; and
(3) increasing necessity to use natural resources located at high latitudes (Arctic
shelf especially).
It is fair to say (Vörösmarty et al. 2001) that “the Arctic system constitutes a
unique and important environment with a central role in the dynamics and evolution
of the Earth system”. Some of the recent scientiﬁc results have been highlighted in
the ACIA Implementation Plan (ACIA 2000):

• There has been increased coastal erosion in the Bering Sea from storm surges,
resulting from reduced sea ice.
• Sea ice extent in the Arctic has decreased overall by 0.35 % per year since 1979.
During summer of 1998, the record reduction of sea ice coverage was observed
in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. Sea ice area is assessed by 11,827,773 km2
on December 2013.
• Sea ice thickness has also been reduced by one to two meters in most parts of
the Arctic Ocean and the sub-Arctic seas. On October 2013, the multiyear ice
had been on average at about 20 %, or around 30 cm, thicker than last year.
• Stream ﬂow discharge of major Siberian Rivers into the Arctic Ocean was
increased in recent years and is associated with a warmer climate and enhanced
precipitation in the river basins.
• Since 1970, the Arctic Oscillation, which is a measure of the strength of the
circumpolar vortex, has strengthened. This has been found to be consistent with
temperature change in the Arctic.
• There has been a raise in temperatures of the water in the Arctic Ocean’s
Atlantic layer and an approximate 20 % greater coverage of Atlantic waters.
• Record of low levels of ozone was measured in 2000 in the Arctic, with
increasing evidence that these levels are likely to continue for at least the next
20 years.
• Ongoing studies indicate that the current UV levels can have a signiﬁcant effect
on the ﬁsh larvae survival rates.
• General warming of the soils in regions with permafrost, speciﬁcally from
Alaskan regions, has been observed over recent years.
It has been emphasized in ACIA (2000) that past assessments indicated that the
Arctic is important to global-scale processes in at least four important ways:
• The thermohaline circulation dominated by the Arctic Ocean and Nordic Seas is
responsible for a considerable part of the Earth’s pole ward heat transport and
may also serve as a sink for CO2. Alterations of this circulation, as have been
observed during climatic changes of the past, can affect global climate and in
particular the climate of Europe and North America.
• The melting of the Arctic land ice sheets can cause sea level rise around the
world. A compilation of studies suggests that a global warming of 1 °C will lead
to *1 mm raise per year of the sea-level from small ice caps and glaciers. The
Arctic will supply over half of this total, with an additional 0.3–0.4 mm per year
contribution from Greenland, although uncertainties remain about the mass
balance of the Greenland ice sheet.
• Arctic soils can act as either sinks or sources of greenhouse gases, depending on
temperature and moisture changes within the Arctic. Moisture has contradictory
effects on the concentrations of the two major trace gases: CH ﬂux declines with
soil drying while CO2 ﬂux initially increases. These changes can inﬂuence
greenhouse gas warming globally.

The Arctic Environmental Problems

• Our current understanding of the Arctic climate system suggests that positive
feedbacks in high-latitude systems, including the snow and ice albedo effect,
amplify anthropogenic ally-induced atmospheric changes. These disturbances in
the circumpolar Arctic climate may substantially inﬂuence global climate.
In the context of the health of the Arctic marine environment (Fig. 6.1), from the
viewpoint of proper functioning of economically important ecosystems, Drewry
and Orheim (2000) have formulated a number of key questions:
• How was the polar basin-formed, where are the plate boundaries?
• What has been the detailed paleo-climatic history of the high Arctic Ocean
during the last 1 million years?
• Do decreases in the ice extent and upper stratiﬁcation of the ocean signal a
different sea ice regime?

Introduction

• What is the stability of the sea ice cover, what are the effects of radiative
feedback in the Arctic and how do they modulate global ocean circulation?
• What is the role of continental shelves in the cycling of C, N, Si and other
chemicals?
• What is the productivity of the Arctic Ocean, and what is the structure and
diversity of higher trophic levels?
• What are the effects of environmental changes, both of climate and of pollutants
and contaminants such as the introduction of POPs into the food chain?
There are numerous other problems related to the Arctic Basin. For example,
glaciers and ice sheets modulate global sea level by storing water deposited as snow
on the surface and discharging water back into the ocean through melting and via
icebergs. At present time, the study of these processes is made easier by means of
satellite observations. Existing satellites make possible monitoring of Polar
Regions, location of the ice layer and measurements of the topography and prop-
erties of the glacier bed as well as ice thickness.
Of particular interest is the high-latitude climate dynamics. According to Weller
and Lange (1999), “While considerable uncertainty still exists about the exact
nature of the future impacts of global climate change, there can no longer be any
doubt that major changes in the climate have occurred in recent decades in the
Arctic, with visible and measurable impacts following the climatic changes. Greater
impacts are likely in the future and while some of them will be positive, others will
be detrimental to human activities”.
Recent analysis of ice cores from the Arctic (Everett and Fitzharris 2001) has
revealed large-scale and rapid paleo-climate changes. Rapid warming took place
*11,500 years ago, at the end of the last glacial period. The coldest parts of ice
cores had been as much as 21 °C colder than the present temperature in Central
Greenland; and the temperatures increased by more then 10 °C in a few decades.
There is evidence of even more rapid change in the precipitation pattern, rapid
changes of atmospheric circulation, and periods of rapid warming during the past
20,000 years. Rapid temperatures increase of *10 °C in a few decades during the
last glacial period in Central Greenland had been followed by periods of slower
cooling over a few centuries and then a generally rapid return to glacial conditions.
About 20 such intervals, each lasting between 500 and 2,000 years, occurred during
the last glacial period.
It has been emphasized (Everett and Fitzharris 2001; Singer 2008; Vakulenko
et al. 2004) that the polar systems are extremely sensitive to the variations in
temperature, and several aspects of these systems will be affected by any further
climate change. The primary impact will be on the physical environment, including
ice, permafrost, and hydrology; on biota and Ecosystems, including ﬁsheries and
terrestrial systems; and on human activities, including social and economic impacts
on settlements, on resource extraction and transportation, and on existing infra-
structure. Scenario predictions of potential future global warming indicate a
necessity to particularly take into account various phenomena such as thermocarst
490

erosion in lowland areas, thawing of permafrost accompanied by hydrological and
climatic changes. Climate change will affect terrestrial ecological systems through
changes in permafrost as well as direct climatic changes, including changes in
precipitation, snow cover, and temperature. Terrestrial ecosystems are likely to
change from tundra to boreal forests, although vegetative changes are likely to lag
behind climatic change. Major shifts in biomass will be associated with changes in
microbiological (bacteria, algae, etc.) and insect communities (some of them may
diminish while others prosper).
It has been pointed out (Everett and Fitzharris 2001) that in the recent geologic
past, the tundra was a carbon sink, but recent climate warming in the Arctic,
coupled with the concomitant drying of the active layer and the lowering of the
water table, has shifted areas of the Arctic from sinks to sources of CO2 (this
problem is, however, far from being solved). An important potential consequence
of permafrost thawing is emissions of methane—a greenhouse gas. As for tropo-
spheric ozone, another greenhouse gas, changes might happen due to warming of
the troposphere (Kondratyev and Varotsos 2000; Varotsos 2005).
An interesting illustration of potential future surprises due to interactions and
feedbacks has been discussed by Stevenson et al. (2000) who obtained future
estimates of tropospheric ozone radiative forcing and methane turnover in the
context of the impact of climate change (it should be pointed out that studies of the
contribution of tropospheric ozone, O3T, as a greenhouse gas as well as assessments
of potential impact of global warming on permafrost melting and methane emis-
sions are still at the preliminary stage of development). Interactive simulations of
climate dynamics and O3T changes during the period of 1990–2100, for scenarios
of “high” (A2) or “central” (B2) cases of CO2 emissions, resulted in tropospheric
ozone radiative forcing (RF) equal to +0.27(A2) or +0.09(B2) Wm−2, if climate-
ozone coupling was neglected, then relevant RF values were equal to +0.43
(+0.22) Wm−2. When climate change was included, CH4 lifetime fell by 0–5 %.
Hence, climate warming exerts a negative feedback on itself by enhancing O3T and
CH4 destruction.
The three principal achievements have stimulated during the recent years the
progress in studying the Arctic environment (Dickson 1999; Baker 2011; Vallis and
Thoumi 2012):
(1) further development of observation programs with the usage of various
observation means (including satellites and submarines);
(2) declassiﬁcation of the military Soviet-American archive of ocean “climatol-
ogy” data; and
(3) discovery of the fact that the climatic forcing in the Arctic region and northern
seas in the 1990s has increased in comparison with that observed during the
previous century [similar situation also took place with respect to climate
dynamics indicators (such as Arctic Oscillation (AO) and North-American
Oscillation (NAO))].
Overland and Adams (2001) have pointed out that “decadal differences between
the 1990s and 1980s in winter sea-level pressure and 300 hPa zonal winds have an

Arctic-centered character with nearly equal contributions from the Atlantic and
Paciﬁc sectors. In contrast, the differences between positive and negative AO
composites deﬁned from monthly values of Principal Components from the same
period have similar magnitudes in the Paciﬁc and Arctic, but have additional large
NAO signature in the Atlantic sector. Thus Arctic changes of decadal scales are
more symmetric with the pole than suggested by the standard AO index deﬁnition.
Change point analysis of the AO shows that a shift in value near 1989 is an
alternative hypothesis to a linear trend. Analysis of zonal and meridional winds by
longitudinal sectors shows the importance of the standing wave pattern in inter-
preting the AO, which supplements the view of the AO as a simple zonal average
(annular) mode”. Thus the Arctic Oscillation should be considered as a physical
phenomenon connected with the enhancement of circumpolar vortex and relevant
mass and temperature changes in the stratosphere.
By the end of the 1980s—the beginning of the 1990s a very strong NAO
enhancement resulted in powerful transport of warmer and fresher Norwegian
Atlantic waters to the north of the Fram Strait and the Barents Sea. Entering the
Arctic, the sub-layer of Atlantic waters was becoming thinner, warming (by about
2 °C) and increasing its horizontal extent (*20 %). At smaller depths, the cold
haloclyne (which thermally isolates the sea ice cover from the warm Atlantic layer
located below) shifted towards the euro-asiatic basin, which resulted in substantial
changes of mass and energy balances of the ice cover surface. This and other
phenomena have been studied within a number of recent programs such as ASP
(Arctic Studies Program), ISAC (International Study of Arctic Change), SEATCH
(NOAA Study of Environmental Arctic Change), etc. The climatic impact of
polynyas is of particular interest (Schrank 2007).
Alekseev (1998) has emphasized that the Arctic is in many respects a key part of
the global climatic system, where the strongest natural ﬂuctuations of climatic
characteristics develop. The global impact of the Arctic is primarily accomplished
through the Arctic Ocean, which is capable of changing its structure circulation
regime under the inﬂuence of changes in fresh water, salt and heat exchange with
the non-polar parts of the global system. The freshened upper layer and sea ice
located above it turn out to be the most active components, with fresh water, heat
and salt transport being the major processes responsible for coupling between the
high-latitude environment and its lower-latitude parts.
Speciﬁc features of the arctic atmosphere such as phenomena of Arctic Haze as
well as extended cloudiness and radiation, have been studied during the period of
the First GARP (Global Atmospheric Research Programme) Global Experiment—
FGGE (Kondratyev et al. 1992; Kondratyev 1999).
Important progress has been achieved in the ﬁeld of arctic climate diagnostics.
Basic features of arctic climate dynamics have been demonstrated, such as strong
space and time variability of various scales. For example, it was shown, that as far
as inter-annual lower troposphere variations are concerned, before the 1980s neg-
ative anomalies had prevailed, while later on, for the whole troposphere, positive
temperature anomalies were typical. However, the total polar atmosphere energy
(potential plus internal) during the previous 40 years has not changed.

The Arctic Environmental Problems

Much more difﬁcult situation exists in the ﬁeld of numerical modeling of high-
latitude climate change. It has been mentioned in the Report (2001) that current
estimates of future changes to the Arctic vary signiﬁcantly. The model results
disagree as to both the magnitude of changes and the regional aspects of these
changes.
Climate variability and change have become important issues in the Arctic
region over the recent decades. These issues have also prevailed in numerous
international and national programs of scientiﬁc research. The most essential results
of a penetrating analysis of these researches consist in the improvement of arctic
science about key interactions among major components of the Arctic climate
system in conditions of human activity growth (Fig. 6.2).
6.2 Climate and Cryosphere
6.2.1 Cryosphere Interactions with the Global Climate
System
Walker et al. (2004) mention that the atmosphere-permafrost system plays impor-
tant role in the global gas exchange processes which is comparable with the role of
tropical ecosystems in the regulation of biogeochemical cycles. After all, knowl-
edge of organic matter decomposition processes and vital functions of poor vege-
tation covered in arctic latitudes, without doubt, allows the signiﬁcant reduction of
uncertainty in the assessment of sources and sinks of greenhouse gases and, most of

all, carbon dioxide. In particular, Table 6.1 shows that division of the tundra soil
into acid and no acid, inﬂuences on this assessment. Study of arctic ecosystems and
their role in biogeochemical cycles is realized in framework of series scientiﬁc
programs between of which LAII (Land-Atmosphere-Ice Interactions) and ATLAS
(Arctic Transitions in the Land-Atmosphere System) are notable for investigation of
ﬂuxes of water, energy and GHGs in the Arctic as well as for mapping the spectral
reﬂection and zonal boundaries between ecosystems.
An important step forward in studying the Arctic environment is the Climate and
Cryosphere (CliC) Project (Allison et al. 2001). The term “cryosphere” describes
those portions of the Earth’s surface, where water is in solid form. This includes all
kinds of ice and snow and frozen ground, such as permafrost. The main components
of the cryosphere are snow, river and lake ice, sea ice, glaciers and ice caps, ice
shelves, ice sheets, and frozen ground. In terms of the ice mass and its heat capacity,
the cryosphere is the second largest component of the climate system (after the
ocean). Its inﬂuence for climate variability and change is based on physical prop-
erties, such as its high surface reﬂectivity (albedo) and the latent heat associated
with phase changes, which have a strong impact on the surface energy balance.
The cryosphere is an important part of the global climate system. It is strongly
inﬂuenced by temperature, solar radiation and precipitation, and, in turn, inﬂuences
each of these properties. It also has an effect on the exchange of heat and moisture
between the Earth’s surface (land or sea) and the atmosphere, on clouds, on river
ﬂow (hydrology), and on atmospheric and oceanic circulation. Parts of the cryo-
sphere are strongly inﬂuenced by changes in climate. The cryosphere may therefore
act as an early indicator of both natural and human-induced climate changes.
The cryosphere on land stores about 75 % of the world’s freshwater. The
volumes of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets are equivalent to approximately

7 and 57 m of sea level rise, respectively (Heil and Allison 1999). Changes in the
ice mass on land have contributed to recent changes in sea level. On a regional
scale, many glaciers and ice caps play a crucial role in freshwater availability.
Presently, ice permanently covers 10 % of the land surface, of which only a tiny
fraction lies in ice caps and glaciers outside Antarctica and Greenland. Ice also
covers approximately 7 % of the oceans in the annual mean. In midwinter, snow
covers approximately 49 % of the land surface in the Northern Hemisphere (NH).
Frozen ground has the largest area of any component of the cryosphere. All parts of
the cryosphere contribute to short-term climate changes, with permafrost, ice
shelves and ice sheets also contributing to longer-term changes including the ice
age cycles.
As a core project of the World Climate Research Programme, the CliC project
encourages and promotes research into the cryosphere and its interactions as part of
the global climate system. It seeks to focus attention on the most important issues,
encourage communication between researchers with common interests in cryo-
spheric and climate science, promote international co-operation, and highlight the
importance of this ﬁeld of science to policy makers, funding agencies, and
the general public. CliC also publicizes signiﬁcant ﬁndings regarding the role of the
cryosphere in climate, and recommends directions for future study.
CliC aims to improve understanding of the cryosphere and its interactions with
the global climate system, and to enhance the ability to use parts of the cryosphere
for detection of climate change. The scientiﬁc goals of CliC are to:
• improve understanding of the physical processes through which the cryosphere
interacts within the climate system;
• improve the representation of cryospheric processes in climate models;
• assess and quantify the impacts and consequences of past and future climatic
variability on components of the cryosphere; and
• enhance the observation and monitoring of the cryosphere.
To attain these goals, CliC seeks to develop and coordinate national and inter-
national activities aimed at increasing the understanding of four main scientiﬁc
themes:
1. Interactions between the atmosphere and snow and ice on the land surface.
2. Interactions between glaciers and ice sheets and sea level.
3. Interactions between sea ice, oceans, and the atmosphere.
4. Interactions of the cryosphere with the atmosphere and oceans on a global scale.
CliC encourages the use of observations, process studies and numerical mod-
eling within each of the above topic areas. In addition, CliC promotes the estab-
lishment of new cryospheric monitoring programs. The cryosphere is also
considered as an indicator of climate variability and change. It has been pointed out
in (Allison et al. 2001): “Atmosphere-snow/ice-land interactions are concerned with
the role of the terrestrial cryosphere within the climate system and with improved
understanding of the processes, and of observational and predictive capabilities
applicable over a range of time and space scales. Better understanding of the
6.2
Climate and Cryosphere

interactions and feedback of the land/cryosphere system and their adequate
parameterization within climate and hydrological models are still needed. Speciﬁc
issues include the interactions and feedback of terrestrial snow and ice in the current
climate and their variability; in land surface processes; and in the hydrological
cycle. Improved knowledge is required of the amount, distribution, and variability
of solid precipitation on a regional and global scale, and its response to a changing
climate. Seasonally-frozen ground and permafrost modulate water and energy
ﬂuxes, and the exchange of carbon, between the land and the atmosphere. How do
changes of the seasonal thaw depth alter the land-atmosphere interaction, and what
will be the response and feedback of permafrost to changes in the climate system?
These issues require improved understanding of the processes and improved
observational and modeling capabilities that describe the terrestrial cryosphere in
the entire coupled atmosphere-land-ice-ocean climate system.
Over a considerable fraction of the high-latitude global ocean, sea ice forms a
boundary between the atmosphere and the ocean, and considerably inﬂuences their
interaction. The details and consequences of the role of sea ice in the global climate
system are still poorly known. Improved knowledge is needed for the broad-scale
time-varying distributions of the physical characteristics of sea ice, particularly ice
thickness and the overlying snow-cover thickness, in both hemispheres, and the
dominant processes of ice formation, modiﬁcation, decay, and transport which
inﬂuence and determine ice thickness, composition and distribution. We do not
know how are accurate the present model predictions of the sea ice responses to
climate change, since the representation of much of the physics is incomplete in
many models. It will be necessary to improve coupled models considerably to
provide this predictive capability.
Key issues on the global scale are: understanding the direct interactions between
the cryosphere and atmosphere, correctly parameterizing the processes involved in
models, and providing improved data sets to support these activities. In particular, it
is needed an improved interactive modeling of the atmosphere-cryosphere surface
energy budget and surface hydrology, including fresh-water runoff.
The scientiﬁc strategy for CliC project is similar in each of the areas of inter-
action: a combination of measurement, observation, monitoring and analysis, ﬁeld
process studies and modeling at a range of time and space scales. A CliC modeling
strategy must address improved parameterization in models of the direct interac-
tions between all components of the cryosphere, the atmosphere, and the ocean. It
will need to do this at a variety of scales from the regional to global; and with an
hierarchy of models ranging from those of individual processes to fully coupled
climate models. It will also be essential to provide the improved data sets needed for
validation of models and parameterization schemes.”
Table 6.2 data characterizes major components of the cryosphere. It has been
mentioned in (Allison et al. 2001) that the processes in the coupled cryosphere-climate
system involve three time scales—intraseasonal-interannual, decadal-centennial, and
millennial or longer. The longest time scale is addressed through the IGBP PAGES
program, although abrupt climate shifts evidenced in ice core and ocean sediment
records (Heinrich events, involving extensive deposition of ice-rafted detritus in the
496

The Arctic Environmental Problems

North Atlantic) are also highly relevant to CliC. The other two time scales are com-
mensurate with WCRP interests, as manifest in ACSYS, GEWEX and CLIVAR. In the
space domain, cryospheric processes and phenomena need to be investigated over a
wide range of scales from meters to thousands of kilometers.
It is evident that changes in the Arctic’s climate are a result of complex inter-
actions between the cryosphere, atmosphere, ocean, and biosphere (Callaghan et al.
2011). Studying the cryosphere dynamics is of importance for many applications. In
particular, changes in cryosphere play signiﬁcant role in the socio-economic sectors

worldwide. Main cryosphere factor such as ice volume can lead to catastrophic
consequences. Upon the whole, cryosphere factors include (Allison et al. 2001):
• Land/ice melt contribution to sea level.
• Snow/glacier melt runoff.
• Thaw of clathrates.
• Loss of glaciers.
Tables 6.2 and 6.3 data illustrate some of possible effects depending on the
climate-cryosphere system dynamics. Discrepancy between some data of these
tables says about existing uncertainties in this area. It is evident that different parts
of the cryosphere play various roles in the climate change. The amount of snow and
ice that melts each summer is increasing because of global warming. Main focus is
made on the potential role of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets a total melting
of which can raise global sea level by 7.3 and 56.6 m, respectively. Forecasting this
process is main task of present science. Solution of this task is possible by means of
the GMNSS taking into consideration of information about time scales of the
cryosphere components.
Four overarching goals that address major concerns for the WCRP can be
identiﬁed (Allison et al. 2001). These are:
1. To improve understanding of the physical processes and feedbacks through
which the cryosphere interacts within the climate system.
2. To improve the representation of cryospheric processes in models to reduce
uncertainties in simulations of climate and predictions of climate change.
3. To assess and quantify the impacts of past and future climatic variability and
change on components of the cryosphere and their consequences, particularly
for global energy and water budgets, frozen ground conditions, sea level change,
and the maintenance of polar sea-ice covers.

The Arctic Environmental Problems

4. To enhance the observation and monitoring of the cryosphere in support of
process studies, model evaluation, and change detection.
Speciﬁc questions that help deﬁne the primary tasks of CliC are:
(i)
How stable is the global cryosphere?
• How well do we understand and model the key processes involved in
each cryospheric component of the climate system?
• How do we best determine the rates of change in the cryospheric components?
(ii)
What is the contribution of glaciers, ice caps and ice sheets to changes in
global sea level on decadal-to-century time scales?
• How can we reduce the current uncertainties in these estimates?
(iii)
What changes in frozen ground regimes can be anticipated on decadal-to-
century time scales that would have major socio-economic consequences,
either directly or through feedback on the climate system?
(iv)
What will be the annual magnitudes, rates of change, and patterns of seasonal
redistribution in water supplies from snow- and ice-fed rivers under climate
changes?
(v)
What will be the nature of changes in sea-ice mass balance in both polar
regions in response to climate change?
(vi)
What is the likelihood of abrupt climate changes resulting from regime
changes in ice shelf—ocean and sea ice—ocean interactions that impact the
ocean thermohaline circulation?
(vii)
How do we monitor cryospheric components as indicators of change in the
climate system?
Monitoring cryosphere dynamics is a key aspect of high-latitude environmental
studies, especially because of a rather controversial information concerning ice
cover dynamics. It is true, for instance, for ice thickness observations. Holloway
and Sou (2001) have pointed out that “while submarine records had indicated a
stunningly rapid thinning, model results show that the position of submarine
observations was exceptionally biased towards regions of thinning. A conclusion is
that observation to date, along as with much physics as models represent, imply
little or no overall thinning”.
6.2.2 Some Problems of the Permafrost Melting Feedback
to Global Climate Change
Northern ecosystems play signiﬁcant role in global climate change. This fact is
studied by many experts. Particularly, Eastern Siberia refers to these ecosystems. The
territory of Eastern Siberia (7.3 million km2) occupies a signiﬁcant part of the
Northern Hemisphere and plays an important role for the climate system of the Earth.
6.2
Climate and Cryosphere
499

Cryosphere and atmosphere are two (of the ﬁve) sub-systems of the climate
system, which in turn is a sub-system of the global system. Nowadays, a crucial
problem is that of climate change and its impacts. Frequently, with the term
“climate change” we mean the occurrence of abnormal meteorological phenomena
(e.g. heat-waves, tornadoes, ﬂoods, etc.), considering sometimes that it is a result of
the uncontrolled human activities, ignoring completely the natural variability. Thus,
we reach to conclusions about the climate system states, taking into account one or
a few parameters of one of its sub-systems only, assuming that the rest parameters
and the other sub-systems remain constant. It is obviously a ﬂaw that leads to a
vicious circle. We should not ignore that the climate subsystems are in a continuous
interaction that is taking place, in general, between non-linear interactive processes.
A typical example is the interaction between cryosphere and atmosphere, which is
not only limited at their interface. Many authors are aimed in current research to
ﬁnd new links connecting these interactive processes which could shed light to
various climate mechanisms that still remain under investigation.
Nowadays, it is generally recognized that under the global warming conditions,
the high latitude regions will be more sensitive to the induced impacts. Speciﬁcally,
the increase in the surface air temperature (SAT) will be more signiﬁcant at the
above-said geographical area and the response of the cryosphere to this atmospheric
effect will be more considerable over Arctic and Sub-Arctic, than elsewhere. Since
the late of 19th century, observational data revealed that, SAT in Eastern Siberia
has increased by 10 °C during wintertime, and by almost 2.0–3.5 °C on an annual
basis. In particular, the SAT increase was most pronounced in the second half of the
20th century (especially in the 1970–1980s).
The environmental changes at the Arctic and Sub-Arctic regions are of crucial
importance for the additional reason that their ecosystems are considerably more
vulnerable to anthropogenic forcings, than the corresponding ecosystems of other
latitudes, mainly because the processes in the Arctic and Sub-Arctic environments
are relatively slower. For example, the living organisms in the permafrost eco-
systems live in the polar climate, where the vegetation period is seriously restricted.
There, the feedback mechanisms operate with signiﬁcant time delays and the
capacity to neutralize the effects of human activity appears to be weak. In addition,
the Arctic and Sub-Arctic ecosystems have speciﬁc boundary conditions that are
closely associated with the permafrost boundary that reduce its ability to recover.
A quantitative forecast of changes in the balance of water, heat and carbon in the
cryogenic ecosystems of the Eastern Siberia (e.g. forest and tundra) under global
climate change conditions, requires:
• long time-series of ground-based and satellite observations in order to regularly
monitor the accumulating ability of cryolithozone ecosystems, as well as
• development of adequate models providing the regional balance of carbon.
Another serious impact of the SAT increase is the ice melting, which results in
the release into the troposphere and sometimes in the stratosphere of substantial
amounts of the heat-trapping carbon dioxide and methane emitted from the cryo-
sphere, thus accelerating the climate change (e.g. by enhancing the formation of
500
6
The Arctic Environmental Problems

clouds) and the stratospheric ozone loss. The latter would allow substantial
enhancement to the biologically effective ultraviolet radiation to reach Earth, with
potential adverse effects on ecosystems.
In conclusion, a multi-component and large-scale ﬁeld campaign over Arctic and
Sub-Arctic regions will address questions about the major adverse effects of the
global warming to the local ecosystems, improving the reliability of relevant
models and the current understanding of the above-mentioned key processes.
6.3 Arctic Basin Pollution Problems
The Arctic region exploration strategy in a broad context of biospheric studies has
been discussed in details by Morgan (2008). A necessity of ecosystem’s approach to
studying land and marine biota has been particularly emphasized, as well as, con-
ditions of socio-economic development in high-latitude regions. Aibulatov (2000)
have discussed general problems of high-latitude environmental dynamics with
special emphasis on radioactive pollution as an echo of the cold war. Aibulatov
(2000) has analyzed principal sources of artiﬁcial radioisotopes in the Russian Arctic
seas such as: atomic explosions at Novaya Zemlya, the global radionuclide back-
ground as a result of the overall nuclear tests conducted on the planet, Russian
chemical and mining plants, Chernobyl accident, West-European radiochemical
plants, solid and liquid radioactive waste dumping in the Barents and Kara Seas, the
Northern Military Marine and its bases, atomic submarine construction and main-
tenance facilities and Atomﬂot (atomic ﬂeet) of the Murmansk Shipping Company.
Studying of the distribution of 137Cs, 90Sr and 239,240Pu in the water masses of
the Northern, Norwegian, Barents, Kara, White and Laptev Seas has resulted in the
following conclusions (Aibulatov 2000):
1. The general level of radioactive contamination of the waters of Arctic seas,
except for several local areas, is characterized at the present time by little
difference in comparison with background level (*6 Bq/kg).
2. The radioactive pollution of the waters of the Northern and Norwegian Seas is
entirely due to the emissions from radiochemical plants located in Western
Europe.
3. The contamination of waters of the Barents, White, Kara, and Laptev Seas is due
to both local (Russian) sources and West-European plants.
4. The ﬁeld observations in the Kara Sea in 1992–1995 have resulted in the
conclusion that there have been no substantial radioactive emissions from the
burial sites in the area.
5. The contribution of the Ob and Yenisei river runoff to the overall radioactive
transport is not signiﬁcant at the present time, except cases of extremely heavy
ﬂoods which happen very rarely.
6. Compared to open waters of the Arctic Ocean, shelf seas of the Russian Arctic
are more heavily contaminated.
6.2
Climate and Cryosphere
501

Aibulatov (2000) has pointed out that judging from the 137Cs-distribution pat-
terns in the Kara Sea, it becomes evident that the Yenisey and Ob rivers (less
evident, however, in the latter case) should be considered as transport channels for
inputs of technogenic radionuclides to the Arctic Ocean waters. There are radio-
active sources in the ocean as well. The 137Cs activity level reached its maximum in
1984 and was equal to 245 Bq/kg (in open sea); during the 1990s (1993) this level
was found to be equal to 100 Bq/kg (in the Yenisei estuary).
Arctic fjords have been classiﬁed into categories of comparatively clean, con-
taminated, heavily contaminated, and potentially contaminated. Contaminated areas
include, for instance, Kola Gulf and, probably, all the fjords of the northern Kola
Peninsula west of Murmansk. The content of radionuclides in phytobenthos, in the
coastal zone east of Murmansk, is low. Evidently, there has not been recently any
serious radionuclide penetration into this area. A rather low gamma-nuclide level
(1–3 Bq/kg) is typical for the zoobenthos of the Barents Sea. This is also true for the
Kara Sea.
An impact of all the sources of radioactivity in the zone of the Arctic coast on the
local population has not been assessed reliably enough. It was particularly difﬁcult
to separately identify natural and anthropogenic components of such an impact.
Aibulatov (2000) has discussed future research of the Russian Arctic radioactive
pollution, including:
• Development of a coordinated program Russian Arctic Sea Radioactivity Eco-
logical Monitoring.
• Assessments of impacts of different radioactive sources on the contamination of
the Arctic marine environment including water basins, land, and atmosphere.
• Studies of detailed space and time variability of various long-lived technogenic
radionuclides in bottom sediments.
• A detailed examination of all Novaya Zemlya fjords in connection with
dumping radioactive waste.
• Research of the impact of radioactive pollution on the Arctic marine ecosystem
dynamics.
• Studying medical aspects of environmental pollution in the Arctic.
The fundamental study of radioactivity of the Arctic and sub-Arctic marine
ecosystems have been undertaken by Matishov and Matishov (2001), which resulted
in the substantiation of a new branch of science—radiational ecological oceanology.
Investigations have been conducted of the level of artiﬁcial radionuclide concen-
tration in both environment and biota of the bays and inlets (the Kola, the Chernaya,
the West Litsa), where radioactively dangerous objects are located. In this context, a
classiﬁcation has been suggested for coastal areas (bays, gulfs, fjords) in accordance
with contamination levels for bottom sediments. The discovery of a bio ﬁlter of
pelagic and coastal zone during the processes of self-puriﬁcation of water reservoirs
and transport of radionuclides from water to bottom sediments, is of great impor-
tance. For the ﬁrst time the levels of 137Cs, 90Sr, 239,240Pu concentrations for different
types and populations of sea organisms were measured. Migrations of radioisotopes
along the trophic chains (from macrophytes and plankton to zoobenthos, ﬁsh, birds,
502
6
The Arctic Environmental Problems

seals, and whales) were studied, as well. The assessments of comparative contribu-
tions of global, regional, and local sources of radioactive environmental contami-
nation during the time-period from nuclear tests till recent time have been analyzed
and used as a source of information for environmental predictions. An important
optimistic conclusion concerning consequences of potential accidents is that for all
prescribed scenarios of radioactive emissions, it is highly improbable that large-scale
contamination of the Arctic Ocean will take place with ruinous impacts on marine bio
resources. High biological assimilation capacity in combination with speciﬁc fea-
tures of hydrodynamic and other processes is supposed to serve a barrier against
dangerous pollution of the Arctic Ocean.
Kalabin (2000) has accomplished a study of environmental dynamics and
industrial potential of the Murmansk region, the most urbanized and industrially
developed trans-polar region of the planet. Under these conditions, speciﬁc features
of environmental dynamics result in the enhancement of anthropogenic impacts. In
this context, Kalabin (2000) has analyzed critical environmental loads for some of
the northern ecosystems and emphasized a necessity to investigate their assimilation
(buffer) capacity, as a principal aspect of sustainable functioning natural systems.
The solution of regional problems of sustainable development requires a careful
analysis of the interaction between eco-dynamics and socio-economic development.
The progress achieved in studying the Arctic environment variability is due to
the accomplishment of a number of international research programs. The Arctic
Climate System Study (ACSYS) project developed in 1991, as well as the WCRP
initiative is of particular importance and practicable program for the next decade, to
assess the role of the Arctic in global climate. Five areas are emphasized:
(1) Ocean circulation;
(2) Sea ice climatology;
(3) The Arctic atmosphere;
(4) The hydrological cycle; and
(5) Modeling.
The scientiﬁc goal of ACSYS, which started its main observational phase on
January 1994 and will continue for a 10-year period, includes the three main objectives:
(1) understanding the interaction between the Arctic Ocean circulation, ice cover,
and the hydrological cycle;
(2) initiating long-term climate research and monitoring programs for the Arctic;
(3) providing a scientiﬁc basis for an accurate representation of Arctic processes
in global climate models.
The Arctic Ocean Circulation Program of ACSYS consists of the four components:
(1) the Arctic Ocean Hydrographic Survey to collect a high-quality hydrographic
data-base representative of the Arctic Ocean;
(2) the Arctic Ocean Shelf Studies which are aimed at understanding how the
shelf processes partitions salt- and fresh-water components; at deﬁning the
dynamics and thermodynamics of the shelf waters as well as other processes;
6.3
Arctic Basin Pollution Problems
503

(3) the Arctic Ocean Variability Project designed to assess the variability of the
circulation and density structure of the Arctic Ocean; and
(4) the Historical Arctic Ocean Climate Database Project aimed to establish a uni-
versally available digital hydrographic database for the Arctic Ocean for analysis
of climate-related processes and variability, and to provide a data set suitable for
initialization and veriﬁcation of arctic climate and circulation models.
The ACSYS sea ice program includes three main components:
(1) establishing an Arctic Basin-wide sea ice climatology database;
(2) monitoring the export of sea ice through the Fram Strait; and
(3) arctic sea ice processes studies.
One of the main tasks of the ACSYS arctic sea ice program is to establish a
climatology of ice thickness and ice velocity. Such data will be supplied by the
WCRP Arctic Ice Thickness Project, the International Arctic Buoy Program, sonar
proﬁling from naval submarines and unmanned vehicles, airborne oceanographic
lidars, and polar satellites carrying appropriate instruments.
The arctic atmosphere provides the dynamic and thermodynamic forcing of the
Arctic Ocean circulation and sea ice. Key directions of research include problems
such as: cloud-radiation interaction, air-sea interaction in the presence of ice cover
(impacts of polynyas and leads are of special interest), arctic haze, etc.
Primary ACSYS efforts within the project of the Hydrological Cycles in the
arctic region are aimed at:
(1) the documentation and inter-comparison of solid precipitation measurement
procedures used in high latitudes; and
(2) the development of methodologies for determining areal (regional) distribu-
tions of precipitation from station data.
There are two relevant data-archiving efforts: Arctic Precipitation Data Archive
(APDA) and Arctic Run-off Data Base (ARDB).
The principal purpose of the ACSYS modeling program is simulations of cli-
mate variations in polar regions which arise from the interaction between atmo-
sphere, sea ice and ocean.
Apart from the ACSYS project described above, a number of new research
programs have been developed, such as the Study of Environmental Arctic Change
(SEARCH), which is an interdisciplinary, multi-scale program dedicated to
understanding the complex interrelated changes that have been observed in the
Arctic environment in the past few decades (SEARCH 2001a, b). SEARCH is
envisioned as a long-term effort of observations, modeling, process studies, and
applications with emphasis on ﬁve major thematic areas:
• human society;
• marine/terrestrial biosphere;
• atmosphere and cryosphere;
• ocean, and
• integrated projects/models/assessment.

The Arctic Environmental Problems

The Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program is an interdisciplinary program
with the principal goals to
(1) understand the physical, geological, chemical, biological, and socio-cultural
processes of the arctic system that interact with the total Earth’s system and
thus contribute to or are inﬂuenced by global change, in order to
(2) advance the scientiﬁc basis for predicting environmental change on a seasonal-
to-centuries time scale, and for formulating policy options in response to the
anticipated impacts of global change on humans and societal support systems.
The following four scientiﬁc thrusts include central aims of ARCSS:
• to understand the global and regional impacts of the arctic climate system
and its variability;
• to determine the role of the Arctic in global biogeochemical cycling;
• to identify global change impacts on the structure and stability of arctic
ecosystems;
• to establish the links between environmental change and human activity.
ARCSS has four linked ongoing components: Ocean/Atmosphere/Ice Interac-
tions (OAII); Land/Atmosphere/Ice Interactions (LAII); Paleoenvironmental Stud-
ies (including GISP2, Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two), and Paleoclimates of
Arctic Lakes and Estuaries (PALE); Synthesis, Integration, and Modeling Studies
(SIMS), and Human Dimensions of the Arctic System (HARC).
Aagard (1998) discussed basic problems with a multidisciplinary look at the
Arctic Ocean, including: physical and chemical studies; biological studies; con-
taminant studies; measurements of the properties and variability of the ice cover and
of the surface radiation budget; studies of atmospheric chemistry; geological
observations.
LAII research has three main goals:
(1) to estimate important ﬂuxes in the region, including the amount of carbon
dioxide, and methane reaching the atmosphere, the amount of river water
reaching the Arctic Ocean, and the radiative ﬂux back to the atmosphere;
(2) to predict how possible changes in the arctic energy balance, temperature and
precipitation will lead to feedback affecting large areas; this incorporates
changes in water budget, duration of snow cover, extent of permafrost, and
soil warming, wetting, and drying; and
(3) to predict how the land and fresh-water biotic communities of the Arctic will
change, and how this change will affect future ecosystem structure and
function.
A major LAII research project is the Flux Study; its principal purpose is a
regional estimate of the present and future movement of materials between the land,
atmosphere, and ocean in the Kuparuk river basin in northern Alaska.
Of the nineteen LAII projects, three are part of the International Tundra
Experiment (ITEX), which looks at the response of plant communities to climate
change. Three others are concerned with atmosphere processes, including weather
6.3

pattern affecting snowmelt, Arctic-wide temperature trends, and water vapour over
the Arctic and its relationship to the atmospheric circulation and surface conditions.
One project deals with response of large birds to climate and sea-level change at
river deltas, and one studies the balance and recent volume changes of the McCall
Glacier in the Brooks Range.
Synthesis, integration and modeling studies are intended to foster linkages and
system-level understanding. Research on the past contemporary relationship to
humans to global climate change is thought to be critical to understanding the
consequences of global change in the Arctic.
There are a number of ARCSS data projects, including: LAII Flux Study Alaska
North Slope data sampler CD-ROM; OAII Northeast Water (NEW) polynya project
CD-ROM; Arctic solar and terrestrial radiation CD-ROM, etc.
A list of the OAII components includes the joint US/Japan cruise, the Western
Arctic Mooring project, and the Northeast Water Polynya project. Among other
OAII projects the most notable are the US/Canada Arctic Ocean Section and the
Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) project.
An outstanding effort has been accomplished in 1994 within the Canada/US
1994 Arctic Ocean Section, when the two icebreakers entered the ice in the northern
Chukchi Sea on 26 July 1994, reached the North Pole on 22 August, and left the ice
northwest of Spitsbergen on 30 August, completing thereby the ﬁrst crossing of the
Arctic Ocean by surface vessels. This voyage altered greatly our understanding of
biological productivity, the food web, ocean circulation and thermal structure, and
the role of clouds in the summer radiation balance, as well as the extent of con-
tamination and spreading pathways (especially related to radionuclides and chlo-
rinated organics), and the extent and effects of sediment transport by sea ice.
In connection with the SHEBA project, the U.S. Department of Energy’s
Atmosphere Radiation Measurement (ARM) program indicated its intention to
develop a Cloud and Radiation Testbed (CART) facility on the North Slope of
Alaska. The principal focus of this program will be on atmospheric radiative
transport, especially as modiﬁed by clouds (which impacts the growth and decay of
sea ice), as well as testing, validation, and comparison of radiation transfer models
in both the ice pack and arctic coastal environment.
A special place is occupied by the Russian-American Initiative on Shelf-Land
Environments in the Arctic (RAISE) with the principal goal of facilitating ship-
based research in the Russian Arctic (RAISE 2001). Earlier relevant land-based
research projects under the RAISE umbrella included studies of:
• organic material and nutrient ﬂuxes from Russian rivers;
• seasonal ﬂooding dynamics along rivers, and
• reconstruction of late Pleistocene glacial and sea-level history on Wrangel
Island.
New scientiﬁc topics in the near-shore waters of the Russian continental shelf
will include a broad range of studies: from the biogeochemical fate of organic
materials contributed to the Arctic Ocean by shoreline erosion and river runoff to
the social and biological impacts of changes in sea-ice distributions.

The Arctic Environmental Problems

The Western Arctic Shelf-Basin Interactions (SBI) project, sponsored by
ARCSS Program and the U.S. Ofﬁce of Naval Research, is investigating the Arctic
marine ecosystem, to improve our capacity to predict environmental change. The
SBI Phase II Field Implementation Plan (2002–2006) focuses on three research
topics in the core study area:
• northward ﬂuxes of water and bioactive elements through the Bering Strait input
region;
• seasonal and spatial variability in the prediction and recycling of biogenic matter
on the shelf-slope area; and
• temporal and spatial variability of exchanges across shelf-slope region into the
Canada Basin.
The meeting of the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) has identiﬁed
the following four science priorities:
(1) arctic processes relevant to global systems;
(2) effects of global change on the Arctic and its peoples;
(3) natural processes within the Arctic; and
(4) sustainable development in the Arctic.
The following areas in Arctic global change research have been considered the
most signiﬁcant:
(1) terrestrial ecosystem;
(2) mass balance of glaciers and ice sheets;
(3) regional cumulative impacts; and
(4) human dimensions.
An important aspect of studying high-latitude environmental dynamics is an
assessment of the impact of potential anthropogenic climate warming. In this
context Frederick (1994) has formulated key issues of integrated assessments of the
impact of climate change on natural resources. Speciﬁc project objectives include:
(1) characterizing the current state of natural science and socioeconomic modeling
of the impacts of climate change and current climate variability on forests,
grasslands, and water;
(2) identifying what can be done currently with impact assessments and how to
undertake such assessments;
(3) identifying impediments to linking biophysical and socioeconomic models
into integrated assessments for policy purposes; and
(4) recommending research activities that will improve the state of the art and
remove impediments to model integration.
The following questions are supposed to be answered:
• How will the overall system (physical-biological-economic) respond to various
imposed stresses?
• How do the uncertainties in the component models add up to give an overall
system response uncertainty?
6.3
Arctic Basin Pollution Problems
507

• Is society made more vulnerable to extreme natural events either by changing
those events or by reducing human ability to respond with corrective action?
• How likely is it that the consequences of climate change will be severe or
catastrophic?
• What is at risk and when is it a risk?
• What are the likely impacts on the landscape and the hydrological system?
• How might the boundary conditions and the overall productivity of the forests,
grasslands, and other rangelands be affected?
• How might increasing carbon dioxide levels affect crops and food supplies for
humans, livestock, and wildlife?
• What are the socio-economic consequences of these physical and biological
changes?
• What are the likely consequences for ecosystems of mitigation actions?
• Can the costs associated with climate change be reduced through natural
adaptation of ecosystems or policy-initiated adaptation?
Frederick (1994) has emphasized that the accumulated results of many regional
and local climate impact assessments may help provide informed answers to these
questions. Nevertheless, the uncertainties surrounding both the nature and the
impacts of any future climate change are likely to remain very large, precluding
precise estimates of the net beneﬁts associated with alternative policy responses.
Even if the range of uncertainty were diminished, it might still be difﬁcult to justify
speciﬁc measures on narrow economic grounds, because (as noted above) the
impacts on natural resource systems are apt to be poorly reﬂected in standard
beneﬁt-cost analysis.
Mendelsohn and Rosenberg (1994) have formulated the following questions
relevant to global warming effects in the area of ecological and water resources:
• Do changes in ecosystems provide important feedbacks to the natural carbon,
nitrogen, and methane cycles? For example, will the natural sinks or emitters be
affected by changing precipitation, temperature, and CO2 levels?
• What are the appropriate output measures of ecosystem component models?
What are the ecological effects of climate change that policy analysts use to
determinate the importance of an ecosystem change?
• What climate change-driven shifts in ecosystem boundaries can be predicted?
• Will these effects be subtle and small or large and dramatic and over what time
frame and spatial dimensions?
• Will climate change cause a change in the productivity of valuable market or
non-market species? For example, to what extent will some forests grow more
quickly or more slowly. Will desired non-market species, such as bear, elk, and
bald eagles, be more or less plentiful?
• What species could be lost with rapid climate changes? How do the vulnerable
species break down by type and geographic distribution? How should conser-
vation policies adapt to a world requiring change?
• How are the ecosystems likely to change as the climate evolves over time: will
there be a large increase in early succession species and where?
508
6
The Arctic Environmental Problems

• How will average ﬂows in rivers change with greenhouse warming? How will
these ﬂows change over seasons? Will the probabilities of catastrophic events
change?
• What values do people assign to the changes in ecosystems by climate change?
Which changes are important and which are minor? Can a value be assigned to
non-use?
• How much should society be willing to pay to reduce the probability of losing
speciﬁc species? If different scenarios favor different species, how should
society trade between these outcomes?
• What impact do ecosystem changes have upon the economy? For example, how
will climate change affect grazing, commercial ﬁshing, timber, or commercial
tourism?
It has been suggested that priority program areas and relevant projects are as
follows:
(a) Impacts of global changes on the arctic region and its people.
• Regional cumulative impacts.
• Effects of increased UV radiation.
(b) Arctic processes of relevance to global systems.
• Mass balance of glaciers and ice sheets.
• Terrestrial ecosystems and feedback on climate change.
(c) Natural processes within the Arctic.
• Arctic marine/coastal/riverine systems.
• Disturbance and recovery of terrestrial ecosystems.
(d) Sustainable development in the Arctic.
• Sustainable use of living resources
• Dynamics of arctic populations and ecosystems
• Environmental and social impacts of industrial development.
Future priorities of the ARCSS include the following research questions
(ARCUS 1998):
• How will the Arctic climate change over the next 50–100 years?
• How will human activities interact with future global change to affect the sus-
tainability of natural ecosystems and human societies?
• How will changes in arctic biogeochemical cycles and feedbacks affect arctic
and global systems?
• How will changes in arctic hydrological cycles and feedbacks affect arctic and
global systems? Are predicted changes in the Arctic detectable?
Important perspectives are connected with paleo-environmental studies by the
Paleo-environmental Arctic Sciences (PARCS) community (PARCS 2000) which
have a principal aim of answering the question: how much do recent observations
6.3

of climate change in the Arctic reﬂect natural climate cycles? Relevant major topics
include:
• the medieval warm period (apparently, AD 1000–1400) and Little Ice Age
(approximately AD 1400–1850);
• high-amplitude Holocene climate cycles, and
• the possible connection of the onset of neo-glacial (a mid-Holocene cooling,
particularly evident at high northern latitudes) with shifts in the frequency and
amplitude of such climate cycles.
According to the PARCS, there are very warm past scenarios that can serve as
analogues for future climate warming:
• the early Holocene, when the Arctic had experienced high summer insolation
anomalies, and
• the last interglacial period (marine isotope stage 5), which appears as a very
strong warming in the paleo-record approximately 125,000 years ago.
Key topics investigated in relation to these periods are:
• feedbacks and nonlinear changes (surprises) as consequences of strong warming—
particularly the role of sea ice, ice sheets, and land surface cover;
• implications of strong warming for arctic and global carbon budgets.
To summarize what has been mentioned in connection with recent Arctic
environmental programs, it must be emphasized that relevant information was not at
all exhaustive (IASC 2001). An obvious conclusion is that the number of programs
is too great. A clear necessity exists of better coordination of all on-going efforts
and their “regularization”.
Vörösmarty et al. (2001) are right in their conclusion that “understanding the full
dimension of arctic change is a fundamental challenge to the scientiﬁc community
over the coming decades and will require a major new effort at interdisciplinary
synthesis. It also requires an unprecedented degree of international cooperation”.
As it was noted earlier, the Arctic region plays a unique role in the global
environmental processes, forming numerous adverse correlations with the Earth’s
climatic system. Low temperatures, a high level of atmospheric circulation and the
availability of large ice-covered aquatories are notable for the high latitudes, quite
unlike the other areas of the globe.
The intensive industrial development of the northern territories has led to sig-
niﬁcant environmental change in these regions, especially in the Russian territories.
Oil and gas extraction on the Yamal and Taimir peninsulas in northwestern Siberia,
coal and gold extraction in Yakutia and Chukot as well as the mining industry on
the Kola Peninsula have led to a strong anthropogenic intervention into the natural
environment. Plant cover has been violated over great territories, the area and
productivity of reindeer pastures diminished and the hydrologic regime of rivers
disturbed. The greatest quantities of pollution substances are brought to the northern
coast of Russia by the rivers, violating the ecosystems of the northern seas.

The Arctic Environmental Problems

Further adverse inﬂuence on the Arctic ecosystems can lead to rising regional or
even global scale negative consequences. Thus the problem of the development of
the northern territories of Russia, the United States of America, Canada and the
Scandinavian countries needs to be solved by careful analysis of all types of eco-
system dynamics, by real time data collection and formation of national databases
and by deﬁning effective ways to coordinate development of the natural and
anthropogenic processes.
6.4 The Spatial Simulation Model of the Arctic Ecosystem
6.4.1 Simulation Model as a Tool for the Study of the Arctic
Ecosystem
Environmental investigations of the Arctic ecosystem encounter with many prob-
lems arising by reason of technical realization of monitoring systems. Therefore,
this restriction is overcome by the use of modeling technology (Shaver et al. 2013;
Luus et al. 2013; Krapivin and Varotsos 2008). Norwegian Polar Institute in
January 2013 organized scientiﬁc seminar “Arctic Ecosystem modeling: State of the
art, challenges, and a possible way forward” that given an overview of background
and current research in marine ecosystem modeling. Several models were realized
and used:
• Integrated Ecosystem Model (IEM) for Alaska and Northwest Canada. The IEM
is an effort to try and forecast landscape change within the Alaska and North-
west Canada region. The IEM brings together climate driven changes to dis-
turbance, vegetation succession, permafrost, and hydrology to illustrate how
arctic and boreal landscapes may be altered in the future.
• The Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM). The TEM includes four main mod-
ules: (1) the environmental module, (2) the dynamic soil layer module (DSL),
(3) the ecological module, and (4) the ﬁre disturbance module. The dynamic soil
layer module includes explicit simulation of soil carbon vertical distribution and
change of the thicknesses of organic layers based on the soil carbon content. The
thickness of the soil organic layer may change due to ecological processes or ﬁre
disturbance. Note that this module includes the explicit representation of per-
mafrost dynamics. The ecological module of TEM includes a dynamic vege-
tation model (TEM-DVM) with multiple vegetation pools, including the leaf,
wood and root pools.
• Single regression model predicts net ecosystem exchange (NEE) as a function of
leaf area index (LAI), air temperature and photosynthetically active radiation
(PAR). The model was developed in concert with a survey of the light response
of NEE in Arctic and subarctic tundras in Alaska, Greenland, Svalbard and
Sweden. Model parameterizations based on data collected in one part of the
Arctic can be used to predict NEE in other parts of the Arctic with accuracy
6.3
Arctic Basin Pollution Problems
511

similar to that of predictions based on data collected in the same site where NEE
is predicted. The principal requirement for the dataset is that it should contain a
sufﬁciently wide range of measurements of NEE at both high and low values of
LAI, air temperature and PAR, to properly constrain the estimates of model
parameters. Canopy N content can also be substituted for leaf area in predicting
NEE, with equal or greater accuracy, but substitution of soil temperature for air
temperature does not improve predictions.
Riseborough et al. (2008) provides a review of permafrost modelling advances,
primarily since the 2003 permafrost conference in Zürich, Switzerland, with an
emphasis on spatial permafrost models, in both arctic and high mountain envi-
ronments. Models are categorized according to temporal, thermal and spatial cri-
teria, and their approach to deﬁning the relationship between climate, site surface
conditions and permafrost status. The most signiﬁcant recent advances include the
expanding application of permafrost thermal models within spatial models, appli-
cation of transient numerical thermal models within spatial models and incorpo-
ration of permafrost directly within global circulation model (GCM) land surface
schemes. Future challenges for permafrost modeling will include establishing the
appropriate level of integration required for accurate simulation of permafrost-
climate interaction within GCMs, the integration of environmental changes such as
tree line migration into permafrost response to climate change projections, and
parameterizing the effects of sub-grid scale variability in surface processes and
properties on small-scale (large area) spatial models.
The purpose of this chapter is to develop and to investigate a simulation model
of the pollution dynamics in the Arctic Basin. There are many experimental and
theoretical results giving estimates of the growing dependencies between the pol-
lution dynamics in the World Ocean and the state of the continental environment.
The problem of the Arctic Basin pollution causes the most anxiety to investigators
(Krapivin and Phillips 2001b; Bobylev et al. 2003). It is known that the ecosystems
of the Arctic seas are vulnerable to a considerable extent in comparison with the
ecosystems of other seas. Processes that clean the Arctic Ocean are slower and
marine organisms of the Arctic ecosystem live in the polar climate, where the
vegetation period is restricted. Some feedback mechanisms operate with signiﬁcant
time delays and the capacity to neutralize the effects of human activity is feeble.
Apart from these reasons, the Arctic ecosystem has speciﬁc boundary conditions
connected with the sea-ice ergocline, which reduce its survivability level.
In connection with this circumstances, the Arctic Basin is the object for inves-
tigations in the frameworks of many national and international environmental
programs, such as the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program, U.S. Global
Change Research, the International Arctic System Science program (ARCSS),
(McCauley and Meier 1991; ARCSS 2003), the U.S. Arctic Nuclear Waste
Assessment Program (ANWAP) and the International Arctic Monitoring and
Assessment Program (AMAP). The research strategies of these programs include
the theoretical and experimental study of the tundra ecosystems, Siberian rivers and
near-shore and open arctic waters. The main problems arising here consist of
512

The Arctic Environmental Problems

determining a set of the principle matters that are necessary to study in the ﬁrst
place. These include the following:
(1) Transport modeling of pollutants in the arctic ecosystems. Based on the
experimental database, it is necessary to prepare a complete set of models and their
corresponding computer realizations for describing the processes of transfer and
transformation of pollution substances in the Arctic natural ecosystems. This set
includes the following models:
• a model of the transformation of organic pollution in the ecosystems of the fresh
water basins and streams;
• models of the self-cleaning processes for oil, radionuclides, heavy metals and
other pollutants;
• a model of radionuclide and heavy metal accumulation in the river ecosystems
of the Far North;
• a model of the transport of radionuclide, heavy metal and organic pollution with
river ﬂow into the near-coast Arctic waters;
• a model of pollution wash-out during the spring season in the tundra and forest-
tundra zones;
• a model of the kinetics and transformation mechanisms for the biosphere ele-
ments in the water systems;
• a kinetics model of radionuclides and heavy metals in the food chains of the land
ecosystems for boreal zones;
• a model of the surface ﬂow of chemical elements and compounds from terri-
tories in mining zones with open-cast mines under the climatic conditions of the
Far North; and
• a model of the seasonal inﬂuence of pollution on the phytoplankton and primary
production in the Northern seas.
(2) Modeling the exchange processes of carbon dioxide and methane between
the tundra ecosystems and the atmosphere. The global interaction of the Arctic
ecosystems with the biosphere and with the Earth’s climatic system is carried out
particularly through the inﬂuence upon the biogeochemical cycles of carbon
dioxide and methane. Existing models of the global circulation of these greenhouse
gases are incomplete, considering that they do not take into account this interaction.
Present estimations of the gas exchange between the Arctic ecosystem and the
atmosphere, conﬁrm however, the necessity of making such an account. To create a
model set related to the gas exchange in the Arctic reservoirs, it is necessary to
compile a catalog of soil-plant formations, ice ﬁelds, land-based and oceanic res-
ervoirs. It is necessary also to put in the database estimations of evapotranspiration,
dead vegetation decomposition rate and productivity of vegetation communities.
With the aid of this model set it will be possible to evaluate the role of the tundra
ecosystems in forming the greenhouse effect.
(3) Modeling the hydrological regime and estimation of the pollutant ﬂows in the
Arctic Basin. It is necessary to prepare a set of models to describe the dynamics of
the separate aquatories and the whole hydro-system of the Arctic ocean, including:
6.4
The Spatial Simulation Model …
513

• a complex model of the water circulation in the Arctic Basin;
• regional models of the water circulation in the Arctic seas;
• a model of the kinetics of radionuclides, heavy metals and organic pollutants in
the trophic structures of the Arctic marine ecosystems;
• a model of the spread of a pollutant concentration from a point-like source in the
near-coastal zone of the Arctic Basin;
• a model of the transfer of radionuclides, heavy metals and organic pollutants due
to vertical mixing of the Arctic waters;
• a model of the conservation and release processes due to freezing and thawing
of the ice cover.
(4) Modeling the Arctic ecosystems under conditions of anthropogenic impacts.
Anthropogenic inﬂuence in the Arctic Basin and on adjacent territories is connected
with local, regional and global activities. Therefore, it is necessary to work out the
following models:
• models for the inﬂuence of radionuclides, heavy metals and oil hydrocarbons
upon the dynamics of the marine ecosystems under Arctic climate conditions;
• models for the limiting of vegetation cover due to the different types of pollution
that are brought to the land ecosystems with precipitation and surface ﬂows;
• models for the dynamics of vegetation covers subjected to a physical inﬂuence;
• models/scenarios for the town and settlement structures under development;
• models/scenarios for the changes in area of the traditional seasonal regions of
activity of the nomadic population; and
• models/scenarios for the social development of the scattered peoples in the Far
North.
(5) Modeling the biogeochemical carbon cycle in the “Atmosphere/Arctic
Ocean” system. As has been shown by the experience of modeling the carbon
dioxide global cycle, the estimations of the role of the World Ocean in redundant
carbon absorption are rather rough (Nitu et al. 2004). For the models to be more
precise, they need to be reinforced by more reliable parameterizations of the
physical processes, related to the interaction between the bordering layers of the
and the Arctic aquatories. According to numerous laboratory and natural obser-
vations, the directivity of these processes depends considerably on many factors.
The most signiﬁcant of these are the speed of the driving wind, the presence of ice
cover and the vertical distribution proﬁle of the water temperature. A complex
composition of these factors determines the variety of possible models and their
details. One of the signiﬁcant problems is to explain the powerful ﬂow of seaweeds
during the spring season and hence to construct a parameterization system for the
dynamics of photosynthetic processes under conditions of snow and ice covers
along with their spring thawing.
(6) Development of a complex model for the functioning of the hydrologic and
biogeochemical systems in Arctic. In addition to the model set intended for local
and fragmentary processes in the Arctic ecosystems, as well as for understanding
their global role, it is necessary to synthesize a single model for the whole complex
514
6
The Arctic Environmental Problems

of biogeochemical, biogeocenotic and hydrologic processes that occur in the boreal
systems. Creation of such a model will ease the development of the database
requirements and will make it possible to obtain means for estimating the conse-
quences of anthropogenic projects. Using this model, the consequences can be
estimated for forest cutting and ﬁres, for the broadening of zones with disturbed
land cover, for land and basin pollution with oil, hydrogeological changes on the
separate territories due to submerging of landscapes, territorial pollution with waste
materials from the mining industry, etc.
(7) Stability estimation of the Arctic systems under variable global climate
conditions. Human activities in the delicate ecosystems of the Far North need to be
conducted with great care. But how is the natural balance to be safe from the rising
inﬂuence of human civilization with its industrial machines?—how can the survival
of these ecosystems be evaluated in different situations?—these and other questions
need to be answered as the program outlined above is realized.
An understanding of the environmental processes in the Arctic regions, a pre-
requisite for ﬁnding scientiﬁc solutions to the problems arising there, can be found
only by combining many disciplines, including ecology, oceanography, mathe-
matical modeling, and system analysis. This chapter synthesizes many data sources
and knowledge from various scientiﬁc ﬁelds in the form of a Spatial Simulation
Model of the Arctic Ecosystem (SSMAE). Separate blocks of the SSMAE were
created earlier by many authors (Riedlinger and Preller 1991; Muller and Peter
1992; Legendre and Krapivin 1992; Krapivin 1995). The sequence of these blocks
in the SSMAE structure and the adaptation of it to the Spatial Global Model (SGM)
provide a technology for computer experiments (Krapivin 1993).
The goal of the NSF ARCSS Program is to answer the question: What do
changes in the arctic system imply for the future? To address this question,
researchers must:
• Advance from a component understanding to a system understanding of the
Arctic.
• Understand the behavior of the arctic system—past, present and future.
• Understand the role of the Arctic as a component of the global system.
• Include society as an integral part of the arctic system.
AMAP is an international organization established in 1991 to implement com-
ponents of the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy (AEPS). Now a program
group of the Arctic Council, AMAP’s current objective is “providing reliable and
sufﬁcient information on the status and threats of the Arctic environment, and
providing scientiﬁc advice on actions to be taken in order to support Arctic gov-
ernments in their efforts to take remedial and preventive actions relating to con-
taminants” (http://www.amap.no; AMAP 2009).
The present chapter describes a simulation system based on sets of computer
algorithms for processing data from monitoring of the Arctic regions and for
applying mathematical models of natural and anthropogenic processes.
The basic blocks of the SSMAE are oriented on the description of the dynamics
of any given pollutant. For consideration of a speciﬁc pollutant it is necessary to
6.4
The Spatial Simulation Model …
515

include in the SSMAE an additional block with the description of its physical and
chemical characteristics. This procedure is demonstrated by examples of blocks that
simulate the characteristics of radionuclides, heavy metals and oil hydrocarbons.
The consideration of these pollutants is restricted to elements with averaged
properties.
The Arctic Basin aquatory (Ω) which is studied in this chapter has boundaries
which include the peripheral Arctic seas as well as the coast line and southern
boundaries of the Norwegian and Bering Seas.
6.4.2 Structure of the Simulation Model
A conceptual diagram and the block contents of the SSMAE are shown in Fig. 6.3
and Table 6.4. The functioning of the SSMAE is supported by the SGM and by the
climate model (CM). The SSMAE inputs are the data about the pollutant sources of
the near-shore Arctic Basin, the ice areas and the current maps. The SSMAE
contains three types of blocks: mathematical models of the natural ecological and
hydrophysical processes, service software and the scenarios generator. The marine
biota block (MBB) describes the dynamics of the energy ﬂows in the trophical
chains of the Arctic Basin ecosystem. The hydrological block (HB) describes the
spatial discretization of Ω on the water circulation in the Arctic. The pollution
simulation model (PSM) contains the anthropogenic scenarios and the service
control block (SCB) provides the control of the simulation experiment.
The Arctic ecosystem has a unique, complex food web that is fashioned by its
distinctive plankton, animal species, and environmental factors. Carbon also cycles
through the web from atmosphere to seawater and back. Phytoplankton and algae
take up carbon dioxide from seawater and transform it into the organic carbon of
their tissue. Then it ﬂows through successive levels of eating animals that convert

their prey’s carbon into their own tissues or into sinking fecal pellets. Along the
way, some carbon dioxide escapes back to the atmosphere through the organisms’
respiration. General representation of the Arctic ecosystem is shown in Figs. 6.4
and 6.5.
Let us designate the Arctic Basin aquatory as Ω = {(φ, λ)}, where φ and λ are
latitude and longitude, respectively. Spatial inhomogeneity of the Arctic Basin
model is provided for by the set of cells DTCO2 with latitude and longitude steps of
Δφ and Δλ, respectively. These cells are the basic spatial structure of Ω for the
realization of the computer algorithms. The cells Ωij are heterogeneous as to their
parameters and functioning. There are a set of cells which are adjacent to the river
mouths (ΩR) and to the ports (ΩP), bordering on the land XC

(φi, λj) belongs to a given sea.
Identiﬁer A2 shows the position of the cells ΩR, ΩP, ΩN, ΩS, ΩΓ and describes
the spatial distribution of the pollutant sources. Other identiﬁers Ak are used to
describe ice ﬁelds (k = 3), the spatial distribution of solar radiation (k = 4) and the
dislocation of upwelling zones (k = 5).
The user of the SSMAE in free-running mode may choose different ways to
describe the many input parameters. Blocks ICI and ICD realize the on-line entry to
Ak and to the database. For example, if the user has data about the spatial distri-
bution of ice ﬁelds in Ω, he can form identiﬁer A3 with a3
ij ¼ 0 for an ice-free water
surface, a3
ij ¼ 1 for new ice and a3
ij ¼ 2 for old ice. In this case block SS enables the
input of data from the climate model concerning the ice ﬁelds.
The block structure of the SSMAE is provided for with a C++ program. Each of
the blocks from Table 6.4 is a C++ function. The main function provides the
interactions between the SSMAE, SGM and CM. This functional speciﬁcation
supports overlapping output and input streams of the SSMAE blocks. With the
conversational mode the user can toggle the data streams between the slave blocks.

The calculating procedure is based on the subdivision of the Arctic Basin into
boxes {Ξijk}. This is realized by means of a quasi-linearization method (Nitu et al.
2000a). All differential equations of the SSMAE are substituted for in each box Ξijk
by easily integrable ordinary differential equations with constant coefﬁcients. The
water motion and turbulent mixing are realized in conformity with current velocity
ﬁelds which are deﬁned on the same coordinate grid as the {Ξijk} (Krapivin et al.
1998a).
6.4.3 Description of Ecological Processes
The ice-water ergocline plays an important role in the biological productivity of the
north seas. According to the hypothesis of Legendre and Legendre (1998), energetic
ergoclines are the preferential sites for biological production in the Arctic Ocean.
The primary production in the food chains of the Arctic Basin ecosystems is
determined by the phytoplankton productivity. This is connected with complex
variations in the meteorological, hydrodynamic, geochemical and energetic
parameters of the sea environment. The problem of parameterization of the phy-
toplankton production in the north seas was studied by Legendre and Legendre
(1998). Table 6.6 gives the structure for the seasonal composition of conditions
affecting the primary production in Ω. This scheme is applied for each of the Ξijk.
The block MWT calculates the water temperature Tw by means of the averaging
of temperatures for the mixed water volumes. In addition the following correlations
are applied:

The concentration of nutrients B6,A (t, φ, λ, z) at the depth z is determined by
photosynthesis RpA, advection and destruction of suspended dead organic matter B7.
The role of the hydrodynamic conditions manifests itself in maintenance of the
concentration of nutrients required for photosynthesis which occurs via transport
from other layers or aquatories of the sea where the concentration is sufﬁciently
high. Taking into account the designations of Table 6.5 we have:

where the values of αA (A = g, r, f, w) depend on the optical properties of the Ath
medium. The irradiance E0 arrives at the surface Ω. The estimate of E0 is obtained
from monitoring or is calculated from the climatic model. The ﬂow of E0 is
attenuated by snow, ice and water according to the scheme of Table 6.5. In each cell
Ωij the structure of these layers is changed corresponding to the time of year. Within
each layer, the attenuation of the irradiance with depth is described by an expo-
nential model. The parameters αA and βA are functions of the salinity, turbidity,
temperature, and biomass. The form of this dependence is given as a scenario or
else the standard functions are used (block IM).
Block-diagram of Fig. 6.6 is realized as block MEF. The boxes with elements
denote the generalized trophic levels of the arctic ecosystem. All of the elements are
described by means of averaged parameters for the biological community of the
north seas. It is supposed that this trophic pyramid takes place in each of the Arctic
Basin seas. The trophic relations between the elements of the model are described
on the basis of the energetic principle (Nitu et al. 2000b). Biomasses, the rates of
production and exchange (respiration), and food rations are expressed in energy
units. Total nitrogen serves as a “nutrient salts” prototype in the model.
As a basic scheme for the ﬂow of nutrients in the water, the scheme proposed by
Krapivin (1996) is accepted as corrected for the conditions of the Arctic Basin by
Legendre and Legendre (1998). It is supposed that the spatial distribution of
upwelling zones is given with seasonal variations. Block NM realizes this scheme
in reference to the current structure of the upwelling regions.

As a basic scheme for the ﬂow of nutrients in the water, the scheme proposed by
Krapivin (1996) is accepted as corrected for the conditions of the Arctic Basin by
Legendre and Legendre (1998). It is supposed that the spatial distribution of
upwelling zones is given with seasonal variations. Block NUM realizes this scheme
in reference to the current structure of the upwelling regions.
The irradiance E0 arrives at the surface of Ω. The estimate of E0 is obtained from
monitoring or is calculated from the climatic model. The ﬂow of E0 is attenuated by
snow, ice and water according to the scheme of Table 6.4. In each cell Xij the
structure of these layers is changed corresponding to the time of year. Within each
layer, the attenuation of the irradiance with the depth is described by an exponential
model (Legendre and Krapivin 1992). The parameters aA and βA are functions of
the salinity, turbidity, temperature, and biomass. The form of this dependence is
given as a scenario or else the standard functions are used (block IM).
The phytoplankton production RpA in the environment A is a function of the solar
radiation EA, the concentration of nutrients nA, the temperature TA, the phyto-
plankton biomass pA, and the concentration of pollutants nA. There are many
models for the description of the photosynthesis process (Legendre and Legendre
1998; Legendre and Krapivin 1992). For the description of this function in the
present study, the equation of the Michaelis-Menten type is used (block MFB):

critical environmental conditions when the concentration of nutrients and the
temperature have high ﬂuctuations. The coefﬁcients of these relationships are

6.4.4 Description of the Hydrologic Cycle
The circulation of the waters in the Arctic Basin is a complex system of cycles and
currents with different scales. Block HB simulates the dynamics of the Arctic Basin
waters by a system of sub-blocks presented in Fig. 6.3. The water dynamics in Ω is
presented by ﬂows between the compartments Ξijk. The directions of water
exchanges are represented on every level zk ¼ z0 þ k  1
ð
ÞDzk according to Aota
et al. (1992) in conformity with the current maps assigned as the SSMAE input. The
external boundary of Ω is determined by the coast line, the bottom, the Bering strait,
the south boundary of the Norwegian Sea, and the water-atmosphere boundary.
The hydrological data are synthesized via a four-level structure according to the
seasons (block MWD). The velocity of current in the Bering Strait is estimated by
the following binary function:
VðtÞ ¼
V1 for t 2 su [ sa
V2 for t 2 sw [ ss

The water exchange through the south boundary of the Norwegian Sea is V3.

(cal g−1 grad−1); σijk is the volume of Ξijk; Wijk
slm is the heat inﬂow to Ξijk from Ξslm;
f ijk
slm is the heat exchange between Ξslm and Ξijk caused by turbulent mixing; and Wijk
is the total heat outﬂow from Ξijk to the bordering boxes. Heat exchange with the
atmosphere is calculated in accordance with empirical Eq. (6.1).
It is considered that the dissipation of moving kinetic energy, geothermic ﬂow
on the ocean bed, heat effects of chemical processes in the ocean ecosystem, and
freezing and melting of the ice are not global determinants of the water temperature
ﬁelds. The SSMAE does not consider these effects.
The dynamics of the water salinity S(t, φ, λ, z) during the time interval t are described
by the balance equation as block MWSD. The ice salinity is deﬁned by a two-step scale:
s1—old, s2—new. It is supposed that Sðt; u; k; zÞ ¼ s0
for
z [ 100 m, s2 ¼
ksSðt; u; k; f Þ for r þ f [ Hmax and s1 ¼ krs2Hmax=ðr þ f Þ for r þ f \Hmax where
coefﬁcients ks and kr are determined empirically and Hmax is the maximal thickness of
new ice. In accordance with the estimations by Krapivin (1995), the simulation
experiments are realized for Hmax = 50 cm, ks = kr = 1. The river ﬂows, ice ﬁelds and
synoptic situations are described by scenarios given in the MRF and SS blocks and
formed by the user of the SSMAE.
The snow-layer thickness g(t, φ, λ) may be described via statistical data with
given dispersion characteristics: g ¼ g þ g0 where the value g is deﬁned as the
mean characteristic for the chosen time interval and the function g0 t; u; k
ð
Þ gives
the variation of g for the given time interval.
An alternative description is the parameterization of the snow-layer dynamics
process in the framework of the atmospheric process simulation algorithm (block
APTM) relating the thickness of the growth and melting of the snow-layer to the
temperature and precipitation:
g t þ Dt; u; k
ð
Þ ¼ g t; u; k
ð
Þ þ SF  SM;
where SF is the part of the snow precipitated at temperatures close to freezing
(265 K ≤T0 ≤275 K) and SM is the snow ablation (i.e. evaporation + melting).
Block SS gives to the user the possibility to select between these algorithms.
When statistical data on the snow-layer thickness exists, the function g(t, φ, λ) is
reconstructed for (φ, λ) ∈Ω by means of the approximation algorithm at the time
and polynomial interpolation in the space (Krapivin 2000c, d; Nitu et al. 2000b).

6.4.5 Simulation of Dispersion Processes for the Water
Pollutants
The block PSM simulates the pollution processes over the territory Ω as a result of
the atmosphere transport, river and surface coastal outﬂow, navigation, and other
human activity. The variety of pollutants is described by three components: oil
hydrocarbons O, heavy metals (e—solid particles, w—dissolved fraction) and ra-
dionuclides ε. It is supposed the pollutants get into the living organisms only
through the food chains.
The rivers bring a considerable contribution to the level of pollution of the arctic
waters. The concentration of pollutant κ in the river γ is cj. The pollutant κ enters
compartment Ωijk ∈ΩR with the velocity cc reﬂecting the mass ﬂow per unit time.
Subsequently, the spreading of the pollutant in Ω is described by other sub-blocks.
The inﬂuence of water exchanges between the Arctic Basin and the Paciﬁc and
Atlantic Oceans on the pollution level in Ω is described by block MPT. It is
supposed that the watersheds of the Norwegian Sea XN and the Bering Strait XB are
characterized by currents with varying directions given as a scenario.
The atmospheric transport of heavy metals, oil hydrocarbons and radionuclides
is described by many models (Phillips et al. 1997; Payne et al. 1991; Sportisse
2000). The application of these models to the reconstruction of the pollution dis-
tribution over Ω makes it possible to estimate optimal values of Δφ, Δλ and the step
in time Δt. The present level of the database for the Arctic Basin provides for use of
a one-level Euler model with Δt = 10 days, Δφ = Δλ = 1° (block APTM). It is
supposed that pollution sources can be located on the Arctic basin boundary. Their
detailed distributions are given as the SSMAE input. The transport of pollutants to
the Arctic Basin and the formation of their spatial distribution are realized in
conformity with the wind velocity ﬁeld, which is considered as given (Krapivin and
Phillips 2001b).
It is postulated that the oil hydrocarbons O(t, φ, λ, z) are transformed by the
following processes (Payne et al. 1991): dissolving H1
O, evaporation H2
O, sedi-
mentation H3
O, oxidation H4
O, biological adsorption H5
O, bio-sedimentation H6

The process of the diffusion of the heavy metals in the seawater depends on their
state. The dissolved fraction of the heavy metals (ψ) takes part in the biogeo-
chemical processes more intensively than the suspended particles (e). But as sus-
pended particles, the heavy metals fall out more rapidly to the sediment. A
description of the entire spectrum of these processes in the framework of this study

6.4.6 Simulation Results
6.4.6.1 The Assumptions
The SSMAE allows for the estimation of the pollution dynamics of the Arctic Basin
under various a priori suppositions about the intensities of the ﬂows of pollutants
and under other anthropogenic impacts on the ecosystems of this region. Here,
some of the possible situations are considered. The thermal regime of the Arctic
Basin is given by a normal distribution with average temperatures and with dis-
persions on the aquatories as given by the SEDAAR (Strategic Environmental
Distributed Active Archive Resource). The scheme of transport of pollutants in the
atmosphere is adopted from Christensen (1997). The estimates of parameters for the
blocks of Table 6.7 are given by literature sources or personal recommendations.
The vertical distribution of pollutants in the initial moment t0 is taken as
homogeneous. The average diameters of the solid particles are estimated to be in the
range from 0.12 to 1,000 μm and the vertical velocity of sedimentation is 0.003 m/s.
The concentration of nutrients in the ice and snow equals 0. Also it is supposed that
the deep water temperature is deﬁned as Υ(t, φ, λ) = 0 °C and the surface ice
temperature as f1(t, φ, λ) = −3 °C for (φ, λ) ∈Ω. It is supposed that eA
1 ¼ 0 and the
phytoplankton productivity in the ice layer is 2.5 % of the primary production in the
water column [(Rp,r + Rpf)/Rp,w = 0.025].
Let the ratio between solid and dissolved phases of heavy metals at the moment
t = t0 equal 1:2, i.e. e(t0, φ, λ, z)/ψ(t0, φ, λ, z) = 0.5. The ﬂows of heavy metals,

= 0. The
boundaries of the Norwegian and Bering Seas are approximated by lines with
φN = 62°N and φB = 51°N, respectively. Values for the other parameters are deﬁned
by Wielgolaski (1997), Wania et al. (1998), Valette-Silver (1999), Preller and
Cheng (1999), Bard (1999) and Rudels et al. (1991). The initial data are deﬁned in
Tables 6.5 and 6.8.
6.4.6.2 The Dynamics of Arctic Basin Radio Nuclear Pollution
The intensity of external ﬂows through the boundaries of the Arctic Basin and the
internal ﬂows due to dead organisms He
D, sediment He
 and living organisms He
a are
described by linear models in accordance with Krapivin and Phillips (2001b). Some
results of the simulation experiment are given in Figs. 6.8, 6.9 and 6.10. Figure 6.8

shows the tendency versus time of the average content of the radio nuclear pollution
on the whole Arctic water area. The distribution with depth is represented by a three
layer model, upper waters (z < 1 km), deep waters (z > 1 km) and sediments. The
bottom depth is taken as 1.5 km. A more realistic depth representation of the
shallow seas and the deeper Arctic Basin will be considered in a future reﬁnement
of the model. The curves describe the vertical distribution with time of the radio-
nuclide content in the two water layers and in the sediments. The transfer of
radionuclides from the upper waters to the deep waters occurs with a speed which
results in the reduction of radio nuclear pollution in the upper waters by 43.3 %
over 20 years. These distributions for each of arctic seas are given in Table 6.9.

Local variations in the vertical distribution of radionuclides are determined by
both hydrological and ecological conditions. The correlation between these con-
ditions is a function of the season. Table 6.10 gives the estimates of the role of the
ecological processes in the formation of the vertical distribution of the radio nuclear
pollution of the arctic seas. These estimates show that the biological community
plays a minor role in the radionuclide transport from the upper layers to the deep
ocean.

The Arctic Environmental Problems

The aquatories of the White, Laptev, East-Siberian, and Chukchi Seas are
subject to visible variations in the radio nuclear pollution. An accumulation of
radionuclides is observed in the Central aquatory of the Arctic Basin. The aqua-
geosystems of the Greenland and Kara Seas have some conservative character,
leading to buildup of radio nuclear pollution, but in the Norwegian Sea there is even
a decrease in the pollution level.
A somewhat stable situation is observed in the vertical distribution of the ra-
dionuclides. It is generally achieved during 5–7 years following the initial moment
t0 with the exception of the East-Siberian, Laptev and Kara Seas where the

stabilization processes of the vertical distribution are delayed by 10–12 years
compared to the other water areas of the Arctic Basin.
The results of the simulation experiments show that variations of the initial data
by ±100 %, change the stabilization time by no more than 30 %, so that the
distributions take shape in 4–8 years. One unstable parameter is the river ﬂow into
the Arctic Basin. Figure 6.9 shows the variations in the simulation results under a
change in the river ﬂow to the Arctic Basin. The radio nuclear pollution is reduced
by 80 % when the river ﬂow decreases by 50 %. While the river ﬂow increases by
50 %, the radio nuclear pollution of the Arctic Basin increases by only 58 %.
Hence, a ±50 % error in the river ﬂow estimate can cause a <100 % deviation of the
simulation results for radio nuclear pollutants. As follows from the other curves of
Fig. 6.6, such deviations are still less for heavy metals and oil hydrocarbons.
The SSMAE allows for the estimation of a wide spectrum of radio nuclear
pollution parameters. Thus, this study shows a dependence of the biological
transformation mechanism on the initial prerequisites. The biological transport of
radionuclides downward out of the mixed layer, varies in a wide interval from
months to scores of years. The vertical transport by biological elements is divided
between 11 % for migration by living organisms and 89 % for transport by dead
organisms. There is a stable result in that the lower trophic levels of the arctic
ecosystem have a greater concentration of radionuclides than the higher trophic
levels. But it is evident that for a higher precision of block MPPR the model of the
biological processes must consider separately each radioactive element and its
interaction with the plankton. The variant of MPPR realized here considers the
physical processes as the major forces.
6.4.6.3 The Dynamics of Arctic Basin Pollution by Heavy Metals
The results of the simulation experiment are given in Table 6.11. We see that the
stabilization of the average content of heavy metals on the full water area of the Arctic
Basin is achieved in 3–5 years. Under this stable regime, the concentration of heavy
metals in the compartments XR [ XP (river mouths and ports) is six times higher than
in the Central aquatory and two times higher than in Xc [ XB [ XN (the near-shore
waters, the Bering Strait and the south boundary of the Norwegian Sea). The con-
centration of heavy metals in the phytoplankton is 18 % lower than in the zooplankton
and 29 % lower than in the nekton. There is observed a process of accumulation of
heavy metals in the upper trophic levels; moreover the relation of the concentration of
heavy metals in the phytoplankton to their concentration in the other trophic levels
varies from 0.3 in XR [ XP to 0.5 in the open part of the Arctic Basin.
The spatial features of the distribution of heavy metals in the sea water is char-
acterized by more rapid accumulation into the water areas adjoining the west coastline
of Novaya Zemlya and situated at the boundary between the Jan-Mayen and East-
Iceland currents. The central water area of the Arctic Basin has a quasi-uniform
distribution of heavy metals concentration. The vertical gradients of heavy metals
vary in the interval from 0.11 to 1.54 mg m−2 day−1. The forms of the vertical

The SSMAE provides the possibility of estimating the characteristics for separate
types of heavy metals. An example of such calculations is given in Table 6.12.

estimated by McIntyre (1999) is transformed to other forms by 56 % in the envi-
ronments of the surface snow, ﬂoating ice and submerged ice and by 72 % in the
water. The stabilization of the distribution of the oil hydrocarbons is realized in
3 years after t0.
The average level of oil pollution in the Arctic Basin reaches the value of
0.005 mg/l. This is lower than the natural level of World Ocean pollution. In the
inﬂuence zone of the Gulf-stream current and in the Paciﬁc waters an insigniﬁcant
excess of this level is observed. The Barents and Kara Seas are the most polluted.
Here the concentration of oil hydrocarbons reaches the value 0.03 mg/l. An average
summary content of oil hydrocarbons in the Arctic Basin is 65,331 t (metric tons)

(solid curve 1) and the data of curves 2 and 3 (Terziev 1992) is explained by the
assumption that the trophic structures of the different Arctic Seas are described by
means of the general scheme represented in Fig. 6.3 and the discrimination between
the ecological elements in each of the Arctic Seas is not taken into consideration in
the SSMAE.
Figure 6.10 indicates that the vegetative period for the phytoplankton in the
Barents Sea equals 4.9 months as shown by the effects on the ecosystem contri-
bution to the self-clearing of the oil hydrocarbons (dashed curve.) In the case
considered, the Barents Sea ecosystem neutralizes about 25 % of oil hydrocarbons
during the vegetative period. The rest of the time, this value oscillates near 3 %. The
dispersion of these estimates with latitude reaches 53 %. For example, in the
northern part of the Barents Sea the vegetative period varies from 2.6 to 3.1 months,
while in the southern latitudes the variation is 5.3–5.8 months. Consequently, the
ecosystem role in the sea cleaning of the oil hydrocarbons is 8 and 36 % for the
northern and southern water areas, respectively. Such estimates can be calculated
for each cell Δφ × Δλ × Δz of the Arctic Basin.
6.4.6.5 The Dynamics of Pollutants in the Arctic Basin
An important problem is that of determining and understanding the role of the
various pollutant sources in forming the pollution levels for the different Arctic
Basin areas: McCauley and Meier (1991). One major function of the SSMAE is to
estimate the pollution dynamics in each of the cells Ωij ⊆Ω as a function of time.
The inﬂuence of the pollutant sources on the Arctic ecosystem occurs through the
boundary area XR [ XP [ XB [ XN [ XC and through the atmosphere. The total
picture of the spatial distribution of pollutants is formed from the local dynamic
processes. The incompleteness of the Arctic database leads to the need for
assumption to be made for some scenarios in the framework: Krapivin et al. (1998a)
estimated the ﬂow of pollutants to the Kara Sea based on the experimental mea-
surements of radionuclear pollution and heavy metals in the Angara-Yenisey river
system. Therefore, the SSMAE is used to estimate the ﬂow of pollutants from the
Kara Sea to the other water areas of the Arctic Basin.
The Ob and Yenisey rivers are considered to be the main sources of radio
nuclear pollution, heavy metals and oil hydrocarbons for the Kara Sea (Table 6.10).
Figure 6.9 shows the inﬂuence of the river ﬂow on the volume of pollutants
transported by the Kara Sea aquageosystem to the Central Basin. As shown by
curves 1 and 2, the transference of heavy metals and radionuclides from the Ob and
Yenisey rivers through the Kara Sea aquageosystem to the Central water areas of
the Arctic Basin amounts to 2.1 % when the river ﬂow varies from 500 to
1,000 km3/year and after that it begins to grow linearly up to 7.6 % for 2,000 km3/
year. Hence, there is a critical level of pollution for the Kara Sea ecosystem beyond
which it does not have time to dilute the ﬂow of heavy metals and radio nuclear
pollutants. Similar estimations can be obtained for the other elements of set ΩR,
using the rivers referred to in Table 6.8.
6.4
The Spatial Simulation Model …
537

The SSMAE allows for the estimation of the ﬂow of pollutants between the
different water areas of the Arctic Basin. For example, the transport of heavy metals
and oil hydrocarbons from the Barents Sea to the Kara Sea is 631 and
473 kg year−1, respectively. The total ﬂow of pollutants from the Russian coast line
to Alaska varies in the framework of Table 6.8 between 0.3 and 0.9 % of the initial
ﬂow. As is evident from curves 3 and 4 of Fig. 6.11, the ﬂow of the Ob and Yenisey
rivers have practically no inﬂuence on the pollution level of the arctic waters near
Alaska. This effect does not change over time.
6.4.7 Summary and Conclusions
We will discuss here three aspects of the SSMAE which are very important. The
ﬁrst concerns the incorporation of ecological, hydrophysical, climatic and bio-
geochemical relationships in a model simulating the dynamics of the Arctic Basin
pollution. The main problem here is how to parameterize these relationships to
achieve the satisfactory precision. The second, concerns the key problem of data-
base conformity to the model. In this case, the task is in the adaptation of the
spatial-time scale to the database. The third, concerns the user’s ability to run the
SSMAE in the scenarios space.

The Arctic Environmental Problems

This investigation shows that the simulation experiment provides the possibility
of studying both the common and spatial distributions of the pollutant dynamics in
the Arctic Basin. The precision of the results is a function both of the scenarios and
the forms of the parameterization of the elements in Eqs. (6.1)–(6.16). It is obvious
that the SSMAE is not effective when the climate conditions are varied to a critical
state or when the anthropogenic impacts are increased to a critical value. But in the
SSMAE the Arctic Basin acts as a stabilizing subsystem of the biosphere. When the
atmospheric temperature is reduced by −1 °C, there occurs an inverse connection in
the water balance of the atmosphere-land-sea system, which acts to stabilize the
estimates. The parameterization of such variations in the framework of the SSMAE
is not convenient. Nevertheless, the connection of the SSMAE to a global database
having estimates of such parameters as ice area, temperature and albedo distribu-
tions, will allow the use of the SSMAE in the present form. The effectiveness of the
SSMAE will increase with the use of models such as the coupled ice-ocean model
described in the paper of Riedlinger and Preller (1991). In general, many different
modiﬁcations of the SSMAE are possible. But, it is obvious that movement to the
optimal SSMAE structure demands greater accuracy of pollutant types, ecosystem
structure, water cycle, ice movement and climate model. The main difﬁculty is to
realize the optimal modiﬁcation at the same time for each of the blocks of the
SSMAE.
The pollution level of the Arctic Basin is formed mainly by the river ﬂows.
Because of this, the block MRFAB plays a very important role in the SSMAE.
Regular monitoring of the water ﬂows and pollutant inputs by the rivers to the
SSMAE is impossible. Consequently, the study and measurement of these ﬂows
during scientiﬁc expeditions and the modeling of the results are signiﬁcant steps in
the investigation of the Arctic Basin pollution.
One example of such a step is the U.S./Russian expedition of 1995 to obtain on-
site measurements of the pollution levels in the Yenisey and its tributary the
Angara, in order to investigate the likely origins of land-based sources contributing
to the pollution levels in the Yenisey estuary.
The problem of veriﬁcation of the SSMAE is important. However, it will be
possible to realize this after essential modiﬁcations to the SSMAE, using models of
greater precision to account for the hydrological, biogeochemical, ecological and
climatic processes. The present SSMAE structure leads to a new technology of
Arctic Basin pollution monitoring. Greater, or at least better, accuracy in the
SSMAE may be realized by means of simulation experiments where the model
parameters are varied over wide intervals. That is beyond the scope of this chapter.
We draw attention to several results of this investigation. In the framework of the
nuclear war scenario, for example, the SSMAE shows that the Arctic environmental
stability is disturbed 3 months after the impact. From other scenarios, it follows that
variations in the velocity of vertical advection from 0.004 to 0.05 cm/s does not
affect the Arctic environmental state. An error by 32 % in the ice area estimate leads
to a variation of the simulation results by 36 %. When this error is more than 32 %,
the simulation results become less stable and can vary by several times. The
problem lies in ﬁnding the proper criterion to estimate the SSMAE sensitivity to
6.4

variations in model parameters. As is shown by Krapivin (1996), a survivability
function J(t) reﬂecting the dynamics of the total biomass of living elements enables
one to estimate this sensitivity. In this instance

The index J(t) provides an estimation of the uncertainty associated with the
SSMAE parameters. Although a complete investigation of the inﬂuence of the
SSMAE parameter variations on model results is an independent task, various esti-
mations are given here. Preliminary simulation results show that the SSMAE permits
variations of the initial data in the interval −70 to 150 %. In this case the model
“forgets” these variations during ≈40 days. Also a large uncertainty (±50 %) is
permitted in the value of such parameters as μA, δn, Vi, Tc, Topt, ρ1, kij. The correlation
between variations of these parameters and the model results is linear. However, high
model sensitivity is observed under variations of βA, αA, E0, T0. In general terms, the
acceptable variation of these parameters is ±20 %. Moreover the deviation in the
model results due to variations of these parameters is nonlinear. For example, ﬂuc-
tuations of the surface temperature T0 within ±5 K turn out to be not hazardous to the
system, causing small variations of J(t) by ±10 %, but ﬂuctuations of T0 by ±7 K cause
much larger variations in the value of J(t) by ±30 %. Under this the temporal
dependence of the system dynamics to variations in the parameters is diverse.
The SSMAE structure and its realization do not completely describe the pro-
cesses taking place in Arctic Basin. The optimal extension of the SSMAE functions
is possible by the use of environmental monitoring data to control parametric and
functional model inputs. In this framework the prognosis of the Arctic aquageo-
system state is realized on the basis of the SSMAE and by processing of the
observed data.
6.5 The Angara-Yenisey River System Simulation Model
6.5.1 Introduction
The Arctic region is a mosaic of freshwater, terrestrial and marine ecosystems, inti-
mately interactive with the factors of the Nature/Society system. Interactions include
many components such as Ocean/Atmosphere/Ice, Land/Atmosphere/Ice and Land/
Ocean/Freshwater. An interpretation and prediction of correlations between the
processes occurring in the Arctic environment, is possible only in the framework of
the complex approach to the study of these processes. This approach is based on the
GIMS—technology (Krapivin and Shutko 2012). The interaction between the
atmosphere, land and sea ecosystems under the arctic climate is characterized by a
series of spatial-temporal scales. An understanding of the interior correlations at

correlations between these elements and other elements of the NSS makes it possible
to form the knowledge base for the Arctic Basin monitoring system.
Interactions between the arctic components of the global NSS were studied by
many authors (McCauley and Meier 1991; Kondratyev and Johannessen 1993;
Riedlinger and Preller 1991; Preller and Cheng 1999; Krapivin and Varotsos 2008).
The Angara/Yenisey river system of Siberia is considered as an example of these
interactions. The intensive industrial development of the Northern Russian terri-
tories has led to signiﬁcant environmental changes in these regions (Morgan and
Codispoti 1995). The major quantities of pollution substances are brought to the
northern coast of Russia by the rivers, thus violating the ecosystems of the northern
seas. One such river system is Angara-Yenisey river system (AYRS).
The Yenisey river ﬂows northward to the Kara Sea along the boundary between
the western Siberian ﬂood plain and the central uplands, draining an area of about
2.6 million km2 during its 4,100 km length. The ﬂow rate of the Yenisey into the
Kara Sea has large seasonal variations, averaging 19,800 m3/s, and as high as
130,000 m3/s during the spring run-off. The Angara, a major tributary, accounts for
about one fourth of the total ﬂow. It ﬂows swiftly northward from Lake Baikal for
about one third of its 1,850 km length, before turning westward, toward its con-
ﬂuence with the Yenisey. Recognizing that major sources of the radionuclides
found in the Kara Sea, as well as other environmental pollutants, might lie in the
Siberian watersheds of the Yenisey and the Angara, a joint Russian-American
expedition was undertaken in July and August of 1995. The region where the
expedition was conducted includes the ﬁve hydroelectric dams at Krasnoyarsk and
Sayano-Shushenskoye on the Yenisey and at Irkutsk, Bratsk and Ust-Ilimsk on the
Angara. The power output from these facilities has fostered rapid industrial growth
in this region. Krasnoyarsk is the major industrial city located on the upper reaches
of the Yenisey. Nearby is the nuclear production and processing facility,
Krasnoyarsk-26, which is situated approximately 270 km upstream of the
Angara-Yenisey junction. Along the Angara River, there are ﬁve cities with major
industrial activities: Irkutsk, Angarsk, Usolye-Sibirskoye, Svirsk and Bratsk. These
cities have facilities producing both radionuclides and chemical pollutants that can
contribute to the source terms in the two rivers.
Samples of Angara River water and sediments were taken, beginning from near
its source at Lake Baikal and continuing at selected sites of interest, downstream to
its junction with the Yenisey river, near the lumber processing village of Strelka.
Along the Yenisey sampling was conducted on both sides of the junction, begin-
ning upstream from just below the village of Kazachinskoye and continuing
downstream to the town of Lesosibirsk.
As is shown in Krapivin (1995), a complex evaluation of the pollution level in
the Arctic Basin as a whole, is possible by synthesis of a mathematical model of
pollutant transport by the rivers from adjacent territories.

6.5.2 Model Description
Following the work of Krapivin (1995), the block-diagram of the AYRSSM (AYRS
simulation model) is represented in Fig. 6.12. The AYRSSM has three levels of
blocks. A description of the AYRSSM blocks is given in Table 6.13. The two
blocks of the ﬁrst level realize the control for the models of different processes and
ensure various regimes of the computer experiments. The block HYD simulates the
river’s ﬂow with consideration of the correlation between the water regime and
ecological, topographical and synoptical parameters of the territory studied. The
block CON realizes the functions of the informational interface between the user
and the other AYRSSM blocks. The main function of CON is forming the database
and the identiﬁcation of the AYRS elements. The four blocks of the second level
analyze the input information and synthesize the AYRSSM structure. The twenty
six blocks of the third level realize the concrete models and processes during the
computer experiment.
It is supposed that the AYRS watershed has an area Ω. The spatial structure of Ω
is determined by the spatial discretization of the AYRS surface with a uniform
Fig. 6.12 Structure of the AYRSSM. Description of the blocks are given in Table 6.13

occupied by the river, μ is the river speed, vφ and vλ are the speed projections of the
ground water motion, x is the direction of river ﬂow, and t is time.
The functions on the right side of Eqs. (6.17)–(6.20) are described by mathe-
matical expressions in accordance with the papers by Krapivin et al. (1996) and
Bras (1990). Appropriate models are given in Table 6.13. There are many real-
izations for some of these functions. This provides the user of the AYRSSM with
the possibility of forming scenarios for the computer experiments. Values of ξ, μ
and v were estimated on the basis of the Irkutsk Scientiﬁc Center database. It is
possible for the user to vary these parameters during the calculation process. In this
study, average values of these parameters are estimated by ξ = 3.3 m/s, μ = 1.7 m/s
and v = 0. Variations of the parameter μ are realized by adaptation of the left part of
Eq. (6.18) to the empirical data illustrated in Fig. 6.13. Boundary conditions for
Eqs. (6.17)–(6.20) are formed by the global model (Krapivin 1993). Soil moisture
transport between the cells Xk is neglected. Synoptic situations are described by a
discrete scheme with temporal parameters ti (i = 1, …, 4), where t1 is the beginning
of the summer period, t2 is the start of winter, t3 is the end of winter, and t4 is the
time of the spring thaw when the snow and ice are melting. Between these times the
synoptical situation does not change.
In the common case, the vertical structure of the river water area in Xk (k = 1, …,
N) is described by block SES (Krapivin 1995). A snow layer of thickness gk is
formed at the expense of ﬂow Bk according to:

motion and their accumulation in sediments, ice, snow and the living biomass. The
pollutant types are divided into radio nuclear elements and heavy metals. The set of
radio nuclear pollutants is described by the index ν. The set of heavy metals is divided
into particles (index e) and the dissolved fraction (index ψ).

described by similar balance models in analogy with the models described by
Somes (1999) and Kram (1999). The AYRS biology is given in the form of a

6.5.3 In-Situ Measurements
To obtain the data for the AYRSSM database, the joint US/Russian expedition to
Siberia’s Angara and Yenisey rivers was conducted in the summer of 1995
(Krapivin and Phillips 2001b; Phillips et al. 1997; Krapivin et al. 1997a, 1998a).
Sampling began at the town of Bolshaya Rechka on the Angara near Lake Baikal
and continued past the cities of Irkutsk, Angarsk and Bratsk, with a side trip on the
Kitoy River, near Angarsk. The expedition then proceeded to the Yenisey-Angara
junction. Sampling began near the village of Kulakovo, upstream on the Angara
and continued downstream to the junction with the Yenisey at the logging town of
Strelka. On the Yenisey, sampling began near the town of Kazachinskoye above the
junction and continued downstream past the industrial complex at Lesosibirsk
below the junction. Figure 6.14 shows points of measurement during this
expedition.
The water balance of the AYRS was calculated with the data given in Fig. 6.13.
Some results from this expedition are given in Tables 6.14, 6.15 and 6.16. A
transportable radionuclide analysis system, consisting of a mechanically-cooled
germanium gamma-ray spectrometer in a lead shield, was set up on-site in Irkutsk.
Results of this analysis are given in Table 6.14. An X-ray-ﬂuorescent spectrometer
(XRF) was also set up on-site and used for screening of the samples for heavy
metals. After the expedition, samples were sent to a commercial laboratory for
elemental analysis. Results of this analysis are given in Tables 6.15 and 6.16.
Results for each of these two categories of pollutants are discussed below.
Table 6.16 represents comparison of results (ppm) of the laboratory analysis of the
1996 expedition materials on the Angara water quality (Analytical Services Center
of Ecology and Environment, Inc., New York).
The manmade radioisotope 137Cs (30-year half-life) was detected in all samples
analyzed from above the Irkutsk dam, with concentrations ranging from 2 to
12 Bq kg−1 (dry weight). These values are consistent with background levels that
can be expected due to global fallout as a residual from atmospheric nuclear testing.
Below the Irkutsk dam in the vicinity of the cities of Irkutsk and Angarsk, the
measured 137Cs concentrations ranged from <4 to 30 Bq kg−1, indicating that some
of the samples contained 137Cs concentrations were signiﬁcantly higher than the

junction on the Yenisey, the 137Cs concentration in the samples ranged from 3 to
27 Bq/kg. The latter value is signiﬁcantly above the activity levels detected on the
Angara River upstream of the junction.
In samples drawn from the Yenisey river at and upstream of the junction, were
much higher than background levels were detected, of the neutron activation
product 60Co (5.27-year half-life) and of the ﬁssion products 137Cs and 152Eu (13.3-
year half-life): ranging from 9 to 240 Bq kg−1 for 60Co; from 14 to 400 Bq kg−1 for
137Cs; and from 7 to 150 Bq kg−1 for 152Eu. These are unmistakable indications of
reactor products and are consistent with releases from the plutonium production
reactors at Krasnoyarsk-26, which is approximately 270 km upstream on the Ye-
nisey River. The large variations in the measured activities were due to sampling
location: the higher values came from a dead-end backwater channel with thick
sediment (J3) and from a ﬂood-plain area with thick mud deposits (J7), while the
lower values came from sandy sediment (J2) where the current was swift and
deposits were more likely to be washed away.
Above background levels of 235U and 238U were observed in several samples
taken just below the dam at Irkutsk. However, the measured concentrations for 238U
have large uncertainties due to the relatively weak gamma-ray emission from this
radionuclide. The ratios observed for 235U/238U are larger than the natural abun-
dance of 0.7 % and are outside the statistical uncertainties. However, these are
counting errors only, and do not include uncertainties in the interference between
the overlying 186 keV gamma rays of 235U and 226Ra and possible errors from self-
attenuation due to no uniformity in the samples. These samples were taken in an
area undergoing active landﬁll. As a result, uranium-containing ﬁlls could have
been brought in from elsewhere.
Using the XRF unit as a screening instrument, a set of heavy metals were
identiﬁed in all riverbank and river sediment samples, collected during the expe-
dition. After the expedition, twenty-one river sediment and eight river water sam-
ples were sent for trace element analysis to EPA, a certiﬁed commercial laboratory.
Part of the analytical results is shown in Tables 6.15 and 6.16. Five heavy metals
(Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb) are identiﬁed in all the samples at concentrations which are
within the usual ranges of worldwide background levels. Two heavy metals, As and
Zn, were identiﬁed in the river water samples at concentrations much higher than
the median for natural fresh water (Lal and Stewart 1994). In fact, the Zn con-
centration in four of the samples exceeded the normal range for natural fresh water.
These water samples were collected near to or downstream from industrial com-
plexes on both the Angara and Yenisey rivers.
Table 6.16 gives a comparison of the 1995 US/Russian expedition results to
archived 1978–1980 water-quality data taken from the Angara at Irkutsk, Angarsk
and Bratsk, performed for the Irkutsk Medical Inspection Service (private com-
munication, Svender G.M. and Krechetov A.A., Chemical Department, Irkutsk
State University, Russia). The measurements indicate a signiﬁcantly higher Zn
concentration in the water collected above Angarsk, than was measured previously.

The Arctic Environmental Problems

6.5.4 Experiments Using the Angara-Yenisey River System
Simulation Model
The AYRSSM database includes estimates of the model coefﬁcients, initial infor-
mation for the climatic and anthropogenic scenarios and a set of identiﬁers {Ai}
describing the Ω area by its boundaries, thus giving the structure of the land-water
surface. The CON block provides an interface with the database and allows the user
to modify its elements.
It is assumed that the vertical distribution of pollutants in the river water is
homogeneous, the pollution of the soil and plants is negligible and the cleaning
process of the atmosphere has an exponential character with half-life τa (τa = 10 days
when t 2 ½t1; t2, τa = 20 days when t 2 ½t2; t4). It is believed that the pollution sources
located on the Ω territory support a constant level of distribution of the pollutants. The
distribution function is uniform on the intervals shown in Table 6.17. The values of ξ,
μ and v were determined by average estimates for the last 3 years on the base of
published data (Rovinsky et al. 1995) and data of the Irkutsk Scientiﬁc Center of
Russian Academy of Sciences. The AYRS slope is taken equal to 0.21 m/km. Eco-
logical elements of the AYRS are considered as having unique levels with biomass
β(t), a constant value at each of the intervals ti; tiþ1
½
 (i = 1, 2, 3). The equation for H5m
is written in the form: H5m ¼ ½g1 þ m1 m2 b Qkm D where g1 is the gravitation coef-
ﬁcient (0.05 day−1), m1 is the mortality coefﬁcient (0.01 day−1) and m2 is the pollutant
capture coefﬁcient (0.03 kg−1).
Table 6.17 gives an example of using the AYRSSM for the estimation of 137Cs
distribution in the Ω area where the cells Xi are situated along the AYRS with the
step of discretization at Δx = 10 km. The 137Cs distribution along the river system
has a single maximum which changes in value and coordinate over time. A similar
picture is observed for other radionuclides from Table 6.16. Such a result is not

explained by the location of sources of radio-nuclear pollutants only. It is possible
that the variations in the value and position of maximal 137Cs concentration are
caused by the high turbulence in the river system and by the existence of reservoirs
and eddies. The AYRSSM gives only averaged results. The fourth level blocks in
the AYRSSM structure are necessary for the description of hydrological processes
with Δx < 100 m.
The computer experiments show that the input of radio-nuclear pollution to the
Kara Sea from the Yenisey River has a stable value with dispersion equal to ±32 %.
The role of the AYRS ecosystem in the process of transformation of radio-nuclear
pollution is neglected as small (<3 %). The vertical transport by organisms varies
from 0.1 to 0.7 %. Such calculations can be accomplished in the framework of
different scenarios.
Figure 6.15 shows a distribution of heavy metals concentration along the AYRS
constructed by means of computer experiment. We see that there are three maxima of
heavy metals concentrations located at distances from Lake Baikal of 200, 1200 and
2000 km. This is the result of the distribution of pollution sources along the river
system. The AYRS neutralizes the pollutants over a distance of 600–1,000 km from
the source. The locations of the maxima vary as a function of the river ﬂow rate. For
the ﬂow data of Fig. 6.14 this variation is 150 km. The river system transforms the
pollutant ﬂow such that input into the Kara Sea is estimated at a pollution level which
is less than 2 % of the maximal concentration of pollutant in the AYRS.
Figure 6.16 shows how spatial distribution of oil hydrocarbons is changed 30
and 50 years after t0 when its concentration is zero and processes of transformation
of oil products are postulated. Results of simulation experiments show that the
functional stabilization over the whole Arctic Basin takes 32 months. The con-
centration of heavy metals in the compartments ΩR∪ΩP (river mouths and ports)
exceeds 6 times their level in the Central Basin and twice the level in ΩB∪ΩΓ∪ΩN

(near the coastline, in the Bering Strait and at the southern boundary of the
Norwegian Sea). The concentration of heavy metals in phytoplankton is less by
18 % than in zooplankton and is higher by 26 % than in nekton. There is a process
of accumulation of heavy metals at the upper trophic levels. Besides, the ratio of the
concentration of heavy metals in phytoplankton to that at other trophic levels varies
from 0.3 in ΩR∪ΩP to 0.5 in open waters.
The AYRSSM allows one to estimate the dependence of pollution level in the
AYRS estuary as a function of anthropogenic activity. Suppose that the intensity of
the sources of heavy metals is such that their concentration in the water near
Angarsk, Irkutsk, Krasnoyarsk, Bratsk and Ust-Ilimsk is described by a stationary
function, supporting the heavy metals concentration at the level h at each city
mentioned above. The computer experiments show that there is stable correlation
between h, the heavy metals concentration in the AYRS estuary, and the water ﬂow
rate μ. An increase in h of 10 % leads to a rise of pollution input to Kara Sea by
2.5 %. An increase in μ of 1 % leads to a rise of pollution input to Kara Sea by
0.7 %. These results are correct only when values μ and h are varied near their
average estimates. Near their critical values the estimates are unstable and more
detailed models are required.
In conclusion, it is necessary to note that this study demonstrates the possibility
of using the modeling technology in the solution of complex environmental
problems, demanding the combination of knowledge from different scientiﬁc ﬁelds.
The AYRSSM is one example of such a combination. It gives typical elements for
the synthesis of a simulation system for investigation of Arctic Basin pollution.

The results given in this section illustrate the functional features of the simu-
lation experiment. It is obvious that the strategy of the modeling technology is in
the interplay of model calculations and on-site experiments. In the case considered,
such a strategy secures the economical beneﬁt as it reconstructs the distribution of
pollutants along the AYRS and provides estimates of environmental consequences
under the realization of chosen scenarios.
A joint US/Russian expedition to Siberia’s Angara and Yenisey rivers detected
manmade contaminants in water and sediment samples from industrial regions and
wilderness areas. On-site analysis using sensitive instrumentation revealed radio-
nuclides, heavy metals, and volatile organic compounds. Results indicate that the
nuclear production facility near Krasnoyarsk on the Yenisey River has introduced
radioactive contamination far downstream and is a probable source of previously
detected radioactivity in the Yenisey estuary at its outlet into the Kara Sea.
The AYRSSM is a complex system having an hierarchical structure with natural
and anthropogenic elements. This study of the AYRS is the ﬁrst step where simulation
results are based upon large scale on-site measurements. The method proposed in this
paper can be used for investigation of other Siberian river systems. But to expand the
experimental base, remote sensing technology must be used (Krapivin and Shutko
2012). Remotemonitoring can give more precise data onthe structure of the identiﬁers
A2 and A3, which describe the spatial distribution in the Arctic of the pollutants and the
ice ﬁelds, respectively. The authors hope for the continuation of this study. Based on
the database created, it is planned to prepare a complete set of models and their
corresponding software for description of the process of transfer and transformation of
pollution substances in the Arctic natural ecosystems. This set will demand the syn-
thesis of models for the kinetics of radionuclides and chemical compounds in the food
chains of the water and land ecosystems for the boreal zones, modeling of the
hydrological regime and estimation of pollutant ﬂows in the Arctic Basin.
A ﬁnal aim of the investigations is the development of an environmental tech-
nology which will be the main result of co-operative scientiﬁc work directed toward
the evaluation of the state of the Arctic ecosystem. The modeling system should be
provided with a sufﬁciently full database to have at its disposal a ramiﬁed infor-
mational measuring network and a complete set of computer models for the main
biogeochemical, climatic and biogeocenotic processes.
6.6 Arctic Biocomplexity
6.6.1 Introduction
Biocomplexity refers to phenomena that result from dynamic interactions between
the physical, biological and social components of the Biosphere/Society System
(BSS). The investigations of the processes of interaction between the Society and
Biosphere are, as a rule, targeted at understanding and estimating the consequences
of such interactions. The reliability and precision of these estimations depend on
556

The Arctic Environmental Problems

criteria founded on conclusions, expertise and recommendations. At present, there
is no uniﬁed methodology for selection between the set of criteria due to the
absence of a common science-based approach to the ecological standardization of
anthropogenic impacts on the natural environment. After all, the precision of the
ecological expertise for the functioning and planning of anthropogenic systems, as
well as the representativeness of the global geoinformation monitoring data, depend
on these criteria.
Biocomplexity is the study of complex structures and behaviors that arise from
nonlinear interactions of active biological agents, which may range in scale from
molecules to cells to organisms. Almost every biological system is complex. It is
characterized by emergent properties, where the ensemble possesses capabilities
that its individual agents lack. While physical and chemical processes give rise to a
great variety of spatial and temporal structures, the complexity of even the simplest
biological phenomena is inﬁnitely richer. The goal of many authors is to meld
physical, mathematical, and computational approaches with those of modern
biology to understand this complexity in a quantitative and predictive way (Feller
et al. 2010).
What is bio-complexity? This is a question which many researchers grapple
with, every day. The world of bio-complexity research encompasses the efforts of
many different types of scientists all working towards a common goal, how living
things interact with and affect the environment and each other. It is very hard to ﬁnd
a good deﬁnition for bio-complexity. It includes areas of biology, chemistry,
engineering, oceanography, geology, microbiology, genetics, and ecology. The U.
S. National Science Foundation explains that it “refers to phenomena that arise from
dynamic interactions that take place within biological systems and between these
systems and the physical environment” (http://www.nsf.gov).
Arctic biocomplexity project is examining how biological and physical pro-
cesses interact to control carbon uptake, storage and release in Arctic tundra eco-
systems and how the self-organizing nature of these interactions varies across
multiple spatial and temporal scales. Approximately 25 % of the world’s soil
organic carbon reservoir is stored at high northern latitudes in permafrost and
seasonally-thawed soils in the Arctic, a region that is currently undergoing
unprecedented warming and drying, as well as dramatic changes in human land use.
Understanding how changes in annual and inter-annual ecosystem productivity
interact and potentially offset the balance and stability of the Arctic soil carbon
reservoir is of utmost importance to global climate change science. If there is a net
loss of soil carbon to the atmosphere in the form of greenhouse gases (namely CO2
and CH4), greenhouse warming could be enhanced. This non-linear, potentially
positive feedback response could very quickly cause Arctic terrestrial ecosystems to
function in an unprecedented manner and with globally signiﬁcant implications.
Many international and national projects aim at biocomplexity study for the
arctic regions. Project of Alaska Geobotany Center “Biocomplexity of Frost Boil
Ecosystems” (http://www.geobotany.uaf.edu/cryoturbation) seeks to understand the
complex linkages between biogeochemical cycles, vegetation, disturbance, and
6.6

climate across the full summer temperature gradient in the Arctic in order to better
predict ecosystem responses to changing climate. This project focuses on frost-boils
because:
• The processes that are involved in the self-organization of these landforms drive
biogeochemical
cycling
and
vegetation
succession
of
extensive
arctic
ecosystem.
• Arctic ecosystems contain perhaps the most diverse and ecologically important
zonal ecosystems in the Arctic and are important to global carbon budgets.
• The complex ecological relationships between patterned-ground formation,
biogeochemical cycles, and vegetation and the signiﬁcance of these relation-
ships at multiple scales have not been studied.
• The responses of the system to changes in temperature are likely to be nonlinear,
but can be understood and modeled by examining the relative strengths of
feedbacks between the components of the system at several sites along the
natural arctic temperature gradient.
The project aims to answer six questions related to the biocomplexity of frost-
boil ecosystems:
• How does the self-organization associated with frost boils occur?
• How does the frost heave affect the soil biogeochemical processes within and
between the frost boils?
• How do frost heave and biogeochemical processes affect plant communities?
• How do the biological processes in turn feed back to control frost heave?
• How do interactions between biogeochemistry, cryoturbation and vegetation
change along the existing arctic climate gradient?
• How do the complex patterns associated with frost boils affect the tundra sys-
tems in a hierarchy of spatial-temporal scales?
6.6.2 Biocomplexity of the Arctic Tundra
Global climate change is expected to have a great impact on arctic areas including
tundra. Snowbed habitats develop in areas that accumulate large amounts of winter
snow and these habitats make up a notable component of the tundra biome. In
connection with the arctic environment role in global warming there exist some
aspects that are to be investigated:
• the arctic ecosystem ability to adapt to current and predicted global change;
• the dynamics of plant diversity and community structure along the internal
snow-gradient within the snowbeds and how these are affected by increased
nitrogen deposition;
• seasonal shifts in soil microbial composition;
• plant communities as separate entities with respect to nitrogen turnover and
partitioning;
558
6
The Arctic Environmental Problems

• importance of links between soil biota and plant community structure in
determining nitrogen turnover in tundra ecosystems;
• activities of nitrifying and denitrifying microbes; and
• sensitivity of the snowbed plant communities to global change in the tundra
landscape.
The biodiversity of the tundra as one of biocomplexity component is low: 1,700
species of vascular plants and only 48 species of land mammals can be found,
although millions of birds migrate there each year for the marshes. There are also a
few ﬁsh species such as the ﬂatﬁsh. There are few species with large populations.
Notable animals in the Arctic tundra include caribou (reindeer), musk ox, arctic
hare, arctic fox, snowy owl, lemmings, and polar bears (only near ocean-fed bodies
of water). Tundra is largely devoid of poikilotherms such as frogs or lizards.
The tundra is a bleak and treeless place. Due to the harsh climate of the Arctic
tundra, regions of this kind have seen little human activity, even though they are
sometimes rich in natural resources such as oil and uranium. In recent times this has
begun to change in Alaska, Russia, and some other parts of the world.
The arctic tundra biome is the treeless fringe of land that surrounds the Arctic
Ocean. The terrestrial area of the arctic tundra biome, excluding glaciers and alpine
areas, cover about 5.15 million km2, an area about 3.4 % of the total land surface of
the world. Knowledge and understanding of the complex interactions between
climate, permafrost hydrology, and biological systems can help to assess the nature
of a rapidly changing climate, as well as to understand a character of the nonlinear
response of arctic systems to perturbations and to evaluate the magnitude and extent
of positive and negative feedback processes involved in such fey processes as heat,
CO2 and water vapor exchange between the biosphere and the atmosphere. In this
aspect, important problem is the parameterization of the dynamics of self organi-
zation in processes taking place in the arctic environment (Walker et al. 2008).
Arctic tundra region is characterized by the ubiquitous non-sorted circles that are
formed and persist as an ecosystem due to complex soil-water-energy-ice-plant
relationships and dynamics in the Arctic. Daanen et al. (2008) present model that
captures the dynamics of the physical and biological components of the non-sorted
circle ecosystem. This model helps to understand formation and persistence of this
ecosystem type, especially in a changing climatic environment. Principal structure
of the model is presented in Fig. 6.17.
The assessment of arctic tundra ecosystem biocomplexity puts numerous prob-
lems that are solved in framework of different international and national arctic pro-
grams (Corliss 2002; Walker et al. 2008; Bobylev et al. 2003). For example, the
ACCSV project as part of the Land-Atmosphere –Ice Interactions (LAII) and Arctic
Transitions in the Land-Atmosphere System (ATLAS) puts the following questions:
1. How does the self-organization associated with frost boils occur?
2. How do the biological processes and climate change feed back to control the
formation of frost boils?
3. How does frost heave effect biogeochemical processes within and between the
frost boils?
6.6
Arctic Biocomplexity
559

4. How do biogeochemistry and cryoturbation affect plant communities?
5. How do the complex patterns associated with frost boils affect the tundra sys-
tems in a hierarchy of spatial-temporal scales?
6. How do these patterns and processes change along the existing climate gradient
as the pool of available species and plant functional types changes?
Walker et al. (2008) and Peterson and Krantz (2008) studied differences in many
key ecosystem processes between moist nonacidic tundra (MNT) and moist acidic
tundra (MAT) and represented received results as Table 6.18. More detailed
description of ecological trends is given in Table 6.19. We see that surface moisture

in the arctic tundra is an integrator of biological, geochemical, physical, and
anthropogenic processes and interactions. These processes correlate with regional
and global climate system that mainly depends on biogeochemical cycles of carbon
and methane. Approximately 25 % of the world’s soil organic carbon reservoir is
stored at high northern latitudes in permafrost and seasonally-thawed soils in the
Arctic. Knowledge of carbon cycle in the arctic tundra and understanding of its
dependence on the biological and ecological processes has globally signiﬁcant
implication for the study of non-linear potentially positive feedback response of
arctic climate on the very quickly change of arctic terrestrial ecosystems.
The nature of the interactions among climate, permafrost, hydrology, and arctic
ecosystems was the topic of a “Biocomplexity, Hydrology and Frozen Ground in
Cold Regions” session at the 2006 Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union
(AGU) where problems of arctic tundra investigations refer in part to understanding:
• the nonlinear response of arctic systems to perturbations;
• the magnitude and extent of positive and negative feedback processes involved
in such key processes as heat, CO2, and water vapor exchange between the
biosphere and the atmosphere;
• the dynamics of self organization in processes governing patterned-ground
formation; and
• the high degree of interdisciplinary research required to understand the inter-
actions of biological, physical, and chemical processes in these systems.
Biocomplexity of the arctic tundra ecosystem is determined by coopled con-
sideration of interactions between plants, animals and environment. Arctic plants
include: arctic moss, arctic willow, bearberry, carbon moss, diamond-leaf willow,
labrador tea, pasque ﬂower, tufted saxifrage, reindeer moss, dwarf birch, woodland
geranium, arctic fowl-grass, kelp, lichen centraria. Arctic animals include: arctic
fox, caribou, ermine, grizzly bear, harlequin duck, musk ox, polar bear, walrus,
habitual seal, lemming, northern deer, pink gull, guillemot. Arctic animals migrate
during year depending on the seasonal dynamics of living conditions. Total
dynamic assessment of the biocomplexity of arctic tundra ecosystem can be realized
by the realization of modelling technology for the parameterization of energetic
relations between its components. Figures 6.18 and 6.19 gives the principal
schemes for possible model realizations. Model that realizes the diagram of
Fig. 6.18, demonstrates dual nutrient controls across trophic levels and its bio-
geochemical signiﬁcance. Figure 6.19 characterizes trophic interactions between
the tundra plants and some living components of the arctic ecosystem.
Biocomplexity ξ(t) of the tundra ecosystem has a seasonal character, changing,
depending on the migration regime and climate that is characterized by low tem-
peratures during practically all year. Average temperature of the most warm month
(July or August) in the tundra is 10–15 °C. The vegetation reanimation is observed
when the summer comes and solar radiation is available. Life processes in the
tundra is continued during winter period only in the lakes and marshes, as well as
partly in soils. Figure 6.20 shows typical distribution of the biocomplexity in the
arctic tundra calculated for meteorological conditions averaged for 2000–2013.

The Arctic Environmental Problems

6.6.3 Biocomplexity Problem Related to Fisheries
in the Okhotsk Sea
6.6.3.1 Introduction and Overview
Okhotsk Sea is one of the most unique object of the northern latitudes, where
dynamics of ecological processes and their correlation with global changes were
studied with poor accuracy, what did not allow to realize reliable forecasting of the
ecosystem productivity. Therefore, principal concern is given to the study of the
Okhotsk Sea ecosystem. Results of theoretical and experimental investigations that
were received earlier, allow to understand the basic schemes for energy ﬂows in the
Okhotsk Sea ecosystem and to address to the more detail consideration of their
structure, depending on the climate parameters changes and anthropogenic factor
impacts, including pollution and ﬁshery.
Certainly, the basic interest to the Okhotsk Sea ecosystem state was appeared
and was developed from the direction of Russian Federation and Japan, as countries
realizing the use of its ecological resources. There, exist institutes both in Russian
Federation and in Japan, where the basic goal of them is the study of conditions of
functioning and using the Okhotsk Sea resources. The Moscow Institute of
Oceanology and Far-Eastern Institute of Oceanology of Russian Academy of Sci-
ences and others, have collected for the realization of this goal, enough complete
series of data about characteristics of various trophic levels of the Okhotsk Sea
ecosystem and have studied in detail the geophysical and meteorological conditions
of its functioning (Leonov et al. 2007; Dulepova 2002). All Russian Scientiﬁc-
Research Institute for Fishery and Oceanography and set of other Institutes have
published many scientiﬁc works with the description of dynamics of Okhotsk Sea
aquageosystem parameters, including biological, chemical, physical, and geological

components. However, all the results of these investigations have mainly a
descriptive character and are oriented on the explanation of particular effects and
processes, explaining only partially the functional features of all ecosystem of the
Okhotsk Sea and, especially, doing no assessment of such important characteristics
as the dependence of ecosystem complexity on the external factors of natural and
anthropogenic origin.
Special attention to the study of the Okhotsk Sea is given by many research
centers of Japan. In particular, the Annual International Symposium on Okhotsk
Sea and Sea Ice were organized during many years in Mombetsu (Hokkaido) by the
Okhotsk Sea and Cold Ocean Research Association and Hokkaido University.

The Arctic Environmental Problems

The Meteorological Research Institute (Hokkaido) has produced a database of long-
term meteorological data, the use of which gives a possibility to exclude the
application of inaccurate climatic models for the creation of Okhotsk Sea ecosystem
model.
An interest to the Okhotsk Sea ecosystem is caused by the need to assess the
consequences of global changes for the ecosystems of northern latitudes and by the
requirement of elaboration of effective informational technologies, that guarantee
reliable monitoring of these vulnerable natural systems. Such informational tech-
nologies have been created in the Kotelnikov’s Institute of Radioengineering and
Electronics of Russian Academy of Science (Krapivin and Varotsos 2008; Krapivin
and Shutko 2012) with reference to the synthesis of monitoring systems, aiming to
detect earlier tropical hurricanes, warming on the underﬂooding and ﬂoods, as well
as forecasting of ﬁre dangerous in the forests.
This section describes ideas and some results of the application of a new
information technology for the diagnostics of complex and many-sided dynamics of
the Okhotsk Sea ecosystem. This technology is based on the generalization of
experience that was now accumulated under the study of the Okhotsk Sea eco-
system and on the transfer of existing data to narrow range of spatial-temporal
scales. This range is deﬁned by the need to receive the assessments for the changes
of energy balance in the Okhotsk Sea ecosystem. First attempt to solve this task was
undertaken in Rostov-Don State University by means of creation of integral model
of the Okhotsk Sea ecosystem (Berdnikov et al. 1989). Next versions of this model
were proposed by Krapivin and Varotsos (2008). Integral indicator of the sea
ecosystem state based on the calculation of biocomplexity indices was introduced
by Krapivin and Mkrtchyan (2009a). These indices summarize such ecosystem
characteristics as bioavailability, biodiversity, and survivability. An introduction of

the biocomplexity indicator was realized by means of the use of methods of stability
and ecosystem survivability theory. Into the framework of this study, it is supposed
to adopt and develop this with reference to the conditions of the Okhotsk Sea
ecosystem functioning.
Biocomplexity of the Okhotsk Sea ecosystem is considered as a derivative of
totality of biological, physical, chemical, social, and anthropogenic interactions
between the environmental sub-systems that impact on this ecosystem. Biocom-
plexity is a complex index describing the dynamic interactions within the envi-
ronmental system, taking into consideration of the human factors.
Humankind has accumulated sufﬁcient knowledge about environmental systems.
The use of this knowledge to study the biocomplexity is possible within the
framework of the synthesis of a global model that reﬂects the laws of interactions
between environmental components and permits assess to an “efﬁciently” of real-
ization of the scenarios of the human society development, based on the data of
ground and satellite measurements.
Into the framework of this study, a biocomplexity conception is connected with
laws of Okhotsk Sea ecosystem, functioning as unity of its elements that have
different temporal and spatial scales. To deﬁne and assess it will develop a joint
formal description of biological, geochemical, geophysical and anthropogenic
factors and processes, taking place on a given level of spatial-temporal hierarchy
scales and standards, including the dependencies of these factors and processes on
the global changes in the biosphere and climate. The formation of the Okhotsk Sea
ecosystem biocomplexity is studied at the expense of existing data about laws of its
sub-system functioning, taking into consideration of the spatial and biological
levels of their formation. The simulation model of the ecosystem functioning within
the arctic climate conditions will be created. The stress full situations that can arise
by natural and anthropogenic reasons will be studied, basing on this model. The
characteristics of the ecosystem and components survivability will be deﬁned, as
well as allowable levels for the anthropogenic impacts will be established. Taking
into account of the human factor and of inﬂuence of global changes on the Okhotsk
Sea ecosystem, will be realized by means of global model of “biosphere-society”
system that was developed by Krapivin and Kelley (2009). An integral index for the
ecosystem state was introduced as an indicator of biocomplexity for the formalized
description of biocomplexity. It allows to characterize the level of correlation
between the Okhotsk Sea sub-system and to introduce numerical scale of bio-
complexity, which gives a new level for the analysis of biological, chemical and
physical processes of interactions between the ecosystem elements (Kelley et al.
1992a, b, 1999a, b).
As a result of this study, the oceanologic conditions in all scales of the Sea of
Okhotsk, on the basis of satellite supervision is investigated. Also, the oceanologic,
hydrochemical and zooplankton conditions are studied in the gulf of Aniva, during
various seasons of year on the basis of ship shootings; the analysis of materials of
tool measurements of currents (east shelf of island Sakhalin) (Shevchenko et al.
2004).

The Arctic Environmental Problems

The results of this study were mainly the realization developed of the new
informational technologies for the diagnostics of the Okhotsk Sea ecosystem state,
which produces the conditions for the development of such decisions on regional
and international levels, giving the possibility to defense the unique region from the
unwanted changes. These technologies include the methods for measurement of sea
water characteristics together with the use of sensors of spectroellipsometry and
microwave radiometry.
In order to achieve the basic goal of this study, it is necessary to solve a set of
particular tasks, between of them most important are:
1. Search of correlation between complexity of biological, physical, chemical and
social systems in the Okhotsk Sea region.
2. Determination of laws in cycles of energy and substrate within the Okhotsk Sea
ecosystem taking into account of levels of their organization.
3. Investigation of oceanological conditions in the whole Sea of Okhotsk on the
base of satellite observations.
4. Investigation of oceanological and hydrochemical conditions and zooplankton
status in the Aniva Gulf in different seasons from ship expeditions data; mooring
current measurements data analysis (eastern Sakhalin shelf).
5. Description of adaptation mechanisms for the Okhotsk Sea ecosystem elements
to the changes of environmental characteristics.
6. Search of constructive methods for the parameterization of structure of energy
and substance ﬂows in the Okhotsk Sea ecosystem, giving a possibility to
construct the effective small-scale simulation model of its functioning.
7. Adaptation of technology of geoecological information—modeling system
(GIMS-technology) to the conditions of Okhotsk Sea region.
6.6.3.2 Biocomplexity Model of the Okhotsk Sea
The Okhotsk Sea belongs to the type of seas with high ecosystem productivity
(150–300 g C m−2 year−1) which functions under a rigorous climate. The structure
of the spatial-temporal ﬁelds of the basic hydrological and ecological characteristics
of Okhotsk Sea is heterogeneous. The chemical, physical and biological processes
occuring in sea waters, have been studied by many authors to assess its biopro-
ductivity. According to the investigations by Terziev et al. (1993), the following
structural discretization of the Okhotsk Sea can be realized. Five ecological layers
exist. Layer 1, of maximal photosynthesis, is situated above the thermocline and has
a depth of about 20–30 m. In fact, it corresponds to the wind-mixed layer. Layer 2
occupies the water space from 30 to 150 m in depth. It has low temperatures and
oxygen saturation of about 80–90 %. Layer 3, characterized by low oxygen satu-
ration (15–20 %), lies between the depth of 150–750 m. Layer 4 extends from
750 m down to a depth of 1,500 m. This layer has minimal oxygen saturation (10–
15 %). Lastly, layer 5 is situated deeper than 1,500 m. It is characterized by oxygen
saturation of 25–30 %.
6.6
Arctic Biocomplexity

The Okhotsk Sea ecosystem includes the following groups: phytoplankton,
bascterioplankton, protozoa, herbivorous zooplankton, predatory zooplankton,
nonpredatory zoobenthos, predatory zoobenthos, pelagic ﬁshes, demersal ﬁshes,
demersal invertebrates, squids, seabirds, marine mammals. Fish community
includes the following species: pollock, herring, capelin, deep sea smelt, cyclop-
teriids, sakhalin plaice. Total ﬁsh biomass during 1985–2013 was reduced from 8.9
mollion tonnes to 4.9 million tonnes. Fish biomass reducing process has different
anthropogenic forcings: water pollution and overexpluitation
of biological
resources.
The Okhotsk Sea aquatory is divided into zones having speciﬁc ecological
features (Suzuki 1992). The spatial distribution of the ﬁsh biomass depends on
seasonal conditions and to a great extent correlates with the layers outlined above.
The use of the sea biological resources is a function of this distribution. The ﬁshing
intensity essentially depends on the knowledge of the biomass distribution in the
zones with speciﬁc environmental conditions. Many authors (Plotnikov 1996; Aota
et al. 1992; Krapivin and Soldatov 2009a) have tried to solve this task by means of
models simulating the ecosystem dynamics. However, the modeling results do not
always turn out to be sufﬁciently representative and reﬂect the classiﬁcation of sea
zones by their productivity scale. The biocomplexity indicator is one such simple
form, which can identify these zones. In fact, it is shown by many investigators that
the Okhotsk Sea zones with high productivity, are characterized by complex many-
level trophic charts (Terziev et al. 1993). This effect is not universal to other seas.
For instance, the Peruvian current ecosystem has high productivity in zones where
the trophic chain is short (Krapivin 1996). These situations are distinguished by the
migration processes. That is why the biocomplexity of these ecosystems is formed
in various ways.
The following components of the Okhotsk Sea ecosystem are mentioned in

Designate the water area of the Okhotsk Sea by Ω = {(φ, λ)}. The value of the
biocomplexity indicator for any area ω ∈Ω is determined by ξω(z1, z2, t), where [z1,
z2] is the water layer located between depths z1 and z2. The maximal value of
ξ = ξmax(≈20) is reached during the spring-summer period, when nutritive relations
into the Okhotsk Sea ecosystem are extended, the intensity of energetic exchanges
is increased and horizontal and vertical migration processes are stimulated. In the
winter time the value of ξ is reduced to near ξmin (≈8). The spatial distribution of
reﬂects the local variability of the food spectrum for its components. Table 6.21 and

Fig. 6.21 show an example of such a distribution. Comparison of this distribution
with the distribution of zones with industrial ﬁsh accumulations (Terziev et al.
1993), shows that there is a correlation between these distributions.
In the common case, the indicator
ξ reﬂects the level of complexity of the
Okhotsk Sea ecosystem. A change ξ in is realized as a consequence of migration
processes and of the variability of nutritive interactions. The subsystem B20 plays a
role in these processes as an external source of change in the other components.
These changes are interpreted in terms of ﬁshing and other impacts causing vari-
ations in the biomass of the components.
Calculations show that basic variability in n ¼ n=nmax is caused by migration
processes, under which quick redistribution of the interior structure of the matrices
X and


 occurs. For instance, according to Terziev et al. (1993) many ﬁsh
species during spring time migrate to the shelf zone, and during winter time they
move to the central aquatories of the sea. Therefore, the value of n→1 during
spring and n→0.6 during winter for the shelf zone. This means that the

biocomplexity of the Okhotsk sea ecosystem in the shelf decreases by 40 % in
winter in comparison with spring. For the central aquatories, the value n changes
little during the year. Such stability of the biocomplexity indicator is explained by
the balance between nutritive correlations and productivity during the spring,
summer and winter seasons.
It can be established that the variability in n reﬂects the changes of ﬁsh con-
centrations which are controlled by environmental conditions. Speciﬁcally, during
the spring time Clupeapallasi escapes occupy the area with TW < 5 °C. Other ﬁshes
have a preferred depth for their feeding and spawning (Terziev et al. 1993). All
these processes exert an inﬂuence on the variability of n. A more detailed inves-
tigation of the correlations between the value of n and the structural and behavioral
dynamics of the Okhotsk Sea ecosystem requires additional studies.
This section introduces the main idea of how to move from the verbal
description of biocomplexity to its numerical representation. In future studies it is
necessary to take into consideration bottom relief, climate trends, ice ﬁelds
dynamics, detailed components of the trophic pyramid, bottom sediments and the
structure of the currents. Also, it is necessary to add to the formula (6.30) the
members describing the anthropogenic impacts on the ecosystem considered in a
socio-economic sense.
6.6.4 Expert System for Monitoring of the Okhotsk Sea
Environment
There are many examples of effective marine models making it possible to study the
sea ecosystem dynamics. However, the sea ecosystem modeling runs into difﬁ-
culties, which requires the development of new modeling methods and monitoring
data processing algorithms. Namely, the functioning of the sea ecosystem is
complex under unstable conditions of the environment. These conditions are
deﬁned for both measured and unmeasured parameters. Therefore, the sea eco-
systems are studied with the use of observation data, mathematical models, and
satellite observations. A combination of these approaches gives the most useful
results. The main difﬁculties of this method arise because of incompleteness of
information. These difﬁculties are negotiated by new information-modeling tech-
nology developed by Krapivin and Kelley (2009).
Aota et al. (1991a, b) and Kaevitser et al. (2013) proposed new view on the
Okhotsk Sea monitoring, basing on the Global Information-Modeling System that
entails synthesizing a simulation model of the Okhotsk Sea environment (OSE) to
describe the associated ecosystem dynamics. These help to describe the spatial
dynamics of OSE and to optimize the monitoring regime. Additional application of
biocomplexity indicator gives possibility to have spatial distribution of OSE ele-
ments with their characteristics.

The OSE model structure and the scheme of energy ﬂuxes in the ecosystem of
the Okhotsk Sea are shown in Figs. 6.22 and 6.23, respectively. A complete system
of equations of ecosystem dynamics is formed from the set of traditional balance,
hydrodynamic, and biogeochemical equations (Krapivin et al. 2007a).

The ecosystem block includes the following components: bacterioplankton (D1),
phytoplankton (D2), zooplankton (D3), benthos (D4), nekton (D5), nutrients (D6),
dissolved organic matter (D7), detritus (D8), oxygen (D9), and salts (S). Climate
block simulates the temperature (T), illumination (E), and wind (v , α). The block
describing a water regime takes into account the following processes: precipitation
(F), evaporation (I), current
Vu; Vk; Vz


, river run-off, and water exchange with
Paciﬁc ocean (β). The block considering anthropogenic processes includes the
water exchange with Paciﬁc Ocean (β) and pollution h
ð Þ.
The scheme to calculate the temperature regime is in fact an approximate sim-
ulation. This semi-empirical approach is acceptable for the climatic zone of the
Okhotsk Sea and does not require complicated calculations. The exchange pro-
cesses with water masses between the segments Vi (i = 1, …, N) are simulated with
account of information on directions and velocities of the currents contained in the
data base.
The functioning of the Okhotsk Sea ecosystem is determined by severe climatic
conditions. During 6–7 months in a year the sea is almost completely covered with
ice 80–100 cm thick. Therefore, in the OSE model the vertical structure of the
Okhotsk Sea is presented as a vertical section shown in Fig. 6.24. With account of
this scheme, in the zones of the frozen sea the energy ﬂuxes in Fig. 6.23 get
complicated due to partition of the component “phytoplankton” into three possible
media. Schematically it is shown in Fig. 6.25.
The equations of OSE dynamics have a set of coefﬁcients X = X1∪X2∪X3, where
sub-set X1 contains the coefﬁcients values which are determined with the high
precision, sub-set X2 consists of the coefﬁcients determined by inaccuracy, and sub-
set X3 = X\(X2∪X1) has the coefﬁcients which are inestimated. Simulation procedure
foresees two-tier process of model adaptation. At the ﬁrst tier the model adaptation
process is realized at the expense of sub-set X3 coefﬁcients determination. This

process consists in the variation of coefﬁcient values in the ranges ﬁxed by the OSE
model user. The quality criterion is formulated by the user proceeding also from the
existing experimental data or from the other consideration. Service block of the
OSE model has a set of such possibilities. The user can demand to minimize the
divergence between his data about some characteristic of OSE and its model esti-
mation. Spectrum of such parameters spreads to main individual and integral
elements of OSE.
At the second tier, the model adaptation process is continued by increasing the
precision of sub-set X2. The quality criterion of this process is based on the
improvement of model quality reached during the ﬁrst stage of adaptation process.
Thus, the simulation procedure of the SMOSE is a continuous process of model
adaptation via the coefﬁcient changes or trophical graph modiﬁcation. Really there
is a set of models {Ai}. This set is formed with the sorting out of model parameters.
Every model Ai is characterized by the quality level Qi. Complete model A* is
formed as the limit of above models set. The ﬁnishing of adaptation procedure

Simulations of the OSE offer the possibility for studying various aspects of how
the OSE functions. Below there are some simulation results received under the
values of OSE parameters. Speciﬁcally, the present status of the OSE is of great
interest in order to understand the role of anthropogenic inﬂuence on it. According
to the common theory of complex systems, a dynamic system is in the ‘living state’

Correlations between the trophic levels and nonliving elements give summary
conditions for survivability criteria: Dmin ≤ΣDi. Finally, survivability criteria for the
OSE can be written in the form: J(t) ≥αJ(t0), where J = U(t)/U(t0),

ðu;k;zÞ Bkðt; u; k; xÞdx; t0 is a moment of time when value of
function A(t) is considered as known; α < 1 is the level of survivability. Really, we
consider the OSE to be in a living state if the condition J(t) > αJ(t0) is carried out for
t > t0. Calculations of J(t) for t > t0 demonstrate how the OSE reaction depends on
the variability of various environmental conditions. For example, ﬂuctuations in the
oxygen saturation of water may be of anthropogenic origin (oil pollution, large
discharge of sewage waters, temperature increase, etc.). The J(t) shows that the
OSE displays a high degree of stability with respect to the initial saturation of water
with oxygen, then how the OSE proceeds rapidly to a quasi-stationary regime of
functioning at D9(t0, φ, λ, z) ≥1.8 ml/l and how long it takes to overcome the initial
shortage of oxygen in the case of D9(t0, φ, λ, z) = 1.1 ml/l. For D9(t0, φ, λ,
z) ≤0.8 ml/l, the OSE is unable to proceed to the stationary regime of functioning.
The OSE is observed to be more sensitive to dynamic effects when the water is
saturated with oxygen. A reduction of the oxygen production by 12 % does not
inﬂuence the OSE dynamics. However, the OSE does not survive when the oxygen
production is decreased as much as 20 %.
Calculations of J(t) offer the possibility for detecting the capability in searching
zones at risk for survivability in Ω. For instance, one of particularly dangerous
anthropogenic inﬂuences is the change in nutrient concentration. Simulation
experiments enable us to determine the variations in the vertical uprising velocity of
water within the same range.
To estimate the turbulent escape of nutrients into layers, overlying the maximal
depth of photosynthetic layer (z ≤h*), it is assumed in the SMOSE that the velocity
of water uprise is equal to 10−3 cm/s. The obtained data point to the fact that, on the
average, the integrated pattern of the distribution of community elements is not a
subject to any signiﬁcant variations within the velocity range from 3.5 × 10−4 to
10−2 and even 10−1 cm/s, but it is observed to be drastically distorted under a
higher, which is the most important under a lower (<10−4 cm/s) vertical advection
of water.
Table 6.22 gives some of the results obtained in the case of a variation of the
concentration of nutrients at the initial moment of time t0. From the comparison of
the results contained herein, it seems that a variation of the nutrients concentration
within a wide range at the moment t = t0 does not practically affect the behaviour of
OSE at the moments t ≫t0. The system, so to speak, ‘healts’ with time from the
‘blows’, has suffered and proceeds to the same functioning level. When initial
nutrient conditions is limiting, the OSE teaches the stable state during 50 days only.
If the nutrient concentration at the time t0 has unlimited level the OSE had reached
the stable state on the 30th day after beginning of simulation experiment.
The OSE model allows to realize other various simulation experiments. Clearly,
there exist some problems with parametrical descriptions of OSE functions.
6.6

The ﬁrst problem for the future modernization of the OSE model is the extension of
parametrical description of energy and heat exchange between OSE and the
atmosphere to increase the model validity and to establish the dependence between
model parameters and satellite measurements. The second problem of the OSE
model to be greater in accuracy, consists in the detailed elaboration of OSE ele-
ments to extend its applied signiﬁcance to the ﬁshing. The description in more
details of OSE biological balance with the formation of industrial ﬁshes has a
priority for future investigations. Finally, the third problem to improve the OSE
model by synthesizing an expert system at the center of which the OSE model will
be the main unit.
6.7 Carbon Cycle Dynamics in the Arctic System
Studies of the climate-forming processes in the Arctic, whose principal feature is
determined by the isolation of the ocean from the atmosphere by the ice cover, have
long been of particular concern. The most important impacts of sea ice on the
climate, as revealed through numerical modeling, are the following:
(1) Maximum climate warming with increasing CO2 concentration in the win-
tertime Arctic due to increased heat input from the ocean through the thinner
ice, as a result of the warming;
(2) The effect of albedo on the atmospheric temperature of the more extended sea
ice 18,000 years ago, which is compatible with the impact of continental
glaciers; and
(3) Possible reversal of the conventional relationship between the amplitude of the
annual change of temperature and the depth of the oceanic mixed layer when

the sea ice dynamics are taken into account. A thinner mixed layer favors the
strengthening of the wintertime sea ice, which causes a delay of the springtime
melting and produces a colder summer. The latest data of numerical modeling
has conﬁrmed, on the whole, by Kondratyev and Johannessen (1993),
Kondratyev (1990).
When discussing the problem of the role of the polar regions in the formation of
global changes, one should have in mind that two aspects of the global ecology are
of paramount importance:
(1) the anthropogenically induced redistribution of the components of the heat
balance of the Earth as a planet (with emphasis on the problem of the atmo-
spheric greenhouse effect and its climatic impact); and
(2) anthropogenically induced breaking of the global biogeochemical cycles
(primarily, this refers to carbon, nitrogen and sulfur).
That is why polar regions are very speciﬁc as a component of the globaleco-
system. These aspects are not taken into account completely by the existing global
models of the Nature/Society system. A new approach to the synthesis of geo-
information monitoring systems, proposed by (Krapivin and Shutko 2012), over-
comes this shortfall. In the framework of this approach the interchange of CO2
between high latitude vegetation, the North Ocean and the atmosphere is considered
as part of a global biogeochemical cycle, described through the framework of a
Global Simulation Model (GSM) (Krapivin 1993). The GSM is comprised of
blocks that parameterize the following:
(1) the global hydrological balance;
(2) productivity of soil-plant formations, with 30 types deﬁned;
(3) photosynthesis in the ocean ecosystems taking into account depth and surface
inhomogeneity;
(4) demographic processes; and
(5) anthropogenic changes.
The GSM makes it possible to compute the dynamics of industrial CO2 distri-
bution between the oceans, terrestrial biota and the atmosphere. The GSM describes
the World Ocean by a spatial four-layer model with due regard for water chemistry.
Spatial heterogeneity of the World Ocean is represented by the structural distri-
bution of surface temperature applied to the upwelling and convergence zones. Sea
ice in the polar region is considered through use of CIESIN data (Yohe et al. 2006).
The biogeochemical cycle of CO2 is described by balance equations in accordance
with Fig. 1.30. The GSM carbon dioxide block takes into consideration the
dependence of ﬂows H2 and H3 from water surface processes (wind-wave mixing,
rough seas, foaming waves) (Alekseev et al. 1992; Weis et al. 1982). Simulation
experiments have shown that these ﬂows have variations from 16 to 1,250 mol m−2
year−1. In the Arctic Ocean during the June-September period the partial pressure pa
of CO2 in the atmosphere exceeds the partial pressure of CO2 in the sea waters by
20–110 ppm. These variations in the partial pressure of CO2 have speciﬁc
6.7

577

distributions for the arctic seas. For instance, the Norwegian Sea and Bering Sea
have CO2 deﬁcits of 18–54 and 33–69 ppm, respectively. The average CO2 deﬁcit
reaches 450 gC m−2. The ﬂow H3 changes between 1.5 and 4.1 gC m−2day−1. In
addition, linear correlations between the partial pressure of CO2 and the water
temperature T are observed, with a proportionality coefﬁcient equal to 9.8 ppm/°C.
The problem of the greenhouse effect is discussed by many authors within the
framework of different anthropogenic scenarios. The main conclusion is that global
climate change brought about through CO2 dynamics, will be insigniﬁcant during
next century if:
(1) the World Ocean pollution, especially by oil products, does not exceed the
level of 1990 by 10 %;
(2) agricultural land areas do not expand at the expense of forests;
(3) the rate of fossil fuel consumption remains at the level of 1990 with a dis-
persion of 15 %; and
(4) alternative energy sources (atomic, wind, etc.) are developed at a rate which
does not hinder the food production.
The role of soil-plant formation for the absorption of excess atmospheric carbon
dioxide under the above scenario is estimated with the data displayed in a geo-
graphic grid of 4° × 5° lat/long (Fig. 6.9 and Table 6.2). The role of the World
Ocean is considered by taking into account the water temperature in the surface
layer. It has been shown that the atmospheric CO2 concentration can reach a mixing
level of 556.7 ppm during the 21st century. The dynamics of industrial CO2 dis-
tribution between the atmosphere, oceans and vegetation will ﬂuctuate with an
amplitude less than 25 %. With an increase in industrial CO2 emission over the
period from 1990 to 2090, the atmospheric portion will rise and the contribution of
the oceans to its absorption will increase; whereas that of the biota will stabilize
after going through a small maximum. At the end of the 21st century and beginning
of the 22nd century, during the highest level of human economic activity, the
contribution of the oceans (especially the Arctic Basin) to industrial CO2 absorption
will be considerably higher than that of vegetation. This is due to the fact that, with
an increase in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, the ability of the upper ocean
layers to absorb industrial CO2 will be supported by the transformation of bio-
geochemical processes in the deep ocean layers. The restoration of plant cover and
ocean pollution are the main short-time problems (Watson et al. 2000). For
example, it was shown that if the natural/disturbed land relation will change from 2/
3 in 1990 to 3/2 in 2050 then the atmospheric CO2 concentration would reach no
more 497.3 ppm during the 21st century. This illustrates that the role of the bio-
spheric system in global change needs to be investigated more thoroughly
(Table 6.23).
Simulation results show that there is an overall exaggeration of the importance of
the problem of global climate change caused by anthropogenic CO2 emissions.
Thus, the existing arguments for climate change are not reliable. It is necessary to
develop the GSM by inserting new correlations between the elements of the NSS
and taking into account the biotic regulation processes.

The Arctic Environmental Problems

This study showed that the role of the Arctic Ocean in the global CO2 balance was
estimated with low precision. Therefore, the Kyoto Protocol reﬂecting the problems
of climate warming via emission of greenhouse gases suffers from a lack of objective
reasons. In fact, existing climate models do not reliably reﬂect the correlation of
global temperature with anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. These models
do not take into consideration the role of biospheric processes in the land and oceans
(biotic regulation of the environment and the functioning of the ocean chemical
system). The Millennium Ecosystems Assessment Program can solve the problem of
global model synthesis in order to obtain forecasts of the dynamics of the NSS.
A summary of existing simulations of the global carbon dioxide cycle shows the
existence of long-term studies concerning this problem. The main conclusion is that
the exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and biosphere has spotty spatial
characteristics. This spottiness, taken into account in the models of the carbon
dioxide cycle, produces high errors. That is why the Kyoto Protocol conclusions
were based on incomplete estimations. There are many carbon ﬂows (natural and
anthropogenic), mentioned in Fig. 1.30, which have not been satisfactorily
described parametrically. The principal key questions relating to the exchange of
carbon between the atmosphere and the terrestrial pool of the above-ground bio-
mass, below-ground biomass, soils and hydrospheric systems are discussed by
Watson et al. (2000), Wigley and Schimel (2005), Emerson and Hedges (2008).
The Arctic Basin is the most weakly studied part of the biosphere in order to
understand its global role in the CO2 absorption processes. Figure 6.26 demon-
strates the high variability in the forecasting of the carbon dioxide dynamics under
different anthropogenic scenarios:
(1) the pessimistic scenario of Keeling and Bacastow (1977) describes a situation
where the ocean’s role in the carbon exchange with the atmosphere is
restricted only to physical processes;
(2) the optimistic scenario of Bjorkstrom (1979) takes into account the ocean-
carbonate system under the parameterization of the H2 and H3 ﬂows in Fig. 1.30;
(3) the scenario of the IPCC, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Watson
et al. 2000), is based on speciﬁc activity requirements concerning land-use
strategy (e.g. planting versus regeneration through silvicultural activities); and

(4) the realistic scenario of Kondratyev (1999) foresees the existing tendencies in
the world’s energetic, demographic and urbanization processes. This scenario
is realized by the GSM (Krapivin 1993; Kondratyev and Krapivin 2001c, d).
It is obvious that in the framework of the third scenario a greenhouse effect via
CO2 is problematic. To estimate the dynamic of the atmospheric temperature
dependence on carbon dioxide it is necessary to use a correlation describing the
greenhouse effect. There are many various empirical functional representations of
the warming effects. Simple correlations
(see (5.3) and (5.4)) approximate the
existing empirical dependence of the atmospheric temperature deviation DTCO2
upon the variations in the atmospheric carbon dioxide parameter X = Ca(t)/
Ca(1900). One of them is:
DTCO2 ¼

ð
Þ
f
g when X  1;
¼ 2:63X2 þ 6:27X þ 1:509 ln X  3:988 when X\1

Finally, according to the GSM calculations, future emissions of CO2 will commit
Earth to a warm-up by 0.2–1.3 °C. These variations in DTCO2 depend upon the
assumptions about the intensity of the urbanization process and about land-use
strategy. The calculation results show that the dynamics of industrial CO2 distri-
bution between the atmosphere and oceans changes with the increasing prepon-
derance of ﬂows H3 in the northern water areas. At the end of the 21st century and
beginning of the 22nd century, during the highest pressure of human economic
activity, the contribution of the oceans to industrial CO2 absorption will be con-
siderably lower than that of vegetation. This is due to the fact that, with an increase
in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, the partial pressure in the oceans rises and
its ability to absorb industrial CO2 decreases, whereas the productivity of vegetation
does not fall. By the end of the 22nd century, with a projected decrease in human
impact, the contribution of the oceans increases due to the growing role of its deep

layers. The atmospheric CO2 will decrease at the same rate as the contribution of
the oceans increases.
The entire area of the Arctic Ocean is only 3.8 % of the world’s ocean surface
but its role in the carbon dioxide absorption varies from 23 to 38 % (16.7–
28.9 GtC year−1). This role is greatly inﬂuenced by seasonal variations in the ice
cover and in the ecosystem productivity. That is why the results of this study have a
preliminary character. It is necessary to continue the closer deﬁnition of the para-
metrical descriptions of ﬂows HC
i
from Fig. 1.30. The authors of this book
understand that policy-oriented computer tools aimed at supporting decision
making processes related to global change, require the design of a new method-
ology in global modeling, based on simulation models with detailed spatial
descriptions of the biosphere systems and with operative informational service
deﬁning the parameters.
It is clear that the Arctic Basin role in climate change is more complex than was
represented. There exist many informational uncertainties related to the permafrost,
methane emissions to the atmosphere. Further development of global information-
modeling system lies in the modernization of the GSM by means of detailed
elaboration of its blocks especially that parameterize the cycles of greenhouse
gases. As example, Figs. 6.27 and 6.28 represent more detailed schemes for bio-
geochemical cycles of CO2 and CH4.

land system. The CO2 reservoirs and ﬂuxes are listed in Table 6.24

As it is concluded from Table 6.24, where existing evaluations of carbon res-
ervoirs and ﬂuxes are given, all carbon pools and ﬂuxes are divided by categories.
Model of global biogeochemical carbon cycle is to account these reservoirs and to
describe ﬂuxes between them. It is evident, that existing environmental databases
and knowledge can not deliver detail input information for this model about the role
of every plant, animal or microbe, every photosynthesizing leaf or algae, every
oceanic aquatory, lake, pond and puddle, every landscape, etc. Figure 6.28 deﬁnes
some level of carbon cycle complexity and gives the possibility to describe it on
restricted spatial and object level, focusing only on the processes that are most
important at the regional or global scale. Unfortunately, series of carbon ﬂuxes have
very approximative assessments including, for example, ﬂuxes F3 and F26. In
accordance with this, spatial structure of carbon cycle depends on the information
that characterizes regional and global databases on the soil-plant formations and
oceans.
Spatial ecology proposes different fragmentations of the land ecosystems and
oceanic aquatories. Spatial distribution of soil-plant formations is characterized by
series of geographical grids. For example, soil geographical databases of Europe
and Canada are characterized by scale 1:1.000.000. Such databases of many
countries are formed on the principle of typical landscapes distinguishing agricul-
tural, forested, economic and other types. New harmonized global soil database of
FAO covers over 15,000 different units of soil mapping that combine existing
regional and national updates of soil information worldwide in framework of
1:5,000,000 scale. Existing global GIS datasets are the most acceptable for the
synthesis of global carbon cycle model.

The interaction between carbon reservoirs—the atmosphere, land pixels Ξij and
ocean aquatories Ωsk—is expressed by carbon ﬂuxes formed through ecological,
geophysical, and biogeochemical processes, including photosynthesis, respiration,
decomposition, burning, volcanic emanations, rock weathering, etc. Detailed
description of these processes and their parameterization are given by Kondratyev
(2000b), Kondratyev et al. (2003a), Krapivin and Varotsos (2008), Wigley and
Schimel (2005), Hanson et al. (2000) and Archer (2010). Some of them are to be
corrected and deﬁned more precisely.
Methane ﬂuxes Ci (i = 1–13) are functions of temperature, microbial population,
geographical coordinates and other environmental characteristics that are speciﬁc
for pixels Ξij. For example, Panikov and Dedysh (2000) developed the model for
methane emission to the atmosphere from snow-covered bogs in West Siberia. This
approach can be used for the modeling of anaerobic formation of CH4 in pixels with
the permafrost. In this case ﬂux C8 can be described by the equation:

rates. Fluxes C1 and C2 that characterize major atmospheric CH4 sinks are mainly
parameterized by its reaction with hydroxyl (OH) radical. These ﬂuxes depend on
the OH levels and reaction rate. Under this, it is known that increase in methane
leads to positive feedback (Xu et al. 2007; Krapivin and Varotsos 2008).
The scheme of Fig. 6.27 is realized by global carbon cycle model (GCCM)
blocks of which are characterized in Fig. 6.29 and Table 6.25. Many of the GCCM
blocks have form of coupled set of time-dependent advection, diffusion, and
reaction equations. Set of theoretical and empirical models for the carbon ﬂuxes of
Fig. 6.27 are realized by speciﬁc blocks, represented in Fig. 1.30. (Kondratyev et al.

6.8 Conclusion
As it was mentioned above, there exist many implementation plans for an assess-
ment of the consequences of climate variability and change and the effects of
increased anthropogenic activity in the Arctic Region. The Arctic’s sea ice is a
major driver of global weather systems. The light surface of the ice reﬂects solar
energy away from the Earth and acts as a natural refrigerator for the planet. Ice and
melt water from the Arctic Ocean have profound affects on ocean circulation pattern
on the North Atlantic, and from there to ocean and other climate systems over the
entire planet (ACIA 2000).
Unfortunately, many authors evolving the most sophisticated analysis make
untimely conclusions about total melting the Arctic’s sea ice. Really there exist
numerous inverse mechanisms that control complex effects of different natural sub-
systems on air and ocean circulation, clouds and precipitation stabilizing regional
and global biosphere-climate system. Therefore, only coupled models can help to
evaluate the evolution of this system. The TOPAZ model system is one of them. It
is an operational real time ocean modeling and forecasting system for the North

Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean. This model provides 10 days sea ice forecasts for the
Arctic and adjacent seas in addition to 3-D oceanographic ﬁelds. The TOPAZ
system produces maps with 20–25 km resolution of sea surface temperature, ice
concentration and ice thickness on regular bases.
Arctic Basin study is the subject of many national and international scientiﬁc
programs. For example, the IBCAO project has received wide recognition and
acceptance on account of the excellence of its output, and it has been gratifying to
see increasing references to IBCAO as an important adjunct to scientiﬁc research in
the Arctic. The IBCAO continues to be the most popular of the International
Bathymetric Charts projects hosted at NGDC.
The NASA Cold Land Processes Working Group (CLPWG) proposed to
coordinate implementation of a tiered system for monitoring the Pan Arctic
dynamics of the terrestrial snowpack, particularly in regards to its effects on fresh
water supply to the Arctic Basin and its signiﬁcant coupling to the atmosphere. The
system of monitoring Arctic terrestrial snow includes three categories of ground
measurements: long-term research areas, ﬁeld campaigns associated with the IPY,
and cooperative measurements by educational institutions.
Key aspects of the Arctic Basin study in its evolution are climate predictions.
Unfortunately, considerable uncertainties exist in this area. Many authors try to
develop numerical models based on the past climate reconstructions. It is clear that
main goal is to be the development of a realistic Earth System model that includes
all the relevant components of the climate system (atmosphere, ocean, land-bio-
sphere, oceanic carbon cycle, cryosphere). In this aspect, because of limited com-
puter resources, conventional studies often neglect or do not formulate sufﬁciently
certain climate components (Rawlins et al. 2005). Solution of this problem lies in
the use of coupled small-scale models (Bartsev et al. 2003; Degermendzhi et al.
2009). Luus et al. (2013) shown that snow outset and melt processes play important
role in arctic climate change through the Arctic net ecosystem exchange of CO2
between the land and the atmosphere. The model developed by Luus et al. (2013)
can considered as small-scale model for estimation of the net ecosystem exchange.
This model is based on satellite data delivered by Landsat and MODIS.
The key role of the soil-plants and the World Ocean in the formation of the
carbon cycle can be assessed by means of the GCCM that allows the realization of
different scenarios with the reconstruction of soil-plant formations or the World
Ocean pollution. Spatial resolution of distribution of soil-plant formations can be
change without the model reconstruction.
Unfortunately, geographical grid 4° × 5° is very rough for the consideration of
scenarios with more detailed changes in the structure of vegetation cover, including
agriculture ﬁelds. Therefore, the GCCM modernization is needed, taking into
consideration of spatial grids 1° × 1°, 0.5° × 0.5° and 1 km × 1 km. In this case,
additional blocks are formed for the parameterization of many carbon ﬂuxes in
Fig. 6.28 basing on the satellite data concerning the vegetation indices such as
NDVI. But there exist regions where speciﬁc information is needed. One of these
regions is cryotic soils (permafrost) where the carbon and methane exchange pro-
cesses strongly depend on the climate change. Variety of geophysical, geochemical

and ecological processes in permafrost complicates an adequate choice model for
these processes to be parameterized. It is known that in a periglacial environment
the effects of freezing and thawing modify drastically the ground surface and
change the gas exchange between the atmosphere and land. All these aspects
suggest the necessity to develop detailed GIS maps for regions with permafrost
(Polischuk and Polischuk 2013).
There, exist an other unsolved task connected with a link between cosmic dust
and climate change. It is known that 100–300 tons of cosmic dust enters the
atmosphere each day. It is needed to understand how this dust impacts on global
biogeochemical cycles (Ehrenfreund and Spaans 2008).

Tropical Cyclogenesis and Ecoinformatics
Methods
7.1 Introduction
Undoubtedly, the state of the ocean-atmosphere system (OAS) plays an important
role in the life of many countries. For instance, the tropical cyclones as hazardous
state of the OAS occupy a speciﬁc position on the potential damages caused by
hurricanes, where the risks for economic losses and victims are very high. So,
hurricanes, as the ﬁnal phase of the tropical cyclone, pose a serious threat to many
countries in both economic and human terms. That is why the problem of the
prediction of the start, the motion and the intensity of a tropical cyclone is important
for the solution of the problem of tropical cyclones.
It has been considered that the tropical cyclogenesis is linked to speciﬁc solar
processes. For instance, the ﬂuctuations of the ﬂow of galactic cosmic rays were
found to be in phase with ﬂuctuations in the vertical temperature proﬁle of the
atmosphere initiating tropical cyclones (Callaghan and Power 2011; Bondur et al.
2009; Bondur and Krapivin 2014; Enz 2006; Stauffer and Aharony 1994). Very
recently, an out of phase relationship between hurricane activity and the 11-year
solar cycle have been noticed (Elsner et al. 2010). The latter revealed that this
opposite correlation is not caused by the solar and cosmic variations, but instead, by
the ﬂuctuations of the solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation (Kondratyev and Varotsos
1996; Varotsos 2005).
It should be therefore of great importance to investigate the phenomenon of the
tropical hurricanes from its initial stages of its formation, in order to go further to its
prediction. The development of satellite and other observational methods resulted in
the routine observational analysis of the parameters that describe the start of the
tropical hurricanes and their evolution in the early stages, thus allowing the reduction
of risks of this dangerous natural phenomenon (Cracknell and Varotsos 2007;
Soldatov et al. 2011; Nitu et al. 2013a, b; Krapivin et al. 2007b; Topics Geo 2003–
2008). In this context, the satellite passive microwave radiometric methods serve as
an important tool for the determination of oceanographic and meteorological

parameters, that depict the inﬂuence of energy exchange between the sub-systems of
the OAS, such as the water surface temperature, wind speed, total water vapor content
in the atmosphere, integral content of liquid water in clouds, as well as the vertical
turbulent ﬂuxes of heat, which are especially important in studies of cyclonic ﬁelds of
the ocean. The satellite observations can also give indirect information about the
processes in the ocean column from its bottom, which are invisible for means of direct
remote sensing (Fedorov and Ginsburg 1988).
The goal of many studies is to develop technologies of diagnostics of the tropical
hurricane origin in ocean zones, which are regular sources of the hurricane gen-
eration on the basis of the passive microwave radiometric observations conducted
by satellites, vessels, buoys and mathematical modeling data of the OAS behavior
at different stages, notably (Krapivin 2010; Kondratyev et al. 2006a, b; Krapivin
and Shutko 2012; Soldatov et al. 2011; Krapivin and Kondratyev 2002):
(a) the stage preceding the tropical hurricane appearance;
(b) the tropical hurricane appearance; and
(c) the stage of the OAS relaxation after the tropical hurricane appearance.
Soldatov et al. (2010) have recently proposed a new technology for the OAS
diagnostics based on the calculation of the instability indicator. The solution to the
problem related to the investigation of indicator-precursor for the tropical hurricane
origin is associated with the assessment of the OAS state and with the peculiar
states of the system at the time of the commencement of its phase transition. Basic
phases of the OAS are determined by the Safﬁr-Simpson scale which classiﬁes
hurricanes into ﬁve categories according to their intensity (http://www.nhc.noaa.
gov/aboutsshws.php).
It has long been recognized that the environmental changes that are associated
with the OAS evolution, have all stochastic character (Abu-Zaid and Ahmadi 1989;
Mees et al. 1997), as numerous other natural catastrophes that are distinguished
between them only by the environmental parameters that affect their start (Calla-
ghan and Power 2011). In connection to this, the indicator-precursors may be
investigated only by means of the analytical relationships that describes the func-
tioning of the global climate system. An illustrative example is the employment of
the conventional Boolean algebra algorithm and baroclinic models for the fore-
casting of the tropical cyclone motion (Kondratyev and Krapivin 2005a, b, 2006;
Tang et al. 2005; Zhou and Chen 2006).
7.2 Ocean-Atmosphere System Phases
Understanding the ocean-atmosphere interaction is critical for predicting changes in
global temperature patterns and climate variability with global warming as well as
the prediction of beginning the tropical cyclones. Ocean-atmosphere coupling is a
concept of climate dynamics essential for understanding a large number of climate
phenomena including the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and climate

variability on multi-decadal timescales. Heat exchange between the ocean and the
atmosphere (heat ﬂuxes), atmospheric circulation and hence the effect of winds on
the ocean surface (wind stress) and a large-scale anomaly of sea surface temperature
are principal areas of investigations based on the numerous observations and
models.
Ocean-atmosphere coupling in different latitudes remains a subject of intense
research and even heated debate. Climate variability is determined to a large extent
by random atmospheric variability, also known as the atmospheric “noise,” and
passive oceanic response to the atmospheric forcing. Numerous efforts to param-
eterize the ocean-atmosphere interactions within different aspects of simulation
modeling did not give some successful results. The main difﬁculties arising in the
solution of tasks are caused by instability of the ocean-atmosphere system (OAS).
For this reason, Soldatov (2009a, b) proposed a new approach to the study of the
ocean-atmosphere interactions considering the state of this system as the assembly
of its phases.
There exist scales that classify the OAS states. The most known of them are
Safﬁr-Simpson Hurricane scale, Beaufort scale and Fujita-Pearson scale.
Safﬁr-Simpson scale was developed in 1971 by civil engineer Herbert Safﬁr and
meteorologist Bob Simpson, who at the time was director of the U.S. National
Hurricane Center (NHC). This scale is a classiﬁcation used for some Western
Hemisphere tropical cyclones that exceed the intensities of tropical depressions and
tropical storms. The scale divides hurricanes into ﬁve categories distinguished by
the intensities of their sustained winds. To be classiﬁed as a hurricane, a tropical
cyclone must have maximum sustained winds of at least 74 mph (33 m/s; 64 kn;
119 km/h). The highest classiﬁcation in the scale, Category 5, is reserved for storms
with winds exceeding 155 mph (69 m/s; 135 kn; 249 km/h). Really there exist two
additional categories that correspond to storm and depression (Table 7.1).
The Beaufort scale (Table 7.2) is an empirical measure of describing wind speed
based mainly on observed sea conditions. The scale was created in 1806 by Sir
Francis Beaufort, an Irish-born British admiral and hydrographer. The Beaufort scale
was extended in 1946, when Forces 13–17 were added. However, Forces 13–17 were

intended to apply only to special cases, such as tropical cyclones. Nowadays, the
extended scale is only used in Taiwan and mainland China, which are often affected
by typhoons. Wind speed on the 1946 Beaufort scale is based on the empirical
formula:
v ¼ 0:837B3=2 m=s
where v is the equivalent wind speed at 10 m above the sea surface and B is
Beaufort scale number. For example, B = 9.5 is related to 24.5 m/s which is equal to
the lower limit of “10 Beaufort”. Using this formula the highest winds in hurricanes
would be 23 in the scale.
Today, hurricane force winds are sometimes described as Beaufort scale 12
through 16, very roughly related to the respective category speeds of the Safﬁr-
Simpson Hurricane Scale, by which actual hurricanes are measured, where Cate-
gory 1 is equivalent to Beaufort 12. However, the extended Beaufort numbers
above 13 do not match the Safﬁr-Simpson Scale. Category 1 tornadoes on the Fujita
and TORRO (TORnado and storm Research Organization) scales also begin
roughly at the end of level 12 of the Beaufort scale but are indeed independent
scales. The TORRO scale (or T-Scale) is a scale measuring tornado intensity
between T0 and T11. It was developed by Meaden (1985) of the TORRO a

In most cases, tornado intensity is measured by the Fujita-Pearson scale
(Table 7.4) that really reﬂects the risk level. It is important to know when and how
the tornado origins. It is known that many tornadoes have their origin as the product
of a tropical hurricane. Therefore, the information about conditions of tropical
hurricane beginning and its tracing are principal stages to predict the tornado origin.

The solution of the tasks arisen here depends on data that have different origin. The
scale allows a tornado’s wind speed to be determined by various means:
• visiting the tornado damage site to make non-engineering assessments;
• obtaining an engineering assessment of the damage;
• using Doppler radar;
• applying photogrammetric analysis; and
• directly measuring observed tornadoes.
Whose solution permits us to forecast the hurricane origin and prognosis of its
category.
7.3 Tropical Cyclone as Dynamic Category
of the Environmental Phenomena
Tropical cyclone refers to the category of natural disasters the origin and evolution
of which does not depend on the human. Walker (2003) and Grigoriev and
Kondratyev (2001) noted that number of natural catastrophes increased during last
time. For example, up to 1990 during all of foregoing 30 years more thousand
tornadoes was registered in USA only in 1973 but this level is exceeded during last
time regularly.
Unstable atmospheric systems (tornadoes and hurricanes) have large destructive
power but they differ on origin, frequency and spatial scales. Only on the USA
territory, 10–15 hurricanes and 1,000–1,200 tornadoes are beginning during a year.
Ahurricane can cover a space up to 2,000 km whereas a tornado has a moving band
no more than 4 km (Figs. 7.1 and 7.2). Some statistics given in Figs. 7.3, 7.4 and
Table 7.5 shows how the number of natural catastrophes changes and the conse-
quences arisen from them.
Thereby, many authors associate the natural catastrophenatural notion with the
notion of ecological security. This is arisen in connection with the necessity of
danger assessment for population of some territory that can lose health, buildings or
property because of the environment change. These changes can be caused by
natural or anthropogenic reasons. In the ﬁrst case, dangerous origins due to ﬂuc-
tuations of natural processes connected with synoptic changes, epidemic occur-
rence, or natural hazard. In the second case, risk originates from a nature reaction on
human actions. For example, Gardner (2002) analyzed environmental changes in
the Himalayas on Indian territory and came to the conclusion that such facts as
deforestation and vegetation cover change were stimulus and intensiﬁers of insta-
bilities in this region. This is characterized by degradation of soil resources and
increase of consequences from ﬂoods.
Historic knowledge about consequences of tropical cyclones practically is absent.
It is obstacle to determine a correlation between tropical cyclones and other natural
processes. There exists fragmentary information about separate episodes of tropical

hurricanes. For example, intense tropical hurricane which was in June 1502 between
Puerto Rico and Hispanola, as described by Christopher Columbus, destroyed 21
ships and killed about 500 seamen. The presence of such fragmentary data about
tropical hurricanes is a subject for discussion of many experts in the ﬁeld of mete-
orology about the possibility to reconstruct the correlation between climate change
and intensity of hurricanes. Such efforts are made, for instance, by studing sediments
in the USA coastal waters which were delivered during the past 1,000 years by
hurricanes (Liu and Fearn 1993; Plumlee et al. 2006).

events. But they, certainly, played important role as geomorphic factors in coastal
zone change as well as ecological factors in disturbance of ecosystems and in
change of their evolution. Many authors (Dunion and Velden 2004; Fink et al.
2010; Wong 2005; DeMaria et al. 2005; Peng et al. 2012) mention clear correlation
between the end of the 20-years drought cycle in the Sahara that was observed from
1989, and increase in intensity of hurricanes in the North Atlantic Ocean. In par-
ticular, well mixed dry adiabatic air layer with high content of mineral dust is
formed above Sahara and Northern Africa and moving in western direction and
under the moving off coast is impacted with cold and humid air above ocean
surface. This process is observed very well by infrared sensors of GOES which has
detected that when air layer above Sahara achieves a zone where tropical cyclone is
born, relative decrease on its activity is observed. Certainly, these correlations have
to be studied in the future.
Fink et al. (2010) determined the existence of seasonal correlation between
activity of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean and precipitations in Western
Africa. Under this, it is marked its instable character and certain variability in years
of high water temperature. In common, rate of number of tropical disturbances in
different active zones of the World Ocean has irregular distribution (Fig. 7.5). On
the whole, more 54 % of tropical disturbances are formed in the Paciﬁc Ocean. In
general, the global average temperature ﬂuctuates over recent time dramatically.
Figure 7.6 shows trends of the annual atmospheric temperature anomalies for 1880–
2012. Present temperature anomaly trend mainly is deﬁned by the oceans that store
about 90 % of the additional heat. The oceans are warming up what implies that the
Earth must absorb more solar energy than longwave radiation that emits into space.
The atmosphere stores only about 2 % because of its small heat capacity. Heat
content of the World Ocean during last years has changed from about 1.05 × 1022 J
in 1990 to 17.67 × 1022 J in 2013.
Figure 7.7 shows temporal sets for global number of tropical cyclones and storm
days. It is known that there exists a ten-day oscillation in storm days. Figure 7.8
represents data about annual frequency and duration of hurricanes during 35 years.

hurricanes of 1st category remained nearly identical but monotonically decreased as
percent of total number of hurricanes. The trend of sum of hurricanes of 2nd and 3th
categories is small both by amount and by their duration. As opposed to this, the
number of hurricanes 4th and 5th category increased from 31 for 2000–2004 to 36
for 2005–2009. These changes took place in all oceanic basins (Table 7.6), but they
have unstable character.
Tropical cyclones take place mainly in latitudes 5°N–25°N and regularly impact
on USA (states Florida, Texas, Louisiana), Caribbean Sea, Mexico, Japan, China,
Philippines, Korea, Indonesia, Russian East, India, Madagascar, Mauritius,
Reunion, Australia, etc. Global zone of hurricanes (typhoons) cover tropical oceans
between the parallels 40°S and 40°N (Fig. 4.11). In this vast zone, the frequency of
tropical cyclones is distributed non-uniformly. Consequently, losses from tropical
cyclones have inhomogeneous distribution (Fig. 7.10).
7.4 Monitoring Data
The existing global Earth-observing system includes several levels of measuring
sub-systems. The Global Observation Earth System of Systems (GEOSS) is the
base of present monitoring of the ocean-atmosphere system (Charvat et al. 2010).
GEOSS is built by the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) on the basis of a 10-
Year Implementation Plan running from 2005 to 2015 (Klien 2008). Earth obser-
vations include measurements and monitoring of the Earth under water, on the land
surface and beneath, air and water quality atmospheric conditions, and measures of
the health of humans, plants and animals. Measurements can be made by sensors in
contact or remotely, and all these observations support modeling or other tools that
create information for environmental decision-making.

Global Change Observation Mission (GCOM) directly relates to retrieval
algorithms for geophysical products, product validation, and data application.
GCOM seeks to establish and demonstrate a global, long-term satellite observing
system. Essential geophysical parameters have to be measured for understanding
the global climate change and water cycle mechanism, and eventually contribute to
improving future climate projection through a collaborative framework with climate
model institutions. Demonstrating capabilities of operational applications providing
continuous data to operational agencies is another important purpose. GCOM will
take over the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite-II (ADEOS-II) mission and
transition into long-term monitoring of the Earth. GCOM will consist of two
satellite types and three consecutive generations with a one-year overlap, resulting
in over a 13-year observation period in order to achieve a global, comprehensive,
long-term, and homogeneous observation. The two satellites are GCOM-W and
GCOM-C (Climate). The GCOM-W1 satellite will carry the Advanced Microwave
Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR2) to contribute to understanding the water and
energy cycle. The GCOM-C1 satellite will be equipped with the Second-generation
Global Imager (SGLI) to observe the Earth’s atmosphere and surface for contrib-
uting to the understanding of the carbon cycle and radiation budget (GCOM 2008).
There are numerous data sources about the atmospheric and oceanic processes
which can be used for the decision making related to the OSE state. The basic
purposes of the most of global Earth observing systems consist in the predicting
climate change. For realistic prediction of climate change, these data and oceanic
and atmospheric models must be coupled. It is evident that oceanic processes exert
a major inﬂuence on climate. Moreover, sea-surface temperature determines the
heat exchange between the atmosphere and oceans. In order to assess the OSE state,
results from different Earth observing systems and general circulation models have
to be processed. According to Cracknell et al. (2009), the OSE state is characterized
by instable dynamics of its components and therefore it is impossible to use
monitoring data because of their temporal incompleteness. In this sense, data of
numerous meteorological stations such as The Tropical Atmosphere Ocean/TRI-
angle Trans-Ocean buoy Network & PIlot Research moored Array in the Tropical
Atlantic/Research moored Array for Monsoon Analysis (TAO/TRITON&PIRATA/
RAMA) are more acceptable (Fig. 7.11).
The Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) and Global Ocean Observing
System (GOOS) (Fig. 7.12 and Table 7.7) deliver large amounts of archive and
operative data about different environmental characteristics on a global basis. TAO/
TRITON/PIRATA/RAMA is one efﬁcient sub-system of these systems. Namely,
the data of this sub-system are the most precise and informative.
Table 7.8 describes the data that are employed in this study. More precisely this
data set is based on the archived data of the TAO/TRITON&PIRATA system for the
months of hurricane activity. The basic goal of the data processing is to search for a
procedure and a criterion to determine with high probability the time at which the
hurricane arises and the conditions that precede that event. The tropical moored
buoys that deliver many data about different meteorological and geophysical char-
acteristics of the ocean-atmosphere system are located in the Paciﬁc and Atlantic

Oceans. The most densely spaced meteorological stations are in the tropical sector of
the Atlantic Ocean near the U.S. State of Florida. An assessment of the algorithm that
is proposed in this paper is accomplished by means of a choice of such meteoro-
logical stations that are located close to the equator, where severe hurricanes are
registered by the existing monitoring systems. To this end, the standard meteoro-
logical data of meteorological stations of the U.S. National Data Buoy Center were
also used.
The introduction of the characteristic IΩ in (3.37) and (3.38) facilitates the design
of the monitoring scheme and the prediction of the OAS phase transition. Fig-
ure 7.13 illustrates a possible structure of the monitoring system with functions of
the investigation, forecast, and tracing these processes (Krapivin et al. 2012b).
Thus, the system has three levels: ﬁxing, decision making and investigation. The
corresponding units have the following functions:

(1) Control of the environmental elements and collection of their data at the state
of interest in the regime allowed by the applied technical means.
(2) Identiﬁcation of the candidate (suspicious) environmental elements and the
value of their indicator RΩ(t) corresponding to the interval of a given type of
natural anomaly.
(3) Development of the dynamic series {IΩ(t)} for a suspicious element to make a
statistical decision on its noise and signal character. In the latter case, we
check the suspicious element by criteria of the next level of accuracy
(including the vector {xi} into the cluster, etc.).
(4) Making the ﬁnal decision about the approach of the moment of the origin of
change in the OAS state and delivering of the information to the responsible
services for the environmental control.
The efﬁciency of the above discussed monitoring system depends on the
parameters of the measuring means and the algorithms of the observational data
processing. The model of the environment used herewith in parallel with the for-
mation and statistical analysis of the series RΩ(t) and adapted to the monitoring
regime in correspondence with the scheme in Fig. 7.13 plays an important role.

From the above-introduced criterion for the approach of the OAS phase change,
it is clear that the form and behavior of IΩ(t) are characteristic of each type of the
process that is taking place in the OAS environment. One of the complex problems
consists in determination of these forms and their corresponding classiﬁcation. For
instance, the dangerous natural phenomena, such as landslides and mudﬂows, have
characteristic indicators of preliminary changes of relief and landscape. These are
recorded from satellites (in the optical band) and together with the data of aircraft
survey and ground measurements of relief slopes, expositions of slopes and state of
hydro-network, are used to predict them several days before their occurrence.
However, in the OAS case, such indicators are lacking. Therefore, it is necessary
to deﬁne the parameter aij as a function of the OAS phase state. This dependence is
the relationship between the OAS indicator instability calculated for i-th and j-th
measuring stations and is expressed as the ratio:
aij ¼ ITðu; ki; tÞ=ITðuj; kj; tÞ
ð7:1Þ
In this case, the main problem is focused on the determination of the informative
space Ω and the formalization of the investigation procedure in the monitoring
system (Fig. 7.13). This procedure has the following scheme. The holder registers
data from sensors and keeps the “suspicious” elements in the memory accordingly
with some algorithm. Decision maker analyses data delivered by holder and decides
what character of these data—it is signal about the start of the OAS phase change or
it is noise. Then, the ﬁnder taking into account the output of the decision maker
localizes the anomaly and starts to coordinate the functions of the holder and
decision maker on the data speciﬁcation for the detected anomaly. Finally, if an
anomaly (suspicion about the OAS phase transition) with duration τ (that is deﬁned
empirically) is detected the decision maker decides about the start of the OAS phase

change. Identiﬁcation of the expectation time τ can be changed by accidental value
of τ using the procedure of sequential analysis where IΩ is compared to thresholds.

time interval, T, is chosen with the successive times {tj; j = 1, …, N} when data on

is hit are colored. Here the value x
i ðtjÞ is the observed value of
the ith parameter in the time tj ∈T. Following percolation procedure (Soldatov
2006, 2007, 2009c; Sukov and Soldatov 2007; Sukov et al. 2008b) we form clusters
by combining the interfacing of colored cells into a unique chain. Parameter λ
denotes the fraction of the total number of cells that are colored and μ is the relative
volume of the cluster space; the distribution of the clusters by their size is assessed.
The cluster space structure depends on the interval T, the choice of which is
determined by the speciﬁc character of the given task. As it follows from the data
processing, parameters λ and μ can achieve their asymptotic levels k and l when
the observations are gathered over a long time. Under this consideration the
character of such a transition between different phase states of the ocean-atmo-
sphere system reﬂects the objective laws of the start of a hurricane. Consequently, a
calculation of percolation cluster parameters for different environmental conditions
of the ocean-atmosphere system functioning gives the possibility of constructing a
decision making rule to assess the moment at which the phase transition in the
ocean-atmosphere system dynamics occurs.

where the parameters γ and ν depend on the cluster space dimension d and in a
particular case are determined empirically. Functions S and ξ deﬁned in the for-
mulae (7.2) increase sharply at the start of a hurricane. By deﬁnition (Essam 1980)
an average number Nt of colored sites in the percolation cluster after numerous steps

where parameter θ ∈[1.29–2.84] is evaluated in each case by means of a modeling

Monitoring Data

The use of TAO/TRITON&PIRATA/RAMA data in the monitoring regime with
the employment of the percolation model is equivalent to the scheme of the point {xi}
walk within the sites of Ξd. In the case d = 2 we consider the wind speed, x2, and the
atmospheric pressure, x9, which are two meteorological parameters that can be
expected to vary very strongly in the presence of a tropical cyclone. In Fig. 7.14 we
plot the hourly values of x2 and x9 for August 2005 during which Hurricane Katrina
formed, developed and dissipated. The random walk of point {xi} in Ξ2(x9,x2) is a
function of a changing meteorological situation that is characterized by the transition
from the background to the state when a tropical hurricane occurs. In this diagram the
existence of the tropical hurricane within the time period T is characterized by a
double percolation transition of the point {x9, x2} through zone N2
2 between zones N1
2
and N3
2. An analysis of the motion of the point {x9, x2} is connected with the
assessment of probability characteristics for the drift of its projection on the direction
η of the zone N2
2 boundaries. The drift ν of this projection from some initial position A
represents the sum Σν of a random number of the components.
The distribution structure of zones in the plane Ξ2 for the Bahamas in August
2005 (Fig. 7.14) has speciﬁc elements bounded by the zone N2

leading to Hurricane Katrina was arising but it was not detected. When

Simpson scale. Moving to the Gulf of Mexico in the direction towards New

Orleans, Louisiana, it reached category 5 on the morning of 28 August and then its
strength decreased slowly until 31 August. Hurricane Katrina passed New Orleans
on 29 August 2005 and by 31 August New Orleans was ﬂooded as result of
Hurricane Katrina. An analysis of meteorological data shows that the ﬁrst signs of
the environmental instability began to originate on 20 August. Consequently, the
interval between 20 and 23 August can be considered as the uncertainty zone (see
Fig. 7.14). Thus, it is necessary to search the indicators of environmental instability
within this zone. Undoubtedly, the value of Δ, the width of zone N2
2, and the
structure of zone N2
2 depend on the hurricane category dynamics. Searching such
dependency is an important task.
Figure 7.15 represents a percolation cluster that was formed in the region of the
Bahamas in August of the 2005 hurricane season. The process of percolation cluster
formation shows that there exists a moment when the ocean-atmosphere system
changes its phase state. This moment is determined by the distances between λ and
λ*, μ and μ*. Simulation of this process has shown that the moment at which this
transition occurs corresponds to the boundary between a storm and a hurricane of
the ﬁrst category. This is not a very acceptable result. Therefore, it is necessary to
introduce an additional indicator.
It can be seen that both percolation cluster sections have the zones of transition
to the inﬁnite cluster but are distinguished by the structural characteristics of the
percolation cluster. Section (x2, x9) has the following parameters: λ* = 0.2, μ* = 0.87
and S = 7.08. Section (x10, x8) is characterized by the parameters λ* = 0.5, μ* = 0.94
and S = 22.5. The zone of the phase transition is deﬁned in each case by the
geometric reduction of the way between two zones of basic cluster each of which
satisﬁes one state of the environment. It is evident that the moment of this reduction

formation corresponds to the hurricane origin. Calculation of the hurricane origin
probability depends on the dynamics of cluster space structure.
To formalize the detection procedure for the beginning of a hurricane we
introduce the algorithm for the assessment of the ocean-atmosphere system insta-

An indicator of the ocean-atmosphere system instability Im(t) deﬁned by the
Eqs. (7.3) and (7.4) characterizes the changeability of the current average value of the
vector {xi}. Figure 7.16 explains the calculation procedure for the ocean-atmosphere
system instability indicator. As it is seen, it is necessary to assess the quasi-stationary
time interval in order to use traditional statistics for the meteorological data pro-
cessing. Analysis of the one-dimensional distributions for selected meteorological
parameters measured by TAO/TRITON&PIRATA showed that this interval is 7 h.
Figure 7.17 gives an example of the calculation of Im(t) for the case of hurricane
Katrina. One can ascertain that the approach of the hurricane origin is accompanied
by the increase of Im(t). In this connection three regions of Im(t) take place:
Indicator represented in Fig. 7.17 was calculated with the following parameters:
s = 17 (see Table 7.8). All environmental parameters take into consideration, βi = 1
(i = 1…17; weight coefﬁcients of environmental parameters are assumed equal),
m = 24 h (time period for the instability indicator calculation equals one day), N = 7
(quasi-stationary time interval for environmental data), K = 31 days (a time period
for the calculation of instability indicator). All parameters were estimated by
numerical experiments to have high reliability within the calculation results.

(1) the region of background characteristics when the ocean-atmosphere system
parameter variations during a restricted time interval is changed in the limits of
statistical stability;
(2) the region of the uncertainty, where the probability of the beginning of a
hurricane exceeds the level 0.5; and
(3) the region of the existence of the hurricane where the velocity of changes of all
parameters {xi} achieve maximal values.
The control of the Im(t) dynamics in the case of Fig. 7.14 with the sequential
analysis shows that in the zone N1
2 E(ν) = 17, D(ν) →0 and Wc(x) →0. At this
time, in the zone N3
2 E(ν) = 9, D(ν) →5, x = ν/D(ν) →1.35, c →16 and
W16(1.35) →0.912. The latter explains the result represented in Fig. 7.18. In other
words, processing from verbal reasoning to a quantitative estimation of the
Im(t) dynamics, we introduce a generalized calibrated scale Ξ, for which we pos-
tulate the presence of relationships of the type Ξ1 < Ξ2, Ξ1 > Ξ2 or Ξ1 = Ξ2. It means
that there always exists a value of Im(t) = ρ which determines when the ocean-
atmosphere system phase transition of a given type can be expected. As a result, the
magnitude h ¼ Im tð Þ  q
j
j determines the expected time interval before the phase
transition occurs.

The region of the sharp increase in the derivative of Im(t) corresponds to the
ocean-atmosphere system phase transition. Consequently, tracing for the meteoro-
logical situation and synchronous calculation of the instability indicator under its
comparison with cluster space structure gives a possibility to detect the moment of
the ocean-atmosphere system transition from background state to the hurricane
origin. Figure 7.17 shows that introduced instability indicator could detect the start
of hurricane Katrina at least 31 h before its detection by satellite. Figure 7.18 shows
Im(t) within the 2005 hurricane season. The behavior of the Im(t) is identical to the
registered hurricane series. Such a result is justiﬁed by the results given in Fig. 7.19
for the case of tropical hurricane Flossie that formed in the eastern sector of the
Paciﬁc Ocean on 8 August and reached Hawaii on 15 August 2007. One can see
that the probabilities of the ocean-atmosphere system transition between its phase
positions are more than 0.7. Results of Figs. 7.20 and 7.21 again corroborate the
indicator information capability. Therefore the indicator Im(t) reﬂects the ocean-
atmosphere system phase structure with high reliability and can be used to predict
the beginning of a hurricane.
Figure 7.22 depicts the results obtained from the calculation of the instability
indicator for the two cases of the hurricanes Isaac and Katrina. The data used were
derived from two NDBC weather stations during August–September of 2012 and
for one NDBC weather station during August of 2005. In Fig. 7.22 the OAS
instability level for different distances between station and cyclone is presented.

Furthermore, in this ﬁgure the value of IT(φ, λ, t) corresponds to the OAS phase
state and illustrates the trend of the cyclone evolution. Therefore, using one of the
prediction algorithms, it is possible to evaluate the probability when stochastic
process IT(φ, λ, t) intersects some threshold. In fact, this task comes to the random
walk control on the plane (IT, t). The solution to this task can be achieved with the
employment of evolutionary method (Krapivin and Shutko 2012; Krapivin and
Varotsos 2007) or the sequential analysis algorithm (Krapivin and Varotsos 2008;
Soldatov 2009a).
The evolutionary method consists of the building of a model that is suitable for a
stochastic process IT(φ, λ, t) under the conditions where the currently available
knowledge does not allow for the development of a mathematical model capable to
describe this process. The sequential analysis algorithm in contradiction to the
Neyman-Pearson criterion does not separate the stages of the data processing, rather
it alternates these stages. This algorithm provides the possibility for a decision
making after each realization of a random process {IT(φ, λ, ti}.
Figure 7.23 demonstrates this possibility for the case of the hurricane Irene in
2011. Inspection of this ﬁgure shows that the instability indicator responds to the
OAS phase transitions with some probability, which depends on the weather station

distance from tropical cyclone location. After the calculation of IT(φ, λ, t), the
sequential algorithm predicted the OAS phase transition from tropical storm to
hurricane of category 1 and category 3 with probabilities 0.86 and 0.91 for 19 and
27 h, respectively. Furthermore, the calculation of IT(φ, λ, t) for each weather
station of the TAO/TRITON/PIRATA/RAMA system will give the possibility to
localize the disturbance process in the OAS of the given region and to start the
monitoring procedure with the calculation of matrix A with corresponding control
of the environment on the area Ω.
In the following, let us consider the period during August of 2012 at the Miami
region taking into consideration the western and eastern areas of the coastal waters.
Table 7.9 gives an example of two matrices A that are calculated using of the data
obtained from separate weather stations that are located in this region. It was found
that in August 20 the OAS phase state was practically identical with variations no
more than 9 %. But at August 26, the OAS instability level varied by more than
45 %. It reveals that the area Ω broke up to two areas—Ω1: eastern zone of Gulf of
Mexico and Ω2: eastern coastal zone of Florida Peninsula (Fig. 7.24).

In addition, the Table 7.9 presents the calculation data for restricted list of
weather stations. It is worth to note that the result obtained is the same with the case
of all weather stations located in the coastal zone of Florida Peninsula taken into
consideration. It is seen that zone Ω1 is the parameter for the subsequent control of
the OAS according to the scheme shown in Fig. 7.14.
7.6 Predicting the Path of a Tropical Cyclone
Storms, hurricanes, and typhoons are examples of natural instability that occurring
in the ocean-atmosphere system and cause catastrophic events connected with
deaths and economic losses. Many authors try to forecast the extreme processes in
the ocean-atmosphere system. To solve this problem, a network of meteorological
stations has been built up including the TAO/TRITON/PIRATA system of buoy
stations. However, forecasting the development of a tropical cyclone is a complex
problem that includes several elements: track forecasting, intensity forecasting,
rainfall forecasting, and storm surge forecasting. Another, possibly even more,
difﬁcult task is the detection of the origin of a tropical cyclone.
The methods used in forecasting tropical cyclones have changed with the pas-
sage of time based on different information sources including satellites. The base of
these methods is the tropical cyclone forecast models of which there are mainly
three types: statistical, dynamical, or combined statistical-dynamic. Such models
utilize meteorological data to calculate paths and intensities only. New forecasting
techniques have been developed during recent years by Soldatov (2009b) in
Fig. 7.24 Instability indicator calculated for August 20, 25 and 27 of 2012 using meteorological
data from separate NDBC weather stations located in the Florida zone

connection with the study of global ecodynamics . Natural disasters on the whole
and tropical cyclones in particular, are considered as interactive components of
global ecodynamics. It may be suggested that the approach we have described could
be considered as giving the possibility of forecasting the beginning of a tropical
cyclone. This approach differs drastically from traditional conceptions. However, to
produce an operational system would require routine processing, in real time, of
vast amounts of data as well as the determination of reliable thresholds to prevent
false alarms. It may then become a question of cost-beneﬁt. In practical terms, given
that it takes quite some time interval between the detection of a cyclone and its
landfall, would there be any practical advantage if we have an extra 12–24 h
warning?
Tropical cyclones are, of course, only one of several major natural disasters
which affect humankind; there are also earthquakes, ﬂoods, ﬁres, volcanic eruptions
and many more. It is, of course, desirable, where possible, to give advance warning
of an impending disaster so that people can take evasive action. An earthquake
strikes suddenly and, as we know, often without speciﬁc warning and a lot of
scientiﬁc research has been devoted to attempting to predict earthquakes. In a sense,
a tropical cyclone strikes suddenly; it comes in from the ocean and its damage is
(mostly) done where and when it reaches the land. But before it makes landfall it
has been tracked for quite a while and it has built up as it has travelled across the
ocean, gathering strength as it goes. The problem is not so much making an initial
prediction but on following the cyclone over a matter of a few days before it makes
landfall and predicting exactly where it will strike the land. The issue is not so much
detecting the start of the typhoon but trying to predict its path accurately in order to
make precise predictions of where and when it will strike the coastline. When it
starts, it has not reached its full strength, it is a severe weather condition that is
revealed by conventional weather forecasting and observation; navigators, at sea or
in the air, can take evasive action. If the study presented is able ultimately to
contribute to detecting a cyclone earlier than it would be detected by conventional
methods that could be very useful. But we are a long way far from being in that
situation yet. Remote sensing has its role to play—and indeed it has a large part in
the tracking of a hurricane and in providing input to models for predicting the path
of a hurricane. From the point of view of humankind, the issue is not to predict or
detect the beginning of a hurricane, but to predict its development and the path that
it will travel. Claims for supposed beneﬁts of remote sensing that are not really
relevant to beneﬁtting mankind only discredit the subject.
Analysis of numerous calculations of Im(t) for different tropical cyclones shown
that if it is calculated at the same time for a large region Ξ basing on data delivered
by meteorological stations and satellites, then Im(φ, λ, t) (φ, λ) ∈Ξ is a two-
dimensional distribution of instability indicator. In this case, sustained splash of the
Im(φ0, λ0, t) t ∈[t1,t2] shows that tropical cyclone is starting in coordinates (φ0, λ0)
and monitoring system is to begin probability control of this zone. Figure 7.25 gives
example of such operation.
Consideration of examples that could show the instability indicator character-
istics is possible only when cyclone track lies in a zone of meteorological stations
620
7
Tropical Cyclogenesis and Ecoinformatics Methods

where standard meteorological data are registered with small time interval. The
zone of meteorological station sensitivity usually varies in the boundary of 100–
500 km.
In connection with this, the case of tropical cyclone Sandy is considered. Fig-
ure 7.26a shows its track from the beginning as tropical depression in the western
Caribbean Sea on October 22, 2012. Sandy moved slowly northward toward the
Greater Antilles and gradually intensiﬁed. Series of the NDBC meteorological
stations that ﬁxed OAS characteristics to calculate Instability Indicators are marked
in Fig. 7.26. As it is seen from Fig. 7.26, tropical cyclone Sandy track, as opposed
to case of Isaac, was mainly ranged from meteorological stations when it had
categories 2 and 3 in Safﬁr-Simpson Scale.
The distance between NDBC-42057 and NDBC-42058 is about 750 km. These
meteorological stations—as it is seen from Fig. 7.26b—had small increased the
Instability Indicator but did not show a transition of the OAS in phase of tropical
depression. Additional use of satellite data (QuickSCAT) about wind characteristics
gives the possibility to ﬁx this phase on October 23 at 20–50 in GMT (Brennan
et al. 2009). Figure 7.27 shows the OAS Instability Indicator dynamics for different
meteorological stations that are given in Fig. 7.26a. We see that Sandy was a
Category 3 storm at its peak intensity on October 25. Then, it became a Category 2
on October 26. Curves in Fig. 7.27 show how Sandy changes its phases moving
toward USA and Canada and how its diameter is increased. For example, minimal

distance NDBC-44001 from Sandy eye was about 600 km but Instability Indicator
reacts on the cyclone passing.
In the United States, Hurricane Sandy affected 24 states, including the entire
eastern seaboard from Florida to Maine and west across the Appalachian Mountains
to Michigan and Wisconsin, with particularly severe damage in New Jersey and
New York. Its storm surge hit New York City on October 29. The OAS Instability
Indicator showed that at this time Sandy diameter was changed from 700 to
900 km. All weather stations actually located on the southeastern coast given the
OAS Instability Indicator jump. Maximal value of the OAS Instability Indicator on
October 29 was at NOAA-ACYN4 and it was moved to the direction of NOAA-
CBL01 where its maximal level was achieved on October 30. Therefore, calcula-
tions of the OAS Instability Indicator for series of weather stations located on given
territory and aquatory gives the possibility to synthesize the cyclone track with
determination of its impact zones.
7.7 Searching the Indicator-Precursors of Tropical
Hurricane Beginning
The solution to the problem related to the search of indicator-precursor for the
tropical hurricane origin is connected with the assessment of the ocean-atmosphere
system (OAS) state and with the revealing situations when this system begins to
change its phase position. It is known that the origin of tropical hurricanes is one of
the displays of the cyclone moving. Basic phases of the OAS are (Mazur and
Ivanov 2004):
• tempest—wind that has velocity 19–23 m/s and corresponds to the 8 balls by the
Beaufort scale;
• storm—strong wind corresponding to more than 9 balls by the Beaufort scale
with wind speed 23–30 m/s; and
• hurricane—12 balls and wind speed is more than 35 m/s.
So far, as all environmental changes connected with this process have stochastic
character, the solution to the problem of the detection of the time moment when
OAS transitions to the origin of storm transformation to the hurricane of ﬁrst
category really needs the chaos modeling, that is the complex problem in his turn
(Mees et al. 1997; Abu-Zaid and Ahmadi 1989). So, it is necessary to take into
consideration the fact that numerous other natural catastrophes are characterized by
the same dynamics, but they differ only by series of environmental parameters that
inﬂuence their beginning. Therefore, the search of laws describing the tropical
hurricane origin needs to analyze other natural phenomena in the atmosphere, and
maybe in the more narrow space. For example, as it follows from study by Bondur
et al. (2008), the processes on the Sun signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the tropical cyclone
beginning, and in general it was determined that there exists a correlation between
7.6
Predicting the Path of a Tropical Cyclone
623

the ﬂow variation of galactic cosmic rays and variations of vertical temperature
proﬁle of the atmosphere. In particular, decrease of the temperature by 9 °C at the
altitude 16 km was detected in the case of Hurricane Katrina as a result of a higher
high-altitude gradient of the temperature being formed and the intensiﬁcation of the
convention taken place. As a result, the warmer atmospheric layers begin to lift up,
causing a temperature rise by 2 °C at the latitudes 5–14 km. This result conﬁrms the
theoretical conclusions received by Sharkov (2003).
There exists the opinion that common global warming stimulates such changes
in the atmosphere circulation that promote to the intensiﬁcation of tropical hurri-
canes. This opinion becomes stronger in connection with 2005 hurricane season
when storms and hurricanes raged at the tropical latitudes. In fact, tropical hurri-
canes of 2005 season functioned as giant heat engines. It was established that
intensity and duration of tropical cyclones during the last 30 years in the North
Atlantic and Western North Paciﬁc were doubled. In connection with this, we can
make the conclusion that the search of the indicator-precursors is realized by means
of the analysis of the relationships in the global climate system functioning. Under
this complex and unstable climate models can not be used. Searching stable cor-
relations in global climate system can be solution of this problem. There is a
demonstrative example of the solution of particular task related to the forecasting of
tropical cyclone motion using a baroclinic model (Zhou and Chen 2006). was
According to Tang et al. (2005) the Boolean algebra algorithm which is widely used
for market basket analysis can be used to analyze the meteorological data sets
characterizing OAS in the zones of possible tropical hurricanes beginning. This
algorithm consists in the formation of binary set that is based on the wind speed
analysis.
Dynamic processes conducting natural phenomena proceed by complex laws
that are not studied a lot as a rule. Nevertheless, there exists the ensemble of
methods which we can mention: the method of Fourier rapid transformation, the
method of maximal entropy, the method of quasi linearization, the method of
evolutionary modeling, the method of harmonic functions, etc. An application of
these methods to search the relationships in the series of meteorological, geo-
physical and ecological data that characterize the zones where tropical hurricanes
arose selecting the time periods that forewent the hurricane beginning can be
productive. In particular, a detection of the speciﬁc features in the natural processes
within the OAS before the tropical hurricane beginning can give mechanism for the
early detection of the moment when OAS will pass from storm state to the phase of
hurricane of the ﬁrst category. Some experience of the solution to problems arising
here is given in the publications by Kondratyev and Krapivin (2005b, 2006),
Krapivin and Potapov (2002, 2006a, b), Potapov et al. (2006), Sukov et al. (2008a),
Grankov et al. (2006), Kondratyev et al. (2006a, b), and Soldatov (2007). This
experience is based on the methods for the analysis of unstable processes, and it is
undertaken as one of the possible approaches to the creation of constructive
algorithms for early detection of the zones where tropical hurricanes could begin.
The history contains rich information about natural disasters which are now
called tropical cyclones and which are mainly formed over the oceans in the tropics,
624
7
Tropical Cyclogenesis and Ecoinformatics Methods

regularly falling onto the eastern and near-equatorial regions of the continents. The
tropical cyclones are hurricanes and typhoons, taking place in the northern and
southern Paciﬁc, in the Bay of Bengal, the Arab Sea, in the southern sector of the
Indian Ocean, near the coast of Madagascar, and the north-western coast of Aus-
tralia. The Atlantic hurricanes form mainly in the zone conﬁned to the coordinates
(10oN–20oN, 20oW–6oW) and (7.5oN–17.5oN, 30oW–100oW). The tropical
cyclones are usually called by names.
The origin of tropical hurricanes are one of displays of the tropical climate
system functioning. Numerous International and National hurricane centers study
this functioning. One of them is the US National Hurricane Center that publishes
reports with a detailed description of each hurricane case describing all phenomena
(speed and direction of the wind, precipitation, etc.) that are going with it. Basic
direction of the studies in these centers is associated with detecting and tracking the
hurricanes that are arisen. Forecasting of the trace for hurricane moving, certainly,
is important to reduce the losses. There exist many models of different complexity
and detail by means of which the efforts are undertaken to predict the hurricane
trajectory, its intensity and precipitation intensity (Gray et al. 1991; Pielke 1999).
Similar investigations are realized in the Canadian Hurricane Center (CHC) or
Atlantic Storm Prediction Centre (ASPC). During the hurricane season forecasters
carefully monitor all storms of tropical origin. When a storm begins to threaten
Canadian waters or land, specially trained meteorologists in the CHC track the
tropical storms and provide guidance to other Canadian storm prediction centers.
They work closely with the US hurricane Centre in Miami as well as municipal,
provincial and federal emergency measures organizations in order to inform the
public of expected conditions.
Forecasters at the ASPC work with many tools and technology to provide fore-
casts and warnings, including: Doppler weather radars, weather satellites, observa-
tions from a network of upper atmosphere and surface monitors, a network of
offshore weather buoys, ship reports, volunteer reports and a variety of computer
model output. The ASPC operates 24 h a day, 365 days a year, which means fore-
casters work day and night shifts as well as holidays. Supercomputer Hurricane
Prediction is used to solve the arising problems. Of course, basic tendency of these
predictions are directed to the assessment of the prospective number of hurricanes
and their intensity but not the direct detection of given hurricane beginning. A
solution to this problem results from the study by Golitsin and Vasiliev (2001), being
possible under the detailed investigation of the conditions when atmospheric con-
vective processes are developed. Under this, regular data ﬂows characterizing the
aquatories with dangerous wind conditions are an obligatory condition for the suc-
cess. It is possible when buoy station and methods of aquatory monitoring by means
of oceanographic satellites are jointly used. These data sources give the possibility to
have narrow observation of the zones where tropical hurricanes can begin.
Origination of the data about wind ﬁelds on the large aquatories is possible with
the radio-locators of side observations giving spatial resolution about 1 km and by
means of radio-locators with synthetic aperture with spatial resolution of 25 m.
Methodical questions of maximal wind speed evaluation basing on the information

Searching the Indicator-Precursors of Tropical Hurricane Beginning

receiving from radio-locators of side observation on the satellites are given by Mur
and Fen (1979).
It is clear that the search of the indicator-predictors of tropical hurricanes is
necessary to perform at the same time together with the study of all atmospheric
processes that happen above the ocean and offshore. A set of these processes
includes tornados, storms, hurricanes, and typhoons. A whirlwind (tornado) is one
of the insidious and sudden natural formations in the atmosphere. It is a rotating
funnel-shaped cloud which stretches from the bottom of the thundercloud to the
Earth’s surface. The characteristic tornado wind speeds are 65–120 km h−1, but
sometimes this magnitude reaches 320 km h−1 and more.
The USA territory is the most characteristic region where tornados are rather
frequent phenomena, though tornados happen all over the world. During the period
1961–2004, over the USA territory, tornados took away the lives of 83 people per
year, on the average. Most often, tornados take place in the eastern states adjacent to
the Gulf of Mexico and in February and March their frequency of occurrence is at a
maximum. On the territories of Iowa and Kansas, tornados are most frequent in May-
June. The average amount of tornados over the USA territory is estimated at *800
per year, 50 % of which falls on April–June. The territorial heterogeneity of the
frequency of occurrence of tornados in the USA has stable characteristics: in Texas—
120 tornados per year, and in the north-eastern and western states—1 tornado/year.
For instance, only in April and November 2002 there were more than 100 tornados
that caused numerous destructions with more than 600 cases of insurance payments.
The element does not spare other countries, too. For instance, the winter hurricane
“Janette” in 2002 over Europe caused numerous destructions and insurance pay-
ments reaching more than 1 billion dollars. For instance, the hurricane Charlie in the
USA in 2004 over the states Florida, Cuba, and Jamaica, causing 19, 2, and 1 human
victim, respectively. More than 150 thousand people remained without telephonic
communication, and the damage exceeded 11 billion dollars.
Historical chronology of hurricanes happening over the American continent
shows that during one year the frequency of occurrence of hurricanes is non-uniform:
92 % of events fell on August-October with an approximately uniform distribution.
Typhoons can cause a local rise of the ocean’s level by several meters and, if it
takes place near the coastline, a 10-m wave is formed ﬂooding the lowlands at an
enormous rate. For example, numerous typhoons took place in 2000 over Taiwan,
Japan, South Korea, and other global regions. So, the typhoon “Billis” falling on 20
August at a rate of 360 km h−1 onto Taiwan during several hours ruined 25-
buildings (banks, schools, ofﬁces of companies, and dwelling houses), with the
damage of 48 million dollars. In late August, the typhoon “Prapiroon” stormed over
the East-China Sea at a wind speed of 43–181 km h−1. The international airport in
Shanghai was closed for some time. In the World Ocean there are seven regions of
the origin of typhoons located near the equator. The main cause of typhoons’
appearance is the heating of several tens of meters of the ocean water above the
critical level (26.8 °C). The satellite monitoring of typhoons has made it possible to
trace their routes. A trade-wind-caused typhoon moves mainly westward, gradually
turning to the north-east and east under the inﬂuence of Coriolis force. Up to 47 %
626
7
Tropical Cyclogenesis and Ecoinformatics Methods

of typhoons move along this parabolic trajectory. The remaining 53 % move along
other trajectories and, as a rule, not strictly regularly. But still, a great group of
typhoons (21 %) move, as a rule, along half the parabolic territory mentioned
above, and then move from south-east to north-west. Seven percent of typhoons
move east-to-west and from south-west to northeast, and 4 % of typhoons move
from south-to north.
Extreme atmospheric processes that have different external effects, undoubtedly,
have general origin. The search of the correlation between them can help to solve
the problem of earlier detection of tropical hurricane. However, it is necessary to
understand the interactivity character of processes that forego to the tropical hur-
ricane. Especially, this is important when temperature conditions for the hurricane
beginning are not realized.
The possibility that formation of hurricanes formed at temperature of an ocean’s
surface below 27 °C is connected with inﬂuence of other factors is not excluded.
For example, a constant or frequent-periodic degassing of rift zones of the Earth,
connected with magmatic, volcanic and hydrothermal activity on an ocean ﬂoor of a
tropical zone promotes considerable decrease in the level of “ocean-atmosphere“
system stability.
Figures 7.28 and 7.29 explain the role of geo-tectonic factors in tropical cyclo-
genesis activity. Considering the Fig. 7.29, it is necessary to notice that when the
seaﬂoor crust is younger, progress of tectonic processes and processes of degassing is
especially probable. According to these schemes, a number of tropical depressions
were generated practically over the mid-Atlantic ridge. The mid-Atlantic ridge has
the most strongly pronounced features among others mid-oceanic ridges of the World

ocean. Along the ridge arch there is a system of deep longitudinal breaks (rifts), on all
extent it is crossed by cross-section (transform) faults. Tectonic activity of a ridge is
in a greater degree shown in its northern part. The most active area of display ancient,
modern, above-water, underwater and rift volcanism in the mid-Atlantic ridge are the
Azores (40°N). Hurricanes formed in area of the mid-Atlantic ridge are Emily, Delta,
tropical depression Ten, Lee, Maria and, probably, storm Unnamed.
The Antillo-Caribbean tectonic region, mostly consisting from small Caribbean
lithospheric plate, is a tectonic active area. Moreover, underwater and above-water
volcanism is active here. There is a complex zone of a transform fault—trench
Cayman, at the bottom of the western part of Caribbean Sea between Jamaica and
Cayman islands. It can be precisely established on Fig. 7.29. It forms a part of
tectonic border between the North-American and Caribbean plates. The Cayman
Trough extends from northeast on a southwest, its maximal depth makes 7,686 m,
and it is the deepest point of Caribbean Sea. According to the received scheme, in
the region of this trough, two tropical depressions were generated: Arlene and
Wilma, last subsequently has developed in 5 category hurricane.
The Puerto Rico trench is located on border of Caribbean sea and Atlantic ocean,
almost along an island arch of Lesser Antilles. Carried out researches have con-
ﬁrmed an opportunity of occurrence of signiﬁcant tsunami as a result of earthquakes
in this area. Volcanic activity mainly underwater type is observed along this island
arch to a southeast from Puerto Rico up to coast of South America. In this region,
according to the scheme, hurricanes Gamma and Dennis (hurricane of 4 categories)
have been formed.

Tropical Cyclogenesis and Ecoinformatics Methods

Thus, from 31 considered tropical depressions, 5 depressions were formed and
developed further up to storm and hurricanes at temperatures of an ocean’s surface
below 27 °C. 10 tropical depressions were formed in areas of high tectonic activity—
subduction zones and rift zones of ocean. As it has appeared, tropical storm Delta and
Unnamed were formed and at temperature of an ocean’s surface below 27 °C, and
near to zones of high tectonic activity. In the previous report, assumptions have been
formulated and mechanisms of possible active inﬂuence of degassing processes of
the Earth (especially in tectonic active zones of oceans) on processes initiation and
origin of tropical depressions are described. The materials presented by the given
report have convincingly shown an opportunity of existence of such processes in the
nature on examples of origin of tropical cyclones and depressions in Atlantic Ocean
for a season of 2005.
The mechanisms of possible active inﬂuence of degassing processes of the Earth
(especially in active tectonic zones of oceans) on processes initiation and origin of
tropical depressions have been described by Syvorotkin (2002). It was also shown
that warm and cold ocean currents and ﬂows of air masses have powerful inﬂuence
on tropical cyclogenesis. This fact is observed when analyzing the variability of the
origin zones of tropical cyclones (TC) and in the study of seasonal and other
variations in ocean currents and winds.
We have already carried out a joint analysis of the impact of potential risk factors
for the tropical cyclogenesis, depending on the time period for the territory of the
Atlantic Ocean. In this study, an attempt was made to analyze a part of the globe for
distribution of these TC forming factors. The Western Hemisphere of the Earth was
chosen for the analysis. When working, it was decided to use the following method:
recalculation of the presence or absence of some TC forming factors on a grid with
cell size 1° by 1°.
Coordinate grid was formed containing 32,400 cells (180° × 180°). The num-
bering of cells is a line from the lower left corner. Cells lying entirely in the territory
of land were excluded from further consideration (about 7,000 cells). As an indi-
cator of tectonic activity the following data were collected: (1) data points of
recorded earthquakes (for period from 1973 to 2011); (2) the data on the location of
major volcanoes; map with boundaries of tectonic plates with different types of
faults (subduction zones, rift zones, transform faults, spreading, displacement). It is
important to note that the location points of volcanoes are given only to surface
volcanoes, the data for submarine volcanoes are absent, so we’ll keep in mind that
most of the submarine volcanoes are associated with the tectonically active zones.
For earthquakes data it was decided to allocate three gradations of danger (points):
0—no risk, 1—small risk (the number of earthquakes for the entire period of less than
or equal to 5), 2—high. Points of volcanoes: 0—no volcanoes nearby, 1—small risk
(the number of volcanoes less than or equal to 2), high—2. To determine the prox-
imity of cells to tectonic faults were allocated three grades: 0—no tectonic fault
nearby, 1—close to a fault, the proximity was determined by constructing a “buffer
zones” all along the faults width of 100 km, 2—the cell is directly at tectonic fault.
Data on the tectonic faults were calculated separately for the oceanic and continental
faults.

In addition to these indicators of tectonic activity, data on the possible inﬂuence of
ocean currents have been included in the database too. The presence of ocean currents
is largely caused to constant winds. Effect of Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone
(ITCZ—a transition zone between trade winds of the northern and southern hemi-
spheres, or between trades and monsoons, or between trades and equatorial westerly
winds) on the formation of tropical cyclones is well known. It is characterized by the
convergence of velocity, i.e. the weakening of the wind speed and the convergence of
the streamlines, as well as intensive development of convective clouds. The database
included data on the presence of convergence zones of oceanic currents: 0—no zones
of convergence of oceanic currents, 1—there is such zone.
All data were entered into the database (1° × 1° grid). Further obtained points for
all indicators were summed up. Database is shown in the Table 7.10.
7.8 Concluding Remarks and Future Problems
An analysis of observational data characterizing the ocean-atmosphere system
dynamics in the tropical sector of the World’s oceans shows that differentiation of
the ocean-atmosphere system phases by means of transitions in the meteorological
percolation cluster allows the division of zones with different levels of the ocean-
atmosphere system instability. To achieve a more reliable agreement between the

percolation cluster, it is necessary to establish the algorithm for the calculation of
the critical level of the renormalization probability p taking into consideration the
procedure of renormalization group transformations for more than two dimensions.
Only in this case the real-space renormalization process can make more precise the
moment of Im(t) transition from background zone Ξ1 to the signal zone Ξ3
(Fig. 7.17).
Thus, the following conclusions are drawn:
(1) An application of percolation procedure gives the possibility to detect the
moment when the ocean-atmosphere system switches its phase state from the
background position to the state with high level of environmental instability.
(2) An introduced indicator of the ocean-atmosphere system instability allows the
detection of the beginning of a hurricane before its detection by existing
monitoring systems.
(3) An increase of the precision of the proposed algorithm is possible with the
optimization of parametrical structure in the indicator Im(t).
It is evident that the solution to the problem of reliable prediction of the
beginning of a hurricane requires the development of an efﬁcient information
technology which must be used in the environmental monitoring systems. This
technology should include sections responsible for planning of measurements,
development of algorithms for complex processing of data from different sources,
and relevant risk assessment. The main difﬁculty in this lies in the spatial and
temporal heterogeneity of existing information obtained from different observa-
tional systems. This heterogeneity can be overcome by using the algorithms of the
space-temporal interpolation (Kondratayev et al. 2006; Krapivin and Varotsos
2007). Ultimately, however, the proof of the usefulness of a prediction algorithm
such as this one can only really be established by attempting to use it “live”, i.e. in
real time, to make predictions of hurricanes in their initial stages. The serious task
consists in the prediction of environmental disaster under minimal false alarm. To a
considerable extent it is a matter of the successful deﬁnition of thresholds.
Thus, the structural scheme of the multi-channel monitoring system for search
and detection of the hurricanes in their beginning stage can be presented by the
scheme of Figs. 3.16 and 7.13. One of these systems can be realized on the existing
meteorological stations located in the zones where hurricanes or typhoons are
beginning. Here Ti and ξi is the deterministic and stochastic components of Im or λ*,
respectively. Meteorological and geophysical data delivered by satellite sensors and
NDBC meteorological stations are processing for the calculation of Im or λ* that are
analyzed in the framework of sequential procedure described in Chap. 3. In fact, the
picture of Fig. 7.30 is realized at all times. The calculation of probabilities that
characterize the prognosis level for the anomaly moving direction (see Figs. 7.25
and 7.26) gives a possibility to have a cyclone track. This procedure can operate in
automatic mode.
7.8
Concluding Remarks and Future Problems
631

The future development of the proposed approach to the hurricane beginning
detection, in the ﬁrst place, requires the solution to the following problems:
• Study of the correlations between hurricane origin and solar activity and
understanding the interdependence between state of ocean-atmosphere system
and large-scale meteorological processes.
• An assessment of the role that processes of the Earth degassing play in the
formation of tropical cyclones and how the ozone layer state correlates with
events conducting the hurricanes.
• Search of the technologies to control the hurricanes when they are beginning.
• Perfection of climate models to make their effectiveness acceptable for the
detection of hurricane origin.

Ecoinformatics and Soil-Plant Formations
8.1 Methodology, Theory and Problems
As mentioned above, the ﬁeld of ecoinformatics provides concepts, methods and
standards in order to guide management and analysis of ecological data with par-
ticular emphasis on exploration of co-occurrences of organisms and their linkage to
environmental conditions and taxon attributes (Boden et al. 1994; Dengler et al.
2011; Fang et al. 2001; Rastetter et al. 2003). This chapter reﬂects on the devel-
opment of ecoinformatics and explores its importance for future global change
research with special focus on vegetation-plot data. Vegetation covers including
forests are the most impacted by the anthropogenic reconstruction and revision.
Therefore, the objective of this chapter is threefold:
(1) To present a working methodology for the combined use of modeling tech-
nology and microwave remote sensing measurements in the assessment of
attenuation of electromagnetic waves by the vegetation cover.
(2) To illustrate this methodology with computer calculations of the attenuation
for various soil-plant formations.
(3) To give a perspective of the developed methodology applied to the study of
global environmental change, including the radiative forcing problem.
The solution to the majority of applied problems within agro-meteorology, for-
estry, animal husbandry, and other areas of human activity directed toward the
protection of nature is difﬁcult because effective methods of control of the soil-plant
formation (SPF) are insufﬁciently developed. During the last few years, the global
carbon cycle problem has acquired a special signiﬁcance because of the greenhouse
effect. The knowledge of the state of the SPF allows to have a real picture of the
spatial distribution of the carbon sinks and sources on the Earth’s surface.

Speciﬁc interest is due to the fact that forest ecosystems play important role in
global environmental change. A forest ecosystem is a natural woodland unit con-
sisting of all plants, animals and micro-organisms (biotic) in an area functioning
together with all of the non-living physical (abiotic) factors of the environment. The
entire assemblage of forest organisms (trees, shrubs, herbs, bacteria, fungi, and
animals, including people) together with their environmental substrate (the sur-
rounding air, soil, water, organic debris, and rocks), is forest environment that is
studied by many authors (Gyde 2012; Silver 1998; Sudarshana et al. 2012; Krapivin
et al. 2013a–d). Forests and woodlands occupy about 31–38 % of the Earth’s
surface, and they are more productive and have greater biodiversity than other types
of terrestrial vegetation. Forests grow in a wide variety of climates, from steamy
tropical rainforests to frigid arctic mountain slopes, and from arid interior moun-
tains to windy rain-drenched coastlines. The type of forest in a given place results
from a complex of factors, including frequency and type of disturbances, seed
sources, soils, slope and aspect, climate, seasonal patterns of rainfall, insects and
pathogens, and history of human inﬂuence.
The world’s total forest area is just over 4 billion ha, which corresponds to an
average of 0.6 ha per capita. The ﬁve most forest-rich countries (the Russian
Federation, Brazil, Canada, the United States of America and China) account for
more than the half of the total forest area. Ten countries or areas have no forest at all
and an additional 54 have forest on less than 10 % of their total land area (Figs. 8.1,
8.2 and 8.3).
Tropical forests have speciﬁc interest. Sudarshana et al. (2012) noted that the
astounding richness and biodiversity of tropical forests are rapidly dwindling. This
has severely altered the vital biogeochemical cycles of carbon, phosphorus, Global
nitrogen etc. and has led to the change in global climate and pristine natural
ecosystems. Sudarshana et al. (2012) have deﬁned “Tropical Forests” broadly, into
ﬁve different themes:

(5) tropical forest protection and process.
At present time, many government, state, and private forestry organizations and
agencies utilize geospatial technology such as GIS (geographic information sys-
tems) and remote sensing for various applications supporting analysis, assessment,
and management of forests. It is well known that among the types of remote sensing
techniques, microwave radiometry is proved to be effective for observations of SPF
environmental parameters. However, these observations are a function of different
environmental conditions mainly depending on the SPF type. For this reason, it is
necessary to develop data processing methods for microwave monitoring that allow

the reconstruction of the SPF characteristics taking under consideration the vege-
tation types and that provide the possibility of synthesizing their spatial distribution.
As it is noted by Chukhlantsev et al. (2003), the problem of microwave remote
sensing of the vegetation cover requires the study of the attenuation of electro-
magnetic waves (EMW) within the vegetation layer. The solution of the problems
arising here is possible by the combination of experimental and theoretical studies.
The vegetation cover is commonly characterized by varied geometry and additional
parameters. Therefore, the knowledge of the radiative characteristics of the SPF as
functions of time and spatial coordinates can be acquired by a combination of on-
site measurements and models. General aspects of such an approach have been
considered by many authors (Del Frate et al. 2003; DeWitt and Nutter 1988; Dong
et al. 2003; Engman and Chauhan 1995; Ferrazzoli and Guerriero 1996; Friedi et al.
2002; Karam et al. 1992; Shutko 1987, 1992, 1997; Shutko et al. 1994, 1995; Font
et al. 2002; Kirdiashev et al. 1979; Field 2001; Goody and Jung 1989; Sellers 1985,
1987; Vinogradova et al. 2004). However, these investigations were mainly
restricted to the investigation of models describing the dependence of the vegetation
medium on environmental properties, as well as the correlation between the mor-
phological
and
biometrical
properties
of
the
vegetation
and
its
radiative
characteristics.
One prospective approach to the solution of the problems arising here is GIMS-
technology (Krapivin et al. 2006b; Krapivin and Shutko 2012; Nitu et al. 2007,
2013c). Combining an environmental acquisition system, a model describing how a
typical geo-ecosystem functions, a computer cartography system, and a means of
artiﬁcial intelligence should facilitate the creation of a geo-information monitoring
system for a typical natural element that is capable of solving many of the tasks that
arise in microwave radiometry of the global vegetation cover. The GIMS-based
approach, in the framework of the EMW attenuation by the vegetation canopies,
allows the synthesis of a knowledge base that establishes the relationships between
experiments, algorithms and models. The links between these areas have an
adaptive character giving an optimal strategy for experimental design and model
structure. The goal of this chapter is to explain and assess the application of the
GIMS method to the tasks of reconstructing the spatial and temporal distribution of
the SHF radiation characteristics.
An experience of the GIMS-technology application has shown that it opens new
prospects of microwave remote sensing monitoring of vegetation covers giving the
possibility to combine theoretical and empirical investigations of the vegetation role
in the microwave radiation of the land surface. The progress in the applied results
depends on the base of the GIMS models. As a result, the GIMS allows the
evaluation of the biosphere energy balance with high precision and for this reason
the following tasks are currently a subject to intense study:
• Development of the models for description of SPFs under minimal demands to
the parametrical environment.
• Analysis of possibilities of different monitoring systems to assess the SPF’s
characteristics.

• Theoretical and empirical study of microwave radiation and its propagation in
the atmosphere-vegetation-soil system.
• Synthesis of the GIMS database including theoretical and empirical assessments
for model coefﬁcients, radiation characteristics of vegetation, and spatial dis-
tribution of the biomes.
8.2 Global Dynamics of Land Ecosystems
The growing global size of population and the associated growing forcing of human
activity on the environment and ecosystems have become not only the main threat
to further sustainable development of civilization, in the context of the global
ecological safety, but also reﬂect a dangerous disorder in the normal functioning of
various systems of life support (Bolin and Sukumar 2000; Borodin et al. 2008;
Krapivin and Varotsos 2007, 2008). In connection with the key role of the eco-
systems in the processes of the natural regulation of the environmental properties,
of principal importance is an analysis of the available data on the global dynamics
of ecosystems and an assessment of possible trends. Important information on these
problems can be found, in particular, in recent publications by many authors
(Kondratyev and Krapivin 2001c, d; Hackler et al. 1999; Ito and Oikawa 2002;
Seppelt and Voinov 2002; Gbondo-Tugbawa and Driscoll 2002; Lischke et al.
2002; Sellers et al. 1997; Bouwman 1990), among which the most informative is
the report prepared by the World Resources Institute (WRI 2011) supported by the
UN Programme of Development, UNEP, and the World Bank (A Guide… 2000;
WRI 2012). This report emphasizes a close relationship between the global eco-
systems and the global population—a symbiosis, unique and extremely sensitive to
external forcings. These presentations have been thoroughly substantiated by
Gorshkov et al. (2000, 2002) in the form of a concept of biotic regulation of the
environment. Monographs by Kondratyev (1998a, b, 1999) and new publications
(Kondratyev et al. 2000; Kondratyev and Krapivin 2001c; Nitu et al. 2004, 2013a, b;
Krapivin and Shutko 2012) contain an analysis of the key aspects of the global
changes from the viewpoint of functioning of the global systems of life support and
requirements to an adequate ecological monitoring.
Global natural and regulated ecosystems play an important role as a factor of the
environmental dynamics ranging from micro-scales (e.g., soil bacteria) to the whole
planet and, on the other hand, are vitally important sources of drinking water, food,
timber, paper, and other means of life support. As has been mentioned earlier, an
urgency of the problem is that the world, on the whole, has already drawn near such
limits to the impacts on the ecosystems, an exceeding of which is fraught with
irreversible destruction of the global systems of life support. These limits have
already been exceeded; though the present enthusiasm for apocalyptic predictions
is, so far, unfounded (this especially refers to the so-called “global warming”.
8.1
Methodology, Theory and Problems
637

An extreme complexity of the discussed problem is that it is necessary to explain
(and, as far as possible, to predict) the dynamics of the interactive system “nature–
society” (the society should be placed ﬁrst here since its functioning determines its
impact on nature) with its numerous feedbacks, nonlinear nature, and “surprises”.
Unfortunately, the present stage of studies of the system “nature–society” can be
considered not more than initial and preliminary. This refers to even a simple
description of the present condition of nature (global ecosystems), which results
from the observational data deﬁcit with an apparent abundance of some observa-
tional means (especially expensive space-borne means). Therefore the reports of the
World Resources Institute (WRI 2011, 2012) are in many respects incomplete,
being concentrated only in consideration of ﬁve types of ecosystems (the share of
land surface is given in brackets, except the Antarctic and Greenland occupied by
the respective ecosystem): agricultural ecosystems (28 %), coastal regions (22 %
within a 100-km band), forest (22 %), fresh-water (<1 %), and grass (41 %) eco-
systems. An abandonment of the World Ocean is, of course, a serious, though
justiﬁed (in view of information deﬁcit) ﬂaw.
Special attention should be also paid to the soil ecosystems. These ecosystems
are very important for the solution of various problems of human life support and
regulation of the environmental conditions (Table 8.1). Human use of the land
surface includes about 2 % for habitation, roads, and the like; 12 % for crops; 25 %
for livestock grazing; and exploitation one way or another of 30 % more in forests
or tree farms. The remaining 20 % is mostly deserts, mountaintops, and other places
with inhospitable climates. People also mobilize minerals at rates far above those of
natural processes and are changing the composition of the atmosphere in potentially
dangerous ways. In 1986, a study found that humanity had already destroyed or was
co-opting almost the half of the planet’s NPP, thus interfering in many ways with
the biosphere’s present and future capacity to support the human population
(Ehrlich and Ehrlich 2009).
The authors of the report of the World Resources Institute (WRI 2011, 2012)
have brieﬂy summarized the anthropogenic impacts on the ecosystems during the
civilization development, beginning from an intensive application of the irrigation
systems during the Shumer civilization, which had led to soil salinization, to the
present global processes of atmospheric pollution and the ozone layer depletion
(Kondratyev and Varotsos 2000; Sivasakthivel and Reddy 2011). The data of
Table 8.2 characterize the most important aspects of anthropogenic impacts on the
ecosystems nowadays.
There are numerous examples of destructive (and even catastrophic) impacts on
ecosystems and their economic consequences (see for details Grigoryev and
Kondratyev 2001). The collapse of cod catch in 1990 in the sea regions of Canada
resulted in about 30 thousand ﬁshermen unemployed, and only in the region of
Newfoundland brought forth serious economic difﬁculties in 700 settlements.
Material losses in China reaching 11.2 × 109 $US/year have resulted from a deﬁcit
of drinking water due to polluted river and sub-soil waters. In India, the commercial
forest cutting and the transformation of the deforested lands into the agricultural

ones have not only changed the traditional way of people’s life but also caused a
deﬁcit of wood fuel and timber to the detriment of 275 millions of rural population.
As for the estimates of the consequences of the global anthropogenic impacts,
the situation with the water resources is an example: about 28 % of the global
population have no access to pure drinking water; every year about 5 million people
die because of drinking low quality water and anti-sanitary conditions; about 90 %
of wastes in the developing countries go to rivers, lakes, and coastal regions of the
seas, etc. Intensiﬁed emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere have caused consider-
able changes in the global carbon
cycle (Demirchian and Kondratyev 2004;
Kondratyev et al. 2003c; Field et al. 2004; Archer 2010).
The most important fact is that the levels of impact on the ecosystems have
become of a global scale. About 75 % of marine ﬁsh populations have either
decreased due to violation of the permissible amounts of catch or come close to the
threshold of their survival. An intensive forest cutting has almost halved the for-
ested areas, and the construction of various economic infrastructures has caused a
fragmentation of the forest cover (Kaiser 2000; Keller et al. 2001). About 58 % of
coral reefs are seriously affected by ﬁshery, tourism, and pollution. Almost 65 % of
arable lands have partially lost their fertility. The scales of economic usage of
ground waters exceed the rate of their natural recovery by at least 160 × 109 m3/
year. In most cases the anthropogenic load on the ecosystems has intensiﬁed. This
especially concerns the pasture ecosystems where the interference of the human’s
factor has reached the level of direct control (Schulte 2003; Schulte et al. 2003).
It is well known that the main causes of ecosystems’ degradation are the growing
size of population and, respectively, increased needs for natural resources as well as
enhancing loads on the environments (Table 8.2). Concrete detailed data charac-
terizing the present global situation can be found in numerous publications
(Kondratyev 1998a, 1999, 2000a; A Guide… 2000; Watson et al. 2000). It is
notable that the strongest geographical non-uniformly of the growing scales of

consumption is an extremely important feature of the growing scales of con-
sumption reﬂecting the socio-economic contrasts in the world.
Furthermore, we shall discuss the principal results obtained within the frame-
work of the pilot analysis of the global ecosystems (PAGES) (A Guide… 2000).
The main difﬁculties of this analysis are connected with the deﬁcit of the available
information. The PAGES project is focused on the consideration of the three types
of the indicators of impacts on the ecosystems dynamics:
(1) anthropogenic loads (increasing size of population, growing level of resources
consumption,
pollutions,
overexploitation
of
natural
and
controlled
ecosystems);
(2) the spatial extent of ecosystems (size, shapes, localization, geographical
distribution);
(3) production of economically important products such as agricultural crops,
wood, ﬁsh, etc.
A considerable drawback of each of these indicators and all of them is that they
do not contain information about the thresholds of ecosystems’ ability to perform
their functions of life support.
Figure 8.4 illustrates the presentation of the expert assessments of the state of
ecosystems and their functioning as the life supporting systems including the
respective trends: increasing ability of ecosystems to perform the life supporting

functions (↗), a reduced ability (↘), mixed trends (↑↓), unknown trends (?). The
ﬁgures characterize the levels of the ecosystems’ functioning as life-supporting
compared with the situation 20–30 years ago: 1—excellent, 2—good, 3—satis-
factory, 4—weak, 5—unsatisfactory, 6—no estimate. The results of the expert
assessments shown in Fig. 8.4 testify, on the whole, to considerable anthropogenic
forcings on ecosystems (especially during the 20th century) that have led to con-
siderable changes in their ability to perform the life-supporting functions. Though
in some cases (e.g., food production) the ecosystems’ productivity has substantially
increased, providing thereby the needed level of production, nevertheless, in other
cases (drinking water quality, preserving the biomass, etc.) there was a degradation
of the ecosystems’ functioning.
The biodiversity losses during the last century have acquired the threatening
scales and concern practically all ecosystems (mainly—as a result of the loss of
habitats). So, for instance, the area of forests has decreased at least by 20 % and
probably (on global scales) by 50 %. Some forest ecosystems (like the dry tropical
forests of Central America) have disappeared at all. In many countries up to 50 % of
mangrove plantations have been lost, the area of wetlands has almost halved, and in
some regions the size of territories covered with grass has decreased by 90 %. Only
the tundra, arctic, and marine deep-water systems have little changed though in
these cases substantial anthropogenic impacts also occur sometimes.
Even when the initial areas of the ecosystems have been preserved, many species
are threatened with pollution, over-exploitation, intrusion of “alien” species, and
degradation of habitats. From the viewpoint of biodiversity, the fresh-water eco-
systems have suffered most. For instance, about 20 % of the fresh-water ﬁsh species
have been exterminated, and many other species are in a very dangerous condition.
The forest, grass, and coastal ecosystems face serious problems of survival. The
biodiversity is threatened with frequented diseases of marine organisms, intensive
ﬂorescence of water bodies, and a considerable reduction of the population of
amphibians. Apart from the respective losses for medicine (due to a decreasing
volume of raw materials for drugs), banks of genes, and eco-tourism, a reduction of
biodiversity means also a threat to the ecosystems’ productivity, their integrity and
resistance to various external forcings.

consequences

And ﬁnally, it is clear that there are now numerous signs of anthropogenically
caused degradation of ecosystems and their reduced ability to function as systems
of life support and control of the environmental properties. The data discussed
above show that all the ecosystems considered suffer serious and increasing
anthropogenic forcings. Intensive processes of transformation of natural ecosystems
take place due to deforestation, pollution (with biogenes, including), dams building
and biological intrusions of alien organisms. Anthropogenic forcings result in
considerable transformations of the global biogeochemical cycles, whose normal
functioning is a guarantee of the ecosystems’ safety.
So far, the negative trends of the state of the global ecosystems do not vividly
threaten the high levels of production of various products and services. The food
and ﬁbre production has never reached such high levels as nowadays, but the dam
constructions have ensured an unprecedented regulation of the river run-off to
provide the water use in the interests of agriculture. However, the progress in
creating the material well-being is fraught with a long-term prospect of reduction of
productivity of the global ecosystems and their reduced ability to regulate the
environmental quality. The use of new technical means and technologies such as
synthetic fertilizers, improved means of ﬁshing, and irrigation systems has masked a
decrease of bioproductivity of natural ecosystems, ensuring a needed growth of
food and ﬁbre production. As for the long-term prospects (in this context the
sustainable development is deﬁned), one should remember a reduced functioning of
natural systems of life support, which manifests itself, for instance, in the form of a
dangerous decrease of biodiversity, reduced quality of drinking water, intensive
emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and many other negative
phenomena.
The ecosystem approach has the following main features:
1. Complex (systematic) character of analysis of interactions in the “society–nat-
ure” system;
2. Not fragmentary but integral analysis of the ecosystems’ functioning;
3. Consideration of all the spatial-temporal diversity of the processes with the
indispensable priority of long-term prospects;
4. A detailed consideration of interactive processes in the “society–nature” system;
5. Justiﬁcation and accounting of the limits of the normal functioning of ecosys-
tems, and in this connection, permissible anthropogenic loads.
The Table 8.3 data illustrate the differences between traditional and ecosystem
approaches to the use of natural resources as applied to forestry. Of course,
advantages of the ecosystem approach raise no doubts. However, the problem is to
what extent the conditions of the socio-economic development of either country
permit a successive realization of the ecosystem approach. The negative manifes-
tations of the dynamics of various ecosystems reﬂect vividly great (sometimes
insurmountable) difﬁculties to realize the ecosystem approach. As far as this is
concerned, the participants of the PAGES project have formulated the following
general recommendations:

phase. To a great extent this is explained by inadequate complex information about
the ecosystems and their functioning. So, for instance, the problem of the global
carbon cycle attracts serious attention since long ago. Nevertheless, even the system
requirements have not been formulated yet for complex observational data, which
would make it possible to also obtain adequate information about the laws of the
carbon cycle (of course, this requires a combined use of both usual and satellite
means of observations).
In this connection, UN Secretary-General KoﬁA. Annan justly noted: “It is
impossible to justify an efﬁcient ecological policy if it is not based on reliable
scientiﬁc information. Though in many spheres a considerable progress has been
reached in obtaining the observational data, there remain considerable gaps in our
knowledge. In particular, so far, no complete global assessment has been obtained
for the state of the main ecosystems existing over the globe. A response to this
necessity was the planned (Millennium Ecosystems Assessment—MEA), as an
important international initiative aimed at mapping the “health” of our planet (Lu
and Li 2003). This initiative has been backed by many Governments, as well as by
UNEP, UNDP, FAO, and UNESCO. I call upon the Governments—UN members
to give the needed ﬁnancial support in assessing the state of ecosystems for the last
Millennium and take an active part in the program”.
An implementation of the MEA program started in 2001 is only a ﬁrst step
towards an assessment of the state of the global ecosystems, as well as development
and realization of measures needed to preserve the ecosystems on the planet when
the need for natural resources grows. On the other hand, there came up an acute
problem to preserve not simply the quality of the environment but normal func-
tioning of the life-supporting systems on the Earth, without which further devel-
opment of civilization is impossible.
8.3 Modeling the Vegetation Dynamics
8.3.1 General Approach to the Modeling in Biocoenology
Numerical biocoenology has become an independent scientiﬁc direction due to
many authors who combined in their studies the potentials of ecology and
numerical modeling (Krapivin and Kelley 2009; Degermendzhy et al. 2009). This
combination has resulted in many principles of traditional ecology being re-ori-
ented, creating a kind of information interface between ecology and other sciences
and evaluating the role played by complex interdisciplinary studies. The sphere of
interests of this new direction includes the problems of complexity and generality in
the development of the ecological laws.
The recently developed models cover the problems such as a parameterization
of the vegetation covers succession, description of the production process as a
function of the environmental factors (Wirtz 2000), modeling the competition for
common resources (Alekseev et al. 1992), modeling the natural-anthropogenic
646
8
Ecoinformatics and Soil-Plant Formations

systems (Polishchuk 1992; Ugolnitsky 1999), modeling the spatial-temporal
dynamics of the ecological systems, and many others.
Many authors solve the problem of modeling a succession of vegetation com-
munities basing on their points of view on succession processes. There are two
fundamental interpretations of these processes based on the concepts of endo-
ecogenesis and exo-ecogenesis. The most stable idea of the character of the
dynamic phenomena in phytocenoses is an idea of a single process of the vegetation
development under the inﬂuence of both external and internal factors. In this case,
the process of succession covers such factors as soil development, layer-by-layer
division of the vegetation community, change of the height of plants and their
accumulated biomass, microclimate formation, change of the species diversity, and
relative stability of the community. The classiﬁcation of the forms of the vegetation
community dynamics and its affecting factors is important for further synthesis of
the numerical model. Vasilevich (1983) introduced the following categories of
successions: endogenic (autogenic), exogenic (allogenic), continuous, post-disrup-
tive (post-catastrophic). In the case of endogenic succession, the source of changes
is located in the vegetation itself and it is affected by changes in the medium. There
are no stages in continuous successions. In the course of post-disruptive succession,
changes in the community take place from unstable to stable conditions. Exo-
ecogenesis is characterized by prevailing external factors.
Population dynamics was a novel development in succession modeling. Thus,
Hulst (1979) proposed three types of the models of succession. The ﬁrst type is a
model of succession with response but without competition, that is, there is an effect
of reaction of the vegetation community to changes in the environmental condi-
tions. Succession is described by the usual differential equation:
dNi=dt ¼ riNi ki  Ni
ð
Þ=ki
where Ni is the number of individuals of the ith species, ri is the rate of an
exponential growth, ki is a maximum of population density.
The second type of the succession model is based on suppression of one species
by another in the process of intrusion. In this case, the coefﬁcient of competition is
used:
aij ¼ @ dNi=dt
½
=@Nj=@ dNi=dt
½
=@Ni;
and the model itself is written as:
dNi=dt ¼ riNiðki 
X
aijNiÞ=ki
The third type of the model of succession has alternative character. If in the ﬁrst
two models the population density is a function of the size of previous species of
vegetation, a maximum of population density ki depends on time.
The production of organic matter by vegetation community depends on physi-
ological processes in the organisms of the plants, resources of solar radiation,
8.3

moisture, elements of mineral nutrition, temperature, and many other internal and
external factors. The modeling of the production process takes into account pho-
tosynthesis, respiration, matter motion, transpiration, division of cells, etc. There
are numerous correlations between these factors and production of plants. Lieth’s
formulas are used most often (Lieth 1985). In order to estimate the annual pro-
duction of plants Rp (g/cm2/year) as a function of the mean-annual temperature
T (°C) and the mean annual precipitation amount r (mm), the following estimate
can be used:
Rp ¼ 3;000 min

o
Vegetation biomass density P on a given territory is generally modeled by the
balance equation:
dP=dt ¼ minfqP; RPPg  MP  TP
where ρP is a maximum B/D-coefﬁcient of the considered type of vegetation, RPP is
the vegetation productivity for B/D-coefﬁcient values less than ρP for the present
values of B/D-coefﬁcient, MP and TP are parameters of decay and respiration
expenditure per unit time, respectively.
The use of parametric descriptions of productivity in biogeocenotic models is
important as an addition to the monitoring of vegetation communities. Unfortu-
nately, the existing database and the knowledge do not give any synthesized
information about a huge amount of empirical correlations representing depen-
dences of productivity and other functional components of vegetation communities.
Quite special in the numerical bio-geocenology is the problem of model
description of the competition between individual plants. On the whole, the mutual
impact of plants is described by the so-called competition indices (Bogatyrev 1988).
A freely growing plant is a plant whose functioning is independent of resource and
is determined by only species characteristics and external parameters. An interac-
tion between plants starts with their inﬂuence on the same resource and with the
mutual intrusion on the territories occupied by free growth. Biomes have more
complicated and diverse interrelationships and, as a result, they differentiate niches
and habitats. Mirkin (1986) introduced ﬁve types of strategies for the plants with
regard to their functioning in the environment (K—violents, S—ecotopic patients,
Sk—phytocenotic patients, R—true explerents, Rk—false or phytocenotic exple-
rents). A systems approach is possible to a model description of competition and
survival. All these strategies are inherent in individual species to different degrees
and, therefore, synthesizing a model of survival is determined by a concrete set of
the plant’s requirements to niche parameters. A plant’s niche is usually an aggre-
gation of the space it occupies, resources it uses, and additional conditions, for
instance, the presence of pollinators, phytofugs, etc.

Each plant or some totality of plants N interacts with the environment
H (including other plants) exchanging some amount of resources VN for an obtained
volume of resources WN. The structure |N| and the behavior N of plants or their
communities are in an equilibrium state with the structure |H| and behavior H of the
environment, and this state is described by a minimax criterion:

The goals NS and HS of vegetation continuum N and environment H, respec-
tively, can be opposite, partially coinciding, or indifferent. Due to the developed
optimal strategy, plants of different kinds adjust to the levels of (V, W)-exchange,
which are possible on a given territory. Thus, because of differentiation of niches,
there are multi-level vegetation communities, for instance, in the forest the factor of
niches differentiation is many-sided. It covers such special features of various kinds
of plants as the location of roots at different depths, different periods of blossoming,
different response of plants to climate changes, different need of species for mineral
nutrition, etc. In general, a plant’s niche can vary in time both due to the dynamics
of the plant itself and in connection with the drifting of the adjacent niches. The
diversity of possible situations brings forth series of models of the functioning of
vegetation communities.
One of the characteristic examples of the models of vegetation communities is a
discrete model by Galitsky (1985). Let us consider it in detail. The equation that
describes a change of the plant’s biomass B is written as
dB=dt ¼ k tð ÞðaBk þ B=Bf

cBf  aBk
where k(t) = min{A/Af (t), 1} is the indicator of the plant’s provision with a territory,
A is the size of the available territory for the plant’s growth, Af is the size of the
territory needed for free growth; Bf is the biomass of a freely growing plant; α is the
characteristic of the item of expenditure in the balance (on the biomass mainte-
nance); γ is the index of the deﬁcit of territory.
The gist of the Galitsky model’s functioning is that the biomass of each plant
located in a cell of its own in a common mosaic, changes independent of other
plants of the community until either this plant or any of its neighbors dies for lack
of territory. At the moment of dying the adjacent plants rush to distribute the vacant
territory, and after changing the parameter A, the equation of the model is valid
again. As a result, as individual plants die, the original mosaic changes on a local
scale, gradually covering larger areas. The criterion of dying off is simple: a plant is
considered dead if its biomass becomes below some threshold level Bdead
(Bdead(t) = εBf (t), 0 < ε < 1).

8.3.2 Biocoenotic Model
The vegetation cover parameters change during the year depending on the weather
situation (Table 8.4). The speciﬁc biomass Qi of the ith type of vegetation at time
t can be parameterized according to the following equation:
@Qi=@t ¼ Ri  Mi  Ei;
ð8:1Þ
where Ri is the biomass productivity and Mi and Ei are the biomass losses at the
expense of withdrawal and transpiration, respectively.
The function Mi(φ, ψ, t) reﬂects the set of natural MNi and anthropogenic MAi
processes leading to vegetation biomass losses (Mi = MNi + MAi):
Miðu; w; tÞ ¼ liðtÞQiðu; w; tÞ
where φ, ψ are the latitude and longitude, respectively.

where eðTcÞ is the saturated vapor pressure inside the canopy foliage (in units of

density (kg m−3), cp is the air speciﬁc heat (J kg−1 K−1) and γp is the psychrometric
constant (Pa K−1).

As shown in Figs. 1.9 and 1.11, the GIMS comprises 30 or 12 models for the
SPF. The list of SPFs given in Table 1.11 was adopted to spatial resolution of
4° × 5° according to Bazilivich and Rodin (1967) classiﬁcation. The results
obtained by Krapivin et al. (1982) were used to synthesize these models. All of
these are based on Eq. (8.1) for the balance of the biomass Qi(φ, ψ, t). The actual
plant productivity is approximated as follows:

of the soil and c = atmosphere CO2 concentration. The di

8.3.3 Classiﬁcation of Soil-Plant Formations
and Their Archive
Figure 1.9 gives an example of the ecological subdivision of the SPFs taking into
account many abiotic factors. From the standpoint of microwave monitoring, the set
of principal vegetation features play a signiﬁcant role in the solution of the elec-
tromagnetic wave attenuation problem. It is known that there are three priority
factors for each type of vegetation cover: wet biomass Q, productivity R and water
content ρP. These factors are functions of the climatic zones. Therefore, the
assessment of the impact of climate change on the potential productivity of the
vegetation requires a model development to describe the vegetation dynamics.
There exist many approaches toward solving this task. Some classiﬁcations are
based on the reﬂection of the principle variables describing the structure of the
ground ecosystem: land cover and soil types, phenology, biomass, soil moisture and
temperature proﬁles. High precision classiﬁcations take into account the vertical
structure of the ecosystems (layered ecosystems), their age structure, canopy
chemistry, disturbance, decomposition, degree of anaerobiosis of the ecosystem,
rate of succession, ecosystem stratiﬁcation, ratio of C3–C4 plants, etc. It is clear that
the classiﬁcation of the vegetation cover is a complex problem of biocenology. The

degree of correspondence between published classiﬁcations and real distributions of
vegetation types inﬂuences the ﬁnal model estimations of EMW attenuation by the
vegetation cover. Therefore, GIMS technology stipulates that the spatial structure of
the vegetation of the landscape studied is corrected by satellite observations.
However, reliable observations are available only for relatively limited areas.
Therefore, extrapolations are often used to correct the vegetation structure image.
The effective global spatial structure of SPFs depends on the speciﬁc features of
problem solved. For instance, Bounoua et al. (2000) using SiB2 model and spatial
resolution 7.2° × 9.0° for 12 types of SPFs analyzed seasonal variations of NDVI
depending on the climate change. Sud et al. (1996) used horizontal resolution 4° × 5°
for 13 types of soil-plant formations to study biogeophysical consequences of a
tropical deforestation scenario realization. Certainly, the quality of results is a
function of both soil-plant classiﬁcation and spatial resolution. Unfortunately, at the
present time there is no reliable global database with detailed parametrical
description of SPFs and this is one of the most important problems of global
monitoring.
Biometric and production characteristics of the vegetation covers are important
for the solution to many problems when it is necessary to assess the consequences
of anthropogenic activity, to decide the economic problems of the nature man-
agement, to assess the risk of the land ecosystem reconstruction, and to study the
causes of natural disasters. Moreover, there are numerous other problems arising in
the NSS with the use of SPFs archives. The base of SPFs archive of long-time
storing contains the existing spatial and structural classiﬁcations of SPFs. Examples
of such classiﬁcations are given in Figs. 1.9 and 1.11. The GIMS database and
knowledge base is ﬁlled with information about the SPFs spatial structure and their
characteristics. Consequently, the archive of biometric and production character-
istics of vegetation (ABPCV) consists from three basic levels:
1. Scales of spatial geographical discretization of the land surface.
2. Skeleton map containing the vegetation types in each pixel of spatial discreti-
zation of the land surface.
3. Biometric and production characteristics of vegetation located in each pixel of
the land surface.
Information content of these levels is supported by the ABPCV ﬁle structure
(Figs. 8.5 and 8.6). Files with the intermediate information include data about
illumination, nutrient salts in soil, soil moisture, topographic parameters, etc.
Information control system of the ABPCV is presented in Fig. 8.7.
Figure 8.8 explains the ABPCV conﬁguration where ﬁle of metadata has doc-
umentation giving a possibility to make a correct choice of data that are needed for

8.3.4 Modeling the Forest Ecosystems
The forest ecological system is an important constituent of the global continuum of
the soil-plant formations on the Earth (see Table 1.2 and Fig. 1.9). Therefore the
development of the models that would describe the forest dynamics is a principal
stage of the synthesis of the global model. Of course, the importance of the models
of the forest ecosystems is greater, since forest resources and their use affect the
economic potentials of the regions.
The variety of forest ecosystem types functioning in different environmental
conditions needs the search of acceptable models giving a possibility to assess their
dynamics. Hacenauer (2012) discussed modeling technology for these aims dis-
played on three main areas:

• models of the growth and productivity;
• succession models; and
• biogeochemical-mechanical models.
The choice of the model type or creation of combined model requests the co-
ordination of spatial and temporal scales as it is shown in Fig. 8.9.

Many authors describe the dynamics of total biomass of an individual plant in
the form of a logistic equation:
dB=dt ¼ k Blim  B
ð
ÞB;
where B is the biomass, Blim is the threshold amount of biomass, k is the coefﬁcient
reﬂecting the effect of the environmental factors and the plant’s type on its growth.
To describe the dynamics of the tree growth, the simplest functions are often
used, such as Terazaki’s equation B = a exp(−b/t), Koller’s function B = axb c−ct,
approximation by Korsun’ and Bakman B = a exp(blnt + cln2t), etc. Bichele et al.
(1980) were ﬁrst to propose a more complicated model of the tree growth described
by the system of ordinary differential equations:
dBj ¼ KU  kRRj  Vj þ KM;
where KU ¼ kF
P4
i¼1 aijUi; KM ¼ M P4
i¼1 bij; Bj is the biomass of individual
organs of a plant (j = 1, 2, 3, 4), M is the dry biomass of the whole plant; Φi is an
amount of carbon dioxide assimilated during 24 h by the ith organ of the plant (kFΦI
is an equivalent dry biomass, kF is the coefﬁcient of equivalence); Ri is an amount
of carbon dioxide emitted during 24 h by the ith organ of the plant (kRRi is an
equivalent dry biomass, kR is the coefﬁcient of equivalency); Vi is the dry biomass
of part of the ith organ; αij is the share of “fresh” assimilates created during 24 h in
the ith organ of the plant, moving during the same period of time into the jth organ
of the plant; βij is the exchange of “old” assimilates during 24 h between the ith and
jth organs, per gram of dry biomass of the whole plant; KΦ is an increment of
biomass due to photosynthesis and re-distribution of fresh assimilates; KM is an
increment connected with the re-distribution of old assimilates; kRRj is the biomass
expenditure on respiration.

Of course, the coefﬁcients of the model described above are functions of the
environmental parameters. An account of the effect of the environment on the
dynamics of the tree growth is realized, as a rule, within the principle of the Libikh
limiting factors. PAR, carbon dioxide, temperature, humidity, as well as mineral
salts in the soil are among the factors of the environment. By the principle of
limiting factors, a plant grows until the “resources” of some factor reach the limit.
An introduction of this principle is connected with many uncertainties, and there-
fore in concrete situations it must be tested using experimental estimates.
More developed models of the tree growth instead of a set of empirical
parameters whose uncertainties are often a great barrier to practical application of
the models, include the functional dependences of the elements of the tree growth
on the environmental factors. Among the most widespread and often applied is the
Libikh criterion according which the growth of a plant is conﬁned to an element,
whose concentration is at a minimum. By this criterion a plant or its organs grow
until the resources of some element, for instance, photosynthetically active radiation
(PAR), moisture, temperature, carbon dioxide, nutritious salts are exhausted. There
are other criteria testifying to a weighed inﬂuence of all environmental factors, these
weights are characteristic indicators of the plant type.
The process of tree growing can be presented as a result of interaction of three
processes of growth: change of the leaf (needle) mass, growth of the trunk, and
development of the root system. This process is schematically shown in Figs. 8.10
and 8.11.
Denote the biomass of the canopy, trunk, and roots of the tree as x1, x2, and x3,
respectively. Then, the balance equation of a tree model is written as
xiðt þ DtÞ ¼ xi tð Þ þ ei tð Þ Rx  Tx
f
gDt; i ¼ 1; 2; 3
ð
Þ;
where Δt is the characteristic time step, Rx is the gross productivity of a tree due to
photosynthesis, Tx is the biomass expenditure on respiration, εi is the share of new
biomass moving into the biomass of the ith organ of the tree.
The εi parameters are functions of time as well as other parameters of the
environment. Following the principle of maximum survival, a supposition can be
made that the principle of maximum primary productivity is valid:

One of the important limiting factors of the tree growth is water, the movement of
which in the soil and the tree body determines the dynamics of the tree biomass
change. Following Kirilenko (1990), let us denote the soil as a homogeneous porous
layer [0, zg], where zg is the depth of ground water. Moreover, the following nota-
tions are introduced: W —relative soil moisture (kg H2O/m3/[kg soil/m3], ρ—water
density, ρs—volume density of soil. A system of coordinates (x, y, z) is also intro-
duced, where the z-axis is directed down from the soil surface (z = 0). Then, the
movement of water through the soil can be described by Darsi’s 3-D equation:

empirical constant, ψ0 is the water potential within the root system, s(z) is the
function of the vertical distribution of the root system (s(0) = 0, s(z0) = 1).
To complete the synthesis of the tree’s water regime, let us parameterize the
processes of water ﬂow in the plant and transpiration. It is assumed that from the root
system the water ﬂows by the trunk to canopy (branches, leaves) and then evaporated
into the atmosphere (Lai et al. 2000; Lal et al. 1998) and the above ground part of the
tree of the height H is divided into n equal layers: H = nΔz. Across the boundaries of
the ith layer the water moves due to the difference between water potentials ψi and ψi−1
overcoming the resistance of the xylem vessels:

where ξks is the speciﬁc conductivity of the xylem, S
ks is the cross-section of the tree
at a height z. As a result, with the area of the cross-section supposed to be vertically

the ith layer is obtained:

8.3.5 Modeling the Energy Fluxes in the Atmosphere-Plant-
Soil System
The energy exchange in the system atmosphere-plant-soil (APS) plays an important
role in the formation of climatic processes on every spatial and temporal scale, and
therefore it should be considered in the models of the greenhouse effect that
increases the reliability of the estimates. The appearing problems include the
development of methods in order to measure the energy ﬂuxes in the air-surface
layer as well as their modeling. A special aspect of these problems concerns the
development of technologies of estimation of energy ﬂuxes in the APS system on
global scales to take these estimates into account in the global climate systems.
There are well-developed methods of the remote sensing of a wide set of climatic
parameters including energy ﬂuxes (Krapivin and Kondratyev 2002; Shutko et al.
2010). However, in the remote sounding of the APS system a complicated problem
of an assessment of the screening impact of vegetation over the wavelength regions
used in the monitoring system arises.
Beginning from the 1980s, studies have been carried out on developing a model
of photosynthesis a vegetation bud. Farquhar et al. (1980) showed how a biological
model of the CO2 assimilation by leaves is connected with fermentative kinetics
and electronic properties of the chloroplast, which made it possible to rather
plausibly describe the process of photosynthesis for the plants of class C. Then Ball
(1988) and Collatz et al. (1990, 1991, 1992), using a model technology and
observation data on the process of the vegetation bud conductivity in photosyn-
thesis, derived a semi-empirical model of the vegetation bud functioning with an
account of changes of the environmental temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration
in the atmosphere, and intensity of assimilation of the vegetation species itself.
The problem have been also considered on the consequences of the distribution of
the photosynthetic potential of leaves and canopy of plants with respect to
illumination and a criterion has been developed to determine a common potential
corresponding to maximum photosynthetic abilities of the plant in CO2 assimilation.
Sellers (1985, 1987) developed methods of the vertical integration of leaf can-
opies, models of light scattering and absorption, photosynthesis and conductivity of

the vegetation bud, known before only for a leaf. These studies revealed an
interaction between spectral characteristics of a vegetation species (spectral vege-
tation index—SVI) and important functional relationships that regulate the pro-
cesses of photosynthesis and evaporation off leaf canopies. Apart from this, an
accomplished analysis revealed a connection between the share of the photosyn-
thetically active radiance (PAR), absorbed by the vegetation canopy with the
respective characteristic coefﬁcient of vegetation species (simple ratio vegetation
index—SR). Here, we consider SR and relative difference (normalized difference
vegetation index—NDVI) as SVI. Spectral characteristics of vegetation species SR
and NDVI are based on the remote sounding of the reﬂected emission in the visible
and near-IR regions and determined as follows:
SR ¼ aN=aV;
NDVI ¼ aN  aV
ð
Þ= aN þ aV
ð
Þ
where aN and aN are hemispheric reﬂections and radiance in the visible and near-IR
wavelength regions, respectively.
The parameters aN and aN are measured directly above a leaf canopy. Therefore
the effects of absorption and scattering of emission by the atmosphere are not
considered here. For the space-borne remote sounding a method has been devel-
oped to correct the experimental data, FASIR (Fourier-adjusted, solar zenith angle
corrected, interpolated and reconstructed data). A theoretical dependence (close to
linear) has been established between PAR and SR, conﬁrmed later by experimental
measurements in the region of Kansas (Sellers et al. 1995, 1996, 1997). A minimum
and maximum of FPAR are determined experimentally, and the ﬁnal relationship
becomes
PAR ¼ SR  SRi;min


 PARmax  PARmin
ð
Þ
SRi;max  SRi;min


ð8:6Þ
where PARmax = 0.950, PARmin = 0.001, but in general, PARmax and PARmin depend
on the type of vegetation; SRi;max and SRi;min can be calculated from NDVI, based
on experimental data.
Sellers et al. (1996) use the P parameter reﬂecting an amount of vegetation
cellulose taking part in the process of photosynthesis. The P parameter changes
from 0 (lack of vegetation) to 1:5 for bushy species rich in photic vegetation
cellulose and can be approximately estimated as
P  PAR
k
where k is the coefﬁcient of attenuation for PAR averaged in time.
Apart from spectral characteristics, Sellers et al. (1996) considered the photic
characteristic (green leaf area index Lg) and the photic share (green part N) for a
8.3

concrete vegetation species. Many authors derived dependences of Lg on FPAR for
species growing separately and in groups. The result can be presented in the form
Lg ¼ 1  Fcl
ð
Þ Lg;i;max
log 1  PAR
ð
Þ
log 1  PARmax
ð
Þ þ Fcl
Lg;i;max PAR
PARmax
where Fd is the share of bushy vegetation determined for each of the vegetation
classes Ls.
The photic share N of vegetation species can be obtained from the following
considerations. The plant canopy consists both of leaves matter (Lg) participating in
the process of photosynthesis and of the trunk cellulose Ls (0.076 for forests, 0.05
for meadows and pastures) as well as a dead fraction Ld. The dead cellulose is
supposed to remain in the leaf canopy for about a month before leaf falling or
another means of extraction. Thus, the photic share of vegetation cellulose is
determined as N = Lg/LT, where LT ¼ Ls þ Ld þ Lg; Ld is the dead fraction of
vegetation cellulose, Ld  0 ; Lg is the photic fraction determined from PAR; LT is
the total territorial characteristic of a vegetation species; Ls is the fraction of the
trunk cellulose.
8.3.6 A Model of Leaf Canopy Photosynthesis
In the model of the biosphere (SiB2) derived by Sellers et al. (1996) there are
equations which determine temperatures, humidity, and evaporation for vegetation
canopy and a 3-layer soil cover. Apart from this, a model of radiative transfer (soil–
leaf canopy–atmosphere) and a model of photosynthesis were synthesized. The
model of the leaf canopy photosynthesis considers a 1-layer vegetation species,
surface and root layers, as well as the zone of re-charging. Equations of the bio-
spheric model SiB2 are based on the concept of ﬂux exchange in the system “soil–
leaf canopy–atmosphere” (resistance r and conductivity g are associated by: r = 1/g).
The ﬂux in this case is determined by analogy with the electrostatic form
Flux ¼ Potentials difference
Resistance
Sellers et al. (1996) considered the ﬂuxes of sensible and latent heat transport
through evaporation of water vapor from vegetation canopy kEc and the surface soil
layer, as well as the CO2 ﬂux (Ac and RSOIL for soil). The potentials differences
connected with the ﬂuxes are presented in the form of differences of temperatures,
pressures, and partial pressure of CO2 for heat transport, latent heat transport, and
CO2, respectively. In the model of photosynthesis of interest are CO2 ﬂuxes (Ac and
RSOIL) and the ﬂux of latent heat exchange λEc of leaf canopy and its respiration
constituent λEct.

Ecoinformatics and Soil-Plant Formations

The model of the leaf canopy photosynthesis derived by Collatz et al. (1990) for
vegetation species of classes C3 and C4 together with the bud model (Ball 1988)
have been used to derive the biospheric model SiB2. In this model, photosynthesis
and Greenhouse conductivity are closely connected (Sellers et al. 1996).
According to Collatz et al. (1991), there are three factors limiting the plant
photosynthesis intensity. These are an efﬁciency of the photosynthetic ferment
system wc (the so-called limitation after Rubisco), an amount of PAR absorbed by
cellulose chlorophyll we, and an ability of a vegetation species to assimilate and
emit to the environment the products of photosynthesis ws. As a result, the value of
photosynthesis intensity A is a minimum of the three limitations enumerated above:
A  min wc; we; ws
ð
Þ
where A is the photosynthesis intensity (mol/m2s); wc is a Rubisco (ferment) lim-
itation of photosynthesis intensity (mol/m2s); we is a limitation of assimilation by
illumination (mol/m2s); ws is a limitation of carbon content for a vegetation species
(mol/m2s).
The physiological limitation of assimilation wc is a function of the ferment
supplies of species, in other words, it is an ability of cellulose to realize the bio-
chemical reactions. The ferment reserve of the plant is described in the model with
the Vmax parameters, a maximum catalytic supply of ferments (Rubisco) taking part
in photosynthesis. The wc value also depends on the leaf canopy temperature and
soil moisture. Collatz et al. (1990) suggested the following expression for wc for
vegetation classes C3 and C4:
wc ¼ Vm
ci  C
ci þ Kcð1 þ O2=KoÞ


; for C3;
wc ¼ Vm; for C4;
where Vm is a maximum catalytic supply of ferments (Rubisco) (mol/m2/s); ci is the
partial pressure of CO2 in the leaf (Pa); O2 is the partial pressure of O2 in the leaf
(Pa); C is the point of CO2 compensation (Pa) = O2/S; S is a special interaction
between CO2 and O2; Kc is the Michaelis—Menten constant for CO2, (Pa); Ko is
the constant of O2 suppression (inhibition).
The Vm parameter is expressed through Vmax, the function of dependence on the
soil temperature and moisture. The S, Kc, Ko parameters are functions of
temperature.
A limitation of assimilation intensity we is described as follows:
we ¼ ðFp  nÞe3ð1  xpÞ ci  C
ci þ 2C


; for C3;
we ¼ ðFp  nÞe4ð1  xpÞ ; for C4;
8.3

663

where Fp is a PAR vector (W/m2); n is the normal to the leaf surface; e3;4 is
quantum efﬁciency of CO2 assimilation (mol); xp is the dispersion coefﬁcient for
PAR.
The third limitation ws is written as:
ws ¼
Vm=2 for C3;
Vmp=2 for C4

where p is atmospheric pressure (Pa).
The photosynthesis intensity A as a minimum of functions wc, we, and ws is
estimated in a simplest way, but observations show that the transition from one
limitation to another is not that spasmodic. Therefore Collatz et al. (1992) proposed
a method of combining the contributions of all the three limitations in the form of
two equations, which have to be solved with the least values:
bcew2
p  wp wc þ we
ð
Þ þ wewc ¼ 0;
bpsA2  A wp þ ws


þ wpws ¼ 0;
where βce and βps are coefﬁcients of correlation; wp is a “smoothed” minimum
between wc and we, (mol/m2s).
Theoretically βce and βps can have values from unity (lack of relationships
between limitations) to zero. Real estimates vary from 0.8 to 0.99.
Pure assimilation of CO2 by a plant An is equal to An = A −Rd, where Rd is CO2
losses resulting from respiration connected with the content of carboxylase in
cellulose: Rd = fdVm where fd = 0.015 for C3, fd = 0.025 for C4.
The connection of the Collatz model of photosynthesis with the Ball semi-
empirical model of vegetation bud conductivity is written as
gs ¼ m An
cs
hsp þ b
where gs is the vegetation bud conductivity (mol/m2s); gs m/s
ð

; m is an empirical coefﬁcient (=9 for vegetation of class C3, =4 for
C4, =6 for coniferous forests); b is an empirical coefﬁcient (mol/m2/s or m/s, =0.01
for C3, =0.04 for C4); hs is a relative moisture of the leaf surface; cs is the CO2
partial pressure in the stem, (Pa); p is atmospheric pressure (Pa); p0 is the normal
atmospheric pressure
¼1:013 	 105Pa


; Tf is the absolute zero temperature
(=273.16 °K).
There is a relationship between partial pressure of CO2 (ci, cs) and relative
humidity hs. This dependence can be obtained by the analysis of the processes

Equations of the photosynthesis-conductivity model describe the processes
taking place in a vegetation bud, and the next step is to integrate the relationships
with respect to a leaf canopy to obtain total values of Ac and gc. This was made in
Sellers et al. (1996) with a supposition that the vertical distribution of vegetation
ferments in the canopy is connected with the time-averaged distribution of PAR:

where VmaxL; Vmax0 are the Vmax values on the level LAI = L and at the top of the

averaged k value instead of the instant k value leads to only negligible uncertainties
in calculations.
Since now the wc, we, and ws parameters are connected (depending on the
vertical coordinate) with LAI of the leaf canopy through an exponent, it is possible
to use them to obtain an integral estimate of Ac. We have already discussed the
difference of bushy and separately growing species (V < 1) and the notion of the
photic share (N < 1). Therefore bearing in mind that in the case of dense thickets the
photosynthesis intensity is reduced due to the lack of “green”, rich-in-ferment
vegetation material, and the integration is realized from 0 to LT/V:

These correlations give the opportunity to calculate the energy ﬂuxes in a
multi-layer structure of the system “atmosphere-plant-soil”. As a result, one can
specify the elements of the climate models, and to assess from the space-borne
monitoring data the impact of surface vegetation on the synoptic situation. This is
especially important in arid and over-humid zones where the state of vegetation
cover strongly depends on small changes of temperature and other meteorological
parameters. Another important conclusion from these correlations can be drawn
for the study of the effect of vegetation cover on the processes of CO2 assimilation
from the atmosphere. Clearly, the use of such models increases the adequacy of
the global carbon cycle modeling.
8.3.7 Modeling the Forest Age Structure
Seppelt and Voinov (2002, 2003) proposed two-stage procedure for the age
structure modeling of the forest ecosystem. The ﬁrst stage uses the simulator and
model for the parameterization of carbon balance and heterotrophic ecosystem
transpiration only for stand of isolated tree. The second stage synthesizes regional

model of carbon balance for the whole of the forest ecosystem taking into account
the eight levels of carbon reservoirs (Table 8.5). The model allows the consider-
ation of stratiﬁed physical soil structure taking into account the erosion and
deposition processes. Two-stage procedure includes sub-blocks that describe:
• circulation of biogenic salts in the plant-soil system (grass ecosystems, agri-
cultural ﬁelds, forests, and savannas),
• decomposition of the soil organic matter,
• formation of the forest ecosystem production,
• water balance of the vegetation-soil system, and
• ﬂows of the carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulphur.

Intensive anthropogenic exploitation of the forests changes their age structure.

8.3.8 Modeling the Production Processes in the Coniferous
Forest
It is evident that coniferous forests play an important role in the global carbon cycle.
Therefore in this section we shall consider a parameterization of the production
process in the forest ecosystem with the pine forest stand of one age proposed and
developed by Kirilenko (1990) for practical use in climate models. The model
reﬂects correlations of mean annual and seasonal processes without consideration of
the succession of vegetation communities. It describes the dynamics of carbon and
water in the ecosystem using a system of ﬁve ordinary differential equations, one
partial differential equation, and many algebraic equations reﬂecting the biotic and
abiotic processes in the coniferous forest.
The model includes the following values: phase derivatives, input (external) and
output (internal) derivatives, as well as parameters (constants, coefﬁcients).
The phase derivatives include (kg/m2 of soil):
• carbon of the structural mass of young pine-needles m1 and old ones m2,
mL = m1 + m2;
• carbon of the above ground parts of the grown trees (branches, boughs, trunks)
and growing roots m3.
• carbon of thin roots m4;
• fund of mobile carbon assimilates m5;
The input variables characterize the environmental conditions:
• the incoming solar radiation intensity E;
• air temperature T and humidity H;
• length of the light period of day τ;
• daily amount of precipitation P; and
• concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere Co.
8.3
Modeling the Vegetation Dynamics
671

The output variables are photosynthesis, average height and diameter of trees,
transpiration, respiration, increment of the tree’s organs, and other characteristics of
the coniferous forest ecosystem calculated in the model.
The biomass of the phase variables in the model is measured in carbon units, and
the respective scheme of carbon ﬂuxes is shown in Fig. 8.12. The notations for
dynamic equations are the following:
• s3 (m3) is the area of the trunks per m2 of soil;
• θi (τB) is the function of distribution of assimilates, that is, the share of the fund
of assimilates spent on the increment of the ith organ;
• τB is the biological time;
• di is the share of the dead biomass of the ith organ (i = 1, …, 4);
• F is a photosynthesis value;
• ri is the respiration intensity of the growth of the ith organ; and
• pi is the respiration intensity of the maintenance of the ith organ.
The process of photosynthesis can be parameterized using the Chartier formula:

thesis per unit mass of pine-needles changes negligibly, and therefore we shall
consider some point, averaged over the tree height, for which the intensity of the
photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is determined by the Beer-Lambert law:
E ¼ jEEe exp 0:5KehSLH1


where Ee is the intensity of the incoming solar radiation over the forest, κE is the
share of PAR in the total solar radiation; Ke is the coefﬁcient of extinction.
Assuming that the temperature of pine-needles coincides with that of the
atmosphere (TL = T), we use the following approximation for the σ(T) function:

where the parameter l = 1.8; T1 is a minimum temperature at which the photo-
synthesis still takes place; T0 is a temperature optimal for photosynthesis.

With a short-term over-moistening of soil the photosynthesis does not decrease, and
therefore Xð~xSÞ ¼ 1

i coefﬁcient determines the
steepness of the θi function.
The ﬂux of assimilates at a time moment τB into the ith organ of the plant is
equal to m5θi (τB).
Assume that respiration connected with the growth of the ith organ of a tree is
proportional to the rate of its increment and equal to ridmi/dt, and the respiration for
maintenance of leaves and sucking roots is proportional to their mass and equal to
pimi (i = 1, 2, 4). The pi coefﬁcient depends on temperature:

The water cycle in a tree is described by a system of equations that parameterize
the water motion over the territory, in soil, in a tree and its elements. The water is
one of the limiting factors of the tree’s growth through a value of the stomatal
resistance that affects the photosynthetic activity of plants. The water cycle on the
forest territory is the sum of two basic parts—abiotic and biotic, which describe the
processes of water motion in soil and its absorption by the root system, its motion in
the plant, and transpiration. There are a lot of models of these processes. The
difference between them is determined by different suppositions about the character
of the soil structure and the location of the root system. Kirilenko (1990) proposed
to describe the water motion in the soil with an equation that generalizes the Darsi

is the rate of water absorption by roots from the soil.
Water from the root system moves upward along the trunk, through branches
into leaves and evaporates into the atmosphere. It is assumed that an amount of the
moisture from respiration is equal to that assimilated by the root system, and the
rate of motion is equal to v. The integral effect of the impact of the coniferous forest
on water cycle in its territory is the sum of the effects of each tree. The practical
application of the developed model requires information about spatial heteroge-
neities and distributions of the characteristics of the forest stand. An application of
the model to deciduous and mixed forest systems requires additional units which
would describe the processes of the transformation of water potentials as well as
carbon cycle in leaves. Intensive studies are being carried out in this direction.
8.3.9 Modeling Succession Processes in the Tundra-Taiga
System
Predicting the northern boundary of forests has become problematical as a conse-
quence of worldwide anthropogenic processes and the way in which their effects are
inexorably propagating towards northern latitudes. Connections between the
8.3

observed propagation of this boundary and forest ﬁres, reindeers’ grazing,
anthropogenic transformations, and climate change have been widely discussed in
scientiﬁc bibliography (Ji and Stocker 2003; Kondratyev and Grigoryev 2004).
Various hypotheses have been expressed about correlations between the natural
technogenic processes in the zone of this boundary. For instance, there is the
opinion that forest ﬁres can inﬂuence the northward propagation of the birch forests.
This can lead to considerable changes in the natives’ habitation and the reindeers’
propagation. In the late 20th century some disagreements were observed between
forestry and deer-breeding. Thus, in Finland the areas of the reindeers’ propagation
moves 400–500 km south from the boundary of the forests, that is, up to the boreal
zone. In other words, a change of the forest boundary is followed by a change of the
soil layer, and this, due to shifts in biogeocenotic cycles, can direct the succession
of the northern boundary of forests in an unpredicted direction. Moreover, this
prediction, based on the pre-history of the development of this boundary in natural
conditions, cannot be reliable. Therefore the use of the methods of eco-informatics
with its models and technologies of monitoring is now a single adequate method for
predicted estimates of the dynamics of the northern forests boundary. As far as this
is concerned, a lot of ecological problems appear, and thus the following is
necessary:
• combining various elements of the forest ecosystems in the zone of the northern
boundary of the forests (reasons for the presence or absence of some type of
trees);
• the role of various diseases of the northern forests and their sensitivity to climate
changes and other external factors;
• the role of ﬁres and their location and power in the change of the structure and
conﬁguration of the transfer boundary between forests and tundra;
• the role of insects with an account of the dependence of their propagation and
the biomass on climate change in the dynamics of the northern forests boundary;
• patterns of scattering the seeds of various plants in the zone of the forests
northern boundary and their effect on its dynamics; and
• the impact of the dynamics of the forests northern boundary on the wild ani-
mals’ migration and their habitat.
An expected climate warming can result in the substitution of some vegetation
ecosystems for others (exogenic succession). It will be especially manifested in
high latitudes where taiga transforms into tundra. Bogatyrev (1988) proposed a
model, which parameterizes the transformation processes in the tundra-taiga system
and makes it possible to reveal some important regularities. The phase variables are
the biomass of moss (X1), vegetation of the grass-bush level (X2), conifers (X3),
forest cover (X4), and dead organic matter of soil (X5). The phase variables are
measured in tons of carbon per unit area (t/ha), and their spatial distribution is
assumed to be uniform. The carbon ﬂux scheme is given in Fig. 8.13.

where Fi coefﬁcients express the dependence of the biomass increment on its type
(the characteristic indicators of vegetation), φi functions assign the laws of changes
in the biomass increment as a function of atmospheric temperature beneath the
canopy TM, and the Gi, fi and Hi functions describe deviations of the annual biomass
increment from a maximum level at a given temperature TM due to a deﬁcit of
illumination, an amount of mineral resource in the soil, and moisture, respectively.
For trees, the annual production also depends on their biomass, and this dependence
is represented with the χ function. For vegetation of the grass-bush level and the
moss, their annual increment is supposed to be independent of their biomass.

8.4 Wildﬁres as Components of Global Ecodynamics
8.4.1 Fires and Forest Ecosystem
Fires play a substantial role in the formation of forest ecosystems. Moreover, it can
be stated that they are an integral element of their development. Fire in a forest can
be caused either by a lightning stroke or anthropogenically. From available esti-
mates, the frequency of lightning strokes in tropical forests reaches 50 per km2
annually. In the moderate-zone forests this quantity is less and constitutes 2–5
678
8

strokes per km2 annually. Of course, not every stroke leads to a forest ﬁre. Nev-
ertheless, in different regions of land, lightning strokes lead to 2–30 % of forest
ﬁres.
During the historical period, geography and quantity of ﬁres had been changing,
but their role in the formation of forest landscapes has remained constant. Many
species of trees, such as pine, larch, birch, and aspen had a pyrogenic period in their
development. Owing to ﬁres these species have preserved their natural habitats and
had not been ousted by spruce, cedar, and ﬁr. In the process of evolution, the light-
demanding species have become ﬁre resistant due to, for instance, the thick bark
and deep root system of the larch and pine, and the birch and aspen’s ability to give
rich shoots from the roots after a ﬁre. Some species of American pines exhibit
protective reaction. For instance, they open their cones only after a ﬁre, when
conditions for seeds’ sprouting are favorable.
Some investigators believe in an objective idea according to which practically all
current taiga forests in Russia had been changing due to ﬁres (Furiayev 1996).
Present studies make it possible to conﬁrm the above-said with respect to taiga
forests in the historical and pre-historical past. This is conﬁrmed, in particular, by
paleoecological developments carried out in the USA and Finland. Studies of ﬁres
using the method of pollen analysis and of traces of burning ﬁxed in stratiﬁed lake
deposits in eastern Finland testify to a large scale of ﬁres. During the last
2,100 years, ﬁres have been an integral factor of development of the taiga forests in
this region. The repeatability of large-scale ﬁres in eastern Finland varies from 7–
110 to 130–180 years. It was noticed that ﬁres became more frequent after 600 AD,
when the impact of humans on forests became stronger.
According to calculations of Kurbatsky (1964), in the early Holocene there had
been several thousands of forest ﬁres caused by lightning strokes. Of course, a
human had also played a substantial role in the origin of ﬁres in the forest eco-
systems (ﬁrst due to carelessness with ﬁre, and then as a result of loosing control of
ﬁre during propagation of the slash-and-burn method used to clear the forests for
agriculture). In the 1950s, on all continents, about 200,000 forest ﬁres happened
every year, with 3 % of this quantity having been caused by lightning strokes. It is
not excluded that all forest ecosystems of the planet in the historical and pre-
historical past had suffered from ﬁre. There had long been a version of the pyro-
genic origin of the present savannas over a vast territory of the Hindustan Penin-
sula, considered to have propagated in place of the burned tropical forests.
Thus, the problem of forest ﬁres has two sides—negative and positive. The
negative side is connected with apparent damage to forest ecosystems and eco-
nomic losses for humans. The positive aspect consists in the evolutionary role of
forest ﬁres. For instance, the post-ﬁre renewal of pine forests over vast territories is
known to take place easily and rapidly compared to clearings during which the
seeds get destroyed. At the ﬁre-sites where the seeds have not been destroyed,
shoots and underwood appear rapidly and all together. Moreover, in different global
regions, an increase of the post-ﬁre productivity of forest ecosystems has been
observed. In particular, it was found out that in the regions of Slovenian Karst and
Istria at the south-west of the Republic Slovenia, the ﬁres that happened there
8.4
Wildﬁres as Components of Global Ecodynamics
679

affected the species composition of plants (Grigoryev and Kondratyev 2005).
Immediately after the ﬁre, the diversity of species and living forms grows even
more rapidly, but in the course of the age succession to initial forest composition,
this diversity decreases.
Restoration of forest communities depends on the frequency and intensity of
ﬁres. In the Siberian taiga forests relatively frequent ﬁres of low intensity cause
changes in the age and quality of forest stands. Changes of forest planting are
connected with intensive but rare ﬁres. Studies of the post-ﬁre dynamics of forest
ecosystems at the Far East of Russia show that successions of forest vegetation are
connected with ﬁres (Efremov and Sapozhnikov 1997). At the same time, it was
shown that ﬁres are a needed element to maintain biodiversity.
The post-ﬁre regeneration of forest ecosystems depends on many factors (cli-
mate, soil, rocks composition, relief, etc.). In deciduous forests of Siberia, with its
permafrost, the shrub and grass-shrub tiers are restored in 4–5 years after the ﬁre,
while moss and lichen grow much slower.
Sometimes the ﬁres affect positively the soil component of the forest ecosystem
and, in particular, promote the preservation and provision of soil with nitrogen,
which is known to play an important role in forest ecosystems’ productivity. This
effect has been found out by the scientists from the Montana University in Missoula
in the forests of the western part of Montana (Newland and De Luca 2000). Local
forests with prevailing yellow pine and Douglas ﬁr develop better in the case of
abundant nitrogen-ﬁxing plants and due to this, sufﬁcient content of nitrogen in soil.
It was found out that these plants are very important as a factor of compensation of
nitrogen, when the forest ecosystems loose it after the ﬁres. In the absence of ﬁres,
the quantity of nitrogen-ﬁxing plants decreases, and further on the forest structure
changes drastically. On the contrary, periodic ﬁres in the forests of yellow pine and
Douglas ﬁr, broaden the propagation of nitrogen-ﬁxing plants and favor the forest
ecosystems’ productivity, on the whole.
As mentioned above, one of the manifestations of the anthropogenic interference
into the forest ecosystems’ dynamics is forest burning down for subsequent land use
in agriculture. As Krimmer and Lake (2001) have shown, the controlled burning-
down of forests maintains their landscape mosaic and promotes the preservation of
biodiversity, as well as raises the forest ecodynamics’ productivity. From obser-
vations of Hoffmann (1998), in savannas serrado in Brazil, the productivity of the
ecosystem of 3 species of trees, two species of shrubs and one species of subshrub
increased 4–7 times after the burning. Clearly, the burning of the forest sites by
natives should be attributed to the means of their harmonious co-existence with
nature, and the planned burning of forests should be carried out on a scientiﬁc basis
and considered as an element of land use optimization (precisely, forest-use). The
problem of the balanced use of positive and negative consequences of a forest ﬁre
remains unsolved.
One of the main problems of the forestry science is earlier detection of the ﬁre
hazard areas. As it was shown in Chap. 1 of this book a solution of this problem can
680
8
Ecoinformatics and Soil-Plant Formations

be realized by the RIMS with its location on a ﬂying laboratory. An assessment of
the moisture soil content allows the evaluation of the forest ﬁre hazard level.
Examples of such experiments are given in Figs. 8.14 and 8.15. Bonafoni et al.
(2011) deals with passive microwave imaging for ﬁre detection by means of a
single-channel ground-based radiometer. The simulation of images sensed in the
presence of ﬁre spots under different environmental and operative conditions is
presented. A low-cost ground-based radiometer operating at 12.65 GHz was used.
Scenarios where ﬁres are un-visible and IR sensors are not useful with respect to a
microwave imager were investigated in deep, such as in the presence of vegetation
canopy optically masking ﬁre sources and smoke plumes in the early stage. These
simulations allow the assessment of limits and capabilities of microwave imaging
for the identiﬁcation of little ﬁres masked by forest areas. With regard to forest
areas, the proposed simulations have the aim to establish performances and limits in
the identiﬁcation capability of little ﬁres by means of microwave radiometry. It has
been seen that the radiometric contrast can be computed as the difference between
two successive scans of the same area.

8.4.2 Wildﬁres, Dynamics of the Biosphere, and Climate
Poorly studied positive and negative feedbacks of forest ﬁres makes it impossible to
draw the ﬁnal conclusions about their role in the global eco-dynamics. Positive
feedbacks mentioned above can be supplemented with facts indicating the opposite
post-ﬁre trends in the ecosystems’ dynamics. Numerous results of numerical
modeling show that the tropical deforestation results in changes of albedo, land
surface roughness, leaf area index, and root zone depth, which lead to a decrease of
rain rate and relative humidity, but to an increase of SAT and wind speed. Global
consequences of such changes will depend on the ratio of scales of reduction of
forest areas and measures taken to protect nature. Preliminary results of modeling
these consequences obtained by Hoffmann et al. (2003), with the use of the
atmospheric general circulation model, CCM 3.2, and data of remote sensing,
revealed a decrease of rains and relative humidity during the ﬁres in the Amazon
basin. The empirical connection between the scales of desertiﬁcation in the regions
of Amazon, Congo, and Indonesia and the frequency of forest ﬁres, established
from the NOAA-12 satellite measurements, revealed a dependence of the index of
the ﬁre risk of the territory on their frequency. This means that forest ﬁres directly
affect a climate change, which leads to a change of their frequency of occurrence.
This interactivity makes it possible to search a regime of forests regulation which

would reduce the level of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and exclude an
undesirable climate change.
It is supposed that boreal forests are a region for carbon sink. However, their
ﬁres can transform boreal forests into sources of carbon due to direct emissions of
carbon during biomass burning and indirect impacts of ﬁres on the thermal and
water regimes, as well as the structure and functioning of the ecosystems. The
frequency of ﬁres in boreal forests during the last several decades has increased and
can increase further under conditions of continuing global climate warming. Thus,
this should lead to a shorter time period of ecosystems’ recovery in the periods
between the ﬁres and to enhancing emissions of GHGs to the atmosphere. The CO2
ﬂux from the ground Rs ¼ HC
7 þ HC
8 þ HC
9 þ HC
15 (see Fig. 1.30) is a second
important ﬂux of carbon in boreal forests which determines its role in the formation
of the global carbon cycle. The Rs value changes due to different processes:
• ﬁres lead to a partial removal of vegetation cover and a decrease of soil surface
albedo (the latter determines an increase of surface temperature and the rate of
decomposition of vegetation remains);
• a ﬁre breaks the process of accumulation of organic matter in soil and changes
the balance between the input of detritus and heterotrophic respiration (as a
result of a great input of detritus);
• a ﬁre brings forth changes of vegetation succession and composition of its
species as well as litter quality.
To better understand the impact of forest ﬁres on the carbon cycle in boreal
forests, Wang et al. (2003) performed measurements and numerical modeling of Rs
for black spruce (Picea mariana) with post-ﬁre chronological succession for seven
forest ﬁres in the north of the Manitoba Province (Canada), under conditions of
good and poor drainage of soils as an example. Studies have been aimed at:
i. a quantitative characteristic of the dependence of Rs on soil temperature for
forests of different age;
ii. study of the post-ﬁre succession dynamics of forest stands; and
iii. estimating the annual CO2 ﬂux from soil surface.
The CO2 ﬂux depended strongly on conditions of drainage and age of the forest
stand. There was a positive correlation of CO2 ﬂux with soil temperature (=0.78),
with results of numerical modeling of the ﬂux differing strongly depending on a
combination of the level of drainage and age of the forest stand. In the period of the
vegetation development season the CO2 ﬂux from a well drained soil was much
greater than from a poorly drained one. The annual mean values of the CO2 ﬂux
from the soil in different years constituted 244 (the year 1870), 274 (1930), 350
(1964), 413 (1981), 357 (1989), 412 (1995), and 226 gC m−2year−1 (1998). Under
conditions of well drained soils the numbers above become 264, 233, 256, 303,
300, 380, respectively, while 146 gC m−2 year−1 in the case of poorly drained soils.
In the winter (from 1 November to 30 April) the values of CO2 ﬂux varied within
5–19 % with respect to the annual ﬂux. Apparently, a decrease of the ﬂux at the
8.4
Wildﬁres as Components of Global Ecodynamics
683

post-ﬁre sites was determined mainly by the decreasing level of respiration due to
the trees’ roots.
In the course of all chronological succession of ﬁres considered, the CO2 ﬂuxes
from soil changed almost twofold at reaching maximum values before joining of the
trees’ crowns, when the soil was the warmest and an accumulation took place of
both ground and sub-ground biomass. The observed decrease of CO2 ﬂux in the
case of older forest stands can be explained by a lower soil temperature, which is
determined by an accumulated heat-isolating organic substance and other factors.
Boreal forests cover the territory of about 14 million km2 in the circumpolar
latitudinal band 50–70°N, which constitutes *10 % of the global land surface.
These forests contain disproportionately large amounts of soil carbon because of
climatic conditions which are unfavorable for the processes of organics decom-
position. The annual mean temperature in boreal forests is close to 0 °C with a
weakly drained soil explained by prevailing lowlands. The characteristic features of
the considered latitudinal band are widespread permafrost and isolation of deep
ground horizons from summertime heating because of moss and thin roots which
burn in forest ﬁres but restore during decades. This heat-insulation favors the
preservations of permafrost, which complicates the soil drainage and slows down
the processes of decomposition of organic matter stored in deep soil layers beneath
the moss layer. Intensiﬁcation of respiration due to deep layers measured in July
and August 1996 reached *10 kgC ha−1 day−1. This enhancement of respiration
correlates with an increase of the deep layers temperature. Thus, organic matter of
deep layers of the soil is characterized by lability with a low rate of decomposition
connected with low temperature.
The data above show that it is necessary to extend the parametric descriptions of
the Rs ﬂux components, apparently not only for forested territories but also for other
soil-plant biomes in order to raise the accuracy of estimates of sinks and sources of
CO2 on land. Smith et al. (2003) carried out measurements of CO2 ﬂuxes under
conditions of mountain ecosystem of the steppe wormwood in the south-eastern
part of Wyoming and found out that the difference between CO2 ﬂuxes measured at
different time of day reached 9 %, and that even under conditions of homogeneous
vegetation cover the temporal variability of CO2 ﬂuxes between the ecosystem and
the atmosphere is substantial.
An important consequence of forest ﬁres is the ﬁre-induced changes of
atmospheric chemistry due to GHGs
emissions. For instance, large-scale forest
ﬁres in September–November 1997 in Indonesia, Malaysia and Papua-New Guinea
resulted in about 130 TgCO emitted to the atmosphere, which changed the ozone
concentration by 10 %. The GHGs emitted to the atmosphere propagated over vast
territories, and the total content of CO in December grew by 10–20 % in the
latitudinal band 30°N–45°S, by 5–10 %—south of 45°S, and <5 %—north of 45°N.
On the whole, global emission of GHGs in biomass burning reached 38–
4,300 TgC year−1 with a very small contribution due to ﬁres in boreal forests
(23 TgC year−1, or 0.6 %). Emissions of GHGs to the atmosphere due to ﬁres in
boreal forests in 1998 constituted 290–383 Tg (total carbon), 828–1,105 Tg(CO2),
88–128 Tg(CO), and 2.9–4.7 Tg(CH4). The upper level of these estimates
684
8
Ecoinformatics and Soil-Plant Formations

corresponds to 8.9 % of total global emissions of carbon due to biomass burning;
13.8 % of global CO emissions due to forest ﬁres, and 12.4 % of global Global
emissions of methane due to ﬁres. The contribution of forest ﬁres in Russia con-
stituted 78 % of total emissions
(19 % is the share of North America). The
contribution of peat-bog ﬁres at Far East to carbon input to the atmosphere in the
fall of 1998 reached 40 TgC.
A relative impact of ﬁres on the chemical composition of the troposphere was
weaker in the Northern Hemisphere, where the background CO content was greater
than in the Southern Hemisphere. The radiative forcing at the surface level reached
10 W m−2 over most of the tropical Indian Ocean, and 150 W m−2 in the regions of
forest ﬁres in Indonesia. Thus, forest ﬁres turned out to be an important factor of the
impact on the radiative regime in the tropics. About 700 TgC were emitted to the
atmosphere, which constituted 3–4 % of carbon supplies in the peat bogs of
Indonesia. All this testiﬁes to a necessity of a detailed analysis of consequences of
forest ﬁres and search of strategy of their control. One of the perspective which
approaches to solution of this problem is the use of satellite systems with micro-
wave radiometers, which will make it possible to control, on global scales, the
moisture content of forest and to determine thereby the level of their ﬁre risk.
8.4.3 Biomass Burning and Atmospheric Chemistry
Biomass burning is one of the most substantial sources of the input of many GHGs
to the atmosphere. This process takes place both during a forest ﬁre and in burning
the wood remains when logging or in agriculture. Therefore the control of
the seasonal and inter-annual variability of biomass burning is important for the
estimation of GHGs emissions and the calculation of radiation budget variability.
Duncan et al. (2003) proposed a method of control with the use of the satellite
scanning radiometer ASTR. The results of measurements in the period 1979–2000
in south-western Asia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brazil, Mexico, Central America,
Canada, Alaska, and the Asian part of Russia did not reveal any long-term trend of
CO emissions in forest ﬁres, but revealed a clear inter-annual variability. The
annual volume of CO emission in the indicated regions changes from 2 (the Asian
part of Russia and China) to 20 Tg year−1 (Indonesia and Malaysia) with average
global total emissions of 437 TgC year−1 (annual values varied from 429 to
565 TgC year−1).
In 1987, in the USA the long-term program was launched to study the spatial-
temporal variability of CO concentration in the troposphere. Initial air samples
taken in the marine atmospheric boundary layer to analyze the concentration of CO2
and methane were also used to measure the CO concentration. During the last
decade, the scientists of the NOAA Climate Modeling and Diagnostics Laboratory
carried out an analysis of air samples to estimate the CO concentration from the
data of observations at the global network. It follows from the results obtained that
the short-term periods of increasing or decreasing CO concentration were
8.4
Wildﬁres as Components of Global Ecodynamics
685

superimposed, on the long-term decreasing trend of CO concentration in the tro-
posphere, observed in the 1990s. It turned out that the instability of standard
samples used for calibration determined the systematic underestimation of the
observed CO concentration. Novelli et al. (2003) showed that the decrease of
tropospheric CO is conﬁned mainly to the Northern Hemisphere, where emissions
to the atmosphere due to fossil fuel burning were substantially lower, constituting
1.8 ± 0.2 ppb year−1. In the Southern Hemisphere, between 1991 and 2001, this
trend was not observed.
The globally averaged CO concentration is characterized by a strong interannual
variability explained mainly by interannual changes of the scale of biomass burn-
ing. During the whole period of observations, the globally averaged CO concen-
tration was decreasing by about 0.5 ppb year−1; this decrease was mainly
concentrated north of 30°N. A strong increase of CO content in the troposphere
observed in 1997–1998 was connected with the impact of unusually widespread
and intensive forest ﬁres; more that 300 TgCO were emitted to the troposphere
because of ﬁres. In the years of large-scale ﬁres in boreal forests, such emissions can
cause changes of the dynamics of redox reactions in the troposphere on global
scales.
Wet tropical forests in the Amazon basin play a special role in the global eco-
dynamics due to huge sizes of their territory (about 5 × 106 km2) and high biotic
activity. Here all-the-year-round emissions to the atmosphere of natural biogenic
aerosol take place both of primary (micro-organisms, pollen, detritus of vegetative
origin) and secondary aerosol appearing due to gas-to-particles transformation of
organic, nitrogen- and sulphur-containing GHGs emitted to the atmosphere by
plants. In the dry season period, this background aerosol is “suppressed” by smoke
aerosol caused by deforestation and burning of biomass remains.
The processes of intensive convection and advection determine the long-range
transport of both types of aerosol to higher latitudes, with far-reaching conse-
quences from the viewpoint of affecting the chemical reactions in the atmosphere,
as well as the formation of climate and biogeochemical cycles of nutrients. On the
other hand, natural aerosol comes to the Amazon basin from distant regions,
including marine aerosol from the Atlantic Ocean and dust aerosol from Sahara,
which can serve as signiﬁcant nutrients for wet tropical forests. In July 2001, near
the city of Balbina, in the center of the Amazon region, Graham et al. (2003) carried
out measurements of aerosol which showed that the atmosphere contains both
coarse-scale and ﬁne-scale fractions, which consisted of organic compounds by 70
and 80 %, respectively. Coarse-scale aerosols also contained a small amount of soil
dust and sea-salt particles, while ﬁne-scale aerosols contained some amount of non-
marine sulphate. The concentration of coarse-scale aerosol particles averaged
3.9 ± 1.4 μg m−3 with the ratio of nocturnal to daytime values 1.9 ± 0.4, whereas the
concentration of ﬁne-scale aerosols increased in the daytime (an average of
2.6 ± 0.8 μg m−3, with the ratio 0.7 ± 0.1).
Biomass burning during the last decades has increased with the growing pop-
ulation size. The geographical zones of intensive biomass burning have broadened.
Most considerable components of emissions in biomass burning include CO2, CO,
686
8
Ecoinformatics and Soil-Plant Formations

CH4, NH3, HCN, methanol, acidic acid, acetol, and others. The knowledge of the
volumes of emitted aerosols is important to study the consequences of their impact
on the radiation budget and dynamics of ecosystems of land and the World Ocean.
Christian et al. (2003) found out several new components appearing in burning the
African fuels; they are chemically active substances which can take an active part in
oxidation reactions. These substances include acetaldehyde, phenol, acetol,
glycolaldehyde, methylvinilether, furan, acetone, acetonitrile, propylene-nitrile and
propanenitrile. Emissions of chemically active oxidizing volatile organic com-
pounds in the ﬁres in African savannas and in Indonesia constitute 70 and 77 % of
all emitted aerosols, respectively.
Many uncertainties appear in studies of the impact of biomass burning on the
ozone layer, though there is evidence of this impact. In the period 21 January–14
February 1999, when huge amounts of biomass were burned on the western coast of
Africa, sonde measurements of the tropospheric ozone content were carried out on
the scientiﬁc ship along the route from Norfolk (37oN, 76oW) to Cape Town (34°S,
22°E). The earlier conclusion was conﬁrmed: the tropospheric ozone and its pre-
cursors connected with biomass burning were concentrated in the lower troposphere
mainly because of the absence of an intensive convection on land. In the layer
1,000–799 hPa there was a wind-driven transport of ozone and its precursors
towards the equator or west. On the other hand, the effect of the upward adiabatic
motions connected with the diurnal change of the processes in the west-African
planetary atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), could determine the vertical transport
of ozone and its precursors to the free atmosphere over the marine ABL. Besides,
lightning strokes in the regions of South Africa, Central Africa, and meso-scale
convective systems of the Gulf of Guinea could cause an increase of tropospheric
ozone concentration in the middle and upper troposphere of the tropical Atlantic
Ocean in the Southern Hemisphere. At the same time, a decrease of the ozone
content called the “ozone paradox” was recorded in the tropical Atlantic Ocean in
the Southern Hemisphere.
8.4.4 Wildﬁres and Carbon Cycle
Wood remains (WR) are an important component of all forest ecosystems, since
they affect the nutrients’ cycle, humus formation, carbon storage, frequency of
occurrence of forest ﬁres, water cycle, and are a natural habitat for heterotrophic and
autotrophic organisms. Usually the presence of dead trees and WR is left out of
account in the estimation of carbon budgets, though the importance of these carbon
reservoirs as boreal supplies of carbon has recently attracted attention.
Bond-Lamberty et al. (2003) studied the distribution and respiration dynamics of
wood remains under conditions of chronological succession in the ﬁres of boreal
forests consisting mainly of black spruce, in the northern part of the Manitoba
Province (Canada). The considered chronological succession included seven forest
stands that suffered ﬁres in the period 1870–1998. Each of the forest stands was a
8.4
Wildﬁres as Components of Global Ecodynamics
687

separate well or poorly drained site. The WR biomass varied from 1.4 to
177.6 mg ha−1 decreasing, as a rule, with age. Most decayed wood remains were
characterized by a higher humidity, lower density, and higher rate of respiration
compared to the less decayed remains. Depending on the wood remains, estimates
of the annual emissions of carbon varied between 0.11 and 1.92 mgC ha−1year−1.
This study has shown that in modeling the carbon exchange in the atmosphere-
plant-soil system, it is necessary to select a new component that describes the wood
remains (Hoelzemann et al. 2004).
In this connection, the equation of biomass dynamics should contain, at least,
three terms that parameterize photosynthesis, respiration, and dying-off. This will
make it possible to more adequately reﬂect the role of the forest ecosystem in the
change of CO2 exchange between the land cover and the atmosphere, by specifying
the dependences of the indicated components on climate parameters. In particular, it
is known that many boreal ecosystems are sources of carbon in winter and sinks in
summer. This process is controlled by air temperature and day duration. In summer,
in boreal forests during the season of plants’ vegetation, the amount of carbon
absorbed from the atmosphere can reach 80–310 gC m−2, and in winter, carbon
emissions can reach 60–90 gC m−2. The inter-annual variability of the seasonal
exchange of carbon, from estimates of Suni et al. (2003), can constitute from
30 gC m−2 in autumn and spring to 80 gC m−2 in summer.
Yue et al. (2013) studied the forest age dynamics in connection with the role of
ﬁre in the regional forest carbon balance. The vegetation model ORCHIDEE was
used to simulate the CO2 emissions from boreal forest ﬁre and the subsequent
recovery after a stand-replacing ﬁre. Simulation results demonstrate that a global
vegetation model such as ORCHIDEE is able to capture the essential ecosystem
processes in ﬁre-disturbed boreal forests and produces satisfactory results in terms
of both carbon ﬂuxes and carbon-stock evolution after ﬁre. This makes the model
suitable for regional simulations in boreal regions where ﬁre regimes play a key role
in the ecosystem carbon balance. The ORCHIDEE dynamic global vegetation
model represents the land surface features of the IPSL coupled atmosphere-ocean-
vegetation model. ORCHIDEE has been developed using ﬁrst order ecophysio-
logical principles to represent both natural ecosystem and managed land carbon,
water, and energy dynamics across multiple spatial (site to globe) and temporal
(sub-daily to centennial) scales.
One principal question is how does humidity affect forest ﬁre? Humidity has an
important impact on forest ﬁres in two major ways. First, long periods of low
humidity tend to dry out all forest fuels to a dangerous degree. Even a few days of
low humidity can lead to the combustion of steams, branches, foliage, and roots.
Post-ﬁre effect can have short-term and long-term consequences for carbon balance
on the landscape that was affected by wildﬁre.
Goto and Suzuki (2013) studied emissions from forest ﬁres that directly affect
the global and regional carbon cycles by increasing atmospheric carbon as well as
affecting carbon sequestration by forests. It was estimated the release of total car-
bon, carbon-based trace gases (CO2, CO, CH4) and non-methane hydrocarbons
(NMHC) emitted from forest ﬁres in Japan during a 30-year period from 1979

through 2008. The area burnt varied widely from year to year but has gradually
diminished since the 1980s. The mean annual area burnt during this period was
1878 ha. The mean annual estimate of direct carbon emissions from forest ﬁres in
Japan was 15.8 Gg C year−1 and ranged between 2.7 and 60.4 Gg C year−1. The
mean annual trace gas emissions were 49.4 Gg CO2 year−1, 3.4 Gg CO year−1,
0.15 Gg CH4 year−1 and 0.18 Gg NMHC year−1. Although the carbon emissions
varied widely from year to year based on the area burnt, they decreased dramati-
cally from the 1980s onward. The interannual variations in trace gases parallel the
total carbon emissions. The direct emissions from forest ﬁres in Japan were sub-
stantially lower compared with the mean annual net primary production of Japanese
forests or the carbon release in other countries and regions. However, the average
annual carbon released per unit area burnt was comparable to that estimated in other
regions and rose gradually with the increasing age of plantations.
8.4.5 Wildﬁres and Biocomplexity
A wildﬁre is an uncontrolled ﬁre in an area of combustible vegetation. This phe-
nomenon is inseparably linked with biocomplexity of plant community. Wildﬁre
changes a structure of plant community causing the disbalance of ecological pro-
cesses on burned area. One principal indicator of natural ecosystem is the level of
carbon exchange between its elements. Other ecological processes within the
ecosystem correlate with the carbon cycle. In other words, carbon cycle charac-
terizes a level of interactions between all living and plant organisms of ecosystem.
Wildﬁre impacts on the carbon cycle. Carbon ﬂuxes aij between ith and jth eco-
system elements are functions of time t, temperature T, soil moisture W, and solar
energy E. Approximate scheme of carbon ﬂuxes in the forest ecosystem can be
presented by the chart of Fig. 8.16. Certainly, parameter aij can be evaluated by the
relation of C:N or by other alternative model. Somehow or other, biocomplexity
indicator is showing the forest ﬁre consequences. Balance equations for the scheme
of Fig. 8.16 have the following form:

biomass dying are modeled by linear models. In general, the choice of model forms
to parameterize the carbon cycle depends on the existing database about forest
ecosystem parameters and characteristics. Below, the speciﬁc models are

publications (Conant et al. 2011; Chen et al. 1999, 2000; Cocknell et al. 2006). The
results represented in Fig. 8.18 show that biocomplexity is a nonlinear function of
soil moisture.
8.5 The Role of Forests in CO2 Cycle
One of the principal aspects of the anthropogenic impact on the environment is the
evaluation of the consequences of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. Published
results estimating the greenhouse effect and excess CO2 distribution in the bio-
sphere widely vary, sometimes they are contradictory, or too blandly stated. This is
a natural consequence of all kinds of simpliﬁcations adopted in modeling the global
CO2 cycle. The GIMS makes it possible to create an effective monitoring system
allowing the estimation of the spatial distribution of the carbon sinks and sources in
real time.
First of all, some problems should be solved to assess the role of the anthro-
pogenic use of the Earth’s surface. In particular, among these problems there is the
problem of the formalized description of the processes of change of the structure of
the Earth land covers, such as afforestation, forest reconstruction, deforestation and
the associated carbon supplies. Understanding the meteorological processes as
functions of the greenhouse gases is one of the key problems of humankind in the
ﬁrst decade of the third Millennium. Only an adequate knowledge of the meteo-
rological phenomena on various spatial-temporal scales under conditions of varying
supplies of CO2 and other greenhouse gases will enable to make correct and
constructive decisions in the ﬁeld of global environmental protection.
The dynamics of the surface ecosystems depend on interactions between the
biogeochemical cycles, which during the last decade of the 20th century and ﬁrst
decade of the 21st century have suffered signiﬁcant anthropogenic modiﬁcation,
especially to the cycles of carbon, nitrogen, and water. The surface ecosystems, in
which carbon remains in the living biomass, decomposing organic matter, and the soil,
play an important role in the global CO2 cycle. Carbon exchanges between these
reservoirs and the atmosphere take place through photosynthesis, respiration,
decomposition, and burning. Human interference into this process takes place through
changing the structure of the vegetation covers, pollution of the water basin surfaces
and of the soil areas, as well as through direct emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere.
The role of various ecosystems in the formation of carbon supplies to the bio-
spheric reservoirs determines the rate and direction of changes to the regional
meteorological situations and to the global climate. The accuracy of assessment of
the level of these changes depends on the reliability of the data on the inventory of
the surface ecosystems.
Existing environmental data show that knowledge of the rates and trends of
carbon accumulation in the surface ecosystems are rather uncertain. However, it is
clear that the surface ecosystems are important assimilators of excess CO2.
Understanding the details of such assimilation is only possible through modeling
8.4
Wildﬁres as Components of Global Ecodynamics

the process of plant growth; that is, considering the effect of the nutrient elements of
the soil and other biophysical factors on plant photosynthesis. Therefore, the forest
ecosystems and associated processes of natural afforestation, forest reconstruction,
and deforestation should be studied in detail. In a forested area, the volume of the
reservoir of CO2 from the atmosphere is a function of the density of the forest
canopy, and in a given period of time a change of this volume is determined by the
level and character of the dynamic processes of transition of one type of forest into
another. The causes of this transition can be natural, anthropogenic, or mixed.
Biocenology tries to create a universal theory of such transitions, but so far there is
only a qualitative description of the observed transitions.
The land biota and forests particularly is one of the sinks for atmospheric CO2.
Unfortunately, the available data and knowledge of the processes of plants’ res-
piration suggest only rough integrated estimates of CO2 ﬂux in the vegetation
cover. Actually, the role of plant in assimilation of atmospheric CO2 changes
sharply during 24 h and is a complex function of such factors of the environment as
temperature, illumination, and air humidity. Nevertheless, attempts to parameterize
the functions of vegetation made in the GIMS makes it possible to assess the role of
all types of the soil-plant formations in CO2 assimilation (mentioned in Tables 1.2
and 1.3).
The land ecosystem dynamics depends on the interaction of biogeochemical
cycles that were anthropogenically modiﬁed during last decades (e.g., water, car-
bon, and nitrogen). Land ecosystems, the carbon of which is stored in living bio-
mass, soil and decomposed organic matter, play an important role in global CO2
cycle. Carbon is exchanged between these reservoirs and the atmosphere at the
expense of photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition and burning. Human inﬂu-
ence in this process is happened through the change of land cover structure, pol-
lution of surface water reservoirs and soils, as well as through direct CO2 emission
to the atmosphere.
The relation of the role of different ecosystems in the formation of carbon
reserves in the biosphere deﬁnes the speed and direction of changes in regional
meteorological situations and global climate. The precision of the assessment of
these changes depends on the reliability of land ecosystem inventories. This is
justiﬁed by data of Table 8.6 where considerable dispersion of the evaluations of
carbon storage in vegetation of various types gives the possibility to speak about the
importance of more precise classiﬁcation of the land ecosystems.
Table 8.7 illustrates the inﬂuence of afforestation/deforestation processes on the
carbon storage under anthropogenic scenario FAO-2000 where the forest is deﬁned
as the land area equaled to not less than 0.5 ha and covered by trees with height of
more than 5 m the crone of which occupies more than 10 % of area (FAO 2001).
Deforestation is the removal of a forest or stand of trees where the land is thereafter
converted to a non-forest use and crone area is less than 10 % of the total area.
Afforestation is the establishment of a forest or stand of trees in an area where there
was no forest. It is noted that natural expansion of forest is also considered by FAO-
2000 scenario as afforestation. At last, direct artiﬁcial planting of the trees on the
area where forest was earlier moved is considered as afforestation.

Figures 8.10 and 8.11 demonstrate the role of the forest vegetation in the CO2
dynamics. In addition to these results, it must be noted that experiments with global
models make it possible to trace the dependence of the atmospheric gas composition
on the structure of the planetary forest covers. From the available estimates, the total
area of the forests for t0 = 1970 can be estimated at σL0 = σL(t0) ≈40.3–41.84 × 106
km2 (Watson et al. 2000), 1 % constituting national parks and forest reserves. With
the formulated scenario, assume tL = 2050, σX0 = σX(t0) = 19.5 × 106 km2. As seen
from Fig. 8.19, the increasing rate of deforestation raises considerably the concen-
tration of CO2 in the atmosphere. Even with a 10 % reduction of forest areas by 2050
compared to 1970, that is, σL1/σL0 = 0.9, the atmospheric CO2 can increase by 44 %

by the end of the 21st century. On the contrary, a 10 % increase of the forested areas
decreases the concentration of atmospheric CO2 by 15 %. With a 50 % increase of
the forested areas by 2050, a decrease of atmospheric CO2 by 2100 will constitute
60 % relative to its possible value, with the scale of impacts on the forest ecosystems,
observed in the end of the 20th century, preserved. Hence, variations of the forested
areas in the biosphere even within ±10 % can substantially change the dynamics of
numerous components of the global ecosystem.
Table 8.8 exempliﬁes the calculation of the CO2 sinks into the vegetation cover
on the territory of Russia. Such calculations with the use of the global model of the
N-S system demonstrate the dynamics of the CO2 ﬂuxes mosaic in the system
atmosphere-plant-soil. The knowledge of this mosaic makes it possible to assess the
role of concrete types of the soil-plant formations in the regional balance of carbon,
and on this basis, to calculate the global ﬂuxes of carbon dioxide on the atmo-
sphere-land border. Similar calculations are also possible for the atmosphere-ocean
system.
Table 8.9 demonstrates the consequences of changing the global structure of the
soil-plant formations for the dynamics of CO2 assimilation by vegetation. As seen,
the anthropogenic change of the vegetation cover substantially changes the balance
components in the global carbon cycle. Clearly, such experiments require a thor-
ough analysis of data on the possibility of transformation of vegetation covers with
account of climatic zones and biocenological consistency. Nevertheless, such
hypothetical experiments are useful for general assessments of possible ranges of
anthropogenic impacts on the global carbon cycle. For instance, natural and
anthropogenic cataclysms connected with forest ﬁres introduce annually consider-
able changes into this cycle, because they change numerous ﬂuxes and supplies of
carbon over large territories. Tables 8.10, 8.11 and 8.12 give estimates of deviations
in the content of carbon in the basic biospheric reservoirs with forests ﬁres in
Fig. 8.19 The dynamics of CO2 concentration for different scenarios of changing forest areas

areas remain as of 1970; 2 by 2050 the forests will be liquidated at all; 3 by 2050 the area of the
forests is reduced by 50 %; 4 by 10 %; 5 by 2050 the area of the forests increases by 50 %; 6 by
10 %

different zones. Large-scale impacts on land biota are damped during 60–100 years.
The biosphere turns out to be more resistant to impacts on the forests of southern
latitudes and more sensitive to violations of forest areas in temperate latitudes.
Hence, the northern hemisphere forests up to 42°N play an important role in sta-
bilizing the carbon cycle in the biosphere.
The scenario of liquidation of forests, as seen from the studies of numerous
authors, evokes great interest in studies of the global carbon cycle and the asso-
ciated climate change. A diversity of possible real situations of the transformation
of land covers is so large that it is impossible to assess all the consequences. Note
only that, for instance, a liquidation of all northern taiga and mid-taiga forests (types
F, D) in 50 years will lead to a 53 % increase of atmospheric CO2 with subsequent
negative consequences for the ﬂux HC
6 . Similar consequences follow after liqui-
dation of all wet evergreen and deciduous tropical forests (types Z, Y), but in this
case the indicated increase of atmospheric CO2 will be reached 20 years later.
The GMNSS reﬂected the interactions of natural and anthropogenic factors
taking into consideration that their spatial and temporal heterogeneity and dynamics
allow the assessment of expected risks from possible greenhouse effect. An
example of such assessments is given in Fig. 8.20. It is evident that GMNNS
delivers more optimistic prognosis than climatic model of Hadley Center.
The land cover structure changes not only due to human activity. In some
regions of the globe, hurricanes introduce considerable changes in the carbon
balance of the forest ecosystems. Thus, on the USA territory every 3 years two

hurricanes happen, which accelerate the transition of living biomass of trees into
dead organic matter. If on the USA territory, 20 TgC are removed from the forests
every year, then 10–15 % of this is the result of one hurricane (McNulty 2002).
Hence, the hurricanes accelerate the return of carbon to the atmosphere, and their
global inventory is needed to more accurately estimate numerous components of the
global carbon cycle.

8.6 Vegetation Media as the Object Under Study
of Attenuation of Electromagnetic Waves
Many investigators (Basharinov et al. 1979; Hansen et al. 2002; Zhan et al. 2002;
Burkov and Krapivin 2009; Chukhlantsev 2006) support a constructive technology
for microwave monitoring of vegetation covers. However, greater accuracy of this
technology is required because various vegetation covers, especially vegetation
canopies, are very dynamic and complicated for experimental study or model
parameterization. In this respect, there are two aspects. One is connected with the
creation of a highly productive technology to estimate the land cover characteris-
tics. The other is connected with the climate change problem through the green-
house effect (Kondratyev et al. 2003c). In these cases the GIMS-technology
recommends a balanced scheme for the solution of problems of land cover moni-
toring. As follows from Armand et al. (1997), a combination of experimental and
theoretical studies of attenuation of microwave radiation by vegetation cover is
required. It is actually possible to synthesize the experimental dependence between
attenuation and a restricted set of vegetation parameters. An estimation of attenu-
ation of microwave radiation by vegetation cover in real time is possible only with
the application of microwave models and interpolation algorithms.
From the point of view of microwave remote sensing, the knowledge of the
water content of vegetation is an important element which has to be used for the
synthesis of a model of attenuation of microwave radiation by the vegetation. This
knowledge can be acquired by making use of the fact that water absorption features
dominate the spectral reﬂectance of vegetation in the near-infrared spectrum (Sims
and Gamon 2003). Using such indexes as the normalized difference vegetation
index (NDVI), plant water index (PWI), the leaf area index (LAI), the simple ratio
vegetation index (SRVI), and the canopy structure index (CSI) it is possible to
determine the canopy structure and photosynthetic tissue morphologies. The cor-
relation between the leaf water content and the leaf-level reﬂectance in the near-
infrared has been successfully studied by many authors that linked the leaf and
canopy models to study the effects of leaf structure, dry matter content, LAI, and
canopy geometry. As a result, it is possible to parameterize the forest structure
including the canopy and crown closure, stem density, tree height, crown size, and
other forest parameters (Tables 8.13 and 8.14).

Ecoinformatics and Soil-Plant Formations

Quantitative information about SPF properties may be obtained by means of
different remote sensing techniques based on passive microwave data. This
approach is particularly effective under an estimate of the hydraulic parameters of
the soil-plant formations. The knowledge of these parameters allows the water
balance of a territory occupied by vegetation of a given type to be parameterized
and plant to be modeled. Under this approach a comparison of remote data regis-
tered at different EMW ranges may provide a high precision of estimates of the
water content in the various layers of the SPF (canopy, trunks, stalks, and soil).
Moreover, the combination of data analysis with remote sensing allows one to
estimate the parameters of the ground vegetation cover and its role in the ﬂuxes of
sensible and latent heat from the surface to the atmosphere.
A problem of wavelength choice and the combination of its ranges with classes
of solved tasks is now within the sight of many investigators. The theoretical
foundation of this choice lies in the area of thermal radiation transmission theory.
Speciﬁcally, for the monochromatic case the transmission equation has:
dI zð Þ=dz ¼ J zð Þ  aI zð Þ
ð8:10Þ
where α is the absorption coefﬁcient, J(z) is the emission source distributed by the
coordinate z, and I(z) is emission intensity at point z. Under these conditions, the
following equation is valid for an unscattering atmosphere: J(z) = ε1(z)B(z), where
ε1 is atmospheric emissivity,

h, c, and k are fundamental constants, f = νc is frequency. It is known that hf < kT
in microwave range and Rayleigh-Jeans approximation B(z) = 2kT/λ2 is valid. Here

The weight function Q(u) = ∂τ(u,∞)/∂u describes the inﬂuence of various
atmospheric layers on the receiving signal. Formula (8.11) converts expression
Tj = κTe into a whole. Examples of speciﬁc values are given in Table 8.15.
Thus, a set of vegetation-related parameters should be generated using speciﬁc
time and space resolutions as the basis for the calculation of EMW attenuation by
the vegetation layer. Available remote monitoring data should be used as input
information for algorithms and models to synthesize the spatial-temporal distribu-
tion of the attenuation effects. In this context, the most important parameter is the
dielectric constant. Some estimations of this characteristic are given in Table 8.14.
For example, for the stem dielectric constant a representative value at the L band is
found to be 27.3 −j8.4. The leaf dielectric value varies from 8.77 −j2.88 to
19.58 −j5.54. An average value of the leaf dielectric constant equals to
19.58 −j5.54. The values of the dielectric constant at X band equals to 14.9 −j4.9
and 20.0 −j9.7 for leaves and branches, respectively.
Detail and complete study of the EMW attenuation by the vegetation layer was
realized in the framework of the ISTC Project #2059 “Screening Effect of Vege-
tation in Active (SAR) and Passive (Radiometric) Remote Sensing of the Earth’s
Covers and in Radio-Communication in UHF-, VHF-, and Microwave (X-, C-, S-,
L-, and P-) bands” (Chukhlantsev 2006). The goals of this Project were the
following:
• acquiring systematized data about electromagnetic waves attenuation by dif-
ferent types of vegetation covers, mainly in the meter wavelength band, but also
in decimeter and centimeter wavelength bands (UHF, VHF, P-, L-, S-, C-, and
X-bands) using theoretical and experimental investigations.
• developing advanced, more sophisticated, and generalized models, compared
with the existing SAR and microwave radiometric models of different types of

vegetation with due regard for the electromagnetic properties of vegetative
elements to satisfy the needs in reliable assessment of vegetation impact
(screening effect of vegetation) on soil condition sensing;
• developing methodologies of vegetation impact assessment in active (SAR) and
passive (MR) remote sensing of the Earth’s covers to reduce/eliminate/remove
the impact of vegetation on the land surface observation;
• developing methodologies for assessing the impact of vegetation on the radio-
communication.
This project solved the following main tasks.
• Building up of the measuring complex to conduct investigations of the atten-
uation of electromagnetic waves in vegetation covers and in plant elements
(leaves, sticks, etc.).
• Systematization and generalization of the existing theoretical and experimental
data about attenuation of electromagnetic waves in vegetation.
• Acquisition of experimental characteristics of electromagnetic waves attenuation
by various types of vegetative covers in the laboratory and ﬁeld conditions in
meter, decimeter and centimeter wavelength range.
• Conducting model investigations of the attenuation of electromagnetic waves in
vegetation covers in meter, decimeter, and centimeter wavelength range.
• Elaboration of methodologies for the screening effect of vegetation assessment
by conducting single wavelength measurements and by combining active and
passive methods.
• Elaboration of methodologies for the screening effect assessment by conducting
multi-wavelength measurements and by combining active and passive remote
sensing systems.
• Elaboration of methodologies for the screening effect of vegetation assessment
in radio communication.
Technical approach and methodology under the solution of these tasks were
founded on the following ideas. Theoretical part included utilization of the methods
of the radio waves propagation for the two basic types of vegetation models:
(1) vegetation in a form of inhomogeneous randomized media (stochastically
inhomogeneous or irregular), in particular to discuss the vegetation model as a
continuous medium with an effective value of dielectric permittivity; and
(2) vegetation as a community of discrete, separately located scatters; the deter-
mination of the attenuation cross-section of these elements.
In a continuous model, the vegetative cover was described as a homogeneous
medium with effective value of dielectric permittivity. The effective values of
permittivity were calculated in a quasi-static approach (the size of irregularities,
disks, needles, strips, is much less compared with a wavelength) by deriving dif-
ferent relationship based on the theory of dielectric mixtures. The corrections for
effective value of dielectric permittivity was made with due regard for the oscil-
lating (wavy) nature of the process.

In a discrete model, the aggregated electromagnetic parameters of vegetation
chosen for evaluation of vegetation behavior were the attenuation, cross-section and
scattering cross-section of the vegetation elements. The vegetation elements were
modeled by disks, strips, and cylinders. A spectral dependence of the attenuation
and scattering cross-sections are determined. Total attenuation in the vegetative
media was studied by using the radiation transfer theory.
An experimental part of the ISTC-2059 Project included laboratory and ﬁeld
measurements. A special laboratory complex was built up to conduct investigation
of the attenuation by plant samples and plant elements in a wide range of fre-
quencies. This complex includes two waveguide transmission systems operating in
the frequency range of 0.2–8.0 GHz (Figs. 8.21 and 8.22). The radio attenuation

was studied by comparing the data with and without vegetation samples in the
waveguides. Basic electrical characteristic of laboratory complex is shown in
Fig. 8.23 It is clear that attenuation was less than 5 dB in the range of 0.8–
2.15 GHz. The same dependence is observed in the range of 0.8–10.0 GHz. Some
experimental results are given in Figs. 8.24, 8.25 and 8.26.
Experiments in ﬁeld conditions were conducted at the territory of forests using
the lowering unit (Figs. 8.27 and 8.28). The territory includes grassy and forested
areas of different plant type and density. The generator is installed behind the trees.
A receiver is located in different areas at different heights of tree crowns. The
assessments of the attenuation were obtained by comparing the intensity of signals

for different locations of the receiver off the tree. As a result, the database of the
EMW attenuation was synthesized (Golovachev et al. 2004; Vinogradova et al.
2004).
In addition, the available microwave radiometric and SAR data are being pro-
cessed and studied.

conditions;
• elaboration of new methodologies for multi-channel measurements of both, the
properties of vegetation and of soil, by developing an advanced approach and
adequate models for the system “soil-vegetation” sensing in absence of the
reliable prior knowledge-based information about the investigated object;
• elaboration of an advanced approach for the typical Earth environments

approaches for artiﬁcial increase in a spatial resolution by conducting multi-

8.7 Links Between Experiments, Algorithms, and Models
Field observations are the initial stage to determine the important properties of the
vegetation cover. Many problems arise in providing the model descriptions of
biological and physical processes, which operate on different timescales. The tasks
of describing EMW attenuation by the vegetation cover have timescales ranging
from less than a second to hours or days and also have various spatial scales.
Consequently, the parametrical description of the EMW attenuation by the vege-
tation cover calls for an enormous number of experimental observations, the
planning of which depends on the model type and the vegetation component under
investigation. That is why the effective synthesis of the ﬁnal results into given
space-time scales may be realized by the application of GIMS-technology. This
gives the opportunity to solve the problem of scaling the soil-vegetation-atmo-
sphere model and to describe the radiative transfer processes on a scale from that of
individual plants or small plots to large-scale biomes.
As mentioned above, the satellite data can be used to calculate many parameters
of the vegetation cover, including unstressed stomatal conductance, photosynthetic

capacity, fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the green
portion of the vegetation canopy, canopy reﬂectance, transpiration, and other
important environmental characteristics. These data and the results of ﬁeld exper-
iments allow to generate model experiments.
The GIMS-based method uses a priori information to start the model experiment.
Under this procedure, a set of algorithms operate over the whole data set and
determine the input parameters of the model used. The model structure and its
coefﬁcients are changed depending on the ﬂuctuation of the difference between the
experimental and model estimations of the EMW attenuation effect. Usually, the
central part of the model describes the fundamental processes within the SPF, such
as the radiation balance, water circulation (evapotranspiration, water uptake by
roots), photosynthesis, and mortality.
In a common case of environmental investigations, combined use of algorithms,
computer models and remote sensing technologies is possible within the hybrid
information-modeling system with the structure described by Soldatov (2011,
2012). This structure links experimental optical and microwave techniques with
computer modeling supporting the correlations between different stages of simu-
lation experiment.
The model-based analysis and optimization of computational experiments have
speciﬁc features that certainly demand the determination of new design points.
Unfortunately, in many scenarios of simulation experiments, the objective function,
e.g., the response of survivability indicator to the impacts on the environmental
system cannot be assessed exactly. Thus, the true quality of plan can be certainly
obtained only by repeating the corresponding experiment and performing an esti-
mation of the distribution of the responses. The GIMS-technology based on the
evolutionary modeling and sequential analysis as follows from Fig. 1.5 optimizes
the investigation process.
Complex engineering problems clearly cannot be resolved without using sim-
ulation experiments, which are usually brought about by numerical solution of a
complex system of equations. In this case, the researcher runs into a conﬂict
between his desire to enhance the accuracy of a simulation experiment and the
limited capabilities of the used algorithms. The biggest difﬁculties arise when the
investigator cannot use mathematical equations to parameterize the studied pro-
cesses. These difﬁculties are overcome by the evolutionary computer technology
that helps to design a new type of the model (Bukatova et al. 1991; René and
Hassane 2005).
In common case, the GIMS-based approach provides the reproduction of a
numerical simulation experiment, derived from a given set of quantitative models
and algorithms independently from the complexity of problem for the study. Of
course, the investigator has to compose the information about different parts of the
simulation experiment including information about input and output data as well as
about the models to use. All models used in the experiment must be identiﬁed,
accessible, and fully described. The models required for the simulations must be
provided with all governing equations, parameter values, and necessary conditions

including initial state, boundary conditions, etc. The main step of the simulation
experiment is a quality criteria deﬁnition in order to achieve the purpose of the
experiment. Various examples of solution of such environmental problem, with the
use of the GIMS-based approach are given in this book.
8.8 Microwave Model of Vegetation Cover
8.8.1 Two-Level Model of Vegetation Cover
The atmosphere-vegetation-soil system (AVSS) is commonly considered in
Fig. 8.29. The microwave emission of the AVSS is formed by a combination of
absorption and diffraction processes within the media and by repeated reﬂection
upon their boundaries. Microwave emission models (MEMs) have been thoroughly
studied in attempts to derive possible AVSS conﬁgurations by many authors
(Ferrazzoli and Guerriero 1996; Phillips et al. 2009; Shutko 1997; Shutko et al.
2007; Krapivin et al. 2006b; Shutko and Krapivin 2011). The AVSS emissivity

θ is the angle between the direction of electromagnetic wave propagation in the

Following Chukhlantsev and Shutko (1988), the Fresnel coefﬁcients are deter-
mined as functions of the vegetation cover parameters. The dielectric constants of
the vegetation and soil are input parameters to formulae (8.14) and (8.15).

where λ is the wavelength (cm), and ci and di are constants depending on the soil
type. For example, soil that consists of 30.6 % sand, 55.9 % silt and 13.5 % clay is
characterized by the dependencies (8.17) with c1 = 2.35; c2 = 52.4; c3 = 31.1;
c4 = 0.057; c5 = 1.22; d1 = 7.1; d2 = 46.9; d3 = 0.0097 and d4 = 1.84.
Thus, taking into account the dependencies of (8.17) it becomes possible to
optimize the microwave range for passive remote sensing. Of course, a set of
unsolved problems exists relating to the model corrections necessary in order to
take into consideration the surface roughness and other obstacles distorting the
brightness temperature TB, as well as a set of special features which arises in the
inverse tasks solution. A basis for future model reﬁnements is the correlation
between TB, the atmospheric transmissivity for a radiometer at height H above the
soil, the smooth surface reﬂectivity R and the thermometric temperatures of the SPF
Ts-v and atmosphere Ta. This correlation can be expressed by the Schmugge-Shutko
formula (Schmugge 1990; Shutko 1986):

where Tsky is the contribution from the reﬂected sky brightness. Typical remote
sensing applications use microwave wavelengths λ ≥1 cm and in this case the
atmospheric transmission approaches 99 % and Ta + Tsky ≤5°K (Engman and
Chauhan 1995).
The more precise correlation in (8.18) can be achieved considering the inﬂuence
of the surface roughness on the soil reﬂectivity: R0 ¼ R exp g  cos2 x

ω is the angle of incidence, and g is the roughness parameter (g = 4r2k2, where σ is

Formulae (8.16) and (8.17) are simpliﬁed with the use of the correlation between
the soil water content ρB and the vegetation water content ρP (DeWitt and Nutter
1988):

There are many more simpliﬁed or more complicated models of the AVSS. For
example, the model describing the forest medium, as sketched in Fig. 8.2, was
developed by Ferrazzoli and Guerriero (1996) and is based on the Rayleigh-Jeans
approximation of the electromagnetic properties of coniferous leaves (needles). The
vegetation cover is represented as a two-layered structure. The ﬁrst layer is the
canopy composed of leaves and branches, represented by discs and cylinders,
respectively. The second layer of the vegetation cover consists of trunks described
by near-vertical cylinders. Such a model structure allows one to simulate the
microwave forest emission.
Models for layered vegetation have been studied by many authors (Ferrazzoli
and Guerriero 1996; Karam et al. 1992; Krapivin et al. 2006b). The main mathe-
matical task involves solving the radiative transfer equation. Different models
consider a wide frequency range for both deciduous and coniferous forests and
account for the distributions of branch size and leaf orientation. The basic con-
clusion of these studies indicates that detailed knowledge of the forest structure is
important for the adequacy of the model. For example, lichens in taiga forests and
forest tundra are characterized by lower photosynthesis and can inﬂuence the
attenuation index. The tasks arising here are the subject of future studies.
The problem of optimal electromagnetic range choice and synthesis of effective
methodic for soil moisture measurement, certainly, needs additional study of for-
mation conditions of the radiation ﬁelds in the atmosphere-soil-vegetation system.
Some data for solution of this problem are given in Table 2.18.

To understand the dependence on the environmental parameters of the radio
brightness temperature registered by a radiometer at height H above the soil, which

wind speed, for example, on the variations of the brightness temperature. This
analysis is possible with knowledge of the canopy roughness as a function of wind

8.9 Land Cover Classiﬁcations
Remote sensing resources, image interpretation and classiﬁcation tools provide land
cover classiﬁcation using remotely sensed data. There exist different options for
conducting land cover classiﬁcation including types of imagery, methods and
algorithms, and classiﬁcation schemes. The image classiﬁcation process depends on
the monitoring data types and quality. It is important to have the possibility to
distinguish each class of vegetation on the map and to clearly deﬁne and distinct it
from other classes. The most important problem is the forest ecosystem classiﬁ-
cation. The solution of the tasks arising here depends on the methods and algo-
rithms for remote sensing data. Table 8.16 gives the list of basic indicative
characteristics of forest ecosystems evaluated on the base of remote sensing of the
forest. Table 8.17 enumerates the most known vegetative indexes used in the
remote sensing monitoring. A vegetation index is a number that is generated by a
combination of remote sensing bands and may have some relationship to the
amount of vegetation in a given image pixel.
As far as the climate change and sustainable development problems are con-
cerned, forest ecology plays more important role than other branches of ecology.
Forests are studied at a number of organizational levels, from individual organisms

to the ecosystem. In common, forest ecology mainly concentrates on the level of the
population, community or ecosystem. Present study of the forest ecosystems is
based on not only in-situ observations but the satellite measurements are used as
fundamental base for the forest ecology. In contrast to other land ecosystems,
forests have speciﬁc features that consist in the following circumstances:
• trees can grow larger than other plant life-forms;
• there is the potential for a wide variety of forest structures;
• the inﬁnite number of possible spatial arrangements of trees of varying size and
species makes for a highly intricate and diverse micro-environment in which
environmental variables such as solar radiation, temperature, relative humidity,
and wind speed can vary considerably over large and small distances;
• an important proportion of a forest ecosystem’s biomass is often underground,
where soil structure, water quality and quantity, and levels of various soil
nutrients can vary greatly; and

• forest trees are important regulators of hydrological processes, especially those
involving groundwater hydrology and local evaporation and rainfall/snowfall
patterns.
These and other features of the forest ecosystems and large areas occupied by
them demand the use of coupled mathematical models to study the forest in their
evolution. This chapter gives examples of such models and remote sensing tech-
nologies. In the future it is necessary to develop the proposed approaches mainly
based on the GIMS technology. Such approach gives the possibility to study the
structure of forest ecosystems in vertical and horizontal dimensions. The horizontal
structure is usually described by how individual trees, shrubs, herbs, and openings
or gaps are distributed. The vertical structure has several levels and its study using
remote sensing means is possible provided that there are data about microwave
radiation attenuation in the canopy.
Parallel with microwave monitoring of vegetation covers, optical sensors located
on ﬂying laboratory and satellites deliver spectral images of land covers with high
spatial resolution. In this case, the classiﬁcation of land covers is based on the
difference of their spectral reﬂectance (Figs. 8.30 and 8.31). Moreover, spectral
image recognition method described in Chap. 9 can be used for the land cover
classiﬁcations.
Vegetation indices are widely used to assess qualitatively the biophysical and
morphological characteristics of vegetation from remote sensing measurements.
Sensitivity of each vegetation index to different vegetation characteristics covers
restricted parametrical cluster of the atmosphere-soil-plant system. Different satel-
lites deliver data for global and regional vegetation index imagery at various pixel
size resolutions. The sites include boreal forests, temperate coniferous forests
temperate deciduous forests, tropical rainforests, grasslands, savannas, and desert
biomes. Differences and similarities in sensitivity to vegetation conditions are

registered by many vegetation indices. All vegetation indices show a qualitative
relationship to variations in vegetation. However, there exist signiﬁcant differences
among the vegetation indices over desert, grassland, and forested biomes. For
example, NDVI is sensitive to and responded primarily to the highly absorbing red
reﬂectance band, while other indices such as SARVI are more responsive to vari-
ations in the near-infrared band. It is evident that different indices have their own
advantages in retrieving vegetation information. It is very difﬁcult to precisely
attribute any vegetation index to any particular vegetation biophysical or mor-
phological parameter. Therefore, creation of universal algorithm for the classiﬁ-
cation of vegetation characteristics is possible by using the model represented in
Fig. 1.19 that realizes the GIMS technology. In this case, the vector Ψ = {yi, i = 1,
…, m} is synthesized, where yi is separate vegetation index from Table 8.17 and
m ≤25 is the number of indices included to the vector Ψ. Vector Ψ gives a
possibility to form cluster space that allows the recognition of different states of
vegetation covers.

9.1 Expert System for the Hydrophysical
and Hydrochemical Investigations
9.1.1 Principal Matters
Risk of losses resulted from human factors, inadequate or failed internal processes
and systems, or external events is closely connected with aftermath weakening of
the damage reduction. This problem is important when stressful hydrophysical and
hydrochemical processes occur. For example, the control and assessment of the
state of the water environment require knowledge of numerous characteristics,
which can be classiﬁed into:
(1) factors of the water chemistry;
(2) water quality; and
(3) dynamical characteristics.
The ﬁrst group includes characteristics of the processes affecting the water
quality and determining the dynamics of the parametric space that describes the
complex state of the studied aqua-geosystem. Depending on the experimental
conditions, these factors are connected with the spatial scale and can be point wise
or of areal character.
To describe a set of factors and to determine their spatial signiﬁcance, we denote
the points on the aqua-geosystem’s surface by latitude φ and longitude λ. Let us
consider a rectangular system of coordinates with the axis z directed upwards in
relation to the surface, so that the value z stating the depth at the point with
coordinates (φ, λ). Then any measurement will be described by the parameter ξ(φ,
λ, z, t), which in a general case is a non-stationary random value. In the concrete
experiment, the formation of the set Ξ = {ξ} is connected with the factors shown in
Fig. 9.1. In a general form, the scheme of the formation of the set Ξ is shown in
Fig. 9.2. Depending on the spatial scales of the hydrophysical object under study,

a variety of possible schemes of the formation of water quality and other charac-
teristics of the aqua-geosystem covers a wide spectrum of the physico-chemical
interactions of the elements of the water basin ecosystem. The variety of all these
schemes is an evidence of the complexity of assessing the water quality and the
state of the aqua-geosystem. Therefore, an efﬁcient monitoring of the aqua-geo-
system depends on the adequate description of these interactions and the adequate
list of parameters to be measured.
The parameters that directly determine the water quality are acidity, turbidity and
the content of chemicals. In parallel, a set of criteria for the water quality exists
depending on its application. In this regard, Table 9.1 exempliﬁes the sets of factors
Fig. 9.1 Factors which form the water quality and should be taken into account in the
hydrophysical experiment

that assess the water quality with different criteria. Abbasi and Abbasi (2012)
describe water quality indices and show that only with the use of such indices is it
feasible to assess, express, communicate, and monitor the overall quality of any
water source. In general, the conditions of water quality include (http://water.epa.
gov/type/rsl/monitoring/vms52.cfm)
• Stream ﬂow. The stream ﬂow, or discharge, is the volume of water that moves
over a designated point over a ﬁxed period of time. It is often expressed in cubic
meters per second (m3/s). The ﬂow is affected by weather, increasing during
rainstorms and decreasing during dry periods. It also changes during different
seasons of the year, decreasing during the summer months when evaporation
rates are high and shoreline vegetation is actively growing and removing water
from the ground. August and September are usually the months of lowest ﬂow
for most streams and rivers in most of the country.
• Dissolved oxygen and biochemical oxygen demand. The stream system both
produces and consumes oxygen. It gains oxygen from the atmosphere and from
plants as a result of photosynthesis. Running water, because of its churning,
dissolves more oxygen than still water, such as that in a reservoir behind a dam.
Respiration by aquatic animals, decomposition, and various chemical reactions
consume oxygen.
• Temperature. The rates of biological and chemical processes depend on tem-
perature. Aquatic organisms from microbes to ﬁsh are dependent on certain
temperature ranges for their optimal health. Temperature affects the oxygen
content of the water (oxygen levels become lower as temperature increases); the
rate of photosynthesis by aquatic plants; the metabolic rates of aquatic organ-
isms; and the sensitivity of organisms to toxic wastes, parasites, and diseases.

• Alkalinity (pH). It affects many chemical and biological processes in the water.
The pH scale measures the logarithmic concentration of hydrogen (H+) and
hydroxide (OH−) ions, which form water (H+ + OH−= H2O).
• Turbidity. Suspended materials including soil particles (clay, silt, and sand),
algae, plankton, microbes, and other substances can affect the colour of the
water and decrease the passage of light through it.
• Phosphorus. Phosphorus is essential nutrient for the plants and animals that
makes up the aquatic food web.
• Nitrates. Nitrates are a form of nitrogen, which is found in several different
forms in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. These forms of nitrogen include
ammonia (NH3), nitrates (NO3), and nitrites (NO2). Nitrates are essential plant
nutrients, but in excess amounts they can cause signiﬁcant water quality
problems.
• Total solids. The concentration of total dissolved solids affects the water balance
in the cells of aquatic organisms.
• Conductivity. It is a measure of the ability of water to pass an electrical current.
Conductivity in streams and rivers is affected primarily by the geology of the
area through which the water ﬂows.
• Total alkalinity. Alkalinity is a measure of the capacity of water to neutralize
acids. Alkalinity in streams is inﬂuenced by rocks and soils, salts, certain plant
activities, and certain industrial wastewater discharges.
• Fecal bacteria. Presence of fecal bacteria in streams suggests that pathogenic
microorganisms might also be present and that swimming and eating shellﬁsh
might be a health risk.
These parameters testify to the fact that it is very difﬁcult to draw a distinction
between hydrophysical and hydrochemical experiments. However, it is clear that
the quality of water is, to a greater extent, hydrochemical function. In practice the
aim is neither to draw this distinction not to substantiate a set of problems to be
solved in the hydrophysical experiment. Apparently, speaking about data series of
the hydrophysical experiment, one should not neglect the hydrochemical data.
Ultimately, an assessment of the state of the aqua-geosystem requires a certain
combination of such data and especially when studying the dynamic characteristics.
The parameters of the water quality in the list mentioned above have various effects
on the living organisms.
In particular, a change of n u; k; z; t
ð
Þ is connected with a consideration of
correlations between all factors affecting the water quality. In the formation of the
spatial image of the water object under study, it is necessary to take into account an
interaction of climatic, biogeochemical, ecological and hydrological processes. This
is possible by using a numerical modeling and, hence, developing new data series in
the form of the models’ coefﬁcients.
The stages of the hydrophysical monitoring are connected with different levels of
database and therefore require the respective algorithms of analysis and interpre-
tation of measurement results. Moreover, an identiﬁcation of a set of algorithms of
data processing with the problems of the experiment cannot guarantee an adequate
724

complex of methods to solve these problems. A combination of the hydrophysical
monitoring problems with the system of the automated data processing is only
possible in an adaptive regime. It is shown schematically in Fig. 9.3.
The monitoring can be point wise and areal. In the ﬁrst case the data processing
is connected with the use of a number of algorithms providing an assessment of the
required set of parameters without consideration of spatial scales of the process or
object under study. In the second case the system of data processing requires special
methods aimed at reducing their variability and forming a spatial image based on
measurements episodic in time and fragmentary in space. In this case, it is essential
to choose the scales of the cartographic grid and to correlate it with the problems to
be solved. Only then can one guarantee a certain level of reliability in the assess-
ment of the state of the aqua-geosystem.
Algorithms of formation and processing the spatial databases are approved in the
GIS-technology. However, there exists a gap between traditional methods of GIS-
technology and models as an instrument of prediction. To ﬁll up the gap, the
selection of the matrix structures-identiﬁers with the hierarchical topology both in
space and in the elemental ﬁlling of the aqua-geosystem model is made. Each
element of the identiﬁer describes in the symbol space the image of an element
(fragment) of the system under study. In other words, the territory Ω is presented in
the form of the hierarchical spatial structure:

where the symbol α can identify the sets of elements of the aqua-geosystem sup-
posed to be taken into account in the system of data processing. This semantics
reduces the dimensionality of the ﬁfth level of the database, but increases the
probability of information distortion in the dialogue mode. In other words, the
problem of an optimization of the ﬁfth level of the database exists.
On the whole, models of hydrophysical and hydrochemical processes over a
limited territory or on global scale permit to carry out a numerical experiment and to
estimate the parameters of a hydrophysical object. Use of the numerical experiment
in the hydrophysical studies has much in common with other ﬁelds of its appli-
cation. A closed series of algorithms of analysis of the measured data is constructed
and on its basis the fourth and ﬁfth levels of the database are formed. An adaptive
procedure of the use of the aqua-geosystem functioning model (according to the
scheme in Fig. 9.3) makes it possible to start a dialogue mode of the estimation of
many parameters, which cannot be reliably estimated from the measured data or
which raise doubts.
By applying additional quantitative criteria of stability in the dialogue mode, it is
possible to ﬁnd permissible ranges of changes of some parameters. Schematically, it
is shown in Fig. 9.4.
The most substantial link in the system of automatization of the hydrophysical
experiment is the processing of the data on the hydrophysical factors, whose
knowledge plays a certain role in assessing the complex state of the aqua-geo-
system. These are factors, which introduce into the model some elements of
instability and are the source of the aqua-geosystem’s dynamics. Therefore, in all
algorithms for the hydrophysical experiment, hydrodynamical equations serve for a
reference point for strictness and accuracy. An adequate system of hydrodynamical
equations describes changes of the components of the current velocity, pressure and
density and contains ﬁve equations: equation of motion for three components,
equation of continuity and equation of state. Since we are interested in the problem
of pollutant transport in the hydrological network, these equations should be sup-
plemented with equations of water balance in the territory.

9.1.2 Simulation System
The problem of synthesis of the simulation system for hydrophysical and hydro-
chemical investigations (SSHHI) in a given territory requires a classiﬁcation of the
elements of the aqua-geosystem. Analysis of the scheme in Fig. 9.5 shows that
many fragments of SSHHI can be implemented with the help of GIS-technology.
These are the formation of the spatial database, modeling the topographic structure,
the computer cartography, and visualization. Other SSHHI fragments are accom-
plished in accordance with GIMS-technology.
The GIMS-technology recommends in the case of organization of studies in the
territories with heterogeneous structures to form series of maps of different
minuteness, as shown in Fig. 1.2. For any level of the spatial resolution Dφ × Dλ,
the database contains an information layer of the sets of identiﬁers controlled by the
control unit and whose data are taken by the respective functions—units of the
SSHHI. Here the scheme of cartographic modeling which is widely used in GIS, is
realized.
As indicated above, the organization of any nature monitoring requires a solution
of the problems of the spatial-temporal interpolation. This problem is solved by
many methods applied in GIMS-technology. In SSHHI these methods are used to

integrate information from various sources. This procedure includes the following
operations:
• integrating into a single system of spatial data from various sources, such as
geographic maps, satellite photographs, remote measurements, ground obser-
vations, etc.;
• creation of the geometric description of the Earth surface within compatible
topological structures;
• formation of models and software for transformations between the vector and
expanded data, that is, between maps and images;
• provision of agreement between the series of hydrophysical and hydrochemical
characteristics at each level of the spatial scale of the system;
• provision of co-ordination of information ﬂuxes of spatial, linear and point wise
data within one unit or for the whole model;
• synthesis of the scattered spatial information and formation of a representative
image of either the aqua-geosystem or its fragments.
There are elements in the SSHHI database which, according to the scheme
shown in Fig. 1.2, cover the whole set of information levels. As a result of the
Fig. 9.5 Structure of the simulation system for hydrophysical and hydrochemical investigations
(SSHHI). Notations are given in Table 9.2

simulation experiment, the computer memorizes at each time moment a set of
schematic maps. Depending on the user’s query, the FSOD unit forms an output ﬁle
with the needed information structure. Means of computer visualization transform
the symbol matrix into a schematic map, and the user obtains information that is
easy to be analyzed.
To parameterize the hydrospheric part of the investigated site of the Earth sur-
face and to create a universal schematic envelope of the system, cover the territory
with the grid with a step Dφ in latitude and Dλ in longitude. The area of each cell
will be, rD ¼ Du  Dk  ku  kk where kφ and kλ are kilometers in 1° of latitude and

where NS [ NW ¼ N; NS is a part of the land territory; ΞW is part of the territory
under a hydrospheric object. The topological structure of the hydrospheric part of
the territory is described by the identiﬁer of the HYDROL(I, J) type in which the
possible conﬁgurations of different types of hydrospheric elements are described.
The HYDROL array permits to select a moving part of the water environment in the
territory Ω and to more accurately consider thereby the variability of water
chemistry, due to heterogeneous catchment areas.
To organize the numerical procedure of calculation of dynamic water ﬂows
between the cells ΩIJ, introduce an array of the heights above sea level:

where ωIJ is the average height of the cell ΩIJ above sea level in meters.
Each cell ΩIJ is characterized by a certain relationship between water basins, wild
and agricultural vegetation, urban constructions, and roads. The determination of this
relationship is made by a set of the following 2D arrays: PARTW I; J; TIME

Each cell ΩIJ is occupied by one of n types of vegetation and by one of m types
of cultural vegetation. The schemes of this occupation are presented with 2D arrays:
VEGETA (I,J,TIME) for agricultural vegetation, VEGETS (I,J,TIME) for wild
vegetation and ANTROP (I,J,TIME) for anthropogenic landscapes.
Water can be polluted through the atmosphere, washing-out from soil and
anthropogenic emissions directly into water reservoirs (common and industrial
sewage, leakages and discharges from ships). Information about these processes is
synthesized in the form of an identiﬁcation scheme TYPEC(I,J,TIME). Based on
730
9
Operational Diagnostics, Estimation …

the information contained in TYPEC array, the statistical mean situation of pol-
lution in the absence of information is controlled.
The system is ﬁlled up with data by introducing the results of measurements
provided either by the monitoring or by the services of control of observance of the
norms of pollutants emissions into the environment by the anthropogenic systems.
The system contains the TYPEP (I,J,TIME) array designed for introduction of more
accurate information about the polluting productions. The TYPEP array includes
productions characteristic of the territory, due to which the system provides the
information network with average estimates of pollutants emissions in the case of
the absence of other information. Information about the characteristic compositions
of sewage in the territory of productions is used as a database.
Depending on requirements for the SSHHI efﬁciency, the corrective information
can be obtained from satellites. For instance, information about the arrays TER-
RITORY, HYDROL, TOPOGR, PARTW, PERTS, VEGETA, VEGETS, and
ANTROP can be obtained from satellites. The arrays TYPEC and TYPEP can be
replenished and corrected by the regular use of the ﬂying laboratory.
The structure of the SSHHI information base is determined both by possibilities
of its formation and by need of practical solutions of the problems of the water
quality control in a given territory. The gained experience in creation and use of
such systems suggests a hierarchical structure of the database constructed by the
principle of successive digitization of the territory. Following the scheme of hier-
archical digitization of the space, one can, without damage to the system, constantly
increase the minuteness of digitization, with the subject orientation of the territory
ΩIJ preserved. Thus the structure and functions of the SSHHI are adjusted to natural
composition of data on various aspects of functioning of natural and anthropogenic
landscapes. The SSHHI only synthesizes the available data and suggests data that
should be obtained. Models in the SSHHI structure provide an integration of data in
space and by subject areas, due to which an integrated image is formed of the
territory with processes taking place in it.
The SSHHI has a set of formalized structures to control the monitoring regime.
Spatial-temporal identiﬁers refer the SSHHI to the topology and morphology of the
natural or anthropogenic object. The sets of the identiﬁers enumerated above
parameterize the spatial and subject structure of the territory Ω, so that at each level
of its spatial digitization a complete description is provided of an image of the
system under study. By the space, the topology of this parameterization can be
heterogeneous and non-uniform as well as excessive.
Following the hierarchy of the SSHHI menu the user, can implement the fol-
lowing operations:
• to ask for data on any identiﬁer (array) and to correct any of its fragments;
• to ask for estimates of all or part of the parameters of simulation units and to
correct them;
• to select the sets of parameters and identiﬁers for a more prompt access to them;
• to synthesize a symbolic schematic map of the distribution of the estimates of
the environmental characteristics; and

• to predict the state of the environment down to a given depth or till accom-
plishing the a-priori formulated criterion of assessment of the state of the water
environment.
Schematically, it is shown in Fig. 9.6. The user, through interface, sends per-
mission at each step of the command dialogue, which is assessed in the unit of the
query analysis, and from its response, the controlling unit realizes a chain of needed
actions of the system. Via return channels of query, the resulting prediction is
arranged in the needed form, which can change in each cycle of service. The ﬁnal
result is presented in the form of the protocol with enumerated characteristics of the
water environment by objects and territories as well as in the form of schematic
maps or digital information combined with the map.

9.2.1 Fresh Water Problems
The fresh water problems attract special attention, since, on the one hand, water is a
key component of ecosystems and, on the other hand, about 1/3 of the global
population is under the threat of chronic deﬁcit of water in several decades. This
and other facts have determined the declaration of the UN Fresh-Water Decade
(2005−2015). The following facts characterize the present state of the global water
resources (WCSDG 2004; WB 2009):
Fig. 9.6 SSHHI information units

Operational Diagnostics, Estimation …

• The total volume of water resources on Earth constitutes about 1.4 billion km3.
• The volume of fresh-water resources is about 35 million km3 or 2.5 % of the
total water volume.
• From these fresh-water resources, about 24 million km3 or 68.9 % exist in the
form of ice and constant snow cover in mountains, Antarctic and Arctic.
• About 8 million km3 or 30.8 % are under ground in the form of ground waters
(in shallow and deep basins of ground water down to 2,000 m deep). Soil
moisture, bog water, and permafrost.
• In fresh-water lakes and rivers there are about 105 thousand km3 or 0.3 % of
global fresh-water supply.
• The general volume of fresh-water supply to be consumed by ecosystems and
population constitutes about 2,000 thousand km3, that is, less than 1 % of the
global fresh-water supply.
• About 3,011 fresh-water biological species have included in the list of species,
which either are under the threat or disappeared; 1,039 of them being ﬁsh. Four
of the ﬁve existing species of river dolphins and two of the three existing species
of sea-cows as well as about 40 species of fresh-water tortoises and more than
400 species of mollusks in fresh-water are under the threat.
• The annual ground waters diversion is evaluated at 600–700 km3 or about 20 %
of the global water diversion. About 1.5 billion people drink ground water.
• From estimates, 70 % of the global fresh water was spent in 2,000 on agriculture.
• The average per-capita consumption of water in developed countries is about 10
times greater than in developing countries. In developed countries this indicator
varies between 500 and 800 ‘/day, and in developing countries—from 60 to150
‘/day.
• Industry consumes about 20 % of the global fresh-water diversion. From 57 to
69 % of the global water diversion are spent on energy production at hydro and
nuclear power stations, 30−40 %—in industrial processes, and 0.5−3 %—for
needs of thermal energy.
The fresh-water problems are very broad and diverse. Table 9.3 (WCSDG 2004)
presents asummary of the aspectsof these problems on which the humans’ life support
depends in the context of the UN Millenium Declaradion (UNEP 2002, 2004).
On the whole, it should be stated that provision of sufﬁcient pure water is of
fundamental importance for achieving the goals of the socio-economic development
and environmental protection. In this connection, of serious concern is an enhanced
anthropogenic impact on the environment. So, for instance, the area of fresh-water
wetlands that play an important role in natural puriﬁcation of water and in the water
cycle formation has almost doubled during the last 20 years. Meanwhile, according
to the economic assessment of the role of wetlands functioning, their losses are
equivalent to 20 thousand dollars per year. About 20 % of 10 thousand species of
fresh-water ﬁsh are either on the verge of extinction or do not exist anymore. The
number of large dams in the world has increased from 5,000 in 1950 to more than
45,000 now, which has led to negative ecological outcomes (Beder 2005; Nguyen
Xuan Man et al. 2010).

The geographical distribution of fresh-water resources is rather non-uniform:
about half the global resources are the share of six countries (Brazil, Russia,
Canada, Indonesia, China, Columbia), this non-uniformity being also characteristic
of individual countries. So, for instance, China has 7 % of fresh-water resources
(with a 21 % share of population with respect to global one), but most of the
country is arid. Naturally, the countries with water deﬁcit have to use ground
waters, what brings forth a gradual decrease of their level. The data in Table 9.4
characterize the levels of per-capita water diversion in different countries as of 2011

(Krapivin and Varotsos 2007). These data visually show how the world water
resources are irregularly distributed.
Besides, these data illustrate the existing socio-economic contrasts. About every
ﬁfth man in the developing world (they total about 1.1 billion) is subjected every day
to the risk of falling ill for lack of good-quality drinking water. The main problem
here is not the absence of water at all but adverse socio-economic conditions.
The major consumer of fresh water of rivers, lakes and underground sources is
known to be agriculture (about 70 % on a global scale and up to 90 % in many
developing countries). Since in the nearest future the enhancing use of irrigation
will face a deﬁcit of fresh-water resources, the efﬁcient use of fresh water becomes

more and more important and can be substantially increased. In particular, this
refers to the use of micro-irrigation (including drip irrigation), the scale of which
remains rather limited.
A considerable potential of water economy is connected with food production.
As seen, for instance, from Table 9.5, production of 10 g of protein in the form of
beef requires water expenditure 5 times more than in the case of rice, and to obtain
500 food calories (this difference reaches a factor of 20). With an abundant meat
diet, an average American needs 5.4 ‘ of water per day, whereas in the case of
vegetarian diet this amount if halved.
A serious problem is the urban water supply and the implementation of measures
on water economy. More urgent is still the problem of industrial use of fresh water
whose share is 22 % of the globally used fresh-water resources (59 % in developed
and 10 % in developing countries).
9.2.2 Water Quality Monitoring in the Estuary
An idea about the development of water quality diagnostics in the estuary was
proposed by Krapivin et al. (1994a, b) in connection with environmental problems
of South Vietnam. Development of industry and agriculture in Vietnam poses the
problem of interial and coastal water pollution control and the synthesis of the
monitoring systems with the functions of water quality assessment in the active
regimes. Pollution levels in the Dong Nai and Sai Gon Rivers have been increasing
since 2007, affecting the development of southern provincies. International Centre
for Environmental Management and many scientiﬁc institutes of Vietnam Academy
of Science and Technology develop environmental projects directed on the envi-
ronment protection.

Vietnam has the coastal line equaled 3,260 km. There are many estuaries and
lagoons on the seashore of which the development of anthropogenic systems
depends on the sea water quality. At the same time these systems generate the
pollutants and contaminate the sea. The pollutant sources in the Vietnam are
grouped by following ﬁve classes (Bui Ta Long 1999; Bui Ta Long et al. 2010):
(1) agricultural sewage;
(2) domestic, municipal and industrial wastes;
(3) shipping;
(4) aquaculture; and
(5) coastal minings.
These sources are combined on the territories bordered to the South-China Sea.
That is why the synthesis of environment monitoring system to assess the water
quality in the estuary zone requires a systematic approach. A short description is
given below about the expert system for ecological control of estuary zone
(ESECEZ) developed in framework of collaborative agreement between Russian
Academy of Sciences and the Vietnam Academy of Sciences and Technology on
the ecoinformatics and remote sensing (Cao Van Phuong 2009a, b, 2012).
The expert system is based on the combination of modeling technology, algo-
rithms of space-time reconstruction of measurement data and computer visualiza-
tion software Block-diagram of expert system is given in Fig. 9.7 and Table 9.6.
The ESECEZ is oriented on the processes study of regulating and controlling the
release of potential hazardous chemicals into the typical for the Vietnam estuary
environment. The main functions of expert system can be realized automatically,
but not the human components. Human activity can be displayed when it is required
to explain the ecological situation or to make decisions about how to protect the
environment.

Construction of the ESECEZ is performed from the blocks which are connected
by means of the parametrical inputs and outputs. There are the blocks having the
same functional peculiarity. In framework of automatic regime a selection between
these blocks is realized in the concordance with the database. Such a block is
inserted, for which the database has the necessary parameters for the block input. A
full set of blocks activated in framework of the ESECEZ consists of all the com-
patible blocks. Realization and control of this process is realized by the SC block.
The clariﬁcation of this process is accompanied by the system response to request
the necessary data. The ESECEZ has the working regime when the users can form
the system structure in their own opinion.
The main ESECEZ function is risk assessment with the purpose of informing
groups of user about the water quality in the estuary zone. There are various
components of the risk assessment software system, each of which reﬂects a dif-
ferent approach to using the information contained in the system. The SDM block
realizes such functions as the hazard identiﬁcation, dose-response assessment,
human exposure evaluation and risk characterization. These functions are con-
formed with the Vietnam water standards. The ESECEZ generates the signals
which reﬂect the water quality in the site deﬁned by system user. The CDMP and
SDMP blocks rely on a risk assessment approach to make better regulatory deci-
sions. The users can orient on their own speciﬁcal features and decide how to use
the CDMP and SDMP blocks. In this way, the ESECEZ produces risk assessment
of the highest possible quality. Moreover, it provides that each assessment is
sensitive to site-speciﬁc conditions.
The WQC blocks are based on the sampling, laboratory analysis, data handling,
data analysis, reporting, and information utilization. The SIFC blocks regulate the
information ﬂows between other blocks and provides the necessary data for analysis
and interpretation.
Speciﬁcal features of the ESECEZ design are arisen to produce the water quality
assessment in the real estuary zone including the anthropogenic systems. One of the
most important and difﬁcult tasks here is the simulation of pollutants kinetics in the
sea water. This tasks are solved in framework of the MPKSW and MEIASLS
blocks. Typical processes in the estuaries of Vietnam coastal line are taken into
consideration. The DPD and TDR blocks realize the adaptation procedures to ﬁt the
ESECEZ for the individual estuary zone.
The process of the contaminants diffusion in the seawater depends on their state.
For example, the dissolved fraction of the heavy metals (ψ) takes part in the
biogeochemical processes more intensively than the suspended particles (e). But as
suspended particles, the heavy metals fall out more rapidly to the sediment. A
description of the entire spectrum of these processes in the framework of this study
is impossible. Therefore, the PPM block describes the processes, which have
estimates. The transport of heavy metals in the sea water includes absorption of the

9.3 Decision Making Under Dependence of Indicators
9.3.1 The Natural Disasters as a Dynamic Category
of Environmental Phenomena
With the development of civilization the urgency of the problem of predicting the
scale of expected changes in the environment, including climate, has grown. First of
all, it is a question of the appearance and propagation of undesirable natural phe-
nomena, which are dangerous (even lethal) for living beings and causing large-scale
economic losses. Such phenomena have been called natural disasters. Disasters are
distinguished between geophysical (earthquake, volcano and dry mass movement),
meteorological (storm), hydrological (ﬂood and wet mass movement), climato-
logical (extreme temperature, drought and wildﬁre) and biological (epidemic, insect
infestation and animal stampede). Economic losses and victims depend on the
disaster subgroup.
In the course of long-term evolution, natural anomalies of various spatial and
temporal scales are known to have played an important role in ecodynamics causing
and activating the regulation mechanisms for natural systems. With the develop-
ment of industry and the growth of population, such mechanisms have changed
considerably and in some cases have become of threatening level. First of all, this is
connected with the growth and propagation of the amplitude of anthropogenic
environmental changes.
Numerous studies of last decades have shown that in some cases the frequency
of occurrence of natural disasters and their scale have been growing, leading to an
enhancement of the risk of large economic and human losses as well as to
destruction of social infrastructure. So, for instance, in 2011, about 332 natural
catastrophes happened over the globe, with victims amount to more than 30
thousand people and economic losses exceeding 360 billion dollars. In 2012, 357
natural triggered disasters were registered. This was both less than the average
9.2

annual disaster frequency observed from 2002 to 2011 (394), and represented a
decrease in associated human impacts of disasters in 2012, which were at their
lowest level compared to previous years. However, natural disasters still killed a
signiﬁcant number, a total of 9,655 people were killed (annual average 2002
−2011:107,000) and 124.5 million people become victims worldwide (annual
average 2002−2011:268 million). This list can be continued. Costliest of natural
disasters is full of new losses. For example, disaster statistics of USA shows that
average affected people per year consists about 0.9 millions and economic damage
per year reaches US$18 billions.
The amount of damage depends strongly on the readiness of the territory to
reduce the risk of losses and it changes substantially in time. Maximum losses are
caused by ﬂoods and hurricanes. The spatial distribution of disasters is rather non-
uniform. On the whole, the relative distribution of the number of catastrophes by
their types and over continents is characterized by the following indicators: tropical
storms—32 %, ﬂoods—32 %, earthquakes—12 %, droughts—10 %, and the share
of other disasters constitutes 14 % (including Asia—38 %, America—26 %, Africa
—14 %, Europe—14 %, and Oceania—8 %).
Natural disasters can be classiﬁed into various categories. Large-scale catastro-
phes are environmental phenomena leading to human victims and destruction of
houses with the economic damage substantial for a given region. Hence, the scale of
natural disasters depends on the level of economic development of the region,
which determines the degree of population protection from natural disasters.
Therefore, studies of phenomena connected with natural disasters should be
accompanied by analysis of the level of poverty for a given region. The results of
studies for the last 25 years show that in developing countries the dependence of
losses due to natural disasters is much stronger than those in the economically
developed regions. Bearing in mind that during the last decade the number and
scale of natural disasters increased, on the average, 5 times and their danger 9 times,
it becomes clear, what dangers may be expected for the population of these
countries in the nearest future. There is no doubt that prediction of and warning
about critical phenomena over the globe should be of concern for all countries
independent of their economic development.
In mathematics, the theory of catastrophes has been well developed. But its
application to the description of events and processes in the real environment
requires the use of the methods of system analysis to substantiate the global model
of the Nature-Society system (NSS) with the use of technical facilities of satellite
monitoring. Solution of the problems is in the sphere of ecoinformatics, which
provides a combination of analytical simple, semi-empirical and complex non-
linear models of ecosystems with renewable global data sets. Many international
and national programmes to study the environment could have recently raised the
level of coordination in order to reach a needed level of efﬁciency. This coordi-
nation can be exempliﬁed by the programmes Global Carbon Project (GCP) and
Earth Observing System (EOS), within which most efﬁcient information and
technical facilities to evaluate and predict the NSS dynamic characteristics have
been concentrated.

The development of constructive methods of prediction of natural disasters
requires solution of a number of problems, including:
• Adaptation of methods of ecoinformatics as applied to the problem of diag-
nostics and prediction of natural disasters in all their diversity and scales.
• Formation of statistical characteristics of natural disasters in their historical
aspects, separation of categories and determination of spatial and temporal
scales of catastrophic changes in the environment. An analysis of the history of
disasters is important for understanding the present dependences between crises
in nature and society. Statistical characteristics of natural disasters in their
dynamics enable one to formulate basic principles of mathematical theory of
catastrophes and to determine the ﬁrst-priority directions of studies.
• Development of concept and synthesis of the survivability model to use it for
evaluation of the impact of natural disasters on the humans’ habitat.
• Study of the laws of interactions between various elements and processes in the
global NSS in correlation with the notion of biological complexity (biocom-
plexity) of ecosystems, considering it as a function of biological, physical,
chemical, social, and behavioural interactions of sub-systems of the environ-
ment, including living organisms and their communities. The notion of bio-
complexity correlates with the laws of biospheric functioning as a unity of the
ecosystems of different scales (from local to global). In this connection, it is
necessary to give a combined formalized description of biological, geochemical,
geophysical, and anthropogenic factors and processes taking place at different
levels of the spatial-temporal hierarchy of scales. It is important to assess the
possibility to use biocomplexity in the form of an indicator of an approaching
natural disaster.
• Study of correlations between survivability, biocomplexity, and evolution of
NSS with the use of global modelling technology. Creation of the units for the
global model, which describes the laws and trends in the environment that lead
to an appearance of stress situations and are initiated by man’s economic and
political activity.
• Consideration of demographic conditions for the origin of natural disasters and
revelation of mechanisms for regulation of the environment, which hamper the
formation of these conditions.
• Assessment of the information content of the existing technical means of col-
lection of data on the state of NSS sub-systems and available global data bases
in order to allocate them in solving the problems of evaluation of conditions for
the origin of stress situation in the environment.
As Walker (2003) noted, the deﬁnition of a natural disaster is rather vague, and
its deﬁnition depends on many factors. Grigoryev and Kondratyev (2001) deﬁned a
natural disaster as an extreme and catastrophic situation in population viability
caused by substantial unfavourable changes in the environment or “as a spasmodic
change in the system in the form of its sudden response to smooth changes in
external conditions”. The amount of such critical situations in the environment
increases. For instance, if before 1990 during the preceding 30 years, only in 1973
9.3
Decision Making Under Dependence of Indicators
743

more than one thousand tornados were recorded on the territory of the USA, after
1990 this threshold was exceeded every year.
In general, natural disasters can arise from:
• weather patterns (storms, cyclones, hurricanes, ﬂoods, tornadoes, thunderstorms),
• other climatic conditions (droughts, bush ﬁres, avalanches, colds, winterstorms),
• changes in the earth’s crust (volcanoes, earthquakes, tsunami, tidal waves).
At present, natural disasters are ﬂoods, droughts, hurricanes, storms, tornados,
tsunami. Volcanic eruptions, landslides, landslips, mud ﬂows, snow avalanches,
earthquakes, forest ﬁres, dust storms, bitter frosts, heat, epidemics, locust invasions,
and many other natural phenomena. In the future, this list can be extended due to
appearance of new kinds of natural disasters, such as collisions with space bodies
and anthropogenic ones—bioterrorism, nuclear catastrophes, sharp change of the
Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld, plague, robots’ invasion, etc. Therefore, it is important to
develop effective quantitative technologies and criteria, which would reliably warn
about possible dangerous catastrophic natural phenomenon.
Many experts associate the notion of a natural disaster with the notion of eco-
logical safety, which appeared in connection with the necessity to evaluate the
danger for human health on a given territory, constructions or possessions resulting
from the changing environmental parameters. These changes can be both natural
and anthropogenic. In the ﬁrst case, the danger is caused by ﬂuctuations in natural
processes connected with changes of the synoptic situation, epidemics, or due to a
natural disaster. In the second case, the danger occurs as a response of nature to
man’s activity. For instance, Gardner (2002), analyzing changes of the environment
in the Himalayas, on the territory of India, came to the conclusion that such factors
as deforestation and changes in vegetation cover, became the cause and intensiﬁer
of instability in this region characterized by a degradation of soil resources and
increase of the consequences of environmental destruction due to water ﬂows. Field
and Raupach (2004) as well as Abrahamson (1989) connected a change in the
pattern of the occurrence of natural disasters with the increase of instability of the
carbon-climate-man system. According to Field et al. (2002), this instability during
the nearest two decades can increase due to a change in many characteristics of the
World Ocean’s ecosystems. Milne (2004), analyzing the history of various large-
scale disasters, has come to a pessimistic prognosis with respect to the fate of
humankind, using the notion of “Doomsday”.
In general, the ecological danger on a given territory results from a deviation of
the parameters of the man’s habitat beyond the limits, where after a long residence a
living organism starts changing but not in the direction corresponding to the natural
process of evolution. As a matter of fact, the notions of “ecological danger” or
“ecological safety” are connected with the notions of stability, vitality, and integrity
of the biosphere and its elements. Moreover, the Nature-Society System (NSS) being
a self-organizing and self-structuring system and developing by the laws of evolu-
tion, creates within itself totalities of ecological niches whose degree of usability for
population of a given territory is determined, as a rule, by natural criteria (totality of
maximum permissible concentration, religious dogmas, national traditions, etc.).

Nevertheless, when considering the perspectives of life on the Earth, it is nec-
essary to proceed from common criteria of evaluation of the levels of degradation of
the environment, since in time, local and regional changes in the environment
transform into global. The amplitudes of these changes are determined by mech-
anisms of NSS functioning, which ensure the optimal changes of its elements.
Humankind deviates more and more from this optimality in its strategy of inter-
action with the surrounding abiotic, and biotic components of the natural envi-
ronment. But at the same time, the human society as an NSS element, tries to
understand the character of large-scale relationships with nature, applying many
sciences and studying the cause-and-effect connections in this system. One of such
cause-and-effect connections is a correlation of El Niño with the ozone layer. El
Niño refers to natural phenomena directly related to natural disasters taking place in
the equatorial sector of the East Paciﬁc. It is a complex of interrelated variations of
chemical and thermobaric parameters of the atmosphere and ocean. The anomalous
character of natural processes called El Niño and observed mainly near the shore of
Peru and Chili, is manifested via a sharp increase of water temperature, air pressure
decrease in the Paciﬁc and a substantial change of air ﬂuxes direction. All this takes
place over one of the most active parts of the world source of degassing—the East-
Paciﬁc elevation. The mechanism of El Niño occurrence is as follows. Hydrogen,
rising from the ocean’s bottom of the rift zone, reaches the ocean’s surface, and due
to heat release in the reaction with oxygen warms the water of the upper photic
layer. As a result, the CO2 solubility decreases, and its ﬂux from the ocean to the
atmosphere increases. From the estimates of Monin and Shishkov (1991), during
the 1982−83 El Niño the atmosphere got 6,000 Tg CO2. Besides, water evaporation
increases, which, together with CO2, enhances the greenhouse effect. The heating of
water leads to the origin of typhoons, a decrease of atmospheric pressure, and
breaking the standard trade-wind scheme of atmospheric dynamics. All these
changes trigger feedbacks that restore the equilibrium of natural processes. One of
the important regulators here is the ozone layer whose depletion during El Niño
leads to an increase of the temperature gradient between the equatorial and southern
c\sectors of the Paciﬁc.
The humans’ habitat is a complicated dynamic system. Its temporal stability is
connected with the constancy of the structure, material composition and energy
balance, as well as with stability of its response to the same external forcings. The
system’s stability can be broken due to the impact of both passive and active
external forces. In other words, under present conditions, the nature N and human
society H being a single planetary system and having hierarchical structures
( N
j j; H
j j), interact, each with the aims of its own (N, H). From the formal point of
view, this interaction can be considered as a random process η(x, t) with the
distribution law unknown, representing the level of tension in relationships between
subsystems N and H or assessing the state of one of them. Here x ¼ x1; . . .; xn
f
g is a
set of identifying characteristics of subsystems N and H, which are the components
of a possible indicator of the origin of natural disaster, that is, a deviation of
η(x, t) beyond the limits, where the state of the subsystem N threatens the sub-
system H. It follows from this that the aims and behavior of subsystems N and H
9.3
Decision Making Under Dependence of Indicators
745

are functions of the indicator η depending on which their behavior can be antag-
onistic, indifferent or cooperative. The main goal of the subsystem H consists in
reaching a high standard of living ensuring a long comfortable life. The goal and
behavior of the subsystem N is determined by objective laws of co-evolution. In
this sense, a division between N and H is conditional, and it can be interpreted as a
division of a multitude of natural processes into controlled and non controlled. It is
clear that with the growing population density, natural disasters will intensify the
feeling of discomfort, affecting the social and cultural conditions in many regions.
Without dwelling upon philosophical aspects of this division, we shall consider
the systems H and N symmetrical in a sense of their description given above, and
open. Here the system H disposes of technologies, science, economic potential,
industrial and agricultural productions, sociological arrangement, size of the pop-
ulation, etc. The process of interaction of the systems H and N leads to a change of
η, whose level affects the structure of vectors H and H. Really, there is a threshold
ηmax, beyond which humankind stops existing, and nature survives. The asymmetry
of subsystems H and N in this sense causes a change of the goal and strategy of the
system H. Apparently, under present conditions, interactions of these systems g !
gmax take place rather rapidly, and therefore some elements of vector H can be
attributed to the class of the cooperative. Since the present socio-economic structure
of the world is represented with a totality of states, a country should be considered a
functional element of the system H. The function g x; t

interaction of countries between themselves and with nature. A totality of the results
of these interactions can be described by the matrix B ¼

Many theories have been dedicated to studies of the laws of interactions of
complicated systems of various origins. In the asymmetrical case considered here, it
is a question of the survival of the system H and an attempt to ﬁnd a means to assess
the future dynamics of the system N. According to Podlazov (2001), the reﬂexive
behavior of H will help humankind, eventually, to ﬁnd a behavioral pattern “able to
weight proﬁts and danger, to understand principal limitations of our capabilities, and
to feel new threats in due time”. As Chernavsky (2004) notes, a human being is
versatile, and knowledge of this synergetic capability will make it possible in future
to describe the system H ∪N bearing in mind all social peculiarities in their vari-
ability, observing the boundaries of integral mentality of human society. Mecha-
nisms of self-organization and self-regulation of natural systems determines the
complexity of this method (Ivanov-Rostovtsev et al. 2001). Of course, deep semantic
and philosophical notions of personal architectonics, which should have been taken
into account when forming the model of vitality, at the present level of formalized
description of intellect remain beyond feasibility of present ecoinformatics.

9.3.2 Decision Making and Indicators
The acceptance and documentation of decisions is an integral part of many tasks
associated with artiﬁcial intelligence. In tasks of classiﬁcation and recognition of
images, as well as in tasks of choice and assessment, it is needed to take decisions
and to validate the alternative ones (Shutko and Krapivin 2011). In suppressing
number of cases, decision rules are made under the preposition about independence
of indicators which describe recognized and analyzed objects. Under this these
indicators are correlated and have probabilistic character. Thus, there exists the task
of the developing the decision procedure, which could take into account of cor-
relations and dependencies between different attributes.
Ensemble situations composed of S subsets of classes for the recognition is
considered:
M ¼
Mj

	
j ¼ 1; . . .; S
ð
Þ
ð9:1Þ
In this case, “ensemble” is some population of the objects (situations) for which
the notion of closeness or similarity is deﬁned. Each ensemble is described by set of
parameters or signs having dimension n. This implies that in common case
description of given class or situation includes n components:
Q ¼ Qi
f
g i ¼ 1; . . .; n
ð
Þ
ð9:2Þ
Each component Qi is characterized by speciﬁc degree of intensity or weight νi.
On the whole, recognized objects or processes are described by function that can
consider as decision rule:
fk ¼ v1; . . .; vI; . . .; vn
f
g
ð9:3Þ
Method of etalons is commonly used to solve the recognition task when etalon
base is created preliminary. Usually, in this case the decision rule is described by
expression: fk ∈Mi/Rf where Rf is some distance in space M.
Let us consider the case when the task of recognition of spectral images in
hydrophysical experiment is solved. One of algorithms of multi-channel statistical
analyzer (see Sect. 3.5.2) is the recognition of spectral images of polluted water
solutions. Space of spectral images is formed during the learning procedure with the
use of spectroellipsometric or spectrophotometer system (Mkrtchyan et al. 2011).
This procedure is realized in laboratory conditions, when spectral images and
chemical analysis are carried out at the same time. Figures 9.8, 9.9, 9.10 and
Table 9.7 show examples of spectral images delivered by spectroellipsometric
system (Fig. 9.11).
The problem of detection and identiﬁcation of the pollution spots on the water
surface, especially of oil spills, is being solved by many scientists. The recently
developed technology of an adaptive identiﬁcation of the environmental elements

from measurements in the visible spectral region permits to synthesize an expert
system for an adaptive identiﬁcation of the environmental parameters (ESAIEP).
The system’s structure includes a compact multi-channel spectroellipsometer
(MSP), information interface with computer, computer software (STW), and
extending database (Mkrtchyan and Krapivin 2014).
The principle of the ESAIEP functioning is based on ﬁxation of changes of the
light ﬂux at the MSP output and their transformation into a digital code. Further
processing of these data with respect to their efﬁciency is determined by the STW
composition containing various algorithms of recognition of 2D objects. The
adaptability of the recognition procedure is determined by the level of accumulated
knowledge about special features of intensity ﬂuctuations and polarizing properties
of the light reﬂected from the water surface. The STW includes the means that make
it possible, in case of uncertain identiﬁcation of the pollution spot, to make an
expert decision based on the visual analysis of its spectral image. This procedure is
carried out in the mode of dialogue with ESAIEP, and if decision is made, the
operator can ﬁx it in the database in the form of a standard for subsequent situations
of an appearance of similar spots. Figure 9.11 characterizes general view of the
ESAIEP.

Here QΔ is the light intensity on the photodetector output, Qψ is tangent of relative

system (BDMS). Table 9.9 gives an example of standard etalon from this base.
An identiﬁcation of spectral image for unknown water solution is realized by
means of comparison his vector—identiﬁer with elements of the BDMS. Spectral
image of water solution can be represented by one or two vector-identiﬁers calcu-
lated with the use of rule described in Table 9.8. Final identiﬁcation is realized by

Use of Eq. (9.4) gives better result in comparison with the application of other
known criteria of closeness between spectral curves. That is why in this case there is
minimal risk to miss the situation with dangerous pollution of water reservoir. In
common case, usually the following three methods are used:
• Cluster analysis. In this case two types of clusters are formed for CosΔ and
TanΨ. Decision is made by weighted value of δ from Eq. (9.4).
• Algorithm of discrepancy between spectra. It is assessed average distance
between the ordinates for both spectra and studied case and decision is made
taking into account minimal value of this distance.
• Algorithm of discrepancy between etalon vectors. In this case decision made
taking into considered minimal value of δ from Eq. (9.4).
Table 9.10 gives experimental results, which give possibility to compare these
algorithms. Dependence of risk assessment as function of solution concentration is
represented in Figs. 9.12 and 9.13. As it follows from these results, the risk to have

high error under the solution identiﬁcation is reduced when algorithm of Table 9.8
is used. We see that the risk to have high error is growing with increase of chemical
element concentration. The discrepancy between spectra is decreased with increase
of chemicals concentration. In this case, it is necessary to extend the database of
spectral etalons.
9.3.3 Decision Making and Spectrophotometric Technology
Many tasks related to the water quality assessment can be solved with the use of
simple optical devices that deliver one spectral curve. Now let us consider the case
when spectral images are received with the use of 8-channel spectrophotometer
(Krapivin and Mkrtchyan 2007a, b; Man et al. 2010). According to the rule proposed
by Bickel and Bo (2006) the sorting of the measurement data {xi} is accomplished
by the following procedure. The value R ¼ xi  x
ð
Þ=r is calculated, where
r ¼

i¼1 xi. Decision about the sample formation
is made, depending on the value R. If R [ Ro; measured value xi is not included in
the set {xi}. If R  Ro, value xi is included in the set {xi} for the following analysis.
Threshold value Ro is function of number of measurements (Table 2.22).
Both the Simulation System for Hydrophysical and Hydrochemical Investiga-
tions (SSHHI) (Fig. 9.5) and Expert System for Ecological Control of Estuary Zone
(ESECEZ) (Fig. 9.7) were tested in the framework of joint Russian-Vietnamese
hydrophysical experiments (Cao Van Phuong et al. 2009a, b; 2012; Bui Ta Long
et al. 2010; Krapivin et al. 2008b, 2009a; Krapivin and Mkrtchyan 2006a, b, 2007d,
2008; Man et al. 2011b). Measurements were carried out to study different water
reservoirs located in South Vietnam: Dong Nai River, Saigon River, coastal waters
of South-China Sea, lagoons and ﬂooded reservoirs of the ﬁshing industry. Spectral
characteristics of these objects are changed with high range. It says that charac-
teristics of water reservoirs were dynamical and their operative control was
implemented by means of SSHHI and ESECEZ. Measurements were obtained by
means of 8-channel spectrophotometer (Figs. 9.14, 9.15, 9.16). Figures 9.17 and
9.18 explain the measuring process.
Spectrophotometer connected with computer with SSHHI and ESECEZ software
according to Klimov (2010) is called Adaptive Identiﬁer. Figures 9.16 and 9.17
explain the measuring procedure in-situ when an educated system is used for
operative evaluation of water reservoir quality.
Figure 9.19 represents normalized spectral characteristics of studied water
objects. It is seen that all spectral curves I/I0 related to water quality intersect in the
point (4,1). This means that channel 4 (510 nm) is invariant for the studied reservoirs.
It should be noted that the channels 5, 6 and 7 are the most informative. Maximum of
curve S for channel 7 reveals the presence of chlorophyll-a ﬂuorescence on wave-
length 690 nm and accompanying to it the pigments in red spectrum exists.

Light intensity is attenuated by water layer according to the law I(z) = I(0) exp
(−βz), where z is the depth (m), β is the attenuation coefﬁcient (m−1). One of the
inaccurate methods for the assessment of water quality is based on the value of
parameter β. This method does not give the precise assessment of water quality.
Nevertheless, it shows how many pollutants there are into the water. Tables 9.11
and 9.12 characterize the optical parameters for a few reservoirs of South Vietnam.

The obtained results from the experimental hydrophysical investigations in
South Vietnam using spectrophotometric measurements are characterized by the
following parameters:
• Risks of the missing critical concentration of the chemical elements in water
solution are varied from 0.12 to 0.31.
• Risks of the missing critical concentration of the oil products in water solution
are varied from 0.09 to 0.22.
• Risks of the missing critical concentration of the biogenic salts in water solution
are varied from 0.16 to 0.39.
These risks depend on the forms of spectral images and on the number of
spectral channels. These risks are smaller for measurements obtained from the
spectroellipsometer. That is why decrease of these risks can be achieved by means
of coupled use of different devices and data processing methods. According to
Fig. 9.16 Functional scheme of 8-channel spectrophotometer. Results of measurements are given
by the scale of analogue-digital transformer in range from 0 to 212. Light signal is transformed in
electrical signal in range from −5 V to +5 V and after that it is expressed as digital code in the
interval [0, 4096]

Soldatov (2011) the cluster analysis application provides the possibility to reduce
these risks. The clusters that are formed in the space of the spectral images are very
well separated. It enables to reduce these risks into the interval from 0.06 to 0.17.
The Adaptive Identiﬁer is based on the employment of ESAIEP, ESECEZ and
SSHHI functions which are used for the solution of the speciﬁc problems arising
under the water quality diagnostics. The adaptive identiﬁer allows the generation of

ﬁnal product as the evaluation of physical-chemical characteristics of the water
environment using models gives its spatial and dynamic distributions. The adaptive
identiﬁer takes into account both physical and ecological processes of the water

B is the element B transformation process due to gravita-
tional settling (i = 1), transfer to the food pyramid (i = 2), decomposition under the
effect of microorganisms (i = 3), oxidizing process (i = 4), evaporation (i = 5), entry
into neutral chemical compounds (i = 6), biosedimentation (i = 7) and other pro-
cesses (i = 8).
Equation (9.5) is speciﬁed taking into consideration the condition on the uniform
distribution of the water quality at the depth z within a limited volume. The entire
water volume is divided into volumes Du  Dk  Dz. The ﬂow QB is divided into
ﬂows POL (kk,i), MARINE (i) and RUNS (ss,i) that characterize the inﬂow of the
chemical element Bi derived from anthropogenic source kk-type, bordering water
reservoir, and due to the coast drainage of ss-type, respectively. The functional
RUNS (ss,i) is based on the data shown in the Table 9.13. The GIMS database
contains series of the runoff coefﬁcients depending on the soil groups and slopes.
Considering this discretization procedure the Eq. (9.5) is changed by the system of
the ﬁnite-difference equations that is solved by traditional methods (see Chap. 1).
Tables 9.14 and 9.15 show results of the water quality control. The Adaptive
Identiﬁer that is preliminary educated allows the physical-chemical characteristics
assessment in their dynamics. The reconstruction error is no more than 7 %.

9.3.4 Monitoring of Spatial Heterogeneous Water Systems
One of function of expert systems described in Chap. 8 is the spatial image
reconstruction based on the data that are episodic in the time and fragmentary in the
space. A speciﬁc case of the ESECEZ system is considered for the monitoring of
Nuoc Ngot Lagoon located in South Vietnam (Binh Dinh province, Fig. 9.20). The
Lagoon is located at the latitude and longitude coordinates of 14.15N and
109.183333W, respectively. This lagoon is used for ﬁshing and it is located in the
zone with growing intensive agriculture and industry. Its basic characteristics are
given in Table 9.16.
Hydrophysical investigations in the lagoon zone were accomplishes in the frame
of the Russian-Vietnamese collaboration in the ecoinformatics problems. Lagoon is
divided in three levels by depth (upper, middle and near-bottom). The following
characteristics were registered: direction and speed of currents, salinity, turbidity,
phytoplankton biomass, zooplankton biomass, zoobenthos biomass. The scheme
and the procedure of the in situ measurements are given in Fig. 9.18 and Table 9.17.

• Spatial structure of hydrologic and abiotic components for Nuoc Ngot Lagoon
was reconstructed by means of the ESECEZ system on the basis of the in situ
measurements in the control points 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and the results obtained were
compared with measurements in the control points 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.
• Particular results of prognosis of some characteristics of the lagoon were
assessed taking into consideration of the in situ measurements in all control
points during the prognosis time (Table 9.18).
General concept about the ESECEZ system capability to forecast the water
quality in Nuoc Ngot Lagoon gives the results shown in Fig. 9.20. Simulation
experiments with the ESECEZ system use show that all processes in the lagoon
depend on its hydrophysical and physico-chemical interactions with South-China
Sea where input data about anthropogenic impacts are available. In this case, the
lagoon control can be realized using the ESECEZ system with input data obtained
only in the lagoon mouth Γ (controlling site 1) with time intervals according to
Fig. 9.22 (Table 9.19).
Figures 9.23 and 9.24 show phase portraits of the lagoon taking into consider-
ation of its coordinates turbidity/salinity and salinity/water level variation. It was
found that there exists a signiﬁcant maximum of the dependence between the
turbidity and salinity. This maximum obtains its minimal value in the mouth of the
river ﬂowed to the lagoon and its maximal value at the lagoon centre. The corre-
lation between the salinity and the lagoon level variation has more complex
character. Water salinity in the lagoon mouth weakly depends on the change of its

sharply reduced with increase of its depth.
Table 9.20 gives some details about the precision of the ESECEZ system under
the reconstruction of other characteristics in Nuoc Ngot Lagoon. The big discrep-

that washout processes for chemical elements from the bottom sediments are not

that the in situ measurements in these control sites register anomalous rejections.
This suggests that it is necessary to modify some ESECEZ items.

9.4 Risk Control and Sustainable Development
Assuming the deﬁnition of the sustainable development given by Kobayashi (2005)
as a basis, we shall consider its different aspects connected with the human behavior
strategy under conditions when the trend of NSS development depends on the
decision making. The level of the risk of making decisions at this stage of human-
kind development can be evaluated by not only the results obtained in the nearest
future, but also by the subsequent impacts. In that sense, the developed and currently
used ineffective strategy of the risk control of the decisions made can lead to cata-
strophic consequences. In particular, this refers to various decisions obtained by
international organizations on nature-use management, change of the Earth’s covers,
impacts on anthropogenic processes, etc. Under conditions of limited long-range
forecasting methods, an erroneous decision can cause irreversible consequences of
economic character with development of undesirable processes in the environment.

It is of great importance the fact that in the beginning of the 21st century, most of the
key indicators of the living beings’ habitat (especially those characterizing the
humans’ safety), are close to a critical state, and in some regions to a threatening
state.
The risk of the occurrence of unfavourable environmental conditions for people
is mainly connected with the probability of a natural or technogenic catastrophe
resulting from the decision made earlier. Catastrophes in general and natural
disasters in particular, threaten the human life and therefore their prediction aimed
at prevention is a useful element of science on the processes taking place in NSS.
The risk evaluation of the occurrence of a natural disaster and its subsequent
damage requires an interdisciplinary analysis of a huge information volume about
various aspects of NSS functioning. First of all, the ecological safety, taking a broad
view of this aspect of NSS, is closely connected with the socio-economic level of
the development of society on a given territory. According to Vladimirov et al.
(2000), for instance, for conditions in Russia, many indicators of the society
development are in a critical state. So, compared to Germany, Russia spends about
50 times less ﬁnance to secure the ecological safety. Other indicators, such as nature
protection expenditure and ecological losses on the territory of Russia deviate from
the rated values towards degradation by factors 2.5 and 3.5, respectively. Moreover,
most of the indicators of NSS development on the territory of Russia testify to a
negative trend in preparedness of the Russian society to prevent natural disasters
and to meet their consequences. While on the territory of many developed countries

most of the natural disasters refer to the category of “nature whim”, in many regions
of Russia they cause a marked damage. For instance, a sudden snow fall on 13
October 2004 in Cheliabinsk resulting in a 40-cm snow layer caused a 24-hr
paralysis of the urban life. Other example of catastrophic natural phenomenon is
abundant snowfalls in Siberia during the ﬁrst decade of March 2013 when
numerous roads were paralyzed and twelve people were killed.
It is thought that global warming implies more snow for Northern Hemisphere
and for Russian Siberia, in particular. The increase in snowfall in the Northern
Hemisphere was ﬁrst noted in the 1960s when satellite observation was ﬁrst
introduced. Snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere in winter is rising at a rate of
0.1 % per decade. For example, in December 2012 the area of snow cover in the
Northern Hemisphere reached its higher level in the last 130 years (at almost
3 million km2, or over 200,000 km2 above the previous record in 1985). Never-
theless, the satellite monitoring data from 1966 to 2005 showed that the mean
monthly snow-cover extent in the Northern Hemisphere was decreasing at a rate of
1.3 % per decade. For the calendar year of 2006 the average snow-cover extent was
24.9 million km2, which is 0.6 million km2 less than the 37-year average. In the
Northern Hemisphere, spring and summer exhibited the strongest decreases in
snow-cover extent. Satellite observations of snow-cover extent show a decreasing
trend in the Northern Hemisphere for each month except November and December,
with the most signiﬁcant decreasing trends during May–August.
Undiscovered mysteries of many natural phenomena require a search of the
ways of their formalized description, in order they could be predicted. Since all the
processes in NSS are somehow interconnected, the desire to create a GMNSS with
a broad set of functions is one of the possible ways to resolve the global problem of
predicting emergency situations in the environment. Statistical mean dependences
created for description of correlations between the frequency of occurrence of
natural disasters and their consequences in many cases are a sufﬁciently effective
means to make strategic decisions on the prevention of natural disasters. In that
sense, the widely known law of Richter-Gutenberg (Vladimirov et al. 2000) for the
USA territory depicts the following:
log N ¼
1:65  1:35F for floods;
1:93  1:39F in case of tornado;
0:45  0:58F for hurricanes;
0:55  0:41F in case of earthquakes:
8
>
>
<
>

:
where F is the logarithm of the annual average number of victims for the last
100 years, N is the number of events.
Knowledge of the laws of occurrence of natural disasters, ability to predict
catastrophic events and the presence of mechanisms for warning of disasters do not
provide complete protection of people and their infrastructure from losses and
destruction. These components should be requested by people with a certain level
of understanding the risk and danger perception. Vladimirov et al. (2000)
9.4
Risk Control and Sustainable Development
769

introduced the notion of “safety culture” which reﬂects the code of conduct, morals,
and emotional response to cataclysms.
Risk, as a measure of danger evaluated with numerous factors taken into
account, can serve as a guiding line to resolve the problem of control of a set of
potential factors that can disturb the human habitat and to change conditions for the
functioning of the society. Risk is a more capacious notion compared to probability
of a natural disaster. It includes a probability of an unfavourable event and the
volume of the resulting losses. In other words, risk reﬂects a measure of danger of a
natural phenomenon including estimates of the levels of adversity for different
aspects. At the same time, risk has also a subjective constituent which is measured
with the help of formal methods of decision making, taking into account an intuitive
assessment of the situation and psychological norms of perception of the envi-
ronment. Many problems are resolved at the level of acceptance of legislative acts,
which reﬂect general principles of danger assessment.
On the whole, the notion of risk covers its various sections characterizing the
components of probability of an unfavourable change of conditions of people’s
existence, including natural, economic, social, cultural, and religious factors. Each
of these sections is a complex of non-linear functions of a multitude of NSS
parameters, prediction of whose changes is the subject of the current global change
science. Here of importance are economic levers of the control of the processes of
NSS development. The relationship between economy, natural resources, and
energy in many respects determines the direction of global processes development.
In that sense, the main problem of humankind consists in a search of a compromise
between increasing needs of the growing “consumption society” and nature having
limited food and energy resources. On this way, humankind has turned out to be at
the crossroads between the strategy of globalization and regional control. As seen
from IEA (2013a, b), the level of risk to obtain an unfavourable direction of
development for many poor countries remains sufﬁciently high due to the presence
in the strategy of developed countries of an element of appropriation of excessive
resources. Therefore, the problem of inclusion of a country or a region into the
process of globalization is important from the viewpoint of evaluation of the risk of
consequences. The index of globalization used for the evaluation of this risk and
including variables, which characterize the level of economic integration, devel-
opment of technologies, political aspects and openness of the society for infor-
mation contacts does not foresee any free transmission of excessive resources from
one country to another. As of the year 2004 62 countries with population consti-
tuting 84 % of the global size, covered 96 % of the global GDP. And it would be
natural to render assistance to other countries to achieve the index of development
corresponding to the annual energy consumption 5 t of oil equivalent per head. By
2020, the emerging economies will account for around 50 % of the world economy.
By then, two-thirds of global GDP growth will be generated in those countries.
Many experts assess differently the risk of globalization strategy realization in
developed countries. Lomborg (2001, 2004) explains how the “environmental
myths” originate and propagate in order to achieve political goals by intimidating
the population with coming catastrophes. As a result, a discussion of important
770
9
Operational Diagnostics, Estimation …

problems of global ecodynamics follows a mistaken path without prospects.
Lindsey (2001) discusses political and economic mechanisms of globalization
control drawing attention to contradictoriness of the laws of economic development
in the past and future. He gives a pattern of the present course of globalization as a
favourable perspective of the future economic arrangement of the world. Callinicos
(2001) analyzes and criticizes the so-called “third way” of humankind development
which is propagated in the USA, England, and Germany with liberalism in free
economy and possible national socialism. This way will lead humankind to still
more contrasting economic differences with an uncontrolled increase of the social
inequality. Criticizing the theoretical bases of a new market, Callinicos (2001)
demonstrates the presence of the American imperial trend to political globalization.
Anderson and Anderson (2001) attract attention to the fact that along with econ-
omy, in the process of globalization no less important are culture, politics, and
biology, since people live in the world of open systems and, depending on inter-
action of these NSS components, many global processes can form. Tabb (2001)
considers the process of globalization from the viewpoint of ethics whose coordi-
nation with economy is one of the factors of prevention of negative trends in the
development of the modern society. Trade wars, capital concentration, displace-
ment of investment processes and latent restriction of social rights—these are basic
components of the present ideology of globalization.
9.5 Managing Natural Resources
9.5.1 Introduction
The problem of an optimal management of natural resources appears in the regions
of the presence of elements of the anthropogenic forcing. In this connection,
Khudoshina (1996) introduced the term “ecologo-economic system” (EES), which
formalizes the problem of managing a totality of the nature components and eco-
nomic activity and enables one to describe numerous contradictions between these
components. The efﬁciency of the monitoring system depends on the correctness of
the administrative decisions on determination of priorities, distribution and use of
resources. It is also important to have a set of efﬁcient indicators of the state of both
individual elements of the environment (air, water, soil, ﬂora/fauna, etc.) and the
system on the whole. Such indicators enable one to assess the state of the ecological
balance of the territory and to simplify thereby the problem of management of the
ecosystems located on the territory.
Real problems of managing natural resources are multi-criterion and connected
with analysis of a great number of factors, dependences between which often cannot
be formalized. Khudoshina (1996) proposed a technique to solve such problems for
an efﬁcient management of the resources in the coastal regions. This technique is
based on the method of the logico-informational modeling. This method, in turn, is
9.4
Risk Control and Sustainable Development
771

based on the principles of simulation modeling and includes two types of models:
dynamic and logico-informational. The dynamic model describes the temporal
transformation for all characteristic parameters of the system, combines a group of
models of the physical processes and determines the quantitative changes and
relationships in the system. The logico-informational model, with the help of the
Boolean algebra, assesses the quality of the system for various ranges of the values
of its parameters. The logical-informational model is based on the notion of the
functioning element characterized by the vector of state X = (Mi, {Cij}, {Pik}) where
Mi is the power of the functional element i, Cij is the indicator of the consumption
by the i-th functioning element of the j-th resource per its unit power, Pik is the
production of the k-th resource per unit power of the functioning element. The state
of the functioning element is described by a set of the Xij indicators of its provision
with the resources Cij:

:
In a general case, the estimates aH
ij and aB
ij are functions of many parameters and
of Mi, in particular.
The functioning elements of EES include groups of the population of the region,
objects of economic activity (transport, agriculture, industrial enterprises, municipal
services, parks, beaches, sanatoria, ports and levees, etc.) and natural objects. Of
course, in the synthesis of a simulation model it is impossible to reﬂect the inter-
action of all EES elements. Therefore it is necessary to select a ﬁrst-priority group
of these elements, attributing the rest of them to the background load. In analysis of
EES in the coastal regions only those objects of economic activity are chosen which
directly affect the marine environment. The scheme proposed by Khudoshina
(1996) to parameterize the EES functioning in the zone of sea-land interaction is
shown in Fig. 9.25.
Fig. 9.25 Scheme of interaction of anthropogenic factors of land and marine environment

Operational Diagnostics, Estimation …

The functioning of the EES is determined by the volume of consumption and
distribution of resources, which depends on population density. Hence, the prog-
nostic estimate of the state of EES is connected with the accuracy of the demo-
graphic model and depends on the level of interaction with other EESs. It is
necessary to bear in mind that all elements of the system consume and produce
resources, some playing a progressive role, others (e.g., pollutions) being negative.
Pollutions of the seas violate their main resource—the quality determined by a
complex of indicators. The goal of the monitoring system is to ﬁnd opportunely the
critical situations when there is a possibility of rapid xij →0.
The EES complexity is determined by the number ζ of inputs and the number β
of outputs: L(ζ,β). Assume the hypothesis of additivity of the quality of the EES
complexity:
L ¼

9.5.2 Assessment of the State of the Ecologo-Economic
System
The state of the modelled system based on the logico-informational modeling is
assessed using the Boolean algebra. For economic and natural objects two possible
states are considered: normal functioning and the working regime bug (refusal of
the system’s functioning). The function Y of the state of EES depends on the
function of the state of its elements: Y = Y1∀…∀Yк. In other words, Y = 0 if
∃Yi∈k∈{Y1,…,Yк}, Yi = 0.

The EES functioning is assessed by the totality of the states of its elements. We
have Yi = 0 in case of scarcity of at least one of the resources used by the i-th
element or its quantitative characteristics do not meet the assumed criteria. Here the
interdependent pairs and chains of the system’s elements are taken into account.
The concrete structure of the model introduces certain corrections and special
features into the logical hierarchy of division of the system into sub-systems and
elements. Especially this is characteristic of the systems with the substantially
heterogeneous structure. These systems include also the marine EES with the
biological, economic and demographic units (Fig. 9.26).
Here pollutions play the role of a negative resource. Information about the
quality of the marine environment and the state of the biota, that reﬂects the impact
of economic activity on nature, enters the controlling unit of the model. This unit
compares and analyzes the information about the state of EES on the whole. With

respect to the biological unit of the marine EES, economic and demographic units
simulate an external load in the form of pollutions, extraction of bioresources,
transformation of the habitat. Information about changes of the quality of the
marine environment, decrease of the size and diversity of populations of sea ani-
mals serves as a feedback in the model, which, of course, reﬂects on the economic
activity of EES.
The demographic unit models the power and the kinds of the external forcings
on the natural EES. The input characteristics of the unit reﬂect the need of popu-
lation for economic and biological resources as well as the quality of the envi-
ronment. The output parameters of this unit are really consumed resources,
population size and an amount of pollutants emitted to the environment.
The economic unit describes complicated feedbacks between the EES elements,
reﬂecting correlations between input and output parameters of the remaining units
as functions of the economic strategy of the system. The biological unit reﬂects the
composition of biotic communities and their trophic structure. The concrete model
realization of all elements of the scheme in Fig. 9.26 is connected with the use of
the models of partial processes described by many scientists (Krapivin and
Kondratyev 2002; Sarancha 1995; Abakumov 1993; Polishchuk 1992; Ougolnitsky
1999; Ougolnitsky et al. 2000).
9.5.3 Simulation Model of the Ecologo-Economic System
The most widely used method of the ecologo-economic analysis is a simulation
modeling which makes it possible to combine, for joint studied, the data of natural
and social sciences and to create a computer version of the system of the EES
management. This approach and its adequate application in concrete situations have
been reﬂected in many studies accomplished by various scientists. For instance,
Gorstko and Ougolnitsky (1990) described two approaches to study the EES using
the numerical models. The ﬁrst approach is based on the concepts of the optimi-
zation theory and consists in synthesis of the numerical model of the process. This
model relates the internal (endogenis) and external (exogenis) factors of the EES
functioning. The problem is to determine the management of the process of the EES
functioning, which provide an extremum of some functional that characterizes the
quality of management. In a general case, the solution of this problem is reduced to
mathematical programming or game theory.
The second approach is connected with simulation modeling. Here a set of
models of some functions of EES and expert parameterizations (scenarios) is cre-
ated, which forms the basis of the simulation experiment on the search of an
optimal management of the system. The simulation model is more complicated
compared with the numerical model, it has a greater dimensionality, contains a
multitude of non-linear direct couplings and feedbacks between the variables. As a
rule, the simulation model has more ﬂexible capabilities to assess the efﬁciency of
the expert choice of the controlling functions to optimize the EES functioning.
9.5

It requires the development of extensive software for the computer search of the
optimal or sub-optimal management. The structure of the simulation system is
shown schematically in Fig. 9.27. The most important part of the simulation system
is a unit of models of the object under study. This unit can include the duplicating
elements with different adequacy and, which is especially important, various
requirements for databases. The information retrieval system provides an agreement
of the database with the set of partial problem-oriented models and adjusts the
simulation model for the dialogue with the operator. The existing standard means of
many programming languages make it possible to realize these procedures in the
forms providing an accomplishment of a simulation experiment by the user without
certain skills and knowledge in the ﬁeld of informatics.
The simulation systems of the Sea of Okhotsk, the Aral Sea and the Sea of Azov
can exemplify these simulation systems (Krapivin and Kondratyev 2002; Krapivin
and Phillips 2001a). In the ﬁrst case the anthropogenic factor is sufﬁciently small
compared with the climatic impact on the ecosystem. On the contrary, the Aral Sea is
subject to powerful anthropogenic forcings. In each case, in the synthesis of the
simulation system it is necessary to take it into account, to ﬁll the database and the
base of knowledge with the needed reliable information. Following Gorstko (1979),
consider the case of modelling the ecosystem of the Sea of Azov and the related
problems. Its catchment basin covers the space 43o–54oN and 33o–46oE with an
areas of about 0.5 million km2 and population 35 million people. The Azov basin
involves numerous anthropogenic forcings: developed agriculture with irrigation,
heavy and light industry, oil and coal extraction, ﬁshery, network of macadamized
roads and railways, food industry, recreation zones. The simulation model of the Sea
of Azov created by the Rostov scientists includes 150 components of its state divided
into 16 units (Table 9.20). The model database includes extensive information
obtained during many decades in the process of natural-scientiﬁc observations of the
Sea of Azov ecosystem. The components of the vector of the sea state are functions

of time and calculated in accordance with dependences included in the base of
knowledge. For instance, the equation of the oxygen balance is written in the form:
dOi tð Þ=dt ¼ f1  f2  f3f4 f5;
where Oi is the concentration of oxygen in the water of the i-th section of the sea; f1
is the input of oxygen into the i-th section; f2 is the oxygen consumption by bottom
sediments; f3 is the oxygen expenditure on respiration of benthos animals; f4 is the
oxygen expenditure on oxidation of organic matter; f5 is the loss of oxygen on
decomposition of pollutants. The simulation procedure, which foresees a digitiza-
tion of the sea area into non-intersecting zones (sections), provides a correlation of
the functions Oi (t) through exchange ﬂuxes between these zones.
Another example of the simulation model is the model of the aqua-geosystem of
the Aral Sea basin. In contrast to the Sea of Azov, here the scales are greater and the
information supply is smaller. There is also a considerable difference in the inter-
action of natural and anthropogenic factors. During the last decades, the remote
monitoring systems have become the main source of observed data (Krapivin and
Phillips 2001a).
The development of irrigation world, the respective complex of hydrotechnical
measures, as well as secondary processes-consequences have substantially changed
and continue to change the natural, economic and ecological situations in some
regions of the Middle Asia. On this basis, the development and introduction of the
simulation technology, as applied to the EES analysis in conditions of arid climate,
have become one of the acceptable approaches to develop the management strategy
and a complex of optimization measures in the NSS.
The conceptual models listed in Table 9.21 reﬂect the basic mechanisms and
trends of the change of the natural situation in the Aral basin in 1960−1980 with a
sufﬁciently negative result—ceasing inﬂow if river waters into the Aral Sea and
degradation of the natural-economic situation in this region. The situations in other
regions are sufﬁciently problematic (the Tashaus and Khoresm oases, Sarakamysh,
the zone of Kara-Kum canal, etc.). It follows from these schemes, in particular, that
the water component in the Middle Asia region has been and remains the leading
object of studies, prediction and optimization(management) Table 9.22.
On the whole, the system of units of a general model—simulation of the current
natural-economic situation in the region is as follows. It includes the units: water
component, salts, ecological situation, economic load, macro- and meso-climatic
background, mass- and energy-exchange at inputs—outputs, direct couplings and
feedbacks (Kojima 1998).
Here is a general scheme of the distribution of water in the complex of aqua-
geosystems “Amu Darya river—Kara Kum canal—Aral Sea—Sarakamysh”.
Receipt (input)—precipitation onto the territory (X) + the Amu Darya ﬂowing off at
the station of the Kara Kum Canal (R0). Expenditure: (a) water scoop into canal

Introduced notations make it possible to write for each sub-system of the Aral
Sea basin the following traditional balance relationships:
• For the zone of the Kara Kum canal
R1 þ X ¼ Rj þ Rd þ U0Uv  U1 þ U2 þ Ew þ E0 þ E1 þ E2
• For the zone of Amu Darya from the canal to Sarakamysh
R0 þ X ¼ R1 þ Rj þ U0UvU1 þ Ew þ E0 þ Ev ¼ R2 þ R3
• For Sarakamysh R2 + X = Ew
• For the Aral Sea
X þ R3 þ RS ¼ Rj þ U0U1Uv þ Ew þ Ev þ E1 þ E2 þ Rakk  Uw;
where Uw is the return sub-ground waters.
For the whole system, many scientists have studied relationships of the water
balance, with a consideration of the synoptic situation and of dependences of its
components both on each other and on other factors (Krapivin and Kondratyev
2002; Bortnik et al. 1994). The transition to dynamic equations requires additional
information about the character of correlations between the elements of the envi-
ronment, anthropogenic processes and hydrophysical constituents of the system.
Since there are irrevocable losses in the system (Ug+U2), there should exist the
balancing branches of the hydrological cycle. Apparently, these branches exist in
the ﬂows of moisture in the region, which, by their character, play a dual role. So,
for instance, Krapivin and Kondratyev (2002) considered a situation when a forced
irrigation of saline lands and takyrs was carried out on the eastern coastline of the
Caspian Sea at optimally chosen time moments. As it turned out, the resulting
additional evaporation according to mean-statistical synoptic scenario has improved
the hydrological situation in the Turan lowland, and with the forced precipitation it
was possible to restore the level of the Aral Sea during 10–12 years. Of course, such
calculations raise questions, but they show how to study and to search positive
forcings on the natural-anthropogenic system.
9.6 Risk Control in Cases of Natural Disasters
An optimization of the risk of insurance from natural disasters becomes every year a
more urgent problem, since economic losses increase and become practically poorly
predictable. For instance, the insurance payments only for destructions from the
hurricane Hugo in 1989 constituted 5 billion dollars exceeding by more than 50 %
maximum losses from the earlier natural catastrophes. However, 3 years layer the
insurance payment for losses from the hurricane Andrew exceeded the losses from
9.5
Managing Natural Resources
779

the hurricane Hugo almost 4 times. Examples of comparison of unexpectedly large
insurance losses grow in number.
The problem of risk control as a quantitative measure of NSS property to ensure
the habitat safety on a given territory is a complicated mathematical problem of
optimization which is successfully solved using logical-and-probabilistic methods
(Solozhentsev 2004) based on construction, solution, and study of LP-function of
risk and safety of the structural-complex systems. Boolean algebra and its combined
use with methods of numerical modeling of processes taking place in NSS is a
mathematical basis for these studies. The informative characteristic of such an
approach to evaluation of the risk of the occurrence of a natural catastrophe is
determined by accuracy of prediction of development of natural-anthropogenic
processes on a given territory and reliability of produced scenarios, which substitute
for individual elements of this forecast.
According to Solozhentsev (2004), to assess the efﬁciency of risk control, one
should use discrete multitudes of parameters {Zj}, which affect the efﬁciency, and
the scale Y of the efﬁciency indicator. In this case, an introduction of the goal
function F = N1c + ⋯+Nkc, where Njc is the number of correctly identiﬁed events
on the scale Y in the class j, and maximization of F make it possible to determine
the weights of factors affecting the efﬁciency. The complexity of this problem is
determined by lack of reliable data on statistical characteristics of these factors.
Appearing difﬁculties can be overcome with the use of methods of assessing the
level of self-organization and self-regulation of natural systems (Ivanov-Rostovtsev
et al. 2001) and synergetics (Chernavsky 2004). In particular, the use of D-Self
theory gives a possibility to introduce a generalized characteristic of the NSS state
in the form of non-linear function n0 ¼

, where ξ0, ξI, and n

parameters which meet three axioms:

ii. hierarchy of elements within and beyond NSS;
iii. contingency between discrete elements of hierarchy of the structure within the
system (ξi) and beyond the system ðn

Synthesis of the D-Self model as applied to NSS is an individual problem and is
not considered here. We mention only that according to Ivanov-Rostovtsev et al.
(2001), the method of modeling the evolutionary dynamics of natural systems based
on D-Self technology has some features in common with the evolutionary modeling
technology (Bukatova and Makrusev 2003). In both cases the evolution of the
natural system is considered as a discrete process of a change of its states in some
parametric space. In the case considered, the economic indicators and social
infrastructure of the territory are made into a separate level of hierarchy of
parameters and considered as indicators of the risk efﬁciency. Other characteristics
of NSS functioning are considered as external parameters.
The frequency and intensity of natural disasters increase, which is well seen
from data in Figs. 7.3, 7.4 and 7.5 and Tables 7.5 and 9.22. Respectively, economic

damage from natural disasters grows (Tables 9.23, 9.24, 9.25, 9.26, 9.27,
Figs. 9.28 and 9.29). Therefore, detailed analysis of relationships between param-
eters of natural disasters and regional NSS characteristics such as infrastructure,
level of economic development, state of social order, level of people’s education
and attitude to religion are an important stage of development of a regional strategy
to meet the consequences of natural disasters.
Losses from natural disasters between 1987 and 1997 reached the level 700
billion dollars, and this means that for poor countries, meting the consequences of
natural disasters in the years to come will become an insoluble problem. For
instance, in 1998, total economic losses from natural disasters constituted 65.6
billion dollars, 66 % of them falling on developing countries. It is clear that eco-
nomic mechanisms of support to regions damaged by natural disasters should be
optimized with the real state of NSS taken into account. From estimates of the
World Bank, poverty is characterized by the following indicators:
• one third of population in developing countries are poor, 18 % of them being
beggars;
• about 50 % of the poor and 50 % of beggars live in South Asia;
• poverty prevails in rural localities;
• basic means of subsistence for the poor are obtained from agriculture.
Development of infrastructure plays an important role in poverty reduction. But
it is the infrastructure that is most damaged by natural disasters. So, in Asia almost
70 % of natural disasters fall on ﬂoods, each ﬂood causing damage estimated
recently at about 15 billion dollars, losses in agriculture contributing most.
Therefore the problem consists in reducing the risk at the expense of infrastructure
transformation. In developing countries the solution of this problem is connected
with an optimization of processes of the use of land resources and working out
strategies of ecological character. It is necessary to take into account the indicator of
the growth of population density in developing countries. The quantitative and
qualitative dynamism in the urban development leads to a super-proportional

increase of vulnerability of such territories. This trend of developing countries is
provoked by either economic interests or socio-political factors of a given region,
when a large number of people are concentrated over a small area, which drastically
increases the risk of people’s life in case of a natural disaster. On the other hand, in
this situation, protective constructions can be easily built. Therefore the problem of
the regional infrastructure optimization becomes more urgent in time (Gurjar and
Leliveld 2005). To some extent, the solution of this problem is favored by the plan
of putting into practice decisions of the World Summit on Sustainable Development
(Johannesburg, South Africa) adopted at the 17th plenary meeting on 4 September
2002. This plan foresees a mobilization of technical and ﬁnancial assistance to
developing countries in order to balance the economic, social and ecological
development of all regions of the world.
The ratio between economic losses in case of a natural disaster and real insur-
ance arrangements for subsequent ﬁnancial investment to liquidate consequences is
one of the key problems in the formation of strategies of insurance companies. One
of the successful attempts to formalize the appearing processes is the use of the
models of catastrophes in assessment and control of the risk of extreme events
(Grossi and Kunreuther 2005). The authors lay emphasis on the risk of natural
disasters and discuss the urgent problems of controlling risk from terrorism. The
goal of the study was to reduce the losses from potential dangers. The Pennsylvania
University tested the proposed technology, carrying out several numerical experi-
ments, which showed that the model approach to planning the ﬁnancial risk from
natural disasters makes it possible to optimize the insurance of extreme events. The
necessity of this is seen from the data in Tables 9.27 and 9.28, which demonstrates
a very non-uniform regional distribution of the ration of total losses from natural
disasters. And if, in addition, one takes into account the distribution of losses by the
types of events (Table 9.23), it becomes clear that the model optimization can
substantially raise the effects of insurance of these events.
Flood is one of the most destructive and frequent natural events. Analysis of the
consequences of numerous ﬂoods which occurred already in the 21st century shows
that they markedly change the social and economic development of the regions. In
connection with the real danger of ﬂoods for the society, the European Economic
Community decided to ﬁnance the RIBAMOD (River Basin Modeling) project
aimed at solving the problem of the hydrological risk control, covering the most
important themes (Beven and Blazkova 1998):
• accumulation of databases on watershed basins, which can initiate ﬂoods;
• assessment of risks from decisions on protection and reduction of the conse-
quences of ﬂoods;
• development of technologies of planning measures on ﬂood prevention and
operative interference into the ﬂood control;
• planning of interactions of different groups of specialists when working on
lessening the damage from ﬂood;

• working out recommendations on accomplishing engineering and social mea-
sures whose realization during the ﬂood can be hindered or impossible but
necessary; and
• analysis of uncertainties which can appear with a threatening ﬂood or its
occurrence due to climatic or other natural processes.
Most of the countries that suffer ﬂoods have services for prevention of and
protection from ﬂoods. The structure and equipment of these services are deter-
mined by the regional special features of the causes of ﬂoods. But regardless of this,
there are general problems of assessment of the risk of life, infrastructure, and
economy from ﬂood. One of the most effective ways to solve these problems is to
predict the hydrological processes at regional and global levels. Efﬁciency of such
predictions depends on information content of the systems of nature monitoring.
A natural disaster always leads to economic losses. In poor countries the pop-
ulation becomes even poorer. The discussions of sustainable development acquire
the meaning of people’s survival, and problems of the environmental protection and
search of NSS equilibrium at a regional level become of secondary importance
(Freeman 2000). A natural disaster destroys the infrastructure as a key component
of the economic growth of the region. For almost 18 % of the global population,
poverty becomes critical, and with an occurrence of a natural disaster in their
habitat a complicated social situation is always created, and the way out of this
situation is only possible with an assistance of developed countries. Therefore a
reduction of the risk of economic losses from natural disasters in developing
regions is one of the ﬁrst-priority problems of global ecodynamics (Krapivin and
Varotsos 2007, 2008; Krapivin and Shutko 2012).

9.7 Social and Human Dimensions of Risk
Human society in its development has approached the state when correlation
between processes in the environment and social organization of the society reaches
critical values at which the behavior of even one man can drastically change the
global processes. For instance, Tony Blair declared in November 2005 at the
meeting of 20 countries in London that the Kyoto Protocol should be reconsidered
and that science will ﬁnd the ways to resolve the global warming problem. He also
said that politically no country wants to sacriﬁce its economy to resolve the
problem. Other ways of its solution should be found, which would not restrict
the economic growth and keep a check on the processes of life improvement in the
world. It is this statement of one man that opens up ways to search mechanisms of
raising the living standards and poverty eradication.
According to Letz (2000), humankind has crossed the threshold of systems
adaptation, which makes it possible to damp out deviations from acceptable values
of NSS parameters and to preserve the habitat; therefore, immediate measures are
needed on formation of a new view of the processes in the environment. Especially
it concerns a technocratic paradigm which determines the decisions and respective
mentality of national leaders. Therefore, the socio-political constituent of risk is
very important in its evaluation and determination of the task for the society to
prevent damage from potential consequences of the made decisions. Among the
problems to be resolved by government authorities, the following are most
important:
• reduction of the level of risk of the social vital activity due to public policy in
the sphere of neutralization of negative processes in the environment;
• an increase of the socio-political stability of the society by formation of insti-
tutional and informative conditions for preparation of population to actions
under extreme circumstances;
• an increase of mobilization capabilities of the society for preventive and ade-
quate response to originating threats;
• development of the legal basis and respective structures to meet the conse-
quences of extreme events and disasters of natural and technogenic origin.
As Churin (2005) noted, the social processes in the modern society have no
purpose-oriented control, and therefore it is difﬁcult to evaluate the risk of decision
making. The interconnection of social and natural processes practically in all
regions of the planet is determined by their interactivity. Therefore, regulation of
social processes inevitably tells upon the functioning of natural systems, and this
certainly leads to a necessity to develop legal mechanisms for transition to sus-
tainable development.
A decision on the level of potential risk of possible change in the environment
can be made on the basis of analysis of pre-history of such events and using the
methods of prediction of natural events. As a rule, risk assessment methods are
based on statistical processing of data on parameters of the processes whose
9.7
Social and Human Dimensions of Risk
787

interaction can initiate undesirable changes in the environmental characteristics. For
instance, when assessing the risk of human health from the environmental pollution,
to make a serious decision, a certain level of the informative description of the
territory is needed:
• multi-year observations of concentration of chemical elements with their indi-
cated allocation and characteristics;
• data on hydrology of the territory and synoptic characteristics;
• assessment of ecological consequences of pollution and their impact on human
health;
• characteristics of the state of protective constructions and the level of devel-
opment and technical equipment of services for monitoring, prevention and
meeting extreme situations.
An efﬁciency of the systems of risk assessment depends on the form and kind of
the applied procedure of decision making (Potapov et al. 2006; Garsey and
McGlade 2006; George 2002). The most informative is when prediction procedures
are combined with an environmental monitoring regime, which can foresee situa-
tions of decision-making in a real time on the basis of information accumulation
before the decision was made or from analysis of database fragments with no time
reference. Statistical analysis of several events that follow the functioning of the
monitoring system can be carried out by numerous methods whose applicability in
each case is determined by the totality of probabilistic parameters that characterize
the phenomenon under study. However, non-stationary and parametric uncertainty
in situations when each observation requires much effort and expense prompt a
search for new methods of decision-making on the basis of observation data that are
fragmentary both in time and in space.
With development of alternative methods of making statistical decisions, the
problem of ﬁnding objective estimates of the perimeters of processes taking place in
the environment has been substantiated anew. It is possible to consider and compare
two approaches to this problem: classical approach based on a-priori restricted
number of observations, and successive analysis based on the procedure of step-by-
step decision making. The development of computer technologies facilitates real-
izing both approaches in the form of a single system of making statistical decisions.
The classical and sequential procedures of making statistical decisions by the
Neumann-Pearson (Neyman and Pearson 1933) and Wald (1947) methods were
described in Chap. 3.
The notion of risk is closely connected with the notion of uncertainty of pre-
diction of the development of events in the NSS undesirable for humans. By
deﬁnition of Burgman (2005), risk is the chance of occurrence of an unfavorable
event within some time interval. For the NSS such intervals are measured by
centuries, and the society, ﬁrst of all, wants to know the prospects for life
improvement. However, the state of the current environmental science does not
provide a guaranteed solution of this problem, and therefore it is necessary to search
constructive technologies of risk assessment. One of the reliable and constructive
approaches to the solution of this problem is an expansion of the GMNSS
788

functions. In particular, the number of various uncertainties which hinder a reliable
prediction of global ecodynamics is so large that without their purpose-oriented
analysis and selection all their interactions cannot be formally taken into account in
the global model. For instance, of millions of chemical compounds and species of
living organisms, only thousands have been adequately studied.
One of the numerous factors of the evolutionary processes development in the
NSS are sudden changes of the environmental characteristics that lead to stresses
for living organisms with their possible death. In various periods of evolution, the
scale and signiﬁcance of individual factors had changed. The role of catastrophic
processes taking place during 11,500 years in the present civilization development
is being studied within two international ICSU programs: “ Dark Nature—Rapid
Natural Change and Human Responses” (started in 2004) and “The role of Holo-
cene environmental catastrophes in human history” (2003−2007). The main goals
of these projects are to:
• examine how past societies and communities reacted in the face of harmful
change;
• explore the implications of rapid natural change for current environmental and
public policies;
• focus on the inter-disciplinary investigation of Holocene geological catastro-
phes, which are of importance for civilizations and ecosystems.
A longer period of the Earth system’s evolution has been considered by Condie
(2005) who has analyzed the interaction of various components of the planet for the
last 4 million years, selecting those which have affected the history of the land
ecosystems, oceans, and the atmosphere. The current period is characterized by an
increasing trend of anthropogenically caused natural disasters, such as ﬂoods, forest
and peat-bog ﬁres, deforestation, desertiﬁcation, and epidemics. Of course, not
always is it possible to distinguish between the causes of a natural disaster. But one
fact is apparent—the present ecodynamics is followed by an increase of the number
of extreme situations in the environment. Unfortunately, presence of statistics for
natural disasters no allows their prognosis with high reliability. Events of the 1998
ﬂooding in Bangladesh, the 2004 megathrust earthquake in Sumatra (Indonesia)
and the 2013 typhoon Haiyan on Philippines when was killed over then 50,000,
230,000 and 6,000 peoples, respectively, are examples of the abrupt natural events.
The contribution of different types of disasters to human losses and the economic
damage varies from year to year, but maximum victims result from earthquakes,
ﬂoods, snow storms, and tsunami. For instance, of 700 natural disasters recorded in
1998, winter storms and ﬂoods occurred in 240 and 170 cases, respectively, and the
resulting economic losses constituted 85 % of all losses. In Europe, in mid-
November 1998, more than 215 people were frozen to death.
Natural disasters were during last years various. There have been 620 tornadoes
reported in the U.S.A. in ﬁrst six months of 2013 with 44 fatalities. 102 fatalities
have been conﬁrmed worldwide in ﬁrst six months of 2013. Several wildﬁres cover
numerous regions in Russia, U.S.A., Australia and Europe during summer 2012 and
2013. Intense ﬂoods were practically everywhere during last three years.

The signiﬁcance and scale of critical situations in the environment depends on
the state of many NSS components. As a rule, natural disasters are evaluated in the
context of damage to human life and economic activity. However, it is well known
that, on the other hand, natural disasters are an important factor of ecodynamics
from local to global scales. As Lindenmayer et al. (2004) note, for many processes
that determine the ecosystems dynamics, natural disasters are of the key importance
as factors that regulate such processes. Therefore Wright and Erickson (2003)
discussed the problem of taking into account the impact of natural disasters within
the problems of the numerical modeling of the environmental change. Special
attention has been recently paid to forest ﬁres which, being an important component
of ecodynamics, are mainly of anthropogenic origin and cause both material
damage and humans’ death.
Forest ﬁres occurring regularly in various global regions have more and more
become a factor of the ecosystem’s dynamics, which is manifested through ﬁre-
induced emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols to the atmosphere. According
to available estimates, about 30 % of tropospheric ozone, carbon oxide and carbon
dioxide contained in the atmosphere are determined by the contribution of forest
ﬁres. Aerosol emissions to the atmosphere connected with forest ﬁres can sub-
stantially affect the microphysical and optical characteristics of the cloud cover,
leading to climate change. So, satellite observations over Indonesia have demon-
strated, for instance, that the presence of smoke in the atmosphere due to prolonged
ﬁres has led to precipitation suppression, which has further favored the develop-
ment of ﬁres. In this context, Ji and Stocker (2003) performed a statistical pro-
cessing of the data of TRMM-satellite measuring rains in the tropics as well as of
TOMS (total ozone mapping spectrometer) data for the period January 1998–
December 2001 in order to analyze the laws of the annual course, intraseasonal and
interannual variability of the number of forest ﬁres on a global scale. During this
period, there was a clear annual course of ﬁres in south-Eastern Asia with a
maximum in March, and in Africa and in North and South America—in August. An
analysis of data revealed also the interannual variability of forest ﬁres in Indonesia
and Central America correlating with the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
cycle in 1998−1999. In 1998, the boreal forests burned out over vast territories of
Russia and North America. Fires covered the territory about 4.8 million ha in boreal
forests of Canada and USA and 2.1 million ha in Russia.
There appears a clear correlation between variability of the atmospheric aerosol
content and the above variations of the frequency and intensity of forest ﬁres. An
exception is the region of south-Western Australia where intensive ﬁres recorded
from the TRMM data were not followed by smoke layers formation (from the
TOMS data). With the Australian region excluded, the coefﬁcient of correlation
between the number of ﬁres and AI (from the TOMS data) constitutes 0.55. The
statistical analysis of data using the calculated empirical orthogonal function (EOF)
revealed a contrast between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres as well as the
existence of the intercontinental transfer of aerosols originating from ﬁres in Africa
and America. The data of statistical analysis point to the presence of 25−60-day
intra-seasonal variations superimposed onto the annual change of the number of
790

ﬁres and aerosol content. A similarity has been found out between the inter-seasonal
variability of the number of ﬁres and dynamics of the Julian-Madden oscillation
(Kondratyev and Grigoryev 2004).
As McConnel (2004) has justly noted, so far it remains unknown why some
forests have suffered fragmentation, degradation and loss of biodiversity, while
other forests remain in a good state and even expand. There is no doubt that an
increase of population size, further enhancement of the scale of market relations and
an intensive development of various economic infrastructures belong to important
factors of the observed deforestation. Factors acting against these processes are
measures on nature protection favoring the preservation of forests. Finally, the
forest cover dynamics is determined by a complicated and interactive totality of
such factors as biogeophysical processes, increasing population density, market
relations, various disturbing forcings (forest ﬁres including) and institutional
microstructures.
Forest ﬁres affect the formation of global carbon cycle. Really, global scale of
forest ﬁres have recently become equivalent in area to the territory of Australia. The
atmosphere receives almost 40 % of global CO2 emissions, 90 % of forest ﬁres
being of anthropogenic origin. This means that the balance of natural factors is
heavily broken, and the laws of natural evolution are strongly violated.
Among other natural phenomena affecting the environmental dynamics are
volcanic eruptions, dust storms and thunderstorms. One of the consequences of a
large-scale volcanic eruption is a powerful atmospheric pollution, which can lead to
a climate change in some regions or even on a global scale. So, in particular,
aerosols connected in many respects with emissions of sulphur dioxide during the
1991 Pinatubo eruption have led to a global decrease of temperature in the lower
atmosphere in 1992 by about 0.5 °C. Also, it was noted that in 2 years the level of
the global ozone content decreased by 4 % compared to the preceding 12-year
period. And though during the last century there were no drastic climate changes
due to volcanic eruptions, in the historical aspect such situations did take place. So,
73,500 years ago due to the Toba eruption on the Sumatra island, the global
atmospheric temperature decreased by 3−5 °C. The area of glaciers increased and
the Earth’s population decreased (Oppenheimer 1996). As a result, 600 volcanoes
existing now on Earth can, in principle, be a global threat to population, since they
can seriously change climate and affect thereby further development of the NSS.
Dust storms occurring in places with dust and strong winds, like volcanoes, play
a similar role in the environmental change. Dust propagates at great distances
affecting negatively plants and soils as well as causing a strong pollution of the
lower atmosphere for long time periods. In the regions with a thin vegetation cover
and arid climate, dust storms take away the fertile soil layer damaging thereby the
plants. Dust storms occur periodically, for instance, on the plains of Central and
Western states of the USA during heavy hurricanes. Sometimes they last for several
days, raise dust up to 1.5–1.8 km and partially to 5–6 km, and transfer it at hundreds
and even thousands of kilometers towards the Atlantic Ocean. Catastrophic dust
storms are connected with destruction of the soil-plant cover in steppes and par-
tially-wooded steppes, as well as in the regions of intensive agriculture. Along with
9.7
Social and Human Dimensions of Risk
791

the short-duration impacts and marked damages, dust storms create a regular
constituent of the global ecodynamics which can manifest itself in decades and even
centuries.
Thunderstorms play a special role in the environmental change. Lightning dis-
charges occurring practically in all latitudes, affect the photochemical reactions in
the atmosphere and are a factor of ﬁre risk. From available estimates, 1800 thun-
derstorms, on the average, occur at any moment on Earth, each being followed by
200 lightning ﬂashes per hour (or 3.3 ﬂashes per minute). From satellite observa-
tions, the global frequency of lightning ﬂashes averages 22–65 ﬂashes per s.
Observations from Microlab-1 satellite gave 44 ± 5 ﬂashes per s, which corresponds
to 1.4 billion ﬂashes per year. The use of Microlab-1 data has made it possible to
draw global maps of the frequency of lightning discharges in different seasons. An
analysis of these maps has shown that lightning discharges occur mainly over land,
and the ratio between their number over land and ocean averages approximately
10:1. About 78 % of lightning discharges fall on the latitudinal band 30°N−70°S.
The all-the-year-round regime of lightning discharges is most intensive in the river
Congo basin where the average frequency of ﬂashes reaches (in Rwanda) 80 ﬂashes
per km2 per year, which corresponds to conditions in the Central Florida State
(USA). The all-the-year-round intensive regime of lightning ﬂashes is characteristic
of the northern sector of the Paciﬁc Ocean where under the inﬂuence of cold air
advection over the warm ocean surface the atmosphere becomes unstable. In the
eastern sector of the tropical Paciﬁc and in the Indian Ocean, where the atmosphere
is warmer, the lightning discharges are not that frequent. Maximum frequency of
lightning occurrence in the Northern Hemisphere falls on summer, whereas in the
tropics, lightning discharges are characterized by a semi-annual cycle.
In the northern regions, an important constituent of the controlling mechanism of
evolution are strong frosts, whose impact on vegetation cover depends on plants’
hardiness. Jönsson et al. (2004), with the Norwegian spruce Picea abies as an
example have studied the response of boreal forests to temperature changes. It has
been shown that sudden temperature variations cause changes in wood compact-
ness, and that an expected climate change can change the vegetation cover.
During the last years, in connection with discussions of the causes of potential
climate change, of key importance have been estimates of uncertainties of values
which serve the basis for conclusions about climate change and measures to prevent
it. Particularly important is the problem of assessing the levels of GHGs emissions
to the atmosphere connected, ﬁrst of all, with solution of the problem of global
carbon cycle. It is evident that without a reliable veriﬁcation of available estimates
of emissions all discussions concerning the ecological beneﬁt of various measured
and respective expenditure are abstract (Nilsson et al. 2002). For instance, how can
the ﬁnes for not meeting recommendations on GHGs emissions reduction be sub-
stantiated if it is impossible to prove that emissions in 2012 will differ from those in
1990? So far, in the course of discussions on the Kyoto Protocol problem, quan-
titative estimates of uncertainties of the levels of GHGs sinks have been ignored
(especially it concerns the biosphere). Uncertainties of the estimates of total CO2
ﬂuxes are, however, very substantial (exceeding 100 % in Russia). Calculations of
792
9
Operational Diagnostics, Estimation …

the errors in the estimates of total GHGs ﬂuxes gave *±5−25 %, whereas the
levels of GHGs emissions reduction foreseen by the KP average about 5 %. An
average global situation is illustrated, for instance, by the fact that uncertainties of
the estimates of GHGs emissions due to the systems of energy production are
approximately equal to uncertainties of the estimates of CO2 assimilationby the
biosphere and land.
In this situation, solution of the problem of the estimates uncertainties (ﬁrst of
all, the matter concerns reliable information on carbon cycles) and veriﬁcation are
particularly important. Solution of the veriﬁcation problem requires a common
opinion of its mechanisms, which is also of great importance from the ﬁnancial
point of view. Results of simulation modeling indicate, for instance, that if the
conﬁdence level of GHGs emissions reduction by 5.2 % is raised from 50 to 95 %,
it will lead to an increase of expenditure on measures to reduce GHGs emissions by
factors of 3−4. The main conclusion is that science should serve as the compass for
recommendations on measures in the ﬁeld of ecological policy. In this respect, the
COP-6 failure can be a healing shock (Nilsson et al. 2002).
A serious uncertainty of the estimates of a potential anthropogenically induced
climate change and its determining factors has brought forth a heated discussion on
these problems both in scientiﬁc literature and in mass media. For instance, in the
interview to a journalist from “Scientiﬁc American”, Professor R. Lindzen from
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA (Lindzen et al. 2001; Lindzen and
Giannitsis 2003) said that his anxiety about speculative opinions of climate change
emerged in 1988 when J. Hansen (Director of Goddard Institute for Space Studies,
New York) announced in public that a global climate warming has resulted from an
increase of CO2 concentration due to emissions to the atmosphere caused by fossil
fuel burning (Hansen and Sato 2001). This announcement has made R. Lindzen
explain that climate science is only at an initial stage of development and, in
particular, there is no consensus on the causes of climate change. In early 2001 he
reported at the meeting of the US Cabinet on the problem of climate change. The
fact that the global mean surface air temperature (SAT) increased by *0.5 °C
during 100 years, and the atmospheric CO2 concentration increased by *30 %,
does not reﬂect a cause-and-effect feedback between CO2 concentration increase
and temperature increase. Lindzen et al. (2001) believe that the most reliable
estimate of climatic sensitivity (SAT increase at a doubled CO2 concentration) is
0.4 °C, and it means lack of a basis for anxiety about the catastrophic global climate
change in future.
According to IPCC mandate, the problem posed before IPCC is to prepare an
overview of “any climate change with time, both natural and anthropogenic”. Pielke
(2002) noted, however, that at least two climate-forming factors have turned out to
be either unreliably considered or left out of account at all:
(1) impact on global climate of anthropogenic changes of land surface
characteristics;
(2) biological impacts of the growing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere (effect
of fertilization including) (Tianhong et al. 2003).
9.7
Social and Human Dimensions of Risk
793

If both these factors are really substantial, the conclusion suggests itself that an
agreement of the results of the global climate numerical modeling is accidental (in
fact, the matter concerns the global mean annual mean SAT).
In this connection, Pielke (2001a, b, 2002) discussed information which con-
ﬁrms the signiﬁcance of both these climate-forming factors and expresses his
opinion about possibilities to check the basis for this conclusion. For this purpose
data can be used on the impact of anthropogenic changes of land surface charac-
teristics on local, regional and global climate, which illustrate the fact that this
impact is also should be taken into account, like the impact of CO2 doubling in the
atmosphere (as well as an increase of other GHGs concentrations). Also important
is the fact that the atmosphere-surface interaction is characterized by the presence of
various non-linear feedbacks, and therefore it can be impossible to predict a climate
change for periods longer than a season.
As for potential biological impacts of CO2 concentration growth, they are
manifested through short-range (biophysical), middle-range (biogeochemical), and
long-range (biogeographical) impacts of landscape-forming processes on weather
and climate. The biophysical impact includes, for instance, the effect of transpira-
tion on relationship of latent and sensible heat ﬂuxes as surface heat balance
components. Biogeochemical impacts include the effect of the growth of plants
(“fertilization effect”) on the leaf area index, from which evaporation takes place, on
surface albedo, and carbon supply. One of manifestations of biogeographical
impacts is a change in time of the species composition of plant communities.
Numerical modeling results indicate that without consideration of biophysical/
biogeochemical impacts, an assessment of climate change cannot be reliable
(Bounoua et al. 2002).
Further development of climate models should contain, in particular, a consid-
eration of the following aspects of climate formation:
(1) direct and indirect impacts of landscapes dynamics through biophysical,
biogeochemical, and biogeographical processes;
(2) consideration of anthropogenic changes of land use on various (local, regional,
and global) spatial-temporal scales; and
(3) assessment of possibilities of climate forecasts for longer periods than a sea-
son, bearing in mind the functioning of numerous non-linear feedbacks which
determine the atmosphere-surface interaction.
The openness of these and other problems reduced the signiﬁcance of the IPCC-
2001 Report and the US National Report as containing only an assessment of global
climate sensitivity to changes of some climate-forming factors.
In the long process of preparation of the three published already IPCC Reports
(Houghton 2003, 2004), more and more complete analyses of climate-forming
factors (e.g., apart from GHGs, atmospheric aerosols have been considered) and
various feedbacks have been carried out. But nevertheless, the available very
complicated numerical climate models cannot be considered sufﬁciently adequate
from the viewpoint of consideration of all substantial climate-forming factors. A
new step forward in the IPCC-2001 Report was a consideration of the forcing F of
794
9
Operational Diagnostics, Estimation …

anthropogenic land use changes on climate limited, however, by a consideration of
only the impact of land use dynamics, starting from 1,750, on surface albedo. The
obtained estimates gave an average F value equal to −0.2 W·m−2 with an uncer-
tainty interval 0∕−0.4 W·m−2. Thus such estimates are highly uncertain, and this
concerns even the sign of F (a more complete consideration of biophysical, bio-
geochemical and biogeographical impacts of the land use evolution on climate has
led to the conclusion that in this case F > 0).
In this connection, of importance is a new range of potential global warming by
2,100 assumed in the IPCC-2001 Report (1.4−5.8 °C) based only on the numerical
modeling data (and therefore it will inevitably change in future). Also, the problem
is that this new range cannot be directly compared with the earlier similar values.
From the viewpoint of reliability of the estimates of future climate change, of
importance is the use in the IPCC-2,001 Report of the term projections instead of
predictions, since the latter implies that the factors left out of account will not be
substantial in the future. It is unacceptability of the latter supposition that is the
reason why none of the specialists in the ﬁeld of numerical modeling will assert that
the climate can be predicted 100 years in advance. This conclusion conﬁrms the
results of numerical modeling carried out in (Andronova and Schlesinger 2001).
The complexity of the problem of prognostic assessments of climate, especially
of selecting the contribution of anthropogenic component is illustrated by the
remaining inconsistency of analysis of the climatic impact of clouds. Tsushima and
Manabe (2001) have analyzed the impact of cloud feedback (CF) on the formation
of the annual change of global mean SAT using the data of space observations of
the Earth’s radiation budget (ERB), bearing in mind an assessment of adequacy of
CF consideration in numerical climate models by comparing the calculated and
observed change of the global mean SAT. It follows from the observed data that the
global annual change of SAT is in phase with the annual change of SAT in the
Northern Hemisphere, and its amplitude constitutes 3.3 K (this in-phase character is
determined by concentration in the Northern Hemisphere of continents contributing
most to the formation of the amplitude of the annual SAT change).
Analysis of the data of the ERB components observations for the period from
February 1985 to February 1990 has shown that global mean values of both
shortwave and longwave radiative forcings (SWRF and LWRF) depend weakly on
the annual change of global mean SAT (the ERB data considered refer only to the
band 60°N–60°S). Thus the cloud cover dynamics causes neither increase nor
decrease in the annual change of SAT. The data on SWRF and optical properties of
clouds show that not only albedo but an amount and top height of clouds depend
weakly on SAT and hence, CF does not affect strongly the annual change of the
global mean SAT.
It could be drawn from this conclusion that the impact of CF on the annual
change of the global mean SAT or on the global warming is negligible. However,
this speculative opinion is dangerous in view of strong complexity of the spatial
ﬁeld of SAT. Calculations with the use of three climate models which take into an
interactive account the dynamics of the microphysical properties of clouds have led
to the conclusion about a substantial increase of the cloud top albedo with
9.7
Social and Human Dimensions of Risk
795

increasing SAT, which disagrees with the data of observations. This situation
reﬂects the prospects for comparison of assessment of the role of cloud feedbacks
from the data of numerical modeling and observations from the viewpoint of
models validation.
Lomborg (2001, 2004) is of course right rejecting apocalyptic predictions of
global ecodynamics based on exaggerated fear of limited natural resources and the
environmental state. Such opinions and assessments are conﬁrmed, in particular, by
the data of Holdren (2003), which characterize both real and potential global energy
resources. The energy units are expressed here (in case of non-renewable energy
sources) in TW-year, which is equivalent to 31 exa-J

consumption constituted about 15 TW or 15 TW-year  year1 with an assumed
increase up to 60 TW-year  year1 by 2100.
Despite the optimistic data by Holdren (2003), the absence of long-range
prospects for development of the present consumption society illustrated by global
ecodynamics estimates (Krapivin and Varotsos 2007, 2008) raises no doubts.
Therefore at the World Summit on Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg
in 2002, a necessity has been emphasized of accomplishing 10-year programmes in
order to achieve stable production and consumption, which included the following
recommendations (Starke 2004):
• developed countries should undertake the leading role in provision of stable
production and consumption;
• these goals should be achieved on the basis of common but differentiated
responsibility;
• the problem of stable production and consumption should play the key role;
• the young generation must take part in the solution of the problem of sustainable
development;
• the “polluter pays” principle should be practiced;
• control of the complete cycle of products evolution from their production to
consumption as well as waste in order to raise the production efﬁciency;
• support should be given to politics that favors the output of ecologically
acceptable products and rendering of ecologically adequate services;
• to develop more ecological and effective methods of energy provision and
liquidate energy subsidies;
• to support free-will initiatives of industry aimed at raising its social and eco-
logical responsibility; and
• to study and introduce an experience of ecologically pure productions, espe-
cially in developing countries as well as in small- and medium-scale business.
Though the enumerated recommendations are rather declarative, they still clearly
point to the necessity to change the paradigm of the socio-economic development
(primarily in developed countries) from the consumption society to priorities of
public and spiritual values. A concrete analysis of the ways of such development
requires a participation of specialists in the ﬁeld of social sciences. Some related

opinions were expressed by Corcoran (2005) in the Introduction to The Earth
Charter in Action. Therefore, the question whether a human can change climate
needs further studies (Borisov 2005).
Finally, preliminary conclusions drawn from the above are as follows:
• the existing climate models cannot be used to make decisions and assess the risk
of accomplishing the anthropogenic scenarios;
• the level of uncertainty of climate forecasts ca be reduced due to a broader
consideration in global models of interactive bonds in the NSS and mechanisms
of biotic regulation of the environment as well as improvement of the global
monitoring system; and
• the use of hydrocarbon energy sources in the 21st century will not lead to a
catastrophic climate change if the Earth covers are preserved and the World
Ocean is protected from pollution.
9.8 Reducing Risks in Agriculture
9.8.1 Introduction
Uncertainty and risk are quintessential features of agricultural production. Main
sources of uncertainty and risk are connected with the causes which inﬂuence on
agricultural production:
• the amount and quality of output that will result from a given bundle of inputs
are typically not known with certainty, i.e., the production function is stochastic;
• presence of uncontrollable elements, such as weather and absence reliable
prognosis of many agronomy processes;
• price uncertainty is a standard attribute of agricultural activities;
• technological uncertainty is always the cause of excided risk; and
• policy uncertainty creates considerable risk for agricultural investments.
Unfortunately, basic rationality postulates in the agricultural risk are connected
with economic models. Technological and nature-oriented risks are studied least of
all. Decisions about environmental risks typically focus on the evaluation of con-
sequences, and estimates of consequences are complicated by uncertainty. Some
problems of environmental risks are discussed by Krapivin and Varotsos (2007,
2008). It is clear that agricultural risks are some fragment of policy decisions for
sustainable management that are based on the reasonable certain knowledge base
the effective use of which is possible in framework of GMNSS.
One of the main problems in framework of modern science is the estimation of
the biosphere survivability in the conditions of the increasing anthropogenic impact.
Such estimation can be realized by using the biosphere model. Well-known
attempts in direction of the synthesis of a global model give unsatisfactory results.

Social and Human Dimensions of Risk

Created global models have educational character and no give possibility for the
real estimations. For the last years many investigators put a problem of creating of
reliable and effective systems for control of the environment state in the global scale
including agricultural sphere. Generally this problem includes elaboration of
technical means for collection, storage and transfer of the data of the nature medium
state and (from the other side) development of methods for processing these data.
The existing means for collection of information about natural objects and pro-
cesses give a possibility to form the data set, covering large territories up to the
whole biosphere. Remote means of environmental monitoring become especially
effective. In this context, Nitu et al. (2004) have formulated the basic model of the
biosphere survivability and proposed a new view on the global modeling.
The behavior of any system is determined by the value which can take on
different terms characterizing the state of the system. Upon interaction with an
external medium and in particular with other systems, the values of these terms can
vary in one way or another. For any technological or biological system it is always
possible to show the ﬁeld of change of the characteristic parameters, wherein the
system can be considered to be functioning. Outside this ﬁeld the system does not
exist.
Thus one can substitute the complex behavior of a system by a description of the
behavior depicting this system by a point in phase space of the characteristic
parameters. If the change of any coordinate leads to the disappearance of the
depicting point from the allowable ﬁeld, the system is demolished (the organism as
a whole perishes).
A system is deﬁned by its structure and behavior. The behavior of such a system
is aimed at providing uninterrupted functioning by means of a correspondingly
organized structure and behavior. This characteristic of the complex system to
actively withstand the hostile action of an external medium, we shall refer to as
survivability (Nitu et al. 2000a, b, 2004; Krapivin and Shutko 2012). The key
questions to be answered within the numerous investigations of global ecodynamics
are:
• What are the level, interactions, and signiﬁcance of “human dimension” (socio-
economic factors) in the development of society and its role in global envi-
ronmental changes?
• What are the present and possible future impacts of the global environment
variability on economic development, what factors determine the capability of
society to react to the occurring changes, what are possibilities to provide a
sustainable development and to reduce the man’s sensitivity to forcings?
• What are the possible methods of decision making in the interests of sustainable
development under conditions of NSS complexity and high-level uncertainties
regarding the global environment variability?
• What are the possible impacts of the global environmental changes on human
health; what information about ecodynamics and socio-economic factors is
needed to evaluate the respective cumulative risks for human health?

Most substantial directions of developments connected with answers to these
questions include, in particular, the following:
(1) Regional problems of ecodynamics. Of primary importance here are studies of
the problems of power supply, reconstruction of ecosystems, recovery of
human health, and special phenomena such as droughts and forest ﬁres al local
and regional levels. In this connection, an integration of physics, chemistry and
biology with respective socio-economic aspects taken into account should play
a decisive role, which will help to make adequate decisions in ecological
policy. Studies of the dependence of forest ﬁres on climatic conditions can
serve as an illustration of possible approaches to the solution of such problems,
and the main goal is the prediction of anthropogenic wildﬁres.
(2) Analysis of economic efﬁciency. The complexity of quantitative assessments of
the economic efﬁciency of one or another ecological policy is determined by an
ambiguous choice of this policy with priorities taken into account. In this
context, of great importance is the use of simulation models of ecodynamics,
especially the models of changes in land supplies of carbon to assess the
response of carbon supplies in vegetation and soil to speciﬁc features of land
use and changes in land surface characteristics, to variations of the atmospheric
CO2 content, and to climate. Solution of such problems will provide a more
reliable prediction of global trajectories of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere.
(3) Possible consequences of global climate changes for forestry and agriculture
over the country territory. Analysis of such changes with various scenarios of
possible changes in global climate suggested the conclusion that in the case of
several scenarios, the impact on forestry and agriculture in the country will be
economically favorable. Partly, it is connected with the growth of forests
production (with a CO2 concentration increase) and determined by capability
of forests to adapt for climate change. As for agriculture, according to avail-
able prognostic estimates for a long period, positive impact of the global
warming on agriculture in the country will be less economically favorable than
it follows from the earlier estimates.
(4) Impact of UV solar radiation on human health. Intensive developments in this
direction are being carried out to study the impact of the lowering level of
biologically active UV solar radiation due to decreasing total ozone content in
the atmosphere on the agricultural production.
Talking risks assessments we mean at least 5-folds (5-levels) interpretation or
deﬁnition:
(1) theory of different kinds of risks;
(2) experimental studies of risks in conditions of natural and man-made disasters;
(3) remote sensing application for risks determination (microwave radiometry
allows to obtain by practically direct way the risks assessments);
(4) risks assessments in AIMS; and

(5) creation of state-of-the art of the technological complexes for strategic
determination of risks of hunger throughout the World by developing aero-
space complexes.
9.8.2 Practical Microwave Radiometric Risk Assessment
of Agricultural Function
Advanced technology for the assessment of soil hydrological regimes for agricul-
tural purposes using multichannel passive (radiometric) and active (SAR) micro-
wave measurements were developed by many authors (Krapivin and Shutko 2012;
Shutko 1986). Physical background of the technology, the equipment used,
examples of experimental data, and prospects of the technology application were
described by Shutko et al. (2007, 2010).
The problem of the Earth’s environment monitoring and land use control has
been growing in importance over the last 20–30 years. The successful solution of
this problem requires research, development and application of different remote
sensing technologies. Among these technologies there are radio-physical remote
sensing methods and instruments that play an important role in the Earth’s surface
investigation. These methods and instruments are based either on the measurements
of the parameters of natural radio-thermal electromagnetic radiation from the
Earth’s surface or on the measurements of the parameters of artiﬁcially radiated
electromagnetic signals scattered by the Earth’s terrain. In the ﬁrst case, the remote
sensing tools are called either Microwave Radiometers (MR) or Passive Microwave
Radar (PMR); in the second case, the tools are called either Side-Looking Airborne
Radar (SLAR) or Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), or Nadir Viewing Radar (NVR)
with hyper-short (nanoseconds) length of pulses, etc. These instruments are being
installed on board of aircraft and satellites and orbital stations and tested in many
scientiﬁc campaigns.
Research team of the Kotelnikov’s Institute of Radioengineering and Electronics
of Russian Academy of Sciences and Radioengineering Corporation “Vega” of
Russia has developed an advanced technology for the assessment of soil hydro-
logical regimes using multispectral passive (radiometric) and active (SAR) micro-
wave measurements (Gulyaev et al. 2009; Haarbrink et al. 2011; Shutko et al.
2006a, b). These technologies are aimed to measure:
• surface soil moisture;
• underground moistening at different depths (proﬁling);
• depth to a shallow water (down to 2 m in humid areas and down to 3−5 m in
arid/dry areas, (to 10 m for active system);
• groundwater resources presence;
• contours and amount of water seepage through hydro technical constructions
(levees); and
• biomass of vegetation above a water surface or wet ground.

Passive system includes airborne scanning multi-channel radiometer “Radius”
(2.25, 5.5, 21, 43 cm) and a set of non-scanning radiometers (2.25, 6, 18, 21, 27 cm).
Active system includes airborne multichannel SAR system (3.9, 23, 68, 254 cm).
Successful tests of this equipment have been conducted in Russia, Ukraine, Uzbe-
kistan, Turkmenia, Moldova, Bulgaria, Cuba, USA (Krapivin and Sutko 2012).
Microwave radiometry or passive microwave remote sensing is based on mea-
surements of the natural electromagnetic radiation of objects and Earth covers in the
millimeter to decimeter wavelength range. Inside this band, the land surface radi-
ation is primarily a function of free water content in soil and also inﬂuenced by
other parameters of the soil-canopy system, such as above ground vegetation
biomass, soil density, water salinity and temperature of the system. Free water
content in soil is dependent on rainfall rate, artiﬁcial watering, shallow groundwater
and processes of soil drying of at interface soil-atmosphere. Hence microwave
radiometry is an important tool for the assessment of soil hydrological regimes
(Shutko 1986, 1992; Krapivin and Shutko 2012).
The measure of the intensity of radiation in the microwave band is referred to as
a brightness temperature Tb, which is a product of emissivityκ, and thermodynamic
temperature Te, within the effectively emitting layer of the object: Tb = κTe. The
emissivity is a function of dielectric permittivity/permeability of the object/surface
of observation. For a land surface, the dielectric permittivity is ﬁrst of all a function
of soil moisture. The higher a soil moisture content, the higher the permittivity of
soil, the lower the emissivity/intensity of radiation/brightness temperature of this
piece of land. For a water surface, the dielectric permittivity is ﬁrst of all a function
of electric conductivity of a water solution that is dependent on a concentration of
salts, acids, on a presence of oil ﬁlms and many other chemical substances. For
example, the higher salinity of water, the higher the dielectric permittivity of water
solution, the lower the emissivity/intensity of radiation/brightness temperature of
this water body (Gulyuev et al. 2005).
Within the 2 to 30 cm band, for air temperature t = 10−30 °C, the radiation
characteristics of several surface types are shown in Table 2.13. Table 2.14 shows
the sensitivity of radiation in the X-band (2−3 cm) and L-band (18−30 cm) to the
changes in free water content in bare soil, soil density, salinity and temperature of
the soil surface (Shutko 1986). These data show that the main parameter affecting
the intensity of a bare soil radiation, practically independent of spectral band, is the
soil moisture. Based on this sensitivity it is feasible to estimate the value of soil
moisture without a priori data on the soil parameters. It has also been seen that even
for rather high values of biomass, up to 2–3 kg/m2, the plant canopy is still
transparent in the decimeter wavelength range.
There are different sources of natural microwave radiation in microwaves, which
can inﬂuence on accuracy of measurements: Galaxy, ionosphere, atmosphere
(clouds), land. The minimum inﬂuenced by different sources of radio-noise is 2-cm
to 21-cm wavelength band, which is window of transparency at microwaves. The
centimeter and decimeter wavelength microwave radiometers are not inﬂuenced by
the conditions of illumination, by presence of fog, smoke, clouds, and are very
useful for measurements in different meteorological conditions (Shutko 1992).

Radar (SAR) survey or active microwave remote sensing is based on mea-
surements of the parameters of artiﬁcially radiated electromagnetic signals scattered
by the Earth’s covers and objects. Due to high spatial resolution radar systems are
very important instruments of remote sensing from space. Previously studies of
scattered signal from soil and vegetation were conducted using on-ground and
airborne scatterometers and radars. The results of these studies are the dependences
of scattered signal on soil moisture, soil surface roughness, vegetation parameters,
etc. (Chukhlantsev and Vinokurova 1991; Chukhlantsev 1992).
Theoretical models for electromagnetic waves scattering by bare soil are based
on Kirchhoff approximation. Different expressions were obtained for the back-
scattering coefﬁcient r0
s but most of them may be written as
r0
s ¼ hehFðklSin#ÞRsCos2# þ rðh2Þ; h ¼ 4k2r2Cos2#;
ð9:24Þ
where σ is the standard deviation of rughness height, l is the roughness correlation
length, k is the wave number in free space (2π/λ), ϑ is the nadir viewing angle, R is
the soil reﬂectivity (Chukhlantsev 1992).
Analysis of formulas (9.24) showed that
• The sensitivity of the electromagnetic wave scattering by bare soils to reﬂec-
tivity variations of bare soil surface doesn’t depend on roughness parameters,
wavelengths and observation angle; dynamic range of scattering by bare soils is
no more 9 dB, when reﬂectivity varies from 0.05 (very dry soil) to 0.4 (very
high soil moisture); 6–8 gradations of reﬂectivity may be obtained with an
accuracy of soil backscatter measurements of 1.5 dB
• Maximal dynamic range of backscatter by bare soils is equal to about 18 dB,
when standard deviation of roughness height σ varies from 0.5 to 4 cm.
• There are two independent parameters: the standard deviation of roughness and
the reﬂectivity. It is obvious, to separate and to estimate the reﬂectivity (soil
moisture) and roughness parameters, it is necessary to use measurements at
minimum 2 frequencies. The best separation of these parameters is observed for
observations at wavelengths satisfying the condition: h(λ1) ≈1, h (λ1) <<1; that
produces wavelengths 10 and 24 cm.
These conclusions were veriﬁed by experimental data. Quantitative and quali-
tative analysis showed that radar data may be good tool for soil moisture mea-
surements. It is possible to obtain 6−8 gradations of soil moisture for bare soil and 3
−4 for soil covered by vegetation (Chukhlantsev 1992).
It has theoretically been shown and experimentally proven in investigations
(Kutuza et al. 2000) and in the studies conducted by other teams that active and
passive systems are sensitive to soil moisture changes and to changes in surface
roughness, peculiarities of relief, vegetation biomass and structure, and angles of
observation. In general, the terrain features, surface roughness, changes in relief,
and vegetation characteristics inﬂuence the radar return more than natural emitted
radiation, other conditions being equal.
802

Operational Diagnostics, Estimation …

The approximate ranges of radar return changes are as follows: 6–8 db for whole
range of soil moisture changes; 10–18 db for whole possible scale of roughness
changes; 8–10 db for vegetation characteristics changes; 6–8 db for changes in angle
of observation, 30° < Θ < 60° off nadir. Now, let the changes in radar returns caused
by soil moisture changes be referred to as signal, and the changes in radar returns
caused by the changes in other than moisture parameters referred to as noise. Then,
the signal-to-noise (s/n) ratio calculations will result in a s/n = 0.33–0.8 for
roughness, a s/n = 0.6–1.0 for vegetation, and a s/n = 0.75–1.33 for changes in angle.
Similarly, calculations of the signal-to-noise ratio for the naturally emitting
radiation are higher: s/n = 2–5 for roughness, s/n = 1–3 for vegetation, s/n = 2–3 for
changes in angle. This shows the beneﬁts of using passive systems, in spite of a more
coarse spatial resolution and a smaller swath, in combination with active systems.
Microwave remote sensing equipment was partly described in Chap. 2. An
experimental usage of this equipment for solving agricultural tasks has shown high
effectiveness and decreasing risks related with well-timed evaluation of basic char-
acteristics of agricultural soils including soil salinity and its humidity, as well as the
crop maturity. Figure 9.30 compares the different penetrative ability of L-, P-, and
VHF-band radars to see a ground surface through vegetation cover. In L-wavelength
band, the signal is mainly dependent on canopy characteristics. The P- band returns
are much less affected by grass vegetation and a back-scattered. It clearly indicates the
effect of a soil and water surface along with some effect of vegetation. The VHF-band
image clearly demonstrates no effect of canopy on signal returns for grass and bushes.
More detailed consideration of the raised problems are given in Chap. 2.

Calculation of the hydrological characteristics of agricultural ﬁelds based on data
of microwave monitoring as input information for the RIMS gives possibility to
increase the crops and to control the quality of soil resources. As Krapivin and
Shutko (2012) repot, some experimental investigations of the RIMS were realized
during spring of 2007 on the Bulgarian territory using Miramap ﬂying laboratory
equipped by microwave radiometers (Fig. 2.7). Some results are given in Figs. 2.14,
2.15, 9.31 and 9.32. The RIMS input information was quantized topographic maps

of the RIMS results was conducted on the basis of remote sensing and in situ data

observational data does not exceed 5 %.

are indicative of the increasing devastation and variety of disasters. This chapter
draw attention to the fact that risk and disasters threaten development and security.
The scale of damage and aftermath reduction of stressful natural processes is
possible with the use of the GIMS technology.
Operational diagnostics of the environment is accomplished using the model that
is synthesized for the concrete monitoring object. These models are stored in the
GIMS knowledge base and than are selected automatically during the GIMS
adaptation process according to the scheme represented in Fig. 9.33. This model
describes the interactions and functioning of different spatial-temporal levels of
whole of environmental processes that affect the monitoring object functioning.
Model covers natural and anthropogenic processes that are speciﬁc for given ter-
ritory during concrete time interval and the GIMS supports the model information
inputs.
As it was mentioned above and was expressed by many experts (Krapivin and
Shutko 2012; Shutko and Krapivin 2011; Kondratyev et al. 2004a; Hushon 1990)
the synthesis of the model is complex problem to achieve the expected results. The
GIMS-technology helps to solve this problem due to the intellectual data processing
and the sorting through of models and algorithms. Certainly, conceptual description
of the solved task is connected with ﬁxed semantic ﬁeld that is given in the GIMS
knowledge basis depending on the series of meanings. The environmental sub-
system complexity and partial parametrical uncertainty are overcome by the GIMS-
technology due to the evolutionary modeling technology (Bukatova et al. 1991).

Ecoinformatics Problems in the Future
World
10.1 Problems, Perspectives and Waitings
As it was mentioned by Krapivin and Shutko (2012) that ecoinformatics is the science
of information in ecology and environmental science. This book demonstrates different
deﬁnitions, semantic structures, algorithms, methods, and models that help to
parameterize various environmental processes in the nature-society system. One of
main ecoinformatics objectives is to develop new effective informational technologies
for the detection and prognosis of environmental factors that are signiﬁcant for human
life. Really ecoinformatics is an interdisciplinary study between ecology, GIS, math-
ematical modeling, and computer science. Ecoinformatics promotes novel exploitation
and integration of ecological data and knowledge by means of state-of-the-state
simulation technology. Ecoinformatics and GIMS technology are leading-edge
technologies transforming the ways data that are collected and analyzed.
Environmental science such as ecoinformatics emerged practically at the same
time in series publications in Russian Federation (Arsky et al. 1992; Krapivin and
Potapov 2002) and United States (Kaeiva 2001; Brunt et al. 2002). Dengler et al.
(2011) consider the ecoinformatics as ecological science that develops biodiversity
informatics. The ﬁeld of ecoinformatics provides concepts, methods and standards
to guide management and analysis of ecological data with particular emphasis on
exploration of co-occurrences of organisms and their linkage to environmental
conditions and taxon attributes. Moreover, ecoinformatics develops new informa-
tion-modeling technologies for future global change research with special focus on
important environmental problems connected with human society survivability.
Nature-society system evolution depends on the numerous economical, social,
natural and technological processes taking place both in regions and world. Coupled
investigation of these processes is principal problem of its sustainable development.
Effective instrument to solve regional and global problem of sustainable develop-
ment is based on the combined use of knowledge from different sciences. One of
such instruments is the GIMS-technology described in above chapters. It is evident

that creating universal technology for global model of nature-society system is
unlikely. Unfortunately, knowledge accumulated by the humanity does not cover all
problems of global sustainable development that was discussed by many experts
(Brucan 1984; Cozzi 2003; Cracknell 2009; Cracknell et al. 2009a, b; Krapivin and
Varotsos 2007, 2008; Homer-Dixon 2008; Binenko et al. 2004; Degermendzhi 2009;
Stoddard et al. 2003). Many of them have demonstrated the absence of constructive
algorithms for existing data processing. This default lies mainly in the “dimension
perdition”, i.e. the weakness to take into consideration of interactions between all
subsystems of the nature-society system.
Nevertheless, Degermendzhi (2009) and Degermendzhi et al. (2009) proposed
new view on this problem and developed new directions in biophysical ecology that
is based on small-scale models. This approach is based on simple scheme of the
most obvious interactions between processes in the nature-society system. These
interactions can have positive, negative or uncertain effects. Analogous simpliﬁed
approach to the nature-society system modeling was proposed by Cracknell et al.
(2009b) and Krapivin and Kelley (2009). It is clear that the choice of the effective
model for global and regional ecological investigations requires simpliﬁed repre-
sentations of interactions in the nature-society system. Basic difﬁculty arises in the
choice of climate model.
Nowadays, the problems of globalization and sustainable development have
been discussed in a vast scientiﬁc literature. Even more numerous are the concerns
raised in the mass media. However, discussions of such problems contain many
contradictions and disagreements. First of all, globalization and sustainable
development problems are treated, as a rule, as independent and separate. Never-
theless, the priority of the globalization problem and subordinate importance of
sustainable development problems as one of the most important aspects of the
globalization processes raises few doubts.
A constructive view on the globalization and sustainable development problem was
ﬁrst broached by Russian scientist Kirill Ya. (Kondratyev et al. 1992, 1994, 1997). The
development of globalization theory took a number of different directions that were
often contradictory and colored by socio-political biases (Friedman 2005; Mander and
Goldsmith 2006; Wijen et al. 2005). Global socio-political issues have a long history
beginning with the era of colonialism. After 1917 there existed two periods: the pre-
and post-Cold War eras. The post-Cold War era led to the increasing inﬂuence of what
some people these days call quasi-governments (such as the International Monetary
Fund or the World Bank). This delimitation served for a certain time as the cause of
principal difference between the existing concepts of globalization process. At its most
basic, there is nothing mysterious about globalization in spite of these differences. In
fact, there exist two main conceptions of globalization:
(i)
Globalization that brings prosperity to certain countries while impoverishing
other countries.
(ii)
Globalization as the objective process behind development of the nature-society
system (NSS), taking into account existing global population dynamics.

Ecoinformatics Problems in the Future World

In the ﬁrst case, many experts around the world identify the globalization with
“Americanization” of economics and culture (Friedman 2005). The rest of the
world seems to be following the U.S.A. and leaving behind its own ways of life.
“Americanization” is the contemporary term used for the inﬂuence that the U.S.A.
has on the culture and economics of other countries, substituting their way of life by
the American way. This process is managed by the many international structures
under the control of the U.S.A. Signiﬁcant social networks and international forums
have been organized with the purpose of proliferating capitalist interests. Some of
these forums date from earlier in the twentieth century, such as the International
Chamber of Commerce, the International Organization of Employers, Center for
Environmental Diplomacy, and the Bretton Woods Committee. They were created
as a speciﬁc response to questions about globalization (Furth 1965; Devkota 2005).
These and other organizations and forums continue to attend to the interests of
developed countries in 21st century as well.
Reformists of global social democracy put forward the theory of neoliberal
globalization which proposes the transformation of social ambience in the world. The
countries of the Former Soviet Union have fully faithful negative consequences of
this theory. Therefore, the question “what is globalization?” is becoming principal
question today. Many experts see it as a primary economic phenomenon involving
the increasing integration of national economic systems through the growth in
international trade, investment, and capital ﬂows. Other experts deﬁne globalization
as social, cultural, political, and technological exchanges between countries. As the
result two alternatives were formed: anti-globalization and pro-globalization.
The alternatives to globalization promoted by anti-globalists include different
approaches to the dynamics of world structure:
• recognition of importance of free trade and investment for economic growth and
development, but there also exist data that trade and investment have in fact
increased poverty and inequality;
• sustainable development is best achieved through a single framework, inte-
grating environmental protection and the promotion of economic growth and
social equity;
• innovation is necessary for sustainable living;
• support of the accumulation of power at the local level;
• implementation of trade barriers to protect local production and renunciation of
international trade unless goods or services cannot be produced locally;
• free trade usually beneﬁts wealthy countries at the expense of poor countries;
and
• environmental protection is the key to sustainable development and is impera-
tive for economic development.
The argument of pro-globalization groups is based on the promotion of free trade
as the key to eliminating poverty and ensuring effective development and that
market instruments such as intellectual property rights are necessary to protect the
environment and promote development. Supporters of globalization argue that it
can be rolled back and point to the period between the First and Second World

Wars as evidence. The increase in world trade as a proportion of world GDP was
proportionately greater between 1870 and 1914 that it has been since 1975. That
expansion was stopped, not just by the First World War, but by the loss of support for
free trade that followed. This led directly to the 1930 depression and indirectly to the
Second World War. All these changes took place when the world population did not
exceed 2 billion. At present time the situation is rapidly changing with the expo-
nential growth of world population exceeding 6.6 billion. Therefore, globalization
process is becoming an inevitable phenomenon of world life. It is for this reason that
the list of the following key questions on globalization must be answered:
• Is there any alternative to globalization in the coming decades?
• What are the environmental impacts of globalization?
• How does globalization affect culture and religion?
• What is globalization and when did it start and how does it depend on popu-
lation size?
• Who are the players in the interactions between nature and society?
• Why is there global inequality, and is it getting worse?
• What are the cost and beneﬁts of free trade?
• What
is
the
role
of
the

and

technology
in
globalization?
• Is globalization shifting power from nation states to undemocratic organizations?
• Is globalization resulting in industries in developed countries being undermined
by industries in developing countries with inferior labor standards?
• What does globalization mean to separate countries like Australia?
Nevertheless, when considering the prospects for life on Earth, it is necessary to
proceed from the human criteria of assessing the level of environmental degrada-
tion, since over time local and regional changes in the environment become global
ones. The amplitude of these changes is determined by mechanisms that manage the
NSS dynamics and structure (Gorshkov et al. 2000, 2004; Ehlers and Kraft 2005;
Guista and Kambhampati 2006). Humankind deviates more and more from this
optimality in the way it interacts with the surrounding inert environment. At the
same time, human society as an element of the NSS tries to understand the character
of large-scale relationships with nature, directing efforts of many sciences to study
cause-and-effect feedbacks from this system. The basic item of a global human
society is the country; that is considered as an NSS component (Kondratyev and
Krapivin 2005a; Olenyev and Fedotov 2003; Wang et al. 2011).
The national safety in present-day conditions is estimated on the basis of many
criteria, mainly military, economic, ecological, and social in character. Develop-
ment of an efﬁcient method of objective analysis of the problem of national security
requires the use of the latest methods to collect and process the data on various
aspects of the functioning of the world system. Such methods are provided by
GIMS-technology (Kondratyev et al. 2002; Man et al. 2011a).
This discussion expounds ideas, methods and information technologies that can
help to solve many problems of global ecodynamics . It is clear that formal modeling
810
10
Ecoinformatics Problems in the Future World

of nature-society system with consideration of different relationship between spatial
and temporal scales does not give a desired result without the principles of sus-
tainable development. Schematically it is shown in Figs. 4.26 and 8.9.
10.2 Global Survivability Problems
10.2.1 Sustainable Development and Ecoinformatics
The present ecological situation worldwide can be exempliﬁed by growing insta-
bility, a civilization crisis, the global scale of which is expressed through deterio-
ration of humans and animals habitats. The dominant features in global ecodynamics
in the late 20th–early 21st century include the rapid growth in population (mainly in
developing countries), urban population growth at the expense of rural population
(the growing number of cities), broadening scales of dangerous diseases as HIV/
AIDS, hepatitis, tuberculosis, etc. UN data predict global population in 2050 to reach
8.9 billion people. This means that the decrease in per capita consumption (expected
as a result of the growing efﬁciency of technologies) will be cancelled out by the
impact of population growth. For instance, if meat consumption by an average
American increases by 20 % by 2050 (compared with 2000), then due to the growth
of population size in the U.S.A. the total mean consumption will increase by 5
million tons. An important general fact is that despite the prevailing growth of
population size in developing countries, their contribution to the impact on the
environment will not necessarily exceed that reached in developed countries. For
instance, U.S. population size will annually increase by about 3 million people and in
India by 16 million people, but the impact of the U.S.A. on the environment (due to
its higher per capita consumption) will be more substantial. This is illustrated, in
particular, by estimates of the growing CO2 emissions to the atmosphere: 15.7
million tC in the U.S.A., and 4.9 million tC in India.
The paradox of the contemporary situation is that despite all the unprecedented
scale discussions on sustainable development, the world is continuing an unsus-
tainable way of development. There are numerous ideas and principles to achieve
sustainable development in different regions and in whole world. But all investi-
gations in this area is restricted by solution of special problems connected with
concrete region or ecosystem. Consideration of global nature-society system is
possible with the GIMS technology application. In this case realization of global
model for the parameterization of nature-society system dynamics needs the mea-
sures of key importance including the following:
• There is a necessity to realize that further development of the consumption
society will lead to a global ecological catastrophe and the collapse of civili-
zation. The solution of this problem can only be a refusal of the traditional
paradigm of the consumption society and a radical change of life style towards
spiritual values.

• To remove the present social contrasts between ‘the south’ and ‘the north’ there
is an urgent need to help the developing countries in many ways, according to
the recommendations which have been adopted by the UN.
• Since the level of understanding of the problem of social and environmental
dynamics remains low, the support of interdisciplinary studies has particular
importance. It would be important to organize the international scientiﬁc dis-
cussions on sustainable development problems in the context of “Rio+10”,
concerning ﬁrst of all the problem of priorities and quantitative assessments of
various threats for modern civilization.
Global change priorities are aimed at assessing changes in the NSS taking place
in the past, those observed now, and possibly those in the future. A detailed realistic
analysis of the prospects of civilization development can be realized with global
model principal scheme of which is given in Figs. 1.18, 1.20 and 1.21.
The main priorities of studies of the NSS dynamics include:
• conceptual and analytical approaches to studies of interactions in the NSS;
• discovery of connections of the environment and socio-economic development
with ecological policy;
• establishing connections between environmental changes taking place now and
possible in the future;
• substantiation of the means that can be used to study these connections;
• observance of the laws of the international ecological rights in national envi-
ronmental programmes; and
• revealing gaps in scientiﬁc developments and estimates.
These basic principles should be realized by taking the following four general
requirements into account:
• Coordination
of
scientiﬁc
developments,
ecological
policy
and
their
accomplishment.
• Consideration of interaction of ecodynamics with socio-economic development.
• Examination of special features of the processes on different spatial scales.
• Reﬂection of special features of the processes on different spatial scales.
The following fact is the necessity to take into account an interaction of the key
problems of ecodynamics determined by the presence of numerous feedbacks in the
NSS and non-linearity due to which the “threshold effects” (Frankham 1995) can
occur as well as synergism of technologies and ecological policy. Numerous
illustrations of the urgency of taking into account different interactions are con-
tained in the problems of global climate change.
An adequate analysis of the role of feedbacks and NSS non-linearity is seriously
complicated by available fragmentary information. In this connection, the fact
disappoints that the conception of biotic regulation of the environment developed in
Russia, which could have served a conceptual basis for resolving the problems of
global ecodynamics, has not been recognized yet (Gorshkov et al. 1998, 2000,
2002, 2004; Krapivin and Nazaryan 1995). Unfortunately, the biotic regulation
812
10
Ecoinformatics Problems in the Future World

conception remains “unnoticed” in the West, which has been illustrated, in par-
ticular, by recent polemics with respect to the Gaya conception (Ebel et al. 2004).
The biotic regulation conception is based on the following conclusions:
• The Earth is a unique planet of the Solar system, since on this planet, life exists
in the form of biota—a totality of all living organisms, humans including.
Important properties of life include: biological stability of species and their
communities as well as a very rigid distribution of energy ﬂuxes absorbed by
biota among organisms of different sizes. Biota is responsible for the formation
of environmental properties and their stability according to biotic needs. Only
for this reason the long existence of biota on the Earth based on the principle of
biotic regulation has become possible. Maintenance of environmental stability is
one of the major goals of all living organisms.
• Like many other species, homo sapiens is one of the biotic species and therefore its
important problem consists also in maintaining the global biospheric stability.
Otherwise, sustainable development would be impossible. Very long ago, humans
left their natural ecological niche and began to consume much more biospheric
resources than it is permitted by requirements of ecological balance. After the
beginning of industrial revolution, this process of breaking the natural balance has
been accelerating under conditions of rapid growth of population size.
• Approximate estimates have shown that to provide the stable state of the bio-
sphere, one can use not more than 1 % of its resources. At present, this share is
close to 10 %. A similar situation exists with respect to the evolution of global
biogeochemical cycles of matter. So, for instance, the completeness of global
carbon cycle before the beginning of industrial revolution had been close to
0.01 % (biodiversity had played an important role in establishing the biospheric
stability). By now, the completeness has decreased to 0.1 % and a threat of
global ecological disaster becomes more and more pronounced. So the bio-
sphere should be considered not a resource but a fundamental condition for life
on Earth. At present, a major goal should be a restoration of the biosphere,
already subjected to substantial disturbing forcings, and its maintenance in a
state that would ensure the sustainable development. However a difﬁcult
problem is the presence of many insufﬁciently studied aspects of biospheric
dynamics. In this context, creation of adequate observational systems and fur-
ther improvement of numerical modelling methods play a decisive role. The ﬁrst
of these problems is especially urgent, since until now an adequate system of the
global change monitoring not only does not exist but even has not been sub-
stantiated conceptually.
• A critically important feature of the present civilization development consists in
inequality between developed and developing countries, which is manifested,
ﬁrst of all, through non-equivalent use of the existing resources. The per-capita
consumption of the “golden billion” (this term is popular in the Russian-
speaking world, referring to the relatively wealthy people in industrially
developed nations, or the West) is incomparably higher than for the rest of the
world. Therefore it is necessary to achieve an agreement on a new social order
10.2
Global Survivability Problems
813

based on the agreement on cooperation and partnership. An accomplishment of
adequate systems of life support is only possible on the basis of respective
international agreements.
• It becomes more and more clear that the present system of market economy does
not provide the transition from the unstable to stable trajectory of development.
The respective effort undertaken in the spheres such as education, legislation,
and management cannot be considered sufﬁcient. Non-governmental and reli-
gious organizations can play a more constructive role.
• To stimulate the transition to sustainable development, a complex accom-
plishment of a series of measures is needed based on understanding the present
situation complexity.
– It is extremely important to realize the fact that further development of the
consumption society will lead to a global ecological disaster and civilization
collapse. The only resolution of the problem consists in rejection of the
traditional paradigm of the consumption society and in radical change of the
way of life based on admission of priorities of spiritual values.
– To overcome the North–South social contrasts, immediate measures are
needed on rendering help to developing countries based on realization of the
UN recommendations.
It is the biotic regulation conception that should serve the basis for the ﬁrst
priority of the UNEP Programme (UNEP 2006), which is deﬁned as an interaction
between man and the environment the conceptual approach to analysis of inter-
actions. This problem can be resolved with the use of the UNEP DPIR (Drivers,
Pressures, Impact, Response) model, which describes the cause-and-effect con-
nections between ecological and socio-economic NSS components.
Concrete directions of the ecological development include:
• Natural and anthropogenic environmental changes.
In this context, of key importance is a system classiﬁcation and priorities of
interaction between natural and anthropogenic changes of the environment. It
should be emphasized that this unresolved problem is among the major reasons
of the extremely contradictory character of the existing conclusions with respect
to the nature of the present global climate change. The UNEP document has
justly emphasized the priority of the problems of biogeochemical interactions
and cycles. Even in the case of carbon cycle we are still far from an adequate
understanding of the most substantial mechanisms of its formation.
• Ecological factors and humans’ well-being.
Both positive and negative ecological factors demand attention. Positive factors
include ecosystems that perform functions of life support (water, food, recre-
ations, and many others). Various factors of ecological stress (diseases, agri-
cultural pests, natural disasters, etc.) are negative.
• Anthropogenic impacts on the environment.
In this connection of special interest is an analysis of demographic dynamics
and conditions of socio-economic development.
814
10
Ecoinformatics Problems in the Future World

• Ecological policy and its connections with ecodynamics.
In particular, bearing in mind the use of technologies, institutional measures and
risk control. Quite separate are the problems of interaction of science and
ecological policy. As for the concrete factors of ecodynamics, the UNEP Pro-
gramme (2004, 2006) has justly emphasized the ﬁrst priority of analysis and
assessment of the role of interaction between problems such as biodiversity,
climate change, degradation of soils fertility, fresh water, coastal and marine
environment, local and regional air quality, ozone layer depletion, persistent
organic pollutants (POPs), and heavy metals.
Questions to be answered are as follows:
• What are the key interactions between various environmental changes and what
factors determine them?
• How are interactions between various anthropogenic impacts realized and how
can they be “separated” if needed?
• How do interactions between products provided by ecosystems and ecosystems’
functioning manifest themselves?
• What are present interactions between impacts and responses to them and how
can they be either re-grouped or removed in case of necessity to change inter-
actions in the NSS?
As for the goals of the socio-economic development mainly during the period up
to 2015 (compared to 1999 conditions), the main problems include (Dodds and
Pippard 2005):
• Liquidation of extreme poverty and starvation (halving the number of people
with the income less than 1 $/day).
• Realization of universal elementary education.
• Provision of sexual equality and raising the role of women.
• Reduction of infant mortality (children below 5 years) by 2/3 by the year 2015.
• Improvement of mothers’ health (reduction of mortality in childbirth by 3/4).
• Struggle against HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases.
• Provision of ecodynamics stability (liquidation of decreasing trends of the
environmental quality, halving the number of people without access to good-
quality drinking water, improvement of living conditions for, at least, 100
million people living in slums).
• Development of cooperation in the interests of socio-economic development
(with emphasis on the problem of the developing countries’ debt).
Serious efforts to substantiate the priorities of the environmental studies in the
21st century have been undertaken by the NOAA scientists who developed the
Strategic Plan (SP) for the period 2003–2007 and later (NOAA 2003, 2012;
Lautenbacher 2005). Speciﬁc attention is given to the NOAA’s life-saving
information about hurricanes and other severe storms, as well as the data to monitor
the Earth. The SP determines the priority of the four directions of developments for
the NOAA:
10.2
Global Survivability Problems
815

1. Protection, reconstruction and control of the use of coastal and ocean resources
based on understanding the laws of ecosystems’ dynamics.
2. Understanding the laws of climate change in order to increase the ability of the
society to respond to them (note that the document uses two synonymic notions:
variability and change with respect to climate without their clear deﬁnition).
3. Provision of information on climate and water resources.
4. Maintenance of national commercial interests by provision of ecologically
reliable information to ensure safe and efﬁcient transportation. Of course, safe
and efﬁcient systems of transportation are one of the key components of
economy. This concerns all kinds of transportation: land, sea, and air.
Six directions of developments are considered most substantial:
(1) Creation of the system of integral (complex) observations of the global
environment, processing and analysis of observational data.
(2) Efﬁcient resolution of the problem of propagation of knowledge about the
environment.
(3) Accomplishment of the needed scientiﬁc studies.
(4) Provision of an efﬁcient scientiﬁc cooperation.
(5) Resolution of national security problems.
(6) An adequate resolution of the organizational problems.
The NOAA strategic plan foresees an achievement of the following strategic
goals for the ﬁrst of the four directions of developments mentioned above:
• Increasing the number of coastal and marine ecosystems is not subjected to
unfavourable changes and being in a stable condition.
• Raising the socio-economic importance of the marine environment and
respective resources (sea food, recreations, tourism, etc.).
• Improving the living conditions for coastal and marine ﬂora and fauna.
• Increasing the number of species protected from unfavourable impacts.
• Increase the number of cultivated species up to an optimal level.
• Improving the environmental quality in the coastal and marine regions.
An achievement of the enumerated goals should be based on the use of the
ecosystem approach, and in this connection, on extending the scale of studies of
various ecosystems dynamics within the framework of three strategic directions:
(a) Protection, reconstruction, and control of the use of resources of coastal and
marine regions as well as Great Lakes.
(b) Reconstruction of species and their habitats to be protected.
(c) Expansion and maintenance of stable ﬁshery.
To achieve the goals of the NOAA SP, of key importance is to create a complex
system of the environmental monitoring which would provide the obtaining, pro-
cessing, and analysis of the data on the ocean-atmosphere-land interactive system
from local to global scales.
816

Ecoinformatics Problems in the Future World

Assessing the NOAA SP on the whole, one should state that unfortunately it is
too strongly directed towards meeting national interests. Even in this context it is
impossible to adequately resolve the problems of ecodynamics without taking into
account the interactivity of processes of local, regional and global scales. The
section of the plan concerning climate problems causes a serious bewilderment.
With an extreme urgency of these problems (mainly due to their strongly politicized
character), of extreme importance is concrete understanding of limited means of
numerical modeling and systems of climate observations as well as planning of
efforts to overcome this limitedness.
Without dwelling upon concrete characteristic of the present global ecody-
namics, we only emphasize: the absence of long-term perspectives of development
of the modern consumption society illustrated by estimates of global ecodynamics
raises no doubts. Therefore at the World Summit on Sustainable Development held
in Johannesburg in 2002, the necessity was emphasized to accomplish 10 year
programmes on reaching a stable production and consumption including the fol-
lowing recommendations (Southerton et al. 2004):
• Assuming by developed countries of the leading role in provision of stable
production and consumption.
• Achieving these goals based on the general but differentiated responsibility.
• Imparting the key role to the problem of stable production and consumption.
• Laying emphasis on participation of young generation in resolution of the
problems of sustainable development.
• Use of the “polluter pays” principle.
• Control of the cycle of products evolution from their production to consumption
and waste to increase the productive efﬁciency.
• Backing the policy that favours both the output of ecologically acceptable
products and ecologically adequate services.
• Development of more ecological and efﬁcient methods of energy supply. An
exception of energy subsidies.
• Support of free-will initiatives of industry in order to raise its social and eco-
logical responsibility.
• Study and application of ecologically pure production especially in developing
countries as well as in small and medium business.
Though the enumerated recommendations are rather declarative, still they dem-
onstrate a necessity to change the paradigm of the socio-economic development (ﬁrst
of all, this refers to developed countries) from the consumption society to priorities of
social and spiritual values. A concrete analysis of the ways of this development
requires a participation of many specialists in the ﬁeld of social sciences.
As has been mentioned above, the main aspect of global ecodynamics (in the
context of biotic regulation of the environment) is the state of ecosystems on
the planet. The development and realization of an efﬁcient technology to assess the
ecological safety on global scales may be possible with the organization of the
International Centre on the Global Geoinformation Monitoring (ICGGM). This will
make it possible to realize the mechanisms for the NSS coevolution. The basic
10.2
Global Survivability Problems
817

mechanism of this combination will be new technologies of data processing based
on the progress of the evolutionary informatics and global modeling. Here the point
is about a realization of an approach developed by some authors (Bukatova et al.
1991; Krapivin and Varotsos 2007, 2008; Nitu et al. 2013c; Elinson 1983) to
modeling the processes in conditions of inadequate a-priori information about their
parameters and the presence of principally unavoidable information gaps.
The ICGGM performs the following functions:
• Data collection from national monitoring systems and international centers on
environmental studies.
• Sorting, primary processing and accumulation of data on natural processes.
• Formation of knowledge bases for the processes in the environment.
• Simulation, mathematical and physical modelling of climatic, biospheric, cos-
mic, social and economic processes.
• Prediction of the environmental state and formation of a constantly renewed
bank of scenarios of the anthropogenic activity.
• Answering inquiries from national and international agencies on protection of
the environment.
• Substantiation of recommendations for national and international centres of the
environmental monitoring.
Indicators characterizing the GIMS as the base subsystem of ICGGM are
grouped by thematic principles of organization of its structure. They are speciﬁed in
the process of GIMS exploitation and cover the key characteristics of the global
topography, synoptic situation in the energy-active zones, content of dangerous
atmospheric pollutants in characteristic latitudinal belts, as well as announcements
about catastrophes.
A multitude of spatially irregular and fragmentary in time data of measurements
of geographic, geochemical, ecological, biogeocenotic and synoptic characteristics
serve as input parameters for the GIMS. Both in situ and remote sensing mea-
surements are made in different wavelength regions and with different accuracies.
Measurements agree with other GIMS units through algorithmic procedures of
primary data processing. The volume of these data will decrease in the process of
GIMS functioning. The GIMS input foresees also a possibility to receive signals
from scenarios of the anthropogenic development of situations under study.
The GIMS model is demonstrated as a conceptual scheme in Fig.1.1. Rela-
tionships between input and output parameters are taken into account through a
composition of information ﬂuxes indicated here. The GIMS functions in the
adaptive regime, and the ﬁnal result of the system affects the input characteristics of
its measuring section. The mathematical aspects of GIMS are shown in Fig. 1.22.
Here all the biogeochemical and biogeocoenotic processes are described by the
systems of balance equations. However, a considerable part of the different-to-
parameterize processes is described using the method of the evolutionary modelling
oriented towards a parameterization without formulas of very non-stationary pro-
cesses. The GIMS functioning is presented in Figs. 1.5 and 1.7.

The global-scale socio-economic structure can be divided into m levels.
According to Kondratyev (1998b), m ≥9, and this structure has three main levels of
the development of the regions: developed, developing and low-developed. A
realization of the ICGGM project will accelerate the process of alignment of this
structure, since the planning of the organizational structure of the human society
will be accelerated, with the provision of the purposefulness of global processes for
the beneﬁt of humankind and without damage to nature and, which is most
important, international mechanisms will be developed for the coordinated nature
use by the population of the Earth. The ICGGM will be useful because people will
not waste ﬁnances on realization of ecologically unacceptable projects and will
preserve the balance with nature. With the scientiﬁc-technical progress, this proﬁt
will grow, since the transition to new kinds of resources is unavoidable (Gorshkov
et al. 2004).
10.2.2 Sustainable Development Model
The biosphere is a complex unique system. Historically, the man was considered as
an element of the biosphere. But at the present time the problem of co-evolution
between the human society (H) and nature (N) has arisen. The inﬂuence of human
activity on natural systems has reached the global scale, but it is possible to make
the conditional division between anthropogenic and natural processes. The use of
system analysis permits a more formal description of this division to be performed.
Commonly, there are two interacting systems: H with the technologies, sciences,
economics, sociology, agriculture, industry, etc.; and N with climatic, biogeoce-
notic, biogeochemical, hydrological, geophysical and other natural processes that
are characterized by numerous direct couplings and feedbacks.
The solution of practical problems in investigating complex systems often
involves evaluating their effectiveness and in particular their stability under inde-
terminate conditions of functioning. The theory of potential effectiveness of com-
plex systems deals with the solution of these problems. A constructive
mathematical apparatus has been developed within the framework of this theory by
which it is possible to solve different problems of optimizing the structure and
behavior of the functioning of H and N in certain situations.
The systems H and N are determined by their structures (number of elements and
relations among them) and behaviour (responses to stimuli). The internal behavior
of such a system is aimed at maintaining its uninterrupted functioning. The external
behavior of the system is aimed at achieving a certain outside goal. Temporal
stability of a complex system is a necessary property without which all its other
properties become meaningless. It is connected with the structural stability of the
material composition and energy balance of the complex system as well as with the
regularity of its responses to the same external stimuli.
10.2
Global Survivability Problems
819

A breach in stability of a system may result from internal causes (the aging of its
elements) or external causes associated with the unfavorable inﬂuence of the envi-
ronment (an ill-intentioned enemy, in particular). Survivability of biological systems
is determined by environmental conditions where man’s interference with nature is
one of the important factors. In connection with this and the prospects of constructing
artiﬁcial biological systems, optimization problems also arise; an increase of pro-
ductivity of a biological system being the main criterion of optimality.
For the global scale the problem of survivability of the interacting systems is
complicated at the expense of the hierarchy of interaction levels. For a complete
explanation of H and N systems their openness has to be taken into account. Com-
monly, let us consider the interaction of two open complex systems H and N, deﬁned
by their goals HG and NG, structures HS and NS and behavior HB and NB, respectively.
It is suggested that the functioning of such systems should be described by equations
of (V, W)-exchange. Namely, the interaction of an open system with the environment
(or other system) is represented as a process whereby the system exchanges a certain
quantity V of resources spent in exchange for a certain quantity W of resources
consumed. The aim of the systems is the most advantageous (V, W)-exchange, i.e. it
tries to get maximum W in exchange for minimum V. The V is a complex function of
the structure and behavior of both systems:
V ¼ V W; HS; NS; HG; NG
ð
Þ ¼ V W; H; N
ð
Þ
ð10:1Þ
As a result of their interaction the systems H and N get the following (V, W)-
exchanges:
VH;max ¼ VH;max WH; H; N
ð
Þ ¼ max
HB;HS
f

NB;NS

ð
Þ ¼ max
NB;NS

g min
HB;HS
f
g VNðWN; H; NÞ
ð10:2Þ
where H* and N* are the optimal systems H and N respectively.
From (10.1) and (10.2) one can see that the value of (V, W)-exchange depends
on the goal of the system and may vary within certain limits: V1,min ≤VH ≤V1,max,
V2,min ≤VN ≤V2,max, where Vi,min (i = 1, 2) corresponds to the case, when both
systems are most aggressive, and Vi,max (i = 1, 2) to the case, when they are most
cautious. In brief, there is some spectrum of the interactions between H and N. For a
formal description of these interactions we shall divide all the elements of both
systems into three classes: the working (working), protective (defensive) and active
elements, the latter designed to act on the environment. For short, we shall refer to
the working elements of systems H and N as a-and b-elements, to the protective
elements as Ra-and Rb-elements and to the active elements as Ca-and Cb-elements,
respectively.
820
10
Ecoinformatics Problems in the Future World

Let us assume that before interaction the systems H and N have certain limited
energy resources (vital “substrates”) Va and Vb, where Va = {Vaj, j = 1, …, ma},
Vb = {Vbi, i = 1, …, mb}. These substrates generate working elements in such a way,
that the substrate Vaj (Vbi) can generate Hj (Ni) a(b)-elements of the j(i)-th type of
values aj(bi).
The protective and active elements of each system are generated by the working
elements. First of all the protective Ea

Ecoinformatics Problems in the Future World

The stochastic solution of Eqs. (10.1)–(10.13) can be in the unrealized form in
practice. There are many real situations when the realization of H*or N* system is
impossible. Some tasks and algorithms were described by Krapivin and Klimov
(1995, 1997).
10.2.3 Study of the Simple Survivability Model
Let us consider the interaction of the two systems in the frame of diagram shown in
Fig. 10.1. At the beginning, the systems H and N have, respectively, Na(0) and
Nb(0) working elements, NRa(0) and NRb(0) protective elements, and Ma(0) and
Mb(0) active agents for undertaking action against an external medium. In this case,
we shall assume that the initial structures HS and NS of the systems are uniformly
ﬁlled with elements. This means that at the time t = 0 in any sphere with a ﬁxed
radius ε, which is completely conﬁned within system H, there are constant numbers
of elements.
Speciﬁc characteristics of all elements can be depending on the solved task. For
example, Ca and Cb element can be anthropogenic scenarios and diseases,
respectively. Feedbacks and medicine can be as Rb and Ra elements, respectively.
Elements a and b represent life conditions for people and hierarchy of ecological
systems, respectively. Certainly, detailed interpretation of all types of accomplished
elements depend on the spatial-temporal scale and knowledge base.

problem. Structure of system elements may be changed and added
10.2

We shall consider that all elements of systems H and N, independently of their
spatial location, are accessible to the same degree to the active agents of the external
medium. The interaction of the systems consists in the situation that each system in
a ﬁxed interval of time [0, T] at discrete moments ti = ih, i = 0,1,2,…, k (k = [T/h]),
determines its behavior by a set of numbers:
HB ¼ fmb ti
ð Þ; mRb ti
ð Þ; qig; NB ¼ ma ti
ð Þ; mRa ti
ð Þ; ri
f
g:
Here, ma and mb are parts of Cb- and Ca-elements aimed at destroying a-and b-
elements, respectively; analogously, the parts (1 −ri)mRa and (1 −ρi)mRb of Cb-
and Ca-elements are directed towards the destruction of the corresponding pro-
tective elements. In the course of time portions of Ca- and Cb-elements uniformly
ﬁll the opposite system, and in such a manner the elements of the systems become
with time uniformly depleted.
It is assumed that system H(N) is put out of operation, if at the time ti ≤T,
Na(ti) ≤θaNa(0) (Nb(ti) ≤θbNb(0)); that is, if more than (1 −θa)-th ((1 −θb)-th)
portion of the initial amount of its working elements is out of operation, where
0 ≤θa, θb ≤1. On the other hand, when Na(T) > θaNa(0) (Nb(T) > θbNb(0)), then
system H(N) is considered to have been survived. The assignment of the values θa
and θb is determined by the peculiarities of the system under consideration. It is
clear that the smaller the number θ, the more survivable is the system.
Further, we shall assume that one of the elements of system H or N is put of
operation by the action of one of the elements Ca or Cb with a probability p1[NRa(t)]
or p2[NRb(t)], respectively. Consequently in the interval of time [ti, ti + h] with step
length h there occur on the average the following changes in the structure of the
system:

ð10:14Þ
The above-discussed interaction scheme of the two systems can be readily
implemented with the aid of game-theory methods. Indeed, from Eq. (10.14) it
follows that in the interval of time [0, T] (T = kh, here, one can take h = 1) both
systems lose working a-and b-elements in the following amounts:

In this case, system H with its behavior of
HB tð Þ ¼ fmb tð Þ; mRb tð Þ; q tð Þg
tends to minimize the function Q1, which characterizes its losses, and to maximize Q2,
the losses of system N. On the other hand, the system N with its behavior NB tð Þ ¼
ma tð Þ; mRa tð Þ; r tð Þ
f
g tends to maximize function Q1 and minimize function Q2.
In practical problems, the win function is taken as such a characteristic of the
antagonistic situation which most fully describes a given conﬂict. In this case, such
a function is Q ¼ Q1  Q2. The maximizing participant in this case will be system
N, the minimizing opponent, system H. In this manner the solution of the set
problem on the optimal behavior of the two systems in an antagonistic situation
becomes reduced to the solution of a game with a win function:

ð10:18Þ
Thus we have a k-step survival game. At the start of each step, system H pro-
vides a certain amount of its resources u = {mb, mRb, ρ} and N provides a certain
amount of its resources v = {ma, mRa, r}, so that limitations (10.18) are maintained.
As a result of this distribution of resources, system N gets the advantage:

ð10:19Þ
However, this win of N and the loses of H are not counted on the basis of their
initial resources and cannot be added to the remaining amounts of C-elements. After
each step of the game Eq. (10.14), the change in the resources in the participants
10.2

takes place, and as a result of the k-step process a total win of system N can be
described by the equation:

There are several methods with the aid of which an analysis can be made of this
k-step process. One can consider this k-step game as a one-step game, in which case
system H must select simultaneously a plurality of the vector {u0, u1,…,uk-1}, and
system N, a plurality of the vector {v0, v1,…,vk-1}, where the selection of uk and vk
depends on the previous values obtained according to Eq. (10.14).
For a solution of this quite complex problem, it is suggested to substitute for it a
similar problem of multi-step optimization. The values of this game can be
expressed as:
Vk ¼ max

QkdFðv0; v1; . . .; vk1ÞdGðu0; u1; . . .; uk1Þg ¼ min

The solution of these functional equations is a difﬁcult problem. Therefore, not
without reason the expression curse of dimensionality was introduced. Next we
shall present the solution of some speciﬁc cases. This task is solved in more detail
by Nitu et al. (2000a). For the solution of the proposed problem, we shall begin
with the case where in both systems the C- and R-elements are indistinguishable.
The diagram of interaction between systems H and N can then be represented in
such a form as shown in Fig. 10.2. By taking into account the designations used in
this diagram, we obtain that the number of Ca-and Cb-elements that have reached
the Cb-and Ca-elements of the opposite system in a one-step operation will be
respectively: max{0, aC-NRb} and max{0, bC-NRa}. Therefore, the numbers of Ca-
and Cb-elements that are put out of operation on the average are max{0, bC-NRa}
p1[NRa] and max{0, aC-NRb}p2[NRb]. Consequently, after one step of the game the
following numbers of Ca-and Cb- elements remain in the system that are not
put out of operation: max[0, Ma-max(0, bC-NRa)p1[NRa]]p1[NRa], max[0, Mb-max
(0, aC-NRb)p2[NRb]]p2[NRb]. Going over to the multi-step situation, we introduce the
win function (2.16). The aim of system N is to destroy system H, or more precisely,
to put out of operation all of the latter’s a-elements. For this purpose the system
N cannot use all Cb-elements, since it will then be left defenseless against the Ca-
elements. An analogous situation holds true for the system H. Each system is
compelled to release after each successive step of the game a certain number of
working a-and b-elements. The magnitude of this payoff is proportional to the
difference Mb −bC −NRb −(Ma −aC −NRa). Now the problems on both sides
become clear. The system N must strive to provide such a number of Cb-elements in
all directions so as to maintain the maximum value of this difference. In other

words, it must provide the largest possible number of elements ma for the
destruction of a- elements and thus increase its winnings. However, one could also
consider the presence of an analogous distribution of Ca- elements and provide
sufﬁcient protection for the system N through the maximum distribution of Ca-
elements. An analogous situation exists for the system H. For (n −1) moves left

It is obvious that at this step of the game the participants have no pure strategies.
Therefore the solution of this game is impossible in an analytic form, and it can be
obtained in a concrete case only by the numerical method. The modelling of the
game provides some understanding of the nature of its solution. Indeed with the aid
of a computer it is possible either to construct a model of the game and to gather
statistics or to solve the functional Eq. (10.23) numerically and with the aid of
heuristic concepts to investigate the dependence of strategies on the initial condi-
tions. Of course, such an approach for a short interval of modeling cannot give any
signiﬁcant information concerning the solution. Nevertheless, this is the only
possible approach at the present time. The feeling of hopelessness in a speciﬁc
situation should not deter us from seeking a solution by analytical methods. The
importance of obtaining analytical solutions is obvious, since they have the
advantage over the numerical solutions in that they make possible the detection of
the general regularities of the optimal behavior of complex systems in antagonistic
situations. The importance of the analytical solutions has been pointed out by
Krapivin (1978), who has shown that a single numerical solution cannot replace an
analytical solution in which the quantitative description of the phenomenon is most
concentrated. In the case examined here, when the participants have no information
concerning the action of the opponent in the process of the entire game, the solution
of particular cases with the aid of a computer enables us to obtain the following
quantitative description of optimal strategies.
Let Mb n
ð Þ=Ma n
ð Þ ¼ dn. Then if dn  1, system N in the initial stage of the
game has a pure strategy, but for system H it is more advantageous to adopt a mixed
strategy, using the tactics of deception. During the ﬁrst steps system N destroys only
Ca- elements and only during the last steps does it destroy the a-elements. By using
the corresponding probability mechanism, system H must direct all its Ca-elements,
with probability p1 towards the destruction of the Cb-elements, with probability p2
towards the defense of its own elements, and with probability 1 −p1 −p2 towards
the attack of the b-elements. In the case when δn ≅1, then at this stage of the game
p1 + p2 = 1, mb(n) = 0, and the behavior of the system becomes symmetrical.
During the last steps of the game systems H and N, independent of the magnitude of
δn, change over to the strategies: ma(t) ≠0, mb(t) ≠0, and bC = aC = NRa = NRb = 0,
that is, to the destruction of working elements.
Let us consider a particular case where the systems have no protective elements,
that is, NRa = NRb = 0, and therefore, p1 = p2 = 1. Then we obtain:

The solution of the game with the win function (10.33) has the following form:
V2 ¼ 2Mbð2Þ  2Mað2Þ; b
Cð2Þ ¼ Mað2Þ; a
Cð2Þ ¼ Mbð2Þ
ð10:34Þ
Actually, if an account is made of the real situation, the optimal strategies of
both systems two steps before the end of the game will be as follows:
a
Cð2Þ ¼ minfMað2Þ; Mbð2Þg; b
Cð2Þ ¼ minfMað2Þ; Mbð2Þ
ð10:35Þ
Therefore at the penultimate step when δ2 > 1, the system N releases a portion of
its force and the system H releases all its forces against the c-elements of the other
system.
By reasoning in an analogous way, we obtain that n-steps before the end of the
game the strategies of the systems H and N will be:
a
CðnÞ ¼ min MaðnÞ; MbðnÞ
f
g; b
CðnÞ ¼ min MaðnÞ; MbðnÞ

ð10:36Þ
It is evident that if in the process of the game no replacement of C-elements
takes place in the systems H and N, then it follows from Eqs. (10.35) and (10.36)
that it makes sense to conduct the game in two steps; and the two following cases
are distinguishable:
(1) When Ma(0) = Mb(0), both systems release all their C-elements into battle
against the C-elements of the other system, but in so doing the system
themselves survive.
(2) When Ma(0) > Mb(0), system N releases all the elements into battle against
Ca-elements, and system H releases Mb(0) of Ca-elements into battle against
Cb-elements, and Ma(0) −Mb(0) of Ca-elements into battle against b-elements.

The solution of the game of the two systems, H and N, with the win function as
shown in Eq. (10.16) and under conditions as expressed in Eqs. (10.37) and (10.38),
is reduced to the problem of maximizing two functions:

From Eqs. (10.39) and (10.40) it is evident that when p1[NRa(n)] =
p2[NRb(n)] = 1, the optimal strategies of both sides consist in the destruction of a-
and b-elements. If the C-elements act independently of one another, and the
probability of putting the C-elements out of operation by a single R-element is equal
to a constant value Da and Db for H and N systems, respectively, then

in the H and N system, respectively.
When k = 1, the optimal strategies of the behavior of the systems will be

no sense to destroy protective elements. When k = 2, from Eqs. (10.37)–(10.40) we
obtain the optimal strategies in the form:

From Eq. (10.43) it is evident that for the system N to destroy the system H it is
necessary that the following inequality holds:
daMb 0

Mað0Þ  d1

f

ð10:46Þ
Thus for the system N to destroy the system H it is necessary that the inequality
(10.45) holds. In an analogous way, for the system H it is necessary that the
inequality (10.46) holds. The number of a-and b-elements, as a rule, is a ﬁxed
number, as follows from considerations related to the work of the system. The
number of R—elements, which perform protective functions, can be best selected
when certain physical parameters in the problem are ﬁxed and when a priori
information concerning the amount of C-elements of the opposite system is
available. For example, if the effectiveness of all R-elements is constant indepen-
dent of their number, then in order for the system H to survive, the necessary
number of protective elements must satisfy the inequality:
Nra 0
ð Þ  daMb 0
ð Þln=fdað1 þ ln½dað1  haÞNa 0
ð ÞÞg
ð10:47Þ
It appears clear that when the number of Cb-elements is constant and the sur-
vivability of the system H decreases, the necessary number of protective elements
increases rapidly. In this case, the greater their effectiveness, the smaller the number
of protective elements is required for carrying out one and the same task. With an
increase in survivability the necessary number of protective elements can be
decreased.
832

Ecoinformatics Problems in the Future World

Now let the systems H and N have a ﬁxed amount Ea and Eb of a certain
substratum (for instance, energy) and be able to distribute it evenly between their
protective elements, so that for each fraction of Ra-and Rb-elements there is
E1a = Ea/Nra(0) and E1b = Eb/Nrb(0) respectively. Then the efﬁciency coefﬁcients of
the protective elements must increase with the increase in the E1a and E1b portions,
since in this case the probabilities of Da and Db increase. Therefore let Da ¼

, Da ¼ 1  exp FbFb

, where, Fa, Fb, α and β are indepen-
dent of the number of protective elements. This gives then the following expres-
sions for the coefﬁcients of effectiveness of the protective elements:(10.48)

1b ¼ GbNb
Rb ð0Þ;
ð10:48Þ
where, Ga ¼ haFaEa
a; Gb ¼ hbFbEb
b. From Eqs. (10.47) and (10.48) we obtain the
following transcendental equations for the amount of the necessary protective
elements in systems H and N:
NRað0Þ ¼ Na

An analysis of Eqs. (10.49) and (10.50) reveals that in this case the number
Nra(0) is very sensitive with respect to changes in the quantity ln[(1 −θa)Na(0)].
And this is natural, since with the increase in the number of Ra-elements their
effectiveness sharply decreases. It is clear that there exists a certain optimal level for
the number of protective elements. This level is deﬁned by the assigned surviv-
ability of the system. It is better to have a small number of Ra-elements of high
effectiveness, than a large number of Ra-elements of low effectiveness. When k = 3,

being independent of the distribution of Ca-elements during the last two steps. In
this case Q
1ð3Þ ¼ Q
1ð2Þ. An analogous result is also obtained for system N.
Thus for an identical game, for instance, system N can destroy at the most
Q
1ð2Þ ¼ Mbð0Þ exp½daNRað0Þ of a-elements; when the number of steps is greater
than 2, system N can destroy not more than Q
1ð2Þ ¼ ðedaÞ1 exp½daQ
1ð1Þ of a-
elements. Therefore by comparing Q
1ð1Þ with Q
1ð2Þ we obtain that in the analyzed
antagonistic situation the best strategy for both systems is the performance of all
allowable operations in two steps. And that is, during the ﬁrst step the action of a
portion of each system’s C-elements is to be set against the protective elements of
the opposite system, and during the second step the action of the remaining force is
to be set against the working elements of the opposite system. This conclusion
completely agrees with the conclusions reached by Krapivin (1978), which were
obtained by different methods.
In the above-examined models of the interaction of the two systems, it was
assumed that the effectiveness of the protective elements does not change with
respect to time. However, this assumption in many real situations must be with-
drawn. Let us consider a case where both systems can vary the effectiveness of the
protective elements from step to step, so that at each step the effectiveness is
independent of the number of protective elements. Let the effectiveness of Ra-and
Rb-elements be equal to d1a and d1b respectively during the ﬁrst step in the two-step
case. Similarly, during the second step the effectiveness acquires values d2a and d2b
so that d1a + d2a = 2da, d1b + d2b = 2db; that is, the summed value of the
effectiveness does not exceed a constant value. As a result, we obtain the following
matrix game:
d1a ¼ d2a d1a\d2a d1a [ d2a

The matrix of this game has a saddle-shaped point in the case of following
conditions: Ma(0) ≤NRb(0)exp[dbNRb(0)], Mb(0) ≤NRa(0)exp[daNRa(0)] and that it
takes place in the real system.
Thus for both systems it is advantageous during the ﬁrst step to provide the
protective elements with a small effectiveness and to increase their effectiveness
during the second step. This is natural, since it is better to lose a greater number of
protective elements during the ﬁrst step, thus securing a reliable defense of the
working elements during the second step of the game.
From Eq. (10.53) it follows that the loses of a-and b-elements by system H and
N, respectively will amount to:

10.3 Concluding Remarks About Global Humanity
Problems
The level of the anthropogenic impacts on the natural ecosystems has achieved
global scale. The main problem of the present humanity is the sustainable devel-
opment. The sustainable development refers to a mode of human development in
which resource use aims to meet human needs, while preserving the environment so
that these needs can be met not only in the present, but also for forthcoming
generations. The sustainable development ties together concerns for the carrying
capacity of natural systems with the social challenges faced by humanity. The
concept of the sustainable development has in the past most often been broken out
into three components: the environmental sustainability, the economic sustain-
ability and the sociopolitical sustainability. More recently, it has been suggested
that a more consistent analytical breakdown is to distinguish four domains, notably:
the economic, the ecological, the political and the cultural sustainability. Unfor-
tunately, solidarity does not exist between scientists who are studying the global
environmental processes and other experts from economics, politics and other
humanities. Nevertheless, the solution of global problems arising in the nature-
society system evolution is possible only with the use of global ecoinformatics
methods some of which were discussed in this book.
Undoubtedly, the global environmental problems derive from global environ-
mental causes and effects. All the human causes of the global environmental change
happen through a subset of proximate causes, which directly alter aspects of the
environment in ways that have global effects. Main attention of most people is
focused on the major economic problems. But the sustainable problems entail the
more complex idea of humanity development. Fundamental attention should be
paid to the nature evolution of which the principal aspect is the survivability of
human civilization. A variety of existing point of views complicates search of stable
strategies in the nature-society system management. Much has been written on this
subject and a large number of scenarios have been worked out. But, the present
trend of the interactions between human society and the environment remains
mainly hopeless.
It is evident that the perspective evolution of the nature-society system depends
on the coordinated strategies of practically all countries and the availability of the
effective technology for global modeling and monitoring. Essential aspect is the
proper deﬁnition of the sustainable development category. Chapin et al. (2004),
Kobayashi (2005) and Wijen et al. (2005), Krapivin et al. (2009c) consider four
categories of sustainability that refer to:
• Nature: (1) biodiversity, (2) global warming, (3) cycle of resources, (4) water,
soil, and air, (5) ecological formation.
• Economy: (1) energy, (2) resources productivity, (3) food, (4) ﬁnancial status,
(5) international cooperation.
836
10
Ecoinformatics Problems in the Future World

• Society: (1) security, (2) mobility, (3) sex characteristics, (4) traditions and
culture, (5) ﬁnancial ﬂuxes.
• Wellbeing: (1) satisfaction with life, (2) science and education, (3) participation
in social life, (4) health, (5) differences in life standards.
Consideration of these categories and search of optimal coordination between
them can be the responsibility of international institutes in the frame of the Orga-
nization of United Nations. It is evident that these categories have sub-levels with
the following more detailed structure:
• Climate change. The climate is changing. Many authors have agreed that cli-
mate change may be one of the greatest threats facing the planet. In this regard,
the recent data show that temperature increases in various regions, and/or
enhanced extremes in weather patterns. Research has shown that air pollutants
from both anthropogenic and natural sources make clouds to reﬂect more of the
sun’s rays back into space. This leads to an effect known as global dimming
whereby less heat and energy reaches the Earth. Therefore, solution of the
sustainable development problems depends mainly on the precision of fore-
casting climate trend.
• Conservation. Natural resource conservation problems comprise a wide spec-
trum of administrative, scientiﬁc, social, political and educational aspects the
solution of which is possible with global ecoinformatics.
• Energy. Energy is one of main elements of sustainable development. The Earth
receives 174 petawatts of incoming solar radiation at the upper atmosphere.
Approximately 30 % is reﬂected back to space, while the rest is absorbed by
clouds, oceans and land masses. Other energy sources have terrestrial origin:
coal, oil, gas, atomic and wind energy.
• Environmental degradation. Environmental degradation is a process through
which the natural environment is compromised in some way, reducing biolog-
ical diversity and the general health of the environment. This process can be
entirely natural in origin, or it can be accelerated or caused by human activities.
• Environmental health. The environmental health and safety guidelines contain
the performance levels and measures that are normally acceptable to Interna-
tional Finance Corporation and that are generally considered to be achievable in
new facilities at reasonable costs by existing technology.
• Electromagnetic ﬁelds. An electromagnetic ﬁeld is a physical ﬁeld produced by
electrically charged objects. It affects the behavior of charged objects in the
vicinity of the ﬁeld. The electromagnetic ﬁeld extends indeﬁnitely throughout
space and describes the electromagnetic interaction. It is one of the four fun-
damental forces of nature (the others are gravitation, the weak interaction, and
the strong interaction).
• Genetic engineering. Genetic engineering is the direct manipulation of an
organism’s genome using biotechnology. Genetic engineering techniques have
been applied in numerous ﬁelds including research, agriculture, industrial bio-
technology, and medicine.
10.3
Concluding Remarks About Global Humanity Problems
837

• Intensive farming. Intensive farming or intensive agriculture is an agricultural
production system characterized by a low fallow ratio and the high use of inputs
such as capital, labour, or heavy use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers rel-
ative to land area. This is in contrast to many sorts of traditional agriculture in
which the inputs per unit land are lower.
• Land degradation. Land degradation is a process in which the value of the
biophysical environment is affected by one or more combinations of human-
induced processes acting upon the land. Also environmental degradation is the
gradual destruction or reduction of the quality and quantity of human activities
or natural means example water causes soil erosion, wind, etc.
• Soil. Soil is a natural body consisting of layers that are primarily composed of
minerals which differ from their parent materials in their texture, structure,
consistency, color, chemical, biological and other characteristics. Soil forms a
structure ﬁlled with pore spaces and can be thought of as a mixture of solids,
water, and gases. Soil degradation is main problem of present science.
• Land use. Land use involves the management and modiﬁcation of natural
environment or wilderness into built environment such as ﬁelds, pastures, and
settlements. Land use practices vary considerably across the world. Land use
and land management practices have a major impact on natural resources
including water, soil, nutrients, plants and animals.
• Nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter on an atomic
and molecular scale. This new perspective scientiﬁc ﬁeld can have unpredicted
consequences for the environment and humans.
• Nuclear issues. Nuclear energy use is one of perspective way in the energy
development, but there exist many problems connected with the safety.
• Overpopulation. Overpopulation is a generally undesirable condition where an
organism’s number exceeds the current carrying capacity of its habitat. The term
often refers to the relationship between the human population and its environ-
ment, the Earth, or smaller geographical areas such as countries. Overpopulation
can result from an increase in births, a decline in mortality rates, an increase in
immigration, or an unsustainable biome and depletion of resources. It is possible
for very sparsely populated areas to be overpopulated if the area has a meager or
non-existent capability to sustain life.
• Ozone depletion. Ozone is very rare and important in the Earth’s atmosphere.
Ozone plays a vital role in the atmosphere. Ozone is mainly found in two
regions of the Earth’s atmosphere. Most ozone (about 90 %) resides in a layer
that begins between 10 (near the poles) and 17 (over tropics) kilometers above
the Earth’s surface and extends up to about 50 km. This region of the atmo-
sphere is called the stratosphere. The ozone in this region is commonly known
as the ozone layer. The remaining ozone is in the lower region of the atmo-
sphere, which is commonly called the troposphere. Stratospheric ozone plays a
beneﬁcial role by absorbing most of the biologically damaging ultraviolet
sunlight, allowing only a small amount to reach the Earth’s surface.
• Pollution. Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural envi-
ronment that causes adverse change. Pollution can take the form of chemical
838
10
Ecoinformatics Problems in the Future World

substances or energy, such as noise, heat or light. Pollutants, or the components
of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring
contaminants.
• Water quality. Water quality refers to the chemical, physical and biological
characteristics of water. It is a measure of the condition of water relative to the
requirements of one or more biotic species and or to any human need or pur-
pose. It is most frequently used by reference to a set of standards against which
compliance can be assessed. The most common standards used to assess water
quality relate to health of ecosystems, safety of human contact and drinking
water.
• Air quality. The atmosphere is a complex dynamic natural gaseous system that is
essential to support life on planet Earth. Air pollution is the introduction into the
atmosphere of chemicals, particulates, or biological materials that cause dis-
comfort, disease, or death to humans, damage other living organisms such as
food crops, or damage the natural environment or built environment. Air pol-
lution is a signiﬁcant risk factor for multiple health conditions. The health effects
caused by air pollution may include difﬁculty in breathing, wheezing, coughing
and aggravation of existing respiratory and cardiac conditions.
• Reservoirs. The natural topography provides most of the basins of the reser-
voirs. Their exploitation is main problem of sustainability of many human life
aspects. Many dammed river reservoirs and most bank-side reservoirs are used
to provide the raw water feed to a water treatment plant which delivers drinking
water through water mains. Main problem is in the protection of water quality.
• Fishing. Fishing is the activity of trying to catch ﬁsh. Fish are normally caught
in the wild. Techniques for catching ﬁsh include hand gathering, spearing,
netting, angling and trapping. There are many ﬁshing techniques or methods for
catching ﬁsh. The ﬁshing industry includes any industry or activity concerned
with taking, culturing, processing, preserving, storing, transporting. Sustain-
ability problem of ﬁshing include overﬁshing, by-catch, marine pollution,
environmental effects of ﬁshing, climate change and ﬁsh farming.
• Logging. In common usage, the term “logging” is used to indicate a range of
forestry or silviculture activities. Logging is a dangerous occupation.
• Toxins. A toxin is a poisonous substance produced within living cells or
organisms. Man-made substances created by artiﬁcial processes are thus
excluded. Toxins can be products or byproducts of ordinary metabolism, such as
lactic acid, and they must be broken down or excreted before building up to
dangerous levels. Toxins can facilitate survival, as with snake venom that kills
or immobilizes prey, or cyanide produced by some plants as a defense against
being eaten. Bacterial toxins can sometimes be neutralized with antitoxins.
Toxins may be dangerous to human health.
• Waste. There are many waste types deﬁned by modern systems which support
human life. Waste can contaminate surface water, groundwater, soil, and air
which cause more problems for humans, other species, and ecosystems. Waste
treatment and disposal produces signiﬁcant green house gas emissions, notably
methane, which is contributing signiﬁcantly to global climate change.
10.3
Concluding Remarks About Global Humanity Problems
839

Thus, solution of sustainable development problems needs the global model of
the nature-society system evolution, which can give possibility to consider all the
complex interactions listed above. This requires a participation of specialists in
different areas of science. Unfortunately, global environmental problems are studied
separately. Successful progress in the evolution of global humanity can be achieved
by means of creation International Integrated System for Global Geoinformation
Monitoring (IISGGM) the functional structure of which is based on the evolu-
tionary neurocomputer technology. Such an accomplishment will take into account
the architecture of a modern computer system with assess to a network of evolution
—type tutorial servers. This will lead to such IISGGM structure that will simulate
the MCBS system with capability of evaluating nature protection measures and
other structural decisions on how human society can best interact with nature.
10.4 Mission to Mars: Reliable Method for Liquid
Solutions Diagnostics
10.4.1 Introduction
The NASA Marshall Spaceﬂight Center, European Space Agency, China National
Space Administration and Russian Space Agency have a long-term vision of
sending a manned mission to Mars in the very near future. For this campaign many
unresolved technical and social problems still remain, such as the creation of
favorable conditions for human health during the ﬂight and accommodation on this
planet. In this context, negative health effects can be caused by both drinking water
with distorted characteristics and medical products (e.g., solutions) with altered
properties. Ensuring the reliable operational control of these vitally important ele-
ments is one of the main stages during the preparation for the manned mission to
Mars. Such control of liquid solutions in the environment of Mars during ancient
years will be an important stage in the exploration and life support.
Martian drinking water is concentrated in the frozen phase into the soil and as ice
formations. Today, it is known that water on Mars exists almost exclusively as ice,
with a small amount present in the atmosphere as vapour. Results from the recently
published research suggest that the soil of the Martian surface contains water about
2 % by weight. Drinking water extracted from soil or surface ice needs the pre-
liminary investigation and continuous monitoring in time. The implementation of
this procedure is feasible by means of optical methods developed for the Earth
conditions without chemical analysis (Krapivin and Shutko 2012).
Krapivin et al. (2013b, c) showed that the development of multi-channel
polarization optical instruments and the use of spectro-ellipsometric technology are
very important for real-time ecological monitoring of aquatic environment. It
should be mentioned that efﬁcient solution of this multi-parametric problem greatly
depends on the precision and simplicity of ellipsometric devices. Recently,

considerable successes achieved in this area (Krapivin and Shutko 2012; Mkrtchyan
et al. 2013; Mkrtchyan and Krapivin 2014; Nitu et al. 2013a, b), notably:
• A technology of combined use of spectro-ellipsometry and algorithms of
identiﬁcation and recognition that allow the set-up of a standard integral com-
plex consisting of instrumental, algorithmic, modular and software tools for the
collection and processing of data about the quality of aquatic environment with
forecasting and decision—making functions.
• A compact measuring—information multichannel spectro-ellipsometric system
(device) for monitoring the quality of aquatic environment, that is based on the
combined use of spectro-ellipsometry and training, classiﬁcation, and identiﬁ-
cation algorithms. This spectro-ellipsometric system differs from the modern
foreign analogues by the use of a new and very promising method of ellipso-
metric measurements, an original element base of polarization optics and a
complex mathematical approach to estimate the quality of a water object sub-
jected to anthropogenic inﬂuence. Unlike foreign analogues, the above-men-
tioned system has no rotating polarization elements. This allows one to increase
the signal-to-noise ratio and the long-term stability of measurements, to simplify
and reduce the price of multichannel spectro-ellipsometers. This system is
trainable to the recognition of the pollutants of aquatic environment.
10.4.2 The Method Description
The detection and identiﬁcation of water quality, especially of drinking water, is
being addressed by many scientists (Sun et al. 2013). For example, the U.S.
National Water-Quality Assessment Program (NAWQA) provides an understand-
ing of water-quality conditions; whether conditions are getting better or worse over
time; and how natural features and human activities affect those conditions. In the
Earth’s conditions, water quality assessment is deﬁned depending on many envi-
ronmental factors connected with the environmental management from pollution
sinks and sources. Martian conditions make additional unknown amendments in the
task of reliable evaluation of drinking water that can be extracted on the Mars.
Therefore, method of the drinking water assessment does not depend on the
environment. Such a method can be based on the spectral analysis of water mass in
the optical range (Krapivin et al. 2008b).
The recently developed technology of an adaptive identiﬁcation of the envi-
ronmental elements from measurements in the visible spectral region permits to
synthesize an expert system for an adaptive identiﬁcation of the liquid solutions
(ESAILS). The system’s structure includes a compact multi-channel spectro-el-
lipsometer (MCS), information interface with computer (IIC), computer software
(CS), and extending database (ED). The CS offers a number of algorithms to
process the data ﬂuxes from MCS and provides service functions for visualization
and control of the regime of measurements. The ED consists of the sets of standard
10.4

spectral images of the liquid solutions represented by points in the multi-dimen-
sional vector space of indicators, pre-calculated on the basis of learning samples. In
particular, identiﬁcation algorithms (ID) carry out the task of liquid solution
assessment.
The principal scheme of the CS unit providing the procedure of identiﬁcation is a
transformation Φ (Fig. 10.3, Table 10.1). The light intensity ni
j recorded at the
moment ti in the channel λj enters the algorithm Φ, where two hypotheses H0 and
H1 are identiﬁed. The ESAILS operator determines initial data vi, α and β and
decides which parameters ui = (u1, … ,ur) will be calculated from measurements of
{ni
j}. The service unit IIC makes it possible to form vector ui from statistical
characteristics of the series {ni
j} or to use direct measurements. The a-priori
information characterizes the type of distribution fa(ui). The function

is compared with its ultimate values Li,min and Li,max At the ﬁrst stage, these
values are chosen arbitrarily, but then they change till reaching a maximum
accurate recognition of the hypotheses H0 and H1. We have Li,min →L*i,min and
Li,max →Li,max. The values L*i,min and Li,max are memorized in ED.
After the learning procedure, the functioning of the expert system is limited only
by the volume of measurements ﬁxed by the operator, proceeding from statistical
reliability and the real-time regime. The operator has two possibilities to regulate
this regime: establishing the volume of the series {ni
j} or ﬁxing the time of their
accumulation. Usually, the latter characteristic that is equal to 1 s is chosen.
Fig. 10.4 explains this procedure. The operator is combined with the ESAILS units
through the man-machine interface IIC, which provides the selective control of
operations in all units.
A knowledge of spectrums allows the recognition of two alternative hypotheses:
H0 (liquid solution is normal) and H1 (liquid solution is defective). The CS algo-
rithms have more sweeping functions allowing the more detailed diagnostics of
liquid solutions. These algorithms are based on cluster analysis and recognition
of spectral images. Recognition of liquid solution structure or receive of content of
chemical elements is possible after creation of spectral etalons in the ED. This stage
can be realized in the Earth’s conditions and on orbital space station taking into
consideration knowledge about weightlessness effects on liquid solution.
10.4.3 Conclusion
The discussion above showed that the ESAILS technology version can carry out the
task of liquid solution diagnostics in conditions where the use of chemical analysis
is not feasible. Such situation occurs both on Earth and in the space. This version is

performed in the context of concrete assumptions. It is shown that the actual use of
the diagnosis of the liquid solution during the Mars mission requires detailed
investigations.
In particular, the possible change of the liquid solution in the absence of gravity
(“Zero Gravity”) has not been studied until now. For instance, under zero gravity
conditions the changes in incompressibility, elasticity, convective heat exchange,
hydrostatic pressure, and other physical parameters of the solution can inﬂuence its
spectral properties in the optical range.
The weightlessness effects in many natural processes including those in the
liquid phase can lead to disturbances of living conditions. The above proposed
technology can help to detect such effects well in advance. In particular, stop of
engine can lead to change of ﬂight path. We discussed above the fact that the
operative spectral control of fuel solution can be realized by means of the ESAILS
adapted to this area.
The ESAILS employment as a speciﬁc onboard device for space expeditions is
possible considering the following actions:
• deﬁnition of liquid solutions that could be diagnosed by using the ESAILS tool;
• realization of the learning procedure in the Earth conditions to form database of
spectral images for these liquid solutions and assessment of the ESAILS
efﬁciency;
• realization of the recognition procedure for separate liquid solutions on the
International Space Station and assessment of the weightlessness inﬂuence on
spectral images of liquid solutions;
• the ESAILS modernization taking into account the assessments obtained; and
• production of the ESAILS as onboard device for space campaigns.
