Introduction
The increased importance of supply chain management (SCM) can be attributed 
to globalization, the shift toward outsourced and offshore manufacturing, and 
an increase in the number of products offered by a company. These trends 
have provided companies with unprecedented opportunities for growth, 
but at the risk of being driven out of business due to inefficient sales and 
operating models. 
An important message of this book is that it is all too easy to make supply 
chain decisions that are detrimental to the performance of the company, and 
you therefore need to carefully evaluate each situation to protect against 
this possibility. The decision-making process is by no means perfect in most 
companies, with poor judgment, risk aversion, fear, or habit dictating actions. 
This book attempts to provide a rigorous approach toward decision making, 
by providing quantitative models to evaluate situations and procedures to 
implement actions. Quantitative models are important since fact-based 
evaluations can offset emotion-based decisions.
In no way does this approach reduce the role of the individual. In fact, 
these mathematical models are by no means perfect, and they make several 
assumptions that can reduce accuracy for and relevance to a particular 
situation. Therefore, it is important to leverage the strengths of both 
approaches—quantitative models that process data for several hundreds or 
thousands of products and providing guidance and visibility to exceptions, 
and the individual providing guidance when influences and factors are outside 
the scope of the model. 
Finally, this is a book about concepts regarding the use of information related 
to demand and supply, and processes to implement change. It is the author’s 
anticipation that the discussions presented in this book will be valuable to 
supply chain practitioners, and will provide you with several ideas to improve 
the profitability of your company.

Introduction
The importance of supply chain management (SCM) is undeniable. Companies 
have invested a significant amount of time and money hiring personnel and 
implementing expensive software systems to help realize improvements. 
Although SCM is now offered as a course in many universities, the reality is 
that the knowledge required by the practitioner has mainly been gathered 
tediously on the job. The reason is that, unlike manufacturing and engineering, 
SCM is a relatively new field that originated in the industry in the early 1990s; 
as a result, it has not had the time to mature and become well understood.
Compounding the problem is that the term supply chain is now used in 
several industries with differing interpretations. For example, a government 
organization may view SCM as a form of procurement, while an electronics 
manufacturer may view it as a process for aligning activities across manufac-
turing, transportation, distribution, and order fulfillment. Universities have only 
recently started offering supply chain courses. As a result, new entrants to the 
field of SCM may be expected to have a better formal understanding of supply 
chain concepts. The majority of established practitioners, on the other hand, 
will not undergo retraining and may be expected to retain widely differing  
views on the practices.
It is not just a matter of biding time, however, until the newly minted practitioners  
have established their presence and disseminated a common understanding of 
SCM. The problem goes deeper. First, there is disparity in the course material 
across universities, the content being largely dictated by the background of the 
teacher. Second, there is often an extreme focus on complex mathematical  
methods (such as linear programming) rather than simple, easy-to-use math-
ematical models. Third, the concepts and methods taught tend to focus on 
a few simple, well-understood business cases and are not comprehensive 
enough to enable the practitioner to deal with situations encountered on a 
daily basis while operating a supply chain.

This book attempts to address these drawbacks by providing the practitioner  
with (a) a process-oriented approach to implementing change, (b) simple 
mathematical models that are easily understood, and (c) application of these 
models to several real business situations to provide an understanding of their 
pragmatic utility.
This chapter provides you with a background on some of the changes to the 
business that have increased the importance of supply chain management, and it 
shows you why traditional management approaches are not effective. The struc-
tural changes are explained from a network and financial perspective, followed 
by a discussion of the limitations of the current process framework and systems. 
I then introduce an SCM process framework that I have developed, based on my 
work with several leading manufacturers, to address these limitations.
A Changing Supply Network and Cost Structure
Supply chains have been reshaped since the 1990s. The need to grow and meet 
worldwide demand has driven many vertically integrated product companies to 
outsource manufacturing and logistics functions and become brand-oriented 
companies focused on product design and marketing. Even companies that have 
not adopted outsourcing have expanded local manufacturing operations to 
a network of factories in several continents. In tandem, other market forces, 
including a larger customer base, varied consumer preferences, and the need to 
innovate to stay ahead of the competition have resulted in a marked increase in 
the number of products offered by a company. For example, Nike states:
Our success depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product 
trends as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer 
demands in a timely manner.
—2010 Annual Report, Nike Inc.
Such a need is easily comprehended in consumer-oriented specialty products. 
However, this trend is true in other industries as well, including electronics, 
automotives, and consumer durables. Consider the example of Whirlpool, a 
manufacturer of refrigerators and washing machines:
High consumer preference for our versatile brands has helped Whirlpool 
Corporation strengthen our No. 1 position in Latin America. We drove 
ongoing margin expansion in 2013 due to our impressive new product 
launches, effective management of our resources and continued non-
core appliance growth. There were 50 major new products introduced 
in 2013.
—2013 Annual Report, Whirlpool Appliances Inc.

Product proliferation increases the variability in demand for each product, 
which, in turn, results in an increase in the inventory investment required to 
stock shelves or fulfill customer orders. In addition, there is a higher level of 
monetary risk the company faces due to this increased inventory position: If 
a particular product falls out of favor and does not sell, the company has no 
choice but to mark it down or declare the inventory scrap. Such write-offs are 
expensive and have a significant impact on profits.
Companies are of course also becoming more and more global. Nike’s revenues 
from the US declined from 78% in 1990 to 41% in 2013. Such changes are expe-
rienced by companies in all parts of the world; for example, Samsung Electronics, 
a Korea-based company, saw domestic sales decline from 36% to 10% from 
1998 to 2013. These globalization trends impact the supply chain in many ways, 
including increased complexity from operating the business in several countries. 
The many costs associated with importing goods into various countries (such 
as import duties and tariffs), when combined with fluctuating exchange rates 
and political influences, makes it hard to estimate margins. Furthermore, the 
challenges in estimating local demand and competition combine with extended 
shipping lead times to further increase inventory costs and liabilities.
For a majority of companies, the complexities associated with bringing new 
products to market in various parts of the world have been partly addressed by 
outsourcing the design and manufacture of products to contract manufacturers. 
One such company is Hewlett-Packard, a manufacturer of computers and periph-
erals. The illustrative quote in Figure 1-1 from the company’s annual report clearly 
indicates the strategy that the company has adopted in order to provide investors 
the enormous revenue growth from 1993 to 2013 (from almost $21 billion in 
1993 to $84 billion in 2013 for its computers and peripherals business divisions).
Increased reliance upon outsourced manufacturing 
“We utilize a umber of contract manufacturers (“CMs”)
and original design manufacturers (“ODMs”) around the
world to manufacture HP-designed products. The use
of CMs and ODMs is intended to generate cost
efficiencies and reduce time to market for certain HP-
designed products.”

This reliance on contract manufacturers has impacted the cost structure of 
the company. And while the investment in machinery and equipment relative 
to revenue has decreased, the cost of goods sold has significantly increased. 
However, the earnings relative to revenue has remained the same, possibly 
due to lower systems and administrative costs associated with divesting large 
manufacturing facilities.
Outsourcing manufacturing activities to a contract manufacturer that operates  
plants in countries with low-cost labor can result in reduced cost of goods 
that have high labor content. This trend toward offshoring is highlighted in 
the following excerpt from the annual report of a now-defunct furniture 
manufacturer:
There has been a significant change in recent years in the manner by 
which we bring products to market. Where we have traditionally been a 
domestic furniture manufacturer, we have shifted to a blended strategy, 
mixing domestic production with products sourced from offshore.
An increasing percentage of our products are being sourced from 
manufacturers located offshore, primarily in China, the Philippines, 
Indonesia, and Vietnam. We design and engineer these products, and we 
have them manufactured to our specifications by independent offshore 
manufacturers. We have informal strategic alliances with several of the 
larger foreign manufacturers whereby we have the ability to purchase, 
on a coordinated basis, a significant portion of the foreign manufacturers’ 
capacity, subject to quality control and delivery standards. Two of these 
manufacturers represented 20% and 12% of imported product during 
2005 and three other manufacturers represented in excess of 5% each.
—Furniture Brands International, Inc., 2005 Annual Report
Indeed, this offshoring to reduce manufacturing costssss is a trend seen in 
other industries as well, including apparel, building materials, electronics, phar-
maceuticals, and telecommunications. However, if the company is utilizing 
broadly available technologies or commodity-based products, then cost of 
goods may increase, because the company is forced to share margins with the 
contract manufacturer. In such cases, the company’s role becomes more of a 
distributor for overseas markets.
Figure 1-2 captures some of the ways in which supply chains have changed over 
the years. The dominant link in the traditional supply chain (with in-house, 
near-shore manufacturing) is the company’s manufacturing plant. In many cases, 
the company may not be required to operate separate distribution centers. 
That’s because a portion of the plant may be utilized for storing the produced 
materials, and the company can ship material directly from the plant to the dis-
tributor with facilities in various regions. In turn, the distributor would receive 
orders from the retailer and ship material to the retailer’s distribution centers 
or directly to the retail stores.

In contrast, the off-shore and often outsourced supply chain is different in 
many ways: The manufacturing plant is now owned by the contract manufac-
turer, and the company negotiates capacity contracts spanning several months 
or quarters and issues purchase orders for the production and delivery of

materials. Since the company has divested its manufacturing facility, it is now 
necessary to operate distribution centers to receive material from the con-
tract manufacturer and hold buffer inventory. The company may choose to 
operate the distribution centers or utilize the facilities of a third-party logistics 
provider (3PL). While distributors remain one channel for distribution of prod-
ucts, the channel focus has often shifted to direct sales to large retailers and 
online sales to consumers.
The overall trend has been to reduce the assets required to deliver products, 
with reliance on contract manufacturers for production, third-party logistics 
providers for holding inventory, transportation providers for overseas and 
inland movement of goods, and web stores in lieu of a physical presence. This 
shift to a virtual supply chain has far-reaching impact on the flow of goods 
and information, and the importance of inventory as a buffer between the 
various parties.
In addition, outsourcing affects the cost structure in one other significant way: 
It reduces fixed costs and increases variable costs. This results in very different  
outcomes when the company experiences variability in demand or supply. This 
change is better understood via an example. Table 1-1 summarizes costs for 
a manufacturing plant that produces goods worth $10 million on a cost-basis.  
For simplicity, the plant is assumed to produce only one type of product. In the 
example, 65% of the entire cost is fixed, while the variable cost is 35%.

Contrast this situation with an outsourced manufacturing situation shown in 
Table 1-2. Because the company sources this product from a contract manu-
facturer, the contract would typically include a commitment to purchase a 
certain volume of product at a certain unit price over a particular time period 
(such as per quarter or per year). Since the goods produced by the con-
tract manufacturer needs to be shipped to the company’s distribution centers, 
additional transportation and warehousing costs needs to be incorporated. 
Additionally, since the company does not operate a manufacturing plant, there 
are no operating assets, maintenance and repair, or utilities to be paid.

Comparing the cost summaries in Table 1-1 and Table 1-2, you can see several 
differences. The first is that fixed costs have been greatly reduced with out-
sourced manufacturing. These costs have been converted to variable costs 
since payments are made on a per-unit basis to the contract manufacturer 
and the third-party warehouse logistics provider. Since the total cost remains 
$100 per unit, it would appear that there is no difference between the two 
cases on a cost basis. Indeed, if the company were able to realize sales as tar-
geted, then the two situations would provide identical margins. If, however, the 
company experiences variability in demand and price, then the two situations 
have very different outcomes on a cost basis, as shown in Table 1-3.

Chapter 1 | Introduction

In the example, a price rebate situation is analyzed. The company experi-
ences demand variability and is not on track to sell the projected volume at 
the planned price (i.e., 100,000 units at $150 per unit). In order to meet the 
revenue target, the price is reduced by $10, which boosts sales and allows 
the company to meet its revenue target. However, the resulting impact on 
margins is very different for the two situations. In the in-house manufacturing 
situation with high fixed costs, the margin erosion is only 1% (from 33% to 
32%); however, in the outsourced manufacturing situation with high variable 
costs, margin erosion is 4%. The lower margin erosion in the former case is 
due to the fixed cost being spread over additional sales units, thus reducing 
unit costs by a greater value for the in-house manufacturing situation. The 
outsourced manufacturing situation behaves poorly since unit costs are main-
tained at the original level ($95 per unit) even though price is reduced. If unit 
costs were to be proportionally reduced, then margin erosion could be con-
tained; however, such cost reductions are often hard to enforce since supply 
commitments and purchase prices are typically made several months prior to 
demand due to longer lead times associated with contract manufacturing and 
ocean transportation.

Conversely, if a price reduction was not initiated and demand were to come 
in below the target value, the in-house manufacturing situation would result 
in higher margin erosion because fixed costs are distributed over fewer units. 
As a result, the predominant behavior in the in-house manufacturing situation 
is to plan production for the plant (usually for a two- or three-month horizon)  
and then maximize sales, relying on price rebates if necessary. However, this 
management approach will perform adversely in the outsourced manufacturing  
situation due to the markedly different cost structure.
The difference is exacerbated if business variability is high. Figure 1-3 examines 
demand variability for two industries—consumer durables and computers 
and electronics—measured by new orders for manufacturers, as tracked by 
the U.S. Census Bureau. The data reveals that the computer industry exhibits 
more variability than the consumer durables, as can be expected due to the 
shorter product lifecycles associated with computer products. Additionally, 
the inherent variability has remained at a high level for over two decades 
in both industries. Wise supply chain managers therefore review new order 
data for their own and other industries and note a similar trend in variability. 
Several reasons contribute to the variability, including frequent new product 
launches, product proliferation, increased competition, and rapidly changing 
customer preferences.

Given the changing cost structure and dynamic business environment faced 
by most companies, the natural question is how management practices should 
change. Are the company’s current processes ready to handle these changes? 
Are the systems in place appropriate for the dealing with this extended and 
increasingly virtual supply chain? Are the people in the company schooled to 
think in a different way? Each of these areas is examined in detail in the fol-
lowing sections of this chapter.
The Process Framework: MPC vs. SCM
The historical focus on manufacturing efficiency needs to change in order to 
manage a network of companies responsible for timely supply, production, and 
distribution. Practitioners have typically been trained to rely on the manufac-
turing planning and control (MPC) process framework to manage the business. 
This section describes the MPC process, lists some of the drawbacks with 
this approach, and specifies the SCM process framework that addresses these 
drawbacks.
The MPC framework, shown in Figure 1-4, supports activities related to the 
production of sub-assemblies and finished goods and the procurement of raw 
materials. These steps are briefly described below.1

The main steps for managing the flow of material and use of resources are 
demand management, production planning, master production scheduling, 
rough cut capacity planning, and materials requirements planning.
Demand management encompasses forecasting customer and product demand, 
order entry, and order processing.
Production planning specifies the manufacturing plan that will support the 
specified demand, frequently expressed as output in financial units such as  
dollars. When it is not possible for the factories to produce a sufficient amount 
of goods to meet demand, the production plan provides a basis for understanding  
the extent of the shortfall, and how scarce material or capacity should be best 
utilized. Therefore, one of the main goals of production planning is to match 
demand with supply, and provide a framework for optimizing resource utilization.  
The production plan is often expressed in monthly periods and can span several 
quarters, depending on the lead time required to manufacture goods. 
Master production scheduling (MPS) is the detailed version of the production plan, 
expressed in production units for each product, usually for an 8- to 13-week 
time horizon. While converting the monthly production plan into weekly 
schedules, the MPS considers guidelines related to setup times and production  
batch sizes, which helps reduce costs and create a feasible schedule.
When appropriate, the MPS is modified based on rough cut capacity planning 
(RCCP), which checks for capacity shortfalls and bottlenecks. The calculations 
for this are based on setups and time taken to perform various production 
tasks. When a capacity shortfall is encountered, the production schedule is 
modified to best meet the production plan. However, if capacity shortfalls are 
severe and it is not possible to meet the plan for the entire month, then the 
financial impact of the shortfall (in terms of variance from the production 
plan) is computed and made available to management for decision making.
The master production schedule is converted into raw material supply require-
ments using material requirements planning (MRP). MRP uses a bill of material 
to connect finished goods to sub-assemblies and raw materials, and a specific 
time phasing logic (based on production lead times) to convert production 
requirements into supplies. Finally, shop-floor scheduling and purchasing use 
the output of MRP for creating detailed production schedules and purchase 
orders, respectively.
Each of the process steps of the MPC framework is executed according to 
a schedule: demand management and production planning are typically per-
formed at the beginning of each month, while master production scheduling, 
capacity planning, and material requirements planning are performed at the 
beginning of each week. The remaining activities are performed on a daily 
basis or prior to each shift.

Chapter 1 | Introduction
12
The process flow shown in Figure 1-4 is illustrative of a “pull” process, in 
which demand drives supply activities such as production and purchasing. If a 
demand forecast drives supplies, then the production activities are classified 
as build-to-forecast; if actual customer orders drive supplies, then production 
is build-to-order. While a build-to-order supply chain has less risk, it is typically 
not feasible to operate entirely in this mode due to long lead times associated 
with certain manufacturing or purchasing activities. Therefore, most companies 
operate as build-to-order for activities closer to the customer (such as final 
assembly and packaging) and build-to-forecast for longer lead time activities.
Conversely, a company that commits to a certain level of production and 
subsequently aligns demand based on this plan is classified as a “push” supply 
chain. Examples include mining, oil extraction, and the recycling industries. In 
each of these cases, there is a commitment for a certain level of production 
over an extended period of time (ranging from several quarters to several 
years). During this time period, the companies need to “find” the demand for 
the produced volume. If there is a significant mismatch between market supply 
and demand, production volume changes can be initiated only at the end of 
the commitment period. For such a push supply chain, the process framework  
would look different since supplies are the driving factor. Therefore, demand 
management is driven by the production schedule. Additionally, the demand 
management process mainly deals with the allocation of the production schedule  
to specific customer accounts and orders.
Similar to MPC for manufacturing organizations, warehouse management 
systems (WMS) help manage the distribution section of the supply chain, 
providing functionality for tracking inventory, entering sales orders, placing 
purchase orders, and receiving and shipping goods.
Companies have found that the MPC framework does not provide adequate 
support for the new business environment. A few of the issues include:
• 
Lack of support for scale and globalization. Businesses 
have grown from a single factory to multiple factories  
distributed across the world and distribution networks 
consisting of central and regional warehouses in several 
continents. The traditional MPC framework is oriented 
to the management of a single facility and is not well-
equipped to deal with this network of suppliers, factories,  
distribution centers, and customers. As a result, coor-
dination of material and capacity across these differ-
ent facilities needs to be performed outside the scope  
of MPC. 

The Profitable Supply Chain
13
• 
Lack of support for the outsourced environment. The out-
sourcing of manufacturing operations to other companies 
has required increased formality and structure between 
the different functions. What used to be operations  
under the same roof have now been transferred to  
different companies, often in different continents. MPC 
provides limited support for the increasingly collaborative 
relationships required to operate in this environment.
• 
Inadequate treatment of variability. The MPC framework 
has limited treatment of demand uncertainty and supply 
variability. When lead times were of the order of two or 
three weeks and demand was localized, ad hoc procedures 
and simple rules sufficed since the cost impact was limited. 
However, global markets, a proliferation of products, and 
increasing lead times have increased variability and stressed 
the MPC framework.
• 
Inadequate treatment of network optimization. Since the 
MPC framework focuses mainly on a single plant, it does 
not provide guidance regarding optimal placement of 
manufacturing and distribution facilities. These analyses 
are performed outside the framework, and the results 
of the analysis in the form of material routings and costs 
are provided as inputs to MPC. The current business 
environment requires that companies re-evaluate and 
reconfigure the network on a more frequent basis, due 
to higher fuel prices, expansion into new markets, or an 
increase in the number of facilities due to mergers and 
acquisitions. Lack of support for this important function 
is a significant drawback of the MPC framework.
• 
Limited analysis of variable costs. While demand management 
and production planning are expressed in financial terms, 
the remaining MPC functions are completed using pro-
duction units. Since several important decisions are taken 
during capacity planning and MRP, there is no visibility 
to the impact of these actions on profits. This approach 
may have been justifiable when fixed costs were high and 
estimating costs for specific activities were not clear or 
subject to error. However, as variable costs have increased, 
it has become important, and increasingly feasible, to 
estimate cost impact and to include these considerations 
in the decision-making process. 

Chapter 1 | Introduction
14
In conclusion, while MPC continues to be a useful framework for managing 
the individual plant, a new approach is required for managing the entire supply 
chain. SCM emerged toward the beginning of the 1990s to address some of 
these drawbacks. Unlike MPC, there is little standardization in the specification 
of the SCM process, and it had achieved a good deal of adoption by companies 
before being offered as part of the management sciences curriculum in busi-
ness schools. You are likely to see different representations of SCM across 
manufacturing companies and software vendors. A common illustration of 
SCM is shown in Figure 1-5.

Figure 1-5. The supply chain management (SCM) process framework
The SCM framework consists of several processes: inventory planning, network 
planning, demand planning, supply planning, and sales and operations planning 
(S&OP). This framework directly addresses several of the issues present in MPC:
• 
Network planning reduces costs by optimizing the placement 
of facilities and flow of goods, considering transportation, 
warehousing, and manufacturing costs.
• 
Inventory planning calculates optimal customer service 
levels, inventory levels, and cash budgets considering 
uncertainty in demand, variability in supply, as well as 
costs for holding inventory and for missing demand.
• 
Supply planning utilizes these targets to plan production 
and purchases for the entire network of distribution 
centers and manufacturing plants. Thus, it addresses the 
single-facility limitation of MPC.

• 
S&OP is a cross-functional process for reviewing and 
reacting to demand and supply imbalances. This process 
involves executives and stakeholders and addresses the 
inwardly focused nature of MPC.
• 
Demand collaboration and supply collaboration explicitly 
include partners (retailers, contract manufacturers, 
and strategic suppliers) into the information-sharing 
process.
As with MPC, the supply chain management framework divides the processes 
into planning and execution categories. This distinction is important since 
the nature of activities differ between the two: While execution processes 
tend to be transactional and numerous, planning activities are performed 
less frequently, are more analytical, and often involve upper management. 
Demand planning, supply planning, and S&OP are usually performed on 
a monthly basis. Inventory planning may be performed on a monthly or 
quarterly basis, depending on the extent to which the demand plan fluctu-
ates month-to-month. Network planning may be a quarterly or even an 
annual activity.
Figure 1-6 illustrates the various uses of these processes by different depart-
ments within a company. There are several processes—network planning, 
inventory planning, and S&OP—that involve all departments. Indeed, as SCM 
continues to evolve, additional stakeholders are included; the involvement of 
finance in the cross-functional processes has become standard. In addition, the 
engineering department may also be included for network and inventory plan-
ning, since product design features such as modularity and component common-
ality can significantly supply chain performance. This is one of the key features of 
supply chain management—it explicitly considers the impact of actions of one 
part of the company on another, involves all parties impacted, and allows for 
decisions to be made that are beneficial not just for a department, but for the 
company as a whole.

Supply Chain Systems
The use of software applications in SCM is extensive, mainly due to the grow-
ing scale of businesses, the adverse impact of process variances, and the need 
to stay competitive in an increasingly digital environment. An example of sys-
tem layout for SCM is shown in Figure 1-7; these systems are segmented 
based on enterprise vs. collaborative systems, as well as centralized vs. site 
deployments. Planning and business intelligence systems are usually deployed 
in a centralized fashion, so that operations can be viewed across sites and 
synergies and cross-site decisions can be taken. Systems for communication 
and collaboration have gained in importance due to the need to quickly com-
municate new and important information to partners, and electronic data inter-
change (EDI) networks are being augmented with web-based collaborative 
systems that allow partners to analyze the data and make changes.

Some of the key differences between traditional MPC and supply chain sys-
tems are the following:
• 
Site vs. corporate deployment. Manufacturing planning and con-
trol systems are deployed to specific manufacturing plants 
(i.e., decentralized deployment). For example, for a company 
with five plants, five different instances of the MPC systems, 
one for each plant, must be installed. Similarly, warehouse 
management systems are deployed to specific distribution 
centers. In contrast, supply chain systems are deployed at 
a corporate level (i.e., centralized deployment). This cen-
tralized deployment allows for activities to be coordinated 
across plants and distribution centers, providing the com-
pany the opportunity to optimize operations across facilities.  
However, centralized deployments come with their own 
challenges, such as the effort required to synchronize the 
collection of data across multiple facilities.
• 
Desktop vs. server deployment. The traditional desktop 
deployment of production planning systems has changed 
over time to server deployments. This has allowed for 
plans to be shared between people and better support 
cross-functional workflows. Servers also provide greater 
computational power, which is required for supporting 
increased scale due to product proliferation and multi-
site supply chains. Additionally, for companies providing 
supply chain systems, server-based systems are far easier 
to maintain and manage.

• 
Batch vs. real-time data collection. The prevalence of bar 
codes or Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags on 
shipments has resulted in the collection of a significant 
volume of data related to in-transit and on-hand inven-
tory. Since this data can be used in the demand and 
supply planning processes to obtain a real-time view of 
inventory and make better decisions, real-time (or near 
real-time) data collection has become an integral part of 
the supply chain systems design.
• 
Manual vs. automated workflows. The prevalence of server-
based systems and high-bandwidth networks has enabled 
automation with respect to data transfers between systems 
and partners. Workflows have also become automated, 
and review and approval steps for various decisions are 
now completed within the system, without having to doc-
uments and emails. As a result, it is rely on cumbersome 
common for a workflow system to be an integral part of 
the system landscape.
• 
Proprietary vs. open networks. The traditional method of 
using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) to communicate 
with suppliers and customers continues to be used by 
most companies. However, the inflexibility of EDI com-
bined with the need to communicate additional infor-
mation has resulted in the creation of communication 
networks that use the Internet as the transport mecha-
nism, and data models tuned to supporting a collabora-
tive exchange.
• 
Proprietary vs. industry standards. As companies begin to 
collaborate with several partners, the need for an indus-
try standard became apparent. For example, consider a 
manufacturer collaborating with a dozen retailers; if each 
retailer communicates purchase forecasts and orders in a 
proprietary format, the manufacturer is forced to accom-
modate and stay abreast with all these formats, which 
increases the cost of doing business. This has been the 
main driver for standards such as RosettaNet for the 
electronics industry and Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, 
and Replenishment (CPFR) for the retail industry. These 
standards define a data model for exchanging informa-
tion as well as recommended workflows for timing the 
exchanges.

As the Internet continues to evolve, network bandwidth continues to become 
more readily available, and new devices for ready access of information are 
invented, the supply chain systems landscape will continue to evolve to take 
advantage of these capabilities. The chapter on the evolving supply chain 
(Chapter 8) covers some of the changes that are forthcoming.
The Supply Chain Organization
Traditionally, supply chain management has not been a separate department 
within the company, but a set of processes performed by personnel from 
other departments such as manufacturing and procurement. However, this is 
changing as large- and mid-sized companies have realized that the cost benefits  
that can be achieved by focusing on supply chain efficiency are significant. This 
has resulted in the creation of a dedicated organization with ownership of the 
cross-functional processes and supply chain systems.
The role of the person performing these planning functions, referred to as 
“the analyst,” is essential to ensuring that each step is being executed in the 
best possible manner. In large companies, several people may be required to 
perform the different functions, but it is important for skills and a common 
understanding to be shared. Often, the role is filled by an individual from 
manufacturing, distribution, or procurement. While in-depth knowledge of a 
particular discipline is important, the requirements of a supply chain analyst  
are much broader, as described in Table 1-4. Not only does the analyst require 
an understanding of the different disciplines in the company, but she also needs 
to be aware of the financial situation and management methods. Finally, in 
order to be successful, the analyst needs to be able to effectively communicate  
issues, actions, and results to the company’s executives.

Summary
Supply chain management is the process of efficiently coordinating the flow 
of material across suppliers, transportation providers, manufacturers, distribu-
tors, and retailers. Executed properly, SCM will improve customer service and 
revenue achievement while simultaneously reducing operating costs. Achieving 
this goal requires a structured approach towards managing production, distri-
bution, and working capital. The remaining chapters provide the details of the 
methods for managing demand and supply. Chapter 2 is on inventory planning 
and describes the approach toward managing mismatches between demand 
and supply. These approaches connect operating inefficiencies to cost and 
margins, and this understanding is required for understanding the benefit from 
planning and effective supply chain management.
Chapter 3 is on demand planning and describes methods for specifying the 
demand signal considering several factors—historical sales, market conditions, 
customer budgets, demographics, and environmental factors. The benefit from 
an accurate demand signal is without debate, and companies in almost every 
industry will find that some or all these methods are useful for improving 
accuracy.

The Profitable Supply Chain
21
Chapter 4 is on supply planning and describes methods for converting the 
demand signal into a production and procurement signal considering several 
factors—on-hand inventories within the enterprise and in the channels, open 
purchase orders, manufacturing and supply lead times, manufacturing capacities,  
and safety stock targets.
Chapter 5 is on sales and operations planning, which is the process step that 
brings the different parts of an organization to a common understanding and 
plan. This process needs to be designed with care since it involves executives  
from different disciplines—an improperly designed process can have the 
adverse effect of wasting precious time.
Chapter 6 is on network planning and describes several approaches toward 
understanding optimal placement of manufacturing and distribution locations 
in the supply chain network.
Chapter 7 is on supply chain performance and provides metrics for managing the 
various supply chain functions—manufacturing, procurement, transportation,  
and the overall supply chain. This chapter also introduces some ideas for 
continuous improvement.
Chapter 8 is on the evolving supply chain and introduces several developments 
that can have a lasting impact on the supply chain, specifically in the areas of 
production, fulfillment, real-time information, systems, and carbon footprint.
Finally, Chapter 9 concludes with some key takeaways from all these areas. 
For many companies, supply chain practices have been developed in an ad hoc 
manner, which can result in disparate approaches toward managing different 
product lines and business situations. The points highlighted in this chapter list 
some of the common mistakes made by adopting these ad hoc approaches.

C H A P T E R 
Inventory 
Planning
Goods-producing companies hold inventory to fulfill orders or in anticipation 
of customer demand. Indeed, inventory is reported as an asset on the balance 
sheet, so a company’s executives may approve holding high inventory levels in 
order to meet its obligations. However, in a challenging business environment 
where products are frequently discounted or discontinued, holding inventory 
has become increasingly detrimental to operational performance.
A company often maintains inventory levels based on simple rules in order 
to ensure availability, but with no consideration given to impact on margins. 
Textbooks provide some approaches toward analyzing inventory margins, but 
the mathematical models are often too rudimentary to be applied to typical 
business situations. This chapter provides a comprehensive approach toward 
analyzing and managing inventory situations, including the inventory-planning 
procedure and mathematical models for analyzing margins. Several examples 
are provided to help clarify how these models can be applied to practical 
situations.
The chapter begins with a detailed review of the role of inventory in opera-
tions and an activity-based categorization of inventory. Following this, math-
ematical models for analyzing inventory levels are developed for each of these 
categories. The chapter concludes by applying these models to analyze various 
business situations, illustrated via numerical examples using spreadsheets.

Chapter 2 | Inventory Planning

The Role of Inventory in Operations
The importance of maintaining inventories can be seen from the U.S. Census 
Bureau’s survey of Manufacturer’s Shipments and Inventories (see Table 2-1). 
An electronics manufacturer is continually driving down inventory levels due 
to the risk of price erosion and obsolescence, while an apparel manufacturer 
might choose to maintain higher inventories to ensure adequate service levels. 
Additionally, inventory policies can vary by product within an industry—the 
same apparel manufacturer may hold lesser inventory of seasonal or fash-
ion-oriented garments. As expected, electronics manufacturers maintain low 
inventories, mainly due to rapid price erosion. On the other hand, pharmaceu-
ticals manufacturers maintain far higher inventory levels since there are fewer 
concerns related to price erosion and obsolescence.

Here are some common reasons for holding inventory:
To protect against that possibility of missed revenue if 
• 
demand is higher than anticipated.
To ensure that the lack of availability of supplies in a timely 
• 
manner does not result in missed demand.
To take advantage of quantity discounts, and in anticipa-
• 
tion of price increases.
To negotiate seasonal demand and smooth production 
• 
schedules.
To prepare for an industry-wide shortage of raw materi-
• 
als or critical parts.
However, holding inventory above the immediate needs of a company has 
a negative aspect in the form of additional costs. These are represented as 
holding costs, which includes the cost of storage and handling, the cost due to 
tying up capital, as well as the possibility of theft, damage, and obsolescence. 
Therefore, the whole effort related to optimizing inventory revolves around 
balancing the benefits of inventory against these costs. A few of the questions 
that need to be addressed by inventory management, keeping this trade-off in 
mind, include:
What is the inventory level required to ensure a particu-
• 
lar level of service to the customer?
What is the quantity that needs to be ordered for a par-
• 
ticular product or part? How should these quantities be 
phased over time?
How should inventory levels be set in order to minimize 
• 
transportation, manufacturing, and purchasing costs?
How do supplier lead times and commitment windows 
• 
affect inventory policy?
How should inventory policies be set for seasonal and 
• 
lifecycle products?
How should inventory be staged across the distribution 
• 
network to maximize return on investment?
How should part inventory levels be determined when 
• 
the part is used across many different products?
These questions can arise at several different stages in the supply chain, within 
and across companies, as shown in Figure  2-1 and Figure  2-2. The figures 
list common inventory categories based on the progression of material and 
products through the supply chain. Comparing the two figures reveals that 

Chapter 2 | Inventory Planning
26
several inventory-related questions are common for the two supply chains, 
even though the products and sales models are very different. The most com-
mon inventory categories are the following:
• 
Cycle stock is the inventory required to meet the expected 
demand until the next replenishment occurs, where the 
expected demand is a combination of firm orders and 
forecasts. Since cycle stock does not account for the 
unexpected, safety stock (or buffer inventory) is the 
inventory required to account for uncertainty in demand 
and supply variability.
• 
Batch inventory is the quantity required in order to mini-
mize transportation, manufacturing, and purchasing costs. 
For transportation, this includes supplies required to take 
advantage of full container or truckloads. For manufac-
turing, this includes any additional production required 
to minimize setup and run costs. For purchasing, this 
includes the additional supplies required to take advan-
tage of price discounts.
• 
Seasonal or prebuild inventory refers to the accumulation 
of inventory due to capacity constraints at manufacturing 
plants. Hedge or stockpile inventory refers to any addi-
tional purchases made in anticipation of an industry-wide 
scarcity or price hike.
• 
Staged inventory refers to inventory at a distribution cen-
ter that is not used to service customer demand directly, 
but instead used to service regional (localized) distribu-
tion centers.

These inventory categories are applicable to finished goods as well as raw mate-
rial inventory. For a business, inventory simultaneously represents a benefit 
and a risk—the benefit obtained from holding inventory and quickly fulfill-
ing orders is offset by the possibility of tying up capital and risking obsoles-
cence. Some of these risks and trade-offs are schematized in Table 2-2. On 
account of this two-sided nature of inventory, it is necessary to analyze busi-
ness situations carefully in order to ensure that inventory levels are frequently 
adjusted as changes occur. The methods and tools for determining the optimal 
response for different situations are described in the remaining sections of 
this chapter.

29
The Inventory Planning Process
In most companies, the responsibility for inventory management belongs to 
the supply chain organization. If the company does not have a separate supply 
chain department, this responsibility may belong to manufacturing, procure-
ment, or distribution, depending on the company’s heritage. In all situations, 
it is important to identify a single person to be held responsible for all inven-
tory decisions in order to ensure that decisions are being made in a timely 
and uniform manner, and that questions from others within the company are 
adequately addressed.
Managing inventories is a data-intensive process, requiring, at a minimum, 
demand, lead time, and cost data. An example of a planning process and the 
flow of information is shown in Figure 2-3. The process begins with collecting 
data, followed by calculating demand and supply variability. These uncertainty 
values drive the level of buffers required in the system. In addition, when vari-
ability is tracked over time, it provides insight into items for which operational 
performance has deteriorated. For example, if the supply variability for an 
item has changed from 3 days to 10 days, it highlights the need to review the 
procedures in place with the relevant supplier and transportation provider.

Chapter 2 | Inventory Planning

Once these uncertainty values have been updated, the next step is to calculate 
the optimal service level and the resulting safety stock requirements. The opti-
mal service level is calculated based on several factors, including demand and 
supply variability, the projected demand, inventory holding costs, and shortage 
costs associated with inadequate inventory. These new targets are compared 
with the current values for safety stock (for material planning purposes) or 
reorder points (for replenishment). At this point, the workflow for accepting 
changes may differ by company depending on the number of items that need 
to be planned as well as item costs and margins. If there are several thousands 
of items, then a “control limits” approach can be used to automatically accept 
changes if they are below a threshold. However, if the differences exceed a 
certain threshold or if the cost of inventory is high, these changes can be 
manually reviewed. During manual review, the analyst needs to evaluate the 
reasons for the change, determine if any changes to the inputs (variability, lead 
times, and costs) need to be made, and redo the calculations, if necessary.
Figure 2-3. The inventory planning process

The Profitable Supply Chain
31
Once a list of changes has been created, the next step is to compare the 
implications of the change on cash requirements. Typically, inventory budgets 
are specified at a product line or facility level; therefore, the cash requirements 
across a set of items will need to be added and compared with the budget. If 
the requirements are higher, then the analyst has to determine, with help from 
finance, whether there is a reason to revise the budgets. However, if budget 
changes are not an option, then the analyst has to allocate the available cash 
to the different items. An example of a cash allocation procedure is provided 
later in this chapter.
The final step in the process is to export the data to other systems, includ-
ing updated reorder points to replenishment systems, and updated safety 
stock targets to supply planning and materials requirements planning systems. 
Changes to these policies are also used to update targeted metrics—target 
turns and days of inventory, cash investment levels, and the updated gross mar-
gin return on inventory (GMROI).
The frequency with which the inventory planning process needs to be per-
formed is determined by several factors, including the following:
Updates to the demand forecast
• 
Updates to inventory budgets
• 
Addition of new products, customers, parts, and 
• 
suppliers
Addition of new distribution locations
• 
Of these factors, only the first two are periodic in nature: demand planning is 
usually performed on a monthly basis, and budgeting is performed on a quar-
terly basis. Therefore, inventory planning is performed on a quarterly basis, 
with monthly reviews in case demand patterns have changed significantly. In 
addition, inventory planning will need to be performed on an as-needed basis 
as new products and facilities are added.
Measures of Inventory Performance
To determine how much inventory a company needs to maintain, it is first 
necessary to define a few metrics to represent goals. The most fundamen-
tal metric for maintaining inventory is customer service. If there is sufficient 
inventory, then the customer’s order is fulfilled in a timely manner and the 
customer is satisfied. Otherwise, the customer may have to wait, be offered 
a reduced price, or leave empty-handed and buy a competing product. A few 
common measures of inventory performance are briefly described below. 
(Chapter 7 describes at length the methods for evaluating and managing 
inventory performance.)

Chapter 2 | Inventory Planning
32
• 
Stockout service level. This is the probability of fulfilling all 
orders from inventory in a particular period. If an order 
is short-shipped even a single unit, then it is considered 
a stockout. This metric is useful in situations when a cus-
tomer charges a penalty for receiving partially filled ship-
ments. Another way to think about the stockout metric 
is the probability that stock will be depleted before the 
arrival of new supplies.
• 
Fill rate. This is the number of units fulfilled from inven-
tory. This is less exacting than the stockout metric since 
credit is given for fulfilling a portion of the order. For 
example, if 100 units are ordered in a period that has 
only 95 units of inventory, then the fill rate is calculated as 
95%. However, since not all 100 units were shipped from 
inventory, the stockout metric for this period is 0. The fill 
rate metric is useful when the penalty is best reflected by 
the number of units left unfulfilled, or when partial ship-
ments are not penalized.
• 
Period fill rate. This is the number of units fulfilled from 
inventory and replenishments, as a proportion of the 
total units ordered in a time period. Since this measure-
ment includes inventory that can be made available over 
a period of time, it is the least exacting of the three cus-
tomer service measurements. This metric is useful when 
the turnaround time required by the customer allows 
for replenishments, after factoring the time taken to ship 
products to the customer.
• 
Days of inventory. The number of units or financial value 
of inventory, in isolation, can be misleading if demand 
changes significantly. A more revealing measure is days of 
inventory, measured as the number of days of sales that 
can be supported by the inventory. An alternative way to 
calculate this metric as the number of units of inventory 
divided by the average daily demand.
• 
Inventory turns. This is the number of times inventory is 
turned over in a year. When turns is calculated based on 
units of sales, then it is equal to the annual sales divided 
by average inventory over the year. Upon comparing this 
measurement with the days of inventory, it is easy to see 
that the two measurements share an inverse relationship 
and it is possible to derive one from the other. However, it 
is common to calculate turns based on the financial value 
of sales; the formula is the cost of goods sold divided by 

The Profitable Supply Chain
33
average inventory. This financial calculation can result in 
different values as compared to the units-based calcula-
tion due to cost variances over the year. Inventory turns 
is the most popular measure of inventory performance, 
and is also referred to as inventory turnover or stock 
turnover.
• 
GMROI. This is the income generated from every dollar 
spent on inventory, calculated as the annual profit divided 
by the average value of inventory over all the weeks of 
the year. Note that the GMROI aligns with return on 
assets for companies for which inventory is the primary 
operating asset, such as distributors and retailers.
Variability in the Supply Chain
Demand and supply variability are the primary factors driving the need for 
buffers in the supply chain (other factors include an increase in defective parts 
and lower-than-anticipated manufacturing yields). Demand uncertainty arises 
due to several factors—changing consumer preferences, economic conditions, 
environmental factors, new regulations, and competitive pressures, to name a 
few. Since it is impossible to eliminate these sources of variability, companies 
have attempted to reduce the impact by increasing the lead time that is avail-
able to satisfy demand (the order lead time). When the order lead time can be 
extended to the level that it is greater than the lead time required to procure 
raw material and manufacture product, then the company operates in a build-
to-order (BTO) environment.
An example of a BTO environment is the custom furniture supply chain. Only 
after the order from the customer has been confirmed does the manufacturer 
order raw materials and produce the item. This results in delivery of product 
to the consumer four to five months after order placement. Due to this com-
mitment provided by the customer, BTO models do not experience demand 
uncertainty. However, most companies do not have the luxury to dictate lead 
times. Retailers have to deal with zero order lead times since the product has 
to be available on the store shelves when the consumer walks into the store. 
Manufacturers usually have a one- to two-week order lead time to ship mate-
rial after receiving the order from the retailer, and the manufacturer has no 
option but to manufacture products to a forecast. This situation is referred to 

Chapter 2 | Inventory Planning
34
as build-to-forecast (BTF) or build-to-stock (BTS). Short lead times are important 
in business-to-business situations as well, as underscored in this excerpt from 
an annual report of the Houston Wire & Cable Company:
Our cable management program is an inventory management system that 
pre-allocates specialty wire and cable for a customer’s specific project and 
includes a custom program designed to manage all of the wire and cable 
requirements for the project. The major benefits of our cable management 
program include guaranteed availability of materials, plus safety stock; 
immediate shipment of material upon field release; firm pricing and a 
dedicated project manager.
—Houston Wire & Cable Company, 2008 Annual Report
Chapter 3 provides additional examples and details regarding the impact of 
demand uncertainty on companies.
Another component of variability is related to supply, and this also increases 
the level of safety stock that is required. Supply-side variability is introduced 
due to several reasons, including variance in production activities at suppliers’ 
plants, an increase in the time taken to transport material due to load consoli-
dation, an increase in the time taken to clear customs, as well as external fac-
tors such as weather. Examples of reasons contributing to a delayed ­shipment 
are shown in Figure 2-4. 
Figure 2-4.  Examples of factors contributing to shipment delays

Supply lead time compounds the negative effect of variability in two ways. First, 
the forecasting horizon has to be increased to match this lead time, resulting in 
an associated increase in error. Second, inventory positions have to be committed 
to for the duration of the lead time, magnifying the impact of poor decisions.
An increase in lead times can raise the exposure due to unfavorable pricing of 
components for products that undergo high price erosion. Another by-product 
is an increase in work-in-process inventory (inventory that remains in various 
stages of manufacturing or transportation), which increases the cash-to-cash 
cycle time for suppliers. During tough economic conditions, tight cash flow 
situations can adversely affect the viability of small- and mid-sized companies.
Notwithstanding these drawbacks, lead times have steadily increased from the 
mid-1990s thanks largely to the promise of lower labor costs associated with 
outsourced, overseas manufacturing. The following excerpt from an annual 
report of Domino, a supplier of printing products, illustrates this extension 
and variance across products:
Our manufacturing operations benefited in 2010 from the restructuring 
and consolidation undertaken in the prior year. Cost efficiencies coupled 
with volume increases have enabled us to report an increase in gross margin 
rate to just below 50 per cent. This was achieved against a backdrop of 
increasing lead time in supply chains as global demand increased at a 
faster rate than component manufacturing capacity, and increased costs, in 
particular freight charges, as actions were taken to expedite parts supply 
to our factories. Whilst component availability was an issue in particular 
through the second quarter of the year, we were able to utilise buffer stocks 
to avoid any significant impact on supply to our customers. At year end 
the situation was largely back to normal, inventories have been replenished 
and lead times from our suppliers have returned to normal. 
—Domino Printing Sciences plc, 2010 Annual Report
The excerpt emphasizes the importance of the close relationships with sup-
pliers required to remain responsive in the face of increasing lead times. If 
such collaborative measures are not put in place, only a part of the anticipated 
benefit from outsourcing will be realized. Reasons that an increase in lead time 
results in lower flexibility and disruptions include the following:
• 
Reliance on partners for timely execution. The reliance on a 
different company for manufacturing can increase revenue 
risk when capacity is tight and the manufacturer is provided 
other more profitable opportunities to utilize capacity.
• 
Increased possibility of disruptive events. As the horizon for 
procurement and manufacturing increases, the number 
of disruptive events that can affect timely fulfillment also 
increase. Examples of these events include machine failures, 
industry-wide commodity shortages, and weather effects.

Chapter 2 | Inventory Planning
36
• 
More complex processes. Outsourced and off-shore manu-
facturing have introduced several additional steps in the 
delivery process, including ocean freight and customs 
clearance. These additional steps introduce variability 
due to dependence on other companies and governmen-
tal agencies, many more hand-offs, additional regulations, 
and additional paperwork requirements.
Supplier operations introduce variability related to production schedules, 
capacity shortfall, or rework due to poor quality resulting in delayed avail-
ability of goods. These sources of variability can be addressed by implement-
ing appropriate processes for quality control and collaboration of relevant 
demand and capacity information.
In-bound transportation introduces variability related to missed shipment 
windows, unavailability of capacity, and extended wait times in order to con-
solidate loads. These issues can be partly or completely addressed by ensuring 
alignment between production and transportation schedules, and by com-
municating mid- and long-term shipment requirements to transportation 
providers.
Purchasing and information-sharing processes can introduce variability, either 
due to data errors while processing orders, delays in calculating purchas-
ing requirements and communicating these orders to suppliers, or due to 
lumpy orders caused by consolidation and pricing concerns. Data errors can 
be reduced by the use of systems to limit manual inputs. Furthermore, sys-
tems can help with timely processing of purchases and communication of 
orders. Finally, lumpy demand can be eliminated by negotiating price agree-
ments based on quarterly or annual purchasing amounts (as opposed to each 
individual shipments), or by the use of low-cost transportation options for 
small shipments.
Finally, supply variability can be caused by external factors such as inclem-
ent weather, heavy seaport traffic and congestion, or customs delays. While 
little can be done to reduce the variability associated with these factors, 
good ­planning can help mitigate the effects. Table 2-3 lists some examples of 
­variability and management aids to reduce or deal with each.

Safety Stock (Buffer Inventory)
Since a majority of businesses operate in an environment where material is 
produced ahead of firm customer orders (build-to-forecast), there is a wide-
spread need to hold buffer inventory. This buffer inventory is required to fulfill 
higher-than-expected demand as well as a cushion against delayed arrival of 
raw materials. Supply chain professionals have long dealt with buffer inven-
tory, and the most common methods employed to determine these levels are 
the service level model and the newsvendor model. The service level method 
determines inventory levels based on the probability of meeting demand. This 
determination is based solely on the uncertainty that is inherent in demand and 
not on any financial consideration. On the other hand, the newsvendor model 
determines optimal inventory levels according to a trade-off between the 
profit obtained from holding inventory against an estimate of the cost of hold-
ing inventory. Though the newsvendor model is attractive due to its simplicity, 
it makes several assumptions that make it applicable only to products with 
short lifecycles (for example, newspapers—hence the name—or groceries).  
It is therefore necessary to utilize a different model for products that do not 
become obsolete in a short period of time. Such a model, called the incremen-
tal margin model, is introduced toward the end of the section.

The Service Level Method
The service level method estimates the safety inventory in consideration of the 
uncertainty of demand over the lead time for supply (Figure 2-5). Demand 
variability or uncertainty is commonly specified using the variability in demand 
(when replenishment models such as reorder points are used for maintaining 
inventory levels), or by the standard deviation of the forecast error (when 
forecasts and material requirements plans are used to maintain inventory lev-
els). The entire value of uncertainty is determined by multiplying the variance 
in forecast error with the supply lead time since an inventory position needs to 
be taken for the entire duration of the lead time. The model also requires the 
estimation of a service level factor (k), which represents a measure of the prob-
ability of meeting demand directly from on-hand inventory, referred to as the 
service level. The stockout service level is defined as the probability that demand 
can be met from on-hand inventory. The value of k depends on the nature of 
probability distribution that best describes the demand signal. It is common 
to use the normal probability distribution unless the analyst can determine a 
more appropriate distribution. Figure 2-5 lists values of k for various service 
level values. Higher values of k result in higher inventories and service levels.

EXAMPLE 2-1: APPLYING THE SERVICE LEVEL METHOD
Demand (actual sales) and forecast data for a consumer good are shown in Figure 2-6 
for eight months of history. Since the lead time for supply is two months, orders are 
based on the two-month prior forecast. Forecast error is calculated as the difference 
between actual sales and the two-month prior forecast, and the root mean square error 
(RMSE) is calculated to be 2,123 units (i.e., 19% of average monthly sales), as shown 
in Figure 2-6.

where n is the number of observations. If the company desires a service level of 95%, 
the equivalent value of k is 1.65 (from Figure 2-5). From the same figure, the safety 
stock is calculated as

Therefore, the company should hold 4,953 units (approximately 12 days of inventory, 
based on average monthly demand) in order to provide the desired service level. If a 
service level of 99% is desired, then the calculation would result in a safety stock of 
6,994 units (approximately 18 days of inventory).
The popularity of the normal distribution for representing the probability of 
forecast error is not arbitrary. Under certain situations, statistical estimates 
converge to a normal distribution, as outlined by the central limit theorem.1
While it is important to select the appropriate probability function, in real-
ity no single function can accurately represent demand. Therefore, a certain 
amount of error in inventory estimates cannot be avoided, and it is necessary 
to monitor performance and make adjustments when needed. Such a review 
procedure is described in Chapter 5.
In practice, the standard deviation of demand (demand variability) has often 
been used instead of forecast error in the equation. This assumption is accept-
able when demand is steady, uniform, and without seasonal effects. However, 
if seasonality exists and the forecasting method accounts for these effects, the 
use of standard deviation of demand can result in excessively high-inventory 
requirements since demand can fluctuate more than the forecast error, as 
illustrated in Figure 2-7. Therefore, the use of standard deviation of demand 
for calculating inventory requirements is not recommended. 
1For further details and guidelines for the use of other probability functions, see for example 
Athanasios Papoulis, Random Variables and Stochastic Processes (McGraw Hill, 1989).

The Profitable Supply Chain
41
In many practical situations, safety stock is required to cover demand uncer-
tainty as well as supply variability. Supply variability refers to the difference 
between the expected and actual delivery time for raw materials. Since supply 
variability introduces additional uncertainty, additional inventory is required 
to provide the same service level. This additional inventory can be calculated 
by modifying the equation in Figure 2-5 to include a supply variance term, as 
shown in Equation 2-2.

where the first term under the square root symbol is the same as in Figure 2-5, 
and the second term represents the additional inventory requirement due to 
supply variability. d  represents average demand and sS represents the stan-
dard deviation of the differences between the actual and expected supply lead 
times.
The equation assumes that the variabilities in demand and supply are not 
related (i.e., they are independent of each other)—for this assumption allows a 
combined variance to be calculated as the sum of the two individual variances. 
But if the uncertainty in demand is correlated with variability in supply, this cal-
culation is not valid. Instead, the safety stock has to be calculated separately for 
the two terms, as shown in Equation 2-3 for the perfectly correlated case.

deviation of forecast error for calculating safety stocks

Chapter 2 | Inventory Planning
42
The difference between Equation 2-2 and Equation 2-3 is that in the latter the 
variances are not combined and safety stock is computed separately for each. 
Note that the correlated case will always result in a higher inventory level 
than the independent case. When demand and supply uncertainties are not 
perfectly correlated, the required safety stock will be in between these two 
estimates. For formal treatments of covariance and correlation, consult any 
standard statistics textbook.2
It is desirable to use the safety stock calculation for the independent case since 
it results in lower inventories. However, independence requires that produc-
tion capacity (at the company and key suppliers’ manufacturing plants) be far 
greater than any unanticipated increase or decrease in demand. This condition 
is often not true for dedicated production lines and manufacture of custom 
parts since production capacity is usually set based on an expected value of 
demand. In such cases, higher-than-expected demand will result in tight capac-
ity and a corresponding increase in production lead time. Therefore, unless it 
is possible to determine that supplies for all assemblies and parts for a prod-
uct are independent of demand, it is recommended that the second method 
(covariance) be used for calculating safety stock. Similarly, transportation 
lead time variances may need to be considered as correlated if the company 
expects a significant company-wide increase in demand or the entire industry 
is experiencing an increase; in such cases, the transportation providers may 
face a similar shortage of transportation capacity, and lead times will increase 
as it takes longer to find free ocean containers or trucks.
EXAMPLE 2-2: APPLYING THE SERVICE LEVEL 
METHOD FOR DEMAND UNCERTAINTY AND SUPPLY 
VARIABILITY
For the data given in Example 2-1, the time taken to receive goods has been noted 
to differ from the expected lead time of one month. Data is collected for eight months 
of history and is shown in Figure  2-8. The average lead time is calculated to be  
37 days and supply variability (as measured by the root mean square error, where error 
is the difference between actual and expected lead time) is calculated to be 8 days. The 
spreadsheet formulas for the calculation are shown in the respective cells.
2See, for example, Erwin Kreyzig, Advanced Engineering Mathematics (John Wiley, 2005).

The Profitable Supply Chain
43
With this information, safety stock requirements can be calculated based on demand 
and supply variability. Since the supply lead time variability is in days, the daily average 
demand needs to be used for units to be consistent. The calculation is
Average daily demand = 11,438 / 30 = 381 units.
If demand and supply variability are assumed to be independent, then the calculation 
for a 95% service level is

Therefore, safety stock levels have increased from 4,953 (Example 2-1) to 7,059 units 
due to supply variability. This translates to an additional 6 days of inventory, resulting 
in a total of 18 days. If the analyst perceives that the supplier’s production capacity is 
tight and that any increase in demand will be accompanied by delays in supplies, then 
perfect correlation results in the following calculation of safety stock by Equation 2-3:

,982 units.
The results reveal that covariance has resulted in an additional 2,923 units, or 8 days 
of inventory, for a total of 26 days. Depending on the cash positions of the company, the 
analyst can select a safety stock level between the two values—18 days if the available 
budgets are tight and 26 days if customer service and material availability are the 
priority.
An advantage of separating inventory requirements for demand and supply 
variability is that the magnitude and improvement areas are apparent. For 
example, if most of the safety stock requirement is to cover for uncertainty in 
demand, then the areas requiring improvement are forecasting and collabora-
tion with channel partners. On the other hand, if supply variability has a large 
impact, then areas to focus on include capacity alignment and collaboration 
with key suppliers.
In conclusion, the service level method is simple to use and provides an impor-
tant connection between inventory level and customer service. On the other 
hand, this method suffers from the following limitations:
No guidance is provided regarding the optimal service 
• 
level for an item. For example, is a 95% service level 
excessively high? Intuitively, it would appear that a higher 
service level should be provided for a high margin item, as 
compared to an item with a lower margin. However, the 
service level method provides no guidance regarding how 
service levels should be tailored by item.
No guidance is provided regarding the price required to 
• 
provide a service level to a customer, because costs, mar-
gins, and price are not included in the formulation. 
Addressing these questions requires that the financial aspects related to inven-
tory be included in the model. A simple method for performing this analysis is 
the newsvendor model, described next.

The Profitable Supply Chain
45
The Newsvendor Model
The newsvendor model can be readily understood from the following statement 
of the problem. Consider a newsvendor who needs to determine the quantity 
of newspapers that needs to be purchased for each day. If demand is greater 
than the purchased quantity, then the benefit (margin) from that additional 
demand is lost. On the other hand, if the purchased quantity is greater than 
demand, then the leftover newspapers are not sold and are disposed of the 
following day as scrap. Given that the demand on any given day is not specified 
(it varies randomly), how should the optimal inventory be determined?
The model is based on balancing two costs: the shortage cost and obsolescence 
cost (also referred to as the scrap cost), defined as follows:
The 
• 
shortage cost (cS) is the penalty for not meeting 
demand. This cost depends on the sales model of the 
company and, in business-to-business cases, on customer 
obligations and contracts. For example, the shortage cost 
for a retailer is the margin that is lost due to inventory not 
being available. For a food manufacturer shipping goods 
to a retailer, the shortage cost could be a financial penalty 
for each order that is not shipped in its entirety (ship-
complete). In addition to penalties, shortage costs can also 
include expedite costs related to rush transportation, 
such as air shipments vs. ocean, or less-than-truckload 
shipments vs. full truckloads.
The 
• 
obsolescence cost (co) is the penalty due to inventory 
that is not sold. It is calculated as the difference between 
the cost of procuring or producing the item and the sal-
vage price that can be obtained for the leftover inventory 
(i.e., unit cost minus salvage price). Note that the news-
vendor model is a single-period model, and it requires 
that the salvage price be lower than the unit cost. If this 
is not the case, a multi-period model needs to be utilized. 
(One such model is developed in the following section.)
The important aspect of the newsvendor model is that it explicitly consid-
ers demand to be a random variable, characterized by an expected value and 
a forecast error. The derivation of the model is shown in Figure 2-9. In the 
figure, the first equation lists the profit function as the margin obtained from 
sales minus two cost terms. The first term is due to holding excess inventory, 
calculated as the unit obsolescence cost multiplied by excess inventory. The 
second term is due to inventory shortage, calculated as the unit shortage 
cost multiplied by the number of units of demand that cannot be met from 
on-hand inventory. Because demand is random, it is necessary to calculate 
an expected value of the cost incurred by assuming a particular probability 

Chapter 2 | Inventory Planning
46
function for demand. In the derivation shown, a normal probability function 
has been used to specify demand, which uses a bell curve to determine the 
probability that demand will be greater or less than the expected value. With 
this assumption, the optimal level of supply is determined by differentiating the 
profit function with respect to the level of supply s, and setting that expres-
sion to zero. This results in the following formula for determining the optimal 
service level and supply:

Equation 2-2. The term F s d

s  is the cumulative probability function, 
calculated in Microsoft Excel by the formula NORMDIST ( s d, ,s , true). It 
represents the optimal service level because it captures the probability of 
meeting demand. The cost ratio in Equation 2-4 is sometimes referred to as 
the critical fractile.
The newsvendor model is useful for estimating supply targets over a single 
month, quarter, or other period of a supply contract, as long as price and costs 
are constant throughout the period. Another assumption made by the model 
is that the product needs to be disposed at a scrap value at the end of the 
period. While these assumptions do limit the number of situations that the 
model can be applied to, the fundamental insights provided by the model are 
still very useful. Therefore, this model will be studied in depth in the follow-
ing pages preliminary to the development of a model that is applicable to a 
broader variety of situations.
Newsvendor Model Applied to a Retail Situation
The situation considered in Example 2-3 is a perishable product stocked on 
the retail shelf, such that any demand that is in excess of the inventory on the 
retail shelf is lost. Because retail products are replenished on a frequent basis 
(typically one to two times per week), it is possible to apply the newsvendor 
model to products for which the lifespan is aligned with the replenishment 
schedule.
EXAMPLE 2-3: APPLICATION OF THE NEWSVENDOR 
MODEL TO A PERISHABLE GROCERY PRODUCT
An expected weekly demand for a grocery item is 10,000 lbs, with a forecast error of 
20%. Inventory is replenished on a weekly basis. The item is purchased for $1.50 per 
pound and sold for $2.50 per pound. The product lifespan is approximately one week, 
and any leftover inventory is thrown away.
Determining the Optimal Inventory Level
Because leftover inventory has no value, the obsolescence cost is the purchase price, 
$1.50 per pound. The company incurs no penalty for insufficient inventory. Therefore, 
the optimal service level is calculated from Equation 2-3 as

The model dictates an optimal service level of 40%. For expected demand of 10,000 lbs  
and forecast error of 2,000 lbs (= 20%*10,000), the optimal order quantity can be 
determined from the following spreadsheet function:
s=NORMINV(Optimal service level, Forecast, Forecast error)
=NORMINV(0.4,10000,2000)
=9,493 lbs.
Therefore, the model dictates that the company should order 9,493 lbs every week. 
Note that this quantity is less than the expected demand, due to the high obsolescence 
costs.
It is possible to build upon the model and compute other useful measures.

The unit margin is a useful measurement for comparing against target margins 
and providing guidance regarding prices.
Continuing the retail example, the following are computed:
     Optimal service level = 0.40.
     Optimal supply level = 9,493 lbs.
     Expected lost sales = 1,076 lbs (from Eq. 2-5).
     Expected sales = (10,000 – 1,076) = 8,923 lbs (from Eq. 2-6).
     Expected fill rate = 8,923/10,000 = 89% (from Eq. 2-7).
     Expected leftover inventory = 570 lbs (from Eq. 2-8).
     Expected obsolescence cost = $855 (from Eq. 2-9).
     Expected shortage cost = $0 (from Eq. 2-10).
     Expected revenue = expected sales * price = 8,923 * 2.50 = $22,307.50.
     Expected gross profit = $8,068 (from Eq. 2-11).
     Expected unit margin = $0.85 per lb. (from Eq. 2-12).

Chapter 2 | Inventory Planning
50
Therefore, the gross margin that the company can expect is $0.15 less than 
the targeted margin of $1 per lb. If the company wishes to achieve a margin of 
$1, the price would need to be changed to $2.66 per lb.
Consider another situation: The company’s management is not comfortable 
with such a low service level because of stockout concerns and concern that 
customers may be driven to other stores with better inventory positions. 
Instead, a target service level of 90% is desired. This service level results in 
the following: 
     Service level target = 0.90.
     Required supply level = NORMINV(.90, 10,000, 2,000) = 12,563 lbs.
     Expected lost sales = 95 lbs.
     Expected sales = 9,905 lbs.
     Expected fill rate = 9,905/10,000 = 99%.
     Expected leftover inventory = 2,658 lbs.
     Expected obsolescence cost = $3,986.
     Expected shortage cost = $0.
     Expected gross profit = $5,919.
     Expected gross margin per unit = $0.47 per lb.
Therefore, the higher service level has resulted in significant margin erosion 
due to the increase in scrap inventory. If the company wishes to retain its mar-
gin of $1 per lb, then the price would need to be increased to $3.17 per lb.
The model can be used for several other analyses, such as analyzing the impact 
of variability on margins. Figure 2-10 illustrates how an increase in variability 
results in margin erosion. By quantifying the impact, management can decide 
whether to invest in systems or new procedures to reduce forecast error.

The Profitable Supply Chain

The example in Figure 2-10 illustrates the usefulness of the newsvendor model 
in considering variability and costs in order to provide guidance regarding sup-
plies, service levels, and prices for a given retail situations. 
Newsvendor Model Applied to a Strategic Buy Situation
In this section, the newsvendor model is applied to a business-to-business 
situation involving a strategic purchase. Unlike the retail situation, the com-
pany can meet unmet demand by increasing production but incurs thereby a 
shortage penalty.
A company sells its goods through retail channels and needs to place a pro-
duction order with its contract manufacturer for purchasing a certain quantity 
of the product line for an entire season. While the company can estimate the 
expected demand, it is subject to significant error since the order has to be 
placed well in advance of sales. If demand is greater than the quantity ordered, 
then the company is allowed to order additional volume, but the contract 
manufacturer will tack on an additional cost to cover its expenses related 
to additional raw material purchases or due to overtime labor. Conversely, 
if demand is less than quantity ordered, then the company will be left with 
unsold inventory at the end of the season; this inventory can be disposed, but 
at a steeply discounted rate.
The company needs to decide what order quantity it needs to place with the 
contract manufacturer.

The newsvendor model can be used to answer this question. The model 
requires the following quantities to be determined:
• 
The expected demand (i.e., forecast) for the entire season. 
This quantity can be determined based on sales of the 
same or similar products for the prior year, adjusted for 
market conditions.
• 
The error associated with the forecast so determined. This 
quantity can be calculated by comparing the forecasts for 
prior seasons compared to actual sales.
• 
The obsolescence cost for excess inventory. Since leftover 
inventory at the end of the season has to be disposed at 
a lower price, the obsolescence cost is the purchase cost 
less salvage value.
• 
The shortage cost for unmet demand. This is the additional 
cost charged by the contract manufacturer for units in 
excess of the contracted quantity.
Once these quantities have been determined, the profit equation for this  
flexible production policy can be written as

Equation 2-13 is developed for the case when sales in excess of supply are not 
lost since the option of increasing production is available (the model assumes 
that sufficient lead times exist to increase production and satisfy retail orders). 
Therefore, this profit equation is different from Equation 2-9, which is devel-
oped for the case when sales in excess of supply are lost. Following the pro-
cedure in Equation 2-9 for maximizing profits, the optimal service level is 
calculated as

EXAMPLE 2-4: APPLICATION OF THE NEWSVENDOR 
MODEL TO DETERMINE SEASONAL PURCHASE 
QUANTITIES
An apparel design company has created a line of products for the winter season 
spanning November through March. The company uses a contract manufacturer for 
production, and is required to place the order by June in order to receive shipments 
by November. The company estimates the demand for the product line to be  
150,000 units, and the forecast error (RMSE) is estimated to be 20%. The purchase 
cost is $15 per piece. The company desires a $10 margin and set the price at $25 
accordingly. Any unsold inventory can be disposed at $10 per piece. Finally, any 
production in  addition to the contracted amount will be satisfied with an incremental 
cost of $3 per piece to cover any additional costs incurred by the manufacturer.
Determining the Optimal Service Level and Order Quantity
The shortage cost is $3 per piece, while the obsolescence cost is $5 (= purchase cost – 
salvage price = $15 - $10). From Eq.  2-14, the optimal service level is calculated as

The model dictates an optimal service level of 38%. For expected demand of 150,000

determined from the following spreadsheet function:

Therefore, the model dictates that the company should place an order for 140,441 units 
with the contract manufacturer. If demand is higher than this level, then additional orders 
can be placed with the contract manufacturer.  

Chapter 2 | Inventory Planning
54
As with the previous case, additional measurements can be generated using 
the model. This situation differs from the previously described retail situation 
in that demand in excess of inventory is not lost, because the apparel company 
has the option of increasing production, such that
	
                Expected lost sales = 0 	
  (2-15)

(2-17)
The expected leftover inventory, obsolescence cost, shortage costs, and gross 
profit are calculated as in the previous case (Equations 2-8 through 2-11). The 
unit margin is calculated according to Equation 2-18: 
Expected unit gross margin
=Expected gross profit/Total supply
=Exppected gross profit/(Initial supply+Additional production)
(2-18)

The Profitable Supply Chain
55
Continuing Example 2-4, the following fields are computed:
     Target service level: 38%.
     Expected additional production = 17,350 (from Eq. 2-16).
     Expected leftover inventory = 140,441 – 150,000 + 17,350 = 7,791.
     Expected obsolescence cost = $5 * 7,791 = $38,956.
     Expected shortage cost = $3 * 17,350 = $52,051.
     Expected profit = $10*150,000 - $38,956 - $52,051 = $1,408,993.
     Expected gross margin per unit = $1,408,993 / (140,441 + 17,350) = $8.93.
Therefore, the model indicates that the margin that can be expected is less 
than the anticipated margin of $10, and price would have to be increased by 
approximately $1.07 to compensate for obsolescence and shortage costs that 
may be incurred. 
The newsvendor model also provides insight into the impact of supply uncer-
tainty. Due to supply variability, a greater level of supply is required to provide 
the same service level. However, when supply is in excess of the optimal value, 
the expected margin will decrease, per the newsvendor model. This calcula-
tion is shown in Figure 2-11 with the negative impact of supply variability 
being dictated by the magnitude of obsolescence cost.
Figure 2-11.  Impact of supply variability on margins

Chapter 2 | Inventory Planning
56
The examples above illustrate the usefulness of the newsvendor model and 
how it can be used to provide guidance regarding prices, profits, and policies. 
There is, however, a significant drawback to this model: it is a single-period 
model, with any leftover inventory at the end of the period being disposed at 
a scrap value. (The period for inventory calculation purposes is the replen-
ishment frequency, which can range from daily when suppliers are local to 
monthly for overseas shipments.) Because most products have lifecycles 
that can last several months or even years, the single-period assumption is a 
severe limitation since these products can continue to be sold beyond a single 
replenishment period. Also, due to this single-period applicability, situations 
involving variations in price, costs, and demand over time cannot be accom-
modated. The first requirement of a generalized inventory model is the ability 
to accommodate multiple time-periods. The incremental margin model is one 
such method. 
The Incremental Margin Model
The incremental margin model extends the newsvendor model to multiple peri-
ods. In addition to the costs included in the newsvendor model, a multi-period 
inventory planning model needs to include another penalty—the holding cost. 
This is the penalty for holding inventory for a certain period of time and 
includes the cost of storage, insurance, and spoilage. Costs that are already 
present in the cost-of-goods calculation (for raw materials, production, han-
dling, and transportation) should not be included. Only those costs that are 
incurred due to inventory being held for a certain period of time should be 
included.
A multi-period inventory planning model needs to provide the following 
capabilities:
Allow for inventory that is left over at the end of one 
• 
period to be sold in the following period.
Allow for the expected demand and forecast error to 
• 
vary across periods.
Allow for the shortage cost, holding cost, and price to 
• 
vary across periods.
Allow the product to be sold at a salvage value at the end 
• 
of any period.

The Profitable Supply Chain
57
The multi-period model developed in this section is referred to as the incre-
mental margin model, since costs and margins are incrementally calculated for 
each period. The  gross profit from s units of supply is calculated by subtract-
ing shortage, holding, and obsolescence costs from the total margin. For the 
situation in which prices and material costs are uniform across the periods, 
this is calculated according to:

where n represents the number of periods corresponding to the shelf-life of 
the item. Each of the terms in the equation is explained as follows:
The first cost term is the shortage cost, as explained for 
• 
the newsvendor model. It represents the penalty incurred 
in case shipments are not made in a timely manner, or the 
cost of expediting to meet demand on time.
The subsequent cost terms are the holding costs incurred 
• 
by holding inventory for the first and subsequent periods. 
Note that this holding cost is a period cost and includes 
the cost of capital. This cost is different from the obsoles-
cence cost term in the newsvendor model.
The final cost term is the loss due to obsolescence for 
• 
the case when the product has a shelf-life of n periods. 
Since the first term includes margin from the entire s 
units of supply, the margin lost due to obsolete inventory 
needs to be deducted. Also, if obsolete inventory can be 
disposed for a price (the salvage price), then the result-
ing return is calculated by multiplying the salvage benefit 
with the leftover inventory. The salvage benefit is calcu-
lated as the difference between the salvage price and the  
unit cost.
The expected profit per period is calculated according to Equation 2-20:
Expected unit gross margin=Expected unit margin*Expected sales
Expected revenue=Price*Expected sales
  (2-20)

Chapter 2 | Inventory Planning
58
where the expected unit margin is calculated by Equation 2-19. The expected 
sales depends on the sales situation and demand retention policy adopted by 
the company. If unmet sales are lost (as in retail situations or when a com-
pany chooses not to expedite or offer incentives to the customer to retain 
demand), then the expected sales are given by Equation 2-6. On the other 
hand, if unmet demand can be retained or backlogged, then lost sales is zero 
and the expected sales equals the expected demand.
Appendix B presents a detailed development of the incremental margin model 
and the methods needed to perform the computations using spreadsheet 
functions. An application of the model is given in Example 2-5.
EXAMPLE 2-5: APPLYING THE INCREMENTAL  
MARGIN MODEL
Consider the grocery item in Example 2-3 with a shelf-life of 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, the 
product has no value and is disposed. Demand, costs, and price remain uniform across 
the 2 weeks. The holding cost is estimated to be $0.01 per lb per week and includes the 
cost of capital and other inventory-related costs.
Determining the Optimal Inventory Level
The optimal supply is determined by plugging in different values for s into Equation 2-19  
until the gross margin is maximized to arrive at value of 14,100 lbs. Recall that the optimal 
supply in Example 2-3 for the 1 week shelf-life was 9,493 lbs. Therefore, increasing the 
shelf-life from 1 to 2 weeks results in a significant increase in the optimal order quantity. 
The following fields can be computed:
     Optimal supply = 14,300 lbs.
     Service level target = 98%.
     Expected lost sales = 15 lbs (from Eq.  2-5).
     Expected sales = (10,000 – 15) = 9,983 lbs (from Eq. 2-6).
     Expected fill rate = 9,983/10,000 = 99.9% (from Eq. 2-7).
     Expected leftover inventory = 4,155 lbs (from Eq. 2-8).
     Expected unit margin = $0.993 per lb. (from Eq.  2-19).
     Expected gross profit = $9,912 (from Eq.  2-20).
The expected gross margin for various supply levels is shown in Table  2-4 and  
Figure 2-12. High values of lost sales cause the steep decrease in margins toward the 
left, while the gradual decrease in margins after 13,800 units is due to a comparably 
lower penalty associated with holding costs. After approximately 15,000 units, margins 
decrease rapidly due to the increased probability of scrap inventory.

Figure 2-12.  Using the incremental margin model to calculate expected margins
Recall that the expected unit margin for 1 week of shelf-life (Example 2-3) was $0.85/lb.  
The increase in shelf-life from 1 to 2 weeks has increased the expected margin 
significantly due to the reduced penalty from scrap. The impact of shelf-life on optimal 
supplies and margins is shown in Table 2-4.
As expected, the increase to 3 weeks has a large impact on optimal supplies. However, 
the additional increase to 4 weeks has minimal impact since the probability of obsolete 
inventory is minimal (due to low demand variability).

Chapter 2 | Inventory Planning
60
This multi-period inventory model can be used to understand the impact of 
shelf-life on optimal supplies and margins. The flexibility provided to model 
lifecycle demand and end-of-life scrap loss is very useful for industries such 
as grocery, pharmaceuticals, and electronics. Consider the following excerpt 
from an annual report of Regeneron, a biotechnology company: 
Cost of goods sold increased to $118.0 million in 2013 from  
$83.9 million in 2012 due primarily to increased sales of EYLEA. In 
addition, in 2013 and 2012 , cost of goods sold included inventory write-
downs and reserves totaling $9.1 million and $17.0 million, respectively. 
We record a charge to cost of goods sold to write down our inventory to 
its estimated realizable value if certain batches or units of product do not 
meet quality specifications or are expected to expire prior to sale.
—2014 Annual Report, Regeneron
Increasingly, other industries are being similarly impacted, partly due to fast-
changing customer preferences and the increasing presence of embedded 
electronics in consumer products.
In conclusion, the incremental margin model provides an important extension 
of the newsvendor model to multiple periods and time-varying prices and 
demand. The flexibility of this model allows for several business situations to 
be analyzed, such as price rebates, end-of-life ordering, and cash budgeting. 
The remaining sections of the chapter cover such topics.
Batch Inventory
Batching refers to the production, purchasing, or transportation of material 
in certain lot sizes, potentially resulting in inventory in excess of the target. 
Batching is performed primarily to reduce costs—to take advantage of quan-
tity discounts offered by suppliers, minimizing unit transportation costs by 
shipping full truck or container loads, and minimizing setup-related costs in 
manufacturing. The most common method for determining batch sizes is the 
economic order quantity (EOQ) model, which considers the following costs:
Manufacturing setup, transportation, or purchase-order-
• 
ing costs, calculated as a fixed cost incurred for each 
order.
Holding cost, including the cost of money, warehousing, 
• 
and other inventory related costs. This cost is calculated 
based on the average inventory levels, calculated as Order 
Quantity/2. (See Chapter 4 for a detailed description of 
holding costs.)

The Profitable Supply Chain
61
The derivation of the model is shown in Figure 2-13. Example 2-6 illustrates 
the use of the EOQ model for a single product.
Figure 2-13. The economic order quantity (EOQ) model
EXAMPLE 2-6: APPLYING THE EOQ MODEL TO A 
PRODUCTION SITUATION
A food item manufacturer estimates that the time taken to prepare the production line 
for a particular item is 30 minutes. The daily output of the line (based on an eight-hour 
shift) is $500,000. The monthly demand for the item is 250,000 units, and the holding 
cost is estimated to be $0.25 per unit per month. The manufacturer wishes to determine 
the economic quantity for production.

Chapter 2 | Inventory Planning
62
Calculating the Economic Production Batch Size
The average output for 30 minutes is calculated as ($500,000/16) = $31,250. Since 
this output is lost while preparing the production line, this is set equal to the setup cost. 
Applying the equation shown in Figure 2-13 yields the result,

Therefore, the economic production quantity is equal to the monthly demand. The 
number of setups, calculated as (Demand/EOQ), is 1. Therefore, the EOQ model 
dictates that production needs to occur only once at the beginning of the month, and 
that the inventory be stocked for that entire duration.
In addition to the constant demand assumption, the EOQ model assumes 
that demand is known with certainty. Since most companies deal with uncer-
tain demand, the guidance provided by the EOQ model will be suboptimal in 
the form of excess inventory and holding costs or insufficient inventory and 
shortage costs. Therefore, in most situations, the EOQ model needs to be 
used in conjunction with the safety stock models discussed in the previous 
section: the service level, newsvendor, and incremental margin models. The 
safety stock models need to be used first to determine the optimal supply 
quantity, which becomes the input for the EOQ model (as the demand) and is 
substituted in the equation to calculate batch or lot sizes. 
Inventory Budgeting
Since inventory of raw materials and finished goods may be needed several 
weeks or even months in advance of sales, companies need to invest cash in 
order to purchase and manufacture inventory. This invested cash is eventually 
recovered when the product is sold at a profit. The use of cash for purchasing 
and storing inventory is one of the most important business decisions for a 
company since it has an impact on margins, cash flow, and viability. Consider 
the following excerpt from an annual report of STEC, Inc., an electronics 
manufacturer, on the impact of inventory investment on profits:
Interest income and other is comprised primarily of interest income from 
our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income and 
other decreased from $3.8 million in 2007 to $1.3 million in 2008 as a 
result of a lower average cash balance in 2008 compared to 2007 and 
a reduction in interest rates in 2008. The reduction in the average cash 
balance was due primarily to use of cash for inventory purchases related 
to new SSD product sales in 2008.
—2008 Annual Report, STEC, Inc.

The Profitable Supply Chain
63
The need to tie up cash for inventory is unavoidable for most companies. 
However, when inventory does not move quickly, this cash is tied up for an 
extended period of time and poses two issues. First, the interest generated 
from the cash value is lost for the entire duration. Second, generally accepted 
accounting principles require that inventory that has not moved for a certain 
period of time (say, six months) be declared obsolete, in which case the entire 
cash investment is lost.
There are two aspects regarding inventory budgeting. The first is to deter-
mine the required budget, based on determining the required cash followed 
by a return-on-inventory analysis. The second is to manage to these budgets 
and allocate cash when variances occur. The first aspect is discussed here; the 
second aspect is further described in Chapter 5.
Inventory budgets are usually specified for an item group or all items in a facil-
ity. The rigorous procedure outlined here is recommended, along with steps 
to rationalize the product portfolio to weed out underperforming products. 
The steps for determining inventory budgets are as follows:
Step 1: Plot the supply network for the products to 
understand lead times and the value-add at each step.
Step 2: Calculate the inventory investment required for 
each stage of the supply chain. Sum across all products 
to obtain the required inventory investment.
Step 3: Calculate inventory metrics—days of inventory, 
turns, and GMROI for future budget adjustments and 
allocations.
These steps are illustrated in Example 2-7.
EXAMPLE 2-7: DETERMINING INVENTORY BUDGETS 
FOR AN ELECTRONICS MANUFACTURER
ABC Co. has budgeted $360,000 for its product line inventory. The anticipated demand 
is 10,000 units per month, the product is priced at an average of $20 per unit, and the 
unit cost is $12 per unit. Is this budget for 3 months of inventory sufficient for supporting 
operations and providing the targeted customer service?
Step 1: Plot the Supply Network
A sample depiction of the supply network is shown in Figure 2-14. For each stage in 
the supply chain, the following information is captured: inventory ownership, cost of 
inventory or value-add, lead times, and billing terms. In this example, ABC Co. purchases 
raw materials directly from the supplier and stocks the raw material at the contract 
manufacturer’s facility. The cost of production is primarily labor. ABC Co. is responsible 
for the shipping process and receives materials into inventory at its distribution centers. 

Chapter 2 | Inventory Planning
64
Figure 2-14.  Sample lead times and contractual terms for Example 2-7
Step 2: Calculate Inventory Investment Required for Each Stage 
of Supply Chain
The investment is calculated as a combination of cycle stock, safety stock, and work-
in-process for raw materials, intermediate (or assemblies), and finished goods. Each of 
the stages is described below.

The Profitable Supply Chain
65
Raw Materials at the Contract Manufacturer
Since ABC Co. purchases raw materials directly from the supplier and takes ownership 
of the inventory, the inventory investment is calculated as
Raw material inventory investment
Raw material price*Inventory l
=
iability window (months)
*Expected monthly demand
 (2-21)
where the inventory liability window is the time during which the company takes 
ownership of inventory, and is calculated as
Inventory liability window
= Maximum onhand inventory+Receivables terms-Payables terms  (2-22)
All the terms need to be expressed in the same time units (e.g., months). Since the 
raw material shipment schedule is weekly, the maximum cycle inventory is 7 days. The 
target safety stock is 1 month. Therefore, the maximum on-hand inventory is 37 days 
and the raw material inventory liability window is (37 – 30) = 7 days.
In this example, WIP inventory during the production process at the contract manufacturer 
also requires raw material for the duration of the lead time of 30 days. Therefore, this 
is added to the inventory liability window, resulting in a total value of (7 + 30) = 37 days 
= 1.23 month.
The raw material investment is calculated from Equation  2-21 as
Raw material inventory investment
     = Raw material price ($5) * Inventory liability window (1.23 months)
        * Expected monthly demand (10,000)
     = $61,500. 
Finished Goods Inventory
The finished goods inventory, priced at $10 per unit ($5 for raw material and $5 for labor) 
are in ABC Co.’s possession for the entire duration of the ocean shipment of 6 weeks. 
Therefore the inventory investment required is
Finished goods inventory investment
     = Finished good ($10) * Inventory liability window (1.5 months)
          * Expected monthly demand (10,000)
     =$150,000.

Chapter 2 | Inventory Planning
66
Product Inventory at Distribution Center
The ocean carrier bills ABC Co. only after goods have been recovered; since the 
payment terms are Net 30, the liability window is -1 month. The maximum on-hand 
inventory is 1 month for cycle inventory plus 1 month for safety stock plus 1 month for 
receivables. Therefore, the liability window is (-1 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 2 months. The inventory 
budget requirement is calculated as
Product inventory investment
     = Product at distribution center price ($12) * Inventory liability window (2 months)
          * Expected monthly demand (10,000)
     = $240,000.
The total inventory investment required is calculated by adding the investment for all 
the stages:
Inventory investment required
     = Raw material inventory investment + Finished goods inventory investment
          + Product inventory investment
     = $61,500 + $150,000 + $240,000
     = $451,500.
Therefore, the current inventory budget of $360,000 is inadequate for maintaining 
adequate inventories and service levels for the supply chain.
The cash-to-cash cycle time is calculated as the days of inventory for the various 
stages plus the days receivables outstanding minus the days payables outstanding  
(Equation 2-23):
	
Cash-to-cash cycle time
=Days of inventory+Days payable outstandinng
Days receivables outstanding
-
	
(2-23)
The cash-to-cash cycle time is equivalent to the addition of the liability windows for 
all the stages in the supply chain. In the example above, this would have resulted in 
1.23 months for raw materials added to 1.5 months for finished goods and 2 months 
for products at the distribution, resulting in a cash-to-cash cycle time of 4.73 months. 
However, this measurement is not an accurate representation of the duration for which 
cash is tied up since the inventory investment is different for the different stages of the 

The Profitable Supply Chain
67
supply chain (for example, raw material inventory is priced lower than the product). 
Therefore, it is necessary to define a new measure of the liability, called the effective 
liability window, which is based on product costs,
Effective liability window (months)
=Inventory investment / (Expectedmonthly demand *Product cost)
 (2-24)
For the example above, the effective liability window is calculated as
          Effective liability window = $451,500/($10,000 * $12) = 3.76 months.
This value is lower than the previously calculated value of 4.73 months. The effective 
liability window is a more accurate representation of the true cash-to-cash cycle time 
and is a useful measure for product comparisons. 
Inventory turns is yet another measure that is used to measure inventory 
investment and performance. Turns are calculated as
Inventory turns = Cost of goods sold/Average value of inventory   (2-25)
In the example, the expected sales are 10,000 unit per month, resulting in 
an annual cost of goods of (10,000 * $12/unit * 12 months) = $1,440,000. 
The average inventory is calculated as ($55,000 + $150,000 + $180,000) = 
$385,000, resulting in a computation of 3.7 turns.
None of these measurements—days of inventory, liability window, cash-to-
cash cycle time, or inventory turns—is effective in conveying the benefit from 
holding inventory to the company. For example, it is difficult to respond to 
the question, “Are 3.7 turns too low? Should we increase turns? If so, what is 
the right value?” If safety stocks have been computed using the optimization 
procedures described previously, then these values can be assumed to be 
“right” for the supply chain. However, are other factors—such as manufactur-
ing lead time, raw material commitments, and ocean transit time—resulting 
in an investment that does not provide an adequate return for the company? 
This question can be answered by computing the GMROI as
	
Expected GMROI = Expected annual gross margin
Inventory investment
	
(2-26)

Chapter 2 | Inventory Planning
68
Therefore, the GMROI is a return-on-asset measurement for only the inven-
tory investment. The expected gross margin is provided by the newsvendor 
model (Equation 2-13). The calculation procedure is as follows:
Continuation of Example 2-7 to describe the GMROI calculation.
The following additional data is collected for the products:
          Expected monthly demand: 10,000 units.
          Forecast error: 30%.
          Expedite cost: $5 per unit.
          Holding cost: $0.25 per month.
          The product does not have a shelf-life.
From Equation 2-14, the optimal service level is calculated to be approximately 
95%, and the optimal supply is (10,000 + 1.65*0.3*10,000) = 14,950 units. If 
it is possible to expedite inventory in order to satisfy demand in excess of 
inventory, then there is no lost demand. The expected sales per month = 
(10,000 * $20/unit) = $200,000; the expected expedited units is 59 units (from 
Equation 2-5); the cost of expediting is $5*59 = $296; the expected leftover 
inventory from Equation 2-8 is (14,950 - 10,000 - 50) = 5,009 units; and the 
holding cost is $0.25*5,009 = $1,252. Therefore, the expected gross profit is 
($80,000 - $296 - $1,252) = $78,452. 
From Equation 2-26, the GMROI is calculated to be
          GMROI = (12 months * $78,452)/$451,500 = 2.08.
The GMROI of 2.08 indicates that $1 invested in inventory provides a return 
of $2.08 in one year.
The GMROI is a useful measure for gauging the efficiency of the supply chain in 
providing a return on the inventory asset. Note that this measure should not 
be confused with return on assets (ROA), which is a balance sheet measure that 
gauges the company’s ability to provide a return on all the company’s assets. 
The GMROI is a measurement of only the gross margin and inventory invest-
ment; any other charges that affect margin as well as investments required 
to operate the supply chain have not been included in this measurement. 
Therefore, while a low GMROI is an indicator of low ROA, a high GMROI by 
itself does not indicate a high ROA. (See Chapter 7 for additional discussions 
related to GMROI and other measures required to gauge the performance of 
the supply chain.)

Special Inventory Situations
The concepts presented in the previous sections were in the context of sim-
ple supply situations involving a single location and finished goods inventory. 
In reality, additional complexities can arise due to the myriad variations that 
are possible while creating the supply network and negotiating contracts with 
partners. A few such situations are described in the following sections.
Multiple Transportation Modes
The availability of multiple transportation modes allows for companies to uti-
lize cost-effective options when time is available to meet demand, and more 
expensive expedite options when inventory levels are low. However, this same 
availability complicates the inventory decision, especially when the modes 
have widely differing batch sizes and costs. For example, an ocean container 
provides a low unit cost, but requires large quantities and longer transporta-
tion times. On the contrary, air shipments are faster and fewer units can be 
transported, but at a higher unit cost. Since goods are often transported based 
on a demand forecast, the cost trade-off between the different modes, hold-
ing costs, and margins is not trivial. A commonly employed strategy is to ship 
a bulk of the goods using the slower, lesser expensive mode, but to retain a 
minimal level of inventory close to the manufacturing location. Because not 
all the inventory is committed to the slower mode, it is possible to accom-
modate profitable rush orders if inventory situations become tight.
Yet another important situation arises for lifecycle products, as in the elec-
tronics and telecommunications industries. The products are characterized 
by demand volumes, prices, and forecast accuracy that vary considerably 
over the life of the product. It is common to segment the lifecycle of such 
products into phase. The first phase, product introduction, is characterized 
by high uncertainty in demand since the market acceptance for new products 
is unknown. At the same time, since the technology is new, it is possible to 
command a premium price and corresponding high margins as the company 
targets early adopters. Therefore, the inventory strategy is to maximize fill 
rates, resorting to air shipments if necessary to maintain target inventory lev-
els. The second phase, product maturity, is characterized by steadier demand 
and predictability, a possible decrease in price as the novelty of the technology 
has worn off and the company is targeting the technology followers. In this 
phase, the strategy is to carefully manage inventories and costs to maximize 
margins. Use of air shipments is reserved for only firm orders, to ensure that 
inventory holding costs do not accrue. The final stage, product phase-out, 
happens when the market anticipates the next technology revision from the 
company. Demand rapidly drops off, and uncertainty is high related to the 
extent and speed with which it decreases. The company may have to reduce 
prices in order to spur demand, which increases margin pressures. There is a  

Chapter 2 | Inventory Planning
70
significant penalty related to leftover inventory, due to obsolescence. In this 
phase, inventory reduction and cost containment are the primary goals, and 
air shipments should be used infrequently, if at all. A summary of this policy is 
shown in Figure 2-15. 
Figure 2-15.  Example of a transportation mode strategy over the lifecycle of an electronic 
product
The approach described above can be used to analyze several other transpor-
tation situations, including full and partial truckloads and rail transport. Such 
a rigorous approach toward inventory analysis can result in effective use of 
multiple modes of transportation and an overall reduction in freight spend.

71
Staged Inventory
As the number of distribution and sales locations increase, so does the 
amount of inventory being held across the network, since each location holds 
safety stock to cover for variability. In such situations, staging inventory can 
reduce overall inventory levels without compromising service levels. Staging 
consolidates inventory at a central location, which has the effect of reducing 
demand variability, as exemplified in the excerpt below from an annual report 
of ScanSource, Inc. This lower variability results in lower safety stock and 
inventory levels. Additional savings are possible if holding costs are lower at 
the central facility as compared to more expensive local storage in metropoli-
tan areas. Finally, as the number of products and locations grow, the benefit 
can further increase because the resources and investment required to oper-
ate in a decentralized manner can be prohibitive.
We operate a 600,000 square foot centralized distribution center in 
Southaven, Mississippi, which is located near the FedEx hub facility in 
Memphis, Tennessee and serves all of North America. Our European 
operation utilizes a centralized third-party warehouse located in Liege, 
Belgium that services all of Europe. Warehouses for our Latin American 
operations are located in Florida, Mexico, and Brazil. Our distribution model 
creates several advantages, including: (i) a reduced amount of “safety 
stock” inventory which, in turn, reduces the Company’s working capital 
requirements; (ii) an increased turnover rate through tighter controls over 
inventory; (iii) maintenance of a consistent order-fill rate; (iv) improved 
personnel productivity; (v) improved delivery time; (vi) simplified purchasing 
and tracking; (vii) decreased demand for management personnel; and (viii) 
flexibility to meet customer needs for systems integration. Our objective is 
to ship all orders on the same day, using barcode technology to expedite 
shipments and minimize shipping errors. The Company offers reduced 
freight rates and flexible delivery options to minimize a reseller’s need for 
inventory.
—ScanSource Inc., 2014 Annual Report
Clearly, there are many benefits provided by inventory staging and centralized 
distribution. However, staging is not without its drawbacks, and the applicabil-
ity and returns need to be evaluated for each situation. Some of its general 
benefits and drawbacks are summarized in Table 2-5.

Chapter 2 | Inventory Planning
72
Methods for estimating inventory requirements for the staged network can 
range from the simple and approximate, to complex methods that account 
explicitly for interactions between the different locations. An sample approach 
that extends the service level method is shown in Figure 2-16 even though the 
formulation is developed for the simple case where demand and replenish-
ment schedules are the same across the different locations, it is nevertheless 
useful for illustrating the benefit of staging. As expected, the magnitude of 
reduction in inventory increases with the number of local facilities. In addition, 
the benefits obtained from optimal placement of the central facility to reduce 
replenishment times can be compelling.

3When demand is independent, the RMSE of forecast error for the central facility is 
calculated as s
s
=
m, where s is the standard deviation of forecast error for each of the 
m facilities. However, when demand is not independent, the relationship is 
if perfectly correlated, and the beneficial effect of aggregation is lost.
Therefore, staging inventory is an effective strategy with the potential to reduce 
inventories without compromising service levels. Transportation implications 
need to be studied carefully before initiating staging, since routings will change. 
What was previously a single shipment from the supplier to each of the loca-
tions will now be delivered using two shipments—one from the supplier to 
the central facility, and another from the central facility to the location. It is 
not always necessary for staging to result in higher transportation levels—if 
the original shipments used expensive partial truckloads, staging can reduce 
costs with the use of less expensive full truckloads.
Finally, another factor that determines the effectiveness of staging is whether 
demand across the different locations is correlated. The analysis presented 
above assumed that demand is independent, as can be expected when the 
causes of demand are determined largely by the local environment. However, 
when demand is affected by non-local factors such as the economy or the 
introduction of competitive products, the same demand pattern may be 
experienced across multiple locations. This results in demand being corre-
lated across multiple locations, which reduces the effectiveness of inventory 
aggregation.3
Raw Material Inventory
Raw materials are purchased parts and components that are required for pro-
duction of one or more products. Raw materials are connected to products 
using a bill of material (BOM). Essentially, a BOM is a list of parts needed for a 
product. The concept of a BOM has been extended for several different situ-
ations. A BOM that captures the manufacturing steps and parts required for 
each stage is called a manufacturing BOM. A similar concept is the modular 
BOM, which describes sub-assemblies. An engineering BOM specifies parts 
used in the design, and a planning BOM is used for production planning or 
financial calculations. Planning bills are usually far simpler in structure and  
capture only essential information. An example is shown in Figure 2-17.

The Profitable Supply Chain
75
Raw material inventory targets can be determined using the procedure 
described previously for staged inventory, which is illustrated in Figure 2-18. 
The planning bill is used to specify the interactions between the different 
products with the raw material; it collapses the several manufacturing steps 
into a single level and uses an estimate of the lead time for manufacturing for 
determining the finished goods and raw material safety stock.
Figure 2-17. An example of a planning bill
Figure 2-18.  Inventory levels for raw materials

Chapter 2 | Inventory Planning
76
Holding raw material inventory is another example of staging. While distri-
bution staging delays the commitment of inventory to a particular location, 
raw material inventory defers commitment to a particular product. The delay 
allows the forecast of each of the products to become clearer, ensuring that 
inventory and manufacturing labor are effectively utilized. As a result, the 
inventory benefits are similar to the case of staged inventory (Figure 2-18).
Postponement
Postponement is a strategy that delays the commitment of material to a final 
state (form or location) in order to provide a higher level of responsiveness 
and fulfillment, while simultaneously reducing inventory levels. This strategy is 
widely used in the automotive, aerospace, electronics, and apparel industries, 
although an increasing number of industries are adopting this strategy.4
An example of postponement most consumers are aware of comes from the 
paint industry. Where previously many hundreds or thousands of paint colors 
would need to be stocked to satisfy all color requests, it is now a common 
practice for the retailer to stock only the paint base and colorants separately, 
with the mixing of the two occurring during a sale to the consumer. This 
strategy is illustrated in Figure 2-19. The operational efficiency that is gained 
is clear—not only is it not necessary to stock hundreds of colors on the 
retailer’s shelves, but it is also not necessary to manufacture, transport, and 
store these different combinations. The result is a decrease in inventory levels 
at the distribution center and retail stores and a simultaneous increase in abil-
ity to satisfy almost any color combination a customer requests.

Civil and Environmental Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2006.

The Profitable Supply Chain
77
Another example of postponement comes from the electronics industry with 
regard to the manufacturing of printers. Electronic goods often need to satisfy 
several country options related to language and power ratings. The traditional 
approach of stocking inventory for each of these options can result in high 
inventory levels and costly misses if demand for the country options is differ-
ent from the forecast. In this case, the postponement strategy will result in 
printers being held in bulk and bundled with the appropriate country option 
prior to a shipment. This will result in lower overall inventory levels and lower 
re-packaging costs.
In general, postponement can be divided into two categories—manufacturing 
(and assembly) postponement and logistical postponement. Manufacturing 
postponement involves decisions made while the product is in production, the

strategy being to develop a platform or module that allows for different con-
figurations to be created with lower additional effort and cost, as emphasized 
in this excerpt from an annual report of PFSWeb, a provider of outsourced 
warehousing and fulfillment:
We will work with clients to re-sequence certain supply chain activities to 
aid in an inventory postponement strategy. We can provide kitting and 
assembly services and build-to-stock thousands of units daily to stock in 
a just-in-time (JIT) environment. This service, for example, can entail the 
procurement of packaging materials including retail boxes, foam inserts, 
and anti-static bags. These raw material components may be shipped to 
us from domestic or overseas manufacturers, and we will build the finished 
SKUs to stock for the client. Also included is the custom configuration 
of high-end printers and servers. This strategy allows manufacturers to 
make a smaller investment in base unit inventory while meeting changing 
customer demand for highly customizable products.
—PFSWeb, Inc., 2013 Annual Report
The retention of inventory in a raw form is an example of manufacturing 
postponement. Logistical postponement delays decisions related to packaging, 
labeling, and distribution. The staging of inventory is an example of logistical 
postponement.
Characteristics that make a product a good candidate for postponement 
include:
The need for a large number of configurations in order to 
• 
satisfy customer demand. This can be due to the nature 
of the product (for example, paint) or due to globaliza-
tion and support for many languages and regional require-
ments (for example, printers).
A high level of uncertainty in demand. The delay in the 
• 
commitment of material to a finished form allows the 
demand picture to become clearer, resulting in lower 
inventories and higher fill rates.
High holding costs, due to a high value of the product 
• 
(for example, expensive electronic items), form factor 
(for example, bulky furniture), or short product lifecycles 
(for example, trendy music players).

The Profitable Supply Chain
79
Long lead times, due to outsourced manufacturing and 
• 
overseas transportation. The increase in lead time results 
in limited flexibility, which has to be offset using expen-
sive inventory.
The ability of a product to be customized with minimal 
• 
expense, using a platform or modularization strategy. 
The trade-off that needs to be considered in evaluating a postponement strat-
egy is the benefit from holding less finished goods inventory against the pos-
sibility of increased cost due to transportation of assemblies and parts to the 
DC, as opposed to finished goods. The situation can be analyzed by calculating 
the total cost for the two cases separately, and comparing the incremental 
costs for manufacturing, transportation, and holding inventory. A simple com-
parison, assuming that supplier lead times are uniform across products and 
after postponement, is shown in Equation 2-27:

where

s is the forecast error, expressed as a fraction of demand (i.e., the coefficient 
of variation, which results in the computation of unit costs),
ts is the supply lead time, and
Dc refers to incremental unit costs for manufacturing (m) and transportation (t).
Transportation costs can be lower if suppliers are closer to the point of post-
ponement (closer to the point of sale) or if the base (unconfigured) unit and 
parts can be shipped in bulk at a lower cost. In such cases, reduced spend on 
transportation will further increase the benefit from postponement.
In general, the impact of postponement will not be restricted to a small section 
of the supply chain, but can impact material routings in manufacturing facilities 
and distribution centers. The cost comparison given in Equation 2-27 is far 
too simple and inadequate for such situation, instead a more comprehensive 
network-wide calculation of costs is required. Such methods are described in 
Chapter 6.

Chapter 2 | Inventory Planning
80
While postponement is a strategy that can provide companies with significant 
improvement opportunities, several challenges exist in identifying and imple-
menting the strategy. These include the ability for a traditional company to 
rethink its approach to product design and fulfillment, the difficulty in quanti-
fying and understanding the benefits, and inertia related to changing the sup-
ply chain to accommodate postponement. However, it appears to be only a 
matter of time before postponement practices become commonplace, due to 
adoption by market-leading companies and competitive pressures.
Supplier Flexibility
The need for companies to respond to changing market needs in order to 
compete effectively is at odds with the general trend toward outsourcing 
and off-shoring. This is the primary reason for the trend toward flexibility 
contracts between buyers and suppliers. Such contracts provide for short-
term production flexibility for a price. While different industries have adopted 
different flavors, they can largely be categorized as time- or quantity-based 
flexibility.
Time-based flexibility, commonly referred to as blanket agreements or blanket 
orders, requires that the buyer commit to a total order quantity for a season. 
While a specified fraction of the total quantity is delivered at the beginning 
of the agreement period, the buyer may purchase the remaining quantity at a 
later date. Finally, the buyer pays a penalty for any units not purchased. In some 
cases, the penalty could be the full price of the part, as is sometimes the case 
in the semiconductor industry.
Quantity-based flexibility allows the buyer to vary order quantities based on a 
proportion of the original order. The procedure is that the buyer initially pro-
vides a forecast of purchases to the supplier. In subsequent periods, the buyer 
is allowed to change the orders and forecast within the limits specified by the 
flexibility contract. Usually, the flexibility provided is limited in the immediate 
period and gradually increases over time, as shown in Figure 2-20.
Figure 2-20. An illustration of a flexibility agreement with a contract manufacturer

The Profitable Supply Chain
81
The benefit provided by flexibility is enabling production adjustments based on 
a more accurate forecast in the short-term. Flexibility can also improve service 
levels since production can be increased in response to favorable market con-
ditions. The benefits obtained from flexibility increase with demand variability. 
Specifically, the benefit from upside flexibility increases with increasing short-
age costs and an aggressive approach to inventory levels. The benefit from 
downside flexibility increases with higher price erosion and holding costs. 
There is an additional cost incurred by the supplier to provide flexibility, due 
to the need to maintain additional raw material or finished goods inventories, 
spare capacity, and changes to the production schedule. As a result, suppliers 
may be willing to provide flexibility if the additional price that can be charged 
is sufficient to cover the incremental costs. Similarly, the buyer will be will-
ing to pay the additional price as long as the incremental benefit exceeds  
the cost.
The ability and willingness of a supplier to provide flexibility is dependent on 
the nature of the product and manufacturing operations. Situations that limit 
the ability to provide flexibility in the short term include:
The use of custom parts, since the risk associated with 
• 
high inventory levels increases.
Complex manufacturing steps that require specialized 
• 
labor, due to the time required to identify, hire, and train 
new resources.
High factory utilization, since support for upside flex-
• 
ibility will require reliance on overtime or additional 
machinery.
A sensitive labor environment, such as a unionized work-
• 
force, that limits the ability to lower production.
Conversely, other situations allow the supply chain to be more flexible:
Low factory utilization, since an increase in production 
• 
can be supported and will increase the profitability of the 
plant. 
A supplier with a diversified customer and product port-
• 
folio, since production increases and decreases can be 
absorbed by other product lines.
Use of mass-produced components (as opposed to cus-
• 
tom parts) that are inexpensive to stock or can be used 
across multiple products.

Chapter 2 | Inventory Planning
82
Manufacturing operations that are of low or moderate 
• 
complexity, so that additional resources can be added 
quickly.
Easy availability of labor and a flexible labor force.
• 
In conclusion, supply flexibility can be an effective method for improving mar-
gins and service levels for products that display moderate to high uncertainty 
in demand. In order for effective use of this strategy, both parties need to 
implement appropriate processes to ensure that the guidelines and require-
ments are being followed.
Correlated Demand
Most of the situations described in the previous sections assume that demand 
is independent across the different time periods. When this is not the case, 
the safety stock requirement is calculated as

where n is the number of periods for which demand is perfectly (positively) 
correlated, and demand and supply variances are independent. Since the benefi-
cial effect of reducing variance when demand is independent is lost, the result-
ing safety stock levels are higher. The impact of the additional inventory on 
margins is similar to the effect discussed for supply variability (Figure 2-11).
Correlated demand can occur due to several reasons, including the following: 
Economic shifts that cause sustained up- or down-trends 
• 
in demand. These economic factors can include changes 
in interest rates, a housing market collapse or surge, and 
even changes in a country’s regulations.
Competitive activity, including the introduction of new 
• 
products that have the capability to fundamentally change 
demand patterns. Note that the competition’s promo-
tional activity does not have the same impact since prices 
revert to original quantities after a duration, resulting in a 
return to equilibrium for the product.
Introduction of large business customers who can 
• 
increase demand for several months at a stretch. Similarly, 
the loss of large customers can have the effect of decreas-
ing demand for several months.

The Profitable Supply Chain
83
Introduction of new products for which consumer per-
• 
ception is unclear. The first few months of sales can dis-
play consistent up- or down-trends based on the market’s 
response.
Cannibalization of demand due to additional sales of 
• 
other products in the portfolio.
In addition, even though demand may be independent for several months at a 
stretch, correlation can occur due to any one of the factors described above. 
Indeed, it is not clear when such factors will surface, which increases the chal-
lenge of planning inventories. If inventory levels are set based on an assump-
tion of independent demand, it is easy to see why supply chain “surprises” and 
high levels of expedites or inventories can occur. 
EXAMPLE 2-8: EFFECT OF CORRELATED DEMAND ON 
INVENTORY LEVELS
An electronic product displays a forecast error of 25% (relative to the expected monthly 
demand), a supply variability of 10 days, and a supply lead time of 2 months.
If the desired service level is 97%, the safety stock is calculated from Figure 2-5 for the

It is clear that the effect of correlation is to increase inventory levels in order to provide 
a targeted service level. If lead times are large, the impact of correlated demand is 
magnified, as shown in Table 2-6.

Chapter 2 | Inventory Planning
84
Finally, if there is reason to believe that a certain level of correlation exists between 
demand and supply variability, these inventory requirements will further increase, as 
explained previously in the derivation of the service level method. 
Summary
The chapter introduced several important concepts regarding the importance 
of inventory for a business and the different methods available to the analyst 
to ensure that margins and profits are adequately considered in the decision-
making process. While the success of the inventory strategy depends on the 
processes and systems put in place, an equally important factor is the role of 
the analyst. The analyst has the challenging task of managing uncertainty and 
balancing the constant demand for inventory from the rest of the organization 
against the cost of excesses.
One of the important steps that drives the effectiveness of the inventory plan 
is defining safety stock requirements. Several methods have been introduced 
in this chapter, each with its advantages and disadvantages, and applicability to 
different situations. Since the choice of methods can be confusing, a simple set 
of guidelines has been provided in Table 2-7. It is important to recognize that 
these industry-specific guidelines are approximate. Products in any of these 
categories can briefly or permanently display characteristics that make it well-
suited for other methods. Therefore, it is important that the inventory analyst 
gain an understanding of the different inventory categories and management 
methods.

Choosing the appropriate method merely improves the quality of the guidance 
provided. Given that several assumptions have been made while construct-
ing these models, this guidance needs to be modified based on the analyst’s 
knowledge of out-of-bounds or special situations. The use of control limits 
(that is, upper and lower bands for maintaining inventory) is recommended 
for ensuring that small changes in underlying variables do not disrupt the per-
formance of the supply chain.
When several hundreds or even thousands of items have to be managed, it is 
easy to overlook poor performance and incur additional costs. Therefore, it is 
important to implement a rigorous performance review process that identi-
fies poorly performing items (further discussed in Chapter 7).
In many situations, it is not easy to calculate service levels and fill rates accu-
rately due to loss of information during the sales process. For example, if a 
salesman is aware of low inventory levels for a particular product and guides 
a customer toward the purchase of an alternative product, metrics based on 
sales data will fail to capture this shortfall. In fact, the data can lead the inven-
tory analyst to believe that the inventory planning process is performing well, 
which can be contrary to the belief of the rest of the organization and the 
company’s customers. In such situations, it is necessary to augment the quanti-
tative measurement with surveys and interviews with the sales and marketing 
division and channel customers—any perception that a particular product is 
always in short supply needs to be considered while setting inventory param-
eters and safety stock levels.

Demand 
Planning
Demand planning is the process of understanding customer and market per-
ceptions of the company’s products and specifying an accurate picture of 
future revenues and sales volumes. The benefits are easy to understand: good 
management of demand will help improve customer service and relationships, 
a paramount goal for most companies. An accurate forecast will also serve to 
align supply with demand, resulting in lower inventory and capacity levels and 
reduced waste and costs.
The availability of demand-related information has increased dramatically in this 
increasingly digital world, but courses and textbooks on demand planning still 
expound on traditional forecasting methods, mainly time series (i.e., ­forecasts 
generated based on sales history). But the forecaster is faced with challeng-
ing situations almost on a daily basis, from dealing with a cloudy economic 
outlook to gauging the impact of a competitor’s new product. Traditional 
forecasting methods provide little support for analyzing such needs.
This chapter addresses these needs by providing several approaches for 
­understanding and handling non-standard situations, including price ­elasticity, 
economic indicators, expansion to new markets, the impact of weather, 
­distortion of channel forecasts, and collaborating with channel partners.

The Importance of Demand Planning
The importance of accurate forecasts is emphasized in the following state-
ments by Plantronics, a manufacturer of headsets for telephones.
We determine production levels based on our forecasts of demand for 
our products. Actual demand for our products depends on many factors, 
which makes it difficult to forecast. We have experienced differences 
between our actual and our forecasted demand in the past and expect 
differences to arise in the future. Significant unanticipated fluctuations 
in demand and the global trend toward consignment of products could 
cause the following operating problems, among others:
If forecasted demand does not develop, we could have excess inventory 
and excess capacity. Overforecast of demand could result in higher 
inventories of finished products, components, and sub-assemblies. In 
addition, because our retail customers have pronounced seasonality, we 
must build inventory well in advance of the December quarter in order 
to stock up for the anticipated future demand. If we were unable to sell 
these inventories, we would have to write off some or all of our inventories 
of excess products and unusable components and sub-assemblies. Excess 
manufacturing capacity could lead to higher production costs and lower 
margins;
If demand increases beyond that forecasted, we would have to rapidly 
increase production. We currently depend on suppliers to provide additional 
volumes of components and sub-assemblies, and we are experiencing 
greater dependence on single source suppliers; therefore, we might not be 
able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand. 
This could cause us to fail to meet customer expectations. There could 
be short-term losses of sales while we are trying to increase production.  
If customers turn to our competitors to meet their needs, there could be 
a long-term impact on our revenues and profitability;
Rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could 
result in higher costs for components and sub-assemblies, increased 
expenditures for freight to expedite delivery of required materials, and 
higher overtime costs and other expenses. These higher expenditures 
could lower our profit margins. Further, if production is increased rapidly, 
there may be decreased manufacturing yields, which may also lower our 
margins.

It is clear from these statements that an inaccurate forecast will result in 
higher costs. Developing an accurate forecast requires an understanding of all 
the factors that can impact the business, and the ability to answer questions 
such as the following:
What sales can be expected for a particular product at a 
• 
particular location?
Does a product exhibit seasonality? If so, how can this 
• 
seasonal demand be estimated?
How do external factors, such as weather and economic 
• 
conditions, impact demand?
How can demand for a product in a new market be 
• 
estimated?
How and why does demand information get distorted by 
• 
channel partners? How can this exchange of information 
be improved?
Are qualitative forecasts useful? How can quantitative 
• 
and qualitative forecasts be reconciled?
How can mismatches between demand and supply be 
• 
addressed? Is it possible to allocate scarce supply in order 
to meet strategic goals?
The rest of the chapter describes processes and quantitative methods that 
address these needs.
The Demand Planning Process 
In most companies, the demand planning process is managed by the marketing 
department of a company, with inputs from customers, sales, and operations 
when appropriate. The main functions of demand planning are:
• 
Forecasting. The process of specifying the company’s esti-
mate of product demand considers several factors, includ-
ing historical data, partner feedback, customer perceptions, 
environmental factors, and competitive situations.
• 
Collaboration. Relevant to business-to-business (B2B) situ-
ations, this refers to the mutual sharing of information 
related to demand and trends between retailers and 
manufacturers.
• 
Price Adjustments. When the primary method for setting 
price is based on cost (i.e., the cost-plus model), this pro-
cess reevaluates and resets prices based on inventory 
positions and cost variances.

Chapter 3 | Demand Planning

The flow of information and interactions between these steps is described in 
Figure 3-1. The specific steps that are required for a company depend on its 
business environment—whether the company’s products are make-to-order, 
make-to-forecast, or assemble-to-order. The factors that dictate the environ-
ment are the lead time provided by the customer for fulfilling orders, and the 
lead time for supply consisting of the time taken to procure raw materials 
and manufacture and distribute products. The different cases are shown in 
Table 3-1. Make-to-order is characterized by a supply lead time less than the 
customer lead time. This business model is common for highly engineered 
products such as airplanes; the order specifies the custom design and part 
specifications. As a result, the company does not take on any risk related 
to inventory positions. Instead, profitability is closely linked to manufacturing 
efficiency.
Figure 3-1. The demand planning process

The Profitable Supply Chain
91
Make-to-forecast, also termed make-to-stock, is characterized by a supply 
lead time that is greater than the customer lead time. This situation is very  
common for retail, distribution, and a majority of manufacturing businesses. 
The difference between the supply and customer lead time is a measure 
of the inventory exposure faced by the company. If the difference is large, 
then the company is required to take inventory positions well in advance of 
sales, resulting in greater exposure. For example, the customer lead time for 
a retailer is a few minutes (the time between a customer walking into the 
store and check-out), while the supply lead time is approximately four weeks. 
Similarly, an electronics manufacturer may be provided two weeks to fulfill a 
customer orders, but experience the same exposure due to a six-week supply 
lead time. Both these companies have to take an inventory position in order 
to provide a good customer experience. 
Assemble-to-order is essentially a make-to-forecast system with the differ-
ence that final assembly can be postponed to occur after the order has been 
received from the customer. This postponed manufacturing step allows for 
several configurations to be supported with no finished goods inventory, and 
only raw material or sub-assembly inventory. If it is possible to re-design the 
product to convert from make-to-stock into assemble-to-order, this will result 
in lower inventory exposure. 
The business model determines the processes and steps that need to be 
employed. For example, a make-to-order company will have less need for a 
forecasting process since material can be ordered after the customer’s order 
has been placed. Some examples of the relevance of the different processes 
for different business environments are shown in Table 3-2. As expected, 
manufacturers of make-to-stock products have the greatest need for the 
different demand planning processes.

Each of these processes is described in the remaining sections of this chapter. 
Perusing them, you will appreciate that each of these processes has to be  
tailored to suit the unique requirements of each industry and company.
Measures of Forecast Performance
Forecast accuracy is the single most important metric for gauging the effective-
ness of the forecasting process. Measures of accuracy include the following:
Forecast bias is a measure of constant under- or over-forecasting and is calcu-
lated as the average error per observation:
	
	
	
Forecast Bias =

In Equation 3-1, di is the actual demand, di is the forecast for period i, and n is 
the number of periods. Under this definition, a positive bias indicates a trend 
toward under-forecasting, while a negative bias indicates over-forecasting.

The mean absolute deviation (MAD), a widely used measure of accuracy, is  
calculated as the average absolute error per observation,

Because MAD is calculated by summing absolute forecast errors, it is always 
greater than or equal to the bias. 
Yet another measure is the root mean square error (RMSE), calculated as

RMSE is similar to MAD since it does not allow positive and negative errors 
across time to cancel each other (due to the square term). But the RMSE is 
different from MAD in that large variances have a greater influence on the 
measurement—mathematically, it has a standard deviation form. Therefore, 
RMSE is the appropriate measurement to be used in the safety-stock models 
(namely, the service level and newsvendor models) described in Chapter 2.
While MAD, bias, and RMSE measure the magnitude of error, a useful relative 
measure is the mean absolute percent error (MAPE), calculated as

Lagged Forecast Errors
For supply chains with extended lead times, it is not sufficient to monitor 
forecast accuracy for the same month (i.e., forecast for a month generated 
at the beginning of that month). The most widely used method for tracking 
2- and 3-month-out forecast errors is the waterfall table, shown in Figure 3-2. 
This table is constructed by listing historical forecasts in rows, followed by the 
actual demand for each month. Then, forecast errors are calculated by com-
paring actual demand to the different forecasts for that month, as explained 
in the figure.
Figure 3-2. The waterfall table for calculating forecast errors
Explanation of the Lagged Forecast Error Calculations
 
March's current month forecast error
  = (Actual for March - Forecast for March created in March) / Actual for 
March
  = (95 - 120) / 95
  = -26%.
March's 1-month-out forecast error
  = (Actual for March - Forecast for March created in Feb) / Actual for 
March
  = (95 - 110) / 95
  = - 16%.
March's 2-months-out forecast error
  = (Actual for March - Forecast for March created in Jan) / Actual for 
March
  = (95 - 100) / 95
  = -5%.
 

The Profitable Supply Chain
95
With this procedure, the forecaster can decide which measure of forecast 
accuracy needs to be utilized. If a product has a supply lead time of 3 weeks, 
then the current month error can be used to gauge forecast performance and 
for safety-stock calculations. However, if the supply lead time is 12 weeks, then 
the 2-month-out error needs to be used. 
Demand Forecasting
The objective of the demand forecasting process is to specify an accurate 
estimate of the demand for the product into the future. Demand is affected 
by several factors, including:
• 
Established market. Market penetration and seasonal effects, 
reflected by historical demand data.
• 
Price. The occasional or regular change in price due to 
promotions can change demand significantly.
• 
Introduction of new products and entry into new markets. The 
company’s estimate of the market’s perception of a new 
product or in a new market may differ significantly from 
reality.
• 
The environment. Weather can magnify or shrink demand 
for certain goods, and it can impact several others by 
causing changes in the consumer’s buying patterns.
• 
Governmental policies. Hazardous material regulations, 
embargoes, and customs regulations are just a few fac-
tors that can change demand.
• 
Economic changes. Economic indicators reflect a change in 
the business environment that can foretell demand trends.
• 
Channel distortion. When a company sells its goods indi-
rectly to the consumer through a sales channel, the biases 
introduced by the partner can significantly decrease fore-
cast accuracy. 
Each of these factors can be addressed by one or more methods, qualitative 
and quantitative. Qualitative methods consider subjective or personal experi-
ences into the forecast. Some examples of qualitative methods are:
• 
Sales force forecasting. Individual forecasts from sales rep-
resentatives and managers are added to arrive at the 
forecast. Because sales force forecasts frequently specify 
the financial projection for a product group, there is often 
a need for an additional translation step to convert this 
forecast into a unit forecast for a product.

Chapter 3 | Demand Planning
96
• 
Delphi method. A panel of experts is asked their opinion 
of future demand. The experts are consulted separately 
in order to avoid the undue influence of a strong willed 
individual in a group setting. The experts could include 
executives in marketing and sales, as well as channel 
partners.
• 
Surveys. Consumer polls regarding responses to specific 
product features provide insight into market perception. 
This method is often used for new products.
Quantitative methods use statistical methods in order to arrive at a forecast. 
The most widely used quantitative methods are:
• 
Time series forecasting. A statistical method that uses 
historical demand data to calculate the forecast. This 
method assumes that all factors that impact demand are 
present in historical trends.
• 
Causal forecasting. This broadly refers to the consider-
ation of factors that cause a change in demand, or lead 
demand in a determinable fashion. Examples include envi-
ronmental, political, price, and economic factors. The 
most common mathematical method for creating causal 
forecast is regression. 
Quantitative methods are less subject to bias than qualitative methods. (Bias 
is the consistent over- or under-prediction of demand.) However, qualitative 
methods are useful for incorporating information that is not reflected in the 
historical data but is known to the individual. As a result, a consensus method 
that utilizes both quantitative and qualitative forecast is used to reconcile dif-
ferences. Examples of consensus methods are:
• 
Collaborative forecasting. This refers to the structured dia-
logues between retail and manufacturing partners. The 
objective of the collaboration is to communicate product 
demand, promotion, and expansion related information.
• 
Pyramid forecasting. This method refers to the entry of 
sales and managerial inputs at various levels in the prod-
uct and geographic structure. These entries are recon-
ciled with the numbers generated utilizing other methods, 
such as time series forecasts.
Most companies will find that a single forecasting method will not suffice, and 
there is a need to rely on several methods. The reason is due to the inherent 
difficulty in forecasting—predicting the future requires reliance on historical  
patterns, market conditions, competitive activity, environmental changes, 
and partner inputs. No one method addresses all of these different aspects.  

The Profitable Supply Chain
97
In fact, the accuracy of the forecast generated by each method can vary 
according to the forecast horizon (i.e., the number of months into the future 
for which the forecast is generated). Time series methods are usually accu-
rate for shorter time horizons when new influences are not expected to 
affect product demand. Collaborative forecasting, which targets transparency 
between partners regarding advertising and promotion plans, is useful in the 
2-to-6-month time frame because it provides visibility to new factors (for 
example, expansion into new markets). Causal forecasting, which can be used 
to generate forecasts based on environmental or economic conditions, is use-
ful for both the short and long term since a variety of factors can be consid-
ered. Pyramid forecasting allows for the forecast from different organizations 
to be matched, and is an effective method for managing the entire forecasting 
horizon. Each of these methods is described in further detail in the following 
sections. Finally, a comparison of these methods is provided toward the end 
of the chapter.
Time Series Forecasting
Time series forecasting is a statistical method that uses historical sales data 
in order to estimate future sales. Time series models are ignorant about the 
causality that affects demand; instead, the models assume that all the causal 
effects are captured adequately in the historical sales data. Time series meth-
ods can be used to estimate level, trend, and seasonal effects. (A trend is a 
regular, slowly evolving change in the level of demand, whereas seasonality is a 
pattern that repeats after a time period.)
Moving Averages
The time series method that is most popular and easiest to employ is moving 
averages. In this method, the forecast for a particular product or product line 
is calculated by averaging the historical sales data over a specified number of 
periods. For example, a 3-month moving average would calculate the forecast 
as the average of sales for the last 3 months. This method results in a single 
value of forecast into the future. Therefore, moving averages ignores any trend 
and seasonality effects that are present in the data.

where n is the number of periods in the moving average, and t is the most

is illustrated in Example 3-1. 

Chapter 3 | Demand Planning
98
Single Exponential Smoothing
The moving averages forecast performed a simple average of past observa-
tions, with each observation being weighted equally. If the forecaster would 
like to give more weight to recent observations, an exponential smoothing 
model can be used. The simple form of exponential smoothing is also referred 
to as single exponential and the forecast is calculated as:

(3-7)
where a is the smoothing constant and has a value between 0 and 1.Dt is the 
actual demand for period t and Ft is the exponentially smoothed forecast for 
period t.
Larger values of a will give more weight to recent demands and utilize older 
demand data less than for smaller a. Therefore, large a will result in a more 
responsive and sometimes “nervous” forecast, while smaller a will produce a 
more stable forecast but will react slowly to changes in underlying demand.
Another way to write Equation 3-7 is to expand the forecast term Ft using 
the exponential smoothing formula. When this expansion is repeated for all 
forecast terms, the result is that the forecast can be calculated explicitly from 
historical sales data, as shown in Equation 3-8:

If the coefficients are plotted as shown in Figure 3-3, the higher weight placed 
on the most recent observation is easily seen, with the weight on earlier sales 
numbers being exponentially lower. For this reason, the method in Equation 3-8  
is also referred to as exponential moving averages.

The Profitable Supply Chain
99
While it easier to use Equation 3-7 for calculating forecasts, the form provided 
in Equation 3-8 is useful for understanding the nature of the calculation and 
why a higher value of a results in a greater weight on recent observations, 
while a lower value of a places a more uniform weight on recent and earlier 
observations.
EXAMPLE 3-1: FORECASTING USING TIME SERIES 
MODELS
The different methods are applied to the durable goods shipment data provided by the 
U.S. Census Bureau (specifically the UMDMVS series, where the U indicates seasonally 
unadjusted, MDM is the industry code for durable goods, and VS is the data code for 
value of shipments). The data is shown in Figure 3-4.

First, forecasts are generated using 6-month moving averages (MA) for years 2012 
onward. The calculation is performed according to Equation 3-6, and the procedure is 
illustrated here:
Forecast for January 2012
= Average of prior 6 months of shipments

,
.
Because MA result in a stationary forecast (i.e., a single value for future periods), the 
forecast for February is the same as for January (212,465). As a result, the forecast 
errors are calculated as
Current month forecast error (MA)=197,088-212,465=-15,377 (-8%)
Next month forecast error = 211,293-212,465=-1,172 (-1%)
The procedure is exceedingly simple, which is the reason that MA is so widely used.
Next, forecasts are generated using single exponential smoothing (SES), with a = 0.5.  
Because this method uses the prior forecast, it requires a starting procedure to generate 
an initial value. This is achieved by setting the forecast for February 2010 equal to 
the actual shipment for January 2010—that is, 163,865. The March 2010 forecast is 
calculated according to Equation 3-7 as
SES forcast for March 2010

* Actual shipment for February 2010

a
-a) Forecast for February 2010
= 0.5 *167061+ (1

The procedure is repeated for subsequent months and results in a forecast for December 
2011 of 211,525. With this value, the forecast for January 2012 is calculated as
SES forcast for January 2012
=
* Actual shipment for December 2011

Exponential smoothing is a more involved procedure than moving averages. The 
advantage of SES is that it naturally places a greater weight on the most recent 
observation. In addition, a is easily varied, which effectively increases or decreases the 
lookback period—a higher value of a decreases the lookback period, whereas a lower 
value of a increases the lookback period.

Double Exponential Smoothing
The single exponential smoothing model results in a single value of forecast 
for the future (i.e., a stationary forecast). If there is a systematic pattern in the 
underlying data, then the model needs to be augmented to reflect the increas-
ing or decreasing trend. The time series method that accounts for trends 
is called the trend-enhanced smoothed, double exponential smoothing, or Holt’s 
method. It involves two parameters (a for exponential smoothing and an addi-
tional parameter, b, for trend).

In Equation 3-9, L represents the level forecast, T represents the trend fore-
cast, and D is actual demand. As with single exponential smoothing, starting 
values are required for initial level and trend estimates. One simple method is 
to set the level forecast as the first actual sales observation and the trend as 
the difference between the first two sales observations. Example 3-1 further 
illustrates the use of this method. 
The data provided in Example 3-1, which are used to compute initial estimates 
for the level and trend forecasts, are obtained as follows:

Unlike MA and SES, DES results in non-stationary forecasts. This is an important 
aspect because many businesses require forecasts to be generated for sev-
eral months into the future so that operations can be appropriately planned. 
However, DES is not without its drawbacks. The first is that DES requires 
two parameters (Equation 3-9), which places an additional burden on the 
forecaster to determine the values to be used. Frequently, many forecasters 
simply set both parameters to 0.2. which results in a damped forecast. Once 
sufficient sales data has been gathered, the parameters can be determined 
from a trial-and-error procedure to determine values that minimize error. 
The second drawback is related to the trend, inasmuch as the calculations 
for the third and subsequent periods are often too simplistic. In the example 
above, if an annual forecast is required, then the forecast for the 12th month 
would be F

. Examining prior 
sales data, it can be seen that this estimate is likely to be low. This simplis-
tic approach is a problem experienced with DES for projections even two 
periods into the future. The business situations that require accounting for 
trends are usually for new products experiencing an initial ramp, obsoleting 
products experiencing a decrease in demand due to phase-out, or established 
products displaying a trend due to stronger or weaker adoption. The first 
two situations—new or obsolete products—are best dealt with in a manual 
fashion, with the ramp often being dictated by production capacity, or phase-
outs being dictated by the timing of new product introductions. The third 
situation—established products displaying a trend—are often best dealt with 
using SES with a high value of a so that forecasts respond quickly to the 
underlying trend. Yet another method for dealing with this situation is to use 
pyramid forecasting to align product demand with revenue targets specified by 
management. This method is described later in this chapter. 
Due to these drawbacks, the use of DES is often limited in practice. When it 
is used, it is often for just short-term forecasting (one or two periods).

Triple Exponential Smoothing
The methods described in the preceding section are adequate when the data 
displays a linear trend, but do not perform well when seasonality is present. 
Examples of seasonal trends are back-to-school for educational products, and 
Christmas for most consumer goods. A quarterly seasonal pattern is apparent 
in the durable goods shipments shown in Figure 3-5, with the third month of 
each calendar quarter displaying an uptick in demand.
Figure 3-5.  Seasonal patterns in durable goods shipment data ($ million) (U.S. Census Bureau)
The time series method that incorporates seasonality is referred to as  
triple exponential smoothing (TES) or the Holt-Winters method. It involves three 
parameters—the first parameter for level, the second for trend, and the third 
for seasonality.

In Equation 3-10, S represents seasonal factors and p is the periodicity of 
demand. The procedure for implementing this method is illustrated below, 
using the data provided in Example 3-1. 

Chapter 3 | Demand Planning
104
The first step is to determine the periodicity of demand—the coefficient of 
auto-correlation can be used to determine this, and can be performed using 
a spreadsheet. The data for the first 2 years (i.e., 2010 and 2011) will be used 
to determine the period. If the shipment data is placed in a spreadsheet in cells 
A1 to A24, then the coefficient of correlation for a period of 2 months can be 
determined with the formula CORREL(A1:A22, A3:A24). Similarly, the coeffi-
cient of correlation for a period of 3 months can be determined with the formula 
CORREL(A1:A21, A4:A24). This calculation is repeated for various periods and 
the highest correlation coefficient indicates the period of demand. Performing 
the calculation for various combinations reveals that the coefficient of correla-
tion is 0.57 for 3 month, 0.62 for 6 months, and has the highest value of 0.96 for 
12 months. Therefore, the periodicity of demand is assumed to be 12 months.
The starting values for level and trend are the same as with DES; the starting 
values for the 12 seasonal indices are set to be 1.0. With this, the following 
initial forecasts are calculated for January 2012 as shown below.

Note that, like DES, TES results in a non-stationary forecast, but this forecast 
has been further adjusted for a seasonal component based on the periodicity 
of demand.
The previous section discussed some of the drawbacks associated with trend-
based forecasting. Because Equation 3-010 includes the same trend term, TES 
is subject to the same drawbacks; in fact, there is an additional parameter (g) 
to be set, which increases complexity. However, an approach that is often used 
in practice is to generate a forecast considering only the level and seasonal 
term, so that the drawbacks to using a simplistic trend calculation for future 
periods are not an issue. This can be achieved by setting b = 0 in Equation 3-10  
and setting the initial trend value to zero.

The Profitable Supply Chain
105
Because time series methods depend on sales history to discern patterns, any 
outliers can distort the demand picture and result in highly inaccurate fore-
casts. While it is enticing to remove outliers based on some statistical filter 
(such as any observation that is more than 2 standard deviations away from 
the 6-month moving average), this artificial modification of demand can have a 
detrimental effect on forecast accuracy if such deviations from the average can 
be expected in the future. It is far better to deal with outliers by understand-
ing the nature of underlying demand signal and making adjustments accord-
ingly, for example, by ignoring a special order from a customer undertaking a 
special one-time project. An example of this method is described in a later 
section on demand unawareness, which addresses non-recurring demand. 
The methods and example demonstrated the use of historical data to create a 
forecast. These methods are effective when there is sufficient cause to believe 
that future demand will behave according to historical trends and patterns. 
However, there are several situations that do not lend themselves to history-
based forecasting alone. Such situations include:
Price-related influences, with future pricing trends being 
• 
different from the past
Expansion into new markets
• 
Weather impact, especially due to extreme weather 
• 
situations
Economic changes, such as changing interest and unem-
• 
ployment rates, and construction activity
Distortion of demand when communicated by a channel 
• 
partner, based on individual biases and ordering policies
These reasons result in a demand pattern that may deviate significantly from 
past history and therefore requires different forecasting approaches. Each of 
these issues is discussed in turn in the following sections. 
Impact of Price on Demand
For most goods, a price drop will result in an increase in demand. When the 
quantity changes appreciably with price, the demand is termed elastic. In gen-
eral, products that display elasticity have one or more of the following charac-
teristics—they are not necessities, have substitutes, or are already priced low. 
On the other hand, necessities with no substitutes are inelastic and display 
little change in demand with price. The definition of price elasticity is
	
	
Price Elasticity = Percent change in demand
Percent change in price
	
(3-11)

Chapter 3 | Demand Planning
106
Price elasticity is negative for most products—i.e., a decrease in price results 
in an increase in demand, and an increase in price results in a decrease in 
demand. Additionally, when the absolute value of elasticity is greater than one, 
demand is considered to be elastic and a small change in price produces a 
relatively large change in demand. When the absolute value of elasticity is less 
than one, demand is considered to be inelastic and changes in price have little 
effect on demand volumes.
If data can be collected that clearly isolates the impact of price changes, elas-
ticity can be determined easily. However, most demand data combines price 
changes with underlying trend and seasonal patterns, requiring that multiple 
factors be considered simultaneously. Regression methods can be used to 
understand the impact of price in isolation. Often, a simple model can provide 
the necessary insight, and allow for easy implementation of pricing related 
strategies. Example 3-2 exemplifies such a simple procedure.
EXAMPLE 3-2: FORECASTING THE EFFECT OF PRICE 
ON DEMAND
A manufacturer of lighting products measures its sales force on accuracy of revenue 
and units sold. Because regional sales managers have the authority to set price, the 
company wishes to provide them with price elasticity information so that revenue and 
volume analysis can be performed. How can this value be determined?

where di is the demand for period i, di-1 is the demand for period (i-1), pi is the price for 
period i, and c2 is the price elasticity. Such a model is applicable when the demand for 
a period is expected to be similar to the demand for the prior period.
The first step is to gather data related to historical sales and prices and perform the 
necessary calculations, as shown in Figure 3-6.

The regression model reveals that the price elasticity is -2.32, with a coefficient of 
determination of 0.87. Because the absolute value of elasticity is greater than 1, this 
indicates that the product experiences elastic demand and is sensitive to price changes. 
From this equation, the sales managers can use the simple rule that a 1% decrease in 
price will result in a 2.3% increase in demand volumes.
There are several challenges faced when trying to incorporate price. First, 
assuming that demand is dependent only on price may not be accurate since 
other factors can contribute to fluctuations (such as weather and seasonal-
ity). Therefore, in order for the price model to provide an accurate relation-
ship, it is necessary to select a duration over which the impact is known to 
be primarily price, or to increase the complexity of the model to include 
other affecting factors. Second, price changes can impact demand in the same 
period, as well as subsequent periods. Price reductions provide an incentive 
for the consumer to purchase goods earlier than planned, resulting in a shift of 
demand to the current period. In such cases, additional price terms need to be 
included in the model. Finally, elasticity depends on demographic factors such 
as age and income, as well as store level considerations such as competing

items and retailers. The model developed in the example provides no insight 
into the fundamental nature of elasticity. Detailed models can provide the fun-
damental insights, but have significantly greater data requirements related to 
daily sales, promotions, and in-store coupon information, data for competing 
products, and the proximity of competing stores.1
Market Expansion
New product forecasting requires that sales estimates be made by considering 
several factors, including market size, product characteristics, time required 
for adoption, price points, and competitive products. Since the impact of each 
of these factors is uncertain, forecasting the demand for new products is a 
challenging task. Some of the methods used are:
• 
Market analysis. Such a method starts with an estimate of 
the total market potential, and then reductions are made 
to this number according to product features, price, and 
competitive factors.
• 
Analogous forecasting. This popular method maps the sales 
profile or an existing, similar product to the new product. 
While seasonal and lifecycle profiles are retained, lifecycle 
or annual volumes can be modified based on a market 
analysis for the new product.
• 
Diffusion modeling. The adoption of a product is perceived 
to go through the following steps: Awareness, interest, 
evaluation, trial, and adoption. The diffusion model uses 
an S-shaped curve that models several of these aspects 
and forecasts sales over time.2
On the other hand, market expansion refers to the introduction of existing 
products into new geographies and stores. Since the product is not new, sales 
numbers from existing markets are available, providing valuable information 
regarding market size and consumer perceptions. Diffusion effects, while pres-
ent, can be significantly accelerated due to the awareness that has already been 
created in the marketplace. As with new products, sales estimates for new 
markets can be estimated in a few different ways: One method is to use guid-
ance provided by channel partners or judgmental methods. Yet another is to 
derive a forecast based on sales for another product being sold in that market; 
the accuracy of such a forecast depends on how similar the products are.

Science, 15: 215-227, 1969.

When channel guidance and similar-product sales are not reliable, ­demographic 
analysis is an alternative for arriving at a forecast. The effect of demograph-
ics on sales differs by industry. For example, an annual report of Bausch & 
Lomb, a manufacturer of eye health products, identifies age as an important 
demographic:
We expect drivers of sales and earnings growth over the next several 
years to include:
A continued focus on faster growing business segments 
• 
and the launch of higher-margin new products in each of 
our product categories;
Favorable demographic trends, such as the aging of the 
• 
population and an increase in the incidence of myopia and 
presbyopia; and
Opportunities to further implement lean manufacturing 
• 
techniques and other cost improvements to enhance mar-
gins, particularly for contact lenses and intraocular lenses.
—Bausch & Lomb, Inc., 2007 Annual Report
Similarly, an annual report of the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, a beverage manu-
facturer, identifies a different set of demographics:
We are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs. We 
believe marketing and product innovations that target fast growing 
population segments, such as the Hispanic community in the U.S., could 
drive market growth. Additionally, as more consumers are faced with a 
busy and on-the-go lifestyle, sales of single-serve beverages could increase, 
which typically have higher margins.
—Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, 2013 Annual Report
An annual report of Sonic Corporation, a restaurant chain, identifies addi-
tional demographic factors:
Franchise Drive-In Development. We assist each franchisee in selecting 
sites and developing Sonic Drive-Ins. Each franchisee has responsibility for 
selecting the franchisee’s drive-in location but must obtain our approval of 
each Sonic Drive-In design and each location based on accessibility and 
visibility of the site and targeted demographic factors, including population 
density, income, age, and traffic. We provide our franchisees with the 
physical specifications for the typical Sonic Drive-In. 
—Sonic Corp., 2009 Annual Report

Chapter 3 | Demand Planning

Clearly, the characteristics of the product determine the specific demographic 
factors that need to be considered. Some of the most common factors are:
• 
Population. Often a starting point in estimating market 
opportunity, population-based estimates may not yield 
good results for products that appeal to only a particular 
section of the population. As a result, additional factors, 
such as age or education, are often considered in addition 
to population.
• 
Age. Segmentation of age provides visibility to market 
opportunity for products for specific ages. Additionally, 
age has been found to be a factor in responsiveness to 
price changes, with elderly people being more sensitive 
to price in general.
• 
Ethnicity. Provides visibility to market opportunity for 
products geared toward specific ethnic populations.
• 
Educational attainment. College education is often an indi-
cator of market opportunity for products that require 
research or are geared toward specialists. This could 
include health foods as well as high-end electronic items.
• 
Income. An important factor in determining market 
opportunity, income also plays a role in determining 
price sensitivity. Higher income is often equated with low 
elasticity, reducing the effect of price reductions. Indeed, 
there are cases when higher income can result in positive 
values for elasticity (reference 8).
• 
Household size. An important indicator of market oppor-
tunity, household size also factors into responsiveness to 
price changes. Larger households are more sensitive to 
price changes (reference 9).
• 
Housing units. The number of housing structures, as well 
as the number of units in each structure, is a useful indica-
tor for several class of building materials. 
Demographic analysis can be performed according to the following steps. 
First, demand data is collected for several different geographies. Usually, quar-
terly or annual data is used so that demand is not skewed by timing of sales 
or seasonality that can arise from weekly or monthly data. The second step is 
to identify demographic variables that have the capability of influencing sales 
and to collect this data for the identified geographies. The third step is to 
construct a regression model and generate results. Any adjustments to the 
variables are made until an acceptable correlation has been identified. Finally, 
the resulting forecast can be converted into monthly numbers by applying 

The Profitable Supply Chain
111
appropriate seasonal variables from existing markets, as well as ramp-up mod-
ifications to capture diffusion effects related to awareness. These steps are 
illustrated in Example 3-3.

Since the remodeling product provides additional structural space in the house, the 
forecaster believes that two factors that contribute to sales are housing units and 
household income. In particular, attached units in 1-4 unit structures, with tight space 
constraints, are the main target, and the relevant data is shown in the following table.

With this data, it is possible for the forecaster to perform a log-linear regression analysis 
of sales versus the demographic variables. The results of the analysis are shown in 
Figure 3-7.

The results indicate that the sales numbers have a strong correlation with housing units, 
and secondarily with income. Given the strong correlation from the combined model, it 
can be used for estimating sales for the new market. An example of the procedure for 
generating a sales forecast for the Dallas (Texas) metropolitan area are also shown.

Example 3-3 demonstrated the use of demographic information for the home 
remodeling industry. Products in other industries may be influenced by differ-
ent demographic factors. The guidelines provided in Table 3-3 may be used as 
a starting point for analysis.

In conclusion, demographic analysis can be useful for understanding the 
­business potential of new markets. The wealth of demographic information 
collected in most countries allows for the construction of insightful regres-
sion models. 
Weather Impact
Weather can have a significant impact on sales of products and services in 
several industries. Consider the following statement from Lennox International, 
a manufacturer of air conditioning and heating equipment:
Demand for our products and for our services is seasonal and strongly 
affected by the weather. Cooler than normal summers depress our sales 
of replacement air conditioning and refrigeration products and services. 
Similarly, warmer than normal winters have the same effect on our heating 
products and services
—Lennox International, Inc., 2013 Annual Report

Chapter 3 | Demand Planning
114
Such an impact is common for building material manufacturers. In addition, 
retail industry sales are also influenced by weather due to the impact of 
extreme weather conditions on consumer traffic. An insightful study into this 
subject has been provided in the paper, “The Effects of Weather on Retail 
Sales” by Martha Starr-McCluer.4 The method and findings of this paper are 
summarized as follows:
Consumer spending is captured using monthly retail sales 
• 
data from the U.S. Census Bureau, based on a survey of 
about 12,000 retail establishments.
Weather data is captured using 
• 
degree day data from the 
National Weather Service. According to this convention, 
a heating degree day occurs if the average temperature 
for a day exceeds 65 degrees Fahrenheit, and a cooling 
degree day occurs if the average temperature is below 
65 degrees Fahrenheit. For the entire United States, 
monthly heating and cooling degree days are computed 
as the population-weighted averages of degree days at 
the individual weather stations. Since the study focuses 
on temperatures that depart from seasonal norms, the 
degree days for a particular year are compared against 
the seven-year average.
The correlation between weather and retail sales is stud-
• 
ied using a regression model. The model takes several 
factors into account, including degree-day variances for 
four periods to account for lagged effects, real labor 
income, stock prices, and interest rates.
The results indicate that unusual weather has a modest 
• 
but significant role in explaining monthly sales fluctuations. 
The incremental R-square (coefficient of ­determination) 
is 9.7%, which is a measure of the level that weather 
impacted retail sales. As can be expected, the incremen-
tal R-square was highest for building materials (18.4%), 
general merchandise (21.3%), and restaurants (13.9%).
If the effects are significant at a macro-economic level, what about for ­individual 
companies? A logical argument would indicate that the effects should increase, 
due to substitution. At the product level, increase in consumer activity could 
result in an increased demand for a particular product. If that product is not in 
inventory, the consumer may settle for a substitutable product. In such cases, 
product and company sales are affected, even though aggregate sales are not.
4Martha Starr-McCluer, “The Effects of Weather on Retail Sales,” Federal Reserve Board 
of Governors, 2000.

The Profitable Supply Chain
115
While the paper describes a method for incorporating weather effects at an 
aggregate level (across broad product categories and geographies), developing 
models for specific products and locations requires a different approach that 
incorporates, in addition, recent sales history and location-specific effects. For a 
broad category of products and services, a common effect of weather is to modify 
demand patterns. Consider the construction industry: An unusually warm win-
ter can result in an early start for new house construction. An increase in 
the total units built for the year is not guaranteed, but the early start creates 
requirements for building material to be available earlier than usual.
Similarly, an early spring can result in early demand for spring clothing. If the 
retailer’s inventory is largely winter clothing, there is a high probability of los-
ing sales to competitors, with limited chance for recovery.
On an operational level, severe weather can cause certain purchases to be 
made earlier and stockpiled, for example, groceries. If the retailer is unpre-
pared, this can result in stockout situations for products such as milk, bread, 
and other food items.
For another category of products, weather can have a causal impact on 
demand, resulting in new demand that would otherwise not be present.  
A few popular examples include the effect of unusually cold temperatures on 
demand for new heaters and car batteries, and the impact of unusually warm 
temperatures on air conditioners. Several grocery items show similar trends, 
examples include ice creams, soups, and beverages. Apart from physical goods, 
the service industry is also impacted, for example repair services for air con-
ditioners, heaters, cars, and telecommunication equipment.

In Equation 3-12, i is the time period and DT is  the difference in observed 
temperature for period i from historical averages. Such a model can be used 
to estimate sales of products that are influenced by weather, such as air 
conditioners.
However, it might not be possible to get the desired level of accuracy from 
such a simple model. Challenges complicating the construction of detailed 
weather models include the following:
• 
Multiple weather variables. Weather can affect sales in 
many ways, by a combination of precipitation, tempera-
ture, wind, and extreme weather. The model needs to 
include all these variables and interactions.

Chapter 3 | Demand Planning
116
• 
Complex weather patterns. Weather effects can persist 
across daily and weekly periods, increasing the number of 
interactions and complexity.
• 
Large data volumes. Data requirements are significant, with 
data having to be collected for each city or geography, 
along with historical averages. An additional complication 
arises when demand is for a geography that covers sev-
eral cities. In this case, weather variables are to be calcu-
lated as the population-averaged temperature across all 
the cities. When a company has several hundreds or even 
thousands of products, it is quite an undertaking to build 
and maintain these models.
• 
Underlying inaccuracy in weather forecast. Yet another draw-
back with weather models is that predictions are made 
based on the weather forecast, which itself is subject to 
error. Due to this inherent lack of accuracy, even sophis-
ticated models that consider several weather factors may 
not deliver the anticipated improvement in accuracy.
While these challenges are obstacles, there are still ways to use weather for 
operational improvements. The model can be converted into simple rules 
that can provide a good balance between complexity and ease of use. For 
example, consider the guideline for demand for air conditioners: “Sales of 
entry-level air conditioners increase by 2% for every one-degree Fahrenheit 
increase in temperature above normal.” Such a guideline can easily be used to 
modify forecasts, because data requirements are minimal and can be collected 
easily.
When severe weather has the effect of shifting demand patterns, daily opera-
tional adjustments can be made without reliance on sophisticated mathemati-
cal models. Instead, making a simple adjustment to the forecast that increases 
demand levels prior to a storm, and decreases it during the storm will result 
in a better positioning of inventory. For example, consider demand for certain 
grocery items. While smaller storms may have little impact on purchasing pat-
terns, snowstorms that pose the threat of inhibiting consumer mobility will 
alter buying patterns and result in milk purchases being made earlier.
In conclusion, weather can have a significant impact on demand for products 
for which precipitation and temperature have a causal effect. For other prod-
ucts, weather mainly has the impact of shifting the timing of demand, which 
can be addressed using safety stock. Extreme weather conditions will require 
special attention since inventory buffers may be insufficient.

Economic Indicators
Theoretically, almost every company can benefit by considering one or more 
economic indicators of market conditions into the forecasting process. These 
indicators include, for example, retail sales and inventories, manufacturer 
shipment and inventories, unemployment, housing permits, and the consumer 
price index. The following excerpt from an annual report of a construction 
materials manufacturer provides an indication of how market conditions can 
impact a business:
For the new residential construction market, housing starts are a very 
good indicator of demand for our gypsum products. Installation of our 
gypsum products typically follows the start of construction by one to two 
months.
Demand for our products from new nonresidential construction is 
determined by floor space for which contracts are signed. Installation 
of gypsum and ceilings products typically follows signing of construction 
contracts by about 12 to 18 months. According to McGraw-Hill 
Construction’s most recent construction market forecast, total floor space 
for which new nonresidential construction contracts were signed in the 
United States increased 5% in 2013 compared with 2012.
The repair and remodel market includes renovation of both residential 
and nonresidential buildings. The generally rising levels of existing home 
sales and home resale values in 2012, and continuing into 2013, have 
contributed to an increase in demand for our products from the residential 
repair and remodel market in 2013.
—United States Gypsum Corporation, 2013 Annual Report
The report indicates that various indicators of construction activity can be 
used to adjust forecasts and improve accuracy. The use of such data for long-
term projections of market size is well addressed. However, the utility of such 
data to short-term, product-level forecasting is constrained by the following 
considerations:
• 
Industry categories are too broad. Several of the indicators 
are specified at the national level, or for an industry that 
encompasses several categories of products. As a result, 
it is not clear how to translate a change in the economic 
variable into a change in demand for a specific product 
and geography. For example, retail sales for electronic 
items may trend up in a particular month, but the implica-
tions of this change for trendy music players may be very 
different from staid alarm clocks.

Chapter 3 | Demand Planning
118
• 
Delay in disseminating data. Most indicators are collected 
based on polls and surveys of businesses. The delay due 
to data collection and dissemination to the public makes 
some of the information useless for forecasting purposes. 
For example, a forecaster for a manufacturing company 
will have little to gain from a report that states that two-
month prior retail sales have decreased, since the com-
pany’s backlog would already reflect that trend.
To use economic indicators effectively, a company needs to follow a proce-
dure for identifying indicators that are important to the business and capable 
of providing insight, given the timing of its updates. The properties of a selec-
tion of such indicators are shown in Table 3-4.

Table 3-4 characterizes indicators in a descriptive manner, but it is possible for 
the relationship to be expressed quantitatively using regression. The lag is the 
time it takes to impact demand after the indicator has changed. For example, 
if an increase in building permits in a particular month results in an increase 
in demand three months later, the lag is three months. Latency refers to the 
time taken to report data. Because building permit data in the United States 
is released by the U.S. Census Bureau in the third week of a month for the 
prior month, the latency is three weeks. If the latency is greater than the lag, 
the economic indicator provides no new information that the company is not 
already aware of. From the table, building permits and interest rates provide 
information that allows the company sufficient time to adjust supply levels 
according to demand, while retail sales provide no benefit due to the high 
latency present in collecting and disseminating the data.

The Profitable Supply Chain
119
The two indicators, building permits and interest rates, are both plausibly sug-
gestive, but it is necessary to ensure that there is no interdependence between 
them. Because interest rates can affect applications for building permits, it 
may not be necessary or accurate to include both in the forecasting process. 
Instead, permits alone can be used because the information is provided at the 
detailed city-level, allowing for greater accuracy in evaluating the impact of 
interest rates on different regions and capturing pockets of development.
The list of pertinent indicators can look different for other products in the 
same industry. For example, the insight provided by building permits will be 
less useful for concrete due to the one month lag between permitting and the 
demand for concrete. Clearly, the larger the difference between the lag and 
the latency, the more useful the indicator.
To understand how economic indicators can be used in forecasting, quarterly 
revenue numbers from some publicly traded companies may be fit to quar-
terly building permit data using Equation 3-13:

In Equation 3-13, t is time, k is the lag in quarters, and Pt-k is the lagged build-
ing permits. If k is equal to 0, then there is no lag at a quarterly level. If k = 1, 
then there is a lag of a quarter. An application of this model is demonstrated 
in Example 3-4, with revenues for selected public companies being related to 
building permits.
EXAMPLE 3-4: IMPACT OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY ON 
REVENUES
In this example, revenue data from public companies is used to evaluate the impact of 
leading economic indicators. In general, such an analysis will not yield good results due 
to the many nuances that influence reported revenues, such as revenue recognition, 
quarterly data, accounting rules, and product diversification. However, this example 
serves the useful purpose of clarifying how a model can be constructed using the 
identified indicators.
The significance of housing activity on four companies is studied—Lennox International, 
Weyerhaeuser, Pittsburgh Paints, and Best Buy. Lennox is a manufacturer of air 
conditioners and sells to the home builders as well as to retail channels. Weyerhaeuser 
manufactures lumber products for homebuilders and retail channels. Pittsburgh Paints 
is a large paint manufacturer, again with a diversified customer base. Finally, Best Buy 
is an electronics retailer. The reason for including Best Buy in the study to test the 
hypothesis that purchases of big ticket electronic items are linked to purchases of new 
homes.

For each of the companies, 15 quarters of revenue data is collected from the respective 
annual reports (from Q1 2003 until Q3 2006) and permit data is obtained from the U.S. 
Census Bureau. An example of this data for one of the companies, Lennox, is shown 
in Table 3-5.

The results of applying the regression model are summarized in Figure 3-8.

The results reveal that the inclusion of permits from the current quarter has been 
successful in explaining an additional 9% of revenue behavior as compared to the 
model that ignores the effect of permits. On the other hand, inclusion of permits lagged 
by one quarter has no effect on the results, indicating that the products manufactured 
by Lennox are sold to home builders within 3 months of permitting. A similar analysis is 
performed for the remaining companies and the results are summarized in Table 3-6.

The results are mixed. As expected, including permit data improves model performance 
for Weyerhaeuser and Lennox, although the remaining unexplained variance for 
Weyerhaeuser is large. The results for Pittsburgh Paints indicate that the proportion 
of the company’s business attributed to construction activity is minimal. The results 
from Best Buy are interesting and support the hypothesis that purchases of large 
ticket electronic items are linked to new home sales, approximately 6 months after 
permitting.

Chapter 3 | Demand Planning
122
This example reveals that certain insight into demand may be obtained by 
utilizing construction data. The use of quarterly numbers reduces the value 
from the model since a zero lag provides no advance visibility. However, use of 
monthly product sales and construction data may address this issue.
In conclusion, economic indicators are very useful in capturing nationwide trends 
in business. However, demand for a product can be heavily influenced by local 
trends that are contrary to macroeconomic indicators. Therefore, when avail-
able, micro-economic data is useful for generating detailed product forecasts.
Distortion of Demand Information
When a company sells directly to the consumer, it is possible to get a first-
hand view of demand. However, when a company sells its products to manu-
facturers and distribution partners, the partner’s demand signal is often used 
as a proxy for consumer demand. A few of the challenges related to indirect 
sales are captured in an annual report of Hewlett-Packard:
We must manage inventory effectively, particularly with respect to sales 
to distributors, which involves forecasting demand and pricing issues. 
Distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages, 
cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of 
new products. Distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the 
supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal 
fluctuations in end-user demand. Our reliance upon indirect distribution 
methods may reduce visibility to demand and pricing issues, and therefore 
make forecasting more difficult. If we have excess or obsolete inventory, 
we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory. Moreover, 
our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability 
to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by 
competitors. We also may have limited ability to estimate future product 
rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively.
—Hewlett-Packard Company, 2007 Annual Report
A phenomenon, often referred to as the bullwhip effect, states that demand 
information is distorted as it is communicated by partners.6 Distortion does 
not occur due to willful actions on part of the partner, but due to each entity 
attempting to deal with the observed demand in isolation. Some of the com-
mon reasons for distortion are a lack of awareness of the composition of 
demand, multiple forecast updates, and replenishment and ordering policies. 
This distortion is illustrated in Examples 3-5 and 3-6, which are followed by a 
detailed discussion of the reasons.

Management Review 38 (3): 93-102, 1997.

EXAMPLE 3-5: INFORMATION DISTORTION DUE TO A 
PULSE DEMAND SIGNAL
Consider the situation of a retail sourcing goods from a manufacturer. In turn, the 
manufacturer purchases raw material from a supplier. The retailer’s demand for  
the product is a steady 100 units per week, except for a particular week when a 
promotion has increased the sales by 10 units. The demand reverts to 100 units for 
subsequent weeks. Furthermore, the retailer is supplied immediately by the manufacturer  
(i.e., a zero lead time), the manufacturer has a 1-week lead time for parts, and the 
supplier has a 2-week lead time for raw material.
First, the manufacturer’s inventory positions are examined: Since the manufacturer has 
planned for a steady demand for 100 units, the increase by 10 units will reduce inventory 
positions and require additional supplies. Also, the manufacturer calculates a demand 
forecast based on a 2-week moving average of the retailer’s orders. This results in a 
forecast for the next week of 105 units. Given the 1-week lead time for part supply, the 
order placed by the manufacturer is calculated as
Part order = Cycle stock + Safety stock = 105 + 10 = 115 units.
Next, the part supplier’s inventory positions are examined. The increase in demand 
as seen by the supplier is 15 units, which depletes safety stock by the same level.  
The supplier calculates a demand forecast based on a 2-week moving average of the 
manufacturer’s orders, which results in a forecast for raw material of 108 units. Given the 
2-week lead time for part supply, the order placed by the manufacturer is calculated as:
Raw material order = Cycle stock + Safety stock = 108 + 15 = 123 units.
The propagation of the demand signal across the stages in the supply chain is shown 
in Figure 3-9.

Chapter 3 | Demand Planning
124
A few observations can be made from the results. The first is that the initial fluctuations 
of orders for the part and raw material are larger than the increase in demand. In order 
to compensate for these additional units ordered, there is a decrease in the order 
quantity in subsequent periods. The magnitude and duration of fluctuations increase as 
the signal propagates further along the supply chain.
The second observation is that the extent of distortion is affected by lead times. 
The lead times in the example were set to 1 week for the part and 2 weeks for the 
raw material. If these are increased to 2 and 4 weeks, respectively, the associated 
magnitude of distortion is significantly different. The part order increases from 15% to 
20%, while the raw material order increases from 23% to 39%. The difference is due to 
the accumulation of forecast errors over the lead time. Therefore, the adverse impact of 
distortion increases with increasing lead times.
The example uses two-period moving averages to compute the forecast, which 
results in a forecast that is very responsive to new trends and increases the 
magnitude of distortion. It is enticing to think that the use of four- or eight-
period moving averages or other such methods can reduce the magnitude of 
the fluctuations. However, an increase in damping introduces distortion when 
the change in demand is sustained, as illustrated in Example 3-6.
Figure 3-9.  Distortion of information due to the demand pulse in Example 3-5

The Profitable Supply Chain
125
EXAMPLE 3-6: INFORMATION DISTORTION DUE TO 
SUSTAINED CHANGE IN DEMAND
The supply chain is identical to Example 3-5, except that the retailer experiences a 
permanent increase from 100 to 110 units per week due to the opening of a new store. 
Additionally, the manufacturer and supplier generate forecasts using 4-week moving 
averages (as opposed to the 2-week moving averages used in the previous example).
The manufacturer’s and supplier’s inventory positions are examined according to the 
procedure described in the previous example, and the resulting signals are shown in 
Figure 3-10.
Figure 3-10.  Distortion of information due to a demand pulse (Example 3-6)
Since the demand increase is sustained, the orders fluctuate and gradually settle at a 
level equal to the increased demand. While the magnitude of the fluctuations are lower 
due to the use of 4-week moving averages, additional time is required to reach steady 
state. Indeed, if 8-week moving averages are used, the fluctuations would continue for 
several additional periods.

Chapter 3 | Demand Planning
126
In conclusion, information distortion cannot be solved using a highly damped 
or a responsive forecasting method. Instead, it is necessary to understand the 
sources of distortion and deal with them accordingly. Some common causes 
of distortion are discussed in the following sections.
Demand Unawareness
The total demand number is actually a combination of several underlying 
sources and mechanisms, such as retail store sales and contract sales to busi-
nesses. Distortion can occur when a single forecasting method is applied to 
all categories indiscriminately. For example, a large one-time sale will result 
in a pulse demand signal. Time series methods should not be used for this 
category of demand.
For the purposes of understanding distortion, demand may be divided into 
two categories—recurring and nonrecurring. Recurring demand refers to 
the portion of demand that is captured adequately by historical data and is 
expected to repeat over time, such as sales of an established product at an 
existing store. Time series forecasting methods are well suited for dealing 
with recurring demand.
Nonrecurring demand includes sources and causes that are not expected to 
repeat in the near future. This includes special contract sales (such as one-
time sales to large customers), initial stock at a new facility, and one-time 
purchases for store displays. Since this category of demand is not expected to 
recur in the near future, the nonrecurring volume needs to be removed from 
overall demand numbers before applying a time series method. A pulse signal, 
illustrated in Example 3-5, is an example of nonrecurring demand.
Promotions can increase demand temporarily and surprise the uninformed 
manufacturer. Promotional demand is nonrecurring and needs to be flagged 
accordingly. However, inventory planning may need to be performed differ-
ently for promotions if the increase in demand is accompanied by a brief lull 
following the promotion.
The lack of awareness of demand sources is not restricted to interactions 
between companies, but can exist even within a company. For example, it 
is quite common for marketing to communicate only an aggregate demand 
number to the supply chain analyst, without any additional details regarding 
sources or categories or demand. While communications in a company can 
be improved relatively easily by requiring a dialogue between marketing and 
SCM as part of the forecasting process, it is a bigger issue when multiple 
companies are involved. In order for retailers, distributors, and manufacturers 
to improve demand visibility, a structured collaborative forecasting process is 
required. 

The Profitable Supply Chain
127
The importance of segmenting non-recurring demand is illustrated in 
Figure 3-11, where data for weeks 2 and 3 have been skewed by one-time 
orders. If forecasts are generated using 6-week moving averages, the difference 
in forecasts generated based on total demand as compared to only recurring 
demand can be significant.
Figure 3-11. The importance of segmenting nonrecurring demand in forecasting
Multiple Forecast Updates
An increase in the number of entities involved in generating or modifying the 
forecast is often accompanied by an increase in the bias, and eventually, distor-
tions. If a manufacturer has access to actual sales or point-of-sale (POS) data, 
the manufacturer’s forecast can be generated by applying appropriate methods 
(for example, time series). Some of the advantages of using POS data are:
• 
Good visibility. POS data provides a view of actual con-
sumer demand, undistorted by biases and ordering poli-
cies utilized by the retailer.
• 
Frequent updates. The regular communication of orders 
and forecasts provide manufacturers with visibility to 
trends only on a weekly or monthly basis. POS data pro-
vides the manufacturer immediate visibility to changes 
and allows actions to be taken several days or weeks in 
advance. 

Chapter 3 | Demand Planning
128
The fine-grained demand information provided by POS data can provide 
valuable insights regarding buying trends, and can be used to plan promotions 
and placement of inventory by region or by the days of the week. Furthermore, 
availability of POS data can lead to vendor-managed inventory (VMI), with the 
supplier being given the responsibility of maintaining the targeted inventory 
and customer service levels. However, there are challenges in using POS data, 
such as: 
• 
High data volumes. Since POS information is collected at a 
store level, this often results in extremely large volumes 
of data.
• 
Lead time mismatches. If the manufacturer replenishes 
the retailer’s distribution center, then there is a time lag 
between sales data and replenishments. Therefore, the 
analyst needs to explicitly account for these time lags 
before acting on POS data.
• 
Lack of context. POS data can be misleading due to incom-
plete information. For example, no sales for a day could 
be due to a lack of movement of the product, or due to 
a stockout situation. If it is due to the latter, a forecast 
generated using time series methods can result in mis-
alignment between the demand and supply.
The first issue requires that the manufacturer deploy a system that can col-
lect and process the data to ensure speedy processing and aggregation. Such 
a system is critical for continued use of POS data, since it can help deal with 
operational issues such as a store not reporting sales, or the addition of new 
stores.
The second issue related to misleading data needs to be addressed by under-
standing the nature of the issue. Consider the issue related to no sales 
being reported at a particular store for the duration of a day or more (see 
Figure 3-12). This situation can arise due to a malfunctioning POS system or 
due to an out-of-stock (OOS) situation. In both cases, the POS data does not 
reflect the true demand. In such cases, the POS data needs to be adjusted to 
reflect missed demand for those days; for example, the prior 8-week average 
sales can be used.

The Profitable Supply Chain
129
However, if there are consistently days with no sales, this could be due to poor 
inventory management or due to sporadic demand for the product. For the 
former, adjusting POS data to fill in low-sale days will improve results. For the 
latter, adjusting sales will only increase shelf inventory without additional sales. 
Therefore, it is important to determine the reason for low values. Often, the 
forecaster can provide the necessary insight from experience and an under-
standing of the retail situation. Alternatively, the cause can be determined by 
studying inventory levels in the store to determine if sufficient stock existed. 
If the manufacturer ships its goods directly to the store (direct-store delivery), 
this inventory information will be readily available. Otherwise, if the store is a 
high revenue generator, merchandising personnel can perform the store visit. 
Finally, POS data alone cannot provide all the information required to estimate 
future demand. Since demand is affected by promotions and price, as well as 
the introduction of new markets or additional units for display purposes, POS 
data needs to be augmented with collaborative forecasting to capture any 
additional information.
In conclusion, point-of-sale data can provide valuable insights and reduce 
out-of-stock situations. However, challenges related to the volume and qual-
ity of data need to be addressed before the information can be used with 
confidence.

Ordering and Replenishment Policies
Distortion can also be introduced due to improper inventory management 
and replenishment processes on the part of the channel partner. Some exam-
ples of channel partner actions that introduce distortion include:
• 
A regular and rigorous inventory review process is not fol-
lowed. If the reviews are done arbitrarily or infrequently, 
the result is irregular ordering patterns that will distort 
the demand signal sent to the suppliers.
• 
Resorting to shortage gaming. This refers to ordering more 
than required due to perceived component or capac-
ity shortages, with the hope that partial shipments will 
meet the original requirements. These inflated require-
ments result in orders that are not aligned with demand 
and cause long-term misalignment between demand and 
capacity.
• 
Frequent changes to safety stock levels. If safety stock is 
specified in proportion to demand, distortions will get 
magnified. Therefore, the commonly used method of 
specifying safety stock as days of inventory will magnify 
distortion. The reason for specifying safety stock as a 
proportion of demand is the assurance that safety stock 
will automatically adjust as demand volumes and patterns 
change. While a quantity specification of safety stock will 
reduce distortion, it introduces the need to frequently 
review demand patterns and reset safety stock levels to 
ensure adequate inventory. 
• 
Sourcing the same material from multiple suppliers. The use 
of two or even three sources of supply for important 
components is often undertaken in order to limit expo-
sure to disruptions due to a single supplier. However, 
methods for dividing demand across these suppliers are 
frequently performed in an ad hoc manner and mainly 
based on economic order quantities for the buyer. The 
result is that each supplier may perceive the demand to 
be lumpy and uneven across time periods, even though 
the total demand and the portion allocated to each sup-
plier is fairly even. Based on this lumpy demand, it is easy 
for the supplier to generate a demand forecast that is not 
aligned to the true demand. 

The Profitable Supply Chain
131
One method for addressing these issues is the use of vendor managed inventory 
(VMI). VMI is a method for the supplier to take ownership of maintaining the 
appropriate inventory levels at the partner’s facilities. This transfer of respon-
sibility can be mutually beneficial—the channel partner can simply dictate the 
requirements related to inventory or customer service levels and shift the 
onus of meeting those targets to the supplier. In turn, the supplier is provided 
visibility to inventory positions without distortion by ordering rules.
However, VMI does not replace the need for visibility to sales sources and 
categories. If the supplier has visibility to inventory consumption at only an 
aggregate level, the same issues related to forecasting remain. For this reason, 
the availability of point-of-sale data is a great enabler. Additionally, in situations 
when a fundamental change in demand trends is anticipated, the channel part-
ner needs to provide the supplier a notification of the event (e.g., a promo-
tion) or a forecast (e.g., for a new store opening). 
Furthermore, VMI does not solve the problem introduced when multiple sup-
pliers are used for the same material, since the schedule for consuming each 
supplier’s inventory may not be clear. In this situation, it is necessary for the 
buyer to communicate a demand forecast and a specification of timing of 
orders or economic order quantities to each of the suppliers. In turn, the sup-
pliers need to utilize this forecast in order to reconcile sporadic consumption 
of inventory and create a smoothed production plan that can be used to align 
capacity and inventories. 
Pyramid Forecasting
Before beginning the discussion on aligning demand, it is instructive to under-
stand the different ways in which demand is perceived by different people in 
the company. While marketing tends to think of demand in terms of a product 
line or platform, sales is more focused on specific products for a customer. 
Similarly, finance thinks in terms of monetary value of demand, while manu-
facturing is concerned with volume or units. Some of these perspectives are 
summarized in Figure 3-13.
Figure 3-13.  Examples of demand perspectives

Chapter 3 | Demand Planning
132
It is clear that each division thinks of demand differently—while the supply 
chain organizations think in terms of specify products and locations, other 
organizations tend to perceive demand in aggregate terms. These differing 
views are an impediment to aligning demand and supply in a company. For 
example, sales may specify only the financial forecast for a region; since the 
supply chain organization needs to manufacture a product in order to meet 
the financial forecast, the financial numbers are converted into a unit forecast 
for each product. If the sales team is unaware of the specific product forecasts, 
situations can arise when sales meets financial projections, but with a product 
mix that is very different from what is being produced in the factories. The 
result is a mismatch between demand and supply.
While there is a need for organizational alignment, the solution is not to 
make all organizations think in terms of the stock keeping unit (SKU). Not only 
would that require a fundamental change in behavior; it would also reduce the 
benefit provided by the additional insight and perspective from the rest of the 
organization. Instead, the better solution, illustrated in Figure 3-14, is to rapidly 
reconcile the different viewpoints by aggregating and disaggregating demand 
to support the different perspectives.
Figure 3-14.  Pyramid forecasting

Categorization is a discipline that evaluates different ways of organizing 
demand in order to gain insight. Examples of different categories include:
• 
Product characteristics or attributes. This includes specific 
product features that can appeal to consumers. Examples 
are low-carbohydrate content in food items, portability 
for electronic goods, and sizes for apparel.
• 
Demographic characteristics. Geographic and economic 
segmentation, when combined with specific product 
characteristics, can provide unanticipated insight based 
on demographics. This can help with targeted market-
ing, promotions planning, as well as new product and 
new market forecasting. Examples include categorizing 
demand according to sales to different age groups.
• 
Production characteristics. Production modes can help 
identify trends related to customization and lead time 
preferences. A common example is build-to-stock versus 
configure-to-order for some electronic goods.
• 
Lifecycle characteristics. Yet another way to categorize 
products is based on demand patterns—for example, 
when a set of products is new or being phased out or 
when advertising is positively impacting demand. Such 
a categorization can be used to apply demand trends 
based on inputs from the marketing organization, and 
is an alternative method to the use of trend-based time   
series forecasts. 
There are several benefits provided by a well-executed pyramid forecasting 
process, captured in Table 3-7. Implemented properly, the process will result 
in greater alignment between the different organizations, increase the sense 
of ownership of various aspects of demand, and improve visibility across prod-
ucts, product groups, and regions. 

Chapter 3 | Demand Planning
134
In conclusion, pyramid forecasting can benefit a company by promoting 
alignment among the different individuals and groups. Once the decision 
to initiate this process is taken, the following steps provide a guideline for 
implementation. 
1.	 Identify demand perspectives and characteristics. Perspectives 
need to accommodate the requirements of the different 
organizations in the company, while characteristics pro-
vide a logical way to organize products in order to gain 
insights.
2.	 Specify rules for aggregation and disaggregation. While aggre-
gation is a well-understood procedure, disaggregation 
requires some deliberation. For example, how should an 
increase in the revenue target for a product category be 
divided across the individual products? Commonly used 
methods include maintaining product-level ratios, favor-
ing heavily promoted products, or favoring high-margin 
products.
3.	 Specify the steps to finalize the forecast. A mismatch between 
the numbers at any level in the hierarchy requires a 
review and reconciliation procedure that is acceptable to 
all parties.

4.	 Utilize software tools for efficiency. Develop or purchase 
software tools (such as spreadsheets or software appli-
cations) for gathering data, generating reports, and per-
forming the reconciliation on a regular basis. While the 
use of simple spreadsheets may suffice for a few products, 
most businesses require systems to manage the process 
for many hundreds of products.
5.	 Ensure participation. The success of this forecasting pro-
cess is dependent on the continued involvement of key 
managers from different organizations on a monthly 
basis.
6.	 Monitor performance. As the business environment changes 
and new products and customers are introduced, it may 
become necessary to modify perspectives, categories, 
and review procedures. Therefore, a periodic assessment 
(usually quarterly or semiannually) is important for the 
continued success of the process. 
Forecasting Systems
When a company has several hundreds or thousands of products, the only  
viable approach is to perform the analysis frequently using a forecasting system. 
Some of the desirable factors of a forecasting system include the following:
Support for defining different hierarchies for viewing 
• 
demand, units, product categories, and the ability to aggre-
gate and disaggregate demand according to specific rules.
Ability to generate statistical forecast by applying time 
• 
series methods. A good system will provide inbuilt ability 
to forecast at the SKU level, as well as at any of the group 
and characteristic levels defined above.
Ability to include external data, such as economic indica-
• 
tors, for regression analysis at the SKU, group, or charac-
teristic levels.
Ability to combine two or more characteristics, and view 
• 
demand and forecast for the combination. Such a feature 
can provide the analyst with valuable trend information 
related to specific product aspects that are of importance 
to customers.
The ability to perform “what if” simulations, with users 
• 
evaluating the impact of changes before broadcasting 
changes to the entire company. 

Chapter 3 | Demand Planning
136
Clearly, the complete set of system requirements will exceed the brief 
list shown above, and will need to consider specific product and industry  
considerations. It is recommended that each company follow a rigorous  
process of specifying the demand planning process and create an appropriate 
list of system requirements.
Demand Collaboration
The need for the communication of information between the retailer and the 
manufacturer has been mentioned in the previous discussions on distortion 
of demand. Collaborative planning, forecasting, and replenishment (CPFR)—
the framework for this collaborative process and exchange of information 
mentioned in Chapter 1—has been proposed by the industry organization, 
Voluntary Interindustry Commerce Solution (VICS). The initial version of this 
process, then called collaborative forecasting and replenishment (CFAR), was ini-
tiated between Walmart and Warner-Lambert in 1995. The process allowed 
for sales and order forecasts for Listerine mouthwash products to be shared, 
with inconsistencies between the two numbers being highlighted. These 
inconsistencies were due to events such as Walmart promotions that had 
the capability of increasing demand significantly. Prior to the implementation 
of this process, Warner-Lambert, not being able to anticipate these swings, 
would maintain substantial inventory. The collaboration resulted in Walmart 
specifying orders six weeks in advance to match the six-week manufacturing 
lead time for Listerine. This allowed Warner-Lambert to smooth production 
and for Walmart to improve in-stock from 85 to 98% and reduce inventories 
by 25%.7
The CPFR model is divided into three phases—the planning phase, forecast-
ing phase, and the replenishment phase. In total, there are nine steps in the 
process, summarized below.
The first two steps, termed the planning phase, are related to the development 
of the collaborative arrangement and the creation of the joint business plan. 
The agreement sets the objectives for the business partners and then defines 
the actions and necessary resources. It also identifies how the performance of 
the respective parties will be measured. The business plan specifies contract 
information for the products, including details regarding the minimum order 
quantity, order lead time, and the frequency of ordering. 
7For additional information, see the VICS website and books on the subject such as Dick 
Siefert, Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment: How to Create Supply Chain 
Advantage (McGraw Hill, 2006).

The Profitable Supply Chain
137
The third through eighth steps are termed the forecasting phase. The third 
step in the process is to generate the sales forecast, based on the POS data 
and promotion planning. The fourth step is to identify exceptions to the sales 
forecast, based on the previously defined acceptance criteria. The fifth step is 
to collaborate and resolve these exceptions, and results in the generation of a 
new forecast. The sixth step is to create the order forecast, based on the sales 
forecast and inventory policies and destination for the products. The seventh 
step identifies exceptions to the order forecast, while the eighth step resolves 
these exceptions. The final step in the process is the replenishment phase, and 
results in the conversion of the order forecast into a firm order. 
The CPFR model promotes structured communication between partners, 
a clear specification of the type and detail of information that needs to be 
communicated, and a platform for resolving differences. However, the imple-
mentation of CPFR can prove challenging in situations involving several thou-
sands of products and locations, due to data issues and the manual effort 
required to manage numerous forecasts and exceptions. In response, compa-
nies have resorted to the use of fewer steps in order to simplify the process. 
Irrespective of the specific steps implemented, the value provided by collabo-
ration in reducing inventories and increasing sales is indisputable.
Summary
Demand planning is the important process of specifying an accurate  
estimate of the market’s demand for a company’s products, and for ensuring 
that scarce supplies are utilized to meet demand in the best possible manner. 
This chapter has presented several methods for generating a demand forecast, 
including time series, collaborative, causal, and pyramid methods. The com-
parative advantages and disadvantages of these four methods are summarized 
in Table 3-8. 

Chapter 3 | Demand Planning
138
Demand planning is not new—it has been performed in some manner by all 
businesses with or without the use of computers and sophisticated math-
ematics. However, this process will continue to evolve as new information 
becomes available, new ways of interacting with the customer are initiated, 
and novel methods to influence markets and the consumer are developed.  
A few developments that can have an impact on the demand planning process 
are:
The increasing availability of new information related to 
• 
economic trends and business activity. The growth in the 
use of the Internet allows for this information to be col-
lected in an expeditious manner, which can increase the 
applicability and value of the information.
The increasing use of radio frequency identification (RFID) 
• 
to track movement of goods and sales. This technology 
provides a wealth of consumer-related information and 
can improve short-term forecast accuracy. However, 
challenges related to large data volumes and accuracy will 
have to be resolved before this becomes routine.

Consumer loyalty programs that provide important 
• 
information regarding preferences, buying patterns, and 
pent-up demand. The information collected can be used 
for forecasting, targeted marketing and promotions, and 
for influencing demand.
Technological advancements that will result in new 
• 
demand-fulfillment mechanisms. Such new methods have 
the promise of allowing businesses to reach consumers 
in a more direct manner and gain valuable insight into 
usage patterns.
Even as the availability of demand information grows and systems become more 
sophisticated, there is no perfect way to predict the future and forecast error 
cannot be eliminated. In fact, a forecasting process that remains unchanged 
over time will deteriorate in quality due to changes in the marketplace that 
invalidate one or more assumptions made by the models. Therefore, it is 
important that an adjustment procedure be used to align supply to changes 
in demand and make changes to model parameters (see discussions of such 
a procedure in Chapters 5 and 7). Attention to these different aspects of 
demand planning can help a company gain a better understanding of demand 
and the customer and thereby increase market share and profitability.

Supply Planning
Supply planning is the process of specifying production and inventory levels 
in order to meet projected demand. It is a fundamental step for all goods-
producing companies, and has been performed in one form or other since the 
advent of mass production. The reorder point (ROP) approach, still in vogue 
today, has been practiced since the industrial revolution. The Toyota Production 
System (TPS), introduced in the 1950s, was a revolutionary approach that 
helped rethink the flow of materials in a factory. The next development of 
note was material requirements planning (MRP), developed in 1964 by Joseph 
Orlicky. MRP is a rigorous demand-driven approach to coordinating material 
requirements across finished goods, sub-assemblies, and raw materials. The 
advent of advanced planning systems (APS) in the 1990s helped address some 
of the drawbacks of MRP, especially related to multisite production facilities 
and capacity constraints.
A drawback present in all supply planning systems is that they make several 
assumptions related to supplier operations, including production capacity and 
the time taken to manufacture. As supply chains have become leaner, plan-
ners have found that several of the issues adversely affecting supply plans are 
attributable to incorrect estimates of supplier operations. These issues are 
addressed by collaborating with suppliers to share plans and gain an under-
standing of suppliers’ real constraints. However, there are no uniform formal 
processes for company–supplier collaboration, and a supplier that sells prod-
uct to several customers may have to collaborate according to very different 
processes and formats. One of the objectives of this chapter is to provide a 
process framework for collaboration that the author has developed based on 
his work with several large manufacturers.

The Importance of Supply Planning
For a company that sells products, the importance of ordering supplies in a 
timely manner to ensure adequate inventories is paramount. Consider the 
following quote from an annual report of Lowe’s, the home improvement 
company, about this topic:
Our financial performance could suffer if we fail to properly maintain our 
critical information systems or if those systems are seriously disrupted: 
An important part of our efforts to achieve efficiencies, cost reductions, 
and sales and cash flow growth is the identification and implementation 
of improvements to our management information systems to improve 
operations such as inventory replenishment systems, merchandise ordering, 
transportation, and receipt processing. Our financial performance could be 
adversely affected if our management information systems are seriously 
disrupted or we are unable to improve, upgrade, maintain, and expand 
our systems.
—Lowe’s Companies Inc., 2013 Annual Report
Indeed, inventory planning and demand planning both require the final step of 
replenishment and supply for execution of the plan. This chapter addresses 
the following questions:
What is the quantity that needs to be ordered for a par-
• 
ticular product at any given time?
How can inventories at distribution centers be taken 
• 
into consideration while creating production schedules 
at manufacturing plants?
How can demand be used to drive orders for raw 
• 
materials?
How can the coordination of activities with suppliers be 
• 
improved?
There are three types of models for generating supply orders—replenishment, 
requirements planning, and constraints-based planning. Replenishment models gen-
erate orders for a single item based on a fixed order quantity (continuous 
review replenishment) or a fixed interval for review (periodic review replenish-
ment). Requirements planning models  consider linkages between inventory and 
demand at various stages in the supply chain in order to determine order 
quantities. Examples include MRP and distribution resource planning (DRP). 
Constraints-based planning models build on requirements planning but add 
capabilities related to constraint identification and resolution. These three 
models are described in turn in the following sections. 

The Profitable Supply Chain
143
The Supply Planning Process
The supply planning process is often managed by the manufacturing depart-
ment of a company. The main functions of supply planning are:
• 
Requirements planning. The steps to convert the demand 
plan into a production and purchasing signal, considering 
on-hand inventories, production and transportation lead 
times, production capacity, and safety stock targets.
• 
Supply collaboration. The activities related to communicat-
ing the supply plan to key suppliers, and the subsequent 
exchanges to ensure that the schedules can be supported 
by the supplier in a timely manner.
The flow of information and interactions between the various steps is shown 
in Figure 4-1, for a company that relies on requirements planning for generat-
ing the supply plan. This procedure needs to be modified to suit a company’s 
specific needs. For example, a company with several manufacturing plants 
needs to introduce a step in which the plant managers review the production 
plans and decide whether production needs to be off-loaded from one plant 
to another based on capacity and other considerations.

Chapter 4 | Supply Planning
144
Replenishment Models
Replenishment models are of two types—continuous review or periodic 
review. Continuous reviews result in a reorder at the instant when inventory 
levels reach a certain level, called the reorder point. Periodic reviews evaluate 
inventory position at specific intervals in time and inform the placement of 
orders to attain a target inventory level.
Figure 4-1. The supply planning process

The Profitable Supply Chain
145
Continuous Review Replenishment
The continuous review model is often denoted as the (r, Q) policy, where r is 
the reorder point and Q is the reorder quantity. In many situations, Q is deter-
mined as the economic order quantity (EOQ), discussed in Chapter 2.
Once the EOQ and the safety stock target have been determined, the reorder 
point is calculated by Equation 4-1.

Example 4-1 describes these calculations in detail.
EXAMPLE 4-1: AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE (R, Q) 
CONTINUOUS REPLENISHMENT POLICY
The demand forecast for a product is 100 units per week, and the forecast error is 
20%. Supply variability can be ignored. A 98% service level is desired, and the supply 
lead time is 2 weeks. The company determines that the economic order quantity is 
400 units.
 
Determining the Reorder Point
 
The safety stock is determined using the Service Level method for the 2-week lead time 
to be (2.06 * 20 * 
2 ) = 58 units (where 2.06 is the factor for the 98% service level). 
The reorder point is calculated from Eq. 4-1 as follows:
 
 Reorder point = Demand over lead time + Safety stock
               = 2*100 + 58  = 258 units.
 

Chapter 4 | Supply Planning
146
The average inventory is calculated to be (400/2 + 58) = 258 units, and the duration 
between shipments is (400/100) = 4 weeks. The anticipated inventory profile is shown 
in Figure 4-2. 
Figure 4-2. An illustration of continuous review replenishment

The Profitable Supply Chain
147
Periodic Review Replenishment
The periodic review model is often denoted as the (t, S) policy, where t is the 
review interval and S is the order upto level (OUL). The lead time is modified 
to include both the supply lead time and the review interval,
	
Total leadtime

The average order size is calculated by the identity,

Since the total lead time is greater than the lead time for supply, the average

review system. The average inventory is calculated by the formula,

(4-7)
Because orders are initiated upon review, the duration between shipments is 
the review interval. Example 4-2 describes these calculations in detail.
EXAMPLE 4-2: AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE (T, S) 
PERIODIC REVIEW POLICY
For the data provided in Example 4-1, the review period is monthly (assumed for 
convenience to be 4 weeks). As a result, the total lead time is 6 weeks. The safety 
stock required is determined using the service level method to be (2.06 * 20 * 
6 ), or 
approximately 100 units. The order upto level is calculated as
Order upto level = Demand over lead time and reorder interval + Safety stock
                           = 6*100 + 100 = 700 units.

Chapter 4 | Supply Planning
148
The average order size is the expected demand over 4 weeks = 400 units, and 
the average on-hand inventory = (400/2) + 100 = 300 units. An example of 
the inventory profile corresponding to this policy is shown in Figure 4-3.
Figure 4-3. An illustration of periodic review replenishment
 
The guideline for the method to be used is based on the nature of the mate-
rial being ordered. The (r, Q) reorder point policy is often used for short 
lead time, low-value orders since a manual review is often not necessary. On 
the other hand, the (t, S) periodic review policy is used for long lead time, 
strategic, or expensive items, and for capacity-constrained situations. In either 
case, when demand is not even and displays seasonality or varying prices and 
costs, it is necessary to recalculate safety stocks and economic batch sizes 

The Profitable Supply Chain

and adjust replenishment parameters accordingly. This is a reason for the 
popularity of sophisticated advanced planning systems that provide support 
for ordering based on future demand, costs, inventory control limits, capacity 
constraints, and transportation mode options. 
Requirements Planning Models
Ordering supplies for material and parts whose demand depends on the 
demand for one or more other products is performed using requirements 
planning. Requirements planning can be applied to manufacturing and 
­distribution situations. When applied to manufacturing, it is termed MRP, 
whereby finished goods and raw material inventories are considered together 
for the purposes of purchase ordering. The distribution situation is called 
DRP, whereby central and regional inventories are considered together.
Materials Requirements Planning
MRP converts a production schedule for products into time-phased require-
ments for subassemblies and parts, which, in turn, are converted into orders 
based on lead time, on-hand inventory, scheduled receipts, and inventory  
targets. The inputs required by MRP include the following:
• 
Master production schedule (MPS). The MPS specifies the 
production schedule for each of the product, and is calcu-
lated based on actual customer orders as well as demand 
forecasts.
• 
Bill of materials (BOM). The BOM specifies the amount 
or number of raw materials, components, and sub-assem-
blies needed to manufacture each product.
• 
Item master. This file specifies item characteristics, includ-
ing lead time for production or purchasing, as well as tar-
get inventories.
• 
On-hand inventory. The on-hand inventory for each of the 
specified items is required for netting requirements.
• 
Scheduled receipts. For long lead time items, sched-
uled receipts need to be tracked and used for netting 
requirements.
The requirement on each part is referred to as dependent demand, while prod-
uct demand is referred to as independent demand. The difference between 
these two is that independent demand is calculated using the forecasting or 

Chapter 4 | Supply Planning
150
consensus methods described in Chapter 3, whereas dependent demand is 
calculated from the independent demand (hence the use of the term “depen-
dent”). The steps in the calculation are:
• 
Explosion. Demand or the production schedule is con-
verted to component requirements (quantity and sched-
ule) using the BOM. If a part is used in multiple bills, the 
requirements from the individual products are added 
together. Inventory targets are specified as a quantity or 
as time, and are included in the requirements.
• 
Netting. Any on-hand inventory is subtracted from the 
requirements calculated from the previous step. When 
there are multiple manufacturing steps (for example, 
when subassemblies are created from raw material, and 
in turn, used to manufacture products), netting needs to 
be performed for each of these subassemblies consid-
ering on-hand and work-in-process (WIP) inventory. WIP 
inventory represents inventory of products or subassem-
blies that is in the process of being converted from its 
raw to finished form.
• 
Offsetting. This step incorporates lead times into the 
schedules, in order to determine the timing of supplies. 
For subassemblies, the lead time for production is used; 
for raw material, lead time for supply is used.
When there are multiple manufacturing steps, these calculations are per-
formed for each in an iterative manner, from finished goods to subassemblies 
to raw materials. Example 4-3 illustrates these steps.

EXAMPLE 4-3: AN ILLUSTRATION OF MATERIALS 
REQUIREMENTS PLANNING
Data for MRP for an electronics company is provided in Figure 4-4, including the item 
master, bill of materials, on-hand inventory, scheduled receipts, and independent 
demand.
The first step is to calculate the production schedule from the independent demand for 
each of the products, as shown in Figure 4-5. In this calculation, the production schedule 
is calculated by subtracting the cumulative value of inventory and production from 

Chapter 4 | Supply Planning
152
the cumulative value of demand for the previous weeks. For example, the production 
schedule for week 2 is calculated as
Production schedule for week 2
    = Total demand for weeks 1 and 2  – Available inventory
    = (75 + 80) – 100 = 55.
Supply requirements for parts are calculated based on the production schedule for 
the finished good and the lead time for production. The procedure for calculating 
requirements depends on whether each is used by one or both products; when a part 
is used by only one product, the requirement is calculated by simply offsetting the 
production schedule by the appropriate lead time, as shown in Figure 4-5 for the 7MPx 
CCD part.
Figure 4-5.  Production schedules and requirement plans for Example 4-3

The Profitable Supply Chain
153
In the figure, the projected inventory for the end of week j is calculated according to:
Projected inventory for week j
     = Projected inventory for week (j-1) + Scheduled receipts for week j
        + Planned orders for week j – Requirements for week j
For example, the projected inventory for week 4 is calculated as
Projected inventory for week 4
     = Projected inventory for week 3 (135) + Scheduled receipts for week 4 (75)
        + Planned orders for 4 (0) – Requirements for week 4 (80)
     = 130.
Planned orders for a period are calculated based on meeting a target inventory (i.e., 
safety stock):
Planned orders for week j
     = Requirements for week j + Target inventory for week j
         – Projected inventory for week j-1
Therefore, the planned orders for week 5 are
Planned orders for week 5 =  80 + 100 – 130 = 50 units.
Note that the planned order quantity may need to be modified based on the lot size 
specified. Since the lot size for the part is 25 units (from the Item Master data table), no 
modifications are necessary. If the lot size had been 30 units, then the planned order is 
rounded to the closest multiple, i.e., 60 units. These additional 10 units would result in 
an inventory level in excess of the target.
When a part is used across multiple products, requirements need to be calculated based 
on the production schedules for each of the products, time-phased by the appropriate 
lead time. In this example, the LCD part is utilized by both camera products (as shown in 
the BOM). The procedure for calculating LCD requirements is shown in Figure 4-5.
The requirements are calculated by adding the combined production schedule for the 7 and 
8 MPx cameras. Since production lead times are identical for both products, the schedules 
for the same weeks can be added (for example, week 2 requirements of 220 units are 
obtained by adding 80 and 140 units for the 7 MPx and 8 MPx cameras, respectively). 
Once these combined requirements have been calculated, the procedures for computing 
projected inventory and planned orders are identical to the previous situation.
MRP has been adapted to deal with several other situations, such as manufac-
turing yield, sub-assemblies, and engineering changes.

Chapter 4 | Supply Planning
154
There are several situations that may require the procurement organization 
to issue purchase orders that are different from the quantity dictated by the 
MRP bill-of-material explosion). Examples of such situations include:
Price discounts from the vendor for bulk purchases that 
• 
have not been accommodated by the lot size specification.
Early purchasing in anticipation of a price hike or an industry-
• 
wide material shortage.
Deferred purchasing in anticipation of a price reduction. 
• 
These situations require the materials planner to modify the MRP output and 
adjust order quantities as needed. 
Distribution Requirements Planning
Replenishment models are frequently used to order material at distribution 
centers, which works well for single stage distribution networks. However, 
companies supporting a wide geography often rely upon a distribution net-
work consisting of central distribution centers that feed local facilities (see 
Figure 4-6); in such cases, inventories need to be coordinated across the dis-
tribution network, achieved by DRP. The data requirements for DRP are simi-
lar to MRP and include:
The independent demand forecast for each product at 
• 
the respective distribution centers.
On-hand inventories.
• 
Target safety stock.
• 
Transportation lot sizes or economic replenishment 
• 
quantities.
Replenishment lead times and frequencies.
• 
Since the logic used to convert demand into requirements and replenishment 
orders is identical to MRP logic, an MRP system is often used to perform DRP. 
For manufacturing companies, the output of DRP is the demand that is placed 
on the manufacturing plants and is used to drive MRP. Example 4-4 illustrates 
the use of DRP.

The Profitable Supply Chain
155
Figure 4-6.  Use of distribution requirements planning (DRP) for a two-stage distribution 
network
The supply lead times for the regional distribution centers are 1 week, while the supply 
lead time for the central distribution center is 8 weeks, with a container size of 2,000 
units. Safety stocks are set to 1 week for the regions and 3 weeks centrally. The 
independent demand for a product at these facilities is shown in Figure 4-7. With this 
information, the replenishment plan for each of the regions can be completed, shown in 
Figure 4-7 for the Midwest region.
EXAMPLE 4-4: AN ILLUSTRATION OF DISTRIBUTION 
REQUIREMENTS PLANNING
The distribution network for a consumer goods product is shown in Figure 4-6. Goods are 
manufactured overseas and shipped to the United States using ocean containers. The 
goods are imported at the Los Angeles port and inventoried at the central distribution 
facility in close proximity. This central facility is used to fulfill demand from retail 
customers in California and neighboring states. In addition, two regional distribution 
centers are maintained in Chicago, Illinois and Dallas, Texas to fulfill retail demand for 
the Midwest and Southwest regions, respectively.

Chapter 4 | Supply Planning
156
The first four rows (demand, on-hand, target safety stock, and in-transit) are inputs to 
DRP. The calculations for the end of week (ending on-hand or EOH) projected inventory 
and replenishments are similar to the MRP calculations. The projected inventory for the 
first period is calculated as (on-hand + in-transit – demand) = (1,000 + 1,250 – 1,250) = 
1,000 units. Next, the replenishments for week 2 are calculated as
Replenishment for week 2
    = Demand for week 3 + Safety stock in weeks * Demand for week 3
          - Projected inventory for week 1
     = 1,250 + (1.0 * 1,250) – 1,000 = 1,500 units.
Note that the second term in the equation is the calculation to convert safety stock from 
weeks to units, and, in this example, is based on providing inventory cover for demand 
for the following week (i.e., week 3). The replenishment for the Southwest region is 
performed in a similar manner, shown in the second section in Figure 4-7.
The procedure for the central facility is different due to two streams of demand—the first 
is the independent demand for the California region and the second is the dependent 
demand from the two regions. Since there is a 1-week lead time to the regions, the 
dependent demand is placed one week earlier on the central facility. Additionally, since 
Figure 4-7.  Distribution requirements planning (DRP) calculations for Example 4-4

The Profitable Supply Chain
157
the central facility is replenished via ocean shipments with a lot size of 2,000 units 
(container load) and an eight week lead time, no replenishments can be arranged in the 
first 8 weeks. This 8 week window is shown in gray in the Replenishment row.
Replenishment for week 9
     = Dependent demand for week 9  + Independent demand for week 9
         + Safety stock in weeks * Demand for week 10 - Projected inventory for week 8
     = (250 + 3,000) + (3.0 * 3,250) –8,000 = 5,000 units.
Note that the requirement of 5,000 units is rounded up to 6,000 due to the 2,000 unit lot 
size. The replenishment requirements into the distribution center will act as the production 
requirements to be placed on the manufacturing facility. Therefore, for companies that 
operate manufacturing plants and distribute products in several regions, the workflow will 
involve a DRP run, followed by an MRP and production scheduling run.
 
DRP allows for the inventory picture across the entire network—on-hand 
and in-transit—to be considered while planning supplies. This coordinated 
view across the network ensures that inventories are in line with targets. 
Constraints-Based Planning
A constraint is any factor in the supply chain that limits output and hinders 
attainment of the targeted goals. Examples of constraints are inadequate man-
ufacturing capacity and insufficient storage space for inventory. One of the 
drawbacks of MRP and DRP is the inability to deal with a wide variety of con-
straints—both provide a simple approach to capacity and lead times, some-
times resulting in plans that do not provide the company with the desired 
output. The need for constraints-based planning is best understood by way of 
an example. Consider the distribution plan for the central region in Example 
4-4. What if the beginning on-hand inventory were not 8,000 units but only 
100 units? The requirements would look quite different since the projected 
inventory calculation would result in negative values, indicating insufficient 
inventory in weeks 1 and 8, since the lead time for ocean transit does not 
allow for a shipment to be received until week 9. This mismatch between 
demand and available and planned supply is a constraint since it does not allow 
the supply chain to perform as desired.
A common constraint situation involves insufficient manufacturing capacity. 
The options available to resolve this issue are to authorize overtime in order 
to increase output, prebuild inventory when sufficient lead time exists, or 
change product mix in case product inventories permit. Selecting the right 
option is not a trivial task. Not only do companies need to evaluate the fea-
sibility of each option—for example, will changing the product mix reduce 

Chapter 4 | Supply Planning
158
output due to higher setup times?—but they also need to analyze the cost 
implications. Table 4-1 provides a few examples of constraint situations and 
resolution options.

Capacity Constraints Due to Seasonal Demand
Managing inventory during peak demand periods is a challenge faced by 
all consumer goods companies. Examples of peak demand periods include 
Christmas, back-to-school, and Halloween. Consider the following excerpt 
from an annual report of an apparel retailer:
The retail apparel market has two principal selling seasons, Spring (first 
and second fiscal quarters) and Fall (third and fourth fiscal quarters). As 
is generally the case in the apparel industry, the Company experiences its 
greatest sales activity during the Fall season. This seasonal sales pattern, 
in which approximately 40% of the Company’s sales are realized in the 
Spring season and 60% in the Fall, results in increased inventory during 
the Back-to-School and Holiday selling periods. During Spring of Fiscal 
2005, the highest inventory level of approximately $364.0 million at 
cost was reached at the end of July 2005 and the lowest inventory level  

The Profitable Supply Chain
159
of approximately $211.2 million at cost was reached at the beginning of 
February 2005. During Fall of Fiscal 2005, the highest inventory level of 
approximately $418.5 million at cost was reached at the end of November 
2005 and the lowest inventory level of approximately $342.3 million at 
cost was reached at the end of December 2005.
—Abercrombie & Fitch, 2006 Annual Report
Clearly, the large difference in sales through the year places an enormous strain 
on manufacturing operations, and companies are forced to take on inventory 
positions that depend on the forecast, manufacturing capacity, cost of produc-
tion using overtime labor, and cash positions. This mismatch between capacity 
and demand is illustrated in Figure 4-8 for a consumer product that displays 
significant demand in two to three months of the year. In addition, service level 
and safety stock calculation can further exacerbate the situation, as shown in 
the middle graph in Figure 4-8. In most situations, the required production 
levels can far exceed the capacity of the manufacturing plants, as shown with 
the two horizontal lines representing shift-based production capacity.

Chapter 4 | Supply Planning
160
Adding capacity is not a desirable option due to the low utilization during the 
off-season. Furthermore, even if tooling investments were made, the ability to 
adjust the labor force according to the peaks may not be possible. Instead, an 
alternative option is to build additional inventory during the lean periods leading 
up to the season, and building to capacity during the peak season. This strategy 
provides the additional benefit of increasing utilization in the earlier periods.  
The resulting prebuild inventory is illustrated in the bottom graph in Figure 4-8.
Figure 4-8.  Meeting seasonal demand peaks by building ahead

The Profitable Supply Chain
161
The additional inventory that accumulates as a result of this action is referred 
to as seasonal or prebuild inventory. While it allows manufacturing plants to 
meet market demand without additional tooling investments, the strategy 
is not without a disadvantage since it increases inventory holding costs. 
When penalties associated with holding inventory are high, for example if 
obsolescence is a consideration, other options can be evaluated, such as the 
use of lower-cost warehouses for storing inventory, selling goods earlier to 
channels, or striking deals with channel partners to share a portion of any 
increased costs.
Seasonal demand may not be the only reason for accumulating prebuild inven-
tory. The need can also arise when multiple products consume the same 
production resource at a manufacturing plant. Since capacities are usually set 
based on anticipated demand, a favorable situation when demand simultane-
ously increases for some or all of the products can result in a constrained 
situation at the manufacturing plant. If production capacity is lesser than the 
anticipated demand, the need to accumulate inventory arises. Example 4-5 
illustrates a prebuild analysis.
EXAMPLE 4-5: PRODUCTION PLANNING FOR A 
PRODUCT EXPERIENCING SEASONAL DEMAND
Requirements and capacity for a consumer good, along with prebuild calculations, are 
given in Figure 4-9. The Capacity Shortfall row in the first illustration (the difference 
between requirement and capacity) shows that capacity is inadequate in months 5 and 
6. Using this information, there is a simple method for calculating prebuild quantities. 
The first step is to calculate available capacity and shortfalls for each of the months, as 
shown in the Capacity Available row in the second illustration in Figure 4-9.

Chapter 4 | Supply Planning
162
Once capacity availability and shortfalls have been calculated for each month, prebuild 
quantities are calculated in reverse order—the first calculation is performed for the 
month immediately preceding the shortfall (i.e., Month 4) using the formula shown at 
the bottom of the figure. Once the prebuild quantity for Month 4 has been completed, 
the procedure is repeated for Month 3 until the entire shortfall has been covered. Due 
to this reverse traversal, the resulting production plan is optimal since it minimizes the 
buildup of inventory.
Once prebuild quantities have been determined, the production plan is calculated 
for each month as the sum of the requirement and prebuild quantity for that month. 
Finally, the projected inventory is simply the difference between total production and the 
requirement for that month. The numbers clearly show the build-up of inventory in the 
first 4 months, which is consumed by the seasonal demand in months 5 and 6.
 
Figure 4-9.  Input data and prebuild calculations for Example 4-5

The Profitable Supply Chain
163
When multiple products are produced using the constrained resource, an 
additional decision needs to be made regarding the specific product that 
should be prebuilt. Some of the considerations for this decision are:
• 
Availability of raw material. Prebuild requires that raw mate-
rial inventory also be available at an earlier time.
• 
Availability of storage. If storage space is limited, storage 
capacity will need to be considered.
• 
Minimizing exposure. If product demand is uncertain, it 
is necessary to evaluate the additional exposure due to 
prebuild inventory. 
It is natural to prebuild the product with higher volume and greater margin 
first, since the additional inventory can be sold for a greater profit. While 
this is generally accurate, another factor that companies need to take into 
consideration is the holding and obsolescence cost—products with high price 
erosion or holding costs are not good candidates for earlier production. Once 
the priority of products to be prebuilt has been determined, the production 
plan for each of the products in the earlier periods needs to be calculated. The 
simple method shown in Example 4-5 for a single product can be extended to 
analyze several products. However, when the number of products is large and 
additional factors need to be considered (for example, raw material availabil-
ity), the use of heuristic methods or linear programming becomes necessary. 
Many advanced planning systems provide such capabilities. 
Advanced Planning Systems
The section on requirements planning has shown how materials can be planned 
for the manufacturing and distribution sections of the supply chain separately. 
However, the resulting workflow for a company that operates several facilities 
requires significant coordination and is a daunting task. In addition, support for 
resolving constraints is minimal, and requirements planning systems leave much 
of the problem solving to the production scheduler or purchasing agent. These 
issues have resulted in the adoption of advanced planning systems (APS) for 
complex multi-facility supply chains. When properly implemented, these sys-
tems can have a significant impact on margins, as observed in an annual report 
by Adtran, a manufacturer of networking and communications equipment:
Cost of sales, as a percentage of sales, decreased from 42.9% in 2004 
to 40.9% in 2005. The decrease is primarily related to manufacturing 
efficiencies, the timing differences between the recognition of cost 
reductions and the lowering of product selling prices, and the sales of 
higher margin new products. In addition, the decrease resulted from 
improvements in supply chain management, due to the implementation 

Chapter 4 | Supply Planning
164
of an advanced planning system and a web-based procurement process, 
which has reduced cycle times and increased our manufacturing flexibility. 
We anticipate that continued deployment of supply chain applications 
augmented with process improvement strategies will result in further 
cost reductions, which we believe will provide a continued competitive 
advantage.
—Adtran, Inc., 2006 Annual Report
The importance of advanced planning systems is also emphasized by a furniture 
manufacturer, Steelcase.
The Company manufactures its products at more than 30 locations 
throughout the world, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, and 
Europe. In 1987, the Company adopted world class manufacturing 
principles which utilize a variety of production techniques, including cell or 
team manufacturing, focused factories, and rapid continuous improvement. 
This initiative has evolved to include advanced planning and scheduling 
systems and is referred to as the Steelcase Production System. The Company 
continually examines new opportunities to consolidate its manufacturing 
and distribution operations to improve efficiency. Substantially, all plants 
“build to order” rather than to “forecast,” which directly reduces finished 
goods inventory levels and emphasizes continuous improvement in set-
up and delivery time to customers. As a result of these and other order 
processing and customer service improvements, the Company’s average 
lead-time, i.e., the time from order to delivery, has been reduced in the 
United States and Canada.
—Steelcase Inc., 2013 Annual Report
The excerpt indicates that the cost of implementation of such systems is sig-
nificant; however, companies still see sufficient financial benefit and return on 
investment from such a system. Yet another example is from an annual report 
of Paccar, a commercial vehicle manufacturer:
Leyland operates one of the most efficient truck factories in the world.  
The 710,000-square-foot plant incorporates an innovative robotic chassis 
paint facility and a state-of-the-art Advanced Planning and Scheduling 
system to produce DAF’s entire LF, CF and XF product line. This complex 
mix of vehicles—with its widely different market requirements—serves 
customers in Europe, Australia, Africa, and North America.
PACCAR was selected as a “Supply Chain Top 25” leader by AMR Research 
because of the integration of its global supply chain. PACCAR’s Dynacraft 
supply chain management services developed a global advanced-planning

system that shortens truck production scheduling from hours to minutes, 
and implemented state-of-the-art chassis robotic paint software to realize 
manufacturing efficiency and product quality benefits.
—Paccar Inc., 2007 Annual Report
Clearly, companies across many different industries see a significant advantage 
in implementing advanced planning systems. Some of the capabilities provided 
by advanced planning systems include:
• 
Support for coordinating activities across multiple sites. When a 
company operates multiple distribution centers and manu-
facturing plants, APS calculates requirements for the distri-
bution centers and converts the necessary replenishments 
into dependent demand for the manufacturing plants.
• 
Explicit handling of constraints. One of the ways that 
advanced planning differs from traditional requirements 
planning is by simultaneously considering material and 
capacity, which results in more realistic plans. When 
demand is in excess of capacity, APS can consider several 
alternatives, including alternative line capacity and even 
available capacity at alternative facilities. When material 
is short, alternative parts or suppliers can be considered. 
When the mismatch is due to transportation schedules, 
alternative modes of transport can be considered. This 
general approach toward constraint resolution is a signifi-
cant benefit provided by APS.
• 
Provision for collaborative workflows. The resolution of 
constraints becomes harder to analyze and execute in 
an outsourced supply chains since it is harder to collect 
information in a timely manner and understand the true 
capability of the supply chain. For this reason, collabora-
tion has become an increasingly important process and 
is an important feature provided by advanced planning 
systems. Collaborative workflows are expanded on in the 
following section in this chapter.
• 
Creation of feasible plans. When constraints cannot be 
resolved, the resulting mismatch between supply and 
demand needs to be resolved by ensuring that scarce 
resources are utilized in the best possible manner. This 
process of allocation is expanded on in the discussion of 
sales and operations planning in Chapter 5.

Chapter 4 | Supply Planning
166
• 
Ability to evaluate network options. Along with planning 
requirements across multiple facilities, APS need to 
incorporate features that allow the analyst to evaluate 
improvements that are possible by alternative routings 
and alternative placement of facilities. Details regarding 
such analyses are provided in the discussion of network 
planning in Chapter 6.
• 
Support for a performance review process. The calculation 
of metrics and support for what-ifs requires not only the 
incorporation of financial information, but also the capa-
bility to re-plan quickly and address the different kinds 
of questions that can arise. Details regarding the perfor-
mance review process are provided in Chapter 7. 
Advanced planning systems employ one or more methods for constraint reso-
lution, including heuristics and linear programming. A heuristic is a problem solv-
ing method that utilizes rules or educated guesses in order to arrive at a good 
answer. When applied to planning supply, heuristics consist of a series of steps 
for evaluating alternatives, as shown in Figure 4-9 and illustrated in Example 4-5. 
Heuristics have gained popularity since they can be easily understood and pro-
grammed. However, heuristics cannot be mathematically proven to arrive at an 
optimal solution; therefore, they need to be used with care. Complex supply 
chains involving constraints at multiple manufacturing and distribution stages are 
typically hard to tackle using these methods.
An alternative to the use of heuristics is linear programming (LP). LP refers to 
a mathematical technique for optimizing a set of linear objective functions 
subject to linear constraints.1 LP is better suited than heuristics for arriv-
ing at optimal solutions for complex problems. However, it is not without 
shortcomings—defining LP models requires skill, and nonlinearities such as lot 
sizing (for manufacturing or transportation) cannot be included in the model. 
Due to this limitation, it is often necessary to solve the problem using LP to 
arrive at a specific production plan, and to modify this plan using heuristics to 
accommodate nonlinear constraints. Since there is a reliance on heuristics, 
the final solution is not guaranteed to be optimal and the production and dis-
tribution plan can result in excess inventories for certain parts and products, 
and simultaneously an inability to satisfy demand for other products.

Since there is no single approach that performs adequately for all situations, 
it is necessary for the analyst to gain an understanding of the specific method 
being utilized by the planning system in order to identify situations that can 
result in suboptimal production. If such situations are encountered, manual 
intervention is needed to perform additional checks or procedures to improve 
efficiency. Examples of guidelines that can be used during exception resolution 
are shown in Table 4-2.
Table 4-2.  Sample Guidelines for Exception Resolution
Product Characteristics
Resolution Guidelines
Variable demand, steady price, high 
margins
Maintain high service levels. For example, consider use 
of multiple modes of transportation to meet demand.
Variable demand, steady price, low 
margins
Limit margin erosion by tightly managing supplies  
(e.g., ocean freight only, no overtime labor).  
Service levels may be sacrificed.
Variable demand, decreasing prices 
and margins (lifecycle products)
Evaluate use of mixed strategy: maintain high service 
levels initially (e.g., use local manufacturing, air freight), 
but limit margin erosion toward end-of-life.
Advanced planning systems are not without their disadvantages—they are 
complex, time consuming, and not guaranteed to resolve a problem in the 
best possible manner. However, the alternative is to rely solely on human 
effort and insight, which can prove to be costly when the staff is inexperienced 
or when supply chains are complex and involve numerous products. In such 
situations, the benefit of APS is undeniable, especially when used in a decision-
support mode. 
Supply Collaboration
In an increasingly outsourced supply chain, there is a clear need for collabo-
ration between partners to ensure visibility and alignment of demand and 
supply. Supply collaboration can provide early visibility to suppliers regarding 
changes in demand and purchase schedules, and provide buyers with visibil-
ity to shipping schedules and changes. The Beer Game, developed at MIT in 
the 1960s, demonstrates the value of sharing information across the different 
entities in a supply chain.2 This instructive exercise clarifies how each entity, 
acting in isolation, can increase costs for the entire supply chain.
2Michael Hugos, Essentials of Supply Chain Management (John Wiley, 2003).

Chapter 4 | Supply Planning
168
While it is impossible to react immediately to changes in demand, especially 
with the extended lead times in outsourced supply chains, the magnitude of 
the inventory charge may have been reduced by better visibility and reaction 
across the supply chain. No doubt this example is egregious, but day-to-day 
supplier operations and misalignment impact costs in less extreme but never-
theless significant ways.
Several companies have realized that collaboration is valuable and a few early 
examples deal with the standardization of the process between a manufac-
turer and a retailer—referred to as Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, and 
Replenishment (CPFR), described in Chapter 3. Since CPFR is geared toward 
information related to retail sales and promotions, it is not directly applicable 
to communication with suppliers. Instead, different procedures are required, 
with additional focus on capacity and schedules. The most common collab-
orative processes between a manufacturer and suppliers are:
• 
Purchase order collaboration. The communication of pur-
chase order (PO) and shipment details, and alerts when 
quantity variances or schedule changes occur.
• 
Inventory collaboration. The communication of demand 
and on-hand inventory information required to support 
a vendor-managed inventory (VMI) situation.
• 
Supply forecast collaboration. The communication of prod-
uct or product-group level requirements in order to pro-
vide the supplier visibility to future order quantities.
• 
Capacity collaboration. Of special importance when cus-
tom parts are being purchased, the communication of 
capacity information ensures that the right product-mix 
decisions are taken.
Figure 4-10 summarizes these exchanges for two trading partners.

The Profitable Supply Chain
169
Purchase Order Collaboration
Purchase orders may be initiated several weeks to months ahead of the receipt 
of goods, depending on the lead time for supply and transportation. During 
this time, it is possible for quantities, delivery dates, destinations, and prices 
to change, which can adversely impact manufacturing schedules and customer 
deliveries. The goal of purchase order collaboration is to reduce the occur-
rence of such variances.
Figure 4-10.  Examples of collaborative processes

Chapter 4 | Supply Planning
170
The information communicated and tracked by this process includes order 
details as well as information such as the following that can be used to 
avert delays:
Transactional information, including the order number, 
• 
header information, lines, quantities, and schedules.
Tracking information related to the order communica-
• 
tion date, supplier acknowledgment date, and shipment 
and receipt dates.
Supporting and alerting information, including dates and 
• 
reasons for schedule changes. 
Software enabling this collaboration triggers alerts when shipments are not 
made and goods are not received according to schedule. Such tools can greatly 
reduce the manual effort required to monitor and manage issues. 
Inventory Collaboration
The goal of inventory collaboration is to provide suppliers visibility to inven-
tory levels at the buyer’s facilities in order to ensure timely replenishments. 
The most common application of inventory collaboration is to support the 
VMI process. VMI requires that the supplier monitor inventory levels and 
plan supplies in order to ensure that inventories remain at a specified level. 
Advantages of a VMI program include the following:
Timely and accurate replenishments translate into rev-
• 
enues for the supplier, which is a strong incentive for 
ensuring that adequate attention is being devoted to the 
monitoring of inventory levels and supplies.
The transfer of activities for reviewing inventory and plac-
• 
ing purchase orders to the supplier frees up resources 
within the company, which eventually translates to cost 
savings.
A VMI program is usually accompanied by a pricing agree-
• 
ment that does not favor large, lumpy supplies. As a result, 
the supplies can be better aligned with production capac-
ity and the buyer receives consistent prices. 
The basic information to be communicated includes on-hand inventory and 
on-order information. In addition, a view of future demand is provided in the 
form of weekly demand and demand over the replenishment lead time. Finally, 
supporting information, such as the criticality of the part for the production 
process, can help the supplier ensure adequate service levels.

The Profitable Supply Chain
171
Inventory collaboration is performed according to a specific schedule, usually 
daily or weekly. Frequent reviews will ensure a quick response in case of demand 
spikes. The use of a system reduces the effort required and provides the addi-
tional benefit of continuous monitoring and triggering of replenishments on an 
as-needed basis, if appropriate. 
Supply Forecast Collaboration
When lead times are long, a lack of alignment between demand and supply can 
result in shortage situations lasting several weeks or months. In such cases, a 
signal in advance of the purchase order may help align demand with the sup-
plier’s production capacity. Since the purchase order is binding, companies 
tend to delay its release until the last possible moment, when demand is clear 
and there is a high level of confidence that the purchases are necessary. On 
the other hand, the communication of a non-binding forecast can address 
these disinclinations and promote visibility across companies.
From a supplier’s perspective, visibility to forecast can be extremely useful for 
planning production. However, it is in the interest of companies to ensure that 
forecast accuracy is high; otherwise the suppliers will ignore these numbers 
and use internal forecasts instead.
The information requirements for forecast collaboration are relatively sim-
ple—at a minimum, the buyer needs to communicate the forecast quantities, 
while the supplier needs to communicate committed quantities. Any mis-
matches are highlighted and serve as the starting point for dialogs and reso-
lution steps. Since new forecasts are generated during material planning, the 
frequency of communication is usually weekly or monthly. 
Capacity Collaboration
Capacity collaboration is required when suppliers provide custom-designed 
parts, or use dedicated production lines or specialized tools to manufac-
ture one or more products. The lack of readily available alternative sources 
requires that long-term demand and capacity be aligned, usually for the next 
6 to 24 months. Therefore, the goals of capacity collaboration are to ensure 
that adequate manufacturing capacity exists at the supplier’s plant and that 
the right mix of products is being produced. Several factors can complicate 
capacity collaboration:
The horizon for capacity collaboration is usually long, 
• 
ranging from 3 to more than 24 months. The number of 
variables that can come into play in this time frame makes 
data collection challenging and requires reliance on fore-
casts that might exhibit high error.

tooling investments. This complicates the collaborative 
process since it requires that many product managers 
collaborate, and that trade-offs between different options 
be considered.
WIP tracking complexity, especially when the manufac-

turing process has several steps that take several days to

An example of this analysis is shown in Figure 4-11. From the figure, it is clear 
that the information required by this process is more involved than the other 
situations, and includes, at a minimum, demand by product line and capacity 
information. In addition, a simple bill-of-consumption that specifies the capac-
ity usage of the different product lines needs to be specified. With this infor-
mation, a simple plan that identifies capacity shortfalls and resolution options 
can be generated and used for further analysis.

The collaborative workflows that a company should consider depend on 
the characteristics of the part being sourced. While custom-designed parts 
require the highest level of alignment and collaboration, commodity items may 
require only a limited exchange of information, as shown in Figure 4-12. Other 
factors that need to be considered include the cost of materials, lead times, 
easy available of alternative suppliers, and exacting quality requirements. 
Figure 4-12.  Guidelines for applicability of collaborative processes
Apart from the collaborative processes discussed above, additional infor-
mation to be communicated may include situations related to new product 
introductions, expansions to new markets, and quality and testing procedures. 
While designing workflows and systems for these collaborative processes, it is 
important for business partners to have a clear idea of the information shared, 
communication schedules, and a clear action plan to deal with issues identified 
as a result of the collaboration. 
Summary
This chapter introduced methods for managing supplies and purchases 
based on the guidance provided by demand planning and inventory planning. 
Replenishment models can be used to create orders for items when inventory 
reaches a particular level. These models are simple to use and easy to imple-
ment with systems, but do not perform well when demand is highly variable, or 

Chapter 4 | Supply Planning
174
when inventories need to be coordinated across several points in the supply 
chain. Such coordination is required when finished goods are manufactured 
from sub-assemblies and parts, or when there are multiple stages of distribu-
tion with central and regional facilities.
Requirements planning models connect inventory across several items and 
parts as well as stages of distribution. Therefore, these models are effective 
for coordinating supplies across the supply chain, but they do not perform well 
when constraints occur; examples of constraints include insufficient inventory 
and insufficient capacity. These situations are better addressed by advanced 
planning systems, which provide connectivity across items and facilities in 
the supply chain and the ability to identify and partially resolve constraints. 
However, these systems are often complex and expensive to implement.
The importance of collaboration for the current business environment cannot 
be over-emphasized. Effective collaboration can reduce supply variability and 
reduce inventory levels. Therefore, it behooves every company to seriously 
consider one or more of the collaborative processes described in the chap-
ter. Traditionally, electronic data interchange (EDI) has been the most prevalent 
method for exchanging information between companies. EDI is restricted in 
the richness of data that can be communicated, is expensive to customize, 
and does not provide any guidelines regarding the collaborative process and 
schedules.
As a result, several industry standards have been created in order to provide 
structure to collaboration. For example, the Voluntary Interindustry Commerce 
Solutions (VICS) Association has published guidelines for data required for 
CPFR. Building on standards that existed in EDI communication, the Electronic 
Business using eXtensible Markup Language (ebXML) specification was developed 
jointly by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information 
Standards (OASIS) and the United Nations Center for Trade Facilitation and 
Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT). The ebXML specification provides stan-
dards for supply chain data as well as business processes and collaborative 
protocol agreements.
In addition, industry-specific standards exist. For example, RosettaNet, a non-
profit association of companies, specifies several Partner Interface Processes 
(PIP) that provide data guidelines for the electronics industry. Each of these 
standards has been developed in order to address specific processes and 
data, though significant overlaps exist. It behooves companies to invest the 
resources needed to evaluate and settle on the specifications that are best 
suited for their products and business processes.

Sales and 
Operations 
Planning
Sales and operations planning (S&OP) was formulated by Oliver Wight in the 
1980s in order to align and synchronize activities within the executive team 
in a manufacturing company. As with other supply chain processes, the initial 
S&OP process blueprint has been adopted and modified to suit the individual 
requirements of each company. This chapter summarizes some common 
process and system approaches and describes the reporting and alerting tools 
that have proven to be useful across several industries.
The Importance of Sales and Operations 
Planning
S&OP is a cross-functional process that has gained in importance, largely owing 
to the realization that the performance of any department of a company is 
significantly influenced by events that can occur anywhere in the supply chain. 
For example, the sales department may find that revenue targets are not going 
to be met because a part is unavailable, or the finance department may have to 
deal with margin erosion because of excessive air shipments from the factory 
to the distribution centers. The realization of the importance of S&OP as a 
tool for improving performance can be seen in the following excerpt from an 
annual report of Lowe’s, a home improvement company.

In 2014, we will build on the momentum established in 2013 as we further 
optimize our business model. We will also continue to focus on three 
priorities to drive further top-line growth. First, we will use our enhanced 
Sales & Operations Planning process to improve seasonal planning by 
market. Second, we will improve our product and service offering for the 
Pro customer. Third, we will continue building customer experience design 
capabilities.
Through our Sales & Operations Planning process, we have addressed 
an opportunity to improve seasonal planning, including the cadence of 
product introductions, promotions, and staffing. While we have always 
planned and executed these seasons in store, previous planning was 
completed function-by-function and reconciled to minimize conflicts. Now 
the process starts earlier and is anchored on the customer mindset for 
the season. The process more thoroughly considers detailed input from all 
functions to determine resource allocation, and it enables Lowe’s to provide 
a consistent message and experience across all our selling channels.
—Lowe’s Companies, Inc., 2013 Annual Report
A similar account is provided by Avon, a consumer beauty products manufacturer:
We continue to implement a Sales and Operations Planning process that 
is intended to better align demand plans with our supply capabilities and 
provide us with earlier visibility to any potential supply issues.
Inventory levels increased during 2009, to $1,067.5 at December 31, 2009, 
from $1,007.9 at December 31, 2008, primarily reflecting the impact of 
foreign exchange and business growth offset by operational improvements. 
New inventory lifecycle management processes leveraged with initiatives 
such as PLS, SSI, ERP implementation, and the Sales and Operations 
Planning process are expected to improve inventory levels in the long 
term. Inventory days are up seven days in 2009 as compared to 2008, 
due to the impact of foreign exchange. We expect our initiatives to help us 
deliver operational improvements of three to five inventory day reductions 
per year for the next two to three years. 
—Avon Products Inc., 2009 Annual Report
The growing importance of S&OP may be partly attributed to the success 
of supply chain management and its focus on connecting demand and supply 
across the entire network. Some of the questions addressed by an effective 
S&OP process include:
Are there any issues in the supply chain that can affect 
• 
the company’s performance related to revenues, customer 
service, lead times, and margins?

The Profitable Supply Chain
177
What options are available to resolve issues? Who needs 
• 
to be involved in the decision-making process? What are 
the cost implications of these actions?
The remaining sections of the chapter address these questions by providing 
you with details related to workflow, as well as worksheets that you can use 
to analyze issues and provide resolution options.
The S&OP Workflow
S&OP consists of a set of activities to organize demand and supply informa-
tion, identify exceptions (issues) requiring a discussion with other divisions 
in the company, present these issues and resolution options to management, 
and execute the decisions that are taken (see Figure 5-1). Even though S&OP 
is cross-functional, it is important to assign an owner to this process in order 
to ensure that all issues are being adequately addressed and that the desired 
goals are being met. It is natural for the owner to be from the supply chain 
department, if a company is organized accordingly. Otherwise, an owner needs 
to be picked from one of the other departments, usually manufacturing or 
procurement.

The most common practice is to perform S&OP on a monthly basis, with 
weekly reviews involving the parties that have been tasked to take action. If any 
of these actions cannot be completed or if cost overruns are identified, then 
additional meetings with executives can be scheduled on an as-needed basis. 

Chapter 5 | Sales and Operations Planning
178
S&OP Procedures and Templates
The critical items that need to be reviewed during S&OP include:
• 
Customer order exceptions. Whether any customer orders 
are in danger of being delayed.
• 
Demand forecast and revenue exceptions. Whether forecast 
volume or revenue are in danger of not being met.
• 
Inventory shortfall exceptions. When supplies are insufficient 
and demand cannot be met.
• 
Margin exceptions. Whether any cost overruns are 
anticipated.
• 
Cash exceptions. Whether inventory is projected to be in 
excess of targets, leading to an increase in invested capital. 
Each of these exceptions can be the result of very different causes, including  
insufficient raw material inventory, delays in transportation, or insufficient 
capacity. Another complicating factor is that the physical network can influ-
ence the number of points at which issues can occur, such as whether the 
company ships directly from factories to customer, or if there are one or 
more distribution centers. Therefore, methods for reviewing and analyzing 
each of these exceptions depend on a combination of several factors, a few 
examples of which are provided in the following section.
Customer Order Exceptions
Shipment delays can be analyzed by comparing ship dates with projected 
inventories, which, in turn, are computed based on the on-hand and planned 
supplies. An example of a spreadsheet view that provides this comparison is 
shown in Figure 5-2. In the diagram, the first view is a summary of the excep-
tions ordered by the severity of the issue. This summary view provides guid-
ance regarding which issues need to be addressed first, which is helpful when 
the number of lines are numerous.

The Profitable Supply Chain
179
This summary view lists important information related to the customer 
account, the site from which the order is to be shipped, the planned shipment 
date for the order, order summary (units and financial), the number of line 
items in the order, shortage information (the number of items not shipping 
on time, the number of units not shipping on time, and the financial value of 
the short units), and the year-to-date (YTD) shipping performance of the 
customer. This information can be used to gauge the severity of the issue 
and any potential risk associated with a customer. Along with the columns 
shown in Figure 5-2, additional columns listing more information such as the 
names of the short items and reasons are provided to aid the troubleshooting 
procedure. 
In this example, goods ship out of a distribution center, which, in turn, is replen-
ished via truckloads from the factory. The detailed view for decision-making 
requires a daily view of orders, shipments, and inventories, and a sample table 
that provides the necessary information is shown in the daily inventory view 
in Figure 5-2. Details include:
• 
Firm orders: customer orders with a firm ship date (latest). 
Any delays to this ship date may be considered a delay.
• 
On-hand inventory:  the inventory at the time of review.
Figure 5-2. A sample template for analyzing customer order exceptions

Chapter 5 | Sales and Operations Planning
180
• 
Receipts: the expected receipts for any particular day.
• 
Projected Inventory EOD: the end-of-day projected inventory,  
calculated as the beginning inventory plus receipts minus 
shipments.
• 
Manufacturing (MFG) block: repeated fields are omitted in 
the description.
• 
Shipments: the demand placed on the manufacturer  
(i.e., shipments to the distribution centers).
• 
Production: the planned production for the particular item.
Specific shipment and receipt information are provided in the bottom block, 
with specifics regarding dates, carriers, status, delays, and reasons. With this 
information, it is possible to analyze the situation and options. The negative 
projected inventory in the first block, for example, indicates that the in-bound 
shipment is arriving late and there is insufficient inventory to fulfill the order 
completely. Since the shortfall can be fulfilled by the receipt expected in two 
days, the order will be fulfilled with a two-day delay. Similarly, the 25-unit 
order on Feb. 10 can be fulfilled only by Feb. 14, resulting in a four-day delay. 
Since there is sufficient on-hand inventory at the plant on Feb. 8, there is an 
option available to ship the 25 units using expedited transportation (overnight 
delivery) and have the goods available in time to be processed and shipped. 
The additional cost for expediting can be discussed during the S&OP meeting, 
and a decision taken based on the margin impact. 
Revenue Exceptions
Revenue exceptions can be analyzed by comparing the demand forecast 
against inventories and planned production. This analysis can be performed at 
a monthly level, with quarterly summaries to compare against sales budgets 
and revenue targets. This exception can be reviewed at the product-line level 
at which targets are established, which helps reduce the volume of data that 
needs to be analyzed.
There are several ways in which sales vs. forecast can be analyzed, depending 
on the sales model and demand patterns in a month or quarter. For example, 
the analysis can be made assuming that sales come in evenly over the quarter, 
such that the duration of the quarter that has elapsed can be compared to 
forecast achievement to flag an exception, as shown in Figure 5-3. The impor-
tant fields are explained as follow:
• 
% of Qtr elapsed. Given the current date, the duration 
of the quarter that has elapsed can be calculated as the 
number of days in the quarter elapsed divided by the 
total number of days in the quarter.

The Profitable Supply Chain
181
• 
Target forecast achievement. This is the target level of sales 
(as a % of forecast) that need to have been realized. The 
41% value in the example is identical to the duration of 
the quarter that has elapsed, since a linear sales profile 
has been assumed. If a company is sales-heavy toward the 
end of the quarter, this value can be modified downward 
to reflect such a pattern. However, even in such cases, it 
is recommended that a linear pattern be used in order 
to ensure that sufficient inventory will be available in case 
orders come in earlier than expected.
• 
Required sales rate. This is the revenue that remains to be 
realized in the quarter, divided by the number of remain-
ing days. This rate can be compared to the sales rate 
achieved during the prior quarter as well as the same 
quarter in the previous year; such a comparison will help 
estimate if the required sales rate seems achievable.
• 
Product line-specific details, along with a summary of reasons 
for shortfalls. These reasons can help guide the S&OP team 
toward a resolution procedure. For example, if the reason 
for the shortfall is insufficient supplies, then the supplier 
situation needs to be analyzed. However, if the reason is 
due to light sales, then promotions can be evaluated.

Inventory Shortfall Exceptions
When supplies and on-hand inventory are not sufficient for meeting 
projected demand, the first resolution step to be considered is expediting 
supplies. When it is not possible to make supplies available for a certain 
period of time, then the company has to consider allocation options. This 
step is often performed in an unstructured, ad hoc manner, often assigning 
scarce material to the first sales representative requesting material, or to the 
first sales order on the list. However, the proper use of scarce resources is 
extremely important, and it behooves a company to implement a structured  
procedure for performing allocations. A few of the considerations and methods 
for performing allocations are as follow:
Contractual obligations may specify a service level or 
• 
quantity that needs to be fulfilled, with a violation resulting  
in a monetary penalty. Therefore, it is important that 
when a constraint situation is identified, the quantity 
required to fulfill contractual obligations be calculated 
and reserved.
Strategic considerations can include important customers, 
• 
markets, geographies, and products. Here, importance is 
a subjective term, and its definition can vary significantly 
across companies. For example, customers can be classified  
as strategic due to high volumes or growth potential. 
Markets and geographies can be considered strategic 
if they are new or the company is engaged in intense 
competitive activity. Similarly, products can be considered 
strategic based on margins and growth potential.
Two broad allocation procedures need to be considered: The first is order 
allocation, which is the method by which supplies are allocated to customer 
orders. If there is insufficient inventory to satisfy all the orders, allocations can 
be performed according to margins, first-come-first-serve (FCFS), or fair share 
(where the available units are distributed across the orders in proportion to 
ordered quantity, with modifications for batch sizes).
Forecast allocation is the method by which supplies are allocated to the forecast  
provided by different sales accounts or regions. Since demand may come in 
very differently from the forecast, it is possible for poor business decisions 
to be made during forecast allocation. For example, scarce supplies may be 
allocated to a particular region based on the forecast provided, only to find 
that sales did not materialize, while sales in another region have outstripped 
supplies. For this reason, additional considerations and allocation methods 
are required. 

The Profitable Supply Chain
183
Forecast allocation can be performed according to margins provided by each 
region or account, or based on a fair share approach that allocates supplies 
to each of the regions according to the provided forecast. Fair share is pre-
ferred by many companies since it maintains a certain market presence and 
customer service level in all the regions; on the contrary, allocating based on 
margins may result in one or more regions receiving no supplies at all.
However, a drawback with fair share is that it is susceptible to manipulation by 
the sales organization. If the regional sales organization deliberately increases 
the forecast in order to increase allocated supply, fair share can result in 
unused inventory, which is expensive when supply is constrained. This situa-
tion can arise even with customers, as explained by Maxtor, a manufacturer of 
hard disks for computers:
Backlog: The Company generally sells standard products according to 
standard purchase order terms. Delivery dates are specified by purchase 
orders. Such orders may be subject to change or cancellation by the 
customer without significant penalties. The quantity actually purchased 
and shipment schedules are frequently revised to reflect changes in the 
customer’s needs. At times, when price competition is intense and price 
moves are frequent, the Company believes most customers may place 
purchase orders below their projected needs, delay placing orders, or even 
cancel purchase orders with the expectation that future price reductions 
may occur. Conversely, at times when industry-wide production is believed 
to be insufficient to meet demand, the Company believes that certain 
customers may place purchase orders beyond their projected needs in 
order to maintain a greater portion of product allocation.
—Maxtor Corp., 1999 Annual Report
Although this is a 1999 report, the same business practices and challenges 
continue to be faced by companies even today.
Clearly, a simple product allocation method can result in the positioning of 
inventory at the wrong places, unless it is possible to design the allocation 
method to take this behavior into consideration. One such method is the per-
formance adjusted fair share, which tracks the supply utilization ratio (i.e., the 
effectiveness of each region in utilizing allocated supplies). The ratio of actual 
sales to the available supply is used as a measure of performance, as illustrated 
in Figure 5-4.

Chapter 5 | Sales and Operations Planning
184
The higher the value, the more effective the sales organization is at utilizing 
the provided supplies, while a low value indicates that the region is inflating  
forecasts artificially. With this effectiveness measure, the allocation for a  
particular period can be calculated as follows:

Finally, if lead time permits, scarce supplies can be retained as available to 
promise (ATP) and can be assigned to individual orders as they are placed. 
This method is popular in companies with numerous sales individuals, as well 
as Internet retailers that take orders directly from consumers and ship from 
a central distribution facility. The most common method for assigning ATP to 
individual orders is first-come-first-served (FCFS). In situations involving high 
transaction volumes, use of ATP will require the development of a software 
application to manage the assignment of inventory and calculation of remain-
ing supply. The use of ATP is common in online retailing, where available inven-
tory is allocated to a customer’s shopping cart for a specific period of time 
(say, 1 hour). If the customer has not placed a firm order within this time, the 
allocation is released and made available-to-promise for other shoppers.
Figure 5-4. A sample template for analyzing the effectiveness of utilizing allocated supplies

The Profitable Supply Chain
185
Depending on the type of fulfillment, it may be necessary to utilize one or 
more of the above allocation methods. Therefore, it is important to follow a 
well-defined procedure for allocation, as shown in Figure 5-5. The steps speci-
fied are to identify the supply constraint, followed by steps to reserve inven-
tory to meet obligations, and allocating any remaining inventory to forecasts. 
Such a rigorous procedure can ensure that scarce resources are being utilized 
to meet company objectives in the best possible way.

• Based on promised fulfillment 
schedule or service level 
agreements
• Based on volume of business 
or importance to long-term 
objectives

and prior performance

Excess Inventory Exceptions
Like the low inventory situation examined in the previous two cases, excess 
inventory indicates a mismatch between demand and supply, but with supply in 
excess of demand. The challenges in reducing supply to match lighter sales include:
Supplies may already be in-transit and therefore cannot 
• 
be reduced.
Production may have been initiated and therefore, the 
• 
inventory may be close to completion (work-in-process).
Purchase orders may have already been placed with sup-
• 
pliers, and the company may incur a penalty for canceling 
these orders.
Reducing planned production may result in lower output, 
• 
resulting in higher costs due to fixed costs being absorbed 
by fewer units.
Therefore, excess inventory situations have to be analyzed in detail to under-
stand the cost implications of each of the resolution options. The forecast 
waterfall report, described in Chapter 7, is a useful visual aid for understanding 
if the excess inventory is due to over-forecasts. 
Visual Aids
Because the S&OP process is very data-driven, the ability to present relevant 
information in a succinct manner is very important. However, most software 
applications continue to rely on simply presenting large volumes of data to 
the analyst, and the onus of understanding issues and causes still remains with 
the human. This section provides a few ideas and guidelines regarding the pre-
sentation of information in a manner that is suitable for analysis and decision-
making. My intention is that you build on these ideas to suit the needs of your 
review group and company.
Some of the concepts presented in this section come from the field of data 
graphics, which studies ways of displaying numbers to aid reasoning.1 The most 
fundamental graphic that substitutes for a table of numbers is the line graph. 
But even this simple graph needs to be created carefully. Figure 5-6 shows 
how poor design and formatting can impede rapid analysis. In the example, fill 
rates are plotted along with the diagnostic measures, forecast accuracy, and 
days of inventory. Clearly, the graph is not easy to read and it is hard to gain

The Profitable Supply Chain
187
The same information can be presented in a different manner, with the  
different series being plotted in separate graphs, as shown in Figure 5-7. 
While the space occupied has increased, it is easy for the analyst to track 
trends for each series and to perceive relationships between variables. In 
this situation, the second graph does a superior job of quickly indicating that 
the dip in service levels in June coincides with a reduction in inventory as 
opposed to forecast accuracy.
Figure 5-6. A graphical design that impedes rapid analysis
any insight into the issues and causes. Several problems in the way the graph 
is constructed contribute to this drawback: The use of dual axes (for percent-
age and days of inventory) is often confusing. Additionally, overlaying multiple 
series in the same graph increases the time required to analyze each individual 
series and can mask trends.

Chapter 5 | Sales and Operations Planning
188
Indeed, several other designs can be equally or more capable of providing the 
necessary insight. Unfortunately, effort is required to implement these designs 
using standard software packages and spreadsheets, which, by default, tend to 
produce graphs like the one shown in Figure 5-6.
Another important requirement is to capture supporting information neces-
sary to provide a complete picture, to explain why there was deterioration 
in the observed metrics, and to provide supporting information and com-
ments from the various participants. A visual aid that combines several of 
these design elements is the metric information chart, which has the following 
characteristics:
A combination of metrics that are required to provide  
• 
clarity regarding a situation. The previous example com-
bined fill rates with inventory levels and forecast accuracy.

Acceptable ranges for the metric, highlighting upper- and 
• 
lower-control limits. The ranges help focus attention on 
significant changes in performance.
Supporting data, including specific product and item 
• 
details, to provide context for analysis and decision-mak-
ing, and specifics so that the analyst has an initial regard-
ing the product lines or products that need to be further 
examined.
A combination of quantitative and qualitative reasons for 
• 
issues. The qualitative factors are often contributed by 
different organizations in the company. This important 
addition to the information collected helps increase pro-
cess memory–information regarding why quantitative 
methods were overridden, what additional causal factors 
needed to be considered, and important business con-
straints can all be captured.
A list of actions taken, issues faced, results, and benefits 
• 
obtained. 
The example provided in Figure 5-7 is now modified to include these additional 
elements, and is illustrated in Figure 5-8. The graph has been augmented to 
include a lower bound for fill rates to highlight dips that require attention, 
and annotated to highlight issues, comments, and actions for future reference 
and tracking actions.

Other examples of visual aids include the waterfall chart for forecast accu-
racy, a histogram for tracking forecast bias, segmentation charts for ranking  
customers and suppliers, and maps for tracking network performance. 
However, the analyst should be careful to use the right balance of graphs 
and other traditional methods, such as tables. There are several situations 
in which a simple table is more effective at communicating the necessary

information, as shown in Figure 5-9. In this example, cost information is 
summarized using a waterfall chart and a table. While the waterfall chart is 
visually pleasing, it is occupies more space than the table and does not convey 
variance information. Therefore, the table is a more effective analytical tool 
in this case—and in the general case in which just a few numbers and a lot 
of text need to be displayed.

The approach for determining the best visual format and right balance between 
presenting too little or too much information is an iterative process. The 
analyst needs to create an initial format and present the data to the meeting 
participants. The feedback and additional questions from the audience can 
be used to improve the presentation. It may take as many as three or four 
iterations before participants are satisfied with the format. Even after this, 
additional changes may be needed as new exceptions or new information 
continues to be included in the analysis.
Summary
Sales and operations planning is an important process that involves several  
departments of a company—manufacturing, procurement, distribution, 
sales, marketing, and finance. Representatives from these departments are 
responsible for communicating changes to demand and supply, providing 
causal insight, and recommending actions that best alleviate the situations. 
There are several challenges faced while implementing this process, such as 
obtaining the support from the different departments and ensuring that the 
stakeholders devote sufficient time to prepare for these meetings. However, 
the biggest challenge is being able to assimilate and present the necessary 
information in an easy-to-understand format so that decisions can be quickly 
taken. Once participants begin to see performance improvements, it is a lot 
easier to gain the internal support to address the other challenges.

The demand and supply planning methods described in earlier chapters are 
required for ensuring that a company is performing the tactical steps required 
to align supply with demand, which will support high customer service and 
fill rates and minimize cost variances. However, operating metrics and profits 
are also dictated by the cost structure of the supply chain, which includes 
purchase prices for raw material, facility costs, labor costs for manufacturing 
and distribution, and transportation costs across the network. This analysis of 
the network for opportunities is one of the areas of supply chain management 
that is performed poorly or inadequately by most companies, largely due to 
the difficulty related to data gathering and use of analytical models. This chap-
ter covers simple processes and approaches for analyzing the network, and 
easy-to-use models for performing quantitative analysis.
The Importance of Network Planning
Network planning refers to the series of steps for analyzing the impact of sup-
ply chain structure on responsiveness and costs. The following quote is from 
the home improvement company Lowe’s, emphasizing the importance of net-
work planning for a company that services a vast geography and provides a 
wide array of products that require special handling and storage:
Supply Chain: To efficiently move product from our vendors to our 
stores and maintain in-stock levels, we own and operate 15 highly-
automated regional distribution centers (RDCs) in the United States. 
Through our RDCs, products are received from vendors, stored and

picked or cross-docked, and then shipped to retail locations. On 
average, each RDC serves 115 stores. We also lease and operate a 
distribution facility to serve our Canadian stores.
We also operate 15 flatbed distribution centers (FDCs) to distribute 
merchandise that requires special handling due to size or type of 
packaging such as lumber, boards, panel products, irrigation pipe, vinyl 
sidings, ladders and building materials. Additionally, we operate five 
facilities to support our import and e-commerce businesses and flexible 
fulfillment capabilities. We also utilize three third-party transload facilities. 
These facilities do not hold inventory, but are the first point of receipt for 
imported products. The transload facilities sort and allocate products to 
RDCs based on individual store demand and forecasts.
On average in fiscal 2013, over 75% of the total dollar amount of stock 
merchandise we purchased was shipped through our distribution network, 
while the remaining portion was shipped directly to stores from our vendors.
—Lowe’s Companies Inc., 2013 Annual Report
A major occasion for analyzing the network is related to mergers and acquisi-
tions, because there is a need to leverage assets across multiple companies 
to improve utilization metrics. The following press release details of some 
of the decisions that Federated Stores had to take in connection with an 
acquisition:
Federated Department Stores today announced a consolidation of its 
distribution center network in the Midwest to reduce duplication, increase 
efficiency and streamline operations. As a result, the company will close 
three distribution centers in early 2007. These centers were acquired 
in 2005 as part of The May Department Stores Company and now are 
operated by the Federated Logistics division.
The difficult decision to consolidate facilities was necessary because we 
simply have too much distribution capacity for the company's needs going 
forward. In addition, the work performed in some facilities no longer is 
needed, “said Federated Vice Chair Tom Cole”. Advances in logistics and 
distribution center technology allow us to handle a larger volume of goods 
more effectively with fewer facilities that are more regional in nature. This 
helps us to deliver fresh fashion merchandise to the selling floors of our 
stores more quickly and consistently across the country.
—November 2006 press release, Federated Department Stores, Inc.

A similar need for consolidation is expressed by Whirlpool, following a huge 
merger with Maytag:
Following our acquisition of Maytag, we began consolidating redundant 
facilities and trimming the number of distribution centers by more than 
50 locations, increasing efficiencies and streamlining deliveries.
—Whirlpool Corporation, 2006 Annual Report
Some of the questions addressed by network planning are:
Where should manufacturing plants and distribution cen-
• 
ters be placed to minimize facility and transportation costs, 
while increasing or achieving a level of responsiveness?
How should this network change over time in order to 
• 
meet the demands of new markets and products?
Should goods be shipped to distribution centers in a  
• 
finished form, or in bulk?
Which transportation modes should be used to move 
• 
products?
When is it necessary to consider a cross-docking model 
• 
for delivery of goods?
Which fulfillment model is beneficial—make-to-order or 
• 
make-to-stock?
A prerequisite for analyzing network options is an understanding of the differ-
ent cost categories and accounting methods. The methods for specifying costs 
for internal analysis and decision-making is commonly referred to as managerial 
accounting. While financial accounting is aimed at providing information to par-
ties outside the organization, managerial accounting is aimed at helping manag-
ers within the organization make decisions. Due to this difference, managerial 
accounting specifies costs in many different ways and with far greater detail. 
At the highest level, the cost categories considered are manufacturing, storage, 
direct material purchases, and transportation. The sum of these costs results 
in the computation of cost-of-goods, which, in turn, allows for the gross mar-
gin to be computed as the difference between revenue and cost-of-goods. An 
additional financial measure of importance in network planning is operating 
assets, defined as all assets that are used to create revenue. (Cash, buildings, and 
equipment that are not used to generate revenue do not count as operating 
assets.) With the computation of gross margins and operating assets, the gross 
margin return on operating assets (GMROOA) is defined as:
	
Grossmargin return on operating assets=
Grossmargin
Operating assets
	
(6-1)

Chapter 6 | Network Planning
196
GMROOA provides an excellent measure of the efficiency of the supply net-
work and is useful for comparing one network option with another. Since 
cost-of-goods requires the computation of manufacturing, transportation, raw 
material, distribution, and inventory costs, the analyst requires an intimate 
understanding of accounting concepts and measurements. Refer to Appendix 
A for additional details regarding managerial accounting.
The Network Planning Process
Given the number of variables and possibilities that need to be considered, it 
is necessary to follow a structured procedure while designing and configur-
ing the network. These steps—together with interactions with other supply 
chain processes—are described below and illustrated in Figure 6-1.
Figure 6-1. The Network Planning process

The Profitable Supply Chain
197
The process begins with a definition of supply chain objectives. These objec-
tives are primarily related to the current and projected demand that needs 
to be supported by the supply chain, targeted costs and margins, and desired 
responsiveness and customer service levels. It is equally important to specify 
financial and operational constraints. Examples of constraints are budgets for 
expansion and availability of resources.
When a new section of the supply chain is being created for expansion into a 
new market or manufacture of a new product, the next step is to identify ideal 
locations for distribution centers and manufacturing plants. These new loca-
tions need to consider different transportation and material routing options 
and the cost of operating these new facilities in order to meet the objectives.
It is possible to improve the performance of an existing network without 
adding new facilities, but just by changing material routings and transportation 
modes. An example of such a change is the use of a postponement strategy, 
which can result in material being routed in a raw or sub-assembly form 
closer to the customer.
Upon identifying viable options, the decision to reconfigure the network 
accordingly needs to be taken with care. In several cases, each of the options 
can provide different benefits. For example, one option can provide greater 
responsiveness at a higher cost, while another less responsive supply chain 
can be more cost effective. It might not be possible to decide between these 
options based solely on a quantitative comparison. Instead, the trade-off often 
requires management’s subjective view of the relative importance of these 
drivers for the company’s future.
Once a network configuration has been selected, a series of actions are 
required for implementation. For example, a change to material routings 
requires communication with logistics or a third-party logistics provider  
(3PL and also changes to software systems to reflect these new rules and 
costs. Similarly, selection of a new facility requires contacting a real estate 
agent regarding properties, and a subsequent series of steps to set up facilities, 
hire resources, purchase machinery, and set up systems. Each of these steps is 
explained in greater detail in the following sections.

Chapter 6 | Network Planning
198
Definition of Objectives and Constraints
The primary objectives of network design are to satisfy demand for products 
and provide the targeted response times, while simultaneously reducing costs 
related to manufacturing, inventorying, and transportation. Therefore, the  
following information needs to be collected:
Anticipated demand by product or product line and 
• 
by location (market), usually for a three- to five-year 
horizon.
Order response times, often by product, location, or even 
• 
customer.
Targeted margins and spend or unit costs by product, for 
• 
transportation, inventorying, and manufacturing.
The supply chain network impacts every function in the company—sales, 
manufacturing, distribution, procurement, customer service, and finance. 
Therefore, it is important for management from these impacted areas to par-
ticipate in the definition of objectives.
Once objectives have been specified, it is necessary to understand constraints. 
These include business or product boundaries that can limit the options that 
can be considered. Examples of constraints include:
The financial situation of the company and the budget 
• 
available for investment in new facilities or initiation of 
new markets
Management’s direction regarding network options that 
• 
can be considered. For example, a focus on growth may 
increase the importance of expansion into new markets 
and eliminate focus on reconfiguring existing markets.
Manufacturing and distribution capabilities, and the will-
• 
ingness to change. For example, initiating a postponement 
strategy will require changes to manufacturing routings 
and the purchase of materials. Therefore, a willingness 
and capability for manufacturing to support changes 
needs to be established before additional consideration.
The time available for evaluating the network and imple-
• 
menting changes
The value in conversing with the different stakeholders and gaining a com-
prehensive understanding of constraints cannot be overstated; it ensures that 
valuable time is not spent on analyzing and implementing options that will 
eventually fail.

Identification of Ideal Locations
Ideal locations are identified based on minimizing customer response times 
and transportation and facility costs in the supply chain. Since both response 
times and transportation costs are largely determined by distance traveled, it 
is common to begin to identify locations based on proximity to markets with 
high volumes. While a simple visual review on a map can suffice for small sup-
ply chains with just a few products and markets, a more rigorous method is 
needed when the number of products and locations increase. A simple method 
for performing this analysis is called the gravity model. This model uses the geo-
metric concept of weighted centroids1 to analyze demand and costs across dif-
ferent locations. The gravity model can be applied to several demand locations, 
resulting in the calculation of the center of demand (COD). The COD is the 
geographic point that minimizes the demand-weighted distance for delivery and 
is defined by latitude and longitude coordinates. The significance of the COD 
is that it represents the optimal location for a distribution center that services 
all the demand locations. The mathematical details of the model are shown in 
Figure 6-2. An application of this method is provided in Example 6-1.

EXAMPLE 6-1: DETERMINING THE OPTIMAL  
LOCATION FOR A DISTRIBUTION CENTER
Demand and geographic data for a consumer electronic company are provided in the 
first table in Figure 6-3 for eight markets. Each of the columns in the table is explained 
below.
The first column is the U.S. city being evaluated.
• 
The second column is sales data collected for each of the cities.
• 
The third and fourth columns are latitude and longitude information 
• 
for the respective cities.
The last three columns are computed from the data given in the 
• 
preceding three columns. Note that the calculation that utilizes 
the cosine function requires the angle to be specified in radians. 
Therefore, the Excel formula for Washington is COS(38.95*Pi/180) 
= COS(0.6798) = 0.777.
With this data, the coordinates of the COD are calculated as:

With these coordinates, the closest distribution hub can be identified from a map based 
on accessibility and connectedness. For example, Tulsa (Oklahoma) is a candidate 
location.
Next, the average distance from the COD to the individual cities needs to be computed, 
as shown in Figure 6-2. A sample calculation in Microsoft Excel for Washington DC 
follows:

Performing the computation for each of the cities results in an average distance from 
the COD to the demand locations of 1,009 miles. If, for example, the average unit 
transportation cost is $0.002 per mile (based on $1 per mile by truck, and 500 units of the 
product in a truckload), the average unit cost of transportation is $0.002*1009 = $2.02.
Finally, if the average order processing time is 1 day, and the average speed of 
transportation is 45 miles per hour over a 10-hour day, the average delivery time from 
Washington DC is calculated from Figure 6-2 as
Average delivery time from COD

45*10 +1= 3.2 days.
The delivery times to each of the cities is given in the second table in Figure 6-3, and 
the difference across cities should be noted: From 2 days to Houston to 4.4 days to San 
Jose, CA. The average delivery time can be used to compare the responsiveness of 
different networks. If the maximum response time is excessively high, it is an important 
indicator of the need for additional distribution centers.
Figure 6-3.  Data and results for Example 6-1

The Profitable Supply Chain
203
Note that this example utilizes air distances between the different locations. A more 
complete analysis would refine the calculations utilizing actual highway distances. The 
gravity model can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the existing network: The 
current supply chain has a distribution center in the proximity of New York City, and the 
average distance from this location to the demand locations is calculated from Figure 6-2 
to be 1,148 miles. For this mileage, the average unit transportation cost is (1148*$0.002) 
= $2.3, and the average delivery time is 3.55 days. Therefore, the current network results 
in an additional transportation cost of 14% and additional delivery time of 11%.
Example 6-2 demonstrates the use of the gravity model for determining opti-
mal locations for distribution. In a similar manner, the gravity model can be 
used to identify optimal locations for manufacturing locations to service a 
distribution network. The simplicity of the model makes it a useful tool to 
begin the analysis. Once the optimal geography has been identified, a more 
detailed follow-up needs to be performed to identify transportation hubs in 
close proximity, the availability and price of distribution facilities, the presence 
of 3PL providers, and actual road distances.
One of the important decisions to be made is regarding the number of facili-
ties in the network, and the considerations include costs and responsiveness 
to the individual markets. Since total cost includes facility and transportation, 
it may be possible for costs to decrease with the addition of facilities, followed 
by an increase as facility costs begin to outweigh transportation. An example 
of the impact of number of facilities on costs is illustrated in Figure 6-4 (con-
sidering inventory, transportation, and facility costs).
Figure 6-4.  Inventory, facility, and transportation costs in a network

Chapter 6 | Network Planning

Evaluation of Alternative Material Routings
When the intent is to utilize the network that is in place, improvements are 
possible by modifying material routings, which can result in lower fuel and 
transportation costs, lower inventories, or improvement customer respon-
siveness. Material routings refer to the steps to convert raw material into 
finished goods and delivery to the customer. Examples of changes to material 
routings include:
Manufacturing a product at a different plant
• 
Fulfilling geographic demands specific to a different plant
• 
Moving final assembly or packaging from a manufacturing 
• 
plant to a distribution center (postponement)
Transporting goods using a different mode of transport 
• 
or a different route
Using a 3PL provider for distributing inventory instead of 
• 
owned facilities
For each option that is considered, relevant cost data will need to be collected 
in order to complete the analysis. Examples of data to be collected include:
Rental costs for facilities, and availability of space
• 
Labor rates and availability
• 
Transportation costs for relevant modes, for inbound and 
• 
outbound shipments
Third-party storage and handling rates, and availability of 
• 
providers
Manufacturing costs, if postponement or new plants are 
• 
being considered
Exchange rates for goods manufactured in other coun-
• 
tries. If rates have become or are anticipated to become 
unfavorable, alternative country locations may need to be 
considered.
Tariffs and tax incentives for manufacturing. Tariffs are 
• 
customs duties incurred when material moves across 
country borders. While selecting facility locations or 
suppliers, any existing treaties or existence of free trade 
zones that can reduce duties and taxes need to be 
included in the consideration.
It is clear that these changes can give rise to a large number of options for 
even a mid-sized supply chain. Unfortunately, a rigorous modeling framework 
to evaluate these different options is not easy to formulate or execute. The 

The Profitable Supply Chain

most prevalent methods from operations research are linear programming and 
mixed integer programming; however, these methods are not easy to set up and 
use, and underlying assumptions limit their applicability to several situations, 
particularly for incorporating the impact of inventory and uncertainty. As a 
result, it is common for such analyses to be performed using spreadsheets. 
The drawback with the spreadsheet approach is that the fluid framework 
shifts the onus of rigor to the analyst. Therefore, the quality of the analysis is 
dependent on the adherence to a structured process to ensure that all aspects 
of transportation, manufacturing, and inventorying costs are considered. This 
procedure is illustrated in Figure 6-5 and demonstrated in Example 6-2.
Figure 6-5.  Inventory, facility, and transportation costs in a network

EXAMPLE 6-2: EVALUATING ALTERNATE NETWORK 
CONFIGURATIONS
The supply chain for a manufacturer of custom wall units (entertainment centers 
and book shelves) is shown in Figure 6-6, along with financial data for the product. 
The supplier in Chicago delivers raw material (wood) to the manufacturing plant in 
Philadelphia. The manufacturing operation consists of cutting wood into parts to 
match custom dimensions for each job. Upon completion, the parts are transported 
to the distribution centers, shown as numbered circles in the figure, and subsequently 
delivered to the home for installation.
Figure 6-6.  Supply network and data for Example 6-2

The Profitable Supply Chain
207
The five markets are of approximately the same size, each with monthly revenues of 
$250,000. The bounds or constraints placed on changes are that no investment is 
available for new facilities, but existing facilities can be utilized differently, if appropriate. 
The company wants to determine whether the network can be changed to reduce costs.
The first step in the network planning process is to identify alternate configurations that 
have the potential to lower costs. This example describes one such alternative—the 
setup of manufacturing operations at one of the three markets in the West Coast. Based 
on available space and expertise of the local management, the Phoenix distribution 
center (location 3 in the map) is targeted. Following the process for evaluating network 
alternatives, the routings for the new network are mapped, and the impact on the different 
cost categories are summarized in Figure 6-7. The details of the cost calculations for 
each of the steps are provided below.
Figure 6-7. Assessing the impact of routing changes on the network (Example 6-2) 

Chapter 6 | Network Planning
208
Inbound Transportation Costs
In the new network, raw material is routed separately to the two manufacturing plants. The 
unit cost for transportation is $0.08 per mile (based on full truckload rates). The distance 
from the supplier to Phoenix is 1,762 miles, and the unit cost for transportation to Phoenix 
is (1762 * 0.08) = $141. Note the increase compared to the current cost of $57.
Delivery Costs
Unit transportation costs, using full truckloads, are estimated to be $0.11 per mile for the 
finished product. (The per-mile cost for delivering the finished product is greater than the 
per-mile cost for raw material, because fewer units of the finished product can be fit into 
a truck.) Delivery cost estimates for each of the markets are shown below.
The decrease in delivery costs, from $168 to $46, is the primary cost benefit provided 
by the new network. If this improvement is large enough to offset the cost increases in 
other categories, the new network can deliver higher profits.
Manufacturing Costs
An incremental overhead cost of $5,000 per month is determined to be required for 
the manufacturing operations in Phoenix. Since the combined average volume for the 
three western markets is 300 units, the absorbed cost is $17 per unit. Manufacturing 
variable costs are estimated to be the same (i.e., $250 per unit). Therefore, the unit 
manufacturing cost for the Phoenix plant is $267.
In addition, an investment of $60,000 is determined to be required to set up the new 
manufacturing facility.
Inventory Costs
Routing changes are almost always accompanied by a change in inventory levels in 
order to maintain service levels and responsiveness. In this situation, the presence of 
two manufacturing plants will require raw material inventory to be held in two separate 
locations, which has the effect of increasing overall inventory levels. These levels can be 
determined by estimating cycle stock requirements based on replenishment schedules 
and safety stock requirements by using the service level method. Safety stock is 
determined using the data provided below for the western region:
Demand variability = 40% (compared to 20% for consolidated demand)
Supply lead time = 1 month
Supply variability = 9 days
With this information, safety stock for a 95% service level is calculated according to the 
Service Level Method (Chapter 2) to be
Safety stock (current network)=1.7 0.2 + (9/30) =0.6 months.
Safe
2
2
ty stock (new network)=1.7 0.4 + (9/30) =0.9 months.
2

The Profitable Supply Chain
209
Cycle stock levels depend on shipment schedules. In the current network, higher 
volumes permit full truckloads twice a month. In the modified network, taking advantage 
of full truckload rates requires that shipments be made once a month. As a result, the 
total inventory is calculated to be
Average inventory= Replenishment schedule
2
+Safety stock
Average inventory (current network)=15
2 +18=25 days.
Average inventory (new network)= 30
2 +26=41days.
Therefore, the new configuration results in an additional 16 days of inventory. The 
monthly holding cost, inclusive of the cost of capital and spoilage, is determined to be 
1% of the price. Therefore, the incremental holding cost is (0.01*2500*16/30) = $13.
With this information, the total cost is calculated as the sum of material, transportation, 
manufacturing, and inventorying costs. Figure 6-8 summarizes the costs for the western 
and eastern regions separately, along with cost estimates for the combined operations.
Figure 6-8.  Summary of costs for the new network (Example 6-2)
As expected, the eastern region has a lower cost as compared to the western region 
due to proximity to the supplier and demand locations. The analysis indicates that the 
unit cost for the modified two-hub network results is $966, which is approximately 5% 
lower than the unit cost of $1,020 for the current network.

Chapter 6 | Network Planning
210
Comparison and Selection of Network Alternatives
Once costs have been calculated for the identified alternatives, it is necessary 
to follow a formal process for review and selection. Some of the factors that 
need to be considered are the following:
• 
Quantitative factors, including total cost, responsiveness of 
the supply chain, and return on investment (ROI). The 
cost estimate needs to include all factors that can change 
while comparing the different options, including transpor-
tation, manufacturing, and inventorying. Responsiveness is 
dictated by the time taken to fulfill demand, and the ser-
vice level provided. Investment refers to the upfront cash 
and resource requirements for an option, along with an 
estimate of the return on investment.
• 
Qualitative factors can vary significantly across companies 
and industries. For several smaller- or mid-sized compa-
nies, implementation complexity and duration can prove 
to be the most important factors, since diverse expertise 
and the long project timelines are scarce. For companies 
on an aggressive growth path, the ability of a network 
configuration to support scale may be the most impor-
tant factor. For other companies in a highly competitive 
market, matching the competition's lead time and service 
levels may be important. In almost all cases, mitigating 
risk due to the economy and environmental factors—
including the risk of rising fuel and commodity prices—
are important.
An illustration of this review procedure for the network configuration of 
Example 6-2 is shown in Figure 6-9. The view captures costs, margins, and 
investment details, as well as opinions and feedback regarding the options. 
Such a view, which combines quantitative and qualitative factors, can improve 
communication, facilitate the consensus process, and reduce the time to a 
decision.

212
Definition of an Action Plan and Execution
The time required to implement a change to the network can range from a 
few months to even a year or more, depending on the complexity. Therefore, 
it is important to define an action plan to ensure that tasks are completed 
on a timely basis. Some of the activities that need to be included in the plan 
include the following:
• 
Appointment of a project owner. A single person who has 
responsibility for the project is an extremely step. Often, 
this person transitions to managing operations once the 
changes to the network have been completed.
• 
Evaluation and selection of sites. If new sites are being eval-
uated, this step includes activities related to contacting 
real estate brokers, visiting sites, calculating total costs, 
and making decision regarding specific buildings or land.
• 
Evaluation and selection of partners. The availability of sev-
eral third-party logistics providers results in numerous 
facility and transportation choices. Site visits, total costs, 
system sophistication, and ramp-up time are some of the 
considerations in evaluating the different providers.
• 
Placing purchase orders for machinery. Since purchase of 
machinery for distribution centers and manufacturing has 
a long lead time, it is important to research suppliers and 
purchase the necessary equipment well in advance.
• 
Appointment of staff and preparation of facility. Depending 
on the size of the facility that is required, it may be neces-
sary for staff members to be hired in advance for helping 
prepare the facility.
• 
Implementation of software systems. Enterprise systems 
must be configured to include the new facility, new man-
ufacturing operations, new material and transportation 
routings, and appropriate training for the staff.
• 
Preparation of the labor force and initiation of operations. The 
processes of specifying skill sets, roles, number of people, 
advertising, and hiring will need to begin a few weeks to 
months prior to initiation of operations, depending on 
the number of hires and skill sets required.
• 
Monitoring and adjustment of network. The efficiency of opera-
tions and the performance of the network need to be evalu-
ated on a weekly or monthly basis, with adjustments being 
made to labor force, routings, work schedules, and systems 
as necessary.

The Profitable Supply Chain
213
Given the numerous tasks and people involved in such supply chain projects, 
delays can easily occur. The use of project management software and methods 
to organize tasks and milestones and aid timely execution is recommended.
Summary
Network planning is performed infrequently by a majority of companies, often 
annually or only after a merger or acquisition. However, given the increasingly 
challenging business environment due to higher distribution costs, aggressive 
competition and demanding customers, the need to maintain a flexible net-
work has never been greater. Several challenges exist in making such changes, 
including investment and long project durations. However, a fundamental prob-
lem is the lack of awareness of the benefit due to the effort required to gather 
the necessary data and perform the analyses. To this end, the maintenance of 
a routing and cost database helps reduce the time required for gathering data 
and re-education and enables frequent analysis. In addition, the use of simple 
models as demonstrated in this chapter is recommended, because the upkeep 
effort is kept to a minimum. If the simple model indicates a significant benefit, 
a more detailed analysis can be performed.
The ready availability of outsourced providers for transportation and ware-
housing has allowed a greater degree of network flexibility, because routing 
adjustments can be made relatively quickly and without significant investments. 
Therefore, a quarterly review of the network and the identification of such 
changes can have a marked impact on profitability and responsiveness.
Given the constant change in fuel and commodities prices, a rigorous process 
to review the performance of the network is necessary. The gravity model, 
described earlier in this chapter, is a useful model for quantifying improvement 
or deterioration. A downward trend in the performance metric provided by 
the model can be used to trigger network review and further analysis.
While deciding on a network of facilities, one of the important considerations 
is management's projection of the state of the business in three to five years. 
If sales are estimated to grow aggressively, the ability to absorb additional 
fixed costs across higher volumes makes additional facilities more attractive. 
However, a challenge faced in network optimization is that a location that is 
ideal for one demand profile is not necessarily ideal when demand volumes 
are higher, as shown in Figure 6-10. In the figure, the placement of each of the 
facilities for the current and five-year projection is different. If the company 
decides to locate the facility based on current volumes, the effort and cost 
required to shutdown these facilities can prove to be very expensive. On 
the other hand, locating facilities based on future projections can result in 
excessive costs for the current environment. In addition, this placement can 
prove to be costly even in the long term if the expected demand does not

­materialize. When faced with such a situation, the company needs to evaluate 
other strategies, including the use of temporary or third-party facilities. Such 
facilities can be identified close to the optimal locations for current demand, 
and, if appropriate, transitioned to owned facilities or to a different set of 
third-party warehouses as volumes increase.
Figure 6-10.  Impact of changing demand on the network
Finally, it is important for the practitioner to remain up-to-date on new offer-
ings in the marketplace. Supply chain innovations will continue to occur 
as manufacturers, distributors, and logistics providers continue to increase 
the scope of their activities for differentiation and competitive advantage. 
Insufficient leverage of these new offerings will result in lost savings opportu-
nities, as well as a loss in market share if the competition has adopted these 
options.

Supply Chain 
Performance 
Review
Performance review is an important activity in the plan-do-check-act (PCDA) 
management philosophy for maintaining operating efficiency and enabling 
continuous improvement. The review process is especially involved for SCM, 
given the breadth of activities across manufacturing, procurement, transporta-
tion, and distribution. This chapter provides the reader with an overview of 
operational and financial metrics for these different segments and a process 
framework for implementing the review process.
The Importance of Reviewing Performance
The change in the structure of the company to include global suppliers and 
customers has required an associated modification to the way in which 
­performance is reviewed and acted upon. What used to be a casual meeting 
of managers to discuss operations at a collocated manufacturing plant has 
grown to virtual meetings between executives at several companies in differ-
ent continents. Additional changes, including product proliferation, have added 
to the complexity of gathering data and assessing performance. The following 
extracts from an annual report of Hauppauge, a consumer electronics manu-
facturer, emphasize some of the challenges:
Volatility of gross profit percentage: Over the eight quarters ended with 
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the gross profit percentage has ranged 
from a low of 18.79% to a high of 22.79%.

C H A P T E R 

Chapter 7 | Supply Chain Performance Review
216
The company emphasizes the gross profit range of 4% and proceeds to high-
light the demand-side variables that cause this volatility:
Factors affecting the volatility of our gross profit percentages are:
• Mix of product. Gross profit percentages vary within our retail family of 
products as well as for products sold to manufacturers. Varying sales mix of 
these different product lines affect the quarterly gross profit percentage
• Fluctuating quarterly sales caused by seasonal trends. Included in cost 
of sales are certain fixed costs, mainly for production labor, warehouse 
labor and the overhead cost of our Ireland distribution facility. Due to 
this, when unit and dollar sales decline due to seasonal sales trends 
these fixed costs get spread over lower unit and dollar sales, which 
increase the product unit costs and increase the fixed costs as a 
percentage of sales.
• Competitive pressures. Our market is constantly changing with new 
competitors joining our established competitors. These competitive 
pressures from time to time result in a lowering of our average sales 
prices which can reduce gross profit.
Next, the company lists a few of the supply-side variables contributing to 
this volatility:
• Supply of component parts. In times when component parts are in 
short supply we have to manage price [raw material cost] increases. 
Conversely, when component parts’ supply is high we may be able to 
secure price decreases.
• Sales volume. As unit sales volume increases we have more leverage 
in negotiating volume price [raw material cost] decreases with our 
component suppliers and our contract manufacturers.
• Cost reductions. We evaluate the pricing we receive from our suppliers 
and our contract manufacturers and we often seek to achieve 
component part and contract manufacturer cost reductions.
• Volatility of fuel prices. Increases in fuel costs are reflected in the amounts 
we pay for the delivery of product from our suppliers and the amounts 
we pay for deliveries to our customers. Therefore increasing fuel prices 
increase our freight costs and negatively impact our gross profit.
Managing product mix through market strategy and new products, 
moderating seasonal trends, efficiently managing shipments and achieving 
cost reductions are a company priority and are critical to our competitive 
position in the market. Although our goal is to optimize gross profit and 
minimize gross profit fluctuations, in light of the dynamics of our market 
we anticipate the continuance of gross profit percentage fluctuations.
—2007 Annual Report, Hauppauge, Inc.

The Profitable Supply Chain
217
While several of the factors listed above are fluctuations due to the economic 
or competitive climate, the company also talks about its continuous improve-
ment initiatives related to raw material costs and contract manufacturer cost 
reductions. This two-pronged approach—first to sense and react to unfore-
seen factors and minimize profit fluctuations, and second to constantly evaluate 
options to lower costs—is required for improving performance effectively.
The list of areas that require attention is different by industry, by company, and 
even by product line. This need to tailor measurements by product lines is 
driven by the level of maturity—whether the product is being introduced, has 
reached maturity, or is in the process of being phased out. This requires that 
the company focus on a different set of drivers as time progresses, as shown 
in Figure 7-1. The figure illustrates that supply chain drivers such as flexibility 
and costs increase in importance as the company matures, and the ability to 
deliver products in a timely and profitable manner are of primary concern.
Figure 7-1.  Focus areas for various stages of product maturity

Chapter 7 | Supply Chain Performance Review
218
The performance of the supply chain can be assessed by its impact on customer 
service, flexibility, and costs. Customer service refers to the ability to meet the 
expectations of the customer in order to be a leader or remain competitive 
in the marketplace. Specific measures include the quoted response time for 
satisfying customer demand and the ability to meet these commitments.
Flexibility is important when the company is in its growth phase and is intro-
ducing new products or entering new markets. The associated uncertainty in 
estimating demand can result in orders that are very different from the origi-
nal assumptions. If the company is to sustain its growth phase and increase 
market penetration, it needs to satisfy these unanticipated orders in a timely 
manner, which requires flexibility in the supply chain. Common measures of 
flexibility include lead times for raw material and production and utilization of 
manufacturing capacity.
Supply chain costs increase in importance as the company's sales increase and 
the need to operate a profitable business becomes the primary goal. Due to 
the multitude of activities that contribute to costs, there are several metrics 
that need to be tracked, including manufacturing costs, overhead, and inven-
tory obsolescence.
Challenges faced when attempting to measure or improve the performance 
the supply chain include the following:
Difficulty in handling the large volume of data generated 
• 
by several hundreds or thousands of items across facto-
ries, distribution centers, and suppliers. Any relationships 
between items, as with parts used to manufacture prod-
ucts, further increases the complexity of data.
Difficulty in identifying and analyzing issues due to the 
• 
expansiveness of the supply chain. With the gradual 
departure from vertical integration, operational issues 
can occur in the sales channels (retailers or distributors) 
or at contract manufacturers, key suppliers, and trans-
portation providers.
Difficulty in aligning differing viewpoints that arise due to 
• 
the involvement of multiple parties in the review process. 
A lack of agreement or clarity as to how performance 
needs to be measured can make the process ineffective. In 
fact, when metrics are acted upon in isolation, it is possible 
for results to be detrimental to the overall performance 
of the business. This can be seen from the example of 
reducing use of expensive overtime labor, only to find that 
service levels have been excessively impacted. Therefore, 
it is necessary to examine metrics in a holistic manner in 
order to get a complete understanding of a situation.

The Profitable Supply Chain
219
The rest of this chapter examines several of these challenges. A review of 
existing frameworks for performance assessment is provided, followed by a 
description of a process for performance management and a section on met-
rics lists measurements for tracking and reducing margin volatility. The final 
section provides a framework for continuous improvement.
An Overview of the SCOR Model and Metrics
Metrics, also referred to key performance indicators (KPIs), are important indi-
cators of performance. Metrics can be organized according to the business 
drivers discussed at the beginning of the chapter (customer service, flexibility, 
and costs) or by function (inventory, manufacturing, transportation, procure-
ment, and supply chain). The advantage of organizing metrics according to 
functions is that the alignment with company roles clarifies responsibilities.
A widely-used framework for defining metrics is the Supply Chain Operations 
Reference (SCOR) model, developed by the Supply Chain Council.1 This model 
divides metrics into many levels, based on the amount of detail (with level 1 
representing the highest level and level 3 representing the detailed measure-
ments). At the highest level, metrics are organized according to three catego-
ries: customer-facing, internal-facing, and shareholder-facing.
• 
Customer-facing metrics include delivery performance, fill 
rates, and perfect order fulfillment. Each of these is fur-
ther decomposed into more detailed metrics. For exam-
ple, the detailed metrics for delivery performance are 
supplier on-time and full delivery, manufacturing sched-
ule attainment, warehouse on-time and in-full shipment, 
and transportation provider on-time delivery. Other 
customer-facing metrics are order fulfillment lead time, 
supply chain response time, and production flexibility. 
The last two metrics measure the ability of the supply 
chain to respond to unplanned events. The response time 
measures the number of days taken to respond to an 
increase or decrease in demand without incurring addi-
tional costs. Production flexibility measures the number of 
days to achieve a 20% increase or decrease in orders 
without incurring cost penalties.

Improvement Using the SCOR Model. New York: AMACOM Books, 2000.

Chapter 7 | Supply Chain Performance Review
220
• 
Internal-facing metrics are divided into two categories—
costs and asset management efficiency. Cost metrics include 
cost of goods, total supply chain management costs, 
value-added productivity, and warranty/returns process-
ing costs. Value-added productivity refers to direct margin 
(obtained by subtracting revenue from direct costs and 
dividing by the number of employees). Supply chain asset 
management efficiency metrics include cash-to-cash cycle 
time, inventory days of supply, and asset turns.
• 
Shareholder-facing metrics are divided into three cate-
gories—profitability, effectiveness of return, and share. 
Profitability metrics include gross margin, operating income, 
net operating income, and economic profit. Effectiveness-
of-return metrics include return on assets, return on 
sales, and return on investment. Share metrics include 
­earnings per share (EPS), EPS percentage change in a 
­twelve-month period, and stock price percentage change 
in a ­twelve-month period. Shareholder-facing metrics are 
well-understood and -reported financial measurements 
and ratios.
The SCOR framework was created collaboratively by a working group of 
research institutions, companies from several industries (including electron-
ics, semiconductor, aerospace, and consumer goods), and consulting and soft-
ware entities. Therefore, one of the advantages is that significant thought and 
effort has been invested into the specification, and this framework has been 
implemented by many of the participating companies. However, this method 
of preparation has also created a challenge: the specification is very broad 
since it needs to accommodate a wide variety of companies. The result is that 
considerable effort is required to select a suitable set of metrics and specify 
data requirements and calculations. This problem is not specific to the SCOR 
model, but is inherent in all frameworks that attempt to standardize data, 
measurements and metrics.
The metrics and methods presented in this chapter leverage these frameworks 
for analyzing performance of manufacturing, procurement, distribution, and 
supply chain operations. But selecting appropriate metrics and supporting mea-
sures is only the first step in designing the review process; equally important is 
the presentation of the information in a way that is easy to assimilate, and the 
specification of a rigorous approach towards understanding causes and initiat-
ing actions. Therefore, this chapter provides details regarding metrics, reports 
and procedures for conducting the performance review.

The Performance Review Process
The review process is geared towards monitoring all aspects of the supply 
chain, shown in Figure 7-2. The first step in the process is to collect the neces-
sary data related to manufacturing, procurement, distribution, and transporta-
tion. The second step is to analyze variances between actual performance and 
targets in order to reduce margin volatility. The third step is to analyze the 
relative performance of products, sites, and suppliers in order to identify can-
didates and areas for continuous improvement. Finally, any actions involving 
changes to targets, replenishment policies, forecasting methods, and inventory 
policies are implemented.
Figure 7-2. The Performance Review process
Metrics, Variance Analysis, and Diagnostic 
Procedures
Each of the functional areas—manufacturing, procurement, distribution, trans-
portation, and supply chain—are analyzed according two aspects: operational 
performance and financial performance. Measurements are organized along 
the same lines, with operational metrics gauging the ability of a particular 
function to support the delivery of products, and financial metrics gauging the 
ability to perform the function in a cost-effective manner.

Chapter 7 | Supply Chain Performance Review
222
Once operational and financial metrics have been defined, the next step is to 
compare performance relative to a baseline, either a target or performance 
in a prior period, or both. This comparison is referred to variance analysis, 
and is an important step in understanding the causes for a deterioration or 
improvement in performance. An example of this procedure is seen from the 
following except from an annual report of Cisco:
Product gross margin for fiscal 2010 increased by 0.2 percentage points 
compared with fiscal 2009, due primarily to lower overall manufacturing 
costs driven by strong operational efficiency in manufacturing operations, 
value engineering and a reduction in other manufacturing-related costs. 
Value engineering is the process by which production costs are reduced 
through component redesign, board configuration, test processes, and 
transformation processes. The product gross margin for fiscal 2010 also 
benefited from the increase in shipment volume. A favorable product mix 
contributed slightly to the increase in product gross margin percentage. Fiscal 
2010 product gross margin was negatively impacted by sales discounts, 
rebates and product pricing, which were driven by normal market factors, 
as well as the geographic mix of product revenue. The impact from sales 
discounts, rebates and product pricing was within our expected range.
—2010 Annual Report, Cisco Systems, Inc.
The annual report also provides a graphic to represent the variance discus-
sion above. The graphical and textual variance analysis provided by Cisco 
helps describe the business environment and the company’s measure of  
efficiency in reacting to changes. In this chapter, a similar approach towards 
variance analysis is provided at a detailed level for each of the functions.
Metrics are further categorized as primary or diagnostic. Primary metrics are 
the most important measures of performance, while diagnostic metrics are 
supporting measurements that help diagnose the causes for variances in the 
primary metric. Delivery lead time is an example of a primary metric, while 
capacity utilization is a diagnostic metric that can be used to clarify whether a 
deterioration in the delivery lead time is due to insufficient capacity.
Manufacturing
The primary operational metric is manufacturing delivery performance. It mea-
sures the timely completion of orders and is an assessment of internal effi-
ciency as well as a customer service metric for make-to-order companies. 
Delivery performance is calculated according to Equation 7-1:
   Manufacturing delivery performance =1
Number of late shipments
To
-
tal number of shipments
   (7-1)

The Profitable Supply Chain
223
Reasons for deterioration of delivery performance include insufficient capacity, 
high reject rates (poor quality), or an increase in downtime. These different 
aspects can be combined into a single measurement called overall equipment 
effectiveness (OEE). OEE has three components: availability, performance, and 
quality. Availability is the percentage of scheduled time that a resource is avail-
able to operate and takes into account any time lost due to downtime (Equation 
7-2). Downtime measures hours lost and might be due to any of several reasons, 
including machine repair or lack of availability of material for processing.
Availability = Available time
Scheduled time
= Scheduled time
Plan
-
ned downtime
Unplanned downtime
Scheduled time
-
(   7-2)
For example, if a work center is scheduled to run 8-hour shifts for 25 days in a 
particular month, then the scheduled time is (8 * 25) = 200 hours. If the 8-hour 
shift includes a 30-minute lunch break, then the planned downtime is (0.5 * 25) 
= 12.5 hours. In addition, if the unplanned downtime during the month is 27.5 
hours, the total downtime is (12.5 + 27.5) = 40 hours. As a result, available time 
is (200 – 40) = 160 hours, and the Availability is (160 / 200) = 80%.
The next component of OEE is performance, which captures the speed at 
which the work center is operating, according to Equation 7-3:
	
Performance =
(Units produced * Ideal cycle time )
Ava
=1
Products
i
iå
ilable time

 
(7-3)
For example, consider a month in which three products are in a work center. 
The units produced are 125, 250 and 350 units, and the targeted cycle times 
are 20, 15, and 10 minutes, respectively. With available time of 160 hours, the 
performance metric is calculated as
	
Performance =125 * (1/3)+250 * (1/4)+350 * (1/6)
160
=162.5
160 =1	

Chapter 7 | Supply Chain Performance Review
224
Therefore, performance is calculated to be 101.5%, indicating that the cycle 
time for the work center was better than targeted.
The final component of OEE is quality, which captures the effect of defects and 
rejected parts, according to Equation 7-4:
	
Quality= Good units produced
Units started
= Units started
Rejects
-
Units started

(7-4)
Continuing the example, if the units started for the month for all three prod-
ucts are 750 and the resulting good units produced are 725 units, the quality 
metric = (725 / 750) = 97%.
Once these three components of the OEE have been calculated, the overall 
metric is:
	
	
OEE = Availability * Performance * Quality 
(7-5)
For the work center, OEE is (0.8 * 1.015 * 0.97) = 0.79 (i.e., 79%). When 
these values are compared with prior performance, inferences can be drawn 
regarding areas that cause the deterioration in performance. An example of 
this variance analysis is shown in Table 7-1. The variance analysis helps identify 
availability of the mounting work center as the cause of deterioration in deliv-
ery performance. Since availability is affected by unplanned downtime, a further 
analysis of machine maintenance or availability of raw materials would help nar-
row down the causes and the appropriate remedial actions can be taken (such 
as replacing work parts or increasing safety stocks for raw materials).

The Profitable Supply Chain
225
The financial metric for manufacturing is cost as percentage of revenue, and diag-
nostic metrics are costs related to labor costs, maintenance, direct materials, 
and overheads. For each of these sections, it is useful to track costs as a per-
centage of revenue as well as per unit, as shown in Table 7-2. In the example, 
the current month’s performance (February) is compared to the prior month, 
and the variance is calculated as the February value minus the January value. 
The manufacturing spend as a percentage of revenue has increased by 4%, and 
unit costs have increased by $2.89. The rest of the table helps analyze this 
variance. The increase is due to labor, direct materials, and overhead. Along 
with hours, the labor section also lists the two other OEE components—
availability and performance—as supporting measurements, which reveal that 
the variance is largely due to availability.

Availability can be further analyzed by reviewing the downtime measurement 
in the maintenance and repair section of Table 7-1, which reveals that the 
lack of availability does not appear to be due to unavailability of machines. 
Therefore, the analyst needs to evaluate other causes affecting availability, 
such as lack of raw materials and inventory buffers or poor scheduling of 
resources. Also, overheads contribute to the variance due to fixed costs being 
distributed across fewer units, such that there is only a 1% increase as per-
centage of revenue yet almost a 5% increase in unit overhead cost.
Procurement
The primary operational metric is supplier delivery performance, which is a 
proxy measurement of the time taken to receive material from the supplier 
once the order has been placed. The calculation in Equation 7-6 is based on 
the number of shipments that have been delayed:
 	
Supplier delivery performance =1
Number of late deliveries
Total n
-
umber of deliveries
 (7-6)
Alternatively, on-time performance may be tracked, based on the number of 
units delayed or the cost of materials delayed.
Reasons for delays include introduction of new suppliers or parts, significant 
increase in purchasing volume from a supplier, or issues at a supplier's plant. 
The corresponding diagnostic metrics can be tracked in a single view to high-
light issues and reasons, as shown in Table 7-3. The summary section lists 
the number of delayed shipments and the average delay, and the monthly 
comparison shows that performance has deteriorated. The item summary 
section lists the number of items procured in each month, with the increase 
indicating that new items were ordered. Similarly, the supplier summary sec-
tion indicates that two new suppliers were added. On the basis of this report, 
further analysis is warranted, with specific attention to the newly added items 
and suppliers.

Chapter 7 | Supply Chain Performance Review
228
The financial metric for procurement is material cost as percentage of revenue. 
In addition, each item can be analyzed according to the purchase price variance, 
which is the difference between the actual and standard unit price for an item 
(Equation 7-7):
Purchase price variance=(Actual unit price
Standard unit price)
 
-
                                  *Quantity purchased

(7-7)
The purchase price variance may be calculated for each item and supplier 
and is a useful metric to highlight price increases. If the increases are due to 
expediting costs, corrective actions such as increasing safety stocks or com-
municating changes quickly can help to reduce the variance. If the increases 
are due to price hikes by the supplier, contractual terms or alternate sources 
of supply can be evaluated.

Transportation
The primary operational metric is transportation delivery performance, measured 
as the number of late deliveries in comparison to total deliveries (Equation 7-8):
Transportation delivery performance=1
Number of late deliveries
- Total number of deliveries

(7-8)
If multiple modes of transportation are used to transport goods from manu-
facturing plants to distribution centers, then delivery performance needs to 
be analyzed by mode, as shown in Table 7-4 for two modes of transportation: 
ocean and trucks (where LTL mode stands for “less-than-truckload” shipping). 
The performance improvement shown in Table 7-4 is seen to be attributable 
largely to a lower delay in ocean shipments.

Factors contributing to deterioration in delivery performance include the 
following:
Loading delays due to miscommunication between sup-
• 
plier or manufacturer and the transportation provider
Increased handling complexity for new products or mate-
• 
rial, resulting in additional time to turnaround trucks
Missing paperwork, including documents required for 
• 
clearing customs
Delays in consolidation truckloads
• 
Lack of timely availability of transportation resources
• 
The financial metric for transportation is transportation cost as percentage 
of revenue. As with delivery performance, financial performance also needs 
to be analyzed by mode so that specific transportation providers and pro-
cesses can be addressed. An example of this performance review is shown 
in Table 7-5 for a single mode of transportation (ocean containers). In the 
example, transportation spend as a percentage of revenue has increased 
from February to March by $0.30 per unit. The mode analysis indicates that 
the increases are due to ocean shipment charges, driven by an increase in 
delivery charges. The next step is to examine the delivery leg in detail to 
understand the reason for cost increases. This template can be extended 
to additional modes of transportation, such as truckload or rail, as well as 
additional cost lines that will need to be added for different modes and 
provider contracts.

Supply Chain
Operational metrics for supply chain are (a) fill rates and out-of-stock for 
build-to-forecast companies and (b) order fulfillment time for build-to-order 
companies.
Fill rates measure the ability of a company to fill customer orders in a timely 
manner, usually from onhand inventory. There are many versions of the fill 
rate metric which are applicable to different supply chain configurations, a few 
of which are described below.

Chapter 7 | Supply Chain Performance Review
232
Value fill rate is the financial value of order lines shipped on time, calculated as 
follows:
	
Value fill rate = Value of goods in the first shipment
Total value of order

(7-9)
Note that this metric applies a lower penalty for delayed shipments of low-
value products.
Another version is the SKU fill rate, which performs the calculation based on 
the number of products shipped on time, as follows:
	
SKU fill rate = Units in the first shipment
Total units ordered

(7-10)
The SKU fill rate penalizes all units equally, irrespective of the value of the 
units delayed.
Yet another variation is the line count fill rate, which simply measures the number 
of lines in the first shipment relative to the total number of lines in the order.
For a company that ships its product in cases, a popular variation is the case fill 
rate, which measures the number of cases in the first shipment relative to the 
total number of cases ordered.
The selection of a specific fill rate calculation depends on the nature of the 
business and relationship with the sales channels. If the customer (retailer) 
assesses delivery performance based on the number of units delivered in a 
timely manner, the SKU fill rate is to be used. However, if the customer is a 
distributor and does not penalize for late deliveries, the manufacturer may 
choose to use the value fill rate to estimate lost revenue.
The assessment of product availability in a retail environment is based on 
out-of-stock (OOS) events. An OOS situation is one in which a consumer is 
unable to find a specific product on a retail shelf. Because an OOS represents 
a lost sale, it is an important metric for the retailer. It is also becoming increas-
ingly important for manufacturers because the lost opportunity is greater. 
Although retailers may not lose revenue if a substitute product from another 
manufacturer is available for the customer, manufacturers lose the entire pro-
ceeds due to unavailability.
Both OOS and fill rates measure product availability and the customer expe-
rience. Fill rates are appropriate when responding to customers' purchase 
orders; whereas OOSs are appropriate when demand needs to be satisfied 
immediately, as shown in Figure 7-3.

The Profitable Supply Chain
233
OOS measurements are not easy to perform if inventory reviews are done 
on a periodic basis, because it is difficult to determine the duration for which 
the product was unavailable. Recent advances in the use of perpetual inven-
tory systems that utilize scan data to keep track of sales allow for better 
measurements. Once the time at which an item goes OOS is determined, it 
can be used to calculate the duration for which the OOS occurs (i.e., until the 
next replenishment occurs). The OOS metric is then calculated as the OOS 
duration divided by the time between replenishments.  Common reasons for 
OOS include the following:
The product is in the back room but not in the shelf.
• 
The shelf space allocated to the product does not match 
• 
its rate of consumption (demand) and replenishment 
schedule.
Insufficient inventory exists in the supply chain (that 
• 
is, at the retailer’s distribution center or with the 
manufacturer).
Figure 7-3.  Fill rates and out-of-stock metrics for various business environments

Chapter 7 | Supply Chain Performance Review
234
Diagnostic measures that can support OOS analysis include shelf space alloca-
tion to address the issue of inadequate shelf space and a review of the inventory 
policy. Shelf place allocation can be calculated according to Equation 7-11:
Shelf space allocation= Number of items that can be stocked on shelf
Expected demand for the replenishment period
 (7-11)
For example, if the number of units of an item replenished every 3 days is 30 
and the expected demand over these 3 days is also 30 units (at 10 units per 
day), then the shelf space allocation is calculated to be 1, indicating that suf-
ficient space exists for the expected demand.
Equation 7-11 results in only 50% service levels. If 95% service levels are 
desired, the service-level method described in Chapter 2 can be used to modify  
the calculation, as shown below in Equation 7-12:
Shelf space allocation
       =
Number of items that can be stocked on shelf
Supply for 95% coverage over replenishment period
	
(7-12)
In Equation 7-12, supply for 95% coverage is calculated as the expected 
demand over the {replenishment period + [1.65 * (standard deviation of fore-
cast error)]}.
In the previous example, if the standard deviation of demand is 2 units per day, 
the standard deviation over the replenishment is (Square root(3) * 2) = 3.5 
units, and the denominator is [30 + (1.65*3.5)] = 36 units. This results in a shelf 
space allocation of (30/36) = 83%, indicating that shelf space is insufficient.
The inventory policy in use can be studied in a similar manner. If a periodic 
review is performed, then the order-to-level is set equal to the supply for 95% 
coverage over the replenishment period, and the order quantity is determined 
accordingly.
A broader view of diagnosing fill rate issues requires analyzing demand vari-
ability and supply or safety stock issues. Forecast accuracy is the most impor-
tant single metric for gauging the effectiveness of the forecasting process. 
The most common metrics for measuring forecast accuracy—mean absolute 
percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute deviation (MAD), root mean square error 
(RMSE), and forecast bias—were described in detail in Chapter 3.

The Profitable Supply Chain
235
Inventory or safety stock metrics include days-of-inventory and inventory turns, 
defined as follow:
	
Days-of-inventory
Onhand inventory (units)
Expected daily deman
=
d (units)
Inventory turns=
Annual cost of sales
Value of onhand inventory

(7-13)
	
The first step in the diagnostic procedure is to review inventory levels. If these 
levels are low, then an analysis at a product or item level is required to deter-
mine whether low supplies are due to manufacturing or supplier issues.
If sales are higher than the demand forecast, a lack of forecast accuracy con-
tributes to the deterioration in fill rates. The first step in analyzing forecast 
error is to examine the bias. Determination of a biased qualitative forecast 
requires the forecaster to take corrective steps such as attaching a lower level 
of confidence to sales inputs or multiplying the forecast by a corrective factor. 
Such a determination further requires the forecaster to examine the data to 
identify changes in the underlying trends and seasonal factors and to adjust 
the forecasting parameters accordingly.
After reviewing for bias, the next step is to check for forecast distortion. If it is 
found, the responsible customers and account representatives must be con-
tacted, the causes identified (such as one-time demand or replenishment poli-
cies), and the appropriate adjustments made. Finally, if the number of outliers 
is increasing, then causal factors need to be identified and incorporated into 
the forecasting process.
It is possible for both demand and supply measurements to be adequate, 
indicating that the inventory policy and model being used are not performing 
satisfactorily. Underperformance might be caused by departures from some of 
the underlying assumptions, such as the nature of the demand distribution and 
demand correlation. In such cases, the model may need to be modified or the 
target service level increased to compensate for these unknown factors.
One of the difficulties in performing the above review and analysis is that fill 
rates may not be captured accurately, as often proves the case with high-value 
sales and strategic customer accounts. For example, if a salesman is aware of 
low inventory levels for a particular product and guides a customer toward 
the purchase of an alternate product, calculations based on sales and inven-
tory will fail to capture this shortfall. In fact, the data can lead the analyst to 
believe that the inventory planning process is performing adequately, which 
can be contrary to the belief of the rest of the organization and the company's 
customers. In such situations, it is necessary to augment the quantitative mea-
surement with surveys and interviews with the sales and marketing division 

Chapter 7 | Supply Chain Performance Review
236
and with channel partners. Any perception that a particular product is always 
in short supply needs to be considered while setting inventory parameters 
and safety stock levels.
Financial Metrics for Supply Chain
The financial metrics for the supply chain are cost of goods sold (COGS) and 
gross margin return on operating assets (GMROOA). Cost of goods include all 
direct costs, including production, raw materials, transportation, and storage. 
The equation for GMROOA is shown below.
	
	
GMROOA =
Gross margin
Operating assets

(7-14)
Examples of a COGS analysis and GMROOA analysis are shown in Table 7-6. 
The “cost detail” section of the table summarizes the cost contribution from 
the different sections of the supply chain. In this example, unit costs have 
increased for raw materials, production, and transportation. The cost variance 
for each line may be further analyzed, based on the procedure described pre-
viously for manufacturing, procurement, and transportation functions.

Operating assets include all assets used for generating revenues, including fixed 
assets such machinery in the plants and distribution centers, transportation 
assets owned by the company, and nonfixed assets such as inventory. For 
the purposes of measuring the efficiency of the supply chain, cash that is not 
required to operate the business is not included in the operating asset cal-
culation. GMROOA is a measure of the efficiency with which a company uti-
lizes its investment to make a profit, such that a higher value indicates better 
performance. It is a useful measure for comparing the performance across 
product lines, divisions, and companies. GMROOA can be increased by either 
increasing gross margin or by decreasing operating assets.
In addition to these operational and financial metrics, the supply chain orga-
nization needs to be evaluated on the basis of the speed and effectiveness of 
completing tasks related to demand and supply coordination activities. This is 
the time taken to complete the planning cycle, consisting of planning (demand, 
inventories, production, shipments, and purchases) and communicating with 
suppliers and customers. This measure of planning cycle time is a combination 
of the systems and manual steps required to complete the plan. It is especially 
important in dynamic environments in which demand and supply situations 
may change frequently.
The cost of operating the supply chain department also needs to be evaluated. 
The supply chain management overhead includes the following costs:
Salaries for demand, inventory, production planners and 
• 
executives
Facility costs for supply chain personnel
• 
Travel costs for managing the different facilities
• 
Maintenance and support costs for supply chain systems

Industry rates for this overhead cost vary between 0.5% and 3% of revenue, 
depending on the nature of the business and the complexity of the operations. 
Of greater significance than the absolute value is the trend of these costs 
over time, which should be monitored to ensure a flat or downward trend in 
costs relative to revenue. If this metric spikes following an expensive systems 
implementation, it needs to be justified by a corresponding reduction in unit 
costs or increase in fill rates.
Continuous Improvement
Companies are constantly looking for ways to deliver additional margins 
and shareholder value. A continuous improvement program is one of the 
most important efforts in delivering on this objective. The preceding section 
described metrics for tracking performance for a product across time periods 
in order to identify and address any deterioration. This section compares the 
relative performance of products, suppliers, and customers in order to iden-
tify underperformers and rationalize the portfolio. Such a relative comparison 
becomes increasingly important as a company grows in size. Large companies 
may have over hundreds of thousands of products and thousands of suppliers 
and customers. On account of this proliferation, there are frequent opportu-
nities to phase out underperforming products, reduce the reliance and spend 
on underperforming suppliers, and change pricing and fulfillment terms with 
low-margin customers.
Product Performance and Rationalization
The primary reason for evaluating the relative performance of products is 
product proliferation, which may result from the following factors:
Global presence, requiring different sets of products to 
• 
satisfy variations in local demand
Products not being phased out after the introduction of 
• 
“replacement” products
Sales incentives geared towards revenue targets, which 
• 
rewards salespeople's accommodation of customer 
choice in product configuration
Mergers and acquisitions resulting in redundant or over-
• 
lapping product lines
Special accommodations for different customers’ packag-
• 
ing requirements or languages

The Profitable Supply Chain
239
Consider the following excerpt from an annual report of Levi Strauss, an 
apparel manufacturer:
Trends Affecting our Business: Brand and product proliferation continues 
around the world as we and other companies compete through 
differentiated brands and products targeted for specific consumers, 
price-points and retail segments. In addition, the ways of marketing these 
brands are changing to new mediums, challenging the effectiveness of 
more mass-market approaches such as television advertising.
Quality low-cost sourcing alternatives continue to emerge around the 
world, resulting in pricing pressure and minimal barriers to entry for new 
competitors. This proliferation of low-cost sourcing alternatives enables 
competitors to attract consumers with a constant flow of competitively-
priced new products that reflect the newest styles, bringing additional 
pressure on us and other wholesalers and retailers to shorten lead-times 
and reduce costs. In response, we must continue to seek efficiencies 
throughout our global supply chain.
—Levi Strauss & Co., 2010 Annual Report
This proliferation trend is seen in almost all consumer-oriented industries, 
including apparel, footwear, electronics, and consumer durables. The need to 
constantly evaluate the product offering in order to weed out underperform-
ers is emphasized in the following excerpt from an annual report Bausch & 
Lomb, a contact lens manufacturer:
We pioneered the development of soft contact lens technology and are one 
of the largest manufacturers of contact lenses in the world. Our product 
portfolio is one of the broadest in the industry and includes traditional, 
planned replacement disposable, daily disposable, multifocal, and toric soft 
contact lenses and rigid gas permeable (RGP) materials. These products 
are marketed by our own sales force and through distributors to licensed 
eye care professionals and health product retailers.
Net sales of contact lenses constituted 31 percent of our total revenues in 
fiscal year 2006, and declined 3 percent from the prior year. Overall strong 
double-digit growth in our PureVision lines of silicone hydrogel contact lenses 
was more than offset by lower sales of two-week spherical contact lenses 
in Japan (reflecting overall market trends), SofLens Toric disposable contact 
lenses (resulting from the continued roll-out of PureVision Toric in the U.S. 
market), collateral negative impact on our Asian contact lens business 
resulting from the MoistureLoc recall, and lower sales of older technology 
products (reflecting ongoing product rationalization initiatives).
—Bausch & Lomb Inc., 2009 Annual Report

Chapter 7 | Supply Chain Performance Review
240
The traditional method for identifying underperformers is to create a Pareto 
chart of revenue contribution, with the bottom fraction being candidates for 
rationalization. Following this analysis, the analyst interviews the engineer-
ing and marketing organizations and customers regarding the value provided 
by these products, and any products that are so identified as unnecessary 
become candidates for phase-out.
This simple method for identifying underperformers can however be mis-
leading. For example, a product might have been recently introduced and its 
sales might still be ramping up. Or a product might contribute insignificantly 
towards revenues yet still be highly profitable. It is therefore necessary to 
identify better gauges of product performance. One such metric is the gross 
margin return on inventory (GMROI). Two forms of this return-on-assets mea-
sure, which considers only the inventory investment, are defined as follows:
Average annual GMROI=
Annual gross margin
Average month end value of inventory
Expected GMROI=
Expected annual gross margin
Average optimal inventory investment
      (7-15)
	
The average annual GMROI is the actual measurement, based on annual sales 
and on-hand inventories. (The analyst may alternatively calculate monthly or 
weekly returns.) Expected GMROI is based on expected values of gross margin, 
calculated from the inventory models described in Chapter 2.
Challenges in measuring average annual GMROI include the following:
• 
Capturing costs accurately. Gross profits for a product need 
to reflect the true cost associated with producing, trans-
porting, storing, and delivering the product. However, 
many companies often do not capture costs with ade-
quate detail to support this view. For example, overtime 
labor costs may be incurred in order to satisfy an unan-
ticipated order for a single product, but if the company 
simply allocates labor costs for the entire week, then the 
additional cost will be spread across all products, which 
can distort the margin estimation.
• 
Tracking inventory accurately. On-hand inventory used in 
calculating GMROI is often based on an end-of-week 
or end-of-month recording. However, shipments may be 
received into inventory according to a different schedule. 
Consider, for example, a distribution center that receives 
shipments sporadically. In one week, a shipment is received 

The Profitable Supply Chain
241
to cover two weeks of demand, which will result in high 
inventory levels the first week but far lower levels the fol-
lowing week. The measured GMROI for these two weeks 
will be very different.
Averaging inventory values over several weeks will partially address the second 
issue but create the different problem that any upward or downward trends 
will be masked and not discovered for several weeks. Owing to these mea-
surement challenges, the expected GMROI is a better measure for comparing 
product performance. In this equation, calculate expected annual gross margin 
by the methods described in Chapter 2 for the Newsvendor or Incremental 
Margin models. Then perform product rationalization by Pareto analysis on 
the GMROI values.
Supplier Performance and Rationalization
Product breadth combined with multinational presence has resulted in a prolif-
eration in the number of suppliers from which a company sources its products. 
For example, the home improvement retailer Lowe's sources products from 
more than 7,000 vendors worldwide (2013), and retail giant Walmart has more 
than 60,000 vendors. Supplier proliferation may also occur in result of acquisi-
tions and mergers, or when engineering teams within a company fail to collabo-
rate on sourcing decisions. The following excerpt from an Estée Lauder annual 
report provides several important reasons for rationalizing the supply base:
The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are 
essential oils, alcohol and specialty chemicals.  We also purchase packaging 
components that are manufactured to our design specifications.  Procurement 
of materials for all manufacturing facilities is generally made on a global 
basis through our Global Supplier Relations department.  We are making a 
concentrated effort in supplier rationalization with the specific objective of 
reducing costs, increasing innovation and speed to market and improving 
quality.  In addition, we continue to focus on supply sourcing within the 
region of manufacture to allow for improved supply chain efficiencies.  As 
a result of sourcing initiatives, there is increased dependency on certain 
suppliers, but we believe that our portfolio of these suppliers has adequate 
resources and facilities to overcome any unforeseen interruption of supply.  
In the past, we have been able to obtain an adequate supply of essential 
raw materials and currently believe we have adequate sources of supply 
for virtually all components of our products.

Chapter 7 | Supply Chain Performance Review
242
We are continually benchmarking the performance of the supply chain and 
will change suppliers, and adjust our distribution networks and manufacturing 
footprint based upon the changing needs of the business.  As we integrate 
acquired brands, we continually seek new ways to leverage our production 
and sourcing capabilities to improve our overall supply chain performance.
—Estée Lauder Companies Inc., 2010 Annual Report
The company emphasizes that several benefits accrue from supplier rational-
ization. Costs can be reduced because increasing the quantity purchased from 
a smaller supply base can be used to negotiate better prices. Also, increasing 
the reliance on suppliers who are more inclined to invest in research can help 
increase innovation. Therefore, it is important for a company with a diverse 
supply base to clearly communicate metrics and targets to its suppliers so that 
performance can be evaluated on a periodic basis.
This view is likewise emphasized in an annual report of the Intel Corporation, 
a semiconductor manufacturer:
We have thousands of suppliers, including subcontractors, providing our 
various materials and service needs. We set expectations for supplier 
performance and reinforce those expectations with periodic assessments. 
We communicate those expectations to our suppliers regularly and work 
with them to implement improvements when necessary. We seek, where 
possible, to have several sources of supply for all of these materials and 
resources, but we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers, 
or upon suppliers in a single country. In those cases, we develop and 
implement plans and actions to reduce the exposure that would result 
from a disruption in supply. We have entered into long-term contracts 
with certain suppliers to ensure a portion of our silicon supply.
—Intel Corporation, 2013 Annual Report
A rigorous process for monitoring and reviewing supplier performance is enabled 
by the use scorecards. Supplier scorecards are a way for the buyer to specify per-
formance metrics and goals, track performance on a periodic basis, and rank the 
suppliers. Examples of metrics that are often included in the scorecard are:
• 
Delivery performance. The most common measures include 
performance to lead time and performance to specified ship 
date. This former measures the ability of the supplier to 
meet advertised lead times for the product. The latter is 
related to meeting the committed date, which might dif-
fer from the advertised lead time. Resolution steps include 
implementing a rigorous ordering process, the use of tech-
nologies such as electronic data interchange (EDI) for system 
communication, and the communication of forecasts to the 
supplier to improve alignment of capacity with demand.

The Profitable Supply Chain
243
• 
Customer service. A qualitative assessment of the sup-
plier's ability and willingness to support the company's 
objectives, changes, or new requirements. Other factors 
to be assessed include warranty coverage, ease of pro-
cessing returns, and early payment discounts.
• 
Process sophistication. A qualitative assessment of the sup-
plier's systems and processes. Whereas the implemen-
tation of quality management procedures and planning 
systems have an immediate impact on quality and deliv-
ery metrics, overall process sophistication provides an 
assessment of the supplier's ability to grow and support 
the company's longer term objectives.
• 
Purchase price variance.  A measure of the supplier's adher-
ence to advertised prices. For certain commodities or 
standard items, a metric that compares actual prices with 
market values can be included to assess the supplier's 
willingness to share cost savings.
An example of a scorecard that collates this information is given in Table 7-7. 
In the example, all the metrics are converted into percentage values, with a 
value greater than 100%, indicating better than the expectation. The calcula-
tion of an overall metric requires that weights be attached to each of the cat-
egories, allowing for different suppliers to be compared. Sharing the scorecard 
or just the overall performance with suppliers helps them identify problem 
areas and provides an incentive for improvement.

Customer Performance
Companies that sell products primarily to other businesses might accumulate 
hundreds or thousands of manufacturer and distributor customer accounts. 
In such situations, a customer rationalization effort may be required to ensure 
the right pricing and fulfillment terms, as exemplified in the following excerpt 
from an annual report.
OEM Segment: For 2009, net sales were $113.2 million, as compared 
to $302.2 million for 2008, a decrease of $189.0 million, or 62.5%. 
As noted above in our discussion of consolidated results, this decrease 
was due to a decline in sales volumes and copper prices as compared 
to 2008. For 2009, our OEM segment sales volume (measured in total 
pounds shipped) decreased 49.5% compared to 2008. In addition to the 
impact of recessionary conditions prevalent throughout 2009, the decline 
in volume also reflected the impact of our customer rationalization efforts 
within OEM. In late 2008, we decided to reduce the extent of our sales 
to many customers within this segment as a result of failing to secure 
adequate pricing for our products from such customers. We determined 
these actions were necessary to improve the overall financial performance 
of the Company. As our OEM customer rationalization was completed in 
late 2008, we do not anticipate any further impact to our OEM revenues 
from such rationalization efforts.
—Coleman Cable Inc., 2010 Annual Report
As with products, customer-specific activities and policies can have a sig-
nificant impact on profits for manufacturers and distributors. In a build-to-
order environment, the cost to serve each customer can be easily calculated 
because each order can be tracked and analyzed. However, customer-specific 
costs are harder to track in a build-to-stock environment because, in most 
cases, receiving and handling costs are assigned to products based on sales 
volumes or cost of goods. Calculating customer-specific costs requires the use 
of activity-based costing to understand the impact of special handling require-
ments, sales volumes, and delivery distances. The calculation of activity costs 
needs to include assignment of labor costs related to receiving, order selec-
tion, and trailer-loading to specific items and orders. Similarly, facility costs 
can be assigned to products based on the space required for stocking and the 
duration they are stocked. Such an assignment allocates a greater proportion 
of fixed costs to slow-moving items because they sit on the shelf for longer, 
and it is a valid estimate of costs if storage-space utilization is high. Trucking 
costs can be assigned based on the number of products in the shipment and 
the distance traveled to the customer's warehouse or store. In addition, the 
time spent unloading at the customer's facility can be a significant cost con-
tributor because it ties up valuable time. Full truckloads and quick unloading 
tend to reduce unit delivery cost.

The Profitable Supply Chain
245
Once such a model is in place, it is possible to gain insight into the cost 
to serve each customer, which allows for the calculation of accurate cus-
tomer margins. Once low-margin customers have been identified, a program 
to improve pricing and fulfillment terms can be initiated.
Summary
This chapter introduced several methods for reviewing performance and rap-
idly identifying deterioration and problem areas. The metrics described in this 
chapter are general guidelines. To ensure that costs are kept in line with the 
benefits, each company must devise its own special metrics tailored to the 
steps and processes that differentiate it from the competition.
Clear specification of the different types of metrics—primary and diagnostic 
(or supporting)—is very important for improvement. For example, manufac-
turing capacity utilization is a diagnostic metric for delivery performance. If, 
however, it is treated instead as a primary metric and the manufacturing orga-
nization attempts to maximize manufacturing capacity utilization in isolation 
from other metrics, excess production in inventory buildup and scrap might 
be the costly consequence. The examples of primary and diagnostic metrics 
for various departments supplied in this chapter are offered as starting points 
for companies in designing appropriate performance review processes.
Properly implemented and maintained, the review process can serve as a 
repository of information regarding usual and unusual issues faced, actions 
that were taken, and the benefits obtained by employing various strategies. 
Such knowledge can help orient new personnel and enhance a company's 
institutional memory, so reducing the risk of repeating costly mistakes.

The Evolving 
Supply Chain
Almost every industry has experienced one or more significant changes in 
the last few decades, driven by changes in the areas of manufacturing, fulfill-
ment, technology, and the customer experience. One such example is the 
Toyota Production System (TPS), also referred to as just-in-time production ( JIT). 
Introduced by the automotive manufacturer Toyota, TPS was instrumental in 
changing the approach toward managing the flow of material in the factory, 
based on goals of reducing waste, such as over-production, machine or opera-
tor wait time, raw material inventory, and rework or scrap. By employing  
TPS, Toyota greatly reduced lead time and costs, while improving product 
quality. TPS is regarded as the precursor to lean manufacturing, and has had an 
enormous impact on the automotive industry in particular and manufacturing 
in general.
Dell Computer Corporation similarly transformed the computer industry 
with the use of a direct sales model. By connecting directly with customers, 
Dell was better able to understand specific needs and provide the most effec-
tive computer system to meet those needs. Also, by connecting directly to 
customers and suppliers, Dell obtained the benefits of a tightly coordinated 
supply chain normally associated with vertically integrated companies. From 
its inception in 1984, the company was able to grow at roughly five times the 
industry rate in its first 14 years, illustrating the scalability enabled by the 
direct model.
Dell successfully incorporated the Internet into the model by providing con-
figurable solutions, customer-specific pages, and a wealth of information. In 
addition, the company used the Internet to connect to its top twenty suppli-
ers in order to exchange information rapidly related to capacities, capabilities,

inventory in the supply lines, component quality, and cost structures. This has 
allowed the company to reduce inventories significantly, an important achieve-
ment in an industry that experiences significant price erosion and component 
obsolescence.
The extraordinary success of the business model is apparent in the financial 
results, with 1998 revenues of $12 billion and 2008 revenues of $61 billion. 
However, even when a company has experienced significant success, it is neces-
sary to constantly monitor the market environment and make adjustments to 
the model. Indeed, Dell alludes to such a situation in its 2008 annual report:
Consumer Segment: Revitalizing our U.S. consumer business was a key 
priority this year. We made a number of changes aimed at increasing 
growth in unit shipments, revenue and profitability. By year end, we were 
pleased with the overall momentum and innovation we achieved in this 
important segment.
Against a backdrop of intense competitive pressure, particularly in the 
lower-priced desktops and notebooks, we evolved our consumer business 
model and have entered into a number of retail partnerships worldwide 
to complement and extend our existing direct business. By the end of 
fiscal 2008, Dell was available in more than 12,000 retail outlets, giving 
customers more choice than ever. We also introduced a number of new 
products to appeal to consumers, recognizing the increasing importance 
of product personalization, from product appearance to the ability to see 
and buy products wherever customers want.
—Dell Computer Corporation, 2008 Annual Report
Dell created the original direct sales model for a particular market environ-
ment and consumer profile. The excerpt above reflects the impact of com-
petition and product preferences on the business, compelling the direct sales 
model be augmented by a traditional retail outlet model.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC) is a company that 
pioneered the outsourced manufacturing business model in the semiconduc-
tor industry. Up to the 1980s, the semiconductor industry was vertically inte-
grated, with companies performing research and development, wafer fabrication,  
chip manufacturing, assembly, and testing. With the cost of setting up a wafer 
fabrication facility of the order of several billion U. S. dollars, only the largest 
companies could compete. This landscape changed when TSMC established a  
wafer fabrication facility (also referred to as a foundry). Research-oriented  
“fabless” companies were now free to focus on design and innovation and could 
utilize a portion of TSMC’s manufacturing capacity to deliver products at a com-
petitive price. This revolutionary business model allowed TSMC to grow rev-
enues at an extremely rapid pace, from inception in 1987 to over $300 million 
(U.S. dollars) in 1993, over $1 billion in 1997, and over $20 billion in 2013.

The Profitable Supply Chain
These are just a few examples of companies that have taken advantage of 
advances in systems, operating models, and customer interactions in order to 
gain an edge over the competition or even change the industry. What kind 
of advances in the future will provide such opportunities? The answer to that 
question is uncertain, but the next section offers several examples of trends 
that with disruptive potential.
Developments in Information Systems
Prior to the Internet, companies predominantly relied on product sales data 
and second-hand information regarding demand to make important business 
decisions. With the advent of the Internet, there has been an explosion in 
the amount of information that is available. As companies increasingly rely on 
external information for making decisions, the chance of being blindsided by 
unforeseen events has decreased. Demand planning will be greatly impacted 
by this trend, being highly dependent on external conditions. The increasing 
availability and timeliness of useful economic data collected by governments 
and agencies is already occurring. It is only a matter of time before the use 
of this data in the forecasting process becomes commonplace. Similarly, envi-
ronmental factors, including weather and accessibility, will be useful for adjust-
ing the timing of supplies and inventory levels. Competitive activities such as 
promotions and new products are a source of much surprise in the current 
environment. Increasingly, the speed with which the news and details of these 
actions become available will increase, allowing companies to respond rapidly. 
Another rich source of information is the consumer loyalty program, which 
provides data related to consumer-level information on usage, preferences, 
and impending needs.
Similarly, inventory management will continue to increase the amount of infor-
mation analyzed in order to reduce supply disruptions, lead times, and cost 
variances. Methods for tracking goods in production or in-transit have already 
found widespread use, with information being displayed to the customer for 
build-to-order products. In addition, use of information that can influence 
delivery of supplies may become commonplace, such as weather and regula-
tory changes.
Radio-frequency identification (RFID)  is a data retrieval method that uses RFID 
tags to store data and an RFID reader to retrieve data. RFID is similar in 
concept to barcodes but with a number of important differences. RFID read-
ers do not require a direct line of sight, as opposed to barcode readers. The 
reading range is significantly more for RFID (up to 300 feet for RFID versus 
approximately 15 feet for barcodes). RFID is more rugged and can be pro-
tected in a plastic cover, whereas barcodes need to be exposed on the outside 
of the product. Finally, RFID tags have read and write capabilities, allowing 
readers to alter the information on the tag. Adoption of RFID will no doubt

continue, with the primary focus on monitoring inventory in the supply chain. 
Over time, it is possible that the use of such sensing technologies, combined 
with advances in other areas, will have a steadily increasing impact on delivery 
and on the customer experience.
Along with the gathering of data, improvements in the presentation of infor-
mation will help manage complexity due to large number of dimensions and 
data volumes. These improvements will probably come from advances in user 
interface technology and devices, as well as contributions from the sciences 
of data graphics and statistical analysis.
Systems have traditionally been developed and deployed on a personal com-
puter for single users or on a server with client access for multiple users. 
With Internet and intranet applications, this has gradually been replaced by 
web servers and browser clients, allowing for ready access across a broader 
client base. The increase in the number of supply chain software as a service 
delivered over the Internet is termed as the software-as-a-service (SaaS) model, 
and promises to provide companies with easy access to new capabilities that 
can augment enterprise systems. In this model, the service provider bears the 
onus of software development and maintenance and makes the application 
available over the Internet for a monthly or annual fee. As a result, companies 
can experiment with and implement new ideas at a fraction of the cost asso-
ciated with enterprise systems. In return, service providers will be provided 
with shorter sales cycles and more predictable revenue streams.
The specific models for delivery of software services will depend on the nature 
of the application. The application service provider (ASP) model delivers soft-
ware hosted on the Internet to a single customer; this single instance being 
required to circumvent data sensitivity or scale issues. In contrast, on-demand 
software will tend to offer the service to many customers on a single server 
(a multi-tenancy model). While this model reduces the cost associated with 
software, there are some real challenges to be addressed. These include secu-
rity, system responsiveness, monitoring and restoring the service in case of an 
outage, and support for fixing issues and incorporating enhancements. These 
significant challenges will take time to address and may retard the speed of 
adoption. Two successful examples of such offerings are Salesforce.com and 
GT Nexus. Salesforce.com provides customer relationship management 
(CRM)  software for a company’s sales organization to manage its leads and 
the ordering process. Widespread acceptance of this company’s on-demand 
offering has resulted in phenomenal revenue growth, from approximately $20 
million in 2002 to over $3 billion in 2013. The on-demand software provided 
by GT Nexus is targeted toward providing transparency in the often complex 
multi-modal and cross-border transportation segment, and is gaining accep-
tance among importers, exporters, and logistics providers. Clearly, both these 
offerings target areas characterized by significant activity that occurs outside 
the company’s domain. Over time, increasing maturity of the delivery model 
will allow additional areas to be offered on-demand.

251
The Profitable Supply Chain
Developments in Production and Fulfillment
The predominant trend in manufacturing in the last decade has been outsourcing 
and offshoring, with the promise of lower labor costs and access to flexible capac-
ity. However, growing wages in established manufacturing countries, along with 
rising fuel prices and growth of new markets in developing countries may result 
in the movement of manufacturing bases to new countries closer to demand 
(commonly referred to as near-shoring). Since this will present many operational 
challenges due to differing cultural policies and infrastructures across countries, 
the importance of contract manufacturers with a presence in several countries 
may become an important consideration in the selection process.
Yet another manufacturing trend that has gained traction and promises to 
continue to grow in popularity is postponement. Postponement refers to the 
method of designing and manufacturing configurable products that can be dif-
ferentiated quickly and inexpensively once customer demand is known. This 
deferred differentiation of product allows for fill rates to be maintained or 
improved, while simultaneously decreasing inventory and manufacturing costs. 
Postponement is not a new concept, and it has already been implemented 
by several companies and industries. It is fairly safe to predict that the con-
cept and benefit of postponement will become common knowledge, and an 
increasing number of companies will design products accordingly.
It’s safe to say that rising energy costs will have a big impact on the transporta-
tion industry. As transportation costs become a larger portion of the cost-of-
goods, network optimization to modify routings based on demand and prices 
will gain importance. The increasing reliance on third-party warehousing and 
transportation providers will allow companies to modify stocking locations 
and routings without the inertia present in company-owned operations.
A more direct approach to combat rising fuel costs is to increase the reliance 
on unmanned aerial vehicles, also referred to as drones.  Governmental legis-
lation is being sought to allow distribution and transportation companies to 
operate a fleet of drones for delivering packages, and this will prove to be par-
ticularly effective for small package shipments and for delivery to rural areas.
Advances in fulfillment of demand and the customer experience can have 
an enormous impact on the supply chain. The rapid increase in embedded  
technology and intelligence in consumer appliances and in consumer goods, 
such as embedded devices or RFID, can provide an enormous amount of 
demand-related information to manufacturers regarding product usage and 
replenishment. The incorporation of drop shipments from manufacturers 
directly to customers or consumers also has the potential to become more 
commonplace and change the way orders are fulfilled.

Chapter 8 | The Evolving Supply Chain
252
The Impact of 3D Printing
3D printing, also referred to as additive manufacturing, holds the promise of rev-
olutionizing manufacturing and the supply chain. 3D printing is the procedure 
in which the printer reads the digital blueprint and methodically adds material 
according to a set of instructions, creating the final product, which is built layer 
by layer. Contrast this with current methods, which use subtractive manufac-
turing, whereby material is whittled away to form the final part. The list of 
materials and parts that can be addressed by 3D printing continues to grow 
and is already used by the R&D departments in several industries, including 
automotive, aerospace, and toys. This technology can provide immense manu-
facturing flexibility, eliminate tooling costs, and simplify production runs.
The impact of 3D printing on the supply chain can be significant, and can enable 
a greater level of postponement than was previously possible. Companies may 
not have to hold inventory of finished products, but instead store them at an 
intermediate or raw material stage that can easily be used to generate the 
configuration requested by the customer. 3D printing is still in its early stages 
as far as mass production is concerned, but it holds the promise of playing a 
much bigger part by 2020.
The Integration of Pricing and SCM
The traditional view of pricing is that it should be determined by the  
consumer’s and market’s perception of the value delivered by the product. 
While this perception may be valid for certain highly-differentiated and trendy 
products, an increasing number of companies do not have this luxury due to 
intense competition and the availability of numerous similar products in the 
market. In such cases, the constant downward pressure on price requires  
integration with costs, and consideration of direct costs, inventory levels, and 
capacity levels while setting price. While this procedure appears intuitive, 
there are many practical challenges that need to be addressed. For example, 
the theory required to explicitly connect these variables is not readily avail-
able. Organizational dissonance due to shared responsibility of pricing is another  
common impediment. Sending the wrong message to the market regarding price 
stability is another concern. But the benefit provided is high enough that these 
issues will eventually be addressed and pricing may become increasingly dynamic.
The Real-Time Supply Chain
A much-anticipated development in SCM is the ability to sense and respond 
to events in real-time. This development is enabled by the Internet, avail-
ability of data, high bandwidth connections, mobile devices, and sophisticated  
systems. Such a development can give rise to highly responsive and efficient 

253
The Profitable Supply Chain
supply chains. While many activities continue to require manual interven-
tion and discussions between concerned parties, there is no doubt that the 
number of activities and alerts that will be dealt with in a real-time manner 
will increase, especially with the use of better management methods that set 
bounds within which automated responses are approved.
The Green Supply Chain
The green (environmentally friendly) supply chain is gaining importance as the 
public becomes more aware of global warming and carbon footprint. Aside 
from a desire to help the environment, reasons for companies to get involved 
in green initiatives include customer requirements (for example, Walmart’s 
requirements from its suppliers), regulatory requirements, media attention, 
and competitive pressure. Finally, many companies see an opportunity to 
increase prices by advertising the environmental benefits of green products. 
Consider the following except from Walmart’s annual report:
Environmental responsibility. We’re focused on responsible energy consumption 
globally and now obtain approximately 21 percent of our electricity from 
renewable sources. Walmart has the most onsite solar capacity of any 
business in the U.S., according to the EPA. Our goal remains “zero waste” and, 
to reach it, we’re rethinking processes, using smarter packaging, recycling 
and reducing plastic bag use. In addition, we’re applying and scaling the 
Sustainability Index – a tool to measure and drive the sustainability qualities 
of products. As part of this global effort, Walmart committed to buying 70 
percent of the goods sold in U.S. stores and clubs only from suppliers who 
use the index by the end of 2017.
—Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 2013 Annual Report
Ways of measuring the green value of a product or supply chain include the 
following:
Greenhouse gases (CO
• 
2) emitted during production. 
Fueled by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and 
other similar initiatives, there is a push toward the col-
lection of data related to strategies deployed by large 
companies in relation to climate change. In response, 
companies such as Walmart have directed their suppliers 
toward the collection of such data.
The use of renewable energy in the manufacturing process.
• 

Chapter 8 | The Evolving Supply Chain

Green packaging, measured by space utilization (cube 
• 
utilization) as well as weight. Utilization of space can be 
improved by shrinking packages to the optimal size and 
weight for their contents. Often, minor changes in the 
design of the product can result in significant savings, such 
as the use of smaller and lighter cap for bottles. Weight 
can be reduced by the use of foam boxes and shrink wrap 
as opposed to heavier corrugated cardboard.
The use of renewable or recycled materials for packag-
• 
ing. Equally important is a process for easily collecting 
recyclable materials.
The distance that the product is transported, which is 
• 
influenced by the effectiveness of the network. 
Changes to the supply chain fall into two broad categories: The first involves 
low-cost changes that can significantly impact the carbon footprint, such as 
better packaging and minor routing changes to the transportation network 
are examples. These changes are attractive to a company because they can be 
advertised advantageously and reduce operating costs. The second category 
involves changes that require a moderate or high level of investment. Changes 
to product design and production processes often fall in this category due to 
the need to purchase new machinery or make expensive changes to manu-
facturing steps. These expenses may be justified by evaluating the impact on 
market perception, regulatory compliance, and product differentiation. It may 
be possible for the company to differentiate its products, increase price or 
sales volumes, and more than recover its investment.
Summary
This chapter discussed a few trends that can impact the way supply chains 
function. Staying on top of new developments is not an easy task, and it is 
necessary for practitioners to remain updated by visiting conferences and 
entertaining vendor discussions (suppliers as well as software providers). The 
proliferation of web-based presentations and virtual conferences makes the 
task of remaining updated a lot less expensive and time consuming.
Finally, it is important to recognize some of the most important drivers of 
supply chains—greater profits and a better customer experience. Since com-
pany executives and shareholders are constantly looking to improve both 
measures, the result is a constantly mutating supply chain. Practitioners who 
accept this situation and embrace change can play an important role in the 
viability and profitability of the business.

World Class 
Supply Chain 
Management: 
Key Takeaways
Supply chain management is the process of efficiently coordinating the flow 
of material across suppliers, transportation providers, manufacturers, dis-
tributors, and retailers. Executed properly, SCM improves customer service 
and revenue achievement while reducing operating costs. Achieving this goal 
requires a structured approach toward managing production, distribution, and 
working capital. This book introduced the concepts, mathematical models, 
and process steps required to realize these improvements. This concluding 
chapter summarizes the book’s takeaways.
Establish an effective costing framework to enable decision-making. 
Often, a company identifies costs based on the activity being performed in 
the areas of warehousing, transportation, and manufacturing. However, effec-
tive decision-making often requires different views of these costs, such as a 
breakdown of transportation costs by standard mode vs. expedited mode. 
Such categorization of costs can help identify problem areas and causes and is  
critical for continuous improvement. There are multiple ways of classifying 
costs, each providing a different view of operations and issues. One method 
9
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 9 | World Class Supply Chain Management: Key Takeaways
256
is fixed costing vs. variable costing, which can inform pricing and inventory deci-
sions when demand changes. Another method is to classify costs as shortage-
related or holding-related, based on mismatches between demand and supply. 
This classification elucidates inventory decisions. Yet another method is to 
categorize costs as standard costs vs. exceptional costs, which helps identify 
operational issues and reasons for cost overruns. Examples of exceptional 
costs include use of expedited transportation, overtime labor for produc-
tion and warehousing, customer charges for delayed shipments, and inventory 
write-offs.
Determine the optimal service levels for products sold by the company.  
Depending on the industry, the availability of timely supply has a different level 
of importance. For a company providing highly engineered products to a cus-
tomer, the importance of lead time is secondary to meeting the specifications 
and quality requirements of the order. On the other hand, for most industries 
providing commodities or off-the-shelf products, the ability to have sufficient 
inventory and fulfill the customer’s orders instantly or within a few hours or 
days may be the most important factor in determining business success. This 
measurement related to timely fulfillment is referred to as the service level or 
in-stock. For industries driven by high service levels, it is necessary to maintain 
the right level of inventory balancing the cost of inventory against lost sales.
Incorporate financial measurements to ensure that operating assets 
are effectively used. The most important financial gauge of a supply chain is 
the return on operating assets. Although most companies track such a mea-
sure, it is often confined to a local level, for a particular manufacturing plant 
or a distribution center. Calculating these measures at the supply chain level 
across these silos can provide valuable insights and enable improvements.
Limit reliance on broad-brush settings for policies and parameters. 
To simplify the task of managing demand and supplies, companies often rely 
on identical policies and procedures for all products or a large set of products 
(for example, service levels and forecasting methods). If such a specification 
includes products and materials that have widely different costs and demand 
characteristics, higher costs can result. Ideally, supply chain processes should 
tailor policies for a specific situation and even for a particular item.
Increase the level of collaboration with supply chain partners. The 
increased reliance on contract manufacturers and third-party logistics provid-
ers comes with a drawback: the lack of visibility into partner operations. Any 
resulting imbalances between demand and supply can leave the company deal-
ing with negative repercussions for weeks or months. These imbalances may 
manifest as inadequate (or excessive) raw material inventories, shortage (or 
excess) of manufacturing capacity, or unavailability of timely transportation 
resources. Therefore, companies need to collaborate, identify, and resolve 
situations that can lead to imbalance and erode margins.

257
The Profitable Supply Chain
Ensure all stakeholders are involved in strategic supply chain 
­processes. Strategic processes such as inventory, supply, and network plan-
ning result in supply chain parameters and configurations that have a significant 
impact on the performance of the supply chain—not just on manufacturing 
but also on procurement, distribution, marketing, and finance. Therefore, it is 
important to involve all stakeholders and ensure adequate representation and 
participation in the planning process.
Anticipate trends that can significantly impact demand. The uncer-
tainty in demand caused by day-to-day variances is unavoidable and can be dealt 
with using safety stock and frequent inventory reviews. However, trends that 
impact demand significantly (whether positively or negatively) for a sustained 
duration are harder to manage and may result in higher costs. Therefore, it is 
important to understand how different economic, environmental, and competi-
tive factors impact demand, to monitor these trends, and to anticipate shifts.
Utilize scarce resources judiciously. The injudicious use of scarce inven-
tory or capacity can result in costly mistakes, such as increasing inventory 
for products that are not moving while simultaneously shorting demand for 
fast-movers, or fulfilling demand for a low-margin product at the expense of 
higher-margin products. Although prudent use of resources is easy to under-
stand, few companies have a rigorous process for ensuring that this is indeed 
happening. Implementing an allocation process for identifying scarcity situa-
tions and specifying a method to ensure judicious use can improve perfor-
mance significantly.
Design the network to provide a differentiated product offering. 
Supply chain characteristics that provide differentiation vary by industry and 
product. For example, cost may be the primary driver for certain low- or 
mid-range consumer electronic products provided the different brands are 
perceived to have roughly equivalent features and quality. For products being 
sold to other manufacturers as raw material, cost and flexibility may be equally 
important owing to the need to increase or decrease supplies as demand 
changes. Similarly, responsiveness may be the primary differentiation for critical 
service parts, such as replacement parts for refrigeration systems or aircraft. 
Providing these capabilities effectively requires a rigorous approach to loca-
tion of facilities, routing of material, staging of inventory, and postponement of 
manufacturing activities.
Monitor supply chain performance regularly, and ensure that 
parameters can be changed quickly. Left unattended, many inventory 
policies, demand management methods, and network configurations will dete-
riorate over time and cease to provide the anticipated benefits. This degra-
dation is mainly due to changing material and labor costs, changing product 
prices, incorporation of new suppliers and products, and new demand trends. 
Therefore, it is necessary to define metrics that help gauge the effectiveness 

Chapter 9 | World Class Supply Chain Management: Key Takeaways
258
of the supply chain and preemptively institute procedures to change policies, 
parameters, and configurations in the event that performance deteriorates.
Constantly evaluate and incorporate innovations that can transform 
the supply chain. Understanding how new trends and innovations can trans-
form the supply chain is a challenging undertaking because it requires rethinking 
entrenched procedures. Insufficient leverage via innovation can result in loss 
of market share to more up-to-date competitors—or even to obsolescence 
and business failure if the innovation is disruptive. Therefore, it is imperative 
for planning personnel to be vigilant in monitoring trends in all pertinent 
areas, including manufacturing, logistics, and information technology.

Managerial Cost 
Accounting
Supply chain analysis requires the use of cost concepts for calculating met-
rics and making decisions. Managerial accounting is the process of identifying 
and interpreting cost information for the pursuit of an organization’s goals. 
The difference between managerial and financial accounting is that the for-
mer is aimed at helping managers in the organization make decisions, while 
the latter is aimed at providing information to parties outside the organiza-
tion. As a result, there is more latitude in the principles and methods used 
in managerial accounting.
Accounting recognizes expenses as product costs or period costs. A product 
cost (also referred to inventoriable cost) is an expense assigned to goods that 
were either purchased or manufactured for resale. Product cost is used to 
value the inventory of manufactured goods until the goods are sold. In the 
period of sale, product costs are recognized as an expense called cost of goods 
sold (COGS). The product cost of goods acquired by a retailer or wholesaler 
for resale consists of the purchase cost of inventory plus any shipping charges. 
For manufactured products, product cost includes labor cost for production 
and the costs of raw material.
All costs that are not product costs are called period costs. Period costs are 
identified with the period of time in which they are incurred rather than when 
goods are purchased or produced.
These concepts can be applied to each of the stages in the supply chain—
manufacturing, storage, and transportation. Because manufacturing operations 
tend to be complex, additional considerations are required for the treatment 
of overhead, as discussed in the next section.

Appendix A | Managerial Cost Accounting

Manufacturing Costs
The raw material and human labor required to produce a product are easily 
accounted for and are referred to as direct material costs and direct labor costs, 
respectively. For example, direct material refers to the printed circuit boards 
and lenses used to manufacture a digital camera, and direct labor refers to the 
production worker responsible for assembling the camera.
However, the complexity of most manufacturing operations results in signifi-
cant fixed expenses, termed manufacturing overhead. One category of over-
head cost is indirect material, which represents the cost of materials that are 
required for the production process but do not become an integral part of 
the finished good. Examples include drill bits and saw blades used in manufac-
turing equipment. Another category is termed indirect labor, which is the cost 
of personnel who do not work directly on the product but whose services 
are necessary for the manufacturing process. Examples include department 
supervisors and security guards. Finally, other costs include property taxes, 
insurance, and utilities.
The overhead is treated differently by two accounting methods—absorption 
costing and variable costing. Absorption costing includes both variable and fixed 
manufacturing overhead in product cost, in the form of work-in-process or 
finished goods inventory (Figure A-1).
Figure A-1. The absorption costing method

The Profitable Supply Chain
261
Variable costing treats manufacturing overhead differently, with these costs 
being expensed in the period that they are incurred. An example of variable 
costing is shown in Figure A-2. The margin obtained by subtracting variable 
costs from revenue is referred to as the contribution margin. Due to this differ-
ence in accounting for overhead, variable costing will result in a lower value of 
work-in-process and finished goods inventory and higher fixed costs. When 
inventory is consumed in the same period, both costing methods result in the 
same value of income; however, when inventory is manufactured and held for 
several periods, the income from the two methods differ.
Figure A-2. The variable costing method
Variable costing enables cost-volume-profit analysis, which is a useful method 
providing insight into the demand volumes required for profitability, as well 
as pricing levels required to achieve a certain level of profits. The number of 
units required to break even can be calculated by Equation A-1:
	
Breakevenvolume

(A-1)
Which of these two methods should be used for analyzing the supply chain? 
Several companies use absorption costing for cost-based pricing in order to 
ensure that true costs (inclusive of overhead) are covered. On the other hand, 
variable costing proponents argue that it is the better alternative for pricing 
because any price over the product’s variable cost contributes to covering 
fixed cost and a profit, and is therefore beneficial.

Appendix A | Managerial Cost Accounting
262
The trend toward outsourced manufacturing has resulted in a reduction in 
fixed costs and manufacturing overhead and higher variable costs; therefore, 
most outsourced situations lend themselves to variable costing. But even 
outsourced situations can have several operational complexities that require 
special attention. For example, if a supplier makes capacity investments for 
the manufacturer in order to accommodate the production of custom parts 
or to provide dedicated capacity, these tooling costs are eventually charged 
back to the manufacturer. If the cost is to be recovered by the unit price 
charged by the supplier, the item cost needs to be increased by a factor equal 
to the investment divided by the projected lifetime volume of the product. In 
essence, this approach absorbs tooling costs in the variable cost, so it utilizes 
a hybrid costing model.
 Storage Costs
For a company that owns distribution centers, storage costs can include:
Labor for receiving and inventorying material.
• 
Wages for management and procurement.
• 
Building expenses, including rent, utilities, and building 
• 
maintenance.
The act of holding inventory results in additional costs, termed carrying costs. 
These include:
Insurance for on-hand inventory
• 
Forgone interest on working capital tied up in inventory 
• 
(i.e., the cost of money)
Deterioration, theft, spoilage, or obsolescence. This is 
• 
especially important for products that age, groceries and 
lumber).
Price erosion, especially for electronic components
• 
When making trade-off decisions related to holding inventory, two approaches 
are possible. The first is to consider the total cost, consisting of storage and 
carrying, while the second is to consider only the variable costs for storage 
and carrying. These variable costs provide an accurate picture of the actual 
expenditure due to inventory, since storage costs are fixed and will not be 
affected by an increase or decrease in inventory level.

The Profitable Supply Chain
263
The use of third-party logistics providers (3PL) has become widespread and 
changed the cost structure. The reasons for the use of 3PL facilities include 
augmenting storage capacity, gaining geographic presence, or completely 
outsourcing the storage function. From a cost perspective, third-party logis-
tics has the effect of converting fixed costs into variable costs. In this case, the 
cost of storage can be specified on a per-unit basis to include the following:
Handling cost (receiving and inventorying), expressed in 
• 
appropriate units (for example, per container, per pallet, 
per pound, or per unit). Depending on the unit-of-measure 
used, an equivalent per-unit cost can be obtained.
Insurance cost, usually expressed as a percentage of the 
• 
cost of inventory at the end of each month.
Carrying cost (to cover insurance and utilization of 
• 
space), expressed as a percentage of the cost of inven-
tory at the end of each month. Often, a management cost 
(for order processing, inventory management, and other 
management activities) is included.
Other costs specific to the particular situation, including light 
• 
assembly, processing of returns, and first level repairs.
For products with stable prices, the holding cost is the same as the storage 
cost. However, several electronic or commodity products can display large 
fluctuations in prices; for products that display a decreasing trend, the holding 
cost is higher than the storage cost. For commodity prices that can fluctu-
ate in either direction, the analysis is more involved and needs to consider 
options in pricing and trading.
Transportation Costs
The costs for transportation of goods depend on the mode of transporta-
tion used: ocean, rail, air, or truck. Ocean freight usually occurs in containers, 
with sizes ranging from 20' to 45' in length, approximately 8' width, and 8.5' in 
height. Variations of these dimensions are possible. In addition to the volume, 
each of these configurations has a weight restriction. The costs for ocean 
freight include:
Cost per container, from the source to destination port.
• 
Transportation from the factory/supplier to the source 
• 
port.
Inspection and customs clearance cost, if necessary (for 
• 
imports).

Appendix A | Managerial Cost Accounting
264
Drayage costs, which is the cost to transport the goods 
• 
from the port to the distribution center. This is usually by 
truck, expressed as a cost per container.
Unloading costs at the distribution center.
• 
An important consideration is the selection of the port at which shipments 
will be received. The selection of a port that is inappropriate for the cargo 
being transported can result in additional time and cost. Some of the factors 
to be considered while selecting a port are:
Support for large shipments and availability of equipment 
• 
for specific handling needs.
The number of shipments and carriers that service the 
• 
specific origin and destination of interest to the shipper.
Visibility provided regarding status of shipments, and 
• 
assistance provided in handling claims.
Cost of handling freight and pickup and delivery 
• 
windows.
Proximity to the company’s distribution centers.
• 
Air freight costs can vary depending on the weight of the shipment, with a 
decrease in cost as the weight of the shipment increases. The total cost of air 
freight can include the following:
Cost per unit or per pallet, from the source to destina-
• 
tion airport.
Transportation from the factory/supplier to the source 
• 
airport.
Inspection and customs clearance cost, if necessary (for 
• 
imports).
Airport transfer cost, which is the cost to transport the 
• 
goods from the airport to the distribution center.
As with ocean freight, rail cars come in a variety of sizes and weight limits. 
Costs for rail freight include:
Cost of rail car, from the source to destination city. The 
• 
number of units transported can be calculated based on 
the dimensional or weight restriction. This is used to 
convert the cost per rail car into a per-unit cost.
Transportation (drayage) cost from the supplier’s facility 
• 
to the rail car.

The Profitable Supply Chain
265
Transloading cost, which is the cost to transfer goods 
• 
from truck to rail (at the source), or from rail to truck 
(at the destination).
Finally, truck costs can vary significantly depending on whether the trucks are 
owned or a third party is used. If trucks are owned, the costs include:
Fixed costs for housing vehicles and equipment, mainte-
• 
nance, depreciation, and wages for management.
Variable costs include fuel for transportation and direct 
• 
labor expenses for contracted drivers.
On the other hand, if a 3PL is used, costs are expressed on a per-mile basis 
from a source to destination, for full truckload (TL or FTL) or less-than-
truckload (LTL). These per mile costs are converted into per-unit costs for 
each routing, based on the number of units transported by TL or LTL.
Intermodal transportation refers to the use of more than one mode of trans-
port to move a shipment to its destination. It is common for trucks to be 
used with rail, ocean, and air freight in order to transfer goods from ports to 
the warehouse. In addition, global transportation of goods has resulted in an 
increase in the use of rail, ocean, and truck combinations in order to achieve 
the lowest cost per unit.
With increase in overseas manufacturing, companies with little international 
experience rely on freight forwarders for ensuring adherence to regulations. 
Some of the functions provided by freight forwarders include:
Providing quotes for ocean and air freight.
• 
Booking vessel space according to the provided 
• 
schedules.
Creating documentation for importing and exporting, 
• 
and cargo insurance.
Making payments to the appropriate freight companies 
• 
on completion of transportation.
Providing information related to the status of shipments 
• 
and, if necessary, expediting shipments that are held up.
Coordinating ground transportation and warehousing, if 
• 
necessary.
Freight forwarding costs are borne by the shipper and the carriers. Shipper 
charges are related to the preparation of documents, while carrier charges 
are usually a percent of revenue generated by the shipment.

Inventory 
Margin Analysis
Commonly used methods for determining inventory levels include  
the economic order quantity (EOQ) model, the service level method,  
and the newsvendor model, discussed in Chapter 2. Each of these methods has  
the following specific disadvantages:
The 
• 
EOQ model ignores demand and supply variability 
and calculates supply requirements in order to minimize 
holding and ordering (a.k.a. setup) costs. Therefore, this 
method is applicable to situations in which variability 
is not present—such as optimizing a fixed production 
schedule by trading off inventory levels against setup costs 
based on production quantities and product mix—but  
it does not provide adequate guidance when variability is 
present.
The 
• 
service level method calculates inventory levels 
required to achieve a target service level based on a 
measured variability in demand and supply. This method 
requires the assumption of a particular probability distri-
bution (the normal distribution is frequently used), and 
the calculation can be performed using a spreadsheet. 
The advantage of this method is its simplicity and the 
ability to connect inventory to two drivers—demand 
uncertainty and supply variability. However, a drawback 
of this method is the lack of consideration of costs. The 
fundamental question whether a certain level of inven-
tory is economically viable is not addressed.

Appendix B | Inventory Margin Analysis
268
The 
• 
newsvendor model is a more sophisticated method 
that is able to answer the cost question because it con-
nects inventory levels to demand uncertainty and costs. 
As with the service level method, this method is simple 
and calculations can be performed using a spreadsheet 
under the assumption of a certain probability distribu-
tion. However, the formulation is for a single period only 
and provides no guidance when demand, price, and costs 
change across time. Time-varying considerations are criti-
cal in many situations, such as grocery products that have 
a shelf life of a few weeks and electronic products that 
undergo significant price erosion.
The incremental margin model, also introduced in Chapter 2, addresses these 
drawbacks. The need to consider costs over multiple periods results in a for-
mulation that is more complex than the service level or newsvendor mod-
els, but the additional complexity can be worth the benefit, especially when 
applied to products that have high storage and holding costs. A brief deriva-
tion of the model is given below.1
If the expected demand for the first period is d1 and the forecast error 
is s1, stocking s units of supply yields the following value for lost sales in the 
first period:

where x represents the random demand variable. It is possible to simplify

that is directly related to demand characteristics—namely, the expected 
demand and variability.

These single-period estimates need to be modified for multiple periods. The 
first estimate is the expected leftover inventory at the end of the second 
period, based on combining the demand probability distributions of the first 
and second periods, as follows:

Equation B-6 assumes that demand across the two periods is independent. 
This is a reasonable assumption in many but not all situations. For example, if 
demand has decreased because the competition launched a better product, 
the uncertainties are likely to be biased for consecutive periods. However, 
many such situations can be effectively addressed by revisiting the demand 
forecast and generating new values based on such changes.
The combined probability distribution is calculated according to the following 
relationships:

The expected margin from s units of supply is calculated subtracting shortage 
costs, holding costs, and scrap costs from the margin based on standard price 
and cost. The shortage cost is simply the cost of lost sales in the first period. 
The holding cost is the sum of the cost of holding inventory that is leftover 
at the end of the first and subsequent periods. Therefore, the expected unit 
margin can be written as follows:

Acknowledgments
I would like to thank my colleagues with whom I have shared my supply chain 
journey over the years. I have benefited immensely from the discussions and 
projects that we have undertaken together. 
I would also like to thank Jeff Olson, Rita Fernando, technical reviewer Sarah 
Stowell, and the rest of the editorial staff at Apress. Their support, patience, 
and rigor have helped create an end product that I am proud of.
My heartfelt gratitude to my parents and my brother for their emphasis and 
support of education and contemplation. And my warmest thanks to my wife, 
Viji, and my daughters, Shreya and Sahana, without whose encouragement 
and support this book would not have been possible.
