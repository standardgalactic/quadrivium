Preface
The content of this book is the result of the authors’ 20 years worth of research 
in the domain of complex and hypercomplex multidimensional signals. The 
starting point was the theory of multidimensional analytic signals with sin-
gle-orthant spectra defined in 1992 by Stefan L. Hahn in the Proceedings of 
IEEE. Four years later, Artech House published Hilbert Transforms in Signal 
Processing. The theory and applications of the hypercomplex analytic signals 
have been presented in the dissertation of D.Sc. Kajetana M. Snopek, Studies 
of Complex and Hypercomplex Multidimensional Analytic Signals.
During their research, the authors often put forth the following questions:
Complex or hypercomplex? Which approach is better? Are they both 
equivalent?
This book is an attempt to answer these questions. The reader will find 
lengthy descriptions of the theory of multidimensional complex and hyper-
complex signals illustrated with numerous examples and followed by practical 
applications. Of course, some problems are still open and can serve as inspi-
ration for postgraduate or doctoral students in their research. For example, 
the field of octonion signals is still only being superficially explored, and the 
problem of their polar form has not yet been solved.
The majority of the figures presented in this book were created in a 
MATLAB™ environment and are the result of programming in C++. The 
authors have made every possible effort to avoid errors in presented formulas

and derivations. However, if errors should occur, the authors appreciate any 
remarks from their readers and are open to any discussions.
The authors express their deep gratitude to all those who have contrib-
uted to this book and supported it, especially to the reviewer, Dr. Stephen 
Sanguine, for his suggestions and remarks, which significantly improved the 
quality of this work. To a large extent, the problems presented in this book 
are result of many years of research done by the authors at the Institute of 
Radioelectronics and Multimedia Technology of the Warsaw University of 
Technology (originally known as the Politechnika Warszawska). The authors 
would like to thank the director of the Institute, Professor Józef Modelski, 
and the scientific deputy director, Professor Wiesław Winiecki, for their sup-
port and encouragement at different stages of the research. This book was 
initiated by a letter from William M. Bazzy from Artech House to Professor 
Hahn with suggestions to present new results.

Introduction and Historical 
Background
1.1  Introduction
There are two domains in theoretical descriptions of n-dimensional (n-D) sig-
nals: the signal domain (in 1-D usually the time domain) and the frequency 
domain. In the signal domain, signals are functions of the Cartesian coordi-
nates x = (x1, x2, …, xn). Note that the signal u is assumed to be a real-valued 
(not complex-valued) function of x. On the other hand, analytic signals are 
complex or hypercomplex functions of x. The name analytic is used because 
analytic signals are boundary distributions of complex analytic functions of an 
n-D complex variable z = (z1, z2, …, zn), where zk = xk + jyk. (for 1-D time signals: 
z = t + jτ). Details defining the boundary distribution are given in Chapter 
5. The second domain of analysis of n-D signals is the frequency domain f = 
( f1, f2, …, fn). For a given real signal u(x), we can define a pair of functions:
	
u(x)⇔
n−F
U( f )	
(1.1)
where U(f ) is called the n-D Fourier spectrum (notation n-F) of u(x). In gen-
eral, U(f ) is a complex (or hypercomplex) function of frequency f.

2	
Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
As will be described in Chapter 3, the real signal u(x) may be expressed 
as a sum of 2n terms with even and/or odd parity. The 1-D signal may be a 
union of two 1-D terms:
	
u(t) = ue + uo 	
(1.2)
The 2-D real signal is a union of four terms:
	
u x1,x2
(
) = uee + uoe + ueo + uoo 	
(1.3)
and the 3-D real signal may be a sum of eight 3D terms:
	
u x1,x2,x3
(
) = ueee + uoee + ueoe + uooe + ueeo + uoeo + ueoo + uooo 	
(1.4)
where the subscripts are written using the reverse notation of binary numbers: 
e (even) = binary “0” and o (odd) = binary “1.” Examples of the reverse nota-
tion: eee = 000, oee = 001,,,,,.
In Chapter 4, we will present the theory of complex and hypercomplex 
Fourier transforms. For 1-D signals, we have only a complex Fourier transform 
(real for even functions). In 2-D, we have a choice between complex or hyper-
complex (quaternion) Fourier transforms. For 3-D signals, we have a choice 
between the complex and more than one hypercomplex Fourier transforms. 
They differ by the applied algebra of the imaginary units (see Chapter 4). The 
corresponding complex and hypercomplex analytic signals are described in 
Chapter 5.
In 1-D, the complex Fourier spectrum has the form:
U( f ) =
u(t)e−j2pft dt
−∞
∞
∫
=
ue(t)cos(2pft)dt
−∞
∞
∫
−j
uo(t)sin(2pft)dt
−∞
∞
∫
= Ue( f ) −jUo( f )
	(1.5)
We observe that, in general, the spectrum of a real signal is a complex-
valued function. However for even signals, it is a real function.
As mentioned previously, the complex and hypercomplex spectra of 2-D 
signals differ. The complex spectrum of a 2-D real signal is calculated as the 
2-D complex Fourier transform (see Chapter 4),
	
U
f1, f2
(
) = Uee −Uoo – j Uoe +Ueo
(
) 	
(1.6)

	
Introduction and Historical Background

is a real-valued function, if the terms indexed oe and eo equal zero. The hyper-
complex 2-D Fourier transform will be described in Chapter 4. In this book, 
we refer to it as the Quaternion Fourier Transform (QFT) given by
	
Uq f1, f2
(
) = Uee −Uoe ⋅e1 −Ueo ⋅e2 +Uoo ⋅e3 	
(1.7)
It is a real function, only if u(x1, x2) is an even-even function. The 3-D 
complex Fourier spectrum is
U
f1, f2, f3
(
) = Ueee −Uooe −Uoeo −Ueoo −j Uoee +Ueoe +Ueeo −Uooo
(
) 	 (1.8)
while the corresponding spectrum defined by the 3-D hypercomplex Fourier 
transform (Octonion Fourier Transform (OFT)) applying the Cayley-Dickson 
algebra is
	
UCD f1, f2, f3
(
)
= Ueee −Uoee ⋅e1 −Ueoe ⋅e2 +Uooe ⋅e3 −Ueeo ⋅e4 +Uoeo ⋅e5 +Ueoo ⋅e6 −Uooo ⋅e7  

(1.9)
Therefore, the spectrum of a real signal u may be a complex/hypercom-
plex function. The corresponding analytic signal with single-orthant spectrum 
is always a complex (hypercomplex) function. The analytic signal can be cal-
culated directly in the signal domain x or in the frequency domain f by the 
inverse Fourier transform of a single-orthant spectrum. Both methods yield 
exactly the same complex (hypercomplex) signal.
1.1.1  The Signal Domain Method
The n-D analytic signal with a single-orthant spectrum is defined by the 
n-fold convolution with the n-D complex (hypercomplex) delta distribution. 
The general formula is

Cayley-Dickson algebra (see Chapter 2). In the complex case all ei = j.

1.1.2  The Frequency Domain Method
The n-D analytic signal with a single-orthant spectrum is defined by the inverse 
Fourier transform of the spectrum U(f ) multiplied by the single-orthant 
operator in the form of a product of the frequency domain unit step func-
tions (distributions). For the first orthant with all positive unit steps, we have
	
Single orthant operator = 2n × 1 f1
( ) × 1 f2
(
) ×…× 1 fn
(
) 	
(1.11)
The methods presented in (1.10) and (1.11) yield exactly the same ana-
lytic signals for a given algebra. In 1-D, we get the Gabor’s analytic signal 
given by (1.17), whereas in 2-D, the complex analytic signal with the first 
quadrant spectrum is
	
y1 x1,x2
(
) = u −v + j v1 + v2
(
) 	
(1.12)
where v is the total Hilbert transform and v1 and v2 are the partial Hilbert 
transforms. The 2-D hypercomplex analytic signal with the spectrum in the 
first quadrant of the frequency plane has the form of a quaternion
	
yq
1 x1,x2
(
) = u + v1 ⋅e1 + v2 ⋅e2 + v ⋅e3 	
(1.13)
1.2  A Historical Survey
A large part of this survey was been presented in 2007 by Stefan Hahn at 
a historical session of the EUROCON conference [1]. The imaginary unit j 
= e1 = −1  was introduced in the sixteenth century to solve some problems 
concerning cubic equations. Three centuries later, in Introductio in Analysim 
Infinitorum (1748), Leonard Euler (1707–1783) derived his famous formula:
	
exp( jx) = cosx + jsinx 	
(1.14)
Then, the English mathematician, William Rowan Hamilton (1805–
1865), expanded the notion of complex numbers and complex functions defin-
ing so-called quaternions [2] in a general form
	
q = a⋅1+ b ⋅i + c ⋅j + d ⋅k 	
(1.15)
The complete work about quaternions appeared in 1853 under the title 
Lectures on Quaternions [3]. in 1843, John T. Graves (1806–1870)—a close

friend of W. R. Hamilton—discovered the eighth-order algebra of hypercom-
plex numbers, which were called octonions. However, the discovery of octonions 
is ascribed to Arthur Cayley (1821–1895), who in his 1845 paper On Jacobi’s 
elliptic functions, in reply to the Rev. B. Bronwin: and on quaternions, described 
the algebra of octonions; three years later, he presented their interpretation in 
terms of matrices. It is after Arthur Cayley and the famous American math-
ematician, Leonard Eugene Dickson (1874–1954), that the Cayley-Dickson 
construction of hypercomplex numbers was named.
The next step was the 1870 publication of Linear Associative Algebras 
by Benjamin Peirce (1809–1890); this was one of the first systematic studies 
on hypercomplex numbers. The nineteenth century was a period of other 
significant discoveries in the field of hypercomplex algebras. In 1873, Wil-
liam Kingdon Clifford (1845–1879) generalized the Hamilton’s quaterni-
ons into biquaternions, and in 1886, Rudolf O.S. Lipschitz (1832–1903) 
rediscovered the Clifford algebras and proposed to apply them to study 
rotation in Euclidean spaces. Some of these algebras will be described in 
detail in Chapter 2.
In the signal theory, the spectra are always expressed in terms of the 
Fourier transforms. The real notation of the Fourier transform has been intro-
duced by the French mathematician Jean Baptiste de Fourier (1768–1830) in 
the form of cosine and sine functions. Today, the Fourier transform is usu-
ally written using the complex notation. This notation was first introduced to 
electrical engineering by the American engineer Charles Proteus Steinmetz 
(1865–1923). He used the following notation of the Euler’s formula (1.14):
	
exp( jwt) = cos(wt) + jsin(wt)	
(1.16)
This notation was later adapted to the complex Fourier transformation. 
The representation (1.16) can be classified as the first analytic signal. Hungar-
ian physicist and winner of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1971, Dennis Gabor 
(1900–1979), generalized this notion defining the 1-D analytic signal [4] as
	
y(t) = u(t) + jv(t) 	
(1.17)
where u(t) and v(t) form a pair of Hilbert transforms (invented by the Ger-
man mathematician David Hilbert (1862–1943)). The polar notation of the 
Gabor’s analytic signal (1.17),
	
y(t) = A(t)exp jj(t)
(
) 	
(1.18)

Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
uniquely defines the instantaneous amplitude and instantaneous frequency 
(derivative of the phase) of u [5]. Using (1.18), Hahn defined the notion of 
instantaneous complex frequency [6]. The Gabor’s analytic signal has found 
numerous applications—especially in modulation theory (single-sideband 
modulation), time-frequency analysis (Wigner-Ville distribution), and esti-
mation of the instantaneous parameters (amplitude, frequency or phase) of 
a given signal [7, 8]. Of course, the notions of the instantaneous amplitude 
and instantaneous frequency were earlier known to radio engineers develop-
ing AM and FM radio systems [9].
Analytic signals are defined as boundary distributions of analytic func-
tions. A prominent cofounder of the theory of analytic functions is the French 
mathematician Augustus Louis Cauchy (1789–1857). The theory of analytic 
signals also applies the notions of unit step functions and of the delta pulse. 
The unit step function 1(t) has been defined by Oliver Heaviside and the delta 
pulse δ(t) by Paul Dirac. Their theoretical background was later formulated 
by Schwartz [10] and Mikusiński [11] using theory of distributions. Schwartz 
defined distributions using test functions and Mikusiński applied approximat-
ing functions (see Chapter 3).
In [12], Hahn introduced the notion of the complex delta distribution 
used later in signal-domain definitions of n-D analytic signals [13]. In his 
paper, Hahn defined the n-D analytic signals with single-orthant spectra (see 
Chapter 3) as an extension of the 1-D Gabor’s analytic signal to n dimensions. 
Specifically, he introduced notions of the partial Hilbert transforms. The idea 
of the n-D hypercomplex delta distribution was proposed by Hahn to the IEEE 
Transactions on Signal Processing. However, it was rejected by the associate 
editor. Later, this notion was applied in Snopek’s work [14].
The theory of hypercomplex analytic signals has been developing 
quickly in the last twenty years and has found numerous applications in 
different domains. The introduction of the hypercomplex (quaternion) Fou-
rier transformation by Todd A. Ell in 1992 [15] opened new possibilities of 
applications. The quaternion analytic signal defined by Thomas Bülow in 
his 1999 Ph.D. thesis [16] has been used first in the analysis of 2-D seismic 
signal attributes [17]. Further research has resulted in new applications, for 
example, in color image watermarking and filtering [18–20]. The new dis-
crete versions of hypercomplex Fourier transforms have also appeared [21, 
22]. In [23], Sommer and Bülow applied the 2-D quaternionic version of 
analytic signals. In [24], Sommer and Felsberg defined a 2-D monogenic 
hypercomplex signal using the Riesz transforms [25] as opposed to the Hilbert 
transforms. The Riesz transform has been also applied in numerous works 
of Larkin, et al. in [26].

Survey of Chosen Hypercomplex 
Algebras
The goal of this chapter is to give a brief overview of chosen Cayley-Dickson 
and Clifford algebras of hypercomplex numbers. Bearing in mind their prac-
tical applications, we focus on Cayley-Dickson algebras of quaternions and 
octonions and Clifford algebras of biquaternions and bioctonions. We start 
with a discussion of their basic properties and then present some exemplary 
applications in the different fields. We also point out the differences between 
considered algebras. In the final section, we come to general definitions of 
complex and hypercomplex signals based on the previously presented Cayley-
Dickson and Clifford algebras.
2.1  Cayley-Dickson Algebras
The goal of this book is to study the properties of algebras of order 2, 4, and 8. 
Presently, the higher-order Cayley-Dickson algebras seem to be out of interest 
from the point of view of possible applications. The Cayley-Dickson algebras 
are 2N-order algebras over the real number field ℝ, N ∈ ℕ. These are the 
complex numbers, quaternions, octonions, and sedenions; that is, algebras 
defined using the Cayley-Dickson construction described in Section 2.1.1. It 

10	
Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
should be noted that only complex numbers, quaternions, and octonions are 
normed division algebras, meaning that every nonzero element has its inverse. 
This property is very important from the point of view of potential practical 
applications. Let us start with the known complex numbers algebra.
The complex numbers, denoted with ℂ, form the Cayley-Dickson alge-
bra of order 2 over ℝ. In all other chapters of this book, we will denote any 
complex number z ∈ ℂ as z = x + y · j where x, y ∈ ℝ. However, bearing in 
mind the compatible notation used in this chapter, let us write z in the form 
z = r0 + r1 · e1, r0, r1 ∈ ℝ and e1 is the imaginary unit usually denoted by 
mathematicians with i or j, e1 = −1 . The real number r0 is called the real 
part of the complex number z: r0 = Re z, and r1 is its imaginary part: r1 = Im z.
Let us recall some commonly known notions and definitions concerning 
the complex numbers. The reverse of z ∈ ℂ is a complex number −z:
	
−z = −r0 −r1 ⋅e1	
(2.1)
and the conjugate of z ∈ ℂ is a complex number z∗ ∈ ℂ defined as
	
z∗= r0 −r1 ⋅e1	
(2.2)
The norm (modulus) of z ∈ ℂ is a real nonnegative number
	
z = z =
z ⋅z∗=
r0
2 + r1
2 =
Rez
(
)
2 + Imz
(
)
2 	
(2.3)
Remark: Let us note that in this entire book, we express the norm of a com-
plex/hypercomplex number as a square root of a corresponding inner product.
Then, the conjugate divided by the norm or modulus squared defines 
the inverse of z ∈ ℂ as follows
	
z−1 = 1
z =
1
r0 + r1 ⋅e1
= r0 −r1 ⋅e1
r0
2 + r1
2 = z∗
z 2 	
(2.4)
Any complex number z can be written in its polar form
	
z = z ee1arg z = z cos arg z + z sin arg z ⋅e1 	
(2.5)
where arg z is the angle of z. Thus, the real and imaginary parts of z (respec-
tively) are expressed as
	
r0 = z cos arg z,   r1 = z sin arg z 	
(2.6)

	
Survey of Chosen Hypercomplex Algebras
11
Moreover, we see that the sums and differences of the complex number 
with its conjugate yield the real and imaginary parts with suitable scaling:
	
r0 = z + z∗
2
,   r1 = z −z∗
2e1
	
(2.7)
Due to the commutativity of summation and multiplication in ℝ, it 
is evident that these operations in ℂ are also commutative. So, for any two 
complex numbers z0,z1 ∈ ℂ: z0 = r0 + r1 · e1, z1 = r2 + r3 · e1 we have:
	
z0 + z1 = r0 + r2
(
) + r1 + r3
(
)⋅e1 = r2 + r0
(
) + r3 + r1
(
)⋅e1 = z1 + z0 	 (2.8)
	
z0 ⋅z1 = r0 + r1 ⋅e1
(
) r2 + r3 ⋅e1
(
) = r0r2 −r1r3
(
) + r0r3 + r1r2
(
)⋅e1
= r2r0 −r3r1
(
) + r3r0 + r2r1
(
)⋅e1 = z1 ⋅z0
	
(2.9)
Let us now express a complex number z ∈ ℂ: z = r0 + r1 · e1 as an ordered 
pair of two real numbers r0,r1 ∈ ℝ:
	
z = r0,r1
(
) 	
(2.10)
that is, a complex number of order 2 is an ordered pair of two reals (of order 
1). We will later show that the idea of forming an ordered pair of elements of 
lower-order algebra is applied in the Cayley-Dickson process of construction 
of higher-order algebras of hypercomplex numbers.
The operations (2.1)–(2.4), (2.8)–(2.9) defined in ℂ can be generalized for 
quaternions and octonions; this will be shown in Sections 2.1.2 and 2.1.3. In 
Table 2.1, we show chosen operations on elements of Cayley-Dickson algebras 
of complex numbers, quaternions and octonions. Let us notice that (2.8) and 
(2.9) are special cases of general operations of summation and multiplication, 
if we replace (x0, x1) and (x2, x3) with (r0, r1) and (r1, r2) respectively.
2.1.1  The Cayley-Dickson Construction
The method known as the Cayley-Dickson construction [1] is based on the 
following step-by-step procedure. Let us consider two complex numbers 
z0,z1, ∈C: z0 = r0 + r1 · e1, z1 = r2 + r3 · e1, r0,r1,r2,r3, ∈R. Then, we define the 
complex ordered pair (z0,z1) and denote it with q, that is
	
q = z0,z1
(
) =
r0,r1
(
), r2,r3
(
)
(
) 	
(2.11)

12	
Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
where q is called a quaternion, being a quadruple of real numbers r0, r1, r2, r3. 
Of course, the above procedure demands the introduction of the next imagi-
nary unit e2, e2 = −1 , since
	
q = z0 + z1 ⋅e2 = r0 + r1 ⋅e1
(
) + r2 + r3 ⋅e1
(
)⋅e2 	
(2.12)
In this way, we have just defined the fourth-order Cayley-Dickson alge-
bra of quaternions, denoted with ℍ in honor of William Rowan Hamilton 
(1805–1865), their “inventor” [2]. Using one of the Hamiltonian rules of 
multiplication in ℍ, presented in Table 2.2, that is, e1 · e2 = e3, the definition 
(2.12) gets the form
	
q = r0 + r1 ⋅e1 + r2 ⋅e2 + r3 ⋅e3 	
(2.13)
The above formula is the most popular definition of a quaternion hyper-
complex number (sometimes other letters are used to denote imaginary units, 
for example i, j, k instead of e1, e2, e3).
Remark: The Hamiltonian rule e1 · e2 = e3 used in (2.12) is a matter of 
choice. The sign of a product can be positive or negative and this leads to

other rules of multiplication and in consequence, the multiplication tables 
different than Table 2.2.
Example: A red, green, and blue (RGB) image can be represented in the form 
of a pure (reduced) quaternion (with a zero real part): q = R · e1 + G · e2 + B · 
e3, where R, G, B, respectively, are red, green, and blue components of a color 
image. More exactly, if n1, n2 are pixel indices, a color image can be represented 
by a 2-D array whose elements are pure quaternions q(n1, n2).
Following the same procedure as in (2.10) and (2.11), we can define the 
eighth-order Cayley-Dickson algebra of octonions (O), then the sixteenth-order 
algebra of sedenions (S) and so on.
Let us present the algebra of octonions. According to the Cayley-Dickson 
construction, any octonion o ∈ O is a complex ordered pair of quaternions 
q0, q1 ∈ H.
	
o = q0,q1

that is, the quadruple of complex numbers zi, i = 0,1,2,3, z0 = r0 + r1 · e1, z1 
= r2 + r3 · e1, z2 = r4 + r5 · e1, z3 = r6 + r7 · e1 in the form
	
o = q0 + q1 ⋅e4 = z0 + z1 ⋅e2

) + z2 + z3 ⋅e2
(
)⋅e4 	
(2.15)
or, equivalently, the 8-tuple of real numbers ri, i = 0,1,…,7:
	
o = r0 + r1 ⋅e1 + r2 ⋅e2 + r3 ⋅e3
(
) + r4 + r5 ⋅e1 + r6 ⋅e2 + r7 ⋅e3

(2.17)
It should be noted that in (2.16) we introduced the next imaginary 
unit e4, e4 = −1  and in (2.17) we applied new rules of multiplication of ei,i 
= 0,1,…,7 in O presented in Table 2.3: e1 · e4 = e5, e1 · e5 = e6, e1 · e6 = e7. We 
will come back to these rules and study the basic properties of octonions in 
Section 2.1.3.1.
It should be noted that Table 2.3 is only one of many possible multiplica-
tion tables for the octonions. Evidently, its part for imaginary units from the 
set {1,e1,e2,e3} coincides with Table 2.2. The remaining cells are derived bearing 
in mind different properties of multiplication in O described by (2.37)–(2.39).
Of course, the Cayley-Dickson construction can continue to define an 
infinite set of algebras each of twice the dimension of the previous algebra and 
each containing all previous algebras as proper subalgebras. However, their 
properties become worse with each application of the Cayley-Dickson proce-
dure. First, we lose commutativity (quaternions) and associativity (octonions), 
and finally, we lose the division algebra property (sedenions).
Let us explain what this means for successive Cayley-Dickson algebras. 
For any two quaternions, q1,q2 ∈ H, we have q1 · q2 ≠ q2 · q1 (i.e., the mul-
tiplication in H is noncommutative and the same applies for all subsequent 
algebras (O, S, …)). However, the multiplication in H is still associative because

for any three quaternions q1,q2,q3 ∈ H, we have q1 · (q2 · q3) = (q1 · q2) · q3. 
It is no more true in O, where, for any three octonions, o1,o2,o3 ∈ O: o1 · (o2 
· o3) ≠ (o1 · o2) · o3.
We have already pointed out that only complex numbers, quaternions 
and octonions are divison algebras. The sixteenth-order algebra of sedenions 
is not a divison algebra because it contains zero divisors, which means that 
there exist nonzero sedenions s1,s2 ∈ S, such that s1 · s2 = 0, for example (e1 + 
e13)(e2 − e14) = 0. There are many other zero divisors in S [3].
2.1.2  The Cayley-Dickson Algebra of Quaternions
Let us describe in detail the aforementioned Hamiltonian rules of multiplica-
tion in H presented in Table 2.2. They are clearly visualized on the scheme 
from Figure 2.1. The first two units, respectively, are a multiplicand and a 
multiplier, and the third one is their product. If we move clockwise, we get:
	
e1 ⋅e2 = e3,  e2 ⋅e3 = e1,  e3 ⋅e1 = e2 	
(2.18)
However, if we multiply the units counterclockwise, their product 
becomes negative. It means that the multiplication in H is not commutative 
and we have:
	
e2 ⋅e1 = −e3,  e3 ⋅e2 = −e1,  e1 ⋅e3 = −e2 	
(2.19)
2.1.2.1  Chosen Properties of Quaternions

The quaternion −q reversible to q ∈ H: q = (z0,z1) = r0 + r1 · e1 + r2 · e2 + r3 · 
e3, is defined as

Conjugation
The conjugate of a quaternion q ∈ H: q = (z0,z1) = r0 + r1 · e1 + r2 · e2 + r3 · e3 
is also a quaternion
	
q∗= r0 −r1 ⋅e1 −r2 ⋅e2 −r3 ⋅e3 = z0
∗,−z1
(
)	
(2.21)
Proof: For q = (z0,z1) and using (2.11), we have: q∗ = (z0,z1)∗ = (z∗0,−z1) = (r0 − r1 · e1, 
−r2 − r3 · e1) = (r0 − r1 · e1) + (−r2 − r3 · e1)· e2, which is identical to (2.21).
The conjugation is an involution,1 meaning that the double conjugate 
of a quaternion q returns the original: (q∗)∗ = q.
Norm
The norm of a quaternion q ∈ H: q = (z0,z1) = r0 + r1 · e1 + r2 · e2 + r3 · e3 is
	
q =

2 + z1
2 =

q =

The norm (2.22) is always a nonnegative real number expressed as a 
standard Euclidean norm on H. It is called the modulus of a quaternion q and 
is usually denoted with |q|.
The quaternions form a normed division algebra, meaning that the norm 
of the product of quaternions q0 = (z0,z1) and q1 = (z2,z3) equals the product 
of the norms ‖q0‖ and ‖q1‖; that is,
	
q0 ⋅q1 = q0 ⋅q1 	
(2.23)
1 The involution f means a function that is its own inverse (e.g., f(f(x)) = x for every x belonging to 
the domain of f. The involution is linear: f(αx1 + βx2) = αf(x1) + βf(x2); α,β ∈ R and the involution 
of a product is the product of involutions written in the reversed order: f(x1 · x2) = f(x2) · f(x1) [4].

Proof: The evidence of (2.23) is immediate when applying the polar form of 
quaternions q0 and q1 given by (2.30). The reader is encouraged to prove it 
on his or her own.

Summation
The sum of quaternions q0,q1 ∈ H: q0 = a0 + a1 · e1 + a2 · e2 + a3 · e3 and q1 = 
b0 + b1 · e1 + b2 · e2 + b3 · e3 is also a quaternion given by

Proof: This result is evident and can be extended for any number of quaterni-
ons. According to (2.11), if q0 = (z0,z1) and q1 = (z2,z3), then their sum can be 
expressed as a complex ordered pair (z0 + z2,z1 + z3) (see Table 2.1).

= a0b0 −b1a1,a0b1 + b0a1
(

(
)
= a0b2 −b3a1 + b0a2 + a3b1,a0b3 + b2a1 + b0a3 −a2b1
(
)
Because the multiplication and summation in R is commutative, we get (2.26).
We should remember that the multiplication of quaternions is not com-
mutative, (i.e., q0 · q1 ≠ q1 · q0, q0,q1 ∈ H). However, it is still associative. For 
example, for any three quaternions q0,q1,q2 ∈ H we have
	
q0 ⋅q1
(
)⋅q2 = q0 ⋅q1 ⋅q2
(
) 	
(2.28)
The above result is a consequence of the commutativity of multiplica-
tion in C (2.9). We can easily prove (2.28) if we represent each quaternion as 
(2.11) and then use the multiplication property from Table 2.1. We leave this 
proof to a careful reader.

Moreover, it can be shown that the conjugation of the product of two 
quaternions q0,q1 ∈ H is the product of two conjugates written in the reversed 
order:
	
q0 ⋅q1
(
)
∗= q1
∗q0
∗	
(2.29)
This property can be generalized to more than two terms.
Proof: The verification of (2.29) is immediate. We can write the conjugate 
of the product (2.27) of quaternions q0 = (z0,z1) and q1 = (z2,z3) in the form
q0 ⋅q1
(
)
∗= z0z2 −z3

∗z1
(
)
∗= z0
∗z2

Then

(
)
= z2
∗z0
∗−z1
∗z3,−z2
∗z1 −z0z3
(
)
and due to the commutativity of multiplication in C, we finally get (2.29).
2.1.2.2  The Polar Form of a Quaternion
The quaternion q given by (2.13) can equivalently be expressed in its polar 
form—which was introduced and proved by T. Bülow in [5]—that is
	
q = q exp e1f
(
)exp e3y
(
)exp e2q

2.1.3  The Cayley-Dickson Algebra of Octonions
As has already been mentioned in (2.17), an octonion o ∈ O is a hypercom-
plex number defined by eight real numbers ri,i = 0,1,…,7 and seven imagi-
nary units ei,i = 1,…,7 in the form o = r0 + 
ri ⋅ei
i=1

. The multiplication 
of imaginary units in the Cayley-Dickson algebra of octonions can easily be

performed using the Table 2.3 or a diagram called the Fano scheme, shown in 
Figure 2.2. Similarly (as in Figure 2.1), the product of two imaginary units 
gets the “+” sign when we move in the direction of arrows. If the direction is 
opposite, the product is negative; for example: e1 · e4 = e5 and e4 · e7 = e3 while 
e6 · e3 = −e5 or e5 · e2 = −e7.

Proof: Basing on (2.21) and general formula of Table 2.1 we can easily show 
that (2.32) is true.
The conjugation (2.32) is an involution meaning that the double conju-
gate of a octonion o returns the original: (o∗)∗ = o.

o =

and using (2.22) for q0 = (z0,z1) = ((r0,r1),(r2,r3)) and q1 = (z2,z3) = ((r4,r5),(r6,r7)), 
we get (2.33).
The norm (2.32) is a nonnegative real number expressed as a standard 
Euclidean norm on O. It is called the modulus of an octonion o denoted usu-
ally with |o|. It is shown that the norm of the product of octonions o0 = (q0,q1) 
and o1 = (q2,q3) equals the product of norms ‖o0‖ and ‖o1‖; for example,
	
o0 ⋅o1 = o0 ⋅o1 	
(2.34)
Proof: The norm of the product of o0 and o1 is
o0 ⋅o1 =

using (2.25), we come directly to (2.36). Of course, this property can be 
extended for any number of octonions.

(2.37)
is also an octonion. Since multiplication in H is not commutative, it is no more 
commutative in O: o0 · o1 ≠ o1 · o0.
Let us now study the subsequent properties of multiplication in the 
algebra of octonions. Looking at Table 2.3, we notice that, for any triple 
(i,j,k) ∈ {(1,2,3),(1,4,5),(1,7,6),(2,4,6), (2,5,7),(3,4,7),(3,6,5)}, we have: ei · (ej · 
ek) = (ei · ej) · ek (associativity). However if (i,j,k) ∉ {(1,2,3),(1,4,5),(1,7,6),(2,4,
6), (2,5,7),(3,4,7),(3,6,5)}, we have ei · (ej · ek) = −(ei · ej) · ek (nonassociativity).
Example: We can notice that e2 · (e4 · e7) = e2 · e3 = e1 = −(e2 · e4) · e7 = −e6 · e7 
while e3 · (e6 · e5) = e3 · e3 = −1 = (e3 · e6) · e5.
In general, we say that multiplication in O is not associative; such asso-
ciativity is known as biassociativity [6]. However, multiplication in O is alter-
native, that is, for any two elements o0,o1 ∈ O:
	
o0 ⋅o0 ⋅o1
(
) = o0 ⋅o0
(
)⋅o1,   o0 ⋅o1
(
)⋅o1 = o0 ⋅o1 ⋅o1
(
) 	
(2.38)
In particular, for imaginary units ei,i = 0,…,7 from Table 2.2, we have
	
ei ⋅ei ⋅e j
(
) = ei ⋅ei
(
)⋅e j = −e j,  
ei ⋅e j
(
)⋅e j = ei ⋅e j ⋅e j
(
) = −ei.
	
(2.39)
Example: We have e2 · (e2 · e5) = e2 · e7 = −e5 = (e2 · e2) · e5 and (e2 · e5) · e5 = 
e7 · e5 = −e2 = e2 · (e5 · e5)
2.2  Selected Clifford Algebras
In this section, we will describe basic definitions and properties of Clifford 
algebras of biquaternions and bioctonions. Clifford algebras are named after 

24	
Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
William Kingdon Clifford, the nineteenth century English mathematician and 
physicist, who, in 1873, defined the algebra of biquaternions [7] called Clifford 
biquaternions. It should be noted that this algebra differs from the algebra of 
complexified quaternions (original name: biquaternions) defined by Hamilton 
in [8] as quaternions with complex coefficients; for example, hypercomplex 
numbers of the form: z0 + z1 · e1 + z2 · e2 + z3 · e3 where zi ∈ C. The detailed 
description of the properties of Clifford algebras is found in [9, 10].
The basis of any Clifford algebra of order 2n comprises both single imagi-
nary units 1,e1,e2,… and their products:
	
ei1ei2…eik :1 ≤i1 ≤… ≤ik ≤n, 0 ≤k ≤n
{
} 	
(2.40)
It is possible to define Clifford algebras satisfying e2
i = 1 or e2
i = −1. Let us 
denote with p (the number of elements of the basis satisfying e2
i = 1) and with 
q (the number of elements with e2
i = −1 and p + q = n). Any Clifford algebra is 
usually denoted with Clp,q(R). Therefore, the exemplary Clifford algebras are:
• Cl0,1(R)—the second-order algebra of complex numbers (Cl0,1(R) ≡ C)
• Cl1,0(R)—the second-order algebra of double numbers
• Cl0,2(R)—the fourth-order algebra of quaternions (Cl0,2(R) ≡ H)
• Cl1,1(R)—the fourth-order algebra of coquaternions
• Cl0,3(R)—the eighth-order algebra of Clifford biquaternions
• Cl0,4(R)—the sixteenth-order algebra of Clifford bioctonions, etc.
Let us mention that octonions described in Section 2.1.3 are not of the 
Clifford algebra because their basis {1,e1,…,e7} does not contain products of 
imaginary units (2.40).
Let us describe general properties of Clifford algebras. It should be noted 
that they are noncommutative:
	
ei ⋅e j = −e j ⋅ei  for i ≠j 	
(2.41)
but are associative
	
ei ⋅e j ⋅ek
(
) = ei ⋅e j
(
)⋅ek 	
(2.42)
2.2.1  The Clifford Algebra of Biquaternions
Basic properties of Clifford biquaternions are described in detail in [10]. The 
basis of algebra of Clifford biquaternions Cl0,3(R) is:

	
Survey of Chosen Hypercomplex Algebras
25
	
1,e1,e2,e1e2,e3,e1e3,e2e3,e1e2e3 = wq
{
}	
(2.43)
In the following sections, we will use the simplified notation: eiej = eij 
for i ≠ j, i < j < 3 and e1e2e3 = e123 = ω q called the pseudoscalar. It differs from 
other basis elements with the sign of its square, since e2
123 = ω 2
q = +1. Other 
basis elements (2.43) satisfy:
	
ei
2 = −1  for  i = 1,2,3
eij
2 = −1  for  i, j = 1,2,3 and i < j
	
(2.44)
Using the basis (2.43), we define a Clifford biquaternion qCl ∈ Cl0,3(R) 
in a general form:
qCl = r0 + r1 ⋅e1 + r2 ⋅e2 + r3 ⋅e12 + r4 ⋅e3 + r5 ⋅e13 + r6 ⋅e23 + r7 ⋅wq 	
(2.45)
where all ri ∈ R, i = 0,1,…,7. Its conjugate is
qCl
∗= r0 −r1 ⋅e1 −r2 ⋅e2 −r3 ⋅e12 −r4 ⋅e3 −r5 ⋅e13 −r6 ⋅e23 −r7 ⋅wq 	
(2.46)
and the norm is given by
	
qCl =
qCl ⋅qCl
∗=
r0
2 + r1
2 + r2
2 + r3
2 + r4
2 + r5
2 + r6
2 −r7
2 	
(2.47)
Please note the minus sign appearing in (2.47) as a consequence of 
ω 2
q = +1. It means that the norm of a Clifford biquaternion is not the stan-
dard Euclidean norm expressed as a square root of a sum of squares of vector 
elements. That is why we use the name seminorm, adapted from the standard 
mathematical terminology.
2.2.1.1  Chosen Properties of Cl0,3(R)
Let us study some chosen properties of Clifford algebra of biquaternions. 
Firstly from (2.41), we know that the algebra Cl0,3(R) is in general noncom-
mutative; for example,
	
eij = −e ji   for i ≠j 	
(2.48)
	
eij ⋅eik = −eik ⋅eij   for i ≠j ≠k, i < j, i < k 	
(2.49)
	
eij ⋅e jk = −e jk ⋅eij   for i ≠j ≠k, i < j, j < k 	
(2.50)

26	
Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
	
eij ⋅ekj = −ekj ⋅eij   for i ≠j ≠k, i < j, k < j 	
(2.51)
Proof: Keeping in mind the property (2.42) we can write:
eij ⋅eik = eij ⋅ei
(
)⋅ek = −ei ⋅eij
(
)⋅ek = e jk,
eik ⋅eij = eik ⋅ei
(
)⋅e j = −ei ⋅eik
(
)⋅e j = ekj = −e jk
which proves (2.49). For (2.50), we have:
eije jk = ei ⋅e j
(
)e jk = ei ⋅e j ⋅e jk
(
) = −eik
e jk ⋅eij = −ekj
(
)⋅eij = −ek ⋅e j
(
)⋅eij = ek ⋅e j ⋅e ji
(
) = −eki = eik
Concerning (2.51), we have
eijekj = eij −e jk
(
) = −eije j
(
)ek = eik
ekjeij = ekj −e ji
(
) = −ekje j
(
)ei = eki = −eik
Example: The rules (2.49) and (2.50) apply to e12 · e13, e12 · e23, e13 · e23. We have
e12 ⋅e13 = e12 ⋅e1
(
)⋅e3 = −e1 ⋅e12
(
)⋅e3 = e23
e13 ⋅e12 = e13 ⋅e1
(
)⋅e2 = −e1 ⋅e13
(
)⋅e2 = e32 = −e23
e12 ⋅e23 = e1 ⋅e2
(
)⋅e23 = e1 ⋅e2 ⋅e23
(
) = −e13
e23 ⋅e12 = e23 ⋅e1 ⋅e2
(
) = −e23 ⋅e2 ⋅e1
(
) = e32 ⋅e2
(
)⋅e1 = −e31 = e13
e13 ⋅e23 = e13 ⋅e2 ⋅e3
(
) = e13 ⋅−e3 ⋅e2
(
) = −e13 ⋅e3
(
)⋅e2 = e12
e23 ⋅e13 = e23 ⋅e1 ⋅e3
(
) = e23 ⋅−e3 ⋅e1
(
) = −e23 ⋅e3
(
)⋅e1 = e21 = −e12

	
Survey of Chosen Hypercomplex Algebras
27
However, in some cases, the elements of the basis (2.43) commute:
	
ei ⋅e jk = e jk ⋅ei   for i ≠j ≠k, j < k 	
(2.52)
since ei · ejk = eij · ek = −eji · ek = −ej · eik = ej · eki = ejk · ei. It can be easily proved 
that it is true for e1 · e23, e2 · e13, and e3 · e12.
Finally, all multiplications of imaginary units by ω q are commutative; 
for example,
	
ei ⋅wq = wq ⋅ei     for i = 1,2,3
eij ⋅wq = wq ⋅eij   for i, j ∈1,2,3
{
}, i ≠j, i < j
	
(2.53)
Table 2.4 shows the multiplication rules in Cl0,3(R). The gray-colored 
cells represent products of imaginary units that commute.
Bearing in mind the multiplication properties in the Clifford algebra 
of biquaternions, we notice that any biquaternion defined by (2.45) can be 
expressed as a hypercomplex sum of two quaternions q0,q1 ∈ H; for example,
	
qCl = q0 + q1 ⋅wq 	
(2.54)
where q0 = r0 + r1 · e1 + r2 · e2 + r4 · e3 and q1 = r7 − r6 · e1 + r5 · e2 − r3 · e3. 
That is why the name biquaternion is justified.

2.2.2  The Clifford Algebra of Bioctonions
Let us present some basic definitions and properties of the Clifford algebra of 
bioctonions, Cl0,4(R). Its basis (2.40) includes sixteen elements:
1,e1,e2,e12,e3,e13,e23,e123,e4,e14,e24,e34,e124,e134,e234,e1234 = wο

In Table 2.5, we show all multiplication rules in the algebra of ­Clifford 
bioctonions. Using the basis (2.55), we define a Clifford bioctonion oCl ∈ Cl0,4(R) 
in a general form:
oCl = r0 + r1 ⋅e1 + r2 ⋅e2 + r3 ⋅e12 + r4 ⋅e3 + r5 ⋅e13 + r6 ⋅e23 + r7 ⋅e123 + r8 ⋅e4
    + r9 ⋅e14 + r10 ⋅e24 + r11 ⋅e124 + r12 ⋅e34 + r13 ⋅e134 + r14 ⋅e234 + r15 ⋅wο
 

(2.57)
where all ri ∈ R, i = 0,1,…,15. Its conjugate is
oCl
∗= r0 −r1 ⋅e1 −r2 ⋅e2 −r3 ⋅e12 −r4 ⋅e3 −r5 ⋅e13 −r6 ⋅e23 −r7 ⋅e123 −r8 ⋅e4

2.2.2.1  Chosen Properties of Cl0,4(R)
In this section, we present the properties of multiplication of elements of the 
basis of the Clifford algebra of bioctonions. All relations are shown without 
any proof. A reader interested in this subject can follow the derivation pre-
sented in [11].

Let us remark that products of elements eijk, i ≠ j ≠ k, i < j < k do not com-
mute. We do not present any evidence here because, by using all of the above 
relations, it is easy to develop forms of mutual products of e123,e124,e134,e234.
Further, it should be noted that—in some cases—multiplication of ele-
ments of the basis (2.55) by wο is commutative. Sometimes it is not. Let us 
study the simplest case of wο · ei, i = 1,2,3,4. We have
	
wο ⋅ei =  
−ei ⋅wο,
i = 1,2
ei ⋅wο,
i = 3,4
⎧⎨⎩
	
(2.70)
The consequences of (2.70) are changes in signs in multiplications wο · eij, 
i,j ∈ {1,2,3,4}, i ≠ j, i < j and wο · eijk, i,j,k ∈ {1,2,3,4}, i ≠ j ≠ k, i < j < k. We 
observe that only wο · e12, and wο · e34, commute. Lastly, the multiplication 
of wο by eijk, i ≠ j ≠ k, i < j < k satisfies the following:
	
wο ⋅e123 = e123 ⋅wο,
wο ⋅e124 = e124 ⋅wο
wο ⋅e134 = −e134 ⋅wο, wο ⋅e234 = −e234 ⋅wο

2.3  Comparison of Algebras
In Sections 2.1 and 2.2, we briefly presented some algebras used for the pur-
pose of the theory of complex and hypercomplex analytic signals. These are 
the Cayley-Dickson algebras of complex numbers, quaternions, and octonions, 
and the Clifford algebras of biquaternions and bioctonions. Of course, the 
family of different hypercomplex algebras is much wider, as shown in Figure 
2.3. The symbol ⊂ means “is included.” It should be noted that the properties 
of different algebras change when we move from bottom to top.
2.4  Applications of Hypercomplex Algebras in Signal 
Processing
Nowadays, it is observed that hypercomplex algebras find more and more 
applications in various domains. The most commonly used are quaternions, 
which is due to their structure and nice properties. The definition of a qua-
ternion given by (2.13) shows that it is suitable to apply in color image pro-
cessing. Sangwine et al. were the first to interpret its vector part in terms of 
three components: R (red), G (green), and B (blue) of a color image [12–15]. 
This allowed for the development of some advanced methods of color image

analysis, decomposition and compression [16], pattern recognition [17], and 
edge detection [12–14, 17–19], as well as to elaborate novel hypercomplex 
correlation techniques [20], filtering methods [14, 21, 22], and watermarking 
procedures [23–26].
The Fourier transformation methods based on quaternion algebra have 
also been proposed [12, 14, 27–31]. The Quaternion Fourier transformation 
will be described in Chapter 4. It should be noted that in the last few years, 
quaternions have also proliferated into the domain of wavelet transformation 
[32–36]. Quaternions also provide a very convenient notation for representing 
the rotations of a rigid body in 3-D space. This is due to the simple representa-
tion of rotations and a compact form of dynamics equations. Consequently, 
they are effectively applied in computer graphics [37–39], computer vision 
and robotics [40, 41], astrophysics [42], theoretical physics [43–45], and even 
in geodesy [46].
Concerning the octonions, we noted in Sections 2.1.3 and 2.3 that they 
have a more complicated form and worse properties than quaternions. Perhaps 
that is why, until recently, their practical applications were limited to math-
ematical physics, especially to fields such as electrodynamics, electromagnet-
ics, mechanics, and gravity theory [47, 48], as well to quantum physics [49]. 
Finally, the sedenions are rarely applied in theoretical physics [48] and quan-
tum physics [51, 52]. We see that the hypercomplex Cayley-Dickson algebras 
of the order 2N, N ≥ 3, are still waiting for new applications in various fields.
The construction and properties of Clifford algebras made them con-
venient to apply in various fields [53–56]. Their potential has been especially 
appreciated by researchers working in mathematical physics [39, 54, 55], as 
well as in robotics and computer vision [56, 59], and also in neural networks 
[60]. Recently, biquaternions and their different forms (reduced, commutative 
reduced) have also found applications in digital signal processing, especially 
in the design of hypercomplex filter banks [61, 62]. In color image processing, 
they have been used in template matching and color-sensitive edge detection 
[63], as well as in image recognition [64]. In multidimensional signal pro-
cessing, the Clifford algebras have found applications in frequency analysis. 
The Clifford Fourier transform, presented in Chapter 4, is commonly used 
in 3-D signal processing.
2.4.1  Complex and Hypercomplex Algebras in Multidimensional 
Signal Theory
In this book, we are especially interested in applications of hypercomplex alge-
bras in signal processing. Complex and hypercomplex signals are n-dimensional 

34	
Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
(n-D) generalizations of corresponding complex and hypercomplex numbers 
belonging to Cayley-Dickson and Clifford algebras.
The n-D complex-valued (abbreviated as complex) signal ψ c defined over 
the n-dimensional space x = (x1,x2,…,xn), x ∈ Rn, is given by
	
yc(x) = Reyc(x) + Imyc(x)⋅e1 	
(2.72)
where Reψ c(x) is its real part and Imψ c(x) is its imaginary part. The values of 
ψc are complex numbers (described in Section 2.1 concerning Cayley-Dickson 
algebras). The conjugate of (2.72) is
	
yc
∗(x) = Reyc(x) −Imyc(x)⋅e1	
(2.73)
and its norm
	
yc(x) =
Re2yc(x) + Im2yc(x) 	
(2.74)
It is evident that all operations on complex signals are similar to opera-
tions on complex numbers. In Chapter 5, a special class of complex signals—the 
n-D complex signals with single-orthant spectra—will be described.
The general form of an n-D hypercomplex (hypercomplex-valued) signal 
defined over the n-dimensional space x = (x1,x2,…,xn), x ∈ Rn is
	
y(x) = r0(x) +
ri(x)⋅ei
i=1
m
∑
	
(2.75)
with r0(x) as its real component and m imaginary components, all being 
n-D functions, m depends on the order 2N of a given Cayley-Dickson algebra 
(m = 2N − 1). For m = 3, we get the general form of an n-D quaternion signal 
(four components):
	
yq(x) = r0(x) + r1(x)⋅e1 + r2(x)⋅e2 + r3(x)⋅e3 	
(2.76)
For m = 7, the n-D octonion signal (eight components) is given by
	
yo(x) = r0(x) +
ri(x)⋅ei
i=1
7
∑
	
(2.77)
Of course, in this way we can get next higher-order n-D hypercomplex 
signals, but it is out of the scope of this book. A careful reader will notice that 

	
Survey of Chosen Hypercomplex Algebras
35
the dimension of the signal space should not be mixed with the order of the 
algebra (equal 22 = 4 for quaternions and 23 = 8 for octonions). For example, 
if we deal with 2-D RGB images represented by a quaternion, the signal space 
has the order 2, while the order of the quaternion algebra is 4. In Chapter 5 
we will discuss quaternion (of order 4) analytic signals defined in 2-D, and 
in Chapter 6 we will introduce rank-2 signals as 3-D signals of a quaternion 
(order 4) structure.
In analogy to quaternions (2.11), any n-D quaternion (quaternion-valued) 
signal (2.76) is a complex sum of two complex signals defined by (2.72)
	
yq(x) = yc0(x) + yc1(x)⋅e2 	
(2.78)
The same applies to n-D octonion (octonion-valued) signals represented 
by two n-D quaternion signals (and in consequence by four n-D complex 
signals) in the form
	
yo(x) = yq0(x) + yq1(x)⋅e4 	
(2.79)
The norm of the n-D Cayley-Dickson hypercomplex signal is defined 
analogously to the norm of a corresponding hypercomplex number (Table 
2.1) and equals
	
y(x) =
ri
2(x)
i=0
m
∑
	
(2.80)
Note that the square of the norm (2.80) defines the so called local amplitude 
of the n-D signal (see Chapter 7).
Let us now have a look at the definitions of Clifford biquaternion and 
bioctonion signals. They derive directly from (2.45) and (2.57). We define the 
n-D Clifford biquaternion signal as
	
qCl(x) = r0(x) + r1(x)⋅e1 + r2(x)⋅e2 + r3(x)⋅e12 + r4(x)⋅e3
+ r5(x)⋅e13 + r6(x)⋅e23 + r7(x)⋅wq
	
(2.81)
Its conjugate is
	
qCl
∗(x) = r0(x) −r1(x)⋅e1 −r2(x)⋅e2 −r3(x)⋅e12
−r4(x)⋅e3 −r5(x)⋅e13 −r6(x)⋅e23 −r7(x)⋅wq
	
(2.82)

36	
Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
Let us note that the norm of the signal (2.81) is not the standard Euclid-
ean norm due to the minus sign appearing as a consequence of multiplication 
rules in Cl0,3(R). We have
qCl(x) =
qCl(x)⋅qCl
∗(x)
=
r0
2(x) + r1
2(x) + r2
2(x) + r3
2(x) + r4
2(x) + r5
2(x) + r6
2(x) −r7
2(x)  

(2.83)
sometimes called a seminorm of (2.81).
The n-D Clifford bioctonion signal is a generalized Clifford bioctonion 
number given by (2.56)
oCl(x) = r0(x) + r1(x)⋅e1 + r2(x)⋅e2 + r3(x)⋅e12 + r4(x)⋅e3 + r5(x)⋅e13
+ r6(x)⋅e23 + r7(x)⋅e123 + r8(x)⋅e4 + r9(x)⋅e14 + r10(x)⋅e24
+ r11(x)⋅e124 + r12(x)⋅e34 + r13(x)⋅e134 + r14(x)⋅e234 + r15(x)⋅wο  

(2.84)
The conjugate of (2.84) is
oCl
∗(x) = r0(x) −r1(x)⋅e1 −r2(x)⋅e2 −r3(x)⋅e12 −r4(x)⋅e3 −r5(x)⋅e13
−r6(x)⋅e23 −r7(x)⋅e123 −r8(x)⋅e4 −r9(x)⋅e14 −r10(x)⋅e24
−r11(x)⋅e124 −r12(x)⋅e34 −r13(x)⋅e134 −r14(x)⋅e234 −r15(x)⋅wο  

(2.85)
and in its norm (seminorm), we once again notice minus signs as in (2.58) 
as follows
oCl(x) =
oCl(x)⋅oCl
∗(x)
=
r0
2(x) +…+ r6
2(x) −r7
2(x) +…+ r10
2 (x) −r11
2(x) + r12
2 (x) −r13
2 (x) −r14
2 (x) + r15
2 (x)

2.5  Summary
In this chapter, we presented mathematical bases of the theory of chosen 
algebras of complex and hypercomplex numbers. We put our attention on 
Cayley-Dickson algebras of complex numbers, quaternions, and octonions, 

	
Survey of Chosen Hypercomplex Algebras
37
and compared their definitions and properties with Clifford biquaternions 
and bioctonions.
In Section 2.1.1, we described the Cayley-Dickson construction, a very 
elegant way of defining hypercomplex algebras of order 2N known as Cay-
ley-Dickson algebras. In Sections 2.1.2 and 2.1.3, we studied the proper-
ties of quaternions and octonions enriched with proofs of some results. We 
noticed that by increasing the order of the algebra, we lose some properties. 
For example, the multiplication in C is commutative, while in higher order 
Cayley-Dickson algebras is, in general, not commutative. Consequently, the 
order of multiplication in H and in O. cannot be changed. Bearing in mind 
the similarity of definitions, we were interested in selected Clifford algebras 
known as Clifford biquaternions and Clifford bioctonions; these were briefly 
presented in Section 2.2.
The scheme from Figure 2.3 (Section 2.3) clearly showed mutual rela-
tions between different algebras, including those that are not presented in this 
book. Section 2.4 described different fields of the latest practical applications 
of complex and hypercomplex algebras. In the following chapters, the reader 
will become familiar with their applications in the domain of multidimen-
sional signal processing, especially in multidimensional analytic signal theory.

Orthants of the n-Dimensional 
Cartesian Space and Single-Orthant 
Operators
3.1  The Notion of an Orthant
In 1992, Stefan Hahn presented a paper with definitions and a description of 
n-D analytic signals with single-orthant spectra [1]. The following description 
is devoted to readers unfamiliar with the notion of orthants. We deal with 
two domains: the signal-domain and the frequency-domain. The n-D signal 
is a function of the n-tuple x = (x1,x2,…,xn). Its Fourier spectrum is a function 
of the n-tuple f = ( f1,f2,…,fn) in the frequency-domain Cartesian rectangular 
coordinate system. Let us recall that there are two equivalent definitions of 
n-D analytic signals:
• The analytic signal is defined by the inverse n-D Fourier transform of 
a single-orthant spectrum.
• The analytic signal is defined by the convolution of a real signal u(x) 
with a complex delta distribution.
Detailed descriptions of both methods are presented in Chapter 5. 
For convenience, let us illustrate both methods for 1-D signals (usually 

44

functions of time). The Fourier transform of a real time signal u(t) defined 
by the integral
U( f ) =
u(t)exp[−j2pft]dt
−∞
∞
∫
= Re( f ) −jIm( f )
is called the complex Fourier spectrum of u(t) with support in both negative 
and positive frequencies. The 1-D analytic signal is defined by the inverse 
Fourier transform of a one-sided spectrum at positive frequencies. This one-
sided spectrum is given by a product of the unit step 2 × 1(f ) = 1 + sgn (f ) 
(the use of a double unit step is a matter of convention) and U(f ): Γ(f ) = [1 
+ sgn(f )]U(f ).
The inverse Fourier transform yields a complex function called analytic 
signal y(t) =
1+ sgn( f )
⎡⎣
⎤⎦
−∞
∞
∫
U( f )exp[ j2pft]df = u(t) + jv(t).
The imaginary part v(t) is called the Hilbert transform of u(t). Because 
a product in the frequency domain corresponds to a convolution in the time 
domain, the analytic signal can be written in the form ψ(t) = [δ(t) + j(1/πt)] 
∗ u(t), we applied the Fourier pairs d(t)⇔
F
1 and 1/pt⇔
F
sgn( f ) .
In the above descriptions, the 1-D frequency domain space has the form 
of a line being a union of two half-lines separated by the point of the origin. 
The 2-D frequency domain has the form of a plane being a union of four 
quadrants separated by the coordinate axes f1 = 0 and f2 = 0. Then, the 3-D 
frequency-space is a union of eight octants separated by the coordinate axes 
f1 = 0, f2 = 0 and f3 = 0 (see Figure 3.1). In general, the n-D frequency-space 
is a union of 2n orthants separated by n coordinate axes. Of course, the same 
names apply for the signal-space.

3.2  Single-Orthant Operators
The single-orthant spectrum of the analytic signal is defined by the relation:
single-orthant spectrum = single-orthant operator × Fourier spectrum  

(3.1)
The single-orthant operator can be defined using the unit step distribu-
tion. The 1-D unit step can be defined using the signum distribution

and the subscript hl denotes a half-line. The use of the factor 2 is a matter of 
convention. This factor indicates that the energy of the analytic signal is a sum 
of energies of the real signal and of its Hilbert transform, which are equal.

f2 > 0, is
	
22 ⋅1 f1

(

(

(

In general, the n-D single-orthant operator is a product of n 1-D opera-
tors and is a separable function (distribution).
3.3  Decomposition of Real Functions into Even and Odd 
Terms
Each n-D function defined in Rn (Cartesian rectangular coordinates) may be 
decomposed into a union of terms regarding the evenness and oddness. In 
1-D, a real signal is in general a union of two terms
	
u(x) = ue + uo 	
(3.9)
The even and odd terms are
	
ue(x) = u(x) + u(−x)
2
uo(x) = u(x) −u(−x)
2
	
(3.10)
Similarly, the 2-D signal is a union of four terms: even-even (ee), even-
odd (eo), odd-even (oe) and odd-odd (oo) as follows
	
u x1,x2
(
) = uee x1,x2
(

(

	 (3.15)
The above decomposition (3.11) is relative and changes with transla-
tion and rotation of the Cartesian coordinates. If the signal is an even-even 
function, its Fourier transform is a real function. Otherwise, it is a complex 
(hypercomplex) function (see Chapter 4). Figure 3.4 shows the decomposi-
tion of the single-quadrant cube function Πa(x1 −(a/2),x2 −(a/2))  into 
even-even, even-odd, odd-even and odd-odd parts. We observe the factor ¼ 
appearing with a sign according to the sign of u in a given quadrant. Next,

Continuing, the 3-D signal is a union of eight terms indexed eee, eeo, eoe,

Fourier Transformation in Analysis of 
n-Dimensional Signals
This chapter presents two different approaches to the frequency analysis of 
n-dimensional signals. The first approach is the complex Fourier transfor-
mation—a well-known and commonly used tool in frequency analysis. The 
second approach applies the hypercomplex Fourier transformation. The 1-D 
complex Fourier transformations have been the subject of a multitude of sci-
entific papers and books dealing with time signals [1–3]. In image processing, 
the 2-D complex Fourier transformation has also found many interesting 
applications. Our intention is not to once again recall their properties. We 
will instead focus on their relation to the Cayley-Dickson Fourier transforma-
tions defined basing on the hypercomplex algebras described in Section 2.1.
Section 4.1 is devoted to basics of the theory of complex and hypercom-
plex Fourier transformations of 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D signals. We will show that, 
in the complex case, the full information about a frequency content of a n-D 
real signal is in a half-space f1 > 0. While using the hypercomplex approach, 
it is limited to a single frequency orthant of Rn. We will also decompose the 
Fourier spectra into even-odd components and study their mutual relations.
Section 4.2 presents the theoretical basics of Cayley-Dickson transfor-
mations, including the well-known quaternion Fourier transform (QFT) and 
the more recently defined octonion Fourier transform (OFT). In Section 4.3, 

54	
Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
we present formulas relating QFT and OFT to 2-D and 3-D complex Fourier 
transforms proving equivalence of both approaches. The theory is illustrated 
with examples of spectra of different test signals.
Section 4.4 describes some applications of the presented theory.
4.1  Complex n-D Fourier Transformation
Consider an n-D signal u(x), where x = (x1,x1,…,xn) is a n-D signal-domain 
variable. The n-D complex Fourier transformation (FT) defines the n-D fre-
quency function U(f ), f = (f1,f1,…,fn), called the frequency spectrum, or more 
concisely, the “spectrum of u.” Generally, U(f ) is a complex-valued function 
defined by the integral
	
U( f ) =
u(x)
n∫
exp −j2pfixi
(
)dnx
i=1
n
∏
	
(4.1)
Let us remark that for n = 1, we get the 1-D spectrum U(f ) of a signal u(t), 
where t denotes the time variable:
	
U( f ) =
u(t)exp(−j2pft)
!∫
dt 	
(4.2)
Example 4.1  Spectrum of the 1-D Gaussian Signal
The 1-D Gaussian signal is defined as
	
u(t) =

s 2p exp −(t −m)2
2s2
⎡
⎣⎢
⎤
⎦⎥	
(4.3)
In probability theory, u is a probability density function of a normal 
(Gaussian) distribution, μ is the expected value, and σ 2 is the variance. In 
signal theory, μ represents a time-shift of a signal and σ determines the slope 
of the signal plot. Figure 4.1(a) shows two Gaussian signals for μ = 0, σ = 
1 and Figure 4.1(b) shows a Gaussian signal for μ = 2, σ = 2. The Gaussian 
signal (4.3) has a Gaussian-shaped spectrum U(f ) given by
	
U( f ) = exp −8p2s2 f 2
(
)exp(−j2pf m)

where we used the time-shift property of the 1-D Fourier transformation (see 
Appendix A). Figure 4.2 presents the spectrum of u(t) = 1/ 2p exp −t2/2
(
) 
(μ = 0, σ = 1 in (4.3)) given by U(f ) = exp(−8π 2f 2) We see that the frequency 
support of the spectrum is much smaller than its time support (see Figure 
4.1(a)). It is a consequence of the scaling property of the 1-D FT (see Appen-
dix A). On the other hand, the spectrum amplitude U(0) is bigger than the

is defined as

Figure 4.3 shows mesh and surface plots of this spectrum for σ 1 = 1, 
σ 2 = 2, and ρ = 0.5. Let us compare the frequency supports of the spectrum to 
the signal–domain supports from Figure 3.3. We see that the wider the signal 
along the x-axis, the narrower its spectrum along the corresponding f-axis (the 
consequence of the scaling property of FT; see Appendix C).
The transformation from the frequency domain into the signal domain

We see that (4.8) differs from (4.1) only in the change of sign inside the 
exponential. This property is called the duality of the Fourier transformation.1

In Chapter 3, it was shown that n-D signals can be represented as sums of 
components of different parity. The number of these components is always 2n. 
It is evident for n = 1, since u(t) = ue(t) + uo(t) (i.e., we have 2 = 21 components

even (subscript e) and odd (subscript o) regarding t). For n = 2, the signal u(x1,x2) 
is a sum of 4 = 22 components: even-even uee(x1,x2), even-odd ueo(x1,x2), odd-
even uoe(x1,x2), and odd-odd uoo(x1,x2) where the first letter in the subscript 
indicates parity regarding x1 and the second one indicates parity with regard 
to x2. Let us describe in detail cases n = 1, 2, 3.
4.1.1  Spectrum of a 1-D Real Signal in Terms of its Even and Odd 
Components
Let us recall that a signal u(t) is a sum of its even and odd components: u(t) = 
ue(t) + uo(t). From (4.2) we get
	
U( f ) =  ue(t)cos(2pft)dt
!∫
−j uo(t)sin(2pft)dt
!∫
	
(4.11)
We see that U(f ) is, in general, a complex-valued function
	
U( f ) = Ue( f ) −j ⋅Uo( f ) = U( f ) exp jargU( f )
⎡⎣
⎤⎦	
(4.12)
with the real part Ue(f ) given by the 1-D cosine Fourier transform of the even 
component ue(t) (called the real part of the spectrum of u or the real spectrum); 
that is
	
Ue( f ) =
ue(t)cos(2pft)dt
!∫
	
(4.13)
and the imaginary part Uo(f ) being the 1-D sine Fourier transform of the odd 
component uo(t) (known as the imaginary part of the spectrum or the imagi-
nary spectrum):
	
Uo( f ) =
uo(t)sin(2pft)dt
!∫
	
(4.14)
Let us remark that some authors apply a minus sign in (4.14) and express 
the complex-valued spectrum as U(f ) = Ue(f ) + j · Uo(f ).
The absolute value of U(f ) is called the amplitude spectrum and its argu-
ment φ(f ) = argU(f ) is called the phase spectrum. If u is a real signal, the real 
spectrum Ue(f ) is an even function, while the imaginary spectrum Uo(f ) is 
an odd one, that is

60	
Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
	
Ue(−f ) = Ue( f ),
Uo(−f ) = −Uo( f ).
	
(4.15)
As a consequence
	
U(−f ) = Ue(−f ) −jUo(−f ) = Ue( f ) + jUo( f ) = U ∗( f )	 (4.16)
meaning that the 1-D complex Fourier transform of a 1-D real signal is Hermi-
tian symmetric. So, the full information about the frequency content of a 1-D real-
valued signal is included in a half-axis f > 0 (in a 1-D single frequency orthant).
The amplitude spectrum U( f )  of a 1-D real signal u(t) given by
	
|U( f )|=
Ue
2( f ) +Uo
2( f ) 	
(4.17)
is also an even function of f, because U(−f ) =
Ue
2(−f ) +Uo
2(−f ) = U( f ) . 
However, the phase spectrum φ(f ) = argU(f ) defined by relations
	
cosj( f ) = Ue( f )
U( f ) ,  sinj f( ) = −Uo( f )
U( f ) 	
(4.18)
is an odd function of f. Hence, for real signals we have
	
U( f ) = U(−f ) ,  j( f ) = −j(−f ).	
(4.19)
Example 4.3  Amplitude and Phase Spectra of a One-Sided Exponential Signal
The one-sided exponential signal is given by
	
u(t) = exp(−at)⋅1(t),  a > 0 	
(4.20)
and its Fourier spectrum is a complex-valued function of f:
	
U( f ) =
1
a + j2pf 	
(4.21)
(see Appendix B). Then, the amplitude spectrum has the form
	
U( f ) =
1

In Figure 4.4, we observe two plots of the one-sided exponential signal 
(4.20) for α = 0.5 and α = 2. We see that the slope of the curve depends on 
the value of the parameter α. The smaller the value of α, the wider the signal 
time-domain support. Figure 4.5(a) shows amplitude, and Figure 4.5(b) shows 
phase spectra of this signal. Once again, we notice the consequences of the 
scaling property of the Fourier transform (i.e., for smaller values of α, the 
frequency support of the amplitude spectrum is narrower and the slope of the 
phase characteristic of the signal is larger); see Appendix A.
4.1.2  Spectrum of a 2-D Real Signal in Terms of its Even and Odd 
Components
The 2-D real signal u(x1,x2) is a sum of four components: u(x1,x2) = uee(x1,x2) 
+ ueo(x1,x2) + uoe(x1,x2) + uoo(x1,x2). Its spectrum (4.5) can easily be developed 
as a complex-valued function

The function Uee( f1,f2) is known as the 2-D cosine Fourier transform of 
uee(x1,x2), while Uoo( f1,f2) is the 2-D sine Fourier transform of uoo(x1,x2). The 
relations (4.27)–(4.28) define so called mixed (sine-cosine) FTs of even-odd 
and odd-even components of the signal u(x1,x2). We have the following sym-
metry properties

4.2  Cayley-Dickson Fourier Transformation
4.2.1  General Formulas
The n-D Cayley-Dickson Fourier transformation is defined on the basis of the 
Cayley-Dickson algebra described in Chapter 2, Section 2.1. Its kernel differs 
from the kernel of the n-D complex FT given by (4.1), as will be explained 
below.
The general form of the n-D Cayley-Dickson Fourier transform UCD(f ), 
f = ( f1,f1,…,fn) of a n-D real signal u(x), x = (x1,x1,…,xn) is

where the subscript k = 2i–1. For n = 1, (4.49) is exactly the same as (4.2). For 
n = 2, the definition (4.49) is equivalent to the Quaternion Fourier transform 
Uq( f1,f2) of a 2-D real signal u(x1,x2) defined by T. Bülow [4] in the form

Introducing in (4.50) the following simplified notation for i = 1,2:
	
ci = cos 2pfixi
(
), si = sin 2pfixi
(
)	
(4.51)
we expand the kernel as follows
	
exp −e12pf1x1
(

(
) = c1−s1⋅e1
(
) c2−s2 ⋅e2
(
)
= c1c2 −s1c2 ⋅e1 −c1s2 ⋅e2 + s1s2 ⋅e3
	
(4.52)
We see that the kernel (4.52) has a form of a quaternion-valued function 
(we applied the multiplication rule of multiplication in H: e1 · e2 = e3).
Let us consider now the case n = 3. The Cayley-Dickson spectrum of a 
3-D real signal u(x1,x2,x3) is expressed as
UCD f1, f2, f3
(
) =
u x1,x2,x3

(4.53)
In the above definition, the order of multiplication of exponentials form-
ing the kernel of the transformation is from left to right. We will show below 
that this product is an octonion-valued function and this fact inspired the 
authors of [5] to call (4.53) the octonion Fourier transform of a 3-D real signal 
u(x1,x2,x3). The choice of imaginary units {e1,e2,e4} in exponents is arbitrary 
and has been inspired by the definition (4.50) of the QFT, where the order is 
{e1,e2}. Of course, other sets of imaginary units in the kernel of the Cayley-
Dickson FT could be used to get the octonion kernel function, such as {e1,e7,e2} 
or {e2,e3,e6} (the reader can easily find other triples basing on Table 2.3 or 
Figure 2.2 of Chapter 2). The kernel of (4.53) is expanded as

frequency variables. Let us consider first the case of n = 2.

Components
We know that the 2-D real signal u(x1,x2) is a sum of its four components: 
even-even, even-odd, odd-even and odd-odd, respectively: u(x1,x2) = uee(x1,x2) 
+ ueo(x1,x2) + uoe(x1,x2) + uoo(x1,x2). We introduce this form into (4.50) and get
	
Uq f1, f2
(
) = Uee −Uoe ⋅e1 −Ueo ⋅e2 +Uoo ⋅e3 	
(4.58)
where all terms are defined as in (4.25)–(4.28). We remember that Uee, Uoe, 
Ueo and Uoo satisfy symmetry relations shown in (4.29). Therefore we obtain
	
Uq −f1, f2
(
) = Uee +Uoe ⋅e1 −Ueo ⋅e2 −Uoo ⋅e3 	
(4.59)

72	
Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
	
Uq f1,−f2
(
) = Uee −Uoe ⋅e1 +Ueo ⋅e2 −Uoo ⋅e3 	
(4.60)
	
Uq −f1,−f2
(
) =  Uee +Uoe ⋅e1 +Ueo ⋅e2 +Uoo ⋅e3 	
(4.61)
Let us show that the Quaternion Fourier spectrum in successive quad-
rants of the frequency plane is expressed as a hypercomplex function of the 
spectrum in the first quadrant ( f1 > 0,f2 > 0), that is
	
Uq −f1, f2
(
) = −e2 ⋅Uq f1, f2
(
)⋅e2 	
(4.62)
	
Uq f1,−f2
(
) = −e1 ⋅Uq f1, f2

(
) = −e3 ⋅Uq f1, f2

called involutions [6, 7].2

ei ⋅e j
(
)⋅ei =

⎧⎨

(4.65)
let us develop the right side of (4.62):
−e2 ⋅Uq f1, f2
(
)⋅e2 = −e2 ⋅Uee −Uoe ⋅e1 −Ueo ⋅e2 +Uoo ⋅e3
(
)⋅e2
= Uee +Uoe ⋅e1 −Ueo ⋅e2 −Uoo ⋅e3 = Uq −f1, f2
(
)
getting the formula (4.59) and proving the symmetry relation (4.62). In the 
exact same manner (keeping the order of multiplication from left to right) we 
can prove formulas (4.63)–(4.64). We leave this to the reader.
As a consequence of (4.62)–(4.64), we see that using the quaternion 
approach, the whole information about the real signal u(x1,x2) is contained in a sin-
gle quadrant of the frequency plane, usually chosen as ( f1 > 0,f2 > 0) (Figure 4.9).
2 The involution f means a function that is its own inverse (e.g., f( f(x)) = x for every x belonging to the 
domain of f ). The involution is linear: f(αx1 + βx2) = αf(x1) + βf(x2); α,β ∈ R and the involution 
of a product is the product of involutions written in the reversed order: f(x1 · x2) = f(x2) · f(x1) [7].

4.2.3  Octonion Fourier Spectrum in Terms of its Even and Odd 
Components
As a 3-D real signal u(x1,x2,x3) is a sum of eight terms: u(x1,x2,x3) = ueee + 
ueeo + ueoe + ueoo + uoee + uoeo + uooe + uooo (all being functions of (x1,x2,x3)), we 
introduce it to (4.53) as follows
UCD f1, f2, f3
(
)
= Ueee −Uoee ⋅e1 −Ueoe ⋅e2 +Uooe ⋅e3 −Ueeo ⋅e4 +Uoeo ⋅e5 +Ueoo ⋅e6 −Uooo ⋅e7  

(4.66)
and express the Octonion Fourier transform of a 3-D real signal as an octonion 
sum of the same terms as in (4.39). In Table 4.2, we show the signs of all terms 
of the octonion FT in all octants of the 3-D frequency space.
Let us show that the Octonion Fourier spectrum in successive octants of 
the frequency space is expressed as a hypercomplex function of the spectrum 
in the first octant ( f1 > 0,f2 > 0,f3 > 0). To simplify the notation, we denote 
with α i the involution:
	
ai UCD
(
) = ei ⋅UCD
(
)⋅ei 	
(4.67)
It means that, for every imaginary unit from the octonion basis {1,e1,e2,…
,e7}, we can write α i(ej) = (ei · ej) · ei. If i = j, α i(ei) = (ei · ei) · ei = −1 · ei = −ei. 
In the case of i ≠ j, α i(ej) = (ei · ej) · ei = (−ej · ei) · ei and then, using the alter-
nativity of octonions (see Chapter 2, (2.38)), we get α i(ej) = (−ej · ei) · ei = 
−(ej · ei) · ei = −ej(ei · ei) = −ej · (−1) = ej. Shortly:

We see that using the octonion approach, the full information about the 
frequency content of a 3-D real signal is included in a single octant ( f1 > 0,f2 > 
0,f3 > 0) of the 3-D frequency space (Figure 4.10).
Let us now prove the relation (4.69).
Proof: Based on Table 4.2, we see that UCD(−f1,f2,f3) differs from UCD( f1,f2,f3) 
in signs of components corresponding to e1,e3,e5,e7. We notice that, accord-
ing to (4.68), each involution α i changes the sign of Ueee · 1 and the sign of 
the term corresponding to ei. In Table 4.3 the effects of superposition of four 
involutions α 1 ∘ α 3 ∘ α 5 ∘ α 7 are shown. We observe that the bottom row is 
exactly the same as the second from Table 4.2. In an analogous way, we can 
prove other relations (4.69)–(4.75).

4.3  Relations Between Complex and Hypercomplex Fourier 
Transforms
In this Section, we will show the equivalence of complex and hypercomplex 
approaches in 2-D and 3-D signal analysis. By having a complex Fourier 
spectrum of a 2-D/3-D real signal, we can easily derive analytic formulas of 
quaternion and octonion Fourier spectra. The reader can follow up proofs 
of both formulas and also notice usefulness of even-odd decomposition of 
complex Fourier spectra.

4.3.1  Relation Between QFT and 2-D FT
Let us consider a 2-D real signal u(x1,x2) and its 2-D complex Fourier trans-
form U( f1,f2) given by (4.5). Its Quaternion FT is given by (4.50). It can be 
shown that the QFT is related to U( f1,f2) by the relation

(4.76)
It should be noted that the order of terms in (4.76) plays no role in case 
if the spectrum U( f1,f2) is a real function. If U( f1,f2) is a complex-valued 
function, the order cannot be changed (bearing in mind the properties of 
multiplication in Cayley-Dickson algebras (the absence of commutativity is 
described in Chapter 2)).
Proof of (4.76): Starting with (4.50), we can write
U

which proves (4.76).
It should be noted that (4.76) can easily be verified using the even-odd

= Uee −Uoe ⋅e1 −Ueo ⋅e2 +Uoo ⋅e3
and obtain the result identical to (4.58).
Let us remark that in Chapter 7, we will come back to complex and 
hypercomplex analysis of 2-D and 3-D real signals. Namely, we will analyze 
the polar components of 2-D complex and quaternion analytic signals and 
show that the number of amplitude-phase components is the same in both 
cases. Moreover, the polar components are related by formulas that can be 
simplified in case of separable signals.
4.3.2  Relation Between OFT and 3-D FT
The formula relating the 3-D OFT (4.53) and the 3-D FT (4.1) has been 
derived for the first time in [8]; after some modifications, it was presented 
with a proof in its final version in [9]. It is as follows:

spectrum U ( f1, f2, f3). Let us recall that “e” in the subscript means the even 
parity of U ( f1, f2, f3) regarding a corresponding variable fi and “o” is the odd 
parity. We see that the components are the same in both approaches (complex 
and hypercomplex), which once again proves their equivalence.
4.4  Survey of Applications of Complex and Hypercomplex 
Fourier Transformations
For many years and even recently, the most important role in signal process-
ing has been dedicated to the 1-D and 2-D complex Fourier transformation. 
We could enumerate ad infinitum some different fields of their applications, 
such as spectrum analysis, signal filtration, signal sampling, modulation, time-
frequency analysis, wavelet processing, stochastic signal processing, image 
analysis and processing, audio and image watermarking, and data compression. 
In [1–3, 10–13], one can find a lot of interesting applications of the complex 
Fourier transformation.
In this book, however, we would like to put the reader’s attention on 
a continuously growing role of the hypercomplex Fourier analysis. In recent 
years, the Quaternion Fourier transform has become an alternative to the 2-D 
complex FT in color image processing [4, 14–20]. In [16], Sangwine and Ell 
defined the discrete QFT, and in [21] they decomposed it into a pair of 2-D 
complex FTs. Consequently, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques can 
be applied in quaternion color image processing [22]. Various watermarking 
techniques based on embedding a color watermark into a chosen part of the 
quaternion hypercomplex spectrum have been developed in the last decade 
[23–27]. The Figure 4.11 shows a general image watermarking scheme using 
the QFT. The watermark can be embedded in the Quaternion Fourier spec-
trum coefficients of the original image according to the chosen watermark 
embedding algorithm.
Figure 4.12 shows the proposed general QFT-image watermarking detec-
tion scheme. The idea is based on the comparison of QFTs to the original and 
watermarked images, and as a result, the extraction of a watermark.
This idea is often combined with other methods, as with the Quater-
nion Singular Value Decomposition [27, 28]. The QFT is also used in color 
image enhancement [18, 29], and in pattern recognition and texture analysis 
[30–32]. The hypercomplex Fourier methods have also found some applica-
tions in physics [33, 34].

4.4.1  Applications in the Domain of Analytic Signals
As will be shown in Chapter 5, the complex and hypercomplex Fourier trans-
formation is a theoretical basis of the frequency-domain definitions of multidi-
mensional analytic signals [35, 36]. The n-D complex/hypercomplex analytic 
signal is defined as the inverse complex/hypercomplex Fourier transform of 
the spectrum multiplied by the single-orthant operator (1.11). Figure 4.13 
presents a general scheme of generation of the n-D complex/hypercomplex 
analytic signal ψ(x).
4.5  Summary
In this chapter, we recalled basics of the theory of complex and hypercomplex 
Fourier transforms of n-D real signals with emphasis on 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D 
cases. We expressed different spectra as complex or hypercomplex sums of 
components differing in even/odd parity regarding corresponding variables. 
This allowed us to notice that, in the complex case, the full information about 
the frequency content of a n-D real signal is in a half space f1 > 0. Differently, 
using the hypercomplex approach, we saw that a single orthant of the n-D 
frequency space contains full information about the frequency structure of n-D 
real signals. The formulas relating complex and hypercomplex FTs are very 
important from a practical point of view. They can be used to derive quater-
nion and octonion Fourier spectra starting with 2-D and 3-D complex FTs.

Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic 
Signals
This chapter presents the theory of multidimensional complex and hypercom-
plex analytic signals. The starting point is a real n-D signal u(x), a function 
of the n-D Cartesian variable x = (x1,x1,…,xn). In one dimension, we usually 
deal with functions of time u(t). The 1-D Fourier spectrum U(f ) may be a 
complex function U(f ) = Re(f ) + jIm(f ) of the 1-D frequency variable f. The 
support of U has a part at positive frequencies and a part at negative frequen-
cies. The spectrum of the complex analytic signal is obtained by canceling 
the part at negative frequencies and doubling the part at positive frequencies. 
The inverse Fourier transform of this one-sided spectrum yields the analytic 
signal of the form ψ(t) = u(t) + jv(t), where v(t) is the Hilbert transform of 
u. It should be noted that the term analytic signal is not identical to the term 
analytic function (see next point) [1, 2].
In the case of 2-D real signals u(x1,x2), the corresponding spectrum may 
be defined by a complex or hypercomplex Fourier transform (a quaternion 
Fourier transform) [3]. We have a 2-D complex or hypercomplex spectra with 
a support in all four quadrants. The corresponding analytic signals are defined 
by the inverse Fourier transform of a single-quadrant spectrum. The multi-
plication of U by a 2-D frequency domain unit step function yields a single 
quadrant spectrum. The generalization of this procedure is straightforward

Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
and presented in this chapter. The important polar forms of analytic signals 
are described in Chapter 8. A special kind of 2-D analytic signals introduced 
by Felsberg and Sommer [4] is called monogenic signals. The term analytic does 
not have the same interpretation with regard to analytic signals with single-
orthant spectra for monogenic signals.
5.1  1-D Analytic Signals as Boundary Distributions of 1-D 
Analytic Functions
The term analytic signal has been applied by Gabor [5] to a complex function 
of a real variable x (usually a time variable x = t) of the form ψ(x) = u(x) + 
jv(x). This signal is defined as a boundary distribution of a complex function 
ψ(z) of a complex variable z = x + jy of the form.
	
y(z) =ψ (x, y) = u(x, y) + jv(x, y) 	
(5.1)
Usually, x = t and y = τ are time variables. Not every complex function is 
analytic. It should satisfy the conditions of analyticity. Let us recall the notion 
of the Cauchy integrals. Consider a Cartesian complex plane (x,jy) ⊂ C and a 
region D ⊂ C. For an analytic function, the circular integral for each closed 
path in C equals zero.
	
f (z)dz
C!∫
= 0 	
(5.2)
This integral is called the first Cauchy integral. Let us define a new func-
tion f(z)/(z − z0). This function has a pole at the point z0. The contour integral 
of this function is
	
f (z)
z −z0

Let us take the contour presented in Figure 5.1. It contains three parts: 
a large half-circle of a radius CR, a small half-circle around the pole z0, and a 
line parallel to the x-axis, y = y − ε.

The expression in parenthesis is called complex delta distribution [10]. 
Of course, the imaginary part is also a distribution. It should be noted that 
H[δ(x)] = ​1/(πx) (i.e., the complex delta distribution has the structure of an

form (complex spectrum) of the signal u(x) by U(f ). Because convolution in 
the signal domain corresponds to a product in the frequency domain, the 
spectrum of the analytic signal has the form

The Hilbert transform is v(x) = sin(ωx) and ψ(x) = ejωx , ω = 2πfo. The 
instantaneous amplitude A(x) = u2 + v2 =1 and the instantaneous phase φ(x) 
= tan–1(v/u) = ωx. This example is presented to get comparisons with similar 
examples for 2-D and 3-D signals.
Example 5.2
This example with a simple Gaussian pulse is an introduction to similar exam-
ples for 2-D and 3-D signals. Consider the Gaussian signal and its Fourier 
spectrum

The signal u is an even function and the Hilbert transform v is an odd

We now recall Vakman’s conditions (criteria), which the operator of the 
Hilbert transform and analytic signals must satisfy [30, 31].
• First condition: The operator H of the Hilbert transform must be 
continuous:
H[u + ∂u] ⇒H[u] for ∂u →0
• Second condition: Phase independence of scaling and homogeneity. Let 
the signal u(t) be replaced by εu(t) for a small constant ε > 0. Then its 
instantaneous phase and frequency must remain the same (see polar 
representation in Chapter 7).
• Third condition: Harmonic independence: The Hilbert transform of 
the cosine signal A cos(ωt + φ) must be A sin(ωt + φ).

5.2  The n-D Analytic Signal
The 1-D analytic signals are boundary distributions of 1-D analytic functions. 
The extension for n-D functions (signals) is straightforward. Consider the n-D 
complex space Cn of complex variables z = (z1,z2,…,zn); zk = xk + jyk. The space 
C is a Cartesian product of n complex planes. We define a complex-valued 
n-D function analytic in the region Dn = D1 × D2 × … × Dn, Dn ⊂ Cn, Dk ⊂ 
Ck. The function f(z) is represented by the n-D Cauchy integral:
	
f (z) =

(5.24)
where δDk are closed contours each (as shown in Figure 5.1). The procedure 
of integration for each contour is the same as in the 1-D case. In consequence, 
the 1-D signal in (5.11) is replaced by the product

The subscript 1 denotes the single quadrant spectrum in the first quad-
rant. The single quadrant frequency operator in (5.32) (see Chapter 3) can be 
written more compactly in the form of a 2-D unit step
	
4 × 1( f ) = 1+ s1 + s2 + s1s2; s1 = sgn f1
( ); s2 = sgn f2
(
) 	
(5.33)
The signal (5.28) has the single quadrant spectrum in the first quadrant 
(see Chapter 3). The corresponding signals and its frequency operators for the 
quadrants 1, 2, 3, and 4 are displayed in Table 5.1.
Note that we have two pairs of conjugate signals: ψ 1 = ψ 4
∗ and ψ 2 = ψ 3
∗. 
This is the consequence of Hermitian symmetry of the complex spectrum of 
the real signal u. The insertion in the Fourier transform of the four terms of 
the signal u(x1,x2) = uee + uoe + ueo + uoo yields

Consequently, the spectral information in the half-plane f1 < 0 is redun-

are equal since uv = v1v2, and consequently,

Note the two quadrant support of the spectrum in the first and fourth 
quadrant. The total Hilbert transform is v(x1,x2) = −cos[2π( f10x1 + f20x2)] and 
the two partial Hilbert transforms are v1(x1,x2) = sin[2π( f10x1 + f20x2)] and 
v2(x1,x2) = sin[2π( f10x1 + f20x2)]. The analytic signal with spectrum in the first 
quadrant is ψ1(x1,x2) = u − v + j(v1 + v2) = exp[j2π( f10x1 + f20x2)]. Its amplitude 
equals 2 and the phase ϕ(x1,x2) = 2π( f10x1 + f20x2).

This spectrum is complex, with two real terms and two imaginary terms. 
Assuming that the positive shift variables (a,b) are sufficiently large, we get 
a single quadrant spectrum of an analytic 2-D signal. Such a signal is called 
quasi-analytic (see Chapter 8). The shifted signal is a union of all four terms with 
regard to evenness or oddness. The formulae for these terms can be derived. 
However, they are lengthy and in implementations it is easier to use computer 
calculations. In Figure 5.4 2-D images illustrating this example are shown.
5.2.2  3-D Complex Analytic Signals
The 3-D real signal u(x1,x2,x3) can have eight terms with regard to evenness 
and oddness. The insertion of these terms in the 3-D Fourier transform

5.3  Hypercomplex n-D Analytic Signals
Hypercomplex n-D analytic signals are defined in exactly the same way as in 
the complex case; that is the boundary distributions of hypercomplex analytic 
functions. The difference is in the application of the algebra of hypercomplex 
numbers. Their single-orthant spectra are calculated in the form of a product 
of a single orthant operator (see (5.56)) and the spectrum is calculated using 
the hypercomplex version of the complex Fourier transform. The notion of 
the hypercomplex Fourier transform of a real n-D signal is not unique and 
depends on the choice of the algebra, for example, Cayley-Dickson or Clifford 
(see Chapter 2). As in the complex case, the starting point is the hypercomplex 
version of the Cauchy integral

This representation is not unique and depends of the algebra of multi-
plication of the imaginary units e1. In the case of the Cayley-Dickson algebra 
m = 2N–1, we have a sequence with subscripts 1, 2, 4, 8…, and in the case of 
the Clifford algebra we have a sequence with subscripts 1, 2, 3, 4,… . It should 
be noted that the signal domain definition of the n-D analytic signal in the 
form of (5.26) representing the n-fold convolution of a real signal u(x) with the

n-D complex delta distribution. Analogously, the n-D hypercomplex analytic 
signal is defined by the n-fold convolution of u(x) with the n-D hypercomplex 
delta distribution. The Cayley-Dickson version is

5.3.1  2-D Quaternion Signals
In 2-D, the difference between the Cayley-Dickson approach and the Clif-
ford approach is purely formal. The imaginary units e1, e2, e3 are replaced by 
e1, e2, (e12 = e1e2). The definition (5.75) defines a quaternion-valued analytic 
signal of the form
yq1 x1,x2

We get the following form of the quaternion analytic signal
	
yq1 x1,x2
(
) = u + e1v1 + e2v2 + e3v 	
(5.78)
where u, v1, v2, and v are the same functions as defined for the 2-D complex 
analytic signal, i.e., the original signal and its partial and total Hilbert trans-
forms (see (5.30) and (5.31)). The subscript q1 denotes that this signal has a 
quaternion single quadrant spectrum in the first quadrant. In Table 5.5, we 
see the signals with single quadrant spectra in all four quadrants and the cor-
responding frequency domain unit step operators (see (5.33)).

Because the 2-D signal is a real function, it can be inserted in front or 
at the end with no change of signs of the result. The insertion of u as a union 
of even and odd terms (see Chapter 3, (3.11)–(3.15)) and using the Cayley-
Dickson algebra (see the multiplication Table 2.2) presents the quaternion 
spectra Uq of four signals displayed in Table 5.6. In the first line, the operator 
with the single quadrant support in the first quadrant is shown. In the fol-
lowing lines, the spectra for next quadrants are shown. They are calculated 
directly by appropriate change of signs of the first quadrant operators. The 
same result yields the calculation of the involution.
The inverse QFT is

given by the norm of separable complex signals (see (5.42)).

The 3-D analytic signals are called octonions. Differently to the 2-D case we 
describe two kinds of octonions, one defined using the Cayley-Dickson alge-
bra (see Table 2.3) and the second using the Clifford algebra Cl03 (see Table 
2.4). Using the Cayley-Dickson approach, the signal domain definition of the

5.4  Monogenic 2-D Signals
The quaternion-valued hypercomplex signals have three imaginary terms 
defined by two partial Hilbert transforms and the total Hilbert transform. 
The monogenic 2-D hypercomplex signal has been proposed by Sommer and 
Felsberg [4] in the form
	
y M x1,x2
(
) = u x1,x2
(
) + e1vr1 x1,x2
(

where vr1 and vr2 are Riesz transforms of u:

It should be noted that, in the case of analytic and quaternion 2-D sig-
nals, the frequency domain operator has the form [1 + sgn( f1)][1 + sgn( f2)]. 
Figure 5.6 shows both operators.
Evidently, the monogenic operator is not a single quadrant operator. We 
observe that in the fourth quadrant it changes the sign. Asymptotically, in 
the first quadrant for large values of f1 and f2, it equals 3 while the operator 
(a) equals 4. The polar form of the monogenic signal is presented in Chapter 
7. The amplitude equals the norm of (5.84) and Felsberg and Sommer [4] 
defined two angles called orientation angle and phase angle. The energies

of two Riesz terms in (5.84) may differ. Their sum equals the energy of the 
real term u. Therefore, the energy of the monogenic signal equals two ener-
gies of the real term. Let us briefly discuss the term analytic signal, which 
was used by Felsberg and Sommer [4]. This term has been introduced to the 
signal theory by Gabor [5], who defined the notion of 1-D analytic signal. It 
should be noted that analytic signals are boundary distributions of analytic 
functions. These boundary distributions are defined by the Cauchy integrals 
(see (5.24)). However, Felsberg and Sommer [4] define the monogenic signal 
as a boundary 2-D distribution of a 3-D Laplace equation. Therefore, they use 
the term “analytic” defined differently from the analytic signals with single-
orthant spectra. The Riesz transform has been described by Larkin et al. [11], 
who use the phrase spiral phase quadrature transform.
Example 5.8
This example is a continuation of the Example 5.3 for the monogenic signal. Let

Using the relations
f (x)d( f −a) = f (a)d( f −a)  and  f (x)d( f + a) = f (−a)d( f + a)
we get

Evidently, the energies of the two imaginary terms are equal only for 
k = 1. However, the sum of the energies is independent of k and equal to the 
energy of the real term. This statement applies for any monogenic signal.
Example 5.9
This example presents the monogenic version of Example 5.4. The 2-D Gauss-
ian signal is given by (5.43), ρ = 0.8. The three terms of the monogenic signal 
are displayed in Figure 5.7.
In this example, the energies of the Riesz terms are equal (computer 
integration) and their sum equals the energy of the real signal u.
5.5  A Short Survey of the Notions of Analytic Signals with 
Single Orthant Spectra
In this chapter, we presented the definitions and properties of n-D complex 
and hypercomplex analytic signals with single orthant Fourier spectra. This 
summary recalls the basic properties of complex and hypercomplex analytic 
signals, including comments about the polar representation of these signals, 
which will be presented in detail in Chapter 7. The 2-D monogenic hyper-
complex signal is not a member of the family of analytic signals with single 
orthant spectra. We include this signal, bearing in mind its importance in 
signal processing.
1.	 All analytic signals with single orthant spectra have the form of an 
extension of the Gabor’s 1-D analytic signal to higher dimensions.

Figure 5.7  Continued
The Gabor’s analytic signal is the boundary distribution of the 1-D 
analytic function. In the signal domain, it is defined by a convolution 
of a real signal u with the 1-D complex delta distribution. In the fre-
quency domain, its spectrum is given by the product of the spectrum 
of u by a 1-D unit step distribution. The polar representation defines 
a single amplitude and single phase function (i.e., two functions (21)).
2.	 All higher dimensional complex analytic signals are defined in the signal 
domain by the convolution of the real signal u with the n-D complex 
delta distribution. It should be noted that this distribution has the 
form of a product of 1-D distributions (see (5.26)). Analogously, in 
the frequency domain, the spectrum of the complex analytic signal 
has the form of a product of the n-D spectrum of u by the n-D unit 
step distribution. Again, it has the form of a product of 1-D unit step 
distributions. The polar representation of n-D complex analytic signals 
defines 2n functions, 2n–1 amplitudes, and 2n–1 phase functions (see 
Chapter 7). The reconstruction of the real signal using the amplitude-
phase representation requires the knowledge of a half-space (and not 
a single orthant) spectrum.

120	
Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
3.	 All higher dimensional hypercomplex analytic signals are defined in the 
signal domain by the convolution of the real signal u with the n-D 
hypercomplex delta distribution. It should be noted that this distribu-
tion has the form of a product of 1-D distributions (see (5.75) and 
(5.76)). Analogously, in the frequency domain, the spectrum of the 
complex analytic signal has the form of a product of the n-D hyper-
complex spectrum of u by the n-D unit step distribution. Again, it 
has the form of a product of 1-D unit step distributions. It should 
be noted that the hypercomplex spectrum depends on the choice of 
the algebra of the hypercomplex numbers. The polar representation 
of the hypercomplex signals differs with regard to the complex case. 
The total number of functions is the same. However, in 2-D, the 
quaternion analytic signal is represented by a single amplitude and 
three phase functions. The real signal can be reconstructed using the 
knowledge of single quadrant spectrum. However, there are formulae 
enabling the calculation the amplitude and three quaternion phase 
functions starting with the two amplitudes and two phase functions 
of the complex representation. The exact polar representation of an 
octonion hypercomplex analytic signal is still unknown. An approxi-
mate solution defines a single amplitude and seven phase functions.
4.	 The monogenic 2-D quaternion hypercomplex signal has the form of a 
convolution of the real signal u with the monogenic delta distribution 
ψ δM = δ(x1,x2) + e1r1(x1,x2) + e2r2(x1,x2). Evidently, it is not a product 
of 1-D distributions. Its polar form defines a single amplitude and 
two phase functions. An extension of the monogenic signal to higher 
dimensions was not described in [4].
5.6  Survey of Application of n-D Analytic Signals
For technical reasons (volume), in this book we are not able to present a 
detailed description of applications. Instead, this survey is a guide to selected 
references describing applications.
5.6.1  Applications Presented in Other Chapters of this Book
In Chapter 9, we will describe Wigner distributions and ambiguity functions 
of analytic and monogenic signals.

5.6.2  Applications Described in Hahn’s Book on Hilbert Transforms
In [7], there are descriptions of the role of analytic signals in modulation theory, 
amplitude modulation, frequency modulation, single-sideband modulation, 
and compatible single-sideband modulation. An extension for 2-D signals 
in the form of single-quadrant modulation is presented. Various kinds of 
Hilbert filters are described in detail. Analytic signals are used to define the 
power of signals.
5.6.3  Selected Applications
Hypercomplex wavelets are described in [16] and [23]. The octonic repre-
sentation of electromagnetic fields is described in [19, 26] and field theory 
is described in [20, 26]. Applications in physics are numerous. For example, 
applications in relativistic quantum mechanics can be found in [21] and [22]. 
Olhede and Metikas described the notion of a homomorphic 1-D analytic 
signal [23]. The notion of entropy of analytic signals is introduced in [28]. 
Analytic waves are described by Vakman in [30, 31]. Applications in medicine 
(i.e., the processing of medical images) are presented in [18, 32].

Ranking of Analytic Signals
As shown in Chapters 4 and 5, the Fourier frequency support of an n-D com-
plex or hypercomplex analytic signal is limited to a single orthant. For example, 
for 3-D signals, this support is called an octant and for 2-D signals—a quad-
rant. For a given n-D real signal, the corresponding analytic signal is a union 
of 2n terms. For example, the octonion analytic signal (n = 3) is a union of 8 
terms: a real signal u and 7 various Hilbert transforms (6 partial and a total 
one). For n = 2 (quaternion analytic signals), we have a sum of four terms (see 
Appendix H, Hilbert quadruples).
Of course, the 1-D analytic signal is a union of two terms: the real sig-
nal and its Hilbert transform. Analyzing forms of complex and hypercompex 
analytic signals in 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D, we notice partially conjugate pairs of 
signals, which inspires us to introduce a kind of systematic (ranking/hierarchy) 
in the n-D frequency space.
The definition of ranking is simple. We assign to the analytic signal with 
a single orthant spectrum support the highest rank equal n; that is, for 3-D 
signals, the highest rank is 3, and for 2-D signals, it is 2. The lower rank signal 
is obtained by enlarging the frequency support joining two neighbor orthants 
(and forming a so-called suborthant), for example, two octants separated by a 
common plane or two quadrants separated by a common line.
In this chapter, it will be shown that the doubling of the frequency 
domain support reduces the number of terms. For n = 3, the signal of the 

126	
Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
highest rank has eight terms: the signals of rank 2 have four terms and the 
lowest rank (equal 1) only two terms, the same as the number of terms of the 
1-D Gabor’s analytic signal. The difference is that the lowering of rank reduces 
the number of terms with no change of signal dimensions. For example, for 
3-D signals, the signal of the lowest rank has the form ψ(x1,x2,x3) = u(x1,x2,x3) 
+ jH1(x1,x2,x3), where H1 denotes the partial Hilbert transform with regard 
to x1 as a consequence of the choice of the frequency domain support of the 
lowest rank signal in the half-plane f1. Regarding terminology, the use of the 
term ranking may be questioned. An alternative choice could be hierarchy.
6.1  Definition of a Suborthant
The orthant, as shown in Chapter 3, is a strictly determined part of the n-D 
frequency space [1, 2]. Evidently, this notion can be used in any n-D space.
Let us recall that in 1-D, the orthant is a half-axis. Therefore, in 1-D 
we have two (21) orthants: f > 0 and f < 0 (see Figure 6.1(a)). Further, the 2-D 
plane is divided into four (22) quadrants: ( f1 > 0,f2 > 0), ( f1 < 0,f2 > 0), ( f1 > 
0,f2 < 0), and ( f1 < 0,f2 < 0), numbered as shown in Figure 6.1(b). The 3-D 
space is modeled as a union of eight (23) octants:
f1 > 0, f2 > 0, f3 > 0
(
), f1 < 0, f2 > 0, f3 > 0
(
),
f1 > 0, f2 < 0, f3 > 0
(
), f1 < 0, f2 < 0, f3 > 0
(
),
f1 > 0, f2 > 0, f3 < 0
(
), f1 < 0, f2 > 0, f3 < 0
(
),
f1 > 0, f2 < 0, f3 < 0
(
), f1 < 0, f2 < 0, f3 < 0
(
)
labeled with 1, 2, …, 8 as shown in Figure 6.2. It should be noted that the 
orthant’s numbering differs from that which is commonly used by mathema-
ticians. For example in 2-D, the standard mathematical convention applies 
the numeration of quadrants as follows: No. 1. for ( f1 > 0,f2 > 0), No. 2. for 
( f1 < 0,f2 > 0), No. 3. for ( f1 < 0,f2 < 0), and No. 4 for ( f1 > 0,f2 < 0).
In this book, we apply the convention introduced by Hahn in [3] and 
used in all his further works concerning multidimensional analytic signals 
with single-orthant spectra [4–6]. The advantage of such a label is that all 
higher dimensional orthants in the half-space f1 > 0 are always odd-numbered. 
It should be noted that the same indexing applies for all analytic signals used 
in this book (see Chapter 5).

	
Ranking of Analytic Signals
127
Consider the n-D space, composed of 2n orthants. We assign the order 
1 to a single orthant of the n-D space. A family of suborthants of higher order 
is defined as follows:
A suborthant of order 2 is formed of two adjacent orthants of order 1 
having a common hyperplane. The number of suborthants of the second order 
is 2n/2 = 2n–1. Continuing, we define a suborthant of order 3 as a union of two 
adjacent second order suborthants with a common hyperplane. The number 
of the third order suborthants is 2n–2. The process is continued and finally we

128	
Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
get two suborthants of order n (i.e., two half-spaces ( f1 > 0,f2,…,fn) and ( f1 < 
0,f2,…,fn), each composed of two suborthants of order n − 1).
Let us illustrate the above notions in 2-D and 3-D for f1 > 0.
6.1.1  Subquadrants in 2-D
We call a subquadrant (1,3) (of order 2) in f1 > 0, a half-plane composed of 
two neighboring quadrants 1 and 3 (of order 1) (see Figure 6.3). They have a 
common half-line.
6.1.2  Suboctants in 3-D
In the half-space f1 > 0 of the 3-D space, a suboctant of order 2 is defined as 
a union of two adjacent octants of order 1 having a common half-plane (i.e., 
Figure 6.3  Subquadrant (1,3) in the half plane f1 > 0.

129
(1,5)–(3,7) as in Figure 6.4, or (1,3)–(5,7)). The suboctant of order 3 is the 
half-space f1 > 0.
6.2  Ranking of Complex Analytic Signals
Let us consider the n-dimensional signal space, x = (x1,x1,…,xn) is the n-D 
signal domain variable. Let R = n be the highest rank assigned to the n-D com-
plex analytic signal with a single-orthant spectrum. For example, for octonion 
signals, R = 3 and such a signal is a union of eight terms. We define lower rank 
n-D complex signals by applying the step-by-step procedure ending with a 
signal of rank R = 1. The lowest rank R signal always has two terms, just as the 
Gabor’s analytic signal. In the case of octonion signals, a signal of rank R = 2 
is a union of four terms, and a signal of rank R = 1 has only two components. 
The ranking procedure uses the notion of a suborthant introduced in Section 
6.1. It should be noted that only the number of terms is reduced and not the 
dimension of a signal. Let us study in detail cases n = 2 and n = 3.
6.2.1  Ranking of 2-D Complex Analytic Signals
Consider two complex analytic signals with single-quadrant spectra in the 
f1 > 0 plane (see Table 5.1 and Figure 6.1(b)):
	
y1 x1,x2
(
) = u x1,x2

) + v x1,x2
(
) + v1 x1,x2
(
) −v2 x1,x2
(
)
⎡⎣
⎤⎦⋅e1	 (6.2)
The rank of the above signals is R = 2. We define a 2-D complex signal 
of lower rank R = 1 as a mean value of signals ψ 1 and ψ 3 given by (6.1) and 
(6.2) as follows
	
y f1>0

) x1,x2
(
) = y1 + y3
2
= u x1,x2
(
) + v1 x1,x2
(
)⋅e1 	
(6.3)
The signal (6.3) is sometimes called a partial analytic signal [7]. The pro-
cess of ranking in the signal domain is illustrated in Figure 6.5. The signal 
(6.3) can equivalently be defined in the frequency domain as the inverse 2-D 
FT of a spectrum limited to the half-plane ( f1 > 0,f2) equals the subquadrant 
(1,3) (see Figure 6.6).

130	
Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
Example 6.1
Let us consider a 2-D real signal u(x1,x2) = cos(2πf10x1)cos(2πf20x2), f10,f20 > 
0 and its complex analytic signal of rank 2 given by

(
)
⎡⎣

(
)
⎡⎣
⎤⎦+ sin 2p f10x1 + f20x2
(
)
⎡⎣
⎤⎦⋅e1
It can equivalently be written in the form (6.1) with v(x1,x2) = sin(2πf10x1)
sin(2πf20x2), v1(x1,x2) = sin(2πf10x1)cos(2πf20x2), v2(x1,x2) = cos(2πf10x1)
sin(2πf20x2). The 2-D complex analytic signal with a spectrum in quadrant 3 
is ψ 3(x1,x2) = exp[e12π( f10x1 − f20x2)].

131
Then, a complex signal of rank R = 1 is ψ (f1>0)(x1,x2) = exp(e12πf10x1)
cos(2πf20x2). So, we see that ψ (f1>0)(x1,x2) has exactly the form (6.3), that is

(1.3) is given by the formula

6.2.2  Ranking of 3-D Complex Analytic Signals
Let us explain the process of ranking in 3-D. We recall the signal-domain 
definitions of 3-D complex analytic signals with spectra in f1 > 0 (see Chapter 
5, Table 5.4):
	
y1 x1,x2,x3
(
) = u −v12 −v13 −v23 + v1 + v2 + v3 −v

(6.6)
	
y7 x1,x2,x3
(
) = u + v12 + v13 −v23 + v1 −v2 −v3 −v
(
)⋅e1 	
(6.7)
The process of ranking of 3-D complex signals in the (x1,x2,x3)–domain 
is illustrated in Figure 6.7. We assign the highest rank R = 3 to all complex 
analytic signals ψi(x1,x2,x3), i = 1,3,5,7 given by (6.4)–(6.7). Then, we calculate 
a mean value (Step 1) of two 3-D analytic signals (having a frequency support 
in suboctants (1,5) and (3,7)) getting two signals of rank R = 2:
	
y(1,5) x1,x2,x3
(
) = y1 + y5

(6.9)

132	
Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
It should be noted that the structure of (6.8)–(6.9) is similar to (6.1) 
and (6.2), respectively. Continuing the ranking process (Step 2), we come to 
a 3-D complex signal of the lowest rank R = 1:
y f1>0
(
) x1,x2,x3
(
) =
y(1,5) + y(3,7)

(6.10)
having a structure similar to (6.4). As in the 2-D case, the equivalent 
process can be performed in the frequency domain as shown in Figure 6.8.

Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
We obtain the signal (6.10) as the 3-D inverse FT of a spectrum limited to a 
half-space ( f1 > 0,f2,f3) composed of two second-order suboctants (1,5) and 
(3,7).
Example 6.2
Let us consider the 3-D real signal u(x1,x2,x3) = cos(2πf10x1)cos(2πf20x2)
cos(2πf30x3), f10,f20,f30 > 0 and its 3-D analytic signal of rank 3 given by
y1 x1,x2,x3
(
) = exp e12p f10x1 + f20x2 + f30x3

To simplify the notation, let us substitute ωi = 2πfi0, i = 1,2,3. The above 
signal can equivalently be written in the form (6.4) with:

(

Examples 6.1 and 6.2 clearly visualize the procedure of ranking in 2-D 
and 3-D. We assemble all of the results in Table 6.1, showing the hierarchy 
of n-D complex analytic signals n = 1, 2, 3 of rank R ≤ n.
6.3  Ranking of Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
In this section, we apply the ranking procedure described in Section 6.2 to 
construct n-D hypercomplex signals of rank R < n. The ranking of quaternion 
and octonion analytic signal will end with exactly the same result as in case 
of complex analytic signals.
Similarly as above, let R = n be the highest rank assigned to the n-D 
Cayley-Dickson analytic signals with a single-orthant spectrum support. Let 
us start from the simplest case of quaternion analytic signals (n = 2) and then 
pass to octonion analytic signals (n = 3).

All of the above analytic signals have rank R = 2 and form partially 
conjugate pairs. We define two 2-D signals of rank R = 1 by calculating the 
mean value of signals with spectra in the subquadrant (1,3)

Let us consider a 2-D real signal u(x1,x2) = cos(2πf10x1)cos(2πf20x2) and its (total 
and partial) Hilbert transforms: v(x1,x2) = sin(2πf10x1)sin(2πf20x2), v1(x1,x2) = 
sin(2πf10x1)cos(2πf20x2), v2(x1,x2) = cos(2πf10x1)sin(2πf20x2).
The quaternion analytic signals of rank 2 are given by (6.11)–(6.12). To 
simplify the notation, let us write: ci = cos(ω ixi), si = sin(ω ixi), i = 1,2.

once again equivalence of complex and hypercomplex approaches. We will 
show that this conclusion can be generalized to higher dimensional Cayley-
Dickson analytic signals.
6.3.2  Ranking of 3-D Cayley-Dickson Analytic Signals
In this section, we will show that the ranking process of 3-D Cayley-Dickson 
(octonion) analytic signals will give the same exact result as for the 3-D com-
plex analytic signals shown in Section 6.2.2.
The octonion analytic signals of the highest rank R = 3 (see Table 5.7, 
Chapter 5) are given by


(6.17)
The 3-D Cayley-Dickson signals of rank R = 2 are derived as the mean 
value of corresponding signals of rank 3 given by (6.14), (6.16), and (6.15), 
(6.17), respectively

We see that the above signals have a quaternion structure similar to 
(6.11) and (6.12). Finally, the 3-D signal of rank 1 (of a complex form) is a 
mean of (6.18) and (6.19):

Let us use the simplified notation: ci = cos(ω ixi), si = sin(ω ixi), i = 1,2,3. 
The octonion analytic signals of rank 3 are given by (6.14)–(6.17). Using (6.18) 
and (6.19), we obtain signals of rank 2:

again the equivalence of both the complex and hypercomplex approach. To 
synthesize obtained results, we collected them in Table 6.2, showing forms of 
n-D hypercomplex analytic signals n = 1, 2, 3 of rank R ≤ n for signals from 
Examples 6.3 and 6.4.
6.4  Summary
In this chapter, we discussed the idea of lower-rank n-D analytic signals. The 
process of ranking is based on enlarging the support of the spectrum by forma-
tion suborthants of n-D space, in form of a union of two neighboring (adja-
cent) orthants (see Section 6.1). The inverse Fourier transform of the enlarged 
spectrum yields an n-D analytic signal with half the components. The lowest 
rank R signal has always two terms, just as the Gabor’s analytic signal. For 
n > 2, the step-by-step ranking procedure produces more than one lower rank 
signal because there are different options in creating suborthants. The results 
obtained in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 can be generalized to the n-D case:
	
y f1>0
(
)(x) = u(x) + jv1(x)	
(6.21)
	
y f1<0
(
)(x) = u(x) −jv1(x)	
(6.22)
So, we see that the n-dimensional complex and hypercomplex analytic 
signals of rank R = 1 are always n-D complex signals with the real part u(x) and 
the imaginary part in form of the partial Hilbert transform v1(x) of u, [1, 2].

Polar Representation of Analytic 
Signals
7.1  Introduction
This chapter presents polar representation of complex and hypercomplex ana-
lytic signals. For a given real n-D signal u(x), the corresponding complex analy­
tic signal has the form ψ(x) = Re(x) + e1Im(x). Its polar form is ψ(x) = A(x)
exp[e1φ(x)], where A(x) = 
Reψ (x)
[
]
2 + Imψ (x)
[
]
2
 and Tan[φ(x)] = Im[ψ(x)]/ 
Re[ψ(x)]. The capital T denotes the multibranch tangent function. In the case 
of 1-D time signals: A(t) = 
Reψ (t)
[
]
2 + Imψ (t)
[
]
2  and Tan[φ(t)] = Im[ψ(t)]/
Re[ψ(t)]. The real signal can be reconstructed form its polar form using the 
relation u(t) = A(t)cos[φ(t)].
Why, therefore, do we need the polar form?
Firstly, this form enables the definitions of instantaneous amplitude, 
instantaneous phase, and the instantaneous frequency of a signal. Secondly, 
in specific n-D applications (for example, in medical imaging), it is possible 
to extract some features not directly observable in the real signal. The polar 
form of hypercomplex signals differs from the polar form of complex signals. 
Sections 7.4 and 7.5 will show that the complex and hypercomplex polar rep-
resentations are equivalent. There are closed formulae enabling the calculation 
of amplitudes and the phase functions of complex and hypercomplex signals. 

144	
Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
The amplitudes and phase functions in the complex case are uniquely defined 
for any dimensions. However, the reconstruction needs a calculation of n/2 
amplitudes and n/2 phase functions. The hypercomplex polar representation 
for n = 3 (octonions) is known only approximately and is unknown for n = 
4 (sedenions). Details are presented in Sections 7.5.1 and 7.5.2. It should be 
noted that the Fourier spectrum of a real signal may be a complex function. 
The polar form of this spectrum also defines the amplitude and phase func-
tions [14]. This problem is not described in this book.
7.2  Polar Representation of Complex Numbers
Consider a complex number z0 = x0 + y0 · e1 (we use the notation e1 and not 
the commonly used j). The polar form of this number is
	
z0 = x0 + y0 ⋅e1 = z0 ee1arg z0 = z0 ee1j 	
(7.1)
where the absolute value
	
z0 = A0 =
x0
2 + y0
2 	
(7.2)
is called an amplitude and the argument,
	
arg z0
( ) = j = atan2 y0,x0
(
) 	
(7.3)
is an angle. The notation (7.1) defines a static (nonrotating) phasor in the form 
of a scaled line attached to the origin of the (x,y)-plane and ending with an 
arrow at the point (x0,y0). The natural logarithm of (7.1),
	
Ln z0
( ) = ln z0 + j ⋅e1 = A0 + j ⋅e1 	
(7.4)
defines the complex amplitude. In electrical engineering, the phasor is a com-
plex number representing a sinusoidal (harmonic) function whose amplitude 
A, angular frequency ω = 2πf and initial phase ϕ are time-invariant.
7.3  Polar Representation of 1-D Analytic Signals
Consider the Gabor’s 1-D analytic signal ψ(t) = u(t) + v(t) · e1, where v(t) = 
H[u(t)] is the Hilbert transform of u. Let us recall, that the Hilbert transform 

	
Polar Representation of Analytic Signals
145
is the only one satisfying the Vakman’s three conditions: the amplitude con-
tinuity, phase independence of scale and harmonic correspondence [15, 16].
The polar form of the analytic signal is represented by a phasor rotating 
counterclockwise as shown in Figure 7.1.
The formula
	
y(t) = u(t) + v(t)⋅e1 = A(t)exp e1j(t)
⎡⎣
⎤⎦	
(7.5)
defines the instantaneous amplitude
	
A(t) =
u2(t) + v2(t) 	
(7.6)
and
	
j(t) = atan2 v(t),u(t)
(
) 	
(7.7)
defines the instantaneous phase. The logarithm of the analytic signal (7.5) 
defines the instantaneous complex phase [7, 8]
	
Φc(t) = Ln y(t)
[
] = Ln A(t)
[
]+ j(t)	
(7.8)
The capital L denotes the multibranch character of the logarithm of 
a complex function. The time derivative of the complex phase defines the 
instantaneous complex frequency:
	
s(t) = d

]
{
} =

+ dj(t)

⋅e1 = a(t) + w(t)⋅e1	 (7.9)
The function α(t) is called the instantaneous radial velocity (a measure of 
the time change of the amplitude) and ω(t) is the instantaneous angular velocity 
Figure 7.1  The rotating phasor of length A(t) and angular frequency (velocity) ω(t).

146	
Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
(the phasor rotates with a variable in time angular velocity). It can be written 
in the form (dots over u and v define corresponding time derivatives d/dt):
	
w(t) = d
dt atan2 v(t),u(t)
[
] = u(t)!v(t) −v(t)!u(t)
u2(t) + v2(t)
	
(7.10)
The instantaneous frequency is
	
f (t) = w(t)
2p 	
(7.11)
In conclusion, we have defined the notions of the instantaneous ampli-
tude, instantaneous phase, and instantaneous frequency of the Gabor’s ana-
lytic signal. Note that no definition is true or false. We simply agree to apply 
a specific name to the defined quantity. The aforementioned quantities are 
uniquely defined as properties of the Gabor’s analytic signal. Cohen, Loughlin, 
and Vakman [3] believed that the notions of instantaneous amplitude and 
frequency are not unique. Hahn indicated that the Gabor’s analytic signal 
defines uniquely the above notions [13].
In terms of the polar representation, the real signal and its Hilbert trans-
form have the form
	
u(t) = A(t)cos j(t)
[
],  v(t) = A(t)sin j(t)
[
]	
(7.12)
Example 7.1
The Gabor’s 1-D analytic signal has a representation in the form of a con-
volution of the real signal with the complex delta distribution (see Chapter 
5, (5.11)). The approximating function of the complex delta distribution is 
(Chapter 5, (5.12))

function of the sampling theory (see 7.7 in [10]).
	
y(t) = sin(at)

(7.21)
and the instantaneous complex angular frequency
	
s(t) = a

148	
Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
In conclusion, the interpolating function is a signal with variable ampli-
tude and a constant angular frequency.
Example 7.3
The classic representation of a frequency modulated harmonic carrier is [10]
	
y FM (t) = A0 exp e1 ω0t + Φ0 + j(t)
⎡⎣
⎤⎦
{
},   Ω0 = 2pf0 	
(7.23)
where φ(t) represents the angle modulation of the carrier f0. This signal is not 
an analytic signal since real and imaginary parts do not form a Hilbert pair. 
However, for large values of the carrier frequency it is nearly analytic (quasi-
analytic) (see Chapter 8).
7.3.1  Representation of the Instantaneous Complex Frequency using 
the Wigner Distribution
The time-frequency Wigner distribution W(t,f ) of analytic signals is described 
in Chapter 9. Let us show formulae defining terms of the instantaneous 
complex frequency using moments of the Wigner distribution. The spectral 
moments have the form
	
mn(t) =
wnW (t, f )
−∞

∫
df 	
(7.24)
The instantaneous amplitude is uniquely defined by the zero order 
moment m0(t) = A2(t). The terms of the instantaneous complex frequency are
	
a t( ) =
!m0(t)
2m0(t),   w(t) = m1(t)
m0(t);   !m0 = dm0/dt

The 2-D complex signals with single quadrant spectra are represented by two 
amplitudes and two phase functions [9]. Due to the Hermitian symmetry 
(see Chapter 5, Table 5.2), we have a pair of analytic signals with spectra in 
the first and third quadrant. These quadrants form the half-plane f1 > 0. The 
two analytic signals are

7.4.1.1  The Case of 2-D Separable Real Signals
The 2-D real signal is a separable function if it is a product of 1-D functions of 
the form u(x1,x2) = g1(x1)g2(x2). The total Hilbert transform is v(x1,x2) = h1(x1)
h2(x2) and the partial Hilbert transforms of such a signal is v1(x1,x2) = h1(x1)
g2(x2), v2(x1,x2) = g1(x1)h2(x2), where h denotes a 1-D Hilbert transform of g. 
These formulae show that for separable signals d2 = 0 and both amplitudes 
(7.30) and (7.31) have the same value. The polar 1-D representations of 1-D 
analytic signals ψ g1(x1) = g1(x1) + h1(x1) · e1 = a1(x1)exp[e1α 1(x1)] and ψ g2(x2) = 
g2(x2) + h2(x2) · e1 = a2(x2)exp[e1α 2(x2)] show that the two phase angles (7.32) 
and (7.33) for separable signals have the form
	
j1 x1,x2
(
) = a1 x1
( ) + a2 x2
(
),  j2 x1,x2
(
) = a1 x1
( ) −a2 x2
(
) 	 (7.36)
Evidently, for separable signals, the quaternion phase angles are given 
by the sum and difference of the complex phase angles.
7.4.2  2-D Hypercomplex Quaternion Analytic Signals with Single-

7.4.3  Relations between the Analytic and Quaternion 2-D Phase 
Functions
The polar form of the analytic 2-D signals with single-quadrant spectra is 
represented by two amplitudes and two phase functions. The 2-D quaternion 
signal is represented by a single amplitude and three phase functions. The fol-
lowing formulae enable calculation of the quaternion representation starting 
with the complex one [4]. We have

7.4.3.1  The Case of Separable Real Signals
For separable real signals, the polar representations of the complex and qua-
ternion signals are both represented by a single amplitude Aq and two phase 
functions. The insertion of (7.35) into (7.45) yields
	
f1 x1,x2
(
) = a1 x1
( ),  f2 x1,x2
(

(

(7.46)

Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
Note that the two amplitudes (7.35) can be written in the form
	
A1 x1,x2
(
) = Aq 1+ sin 2f3
(

(

(

and
	
Aq x1,x2
(

(7.48)
The above reasoning shows that the complex and quaternion representa-
tion is a matter of choice of the researchers, since both methods are equivalent 
(see discussion in Chapter 11).
7.4.4  Polar Representation of the Monogenic 2-D Signal
The monogenic 2-D hypercomplex signal has the form (see Chapter 5, (5.84))
	
y M x1,x2
(
) = u x1,x2
(
) + vr1 x1,x2
(
)⋅e1 + vr2 x1,x2
(
)⋅e2 	
(7.49)
The spherical representation (Figure 7.2) defines the amplitude
	
AM x1,x2
(
) =
u2 + vr1
2 + vr2
2 	
(7.50)
and two angles Φ and Θ. Cohen, Loughlin, and Vakman [3] called the first 
one the orientation angle given by
	
Φ x1,x2
(
) = atan2 vr2,vr1
(
) 	
(7.51)

) = arccos
u
AM
⎛
⎝⎜
⎞
⎠⎟= atan2
vr1
2 + vr2
2 ,u
(
)	
(7.52)
In terms of the polar representation, the monogenic signal has the form
y M x1,x2
(
) = AM cos(Θ) + sin(Θ)cos(Φ)e1 + sin(Θ)sin(Φ)e2
⎡⎣
⎤⎦	
(7.53)
Note that the reconstruction of u (first term in the above formula) 
requires knowledge of only the orientation angle since
	
u x1,x2
(
) = AM cos(Θ) 	
(7.54)
Evidently, the polar representation of the monogenic signal differs from 
the polar representation of the quaternion signal. The relations between both 
representations are actually unknown. Differently, the relations between com-
plex and quaternion polar representations are described in Section 7.4.3.
7.4.5  Common Examples for 2-D Polar Representations of Analytic, 
Quaternion, and Monogenic Signals
Example 7.4
Consider the real signal u(x1,x2) = cos(ω 10x1 + ω 20x2) (see Chapter 5, Example 
5.3). The total Hilbert transform is v = −u and the two partial HTs are equal 
v1 = v2 = sin(ω 10x1 + ω 20x2). The insertion into (7.26) and (7.27) yields
y1 = u −v + v1 + v2
(
)⋅e1 = 2cos w10x1 + w20x2
(
) + 2sin w10x1 + w20x2
(
)⋅e1
= 2exp e1 w10x1 + w20x2
(
)
⎡⎣
⎤⎦
y3 = u + v + v1 −v2
(
)⋅e1 = 0
Evidently, the amplitude A1 = 2 and A2 = 0. The complex and quater-
nion phase functions are the same. The monogenic signal (see Chapter 5, 
Example 5.8) is
y M x1,x2
(
) = cos 2p f10x1 + f20x2

tions (see (7.34), (7.44), and (7.54); see also Figures 7.5, 7.7, and 7.9).

Hilbert transform of gi): ψ g1(x1) = g1(x1) + e1h1(x1) = a1ee1α1, ψ g2(x2) = g2(x2) + 
e1h2(x2) = a2ee1α2, and ψ g3(x3) = g3(x3) + e1h3(x3) = a3ee1α3. Elementary multipli-

The exact polar representation of this signal is unknown. Let us recall 
that in the 2-D case, there are exact formulae enabling the calculation of 
a single amplitude and three phase function of a quaternion starting with 
two amplitudes and two phase functions of the 2-D complex representation. 
The derivation is using a formula for the tangent of a sum of two angles. 
A similar formula of the tangent of a sum of four angles contains a formi-
dable number of terms. The quaternion amplitudes and phases are defined 
using the Rodriquez matrix (7.40). No such matrix is known for octonions. 
Hahn and Snopek [12] proposed an approximate solution of the problem 
using similarities with the 2-D case and some arbitrary assumptions. The 
proposed polar form of (7.65) is

We have a single amplitude and seven phase functions. The term with 
the angle ϕ 7 is located arbitrarily at the center. The amplitude is the same as 
given by (7.62)

Recapitulating, our goal is to deduce the seven phase functions in (7.66) 
denoted ϕ i starting with four amplitudes Ai and four phase functions φ i 
defined by (7.59) and (7.60). Using analogies to the 2-D case, the seven phase 
functions form two groups. The members of the first group are unions of four 
phase functions as follows

Computer calculations have shown that only the first term is significant 
and the calculation using all terms in (7.70) almost do not change the result.
7.5.2.1  The Case of Separable Real Signals (see Section 7.4.1.1)
In the case of 3-D separable real signals, their octonion polar notation is con-
siderably simplified. Because all four amplitudes are equal, the phase angles of 
the second group are all equal to zero. The four phase angles of the first group 
are given by insertion of (7.63) into (7.68) yielding ϕ 1 = α 1, ϕ 2 = α 3, ϕ 4 = α 2, 
and ϕ 5 = 0. In consequence, we get a polar representation exactly of the same 
form as in the 3-D complex case. They differ only by the imaginary units.

This fact validates strongly the deduced (7.68) and (7.69). Of course, 
(7.71) is not an approximation. The real signal can be recovered in terms of 
the above polar representation using urec = A0cos(α 1)cos(α 2)cos(α 3).

We applied all variances σ i = 1 and all correlation coefficients ρ ij = 0.8. We 
will display the original real signal and its reconstructed versions using in the 
complex case (7.61) and in the octonion case (7.70). The amplitude and phase 
functions are obtained by using the real and imaginary parts of the complex 
signals calculated by the inverse Fourier transform of their spectra. The recon-
struction in the case of the complex signal is perfect and in the case of the 
octonion signal nearly perfect. This gives evidence, that the equations for the 
octonion phase functions have been correctly deduced.

Quasi-Analytic Signals
8.1  Definition of a Quasi-Analytic Signal
The theory of analytic signals with single orthant spectra [3] is presented in 
Chapter 5. The frequency domain space Rn is a union of 2n orthants. However, 
due to the Hermitian symmetry of the complex single-orthant spectra, the real 
n-D signal u(x) can be reconstructed using knowledge of 2n–1 analytic signals 
with single orthant spectra located in a half-frequency space f1 > 0 (see Chapter 
5). This statement does not apply for quasi-analytic signals. The support of the 
spectrum of a quasi-analytic signal is only approximately located in a single 
orthant, in 1-D—in a half-axis, in 2-D—in a single quadrant.
Consider a real n-D signal u(x) and its complex Fourier spectrum U(f ). 
The multiplication of the real signal by the n-D carrier represented here by 
a the product of n exponentials, shifts the spectrum towards a single first 
orthant (i.e., R)

If the value of ε « 1, the shifted signal is called quasi-analytic. If ε = 
0, the shift is perfect and the signal is analytic. Note that if all frequencies 
of the carrier are positive, we get a single quasi-analytic (or analytic) signal. 
In principle, the carrier in (8.1) could be a hypercomplex function of the 
form ee12πf

xn. However, because we define a signal with a 
single-orthant spectrum the use of the hypercomplex version seems to have 
no advantage. Bearing this in mind, in the remainder of this chapter, we will 
use the notation j instead of e1.
8.2  The 1-D Quasi-Analytic Signals
The notion of a quasi-analytic signal applies for modulated harmonic carri-
ers. The complex form of this carrier is: ψ c(t) = A0ej(2πf0t+ϕ0). In the following, 
we assume a normalized amplitude A0 = 1. Note that the carrier is itself an 
analytic signal. Any kind of modulation of this carrier—for example ampli-
tude-, phase-, or frequency-modulation—can be represented by a product of 
a modulation function and a carrier [2–4]:
	
y(t) = g(t)e jf0e j2pf0t = g m(t)e j2pf0t 	
(8.3)
where γ(t) is called the modulation function and γ m(t) is called the modified 
modulation function (including the carrier’s phase). The carrier’s phase plays 
a role by addition of two modulated signals and is relative with regard to the 
choice of the origin of the time scale. In the following we assume a carrier 
phase of zero, that is ϕ 0 = 0.
Consider a real signal x(t), which should be transmitted by modulation. 
We have a Fourier pair x(t)⇔
F
X( f ) . The modulation function is a function 
of x(t): γ(t) = γ[x(t)]. We have a new Fourier pair

The above spectrum may be called the spectrum of the modulated signal 
at zero carrier frequency. This is a two-sided spectrum with one part at posi-
tive frequencies and another part at negative frequencies. The part at negative

frequencies represents the lower sideband of the modulated signal. The part 
at positive frequencies represents the upper sideband The multiplication with 
the analytic carrier shifts the spectrum of the modulation function towards 
positive frequencies. The analytic carrier and its spectrum are:

(8.6)
The shifted signal may be quasi-analytic if the shift is imperfect (still 
some energy at negative frequencies). Otherwise it is analytic. Equation (8.2) 
under these conditions takes the form

8.3  Phase Signals
The polar form of the analytic signal is ψ(t) = A(t)ejφ(t) (see Chapter 7). The 
phase signal has the form ψ(t) = A0ejφ(t), that is, the amplitude is a time-
independent constant. However, not every phase signal is analytic. This is 
because, in general, the Hilbert transform of the real part H[cosφ(t)] is not 
equal to sinφ(t). A nonanalytic phase signal multiplied by the carrier ejΩ0t is 
converted to a quasi-analytic signal with a negligible leakage of its spectrum 
into the negative frequency range. A good example is the familiar FM signal 
shown in Example 8.3.
Let us derive a special class of analytic phase signals starting with a 
complex function of a complex variable z = t + jτ of the form
	
y(z) =
z −zk
z −zk
∗= y1(z)y2(z)⋅⋅⋅y N (z)
k=1
N
∏
	
(8.13)
where the coefficients zk = α k + jβ k are complex constants. In the following, it 
is convenient to write the kth term of the product given by (8.13) in the form
	
yk(t) = z −ak + jbk
(
)
z −ak −jbk
(
)
= uk(t,t) + jvk(t,t)	
(8.14)
of an analytic function satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann equations (see Chap-
ter 3). The function ψ(z) given by (8.14) is analytic as a product of analytic 
functions. In the limit for τ → 0+, we get the following analytic phase signal
	
yk(t) = uk(t) + jvk(t) = 1−!uk(t) + jvk(t)	
(8.15)
The signal ũk(t) is called the finite energy part of the signal uk(t) = 1 − ũk(t). 
Notice that the Hilbert transforms H[uk(t)] = H[1 − ũk(t)] = H[−ũk(t)] are equal 
because H[1] = 0. The evaluation of the real and imaginary parts of (8.15) yields

We recognize a pair of negated Cauchy Hilbert transforms (see Appendix 
G) multiplied by 2β k and shifted in time by α k. The calculation of the polar 
form shows that the amplitude of ψ k(t) equals 1 and the calculation of the 
phase functions shows that

It should also be noted that the instantaneous angular frequency of the 
phase signal ω(t) = dφ k(t)/dt equals twice the instantaneous frequency of the 
Cauchy signal ῶ(t) = dφ̃k(t)/dt. The phase signals ψ k(t) are noncausal and can 
be made nearly causal using a large value of the time shift constant α k, if α k > 
0. The total analytic phase signal defined by (8.14) can be written in the form
	
y(t) = 1 e j j1(t)+j2(t)+!+jN (t)
⎡⎣
⎤⎦	
(8.18)
with the amplitude A(t) = 1 for all t. Let Γ(f ) = F{ψ(t)} be the Fourier trans-
form of the phase signal and Γk(f ) = F{ψ k(t)} the transform of the kth term. 
Due to the multiplication-to-convolution theorem (see Appendix A) we get
	
Γ( f ) = Γ1( f )∗Γ2( f )∗!∗ΓN ( f )	
(8.19)
All terms Γk(f ) and the spectrum Γ(f ) are one-sided being the spectra 
of analytic signals. Since ψ(t) is a rational function, it can be expanded in

8.4  The n-D Quasi-Analytic Signals
The n-D quasi-analytic signals are defined in exactly the same way as in the 
1-D case. Consider the n-D low-pass signal and its spectrum

U( f ),  x = x1,x2,…,xn
(
),  f =
f1, f2,…, fn
(
) 	
(8.24)
The quasi-analytic signal is defined by multiplication of u by the n-D 
harmonic complex (or hypercomplex) carrier. The complex carrier is
	
yc(x) = e j2pf10x1e j2pf20x2 ×…× e j2pfn0xn =

∏
	
(8.26)
The algebra of the imaginary units ei should be defined. It should be 
noted that the spectrum of the complex and hypercomplex carriers is the 
same. Of course, the spectrum of the complex carrier is given by the complex 
n-D Fourier transform and the hypercomplex one by a hypercomplex Fourier 
transform. In both cases, we have

Equations (8.25) and (8.26) define quasi-analytic signals if the value of 
the shift frequencies is sufficiently high enough to keep the leakage parameter 
(8.2) small. Observe that in both cases, we have a single quasi-analytic signal 
with single orthant spectrum. For this reason, there is no advantage for apply-
ing the hypercomplex version with regard to the complex one.

the corresponding quaternion Fourier spectrum is a complex function.

Space-Frequency Representations 
of n-D Complex and Hypercomplex 
Analytic Signals
In this chapter, we recall notions of the Wigner distribution (WD) and the 
corresponding Woodward’s ambiguity function (AF) called space-frequency 
representations of n-D signals. Section 9.1 is devoted to WDs and AFs of 
complex signals (including analytic signals). In Section 9.2, the corresponding 
space-frequency distributions of quaternion and monogenic analytic signals 
are described. In Section 9.3 we present the idea of double-dimensional distri-
butions introduced by Hahn and Snopek in 2002. Section 9.4 presents a short 
description of some practical applications of WDs and AFs in the domain of 
signal processing.
9.1  Wigner Distributions and Woodward Ambiguity 
Functions of Complex Analytic Signals
The Wigner distribution of n-D complex functions was introduced into quan-
tum mechanics in 1932 by the American physicist of Hungarian origin, Eugene 

188	
Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
Paul Wigner [1]. Originally, the Wigner distribution was defined as a 2n-D 
function of positions and velocities of elementary particles in n-D space. In 
1948, Jean Ville redefined the WD for the 1-D Gabor’s analytic signal, and 
this distribution is often referred to as the Wigner-Ville distribution [2]. Some 
important works concerning the study of properties of WDs of continuous- 
and discrete-time complex signals appeared in the 1980s [3–5]. The detailed 
description of different time-frequency distributions belonging to the Cohen’s 
class is presented in [6]. Research concerning space-frequency representation 
of n-D complex analytic signals with single-orthant spectra [7] is the subject 
of [8–12].
Let us consider the n-D complex signal ψ(x), x = (x1,x2,…,xn) and its 
complex FT Ψ(f ), f = ( f1,f2,…,fn). We introduce the n-D shift variable χ = 
(χ 1,χ 2,…,χ n) in the x-domain (signal domain) and define the 2n-D signal 
correlation product as a function

Let us recall the definitions of 2n-D AF of n-D complex signals intro-
duced by Snopek in 1999 [13] and further exploited in [14, 15]. The 2n-D AF 
is defined as the n-D inverse Fourier transform of the correlation product (9.1) 
calculated with regard to the signal-domain variable x = (x1,…,xn):
inverse 2n-D FT:
 Ay(m, c) = … r(x, c)

It is a function of the n-D frequency shift variable (frequency lag) μ and the 
n-D signal shift variable (signal-domain lag) χ.
Similar to the 2n-D WD, the 2n-D AF can be defined equivalently in 
the frequency domain as the n-D Fourier transform of (9.3) with regard to f:

It should be noted that there is a closed relation between the 2n-D WDs

The formulas (9.9) show that the 2n-D WD and 2n-D AF form a pair 
of Fourier transforms are presented schematically in Figure 9.1. Solid arrows 
represent direct and inverse n-D Fourier transforms F(·) with regard to the 
n-D variable in the subscript. So, Fχ is the Fourier relation (9.2) between the 
signal-domain correlation product (9.1) and the 2n-D WD. Then, Fμ defined 
the n-D Fourier relation (9.5) between the frequency-domain correlation 
product (9.3) and the WD given by (9.5). Fx and Ff represent the Fourier rela-
tions (9.6) and (9.7), respectively. The dotted arrows represent 2n-D Fourier

Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
9.1.1  WDs and AFs of 1-D Signals
Consider a 1-D real or complex signal ψ(t), t ∈ R, and its 1-D complex Fou-
rier transform Ψ(f ), f ∈ R. We introduce two shift variables: τ in the time 
domain (time lag), and μ in the frequency domain (frequency lag).
The time-frequency Wigner distribution of ψ, Wψ(t,f ), is defined as the 
Fourier transform (with regard to τ) of the time-domain correlation product
	
r(t,t) = y(t + t/2)y∗(t −t/2) 	
(9.10)
Hence, we have
	
direct FT:
Wy(t, f ) =
r(t,t)e−j2pft dt
∫
inverse FT:
r(t,t) = Wψ (t, f )e j2pft df
∫
	
(9.11)
It should be noted that the WD of a real or complex signal ψ(t) is always a 
real valued function. Equivalently, the WD is defined in the frequency domain 
as the inverse FT of the frequency-domain correlation product
	
R(m, f ) = Ψ f + m/2

(9.14)
Let us show the equivalence of definitions (9.11) and (9.14).
Proof: We substitute in (9.11): t + τ/2 = α and get
Wy(t, f ) = 2e j4pft y(a)y∗(2t −a)e−j4pfa da
∫
Then, bearing in mind that a FT of a product of two signals is a con-
volution of the corresponding spectra and y∗(2t −a)⇔
Fa Ψ∗(2 f )e−j4p(2 f )t , 
we obtain
Wy(t, f ) = 2e j4pft Ψ(2 f )∗Ψ∗(2 f )e−j4p(2 f )t
⎡⎣
⎤⎦
= 2e j4pft Ψ(b)Ψ∗(2 f −b)e−j4p(2 f −b)t d b
∫
Substituting in the above equation β = f + μ/2, we get the definition 
(9.14).
The Wigner distribution is closely related to the Woodward’s ambigu-
ity function Aψ(μ,τ), which is commonly used in radar and sonar imaging to 
track the distance and velocity of a moving object [16]. The AF is defined in 
two equivalent ways: as the inverse FT (with regard to t) of (9.10) and the FT 
(with regard to f ) of (9.12), as follows
	
inverse FT:
Ay(m,t) =
r(t,t)e j2pmt dt
∫
direct FT:
r(t,t) =
Ay(m,t)e j2pmt dm

(9.15)
	
direct FT:
Ay(m,t) =
R(m, f )e−j2pf t df
∫
inverse FT:
R(m, f ) =
Ay(m,t)e j2pf t dt
∫
	
(9.16)

192	
Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
Note that the formula (9.15) defines the AF in symmetrical form [17] and 
that the original Woodward’s definition applies a different sign in the exponent 
[16]. The AF of a real or complex signal ψ(t) can be a complex valued function. 
Bearing in mind (9.11), (9.14), (9.15), and (9.16), we can derive the following 
2-D Fourier relations between WD and AF

(9.17)
For even signals, ψ(t) = ψ(−t), we get
	
Ay(m,t) = 1
2Wy(t/2,m/2) 	
(9.18)
and for odd signals, ψ(t) = −ψ(−t):
	
Ay(m,t) = −1

Figure 9.2 shows Fourier relations between time- and frequency-domain 
correlation products, the 2-D Wigner distribution, and the 2-D Woodward’s 
ambiguity function. Solid arrows represent direct and inverse 1-D Fourier 
transforms with regard to the variable in the subscript. So, Fτ is the Fourier 
relation (9.11) between the time-domain correlation product (9.10) and the 
WD. Then, Fμ defines the Fourier relation between the frequency-domain 
Figure 9.2  Fourier relations between correlation products, 2-D WDs and AFs. Fτ is the 
direct FT of (9.11), Fμ is the inverse FT of (9.14), Ft is the inverse FT of (9.15), and Ff is the

9.1.1.1  Auto- and Cross-Terms of WDs and AFs
The WDs and AFs are quadratic (nonlinear) transformations of a signal. These 
nonlinear functions also produce—besides a number of autoterms—unwanted 
cross-terms, which can make the analysis difficult.
Cross-Terms Reduction
There are a lot of different methods of reduction of unwanted cross-terms in 
Wigner distributions. They were introduced to signal processing in the 1990s

and concerned only 1-D signals. The most important works in this field are [17, 
25, 26]. The first step in all methods is to replace a real signal in (9.11) with the 
corresponding analytic signal [2, 35]. Because the analytic signal has a one-
sided spectrum support, its WD is also one-sided, and there are no cross-terms 
resulting from the interaction between spectrum components at positive and 
negative frequencies. The next step is to introduce in (9.11) a specific kernel 
function. This idea was used in time-domain and frequency-domain pseudo-
Wigner distributions and in smoothed pseudo-Wigner distributions [3, 17].

The number of autoterms is k and the number of cross-terms is k(k − 1)/2. 
Let us illustrate this problem with some examples.
Consider a multicomponent signal ψ(t) in the form of a sum of ψ i(t) = 
u(t − ti)ej2πfit, i = 1, …, k (i.e., time-shifted and modulated signals u(t)) [20]. Its 
WD contains k autoterms centered at (ti,fi) and, for each pair of autoterms, a 
cross-term is situated midway between them (compare with Figure 9.3 for a 
bicomponent signal). Correspondingly, in the AF, all autoterms are focused in 
the center of the (μ,τ)-plane, while the cross-terms are mirrored with regard 
to the origin (0,0) (as in Figure 9.4 for a bicomponent signal).
We start with a simple cosine signal of frequency f0, cos(2πf0t) and its 
analytic form ej2πf0t.
Example 9.1  Cosine and Harmonic Exponential (Analytic) Signals
Consider the real signal u(t) = cos(2πf0t) = ½(ej2πf0t + e–j2πf0t). Its WD is given 
by Wu(t,f ) = ¼[1(t) ⊗ δ( f − f0) + 1(t) ⊗ δ( f + f0) + 2cos(4πf0t)δ(f )] (the symbol

⊗ denotes the multiplication of distributions). Figure 9.5(a) shows Wu(t,f ) for 
f0 = 10. We have two autoterms in the form of delta planes at f = ±10 and a 
cosine modulated cross-term at zero frequency. If we replace u with its analytic 
form ψ(t) = ej2πf0t, we get the WD in the form of a single delta plane Wu(t,f ) 
= 1(t) ⊗ δ( f − f0), f0 = 10 (Figure 9.5(b)). There are no cross-terms.
The next example is a generalized version of Example 9.1.

cosine cross-term in the form of a plane at the mid-frequency fm = (f1 + f2)/2. 
The frequency of the cosine is f2 − f1. We have

The 4-D Wigner distribution of a 2-D complex signal ψ(x1,x2) is a 4-D real-
valued function given by the 2-D FT with regard to χ = (χ 1,χ 2) (compare 
with (9.2)):

Whereas the 4-D WD is real-valued, the 4-D AF can be a complex-
valued function.
Example 9.4  The 2-D Complex Harmonic Signal
Let us consider the 2-D complex signal ψ(x1,x2) = ej2π(fax1+fbx2). Its WD is a 
real 4-D function given by Wψ(x1,x2,f1,f2) = 1(x1,x2) ⊗ δ( f1 − fa,f2 − fb) where 
1(x1,x2) is a unit distribution equal to 1 for all x = (x1,x2).
The AF of ψ(x1,x2) is Aψ(μ1,μ2,χ1,χ2) = ej2π(faχ1+fbχ2) · δ(μ1,μ2) ⊗ 1(χ1,χ2) 
where 1(χ 1,χ 2) is a unit distribution equal to 1 for all χ = (χ 1,χ 2). We see that 
the AF is in general a complex function.

Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
Chosen Properties of 4-D WDs and AFs
The properties presented in this section are generalizations of the properties 
of time-frequency distributions collected in Tables 9.1 and 9.2. Let us enu-
merate some of them:
1.	 The 4-D WD is always a real valued function, while the correspond-
ing 4-D AF is in general complex.
2.	 A shift of a 2-D signal in the signal domain by a vector [xa,xb] leads 
to the same shift of its WD:
	
y x1 −xa,x2 −xb
(
)↔
WD
Wy x1 −xa,x2 −xb, f1, f2
(
) 	
(9.30)
3.	 A shift of a 2-D signal in the signal domain by a vector [xa,xb] leads 
to the frequency modulation of its AF with regard to (μ 1,μ 2):
	
y x1 −xa,x2 −xb
(
)↔
AF
Ay m1,m2,c1,c2
(

(

4.	 A modulation of a 2-D signal leads to the frequency-shift of its 4-D 
WD:
	
y x1,x2
(
)e j2p fax1+ fbx2
(
)↔
WD
Wy x1,x2, f1 −fa, f2 −fb
(

(9.32)
5.	 A modulation of a 2-D signal leads to the frequency-shift of its 4-D 
AF with regard to (χ 1,χ 2):

(

9.	 The 4-D WD preserves the signal- and frequency-domain supports 
of a signal. The WD of a single-quadrant analytic signal has a single-
quadrant support in the frequency domain.
10.	 The 4-D WDs and AFs of separable signals ψ(x1,x2) = ψ a(x1)ψ b(x2) 
are also separable.
9.1.3  WDs and AFs of 2-D Complex Analytic Signals
Since WDs of 2-D signals are 4-D functions, we can study their properties 
using suitable cross sections. For example, for fixed signal coordinates x1 = x10 
and x2 = x20, the cross section Wψ(x10,x20,f1,f2) represents the local spectrum of 
the signal. Alternatively, choosing f1 = f10 and f2 = f20, we get another cross sec-
tion Wψ(x1,x2,f10,f20). It is possible to analyze mixed cross sections of the form 
Wψ(x10,x2,f10,f2), Wψ(x1,x20,f1,f20), and so on. The same applies for 4-D AFs.
9.1.3.1  WDs of 2-D Complex Analytic Signals
Bearing in mind item 9 from the preceding subsection, we can formulate the 
following property concerning cross sections of the 4-D WD:
Any cross section of the 4-D Wigner distribution of a 2-D analytic signal has a 
single-quadrant support.
Let us illustrate this property with cross sections Wψ1(0,0,f1,f2) and Wψ3(0,0,f1,f2) 
of the 4-D WDs of an analytic separable Cauchy signal and a 2-D modulated 
real band-pass signal with a Gaussian envelope (a quasi-analytic signal).

Wψ3(0,0,f1,f2) for a = 0.25, b = 0.5. We observe the single-quadrant support 
of corresponding cross sections and their identical shape (a consequence of 
separability of the signal). Note that, in the nonseparable case, both cross sec-
tions would differ in shape but the single-quadrant support is still conserved.

The distribution Wψ3 shown is a mirror image of Wψ1 with regard to the

This is a consequence of the fact that 4-D WDs and AFs are pairs of Fourier 
transforms (see (9.29)). We exploit the property concerning the single-quadrant 
support of the WD of analytic signals (see Section 9.1.3.1) and rewrite (9.29) as

Functions of Quaternion and Monogenic Signals
9.2.1  The WDs of Quaternion Signals
In [28], the definition of the 4-D Wigner distribution of 2-D quaternion sig-
nals was introduced. The Quaternion Wigner Distribution Wq is defined as a 
two-sided QFT (with regard to χ = (χ1,χ2)) of a quaternion correlation product:
rq x1,x2,c1,c2
(
) = yq x1 + c1

that is,

e−e12pf1c1rq x1,x2,c1,c2
(
)e−e22pf2c2 d c
∫∫
	
(9.52)
It should be noted that it is also possible to define the Quaternion WD using 
the right-side QFT or left-side QFT of ρ q (see Chapter 4, (4.50)). However, in 
the following sections we will keep the original definition [28]. The insertion 
of ψ q1(x1,x2) = u + v1 · e1 + v2 · e2 + v · e3 (Chapter 5, (5.78)) and its conjugate 
ψ ∗q1(x1,x2) = u − v1 · e1 − v2 · e2 − v · e3 into (9.52) yields
	
ρq x1,x2,χ1,χ2

Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
It is known that, in general, the WDs of quaternion signals are qua-
ternion-valued functions. Differently, the cross section Wq(0,0,f1,f2) is a real 
function, since exp(e14πf11x10) = 1 (see Figure 9.14). Moreover, it has a two-
quadrant support. We also observe a pair of bipolar cross-terms situated along 
the line f1 = 0. Differently, the cross section Wq(1/12,0,f1,f2), f1 = 1.5 is a 
complex-valued function. Its real parts, the e1–part and the magnitude, are 
shown in Figure 9.15(a)–(c).
Example 9.9 Sum of Two Band-Pass Signals with a Gaussian Envelope
Figure 9.16 shows the real-valued cross section Wq(0,0,f1,f2) of the quaternion 
analytic signal (9.59), A1 = A2 = 1, f11 = f12 = 1.5. We observe a union of the 
WDs of Figure 9.10 and two groups of cross-terms of opposite polarity.
Figure 9.17(a)–(d) shows that Wq(1/12,1/24,f1,f2) is a quaternion-valued 
function with all terms defined by (9.55)–(9.58). Its magnitude (Figure 9.18) 
corresponds to the absolute value of the cross section from Figure 9.17(a).
9.2.2  AFs of Quaternion Signals
The quaternion AF is defined as the inverse QFT of the correlation product 
(9.51) with regard to the signal variables x = (x1,x2) [15, 28]:

In general, the Aq is a quaternion-valued function. As the correlation 
product ρ q is a 2-D inverse QFT of Wq given by (9.54), we derive the qua-
ternion version of the relation between WD and AF. The substitution of the 
inverse 2-D QFT of (9.54) into (9.61) yields

Of course, other definitions of the quaternion AF are possible. If we 
change the signs in exponents of (9.61), we get the symmetric form of the two-
sided quaternion AF. Other conventions are possible to apply as for example 
the left-side or right-side QFT (similarly to the quaternion WD described in 
Section 9.2.1).
Figure 9.19 displays magnitudes of two different cross sections of Aq of 
a quaternion quasi-analytic signal (9.59). We observe that |Aq(μ 1,μ 2,0,0)| is a 
sum of |A1(μ 1,μ 2,0,0)| and |A3(μ 1,μ 2,0,0)| (see Figure 9.13(a) and (b), respec-
tively). This summation yields the autoterm in the origin of a crest value four 
times bigger with regard to the cross-terms, which are located in all four 
quadrants and have the same crest value, as the cross-terms of |A1(μ 1,μ 2,0,0)|

and |A3(μ 1,μ 2,0,0)|. The previously described summation is expected bearing 
in mind, that the quaternion signal ψ q replaces two analytic signals ψ 1 and 
ψ 3. Note that cross sections with nonzero shift coordinates (χ 1,χ 2) (Figure 
9.19(b)) have a more complicated structure than |Aq(μ 1,μ 2,0,0)|.

the two-sided QFT of (9.63)

and the same applies for vr1 and vr2. The WM is also a quaternion-valued func-
tion. In contrast to Wq, the imaginary terms of cross sections WM(0,0,f1,f2) may 
not vanish, except in the case of distributions of selected band-pass signals.

and Q2(x1,x2) has a form analogous to (9.67) if we change f11 → f21 and 
f12 → f22. Figure 9.20 shows the cross section WM(0,0,f1,f2) as a real-valued 
function containing the same spectral information as Wq of Figure 9.16. 
However, logons exist in all four quadrants and the cross-terms are also dupli-
cated in some places. The cross section WM(1/12,1/12,f1,f2) (Figure 9.21) is a 
quaternion-valued function with the magnitude corresponding to Figure 9.20.
9.2.4  AFs of Monogenic Signals
The 4-D AF of monogenic signals is a function of frequency-lag and spatial-
lag variables (µ 1, µ 2, χ 1, χ 2). It is given by the inverse QFT of the correlation 
product (9.63) with regard to spatial variables x = (x1,x2). We have
	
AM (m, c) =
e−e12pm1x1rM x1,x2,c1,c2

(9.68)
and AM is a quaternion-valued function [15, 28]. The relation (9.63) holds also 
for AM and WM.
Figure 9.22 displays the magnitudes of two different cross sections 
|AM(μ 1,μ 2,0,0)| and |AM(μ 1,μ 2,0.1,0.1)| of the monogenic signal (9.66). Dif-
ferently to the magnitude |Aq(μ1,μ2,0,0)| shown in Figure 9.19(a), the function 
|AM(μ1,μ2,0,0)| contains duplicates of the cross-terms shifted horizontally and

values of the shift variables) the crest values of cross-terms are enhanced with 
regard to the autoterm and change the support from circular to elliptical shape.

9.3  Double-Dimensional Wigner Distributions
In 2002, the new notions of double-dimensional distributions were proposed 
[30–32]. The idea was simple. First, we calculated the 2-D WD of a given 1-D 
(analytic) signal as in (9.11). Second, we used the so-obtained WD function as 
a new 2-D signal and again calculated its 4-D WD or 4-D AF. (Figure 9.23). 
This operation doubled the dimensionality and that is why these distributions 
are called double-dimensional. This notion is close to the quartic distributions 
defined by O’Neill and Williams in [33] and [34]. Let us recall some basic 
theoretical results concerning double-dimensional distributions. The details 
are to be found in [31].
The double-dimensional Wigner distribution WW
(2)(t,f,μ,τ) is defined in 
the form
WW

   =

known as the O’Neill-Flandrin formula is

that is, the two distributions differ only in amplitude. The Wigner distribution 
of the AF is given by

have a single cross-term situated between the autoterms. Figure 9.24(b) shows

where all Ai = 1, σ 1 = 1/ 2p , t1 = −2, t2 = 2, t3 = −2, t4 = 2 and f1 = f2 = 2, 
f3 = f4 = 5. We observe four autocomponents centered at (−2,2), (2,2), (−2,5), 
and (2,5) of the time-frequency plane and six cross-components (two central 
cross-terms are superimposed).
The advantage of using WW
(2) instead of the WD can be shown for the 
real chirp signal u(t) = sin(at + bt2), a = π, b = π. Figure 9.25(a) presents the 
cross section WW
(2)(t,f,0,0) of this signal and Figure 9.25(b) shows its Wigner 
distribution Wu(t,f ). We see that both differ only in amplitude, but in WW
(2), 
the cross-terms are visibly reduced in comparison to the WD.
The methods of reduction of unwanted cross-terms in double-dimen-
sional distributions have been proposed in [32] in the form of so called double-
dimensional pseudo-Wigner distributions.
9.4  Applications of Space-Frequency Distributions in 
Signal Processing
The 2-D Wigner distribution and Woodward’s ambiguity function are basic 
tools for time-frequency analysis of nonstationary real and complex signals 
[17, 20, 21, 25, 35–37]. The WD serves as a basis of the Cohen’s class time-
frequency distributions [6] largely applied in various fields of signal processing 
as, for example, in underwater acoustics [38], radar imaging and seismology 
[39–42], biomedicine [43], mechanical engineering [44], and so on.
Let us briefly present two fields of applications of space-frequency dis-
tributions: noise analysis and image processing, in which the authors of this 
book have made also a small contribution.
9.4.1  Wigner Distribution in Noise Analysis
Noise analysis is a very interesting area of stochastic signal processing, also 
exploiting the time-frequency approach. It should be noted that—in the case 
of random signals—we have to distinguish the WD of a single sample function 

228	
Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
(realization), ψ(t), from the ensemble averages E{Wψ(t,f )}, where E is the 
ensemble average operator. Their properties are different. The WD of a single 
realization of a random process (i.e., a sample of Gaussian noise) has the form 
of a bipolar random field, whereas the ensemble average of the WD, E{Wψ(t,f )}, 
is a well-defined deterministic function [45–47].
Figure 9.25  The real chirp signal: (a) Wu(t,f), (b) WW
(2)(t,f,0,0).

Space-Frequency Representations of n-D Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
229
Example 9.13  WD of a Low-Pass Gaussian Noise
Figure 9.26(a) shows the WD of a single sample of a low-pass stationary Gauss-
ian noise in the form of a random field with a limited (low-pass) frequency 
support. Figure 9.26(b) displays the slice at t = 20 of the ensemble average of 
two thousand of WDs. The solid line represents the average of autoterms and 
dotted line represents the average of cross-terms decreasing with the growing 
number of realizations.
Now, if we consider a deterministic signal ψ(t) contaminated by zero-
mean real stationary noise n(t), that is, a sum
	
x(t) = y(t) + n(t) 	
(9.82)
we know that its WD is (compare with (9.20))
	
Wx(t, f ) = Wy(t, f ) +Wn(t, f ) +Wyn(t, f ) +Wny(t, f ) 	
(9.83)
The ensemble average of (9.83) gives
E Wx(t, f )
{
} = Wy(t, f ) + E Wn(t, f )
{
} + E Wyn(t, f )
{
} + E Wny(t, f )
{
}  

(9.84)
where E{Wn(t,f )} = Sn(f ) is a noise power density function and E{Wψn(t,f )} = 
E{Wnψ(t,f )} = 0(see, for example, [48]). Finally,
	
E Wx(t, f )
{
} = Wy(t, f ) + Sn( f ) 	
(9.85)
We see that the averaging process E{Wξ(t,f )} with a theoretically infinite 
number of realizations gets the WD of the deterministic signal ψ(t) with a 
constant component equal to the noise power density.
Example 9.14  Cosine Signal Embedded in Gaussian Noise
Figure 9.27(a) shows the WD of a single realization of the deterministic 
signal u(t) = cos(2πf0t), f0 = 20 embedded in Gaussian noise. Figure 9.27(b) 
displays the result of an averaging process with 1000 realizations. We see the 
autoterm at f = 20 and a cross-term at zero frequency. Let us mention that we 
used the analytic signal approach (Wigner-Ville distribution) in simulations.

9.4.2  Wigner Distribution in Image Processing
Real images have a nonstationary structure that makes use of space-frequency 
distributions very promising. It seems that the first who considered use of the 
WD in image analysis were Jacobsen and Wechsler [50]. However, in compari-
son to a wide range of various applications of time-frequency distributions in 
1-D signal processing (given in Section 9.4.1), the number of publications is 
rather limited. A good description of some applications of the WD in image 
processing is given in [50]. Some examples of the use of spatial-frequency 
distributions in texture segmentation can be found in [51–54]. In the domain 
of image watermarking, the Radon-Wigner distribution (a projection of the 
2-D WD) is applied [55].
Applications of spatial-frequency distributions of complex and hyper-
complex analytic signals in image processing are relatively rare. In [56], Hahn 
and Snopek analyzed individual cross sections of 4-D WDs of test signals and 
showed that it is possible to extract a 2-D image from a 2-D random noise 
field (Figure 9.28). In 2013, Liu and Goutte proposed to apply the quaternion 
WD in hyperspectral imagery [57].

Causality of Signals
This chapter presents the definition of causality of multidimensional real sig-
nals. Causality of 1-D time signals implies that any response of a system at 
time t depends only on excitation at an earlier time. A transfer function of a 
causal and linear time-invariant system is an analytic function of frequency 
(Kramers-Kronig relations). A multidimensional real signal is called causal 
if its support is limited to R+. Multidimensional causal signals have analytic 
spectra. This yields the extension of Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations.
10.1  Kramers-Kronig Relations
All physical systems are causal. The response of the system to an input signal 
cannot appear earlier than the excitation. For example, the response to a very 
short input pulse applied at the time t never appears earlier. The response g(t) 
for the input δ(t) pulse called the impulse response equals zero for t < 0. There-
fore, the response is a one-sided function in the time domain. Let us recall 
that 1-D analytic signals have one-sided spectra in the frequency domain. 
Consequently, due to the duality property of the Fourier transformation, 
all responses of a physically realizable system have analytic spectra. In order 
to show details, let us recall the notion of a transfer function of a linear time 
invariant system (LTI). It is the Fourier transform of the impulse response g(t)

defined by the quotient of the output steady state harmonic analytic signal 
ψ output(t) = A2ej(2πft+φ2) to the input steady state signal ψ input(t) = A1ej(2πft+φ1):
	
Γ( f ) = A2e j 2pft

A1e j 2pft+j1
(
) = A2
A1
e j j2−j1
(
) = A( f ) + jB( f )	
(10.1)
In this chapter, we will deal only with complex functions using the nota-
tion j and not e1. The one-sided impulse response g(t) can be decomposed into 
a sum of noncausal even and odd parts (see Chapter 3, (3.9)): g(t) = ge(t) + go(t). 
Because g(t) is a real function we have the following Fourier pairs:
	
ge(t) = 0.5 g(t) + g(−t)
⎡⎣
⎤⎦⇔
F
A( f )
go(t) = 0.5 g(t) −g(−t)
⎡⎣
⎤⎦⇔
F
B( f )
	
(10.2)
The causality of g(t) yields the relations
	
go(t) = sgn(t)ge(t)
ge(t) = sgn(t)go(t)
	
(10.3)
Therefore, the impulse response can be written in the form
	
g(t) = ge(t) 1+ sgn(t)
(
) 	
(10.4)
that is, it is uniquely defined by the even part. The terms of (10.1) are defined 
by the Fourier transforms
	
ge(t)⇔
F
A( f ), sgn(t)ge(t)⇔
F −j
pf ∗A( f ) = −jH A( f )
⎡⎣
⎤⎦	
(10.5)
The insertion in (10.4) yields the following form of the Kramers-Kronig 
dispersion relations [4, 5] (the term dispersion is used in optics)
	
Γ( f ) = A( f ) −jH A( f )
⎡⎣
⎤⎦	
(10.6)
The real and imaginary parts of the transfer function of a causal system 
are forming a pair of Hilbert transforms. In the next paragraph, it will be 
shown that a similar form applies for n-D causal signals. Equation (10.5) can 
be rewritten in the form

Γ( f ) = A( f )∗d( f ) −j 1

⎡
⎣⎢
⎤
⎦⎥	
(10.7)
The term in parenthesis is the dual form of the complex delta distribu-
tion (see Chapter 5, (5.11)). Note the conjugate form with regard to the time 
domain version.
Example 10.1
Let us present a simple example. The transfer function of a low-pass RC filter 
is (τ = RC)
Γ( f ) =
1
1+ j2pf t =
1
1+ (2pf t)2 −j
2pf t
1+ (2pf t)2 = A( f ) −jH A( f )
⎡⎣
⎤⎦
Evidently, the real and imaginary parts are forming a pair of Hilbert 
transforms. The impulse response is g t( ) = 1
t 0.5 + 0.5sgn(t)
[
]e−t/t . We have
ge(t) = 1

go(t) = 1
2t sgn(t)e−t/t ⇔

B( f ) = −1
2t ⋅1
pf ∗A( f )
In this example, the unit step 1(t) = 0.5 + 0.5 sgn(t) is also a one-sided 
function. Its even part equals 0.5 and the odd part is 0.5sgn(t). The corre-
sponding Fourier transform of 1(t) is
Γ( f ) = 1
2 d( f ) −j 1
2pf = A( f ) −jH A( f )
⎡⎣
⎤⎦
Note that the real and imaginary parts of the complex delta distribution 
are also a pair of Hilbert transforms.
10.2  Extension of the Notion of Causality to Higher 
Dimensions
In the previous section, we presented the Kramers-Kronig relations, which 
show that for causal signals (causal impulse response), the real and imagi-
nary parts of corresponding spectra (transfer functions) are a pair of Hilbert 

244

transforms. Let us present the extension of the notion of causality to n-D 
signals proposed briefly in [2] and later with more details in [3]. Recall that 
no definition is true or false. The presented definition is based on the duality 
between n-D analytic signals with single-orthant spectra and signals with 
single-orthant support in the signal domain. It will be shown that we get the 
direct extension of Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations. Let us introduce the 
following definition of causality of n-D signals. 
Consider a real signal g(x), where x = (x1,x1,…,xn) are Cartesian coordi-
nates of a n-D space. The n-D real signal g(x) is called causal if its support is 
limited to R+, that is, to a single space-orthant (x1 > 0,x2 > 0,…,xn > 0).
10.2.1  Derivation of the Dispersion Relations
A real n-D signal can be decomposed into a sum of 2n terms with regard to 
evenness and oddness (see Chapter 3). However, for causal signals all terms 
are given by the formula (see (10.4))
	
g(x) = gee…e(x)
1+ sgn xi
( )
⎡⎣
⎤⎦
i=1
i=n
∏
	
(10.8)
The n terms are all uniquely defined by the even term. For example, in 
2-D, we have four terms given by (an example is shown in Figure 10.2).
g x1,x2
(
) = gee x1,x2
(
) 1+ sgnx1
(
) 1+ sgnx2
(
) = gee 1+ s1 + s2 + s1s2
(
)	
(10.9)
where si = sgn x1. The n-D extension of Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations 
is given by the Fourier transform of (10.9). In 2-D, we get 
	
Γ f1, f2
(
) = G f1, f2
(
) −H[G]−j H1[G]+ H2[G]
(
) 	
(10.10)
This is the dual form of the analytic 2-D signal (see Chapter 5, (5.28)). 
Notations: H = the total Hilbert transform, H1 and H2 = partial Hilbert 
transforms. Using the iteration property of Hilbert transforms (see Appendix 
F) we have
	
H1[Re] = H1 H1[G]+ H2[G]
⎡⎣
⎤⎦= −G + H[G] = −Re 	
(10.11)
	
H2[Re] = H2 H1[G]+ H2[G]
⎡⎣
⎤⎦= −G + H[G] = −Re 	
(10.12)

	
Causality of Signals
245
The result of this operation is the same using H1 or H2. Using these 
relations the extension of Kramers-Kronig relations has the form
	
Γ f1, f2
(
) = Re−j ⋅Hi[Re];  free choice i = 1 or 2 	
(10.13)
The same relation applies for higher dimensions with free choice of i 
from 1 to n. In terms of the complex delta distribution, we have the dual form 
of (5.27) (see Chapter 5):
	
Γ( f ) = G( f )
d fi
( ) −j 1
pfi
⎡
⎣⎢
⎤
⎦⎥

(10.14)
The notion of the causality of 2-D and higher dimensional signals does 
not have the same physical sense as 1-D time signals. It only has the system-
theoretical sense. This statement does not exclude applications. For example, 
an image with a rectangular frame can be made causal by a proper choice 
of the center of the Cartesian coordinates (Figure 10.1) The polar form may 
define the frequency domain amplitude and phase functions.
Example 10.2
Figure 10.2 shows a causal 2-D rectangular function g(x1,x2) = 1 inside the 
support 0 < x1 < 1, 0 < x2 < 1. The even-even term equals 0.25 for −1 < x1 < 1 
and −1 < x2 < 1. The Fourier transform of this function is

10.3  Summary
By definition, an n-D signal is called causal, if its support is limited to a single 
orthant in the signal space x denoted with R+. Using the duality of the theory 
of analytic signals with single-orthant spectra, the spectrum of a causal signal 
is analytic (a boundary distribution of an analytic function). Let us recall that, 
in the case of signals with single-orthant spectra, the real signal can be recon-
structed by knowledge of 2n–1 analytic signals. A causal signal is, by definition, 
a signal with a single-orthant support in the x-domain. Therefore, we have 
a single Fourier spectrum which defines the dispersion relations. Equations 
(10.8) and (10.14) define a single Fourier pair

The authors of this book present the above equations for historical rea-
sons. The paper [6] is dated 1980, while the theory of signals with single-
orthant spectra is dated 1992. Nieto-Vesperinas did not use the term Hilbert 
transform and the notion of causality. The above equations have been reprinted 
by Fiddy [1] (with some typos).

Summary
Complex or hypercomplex? This is the question.
This question can sometimes arise if we analyze or process n-dimensional sig-
nals. The authors do not give the direct answer to this question. The content 
of this book presents both approaches. The reader has a choice to apply in his 
studies the complex or hypercomplex approach or eventually both, and decide 
which has more advantages in solving a specific problem.
The starting point in writing this book was Hahn’s previous book [1]. 
In [1], the reader will find a description of properties of n-D complex analytic 
signals defined in 1992 in the Proceedings of IEEE [2]. In [1], Hahn presented 
the extension of the notion of Gabor’s analytic signal [3] to higher dimen-
sions. However, the content of this book correlates weakly with the content 
of [1]. Basic knowledge about complex n-D analytic signals is repeated and 
considerably enlarged in [4]. All descriptions of hypercomplex signals are new, 
and to a large extent, are included in Snopek’s papers [5, 6]. Specifically, the 
reader will find a large survey of hypercomplex algebra with many tables and a 
comparison of complex and hypercomplex Fourier transformations. Chapters 
presenting the notion of ranking of analytic signals and of quasi-analytic sig-
nals are new. A large survey of Wigner distributions and ambiguity functions 
of analytic signals is presented in Chapter 9 in this book. The description of 
the polar forms of complex and hypercomplex analytic signals are to a large 

250	
Complex and Hypercomplex Analytic Signals
extent new [4]. For 1-D signals, much information included in [1] could not 
be repeated in this book. 
Knowledge about the hypercomplex analytic signals is relatively new. 
The quaternion analytic signal, including its polar representation, has been 
described by Bülow and Sommer in [7] and [8]. Shortly thereafter, Thomas 
Bülow visited Professor Hahn; Bülow believed that the quaternion analytic 
signal is superior with regard to its complex version because it can be recon-
structed from a single quaternion signal in comparison to two 2-D complex 
signals. Professor Hahn pointed out that the number of functions of the polar 
representation is the same in the complex case (two amplitudes and two phase 
functions) and in the quaternion case (a single amplitude and three phase 
functions). Moreover, there are closed formulae enabling calculation of the 
quaternion set starting with the complex set (see Chapter 7). In the case of real 
2-D separable signals (a product of 1-D signals), in both cases the polar form of 
the complex and quaternion signals defines a single amplitude and two phase. 
The 3-D real signal is represented by four complex analytic signals. The 
polar form of these signals defines four amplitudes and four phase functions. 
The corresponding hypercomplex analytic signal has the form of an octonion 
function. Its polar form defines a single amplitude (the norm of the octonion) 
and seven phase functions. The exact relations between the four amplitudes 
and four phase functions of the complex case and the single amplitude and 
seven phase functions of the octonion are unknown. However, approximate 
relations are described in [4] (details in Chapter 7). 
Again, for separable 3-D real signals the polar form in both cases defines 
a single amplitude and three phase functions. The complex signals with single-
orthant spectra can be defined for any dimension. The hypercomplex analytic 
signal representing a 4-D real signal has the form of a sedenion. Its polar form 
is unknown. Readers will find the definition of the monogenic signal described 
in the paper of Felsberg and Sommer [9] and in Chapter 5 of this book. Its 
Wigner distributions are described in Chapter 9. Evidently, the support of 
the spectrum of the monogenic signal is not restricted to a single quadrant. 
In writing this book, the authors have been unable to include every-
thing they might have wished due to the constraints on the number of pages 
available for print. Many applications can be found in the list of references 
of successive chapters, such as the controversy about the uniqueness of the 
notion of the instantaneous amplitude and phase defined by Gabor’s analytic 
signal described in [10]. In conclusion, we believe that this book is the first 
presenting in a single-volume theoretical background of n-D complex and 
hypercomplex analytic signals. 

	
Summary
251
This book is a common work of both authors. The content has been 
designed by both authors. Stefan Hahn is the author of Chapters 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 
and 10. Kajetana Snopek is the author of Chapters 2, 4, 6, and 9. Each author 
served as a reviewer for chapters written by the other. The authors believe that 
their intellectual contributions are equal.

2-D Hilbert Quadruples
The Hilbert quadruple is formed by the real signal u(x1,x2), the partial Hilbert 
transform with regard to x1 denoted v1(x1,x2), the partial Hilbert transform 
with regard to x2 denoted v2(x1,x2), and the total Hilbert transform wiht regard 
to both variables denoted v(x1,x2). All are functions of (x1,x2). Below, they are 
denoted as u, v1, v2 and v.

Quadruples can be analogously derived using Table H.1.
Hilbert quadruples of interpolatory  expansion of a raster of 2-D samples 
a(i1,i2).
−N1 ≤i1 ≤N1,−N2 ≤i2 ≤N2
The expansion assumes sampling in a rectangular raster with periods ∆1 along 
the axis x1 and ∆2 along the axis x2. Notations:
X1 = 2pW1 x1 −i1Δ1
(
), X2 = 2pW2 x2 −i2Δ2
(
)
W1 and W2 are the cutoff frequencies of the 2-D lowpass spectral window.
