INTRODUCTION
You must be familiar with the units used in electronics and
know how to express electrical quantities in various ways
using metric prefixes. Scientific notation and engineering no-
tation are indispensable tools whether you use a computer, a
calculator, or do computations the old-fashioned way.
When you work with electricity,
you must always consider safety
first. Safety notes remind you of
the importance of safety and pro-
vide tips for a safe workplace.

QUANTITIES AND UNITS
Fundamental and Derived Units
The SI system is based on seven fundamental units (sometimes called base units) and two
supplementary units. All measurements can be expressed as some combination of funda-
mental and supplementary units. Table 1 lists the fundamental units, and Table 2 lists 
the supplementary units.
The fundamental electrical unit, the ampere, is the unit for electrical current. Current is
abbreviated with the letter I (for intensity) and uses the symbol A (for ampere). The ampere
is unique in that it uses the fundamental unit of time (t) in its definition (second). All other
electrical and magnetic units (such as voltage, power, and magnetic flux) use various com-
binations of fundamental units in their definitions and are called derived units.
For example, the derived unit of voltage, which is the volt (V), is defined in terms of
fundamental units as 
As you can see, this combination of fundamental
units is very cumbersome and impractical. Therefore, volt is used as the derived unit.

UNITS OF MEASUREMENT
In the 19th century, the principal weight and measurement units dealt with commerce.
As technology advanced, scientists and engineers saw the need for international stan-
dard measurement units. In 1875, at a conference called by the French, representatives
from eighteen nations signed a treaty that established international standards. Today,
all engineering and scientific work use an improved international system of units, Le
Système International d’Unités, abbreviated SI*.
After completing this section, you should be able to

QUANTITIES AND UNITS
Letter symbols are used to represent both quantities and their units. One symbol is used
to represent the name of the quantity, and another symbol is used to represent the unit of
measurement of that quantity. For example, italic P stands for power, and nonitalic
W stands for watt, which is the unit of power. Another example is voltage, where the same
letter stands for both the quantity and its unit. Italic V represents voltage and nonitalic
V represents volt, which is the unit of voltage. As a rule, italic letters stand for the quantity
and nonitalic (roman) letters represent the unit of that quantity.
Table 3 lists the most important electrical quantities, along with their derived SI 
units and symbols. Table 4 lists magnetic quantities, along with their derived SI units 
and symbols.

In addition to the common electrical units shown in Table 3, the SI system has many
other units that are defined in terms of certain fundamental units. In 1954, by interna-
tional agreement, meter, kilogram, second, ampere, degree Kelvin, and candela were
adopted as the basic SI units (degree Kelvin was later changed to just kelvin). These units
form the basis of the mks (for meter-kilogram-second) units that are used for derived
quantities and have become the preferred units for nearly all scientific and engineering
work. An older metric system, called the cgs system, was based on the centimeter, gram,
and second as fundamental units. There are still a number of units in common use based
on the cgs system; for example, the gauss is a magnetic flux unit in the cgs system and is
still in common usage. In keeping with preferred practice, we use mks units, except 
when otherwise noted.

QUANTITIES AND UNITS
Scientific notation provides a convenient method to represent large and small num-
bers and to perform calculations involving such numbers. In scientific notation, a quantity
is expressed as a product of a number between 1 and 10 and a power of ten. For example,
the quantity 150,000 is expressed in scientific notation as 
and the quantity
0.00022 is expressed as 
Powers of Ten
Table 5 lists some powers of ten, both positive and negative, and the corresponding dec-
imal numbers. The power of ten is expressed as an exponent of the base 10 in each case
(10x). An exponent is a number to which a base number is raised. It indicates the number
2.2 * 10-4.
1.5 * 105,

SCIENTIFIC NOTATION
In electrical and electronics fields, both very small and very large quantities are com-
monly used. For example, it is common to have electrical current values of only a few
thousandths or even a few millionths of an ampere and to have resistance values rang-
ing up to several thousand or several million ohms.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Use scientific notation (powers of ten) to represent quantities
◆Express any number using a power of ten
◆Perform calculations with powers of ten

ENGINEERING NOTATION AND METRIC PREFIXES
Engineering notation, a specialized form of scientific notation, is used widely in tech-
nical fields to represent large and small quantities. In electronics, engineering notation
is used to represent values of voltage, current, power, resistance, capacitance, induc-
tance, and time, to name a few. Metric prefixes are used in conjunction with engineer-
ing notation as a “short hand” for the certain powers of ten that are multiples of three.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Use engineering notation and metric prefixes to represent large and small 
quantities
◆List the metric prefixes
◆Change a power of ten in engineering notation to a metric prefix
◆Use metric prefixes to express electrical quantities
◆Convert one metric prefix to another
Division
The steps for dividing numbers in powers of ten are as follows:
1. Divide the numbers directly without their powers of ten.
2. Subtract the power of ten in the denominator from the power of ten in the numera-
tor (the powers do not have to be the same).

QUANTITIES AND UNITS
Engineering Notation
Engineering notation is similar to scientific notation. However, in engineering notation
a number can have from one to three digits to the left of the decimal point and the power-
of-ten exponent must be a multiple of three. For example, the number 33,000 expressed in
engineering notation is 
In scientific notation, it is expressed as 
. As
another example, the number 0.045 expressed in engineering notation is

Metric Prefixes
In engineering notation metric prefixes represent each of the most commonly used pow-
ers of ten. These metric prefixes are listed in Table 6 with their symbols and corresponding
powers of ten.
Metric prefixes are used only with numbers that have a unit of measure, such as volts, am-
peres, and ohms, and precede the unit symbol. For example, 0.025 amperes can be expressed
in engineering notation as 
A. This quantity expressed using a metric prefix is 
25 mA, which is read 25 milliamps. Note that the metric prefix milli has replaced 
. As
another example, 100,000,000 ohms can be expressed as 
This quantity ex-
pressed using a metric prefix is 100 
which is read 100 megohms. The metric prefix
mega has replaced 106.

Calculator Tip
All scientific and graphing calculators provide features for entering and displaying num-
bers in various formats. Scientific and engineering notation are special cases of exponen-
tial (power of ten) notation. Most calculators have a key labeled EE (or EXP) that is used
to enter the exponent of numbers. To enter a number in exponential notation, enter the base
number first, including the sign, and then press the EE key, followed by the exponent, in-
cluding the sign.
Scientific and graphing calculators have displays for showing the power of ten. Some
calculators display the exponent as a small raised number on the right side of the display.
47.0 03
Other calculators display the number with a small E followed by the exponent.
47.0E03
Notice that the base 10 is not generally shown, but it is implied or represented by the E.
When you write out the number, you need to include the base 10. The displayed number
shown above is written out as 
in engineering notation.
Some calculators are placed in the scientific or engineering notation mode using a sec-
ondary or tertiary function, such as SCI or ENG. Then numbers are entered in regular dec-
imal form. The calculator automatically converts them to the proper format. Other
calculators provide for mode selection using a menu.
Always check the owner’s manual for your particular calculator to determine how to use
the exponential notation features.

METRIC UNIT CONVERSIONS
It is sometimes necessary or convenient to convert a quantity from one unit with a met-
ric prefix to another, such as from milliamperes (mA) to microamperes ( A). Moving
the decimal point in the number an appropriate number of places to the left or to the
right, depending on the particular conversion, results in a metric unit conversion.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Convert from one unit with a metric prefix to another
◆Convert between milli, micro, nano, and pico
◆Convert between kilo and mega
m
The following rules apply to metric unit conversions:
1. When converting from a larger unit to a smaller unit, move the decimal point to the right.
2. When converting from a smaller unit to a larger unit, move the decimal point to the
left.
3. Determine the number of places to move the decimal point by finding the differ-
ence in the powers of ten of the units being converted.
For example, when converting from milliamperes (mA) to microamperes (A), move the
decimal point three places to the right because there is a three-place difference between
the two units (mA is 
A and A is 
A). The following examples illustrate a few
conversions.

MEASURED NUMBERS
Whenever a quantity is measured, there is uncertainty in the result due to limitations of
the instruments used. When a measured quantity contains approximate numbers, the
digits known to be correct are called significant digits. When reporting measured
quantities, the number of digits that should be retained are the significant digits and no
more than one uncertain digit.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Express measured data with the proper number of significant digits
◆Define accuracy, error, and precision
◆Round numbers properly
Error, Accuracy, and Precision
Data taken in experiments are not perfect because the accuracy of the data depends on the
accuracy of the test equipment and the conditions under which the measurement was
made. In order to properly report measured data, the error associated with the measure-
ment should be taken into account. Experimental error should not be thought of as a mis-
take. All measurements that do not involve counting are approximations of the true value.
The difference between the true or best-accepted value of some quantity and the measured
value is the error. A measurement is said to be accurate if the error is small. Accuracy is
an indication of the range of error in a measurement. For example, if you measure thickness
of a 10.00 mm gauge block with a micrometer and find that it is 10.8 mm, the reading is not
accurate because a gauge block is considered to be a working standard. If you measure
10.02 mm, the reading is accurate because it is in reasonable agreement with the standard.
Another term associated with the quality of a measurement is precision. Precision is a
measure of the repeatability (or consistency) of a measurement of some quantity. It is pos-
sible to have a precise measurement in which a series of readings are not scattered, but
each measurement is inaccurate because of an instrument error. For example, a meter may
be out of calibration and produce inaccurate but consistent (precise) results. However, it is
not possible to have an accurate instrument unless it is also precise.
Significant Digits
The digits in a measured number that are known to be correct are called significant dig-
its. Most measuring instruments show the proper number of significant digits, but some in-
struments can show digits that are not significant, leaving it to the user to determine what
should be reported. This may occur because of an effect called loading. A meter can change
the actual reading in a circuit by its very presence. It is important to recognize when a read-
ing may be inaccurate; you should not report digits that are known to be inaccurate.
Another problem with significant digits occurs when you perform mathematical opera-
tions with numbers. The number of significant digits should never exceed the number in
the original measurement. For example, if 1.0 V is divided by 3.0 Ω, a calculator will show
0.33333333. Since the original numbers each contain 2 significant digits, the answer
should be reported as 0.33 A, the same number of significant digits.
The rules for determining if a reported digit is significant are
1. Nonzero digits are always considered to be significant.
2. Zeros to the left of the first nonzero digit are never significant.
3. Zeros between nonzero digits are always significant.
12

QUANTITIES AND UNITS
4. Zeros to the right of the decimal point for a decimal number are significant.
5. Zeros to the left of the decimal point with a whole number may or may not be sig-
nificant depending on the measurement. For example, the number 12,100 Ωcan
have 3, 4, or 5 significant digits. To clarify the significant digits, scientific notation
(or a metric prefix) should be used. For example, 12.10 kΩhas 4 significant digits.
When a measured value is reported, one uncertain digit may be retained but other un-
certain digits should be discarded. To find the number of significant digits in a number, ig-
nore the decimal point, and count the number of digits from left to right starting with the
first nonzero digit and ending with the last digit to the right. All of the digits counted are
significant except zeros to the right end of the number, which may or may not be signifi-
cant. In the absence of other information, the significance of the right-hand zeros is uncer-
tain. Generally, zeros that are placeholders, and not part of a measurement, are considered
to be not significant. To avoid confusion, numbers should be shown using scientific or en-
gineering notation if it is necessary to show the significant zeros.
Express the measured number 4300 with 2, 3, and 4 significant digits.
Solution
Zeros to the right of the decimal point in a decimal number are significant. Therefore,
to show two significant digits, write
To show three significant digits, write
To show four significant digits, write

(a) 40.0
(b) 0.3040
(c)
(d) 120,000
(e) 0.00502
Solution
(a) 40.0 has three significant digits; see rule 4.
(b) 0.3040 has four significant digits; see rules 2 and 3.
(c)
has three significant digits; see rule 4.
(d) 120,000 has at least two significant digits. Although the number has the same
value as in (c), zeros in this example are uncertain; see rule 5. This is not a recom-
mended method for reporting a measured quantity; use scientific notation or a
metric prefix in this case. See Example 18.
(e) 0.00502 has three significant digits; see rules 2 and 3.

EXAMPLE 19
Rounding Off Numbers
Since they always contain approximate numbers, measurements should be shown only
with those digits that are significant plus no more than one uncertain digit. The number of
digits shown is indicative of the precision of the measurement. For this reason, you should
13

QUANTITIES AND UNITS
round off a number by dropping one or more digits to the right of the last significant digit.
Use only the most significant dropped digit to decide how to round off. The rules for
rounding off are
1. If the most significant digit dropped is greater than 5, increase the last retained digit
by 1.
2. If the digit dropped is less than 5, do not change the last retained digit.
3. If the digit dropped is 5, increase the last retained digit if it makes it an even num-
ber, otherwise do not. This is called the “round-to-even” rule.
Round of the following numbers to three significant digits:
(a) 10.071
(b) 29.961
(c) 6.3948
(d) 123.52
(e) 122.52
Solution
(a) 10.071 rounds to 10.1.
(b) 29.961 rounds to 30.0.
(c) 6.3948 rounds to 6.39.
(d) 123.52 rounds to 124.
(e) 122.52 round to 122.
Related Problem

EXAMPLE 20
In most electrical and electronics work, components have tolerances greater than 1%
(5% and 10% are common). Most measuring instruments have accuracy specifications bet-
ter than this, but it is unusual for measurements to be made with higher accuracy than 1 part
in 1000. For this reason, three significant digits are appropriate for numbers that represent
measured quantities in all but the most exacting work. If you are working with a problem
with several intermediate results, keep all digits in your calculator, but round the answers
to three when reporting a result.

APPLICATION ACTIVITY PREVIEW
In this application activity, you will see how the theory pre-
sented in this chapter is applied to a practical circuit that
simulates part of a car’s instrument panel lighting system.
An automobile’s lights are examples of simple types of elec-
tric circuits. When you turn on the headlights and taillights,
you are connecting the lamps to the battery, which provides
the voltage and produces current through each lamp. The
current causes the lamps to emit light. The lamps themselves
have resistance that limits the amount of current. The instru-
ment panel lamp in most cars can be adjusted for bright-
ness. By turning a knob, you change the resistance in the
circuit, thereby causing the current to change. The amount
of current through the lamp determines its brightness.

INTRODUCTION
The theoretical concepts of electrical current, voltage, and
resistance are introduced in this chapter. You will learn how
to express each of these quantities in the proper units and
how each quantity is measured. The essential elements that
form a basic electric circuit and how they are put together
are covered.
Types of devices that generate voltage and current are in-
troduced. Also, you will see a variety of components that are
used to introduce resistance into electric circuits. The opera-
tion of protective devices such as fuses and circuit breakers
are discussed, and mechanical switches commonly used in
electric circuits are introduced. You will learn how to control
and measure voltage, current, and resistance using labora-
tory instruments.
Voltage is essential in any kind of electric circuit. Voltage
is the potential energy of electrical charge required to make
the circuit work. Current is also necessary for electric cir-
cuits to operate, but it takes voltage to produce the current.
Current is the movement of electrons through a circuit.
Resistance in a circuit limits the amount of current. A water
system can be used as an analogy for a simple circuit. Volt-
age can be considered analogous to the pressure required
to force water through the pipes. Current through wires
can be thought of as analogous to the water moving
through the pipes. Resistance can be thought of as analo-
gous to the restriction on the water flow produced by
adjusting a valve.

ATOMIC STRUCTURE
All matter is made of atoms; and all atoms consist of electrons, protons, and neutrons.
In this section, you will learn about the structure of an atom, including electron shells
and orbits, valence electrons, ions, and energy levels. The configuration of certain
electrons in an atom is the key factor in determining how well a given conductive or
semiconductive material conducts electric current.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Describe the basic structure of atoms
◆Define nucleus, proton, neutron, and electron
◆Define atomic number
◆Define shell
◆Explain what a valence electron is
◆Describe ionization
◆Explain what a free electron is
◆Define conductor, semiconductor, and insulator
An atom is the smallest particle of an element that retains the characteristics of that ele-
ment. Each of the known 110 elements has atoms that are different from the atoms of all other
elements. This gives each element a unique atomic structure. According to the classic Bohr
model, an atom is visualized as having a planetary type of structure that consists of a central
nucleus surrounded by orbiting electrons, as illustrated in Figure 1. The nucleus consists 
of positively charged particles called protons and uncharged particles called neutrons. The
basic particles of negative charge are called electrons, which orbit the nucleus.

VOLTAGE, CURRENT, AND RESISTANCE
Each type of atom has a certain number of protons that distinguishes it from the atoms
of all other elements. For example, the simplest atom is that of hydrogen, which has one
proton and one electron, as pictured in Figure 2(a). As another example, the helium 
atom, shown in Figure 2(b), has two protons and two neutrons in the nucleus and two 
electrons orbiting the nucleus.

Atomic Number
All elements are arranged in the periodic table of the elements in order according to their
atomic number. The atomic number equals the number of protons in the nucleus. For ex-
ample, hydrogen has an atomic number of 1 and helium has an atomic number of 2. In their
normal (or neutral) state, all atoms of a given element have the same number of electrons
as protons; the positive charges cancel the negative charges, and the atom has a net charge
of zero, making it electrically balanced.
Shells, Orbits, and Energy Levels
As you have seen in the Bohr model, electrons orbit the nucleus of an atom at certain dis-
tances from the nucleus and are restricted to these specific orbits. Each orbit corresponds
to a different energy level within the atom known as a shell. The shells are designated 1, 2, 3,
and so on, with 1 being closest to the nucleus. Electrons further from the nucleus are at
higher energy levels.
The line spectrums of hydrogen from the Bohr model of the atom shows that the elec-
trons can only absorb or emit a specific amount of energy that represents the exact differ-
ence between the levels. Figure 3 shows the energy levels within the hydrogen atom. The

lowest level 
is called the ground state and represents the most stable atom with a
single electron in the first shell. If this electron acquires a specific amount of energy by ab-
sorbing a photon, it can be raised to one of the higher energy levels. In this higher state, it
can emit a photon with exactly the same energy and return to the ground state. Transitions
between the levels account for various phenomena we see in electronics, such as the color
of light from a light-emitting diode.
After Bohr’s work, Erin Schroedinger (1887–1961) proposed a mathematical theory for
the atom that explained more complicated atoms. He suggested that the electron has a
wavelike property, and he considered the simplest case as having a three-dimensional
standing wave pattern due to vibrations. Schroedinger theorized the standing wave of an
electron with a spherical shape could have only certain wavelengths. This wave-mechanics
model of the atom gave the same equation for the electron energy in hydrogen as Bohr’s
model, but in the wave-mechanics model, more complicated atoms could be explained by
involving shapes other than spheres and adding a designation for the orientation of a given
shape within the atom. In both models, electrons near the nucleus have less energy than
those further out, which was the basic concept of the energy levels.
The idea of discrete energy levels within the atom is still a foundation for understanding
the atom, and the wave-mechanics model has been very successful at predicting the energy
levels for various atoms. The wave-mechanics model of the atom used the shell number,
called the principal quantum number, in the energy equation. Three other quantum num-
bers describe each electron within the atom. All electrons in an atom have a unique set of
quantum numbers.
When an atom is part of a large group, as in a crystal, the discrete energy levels broaden
into energy bands, which is an important idea in solid-state electronics. The bands also dif-
ferentiate between conductors, semiconductors, and insulators.
Valence Electrons
Electrons that are in orbits farther from the nucleus have higher energy and are less tightly
bound to the atom than those closer to the nucleus. This is because the force of attraction
between the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged electron decreases with
increasing distance from the nucleus. Electrons with the highest energy levels exist in the
outermost shell of an atom and are relatively loosely bound to the atom. This outermost
shell is known as the valence shell, and electrons in this shell are called valence electrons.
These valence electrons contribute to chemical reactions and bonding within the structure
of a material, and they determine the material’s electrical properties.
Energy Levels and Ionization Energy
If an electron absorbs a photon with sufficient energy, it escapes from the atom and be-
comes a free electron. This is indicated by the ionization energy level in Figure 3. Any
time an atom or group of atoms is left with a net charge, it is called an ion. When an elec-
tron escapes from the neutral hydrogen atom (designated H), the atom is left with a net pos-
itive charge and becomes a positive ion (designated 
). In other cases, an atom or group
of atoms can acquire an electron, in which case it is called a negative ion.
The Copper Atom
Copper is the most commonly used metal in electrical applications. The copper atom has
29 electrons that orbit the nucleus in four shells. The number of electrons in each shell fol-
lows a predictable pattern according to the formula, 
where N is the number of the
shell. The first shell of any atom can have up to two electrons, the second shell up to eight
electrons, the third shell up to 18 electrons, and the fourth shell up to 32 electrons.
A copper atom is represented in Figure 4. Notice that the fourth or outermost shell, 
the valence shell, has only one valence electron. The inner shells are called the core. When
the valence electron in the outer shell of the copper atom gains sufficient thermal energy, it

can break away from the parent atom and become a free electron. In a piece of copper at
room temperature, a “sea” of these free electrons is present. These electrons are not bound
to a given atom but are free to move in the copper material. Free electrons make copper an
excellent conductor and make electrical current possible.
Categories of Materials
Three categories of materials are used in electronics: conductors, semiconductors, and
insulators.
Conductors
Conductors are materials that readily allow current. They have a large
number of free electrons and are characterized by one to three valence electrons in their
structure. Most metals are good conductors. Silver is the best conductor, and copper is next.
Copper is the most widely used conductive material because it is less expensive than silver.
Copper wire is commonly used as a conductor in electric circuits.
Semiconductors
Semiconductors are classed below the conductors in their ability to
carry current because they have fewer free electrons than do conductors. Semiconductors
have four valence electrons in their atomic structures. However, because of their unique
characteristics, certain semiconductor materials are the basis for electronic devices such as
the diode, transistor, and integrated circuit. Silicon and germanium are common semicon-
ductive materials.
Insulators
Insulators are nonmetallic materials that are poor conductors of electric cur-
rent; they are used to prevent current where it is not wanted. Insulators have no free elec-
trons in their structure. The valence electrons are bound to the nucleus and not considered
“free.” Most practical insulators used in electrical and electronic applications are com-
pounds such as glass, porcelain, teflon, and polyethylene, to name a few.

VOLTAGE, CURRENT, AND RESISTANCE
The charge of an electron and that of a proton are equal in magnitude. Electrical charge
is an electrical property of matter that exists because of an excess or deficiency of electrons.
Charge is symbolized by the letter Q. Static electricity is the presence of a net positive or
negative charge in a material. Everyone has experienced the effects of static electricity
from time to time, for example, when attempting to touch a metal surface or another per-
son or when the clothes in a dryer cling together.
Materials with charges of opposite polarity are attracted to each other, and materials
with charges of the same polarity are repelled, as indicated in Figure 5. A force acts be-
tween charges, as evidenced by the attraction or repulsion. This force, called an electric
field, is represented by imaginary lines, as represented in Figure 6.

ELECTRICAL CHARGE
As you know, an electron is the smallest particle that exhibits negative electrical charge.
When an excess of electrons exists in a material, there is a net negative electrical
charge. When a deficiency of electrons exists, there is a net positive electrical charge.

A single electron has a charge of

coulombs, for a given number of electrons is stated in the following formula:

Equation 1
Positive and Negative Charge
Consider a neutral atom—that is, one that has the same number of electrons and protons
and thus has no net charge. As you know, when a valence electron is pulled away from the
atom by the application of energy, the atom is left with a net positive charge (more protons
than electrons) and becomes a positive ion. If an atom acquires an extra electron in its outer
shell, it has a net negative charge and becomes a negative ion.
The amount of energy required to free a valence electron is related to the number of
electrons in the outer shell. An atom can have up to eight valence electrons. The more com-
plete the outer shell, the more stable the atom and thus the more energy is required to re-
move an electron. Figure 7 illustrates the creation of a positive ion and a negative ion 
when a hydrogen atom gives up its single valence electron to a chlorine atom, forming
gaseous hydrogen chloride (HCl). When the gaseous HCl is dissolved in water, hydrochloric
acid is formed.

Voltage, symbolized by V, is defined as energy or work per unit charge.

Some sources use E instead of V to symbolize voltage, but we use V.
As an analogy, consider a water tank that is supported several feet above the ground. A
given amount of energy must be exerted in the form of work to pump water up to fill the
tank. Once the water is stored in the tank, it has a certain potential energy which, if re-
leased, can be used to perform work.

As you have seen, a force of attraction exists between a positive and a negative charge.
A certain amount of energy must be exerted, in the form of work, to overcome the force
and move the charges a given distance apart. All opposite charges possess a certain po-
tential energy because of the separation between them. The difference in potential energy
per charge is the potential difference or voltage. Voltage is the driving force, sometimes
called electromotive force or emf, in electric circuits and is what establishes current.

The Voltage Source
A voltage source provides electrical energy or electromotive force (emf), more commonly
known as voltage. Voltage is produced by means of chemical energy, light energy, and
magnetic energy combined with mechanical motion.
The Ideal Voltage Source
An ideal voltage source can provide a constant voltage for
any current required by a circuit. The ideal voltage source does not exist but can be closely
approximated in practice. For purposes of analysis the ideal source is assumed unless oth-
erwise specified.
Voltage sources can be either dc or ac. A common symbol for a dc voltage source is
shown in Figure 8(a) and one for an ac voltage source is shown in part (b).

A graph showing voltage versus current for an ideal dc voltage source is illustrated in
Figure 9. As you can see, the voltage is constant for any current (within limits) from the
source. For a practical voltage source connected in a circuit, the voltage decreases slightly
as the current increases, as shown by the dashed curve. Current is always drawn from a
voltage source when a load such as a resistance is connected to it.

Types of DC Voltage Sources
Batteries
A battery is a type of voltage source that converts chemical energy directly
into electrical energy. As you know, work (or energy) per charge is the basic unit for volt-
age, and a battery adds energy to each unit of charge. It is something of a misnomer to talk
about “charging a battery” because a battery does not store charge but rather stores chemi-
cal potential energy. All batteries use a specific type of chemical reaction called an
oxidation-reduction reaction. In this type of reaction, electrons are transferred from one re-
actant to the other. If the chemicals used in the reaction are separated, it is possible to cause
the electrons to travel in the external circuit, creating current. As long as there is an exter-
nal path for the electrons, the reaction can proceed, and stored chemical energy is converted
to electrical current. If the path is broken, the reaction stops and the battery is said to be in
equilibrium. In a battery, the terminal that supplies electrons has a surplus of electrons and
is the negative electrode or anode. The electrode that acquires electrons has a positive
potential and is the cathode.

VOLTAGE, CURRENT, AND RESISTANCE
Figure 10 shows a nonrechargeable single-cell copper-zinc battery that we will use 
for illustration of battery operation. The copper-zinc cell is simple to construct and illus-
trates concepts common to all nonrechargeable batteries. A zinc electrode and a copper elec-
trode are immersed in solutions of zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) and copper sulfate (CuSO4), which
are separated by a salt bridge that prevents the Cu2 ions from reacting directly with the Zn
metal. The zinc metal electrode supplies Zn2 ions to the solution and electrons to the exter-
nal circuit, so this electrode is constantly eaten away as the reaction proceeds. The salt bridge
allows ions to pass through it to maintain charge balance in the cell. There are no free elec-
trons in the solutions, so an external path for electrons is provided through an ammeter (in our
case) or other load. On the cathode side, the electrons that were given up by the zinc combine
with copper ions from the solution to form copper metal, which deposits on the copper elec-
trode. The chemical reactions (shown in the diagram) occur at the electrode. Different types
of batteries have different reactions, but all involve transfer of electrons in the external circuit.
A single cell will have a certain fixed voltage. In the copper-zinc cell, the voltage is 1.1 V.
In a lead-acid cell, the kind used in car batteries, a potential difference of about 2.1 V is be-
tween the anode and cathode. The voltage of any cell depends on the cell chemistry. Nickel-
cadmium cells are about 1.2 V and lithium cells can be as high as almost 4 V. Cell chemistry
also determines the shelf life and discharge characteristics for a battery. For example, a lithium-
MnO2 battery typically has five times the shelf life of a comparable carbon-zinc battery.
Although the voltage of a battery cell is fixed by its chemistry, the capacity is variable
and depends on the quantity of materials in the cell. Essentially, the capacity of a cell is the
number of electrons that can be obtained from it and is measured by the amount of current
that can be supplied over time.
Batteries normally consist of multiple cells that are electrically connected together in-
ternally. The way that the cells are connected and the type of cells determine the voltage
and current capacity of the battery. If the positive electrode of one cell is connected to the
negative electrode of the next and so on, as illustrated in Figure 11(a), the battery volt-
age is the sum of the individual cell voltages. This is called a series connection. To increase
battery current capacity, the positive electrodes of several cells are connected together and
all the negative electrodes are connected together, as illustrated in Figure 11(b). This is
called a parallel connection. Also, by using larger cells, which have a greater quantity of
material, the ability to supply current can be increased but the voltage is not affected.

Lead-acid batteries can be
dangerous because sulfuric acid is
highly corrosive and battery gases
(primarily hydrogen) are explosive.
The acid in the battery can cause
serious eye damage if it contacts
the eye and can cause skin burns or
destroy clothing. You should always
wear eye protection when working
on or around batteries and wash
well after handling batteries.
When removing a battery from
service, make sure the switch is
off. When a cable is removed, a
spark may be created and ignite
the explosive battery gases.
T E C H  N O T E
To store a lead-acid battery for an
extended period, it should be fully
charged and placed in a cool, dry
location that is protected from
freezing or excessive heat. A
battery will self-discharge over
time, so it needs to be periodically
checked and recharged when it is
less than 70% fully charged.
Battery manufacturers will have
specific recommendations for
storage on their websites.

VOLTAGE, CURRENT, AND RESISTANCE
Batteries are divided into two major classes, primary and secondary. Primary batteries
are used once and discarded because their chemical reactions are irreversible. Secondary
batteries can be recharged and reused many times because they are characterized by re-
versible chemical reactions.
Primary and secondary batteries are available in a variety of shapes and sizes. Some of
the sizes that you are most familiar with are AAA, AA, C, D, and 9 V but there are many
others that are less common. Batteries are also typed according to their chemical makeup.
A few common types of primary and secondary batteries are listed below.
◆Alkaline-MnO2
This is a primary battery that is commonly used in palm-type com-
puters, photographic equipment, toys, radios, and recorders.
◆Carbon-zinc
This is a primary battery used in flashlights and small appliances.
◆Lead-acid
This is a secondary (rechargable) battery that is commonly used in au-
tomotive, marine, and other similar applications.
◆Lithium-ion
This is a secondary battery that is commonly used in all types of
portable electronics. This type of battery is increasingly being used in defense, aero-
space, and automotive applications.
◆Lithium-MnO2
This is a primary battery that is commonly used in photographic
and electronic equipment, smoke alarms, personal organizers, memory backup, and
communications equipment.
◆Nickel-metal hydride
This is a secondary (rechargable) battery that is commonly
used in portable computers, cell phones, camcorders, and other portable consumer
electronics.
◆Silver oxide
This is a primary battery that is commonly used in watches, photo-
graphic equipment, hearing aids, and electronics requiring high-capacity batteries.
◆Zinc air
This is a primary battery that is commonly used in hearing aids, medical
monitoring instruments, pagers, and other frequency-use applications.
Fuel Cells
A fuel cell is a device that converts electrochemical energy into dc voltage di-
rectly. Fuel cells combine a fuel (usually hydrogen) with an oxidizing agent (usually oxy-
gen). In the hydrogen fuel cell, hydrogen and oxygen react to form water, which is the only
by-product. The process is clean, quiet, and more efficient than burning. Fuel cells and bat-
teries are similar in that they both are electrochemical devices that produce electricity
using an oxidation-reduction reaction. However, a battery is a closed system with all its
chemicals stored inside, whereas in a fuel cell, the chemicals (hydrogen and oxygen) con-
stantly flow into the cell where they combine and produce electricity.
Hydrogen fuel cells are usually classified by their operating temperature and the type of
electrolyte they use. Some types work well for use in stationary power generation plants.
Others may be useful for small portable applications or for powering cars. For example, the

type that holds the most promise for automotive applications is the polymer exchange
membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), which is a type of hydrogen fuel cell. A simplified diagram
is shown in Figure 12 to illustrate the basic operation.
The channels disperse pressurized hydrogen gas and oxygen gas equally over the sur-
face of the catalyst, which facilitates the reaction of the hydrogen and oxygen. When an H2
molecule comes in contact with the platinum catalyst on the anode side of the fuel cell, it
splits into two H ions and two electrons (e-). The hydrogen ions are passed through the
polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) onto the cathode. The electrons pass through the an-
ode and into the external circuit to create current.
When an O2 molecule comes in contact with the catalyst on the cathode side, it breaks
apart, forming two oxygen ions. The negative charge of these ions attracts two H ions
through the electrolyte membrane and together they combine with electrons from the ex-
ternal circuit to form a water molecule (H2O), which is passed from the cell as a by-product.
In a single fuel cell, this reaction produces only about 0.7 V. To get higher voltages, multi-
ple fuel cells are connected in series.
Current research on fuel cells is ongoing and is focused on developing reliable, smaller,
and cost-effective components for vehicles and other applications. The conversion to fuel
cells also requires research on how best to obtain and provide hydrogen fuel where it is
needed. Potential sources for hydrogen include using solar, geothermal, or wind energy to
break apart water. Hydrogen can also be obtained by breaking down coal or natural gas
molecules, which are rich in hydrogen.
Solar Cells
The operation of solar cells is based on the photovoltaic effect, which is
the process whereby light energy is converted directly into electrical energy. A basic
solar cell consists of two layers of different types of semiconductive materials joined
together to form a junction. When one layer is exposed to light, many electrons acquire
enough energy to break away from their parent atoms and cross the junction. This
process forms negative ions on one side of the junction and positive ions on the other, and
thus a potential difference (voltage) is developed. Figure 13 shows the construction of 
a basic solar cell.

Although solar cells can be used in room light for powering a calculator, research is fo-
cusing more on converting sunlight to electricity. There is considerable research in in-
creasing the efficiency of solar cells and photovoltaic (PV) modules today because they are
a very clean source of energy using sunlight. A complete system for continuous power gen-
erally requires a battery backup to provide energy when the sun is not shining. Solar cells
are well suited for remote locations where energy sources are unavailable and are used in
providing power to satellites.
DC Generator
Electrical generators convert mechanical energy into electrical energy
using a principle called electromagnetic induction. A conductor is rotated through a mag-
netic field, and a voltage is produced across the conductor. A typical generator is pictured
in Figure 14.
 FIGURE 14
Cutaway view of a dc voltage 
generator.
The Electronic Power Supply
Electronic power supplies convert the ac voltage from
a wall outlet to a dc voltage that can be varied over a specified range. Typical laboratory
power supplies are shown in Figure 15.
Thermocouples
The thermocouple is a thermoelectric type of voltage source that is
commonly used to sense temperature. A thermocouple is formed by the junction of two dis-
similar metals, and its operation is based on the Seebeck effect that describes the voltage
generated at the junction of the metals as a function of temperature.
Standard types of thermocouple are characterized by the specific metals used. These
standard thermocouples produce predictable output voltages for a range of temperatures.
The most common is type K, made of chromel and alumel. Other types are also designated
by letters as E, J, N, B, R, and S. Most thermocouples are available in wire or probe form.
Piezoelectric Sensors
These sensors act as voltage sources and are based on the piezo-
electric effect where a voltage is generated when a piezoelectric material is mechanically

deformed by an external force. Quartz and ceramic are two types of piezoelectric material.
Piezoelectric sensors are used in applications such as pressure sensors, force sensors, ac-
celerometers, microphones, ultrasonic devices, and many others.

VOLTAGE, CURRENT, AND RESISTANCE
As you have learned, free electrons are available in all conductive and semiconductive
materials. These outer-shell electrons drift randomly in all directions, from atom to atom,
within the structure of the material, as indicated in Figure 16. These electrons are loosely
bound to the positive metal ions in the material, but because of thermal energy, they are free
to move about the crystalline structure of the metal.
 FIGURE 16
Random motion of free electrons in
a material.
If a voltage is placed across a conductive or semiconductive material, one end becomes
positive and the other negative, as indicated in Figure 17. The repulsive force produced 
by the negative voltage at the left end causes the free electrons (negative charges) to move
toward the right. The attractive force produced by the positive voltage at the right end pulls
the free electrons to the right. The result is a net movement of the free electrons from the
negative end of the material to the positive end, as shown in Figure 17.

The movement of these free electrons from the negative end of the material to the posi-

Electrical current is the rate of flow of charge.
Current in a conductive material is determined by the number of electrons (amount of
charge) that flow past a point in a unit of time.
In 1820 Ampère, a Frenchman,
developed a theory of electricity
and magnetism that was
fundamental for 19th century
developments in the field. He was
the first to build an instrument to
measure charge flow (current). The
unit of electrical current is named

The Current Source
The Ideal Current Source
As you know, an ideal voltage source can provide a constant
voltage for any load. An ideal current source can provide a constant current in any load.
Just as in the case of a voltage source, the ideal current source does not exist but can be ap-
proximated in practice. We will assume ideal unless otherwise specified.
The symbol for a current source is shown in Figure 19(a). The graph for an ideal current
source is a horizontal line as illustrated in Figure 19(b). This is called the IV characteristic.
Notice that the current is constant for any voltage across the current source. In a practical cur-
rent source, the current decreases slightly with voltage, as shown by the dashed line.

voltage can be high, and a shock
will result, particularly if the load
is a high resistance load or the
load is disconnected when the
current source is turned on.

Practical Current Sources
Power supplies are normally thought of as voltage sources be-
cause they are the most common type of source in the laboratory. However, current sources are
another type of energy source. Current sources may be “stand-alone” instruments or may be
combined with other instruments, such as a voltage source, DMM, or function generator. Ex-
amples of combination instruments are the source-measurement units shown in Figure 20.

VOLTAGE, CURRENT, AND RESISTANCE
These units can be set up as voltage or current sources and include a built-in DMM, as well as
other instruments. They are used primarily for testing transistors and other semiconductors.
In most transistor circuits, the transistor acts as a current source because part of the IV
characteristic curve is a horizontal line as shown by the transistor characteristic in Figure
21. The flat part of the graph indicates where the transistor current is constant over a 
range of voltages. The constant-current region is used to form a constant-current source.

RESISTANCE
When there is current through a material, the free electrons move through the material
and occasionally collide with atoms. These collisions cause the electrons to lose some
of their energy, and thus their movement is restricted. The more collisions, the more the
flow of electrons is restricted. This restriction varies and is determined by the type of
material. The property of a material that restricts the flow of electrons is called
resistance, designated with an R.
After completing this section, you should be able to

When there is current through a material, the free electrons move through the material
and occasionally collide with atoms. These collisions cause the electrons to lose some of
their energy, thus restricting their movement. The more collisions, the more the flow of
electrons is restricted. This restriction varies and is determined by the type of material. The
property of a material to restrict or oppose the flow of electrons is called resistance, R.
Resistance is the opposition to current.
Resistance is expressed in ohms, symbolized by the Greek letter omega (
).
One ohm (1 
) of resistance exists if there is one ampere (1 A) of current in a ma-
terial when one volt (1 V) is applied across the material.
The schematic symbol for resistance is shown in Figure 22.

One common fixed resistor is the carbon-composition type, which is made with a mix-
ture of finely ground carbon, insulating filler, and a resin binder. The ratio of carbon to
insulating filler sets the resistance value. The mixture is formed into rods, and conductive
lead connections are made. The entire resistor is then encapsulated in an insulated coat-
ing for protection. Figure 24(a) shows the construction of a typical carbon-composition 
resistor.
Siemens was born in Prussia.
While in prison for acting as a
second in a duel, he began to

Resistors
A component that is specifically designed to have a certain amount of resistance is called a
resistor. The principal applications of resistors are to limit current in a circuit, to divide
voltage, and, in certain cases, to generate heat. Although resistors come in many shapes and
sizes, they can all be placed in one of two main categories: fixed or variable.
Fixed Resistors
Fixed resistors are available with a large selection of resistance values
that are set during manufacturing and cannot be changed easily. They are constructed using
various methods and materials. Figure 23 shows several common types.

The chip resistor is another type of fixed resistor and is in the category of SMT (surface
mount technology) components. It has the advantage of a very small size for compact as-
semblies. Figure 24(b) shows the construction of a chip resistor.
Other types of fixed resistors include carbon film, metal film, and wirewound. In film re-
sistors, a resistive material is deposited evenly onto a high-grade ceramic rod. The resistive
film may be carbon (carbon film) or nickel chromium (metal film). In these types of resis-
tors, the desired resistance value is obtained by removing part of the resistive material in a
helical pattern along the rod using a spiraling technique, as shown in Figure 25(a). Very
close tolerance can be achieved with this method. Film resistors are also available in the
form of resistor networks, as shown in Figure 25(b).

power ratings. Since they are constructed with a coil of wire, wirewound resistors have sig-
nificant inductance and are not used at higher frequencies. Some typical wirewound resis-
tors are shown in Figure 26.

Resistor Color Codes
Fixed resistors with value tolerances of 5% or 10% are color
coded with four bands to indicate the resistance value and the tolerance. This color-code
band system is shown in Figure 27, and the color code is listed in Table 1. The bands 
are always closer to one end.

of the resistance value. If it is not clear which is the banded end, start from the end
that does not begin with a gold or silver band.
2. The second band is the second digit of the resistance value.
3. The third band is the number of zeros following the second digit, or the multiplier.
4. The fourth band indicates the percent tolerance and is usually gold or silver.
For example, a 5% tolerance means that the actual resistance value is within 5% of the
color-coded value. Thus, a 
resistor with a tolerance of 5% can have an acceptable
range of values from a minimum of

Resistor Label Codes
Not all types of resistors are color coded. Many, including sur-
face-mount resistors, use typographical marking to indicate the resistance value and toler-
ance. These label codes consist of either all numbers (numeric) or a combination of
numbers and letters (alphanumeric). In some cases when the body of the resistor is large
enough, the entire resistance value and tolerance are stamped on it in standard form.
Numeric labeling uses three digits to indicate the resistance value, as shown in 
Figure 31 using a specific example. The first two digits give the first two digits of the re-
sistance value, and the third digit gives the multiplier or number of zeros that follow the
first two digits. This code is limited to values of 
or greater.

Another common type of marking is a three- or four-character label that uses both digits
and letters. An alphanumeric label typically consists of only three digits or two or three dig-
its and one of the letters R, K, or M. The letter is used to indicate the multiplier, and the po-
sition of the letter indicates the decimal point placement. The letter R indicates a multiplier
of 1 (no zeros after the digits), the K indicates a multiplier of 1000 (three zeros after the dig-
its), and the M indicates a multiplier of 1,000,000 (six zeros after the digits). In this format,
values from 100 to 999 consist of three digits and no letter to represent the three digits in the
resistance value. Figure 32 shows three examples of this type of resistor label.

Variable Resistors
Variable resistors are designed so that their resistance values can be
changed easily. Two basic uses for variable resistors are to divide voltage and to control
current. The variable resistor used to divide voltage is called a potentiometer. The vari-
able resistor used to control current is called a rheostat. Schematic symbols for these types
are shown in Figure 33. The potentiometer is a three-terminal device, as indicated in part
(a). Terminals 1 and 2 have a fixed resistance between them, which is the total resistance.
Terminal 3 is connected to a moving contact (wiper). You can vary the resistance between
3 and 1 or between 3 and 2 by moving the contact.

how you can use a potentiometer as a rheostat by connecting terminal 3 to either terminal
1 or terminal 2. Parts (b) and (c) are equivalent symbols. Some typical potentiometers are
pictured in Figure 34.
Potentiometers and rheostats can be classified as linear or tapered, as shown in Figure 35,
where a potentiometer with a total resistance of 
is used as an example. As shown in part
(a), in a linear potentiometer, the resistance between either terminal and the moving contact

VOLTAGE, CURRENT, AND RESISTANCE
varies linearly with the position of the moving contact. For example, one-half of the total con-
tact movement results in one-half the total resistance. Three-quarters of the total movement re-
sults in three-quarters of the total resistance between the moving contact and one terminal, or
one-quarter of the total resistance between the other terminal and the moving contact.
In the tapered potentiometer, the resistance varies nonlinearly with the position of the mov-
ing contact, so that one-half of a turn does not necessarily result in one-half the total resistance.
This concept is illustrated in Figure 35(b), where the nonlinear values are arbitrary.
The potentiometer is used as a voltage-control device because when a fixed voltage is
applied across the end terminals, a variable voltage is obtained at the wiper contact with re-
spect to either end terminal. The rheostat is used as a current-control device because the
current can be changed by changing the wiper position.
Variable Resistance Sensors
Many sensors operate on the concept of a variable resist-
ance, in which a physical quantity alters the electrical resistance. Depending on the sensor
and the measurement requirements, the change in resistance may be determined directly or
indirectly using the resistance change to alter a voltage or current.
Examples of resistance sensors include thermistors that change resistance as a function
of temperature, photoconductive cells that change resistance as a function of light, and
strain gauges that change resistance when a force is applied to them. Strain gauges are
widely used in scales and applications where mechanical motion needs to be sensed. The
measuring instruments need to be very sensitive because the change in resistance is very
small. Figure 36 shows symbols for these various resistance sensors.

THE ELECTRIC CIRCUIT
A basic electric circuit is an arrangement of physical components that use voltage, cur-
rent, and resistance to perform some useful function.

VOLTAGE, CURRENT, AND RESISTANCE
Direction of Current
For a few years after the discovery of electricity, people assumed all current consisted of
moving positive charges. However, in the 1890s, the electron was identified as the charge
carrier in solid conductors.
Today, there are two accepted conventions for the direction of electrical current.
Electron flow direction, preferred by many in the fields of electrical and electronics tech-
nology, assumes for analysis purposes that current is out of the negative terminal of a volt-
age source, through the circuit, and into the positive terminal of the source. Conventional
current direction assumes for analysis purposes that current is out of the positive terminal
of a voltage source, through the circuit, and into the negative terminal of the source. By fol-
lowing the direction of conventional current, there is a rise in voltage across a source (neg-
ative to positive) and a drop in voltage across a resistor (positive to negative).
Since you cannot actually see current, only its effects, it actually makes no difference
which direction of current is assumed as long as it is used consistently. The results of elec-
tric circuit analysis are not affected by the direction of current that is assumed for analyti-
cal purposes. The direction used for analysis is largely a matter of preference, and there are
many proponents for each approach. We use conventional current direction.
Conventional current direction is also used in electronics technology and is used almost
exclusively at the engineering level.
The Basic Circuit
Basically, an electric circuit consists of a voltage source, a load, and a path for current be-
tween the source and the load. Figure 37 shows in pictorial form an example of a simple
electric circuit: a battery connected to a lamp with two conductors (wires). The battery is
the voltage source, the lamp is the load on the battery because it draws current from the
battery, and the two wires provide the current path from the positive terminal of the battery
to the lamp and back to the negative terminal of the battery. Current goes through the fila-
ment of the lamp (which has a resistance), causing it to emit visible light. Current through
the battery occurs by chemical action.

VOLTAGE, CURRENT, AND RESISTANCE
In many practical cases, one terminal of the battery is connected to a common or ground
point. For example, in most automobiles, the negative battery terminal is connected to the
metal chassis of the car. The chassis is the ground for the automobile electrical system and
acts as a conductor that completes the circuit.
The Electric Circuit Schematic
An electric circuit can be represented by a schematic
using standard symbols for each element, as shown in Figure 38 for the simple circuit in
Figure 37. A schematic, in an organized manner, shows how the various components in 
a given circuit are interconnected so that the operation of the circuit can be determined.
Current Control and Protection
The example circuit in Figure 37 illustrated a closed circuit—that is, a circuit in which 
the current has a complete path. When the current path is broken, the circuit is called an
open circuit.
Mechanical Switches
Switches are commonly used for controlling the opening or clos-
ing of circuits. For example, a switch is used to turn a lamp on or off, as illustrated in Figure
39. Each circuit pictorial is shown with its associated schematic. The type of switch in-
dicated is a single-pole–single-throw (SPST) toggle switch. The term pole refers to the
movable arm in a switch, and the term throw indicates the number of contacts that are af-
fected (either opened or closed) by a single switch action (a single movement of a pole).

VOLTAGE, CURRENT, AND RESISTANCE
In addition to the SPST and the SPDT switches (symbols are shown in Figure 41(a) 
and (b)), the following other types are important:
◆Double-pole–single-throw (DPST)
The DPST switch permits simultaneous opening or
closing of two sets of contacts. The symbol is shown in Figure 41(c). The dashed line 
indicates that the contact arms are mechanically linked so that both move with a single
switch action.
◆Double-pole–double-throw (DPDT)
The DPDT switch provides connection from
one set of contacts to either of two other sets. The schematic symbol is shown in
Figure 41(d).
◆Push-button (PB)
In the normally open push-button switch (NOPB), shown in
Figure 41(e), connection is made between two contacts when the button is de-
pressed, and connection is broken when the button is released. In the normally closed
push-button switch (NCPB), shown in Figure 41(f), connection between the two
contacts is broken when the button is depressed.
◆Rotary
In a rotary switch, connection between one contact and any one of several
others is made by turning a knob. A symbol for a simple six-position rotary switch is
shown in Figure 41(g).
Figure 42 shows several varieties of mechanical switches, and Figure 43 shows the 
construction view of a typical toggle switch.

Semiconductor Switches
Transistors are widely used as switches in many applications.
The transistor can be used as the equivalent of a single-pole–single-throw switch. You can
open and close a circuit path by controlling the state of the transistor. Two types of transis-
tor symbols are shown in Figure 44 with their mechanical switch equivalents.

Transistor switches.
Here is a greatly simplified description of operation. One type, called the bipolar tran-
sistor, is controlled by current. When there is current at a specific terminal, the transistor
acts as a closed switch; when there is no current at that terminal, the transistor acts as an
open switch, as illustrated in Figure 44(a). Another type, called the field-effect transistor,
is controlled by voltage. When there is voltage at a specific terminal, the transistor acts as
a closed switch; when there is no voltage at that terminal, the transistor acts as an open
switch, as illustrated in part (b).
Protective Devices
Fuses and circuit breakers are used to deliberately create an open
circuit when the current exceeds a specified number of amperes due to a malfunction or
other abnormal condition in a circuit. For example, a 20 A fuse or circuit breaker will open
a circuit when the current exceeds 20 A.
The basic difference between a fuse and a circuit breaker is that when a fuse is “blown,”
it must be replaced; but when a circuit breaker opens, it can be reset and reused repeatedly.
Both of these devices protect against damage to a circuit due to excess current or prevent a
hazardous condition created by the overheating of wires and other components when the
current is too great. Several typical fuses and circuit breakers, along with their schematic
symbols, are shown in Figure 45.
Two basic categories of fuses in terms of their physical configuration are cartridge type
and plug type (screw in). Cartridge-type fuses have various-shaped housings with leads or
other types of contacts, as shown in Figure 45(a). A typical plug-type fuse is shown in 
part (b). Fuse operation is based on the melting temperature of a wire or other metal ele-
ment. As current increases, the fuse element heats up and when the rated current is ex-
ceeded, the element reaches its melting temperature and opens, thus removing power from
the circuit.
Two common types of fuses are the fast-acting and the time-delay (slow-blow). Fast-
acting fuses are type F and time-delay fuses are type T. In normal operation, fuses are
often subjected to intermittent current surges that may exceed the rated current, such as
when power to a circuit is turned on. Over time, this reduces the fuse’s ability to withstand
short surges or even current at the rated value. A slow-blow fuse can tolerate greater and
longer duration surges of current than the typical fast-acting fuse. A fuse symbol is shown
in Figure 45(d).
Always use fully insulated fuse
pullers to remove and replace
fuses in an electrical box. Even if
the disconnect switch is in the off
position, line voltage is still
present in the box. Never use
metal tools to remove and 
replace fuses.
50

VOLTAGE, CURRENT, AND RESISTANCE
Typical circuit breakers are shown in Figure 45(c) and the symbol is shown in part (e).
Generally, a circuit breaker detects excess current either by the heating effect of the current
or by the magnetic field it creates. In a circuit breaker based on the heating effect, a
bimetallic spring opens the contacts when the rated current is exceeded. Once opened, the
contact is held open by mechanical means until manually reset. In a circuit breaker based
on a magnetic field, the contacts are opened by a sufficient magnetic force created by ex-
cess current and must be mechanically reset.
Wires
Wires are the most common form of conductive material used in electrical applications.
They vary in diameter and are arranged according to standard gauge numbers, called AWG
(American Wire Gauge) sizes. As the gauge number increases, the wire diameter de-
creases. The size of a wire is also specified in terms of its cross-sectional area, as illustrated
in Figure 46. A unit of cross-sectional area used for wires is the circular mil, abbreviated
CM. One circular mil is the area of a wire with a diameter of 0.001 inch (1 mil). You can
find the cross-sectional area by expressing the diameter in thousandths of an inch (mils)
and squaring it, as follows:

Wire Resistance
Although copper wire conducts electricity extremely well, it still has
some resistance, as do all conductors. The resistance of a wire depends on three physical
characteristics: (a) type of material, (b) length of wire, and (c) cross-sectional area. In ad-
dition, temperature can also affect the resistance.
Each type of conductive material has a characteristic called its resistivity,
. For each
material, 
is a constant value at a given temperature. The formula for the resistance of a
wire of length l and cross-sectional area A is

This formula shows that resistance increases with an increase in resistivity and length and de-

VOLTAGE, CURRENT, AND RESISTANCE
As mentioned, Table 3 lists the resistance of the various standard wire sizes in ohms 
per 1000 feet at 20°C. For example, a 1000 ft length of 14 gauge copper wire has a resist-
ance of 
. A 1000 ft length of 22 gauge wire has a resistance of 
. For a given
length, the smaller wire has more resistance. Thus, for a given voltage, larger wires can
carry more current than smaller ones.
Ground
Ground is the reference point in electric circuits. The term ground originated from the fact
that one conductor of a circuit was typically connected with an 8-foot long metal rod driven
into the earth itself. Today, this type of connection is referred to as an earth ground. In
household wiring, earth ground is indicated with a green or bare copper wire. Earth ground
is normally connected to the metal chassis of an appliance or a metal electrical box for
safety. Unfortunately, there have been exceptions to this rule, which can present a safety
hazard if a metal chassis is not at earth ground. It is a good idea to confirm that a metal
chassis is actually at earth ground potential before doing any work on an instrument or
appliance.
Another type of ground is called a reference ground. Voltages are always specified with
respect to another point. If that point is not stated explicitly, the reference ground is under-
stood. Reference ground defines 0 V for the circuit. The reference ground can be at a com-
pletely different potential than the earth ground. Reference ground is also called common
and labeled COM or COMM because it represents a common conductor. When you are
wiring a protoboard in the laboratory, you will normally reserve one of the bus strips (a long
line along the length of the board) for this common conductor.
Three ground symbols are shown in Figure 47. Unfortunately, there is not a separate
symbol to distinguish between earth ground and reference ground. The symbol in (a) rep-
resents either an earth ground or a reference ground, (b) shows a chassis ground, and (c) is
an alternate reference symbol typically used when there is more than one common con-
nection (such as analog and digital ground in the same circuit). We use the symbol in 
part (a).
Figure 48 illustrates a simple circuit with ground connections. The current is from the
positive terminal of the 12 V source, through the lamp, and back to the negative terminal of
the source through the ground connection. Ground provides a return path for the current
back to the source because all of the ground points are electrically the same point. The volt-
age at the top of the circuit is 
V with respect to ground.

VOLTAGE, CURRENT, AND RESISTANCE
Voltage, current, and resistance measurements are commonly required in electronics
work. The instrument used to measure voltage is a voltmeter, the instrument used to mea-
sure current is an ammeter, and the instrument used to measure resistance is an
ohmmeter. Commonly, all three instruments are combined into a single instrument called
a multimeter, in which you can choose what specific quantity to measure by selecting the
appropriate function with a switch.
Meter Symbols
Certain symbols can be used in circuits to represent meters, as shown in Figure 49. You
may see any of four types of symbols for voltmeters, ammeters, or ohmmeters, depend-
ing on which symbol most effectively conveys the information required. The digital 
meter symbol is used when specific values are to be indicated in a circuit. The bar graph
meter symbol and sometimes the analog meter symbol are used to illustrate the operation
of a circuit when relative measurements or changes in quantities, rather than specific val-
ues, need to be depicted. A changing quantity may be indicated by an arrow in the display
showing an increase or decrease. The generic symbol is used to indicate placement of 
meters in a circuit when no values or value changes need to be shown.

Figure 50 illustrates how to measure current with an ammeter. Part (a) shows a simple 
circuit in which the current through the resistor is to be measured. First make sure the range
setting of the ammeter is greater than the expected current and then connect the ammeter in
the current path by first opening the circuit, as shown in part (b). Then insert the meter as
shown in part (c). Such a connection is a series connection. The polarity of the meter must
be such that the current is in at the positive terminal and out at the negative terminal.

Measuring Voltage
To measure voltage, connect the voltmeter across the component for which the voltage is
to be found. Such a connection is a parallel connection. The negative terminal of the meter
must be connected to the negative side of the circuit, and the positive terminal of the meter
must be connected to the positive side of the circuit. Figure 51 shows a voltmeter con-
nected to measure the voltage across the resistor.
Never wear rings or any type of
metallic jewelry while working 
on a circuit. These items may
accidentally come in contact with

A DMM (digital multimeter) is a multifunction electronic instrument that can measure
voltage, current, and resistance. DMMs are the most widely used type of electronic meas-
uring instrument. Generally, DMMs provide more functions, better accuracy, greater ease
of reading, and greater reliability than do many analog meters. Analog meters have at least
one advantage over DMMs, however. They can track short-term variations and trends in a
measured quantity that many DMMs are too slow to respond to. Figure 53 shows typical
DMMs.

DMM Functions
The basic functions found on most DMMs include the following:
◆Ohms
◆DC voltage and current
◆AC voltage and current

VOLTAGE, CURRENT, AND RESISTANCE
Some DMMs provide special functions such as transistor or diode tests, power measure-
ment, and decibel measurement for audio amplifier tests. Some meters require manual
selection of the ranges for the functions. Many meters provide automatic range selection
and are called autoranging.
DMM Displays
DMMs are available with either LCD (liquid-crystal display) or LED
(light-emitting diode) readouts. The LCD is the most commonly used readout in battery-
powered instruments because it requires only very small amounts of current. A typical bat-
tery-powered DMM with an LCD readout operates on a 9 V battery that will last from a
few hundred hours to 2000 hours and more. The disadvantages of LCD readouts are that
(a) they are difficult or impossible to see in low-light conditions and (b) they are relatively
slow to respond to measurement changes. LEDs, on the other hand, can be seen in the dark
and respond quickly to changes in measured values. LED displays require much more cur-
rent than LCDs, and, therefore, battery life is shortened when LEDs are used in portable
equipment.
Both LCD and LED DMM displays are in a 7-segment format. Each digit in a display
consists of seven separate segments as shown in Figure 54(a). Each of the ten decimal 
digits is formed by the activation of appropriate segments, as illustrated in Figure 54(b). 
In addition to the seven segments, there is also a decimal point.
Manufacturers use the CE mark to
indicate that a product meets all
the essential requirements of the
European Directives for health
and safety. For example, DMMs
that meet the directive IEC 61010-1
are in compliance and can use the
CE mark on the DMM. This mark
is used on many products in
various countries much like the 
UL (underwriters lab) mark that
originated in the U.S. It also shows
compliance with safety standards.

Resolution
The resolution of a DMM is the smallest increment of a quantity that the
meter can measure. The smaller the increment, the better the resolution. One factor that de-
termines the resolution of a meter is the number of digits in the display.
Because many DMMs have 31⁄2 digits in their display, we will use this case for illus-
tration. A 31⁄2-digit multimeter has three digit positions that can indicate from 0 through
9, and one digit position that can indicate only a value of 0 or 1. This latter digit, called
the half-digit, is always the most significant digit in the display. For example, suppose
that a DMM is reading 0.999 V, as shown in Figure 55(a). If the voltage increases by
0.001 V to 1 V, the display correctly shows 1.000 V, as shown in part (b). The “1” is the
half-digit. Thus, with 31⁄2 digits, a variation of 0.001 V, which is the resolution, can be
observed.
Now, suppose that the voltage increases to 1.999 V. This value is indicated on the meter
as shown in Figure 55(c). If the voltage increases by 0.001 V to 2 V, the half-digit can-
not display the “2,” so the display shows 2.00. The half-digit is blanked and only three dig-
its are active, as indicated in part (d). With only three digits active, the resolution is 0.01 V
rather than 0.001 V as it is with 31⁄2 active digits. The resolution remains 0.01 V up to 19.99 V.
The resolution goes to 0.1 V for readings of 20.0 V to 199.9 V. At 200 V, the resolution
goes to 1 V, and so on.
The resolution capability of a DMM is also determined by the internal circuitry and the
rate at which the measured quantity is sampled. DMMs with displays of 41⁄2 through 81⁄2
digits are also available.
Accuracy
The accuracy is the degree to which a measured value represents the true or
accepted value of a quantity. The accuracy of a DMM is established strictly by its internal
circuitry and calibration. For typical DMMs, accuracies range from 0.01% to 0.5%, with
some precision laboratory-grade DMMs going to 0.002%.

Reading Analog Multimeters
Although the DMM is the predominate type of multimeter, you may occasionally have to use
an analog meter. A representation of a typical analog multimeter is shown in Figure 56.
This particular instrument can be used to measure both direct current (dc) and alternating
current (ac) quantities as well as resistance values. It has four selectable functions: dc volts
(DC VOLTS), dc milliamperes (DC mA), ac volts (AC VOLTS), and OHMS. Most analog
multimeters are similar to this one.

A typical analog multimeter.
Within each function there are several ranges, as indicated by the brackets around the se-
lector switch. For example, the DC VOLTS function has 0.3 V, 3 V, 12 V, 60 V, 300 V, and
600 V ranges. Thus, dc voltages from 0.3 V full-scale to 600 V full-scale can be measured.
On the DC mA function, direct currents from 0.06 mA full-scale to 120 mA full-scale can
be measured. On the ohm scale, the settings are

VOLTAGE, CURRENT, AND RESISTANCE
The Ohm Scale
Ohms are read on the top scale of the meter. This scale is nonlinear; that
is, the values represented by each division (large or small) vary as you go across the scale.
In Figure 56, notice how the scale becomes more compressed as you go from right to left.
To read the actual value in ohms, multiply the number on the scale as indicated by the
pointer by the factor selected by the switch. For example, when the switch is set at 
and the pointer is at 20, the reading is 
.
As another example, assume that the switch is at 
and the pointer is at the seventh
small division between the 1 and 2 marks, indicating 
Now, if the meter
remains connected to the same resistance and the switch setting is changed to 
the
pointer will move to the second small division between the 15 and 20 marks. This, of
course, is also a 
reading, illustrating that a given resistance value can often be read at
more than one range switch setting. However, the meter should be zeroed each time the
range is changed by touching the leads together and adjusting the needle.
The AC-DC and DC mA Scales
The second, third, and fourth scales from the top, labeled
“AC” and “DC,” are used in conjunction with the DC VOLTS and AC VOLTS functions.
The upper ac-dc scale ends at the 300 mark and is used with range settings, such as 0.3, 3,
and 300. For example, when the switch is at 3 on the DC VOLTS function, the 300 scale
has a full-scale value of 3 V; at the range setting of 300, the full-scale value is 300 V. The
middle ac-dc scale ends at 60. This scale is used in conjunction with range settings, such as
0.06, 60, and 600. For example, when the switch is at 60 on the DC VOLTS function, the
full-scale value is 60 V. The lower ac-dc scale ends at 12 and is used in conjunction with
switch settings, such as 1.2, 12, and 120. The three DC mA scales are used in a similar way
to measure current.

VOLTAGE, CURRENT, AND RESISTANCE
Electric Shock
Current through your body, not the voltage, is the cause of electrical shock. Of course, it
takes voltage across a resistance to produce current. When a point on your body comes in
contact with a voltage and another point comes in contact with a different voltage or with
ground, such as a metal chassis, there will be current through your body from one point to
the other. The path of the current depends on the points across which the voltage occurs.
The severity of the resulting electrical shock depends on the amount of voltage and the path
that the current takes through your body. The current path through the body determines
which tissues and organs will be affected.
Effects of Current on the Human Body
The amount of current is dependent on voltage
and resistance. The human body has resistance that depends on many factors, which in-
clude body mass, skin moisture, and points of contact of the body with a voltage potential.
Table 4 shows the effects for various values of current in milliamperes.
Body Resistance
Resistance of the human body is typically between 
and 
and depends on the two points between which it is measured. The moisture of the skin also
affects the resistance between two points. The resistance determines the amount of voltage

ELECTRICAL SAFETY
Safety is a major concern when working with electricity. The possibility of an electric
shock or a burn is always present, so caution should always be used. You provide a cur-
rent path when voltage is applied across two points on your body, and current produces
electrical shock. Electrical components often operate at high temperatures, so you can
sustain skin burns when you come in contact with them. Also, the presence of electricity
creates a potential fire hazard.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Recognize electrical hazards and practice proper safety procedures
◆Describe the cause of electrical shock
◆List the groups of current paths through the body
◆Discuss the effects of current on the human body
◆List the safety precautions that you should observe when you work with 
electricity
60

VOLTAGE, CURRENT, AND RESISTANCE
required to produce each of the effects listed in Table 4. For example, if you have a re-
sistance of 
between two given points on your body, 90 V across those two points
will produce enough current (9 mA) to cause painful shock.
Utility Voltages
We tend to take utility voltages for granted, but they can be and have been lethal. It is best
to be careful around any source of voltage (even low voltages can present a serious burn
hazard). As a general rule, you should avoid working on any energized circuit, and check
that the power is off with a known good meter. Most work in educational labs uses low volt-
ages, but you should still avoid touching any energized circuit. If you are working on a cir-
cuit that is connected to utility voltages, the service should be disconnected, a notice should
be placed on the equipment or place where the service is disconnected, and a padlock
should be used to prevent someone from accidentally turning on the power. This procedure
is called lockout/tagout and is widely used in industry. There are specific OSHA and industry
standards for lockout/tagout.
Most laboratory equipment is connected to the utility line (“ac”) and in North America,
this is 120 Vrms. A faulty piece of equipment can cause the “hot” lead to inadvertently be-
come exposed. You should inspect cords for exposed wires and check equipment for miss-
ing covers or other potential safety problems. The single-phase utility lines in homes and
electrical laboratories use three insulated wires that are referred to as the “hot” (black or red
wire), neutral (white wire), and safety ground (green wire). The hot and neutral wires will
have current, but the green safety line should never have current in normal operation. The
safety wire is connected to the metal exterior of encased equipment and is also connected
to conduit and the metal boxes for housing receptacles. Figure 58(a) shows the location of
these conductors on a standard receptacle. Notice that the neutral line is larger than the hot
line.
The safety ground should be connected to the neutral at the service panel. The metal
chassis of an instrument or appliance is also connected to ground. In the event that the hot
wire is accidentally in contact with ground, the resulting high current should trip the circuit
breaker or open a fuse to remove the hazard. However, a broken or missing ground lead
may not have high current until it is contacted by a person. This danger is one obvious
reason for ensuring that line cords have not been altered by removing the ground pin.
Many circuits are further protected with a special device called a ground-fault circuit in-
terrupter (GFCI, which is sometimes called just GFI). If a fault occurs in a GFCI circuit, a
sensor detects that the current in the hot line and the neutral line are not equal as they
should be and trips the circuit breaker. The GFCI breaker is very fast acting and can trip
faster than the breaker on the main panel. GFCI breakers are required in areas where a

Receptacle testers are designed for
use with specific receptacle types
including specialized outlets. They
can pinpoint problems such as

results with a lighted LED or neon

to test ground fault circuit

shock hazard exists such as wherever there is water or moisture. Pools, bathrooms,
kitchens, basements, and garages should all have GFCI outlets. Figure 58(b) shows a
ground-fault receptacle with reset and test buttons. When the test button is pressed, the
circuit should immediately be opened. The reset button restores power.
Safety Precautions
There are many practical things that you should do when you work with electrical and elec-
tronic equipment. Some important precautions are listed here.
◆Avoid contact with any voltage source. Turn power off before you work on circuits
when touching circuit parts is required.
◆Do not work alone. A telephone should be available for emergencies.
◆Do not work when tired or taking medications that make you drowsy.
◆Remove rings, watches, and other metallic jewelry when you work on circuits.
◆Do not work on equipment until you know proper procedures and are aware of po-
tential hazards.
◆Make sure power cords are in good condition and grounding pins are not missing or bent.
◆Keep your tools properly maintained. Make sure the insulation on metal tool handles
is in good condition.
◆Handle tools properly and maintain a neat work area.
◆Wear safety glasses when appropriate, particularly when soldering and clipping wires.
◆Always shut off power and discharge capacitors before you touch any part of a cir-
cuit with your hands.
◆Know the location of the emergency power-off switch and emergency exits.
◆Never try to override or tamper with safety devices such as an interlock switch.
◆Always wear shoes and keep them dry. Do not stand on metal or wet floors when
working on electrical circuits.
◆Never handle instruments when your hands are wet.
◆Never assume that a circuit is off. Double-check it with a reliable meter before handling.
◆Set the limiter on electronic power supplies to prevent currents larger than necessary
to supply the circuit under test.

A GFCI outlet does not prevent

are touching the hot and neutral
wires without being grounded, no
ground fault is detected and the
GFCI breaker will not trip. In
another case, the GFCI may
prevent electrocution but not the
initial electric shock before it

shock could cause a secondary
injury, such as a fall.

VOLTAGE, CURRENT, AND RESISTANCE
◆Some devices such as capacitors can store a lethal charge for long periods after power
is removed. They must be properly discharged before you work with them.
◆When making circuit connections, always make the connection to the point with the
highest voltage as your last step.
◆Avoid contact with the terminals of power supplies.
◆Always use wires with insulation and connectors or clips with insulating shrouds.
◆Keep cables and wires as short as possible. Connect polarized components properly.
◆Be aware of and follow all workplace and laboratory rules. Do not have drinks or
food near equipment.
◆If another person cannot let go of an energized conductor, switch the power off im-
mediately. If that is not possible, use any available nonconductive material to try to
separate the body from the contact.
◆Use a lockout/tagout procedure to avoid someone turning power on while you are
working on a circuit.

Application Activity
In this application activity, a dc volt-
age is applied to a circuit in order to
produce current through a lamp to 
provide light. You will see how the
current is controlled by resistance. The circuit simulates an in-
strument panel illumination circuit, which allows you to increase
or decrease the amount of light on the instruments.
The instrument panel illumination circuit operates from a 
12 V battery that is the voltage source for the circuit. The circuit
uses a potentiometer connected as a rheostat, controlled by a
knob on the instrument panel, which is used to set the amount of
current through the lamp to back-light the instruments. The
brightness of the lamp is proportional to the amount of current
through the lamp. The switch used to turn the lamp on and off is
the same one used for the headlights. There is a fuse for circuit
protection in case of a short circuit.
Figure 59 shows the schematic for the illumination circuit,
and Figure 60 shows the breadboarded circuit. A laboratory dc
power supply is used in the place of an actual battery. The proto-
board in Figure 60 is a type that is commonly used for con-
structing circuits on the test bench.

SUMMARY
◆An atom is the smallest particle of an element that retains the characteristics of that element.
◆When electrons in the outer orbit of an atom (valence electrons) break away, they become free
electrons.
◆Free electrons make current possible.
66

VOLTAGE, CURRENT, AND RESISTANCE
◆Like charges repel each other, and opposite charges attract each other.
◆Voltage must be applied to a circuit to produce current.
◆Resistance limits the current.
◆Basically, an electric circuit consists of a source, a load, and a current path.
◆An open circuit is one in which the current path is broken.
◆A closed circuit is one which has a complete current path.
◆An ammeter is connected in line with the current path.
◆A voltmeter is connected across the current path.
◆An ohmmeter is connected across a resistor (resistor must be disconnected from circuit).
◆One coulomb is the charge of 
electrons.

APPLICATION ACTIVITY PREVIEW
In this application activity, you will see how Ohm’s law is
used in a practical circuit. The circuit is an array of switch-
selectable resistors of various values used to control the
speed of a fan. The resistance values will be determined
based on fan motor data and by the application of Ohm’s
law. A test procedure will be developed once the modifica-

INTRODUCTION
You should already be familiar with the concepts of voltage,
current, and resistance. In this chapter, you will learn how
voltage, current, and resistance are interrelated. You will
also learn how to analyze a simple electric circuit.
Ohm’s law is perhaps the single most important tool for
the analysis of electric circuits, and you must know how to
apply it.
In 1826 Georg Simon Ohm found that current, voltage,
and resistance are related in a specific and predictable way.
Ohm expressed this relationship with a formula that is
known today as Ohm’s law. In this chapter, you will learn
Ohm’s law and how to use it in solving circuit problems. A
general approach to troubleshooting using an analysis, plan-
ning, and measurement (APM) approach is also introduced.

OHM’S LAW
Ohm determined experimentally that if the voltage across a resistor is increased, the cur-
rent through the resistor will also increase; and, likewise, if the voltage is decreased, the
current will decrease. For example, if the voltage is doubled, the current will double. If
the voltage is halved, the current will also be halved. This relationship is illustrated in
Figure 1, with relative meter indications of voltage and current.

THE RELATIONSHIP OF CURRENT, VOLTAGE, AND RESISTANCE
Ohm’s law describes mathematically how voltage, current, and resistance in a circuit
are related. Ohm’s law is expressed in three equivalent forms depending on which
quantity you need to determine. As you will learn, current and voltage are linearly
proportional. However, current and resistance are inversely proportional.
After completing this section, you should be able to

Ohm also determined that if the voltage is held constant, less resistance results in more
current, and, also, more resistance results in less current. For example, if the resistance is
halved, the current doubles. If the resistance is doubled, the current is halved. This concept
is illustrated by the meter indications in Figure 2, where the resistance is increased and 
the voltage is held constant.

OHM’S LAW
Ohm’s law states that current is directly proportional to voltage and inversely propor-
tional to resistance. The circuits in Figures 1 and 2 illustrate Ohm’s law, which is 
given in the following formula:
where I is current in amperes (A), V is voltage in volts (V), and R is resistance in ohms 
For a constant value of R, if the value of V is increased, the value of I increases; if V is de-
creased, I decreases. If V is constant and R is increased, I decreases. Similarly, if V is con-
stant and R is decreased, I increases.
Using Equation 1, you can calculate the current if you know the values of voltage and re-
sistance. By manipulating Equation 1, you can obtain expressions for voltage and resistance.
With Equation 2, you can calculate voltage if you know the values of current and resistance.
With Equation 3, you can calculate resistance if you know the values of voltage and current.
The three expressions—Equations 1, 2 and 3—are all equivalent. They are simply three
ways of stating Ohm’s law.
The Linear Relationship of Current and Voltage
In resistive circuits, current and voltage are linearly proportional. Linear means that if one
of the quantities is increased or decreased by a certain percentage, the other will increase
or decrease by the same percentage, assuming that the resistance is constant in value. For
example, if the voltage across a resistor is tripled, the current will triple.

OHM’S LAW
Let’s take a constant value of resistance, for example, 
and calculate the current for
several values of voltage ranging from 10 V to 100 V in the circuit in Figure 4(a). The 
current values obtained are shown in Figure 4(b). The graph of the I values versus the V
values is shown in Figure 4(c). Note that it is a straight line graph. This graph tells us that
a change in voltage results in a linearly proportional change in current. No matter what
value R is, assuming that R is constant, the graph of I versus V will always be a straight line.

Graph of current versus voltage for the circuit in part (a).
Assume that you are measuring the current in a circuit that is operating with 25 V. The
ammeter reads 50 mA. Later, you notice that the current has dropped to 40 mA. As-
suming that the resistance did not change, you must conclude that the voltage source
has changed. How much has the voltage changed, and what is its new value?
Solution
The current has dropped from 50 mA to 40 mA, which is a decrease of 20%. Since the
voltage is linearly proportional to the current, the voltage has decreased by the same
percentage that the current did. Taking 20% of 25 V, you get
Subtract this change from the original voltage to get the new voltage.
Notice that you did not need the resistance value in order to find the new voltage.
Related Problem
If the current drops to 0 A under the same conditions stated in the example, what is the
voltage?
New voltage = 25 V - 5 V = 20 V
Change in voltage = (0.2)(25 V) = 5 V
EXAMPLE 2
The Inverse Relationship of Current and Resistance
As you have seen, current varies inversely with resistance as expressed by Ohm’s law,
When the resistance is reduced, the current goes up; when the resistance is
increased, the current goes down. For example, if the source voltage is held constant and the
resistance is halved, the current doubles in value; when the resistance is doubled, the current
is reduced by half.
Let’s take a constant value of voltage, for example, 10 V, and calculate the current for
several values of resistance ranging from 
to 100

sion voltages generated by the power companies may be as high as 345,000 V (345 kV).

OHM’S LAW
Troubleshooting is the application of logical thinking combined with a thorough
knowledge of circuit or system operation to correct a malfunction. The basic approach to
troubleshooting consists of three steps: analysis, planning, and measuring. We will refer to
this 3–step approach as APM.
Analysis
The first step in troubleshooting a circuit is to analyze clues or symptoms of the failure. The
analysis can begin by determining the answer to certain questions:
1. Has the circuit ever worked?
2. If the circuit once worked, under what conditions did it fail?
3. What are the symptoms of the failure?
4. What are the possible causes of failure?
Planning
The second step in the troubleshooting process, after analyzing the clues, is formulating a
logical plan of attack. Much time can be saved by proper planning. A working knowledge
of the circuit is a prerequisite to a plan for troubleshooting. If you are not certain how the
circuit is supposed to operate, take time to review circuit diagrams (schematics), operating
instructions, and other pertinent information. A schematic with proper voltages marked at
various test points is particularly useful. Although logical thinking is perhaps the most
important tool in troubleshooting, it rarely can solve the problem by itself.
In Problems, 1–5, calculate R.
1. V  10 V and I  2.13 A.
2. V  270 V and I  10 A.
3. V  20 kV and I  5.13 A.
4. V  15 V and I  2.68 mA.
5. V  5 V and I  2.27 A.
6. You have a resistor across which you measure 25 V, and your ammeter indicates
53.2 mA of current. What is the resistor’s value in kilohms? In ohms?

INTRODUCTION TO TROUBLESHOOTING
Technicians must be able to diagnose and repair malfunctioning circuits and systems.
In this section, you learn a general approach to troubleshooting using a simple 
example. 
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Describe a basic approach to troubleshooting
◆List three steps in troubleshooting
◆Explain what is meant by half-splitting
◆Discuss and compare the three basic measurements of voltage, current, 
and resistance
91

OHM’S LAW
Measuring
The third step is to narrow the possible failures by making carefully thought out measure-
ments. These measurements usually confirm the direction you are taking in solving the
problem, or they may point to a new direction that you should take. Occasionally, you may
find a totally unexpected result.
An APM Example
The thought process that is part of the APM approach can be illustrated with a simple
example. Suppose you have a string of 8 decorative 12 V bulbs connected in series to a
120 V source 
as shown in Figure 15. Assume that this circuit worked properly at one
time but stopped working after it was moved to a new location. When plugged in at the new
location, the lamps fail to turn on. How do you go about finding the trouble?

 FIGURE 15
A string of bulbs connected to a
voltage source.
The Analysis Thought Process
You may think like this as you proceed to analyze the
situation:
◆Since the circuit worked before it was moved, the problem could be that there is no
voltage at the new location.
◆Perhaps the wiring was loose and pulled apart when moved.
◆It is possible that a bulb is burned out or loose in its socket.
With this reasoning, you have considered possible causes and failures that may have
occurred. The thought process continues:
◆The fact that the circuit once worked eliminates the possibility that the original cir-
cuit was improperly wired.
◆If the fault is due to an open path, it is unlikely that there is more than one break
which could be either a bad connection or a burned out bulb.
You have now analyzed the problem and are ready to plan the process of finding the fault
in the circuit.
The Planning Thought Process
The first part of your plan is to measure for voltage at
the new location. If the voltage is present, then the problem is in the string of lights. If volt-
age is not present, check the circuit breaker at the distribution box in the house. Before
resetting breakers, you should think about why a breaker may be tripped. Let’s assume that
you find the voltage is present. This means that the problem is in the string of lights.
The second part of your plan is to measure either the resistance in the string of lights or
to measure voltages across the bulbs. The decision whether to measure resistance or volt-
age is a toss-up and can be made based on the ease of making the test. Seldom is a trou-
bleshooting plan developed so completely that all possible contingencies are included. You
will frequently need to modify the plan as you go along.
The Measurement Process
You proceed with the first part of your plan by using a mul-
timeter to check the voltage at the new location. Assume the measurement shows a voltage
92

OHM’S LAW
of 120 V. Now you have eliminated the possibility of no voltage. You know that, since you
have voltage across the string and there is no current because no bulb is on, there must be
an open in the current path. Either a bulb is burned out, a connection at the lamp socket is
broken, or the wire is broken.
Next, you decide to locate the break by measuring resistance with your multimeter. Ap-
plying logical thinking, you decide to measure the resistance of each half of the string in-
stead of measuring the resistance of each bulb. By measuring the resistance of half the
bulbs at once, you can usually reduce the effort required to find the open. This technique is
a type of troubleshooting procedure called half-splitting.
Once you have identified the half in which the open occurs, as indicated by an infinite
resistance, you use half-splitting again on the faulty half and continue until you narrow the
fault down to a faulty bulb or connection. This process is shown in Figure 16, assuming for
purposes of illustration that the seventh bulb is burned out.
A good resistance reading indicates
this part of the circuit is OK.

bulbs is open.

reading indicates this
part of the circuit is OK.
 FIGURE 16
Illustration of the half-splitting method of troubleshooting. The numbered steps indicate the
sequence in which the multimeter is moved from one position to another.
As you can see in the figure, the half-splitting approach in this particular case takes a
maximum of five measurements to identify the open bulb. If you had decided to measure
each bulb individually and had started at the left, you would have needed seven measure-
ments. Sometimes half-splitting saves steps; sometimes it doesn’t. The number of steps re-
quired depends on where you make your measurements and in what sequence.
Unfortunately, most troubleshooting is more difficult than this example. However,
analysis and planning are essential for effective troubleshooting in any situation. As meas-
urements are made, the plan is often modified; the experienced troubleshooter narrows the
search by fitting the symptoms and measurements into a probable cause. In some cases,
low-cost equipment is simply discarded when troubleshooting and repair costs are compa-
rable to replacement costs.
Comparison of V, R, and I Measurements
You can measure voltage, current, or resistance in a circuit. To measure voltage, place the
voltmeter in parallel across the component; that is, place one lead on each side of the com-
ponent. This makes voltage measurements the easiest of the three types of measurements.
To measure resistance, connect the ohmmeter across a component; however, the volt-
age must be first disconnected, and sometimes the component itself must be removed
from the circuit. Therefore, resistance measurements are generally more difficult than
voltage measurements.
93

OHM’S LAW
To measure current, place the ammeter in series with the component; that is, the amme-
ter must be in line with the current path. To do this you must disconnect a component lead
or a wire before you connect the ammeter. This usually makes a current measurement the
most difficult to perform.

Application Activity
In this application, a resistive circuit is
developed for controlling the speed of
a small dc motor used to drive a fan
for cooling electronic equipment
mounted in a cabinet. One way to control the speed of a dc motor
is to connect a resistor to the motor, as shown in Figure 17. 
The resistor reduces the current to the motor and therefore
reduces its speed. This method is only recommended for small
motors because energy is wasted in the resistance, and the over-
all efficiency is low.
The application requires four distinct switchable speeds.
Your job is to develop a schematic, determine the values for the
required resistors, and prepare a test procedure for the circuit.
You will apply Ohm’s law in order to complete the assignment.
Motor data in graphical form is provided in Figure 19.
Specifications
◆
Each resistor is switch selectable from a rotary switch, so
that only one resistor is connected to the motor at a time.
◆
The four approximate speed settings are 800 rpm, 600 rpm,
400 rpm, and 200 rpm.
◆
The motor is rated for a maximum of 12 V at 800 rpm.
◆
The circuit board is to be connected to a 12 V dc source
and to the fan motor with wiring that is available inside the
cabinet.
Resistance Calculations
The resistor box has been prepared with speed-value labels and
the PC board has been prepared as shown in Figure 20.
1. Use the graphical motor data in Figure 19 and Ohm’s law 
to determine the nearest standard resistor values needed for
the project. Hint: To find the voltage across the resistor, 
subtract the motor voltage, 
from 12 V. This is based on
Kirchhoff’s law.
VM,
VR,
A circuit is required that will allow a selection of four motor
speeds. The control circuit is to be mounted in a small box that
will be attached to the equipment cabinet to control the fan
motor speed, as shown in Figure 18.

INTRODUCTION
You know the relationship of current, voltage, and resistance
as stated by Ohm’s law. The existence of these three quanti-
ties in an electric circuit results in the fourth basic quantity
known as power. A specific relationship exists between
power and I, V, and R.
Energy is the ability to do work, and power is the rate 
at which energy is used. Current carries electrical energy
through a circuit. As the free electrons pass through the
resistance of the circuit, they give up their energy when they
collide with atoms in the resistive material. The electrical
energy given up by the electrons is converted into heat
energy. The rate at which the electrical energy is used is the
power in the circuit.
106

ENERGY AND POWER
Energy is the ability to do work, and power is the rate at which energy is used.
Power (P) is a certain amount of energy (W) used in a certain length of time (t), expressed
as follows:
where P is power in watts (W), W is energy in joules (J), and t is time in seconds (s). Note
that an italic W is used to represent energy in the form of work and a nonitalic W is used
for watts, the unit of power. The joule (J) is the SI unit of energy.
Energy in joules divided by time in seconds gives power in watts. For example, if 50 J
of energy are used in 2 s, the power is 50 J/2 
W. By definition,
One watt (W) is the amount of power when one joule of energy is used in one
second.
Thus, the number of joules used in one second is always equal to the number of watts.
For example, if 75 J are used in 1 s, the power is 
Amounts of power much less than one watt are common in certain areas of electronics.
As with small current and voltage values, metric prefixes are used to designate small
amounts of power. Thus, milliwatts (mW), microwatts 
and even picowatts (pW) are
commonly found in some applications.
In the electrical utilities field, kilowatts (kW) and megawatts (MW) are common units.
Radio and television stations also use large amounts of power to transmit signals. Electric
motors are commonly rated in horsepower (hp) where 
Since power is the rate at which energy is used, as expressed in Equation 1, power uti-
lized over a period of time represents energy consumption. If you multiply power in watts
and time in seconds, you have energy in joules, symbolized by W.
W = Pt
1 hp = 746 W.

ENERGY AND POWER
When there is current through a resistance, electrical energy is converted to heat or
other form of energy, such as light. A common example of this is a light bulb that
becomes too hot to touch. The current through the filament that produces light also
produces unwanted heat because the filament has resistance. Electrical components
must be able to dissipate a certain amount of energy in a given period of time.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Define energy and power
◆Express power in terms of energy
◆State the unit of power
◆State the common units of energy
◆Perform energy and power calculations
Watt was a Scottish inventor 
and was well known for his
improvements to the steam engine
that made it practical for industrial
use. Watt patented several
inventions, including the rotary
engine. The unit of power is
named in his honor. (Photo credit:

ENERGY AND POWER
The Kilowatt-hour (kWh) Unit of Energy
The joule has been defined as a unit of energy. However, there is another way to express
energy. Since power is expressed in watts and time in seconds, units of energy called the
watt-second (Ws), watt-hour (Wh), and kilowatt-hour (kWh) can be used.
When you pay your electric bill, you are charged on the basis of the amount of energy
you use, not the power. Because power companies deal in huge amounts of energy, the most
practical unit is the kilowatt-hour. You use a kilowatt-hour of energy when you use one
thousand watts of power for one hour. For example, a 100 W light bulb burning for 10 h
uses 1 kWh of energy.
W = Pt = (100 W)(10 h) = 1000 Wh = 1 kWh

POWER IN AN ELECTRIC CIRCUIT
The generation of heat, which occurs when electrical energy is converted to heat en-
ergy, in an electric circuit is often an unwanted by-product of current through the re-
sistance in the circuit. In some cases, however, the generation of heat is the primary
purpose of a circuit as, for example, in an electric resistive heater. In any case, you
must frequently deal with power in electrical and electronic circuits.

where P is in watts when V is in volts and I is in amperes. You can obtain another equiva-

The relationships between power and current, voltage, and resistance expressed in the

ENERGY AND POWER
The power rating is the maximum amount of power that a resistor can dissipate without
being damaged by excessive heat buildup. The power rating is not related to the ohmic value
(resistance) but rather is determined mainly by the physical composition, size, and shape of
the resistor. All else being equal, the larger the surface area of a resistor, the more power it
can dissipate. The surface area of a cylindrically shaped resistor is equal to the length (l)
times the circumference (c), as indicated in Figure 4. The area of the ends is not included.

Metal-film resistors are available in standard power ratings from 1⁄8 W to 1 W, as shown in
Figure 5. Available power ratings for other types of resistors vary. For example, wirewound 
resistors have ratings up to 225 W or greater. Figure 6 shows some of these resistors.

The power rating of a resistor is 
directly related to its surface area.
When a resistor is used in a circuit, its power rating must be greater than the maxi-
mum power that it will have to handle. For example, if a resistor is to dissipate 0.75 W
in a circuit application, its rating should be at least the next higher standard value
which is 1 W. A rating larger than the actual power should be used when possible as a
safety margin.
Choose an adequate power rating for each of the metal-film resistors in Figure 7

Sometimes an overheated resistor
is due to another failure in the
circuit. After replacing a heat-
damaged resistor and before
restoring power, check for visual
faults that may cause excessive
current, such as a short between
two conductors.
112

ENERGY AND POWER
When the power in a resistor is greater than its rating, the resistor will become exces-
sively hot. As a result, the resistor may burn open or its resistance value may change.
A resistor that has been damaged because of overheating can often be detected by the
charred or altered appearance of its surface. If there is no visual evidence, a resistor that is
suspected of being damaged can be checked with an ohmmeter for an open or incorrect
resistance value. Recall that one or both leads of a resistor should be removed from a circuit
to measure resistance.
Checking a Resistor with an Ohmmeter
A typical digital multimeter and an analog multimeter are shown in Figures 8(a) and 
8(b), respectively. For the digital meter in Figure 8(a), you use the round function 
switch to select ohms 
You do not have to manually select a range because this partic-
ular meter is autoranging and you have a direct digital readout of the resistance value. The
large round switch on the analog meter is called a range switch. Notice the resistance
(OHMS) settings on both meters.
For the analog meter in part (b), each setting indicates the amount by which the ohms
scale (top scale) on the meter is to be multiplied. For example, if the pointer is at 50 on the

ENERGY AND POWER
Figure 10 illustrates charge in the form of electrons flowing from the negative terminal 
of a battery, through a circuit, and back to the positive terminal. As they emerge from the neg-
ative terminal, the electrons are at their highest energy level. The electrons flow through each
of the resistors that are connected together to form a current path (this type of connection is
called series). As the electrons flow through each resistor, some of their energy is given up in
the form of heat. Therefore, the electrons have more energy when they enter a resistor than
when they exit the resistor, as illustrated in the figure by the decrease in the intensity of the
red color. When they have traveled through the circuit back to the positive terminal of the 
battery, the electrons are at their lowest energy level.

ENERGY CONVERSION AND VOLTAGE DROP IN RESISTANCE
As you have learned, when there is current through a resistance, electrical energy is
converted to heat energy. This heat is caused by collisions of the free electrons within
the atomic structure of the resistive material. When a collision occurs, heat is given off;
and the electron gives up some of its acquired energy as it moves through the material.
After completing this section, you should be able to

A loss of energy by electrons (charge)
as they flow through a resistance
creates a voltage drop because
voltage equals energy divided by
charge.
Recall that voltage equals energy per charge 
and charge is a property of
electrons. Based on the voltage of the battery, a certain amount of energy is imparted to all
of the electrons that flow out of the negative terminal. The same number of electrons flow
at each point throughout the circuit, but their energy decreases as they move through the
resistance of the circuit.
In Figure 10, the voltage at the left end of

the right end of

The same number of electrons that enter 
also exit
so Q is constant. However, the energy 
is less than

is less
negative (or more positive) than the voltage at the left end. The voltage drop is indicated by
 and  signs (the  implies a less negative or more positive voltage). For conventional
current direction, a voltage drop is defined to be from positive () to negative (), which
is the opposite of that for electron flow.

POWER SUPPLIES AND BATTERIES
Power supplies and batteries are types of voltage sources. A power supply is generally 
defined as an electronic device that converts ac (alternating current) from the utility lines
to a dc (direct current) voltage that virtually all electronic circuits and some transducers
require. Batteries are also capable of supplying dc; in fact, many systems, such as laptop
computers, can run from a power supply or internal battery. In this section, both types of
voltage sources are described.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Discuss characteristics of power supplies and batteries
◆Describe controls on typical laboratory power supplies
◆Determine the efficiency of a power supply given the input and output power
◆Define ampere-hour rating of batteries
Utilities universally have adopted ac for transmitting electricity from the generating sta-
tion to the user because it can be readily transformed to high voltages for transmission and
low voltages for the end user. High voltages are much more efficient and cost-effective to
transmit over long distances. In the United States, the standard voltage supplied to outlets
is approximately 120 V or 240 V at 60 Hz, but in Europe and other countries, the outlet
voltage is 240 V at 50 Hz.
Virtually all electronic systems require stable dc for the integrated circuits and other de-
vices to work properly. Power supplies fulfill this function by converting ac to stable dc and
are usually built into the product. Many electronic systems have a recessed and protected
switch that allows the internal power supply to be set for either the 120 V standard or for
the 240 V standard. That switch must be set correctly, or serious damage can occur to the
equipment.
In the laboratory, circuits are developed and tested. The purpose of a laboratory power
supply is to provide the required stable dc to the circuit under test. The test circuit can be
anything from a simple resistive network to a complex amplifier or logic circuit. To meet
the requirement for a constant voltage, with almost no noise or ripple, laboratory power
supplies are regulated, meaning the output is constantly sensed and automatically adjusted
if it tries to change because of a change in the line voltage or the load.
Many circuits require multiple voltages, as well as the ability to set the voltage to a pre-
cise value or change it a small amount for testing. For this reason, laboratory power sup-
plies usually have two or three outputs that are independent of each other and can be controlled
116

ENERGY AND POWER
separately. Output metering is normally part of a good laboratory power supply, in order to
set and monitor the output voltage or current. Control may include fine and coarse controls
or digital inputs to set precise voltages.
Figure 11 shows a triple output bench supply such as the type used in many electronic 
laboratories. The model shown has two 0–30 V independent supplies and a 6.5 V high 
current supply (commonly referred to a logic supply). Voltages can be precisely set using
coarse and fine controls. The 0–30 V supplies have floating outputs, meaning they are not
referenced to ground. This allows the user to set them up as a positive or negative supply or
even connect them to another external supply. Another feature of this supply is that it can
be set up as a current source, with a maximum voltage set for constant current applications.
 FIGURE 11
A triple output power supply. 
(Courtesy BK Precision)
As in many power supplies, there are three output jacks for each of the 0–30 V supplies.
The output is taken between the red (more positive) and black terminals. The green jack is ref-
erenced to the chassis, which is earth ground, and can be connected to either the red or black
jacks. In addition, current and voltage can be monitored using the built-in digital meters.
The power delivered by a power supply is the product of the absolute voltage and cur-
rent. For example, if a power supply is providing -15.0 V at 3.0 A, the supplied power is
45 W. For a triple output supply, the total power supplied by all three supplies is the sum of
the power from each one individually.
What is the total power delivered by a triple output power supply if the output voltage
and current are as follows?
Source 1: 18 V at 2.0 A
Source 2: 18 V at 1.5 A
Source 3: 5.0 V at 1.0 A
Solution
Power delivered from each supply is the product of voltage and current (ignoring the
sign).

How will the total power delivered change if the current from Source 1 increases to 2.5 A?
PT = P1 + P2 + P3 = 36 W + 27 W + 5.0 W = 68 W
P3 = V3I3 = (5.0 V)(1.0 A) = 5.0 W
P2 = V2I2 = (18 V)(1.5 A) = 27 W
P1 = V1I1 = (18 V)(2.0 A) = 36 W

ENERGY AND POWER
Power Supply Efficiency
An important characteristic of electronic power supplies is efficiency. Efficiency is the
ratio of the output power delivered to a load to the input power to a circuit.
Efficiency is often expressed as a percentage. For example, if the input power is 100 W and
the output power is 50 W, the efficiency is 
All electronic power supplies require that power be put into them. For example, an elec-
tronic power supply generally uses the ac power from a wall outlet as its input. Its output is
usually a regulated dc voltage. The output power is always less than the input power be-
cause some of the total power must be used internally to operate the power supply circuitry.
This internal power dissipation is normally called the power loss. The output power is the
input power minus the power loss.
High efficiency means that very little power is dissipated in the power supply and there is
a higher proportion of output power for a given input power.
POUT = PIN - PLOSS
(50 W/100 W) * 100% = 50%.

Ampere-Hour Ratings of Batteries
Batteries convert stored chemical energy to electrical energy. They are widely used to
power small systems, such as laptop computers and cell phones, to supply the stable dc
required. The batteries used in these small systems are normally rechargeable, mean-
ing that the chemical reaction can be reversed from an external source. The capacity
for any battery is measured in ampere-hours (Ah). For a rechargeable battery, the Ah
rating is the capacity before it needs to be recharged. The ampere-hour rating deter-
mines the length of time a battery can deliver a certain amount of current at the rated
voltage.
A rating of one ampere-hour means that a battery can deliver an average of one ampere
of current to a load for one hour at the rated voltage output. This same battery can deliver
an average of two amperes for one-half hour. The more current the battery is required to
deliver, the shorter the life of the battery. In practice, a battery usually is rated for a speci-
fied current level and output voltage. For example, a 12 V automobile battery may be rated
for 70 Ah at 3.5 A. This means that it can produce an average of 3.5 A for 20 h at the rated
voltage.

Application Activity
In this application, a resistive circuit is
developed for controlling the speed of
a small dc motor used to drive a fan
for cooling electronic equipment
mounted in a cabinet. One way to control the speed of a dc motor
is to connect a resistor to the motor, as shown in Figure 14. 
The resistor reduces the current to the motor and therefore
reduces its speed. This method is only recommended for small
motors because energy is wasted in the resistance, and the over-
all efficiency is low.
The application requires four distinct switchable speeds.
Your job is to develop a schematic, determine the values for the
required resistors, and prepare a test procedure for the circuit.
You will apply Ohm’s law in order to complete the assignment.
Motor data in graphical form is provided in Figure 16.
Specifications
◆
Each resistor is switch selectable from a rotary switch, so
that only one resistor is connected to the motor at a time.
◆
The four approximate speed settings are 800 rpm, 600 rpm,
400 rpm, and 200 rpm.
◆
The motor is rated for a maximum of 12 V at 800 rpm.
◆
The circuit board is to be connected to a 12 V dc source
and to the fan motor with wiring that is available inside the
cabinet.
Resistance Calculations
The resistor box has been prepared with speed-value labels and
the PC board has been prepared as shown in Figure 17.
1. Use the graphical motor data in Figure 16 and Ohm’s law 
to determine the nearest standard resistor values needed for
the project. Hint: To find the voltage across the resistor, 
subtract the motor voltage, 
from 12 V. This is based on
Kirchhoff’s law.
VM,
VR,
A circuit is required that will allow a selection of four motor
speeds. The control circuit is to be mounted in a small box that
will be attached to the equipment cabinet to control the fan
motor speed, as shown in Figure 15.

INTRODUCTION
In this chapter, the concepts of Ohm’s law and power in re-
Resistive circuits can be of two basic forms: series and
parallel. In this chapter, series circuits are studied. You will
see how Ohm’s law is used in series circuits; and you will
learn another important circuit law, Kirchhoff’s voltage law.
Also, several applications of series circuits, including voltage
dividers, are presented.
When resistors are connected in series and a voltage is
applied across the series connection, there is only one path for
current; therefore, each resistor in series has the same amount
of current through it. All of the resistances in series add
together to produce a total resistance. The voltage drops
across each of the resistors add up to the voltage applied
across the entire series connection.
sistor  are applied to circuits in which resistors are con-
nected in a series arrangement.

for current.

When a voltage source is connected between point A and B, the only way for current to
get from one point to the other in any of the connections of Figure 1 is to go through each
of the resistors. The following statement describes a series circuit:
A series circuit provides only one path for current between two points so that the
current is the same through each series resistor.
In an actual circuit diagram, a series circuit may not always be as easy to visually iden-
tify as those in Figure 1. For example, Figure 2 shows series resistors drawn in other 
ways with voltage applied. Remember, if there is only one current path between two
points, the resistors between those two points are in series, no matter how they appear in
a diagram.

Series Resistor Values Add
When resistors are connected in series, the resistor values add because each resistor offers op-
position to the current in direct proportion to its resistance. A greater number of resistors con-
nected in series creates more opposition to current. More opposition to current implies a higher
value of resistance. Thus, every time a resistor is added in series, the total resistance increases.
Figure 7 illustrates how series resistances add to increase the total resistance. Part (a)

resistor. Part (b) shows another 
resistor connected in series with the

Note in Figure 8 that the order in which the resistances are added does not matter. You 
can physically change the positions of the resistors in the circuit without affecting the total
resistance or the current.

Equal-Value Series Resistors
When a circuit has more than one resistor of the same value in series, there is a shortcut

of equal-value resistors that are in series. This method is essentially the same as adding the
values. For example, five 
resistors in series have an 
of

SERIES CIRCUITS
Figure 13 shows three resistors connected in series to a dc voltage source. At any 
point in this circuit, the current into that point must equal the current out of that point, as
illustrated by the current directional arrows. Notice also that the current out of each resis-
tor must equal the current into each resistor because there is no place where part of the cur-
rent can branch off and go somewhere else. Therefore, the current in each section of the

SERIES CIRCUITS
The following are key points to remember when you analyze series circuits:
1. Current through any of the series resistors is the same as the total current.
2. If you know the total applied voltage and the total resistance, you can determine the
total current by Ohm’s law.
3. If you know the voltage drop across one of the series resistors 
you can deter-
mine the total current by Ohm’s law.
4. If you know the total current, you can find the voltage drop across any of the series
resistors by Ohm’s law.
5. The polarity of a voltage drop across a resistor is positive at the end of the resistor
that is closest to the positive terminal of the voltage source.
6. The current through a resistor is defined to be in a direction from the positive end
of the resistor to the negative end.
7. An open in a series circuit prevents current; and, therefore, there is zero voltage
drop across each series resistor. The total voltage appears across the points between
which there is an open.

Series connections often involve using resistance to limit current to some level. For
example, it is necessary to limit current to a light-emitting diode (LED) to prevent the
LED from burning out. The circuit in Figure 20 shows a basic application, where a 
red LED is used as an indicator as part of a more complicated circuit. The rheostat is
included to dim the LED depending on ambient conditions. We will focus on these
two current-limiting resistors.

A red LED will always have a voltage across it of about 
1.7 V when it is on
and working within its normal operating range. The remaining voltage from the
power supply will be across the two series resistors. Together, the rheostat and the
fixed resistor will have a total of 3.3 V across them.

a maximum of 10 mA (bright). What values of

When two or more voltage sources are in series, the total voltage is equal to the alge-
braic sum of the individual source voltages. The algebraic sum means that the polarities of
the sources must be included when the sources are combined in series. Sources with oppo-
site polarities have voltages with opposite signs.
When the voltage sources are all in the same direction in terms of their polarities, as in
Figure 22(a), all of the voltages have the same sign when added; there is a total of 4.5 V
from terminal A to terminal B with A more positive than B.
The voltage has a double subscript, AB, to indicate that it is the voltage at point A with re-
spect to point B.
In Figure 22(b), the middle voltage source is opposite to the other two; so its voltage 
has an opposite sign when added to the others. For this case the total voltage from A to B is
Terminal A is 1.5 V more positive than terminal B.
A familiar example of voltage sources in series is the flashlight. When you put two
1.5 V batteries in your flashlight, they are connected in series, giving a total of 3 V. When

In Figure 30, the current is out of the positive side of the source and through the re-
sistors as the arrows indicate. The current is into the positive side of each resistor and out
the negative side. The drop in energy level across a resistor creates a potential difference,
or voltage drop, with a plus-to-minus polarity in the direction of the current.
The voltage from point A to point B in the circuit of Figure 30 is the source voltage, 
Also, the voltage from A to B is the sum of the series resistor voltage drops. Therefore,
the source voltage is equal to the sum of the three voltage drops, as stated by Kirchhoff’s
voltage law.
The sum of all the voltage drops around a single closed path in a circuit is equal to
the total source voltage in that loop.
Kirchhoff’s voltage law applied to a series circuit is illustrated in Figure 31. For this 
case, Kirchhoff’s voltage law can be expressed by Equation 3.
where the subscript n represents the number of voltage drops.
If all the voltage drops around a closed path are added and then this total is subtracted
from the source voltage, the result is zero. This result occurs because the sum of the volt-
age drops always equals the source voltage.

SERIES CIRCUITS
So far, you have seen how Kirchhoff’s voltage law can be applied to a series circuit with
a voltage source, but it can also be applied to other types of circuits. For example, there are
cases where there is no source voltage in a given closed loop. Even so, Kirchhoff’s voltage
law still applies. This leads to a more-general form of Equation 3.
If a voltage source is present, it is simply treated as one of the terms in Equation 4.
In applying Equation 4, an algebraic sign is given to each voltage in the path depend-
ing on whether it is voltage rise (
) or a voltage drop (-). A voltage across a resistor can
appear as either a rise or a drop depending on the path direction chosen, so you will need
to assign algebraic signs to voltage rises and voltage drops in a consistent manner. 
Sometimes you will see an equation such as Equation 4 expressed in shorthand nota-
tion using the Greek letter sigma (
) to denote summation, as follows:

A Potentiometer as an Adjustable Voltage Divider
A potentiometer is a variable resistor with three terminals. A linear potentiometer 
connected to a voltage source is shown in Figure 41(a) with the schematic shown

terminal or wiper is labeled 3. The potentiometer functions as a voltage divider,

which can be illustrated by separating the total resistance into two parts, as shown in Figure
41(c). The resistance between terminal 1 and terminal 3 
is one part, and the resist-
ance between terminal 3 and terminal 2 
is the other part. So this potentiometer is
equivalent to a two-resistor voltage divider that can be manually adjusted.
Figure 42 shows what happens when the wiper contact (3) is moved. In part (a), the 
wiper is exactly centered, making the two resistances equal. If you measure the voltage
across terminals 3 to 2 as indicated by the voltmeter symbol, you have one-half of the total
source voltage. When the wiper is moved up, as in part (b), the resistance between termi-
nals 3 and 2 increases, and the voltage across it increases proportionally. When the wiper
is moved down, as in part (c), the resistance between terminals 3 and 2 decreases, and the
voltage decreases proportionally.

Applications
The volume control of some radio receivers is a common application of a potentiometer
used as a voltage divider. Since the loudness of the sound is dependent on the amount of
voltage associated with the audio signal, you can increase or decrease the volume by ad-
justing the potentiometer, that is, by turning the knob of the volume control on the set. The
block diagram in Figure 43 shows how a potentiometer can be used for volume control 
in a typical receiver.

Figure 44 illustrates another application in which a potentiometer voltage divider can 
be used as a level sensor in a liquid storage tank. As shown in part (a), the float moves up
as the tank is filled and moves down as the tank empties. The float is mechanically linked
to the wiper arm of a potentiometer, as shown in part (b). The output voltage varies pro-
portionally with the position of the wiper arm. As the liquid in the tank decreases, the sen-
sor output voltage also decreases. The output voltage goes to the indicator circuitry, which
controls a digital readout to show the amount of liquid in the tank. The schematic of this
system is shown in part (c).

Still another application for voltage dividers is in setting the dc operating voltage (bias)
in transistor amplifiers. Figure 45 shows a voltage divider used for this purpose. You will

A voltage divider is useful for converting a resistance sensor output to a voltage. Resis-
tance sensors include thermistors, CdS cells, and strain gauges. To convert a change in 
resistance to an output voltage, the resistance sensor can replace one of the resistors in a
voltage divider.
Assume you have a CdS cell configured as shown in Figure 46 that uses three AA 
batteries for a voltage source (4.5 V). At dusk, the resistance of the cell rises from a
low resistance to above

SERIES CIRCUITS
The term ground has its origin in telephone systems in which one of the conductors was
the earth itself. The term was also used in early radio receiving antennas (called aerials)
where one part of the system was connected to a metal pipe driven into the earth. Today,
ground can mean different things and is not necessarily at the same potential as the earth.
In electronic systems, reference ground (or common) refers to a conductor that is the
comparison point for voltage measurements in a circuit. Frequently, it is the conductor that
carries the power supply return current. Most electronic circuit boards have a larger con-
ducting surface area for ground. For many multilayer circuit boards the ground surface area
is a separate internal layer, which is referred to as a ground plane.
In electrical wiring, the reference ground is usually the same as the earth potential be-
cause neutral and earth ground are connected at the entrance point to a building. In this
case, reference ground and earth ground are at the same potential.
The concept of reference ground is also used in automotive electrical systems. In most
automotive systems, the chassis of the automobile is the ground reference. In nearly all mod-
ern automobiles, the negative post of the battery is connected to the chassis with a solid low-
resistance connection. This makes the chassis of the vehicle serve as the return path for all
of the electrical circuits in the vehicle, as illustrated in the simplified drawing in Figure 50.
In some vintage cars, the positive terminal was connected to the chassis in an arrangement
called positive ground. In both cases, the chassis represents the reference ground point.

VOLTAGE MEASUREMENTS
The concept of reference ground is designated as the 0 V reference point for a circuit.
Voltage is always measured with respect to another point in the circuit. In this section,
ground is discussed in more detail.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Measure voltage with respect to ground
◆Define the term reference ground
◆Explain the use of single and double subscripts for indicating voltages
◆Identify ground in a circuit
When removing a battery from an
automobile, remove the ground
wire first. If a tool should then
accidentally come in contact with
the chassis and the positive
terminal, a spark will be avoided;
there is no current because there
is no return path. When installing
a battery, always install the
ground connection last.

Measuring Voltages with Respect to Ground
When voltages are measured with respect to ground, they are indicated with a single letter
subscript. For example, VA is voltage at point A with respect to ground. The circuits in Figure
51 consist of three 
series resistors and four lettered reference points. Reference
ground represents a potential of 0 V with respect to all other points in the circuit as illus-
trated. In part (a), the reference point is D and all voltages are positive with respect to D. In
part (b), the reference point is A in the circuit, and all other points have a negative voltage.

The ground point does not affect the current in the circuit or the voltage drops across the resistors.
Many circuits use both positive and negative voltages and as mentioned, the return path
for these supplies is designated as reference ground. Figure 51(c) shows the same circuit 
but with two 6 V sources replacing the 12 V source. In this case, the reference point is arbi-
trarily designated between the two voltage sources. There is exactly the same current in all
three circuits, but now voltages are referenced to the new ground point. As you can see from
these examples, the reference ground point is arbitrary and does not change the current.
Not all voltages are measured with respect to ground. If you wish to specify the voltage
drop across an ungrounded resistor, you can name the resistor in the subscript or use two
subscripts. When two subscripts are used, the voltage represents the difference between the
points. For example, 
means 
In Figure 51, 
is the same in all three cir-
cuits (
4.0 V) as you can confirm by performing the subtraction in each case. Another way
of designating 
is to write simply 
There is one more convention commonly used to express voltages using subscripts.
Power supply voltages are usually given with a double-letter subscript. The reference point
is ground or common. For example, a voltage written as 
is a positive power supply
voltage with respect to ground. Other common power supply voltages are 
(positive),
(negative), and 
(negative).
To measure voltages with a digital meter, the meter leads can be connected across any
two points and the meter will indicate the voltage, either positive or negative. The meter ref-
erence jack is labeled “COM” (normally black). This is common only to the meter, not to the

The circuit is the same one given in Figure 51(b), 
which has a negative power supply. It is shown as it might be constructed in a lab. Notice
that the meter indicates a negative voltage, which means that the meter’s COM lead is the
more positive lead. If you wanted to measure voltages with respect to the circuit’s refer-
ence ground, you would connect the COM on the meter to the circuit’s reference ground.
The voltage with respect to the reference ground will be indicated.
If you are using an analog meter to make circuit measurements, you must connect the
meter so that its common lead is connected to the most negative point in the circuit; other-
wise, the meter movement will try to move backward. Figure 53 shows an analog meter
connected to the same circuit as before; notice that the meter leads are reversed. To measure

Open Circuit
The most common failure in a series circuit is an open. For example, when a resistor or a
lamp burns out, it causes a break in the current path and creates an open circuit, as illus-
trated in Figure 55.
An open in a series circuit prevents current.

Open resistors or contacts and one point shorted to another are common problems in
all circuits including series circuits.

Troubleshooting an Open
You should already be familiar with the analysis, planning,
and measurement (APM) approach to troubleshooting, as well as the half-splitting method.
Now, these principles will be applied using voltage measurements instead of resistance
measurements. As you know, voltage measurements are generally the easiest to make 
because you do not have to disconnect anything.
As a beginning step, prior to analysis, it is a good idea to make a visual check of the
faulty circuit. Occasionally, you can find a charred resistor, a broken lamp filament, a loose
wire, or a loose connection this way. However, it is possible (and probably more common)
for a resistor or other component to open without showing visible signs of damage. When
a visual check reveals nothing, then proceed with the APM approach.
When an open occurs in a series circuit, all of the source voltage appears across the
open. The reason for this is that the open condition prevents current through the series cir-
cuit. With no current, there can be no voltage drop across any of the other resistors (or
other component). Since 
the voltage on each end of a good resistor
is the same. Therefore, the voltage applied across a series string also appears across the
open component because there are no other voltage drops in the circuit, as illustrated in
IR = (0 A)R = 0 V,
T E C H  N O T E
When measuring a resistance,
make sure that you do not touch
the meter leads or the resistor
leads. If you hold both ends of a
high-value resistor in your fingers
along with the meter probes, the
measurement will be inaccurate
because your body resistance can
affect the measured value. When
body resistance is placed in
parallel with a high-value resistor,
the measured value will be less
than the actual value of the resistor.

Example of Half-Splitting Using Voltage Measurements
Suppose a circuit has four
resistors in series. You have determined by analyzing the symptoms (there is voltage but no
current) that one of the resistors is open, and you are planning to find the open resistor us-
ing a voltmeter for measuring by the half-splitting method. A sequence of measurements
for this particular case is illustrated in Figure 57.
Step 1: Measure across 
and 
(the left half of the circuit). A 0 V reading indicates
that neither of these resistors is open.
Step 2: Move the meter to measure across 
and 
; the reading is 10 V. This indi-
cates there is an open in the right half of the circuit, so either 
or 
is the
faulty resistor (assume no bad connections).
Step 3: Move the meter to measure across 
A measurement of 10 V across 
iden-
tifies it as the open resistor. If you had measured across 
it would have indi-
cated 0 V. This would have also identified 
as the faulty component because
it would have been the only one left that could have 10 V across it.

Short Circuit
Sometimes an unwanted short circuit occurs when two conductors touch or a foreign object
such as solder or a wire clipping accidentally connects two sections of a circuit together.
This situation is particularly common in circuits with a high component density. Several
potential causes of short circuits are illustrated on the PC board in Figure 58.

Examples of shorts on a PC board.
When there is a short, a portion of the series resistance is bypassed (all of the current
goes through the short), thus reducing the total resistance as illustrated in Figure 59. 
Notice that the current increases as a result of the short.
A short in a series circuit causes more current than normal.

Troubleshooting a Short
A short is very difficult to troubleshoot. As in any trou-
bleshooting situation, it is a good idea to make a visual check of the faulty circuit. In the
case of a short in the circuit, a wire clipping, solder splash, or touching leads is often found
to be the culprit. In terms of component failure, shorts are less common than opens in many
types of components. Furthermore, a short in one part of a circuit can cause overheating in
another part due to the higher current caused by the short. As a result two failures, an open
and a short, may occur together.
When a short occurs in a series circuit, there is essentially no voltage across the shorted
part. A short has zero or near zero resistance, although shorts with significant resistance
values can occur from time to time. These are called resistive shorts. For purposes of illus-
tration, zero resistance is assumed for all shorts.
In order to troubleshoot a short, measure the voltage across each resistor until you get a
reading of 0 V. This is the straightforward approach and does not use half-splitting. In order
 FIGURE 59
Example of the effect of a short in a
series circuit.

SERIES CIRCUITS
to apply the half-splitting method, you must know the correct voltage at each point in the
circuit and compare it to measured voltages. Example 23 illustrates using half-splitting 
to find a short.
Assume you have determined that there is a short in a circuit with four series resistors
because the current is higher than it should be. You know that the voltage at each point
in the circuit should be as shown in Figure 60 if the circuit is working properly. The
voltages are shown relative to the negative terminal of the source. Find the location of
the short.

Solution
Use the half-splitting method to troubleshoot the short.
Step 1: Measure across 
and 
The meter shows a reading of 6.67 V, which is higher
than the normal voltage (it should be 5 V). Look for a voltage that is lower than
normal because a short will make the voltage less across that part of the circuit.
Step 2: Move the meter and measure across 
and 
; the reading of 3.33 V is incor-
rect and lower than normal (it should be 5 V). This shows that the short is in the
right half of the circuit and that either 
or 
is shorted.
Step 3: Again move the meter and measure across 
A reading of 3.3 V across 
tells you that 
is shorted because it must have 0 V across it. Figure 61
illustrates this troubleshooting technique.

Application Activity
For this application activity, you have
a voltage-divider circuit board to eval-
uate and modify if necessary. You will
use it to obtain five different voltage
levels from a 12 V battery that has a 6.5 Ah rating. The voltage
divider provides positive reference voltages to an electronic cir-
cuit in an analog-to-digital converter. Your job is to check the
circuit to see if it provides the following voltages within a toler-
ance of 5% with respect to the negative side of the battery:
10.4 V, 8.0 V, 7.3 V, 6.0 V, and 2.7 V. If the existing circuit does
not provide the specified voltages, you will modify it so that it
does. Also, you must make sure that the power ratings of the
resistors are adequate for the application and determine how
long the battery will last with the voltage divider connected to it.
The Schematic of the Circuit
1. Use Figure 62 to determine the resistor values and draw the
schematic of the voltage-divider circuit. All the resistors on
the board are 1⁄4 W.
The Voltages
2. Determine the voltage at each pin on the circuit 
board with respect to the negative side of the battery 
when the positive side of the 12 V battery is connected 
to pin 3 and the negative side is connected to pin 1. 
Compare the existing voltages to the following 
specifications:
Pin 1: negative terminal of 12 V battery
Pin 2: 2.7 V  5%
Pin 3: positive terminal of 12 V battery
Pin 4: 10.4 V  5%
Pin 5: 8.0 V  5%
Pin 6: 7.3 V  5%
Pin 7: 6.0 V  5%
3. If the output voltages of the existing circuit are not the same
as those stated in the specifications, make the necessary
changes in the circuit to meet the specifications. Draw a
schematic of the modified circuit showing resistor values
and adequate power ratings.
The Battery

APPLICATION ACTIVITY PREVIEW
In this application activity, a panel-mounted power supply
will be modified by adding a milliammeter to indicate current
to a load. Expansion of the meter for multiple current ranges
using parallel (shunt) resistors will be demonstrated. The
problem with very low-value resistors when a switch is used
to select the current ranges will be introduced and the effect
of switch contact resistance will be demonstrated. A way of
eliminating the contact resistance problem will be presented.
Finally, the ammeter circuit will be installed in the power sup-

INTRODUCTION
In this chapter, you will see how Ohm’s law is used in par-
allel circuits; and you will learn Kirchhoff’s current law. Also,
several applications of parallel circuits, including automotive
lighting, residential wiring, control circuit, and the internal
wiring of analog ammeters are presented. You will learn how
to determine total parallel resistance and how to trou-
bleshoot for open resistors.
When resistors are connected in parallel and a voltage is
applied across the parallel circuit, each resistor provides a
separate path for current. The total resistance of a parallel
circuit is reduced as more resistors are connected in parallel.
The voltage across each of the parallel resistors is equal to
the voltage applied across the entire parallel circuit.

Resistors in parallel.
In Figure 1, it is obvious that the resistors are connected in parallel. Often, in actual
circuit diagrams, the parallel relationship is not as clear. It is important that you learn to
recognize parallel circuits regardless of how they may be drawn.
A rule for identifying parallel circuits is as follows:
If there is more than one current path (branch) between two separate points and if
the voltage between those two points also appears across each of the branches, then
there is a parallel circuit between those two points.
Figure 2 shows parallel resistors drawn in different ways between two separate points
labeled A and B. Notice that in each case, the current has two paths going from A to B, and

PARALLEL CIRCUITS
To illustrate voltage in a parallel circuit, let’s examine Figure 7(a). Points A, B, C, 
and D along the left side of the parallel circuit are electrically the same point because the
voltage is the same along this line. You can think of all of these points as being connected
by a single wire to the negative terminal of the battery. The points E, F, G, and H along the
right side of the circuit are all at a voltage equal to that of the positive terminal of the source.
Thus, voltage across each parallel resistor is the same, and each is equal to the source volt-
age. Note that the parallel circuit in Figure 7 resembles a ladder.
Figure 7(b) is the same circuit as in part (a), drawn in a slightly different way. Here 
the left side of each resistor is connected to a single point, which is the negative battery ter-
minal. The right side of each resistor is connected to a single point, which is the positive
battery terminal. The resistors are still all in parallel across the source.

PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Kirchhoff’s current law, often abbreviated KCL, can be stated as follows:
The sum of the currents into a node (total current in) is equal to the sum of the cur-
rents out of that node (total current out).
A node is any point or junction in a circuit where two or more components are con-
nected. In a parallel circuit, a node or junction is a point where the parallel branches come
together. For example, in the circuit of Figure 12, point A is one node and point B is an-
other. Let’s start at the positive terminal of the source and follow the current. The total cur-
rent 
from the source is into node A. At this point, the current splits up among the three
branches as indicated. Each of the three branch currents (
and 
) is out of node A.
Kirchhoff’s current law says that the total current into node A is equal to the total current
out of node A; that is,
Now, following the currents in Figure 12 through the three branches, you see
that they come back together at node B. Currents

node A.
Figure 13 illustrates the general case of Kirchhoff’s current law and can be written as 
a mathematical relationship:
Moving the terms on the right side to the left side and changing the sign results in the fol-
lowing equivalent equation:
This equation shows that all current into and out of the junction sums to zero and can be
stated as
The algebraic sum of all of the currents entering and leaving a node is equal to zero.
An equivalent way of writing Kirchhoff’s current law can be expressed using mathemati-
cal summation shorthand.

Kirchhoff’s current law can be
applied to anything that acts as a
load for an electrical system. For
example, the power connections to
a circuit board will have the same
current supplied to the board as
leaving the board. Likewise, a
building has the same current on
the incoming “hot” line as the
neutral. Normally, the supply
current and return current are
always the same.
Equation 1
199

PARALLEL CIRCUITS
To express Kirchhoff’s current law with this method, all currents are assigned a sequential
subscript (1, 2, 3, and so on) no matter if the current is into or out of the node. Currents into
the node are positive and currents leaving the node are negative.
You can verify Kirchhoff’s current law by connecting a circuit and measuring each
branch current and the total current from the source, as illustrated in Figure 14. When the
branch currents are added together, their sum will equal the total current. This rule applies
for any number of branches.

the total current.

total resistance of a parallel circuit is always less than the value of the smallest resistor.

Another special case of parallel circuits is the parallel connection of several resistors each

If several resistors in parallel have the same resistance, they can be assigned the same
symbol R. For example, 
Starting with Equation 2, you

ohmmeter can only measure the cold resistance. Assume you want to know the equiva-

PARALLEL CIRCUIT APPLICATIONS
Parallel circuits are found in some form in virtually every electronic system. In many
of these applications, the parallel relationship of components may not be obvious until
you have covered some advanced topics that you will study later. For now, let’s look at
some examples of common and familiar applications of parallel circuits.

PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Automotive
One advantage of a parallel circuit over a series circuit is that when one branch opens, the
other branches are not affected. For example, Figure 42 shows a simplified diagram of 
an automobile lighting system. When one headlight on a car goes out, it does not cause the
other lights to go out because they are all in parallel.

Notice that the brake lights are switched on independently of the headlights and taillights.
They come on only when the driver closes the brake light switch by depressing the brake
pedal. When the lights switch is closed, both headlights and both taillights are on. When the
headlights are on, the parking lights are off and vice versa, as indicated by the dashed line
connecting the switches. If any one of the lights burns out (opens), there is still current in each
of the other lights. The back-up lights are switched on when the reverse gear is engaged.
Another automotive application of parallel resistances is the rear window defroster. As
you know, power is dissipated in resistance in the form of heat. The defroster consists of a
group of parallel resistance wires that warm the glass when power is applied. A typical de-
froster can dissipate over 100 W across the window. Although resistance heating is not as
efficient as other forms of heat, in applications like this it is simple and cost effective.
Residential
Another common use of parallel circuits is in residential electrical systems. All the lights
and appliances in a home are wired in parallel. Figure 43 shows a typical room wiring
arrangement with two switch-controlled lights and three wall outlets in parallel.

PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Control Circuits
Many control systems use parallel circuits or equivalent circuits for control and monitoring
an industrial process such as a production line. Most complex control applications are im-
plemented on a dedicated computer called a programmable logic controller (PLC). A PLC
shows an equivalent parallel circuit, which is displayed on a computer screen. Internally,
the circuit may exist only as a computer code, written in a computer programming lan-
guage. However, the displayed circuit is one that could in principle be constructed with
hardware. These circuits can be drawn to resemble a ladder—with rungs representing the
load (and a source) and the rails representing the two principal nodes. (For example, notice
that Figure 43 resembles a ladder on its side, with the lights and wall outlets as loads.) 
Parallel control circuits use ladder diagrams but add additional control elements (switches,
relays, timers, and more). The result of adding the control elements creates a logical dia-
gram, which is referred to as ladder logic. Ladder logic is easy to understand, so it is pop-
ular for showing control logic in industrial environments, such as factories or food
processors. Entire books are written about ladder logic, but a ladder diagram (parallel cir-
cuit) is at the core of all ladder logic. The most important aspect is that ladder logic shows
the basic functionality of the circuit in an easy-to-read format.
Analog Ammeters
Parallel circuits are used in the analog (needle-type) ammeter or milliammeter. Although
analog meters are not as common as they once were, they are still used as panel meters in
certain applications and analog multimeters are still available. Parallel circuits are an im-
portant part of analog ammeter operation because they allow the selection of various ranges
in order to measure many different current values.
The mechanism in an ammeter that causes the pointer to move in proportion to the cur-
rent is called the meter movement, which is based on a magnetic principle that you will
learn later. Right now, it is sufficient to know that a given meter movement has a certain re-
sistance and a maximum current. This maximum current, called the full-scale deflection
current, causes the pointer to go all the way to the end of the scale. For example, a certain
meter movement has a 
resistance and a full-scale deflection current of 1 mA. A me-
ter with this particular movement can measure currents of 1 mA or less as indicated in
Figure 44(a) and (b). Currents greater than 1 mA will cause the pointer to “peg” (or stop)
slightly past the full scale mark as indicated in part (c), which can damage the meter.

Figure 45 shows a simple ammeter with a resistor in parallel with the 1 mA meter

figure specifically shows 9 mA through the shunt resistor and 1 mA through the meter

movement. Thus, up to 10 mA can be measured. To find the actual current value, simply
multiply the reading on the scale by 10.
A multiple-range ammeter has a range switch that permits the selection of several full-
scale current settings. In each switch position, a certain amount of current is bypassed
through a parallel resistor as determined by the resistance value. In our example, the cur-
rent though the movement is never greater than 1 mA.
Figure 46 illustrates a meter with three ranges: 1 mA, 10 mA, and 100 mA. When the
range switch is in the 1 mA position, all of the current into the meter goes through the me-
ter movement. In the 10 mA setting, up to 9 mA goes through 
and up to 1 mA through
the movement. In the 100 mA setting, up to 99 mA goes through 
and the movement
can still have only 1 mA for full-scale.

movement (half-scale deflection) and 49.5 mA are through RSH2.

PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Open Branches
If a switch is connected in a branch of a parallel circuit, as shown in Figure 47, an open 
or a closed path can be made by the switch. When the switch is closed, as in Figure 47(a),
and 
are in parallel. The total resistance is 
(two 
resistors in parallel). Cur-
rent is through both resistors. If the switch is opened, as in Figure 47(b),

removed from the circuit, and the total resistance is 
Current is now only through 
In general,
When an open occurs in a parallel branch, the total resistance increases, the total
current decreases, and the same current continues through each of the remaining
parallel paths.
The decrease in total current equals the amount of current that was previously in the open
branch. The other branch currents remain the same.

Recall that an open circuit is one in which the current path is interrupted and there is
no current. In this section we examine what happens when a branch of a parallel cir-
cuit opens.

When switch opens, total current decreases and current through R2 remains unchanged.
Consider the lamp circuit in Figure 48. There are four bulbs in parallel with a 12 V
source. In part (a), there is current through each bulb. Now suppose that one of the bulbs
burns out, creating an open path as shown in Figure 48(b). This light will go out because
there is no current through the open path. Notice, however, that current continues through
all the other parallel bulbs, and they continue to glow. The open branch does not change the
voltage across the parallel branches; it remains at 12 V, and the current through each branch
remains the same.
222

PARALLEL CIRCUITS
You can see that a parallel circuit has an advantage over a series circuit in lighting systems
because if one or more of the parallel bulbs burn out, the others will stay on. In a series cir-
cuit, when one bulb goes out, all of the others go out also because the current path is com-
pletely interrupted.
When a resistor in a parallel circuit opens, the open resistor cannot be located by mea-
surement of the voltage across the branches because the same voltage exists across all the
branches. Thus, there is no way to tell which resistor is open by simply measuring voltage.
The good resistors will always have the same voltage as the open one, as illustrated in Figure
49 (note that the middle resistor is open).
If a visual inspection does not reveal the open resistor, it must be located by current mea-
surements. In practice, measuring current is more difficult than measuring voltage because you
must insert the ammeter in series to measure the current. Thus, a wire or a PC board connec-
tion must be cut or disconnected, or one end of a component must be lifted off the circuit board,
in order to connect the ammeter in series. This procedure, of course, is not required when volt-
age measurements are made because the meter leads are simply connected across a component.
Finding an Open Branch by Current Measurement
In a parallel circuit with a suspected open branch, the total current can be measured to find the
open. When a parallel resistor opens, the total current,
, is always less than its normal
value. Once you know 
and the voltage across the branches, a few calculations will deter-
mine the open resistor when all the resistors are of different resistance values.
Consider the two-branch circuit in Figure 50(a). If one of the resistors opens, the total 
current will equal the current in the good resistor. Ohm’s law quickly tells you what the cur-
rent in each resistor should be.
If 
is open, the total current is 89.3 mA, as indicated in Figure 50(b). If 
is open, the
total current is 500 mA, as indicated in Figure 50(c).

PARALLEL CIRCUITS
This procedure can be extended to any number of branches having unequal resistances.
If the parallel resistances are all equal, the current in each branch must be checked until a
branch is found with no current. This is the open resistor.
In Figure 51, there is a total current of 31.09 mA, and the voltage across the parallel
branches is 20 V. Is there an open resistor, and, if so, which one is it?

Finding an Open Branch by Resistance Measurement
If the parallel circuit to be checked can be disconnected from its voltage source and from
any other circuit to which it may be connected, a measurement of the total resistance can
be used to locate an open branch.
Recall that conductance, G, is the reciprocal of resistance (1/R) and its unit is the siemens
(S). The total conductance of a parallel circuit is the sum of the conductances of all the resistors.
To locate an open branch, do the following steps:
1. Calculate what the total conductance should be using the individual resistor values.
2. Measure the total resistance with an ohmmeter and calculate the total measured
conductance.

PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Shorted Branches
When a branch in a parallel circuit shorts, the current increases to an excessive value, caus-
ing a fuse or circuit breaker to blow. This results in a difficult troubleshooting problem
because it is hard to isolate the shorted branch.
A pulser and a current tracer are tools often used to find shorts in a circuit. They are not
restricted to use in digital circuits but can be effective in any type of circuit. The pulser is a
pen-shaped tool that applies pulses to a selected point in a circuit, causing pulses of current
to flow through the shorted path. The current tracer is also a pen-shaped tool that senses
pulses of current. By following the current with the tracer, the current path can be identified.

Application Activity
In this application activity, a dc power
supply is modified by adding a 3-range
ammeter to indicate current to the load.
As you have learned, parallel resist-
ances can be used to extend the range of an ammeter. These parallel
resistors, called shunts, bypass current around the meter movement,
allowing for the meter to effectively measure higher currents than
the maximum current for which the meter movement is designed.

meter movement provides the 25 mA range. This is shown in
Figure 55. The range selection is provided by a 1-pole, 
3-position rotary switch with a contact resistance of 
Contact resistance of switches can be from less than 
to
about 
The contact resistance of a given switch can vary
with temperature, current, and usage and, therefore, cannot be
relied upon to remain within a reasonable tolerance of the speci-
fied value. Also, the switch is a make-before-break type, which
means that contact with the previous position is not broken until
contact with the new position is made.
The shunt resistance value for the 2.5 A range is determined
as follows where the voltage across the meter movement is

from 0 V to 10 V using the voltage control. The power supply is ca-
pable of providing up to 2 A to a load. A basic block diagram of the
power supply is shown in Figure 54. It consists of a rectifier cir-
cuit that converts ac voltage from the wall outlet to dc voltage and a
regulator circuit that keeps the output voltage at a constant value.
It is required that the power supply be modified by adding an
ammeter with three switch-selected current ranges of 25 mA,
250 mA, and 2.5 A. To accomplish this, two shunt resistances
are used that can each be switched into a parallel connection
with the meter movement. This approach works fine as long as
the required values of the shunt resistors are not too small. How-
ever, there are problems at very low values of shunt resistance
and you will see why next.

Implementing the Power Supply Modification
Once the proper values are obtained, the resistors are placed on a
board which is then mounted in the power supply. The resistors
and the range switch are connected to the power supply as
shown in Figure 57. The ammeter circuit is connected be-
tween the rectifier circuit in the power supply and the regulator
circuit in order to reduce the impact of the voltage drop across
the meter circuit on the output voltage. The regulator maintains,
within certain limits, a constant dc output voltage even though
its input voltage coming through the meter circuit may change.

the value of the shunt resistor
is
Although this value, or one close to it, may be available, the
problem in this case is that the switch contact resistance is
nearly five times that of 
and any variation in it would
create a significant inaccuracy in the meter. As you can see, this
approach is not acceptable for these particular requirements.
Another Approach
A variation of the standard shunt resistance circuit is shown in
Figure 56. The shunt resistor, 
is connected in parallel for
the two higher current range settings and disconnected for the
25 mA setting using a 2-pole, 3-position switch. This circuit
avoids dependency on the switch contact resistance by using 
resistor values that are large enough to make it insignificant. The
disadvantages of this meter circuit are that it requires a more
complex switch and the voltage drops from input to output are
greater than in the previous shunt circuit.
For the 250 mA range, the current through the meter move-
ment for full-scale deflection is 25 mA. The voltage across the
meter movement is 150 mV.
This value of 
is more than thirteen times the expected
switch contact resistance of 
thus minimizing the effect
of the contact resistance.

PARALLEL CIRCUITS
KEY TERMS
Branch
One current path in a parallel circuit.
Current divider
A parallel circuit in which the currents divide inversely proportional to the paral-
lel branch resistances.
Kirchhoff’s current law
A circuit law stating that the total current into a node equals the total
current out of the node. Equivalently, the algebraic sum of all the currents entering and leaving a
node is zero.
Node
A point in a circuit at which two or more components are connected; also known as a
junction.
Parallel
The relationship between two circuit components that exists when they are connected 
between the same pair of nodes.
SUMMARY
◆Resistors in parallel are connected between two points (nodes).
◆A parallel combination has more than one path for current.
◆The total parallel resistance is less than the lowest-value resistor.
◆The voltages across all branches of a parallel circuit are the same.
◆Current sources in parallel add algebraically.
◆Kirchhoff’s current law: The sum of the currents into a junction (total current in) equals the sum
of the currents out of the junction (total current out).
◆The algebraic sum of all the currents entering and leaving a junction is equal to zero.
◆A parallel circuit is a current divider, so called because the total current entering the junction of
parallel branches divides up into each of the branches.
◆If all of the branches of a parallel circuit have equal resistance, the currents through all of the
branches are equal.
◆The total power in a parallel-resistive circuit is the sum of all of the individual powers of the 
resistors making up the parallel circuit.
◆The total power for a parallel circuit can be calculated with the power formulas using values of 
total current, total resistance, or total voltage.
◆If one of the branches of a parallel circuit opens, the total resistance increases, and therefore the
total current decreases.
◆If a branch of a parallel circuit opens, there is no change in current through the remaining
branches.

INTRODUCTION
In this chapter, both series and parallel resistors are com-
bined into series-parallel circuits. In many practical situa-
tions, you will have both series and parallel combinations
within the same circuit, and the analysis methods you
learned for series circuits and for parallel circuits will apply.
Important types of series-parallel circuits are introduced
in this chapter. These circuits include the voltage divider
with a resistive load, the ladder network, and the Wheat-
stone bridge.
The analysis of series-parallel circuits requires the use of
Ohm’s law, Kirchhoff’s voltage and current laws, and meth-
ods for finding total resistance and power. The topic of
loaded voltage dividers is important because this type of cir-
cuit is found in many practical situations, such as the volt-
age-divider bias circuit for a transistor amplifier. Ladder
networks are important in several areas, including a major
type of digital-to-analog conversion, which you will study in
a digital fundamentals course. The Wheatstone bridge is
used in many types of systems for the measurement of un-
known parameters, including most electronic scales.

IDENTIFYING SERIES-PARALLEL RELATIONSHIPS
A series-parallel circuit consists of combinations of both series and parallel current
paths. It is important to be able to identify how the components in a circuit are
arranged in terms of their series and parallel relationships.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Identify series-parallel relationships
◆Recognize how each resistor in a given circuit is related to the other resistors
◆Determine series and parallel relationships on a PC board
When the circuit of Figure 1(a) is connected to a voltage source as shown in Figure 
1(c), the total current is through 
and divides at point B into the two parallel paths. 
These two branch currents then recombine, and the total current is into the negative source
terminal as shown.
Now, to illustrate series-parallel relationships, let’s increase the complexity of the cir-
cuit in Figure 1(a) step-by-step. In Figure 2(a), another resistor 
is connected in

The total resistance from point A to point C is 
in
series with the parallel combination of 
and 
as indicated in Figure 1(b). The term 
point can refer to either a node or a terminal. For example, in Figure 1(a), A is a terminal
because it is an end point, B is a node because it is the junction of two or more components,
and C is both a terminal and a node. So, the term point will sometimes be used to represent
either or both.

ANALYSIS OF SERIES-PARALLEL RESISTIVE CIRCUITS
The analysis of series-parallel circuits can be approached in many ways, depending on
what information you need and what circuit values you know. The examples in this
section do not represent an exhaustive coverage, but they give you an idea of how to
approach series-parallel circuit analysis.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Analyze series-parallel circuits
◆Determine total resistance
◆Determine all the currents
◆Determine all the voltage drops
If you know Ohm’s law, Kirchhoff’s laws, the voltage-divider formula, and the current-
divider formula, and if you know how to apply these laws, you can solve most resistive cir-
cuit analysis problems. The ability to recognize series and parallel combinations is, of course,

essential. A few circuits, such as the unbalanced Wheatstone bridge, do not have basic series
and parallel combinations. Other methods are needed for these cases, as we will discuss later.
Total Resistance
To find the total resistance (
) of a series-parallel combination, simply define the series
and parallel relationships; then perform the calculations that you have previously learned.
The following two examples illustrate this general approach.

LOADING EFFECT OF A VOLTMETER
As you have learned, voltmeters must be connected in parallel with a resistor in order
to measure the voltage across the resistor. Because of its internal resistance, a volt-
meter puts a load on the circuit and will affect, to a certain extent, the voltage that is
being measured. Until now, we have ignored the loading effect because the internal 
resistance of a voltmeter is very high, and normally it has negligible effect on the cir-
cuit that is being measured. However, if the internal resistance of the voltmeter is not 
265

SERIES-PARALLEL CIRCUITS
sufficiently greater than the circuit resistance across which it is connected, the loading
effect will cause the measured voltage to be less than its actual value. You should
always be aware of this effect.

The loading effect of a voltmeter.
If 
is much greater than 
the resistance from A to B changes very little, and the
meter indicates the actual voltage. If 
is not sufficiently greater than 
the resistance
from A to B is reduced significantly, and the voltage across 
is altered by the loading
effect of the meter. A good rule of thumb for troubleshooting work is that if the loading
effect is less than 10%, it can usually be neglected, depending on the accuracy required.
Most voltmeters are part of a multifunction instrument such as the DMM or 
the analog multimeter. The voltmeter in a DMM will typically have an internal 
resistance of 
or more, so the loading effect is important only in very high-
resistance circuits. DMMs have a constant resistance on all ranges because the input is
connected to an internal fixed voltage divider. For analog multimeters, the internal resist-
ance depends on the range selected for making a measurement. To determine the loading
effect, you need to know the sensitivity of the meter, a value given by the manufacturer on

on the 10 V range. As you

the analog multimeter.

SERIES-PARALLEL CIRCUITS
A Wheatstone bridge circuit is shown in its most common “diamond” configuration
in Figure 46(a). It consists of four resistors and a dc voltage source connected across the 
top and bottom points of the “diamond.” The output voltage is taken across the left and
right points of the “diamond” between A and B. In part (b), the circuit is drawn in a slightly

THE WHEATSTONE BRIDGE
The Wheatstone bridge circuit can be used to precisely measure resistance. However,
the bridge is most commonly used in conjunction with transducers to measure physical
quantities such as strain, temperature, and pressure. Transducers are devices that sense
a change in a physical parameter and convert that change into an electrical quantity such
as a change in resistance. For example, a strain gauge exhibits a change in resistance
when it is exposed to mechanical factors such as force, pressure, or displacement. A
thermistor exhibits a change in its resistance when it is exposed to a change in tempera-
ture. The Wheatstone bridge can be operated in a balanced or an unbalanced condition.
The condition of operation depends on the type of application.
After completing this section, you should be able to

Wheatstone was a British scientist
and inventor of many scientific
breakthroughs, including the
English concertina, the stereoscope
(a device for displaying three-
dimensional images), and an
encryption cipher technique.
Wheatstone is best known for his
contributions in the development
of the Wheatstone bridge,
originally invented by Samuel
Hunter Christie, and as a major
figure in the development of
telegraphy. Wheatstone gave full
credit for the invention to Christie,
but because of his work in
developing and applying the
bridge, it became known as the
Wheatstone bridge. (Photo credit:

This formula allows you to find the value of resistor

ilar way.
Using the Balanced Wheatstone Bridge to Find an Unknown Resistance
Assume
that

Resistors 
and 
have 
fixed values so that their ratio, 
also has a fixed value. Since 
can be any value, 
must be adjusted to make

fore, 
is a variable resistor, which we will call 
When 
is placed in the bridge, 
is
adjusted until the bridge is balanced as indicated by a zero output voltage. Then, the un-
known resistance is found as
The ratio 
is the scale factor.
An older type of measuring instrument called a galvanometer can be connected between
the output terminals A and B to detect a balanced condition. The galvanometer is essen-
tially a very sensitive ammeter that senses current in either direction. It differs from a reg-
ular ammeter in that the midscale point is zero. In modern instruments, an amplifier
connected across the bridge output indicates a balanced condition when its output is 0 V.
Also, high precision micro-adjustable resistors can be used in demanding applications. The
micro-adjustable resistors enable fine adjustment of the bridge resistors during manufac-
ture for applications such as medical sensors, scales, and precision measurements.
From Equation 2, the value of 
at balance multiplied by the scale factor

The Unbalanced Wheatstone Bridge
An unbalanced bridge condition occurs when 
is not equal to zero. The unbalanced
bridge is used to measure several types of physical quantities such as mechanical strain,
temperature, or pressure. This can be done by connecting a transducer in one leg of the
bridge, as shown in Figure 48. The resistance of the transducer changes proportionally 
to the changes in the parameter that it is measuring. If the bridge is balanced at a known
point, then the amount of deviation from the balanced condition, as indicated by the output
voltage, indicates the amount of change in the parameter being measured. Therefore, the
value of the parameter being measured can be determined by the amount that the bridge is
unbalanced.

A Bridge Circuit for Measuring Temperature
If temperature is to be measured, the
transducer can be a thermistor, which is a temperature-sensitive resistor. The thermistor re-
sistance changes in a predictable way as the temperature changes. A change in temperature
causes a change in thermistor resistance, which causes a corresponding change in the out-
put voltage of the bridge as it becomes unbalanced. The output voltage is proportional to
the temperature; therefore, either a voltmeter connected across the output can be calibrated
to show the temperature or the output voltage can be amplified and converted to digital
form to drive a readout display of the temperature.
A bridge circuit used to measure temperature is designed so that it is balanced at a ref-
erence temperature and becomes unbalanced at a measured temperature. For example, let’s
say the bridge is to be balanced at 
A thermistor will have a known value of resistance
at

Other Unbalanced Wheatstone Bridge Applications
A Wheatstone bridge with a
strain gauge can be used to measure forces. A strain gauge is a device that exhibits a change
in resistance when it is compressed or stretched by the application of an external force. As
the resistance of the strain gauge changes, the previously balanced bridge becomes unbal-
anced. This unbalance causes the output voltage to change from zero, and this change can
be measured to determine the amount of strain. In strain gauges, the resistance change is
extremely small. This tiny change unbalances a Wheatstone bridge and can be detected
because of its high sensitivity. For example, Wheatstone bridges with strain gauges are
commonly used in weight scales.
Some resistive transducers have extremely small resistance changes, and these changes are
difficult to measure accurately with a direct measurement. In particular, strain gauges are one
Equation 3
277

SERIES-PARALLEL CIRCUITS
of the most useful resistive transducers that convert the stretching or compression of a fine wire
into a change in resistance. When strain causes the wire in the gauge to stretch, the resistance
increases a small amount; and when it compresses, the resistance of the wire decreases.
Strain gauges are used in many types of scales, from those that are used for weighing
small parts to those for weighing huge trucks. Typically, the gauges are mounted on a spe-
cial block of aluminum that deforms when a weight is on the scale. The strain gauges are ex-
tremely delicate and must be mounted properly, so the entire assembly is generally prepared
as a single unit called a load cell. A load cell is a transducer that uses strain gauges to con-
vert mechanical force into an electrical signal. A wide variety of load cells with different
shapes and sizes are available from manufacturers depending on the application. A typical
S-type load cell for a weighing application is shown in Figure 50(a). The load cell has four
strain gauges as illustrated in Figure 50(b). The gauges are mounted so that two of the 
gauges stretch (tension) when a load is placed on the scale and two of the gauges compress.

Wheatstone bridge in a scale application.
Load cells are usually connected to a Wheatstone bridge as shown in Figure 50(c) 
with strain gauges (SG) in tension (T) and compression (C) in opposite diagonal legs as
shown. The output of the bridge is normally digitized and converted to a reading for a dis-
play or sent to a computer for processing. The major advantage of the Wheatstone bridge
circuit is that it is capable of accurately measuring very small differences in resistance. The
use of four active transducers increases the sensitivity of the measurement and makes the
bridge the ideal circuit for instrumentation. The Wheatstone bridge circuit has the added
benefit of compensating for temperature variations and wire resistance of connecting wires
that would otherwise contribute to inaccuracies.
In addition to scales, strain gauges are used with Wheatstone bridges in other types of
measurements including pressure measurements, displacement and acceleration measure-
ments to name a few. In pressure measurements, the strain gauges are bonded to a flexible
diaphragm that stretches when pressure is applied to the transducer. The amount of flexing
is related to the pressure, which again converts to a very small resistance change.

TROUBLESHOOTING
As you know, troubleshooting is the process of identifying and locating a failure or
problem in a circuit. Some troubleshooting techniques and the application of logical
thought have already been discussed in relation to both series circuits and parallel cir-
cuits. A basic premise of troubleshooting is that you must know what to look for be-
fore you can successfully troubleshoot a circuit.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Troubleshoot series-parallel circuits
◆Determine the effects of an open in a circuit
◆Determine the effects of a short in a circuit
◆Locate opens and shorts
Opens and shorts are typical problems that occur in electric circuits. If a resistor burns
out, it will normally produce an open. Bad solder connections, broken wires, and poor con-
tacts can also be causes of open paths. Pieces of foreign material, such as solder splashes,
broken insulation on wires, and so on, can lead to shorts in a circuit. A short is considered
to be a zero resistance path between two points.
In addition to complete opens or shorts, partial opens or partial shorts can develop in a
circuit. A partial open would be a much higher than normal resistance, but not infinitely
large. A partial short would be a much lower than normal resistance, but not zero.
The following three examples illustrate troubleshooting series-parallel circuits.
From the indicated voltmeter reading in Figure 51, determine if there is a fault by 
applying the APM approach. If there is a fault, identify it as either a short or an open.

This calculation shows that 4.22 V is the voltage reading that you should get on the
meter. However, the meter reads 9.6 V across 
This value is incorrect, and, be-
cause it is higher than it should be, either 
or 
is probably open. Why? Because if
either of these two resistors is open, the resistance across which the meter is connected
is larger than expected. A higher resistance will drop a higher voltage in this circuit.
Step 2: Planning
Start trying to find the open resistor by assuming that 
is open. If it is, the voltage
across 
is
Since the measured voltage is also 9.6 V, this calculation shows that 
is probably open.

not, inspect the wiring, solder, or connections around

from the source, which tells you that 
is open
in the circuit, or 
is shorted.

If it is open, then there will be no current
from the source. To verify this, measure across 
with the voltmeter. If 
is open, the
meter will indicate 24 V. The right side of 
will be at zero volts because there is no
current through any of the other resistors to cause a voltage drop across them.

Application Activity
The Wheatstone bridge is widely used
in measurement applications that use
sensors to convert a physical parame-
ter to a change in resistance. Modern
Wheatstone bridges are automated; with intelligent interface
modules, the output can be conditioned and converted to any
desired unit for display or processing (for example, the output
might be displayed in pounds for a scale application).
The Wheatstone bridge provides a null measurement, which
enables it to have great sensitivity. It can also be designed to
compensate for changes in temperature, a great advantage for
many resistive measurements, particularly when the resistance
change of the sensor is very small. Usually, the output voltage of
the bridge is increased by an amplifier that has a minimum load-
ing effect on the bridge.
Temperature Controller
In this application activity, a Wheatstone bridge circuit is used in
a temperature controller. The sensor is a thermistor (“thermal
resistor”), which is a resistive sensor that changes resistance as
temperature changes. Thermistors are available with positive or
negative resistance characteristics as a function of temperature.
The thermistor in this circuit is one of the resistors in a Wheat-
stone bridge but is located a short distance from the circuit board
for sensing the temperature at a point off the board. The thresh-
old voltage for the output to change is controlled by the 
potentiometer, 
The amplifier and LEDs are shown only to provide a context
for this wheatstone bridge application and are not intended to be
the focus. You will study operational amplifiers in a later course. 
The amplifier is an operational amplifier (“op-amp”), which is
an integrated circuit. The term amplifier is used in electronics
to describe a device that produces a larger replica of the input

voltage or current at its output. The term gain refers to the
amount of amplification. The op-amp in this circuit is config-
ured as a comparator, which is be used to compare the voltage
on one side of the bridge with the voltage on the other.
The advantage of a comparator is that it is extremely sensi-
tive to an unbalanced bridge and produces a large output when
the bridge is unbalanced. In fact, it is so sensitive, it is virtually
impossible to adjust the bridge for perfect balance. Even the tini-
est imbalance will cause the output to go to a voltage near either
the maximum or minimum possible (the power supply voltages).
This is handy for turning on a heater or other device based on
the temperature.
The Control Circuit
This application has a tank containing a liquid that needs to be
held at a warm temperature, as illustrated in Figure 57(a). 
The circuit board for the temperature controller is shown in
Figure 57(b). The circuit board controls a heating unit 
(through an interface, which is not shown) when the tempera-
ture is too cold. The thermistor, which is located in the tank, is
connected between one of the amplifier inputs and ground as
illustrated.
The op-amp has two inputs, an output, and connections for
positive and negative supply voltages. The schematic symbol for
the op-amp with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) connected to the
output is shown in Figure 58. The red LED is on when the op-
amp output is a positive voltage, indicating the heater is on. The
green LED is on when the output is a negative voltage, indicat-
ing the heater is off.
1. Using the circuit board as a guide, complete the schematic in
Figure 58. The op-amp inputs are connected to a Wheat-
stone bridge. Show the values for all resistors.

The Thermistor
The thermistor is a mixture of two metal-oxides, which exhibit a
large resistance change as a function of temperature. The ther-
mistor in the temperature controller circuit is located off the
board near the point where temperature is to be sensed in the
tank and is connected between the thermistor input and ground.
Thermistors have a nonlinear resistance-temperature charac-
teristic described by the exponential equation:

typically 298 K, which is

of 4615 K. For convenience, the resis-
tance of this thermistor is plotted as a function of temperature in
Figure 59. Notice that the negative slope indicates this ther-
mistor has a negative temperature coefficient (NTC); that is, its
resistance decreases as the temperature increases.

SUMMARY
◆A series-parallel circuit is a combination of both series and parallel current paths.
◆To determine total resistance in a series-parallel circuit, identify the series and parallel relationships,
and then apply the formulas for series resistance and parallel resistance.
◆To find the total current, apply Ohm’s law and divide the total voltage by the total resistance.
◆To determine branch currents, apply the current-divider formula, Kirchhoff’s current law, or
Ohm’s law. Consider each circuit problem individually to determine the most appropriate method.
◆To determine voltage drops across any portion of a series-parallel circuit, use the voltage-divider
formula, Kirchhoff’s voltage law, or Ohm’s law. Consider each circuit problem individually to
determine the most appropriate method.
◆When a load resistor is connected across a voltage-divider output, the output voltage decreases.
◆The load resistor should be large compared to the resistance across which it is connected, in order
that the loading effect may be minimized.
◆To find total resistance of a ladder network, start at the point farthest from the source and reduce
the resistance in steps.
◆A balanced Wheatstone bridge can be used to measure an unknown resistance.
◆A bridge is balanced when the output voltage is zero. The balanced condition produces zero cur-
rent through a load connected across the output terminals of the bridge.
◆An unbalanced Wheatstone bridge can be used to measure physical quantities using transducers.
◆Opens and shorts are typical circuit faults.
◆Resistors normally open when they burn out.

INTRODUCTION
Some types of circuits are difficult to analyze using only
Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s laws and require additional meth-
ods in order to simplify the analysis.
The theorems and conversions in this chapter make analy-
sis easier for certain types of circuits. These methods do not
replace Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s laws, but they are nor-
mally used in conjunction with the laws in certain situations.
Because all electric circuits are driven by either voltage
sources or current sources, it is important to understand
how to work with these elements. The superposition theo-
rem will help you to deal with circuits that have multiple
sources. Thevenin’s and Norton’s theorems provide methods
for reducing a circuit to a simple equivalent form for ease of
analysis. The maximum power transfer theorem is used in
applications where it is important for a given circuit to pro-
vide maximum power to a load. An example of this is an
audio amplifier that provides maximum power to a speaker.
Delta-to-wye and wye-to-delta conversions are sometimes
useful when you analyze bridge circuits that are commonly
found in systems that measure physical parameters such as
temperature, pressure, and strain.

THE DC VOLTAGE SOURCE
The dc voltage source is one of the principal types of energy source in electronic 
applications, so it is important to understand its characteristics. The dc voltage source
ideally provides constant voltage to a load even when the load resistance varies.

In reality, no voltage source is ideal; however, regulated power supplies can approach
ideal when operated within the specified output current. All voltage sources have some in-
herent internal resistance as a result of their physical and/or chemical makeup, which can
be represented by a resistor in series with an ideal source, as shown in Figure 2(a).

Transistors act basically as current sources, and for this reason, knowledge of the cur-
rent source concept is important. You will find that the equivalent model of a transistor
does contain a current source.
Although the ideal current source can be used in most analysis work, no actual device is
ideal. A practical current source representation is shown in Figure 5. Here the internal re-
sistance appears in parallel with the ideal current source.

is so much larger
than the load resistance that 
can be neglected. This simplifies the source to ideal, mak-
ing the analysis easier.

Equivalency of two sources means that for any given load resistance connected to the
two sources, the same load voltage and load current are produced by both sources. This
concept is called terminal equivalency.
You can show that the voltage source and the current source in Figure 7 are equiva-

THE SUPERPOSITION THEOREM
Some circuits use more than one voltage or current source. For example, most ampli-
fiers operate with two voltage sources: an ac and a dc source. Additionally, some am-
plifiers require both a positive and a negative dc voltage source for proper operation.
When multiple sources are used in a circuit, the superposition theorem provides a
method for analysis.
After completing this section, you should be able to

CIRCUIT THEOREMS AND CONVERSIONS
The superposition method is a way to determine currents in a circuit with multiple
sources by leaving one source at a time and replacing the other sources by their internal
resistances. Recall that an ideal voltage source has a zero internal resistance and an ideal
current source has infinite internal resistance. All sources will be treated as ideal in order to
simplify the coverage.
A general statement of the superposition theorem is as follows:
The current in any given branch of a multiple-source circuit can be found by deter-
mining the currents in that particular branch produced by each source acting
alone, with all other sources replaced by their internal resistances. The total cur-
rent in the branch is the algebraic sum of the individual currents in that branch.
The steps in applying the superposition method are as follows:
Step 1: Leave one voltage (or current) source at a time in the circuit and replace each
of the other voltage (or current) sources with its internal resistance. For ideal
sources a short represents zero internal resistance and an open represents infi-
nite internal resistance.
Step 2: Determine the particular current (or voltage) that you want just as if there were
only one source in the circuit.
Step 3: Take the next source in the circuit and repeat Steps 1 and 2. Do this for each source.
Step 4: To find the actual current in a given branch, algebraically sum the currents due
to each individual source. Once you find the current, you can determine the
voltage using Ohm’s law.
The approach to superposition is demonstrated in Figure 16 for a series-parallel 
circuit with two ideal voltage sources. Study the steps in this figure.

CIRCUIT THEOREMS AND CONVERSIONS
Although regulated dc power supplies are close to ideal voltage sources, many ac
sources are not. For example, function generators generally have 
or 
of inter-
nal resistance, which appears as a resistance in series with an ideal source. Also, batteries
can look ideal when they are fresh; but as they age, the internal resistance increases. When
applying the superposition theorem, it is important to recognize when a source is not ideal
and replace it with its equivalent internal resistance.
Current sources are not as common as voltage sources and are also not always ideal. If
a current source is not ideal, as in the case of many transistors, it should be replaced by its
equivalent internal resistance when the superposition theorem is applied.

The general form of a thevenin
equivalent circuit is a voltage source
in series with a resistance.
Thevenin was a French telegraph
engineer who became increasingly
interested in the problems of
measurement in electrical circuits.
As a result of studying Kirchhoff’s
circuit laws and Ohm’s law, in
1882 he developed a method, now
known as Thévenin’s theorem,
which made it possible to analyze
a complex electrical circuit by
reducing it to a simple equivalent
circuit.

The Thevenin equivalent voltage (VTH) is the open circuit (no-load) voltage
between two output terminals in a circuit.

As defined by Thevenin’s theorem,
The Thevenin equivalent resistance (RTH) is the total resistance appearing between
two terminals in a given circuit with all sources replaced by their internal resistances.
Although a Thevenin equivalent circuit is not the same as its original circuit, it acts the
same in terms of the output voltage and current. Try the following demonstration as illus-
trated in Figure 31. Place a resistive circuit of any complexity in a box with only the

output terminals exposed. Then place the Thevenin equivalent of that circuit in an identical
box with, again, only the output terminals exposed. Connect identical load resistors across
the output terminals of each box. Next connect a voltmeter and an ammeter to measure the
voltage and current for each load as shown in the figure. The measured values will be iden-
tical (neglecting tolerance variations), and you will not be able to determine which box
contains the original circuit and which contains the Thevenin equivalent. That is, in terms
of your observations based on any electrical measurements, both circuits appear to be the
same. This condition is sometimes known as terminal equivalency because both circuits
look the same from the “viewpoint” of the two output terminals.
To find the Thevenin equivalent of any circuit, determine the equivalent voltage, 
and the equivalent resistance, 
looking from the output terminals. As an example, the
Thevenin equivalent for the circuit between terminals A and B is developed in Figure 32.

Thevenin Equivalency Depends on the Viewpoint
The Thevenin equivalent for any circuit depends on the location of the two output terminals
from which the circuit is “viewed.” In Figure 33, you viewed the circuit from between the 
two terminals labeled A and B. Any given circuit can have more than one Thevenin equivalent,
depending on how the output terminals are designated. For example, if you view the circuit in
Figure 35 from between terminals A and C, you obtain a completely different result than if 
you viewed it from between terminals A and B or from between terminals B and C.

Thevenizing a Portion of a Circuit
In many cases, it helps to thevenize only a portion of a circuit. For example, when you need
to know the equivalent circuit as viewed by one particular resistor in the circuit, you can
remove the resistor and apply Thevenin’s theorem to the remaining part of the circuit as
viewed from the points between which that resistor was connected. Figure 39 illustrates

A Wheatstone bridge with a load 
resistor connected between the output
terminals is not a straightforward 
series-parallel circuit.
Using this type of approach, you can easily find the voltage and current for a specified
resistor for any number of resistor values using only Ohm’s law. This method eliminates
the necessity of reanalyzing the original circuit for each different resistance value.
Thevenizing a Bridge Circuit
The usefulness of Thevenin’s theorem is perhaps best illustrated when it is applied to a
Wheatstone bridge circuit. For example, when a load resistor is connected to the output ter-
minals of a Wheatstone bridge, as shown in Figure 40, the circuit is difficult to analyze 
because it is not a straightforward series-parallel arrangement. There are no resistors that
are in series or in parallel with another resistor.
Using Thevenin’s theorem, you can simplify the bridge circuit to an equivalent circuit
viewed from the load resistor as shown step-by-step in Figure 41. Study carefully the 
steps in this figure. Once the equivalent circuit for the bridge is found, the voltage and cur-
rent for any value of load resistor can easily be determined.

An Alternate Approach
An alternate way to thevenize the Wheatstone bridge is to con-
sider a different viewpoint. Instead of viewing it from between the A and B terminals, you
can view it from terminal A to ground and from terminal B to ground, as illustrated in
Figure 44(a) and (b). The resulting equivalent circuit is simplified into two facing 
Thevenin circuits that still include ground, as illustrated in Figure 44(c). When calculat-
ing the Thevenin resistance, replace the voltage source by a short; thus, two of the bridge
resistors are shorted out. In Figure 44(a), 
and 
are shorted and in part (b) 
and 
are shorted. In each case, the remaining two resistors appear in parallel to form the
Thevenin resistance. The load resistor can be replaced as in Figure 44(d), which is seen 
to be a simple series circuit with two opposing sources. The advantage of this method is
that ground is still shown in this equivalent circuit, so it is easy to find the voltage at termi-
nal A or B with respect to ground by applying the superposition theorem to the equivalent
circuit.
Summary of Thevenin’s Theorem
Remember, the Thevenin equivalent circuit is always in the form of an equivalent voltage
source in series with an equivalent resistance regardless of the original circuit that it replaces.

CIRCUIT THEOREMS AND CONVERSIONS
The significance of Thevenin’s theorem is that the equivalent circuit can replace the origi-
nal circuit as far as any external load is concerned. Any load resistor connected between the
terminals of a Thevenin equivalent circuit will have the same current through it and the
same voltage across it as if it were connected to the terminals of the original circuit.
A summary of steps for applying Thevenin’s theorem is as follows:
Step 1: Open the two terminals (remove any load) between which you want to find the
Thevenin equivalent circuit.
Step 2: Determine the voltage (
) across the two open terminals.
Step 3: Determine the resistance (
) between the two open terminals with all
sources replaced with their internal resistances (ideal voltage sources shorted
and ideal current sources opened).
Step 4: Connect 
and 
in series to produce the complete Thevenin equivalent
for the original circuit.
Step 5: Replace the load removed in Step 1 across the terminals of the Thevenin
equivalent circuit. You can now calculate the load current and load voltage
using only Ohm’s law. They have the same value as the load current and load
voltage in the original circuit.
Determining VTH and RTH by Measurement
Thevenin’s theorem is largely an analytical tool that is applied theoretically in order to sim-
plify circuit analysis. However, you can find Thevenin’s equivalent for an actual circuit by
the following general measurement methods. These steps are illustrated in Figure 45.
Step 1: Remove any load from the output terminals of the circuit.
Step 2: Measure the open terminal voltage. The voltmeter used must have an internal
resistance much greater (at least 10 times greater) than the 
of the circuit so
that it has negligible loading effect. (

Step 3: Connect a variable resistor (rheostat) across the output terminals. Set it at its

Step 4: Adjust the rheostat until the terminal voltage equals 0.5
At this point, the
resistance of the rheostat is equal to 
Step 5: Disconnect the rheostat from the terminals and measure its resistance with an

This procedure for determining 
differs from the theoretical procedure because it is
impractical to short voltage sources or open current sources in an actual circuit. Also, when
measuring 
be certain that the circuit is capable of providing the required current to the
variable resistor load and that the variable resistor can handle the required power. These
considerations may make the procedure impractical in some cases.
An Example of a Practical Application

NORTON’S THEOREM
Like Thevenin’s theorem, Norton’s theorem provides a method of reducing a more
complex circuit to a simpler equivalent form. The basic difference is that Norton’s the-

equivalent circuit with only a current source in parallel with a resistor. The form of Nor-
ton’s equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 48. Regardless of how complex the original 
two-terminal circuit is, it can always be reduced to this equivalent form. The equivalent
current source is designated

Summary of Norton’s Theorem
Any load resistor connected between the output terminals of a Norton equivalent circuit
will have the same current through it and the same voltage across it as if it were connected
to the output terminals of the original circuit. A summary of steps for theoretically apply-
ing Norton’s theorem is as follows:
Step 1: Short the two terminals between which you want to find the Norton equivalent
circuit.
Step 2: Determine the current (
) through the shorted terminals.
Step 3: Determine the resistance (
) between the two open terminals with all sources
replaced with their internal resistances (ideal voltage sources shorted and ideal
current sources opened). 
Step 4: Connect 
and 
in parallel to produce the complete Norton equivalent for
the original circuit.
Norton’s equivalent circuit can also be derived from Thevenin’s equivalent circuit by
use of the source conversion method discussed in Section 3.
An Example of a Practical Application
A voltage amplifier in a digital light meter is modeled using a Norton equivalent circuit and
a dependent voltage source. A block diagram of the light meter is shown in Figure 53. 
The light meter uses a photocell as a sensor. The photocell is a current source that produces
a very small current proportional to the incident light. Because it is a current source, a Nor-
ton circuit can be used to model the photocell. The very small amount of current from the
photocell is converted to a small input voltage across 
A dc amplifier is used to increase
the voltage to a level sufficient for driving the analog-to-digital converter.

Application of -to-Y Conversion to a Bridge Circuit
In Section 5 you learned how Thevenin’s theorem can be used to simplify a bridge cir-
cuit. Now you will see how -to-Y conversion can be used for converting a bridge circuit

Application Activity
The Wheatstone bridge circuit was 
expanded in this chapter to include the
use of Thevenin’s theorem. You may
have encountered a circuit application
th  used a thermistor in one arm of the bridge to sense tempera-
ture. The bridge was used to compare the resistance of the ther-
mistor with the resistance of a rheostat, which set the emperature
at which the output would switch from one polarity to the oppo-
site for turning on a heater in a tank filled with a liquid. In this
application activity, you will work with a similar circuit, but this
time it will be used to monitor the temperature in the tank to
provide a visual indication that the temperature is within a speci-
fied range.
The Temperature Monitor
The basic measuring circuit in the temperature monitor is a
Wheatstone bridge with an ammeter and a series resistor acting as
the load. The meter is an analog panel meter with a sensitivity of
full scale. The Wheatstone bridge temperature-measuring
circuit is shown in Figure 68(a), and the meter panel is shown 
in Figure 68(b).
The Thermistor
The thermistor is a Thermometrics RL2006-13.3K-140-D1 ther-
mistor with a specified resistance of 
at 25°C and a 
of
4615K. Recall that 
is a constant supplied by the manufacturer
that indicates the shape of the temperature-resistance character-
istic. The exponential equation for the resistance of a thermistor
is approximated by

temperature (K)
a constant (K) provided by the manufacturer
A plot of this equation is given in Figure 69. You can confirm
that your thermistor resistance calculations in this circuit appli-
cation are in reasonable agreement with this plot.
Temperature Measuring Circuit
The Wheatstone bridge is designed to be balanced at 20°C. The
resistance of the thermistor is approximately 
at this tem-
perature. You can confirm this value by substituting the tempera-
ture (in Kelvin) into the equation for 
Remember that the
temperature in K is °C
1. Substituting into the equation for 
calculate the resist-
ance of the thermistor at a temperature of 50°C (full-scale
deflection of the meter).
2. Thevenize the bridge between terminals A and B by keeping
the ground reference and forming two facing Thevenin cir-
cuits as was illustrated in Figure 44. Assume the thermis-
tor temperature is 50°C and its resistance is the value
calculated previously. Draw the Thevenin circuit for this
temperature but do not show a load.
3. Show the load resistor for the Thevenin circuit you drew.
The load is a resistor in series with the ammeter, which will
have a current of 
at full scale (50°C). You can find
the value of the required load resistor by applying the

The Meter Scale
A requirement for the temperature monitor is to mark three color
bands on the meter to indicate that the temperature is within the
desired range. The desired range is between a low of 30°C and
40°C. The meter should indicate a too-cold range from 20°C to
30°C, a proper operating range from 30°C to 40°C, and a too hot
range from 40°C and 50°C. Full-scale deflection of the meter
should be set for 50°C
5. Indicate how you would mark the meter to have a quick 
visual indication of the temperature in the tank.

SUMMARY
◆An ideal voltage source has zero internal resistance. It provides a constant voltage across its ter-
minals regardless of the load resistance.
◆A practical voltage source has a nonzero internal resistance.
◆An ideal current source has infinite internal resistance. It provides a constant current regardless of
the load resistance.
◆A practical current source has a finite internal resistance.
◆The superposition theorem is useful for multiple-source circuits.
◆Thevenin’s theorem provides for the reduction of any two-terminal linear resistive circuit to
an equivalent form consisting of an equivalent voltage source in series with an equivalent
resistance.
◆The term equivalency, as used in Thevenin’s and Norton’s theorems, means that when a given load
resistance is connected to the equivalent circuit, it will have the same voltage across it and the
same current through it as when it was connected to the original circuit.
◆Norton’s theorem provides for the reduction of any two-terminal linear resistive circuit to
an equivalent form consisting of an equivalent current source in parallel with an equivalent
resistance.
◆Maximum power is transferred to a load from a source when the load resistance equals the inter-
nal source resistance.

INTRODUCTION
In this chapter, three circuit analysis methods are intro-
duced. These methods, based on Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s
laws, are particularly useful in the analysis of multiple-loop
circuits having two or more voltage or current sources. The
methods presented here can be used alone or 
in conjunction with the techniques covered in the previous
chapters. With experience, you will learn which method is
best for a particular problem or you may develop a prefer-
ence for one of them.
In the branch current method, you will apply Kirchhoff’s
laws to solve for current in various branches of a multiple-
loop circuit. A loop is a complete current path within a 
circuit. In the loop current method, you will solve for loop
currents rather than branch currents. In the node voltage
method, you will find the voltages at the independent nodes
in a circuit. As you know, a node is the junction of two or
more components.

BRANCH, LOOP, AND NODE ANALYSES
Simultaneous equations consist of a set of n equations containing n unknowns, where
n is a number with a value of 2 or more. The number of equations in the set must equal the
number of unknowns. For example, to solve for two unknown variables, you must have two
equations; to solve for three unknowns you must have three equations, and so on.
Standard Form Equations
An equation with two variables is called a second-order equation. In circuit analysis, the vari-
ables can represent unknowns such as current or voltage. In order to solve for variables 
and
there must be a set of two equations containing those variables expressed in standard form.
In standard form, the 
variables are in the first position in each equation, and the 
variables are in the second position in each equation. The variables with their coefficients
are on the left side of the equation, and the constants are on the right side.
The set of two simultaneous second-order equations written in standard form is
In these simultaneous equations, the “a” is the coefficient of the variables 
and 
and can
represent values of circuit components, such as resistors. Notice that the subscripts of the
coefficients contain two numbers. For example, 
appears in the first equation as the co-
efficient of 
and 
appears in the second equation as the coefficient of 
The “b” is the
constant and can represent a voltage source. This notation will be useful when you use a
calculator to solve the equations.

SIMULTANEOUS EQUATIONS IN CIRCUIT ANALYSIS
The circuit analysis methods covered in this chapter allow you to find two or more
unknown currents or voltages by solving simultaneous equations. These analysis
methods, which include branch current, loop current, and node voltage methods, result
in a number of equations equal to the number of unknowns. Coverage is limited to
equations with two unknowns (2nd order) and equations with three unknowns (3rd order). 
These equations can then be solved simultaneously for the unknown quantities using
one of the methods covered in this section.
After completing this section, you should be able to

A third-order equation contains three variables and a constant term. Just as in second-
order equations, each variable has a coefficient. In order to solve for the variables 
and
there must be a set of three simultaneous equations containing those variables. The gen-
eral form for three simultaneous third-order equations written in standard form is
 a3,1x1 + a3,2x2 + a3,3x3 = b3
 a2,1x1 + a2,2x2 + a2,3x3 = b2

Solutions of Simultaneous Equations
Three ways for solving simultaneous equations are algebraic substitution, the determinant
method, and using a calculator.
Solving by Substitution
You can solve two or three simultaneous equations in standard
form using algebraic substitution by first solving one of the variables in terms of the others.

BRANCH, LOOP, AND NODE ANALYSES
However, because the process can become quite lengthy, we will restrict this method to
second-order equations. Consider the following set of simultaneous equations:
Step 1: Solve for 
in terms of 
in Eq. 1.
Step 2: Substitute the result for 
into Eq. 2 and solve for 
Step 3: Substitute the value for 
into the equation for 
in Step 1.
Solving by Determinants
The determinant method is a part of matrix algebra and pro-
vides a “cookbook” approach for solving simultaneous equations with two or three vari-
ables. A matrix is an array of numbers, and a determinant is effectively the solution to a
matrix, resulting in a specific value. Second-order determinants are used for two variables
and third-order determinants are used for three variables. The equations must be in stan-
dard form for a solution.
To illustrate the determinant method for second-order equations, let’s find the values of
and 
in the following two equations expressed in standard form. The coefficients are re-
sistance values in ohms, and the constants are voltage values in volts.
First, form the characteristic determinant from the matrix of the coefficients of the un-
known currents. The first column in the determinant consists of the coefficients of 
and
the second column consists of the coefficients of 
The resulting determinant is
1st column
2nd column
An evaluation of this characteristic determinant requires three steps.
Step 1: Multiply the first number in the left column by the second number in the right
column.
Step 2: Multiply the second number in the left column by the first number in the right
column.
Step 3: Subtract the product in Step 2 from the product in Step 1.

This difference is the value of the characteristic determinant (30 in this case).
Next, replace the coefficients of 
in the first column of the characteristic determinant with
the constants (fixed numbers) on the right side of the equations to form another determinant:
Replace coefficients of I1
with constants from
right sides of equations.
Evaluate this 
determinant as follows:
The value of this determinant is 20.
Now solve for

determinant by the characteristic determinant as follows:

this method by finding the unknown current values in the following three equations ex-

Calculators generally employ matrix algorithms for simultaneous
equation solution and make the results much easier to obtain. As with the two “manual”
methods, it is important to first get the equations into the standard form before entering data
on a calculator. Calculators that offer simultaneous equation solutions generally employ
the notation discussed earlier in relation to the general form of equations. Variables are la-
beled as

designated as

a set of nonredundant closed loops as a set of “windowpanes,” where each windowpane
represents one nonredundant loop. Also, there are four nodes as indicated by the letters A,
B, C, and D. A node is a point where two or more components are connected. A branch

BRANCH CURRENT METHOD
The branch current method is a circuit analysis method using Kirchhoff’s voltage and
current laws to find the current in each branch of a circuit by generating simultaneous
equations. Once you know the branch currents, you can determine voltages.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Use the branch current method to find unknown quantities in a circuit
◆Identify loops and nodes in a circuit
◆Develop a set of branch current equations
◆Solve the branch current equations
The following are the general steps used in applying the branch current method.
Step 1: Assign a current in each circuit branch in an arbitrary direction.
Step 2: Show the polarities of the resistor voltages according to the assigned branch
current directions.
Step 3: Apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law around each closed loop (algebraic sum of volt-
ages is equal to zero).
Step 4: Apply Kirchhoff’s current law at the minimum number of nodes so that all
branch currents are included (algebraic sum of currents at a node equals zero).
Step 5: Solve the equations resulting from Steps 3 and 4 for the branch current values.

A systematic method of loop analysis is given in the following steps and is illustrated in
Figure 9, which is the same circuit configuration used in the branch current analysis. It
demonstrates the basic principles well.
Step 1: Although direction of an assigned loop current is arbitrary, we will assign a
current in the counterclockwise (CCW) direction around each nonredundant
closed loop, for consistency. This may not be the actual current direction, but it
does not matter. The number of loop-current assignments must be sufficient to
include current through all components in the circuit.
Step 2: Indicate the voltage drop polarities in each loop based on the assigned current
directions.
Step 3: Apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law around each closed loop. When more than one
loop current passes through a component, include its voltage drop. This results
in one equation for each loop.
Step 4: Using substitution or determinants, solve the resulting equations for the loop
currents.

LOOP CURRENT METHOD
In the loop current method (also known as the mesh current method), you will work
with loop currents instead of branch currents. An ammeter placed in a given branch
will measure the branch current. Unlike branch currents, loop currents are mathemati-
cal quantities, rather than actual physical currents, that are used to make circuit analy-
sis somewhat easier than with the branch current method.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Use loop analysis to find unknown quantities in a circuit
◆Assign loop currents
◆Apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law around each loop
◆Develop the loop equations
◆Solve the loop equations
First, the loop currents
and 
are assigned in the CCW direction as shown in Figure
9. A loop current could be assigned around the outer perimeter of the circuit, but this 
would be redundant since 
and 
already pass through all of the components.
Second, the polarities of the voltage drops across 
and 
are shown based on the
loop-current directions. Notice that 
and 
are in opposite directions through 
because 
is common to both loops. Therefore, two voltage polarities are indicated. In

reality, the 
current cannot be separated into two parts, but remember that the loop cur-
rents are basically mathematical quantities used for analysis purposes. The polarities of
the voltage sources are fixed and are not affected by the current assignments.
Third, Kirchhoff’s voltage law applied to the two loops results in the following two
equations:
Notice that 
is positive in loop A and 
is positive in loop B.
Fourth, the like terms in the equations are combined and rearranged into standard form
for convenient solution so that they have the same position in each equation, that is, the 
term is first and the 
term is second. The equations are rearranged into the following
form. Once the loop currents are evaluated, all of the branch currents can be determined.
Notice that in the loop current method only two equations are required for the same cir-
cuit that required three equations in the branch current method. The last two equations (de-
veloped in the fourth step) follow a form to make loop analysis easier. Referring to these
last two equations, notice that for loop A, the total resistance in the loop, 
is mul-
tiplied by 
(its loop current). Also in the loop A equation, the resistance common to both
loops, 
is multiplied by the other loop current, 
and subtracted from the first term. The
same form is seen in the loop B equation except that the terms have been rearranged. From
these observations, a concise rule for applying steps 1 to 4 is as follows:
(Sum of resistors in loop) times (loop current) minus (each resistor common to both
loops) times (associated adjacent loop current) equals (source voltage in the loop).
Example 8 illustrates the application of this rule to the loop current analysis of a circuit.

Circuits with More Than Two Loops
The loop current method can be systematically applied to circuits with any number of
loops. Of course, the more loops there are, the more difficult is the solution, but calculators
have greatly simplified solving simultaneous equations. Most circuits that you will en-
counter will not have more than three loops. Keep in mind that the loop currents are not the
actual physical currents but are mathematical quantities assigned for analysis purposes.
A widely used circuit that you have already encountered is the Wheatstone bridge. The
Wheatstone bridge was originally designed as a stand-alone measuring instrument but has
largely been replaced with other instruments. However, the Wheatstone bridge circuit is in-
corporated in automated measuring instruments, and as explained previously, is widely
used in the scale industry and in other measurement applications.
One method for solving the bridge parameters, which directly leads to finding the cur-
rent in each arm of the bridge and the load current, is to write loop equations for the bridge.
Figure 11 shows a Wheatstone bridge with three loops. Example 9 illustrates how to 
solve for all of the currents in the bridge.

Another useful three-loop circuit is the bridged-T circuit. While the circuit is primarily
applied in ac filter circuits using reactive components, it is introduced here to illustrate the
three-loop circuit solution. A loaded resistive bridged-T is shown in Figure 13.
Resistors will often be in

NODE VOLTAGE METHOD
Another method of analysis of multiple-loop circuits is called the node voltage method.
It is based on finding the voltages at each node in the circuit using Kirchhoff’s current
law. Recall that a node is the junction of two or more components.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Use node analysis to find unknown quantities in a circuit
◆Select the nodes at which the voltage is unknown and assign currents
◆Apply Kirchhoff’s current law at each node
◆Develop and solve the node equations
The general steps for the node voltage method of circuit analysis are as follows:
Step 1: Determine the number of nodes.
Step 2: Select one node as a reference. All voltages will be relative to the reference
node. Assign voltage designations to each node where the voltage is unknown.
Step 3: Assign currents at each node where the voltage is unknown, except at the ref-
erence node. The directions are arbitrary.
Step 4: Apply Kirchhoff’s current law to each node where currents are assigned.
Step 5: Express the current equations in terms of voltages, and solve the equations for
the unknown node voltages using Ohm’s law.

BRANCH, LOOP, AND NODE ANALYSES
We will use Figure 16 to illustrate the general approach to node voltage analysis. 
First, establish the nodes. In this case, there are four nodes, as indicated in the figure. Sec-
ond, let’s use node B as the reference. Think of it as the circuit’s reference ground. Node
voltages C and D are already known to be the source voltages. The voltage at node A is the
only unknown; it is designated as 
Third, arbitrarily assign the branch currents at node
A as indicated in the figure. Fourth, the Kirchhoff current equation at node A is
Fifth, express the currents in terms of circuit voltages using Ohm’s law.
Substituting these terms into the current equation yields
The only unknown is 
; so solve the single equation by combining and rearranging
terms. Once you know the voltage, you can calculate all branch currents. Example 11 il-
lustrates this method further.

The reference node is chosen at B. The unknown node voltage is

A as shown. The current equation is
Substitution for currents using Ohm’s law gives the equation in terms of voltages.

You can now determine the branch currents.

Example 11 illustrated an obvious advantage to the node method. The branch current
method required three equations for the three unknown currents. The loop current method
reduced the number of simultaneous equations but required the extra step of converting the
fictitious loop currents to the actual currents in the resistors. The node method for the cir-
cuit in Figure 17 reduced the equations to one, in which all of the currents were written 
in terms of one unknown node voltage. The node voltage method also has the advantage of
finding unknown voltages, which are easier to directly measure than current.
Node Voltage Method for a Wheatstone Bridge
The node voltage method can be applied to a Wheatstone bridge. The Wheatstone bridge is
shown with nodes identified in Figure 18 with currents shown. Node D is usually

BRANCH, LOOP, AND NODE ANALYSES
selected as the reference node, and node A has the same potential as the source voltage.
When setting up the equations for the two unknown node voltages (B and C ), it is neces-
sary to specify a current direction as described in the general steps. The direction of current
in 
is dependent on the bridge resistances; if the assigned direction is incorrect, it will
show up as a negative current in the solution.
Kirchhoff’s current law is then written for each of the unknown nodes. Each current is
then expressed in terms of node voltages using Ohm’s law as follows:
Node B:
Node C:

Node Voltage Method for the Bridged-T Circuit
Applying the node voltage method to the bridged-T circuit also results in two equations
with two unknowns. As in the case of the Wheatstone bridge, there are four nodes as shown
in Figure 20. Node D is the reference and node A is the source voltage, so the two un-
known voltages are at nodes C and D. The effect of a load resistor on the circuit is usually
the most important question, so the voltage at node C is the focus. A calculator solution of
the simultaneous equations is simplified for analyzing the effect of various loads because
only the equation for node C is affected when the load changes. Example 13 illustrates 
this idea.

Application Activity
In this circuit application, you will see
how a particular type of amplifier can
be modeled and analyzed using the
methods introduced in this chapter. The
point is not to learn how amplifiers work because that is beyond
the scope of this text and will be covered in a later course. The 
focus is on the application of circuit analysis methods to circuit
models and not the amplifier itself. The amplifier is simply used as
an example to illustrate how you can apply analysis methods to a
practical circuit.
Operational amplifiers are integrated circuit devices that are
widely used in analog applications for signal processing. An
operational amplifier symbol is shown in Figure 23(a). The
equivalent dependent source model is shown in part (b). The
gain (A) of the dependent source can be positive or negative,
depending on how it is configured.
Assume you need to calculate in detail the effect of an opera-
tional amplifier circuit on a transducer that serves as an input.
Some transducers, such as pH meters, appear as a small source
voltage with a high series resistance. The transducer that is
shown here is modeled as a small Thevenin dc voltage source in
series with a Thevenin resistance of 
.
Practical amplifiers are created using an operational ampli-
fier with external components. Figure 24(a) shows one type 
of amplifier configuration that includes the Thevenin resistance
of the source along with two other external resistors.

from the operational amplifier output to ground as a load, 
and 
is connected from the output to the input as a feedback
resistor. Feedback is used in most operational amplifier 
circuits and is simply a path from the output back to the 
input. It has many advantages as you will learn in a later
course.

SUMMARY
◆Simultaneous equations can be solved by substitution, by determinants, or by a graphics calculator.
◆The number of equations must be equal to the number of unknowns.
◆Second-order determinants are evaluated by adding the signed cross-products.
◆Third-order determinants are evaluated by the expansion method.
◆The branch current method is based on Kirchhoff’s voltage law and Kirchhoff’s current law.
Figure 24(b) is the equivalent circuit model of the source, 
the op-amp, and the load that we will use for analysis purposes.
The internal gain of the dependent source, shown with the letter
A on the op-amp block, is negative because it is an inverting am-
plifier (the output has the opposite sign of the input). This inter-
nal gain is generally extremely high. Although it is a very large
number, the actual gain of the circuit with the external compo-
nents is much lower because it is controlled by the external com-
ponents rather than the internal gain.
The specific values for the circuit in this application are given in
Figure 25 along with assigned currents. All values are shown in 
to simplify entering the coefficients in the equations that you
will use. Although op-amp circuits have excellent simple approxi-
mations for determining the output voltage, there are times you may
want to know the exact output. You can apply your knowledge from
this chapter to the circuit to find the exact output voltage.
The amplifier model in Figure 25 can be analyzed easiest 
with the node voltage method because there are only two nodes, A
and B, that have unknown voltages. At node A, the voltage is des-
ignated and is the same as the input to the op-amp 
At node
B, the voltage is designated and also represents the output (or load
voltage), 
Current names and directions are assigned as shown.
Analysis
Apply Kirchhoff’s current law at each of the unknown nodes to
write the node equations.

INTRODUCTION
This chapter introduces the concepts of magnetism and elec-
tromagnetism. The operation of devices such as the relay,
the solenoid, and the speaker is based partially on magnetic
or electromagnetic principles. Electromagnetic induction is
important in an electrical component called an inductor 
or coil.
Two types of magnets are the permanent magnet and the
electromagnet. The permanent magnet maintains a constant
magnetic field between its two poles with no external excita-
tion. The electromagnet produces a magnetic field only
when there is current through it. The electromagnet is basi-
cally a coil of wire wound around a magnetic core material.
The chapter concludes with an introduction to dc genera-
tors and dc motors.

A permanent magnet, such as the bar magnet shown in Figure 1, has a magnetic field
surrounding it. All magnetic fields have their origin in moving charge, which in solid ma-
terials is caused by moving electrons. In certain materials such as iron, atoms can be
aligned so that the electron motion is reinforced, creating a measurable field that extends in
three dimensions. Even some electrical insulators can exhibit this behavior; ceramics make
excellent magnets but are electrical insulators.

THE MAGNETIC FIELD
A permanent magnet has a magnetic field surrounding it. A magnetic field is visual-
ized by lines of force that radiate from the north pole (N) to the south pole (S) and
back to the north pole through the magnetic material.
After completing this section, you should be able to

lines of force in the magnetic field.

 FIGURE 1
Magnetic lines of force around a bar

To illustrate magnetic fields, “lines of force” or flux lines are used to represent an un-
seen field. Flux lines are widely used as a description of a field, showing the strength and
direction of the field. The flux lines never cross. When lines are close together, the field is
more intense; when they are farther apart, the field is weaker. The flux lines are always
drawn from the north pole (N) to the south pole (S) of a magnet. Even in small magnets, the
number of lines based on the mathematical definition is extremely large, so for clarity, only
a few lines are generally shown in drawings of magnetic fields.
When unlike poles of two permanent magnets are placed close together, their magnetic
fields produce an attractive force, as indicated in Figure 2(a). When two like poles are
brought close together, they repel each other, as shown in part (b).
When a nonmagnetic material such as paper, glass, wood, or plastic is placed in a mag-
netic field, the lines of force are unaltered, as shown in Figure 3(a). However, when a 
magnetic material such as iron is placed in the magnetic field, the lines of force tend to
change course and pass through the iron rather than through the surrounding air. They do
so because the iron provides a magnetic path that is more easily established than that of air.
Weber was a German physicist
who worked closely with Gauss,
whose biography appears later.
Independently, he established a
system of absolute electrical units
and also performed work that was
crucial to the later development of
the electromagnetic theory of
light. The unit of magnetic flux is
named in his honor. (Photo credit:

Figure 3(b) illustrates this principle. The fact that magnetic lines of force follow a path
through iron or other materials is a consideration in the design of shields that prevent stray
magnetic fields from affecting sensitive circuits.
Magnetic Flux ( )
The group of force lines going from the north pole to the south pole of a magnet is called
the magnetic flux, symbolized by 
(the Greek letter phi). A stronger field is represented
by more lines of force. Several factors determine the strength of a magnet, including the
material and physical geometry as well as the distance from the magnet. Magnetic field
lines tend to be more concentrated at the poles.
The unit of magnetic flux is the weber (Wb). One weber equals 
lines. The weber is
a very large unit; thus, in most practical situations, the microweber (
) is used. One
microweber equals 100 lines of magnetic flux.

ac systems, the Tesla coil
transformer, wireless
communications, and fluorescent
lights. He worked for Edison when

Magnetic Flux Density (B)
The magnetic flux density is the amount of flux per unit area perpendicular to the mag-
netic field. Its symbol is B, and its SI unit is the tesla (T). One tesla equals one weber per
square meter (
). The following formula expresses the flux density:

MAGNETISM AND ELECTROMAGNETISM
How Materials Become Magnetized
Ferromagnetic materials such as iron, nickel, and cobalt become magnetized when placed
in the magnetic field of a magnet. We have all seen a permanent magnet pick up things like
paper clips, nails, and iron filings. In these cases, the object becomes magnetized (that is, it
actually becomes a magnet itself) under the influence of the permanent magnetic field and
becomes attracted to the magnet. When removed from the magnetic field, the object tends
to lose its magnetism.
Ferromagnetic materials have minute magnetic domains created within their atomic
structure. These domains can be viewed as very small bar magnets with north and south

The Gauss
Although the tesla (T) is the SI unit for flux density, another unit called the
gauss, G, from the CGS (centimeter-gram-second) system, is used (
). In fact,
the instrument used to measure flux density is the gaussmeter. A typical gaussmeter is
shown in Figure 5. This particular gaussmeter is a portable unit with four ranges that 
can measure magnetic fields as small as the earth’s field (about 0.5 G, but changes de-
pending on location) to strong fields such as in a MRI unit (about 10,000 G). The unit gauss
is still in widespread use, so you should be familiar with it as well as the tesla.

systematic observations of
terrestrial magnetism. The most

others. The CGS unit of magnetic
flux density is named in his

poles. When the material is not exposed to an external magnetic field, the magnetic
domains are randomly oriented, as shown in Figure 6(a). When the material is placed 
in a magnetic field, the domains align themselves as shown in part (b). Thus, the object
itself effectively becomes a magnet.
Effects of the Magnetic Material
The magnetic material affects not only the magnetic
flux density at the poles but also how the magnetic flux density falls off as distance from
the poles increases. The physical size also affects the flux density. For example, two disk
magnets (both made from sintered Alnico) have very similar densities near the pole, but the
larger magnet has much higher flux density, as you move away from the pole, as shown in
Figure 7. Notice that the flux density falls off rapidly as you move away from the pole. 
This type of plot can illustrate if a given magnet is effective for a specific application that
depends on the distance in which the magnet must work.

Table 2 lists the flux densities of typical magnetic fields in teslas. For permanent mag-
nets, the numbers given are based on the flux density of the field that is typical if measured
close to the pole. As previously discussed, these values can drop significantly as distance
from the poles is increased. The strongest field most people will ever experience is about 
1 T (10,000 G) if they have an MRI exam. The strongest commercially available permanent
magnets are neodymium-iron-boron composites (NdFeB). To find the flux density in
gauss, multiply the values in teslas by 
(10,000).

Applications
Permanent magnets are widely used in brushless motors (discussed in Section 7), mag-
netic separators, speakers, microphones, automobiles, and magnetic resonance-imaging
devices. They are also commonly used in switches, such as the normally closed switch il-
lustrated in Figure 8. When the magnet is near the switch mechanism, as in Figure 
8(a), the switch is closed. When the magnet is moved away, as in part (b), the spring 
pulls the arm open. Magnetic switches are widely used in security systems.

Operation of a magnetic switch.
Another important application of permanent magnets is in sensors that take advantage
of an effect known as the Hall effect. The Hall effect is the occurrence of a small voltage
(a few 
) that is generated on opposite sides of a thin current-carrying conductor or semi-
conductor (the Hall element) in a magnetic field. A voltage called the Hall voltage appears
across the Hall element, as illustrated in Figure 9. The Hall voltage is due to the forces 
exerted on the electrons as they traverse the magnetic field, causing an excess of charge on
one side of the Hall element. Although the effect was first noticed in a conductor, it is more
pronounced in semiconductors, which are normally used in Hall-effect sensors. Notice that
the magnetic field, the electric current, and the Hall voltage are all at right angles to each
other. This voltage is amplified and can be used to detect the presence of the magnetic field.
The detection of a magnetic field is useful in sensor applications.
Hall-effect sensors are widely used because they are small, inexpensive, and have no
moving parts. In addition, they are noncontacting sensors, so they can last for billions
of repeated operations, a clear advantage over contacting sensors that can wear out.
Hall-effect sensors can detect the nearby presence of a magnet by sensing its magnetic
mV
The Hall effect was discovered by
Hall in 1879 while he worked on
his doctoral thesis in physics at
Johns Hopkins University. Hall’s
experiments consisted of exposing
thin gold leaf on a glass plate to a
magnetic field and tapping off the
gold leaf at points down its length.
After applying a current through
the gold leaf, he observed a tiny
voltage across the tap points.

devices such as drills, fans, vanes in flow meters, and disk speed detection. They are also
used in dc motors as will be seen in Section 7.

ELECTROMAGNETISM
Electromagnetism is the production of a magnetic field by current in a conductor.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Explain the principles of electromagnetism
◆Determine the direction of the magnetic lines of force
◆Define permeability
◆Define reluctance
◆Define magnetomotive force
◆Describe a basic electromagnet
Current produces a magnetic field, called an electromagnetic field, around a conduc-
tor, as illustrated in Figure 10. The invisible lines of force of the magnetic field form a 
concentric circular pattern around the conductor and are continuous along its length.
Unlike the bar magnet, the magnetic field surrounding a wire does not have a north or south
pole. The direction of the lines of force surrounding the conductor shown in the figure is
for electron flow. The lines are in a clockwise direction. When current is reversed, the mag-
netic field lines are in a counterclockwise direction.
Although the magnetic field cannot be seen, it is capable of producing visible effects. For
example, if a current-carrying wire is inserted through a sheet of paper in a perpendicular

direction, iron filings placed on the surface of the paper arrange themselves along the mag-
netic lines of force in concentric rings, as illustrated in Figure 11(a). Part (b) of the fig-
ure illustrates that the north pole of a compass placed in the electromagnetic field will point
in the direction of the lines of force. The field is stronger closer to the conductor and 
becomes weaker with increasing distance from the conductor.
Left-Hand Rule
An aid to remembering the direction of the lines of force is illustrated in
Figure 12. Imagine that you are grasping the conductor with your left hand, with your
thumb pointing in the direction of current. Your fingers point in the direction of the mag-
netic lines of force.

MAGNETISM AND ELECTROMAGNETISM
Electromagnetic Properties
Several important properties are related to electromagnetic fields.
Permeability (
)
The ease with which a magnetic field can be established in a given
material is measured by the permeability of that material. The higher the permeability, the
more easily a magnetic field can be established.
The symbol of permeability is 
(the Greek letter mu), and its value varies depending 
on the type of material. The permeability of a vacuum (
) is 
(
) and is used as a reference. Ferromagnetic materials typically
have permeabilities hundreds of times larger than that of a vacuum, indicating that a mag-
netic field can be set up with relative ease in these materials. Ferromagnetic materials
include iron, steel, nickel, cobalt, and their alloys.
The relative permeability (
) of a material is the ratio of its absolute permeability to the
permeability of a vacuum (m0).

Equation 2
Because it is a ratio of permeabilities, 
is dimensionless. Typical magnetic materials,
such as iron, have a relative permeability of a few hundred. Highly permeable materials can
have a relative permeability as high as 100,000.
Reluctance ()
The opposition to the establishment of a magnetic field in a material is
called reluctance. The value of reluctance is directly proportional to the length (l) of the
magnetic path and inversely proportional to the permeability ( ) and to the cross-sectional
area (A) of the material, as expressed by the following equation:
m
mr
mr = m
m0
Equation 3

Reluctance in magnetic circuits is analogous to resistance in electric circuits. The unit
of reluctance can be derived using l in meters, A (area) in square meters, and 
in
as follows:

At/Wb is ampere-turns/weber.
Equation 3 is similar to the equation for determining wire resistance:
The reciprocal of resistivity ( ) is conductivity ( ). By substituting 
for 
the equation
can be written as
Compare this last equation for wire resistance with Equation 3. The length (l) and 
the area (A) have the same meaning in both equations. The conductivity ( ) in electrical
circuits is analogous to permeability (m) in magnetic circuits. Also, resistance (R) in
electric circuits is analogous to reluctance () in magnetic circuits; both are oppositions.
Typically, the reluctance of a magnetic circuit is 50,000 At/Wb or more, depending on the
size and type of material.

MAGNETISM AND ELECTROMAGNETISM
Magnetomotive Force (mmf)
As you have learned, current in a conductor produces a
magnetic field. The cause of a magnetic field is called the magnetomotive force (mmf).
Magnetomotive force is something of a misnomer because in a physics sense mmf is not re-
ally a force, but rather it is a direct result of the movement of charge (current). The unit of
mmf, the ampere-turn (At), is established on the basis of the current in a single loop
(turn) of wire. The formula for mmf is

Equation 5
Equation 5 is known as the Ohm’s law for magnetic circuits because the flux ( ) is 
analogous to current, the mmf (
) is analogous to voltage, and the reluctance () is anal-
ogous to resistance. Like other phenomena in science, the flux is an effect, the mmf is a
cause, and the reluctance is an opposition.
One important difference between an electric circuit and a magnetic circuit is that in
magnetic circuits, Equation 5 is only valid up to a certain point before the magnetic ma-
terial saturates (flux becomes a maximum). You will see this when you look at magnetiza-
tion curves in Section 4. Another difference that was already noted is that flux does 
occur in permanent magnets with no source of mmf. In a permanent magnet, the flux is due
to internal electron motion rather than an external current. No equivalent effect occurs in
electric circuits.

MAGNETISM AND ELECTROMAGNETISM
In many magnetic circuits, the core is not continuous. For example, if an air gap is cut
into the core, it will increase the reluctance of the magnetic circuit. This means that more
current is required to establish the same flux as before because an air gap represents a sig-
nificant opposition to establishing flux. The situation is analogous to a series electrical cir-
cuit; the total reluctance of the magnetic circuit is the sum of the reluctance of the core and
the reluctance of the air gap.
The Electromagnet
An electromagnet is based on the properties that you have just learned. A basic elec-
tromagnet is simply a coil of wire wound around a core material that can be easily
magnetized.
The shape of an electromagnet can be designed for various applications. For example,
Figure 15 shows a U-shaped magnetic core. When the coil of wire is connected to a bat-
tery and there is current, as shown in part (a), a magnetic field is established as indicated.
If the current is reversed, as shown in part (b), the direction of the magnetic field is also re-
versed. The closer the north and south poles are brought together, the smaller the air gap
between them becomes, and the easier it becomes to establish a magnetic field because the
reluctance is lessened.

The basic solenoid operation is illustrated in Figure 17 for the unenergized and the

lenoid is energized by current through the coil, which sets up an electromagnetic field that
magnetizes both iron cores. The south pole of the stationary core attracts the north pole of

the movable core causing it to slide inward, thus retracting the plunger and compressing the
spring. As long as there is coil current, the plunger remains retracted by the attractive force
of the magnetic fields. When the current is cut off, the magnetic fields collapse and the
force of the compressed spring pushes the plunger back out. The solenoid is used for ap-
plications such as opening and closing valves and automobile door locks.
The Solenoid Valve
In industrial controls, solenoid valves are widely used to control the
flow of air, water, steam, oils, refrigerants, and other fluids. Solenoid valves are used in
both pneumatic (air) and hydraulic (oil) systems, common in machine controls. Solenoid
valves are also common in the aerospace and medical fields. Solenoid valves can either
move a plunger to open or close a port or can rotate a blocking flap a fixed amount.
A solenoid valve consists of two functional units: a solenoid coil that provides the mag-
netic field to provide the required movement to open or close the valve and a valve body,
which is isolated from the coil assembly via a leakproof seal and includes a pipe and but-
terfly valve. Figure 18 shows a cutaway of one type of solenoid valve. When the sole-
noid is energized, the butterfly valve is turned to open a normally closed (NC) valve or to
close a normally open (NO) valve.

Solenoid valves are available with a wide variety of configurations including normally
open or normally closed valves. They are rated for different types of fluids (for example,
gas or water), pressures, number of pathways, sizes, and more. The same valve may con-
trol more than one line and may have more than one solenoid to move.
The Relay
The relay differs from the solenoid in that the electromagnetic action is used to open or
close electrical contacts rather than to provide mechanical movement. Figure 19 shows 
the basic operation of an armature-type relay with one normally open (NO) contact and one
normally closed (NC) contact (single pole–double throw). When there is no coil current,
the armature is held against the upper contact by the spring, thus providing continuity from
412

MAGNETISM AND ELECTROMAGNETISM
terminal 1 to terminal 2, as shown in part (a) of the figure. When energized with coil current,
the armature is pulled down by the attractive force of the electromagnetic field and makes
connection with the lower contact to provide continuity from terminal 1 to terminal 3, as
shown in Figure 19(b). A typical armature relay is shown in part (c), and the schematic
symbol is shown in part (d).
Another widely used type of relay is the reed relay, which is shown in Figure 20. The 
reed relay, like the armature relay, uses an electromagnetic coil. The contacts are thin reeds of
magnetic material and are usually located inside the coil. When there is no coil current, the
reeds are in the open position as shown in part (b). When there is current through the coil, the
reeds make contact because they are magnetized and attract each other as shown in part (c).

MAGNETISM AND ELECTROMAGNETISM
Reed relays are superior to armature relays in that they are faster, more reliable, and pro-
duce less contact arcing. However, they have less current-handling capability than armature
relays and are more susceptible to mechanical shock.
The Speaker
A speaker is an electromagnetic device that converts electrical signals into sound. Essen-
tially, it is a linear motor that alternately attracts and repels an electromagnet to and from a
permanent magnet called a donut magnet. Figure 21 shows the key parts of a speaker. 
The audio signal is connected using very flexible wires to a cylindrical coil called the voice
coil. The voice coil and its movable core form an electromagnet, which is suspended in an
accordion-like structure called the spider. The spider acts like an accordion spring, keeping
the voice coil in the center and restoring it to the rest position when there is no input signal.
Current from the audio input alternates back and forth and powers the electromagnet;
when there is more current, the attraction or repulsion is greater. When the input current re-
verses direction, the polarity of the electromagnet reverses direction also, faithfully fol-
lowing the input signal. The voice coil and its moving magnet are firmly attached to the
cone. The cone is a flexible diaphragm that vibrates to produce sound.

Meter Movement
The d’Arsonval meter movement is the most common type used in analog multimeters. In
this type of meter movement, the pointer is deflected in proportion to the amount of current
through a coil. Figure 22 shows a basic d’Arsonval meter movement. It consists of a

coil of wire wound on a bearing-mounted assembly that is placed between the poles of a
permanent magnet. A pointer is attached to the moving assembly. With no current through
the coil, a spring mechanism keeps the pointer at its left-most (zero) position. When there
is current through the coil, electromagnetic forces act on the coil, causing a rotation to the
right. The amount of rotation depends on the amount of current.
Figure 23 illustrates how the interaction of magnetic fields produces rotation of the coil 
assembly. Current is inward at the “cross” and outward at the “dot” in the single winding
shown. The outward current produces a clockwise electromagnetic field that reinforces the per-
manent magnetic field above it. The result is a downward force on the right side of the coil as
shown. The inward current produces a counterclockwise electromagnetic field that reinforces
the permanent magnetic field below it. The result is an upward force on the left side of the coil
as shown. These forces produce a clockwise rotation of the coil assembly and are opposed by
a spring mechanism. The indicated forces and the spring force are balanced at the value of the
current. When current is removed, the spring force returns the pointer to its zero position.

Magnetic Disk and Tape Read/Write Head
A simplified diagram of a magnetic disk or tape surface read/write operation is shown in
Figure 24. A data bit (1 or 0) is written on the magnetic surface by the magnetization of 
a small segment of the surface as it moves by the write head. The direction of the magnetic
flux lines is controlled by the direction of the current pulse in the winding, as shown in
Figure 24(a). At the air gap in the write head, the magnetic flux takes a path through the
surface of the storage device. This magnetizes a small spot on the surface in the direction
of the field. A magnetized spot of one polarity represents a binary 1, and one of the oppo-
site polarity represents a binary 0. Once a spot on the surface is magnetized, it remains until
written over with an opposite magnetic field.

415

MAGNETISM AND ELECTROMAGNETISM
When the magnetic surface passes a read head, the magnetized spots produce magnetic
fields in the read head, which induce voltage pulses in the winding. The polarity of these
pulses depends on the direction of the magnetized spot and indicates whether the stored bit
is a 1 or a 0. This process is illustrated in Figure 24(b). Often the read and write heads 
are combined into a single unit.
The Magneto-Optical Disk
The magneto-optical disk uses an electromagnet and laser beams to read and write (record)
data on a magnetic surface. Magneto-optical disks are formatted in tracks and sectors sim-
ilar to magnetic floppy disks and hard disks. However, because of the ability of a laser
beam to be precisely directed to an extremely small spot, magneto-optical disks are capa-
ble of storing much more data than standard magnetic hard disks.
Figure 25(a) illustrates a small cross-sectional area of a disk before recording, with 
an electromagnet positioned below it. Tiny magnetic particles, represented by the arrows,
are all magnetized in the same direction.
Writing (recording) on the disk is accomplished by applying an external magnetic field
opposite to the direction of the magnetic particles, as indicated in Figure 25(b), and

then directing a high-power laser beam to heat the disk at a precise point where a binary 1
is to be stored. The disk material, a magneto-optic alloy, is highly resistant to magnetiza-
tion at room temperature; but at the spot where the laser beam heats the material, the in-
herent direction of magnetism is reversed by the external magnetic field produced by the
electromagnet. At points where binary 0s are to be stored, the laser beam is not applied and
the inherent upward direction of the magnetic particle remains.
As illustrated in Figure 25(c), reading data from the disk is accomplished by turning 
off the external magnetic field and directing a low-power laser beam at a spot where a bit
is to be read. Basically, if a binary 1 is stored at the spot (reversed magnetization), the laser
beam is reflected and its polarization is shifted; but if a binary 0 is stored, the polarization
of the reflected laser beam is unchanged. A detector senses the difference in the polarity of
the reflected laser beam to determine if the bit being read is a 1 or a 0.
Figure 25(d) shows that the disk is erased by restoring the original magnetic direction of 
each particle by reversing the external magnetic field and applying the high power laser beam.

Magnetic Field Intensity (H)
The magnetic field intensity (also called magnetizing force) in a material is defined to be
the magnetomotive force (
) per unit length (l) of the material, as expressed by the fol-
lowing equation. The unit of magnetic field intensity (H) is ampere-turns per meter (At/m).
where 
Note that the magnetic field intensity depends on the number of turns (N)
of the coil of wire, the current (I) through the coil, and the length (l) of the material. It does
not depend on the type of material.
Since 
as 
increases, the flux increases. Also, the magnetic field intensity
(H) increases. Recall that the flux density (B) is the flux per unit cross-sectional area
(
), so B is also proportional to H. The curve showing how these two quantities
(B and H) are related is called the B-H curve or the hysteresis curve. The parameters that
influence both B and H are illustrated in Figure 26.

MAGNETISM AND ELECTROMAGNETISM
The Hysteresis Curve and Retentivity
Hysteresis is a characteristic of a magnetic material whereby a change in magnetization
lags the application of the magnetic field intensity. The magnetic field intensity (H) can be
readily increased or decreased by varying the current through the coil of wire, and it can be
reversed by reversing the voltage polarity across the coil.
Figure 27 illustrates the development of the hysteresis curve. Let’s start by assum-
ing a magnetic core is unmagnetized so that

in Figure 27(a). When H reaches a certain value, B begins to level off. As H continues 
to increase, B reaches a saturation value (
) when H reaches a value (
), as illustrated
in Figure 27(b). Once saturation is reached, a further increase in H will not increase B.
Now, if H is decreased to zero, B will fall back along a different path to a residual value
(
), as shown in Figure 27(c). This indicates that the material continues to be magnet-
ized even when the magnetic field intensity is zero (
). The ability of a material to
maintain a magnetized state without magnetic field intensity is called retentivity. The re-
tentivity of a material represents the maximum flux that can be retained after the material
has been magnetized to saturation and is indicated by the ratio of 
to 
Reversal of the magnetic field intensity is represented by negative values of H on the
curve and is achieved by reversing the current in the coil of wire. An increase in H in the
negative direction causes saturation to occur at a value (
) where the flux density is at
its maximum negative value, as indicated in Figure 27(d).
When the magnetic field intensity is removed (
), the flux density goes to its neg-
ative residual value (
), as shown in Figure 27(e). From the 
value, the flux den-
sity follows the curve indicated in part (f) back to its maximum positive value when the
magnetic field intensity equals 
in the positive direction.
The complete 
curve is shown in Figure 27(g) and is called the hysteresis curve. The
magnetic field intensity required to make the flux density zero is called the coercive force,
Materials with a low retentivity do not retain a magnetic field very well, while those
with high retentivities exhibit values of 
very close to the saturation value of B. Depend-
ing on the application, retentivity in a magnetic material can be an advantage or a disad-
vantage. In permanent magnets and magnetic tape, for example, high retentivity is
required; while in tape recorder read/write heads, low retentivity is necessary. In ac motors,
retentivity is undesirable because the residual magnetic field must be overcome each time
the current reverses, thus wasting energy.

MAGNETISM AND ELECTROMAGNETISM
Relative Motion
When a straight conductor is moved perpendicular to a magnetic field, there is a relative
motion between the conductor and the magnetic field. Likewise, when a magnetic field is
moved past a stationary conductor, there is also relative motion. In either case, this relative
motion results in an induced voltage (vind) in the conductor, as Figure 28 indicates. 
This principle is known as electromagnetic induction. The lowercase v stands for in-
stantaneous voltage. Voltage is only induced when the conductor “cuts” magnetic lines as
shown. The amount of the induced voltage (
) depends on the flux density (B), the length
of the conductor (l) that is exposed to the magnetic field, and the rate at which the conduc-
tor and the magnetic field move with respect to each other. The faster the relative speed, the
greater the induced voltage. The equation for induced voltage in a straight conductor is
where 
is the induced voltage, 
is the flux density in teslas, l is the length of the conduc-
tor exposed to the magnetic field in meters, and v is the relative velocity in meters per second.
Polarity of the Induced Voltage
If the conductor in Figure 28 is moved first one way and then another in the magnetic 
field, a reversal of the polarity of the induced voltage will be observed. As the conductor is
moved downward, a voltage is induced with the polarity indicated in Figure 29(a). As 
the conductor is moved upward, the polarity is as indicated in part (b) of the figure.

Induced Current
When a load resistor is connected to the conductor in Figure 29, the voltage induced by 
the relative motion in the magnetic field will cause a current in the load, as shown in Figure

stantaneous current.

cause of the size of the pole faces. Therefore,

The action of producing a voltage and a resulting current in a load by moving a conductor
across a magnetic field is the basis for electrical generators. A single conductor will have a
small induced current, so practical generators use coils with many turns. The concept of a
conductor in a moving magnetic field is the basis for inductance in an electric circuit.
Faraday’s law
Michael Faraday discovered the principle of electromagnetic induction in 1831. The key
idea behind Faraday’s law is that a changing magnetic field can induce a voltage in a con-
ductor. Sometimes Faraday’s law is stated as Faraday’s law of induction. Faraday experi-
mented with coils, and his law is an extension of the principle of electromagnetic induction
for straight conductors discussed previously.
When a conductor is coiled into multiple turns, more conductors can be exposed to the
magnetic field, increasing the induced voltage. When the magnetic flux is caused to change
by any means, an induced voltage will result. The change in the magnetic field can be
caused by relative motion between the magnetic field and the coil. Faraday’s observations
can be stated as follows:
1. The amount of voltage induced in a coil is directly proportional to the rate of
change of the magnetic field with respect to the coil 
2. The amount of voltage induced in a coil is directly proportional to the number of
turns of wire in the coil (N).
Faraday’s first observation is demonstrated in Figure 31, where a bar magnet is 
moved through a coil, thus creating a changing magnetic field. In part (a) of the figure, the
magnet is moved at a certain rate, and a certain induced voltage is produced as indicated.
In part (b), the magnet is moved at a faster rate through the coil, creating a greater induced
voltage.
Faraday’s second observation is demonstrated in Figure 32. In part (a), the magnet 
is moved through the coil and a voltage is induced as shown. In part (b), the magnet is
moved at the same speed through a coil that has a greater number of turns. The greater
number of turns creates a greater induced voltage.

Faraday was an English physicist

remembered for his contribution
to the understanding of

that electricity could be produced
by moving a magnet inside a coil
of wire, and he was able to build
the first electric motor. He later
built the first electromagnetic
generator and transformer. The
statement of the principles of

known today as Faraday’s law. Also,
the unit of capacitance, the farad,

Any relative motion between the magnetic field and the coil will produce the changing
magnetic field that will induce a voltage in the coil. The changing magnetic field can even be
induced by ac applied to an electromagnet, just as if there were motion. This type of changing
magnetic field is the basis for transformer action in ac circuits.
Lenz’s Law
Faraday’s law states that a changing magnetic field induces a voltage in a coil that is di-
rectly proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic field and the number of turns in the
coil. Lenz’s law defines the polarity or direction of the induced voltage.
When the current through a coil changes, an induced voltage is created as a result
of the changing electromagnetic field and the polarity of the induced voltage is
such that it always opposes the change in current.
An Application of Electromagnetic Induction
In automobiles, it is necessary to know the position of the crankshaft to control ignition tim-
ing and sometimes to adjust the fuel mixture. As mentioned previously, a Hall-effect sensor
is one method to determine the position of the crankshaft (or camshaft). Another widely
used method is to detect a change in the magnetic field as a metallic tab moves though the
air gap in a magnetic assembly. A basic concept is shown in Figure 33. A steel disk with 
protruding tabs is connected to the end of the crankshaft. As the crankshaft turns, the tabs
move through the magnetic field. Steel has a much lower reluctance than does air, so the
magnetic flux increases when a tab is in the air gap. This change in the magnetic flux causes
an induced voltage to appear across the coil, indicating the position of the crankshaft.

Forces on a Current-Carrying Conductor in a Magnetic Field 
(Motor Action)
Figure 34(a) shows current inward through a wire in a magnetic field. The electro-
magnetic field set up by the current interacts with the permanent magnetic field; as a result,
the permanent lines of force above the wire tend to be deflected down under the wire be-
cause they are opposite in direction to the electromagnetic lines of force. Therefore, the
Lenz was born in Estonia (then
Russia) and became a professor at
the University of St. Petersburg. He
carried out many experiments
following Faraday’s lead and
formulated the principle of
electromagnetism, which defines
the polarity of induced voltage in a
coil. The statement of this
principle is named in his honor.

flux density above is reduced, and the magnetic field is weakened. The flux density below
the conductor is increased, and the magnetic field is strengthened. An upward force on the
conductor results, and the conductor tends to move toward the weaker magnetic field.

MAGNETISM AND ELECTROMAGNETISM
Figure 35 shows a simplified dc generator consisting of a single loop of wire in a 
permanent magnetic field. Notice that each end of the wire loop is connected to a split-ring
arrangement. This conductive metal ring is called a commutator. As the wire loop rotates in
the magnetic field, the split commutator ring also rotates. Each half of the split ring rubs
against the fixed contacts, called brushes, and connects the wire loop to an external circuit.
As the wire loop rotates through the magnetic field, it cuts through the flux lines at vary-
ing angles, as illustrated in Figure 36. At position A in its rotation, the loop of wire is ef-
fectively moving parallel with the magnetic field. Therefore, at this instant, the rate at which
it is cutting through the magnetic flux lines is zero. As the loop moves from position A to po-
sition B, it cuts through the flux lines at an increasing rate. At position B, it is moving effec-
tively perpendicular to the magnetic field and thus is cutting through a maximum number of
lines. As the loop rotates from position B to position C, the rate at which it cuts the flux lines
decreases to minimum (zero) at C. From position C to position D, the rate at which the loop
cuts the flux lines increases to a maximum at D and then back to a minimum again at A.

As you have learned, when a wire moves through a magnetic field, a voltage is induced,
and by Faraday’s law, the amount of induced voltage is proportional to the number of loops
(turns) in the wire and the rate at which it is moving with respect to the magnetic field. The
angle at which the wire moves with respect to the magnetic flux lines determines the
amount of induced voltage because the rate at which the wire cuts through the flux lines de-
pends on the angle of motion.
Figure 37 illustrates how a voltage is induced in the external circuit as the single loop 
rotates in the magnetic field. Assume that the loop is in its instantaneous horizontal position,
425

MAGNETISM AND ELECTROMAGNETISM
so the induced voltage is zero. As the loop continues in its rotation, the induced voltage
builds up to a maximum at position B, as shown in part (a) of the figure. Then, as the loop
continues from B to C, the voltage decreases to zero at position C, as shown in part (b).
During the second half of the revolution, shown in Figure 37(c) and (d), the brushes
switch to opposite commutator sections, so the polarity of the voltage remains the same
across the output. Thus, as the loop rotates from position C to position D and then back to
position A, the voltage increases from zero at C to a maximum at D and back to zero at A.
Figure 38 shows how the induced voltage varies as the wire loop in the dc generator
goes through several rotations (three in this case). This voltage is a dc voltage because its
polarities do not change. However, the voltage is pulsating between zero and its maximum
value.
In practical generators, multiple coils are pressed into slots in a ferromagnetic-core as-
sembly. The entire assembly, called the rotor, is connected to bearings and rotates in the
magnetic field. Figure 39 is a diagram of the rotor core with no wire loops (coils)

shown. The commutator is divided into segments, with each pair of segments connected
to the end of a coil. With more coils, the voltages from several coils are combined because
the brushes can contact more than one of the commutator segments at once. The loops do
not reach maximum voltage at the same time, so the pulsating output voltage is much
smoother than is the case with only one coil or loop shown previously. The variations can
be further smoothed by filters to produce a nearly constant dc output.
Instead of permanent magnets, most generators use electromagnets to provide the re-
quired magnetic field. One advantage to this is that flux density can be controlled, thus con-
trolling the output voltage of the generator. The windings for the electromagnets, called
field windings, require current to produce the magnetic field.
The current for the field windings can be provided from a separate voltage source, but
this is a disadvantage. A better method is to use the generator itself to provide the current
for the electromagnets; this is called a self-excited generator. The generator starts because
there is normally enough residual magnetism in the field magnets due to hysteresis that
causes a small initial field and allows the generator to start producing a voltage. In cases
where a generator has not been used for a long time, it may be necessary to provide an ex-
ternal source to the field windings to start it.
The stationary part of a generator (or motor) includes all of the nonmoving parts and is
called the stator. Figure 40 illustrates a simplified two-pole dc generator showing the 
magnetic paths (end caps, bearings, and commutator are not shown). Notice that the frame
is part of the magnetic path for the field magnets. To make a generator have high efficiency,
the air gap is kept as small as possible. The armature is the power-producing component
and can be either on the rotor or the stator. In the dc generator described previously, the
armature is the rotor because power is produced in the moving conductors and taken from
the rotor via the commutator.

Equivalent Circuit for a DC Generator
A self-excited generator can be represented by a basic dc circuit with a coil to produce the
magnetic field and a mechanically driven generator, as shown in Figure 41. There are 
other configurations of dc generators, but this represents a common one. In the case shown,
the field windings are in parallel with the source; this configuration is called a shunt-wound
generator. The resistance of the field windings is shown as 
. For the equivalent circuit,
this resistance is shown in series with the field windings. The armature is driven by a me-
chanical input, causing it to spin; it looks like a voltage source of

ance is shown as the series resistance,

When a load is connected to the output, current in the armature is shared between the

MAGNETISM AND ELECTROMAGNETISM
Basic Operation
As in the case of generators, motor action is the result of the interaction of magnetic
fields. In a dc motor, the rotor field interacts with the magnetic field set up by current in
the stator windings. The rotor in all dc motors contains the armature winding, which
sets up a magnetic field. The rotor moves because of the attractive force between oppo-
site poles and the repulsive force between like poles, as illustrated in the simplified
diagram of Figure 42. The rotor moves because of the attraction of its north pole 
with the south pole of the stator (and vice-versa). As the two poles near each other, the
polarity of the rotor current is suddenly switched by the commutator, reversing the mag-
netic poles of the rotor. The commutator serves as a mechanical switch to reverse the
current in the armature just as the unlike poles are near each other, continuing the rota-
tion of the rotor.

THE DC MOTOR
Motors convert electrical energy to mechanical motion by taking advantage of the
force produced when a current-carrying conductor is in a magnetic field. A dc motor
operates from a dc source and can use either an electromagnet or a permanent magnet
to supply the field.

MAGNETISM AND ELECTROMAGNETISM
Brushless DC Motors
Many dc motors do not use a commutator to reverse the polarity of the current. Instead of
supplying current to a moving armature, the magnetic field is rotated in the stator windings
using an electronic controller. The direction of current in the field coils is periodically re-
versed by the controller by producing an ac waveform (or modified ac waveform) from the
dc input. This causes the stator field to rotate, and the permanent magnet rotor moves in the
same direction to keep up with the rotating field. A common way to sense the position of the
rotating magnet is to use a Hall-effect sensor, which provides the controller with position in-
formation. Brushless motors have higher reliability than traditional brushed motors because
they do not need to have periodic brush replacement, but have the added complexity of the
electronic controller. Figure 43 shows a cutaway view of a brushless dc motor.

motor. (Courtesy of Bodine Electric

Back EMF
When a dc motor is first started, a magnetic field is present from the field windings. Armature
current develops another magnetic field that interacts with the one from the field windings and
starts the motor turning. The armature windings are now spinning in the presence of the mag-
netic field, so generator action occurs. In effect, the spinning armature has a voltage developed
across it that opposes the original applied voltage in accordance with Lenz’s law. This self-gen-
erated voltage is called back emf (electromotive force). The term emf was once common for
voltage but is not favored because voltage is not a “force” in the physics sense, but back emf is
still applied to the self-generated voltage in motors. Back emf, also called counter emf, serves
to significantly reduce the armature current when the motor is turning at constant speed.
Motor Ratings
Some motors are rated by the torque they can provide, others are rated by the power they pro-
duce. Torque and power are important parameters for any motor. Although torque and power
are different physical parameters, if one is known, the other can be obtained.
Torque tends to rotate an object. In a dc motor, the torque is proportional to the amount of
flux and to the armature current. Torque, T, in a dc motor can be calculated from the equation
Equation 10
where T is torque in newton-meters (N-m), K is a constant that depends on physical parameters
of the motor, 
is magnetic flux in webers (Wb), and 
is armature current in amperes (A).

MAGNETISM AND ELECTROMAGNETISM
Recall that power is defined as the rate of doing work. To calculate power from torque,
you must know the speed of the motor in rpm for the torque that you measured. The equa-
tion to determine the power, given the torque at a certain speed, is
Equation 11
where P is power in W, T is torque in N-m, and s is speed of motor in rpm.
P = 0.105Ts
What is the power developed by a motor that turns at 350 rpm when the torque is 
3.6 N-m?
Solution
Substitute into Equation 11.
Related Problem
Determine the power produced by a motor if 
and s = 1000 rpm.
T = 5 N-m
P = 0.105Ts = 0.105(3.6 N-m)(350 rpm) = 132 W
EXAMPLE 10
The Series DC Motor
The series dc motor has the field coil windings and the armature coil windings in series. A
schematic of this arrangement is shown in Figure 44(a). The internal resistance is gen-
erally small and consists of field coil resistance, armature winding resistance, and brush re-
sistance. As in the case of generators, dc motors may also contain an interpole winding, as
shown, and current limiting for speed control. In a series dc motor, the armature current,
field current, and line current are all the same.
T E C H  N O T E
One characteristic of dc motors is
that if they are allowed to run
without a load, the torque can
cause the motor to “run away” to a
speed beyond the manufacturer’s
rating. Therefore, dc motors
should always be operated with a
load to prevent self-destruction.

 FIGURE 44
Simplified schematic and torque-speed characteristic for a series dc motor.
As you know, magnetic flux is proportional to the current in a coil. The magnetic flux
created by the field windings is proportional to armature current because of the series con-
nection. Thus, when the motor is loaded, armature current rises, and the magnetic flux rises
too. Recall that Equation 10 showed that the torque in a dc motor is proportional to both 
the armature current and the magnetic flux. Thus, the series-wound motor will have a very
high starting torque when the current is high because flux and armature current are high.
For this reason, series dc motors are used when high starting torques are required (such as
a starter motor in a car).
The plot of the torque and motor speed for a series dc motor is shown in Figure 
44(b). The starting torque is at its maximum value. At low speeds, the torque is still 
very high, but drops off dramatically as the speed increases. As you can see, the speed can
be very high if the torque is low; for this reason, the series-wound dc motor always is op-
erated with a load.
431

MAGNETISM AND ELECTROMAGNETISM
The Shunt DC Motor
A shunt dc motor has the field coil in parallel with the armature, as shown in the equiva-
lent circuit in Figure 45(a). In the shunt motor, the field coil is supplied by a constant 
voltage source, so the magnetic field set up by the field coils is constant. The armature re-
sistance and the back emf produced by generator action in the armature determine the ar-
mature current.
The torque-speed characteristic for a shunt dc motor is quite different than for a series
dc motor. When a load is applied, the shunt motor will slow down, causing the back emf to
be reduced and the armature current to increase. The increase in armature current tends to
compensate for the added load by increasing the torque of the motor. Although the motor
has slowed because of the additional load, the torque-speed characteristic is nearly a
straight line for the shunt dc motor as shown in Figure 45(b). At full load, the shunt dc 
motor still has high torque.

Application Activity
The relay is a common type of elec-
tromagnetic device that is used in
many types of control applications.
With a relay, a lower voltage, such as
from a battery, can be used to switch a much higher voltage,
such as the 120 V from an ac outlet. You will see how a relay
can be used in a basic security alarm system.
The schematic in Figure 46 shows a simplified in-
trusion alarm system that uses a relay to turn on an audible
alarm (siren) and lights. The system operates from a 9 V battery
so that even if power to the house is off, the audible alarm will
still work.
The detection switches are normally open (NO) magnetic
switches that are parallel connected and located in the windows
and doors. The relay is a triple-pole–double-throw device that
operates with a coil voltage of 9 V dc and draws approximately
50 mA. When an intrusion occurs, one of the switches closes
and allows current from the battery to the relay coil, which
energizes the relay and causes the three sets of normally open
contacts to close. Closure of contact A turns on the alarm, which
432

MAGNETISM AND ELECTROMAGNETISM
draws 2 A from the battery. Closure of contact C turns on a light
circuit in the house. Closure of contact B latches the relay and
keeps it energized even if the intruder closes the door or window
through which entry was made. If not for contact B in parallel
with the detection switches, the alarm and lights would go off as
soon as the window or door was shut behind the intruder.
The relay contacts are not physically remote in relation to
the coil as the schematic indicates. The schematic is drawn this
way for functional clarity. The entire relay is housed in the

INTRODUCTION
This chapter provides an introduction to ac circuit analysis in
which time-varying electrical signals, particularly the sine
wave, are studied. An electrical signal is a voltage or current
that changes in some consistent manner with time. In other
words, the voltage or current fluctuates according to a cer-
tain pattern called a waveform.
An alternating voltage is one that changes polarity at a
certain rate, and an alternating current is one that changes
direction at a certain rate. The sinusoidal waveform (sine
wave) is the most common and fundamental type because
all other types of repetitive waveforms can be broken down
into composite sine waves. The sine wave is a periodic type
of waveform that repeats at fixed intervals. The use of pha-
sors to represent sine waves is discussed.
Special emphasis is given to the sinusoidal waveform
(sine wave) because of its fundamental importance in ac cir-
cuit analysis. Alternators, which generate sine waves, and ac
motors are introduced. Other types of waveforms are also 
introduced, including pulse, triangular, and sawtooth. 
The use of the oscilloscope for displaying and measuring
waveforms is introduced.

INTRODUCTION TO ALTERNATING CURRENT AND VOLTAGE
Sinusoidal voltages are produced by two types of sources: rotating electrical machines
(ac generators) or electronic oscillator circuits, which are used in instruments commonly
known as electronic signal generators. Figure 1 shows the symbol used to represent 
either source of sinusoidal voltage. AC generators are covered in Section 7, and 
electronic signal generators are discussed at the end of this section.
Figure 2 is a graph showing the general shape of a sine wave, which can be either 
an alternating current or an alternating voltage. Voltage (or current) is displayed on the ver-
tical axis and time (t) is displayed on the horizontal axis. Notice how the voltage (or cur-
rent) varies with time. Starting at zero, the voltage (or current) increases to a positive
maximum (peak), returns to zero, and then increases to a negative maximum (peak) before
returning again to zero, thus completing one full cycle.

THE SINUSOIDAL WAVEFORM
The sinusoidal waveform or sine wave is the fundamental type of alternating current
(ac) and alternating voltage. It is also referred to as a sinusoidal wave or, simply, sinu-
soid. The electrical service provided by the power company is in the form of sinusoidal
voltage and current. In addition, other types of repetitive waveforms are composites 
of many individual sine waves called harmonics.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Identify a sinusoidal waveform and measure its characteristics
◆Determine the period
◆Determine the frequency
◆Relate the period and the frequency
◆Describe two types of electronic signal generators.

Polarity of a Sine Wave
As mentioned, a sine wave changes polarity at its zero value; that is, it alternates between
positive and negative values. When a sinusoidal voltage source 
is applied to a resistive
circuit, as in Figure 3, an alternating sinusoidal current results. When the voltage 
changes polarity, the current correspondingly changes direction as indicated.
During the positive alternation of the applied voltage 
the current is in the direction
shown in Figure 3(a). During a negative alternation of the applied voltage, the current

is in the opposite direction, as shown in Figure 3(b). The combined positive and nega-
tive alternations make up one cycle of a sine wave.
Period of a Sine Wave
A sine wave varies with time (t) in a definable manner.
The time required for a sine wave to complete one full cycle is called the period (T).
Figure 4(a) illustrates the period of a sine wave. Typically, a sine wave continues to re-
peat itself in identical cycles, as shown in Figure 4(b). Since all cycles of a repetitive 
sine wave are the same, the period is always a fixed value for a given sine wave. The period
of a sine wave can be measured from a zero crossing to the next corresponding zero cross-
ing, as indicated in Figure 4(a). The period can also be measured from any peak in a 
given cycle to the corresponding peak in the next cycle.

Method 1: The period can be measured from one zero crossing to the corresponding

positive peak in the next cycle.
Method 3: The period can be measured from the negative peak in one cycle to the
negative peak in the next cycle.
These measurements are indicated in Figure 7, where two cycles of the sine 
wave are shown. Keep in mind that you obtain the same value for the period no matter
which corresponding points on the waveform you use.

INTRODUCTION TO ALTERNATING CURRENT AND VOLTAGE
Frequency of a Sine Wave
Frequency (f ) is the number of cycles that a sine wave completes in one second.
The more cycles completed in one second, the higher the frequency. Frequency (f ) is measured
in units of hertz. One hertz (Hz) is equivalent to one cycle per second; 60 Hz is 60 cycles per
second, for example. Figure 8 shows two sine waves. The sine wave in part (a) completes
two full cycles in one second. The one in part (b) completes four cycles in one second.
Therefore, the sine wave in part (b) has twice the frequency of the one in part (a).

There is a reciprocal relationship between f and T. Knowing one, you can calculate the
other with the x1 or 1/x key on your calculator. This inverse relationship makes sense be-

with a shorter period.

Electronic Signal Generators
The signal generator is an instrument that electronically produces sine waves for use in
testing or controlling electronic circuits and systems. There are a variety of signal genera-
tors, ranging from special-purpose instruments that produce only one type of waveform in
a limited frequency range, to programmable instruments that produce a wide range of fre-
quencies and a variety of waveforms. All signal generators consist basically of an
oscillator, which is an electronic circuit that produces repetitive waves. All generators
have controls for adjusting the amplitude and frequency.
Function Generators and Arbitrary Waveform Generators
A function generator is
an instrument that produces more than one type of waveform. It provides pulse waveforms
as well as sine waves and triangular waves. Typical function generators are shown in
Figure 10(a).

An arbitrary waveform generator can be used to generate standard signals like sine
waves, triangular waves, and pulses as well as signals with various shapes and characteris-
tics. Waveforms can be defined by mathematical or graphical input. A typical arbitrary

SINUSOIDAL VOLTAGE AND CURRENT VALUES
Five ways to express the value of a sine wave in terms of its voltage or its current 
magnitude are instantaneous, peak, peak-to-peak, rms, and average values.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Determine the various voltage and current values of a sine wave
◆Find the instantaneous value at any point
◆Find the peak value
◆Find the peak-to-peak value
◆Define rms
◆Explain why the average value is always zero over a complete cycle
◆Find the half-cycle average value
Instantaneous Value
Figure 11 illustrates that at any point in time on a sine wave, the voltage (or current) has 
an instantaneous value. This instantaneous value is different at different points along the
450

INTRODUCTION TO ALTERNATING CURRENT AND VOLTAGE
curve. Instantaneous values are positive during the positive alternation and negative during
the negative alternation. Instantaneous values of voltage and current are symbolized by
lowercase v and i, respectively. The curve in part (a) shows voltage only, but it applies
equally for current when the v’s are replaced with i’s. An example of instantaneous values
is shown in part (b) where the instantaneous voltage is 3.1 V at 
7.07 V at 
10 V

0 V at

and so on.
Peak Value
The peak value of a sine wave is the value of voltage (or current) at the positive or the neg-
ative maximum (peak) with respect to zero. Since the positive and negative peak values are
equal in magnitude, a sine wave is characterized by a single peak value. This is illustrated
in Figure 12. For a given sine wave, the peak value is constant and is represented by 
or 
The peak value is also called the amplitude.

RMS Value
The term rms stands for root mean square. Most ac voltmeters display rms voltage. The
120 V at your wall outlet is an rms value. The rms value, also referred to as the effective
value, of a sinusoidal voltage is actually a measure of the heating effect of the sine wave.
For example, when a resistor is connected across an ac (sinusoidal) voltage source, as
shown in Figure 14(a), a certain amount of heat is generated by the power in the resis-
tor. Figure 14(b) shows the same resistor connected across a dc voltage source. The 
value of the dc voltage can be adjusted so that the resistor gives off the same amount of heat
as it does when connected to the ac source.
The rms value of a sinusoidal voltage is equal to the dc voltage that produces the
same amount of heat in a resistance as does the sinusoidal voltage.
Ipp = 2Ip
 FIGURE 14
When the same amount of heat is produced in both setups, the sinusoidal voltage has an rms value

The peak value of a sine wave can be converted to the corresponding rms value using the
following relationships for either voltage or current:

Vrms = 0.707Vp
Equation 6
Using these formulas, you can also determine the peak value if you know the rms value.
 Vp = Vrms

Irms = 0.707Ip

Similarly,
 Vp = 1.414Vrms

To get the peak-to-peak value, simply double the peak value.

INTRODUCTION TO ALTERNATING CURRENT AND VOLTAGE
Average Value
The average value of a sine wave taken over one complete cycle is always zero because
the positive values (above the zero crossing) offset the negative values (below the zero
crossing).
To be useful for certain purposes such as measuring types of voltages found in power
supplies, the average value of a sine wave is defined over a half-cycle rather than over a full
cycle. The average value is the total area under the half-cycle curve divided by the dis-
tance in radians of the curve along the horizontal axis. The result is derived in Appendix B
and is expressed in terms of the peak value as follows for both voltage and current sine
waves:

INTRODUCTION TO ALTERNATING CURRENT AND VOLTAGE
A sinusoidal voltage can be produced by an alternator, which is an ac generator. There
is a direct relationship between the rotation of the rotor in an alternator and the sine wave
output. Thus, the angular measurement of the rotor’s position is directly related to the 
angle assigned to the sine wave.
Angular Measurement
A degree is an angular measurement corresponding to 1/360 of a circle or a complete rev-
olution. A radian is the angular measurement along the circumference of a circle that is
equal to the radius of the circle. One radian (rad) is equivalent to 
as illustrated in
Figure 16. In a 
revolution, there are 
radians.
The Greek letter 
(pi) represents the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its
diameter and has a constant value of approximately 3.1416.
Scientific calculators have a 
function so that the actual numerical value does not have
to be entered.
Table 1 lists several values of degrees and the corresponding radian values. These 
angular measurements are illustrated in Figure 17.

ANGULAR MEASUREMENT OF A SINE WAVE
As you have seen, sine waves can be measured along the horizontal axis on a time 
basis; however, since the time for completion of one full cycle or any portion of a 
cycle is frequency-dependent, it is often useful to specify points on the sine wave in
terms of an angular measurement expressed in degrees or radians.
After completing this section, you should be able to

Phase of a Sine Wave
The phase of a sine wave is an angular measurement that specifies the position of that sine
wave relative to a reference. Figure 19 shows one cycle of a sine wave to be used as the 
reference. Note that the first positive-going crossing of the horizontal axis (zero crossing)
is at 
(0 rad), and the positive peak is at 
rad). The negative-going zero crossing
is at 
rad), and the negative peak is at 
rad). The cycle is completed at
rad). When the sine wave is shifted left or right with respect to this reference,
there is a phase shift.

INTRODUCTION TO ALTERNATING CURRENT AND VOLTAGE
As a practical matter, when you measure the phase shift between two waveforms on an os-
cilloscope, you should make them appear to have the same amplitude. This is done by taking
one of the oscilloscope channels out of vertical calibration and adjusting the corresponding
waveform until its apparent amplitude equals that of the other waveform. This procedure
eliminates the error caused if both waveforms are not measured at their exact center.
Polyphase Power
One important application of phase-shifted sine waves is in electrical power systems. Elec-
trical utilities generate ac with three phases that are separated by 
as shown in Figure
22. The reference is called neutral. Normally, three-phase power is delivered to the user
with four lines (three hot lines and neutral). There are important advantages to three-phase
power for ac motors. Three-phase motors are more efficient and simpler than an equivalent
single-phase motor. Motors are discussed further in Section 8.

You may already be familiar with vectors. In math and science, a vector is any quantity
with both magnitude and direction. Examples of vectors are force, velocity, and acceleration.

In electronics, a phasor is a type of vector but the term generally refers to quantities that
vary with time, such as sine waves. Examples of phasors are shown in Figure 28. The
length of the phasor “arrow” represents the magnitude of a quantity. The angle, (relative

Phasor Representation of a Sine Wave
A full cycle of a sine wave can be represented by rotation of a phasor through 360 degrees.
The instantaneous value of the sine wave at any point is equal to the vertical 
distance from the tip of the phasor to the horizontal axis.
Figure 29 shows how the phasor traces out the sine wave as it goes from

You
can relate this concept to the rotation in an ac generator. Notice that the length of the pha-
sor is equal to the peak value of the sine wave (observe the

points). The

phasor. As previously mentioned, the vertical distance from the phasor tip down to the hor-
izontal axis represents the instantaneous value of the sine wave at that point.
Notice that when a vertical line is drawn from the phasor tip down to the horizontal
axis, a right triangle is formed, as shown shaded in Figure 30. The length of the pha-
sor is the hypotenuse of the triangle, and the vertical projection is the opposite side. From
trigonometry,
The opposite side of a right triangle is equal to the hypotenuse times the sine of the
angle 
The length of the phasor is the peak value of the sinusoidal voltage, 
Thus, the opposite
side of the triangle, which is the instantaneous value, can be expressed as
Recall that this formula is the one stated earlier for calculating instantaneous sinusoidal
voltage. A similar formula applies to a sinusoidal current.
Positive and Negative Phasor Angles
The position of a phasor at any instant can be expressed as a positive angle, as you have
seen, or as an equivalent negative angle. Positive angles are measured counterclockwise
from 
Negative angles are measured clockwise from 
For a given positive angle 
the corresponding negative angle is

INTRODUCTION TO ALTERNATING CURRENT AND VOLTAGE
Angular Velocity of a Phasor
As you have seen, one cycle of a sine wave is traced out when a phasor is rotated through
360 degrees or 
radians. The faster it is rotated, the faster the sine wave cycle is traced
out. Thus, the period and frequency are related to the velocity of rotation of the phasor. The
velocity of rotation is called the angular velocity and is designated 
(the small Greek
letter omega).
When a phasor rotates through 
radians, one complete cycle is traced out. Therefore,
the time required for the phasor to go through 
radians is the period of the sine wave.
Because the phasor rotates through 
radians in a time equal to the period, T, the angular
velocity can be expressed as

If a sinusoidal voltage is applied across a resistor as shown in Figure 37, there is a 
sinusoidal current. The current is zero when the voltage is zero and is maximum when the
voltage is maximum. When the voltage changes polarity, the current reverses direction. As
a result, the voltage and current are said to be in phase with each other.

INTRODUCTION TO ALTERNATING CURRENT AND VOLTAGE
When you use Ohm’s law in ac circuits, remember that both the voltage and the current
must be expressed consistently, that is, both as peak values, both as rms values, both as
average values, and so on. Kirchhoff’s voltage and current laws apply to ac circuits as well
as to dc circuits. Figure 38 illustrates Kirchhoff’s voltage law in a resistive circuit that 
has a sinusoidal voltage source. The source voltage is the sum of all the voltage drops
across the resistors, just as in a dc circuit.

Power in resistive ac circuits is determined the same as for dc circuits except that you
must use rms values of current and voltage. Recall that the rms value of a sine wave volt-
age is equivalent to a dc voltage of the same value in terms of its heating effect. The gen-

Superimposed DC and AC Voltages
In many practical circuits, you will find both dc and ac voltages combined. An 
example of this is in amplifier circuits where ac signal voltages are superimposed 
on dc operating voltages. This is a common application of the superposition theorem.

Figure 41 shows a dc source and an ac source in series. These two voltages will add al-
gebraically to produce an ac voltage “riding” on a dc level, as measured across the resistor.
If 
is greater than the peak value of the sinusoidal voltage, the combined voltage is a
sine wave that never reverses polarity and is therefore nonalternating. That is, the sine wave
is riding on a dc level, as shown in Figure 42(a). If 
is less than the peak value of the 
sine wave, the sine wave will be negative during a portion of its lower half-cycle, as illustrated
in Figure 42(b), and is therefore alternating. In either case, the sine wave will reach a max-
imum voltage equal to

INTRODUCTION TO ALTERNATING CURRENT AND VOLTAGE
Simplified Alternator
Both the dc generator and the alternator, which generates ac voltage, are based on the prin-
ciple of electromagnetic induction that produces a voltage when there is relative motion be-
tween a magnetic field and a conductor. For a simplified alternator, a single rotating loop
passes permanent magnetic poles. The natural voltage that is generated by a rotating loop
is ac. In an alternator, instead of the split rings used in a dc generator, solid rings called slip
rings are used to connect to the rotor, and the output is ac. The simplest form of an alterna-
tor has the same appearance as a dc generator except for the slip rings, as shown in Figure
45.
7  
THE ALTERNATOR (AC GENERATOR)
An alternator is an ac generator that converts energy of motion into electrical energy.
Although it is similar to a dc generator, the alternator is more efficient than the dc
generator. Alternators are widely used in vehicles, boats, and other applications even
when dc is the final output.

Frequency
In the simplified alternator in Figure 45, each revolution of the loop produces one cy-
cle of a sine wave. The positive and negative peaks occur when the loop cuts the maximum
number of flux lines. The rate the loop spins determines the time for one complete cycle
and the frequency. If it takes 1/60 of a second to make a revolution, the period of the sine
wave is 1/60 of a second and the frequency is 60 Hz. Thus, the faster the loop rotates, the
higher the frequency.
Another way of achieving a higher frequency is to use more magnetic poles. When four
poles are used instead of two, as shown in Figure 46, the conductor passes under a north
and a south pole during one-half a revolution, which doubles the frequency. Alternators can

EXAMPLE 16
Practical Alternators
The single loop used in our simplified alternator produces only a tiny voltage. In a practi-
cal alternator, hundreds of loops are wound on a magnetic core, which forms the rotor.
Practical alternators usually have fixed windings surrounding the rotor instead of perma-
nent magnets. Depending on the type of alternator, these fixed windings can either provide
the magnetic field (in which case they are called field windings) or act as the fixed con-
ductors that produce the output (in which case they are the armature windings).
Rotating-Armature Alternators
In a rotating-armature alternator, the magnetic field is
stationary and is supplied by permanent magnets or electromagnets operated from dc. With
electromagnets, field windings are used instead of permanent magnets and provide a fixed
magnetic field that interacts with the rotor coils. Power is generated in the rotating assem-
bly and supplied to the load through the slip rings.
In a rotating-armature alternator, the rotor is the component from which power is taken.
In addition to hundreds of windings, the practical rotating-armature alternator usually has
many pole pairs in the stator that alternate as north and south poles, which serve to increase
the output frequency.
Rotating-Field Alternator
The rotating-armature alternator is generally limited to low-
power applications because all output current must pass through the slip rings and brushes.
To avoid this problem, rotating-field alternators take the output from the stator coils and use
472

INTRODUCTION TO ALTERNATING CURRENT AND VOLTAGE
a rotating magnet, hence the name. Small alternators may have a permanent magnet for a
rotor, but most use an electromagnet formed by a wound rotor. A relatively small amount
of dc is supplied to the rotor (through the slip rings) to power the electromagnet. As the ro-
tating magnetic field sweeps by the stator windings, power is generated in the stator. The
stator is therefore the armature in this case.
Figure 47 shows how a rotating-field alternator can generate three-phase sine waves.
(For simplicity, a permanent magnet is shown for the rotor.) AC is generated in each wind-
ing as the north pole and the south pole of the rotor alternately sweep by a stator winding.
If the north pole generates the positive portion of the sine wave, the south pole will gener-
ate the negative portion; thus, one rotation produces a complete sine wave. Each winding
has a sine wave output; but because the windings are separated by 120°, the three sine waves
are also shifted by 120°. This produces the three-phase output as shown. Most alternators
generate three-phase voltage because it is more efficient to produce and is widely used in
industry. If the final output is dc, three-phase is easier to convert to dc.

Rotor Current
A wound rotor offers important control advantages to alternators. A wound rotor enables
control over the strength of the magnetic field by controlling the rotor current and hence the
output voltage. For wound rotors, dc must be supplied to the rotor. This current is usually
supplied through brushes and slip rings, which are made of a continuous ring of material,
(unlike a commutator, which is segmented). Because the brushes need to pass only the
magnetizing rotor current, they last longer and are smaller than the brushes in an equivalent
dc generator, which pass all of the output current.
In wound-rotor alternators, the only current through the brushes and slip rings is the dc
that is used to maintain its magnetic field. The dc is usually derived from a small portion of
the output current, which is taken from the stator and converted to dc. Large alternators,
such as in power stations, may have a separate dc generator, called an exciter, to supply
current to the field coils. An exciter can respond very fast to changes in output voltage to
keep the alternator’s output constant, an important consideration in high-power alternators.
Some exciters are set up using a stationary field with the armature on the rotating main
shaft. The result is a brushless system because the exciter output is on the rotating shaft. A
brushless system eliminates the primary maintenance issue with large alternators in clean-
ing, repairing, and replacing brushes.
473

INTRODUCTION TO ALTERNATING CURRENT AND VOLTAGE
An Application
Alternators are used in nearly all modern automobiles, trucks, tractors, and other vehicles.
In vehicles, the output is usually three-phase ac taken from stator windings and then con-
verted to dc with diodes that are housed inside the alternator case. (Diodes are solid-state
devices that allow current in only one direction.) Current to the rotor is controlled by a volt-
age regulator, which is also internal to the alternator. The voltage regulator keeps the out-
put voltage relatively constant for engine speed changes or changing loads. Alternators
have replaced dc generators in automobiles and most other applications because they are
more efficient and more reliable.
Important parts of a small alternator, such as you might find in an automobile are shown
in Figure 48. Like the self-excited generator, the rotor has a small residual magnetism to
begin with, so an ac voltage is generated in the stators as soon as the rotor starts spinning.
This ac is converted to dc by a set of diodes. A portion of the dc is used to provide current
to the rotor; the rest is available for the loads. The amount of current required by the rotor
is much less than the total current from the alternator, so it can easily provide the required
current to the load.

In addition to the fact that three-phase voltage is more efficient to produce, it can pro-
duce a stable dc output easily by using two diodes in each winding. Since vehicles require
dc for the charging system and loads, the output of the alternator is converted to dc inter-
nally using a diode array mounted on a diode plate. Thus, a standard three-phase automo-
tive alternator will normally have six diodes inside to convert the output to dc. (Some
alternators have six independent stator coils and twelve diodes.)

INTRODUCTION TO ALTERNATING CURRENT AND VOLTAGE
AC Motor Classification
The two major classifications of ac motors are induction motors and synchronous
motors. Several considerations determine which of these types are best for any given
application. These considerations include the speed and power requirements, voltage
rating, load characteristics (such as starting torque required), efficiency requirements,
maintenance requirements, and operating environment (such as underwater operation or
temperature).
An induction motor is so named because a magnetic field induces current in the ro-
tor, creating a magnetic field that interacts with the stator field. Normally, there is no
electrical connection to the rotor, so there is no need for slip rings or brushes, which tend
to wear out. The rotor current is caused by electromagnetic induction, which also occurs
in transformers, so induction motors are said to work by transformer action.
In a synchronous motor, the rotor moves in sync (at the same rate) as the rotating field
of the stator. Synchronous motors are used in applications where maintaining constant
speed is important. Synchronous motors are not self-starting and must receive starting
torque from an external source or from built-in starting windings. Like alternators, syn-
chronous motors use slip rings and brushes to provide current to the rotor.
Rotating Stator Field
Both synchronous and induction ac motors have a similar arrangement for the stator wind-
ings, which allow the magnetic field of the stator to rotate. The rotating stator field is equiv-
alent to moving a magnet in a circle except that the rotating field is produced electrically,
with no moving parts.
How can the magnetic field in the stator rotate if the stator itself does not move? The
rotating field is created by the changing ac itself. Let’s look at a rotating field with a three-
phase stator, as shown in Figure 49. Notice that one of the three phases “dominates” at 
different times. When phase 1 is at 90°, the current in the phase 1 winding is at a maximum
and current in the other windings is smaller. Therefore, the stator magnetic field will be ori-
ented toward the phase-1 stator winding. As the phase-1 current declines, the phase-2 current
increases, and the field rotates toward the phase-2 winding. The magnetic field will be ori-
ented toward the phase-2 winding when current in it is a maximum. As the phase-2 current
declines, the phase-3 current increases, and the field rotates toward the phase-3 winding. The
process repeats as the field returns to the phase-1 winding. Thus, the field rotates at a rate
8  
THE AC MOTOR
Motors are electromagnetic devices that represent the most common loads for ac in
power applications. AC motors are used to operate household appliances such as heat
pumps, refrigerators, washers, dryers, and vacuums. In industry, ac motors are used in
many applications to move and process materials as well as refrigeration and heating
units, machining operations, pumps, and much more. In this section, the two major
types of ac motors, induction motors and synchronous motors, are introduced.
After completing this section, you should be able to

◆Explain how an induction motor develops torque
475

INTRODUCTION TO ALTERNATING CURRENT AND VOLTAGE
determined by the frequency of the applied voltage. With a more detailed analysis, it can be
shown that the magnitude of the field is unchanged; only the direction of the field changes.
As the stator field moves, the rotor moves in sync with it in a synchronous motor but
lags behind in an induction motor. The rate the stator field moves is called the synchronous
speed of the motor.
Induction Motors
The theory of operation is essentially the same for both single-phase and three-phase induction
motors. Both types use the rotating field described previously, but the single-phase motor re-
quires starting windings or other method to produce torque for starting the motor, whereas the
three-phase motor is self-starting. When starting windings are employed in a single-phase motor,
they are removed from the circuit by a mechanical centrifugal switch as the motor speeds up.
The core of the induction motor’s rotor consists of an aluminum frame that forms the
conductors for the circulating current in the rotor. (Some larger induction motors use cop-
per bars.) The aluminum frame is similar in appearance to the exercise wheel for pet squir-
rels (common in the early 20th century), so it is aptly called a squirrel cage, illustrated in
Figure 50. The aluminum squirrel cage itself is the electrical path; it is embedded 
within a ferromagnetic material to provide a low reluctance magnetic path through the ro-
tor. In addition, the rotor has cooling fins that may be molded into the same piece of alu-
minum as the squirrel cage. The entire assembly must be balanced so that it spins easily and
without vibrating.
Operation of an Induction Motor
When the magnetic field from the stator moves
across the squirrel cage of the inductor, a current is generated in the squirrel cage. This
current creates a magnetic field that reacts with the moving field of the stator, causing the

INTRODUCTION TO ALTERNATING CURRENT AND VOLTAGE
rotor to start turning. The rotor will try to “catch-up” with the moving field, but cannot, in
a condition known as slip. Slip is defined as the difference between the synchronous speed
of the stator and the rotor speed. The rotor can never reach the synchronous speed of the
stator field because, if it did, it would not cut any field lines and the torque would drop to
zero. Without torque, the rotor could not turn itself.
Initially, before the rotor starts moving, there is no back emf, so the stator current is high.
As the rotor speeds up, it generates a back emf that opposes the stator current. As the motor
speeds up, the torque produced balances the load and the current is just enough to keep the ro-
tor turning. The running current is significantly lower than the initial start-up current because
of the back emf. If the load on the motor is then increased, the motor will slow down and gen-
erate less back emf. This increases the current to the motor and increases the torque it can ap-
ply to the load. Thus, an induction motor can operate over a range of speeds and torque.
Maximum torque occurs when the rotor is spinning at about 75% of the synchronous speed.
Synchronous Motors
Recall that an induction motor develops no torque if it runs at the synchronous speed, so it
must run slower than the synchronous speed, depending on the load. The synchronous mo-
tor will run at the synchronous speed and still develop the required torque for different loads.
The only way to change the speed of a synchronous motor is to change the frequency.
The fact that synchronous motors maintain a constant speed for all load conditions is a
major advantage in certain industrial operations and in applications where clock or timing
requirements are involved (such as a telescope drive motor or a chart recorder). In fact, the
first application of synchronous motors was in electric clocks (in 1917).
Another important advantage to large synchronous motors is their efficiency. Although
their original cost is higher than a comparable induction motor, the savings in power will
often pay for the cost difference in a few years.
Operation of a Synchronous Motor
Essentially, the rotating stator field of the syn-
chronous motor is identical to that of an induction motor. The primary difference in the two
motors is in the rotor. The induction motor has a rotor that is electrically isolated from a
supply and the synchronous motor uses a magnet to follow the rotating stator field. Small
synchronous motors use a permanent magnet for the rotor; larger motors use an electro-
magnet. When an electromagnet is used, dc is supplied from an external source via slip
rings as in the case of the alternator.

INTRODUCTION TO ALTERNATING CURRENT AND VOLTAGE
Pulse Waveforms
Basically, a pulse can be described as a very rapid transition (leading edge) from one volt-
age or current level (baseline) to an amplitude level, and then, after an interval of time, a
very rapid transition (trailing edge) back to the original baseline level. The transitions in
level are also called steps. An ideal pulse consists of two opposite-going steps of equal am-
plitude. When the leading or trailing edge is positive-going, it is called a rising edge. When
the leading or trailing edge is negative-going, it is called a falling edge.
Figure 51(a) shows an ideal positive-going pulse consisting of two equal but oppo-
site instantaneous steps separated by an interval of time called the pulse width. Part (b) of
Figure 51 shows an ideal negative-going pulse. The height of the pulse measured from 
the baseline is its voltage (or current) amplitude.

Ideal pulses.
In many applications, analysis is simplified by treating all pulses as ideal (composed
of instantaneous steps and perfectly rectangular in shape). Actual pulses, however, are
never ideal. All pulses possess certain characteristics that cause them to be different from
the ideal.
In practice, pulses cannot change from one level to another instantaneously. Time is
always required for a transition (step), as illustrated in Figure 52(a). As you can see, 
there is an interval of time during the rising edge in which the pulse is going from its lower
value to its higher value. This interval is called the rise time,
Rise time is the time required for the pulse to go from 10% of its amplitude to 90%
of its amplitude.

INTRODUCTION TO ALTERNATING CURRENT AND VOLTAGE
The interval of time during the falling edge in which the pulse is going from its higher
value to its lower value is called the fall time,
Fall time is the time required for the pulse to go from 90% of its amplitude to 10%
of its amplitude.
Pulse width, 
also requires a precise definition for the nonideal pulse because the ris-
ing and falling edges are not vertical.
Pulse width is the time between the point on the rising edge, where the value is 50%
of amplitude, to the point on the falling edge, where the value is 50% of amplitude.
Pulse width is shown in Figure 52(b).
Repetitive Pulses
Any waveform that repeats itself at fixed intervals is periodic. Some
examples of periodic pulse waveforms are shown in Figure 53. Notice that, in each 
case, the pulses repeat at regular intervals. The rate at which the pulses repeat is the pulse
repetition frequency, which is the fundamental frequency of the waveform. The fre-
quency can be expressed in hertz or in pulses per second. The time from one pulse to the
corresponding point on the next pulse is the period, T. The relationship between frequency
and period is the same as with the sine wave, f = 1/T.

of a pulse waveform
is equal to its baseline value plus its duty cycle times its amplitude. The lower level of a
positive-going waveform or the upper level of a negative-going waveform is taken as the
baseline. The formula is as follows:

Triangular and Sawtooth Waveforms
Triangular and sawtooth waveforms are formed by voltage or current ramps. A ramp is a
linear increase or decrease in the voltage or current. Figure 57 shows both positive- and
negative-going ramps. In part (a), the ramp has a positive slope; in part (b), the ramp has a
negative slope. The slope of a voltage ramp is 
and is expressed in units of V/s. The
slope of a current ramp is 
and is expressed in units of A/s.

Figure 59 shows that a triangular waveform is composed 
of positive-going and negative-going ramps having equal slopes. The period of this wave-
form is measured from one peak to the next corresponding peak, as illustrated. This partic-
ular triangular waveform is alternating and has an average value of zero.

Sawtooth Waveforms
The sawtooth waveform is actually a special case of the trian-
gular wave consisting of two ramps, one of much longer duration than the other. Sawtooth
waveforms are used in many electronic systems. For example, the electron beam that
sweeps across the screen of a CRT TV receiver, creating the picture, is controlled by
sawtooth voltages and currents. One sawtooth wave produces the horizontal beam move-
ment, and the other produces the vertical beam movement. A sawtooth voltage is sometimes
called a sweep voltage.
Figure 61 is an example of a sawtooth wave. Notice that it consists of a positive-
going ramp of relatively long duration, followed by a negative-going ramp of relatively
short duration.

INTRODUCTION TO ALTERNATING CURRENT AND VOLTAGE
Harmonics
A repetitive nonsinusoidal waveform is composed of a fundamental frequency and har-
monic frequencies. The fundamental frequency is the repetition rate of the waveform,
and the harmonics are higher frequency sine waves that are multiples of the fundamental.
Odd Harmonics
Odd harmonics are frequencies that are odd multiples of the funda-
mental frequency of a waveform. For example, a 1 kHz square wave consists of a funda-
mental of 1 kHz and odd harmonics of 3 kHz, 5 kHz, 7 kHz, and so on. The 3 kHz
frequency in this case is called the third harmonic, the 5 kHz frequency is the fifth har-
monic, and so on.
Even Harmonics
Even harmonics are frequencies that are even multiples of the funda-
mental frequency. For example, if a certain wave has a fundamental of 200 Hz, the second
harmonic is 400 Hz, the fourth harmonic is 800 Hz, the sixth harmonic is 1200 Hz, and so
on. These are even harmonics.
Composite Waveform
Any variation from a pure sine wave produces harmonics. A
nonsinusoidal wave is a composite of the fundamental and the harmonics. Some types of
waveforms have only odd harmonics, some have only even harmonics, and some contain both.
The shape of the wave is determined by its harmonic content. Generally, only the fundamental
and the first few harmonics are of significant importance in determining the wave shape.
A square wave is an example of a waveform that consists of a fundamental and only odd
harmonics. When the instantaneous values of the fundamental and each odd harmonic are
added algebraically at each point, the resulting curve will have the shape of a square wave,
as illustrated in Figure 62. In part (a) of the figure, the fundamental and the third har-
monic produce a wave shape that begins to resemble a square wave. In part (b), the funda-
mental, third, and fifth harmonics produce a closer resemblance. When the seventh
harmonic is included, as in part (c), the resulting wave shape becomes even more like a
square wave. As more harmonics are included, a periodic square wave is approached.

INTRODUCTION TO ALTERNATING CURRENT AND VOLTAGE
The oscilloscope is basically a graph-displaying device that traces a graph of a measured
electrical signal on its screen. In most applications, the graph shows how signals change over
time. The vertical axis of the display screen represents voltage, and the horizontal axis repre-
sents time. You can measure amplitude, period, and frequency of a signal using an oscillo-
scope. Also, you can determine the pulse width, duty cycle, rise time, and fall time of a pulse
waveform. Most scopes can display at least two signals on the screen at one time, enabling
you to observe their time relationship. Typical oscilloscopes are shown in Figure 64.
Two basic types of oscilloscopes, digital, and analog can be used to view digital wave-
forms. The digital scope converts the measured waveform to digital information by a sam-
pling process in an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The digital information is then used to
reconstruct the waveform on the screen. The analog scope works by applying the measured
waveform directly to control the up and down motion of the electron beam in the cathode-ray

observing and measuring waveforms.

tube (CRT) as it sweeps across the screen. As a result, the beam traces out the waveform pat-
tern on the screen.
The digital scope is more widely used than the analog scope. However, either type can be
used in many applications; each has characteristics that make it more suitable for certain sit-
uations. An analog scope displays waveforms as they occur in “real time.” Digital scopes are
useful for measuring transient pulses that may occur randomly or only once. Also, because
information about the measured waveform can be stored in a digital scope, it may be viewed
at some later time, printed out, or thoroughly analyzed by a computer or other means.
Basic Operation of Analog Oscilloscopes
To measure a voltage, a probe must be connected from the scope to the point in a circuit at
which the voltage is present. Generally, a 
probe is used that reduces (attenuates) the sig-
nal amplitude by ten. The signal goes through the probe into the vertical circuits where it is
either further attenuated or amplified, depending on the actual amplitude and on where you set
the vertical control of the scope. The vertical circuits then drive the vertical deflection plates of
the CRT. Also, the signal goes to the trigger circuits that trigger the horizontal circuits to initi-
ate repetitive horizontal sweeps of the electron beam across the screen using a sawtooth wave-
form. There are many sweeps per second so that the beam appears to form a solid line across
the screen in the shape of the waveform. This basic operation is illustrated in Figure 65.

Basic Operation of Digital Oscilloscopes
Some parts of a digital scope are similar to the analog scope. However, the digital scope is
more complex than an analog scope and typically has an LCD screen rather than a CRT.
Rather than displaying a waveform as it occurs, the digital scope first acquires the meas-
ured analog waveform and converts it to a digital format using an analog-to-digital con-
verter (ADC). The digital data is stored and processed. The data then goes to the
reconstruction and display circuits for display in its original analog form. Figure 66
show a basic block diagram for a digital oscilloscope.

Oscilloscope Controls
A front panel view of a typical dual-channel oscilloscope is shown in Figure 67.
Instruments vary depending on model and manufacturer, but most have certain common
features. For example, the two vertical sections contain a Position control, a channel menu
button, and a Volts/Div control. The horizontal section contains a Sec/Div control.
Some of the main controls are now discussed. Refer to the user manual for complete
details of your particular scope.
Vertical Controls
In the vertical section of the scope in Figure 67, there are identical
controls for each of the two channels (CH1 and CH2). The Position control lets you move
a displayed waveform up or down vertically on the screen. The buttons immediately right
of the screen provide for the selection of several items that appear on the screen, such as the
coupling modes (ac, dc, or ground), coarse or fine adjustment for the Volts/Div, signal in-
version, and other parameters. The Volts/Div control adjusts the number of volts repre-
sented by each vertical division on the screen. The Volts/Div setting for each channel is
displayed on the bottom of the screen.
Horizontal Controls
In the horizontal section, the controls apply to both channels. The
Position control lets you move a displayed waveform left or right horizontally on the
screen. The Horizontal Menu button provides for the selection of several items that appear
on the screen such as the main time base, expanded view of a portion of a waveform, and
486

INTRODUCTION TO ALTERNATING CURRENT AND VOLTAGE
other parameters. The Sec/Div control adjusts the time represented by each horizontal di-
vision or main time base. The Sec/Div setting is displayed at the bottom of the screen.
Trigger Controls
In the Trigger section, the Level control determines the point on the
triggering waveform where triggering occurs to initiate the sweep to display input wave-
forms. The Trigger Menu button provides for the selection of several items that appear on
the screen including edge or slope triggering, trigger source, trigger mode, and other pa-
rameters. There is also an input for an external trigger signal.
Triggering stabilizes a waveform on the screen and properly triggers on a pulse that oc-
curs only one time or randomly. Also, it allows you to observe time delays between two
waveforms. Figure 68 compares a triggered to an untriggered signal. The untriggered 
signal tends to drift across the screen producing what appears to be multiple waveforms.

from the Vertical menu. DC coupling allows a waveform including its dc component to be

INTRODUCTION TO ALTERNATING CURRENT AND VOLTAGE
The voltage probe, shown in Figure 70, is used for connecting a signal to the scope.
Since all instruments tend to affect the circuit being measured due to loading, most scope
probes provide a high series resistance to minimize loading effects. Probes that have a se-
ries resistance ten times larger than the input resistance of the scope are called 
(times
ten) probes. Probes with no series resistance are called 
(times one) probes. The oscil-
loscope adjusts its calibration for the attenuation of the type of probe being used. For most
measurements, the 
probe should be used. However, if you are measuring very small
signals, a

The probe has an adjustment that allows you to compensate for the input capacitance of
the scope. Most scopes have a probe compensation output that provides a calibrated square
wave for probe compensation. Before making a measurement, you should make sure that the
probe is properly compensated to eliminate any distortion introduced. Typically, there is a
screw or other means of adjusting compensation on a probe. Figure 71 shows scope 
waveforms for three probe conditions: properly compensated, undercompensated, and over-
compensated. If the waveform appears either over- or under-compensated, adjust the probe
until the properly compensated square wave is achieved.

centered at 0 V. The Ground mode allows you to connect the channel input to ground to see
where the 0 V reference is on the screen. Figure 69 illustrates the result of DC and AC 
coupling using a sinusoidal waveform that has a dc component.

Application Activity
As you learned in this chapter, nonsi-
nusoidal waveforms contain a combi-
nation of various harmonic
frequencies. Each of these harmonics
is a sinusoidal waveform with a certain frequency. Certain sinu-
soidal frequencies are audible; that is, they can be heard by the
human ear. A single audible frequency, or pure sine wave, is
called a tone and generally falls in the frequency range from
about 300 Hz to about 15 kHz. When you hear a tone repro-
duced through a speaker, its loudness, or volume, depends on its
voltage amplitude. You will use your knowledge of sine wave
characteristics and the operation of an oscilloscope to measure
the frequency and amplitude of signals at various points in a ba-
sic radio receiver.
Actual voice or music signals that are picked up by a radio
receiver contain many harmonic frequencies with different volt-
age values. A voice or music signal is continuously changing, so
its harmonic content is also changing. However, if a single sinu-
soidal frequency is transmitted and picked up by the receiver,
you will hear a constant tone from the speaker.
Although, at this point you do not have the background to
study amplifiers and receiver systems in detail, you can observe

by the same corresponding circled numbers. In all cases, the up-
per waveform on the screen is channel 1 and the lower wave-
form is channel 2. The readings on the bottom of the screen
show readings for both channels.
The signal at point 1 is an AM signal, but you can’t see the
amplitude variation because of the short time base. The wave-
form is spread out too much to see the modulating audio signal,
which causes amplitude variations; so what you see is just one
cycle of the carrier. At point 3, the higher carrier frequency is
difficult to determine because the time base was selected to al-
low viewing of one full cycle of the modulating signal. In an
AM receiver, this intermediate frequency is 455 kHz. In actual
practice, the modulated carrier signal at point 3 cannot easily be
viewed on the scope because it contains two frequencies that
make it difficult to synchronize in order to obtain a stable
the signals at various points in the receiver. A block diagram of
a typical AM receiver is shown in Figure 73. AM stands for 
amplitude modulation, a topic that will be covered in another
course. Figure 74 shows what a basic AM signal looks like, 
and for now that’s all you need to know. As you can see, the
amplitude of the sinusoidal waveform is changing. The higher
radio frequency (RF) signal is called the carrier; and its ampli-
tude is varied or modulated by a lower frequency signal, which
is the audio (a tone in this case). Normally, however, the audio
signal is a complex voice or music waveform.

SUMMARY
◆The sine wave is a time-varying, periodic waveform.
◆Alternating current changes direction in response to changes in the polarity of the source voltage.
◆One cycle of an alternating sine wave consists of a positive alternation and a negative alternation.
◆Two common sources of sine waves are the electromagnetic ac generator and the electronic oscil-
lator circuit.
◆A full cycle of a sine wave is 
or 2
radians. A half-cycle is 
or 
radian. A quarter-
cycle is 
or /2 radians.
◆A sinusoidal voltage can be generated by a conductor rotating in a magnetic field.
◆Phase angle is the difference in degrees or radians between a given sine wave and a reference sine
wave.
◆The angular position of a phasor represents the angle of the sine wave with respect to a 
refer-
ence, and the length or magnitude of a phasor represents the amplitude.
◆Alternators (ac generators) produce power when there is relative motion between a magnetic field
and a conductor.
◆Most alternators take the output from the stator. The rotor provides a moving magnetic field.
◆Two major types of ac motors are induction motors and synchronous motors.
◆Induction motors have a rotor that turns in response to a rotating field from the stator.
◆Synchronous motors move at a constant speed in sync with the field of the stator.
◆A pulse consists of a transition from a baseline level to an amplitude level, followed by a transi-
tion back to the baseline level.
◆A triangle or sawtooth wave consists of positive-going and negative-going ramps.
◆Harmonic frequencies are odd or even multiples of the repetition rate of a nonsinusoidal wave-
form.
◆Conversions of sine wave values are summarized in Table 2.

INTRODUCTION
In this chapter, you will learn about the capacitor and 
its characteristics. The physical construction and electrical
properties are examined, and the effects of connecting 
capacitors in series and in parallel are analyzed. How a 
capacitor works in both dc and ac circuits is an important
part of this coverage and forms the basis for the study of 
reactive circuits in terms of both frequency response and
time response.
The capacitor is an electrical device that can store electri-
cal charge, thereby creating an electric field that, in turn,
stores energy. The measure of the energy-storing ability of a
capacitor is its capacitance. When a sinusoidal signal is ap-
plied to a capacitor, it reacts in a certain way and produces
an opposition to current, which depends on the frequency of
the applied signal. This opposition to current is called
capacitive reactance.

CAPACITORS
Basic Construction
In its simplest form, a capacitor is an electrical device that stores electrical charge and is
constructed of two parallel conductive plates separated by an insulating material called the
dielectric. Connecting leads are attached to the parallel plates. A basic capacitor is shown
in Figure 1(a), and a schematic symbol is shown in part (b).

How a Capacitor Stores Charge
In the neutral state, both plates of a capacitor have an equal number of free electrons, as in-
dicated in Figure 2(a). When the capacitor is connected to a voltage source through a 
resistor, as shown in part (b), electrons (negative charge) are removed from plate A, and an
equal number are deposited on plate B. As plate A loses electrons and plate B gains elec-
trons, plate A becomes positive with respect to plate B. During this charging process, elec-
trons flow only through the connecting leads. No electrons flow through the dielectric of
the capacitor because it is an insulator. The movement of electrons ceases when the voltage
across the capacitor equals the source voltage, as indicated in Figure 2(c). If the capac-
itor is disconnected from the source, it retains the stored charge for a long period of time
(the length of time depends on the type of capacitor) and still has the voltage across it, as
shown in Figure 2(d). A charged capacitor can act as a temporary battery. 
This icon indicates selected websites for further information on topics in this section. See the Companion
Website provided with this text.
Capacitors are capable of storing
electrical charge for a long time
after power has been turned off in
a circuit. Be careful when touching
or handling capacitors in or out of
a circuit. If you touch the leads,
you may be in for a shock as the
capacitor discharges through you!
It is usually good practice to
discharge a capacitor using a
shorting tool with an insulated
grip of some sort before handling
the capacitor.

Capacitance
The amount of charge that a capacitor can store per unit of voltage across its plates is its ca-
pacitance, designated C. That is, capacitance is a measure of a capacitor’s ability to store
charge. The more charge per unit of voltage that a capacitor can store, the greater its ca-
pacitance, as expressed by the following formula:
Equation 1
where C is capacitance, Q is charge, and V is voltage.
By rearranging the terms in Equation 1, you can obtain two other formulas.
C = Q
V
Equation 2
Q = CV
Equation 3
The Unit of Capacitance
The farad (F) is the basic unit of capacitance. Recall that the
coulomb (C) is the unit of electrical charge.
One farad is the amount of capacitance when one coulomb (C) of charge is stored
with one volt across the plates.
Most capacitors that are used in electronics work have capacitance values that are spec-
ified in microfarads 
and picofarads (pF). A microfarad is one-millionth of a farad

How a Capacitor Stores Energy
A capacitor stores energy in the form of an electric field that is established by the opposite
charges stored on the two plates. The electric field is represented by lines of force between
the positive and negative charges and is concentrated within the dielectric, as shown in
Figure 3.
Lines of force
 FIGURE 3
The electric field stores energy in a
capacitor.
Equation 4
When capacitance (C) is in farads and voltage (V) is in volts, the energy (W) is in joules.
Voltage Rating
Every capacitor has a limit on the amount of voltage that it can withstand across its plates.
The voltage rating specifies the maximum dc voltage that can be applied without risk of
damage to the device. If this maximum voltage, commonly called the breakdown voltage
or working voltage, is exceeded, permanent damage to the capacitor can result.
You must consider both the capacitance and the voltage rating before you use a capaci-
tor in a circuit application. The choice of capacitance value is based on particular circuit re-
quirements. The voltage rating should always be above the maximum voltage expected in
a particular application.
Dielectric Strength
The breakdown voltage of a capacitor is determined by the dielec-
tric strength of the dielectric material used. The dielectric strength is expressed in V/mil
Table 2 lists typical values for several materi-
als. Exact values vary depending on the specific composition of the material.
(1 mil = 0.001 in. = 2.54 * 10-5 m).
The plates in Figure 3 have acquired a charge because they are connected to a bat-
tery. This creates an electric field between the plates, which stores energy. The energy
stored in the electric field is directly related to the size of the capacitor and to the square of
the voltage as given by the following equation for the energy stored:
W = 1

CAPACITORS
A capacitor’s dielectric strength can best be explained by an example. Assume that a
certain capacitor has a plate separation of 1 mil and that the dielectric material is ceramic.
This particular capacitor can withstand a maximum voltage of 1000 V because its dielec-
tric strength is 1000 V/mil. If the maximum voltage is exceeded, the dielectric may break
down and conduct current, causing permanent damage to the capacitor. Similarly, if the ce-
ramic capacitor has a plate separation of 2 mils, its breakdown voltage is 2000 V.
Temperature Coefficient
The temperature coefficient indicates the amount and direction of a change in capacitance
value with temperature. A positive temperature coefficient means that the capacitance in-
creases with an increase in temperature or decreases with a decrease in temperature. A neg-
ative coefficient means that the capacitance decreases with an increase in temperature or
increases with a decrease in temperature.
Temperature coefficients are typically specified in parts per million per Celsius degree
. For example, a negative temperature coefficient of 
for a 
capacitor means that for every degree rise in temperature, the capacitance decreases by
150 pF (there are one million picofarads in one microfarad).
Leakage
No insulating material is perfect. The dielectric of any capacitor will conduct some very
small amount of current. Thus, the charge on a capacitor will eventually leak off. Some
types of capacitors, such as large electrolytic types, have higher leakages than others. An
equivalent circuit for a nonideal capacitor is shown in Figure 4. The parallel resistor 
represents the extremely high resistance (several hundred kilohms or more) of the di-
electric material through which there is leakage current.
Physical Characteristics of a Capacitor
The following parameters are important in establishing the capacitance and the voltage rat-
ing of a capacitor: plate area, plate separation, and dielectric constant.
Plate Area
Capacitance is directly proportional to the physical size of the plates as de-
termined by the plate area, A. A larger plate area produces more capacitance, and a smaller
plate area produces less capacitance. Figure 5(a) shows that the plate area of a parallel 
plate capacitor is the area of one of the plates. If the plates are moved in relation to each
other, as shown in Figure 5(b), the overlapping area determines the effective plate area.
This variation in effective plate area is the basis for a certain type of variable capacitor.

Plate Separation
Capacitance is inversely proportional to the distance between the
plates. The plate separation is designated d, as shown in Figure 6. A greater separation 
of the plates produces a smaller capacitance, as illustrated in the figure. As previously
515

CAPACITORS
discussed, the breakdown voltage is directly proportional to the plate separation. The fur-
ther the plates are separated, the greater the breakdown voltage.
Dielectric Constant
As you know, the insulating material between the plates of a ca-
pacitor is called the dielectric. Dielectric materials tend to reduce the voltage between
plates for a given charge and thus increase the capacitance. If the voltage is fixed, more
charge can be stored due to the presence of a dielectric than can be stored without a dielec-
tric. The measure of a material’s ability to establish an electric field is called the dielectric
constant or relative permittivity, symbolized by 
is the Greek letter epsilon.)
Capacitance is directly proportional to the dielectric constant. The dielectric constant
of a vacuum is defined as 1 and that of air is very close to 1. These values are used as a ref-
erence, and all other materials have values of 
specified with respect to that of a vacuum
or air. For example, a material with 
can result in a capacitance eight times greater
than that of air with all other factors being equal.
Table 3 lists several common dielectric materials and a typical dielectric constant for
each. The values can vary because it depends on the specific composition of the material.

CAPACITORS
Fixed Capacitors
Mica Capacitors
Two types of mica capacitors are stacked-foil and silver-mica. The
basic construction of the stacked-foil type is shown in Figure 7. It consists of alternate 
layers of metal foil and thin sheets of mica. The metal foil forms the plate, with alternate
foil sheets connected together to increase the plate area. More layers are used to increase
the plate area, thus increasing the capacitance. The mica/foil stack is encapsulated in an
insulating material such as Bakelite®, as shown in Figure 7(b). A silver-mica capaci-
tor is formed in a similar way by stacking mica sheets with silver electrode material
screened on them.

Mica capacitors are available with capacitance values ranging from 1 pF to 
and
voltage ratings from 100 V dc to 2500 V dc. Mica has a typical dielectric constant of 5.
Ceramic Capacitors
Ceramic dielectrics provide very high dielectric constants (1200 is
typical). As a result, comparatively high capacitance values can be achieved in a small
physical size. Ceramic capacitors are commonly available in a ceramic disk form, as
shown in Figure 8, in a multilayer radial-lead configuration, as shown in Figure 9, 
or in a leadless ceramic chip, as shown in Figure 10, for surface mounting on printed 
circuit boards.
Ceramic capacitors typically are available in capacitance values ranging from 1 pF to
with voltage ratings up to 6 kV.

charge storage in rechargeable

ability to store large amounts of

as plates. One lead is connected to the inner plate and one is connected to the outer plate as
indicated. The strips are then rolled in a spiral configuration and encapsulated in a molded
case. Thus, a large plate area can be packaged in a relatively small physical size, thereby
achieving large capacitance values. Another method uses metal deposited directly on the
film dielectric to form the plates.

Be extremely careful with
electrolytic capacitors because it
does make a difference which way
an electrolytic capacitor is
connected. Always observe the
proper polarity. If a polarized
capacitor is connected backwards,
it may explode and cause injury.
Electrolytic Capacitors
Electrolytic capacitors are polarized so that one plate is positive
and the other negative. These capacitors are used for capacitance values from 
up to
over 
but they have relatively low breakdown voltages (350 V is a typical max-
imum) and high amounts of leakage. In this text, capacitors with values of 
or greater
are considered to be polarized.
In recent years, manufacturers have developed new electrolytic capacitors with much
larger capacitance values; however, these new capacitors have lower voltage ratings than
smaller-value capacitors and tend to be expensive. Super capacitors with capacitances of
hundreds of farads are available. These capacitors are useful for battery backup and for ap-
plications like small motor starters that require a very large capacitance.
Electrolytic capacitors offer much higher capacitance values than mica or ceramic ca-
pacitors, but their voltage ratings are typically lower. Aluminum electrolytics are probably
the most commonly used type. While other capacitors use two similar plates, the elec-
trolytic consists of one plate of aluminum foil and another plate made of a conducting elec-
trolyte applied to a material such as plastic film. These two “plates” are separated by a layer
of aluminum oxide that forms on the surface of the aluminum plate. Figure 13(a) illus-
trates the basic construction of a typical aluminum electrolytic capacitor with axial leads.
Other electrolytics with radial leads are shown in Figure 13(b); the symbol for an elec-
trolytic capacitor is shown in part (c).
Tantalum electrolytics can be in either a tubular configuration similar to Figure 13
or “tear drop” shape as shown in Figure 14. In the tear drop configuration, the positive 
plate is actually a pellet of tantalum powder rather than a sheet of foil. Tantalum pentoxide
forms the dielectric, and manganese dioxide forms the negative plate.
Because of the process used for the insulating oxide dielectric, the metallic (aluminum or
tantalum) plate must be connected so that it is always positive with respect to the electrolyte

plate, and, thus all electrolytic capacitors are polarized. The metal plate (positive lead) is
usually indicated by a plus sign or some other obvious marking and must always be con-
nected in a dc circuit where the voltage across the capacitor does not change polarity re-
gardless of any ac present. Reversal of the polarity of the voltage will usually result in
complete destruction of the capacitor.
The problem of dielectric absorption occurs mostly in electrolytic capacitors when they
do not completely discharge during use and retain a residual charge. Approximately 25%
of defective capacitors exhibit this condition.

CAPACITORS
Variable Capacitors
Variable capacitors are used in a circuit when there is a need to adjust the capacitance value
either manually or automatically. These capacitors are generally less than 300 pF but are
available in larger values for specialized applications. The schematic symbol for a variable
capacitor is shown in Figure 15.
Adjustable capacitors that normally have slotted screw-type adjustments and are used
for very fine adjustments in a circuit are called trimmers. Ceramic or mica is a common
dielectric in these types of capacitors, and the capacitance usually is changed by adjusting
the plate separation. Generally, trimmer capacitors have values less than 100 pF. Figure 
16 shows some typical devices.

capacitor.
 FIGURE 16
Examples of trimmer capacitors.
The varactor is a semiconductor device that exhibits a capacitance characteristic that is
varied by changing the voltage across its terminals. This device usually is covered in detail
in a course on electronic devices.
Capacitor Labeling
Capacitor values are indicated on the body of the capacitor either by typographical labels
or by color codes. Typographical labels consist of letters and numbers that indicate various
parameters such as capacitance, voltage rating, and tolerance.
Some capacitors carry no unit designation for capacitance. In these cases, the units are
implied by the value indicated and are recognized by experience. For example, a ceramic
capacitor marked .001 or .01 has units of microfarads because picofarad values that small
are not available. As another example, a ceramic capacitor labeled 50 or 330 has units of
picofarads because microfarad units that large normally are not available in this type. In
some cases, a 3-digit designation is used. The first two digits are the first two digits of the
capacitance value. The third digit is the number of zeros after the second digit. For exam-
ple, 103 means 10,000 pF. In some instances, the units are labeled as pF or 
sometimes
the microfarad unit is labeled as MF or MFD.
A voltage rating appears on some types of capacitors with WV or WVDC and is omit-
ted on others. When it is omitted, the voltage rating can be determined from information
supplied by the manufacturer. The tolerance of the capacitor is usually labeled as a per-
centage, such as 
The temperature coefficient is indicated by a parts per million
marking. This type of label consists of a P or N followed by a number. For example, N750
means a negative temperature coefficient of 
, and P30 means a positive tem-
perature coefficient of 
An NP0 designation means that the positive and nega-
tive coefficients are zero; thus the capacitance does not change with temperature. Certain
types of capacitors are color coded.
Capacitance Measurement
A capacitance meter such as the one shown in Figure 17 can be used to check the value of 
a capacitor. Also, many DMMs provide a capacitance measurement feature. Most capacitors
change value over a period of time, some more than others. Ceramic capacitors, for example,
often exhibit a 10% to 15% change in value during the first year. Electrolytic capacitors are
30 ppm/°C.

particularly subject to value change due to drying of the electrolytic solution. In other cases,
capacitors may be labeled incorrectly or the wrong value may have been installed in the cir-
cuit. Although a value change represents less than 25% of defective capacitors, a value check
can quickly eliminate this as a source of trouble when troubleshooting a circuit.
Typically, values from 200 pF to 
can be measured on a capacitance meter
by simply connecting the capacitor, setting the switch, and reading the value on the display.
Some capacitance meters can also be used to check for leakage current in capacitors. In or-
der to check for leakage, a sufficient voltage must be applied across the capacitor to simu-
late operating conditions. This is automatically done by the test instrument. Over 40% of
all defective capacitors have excessive leakage current and electrolytics are particularly
susceptible to this problem.

Total Capacitance
When capacitors are connected in series, the total capacitance is less than the smallest capac-
itance value because the effective plate separation increases. The calculation of total series ca-
pacitance is analogous to the calculation of total resistance of parallel resistors.

with a voltage source and a switch. When the switch is closed, the capacitors charge as

SERIES CAPACITORS

When capacitors are connected in parallel, the total capacitance is the sum of the indi-

allel capacitance is analogous to the calculation of total series resistance.
Consider what happens when the switch in Figure 24 is closed. The total charging 
current from the source divides at the junction of the parallel branches. There is a separate
charging current through each branch so that a different charge can be stored by each ca-

CAPACITORS IN DC CIRCUITS
A capacitor will charge up when it is connected to a dc voltage source. The buildup of
charge across the plates occurs in a predictable manner that is dependent on the capac-
itance and the resistance in a circuit.
After completing this section, you should be able to

◆Explain why a capacitor blocks dc
Charging a Capacitor
A capacitor will charge when it is connected to a dc voltage source, as shown in Figure 
27. The capacitor in part (a) of the figure is uncharged; that is, plate A and plate B have
equal numbers of free electrons. When the switch is closed, as shown in part (b), the source
moves electrons away from plate A through the circuit to plate B as the arrows indicate. As
529

CAPACITORS
plate A loses electrons and plate B gains electrons, plate A becomes positive with respect to
plate B. As this charging process continues, the voltage across the plates builds up rapidly
until it is equal to the applied voltage, 
but opposite in polarity, as shown in part (c).
When the capacitor is fully charged, there is no current.
A capacitor blocks constant dc.
When the charged capacitor is disconnected from the source, as shown in Figure 
27(d), it remains charged for long periods of time, depending on its leakage resistance, and
can cause severe electrical shock. The charge on an electrolytic capacitor generally leaks
off more rapidly than in other types of capacitors.
Discharging a Capacitor
When a wire is connected across a charged capacitor, as shown in Figure 28, the
capacitor will discharge. In this particular case, a very low resistance path (the wire) is
connected across the capacitor with a switch. Before the switch is closed, the capacitor
is charged to 50 V, as indicated in part (a). When the switch is closed, as shown in part (b),
the excess electrons on plate B move through the circuit to plate A (indicated by the ar-
rows); as a result of the electrons moving through the low resistance of the wire, the
energy stored by the capacitor is dissipated in the wire. The charge is neutralized when
the numbers of free electrons on both plates are again equal. At this time, the voltage
across the capacitor is zero, and the capacitor is completely discharged, as shown in 
part (c).

Current and Voltage During Charging and Discharging
Notice in Figures 27 and 28 that the direction of electron flow during discharge is 
opposite to that during charging. It is important to understand that ideally there is no cur-
rent through the dielectric of the capacitor during charging or discharging because the
530

CAPACITORS
dielectric is an insulating material. There is current from one plate to the other only
through the external circuit.
Figure 29(a) shows a capacitor connected in series with a resistor and a switch to a 
dc voltage source. Initially, the switch is open and the capacitor is uncharged with zero
volts across its plates. At the instant the switch is closed, the current jumps to its maximum
value and the capacitor begins to charge. The current is maximum initially because the ca-
pacitor has zero volts across it and, therefore, effectively acts as a short; thus, the current is
limited only by the resistance. As time passes and the capacitor charges, the current de-
creases and the voltage across the capacitor 
increases. The resistor voltage is propor-
tional to the current during this charging period.
After a certain period of time, the capacitor reaches full charge. At this point, the current
is zero and the capacitor voltage is equal to the dc source voltage, as shown in Figure 
29(b). If the switch were opened now, the capacitor would retain its full charge 
(neglecting any leakage).
In Figure 29(c), the voltage source has been removed. When the switch is closed, the 
capacitor begins to discharge. Initially, the current jumps to a maximum but in a direction
opposite to its direction during charging. As time passes, the current and capacitor voltage
decrease. The resistor voltage is always proportional to the current. When the capacitor has
fully discharged, the current and the capacitor voltage are zero.
Remember the following rules about capacitors in dc circuits:
1. A capacitor appears as an open to constant voltage.
2. A capacitor appears as a short to an instantaneous change in voltage.

CAPACITORS
The RC Time Constant
In a practical situation, there cannot be capacitance without some resistance in a circuit. It
may simply be the small resistance of a wire, a Thevenin source resistance, or it may be a
physical resistor. Because of this, the charging and discharging characteristics of a capaci-
tor must always be considered with the associated resistance. The resistance introduces the
element of time in the charging and discharging of a capacitor.
When a capacitor charges or discharges through a resistance, a certain time is required
for the capacitor to charge fully or discharge fully. The voltage across a capacitor cannot
change instantaneously because a finite time is required to move charge from one point to
another. The time constant of a series RC circuit determines the rate at which the capacitor
charges or discharges.
The RC time constant is a fixed time interval that equals the product of the re-
sistance and the capacitance in a series RC circuit.
The time constant is expressed in seconds when resistance is in ohms and capacitance is
in farads. It is symbolized by (Greek letter tau), and the formula is
t = RC
t
Equation 16
Recall that 
The current depends on the amount of charge moved in a given
time. When the resistance is increased, the charging current is reduced, thus increasing the
charging time of the capacitor. When the capacitance is increased, the amount of charge in-
creases; thus, for the same current, more time is required to charge the capacitor.

EXAMPLE 11
When a capacitor is charging or discharging between two voltage levels, the charge on the
capacitor changes by approximately 63% of the difference in the levels in one time constant.
An uncharged capacitor charges to 63% of its fully charged voltage in one time constant.
When a capacitor is discharging, its voltage drops to approximately 
of its initial value in one time constant, which is a 63% change.
The Charging and Discharging Curves
A capacitor charges and discharges following a nonlinear curve, as shown in Figure 30. 
In these graphs, the approximate percentage of full charge is shown at each time-constant
interval. This type of curve follows a precise mathematical formula and is called an
exponential curve. The charging curve is an increasing exponential, and the discharging
curve is a decreasing exponential. It takes five time constants to change the voltage by 99%
(considered 100%). This five time-constant interval is generally accepted as the time to
fully charge or discharge a capacitor and is called the transient time.
General Formula
The general expressions for either increasing or decreasing exponen-
tial curves are given in the following equations for both instantaneous voltage and instan-
taneous current.
 v = VF + (Vi - VF)e-t/t

of the capacitor voltage and current at time t, and e is the base of natural logarithms. The 
key on a calculator makes it easy to work with this exponential term.

The formula for the special case in which an increasing exponen-
tial voltage curve begins at zero

The full charge voltage is 100 V, which is at the 100% level (1.0) on the normalized

Response to a Square Wave
A common case that illustrates the rising and falling exponential occurs when an RC circuit
is driven with a square wave that has a long period compared to the time constant. The
square wave provides on and off action but, unlike a single switch, it provides a discharge
path back through the generator when the wave drops back to zero.
When the square wave rises, the voltage across the capacitor rises exponentially toward
the maximum value of the square wave in a time that depends on the time constant. When
the square wave returns to the zero level, the capacitor voltage decreases exponentially,
again depending on the time constant. The Thevenin resistance of the generator is part of
the RC time constant; however, it can be ignored if it is small compared to R. Example 
16 shows the waveforms for the case where the period is long compared to the time 
constant.

Use Equation 21 to find the discharge time.
You can determine ln(0.25) with your calculator by using the LN key.

To explain fully how capacitors work in ac circuits, the concept of the derivative must
be introduced. The derivative of a time-varying quantity is the instantaneous rate of change
of that quantity.
Recall that current is the rate of flow of charge (electrons). Therefore, instantaneous cur-
rent, i, can be expressed as the instantaneous rate of change of charge, q, with respect to
time, t.

opposition, called capacitive reactance, that depends on the frequency of the ac.

The term dq/dt is the derivative of q with respect to time and represents the instantaneous rate

Therefore, from a basic
rule of differential calculus, the derivative of q with respect to time is

This formula states
The instantaneous capacitor current is equal to the capacitance times the instan-
taneous rate of change of the voltage across the capacitor.
The faster the voltage across a capacitor changes, the greater the current.
Phase Relationship of Current and Voltage in a Capacitor
Consider what happens when a sinusoidal voltage is applied across a capacitor, as shown
in Figure 41(a). The voltage waveform has a maximum rate of change 
at the zero crossings and a zero rate of change 
at the peaks, as indicated in
Figure 41(b).
The phase relationship between the current and the voltage for the capacitor can be
established from Equation 24. When 
i is also zero because 
When 
is a positive-going maximum, i is a positive maximum; when 
is a negative-going maximum, i is a negative maximum.
A sinusoidal voltage always produces a sinusoidal current in a capacitive circuit. There-
fore, you can plot the current with respect to the voltage if you know the points on the volt-
age curve at which the current is zero and those at which it is maximum. This relationship
is shown in Figure 42(a). Notice that the current leads the voltage in phase by

the slope of sine wave A at the zero crossings is steeper than that of sine wave B. The slope
of a curve at a point indicates the rate of change at that point. Sine wave A has a higher fre-
quency than sine wave B, as indicated by a greater maximum rate of change (dv/dt is

Reactance for Series Capacitors
When capacitors are in series in an ac circuit, the total capacitance is smaller than the small-
est individual capacitance. Because the total capacitance is smaller, the total capacitive reac-

Ohm’s Law
The reactance of a capacitor is analogous to the resistance of a resistor. In
fact, both are expressed in ohms. Since both R and XC are forms of opposition to current.
Ohm’s law applies to capacitive circuits as well as to resistive circuits; and it is stated as
follows for Figure 46:
When applying Ohm’s law in ac circuits, you must express both the current and the volt-
age in the same way, that is, both in rms, both in peak, and so on.

Capacitive Voltage Divider
In ac circuits, capacitors can be used in applications that require a voltage divider. (Some
oscillator circuits use this method to tap off a fraction of the output.) The voltage across a
series capacitor was given as Equation 12, which is repeated here 
A resistive voltage divider is expressed in terms of a resistance ratio, which is a ratio of
oppositions. You can think of the capacitive voltage divider by applying this idea from a re-
sistive divider, but using reactance in place of resistance. The equation for the voltage

CAPACITORS
Power in a Capacitor
As discussed earlier in this chapter, a charged capacitor stores energy in the electric field
within the dielectric. An ideal capacitor does not dissipate energy; it only stores it tem-
porarily. When an ac voltage is applied to a capacitor, energy is stored by the capacitor dur-
ing a portion of the voltage cycle; then the stored energy is returned to the source during
another portion of the cycle. There is no net energy loss. Figure 49 shows the power 
curve that results from one cycle of capacitor voltage and current.
Notice that the voltage across the larger capacitor is the smaller fraction of the total.
You can obtain the same result from Equation 12.

Instantaneous Power (p)
The product of v and i gives instantaneous power. At points
where v or i is zero, p is also zero. When both v and i are positive, p is also positive. When
either v or i is positive and the other is negative, p is negative. When both v and i are nega-
tive, p is positive. As you can see, the power follows a sinusoidal-shaped curve. Positive
values of power indicate that energy is stored by the capacitor. Negative values of power in-
dicate that energy is returned from the capacitor to the source. Note that the power fluctu-
ates at a frequency twice that of the voltage or current as energy is alternately stored and
returned to the source.
True Power (Ptrue)
Ideally, all of the energy stored by a capacitor during the positive
portion of the power cycle is returned to the source during the negative portion. No net en-
ergy is lost due to conversion to heat in the capacitor, so the true power is zero. Actually,
because of leakage and foil resistance in a practical capacitor, a small percentage of the to-
tal power is dissipated in the form of true power.

CAPACITORS
Reactive Power (Pr)
The rate at which a capacitor stores or returns energy is called its
reactive power. The reactive power is a nonzero quantity, because at any instant in time,
the capacitor is actually taking energy from the source or returning energy to it. Reactive
power does not represent an energy loss. The following formulas apply:

CAPACITORS
If you pick up any circuit board, open any power supply, or look inside any piece of
electronic equipment, chances are you will find capacitors of one type or another. These
components are used for a variety of reasons in both dc and ac applications.
Electrical Storage
One of the most basic applications of a capacitor is as a backup voltage source for low-
power circuits such as certain types of semiconductor memories in computers. This partic-
ular application requires a very high capacitance value and negligible leakage.
The storage capacitor is connected between the dc power supply input to the circuit and
ground. When the circuit is operating from its normal power supply, the capacitor remains
fully charged to the dc power supply voltage. If the normal power source is disrupted,
effectively removing the power supply from the circuit, the storage capacitor temporarily
becomes the power source for the circuit.
A capacitor provides voltage and current to a circuit as long as its charge remains suffi-
cient. As current is drawn by the circuit, charge is removed from the capacitor and the volt-
age decreases. For this reason, the storage capacitor can only be used as a temporary power
source. The length of time that a capacitor can provide sufficient power to the circuit depends
on the capacitance and the amount of current drawn by the circuit. The smaller the current and
the higher the capacitance, the longer the time a capacitor can provide power to a circuit.
Power Supply Filtering
A basic dc power supply consists of a circuit known as a rectifier followed by a filter. The
rectifier converts the 120 V, 60 Hz sinusoidal voltage available at a standard outlet to a pul-
sating dc voltage that can be either a half-wave rectified voltage or a full-wave rectified volt-
age, depending on the type of rectifier circuit. As shown in Figure 52(a), a half-wave
rectifier removes each negative half-cycle of the sinusoidal voltage. As shown in Figure
52(b), a full-wave rectifier actually reverses the polarity of the negative portion of each 
cycle. Both half-wave and full-wave rectified voltages are dc because, even though they are
changing, they do not alternate polarity.
To be useful for powering electronic circuits, the rectified voltage must be changed to
constant dc voltage because all circuits require constant power. The filter nearly eliminates
the fluctuations in the rectified voltage and ideally provides a smooth constant-value dc
voltage to the load that is the electronic circuit, as indicated in Figure 53.
The Capacitor as a Power Supply Filter
Capacitors are used as filters in dc power sup-
plies because of their ability to store electrical charge. Figure 54(a) shows a dc power 
supply with a full-wave rectifier and a capacitor filter. The operation can be described from
a charging and discharging point of view as follows. Assume the capacitor is initially un-
charged. When the power supply is first turned on and the first cycle of the rectified voltage

CAPACITORS
occurs, the capacitor will quickly charge through the low forward resistance of the rectifier.
The capacitor voltage will follow the rectified voltage curve up to the peak of the rectified
voltage. As the rectified voltage passes the peak and begins to decrease, the capacitor will
begin to discharge very slowly through the high resistance of the load circuit, as indicated in
Figure 54(b). The amount of discharge is typically very small and is exaggerated in the 
figure for purposes of illustration. The next cycle of the rectified voltage will recharge the ca-
pacitor back to the peak value by replenishing the small amount of charge lost since the pre-
vious peak. This pattern of a small amount of charging and discharging continues as long as
the power is on.
A rectifier is designed so that it allows current only in the direction to charge the capac-
itor. The capacitor will not discharge back through the rectifier but will only discharge a
small amount through the relatively high resistance of the load. The small fluctuation in
voltage due to the charging and discharging of the capacitor is called the ripple voltage. A
good dc power supply has a very small amount of ripple on its dc output. The discharge
time constant of a power supply filter capacitor depends on its capacitance and the resist-
ance of the load; consequently, the higher the capacitance value, the longer the discharge
time and therefore, the smaller the ripple voltage.
DC Blocking and AC Coupling
Capacitors are commonly used to block the constant dc voltage in one part of a circuit from
getting to another part. As an example of this, a capacitor is connected between two stages
of an amplifier to prevent the dc voltage at the output of stage 1 from affecting the dc volt-
age at the input of stage 2, as illustrated in Figure 55. Assume that, for proper opera-
tion, the output of stage 1 has a zero dc voltage and the input to stage 2 has a 3 V dc voltage.
The capacitor prevents the 3 V dc at stage 2 from getting to the stage 1 output and affect-
ing its zero value, and vice versa.

 FIGURE 55
An application of a capacitor to
block dc and couple ac in an 
amplifier.
If a sinusoidal signal voltage is applied to the input to stage 1, the signal voltage is in-
creased (amplified) and appears on the ouput of stage 1, as shown in Figure 55. The am-
plified signal voltage is then coupled through the capacitor to the input of stage 2 where it
is superimposed on the 3 V dc level and then again amplified by stage 2. In order for the
signal voltage to be passed through the capacitor without being reduced, the capacitor must
be large enough so that its reactance at the frequency of the signal voltage is negligible. In
550

CAPACITORS
this type of application, the capacitor is known as a coupling capacitor, which ideally ap-
pears as an open to dc and as a short to ac. As the signal frequency is reduced, the capaci-
tive reactance increases and, at some point, the capacitive reactance becomes large enough
to cause a significant reduction in ac voltage between stage 1 and stage 2.
Power Line Decoupling
Capacitors connected from the dc supply voltage line to ground are used on circuit boards
to decouple unwanted voltage transients or spikes that occur on the dc supply voltage be-
cause of fast switching digital circuits. A voltage transient contains high frequencies that
may affect the operation of the circuits. These transients are shorted to ground through the
very low reactance of the decoupling capacitors. Several decoupling capacitors are often
used at various points along the supply voltage line on a circuit board.
Bypassing
Another capacitor application is to bypass an ac voltage around a resistor in a circuit with-
out affecting the dc voltage across the resistor. In amplifier circuits, for example, dc volt-
ages called bias voltages are required at various points. For the amplifier to operate
properly, certain bias voltages must remain constant and, therefore, any ac voltages must be
removed. A sufficiently large capacitor connected from a bias point to ground provides a
low reactance path to ground for ac voltages, leaving the constant dc bias voltage at the
given point. At lower frequencies, the bypass capacitor becomes less effective because of
its increased reactance. This bypass application is illustrated in Figure 56.

 FIGURE 56
Example of the operation of a bypass capacitor. Point A is at ac ground due to the low reactance path

Signal Filters
Capacitors are essential to the operation of a class of circuits called filters that are used for
selecting one ac signal with a certain specified frequency from a wide range of signals with
many different frequencies or for selecting a certain band of frequencies and eliminating all
others. A common example of this application is in radio and television receivers where it
551

CAPACITORS
is necessary to select the signal transmitted from a given station and eliminate or filter out
the signals transmitted from all the other stations in the area.
When you tune your radio or TV, you are actually changing the capacitance in the tuner
circuit (which is a type of filter) so that only the signal from the station or channel you want
passes through to the receiver circuitry. Capacitors are used in conjunction with resistors,
inductors (covered in the next chapter), and other components in these types of filters.
The main characteristic of a filter is its frequency selectivity, which is based on the fact
that the reactance of a capacitor depends on frequency 
Timing Circuits
Another important area in which capacitors are used is in timing circuits that generate spec-
ified time delays or produce waveforms with specific characteristics. Recall that the time
constant of a circuit with resistance and capacitance can be controlled by selecting appro-
priate values for R and C. The charging time of a capacitor can be used as a basic time de-
lay in various types of circuits. An example is the circuit that controls the turn indicators on
your car where the light flashes on and off at regular intervals.
Computer Memories
Dynamic memories in computers use very tiny capacitors as the basic storage element for bi-
nary information, which consists of two binary digits, 1 and 0. A charged capacitor can rep-
resent a stored 1 and a discharged capacitor can represent a stored 0. Patterns of 1s and 0s that
make up binary data are stored in a memory that consists of an array of capacitors with asso-
ciated circuitry. You will study this topic in a computer or digital fundamentals course.

SWITCHED-CAPACITOR CIRCUITS
Another important application of capacitors is in programmable analog arrays, which
are implemented in integrated circuit (IC) form. Switched-capacitors are used to im-
plement various types of programmable analog circuits in which capacitors take the
place of resistors. Capacitors can be implemented on an IC chip more easily than a re-
sistor can, and they offer other advantages such as zero power dissipation. When a re-
sistance is required in a circuit, the switched capacitor can be made to emulate a
resistor. Using switched-capacitor emulation, resistor values can be readily changed by
reprogramming and accurate and stable resistance values can be achieved.

position for one-half of the time period T and that T can be varied by varying the frequency

Application Activity
Capacitors are used in certain types of
amplifiers to couple the ac signal
while blocking the dc voltage. Capaci-
tors are used in many other applica-
tions, but in this application, you will focus on the coupling
capacitors in an amplifier circuit. This topic was introduced in
Section 7. A knowledge of amplifier circuits is not necessary 
for this assignment.
All amplifier circuits contain transistors that require dc volt-
ages to establish proper operating conditions for amplifying ac
signals. These dc voltages are referred to as bias voltages. As in-
dicated in Figure 59(a), a common type of dc bias circuit 
used in amplifiers is the voltage divider formed by 
and 
which sets up the proper dc voltage at the input to the amplifier.
When an ac signal voltage is applied to the amplifier, the in-
put coupling capacitor, 
prevents the internal resistance of the
ac source from changing the dc bias voltage. Without the capaci-
tor, the internal source resistance would appear in parallel with
and drastically change the value of the dc voltage.
The coupling capacitance is chosen so that its reactance 
at the frequency of the ac signal is very small compared to the
bias resistor values. The coupling capacitance therefore effi-
ciently couples the ac signal from the source to the input of the
amplifier. On the source side of the input coupling capacitor
there is only ac but on the amplifier side there is ac plus dc (the
signal voltage is riding on the dc bias voltage set by the voltage
divider), as indicated in Figure 59(a). Capacitor 
is the

output coupling capacitor, which couples the amplified ac signal
to another amplifier stage that would be connected to the output.
You will check three amplifier boards like the one in Figure
59(b) for the proper input voltages using an oscilloscope. If 
the voltages are incorrect, you will determine the most likely
fault. For all measurements, assume the amplifier has no dc
loading effect on the voltage-divider bias circuit.

CAPACITORS
SUMMARY
◆A capacitor is composed of two parallel conducting plates separated by an insulating material
called the dielectric.
◆Energy is stored by a capacitor in the electric field between the plates.
◆One farad is the amount of capacitance when one coulomb of charge is stored with one volt across
the plates.
◆Capacitance is directly proportional to the plate area and inversely proportional to the plate separation.
◆The dielectric constant is an indication of the ability of a material to establish an electric field.
◆The dielectric strength is one factor that determines the breakdown voltage of a capacitor.
◆A capacitor blocks constant dc.
◆The time constant for a series RC circuit is the resistance times the capacitance.
◆In an RC circuit, the voltage and current in a charging or discharging capacitor make a 63% change
during each time-constant interval.
◆Five time constants are required for a capacitor to charge fully or to discharge fully. This is called
the transient time.
◆Charging and discharging follow exponential curves.
◆Total series capacitance is less than that of the smallest capacitor in series.
◆Capacitance adds in parallel.
◆Current leads voltage by 
in a capacitor.
◆Capacitive reactance, 
, is inversely proportional to frequency and capacitance.
◆The total capacitive reactance of series capacitors is the sum of the individual reactances.
◆The total capacitive reactance of parallel capacitors is the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals
of the individual reactances.
◆The true power in a capacitor is zero; that is, no energy is lost in an ideal capacitor due to conver-
sion to heat.

INTRODUCTION
In this chapter, you will learn about a type of basic passive
component, the inductor, and study its characteristics.
The basic construction and electrical properties of induc-
tors are discussed, and the effects of connecting them in se-
ries and in parallel are analyzed. How an inductor works in
both dc and ac circuits is an important part of this coverage
and forms the basis for the study of reactive circuits in terms
of both frequency response and time response. You will also
learn how to check for a faulty inductor.
The inductor, which is basically a coil of wire, is based on
the principle of electromagnetic induction. Inductance is the
property of a coil of wire that opposes a change in current.
The basis for inductance is the electromagnetic field that sur-
rounds any conductor when there is current through it. The
electrical component designed to have the property of induc-
tance is called an inductor, coil, or in certain applications a
choke. All of these terms refer to the same type of device.

Joseph 
Henry
1797–1878
Henry began his career as a
professor at a small school in
Albany, NY, and later became the
first director of the Smithsonian
Institution. He was the first
American since Franklin to
undertake original scientific
experiments. He was the first to
superimpose coils of wire wrapped
on an iron core and first observed
the effects of electromagnetic
induction in 1830, a year before
Faraday, but he did not publish his
findings. Henry did obtain credit
for the discovery of self-induction,
however. The unit of inductance is
named in his honor. (Photo credit:

Institution. Photo number 59,054.)
When a length of wire is formed into a coil, as shown in Figure 1, it becomes an
inductor. The terms coil and inductor are used interchangeably. Current through the coil
produces an electromagnetic field, as illustrated. The magnetic lines of force around each
loop (turn) in the winding of the coil effectively add to the lines of force around the
adjoining loops, forming a strong electromagnetic field within and around the coil. The net
direction of the total electromagnetic field creates a north and a south pole.

THE BASIC INDUCTOR
An inductor is a passive electrical component formed by a coil of wire and which
exhibits the property of inductance.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Describe the basic construction and characteristics of an inductor
◆Define inductance and state its unit
◆Discuss induced voltage
◆Explain how an inductor stores energy
◆Specify how the physical characteristics affect inductance
◆Discuss winding resistance and winding capacitance
◆State Faraday’s law
◆State Lenz’s law
To understand the formation of the total electromagnetic field in a coil, consider the in-
teraction of the electromagnetic fields around two adjacent loops. The magnetic lines of
force around adjacent loops are each deflected into a single outer path when the loops are
brought close together. This effect occurs because the magnetic lines of force are in oppos-
ing directions between adjacent loops and therefore cancel out when the loops are close to-
gether, as illustrated in Figure 2. The total electromagnetic field for the two loops is

depicted in part (b). This effect is additive for many closely adjacent loops in a coil; that is,
each additional loop adds to the strength of the electromagnetic field. For simplicity, only
single lines of force are shown, although there are many. Figure 3 shows a schematic 
symbol for an inductor.
Inductance
When there is current through an inductor, an electromagnetic field is established. When
the current changes, the electromagnetic field also changes. An increase in current expands
the electromagnetic field, and a decrease in current reduces it. Therefore, a changing cur-
rent produces a changing electromagnetic field around the inductor. In turn, the changing
electromagnetic field causes an induced voltage across the coil in a direction to oppose
the change in current. This property is called self-inductance but is usually referred to as
simply inductance, symbolized by L.
Inductance is a measure of a coil’s ability to establish an induced voltage as a re-
sult of a change in its current, and that induced voltage is in a direction to oppose
the change in current.
The inductance (L) of a coil and the time rate of change of the current (
) determine
the induced voltage (
). A change in current causes a change in the electromagnetic field,
which, in turn, induces a voltage across the coil, as you know. The induced voltage is di-
rectly proportional to L and 
, as stated by the following formula:
di/dt
vind
di/dt
Equation 1
This formula indicates that the greater the inductance, the greater the induced voltage.
Also, it shows that the faster the coil current changes (greater 
), the greater the induced
voltage. Notice the similarity of Equation 1 to 
.
The Unit of Inductance
The henry (H) is the basic unit of inductance. By definition, the
inductance of a coil is one henry when current through the coil, changing at the rate of one
ampere per second, induces one volt across the coil. The henry is a large unit, so in practical
applications, millihenries (mH) and microhenries (
) are the more common units.

Determine the induced voltage across a 1 henry (1 H) inductor when the current is
changing at a rate of 2 A/s.
Solution

be induced.

Energy Storage
An inductor stores energy in the electromagnetic field created by the
current. The energy stored is expressed as follows:
Equation 2
As you can see, the energy stored is proportional to the inductance and the square of the
current. When current (I) is in amperes and inductance (L) is in henries, energy (W) is
in joules.

Physical parameters of an inductor.
Physical Characteristics of an Inductor
The following parameters are important in establishing the inductance of a coil: permeability
of the core material, number of turns of wire, core length, and cross-sectional area of the core.
Core Material
As discussed earlier, an inductor is basically a coil of wire that surrounds
a magnetic or nonmagnetic material called the core. Examples of magnetic materials are
iron, nickel, steel, cobalt, or alloys. These materials have permeabilities that are hundreds
or thousands of times greater than that of a vacuum and are classified as ferromagnetic. A
ferromagnetic core provides a better path for the magnetic lines of force and thus permits a
stronger magnetic field. Examples of nonmagnetic materials are air, copper, plastic, and
glass. The permeabilities of these materials are the same as for a vacuum.
The permeability ( ) of the core material determines how easily a magnetic field can
be established, and is measured in 
, which is the same as H/m. The inductance
is directly proportional to the permeability of the core material.
Physical Parameters
As indicated in Figure 4, the number of turns of wire, the 
length, and the cross-sectional area of the core are factors in setting the value of inductance.
The inductance is inversely proportional to the length of the core and directly proportional
to the cross-sectional area. Also, the inductance is directly related to the number of turns
squared. This relationship is as follows:
Wb/At # m

Equation 3
where L is the inductance in henries (H), N is the number of turns of wire, 
is the perme-
ability in henries per meter (H/m), A is the cross-sectional area in meters squared, and l is
the core length in meters (m).

Winding Resistance
When a coil is made of a certain material, for example, insulated copper wire, that wire has
a certain resistance per unit of length. When many turns of wire are used to construct a coil,
the total resistance may be significant. This inherent resistance is called the dc resistance
or the winding resistance (
).
Although this resistance is distributed along the length of the wire, it effectively appears
in series with the inductance of the coil, as shown in Figure 6. In many applications, the
winding resistance may be small enough to be ignored and the coil can be considered an
ideal inductor. In other cases, the resistance must be considered.

Winding Capacitance
When two conductors are placed side by side, there is always some capacitance between
them. Thus, when many turns of wire are placed close together in a coil, a certain amount
of stray capacitance, called winding capacitance (
), is a natural side effect. In many ap-
plications, this winding capacitance is very small and has no significant effect. In other
cases, particularly at high frequencies, it may become quite important.
The equivalent circuit for an inductor with both its winding resistance (
) and its
winding capacitance (
) is shown in Figure 7. The capacitance effectively acts in par-
allel. The total of the stray capacitances between each loop of the wind ing is indicated in
a schematic as a capacitance appearing in parallel with the coil and its winding resistance,
as shown in Figure 7(b).

Be careful when working with
inductors because high induced
voltages can be developed due to a
rapidly changing magnetic field.
This occurs when the current is

changed.

Review of Faraday’s Law
Faraday’s law is reviewed here because of its importance in the study of inductors. Michael
Faraday found that by moving a magnet through a coil of wire, a voltage was induced
across the coil and that when a complete path was provided, the induced voltage caused an
induced current. Faraday observed that
The amount of voltage induced in a coil is directly proportional to the rate of
change of the magnetic field with respect to the coil.
This principle is illustrated in Figure 8, where a bar magnet is moved through a coil of 
wire. An induced voltage is indicated by the voltmeter connected across the coil. The faster
the magnet is moved, the greater the induced voltage.
When a wire is formed into a certain number of loops or turns and is exposed to a chang-
ing magnetic field, a voltage is induced across the coil. The induced voltage is proportional
to the number of turns of wire in the coil, N, and to the rate at which the magnetic field
changes. The rate of change of the magnetic field is designated 
where 
is the mag-
netic flux. The ratio 
is expressed in webers/second (Wb/s). Faraday’s law states that
the induced voltage across a coil is equal to the number of turns (loops) times the rate of
flux change. It is stated here.

a magnetic field that is changing at a rate of 5 Wb/s.

EXAMPLE 3
Lenz’s Law
Lenz’s law is stated here.
When the current through a coil changes, an induced voltage is created as a result
of the changing electromagnetic field and the polarity of the induced voltage is
such that it always opposes the change in current.
Figure 9 illustrates Lenz’s law. In part (a), the current is constant and is limited by R1.
There is no induced voltage because the electromagnetic field is unchanging. In part (b), the

Demonstration of Lenz’s law in an inductive circuit: When the current tries to change suddenly, the
electromagnetic field changes and induces a voltage in a direction that opposes that change in current.
switch suddenly is closed, placing R2 in parallel with R1 and thus reducing the resistance.
Naturally, the current tries to increase and the electromagnetic field begins to expand, but
the induced voltage opposes this attempted increase in current for an instant.
In Figure 9(c), the induced voltage gradually decreases, allowing the current to in-
crease. In part (d), the current has reached a constant value as determined by the parallel re-
sistors, and the induced voltage is zero. In part (e), the switch has been suddenly opened,

allowing the current to decrease back to a value determined by R1. Notice that the induced
voltage has a polarity that opposes any current change. The polarity of the induced voltage
is opposite that of the battery voltage for an increase in current and aids the battery voltage

TYPES OF INDUCTORS
Inductors normally are classified according to the type of core material.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Discuss various types of inductors
◆Describe the basic types of fixed inductors
◆Distinguish between fixed and variable inductors
Inductors are made in a variety of shapes and sizes. Basically, they fall into two general
categories: fixed and variable. The standard schematic symbols are shown in Figure 10.
Both fixed and variable inductors can be classified according to the type of core mate-
rial. Three common types are the air core, the iron core, and the ferrite core. Each has a
unique symbol, as shown in Figure 11.
Adjustable (variable) inductors usually have a screw-type adjustment that moves a slid-

INDUCTORS IN DC CIRCUITS
Energy is stored in the electromagnetic field of an inductor when it is connected to a
dc voltage source. The buildup of current through the inductor occurs in a predictable
manner, which is dependent on the time constant of the circuit. The time constant is
determined by the inductance and the resistance in a circuit.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Analyze inductive dc switching circuits
◆Describe the increase and decrease of current an inductor
◆Define RL time constant
◆Describe induced voltage
◆Write the exponential equations for current in an inductor
When there is constant direct current in an inductor, there is no induced voltage. There
is, however, a voltage drop due to the winding resistance of the coil. The inductance it-
self appears as a short to dc. Energy is stored in the electromagnetic field according to

The RL Time Constant
Because the inductor’s basic action is to develop a voltage that opposes a change in its cur-
rent, it follows that current cannot change instantaneously in an inductor. A certain time is
required for the current to make a change from one value to another. The rate at which the
current changes is determined by the RL time constant.
The RL time constant is a fixed time interval that equals the ratio of the induc-
tance to the resistance.
The formula is

Current in an Inductor
Increasing Current
In a series RL circuit, the current will increase to approximately
63% of its full value in one time-constant interval after voltage is applied. This buildup of
current is analogous to the buildup of capacitor voltage during the charging in an RC cir-
cuit; they both follow an exponential curve and reach the approximate percentages of the
final current as indicated in Table 1 and as illustrated in Figure 19.
The change in current over five time-constant intervals is illustrated in Figure 20. When
the current reaches its final value at 
, it ceases to change. At this time, the inductor acts
as a short (except for winding resistance) to the constant current. The final value of the cur-
rent is

mined by 
because L acts ideally as a short. When the switch is opened, the induced in-
ductor voltage initially provides 10 mA through 
. The current then decreases by 63%
during each time constant interval.
Response to a Square Wave
A good way to demonstrate both increasing and decreasing current in an RL circuit is to use
a square wave voltage as the input. The square wave is a useful signal for observing the dc
response of a circuit because it automatically provides on and off action similar to a switch.
When the square wave goes from its low level to its high level, the current in the circuit 
responds by exponentially rising to its final value. When the square wave returns to the zero
level, the current in the circuit responds by exponentially decreasing to its zero value.
Figure 24 shows input voltage and current waveforms.

the voltage across the resistor and
apply Ohm’s law. If the resistor is
ungrounded, as in Figure 24, 
you can use a difference
measurement to view the resistor
voltage by connecting one
oscilloscope probe across each end

be set to the same VOLTS/DIV
setting. Alternatively, you can
reverse the components (see the

happens to the induced voltage across the inductor in the series circuit in Figure 25
during one complete cycle of a square wave input. Keep in mind that the generator pro-
duces a level that is like switching a dc source on and then puts an “automatic” low resist-
ance (ideally zero) path across the source when it returns to its zero level.

has just transitioned from zero to its maximum value of 2.5 V. In accordance with Lenz’s
law, a voltage is induced across the inductor that opposes this change as the magnetic field
surrounding the inductor builds up. There is no current in the circuit due to the equal but
opposing voltages.
As the magnetic field builds up, the induced voltage across the inductor decreases,
and current is in the circuit. After 
the induced voltage across the inductor has de-
creased by 63%, which causes the current to increase by 63% to 0.158 mA. This is shown
in Figure 25(b) at the end of one time constant (0.1 ms).
The voltage on the inductor continues to exponentially decrease to zero, at which point
the current is limited only by the circuit resistance. Then the square wave goes back to zero
(at 
) as shown in Figure 25(c). Again a voltage is induced across the induc-
tor opposing this change. This time, the polarity of the inductor voltage is reversed due to
the collapsing magnetic field. Although the source voltage is 0, the collapsing magnetic
field maintains current in the same direction until the current decreases to zero, as shown
in Figure 25(d).

INDUCTORS IN AC CIRCUITS
An inductor passes ac with an amount of opposition called inductive reactance that
depends on the frequency of the ac. The concept of the derivative should already be 
familiar to you; the expression for induced voltage in an inductor was stated earlier in
Equation 1. These are used again in this section.

Phase Relationship of Current and Voltage in an Inductor
From Equation 1, the formula for induced voltage, you can see that the faster the cur-
rent through an inductor changes, the greater the induced voltage will be. For example, if

A sinusoidal current always induces a sinusoidal voltage in inductive circuits. There-
fore, you can plot the voltage with respect to the current if you know the points on the cur-
rent curve at which the voltage is zero and those at which it is maximum. This phase
relationship is shown in Figure 30(a). Notice that the voltage leads the current by

Inductive Reactance, XL
Inductive reactance is the opposition to sinusoidal current, expressed in ohms. The sym-
bol for inductive reactance is 
To develop a formula for 
we use the relationship 
and the curves in
Figure 31. The rate of change of current is directly related to frequency. The faster the 
current changes, the higher the frequency. For example, you can see that in Figure 31,
the slope of sine wave A at the zero crossings is steeper than that of sine wave B. Recall
that the slope of a curve at a point indicates the rate of change at that point. Sine wave A has
a higher frequency than sine wave B, as indicated by a greater maximum rate of change

Reactance for Series Inductors
As given in Equation 4, the total inductance of series inductors is the sum of the indi-
vidual inductances. Because reactance is directly proportional to the inductance, the total
reactance of series inductors is the sum of the individual reactances.
Equation 13

INDUCTORS
Notice that Equation 13 has the same form as Equation 4. It also has the same form 
as the formulas for finding the total opposition to current such as the total resistance of
series resistors or the total reactance of series capacitors. When combining the resistance or
reactance of the same type of component in series (resistors, inductors, or capacitors), you
simply add the individual oppositions to obtain the total.
Reactance for Parallel Inductors
In an ac circuit with parallel inductors, Equation 6 was given to find the total induc-
tance. It stated that the total inductance is the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of the
inductors. Likewise, the total inductive reactance is the reciprocal of the sum of the recip-
rocals of the individual reactances.
Equation 14
Notice that Equation 14 has the same form as Equation 6. It also has the same form 
as the formulas for finding the total resistance of parallel resistors or the total reactance of
parallel capacitors. When combining the resistance or reactance of the same type of com-
ponent in parallel (resistors, inductors, or capacitors), you take the reciprocal of the sum of
the reciprocals to obtain the total opposition.
For two inductors in parallel, Equation 14 can be reduced to the product-over-sum 
form. Thus,

Ohm’s Law
The reactance of an inductor is analogous to the resistance of a resistor. In
fact, 
, just like 
and R, is expressed in ohms. Since inductive reactance is a form of op-
position to current, Ohm’s law applies to inductive circuits as well as to resistive circuits
and capacitive circuits; and it is stated as follows for Figure 34.
When applying Ohm’s law in ac circuits, you must express both the current and the volt-
age in the same way, that is, both in rms, both in peak, and so on.

Instantaneous Power (p)
The product of v and i gives instantaneous power. At points
where v or i is zero, p is also zero. When both v and i are positive, p is also positive. When
either v or i is positive and the other negative, p is negative. When both v and i are negative,
p is positive. As you can see in Figure 36, the power follows a sinusoidal-shaped curve.
Positive values of power indicate that energy is stored by the inductor. Negative values of
power indicate that energy is returned from the inductor to the source. Note that the power
fluctuates at a frequency twice that of the voltage or current as energy is alternately stored
and returned to the source.
True Power 
Ideally, all of the energy stored by an inductor during the positive
portion of the power cycle is returned to the source during the negative portion. No net en-
ergy is lost due to conversion to heat in the inductor, so the true power is zero. Actually, be-
cause of winding resistance in a practical inductor, some power is always dissipated; and
there is a very small amount of true power, which can normally be neglected.
(Ptrue)
Power in an Inductor
As discussed earlier, an inductor stores energy in its magnetic field when there is current
through it. An ideal inductor (assuming no winding resistance) does not dissipate energy;
it only stores it. When an ac voltage is applied to an ideal inductor, energy is stored by the
inductor during a portion of the cycle; then the stored energy is returned to the source dur-
ing another portion of the cycle. No net energy is lost in an ideal inductor due to conversion
to heat. Figure 36 shows the power curve that results from one cycle of inductor current 
and voltage.

The rate at which an inductor stores or returns energy is called its

to conversion to heat. The following formulas apply:

The quality factor (Q) is the ratio of the reactive power in an inductor to the true power
in the winding resistance of the coil or the resistance in series with the coil. It is a ratio of
the power in L to the power in 
. The quality factor is important in resonant circuits. A

Noise Suppression
One of the most important applications of inductors has to do with suppressing unwanted
electrical noise. The inductors used in these applications are generally wound on a closed
core to avoid having the inductor become a source of radiated noise itself. Two types of
noise are conductive noise and radiated noise.
Conductive Noise
Many systems have common conductive paths connecting different
parts of the system, which can conduct high frequency noise from one part of the system to
another. Consider the case of two circuits connected with common lines as shown in Figure
38(a). A path for high frequency noise exists though the common grounds, creating a 
condition known as a ground loop. Ground loops are particularly a problem in instrumen-
tation systems, where a transducer may be located a distance from the recording system
and noise current in the ground can affect the signal.
If the signal of interest changes slowly, a special inductor, called a longitudinal choke,
can be installed in the signal line as shown in Figure 38(b). The longitudinal choke is a
form of transformer that acts as inductors in each signal line. The ground loop sees a high
impedance path, thus reducing the noise, while the low-frequency signal is coupled
through the low impedance of the choke.
Switching circuits also tend to generate high-frequency noise (above 10 MHz) 
by virtue of the high-frequency components present. (Recall  that a pulse waveform

INDUCTOR APPLICATIONS
Inductors are not as versatile as capacitors and tend to be more limited in their 
application due, in part, to size, cost factors, and nonideal behavior (internal resist-
ance, etc.). One of the most common applications for inductors is noise reduction 
applications.

contains many high-frequency harmonics). Certain types of power supplies use high-speed
switching circuits that are a source of conductive and radiated noise.
Because an inductor’s impedance increases with frequency, inductors are good for
blocking electrical noise from these supplies, which should carry only dc. Inductors are fre-
quently installed in the power supply lines to suppress this conductive noise, so that one
circuit does not adversely affect another circuit. One or more capacitors may also be used
in conjunction with the inductor to improve filtering action.
Radiated Noise
Noise can also enter a circuit by way of an electromagnetic field. The
noise source can be an adjacent circuit or a nearby power supply. There are several ap-
proaches to reducing the effects of radiated noise. Usually, the first step is to determine the
cause of the noise and isolate it using shielding or filtering.
Inductors are widely employed in filters that are used to suppress radio-frequency noise.
The inductor used for noise suppression must be carefully selected so as not to become a
source of radiated noise itself. For high frequencies(
), inductors wound on highly
permeable toroidal cores are widely used, as they tend to keep the magnetic flux restricted
to the core.
RF Chokes
Inductors used for the purpose of blocking very high frequencies are called radio frequency
(RF) chokes. RF chokes are used for conductive or radiated noise. They are special induc-
tors designed to block high frequencies from getting into or leaving parts of a system by
providing a high impedance path for high frequencies. In general, the choke is placed in se-
ries with the line for which RF suppression is required. Depending on the frequency of the
interference, different types of chokes are required. A common type of electromagnetic in-
terference (EMI) filter wraps the signal line on a toroidal core several times. The toroidal
configuration is desired because it contains the magnetic field so that the choke does not
become a source of noise itself.
Another common type of RF choke is a ferrite bead. All wires have inductance, and the
ferrite bead is a small ferromagnetic material that is strung onto the wire to increase its in-
ductance. The impedance presented by the bead is a function of both the material and the
frequency, as well as the size of the bead. It is an effective and inexpensive “choke” for high
frequencies. Ferrite beads are common in highfrequency communication systems. Some-
times several are strung together in series to increase the effective inductance.
Tuned Circuits
Inductors are used in conjunction with capacitors to provide frequency selection in com-
munications systems. These tuned circuits allow a narrow band of frequencies to be se-
lected while all other frequencies are rejected. The tuners in your TV and radio receivers
are based on this principle and permit you to select one channel or station out of the many
that are available.
Frequency selectivity is based on the fact that the reactances of both capacitors and in-
ductors depend on the frequency and on the interaction of these two components when con-
nected in series or parallel. Since the capacitor and the inductor produce opposite phase
shifts, their combined opposition to current can be used to obtain a desired response at a se-
lected frequency.

Application Activity
In this application, you will see how
you can test coils for their unknown
inductance values using a test setup
consisting of a square wave generator
and an oscilloscope. Two coils for which the inductance values
are not known are tested using simple laboratory instruments to
determine the inductance values. The method is to place the coil
in series with a resistor with a known value and measure the
time constant. Knowing the time constant and the resistance
value, the value of L can be calculated.
The method of determining the time constant is to apply a
square wave to the circuit and measure the resulting voltage
across the resistor. Each time the square wave input voltage
goes high, the inductor is energized and each time the square
wave goes back to zero, the inductor is deenergized. The time
it takes for the exponential resistor voltage to increase to ap-
proximately its final value equals five time constants. This op-
eration is illustrated in Figure 39. To make sure that the
winding resistance of the coil can be neglected, it must be
measured and the value of the resistor used in the circuit must
be selected to be considerably larger than the winding and
source resistances.
The Winding Resistance
Assume that the winding resistance of the coil in Figure 40
has been measured with an ohmmeter and found to be 
. To
make the winding and source resistances negligible for time con-
stant measurement, a 
series resistor is used in the circuit.

SUMMARY
◆Inductance is a measure of a coil’s ability to establish an induced voltage as a result of a change
in its current.
◆An inductor opposes a change in its own current.
◆Faraday’s law states that relative motion between a magnetic field and a coil induces a voltage
across the coil.
◆The amount of induced voltage is directly proportional to the inductance and to the rate of change
in current.
◆Lenz’s law states that the polarity of induced voltage is such that the resulting induced current is
in a direction that opposes the change in the magnetic field that produced it.
◆Energy is stored by an inductor in its magnetic field.
◆One henry is the amount of inductance when current, changing at the rate of one ampere per sec-
ond, induces one volt across the inductor.
◆Inductance is directly proportional to the square of the number of turns, the permeability, and the
cross-sectional area of the core. It is inversely proportional to the length of the core.
◆The permeability of a core material is an indication of the ability of the material to establish a
magnetic field.
◆The time constant for a series RL circuit is the inductance divided by the resistance.
◆In an RL circuit, the increasing or decreasing voltage and current in an inductor make a 63%
change during each time-constant interval.
◆Increasing and decreasing voltages and currents follow exponential curves.
◆Inductors add in series.
◆Total parallel inductance is less than that of the smallest inductor in parallel.
◆Voltage leads current by 
in an inductor.
◆Inductive reactance, 
, is directly proportional to frequency and inductance.
◆The true power in an inductor is zero; that is, no energy is lost in an ideal inductor due to conver-
sion to heat, only in its winding resistance.

INTRODUCTION
An RC circuit contains both resistance and capacitance. In this
chapter, basic series and parallel RC circuits and their
responses to sinusoidal ac voltages are presented. Series-parallel
combinations are also analyzed. True, reactive, and apparent
power in RC circuits are discussed and some basic RC circuit
applications are introduced. Applications of RC circuits in-
clude filters, amplifier coupling, oscillators, and wave-shaping
circuits. Troubleshooting is also covered in this chapter.
Section 1 provides an introduction to complex numbers,
an important tool for the analysis of ac circuits. The complex
number system is a way to mathematically express a phasor
quantity and allows phasor quantities to be added, sub-
tracted, multiplied, and divided.

Positive and Negative Numbers
Positive numbers are represented by points to the right of the origin on the horizontal axis
of a graph, and negative numbers are represented by points to the left of the origin, as il-
lustrated in Figure 1(a). Also, positive numbers are represented by points on the verti-
cal axis above the origin, and negative numbers are represented by points below the origin,
as shown in Figure 1(b).

THE COMPLEX NUMBER SYSTEM
Complex numbers allow mathematical operations with phasor quantities and are useful
in the analysis of ac circuits. With the complex number system, you can add, subtract,
multiply, and divide quantities that have both magnitude and angle, such as sine waves
and other ac circuit quantities. Most scientific calculators can perform operations with
complex numbers. Consult your user’s manual for the exact procedure.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Use complex numbers to express phasor quantities
◆Describe the complex plane
◆Represent a point on the complex plane
◆Discuss real and imaginary numbers
◆Express phasor quantities in both rectangular and polar forms
◆Convert between rectangular and polar forms
◆Do arithmetic operations with complex numbers
The Complex Plane
To distinguish between values on the horizontal axis and values on the vertical axis, a
complex plane is used. In the complex plane, the horizontal axis is called the real axis,
and the vertical axis is called the imaginary axis, as shown in Figure 2. In electrical 
circuit work, a 
prefix is used to designate numbers that lie on the imaginary axis in
order to distinguish them from numbers lying on the real axis. This prefix is known as the j

Representing a Point on the Complex Plane
A point located on the complex
plane is classified as real, imaginary

as shown in part (b). A point on the 
axis 6 units
from the origin, as shown in part (c), is the positive imaginary number, 
Finally,
a point 5 units along the

as shown in
part (d).
When a point lies not on any axis but somewhere in one of the four quadrants, it is a
complex number and is defined by its coordinates. For example, in Figure 5, the point 
located in the first quadrant has a real value of

Rectangular and Polar Forms
Rectangular and polar are two forms of complex numbers that are used to represent phasor
quantities. Each has certain advantages when used in circuit analysis, depending on the
particular application. A phasor quantity contains both magnitude and angular position or
phase. In this text, italic letters such as V and I are used to represent magnitude only, and
boldfaced nonitalic letters such as V and I are used to represent complete phasor quantities.
Rectangular Form
A phasor quantity is represented in rectangular form by the alge-
braic sum of the real value (A) of the coordinate and the j value (B) of the coordinate, ex-
pressed in the following general form:
Examples of phasor quantities are 
and 
which are
shown on the complex plane in Figure 9. As you can see, the rectangular coordinates 
describe the phasor in terms of its values projected onto the real axis and the j axis. An 
“arrow” drawn from the origin to the coordinate point in the complex plane represents
graphically the phasor quantity.

Conversion from Rectangular to Polar Form
A phasor can exist in any of the four
quadrants of the complex plane, as indicated in Figure 11. The phase angle 
in each 
case is measured relative to the positive real axis 
and 
(phi) is the angle in the 2nd

The first step to convert from rectangular form to polar form is to determine the magni-
tude of the phasor. A phasor can be visualized as forming a right triangle in the complex
plane, as indicated in Figure 12, for each quadrant location. The horizontal side of the 
triangle is the real value, A, and the vertical side is the j value, B. The hypotenuse of the
triangle is the length of the phasor, C, representing the magnitude, and can be expressed,
using the Pythagorean theorem, as
C = 2A2 + B2

SINUSOIDAL RESPONSE OF SERIES RC CIRCUITS
When a sinusoidal voltage is applied to a series RC circuit, each resulting voltage drop
and the current in the circuit are also sinusoidal and have the same frequency as the
applied voltage. The capacitance causes a phase shift between the voltage and current
that depends on the relative values of the resistance and the capacitive reactance.

As shown in Figure 14, the resistor voltage 
the capacitor voltage 
and the 
current (I) are all sine waves with the frequency of the source. Phase shifts are introduced
because of the capacitance. The resistor voltage and current lead the source voltage, and
the capacitor voltage lags the source voltage. The phase angle between the current and the

is 
with the current leading the voltage. When there is a combination of both resistance

IMPEDANCE OF SERIES RC CIRCUITS
Impedance is the total opposition to sinusoidal current. Its unit is the ohm. The 
impedance of a series RC circuit consists of resistance and capacitive reactance. It

Phase Relationships of Current and Voltages
In a series RC circuit, the current is the same through both the resistor and the capacitor.
Thus, the resistor voltage is in phase with the current, and the capacitor voltage lags the
current by 
Therefore, there is a phase difference of 
between the resistor voltage,
and the capacitor voltage,

Since the resistor voltage and the current are in phase, also represents the phase angle

current phasor diagram that represents the waveform diagram of Figure 23.
Variation of Impedance and Phase Angle with Frequency
As you know, capacitive reactance varies inversely with frequency. Since 
you can see that when 
increases, the entire term under the square root sign increases and
thus the magnitude of the total impedance also increases; and when 
decreases, the mag-
nitude of the total impedance also decreases. Therefore, in a series RC circuit, Z is in-
versely dependent on frequency.
Figure 26 illustrates how the voltages and current in a series RC circuit vary as the 
frequency increases or decreases, with the source voltage held at a constant value. In part
(a), as the frequency is increased, 
decreases; so less voltage is dropped across the ca-
pacitor. Also, Z decreases as 
decreases, causing the current to increase. An increase in
the current causes more voltage across R.
In Figure 26(b), as the frequency is decreased, 
increases; so more voltage is 
dropped across the capacitor. Also, Z increases as 
increases, causing the current to de-
crease. A decrease in the current causes less voltage across R.
Changes in Z and 
can be observed as shown in Figure 27. As the frequency in-
creases, the voltage across Z remains constant because 
is constant. Also, the voltage
across C decreases. The increasing current indicates that Z is decreasing. It does so be-
cause of the inverse relationship stated in Ohm’s law 
The increasing current
also indicates that 
is decreasing 
The decrease in 
corresponds to the

Phase Difference Between Input and Output
In a series RC circuit, the current leads

the output voltage is taken across the resistor, the output leads the input, as indicated by the
phasor diagram in Figure 34(b). The waveforms are shown in Figure 34(c).

of the resistance and the capacitive reactance. When the input voltage is assigned a refer-
ence angle of

Conversion from Parallel to Series Form
For every parallel RC circuit, there is an equivalent series RC circuit for a given frequency.
Two circuits are considered equivalent when they both present an equal impedance at their
terminals; that is, the magnitude of impedance and the phase angle are identical.

To obtain the equivalent series circuit for a given parallel RC circuit, first find the im-
pedance and phase angle of the parallel circuit. Then use the values of Z and to construct
an impedance triangle, shown in Figure 48. The vertical and horizontal sides of the trian-
gle represent the equivalent series resistance and capacitive reactance as indicated. These

ANALYSIS OF SERIES-PARALLEL RC CIRCUITS
The concepts studied with respect to series and parallel circuits are used to analyze
circuits with combinations of both series and parallel R and C components.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Analyze series-parallel RC circuits
◆Determine total impedance
◆Calculate currents and voltages
◆Measure impedance and phase angle
The impedance of series components is most easily expressed in rectangular form, and
the impedance of parallel components is best found by using polar form. The steps for an-
alyzing a circuit with a series and a parallel component are illustrated in Example 21. 
First express the impedance of the series part of the circuit in rectangular form and the im-
pedance of the parallel part in polar form. Next, convert the impedance of the parallel part
to rectangular form and add it to the impedance of the series part. Once you determine the
rectangular form of the total impedance, you can convert it to polar form in order to see the
magnitude and phase angle and to calculate the current.

express each branch impedance in rectangular form and then convert each of these imped-
ances to polar form. Next, calculate each branch current using polar notation. Once you

in rectangular form. In this particular case, the total impedance is not required.

Measurement of Ztot
Now, let’s see how the value of 
for the circuit in Example 21 can be determined by
measurement. First, the total impedance is measured as outlined in the following steps and
as illustrated in Figure 54 (other ways are also possible):
Step 1: Using a sine wave generator, set the source voltage to a known value (10 V) and
the frequency to 5 kHz. If your generator is not accurate, then it is advisable to
check the voltage with an ac voltmeter and the frequency with a frequency
counter rather than relying on the marked values on the generator controls.

RC CIRCUITS
Step 2: Connect an ac ammeter as shown in Figure 54, and measure the total cur-
rent. Alternatively, you can measure the voltage across 
with a voltmeter and
calculate the current.
Step 3: Calculate the total impedance by using Ohm’s law.
Measurement of Phase Angle, 
To measure the phase angle, the source voltage and the total current must be displayed on an
oscilloscope screen in the proper time relationship. Two basic types of scope probes are
available to measure the quantities with an oscilloscope: the voltage probe and the current
probe. The current probe is a convenient device, but it is often not as readily available as a
voltage probe. We will confine our phase measurement technique to the use of voltage
probes in conjunction with the oscilloscope. Although there are special isolation methods, a
typical oscilloscope voltage probe has two points that are connected to the circuit: the probe
tip and the ground lead. Thus, all voltage measurements must be referenced to ground.
Since only voltage probes are to be used, the total current cannot be measured directly.
However, for phase measurement, the voltage across 
is in phase with the total current
and can be used to establish the phase angle of the current.
Before proceeding with the actual phase measurement, there is a problem with display-
ing 
If the scope probe is connected across the resistor, as indicated in Figure 55(a), 
the ground lead of the scope will short point B to ground, thus bypassing the rest of the
components and effectively removing them from the circuit electrically, as illustrated in
Figure 55(b) (assuming that the scope is not isolated from power line ground).
To avoid this problem, you can switch the generator output terminals so that one end of
is connected to the ground terminal, as shown in Figure 56(a). Now the scope can be
connected across it to display 
as indicated in Figure 56(b). The other probe is con-
nected across the voltage source to display 
as indicated. Now channel 1 of the scope has
as an input, and channel 2 has 
The scope should be triggered from the source volt-
age (channel 2 in this case).
Before connecting the probes to the circuit, you should align the two horizontal lines
(traces) so that they appear as a single line across the center of the scope screen. To do
so, ground the probe tips and adjust the vertical position knobs to move the traces toward
the center line of the screen until they are superimposed. This procedure ensures that
both waveforms have the same zero crossing so that an accurate phase measurement can
be made.

Once you have stabilized the waveforms on the scope screen, you can measure the pe-
riod of the source voltage. Next, use the Volts/Div controls to adjust the amplitudes of the
waveforms until they both appear to have the same amplitude. Now, spread the waveforms
horizontally by using the Sec/Div control to expand the distance between them. This hori-
zontal distance represents the time between the two waveforms. The number of divisions
between the waveforms along any horizontal lines times the Sec/Div setting is equal to the
time between them,

POWER IN RC CIRCUITS
In a purely resistive ac circuit, all of the energy delivered by the source is dissipated in
the form of heat by the resistance. In a purely capacitive ac circuit, all of the energy
delivered by the source is stored by the capacitor during a portion of the voltage cycle
and then returned to the source during another portion of the cycle so that there is no
net energy conversion to heat. When there is both resistance and capacitance, some of
the energy is alternately stored and returned by the capacitance and some is dissipated
by the resistance. The amount of energy converted to heat is determined by the relative
values of the resistance and the capacitive reactance.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Determine power in RC circuits
◆Explain true and reactive power
◆Draw the power triangle
◆Define power factor
◆Explain apparent power
◆Calculate power in an RC circuit
When the resistance in a series RC circuit is greater than the capacitive reactance, more
of the total energy delivered by the source is converted to heat by the resistance than is
stored by the capacitor. Likewise, when the reactance is greater than the resistance, more of
the total energy is stored and returned than is converted to heat.
The formulas for power in a resistor, sometimes called true power
and the power
in a capacitor, called reactive power
are restated here. The unit of true power is the
watt, and the unit of reactive power is the VAR (volt-ampere reactive).

As the phase angle between applied voltage and total current increases, the power fac-
tor decreases, indicating an increasingly reactive circuit. The smaller the power factor, the
smaller the power dissipation.
The power factor can vary from 0 for a purely reactive circuit to 1 for a purely resistive
circuit. In an RC circuit, the power factor is referred to as a leading power factor because
the current leads the voltage.

Significance of Apparent Power
As mentioned, apparent power is the power that appears to be transferred between the
source and the load, and it consists of two components—a true power component and a
reactive power component.
In all electrical and electronic systems, it is the true power that does the work. The reac-
tive power is simply shuttled back and forth between the source and load. Ideally, in terms
of performing useful work, all of the power transferred to the load should be true power and
none of it reactive power. However, in most practical situations the load has some reactance
associated with it, and therefore you must deal with both power components.
For any reactive load, there are two components of the total current: the resistive com-
ponent and the reactive component. If you consider only the true power (watts) in a load,
you are dealing with only a portion of the total current that the load demands from a source.
In order to have a realistic picture of the actual current that a load will draw, you must con-
sider apparent power (VA).
A source such as an ac generator can provide current to a load up to some maximum
value. If the load draws more than this maximum value, the source can be damaged. Figure
60(a) shows a 120 V generator that can deliver a maximum current of 5 A to a load. As-

The Phase Shift Oscillator
As you know, a series RC circuit will shift the phase of the output voltage by an amount that
depends on the values of R and C and the frequency of the signal. This ability to shift phase
depending on frequency is vital in certain feedback oscillator circuits. An oscillator is a
circuit that generates a periodic waveform and is an important circuit for many electronic
systems. You will study oscillators in a devices course, so the focus here is on the applica-
tion of RC circuits for shifting phase. The requirement is that a fraction of the output of the
oscillator is returned to the input (called “feedback”) in the proper phase to reinforce the
input and sustain oscillations. Generally, the requirement is to feed back the signal with a
total of 
of phase shift.
A single RC circuit is limited to phase shifts that are smaller than 
The basic RC lag
circuit discussed in Section 4 can be “stacked” to form a complex RC network as shown

phase shift at a certain frequency, which will be the frequency at which the oscillator

works. The output of the amplifier is phase shifted by the RC network and returned to the
input of the amplifier, which provides sufficient gain to maintain oscillations.
The process of putting several RC circuits together results in a loading effect, so the
overall phase shift is not the same as simply adding the phase shifts of the individual RC
circuits. With equal components, the frequency at which a

RC CIRCUITS
The RC Circuit as a Filter
Filters are frequency-selective circuits that permit signals of certain frequencies to pass
from the input to the output while blocking all others. That is, all frequencies but the se-
lected ones are filtered out. Filters are introduced here as an application example.
Series RC circuits exhibit a frequency-selective characteristic and therefore act as basic fil-
ters. There are two types. The first one that we examine, called a low-pass filter, is realized
by taking the output across the capacitor, just as in a lag circuit. The second type, called a
high-pass filter, is implemented by taking the output across the resistor, as in a lead circuit.
Low-Pass Filter
You have already seen what happens to the output magnitude and phase
angle in a lag circuit. In terms of its filtering action, we are interested primarily in the vari-
ation of the output magnitude with frequency.
Figure 64 shows the filtering action of a series RC circuit using specific values for 
illustration. In part (a) of the figure, the input is zero frequency (dc). Since the capacitor
blocks constant direct current, the output voltage equals the full value of the input voltage
because there is no voltage dropped across R. Therefore, the circuit passes all of the input
voltage to the output (10 V in, 10 V out).
In Figure 64(b), the frequency of the input voltage has been increased to 1 kHz, 
causing the capacitive reactance to decrease to

output voltage is approximately 8.5 V rms, which can be calculated using the voltage-
divider approach or Ohm’s law.
In Figure 64(c), the input frequency has been increased to 10 kHz, causing the ca-
pacitive reactance to decrease further to 
For a constant input voltage of 10 V rms,
the output voltage is now 1.57 V rms.
As the input frequency is increased further, the output voltage continues to decrease and
approaches zero as the frequency becomes very high, as shown in Figure 64(d).
A description of the circuit action is as follows: As the frequency of the input increases,
the capacitive reactance decreases. Because the resistance is constant and the capacitive re-
actance decreases, the voltage across the capacitor (output voltage) also decreases accord-
ing to the voltage-divider principle. The input frequency can be increased until it reaches a
value at which the reactance is so small compared to the resistance that the output voltage
can be neglected because it is very small compared to the input voltage. At this value of fre-
quency, the circuit is essentially completely blocking the input signal.
As shown in Figure 64, the circuit passes dc (zero frequency) completely. As the fre-
quency of the input increases, less of the input voltage is passed through to the output; that
is, the output voltage decreases as the frequency increases. It is apparent that the lower fre-
quencies pass through the circuit much better than the higher frequencies. This RC circuit
is therefore a very basic form of low-pass filter.
The frequency response of the low-pass filter circuit in Figure 64 is shown in 
Figure 65 with a graph of output voltage magnitude versus frequency. This graph, 
called a response curve, indicates that the output decreases as the frequency increases.

High-Pass Filter
Figure 66 illustrates high-pass filtering action, where the output is
taken across the resistor, just as in a lead circuit. When the input voltage is dc (zero fre-
quency) in part (a), the output is zero volts because the capacitor blocks direct current;
therefore, no voltage is developed across R.
In Figure 66(b), the frequency of the input signal has been increased to 100 Hz with 
an rms value of 10 V. The output voltage is 0.63 V rms. Thus, only a small percentage of
the input voltage appears on the output at this frequency.
In Figure 66(c), the input frequency is increased further to 1 kHz, causing more volt-
age to be developed across the resistor because of the further decrease in the capacitive re-
actance. The output voltage at this frequency is 5.32 V rms. As you can see, the output
663

RC CIRCUITS
voltage increases as the frequency increases. A value of frequency is reached at which the
reactance is negligible compared to the resistance, and most of the input voltage appears
across the resistor, as shown in Figure 66(d).
As illustrated, this circuit tends to prevent lower frequencies from appearing on the out-
put but allows higher frequencies to pass through from input to output. Therefore, this RC
circuit is a basic form of high-pass filter.
The frequency response of the high-pass filter circuit in Figure 66 is shown in Figure 
67 with a graph of output voltage magnitude versus frequency. This response curve 
shows that the output increases as the frequency increases and then levels off and
approaches the value of the input voltage.
The Cutoff Frequency and the Bandwidth of a Filter

pacitive reactance equals the resistance in a low-pass or high-pass RC filter is called the
cutoff frequency and is designated

are considered to be passed by the filter, and all those below 
are considered to be re-
jected. The reverse is true for a low-pass filter.
The range of frequencies that is considered to be passed by a filter is called the
bandwidth. Figure 68 illustrates the bandwidth and the cutoff frequency for a low-pass 
filter.
Coupling an AC Signal into a DC Bias Circuit
Figure 69 shows an RC circuit that is used to create a dc voltage level with an ac volt-
age superimposed on it. This type of circuit is commonly found in amplifiers in which the
dc voltage is required to bias the amplifier to the proper operating point and the signal volt-
age to be amplified is coupled through a capacitor and superimposed on the dc level. The
capacitor prevents the low internal resistance of the signal source from affecting the dc bias
voltage.

In this type of application, a relatively large value of capacitance is selected so that for
the frequencies to be amplified, the reactance is very small compared to the resistance of
the bias network. When the reactance is very small (ideally zero), there is practically no
phase shift or signal voltage dropped across the capacitor. Therefore, all of the signal volt-
age passes from the source to the input of the amplifier.

Effect of an Open Resistor

a basic series RC circuit, as shown in Figure 71. Obviously, there is no path for current,

Other Troubleshooting Considerations
So far, you have learned about specific component failures and the associated voltage
measurements. Many times, however, the failure of a circuit to work properly is not the re-
sult of a faulty component. A loose wire, a bad contact, or a poor solder joint can cause an
open circuit. A short can be caused by a wire clipping or solder splash. Things as simple as
not plugging in a power supply or a function generator happen more often than you might
think. Wrong values in a circuit (such as an incorrect resistor value), the function generator
set at the wrong frequency, or the wrong output connected to the circuit can cause improper
operation.
When you have problems with a circuit, always check to make sure that the instruments
are properly connected to the circuits and to a power outlet. Also, look for obvious things
such as a broken or loose contact, a connector that is not completely plugged in, or a piece
of wire or a solder bridge that could be shorting something out.
The point is that you should consider all possibilities, not just faulty components, when
a circuit is not working properly. The following example illustrates this approach with a
simple circuit using the APM (analysis, planning, and measurement) method.
The circuit represented by the schematic in Figure 76 has no output voltage, which 
is the voltage across the capacitor. You expect to see about 7.4 V at the output. The cir-
cuit is physically constructed on a protoboard. Use your troubleshooting skills to find
the problem.

Solution
Apply the APM method to this troubleshooting problem.
Analysis: First think of the possible causes for the circuit to have no output voltage.
1. There is no source voltage or the frequency is so high that the capacitive reactance
is almost zero.
669

RC CIRCUITS
2. There is a short between the output terminals. Either the capacitor could be inter-
nally shorted, or there could be some physical short in the circuit.
3. There is an open between the source and the output. This would prevent current
and thus cause the output voltage to be zero. The resistor could be open, or the
conductive path could be open due to a broken or loose connecting wire or a bad
protoboard contact.
4. There is an incorrect component value. The resistor could be so large that the cur-
rent and, therefore, the output voltage are negligible. The capacitor could be so
large that its reactance at the input frequency is near zero.
Planning: You decide to make some visual checks for problems such as the function
generator power cord not plugged in or the frequency set at an incorrect value. Also,
broken leads, shorted leads, as well as an incorrect resistor color code or capacitor la-
bel often can be found visually. If nothing is discovered after a visual check, then you
will make voltage measurements to track down the cause of the problem. You decide
to use a digital oscilloscope and a DMM to make the measurements.
Measurement: Assume that you find that the function generator is plugged in and the
frequency setting appears to be correct. Also, you find no visible opens or shorts dur-
ing your visual check, and the component values are correct.
The first step in the measurement process is to check the voltage from the source
with the scope. Assume a 10 V rms sine wave with a frequency of 5 kHz is observed at
the circuit input as shown in Figure 77(a). The correct voltage is present, so the 
first possible cause has been eliminated.
Next, check for a shorted capacitor by disconnecting the source and placing a
DMM (set on the ohmmeter function) across the capacitor. If the capacitor is good, an
open will be indicated by an OL (overload) in the meter display after a short charging
time. Assume the capacitor checks okay, as shown in Figure 77(b). The second 
possible cause has been eliminated.
Since the voltage has been “lost” somewhere between the input and the output, you
must now look for the voltage. Reconnect the source and measure the voltage across
the resistor with the DMM (set on the voltmeter function) from one resistor lead to the
other. The voltage across the resistor is zero. This means there is no current, which in-
dicates an open somewhere in the circuit.
Now, begin tracing the circuit back toward the source looking for the voltage
(you could also start from the source and work forward). You can use either the
scope or the DMM but decide to use the multimeter with one lead connected to
ground and the other used to probe the circuit. As shown in Figure 77(c), the 
voltage on the right lead of the resistor, point 1, reads zero. Since you already
have measured zero voltage across the resistor, the voltage on the left resistor lead
at point 2 must be zero as the meter indicates. Next, moving the meter probe to
point 3, you read 10 V. You have found the voltage! Since there is zero volts on
the left resistor lead, and there is 10 V at point 3, one of the two contacts in the
protoboard hole into which the wire leads are inserted is bad. It could be that the
small contacts were pushed in too far and were bent or broken so that the circuit
lead does not make contact.
Move either or both the resistor lead and the wire to another hole in the same row.
Assume that when the resistor lead is moved to the hole just above, you have voltage
at the output of the circuit (across the capacitor).

RC CIRCUITS
Application Activity
In this application, the output voltage
and phase lag of an amplifier’s input
circuit are examined to determine how
they change with frequency. If too
much voltage is dropped across the coupling capacitor, the over-
all performance of the amplifier is adversely affected.
The coupling capacitor 
in Figure 78 passes the input 
signal voltage to the input of the amplifier (point A to point B)
without affecting the dc level at point B produced by the resistive
voltage divider 
and 
If the input frequency is high enough
so that the reactance of the coupling capacitor is negligibly small,
essentially no ac signal voltage is dropped across the capacitor.
R2).
(R1
(C1)
As the signal frequency is reduced, the capacitive reactance 
increases and more of the signal voltage is dropped across the 
capacitor. This lowers the overall voltage gain of the amplifier
and thus degrades its performance.
The amount of signal voltage that is coupled from the input
source (point A) to the amplifier input (point B) is determined
by the values of the capacitor and the dc bias resistors (assuming
the amplifier has no loading effect) in Figure 78. These com-
ponents actually form a high-pass RC filter, as shown in Figure
79. The voltage-divider bias resistors are effectively in paral-
lel with each other as far as the ac source is concerned because
the power supply has zero internal resistance. The lower end of

goes to the dc supply

INTRODUCTION
In this chapter you will study series and parallel RL circuits.
The analyses of RL and RC circuits are similar. The major dif-
ference is that the phase responses are opposite; inductive
reactance increases with frequency, while capacitive reac-
tance decreases with frequency.
An RL circuit contains both resistance and inductance. In
this chapter, basic series and parallel RL circuits and their 
responses to sinusoidal ac voltages are presented. Series-
parallel combinations are also analyzed. True, reactive, and
apparent power in RL circuits are discussed and some basic
RL circuit applications are introduced. Applications of RL cir-
cuits include filters and switching regulators. Troubleshooting
is also covered in this chapter.

SERIES CIRCUITS

SINUSOIDAL RESPONSE OF SERIES RL CIRCUITS
As with the RC circuit, all currents and voltages in a series RL circuit are sinusoidal
when the input voltage is sinusoidal. The inductance causes a phase shift between the
voltage and the current that depends on the relative values of the resistance and the 
inductive reactance.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Describe the relationship between current and voltage in a series RL circuit
◆Discuss voltage and current waveforms
◆Discuss phase shift
In an RL circuit, the resistor voltage and the current lag the source voltage. The inductor
voltage leads the source voltage. Ideally, the phase angle between the current and the in-
ductor voltage is always 90°. These generalized phase relationships are indicated in Figure
1. Notice how they differ from those of the RC circuit.
The amplitudes and the phase relationships of the voltages and current depend on the
values of the resistance and the inductive reactance. When a circuit is purely inductive, the
phase angle between the applied voltage and the total current is 90°, with the current lag-
ging the voltage. When there is a combination of both resistance and inductive reactance in
a circuit, the phase angle is somewhere between 0° and 90°, depending on the relative val-
ues of the resistance and the inductive reactance.
Recall that practical inductors have winding resistance, capacitance between windings,
and other factors that prevent an inductor from behaving as an ideal component. In practical

IMPEDANCE OF SERIES RL CIRCUITS
The impedance of a series RL circuit consists of resistance and inductive reactance and
is the total opposition to sinusoidal current. Its unit is the ohm. The impedance also
results in a phase difference between the total current and the source voltage. There-
fore, the impedance consists of a magnitude component and a phase angle component
and is represented as a phasor quantity.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Determine the impedance of a series RL circuit
◆Express inductive reactance in complex form
◆Express total impedance in complex form
◆Calculate impedance magnitude and the phase angle
The impedance of a series RL circuit is determined by the resistance and the inductive
reactance. Inductive reactance is expressed as a phasor quantity in rectangular form as
In the series RL circuit of Figure 2, the total impedance is the phasor sum of R and 
and is expressed as
jXL
XL = jXL
Equation 1
Z = R + jXL
In ac analysis, both R and 
are as shown in the phasor diagram of Figure 3(a), with 
appearing at a 
angle with respect to R. This relationship comes from the fact that
the inductor voltage leads the current, and thus the resistor voltage, by 90°. Since Z is the
phasor sum of R and 
its phasor representation is as shown in Figure 3(b). A repo-
sitioning of the phasors, as shown in part (c), forms a right triangle called the impedance
triangle. The length of each phasor represents the magnitude of the quantity, and 
is the
phase angle between the applied voltage and the current in the RL circuit.

RL CIRCUITS
Ohm’s Law
The application of Ohm’s law to series RL circuits involves the use of the phasor quantities
of Z, V, and I. The three equivalent forms of Ohm’s law apply to RL circuits:
Recall that since Ohm’s law calculations involve multiplication and division operations,
you should express the voltage, current, and impedance in polar form.

Phase Relationships of Current and Voltages
In a series RL circuit, the current is the same through both the resistor and the inductor.
Thus, the resistor voltage is in phase with the current, and the inductor voltage leads the
current by 90°. Therefore, there is a phase difference of 90° between the resistor voltage,
and the inductor voltage,
as shown in the waveform diagram of Figure 7.

Since the resistor voltage and the current are in phase,
is also the phase angle between
the source voltage and the current. Figure 9 shows a voltage and current phasor diagram
that represents the waveform diagram of Figure 7.
Variation of Impedance and Phase Angle with Frequency
The impedance triangle is useful in visualizing how the frequency of the applied voltage af-
fects the RL circuit response. As you know, inductive reactance varies directly with fre-
quency. When 
increases, the magnitude of the total impedance also increases; and when 
decreases, the magnitude of the total impedance decreases. Thus, Z is directly dependent on
frequency. The phase angle also varies directly with frequency because 
As
increases with frequency, so does 
and vice versa.
The impedance triangle is used in Figure 10 to illustrate the variations in 
Z, and 
as the frequency changes. Of course, R remains constant. The main point is that because
varies directly with the frequency, so also do the magnitude of the total impedance and
the phase angle. Example 3 illustrates this.

The RL Lag Circuit
An RL lag circuit is a phase shift circuit in which the output voltage lags the input voltage
by a specified amount. When the output of a series RL circuit is taken across the resistor
rather than the inductor, as shown in Figure 16(a), it becomes a lag circuit.
703

RL CIRCUITS
Phase Difference Between Input and Output
In a series RL circuit, the current lags
the input voltage. Since the output voltage is taken across the resistor, the output lags the
input, as indicated by the phasor diagram in Figure 16(b). The waveforms are shown in
Figure 16(c).
As in the lead circuit, the amount of phase difference between the input and output and
the magnitude of the output voltage in the lag circuit are dependent on the relative values
of the resistance and the inductive reactance. When the input voltage is assigned a reference
angle of 0°, the angle of the output voltage 
with respect to the input voltage equals 
because the resistor voltage (output) and the current are in phase with each other. The ex-

RL CIRCUITS
Conductance, Susceptance, and Admittance
Conductance (G) is the reciprocal of resistance, susceptance (B) is the reciprocal of reactance,
and admittance (Y) is the reciprocal of impedance.
For parallel RL circuits, the phasor expression for inductive susceptance (BL) is
and the phasor expression for admittance is

SERIES-PARALLEL CIRCUITS
The impedance of series components is most easily expressed in rectangular form and
that the impedance of parallel components is best found by using polar form. The steps for
analyzing a circuit with a series and a parallel component are illustrated in Example 12.
First express the impedance of the series part of the circuit in rectangular form and the
impedance of the parallel part in polar form. Next, convert the impedance of the parallel
part to rectangular form and add it to the impedance of the series part. Once you determine
the rectangular form of the total impedance, you can convert it to polar form in order to see
the magnitude and phase angle and to calculate the current.

SPECIAL TOPICS
When the resistance in a series RL circuit is greater than the inductive reactance, more
of the total energy delivered by the source is converted to heat by the resistance than is
stored by the inductor. Likewise, when the reactance is greater than the resistance, more of
the total energy is stored and returned than is converted to heat.
As you know, the power dissipation in a resistance is called the true power. The power
in an inductor is reactive power and is expressed as
7
POWER IN RL CIRCUITS
In a purely resistive ac circuit, all of the energy delivered by the source is dissipated in the
form of heat by the resistance. In a purely inductive ac circuit, all of the energy delivered
by the source is stored by the inductor in its magnetic field during a portion of the voltage
cycle and then returned to the source during another portion of the cycle so that there is
no net energy conversion to heat. When there is both resistance and inductance, some 
of the energy is alternately stored and returned by the inductance and some is dissipated
by the resistance. The amount of energy converted to heat is determined by the relative
values of the resistance and the inductive reactance.

Significance of the Power Factor
The power factor (PF) is important in determining how much useful power (true power) is
transferred to a load. The highest power factor is 1, which indicates that all of the current
719

RL CIRCUITS
to a load is in phase with the voltage (resistive). When the power factor is 0, all of the cur-
rent to a load is 90° out of phase with the voltage (reactive).
Generally, a power factor as close to 1 as possible is desirable because then most of the
power transferred from the source to the load is the useful or true power. True power goes
only one way—from source to load—and performs work on the load in terms of energy
dissipation. Reactive power simply goes back and forth between the source and the load
with no net work being done. Energy must be used in order for work to be done.
Many practical loads have inductance as a result of their particular function, and it is
essential for their proper operation. Examples are transformers, electric motors, and speak-
ers, to name a few. Therefore, inductive (and capacitive) loads are important considerations.
To see the effect of the power factor on system requirements, refer to Figure 36. This fig-
ure shows a representation of a typical inductive load consisting effectively of inductance
and resistance in parallel. Part (a) shows a load with a relatively low power factor (0.75),
and part (b) shows a load with a relatively high power factor (0.95). Both loads dissipate
equal amounts of power as indicated by the wattmeters. Thus, an equal amount of work is
done on both loads.

power (watts).

 FIGURE 36
Illustration of the effect of the power factor on system requirements such as source rating (VA) and
conductor size.
Although both loads are equivalent in terms of the amount of work done (true power),
the low power factor load in Figure 36(a) draws more current from the source than does 
the high power factor load in Figure 36(b), as indicated by the ammeters. Therefore, the
source in part (a) must have a higher VA rating than the one in part (b). Also, the lines con-
necting the source to the load in part (a) must be a larger wire gauge than those in part (b),
a condition that becomes significant when very long transmission lines are required, such
as in power distribution.
Figure 36 has demonstrated that a higher power factor is an advantage in delivering
power more efficiently to a load.
Power Factor Correction
The power factor of an inductive load can be increased by the addition of a capacitor in par-
allel, as shown in Figure 37. The capacitor compensates for the phase lag of the total 
current by creating a capacitive component of current that is 180° out of phase with the in-
ductive component. This has a canceling effect and reduces the phase angle and the total
current and increases the power factor, as illustrated in the figure.

RL CIRCUITS
The RL Circuit as a Filter
As with RC circuits, series RL circuits also exhibit a frequency-selective characteristic and
therefore act as basic filters.
Low-Pass Filter
You have seen what happens to the output magnitude and phase angle in
a lag circuit. In terms of the filtering action, the variation of the magnitude of the output
voltage as a function of frequency is important.
Figure 38 shows the filtering action of a series RL circuit using specific values for 
purposes of illustration. In part (a) of the figure, the input is zero frequency (dc). Since the
inductor ideally acts as a short to constant direct current, the output voltage equals the full
value of the input voltage (neglecting the winding resistance). Therefore, the circuit passes
all of the input voltage to the output (10 V in, 10 V out).
In Figure 38(b), the frequency of the input voltage has been increased to 1 kHz,
causing the inductive reactance to increase to 
For an input voltage of 10 V rms,
the output voltage is approximately 8.47 V rms, which can be calculated using the voltage-
divider approach or Ohm’s law.

BASIC APPLICATIONS
Two applications of RL circuits are covered in this section. The first application is a
basic frequency selective (filter) circuit. The second application is the switching regu-
lator, a widely used circuit in power supplies because of its high efficiency. The
switching regulator uses other components, but the RL circuit is emphasized.

RL CIRCUITS
In Figure 38(c), the input frequency has been increased to 10 kHz, causing the in-
ductive reactance to increase further to 
For a constant input voltage of 10 V rms,
the output voltage is now 1.57 V rms.
As the input frequency is increased further, the output voltage continues to decrease and
approaches zero as the frequency becomes very high, as shown in Figure 38(d) for
A description of the circuit action is as follows: As the frequency of the input increases,
the inductive reactance increases. Because the resistance is constant and the inductive reac-
tance increases, the voltage across the inductor increases and that across the resistor (out-
put voltage) decreases. The input frequency can be increased until it reaches a value at
which the reactance is so large compared to the resistance that the output voltage can be
neglected because it becomes very small compared to the input voltage.
As shown in Figure 38, the circuit passes dc (zero frequency) completely. As the fre-
quency of the input increases, less of the input voltage is passed through to the output. That
is, the output voltage decreases as the frequency increases. It is apparent that the lower fre-
quencies pass through the circuit much better than the higher frequencies. This RL circuit
is therefore a basic form of low-pass filter.
Figure 39 shows a response curve for a low-pass filter.
High-Pass Filter
Figure 40 illustrates high-pass filtering action, where the output is
taken across the inductor. When the input voltage is dc (zero frequency) in part (a), the out-
put is zero volts because the inductor ideally appears as a short across the output.

RL CIRCUITS
In Figure 40(b), the frequency of the input signal has been increased to 100 Hz with 
an rms value of 10 V. The output voltage is 0.63 V rms. Thus, only a small percentage of
the input voltage appears at the output at this frequency.
In Figure 40(c), the input frequency is increased further to 1 kHz, causing more volt-
age to be developed as a result of the increase in the inductive reactance. The output volt-
age at this frequency is 5.32 V rms. As you can see, the output voltage increases as the
frequency increases. A value of frequency is reached at which the reactance is very large
compared to the resistance and most of the input voltage appears across the inductor, as
shown in Figure 40(d).
This circuit tends to prevent lower frequency signals from appearing on the output but
permits higher frequency signals to pass through from input to output; thus, it is a basic
form of high-pass filter.

The Switching Regulator
In high-frequency switching power supplies, small inductors are used as an essential part of the
filter section. A switching power supply is much more efficient at converting ac to dc than any
other type of supply. For this reason it is widely used in computers and other electronic sys-
tems. A switching regulator precisely controls the dc voltage. One type of switching regulator
is shown in Figure 42. It uses an electronic switch to change unregulated dc to high-
frequency pulses. The output is the average value of the pulses. The pulse width is controlled
by the pulse width modulator, which rapidly turns on and off a transistor switch and then is fil-
tered by the filter section to produce regulated dc. (Ripple in the figure is exaggerated to show
the cycle.) The pulse width modulator can increase pulse width if the output drops, or decrease
it if the output rises, thus maintaining a constant average output for varying conditions.
Figure 43 illustrates the basic filtering action. The filter consists of a diode, an in-
ductor, and a capacitor. The diode is a one-way device for current that you will study in a
devices course. In this application the diode acts as an on-off switch that allows current in
only one direction.
An important component of the filter section is the inductor, which in this type of regu-
lator will always have current in it. The average voltage and the load resistor determine the
amount of current. Recall that Lenz’s law states that an induced voltage is created across a
coil that opposes a change in current. When the transistor switch is closed, the pulse is high
and current is passed through the inductor and the load, as shown in Figure 43(a). The
diode is off at this time. Notice that the inductor has an induced voltage across it that op-
poses a change in current. When the pulse goes low, as in Figure 43(b), the transistor is 
off and the inductor develops a voltage in the opposite direction than before. The diode acts
as a closed switch, which provides a path for current. This action tends to keep the load cur-
rent constant. The capacitor adds to this smoothing action by charging and discharging a
small amount during the process.

RL CIRCUITS
Effect of an Open Inductor
The most common failure mode for inductors occurs when
the winding opens as a result of excessive current or a mechanical contact failure. It is easy
to see how an open coil affects the operation of a basic series RL circuit, as shown in Figure
44. Obviously, there is no current path; therefore, the resistor voltage is zero, and the 
total applied voltage appears across the inductor. If you suspect an open coil, remove one
or both leads from the circuit and check continuity with an ohmmeter.

Effect of an Open Resistor
When the resistor is open, there is no current and the inductor
voltage is zero. The total input voltage is across the open resistor, as shown in Figure 45.
Open Components in Parallel Circuits
In a parallel RL circuit, an open resistor or in-
ductor will cause the total current to decrease because the total impedance will increase.
Obviously, the branch with the open component will have zero current. Figure 46 illus-
trates these conditions.
726

RL CIRCUITS
Effect of an Inductor with Shorted Windings
Although a rare occurrence, it is possi-
ble for some of the windings of coils to short together as a result of damaged insulation.
This failure mode is much less likely than the open coil and is difficult to detect. Shorted
windings may result in a reduction in inductance because the inductance of a coil is propor-
tional to the square of the number of turns. A short between windings effectively reduces
the number of turns, which may or may not have an adverse effect on the circuit depending
on the number of turns that are shorted.
Other Troubleshooting Considerations
The failure of a circuit to work properly is not always the result of a faulty component. A
loose wire, a bad contact, or a poor solder joint can cause an open circuit. A short can be
caused by a wire clipping or solder splash. Things as simple as not plugging in a power sup-
ply or a function generator happen more often than you might think. Wrong values in a cir-
cuit (such as an incorrect resistor value), the function generator set at the wrong frequency,
or the wrong output connected to the circuit can cause improper operation.
Always check to make sure that the instruments are properly connected to the circuits
and to a power outlet. Also, look for obvious things such as a broken or loose contact, a
connector that is not completely plugged in, or a piece of wire or a solder bridge that could
be shorting something out.
The following example illustrates a troubleshooting approach to a circuit containing in-
ductors and resistors using the APM (analysis, planning, and measurement) method and
half-splitting.
The circuit represented by the schematic in Figure 47 has no output voltage. The 
circuit is physically constructed on a protoboard. Use your trouble- shooting skills to
find the problem.

Solution
Apply the APM method to this troubleshooting problem.
Analysis: First think of the possible causes for the circuit to have no output voltage.
1. There is no source voltage or the frequency is so high that the inductors appear to be
open because their reactances are extremely high compared to the resistance values.
2. There is a short between one of the resistors and ground. Either a resistor could
be shorted, or there could be some physical short. A shorted resistor is not a com-
mon fault.
3. There is an open between the source and the output. This would prevent current
and thus cause the output voltage to be zero. An inductor could be open, or the
conductive path could be open due to a broken or loose connecting wire or a bad
protoboard contact.
4. There is an incorrect component value. A resistor could be so small that the voltage
across it is negligible. An inductor could be so large that its reactance at the input
frequency is extremely high.

RL CIRCUITS
Planning: You decide to make some visual checks for problems such as the function
generator power cord not plugged in or the frequency set at an incorrect value. Also,
broken leads, shorted leads, as well as an incorrect resistor color code or inductor
value often can be found visually. If nothing is discovered after a visual check, then
you will make voltage measurements to track down the cause of the problem. You 
decide to use a digital oscilloscope and a DMM to make the measurements using the
half-splitting technique to more quickly isolate the fault.
Measurement: Assume that you find that the function generator is plugged in and the
frequency setting appears to be correct. Also, you find no visible opens or shorts dur-
ing your visual check, and the component values are correct.
The first step in the measurement process is to check the voltage from the source
with the scope. Assume a 10 V rms sine wave with a frequency of 5 kHz is observed at
the circuit input as shown in Figure 48(a). The correct ac voltage is present, so the 
first possible cause has been eliminated.
Next, check for a short by disconnecting the source and placing the DMM (set on
the ohmmeter function) across each resistor. If any resistor is shorted (unlikely), the
meter will read zero or a very small resistance. Assuming the meter readings are okay,
the second possible cause has been eliminated.
Since the voltage has been “lost” somewhere between the input and the output, you
must now look for the voltage. You reconnect the source and, using the half-splitting
approach, measure the voltage at point 3 (the middle of the circuit) with respect to
ground. The DMM test lead is placed on the right lead of inductor 
as indicated in
Figure 48(b). Assume the voltage at this point is zero. This tells you that the part 
of the circuit to the right of point 3 is probably okay and the fault is in the circuit
between point 3 and the source.
Now, you begin tracing the circuit back toward the source looking for the voltage
(you could also start from the source and work forward). Placing the meter test lead 
on point 2, at the left lead of inductor 
results in a reading of 8.31 V as shown in
Figure 48(b). This, of course, indicates that 
is open. Fortunately, in this case, a
component, and not a contact on the board, is faulty. It is usually easier to replace a
component than to repair a bad contact.

INTRODUCTION
In this chapter, analysis methods are extended to the cover-
age of circuits with combinations of resistive, inductive, and
capacitive components. Series and parallel RLC circuits, plus
series-parallel combinations, are studied.
Circuits with both inductance and capacitance can exhibit
the property of resonance, which is important in many types
of applications. Resonance is the basis for frequency selectiv-
ity in communication systems. For example, the ability of a
radio or television receiver to select a certain frequency that
is transmitted by a particular station and, at the same time,
to eliminate frequencies from other stations is based on the
principle of resonance. The conditions in RLC circuits that
produce resonance and the characteristics of resonant cir-
cuits are covered in this chapter.

IMPEDANCE OF SERIES RLC CIRCUITS
A series RLC circuit contains resistance, inductance, and capacitance. Since inductive
reactance and capacitive reactance have opposite effects on the circuit phase angle, the
total reactance is less than either individual reactance.

As you know, inductive reactance 
causes the total current to lag the applied volt-
age. Capacitive reactance 
has the opposite effect: It causes the current to lead the
voltage. Thus

As you have seen, when the inductive reactance is greater than the capacitive reactance,
the circuit appears inductive; so the current lags the applied voltage. When the capacitive re-

IMPEDANCE OF PARALLEL RLC CIRCUITS
In this section, you will study the impedance and phase angle of a parallel RLC circuit.
Also, conductance, susceptance, and admittance of a parallel RLC circuit are covered.
After completing this section, you should be able to

Solution
Use the sum-of-reciprocals formula.
Apply the rule for division of polar numbers.
Recall that the sign of the denominator angle changes when dividing.
Next, convert each term to its rectangular equivalent and combine.
Take the reciprocal to obtain Z and then convert to polar form.
The negative angle shows that the circuit is capacitive. This may surprise you because
However, in a parallel circuit, the smaller quantity has the greater effect on
the total current because its current is the greatest. Similar to the case of resistances
in parallel, the smaller reactance draws more current and has the greater effect on the
total Z.
In this circuit, the total current leads the total voltage by a phase angle of 45°.

Recall that capacitive reactance varies inversely with frequency and that inductive reac-
tance varies directly with frequency. In a parallel RLC circuit at low frequencies, the in-
ductive reactance is less than the capacitive reactance; therefore, the circuit is inductive. As

This is the point of parallel resonance. As the frequency is increased further,

and the circuit becomes capacitive.
Current Relationships
In a parallel RLC circuit, the current in the capacitive branch and the current in the induc-
tive branch are always 180° out of phase with each other (neglecting any coil resistance).
Because 
and 
add algebraically, the total current is actually the difference in their mag-
nitudes. Thus, the total current into the parallel branches of L and C is always less than the
largest individual branch current, as illustrated in Figure 22 and in the waveform diagram
of Figure 23. Of course, the current in the resistive branch is always 90° out of phase with
both reactive currents, as shown in the current phasor diagram of Figure 24. Notice that 
is plotted on the positive y-axis and 
is plotted on the negative y-axis.

Parallel Resonant Frequency
For an ideal (no resistance) parallel resonant circuit, the frequency at which resonance
occurs is determined by the same formula as in series resonant circuits; that is,
Tank Circuit
The parallel resonant LC circuit is often called a tank circuit. The term tank circuit refers
to the fact that the parallel resonant circuit stores energy in the magnetic field of the coil
and in the electric field of the capacitor. The stored energy is transferred back and forth be-
tween the capacitor and the coil on alternate half-cycles as the current goes first one way
and then the other when the inductor deenergizes and the capacitor charges, and vice versa.
This concept is illustrated in Figure 28.

Variation of the Impedance with Frequency
Ideally, the impedance of a parallel resonant circuit is infinite. In practice, the impedance
is maximum at the resonant frequency and decreases at lower and higher frequencies, as in-
dicated by the curve in Figure 29.
At very low frequencies,
is very small and 
is very high, so the total impedance is
essentially equal to that of the inductive branch. As the frequency goes up, the impedance also
increases, and the inductive reactance dominates (because it is less than 
) until the reso-
nant frequency is reached. At this point, of course,

) and the

impedance is at its maximum. As the frequency goes above resonance, the capacitive reac-
tance dominates (because it is less than 
) and the impedance decreases.
Current and Phase Angle at Resonance
In the ideal tank circuit, the total current from the source at resonance is zero because the
impedance is infinite. In the nonideal case when the winding resistance is considered, there
is some total current at the resonant frequency, and it is determined by the impedance at
resonance.

The phase angle of the parallel resonant circuit is 0° because the impedance is purely

In most practical situations, an external load resistance appears in parallel with a nonideal
tank circuit, as shown in Figure 43(a). Obviously, the external resistor (

more of the energy delivered by the source and thus will lower the overall Q of the circuit.

BANDWIDTH OF RESONANT CIRCUITS
The current in a series RLC is maximum at the resonant frequency because the reac-
tances cancel. The current in a parallel RLC is minimum at the resonant frequency be-
cause the inductive and capacitive currents cancel. This circuit behavior relates to a
characteristic called bandwidth.
After completing this section, you should be able to

Series Resonant Circuits
The current in a series RLC circuit is maximum at the resonant frequency (also known as
center frequency) and drops off on either side of this frequency. Bandwidth, sometimes ab-
breviated BW, is an important characteristic of a resonant circuit. The bandwidth is the range
of frequencies for which the current is equal to or greater than 70.7% of its resonant value.
Figure 44 illustrates bandwidth on the response curve of a series RLC circuit. Notice that
the frequency 
below 
is the point at which the current is 
and is commonly
called the lower critical frequency. The frequency 
above 
where the current is again
is the upper critical frequency. Other names for 
and 
are 
frequencies,
cutoff frequencies, and half-power frequencies. The significance of the latter term is dis-
cussed later in the chapter.

RLC CIRCUITS AND RESONANCE
Half-Power Frequencies
As previously mentioned, the upper and lower critical frequencies are sometimes called the
half-power frequencies. This term is derived from the fact that the power from the source
at these frequencies is one-half the power delivered at the resonant frequency. The follow-
ing shows that this is true for a series circuit. The same end result also applies to a parallel
circuit. At resonance,
The power at

Selectivity
The response curves in Figures 44 and 45 are also called selectivity curves. Selectivity de-
fines how well a resonant circuit responds to a certain frequency and discriminates against
all others. The narrower the bandwidth, the greater the selectivity.
Ideally, we assume that a resonant circuit accepts frequencies within its bandwidth and
completely eliminates frequencies outside the bandwidth. Such is not actually the case,
however, because signals with frequencies outside the bandwidth are not completely elim-
inated. Their magnitudes, however, are greatly reduced. The further the frequencies are
from the critical frequencies, the greater the reduction, as illustrated in Figure 46(a). An
ideal selectivity curve is shown in Figure 46(b).

Another factor that influences selectivity is the steepness of the slopes of the response
curve. The faster the curve drops off at the critical frequencies, the more selective the cir-
cuit is because it tends to respond only to the frequencies within the bandwidth. Figure 47
shows a general comparison of three response curves with varying degrees of selectivity.
Q Affects Bandwidth
A higher value of circuit Q results in a narrower bandwidth. A lower value of Q causes a
wider bandwidth. A formula for the bandwidth of a resonant circuit in terms of Q is stated

APPLICATIONS
Resonant circuits are used in a wide variety of applications, particularly in communi-
cation systems. In this section, we will look briefly at a few common communication
systems applications to illustrate the importance of resonant circuits in electronic
communication.

RLC CIRCUITS AND RESONANCE
Tuned Amplifiers
A tuned amplifier is a circuit that amplifies signals within a specified band. Typically, a par-
allel resonant circuit is used in conjunction with an amplifier to achieve the selectivity. In
terms of the general operation, input signals with frequencies that range over a wide band
are accepted on the amplifier’s input and are amplified. The resonant circuit allows only a
relatively narrow band of those frequencies to be passed on. The variable capacitor allows
tuning over the range of input frequencies so that a desired frequency can be selected, as in-
dicated in Figure 49.
Antenna Input to a Receiver
Radio signals are sent out from a transmitter via electromagnetic waves that propagate
through the atmosphere. When the electromagnetic waves cut across the receiving antenna,
small voltages are induced. Out of all the wide range of electromagnetic frequencies, only

one frequency or a limited band of frequencies must be extracted. Figure 50 shows a typical
arrangement of an antenna coupled to the receiver input by a transformer. A variable capac-
itor is connected across the transformer secondary to form a parallel resonant circuit.
Double-Tuned Transformer Coupling in a Receiver
In some types of communication receivers, tuned amplifiers are transformer-coupled to-
gether to increase the amplification. Capacitors can be placed in parallel with the primary
and secondary windings of the transformer, effectively creating two parallel resonant band-
pass filters that are coupled together. This technique, illustrated in Figure 51, can result in

a wider bandwidth and steeper slopes on the response curve, thus increasing the selectivity
for a desired band of frequencies.
Audio Crossover Networks
Most quality stereo systems have speakers designed for specific parts of the audio
frequency spectrum. Audio crossover networks are filter networks that separate the
audio signal into different frequency bands for the speakers while maintaining an over-
all flat response. Crossover networks can be passive (meaning only inductors, capaci-
tors, and resistors are used) or active (meaning transistor and operational amplifiers
are used).
A three-way passive network includes a band-pass filter that is essentially a low-Q res-
onant filter designed to have a broad flat response. The design of passive crossover net-
works is complicated because of various factors that affect the overall response (such as
variations of the speaker’s impedance as a function of frequency), but the basic concept is
simple. The network separates the audio spectrum into three parts and passes each part to
the appropriate speaker, as indicated in Figure 52. The network has three filters: a high-
pass filter that passes high frequencies to the tweeter (or high-frequency speaker), a band-
pass filter that passes middle frequencies to the mid-range speaker, and a low-pass filter
that passes low frequencies to the woofer (or low-frequency speaker).

Superheterodyne Receiver
Another example of resonant circuit (filter) applications is in the common AM (amplitude
modulation) receiver. The AM broadcast band ranges from 535 kHz to 1605 kHz. Each AM
station is assigned a 10 kHz bandwidth within that range. The tuned circuits are designed
to pass only the signals from the desired radio station, rejecting all others. To reject sta-
tions outside the one that is tuned, the tuned circuits must be selective, passing on only
the signals in the 10 kHz band and rejecting all others. Too much selectivity is not de-
sirable either however. If the bandwidth is too narrow, some of the higher frequency
modulated signals will be rejected, resulting in a loss of fidelity. Ideally, the resonant
782

RLC CIRCUITS AND RESONANCE
circuit must reject signals that are not in the desired passband. A simplified block dia-
gram of a superheterodyne AM receiver is shown in Figure 53.
There are basically three parallel resonant circuits in the front end of the receiver. Each
of these resonant circuits is gang-tuned by capacitors; that is, the capacitors are mechani-
cally or electronically linked together so that they change together as the tuning knob is
turned. The front end is tuned to receive a desired station, for example, one that transmits
at 600 kHz. The input resonant circuit from the antenna and the RF (radio frequency)
amplifier resonant circuit select only a frequency of 600 kHz out of all the frequencies
crossing the antenna.
The actual audio (sound) signal is carried by the 600 kHz carrier frequency by modulat-
ing the amplitude of the carrier so that it follows the audio signal as indicated. The variation
in the amplitude of the carrier corresponding to the audio signal is called the envelope. The
600 kHz is then applied to a circuit called the mixer.
The local oscillator (LO) is tuned to a frequency that is 455 kHz above the selected fre-
quency (1055 kHz, in this case). By a process called heterodyning or beating, the AM
signal and the local oscillator signal are mixed together, and the 600 kHz AM signal is con-
verted by the mixer to a 455 kHz AM signal (
).
The 455 kHz is the intermediate frequency (IF) for standard AM receivers. No matter
which station within the broadcast band is selected, its frequency is always converted to the
455 kHz IF. The amplitude-modulated IF is amplified by the IF amplifier which is tuned to
455 kHz. The output of the IF amplifier is applied to an audio detector which removes the
IF, leaving only the envelope which is the audio signal. The audio signal is then amplified
and applied to the speaker.

Application Activity
In this chapter, the receiver is used to
illustrate one application of resonant
circuits. We will focus on a part of the
“front end” of the receiver system that
contains resonant circuits. Generally, the front end includes the
RF amplifier, the local oscillator, and the mixer. In this applica-
tion activity, the RF amplifier is the focus. A knowledge of am-
plifier circuits is not necessary at this time.
A basic block diagram of an AM radio receiver is shown in
Figure 54. In this particular system, the “front end” includes the
circuitry used for tuning in a desired broadcasting station by fre-
quency selection and then converting that selected frequency to a
standard intermediate frequency (IF). AM radio stations transmit
in the frequency range from 535 kHz to 1605 kHz. The purpose
of the RF amplifier is to take the signals picked up by the an-
tenna, reject all but the signal from the desired station, and am-
plify it to a higher level.

you will learn more about in a later course. All that you need to
know at this point is that the varactor is basically a variable ca-

across it. In this circuit, the dc voltage comes from the wiper of
the potentiometer used for tuning the receiver.

SUMMARY
◆
and 
have opposing effects in an RLC circuit.
◆In a series RLC circuit, the larger reactance determines the net reactance of the circuit.
◆At series resonance, the inductive and capacitive reactances are equal.
◆The impedance of a series RLC circuit is purely resistive at resonance.
◆In a series RLC circuit, the current is maximum at resonance.
◆The reactive voltages 
and 
cancel at resonance in a series RLC circuit because they are equal
in magnitude and 180° out of phase.
◆In a parallel RLC circuit, the smaller reactance determines the net reactance of the circuit.
◆In a parallel resonant circuit, the impedance is maximum at the resonant frequency.
◆A parallel resonant circuit is commonly called a tank circuit.
◆The impedance of a parallel RLC circuit is purely resistive at resonance.
◆The bandwidth of a series resonant circuit is the range of frequencies for which the current is
or greater.
◆The bandwidth of a parallel resonant circuit is the range of frequencies for which the impedance
is 
or greater.
◆The critical frequencies are the frequencies above and below resonance where the circuit response
is 70.7% of the maximum response.
◆A higher Q produces a narrower bandwidth.

INTRODUCTION
Passive filters are discussed in this chapter. Passive filters use
various combinations of resistors, capacitors, and inductors.
You should have already seen how basic RC, RL, and RLC cir-
cuits can be used as filters. Now, you will learn that passive
filters can be placed in four general categories according to
their response characteristics: low-pass, high-pass, band-
pass, and band-stop. Within each category, there are several
common types that will be examined.
◆Low-pass filter
◆Passband
◆Critical frequency ( fc)
◆Roll-off
◆Attenuation
◆Decade
◆Bode plot
◆High-pass filter
◆Band-pass filter
◆Center frequency ( f0)
◆Band-stop filter

PASSIVE FILTERS
Figure 1 shows a block diagram and a general response curve for a low-pass filter. The
range of frequencies passed by a filter within specified limits is called the passband of the
filter. The point considered to be the upper end of the passband is at the critical frequency,
as illustrated in Figure 1(b). The critical frequency (fc) is the frequency at which the
filter’s output voltage is 70.7% of the maximum. The filter’s critical frequency is also
called the cutoff frequency, break frequency, or 
dB frequency because the output volt-
age is down 3 dB from its maximum at this frequency. The term dB (decibel) is a com-
monly used unit in filter measurements.

LOW-PASS FILTERS
A low-pass filter allows signals with lower frequencies to pass from input to output
while rejecting higher frequencies.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Analyze the operation of RC and RL low-pass filters
◆Express the voltage and power ratios of a filter in decibels
◆Determine the critical frequency of a low-pass filter
◆Explain the difference between actual and ideal low-pass response curves
◆Define roll-off
◆Generate a Bode plot for a low-pass filter
◆Discuss phase shift in a low-pass filter
Decibels
The basis for the decibel unit stems from the logarithmic response of the human ear to the
intensity of sound. The decibel is a logarithmic measurement of the ratio of one power to
another or one voltage to another, which can be used to express the input-to-output rela-
tionship of a filter. The following equation expresses a power ratio in decibels:

RC Low-Pass Filter
A basic RC low-pass filter is shown in Figure 2. Notice that the output voltage is taken
across the capacitor.
When the input is dc (0 Hz), the output voltage equals the input voltage because 
is
infinitely large. As the input frequency is increased,
decreases and, as a result,
grad-
ually decreases until a frequency is reached where 
This is the critical frequency,

Roll-Off of the Response Curve
The blue line in Figure 3 shows an actual response curve for a low-pass filter. The maxi-
mum output is defined to be 0 dB as a reference. Zero decibels corresponds to 
because 
The output drops from 0 dB to 
at the
critical frequency and then continues to decrease at a fixed rate. This pattern of decrease is
called the roll-off of the frequency response. The red line shows an ideal output response
that is considered to be “flat” out to the critical frequency. The output then decreases at the
fixed rate.

As the frequency continues to increase above 
the output voltage continues to decrease. In fact, for each tenfold increase in frequency

PASSIVE FILTERS
A tenfold change in frequency is called a decade. So, for an RC circuit, the output volt-
age is reduced by 20 dB for each decade increase in frequency. A similar result can be de-
rived for a high-pass circuit. The roll-off is a constant 
for a basic RC or RL
filter. Figure 4 shows the ideal frequency response plot on a semilog scale, where each in-
terval on the horizontal axis represents a tenfold increase in frequency. This response curve
is called a Bode plot.

quency is increased by ten, the output is reduced by 20 dB. A slight variation from this
occurs in actual practice. The output is actually at

cal frequency.

The bandwidth of a band-pass filter is the range of frequencies for which the cur-
rent, and therefore the output voltage, is equal to or greater than 70.7% of its value
at the resonant frequency.
As you know, bandwidth is often abbreviated BW and can be calculated as

has minimum impedance and maximum current at the resonant frequency,
Thus, most of
the input voltage is dropped across the resistor at the resonant frequency. Therefore, the
output across R has a band-pass characteristic with a maximum output at the frequency of
resonance. The resonant frequency is called the center frequency, f0. The bandwidth is

a parallel resonant circuit has maximum impedance at resonance. The circuit in Figure 24
acts as a voltage divider. At resonance, the impedance of the tank circuit is much greater
than the resistance. Thus, most of the input voltage is across the tank circuit, producing a
maximum output voltage at the resonant (center) frequency.
At 
the inductive reactance is

more of the input voltage is across R. As a result, the output voltage across the tank circuit
drops off, creating a band-pass characteristic.

Series Resonant Band-Stop Filter
A series resonant circuit used in a band-stop configuration is shown in Figure 30. Basically,
it works as follows: At the resonant frequency, the impedance is minimum, and therefore
the output voltage is minimum. Most of the input voltage is dropped across R. At frequen-
cies above and below resonance, the impedance increases, causing more voltage across the
output.

Parallel Resonant Band-Stop Filter
A parallel resonant circuit used in a band-stop configuration is shown in Figure 32. At the
resonant frequency, the tank impedance is maximum, and so most of the input voltage ap-
pears across it. Very little voltage is across R at resonance. As the tank impedance decreases
above and below resonance, the output voltage increases.
To determine the bandwidth, first calculate the center frequency and Q of the circuit.

INTRODUCTION
The theorems in this chapter make analysis easier for certain
types of circuits. These methods do not replace Ohm’s law
and Kirchhoff’s laws, but they are normally used in conjunc-
tion with those laws in certain situations.
The superposition theorem helps you to deal with circuits
that have multiple sources. Thevenin’s and Norton’s theo-
rems provide methods for reducing a circuit to a simple
equivalent form for easier analysis. The maximum power
transfer theorem is used in applications where it is impor-
tant for a given circuit to provide maximum power to a load.

THE SUPERPOSITION THEOREM
In this section, the superposition theorem is applied to circuits with ac sources and 
reactive components.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Apply the superposition theorem to ac circuit analysis
◆State the superposition theorem
◆List the steps in applying the theorem
The superposition theorem can be stated as follows:
The current in any given branch of a multiple-source circuit can be found by de-
termining the currents in that particular branch produced by each source acting
alone, with all other sources replaced by their internal impedances. The total cur-
rent in the given branch is the phasor sum of the individual currents in that
branch.
The procedure for the application of the superposition theorem is as follows:
Step 1: Leave one of the voltage (current) sources in the circuit, and replace all others
with their internal impedance. For ideal voltage sources, the internal imped-
ance is zero. For ideal current sources, the internal impedance is infinite. We
will call this procedure zeroing the source.
Step 2: Find the current in the branch of interest produced by the one remaining
source.
Step 3: Repeat Steps 1 and 2 for each source in turn. When complete, you will have a
number of current values equal to the number of sources in the circuit.
Step 4: Add the individual current values as phasor quantities.
Example 1 illustrates this procedure for a circuit containing two ideal voltage sources,
and Vs2.

THEVENIN’S THEOREM
Thevenin’s theorem, as applied to ac circuits, provides a method for reducing any
circuit to an equivalent form that consists of an equivalent ac voltage source in series
with an equivalent impedance.
840

CIRCUIT THEOREMS IN AC ANALYSIS
Equivalency
The form of Thevenin’s equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 12. Regardless of how com-
plex the original circuit is, it can always be reduced to this equivalent form. The equivalent
voltage source is designated 
the equivalent impedance is designated 
(lowercase
italic subscript denotes ac quantity). Notice that the impedance is represented by a block in
the circuit diagram. This is because the equivalent impedance can be of several forms:
purely resistive, purely capacitive, purely inductive, or a combination of a resistance and a
reactance.
Figure 13(a) shows a block diagram that represents an ac circuit of any given complex-
ity. This circuit has two output terminals, A and B. A load impedance,
is connected to
the terminals. The circuit produces a certain voltage,
and a certain current,

trated.

By Thevenin’s theorem, the circuit in the block can be reduced to an equivalent form, as
indicated in the beige area of Figure 13(b). The term equivalent means that when the same
value of load is connected to both the original circuit and Thevenin’s equivalent circuit, the
load voltages and currents are equal for both. Therefore, as far as the load is concerned,
there is no difference between the original circuit and Thevenin’s equivalent circuit. The
load “sees” the same current and voltage regardless of whether it is connected to the origi-
nal circuit or to the Thevenin equivalent. For ac circuits, the equivalent circuit is for one
particular frequency. When the frequency is changed, the equivalent circuit must be recal-
culated.
Thevenin’s Equivalent Voltage (Vth)
As you have seen, the equivalent voltage,
is one part of the complete Thevenin equiv-
alent circuit.
Thevenin’s equivalent voltage is defined as the open circuit voltage between two
specified terminals in a circuit.

tween two specified terminals, A and B, as shown in Figure 14(a). We wish to find the
Thevenin equivalent circuit for the circuit as “seen” by R.

nals A and B, with R removed, as shown in part (b) of the figure. The circuit is viewed from

Thevenin’s Equivalent Impedance (Zth)
The previous examples illustrated how to find 
Now, let’s determine the Thevenin
equivalent impedance,
the second part of a Thevenin equivalent circuit. As defined by
Thevenin’s theorem,
Thevenin’s equivalent impedance is the total impedance appearing between two speci-
fied terminals in a given circuit with all sources replaced by their internal impedances.
To find 
between any two terminals in a circuit, replace all the voltage sources by a short
(any internal impedance remains in series). Replace all the current sources by an open (any
internal impedance remains in parallel). Then determine the total impedance between the
two terminals. The following three examples illustrate how to find Zth.

Summary of Thevenin’s Theorem
Remember that the Thevenin equivalent circuit is always a voltage source in series with an
impedance regardless of the original circuit that it replaces. The significance of Thevenin’s
theorem is that the equivalent circuit can replace the original circuit as far as any external
load is concerned. Any load connected between the terminals of a Thevenin equivalent cir-
cuit experiences the same current and voltage as if it were connected to the terminals of the
original circuit.
A summary of steps for applying Thevenin’s theorem follows.
Step 1: Open the two terminals between which you want to find the Thevenin circuit.
This is done by removing the component from which the circuit is to be viewed.
Step 2: Determine the voltage across the two open terminals.
Step 3: Determine the impedance viewed from the two open terminals with ideal volt-
age sources replaced with shorts and ideal current sources replaced with opens
(zeroed).
Step 4: Connect 
and 
in series to produce the complete Thevenin equivalent
circuit.

NORTON’S THEOREM
Like Thevenin’s theorem, Norton’s theorem provides a method of reducing a more
complex circuit to a simpler, more manageable form for analysis. The basic difference
is that Norton’s theorem gives an equivalent current source (rather than a voltage
source) in parallel (rather than in series) with an equivalent impedance.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Apply Norton’s theorem to simplify reactive ac circuits
◆Describe the form of a Norton equivalent circuit
◆Obtain the Norton equivalent ac current source
◆Obtain the Norton equivalent impedance
The form of Norton’s equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 31. Regardless of how com-
plex the original circuit is, it can be reduced to this equivalent form. The equivalent current
source is designated 
and the equivalent impedance is 
(lowercase italic subscript de-
notes ac quantity).
Norton’s theorem shows you how to find 
and 
Once they are known, simply con-
nect them in parallel to get the complete Norton equivalent circuit.
Norton’s Equivalent Current Source (In)
is one part of the Norton equivalent circuit; 
is the other part.
Norton’s equivalent current is defined as the short-circuit current between two
specified terminals in a given circuit.
Any load connected between these two terminals effectively “sees” a current source 
in

Application Activity
In this application activity, you have a
sealed band-pass filter module that has
been removed from a system and two
schematics. Both schematics indicate
that the band-pass filter is implemented with a low-pass/high-
pass combination. It is uncertain which schematic corresponds
to the filter module, but one of them does. By certain measure-
ments, you will determine which schematic represents the filter
so that the filter circuit can be reproduced. Also, you will deter-
mine the proper load for maximum power transfer. The filter cir-
cuit contained in a sealed module and two schematics, one of
which corresponds to the filter circuit, are shown in Figure 42.
Filter Measurement and Analysis
1. Based on the oscilloscope measurement of the filter output
shown in Figure 43, determine which schematic in Figure
42 represents the component values of the filter circuit in
the module. A 10 V peak-to-peak voltage is applied to the
input.
2. Based on the oscilloscope measurement in Figure 43, deter-
mine if the filter is operating at its approximate center fre-
quency.
3. Using Thevenin’s theorem, determine the load impedance
that will provide for maximum power transfer at the center
frequency when connected to the output of the filter. As-
sume the source impedance is zero.

termined not to be in the module.

CIRCUIT THEOREMS IN AC ANALYSIS
SUMMARY
◆The superposition theorem is useful for the analysis of both ac and dc multiple-source circuits.
◆Thevenin’s theorem provides a method for the reduction of any ac circuit to an equivalent form
consisting of an equivalent voltage source in series with an equivalent impedance.
◆The term equivalency, as used in Thevenin’s and Norton’s theorems, means that when a given load
impedance is connected to the equivalent circuit, it will have the same voltage across it and the
same current through it as when it is connected to the original circuit.
◆Norton’s theorem provides a method for the reduction of any ac circuit to an equivalent form con-
sisting of an equivalent current source in parallel with an equivalent impedance.
◆Maximum power is transferred to a load when the load impedance is the complex conjugate of the
impedance of the driving circuit.

INTRODUCTION
In this chapter, the time response of RC and RL circuits 
with pulse inputs is examined. Understanding exponential
changes of voltages and currents in capacitors and inductors
is crucial to the study of time response. 
With pulse inputs, the time responses of circuits are im-
portant. In the areas of pulse and digital circuits, technicians
are often concerned with how a circuit responds over an in-
terval of time to rapid changes in voltages or current. The re-
lationship of the circuit time constant to the input pulse
characteristics, such as pulse width and period, determines
the wave shapes of voltages in the circuit.
Integrator and differentiator, terms used throughout this
chapter, refer to mathematical functions that are approxi-
mated by these circuits under certain conditions. Mathemati-
cal integration is a summation process, and mathematical
differentiation is a process for establishing an instantaneous
rate of change of a quantity.

TIME RESPONSE OF REACTIVE CIRCUITS
Charging and Discharging of a Capacitor
When a pulse generator is connected to the input of an RC integrator, as shown in Figure 
1, the capacitor will charge and discharge in response to the pulses. When the input 
goes from its low level to its high level, the capacitor charges toward the high level of the
pulse through the resistor. This charging action is analogous to connecting a battery
through a closed switch to the RC circuit, as illustrated in Figure 2(a). When the pulse 
goes from its high level back to its low level, the capacitor discharges back through the
source. Compared to the resistance of the resistor, the resistance of the source is assumed
to be negligible. This discharging action is analogous to replacing the source with a closed
switch, as illustrated in Figure 2(b).

When the input pulse goes HIGH, the source
effectively acts as a battery in series with a
closed switch, thereby charging the capacitor.

When the input pulse goes back LOW, the
source effectively acts as a closed switch,
providing a discharge path for the capacitor.

THE RC INTEGRATOR
In terms of time response, a series RC circuit in which the output voltage is taken across
the capacitor is known as an integrator. Recall that in terms of frequency response, it
is a low-pass filter. The term integrator is derived from the mathematical process of 
integration, which this type of circuit approximates under certain conditions.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Explain the operation of an RC integrator
◆Describe how a capacitor charges and discharges

A capacitor will charge and discharge following an exponential curve. Its rate of charg-

For an ideal pulse, both edges are considered to be instantaneous. Two basic rules of ca-
pacitor behavior help in understanding the response of RC circuits to pulse inputs.

open to dc.
2. The voltage across the capacitor cannot change instantaneously—it can change
only exponentially.
Capacitor Voltage
In an RC integrator, the output is the capacitor voltage. The capacitor charges during the
time that the pulse is high. If the pulse is at its high level long enough, the capacitor will
fully charge to the voltage amplitude of the pulse, as illustrated in Figure 3. The capacitor
discharges during the time that the pulse is low. If the low time between pulses is long
enough, the capacitor will fully discharge to zero, as shown in the figure. Then when the
next pulse occurs, it will charge again.

Variation of an RC integrator’s output pulse shape with time constant. The shaded areas indicate
when the capacitor is charging or discharging.
Two conditions of pulse response must be considered:
1. When the input pulse width 
is equal to or greater than five time constants
2. When the input pulse width is less than five time constants 
Recall that five time constants is accepted as the time for a capacitor to fully charge or fully
discharge; this time is often called the transient time. A capacitor will fully charge if the
pulse width is equal to or greater than five time constants 
This condition is expressed
as 
At the end of the pulse, the capacitor fully discharges back through the source.
Figure 4 illustrates the output waveforms for various RC transient times and a fixed
input pulse width. Notice that as the transient time becomes shorter, compared to the pulse
width, the shape of the output pulse approaches that of the input. In each case, the output
reaches the full amplitude of the input.

As you know, the ca-
pacitor charges for the duration of the pulse. However, because the pulse width is less than
the time it takes the capacitor to fully charge 
the output voltage will not reach the full
input voltage before the end of the pulse. The capacitor only partially charges, as illustrated
in Figure 6 for several values of RC time constants. Notice that for longer time constants,
the output reaches a lower voltage because the capacitor cannot charge as much. Of course,
in the examples with a single pulse input, the capacitor fully discharges after the pulse ends.

The capacitor charges less and less as the input pulse width is reduced. The time constant is fixed.
When the time constant is much greater than the input pulse width, the capacitor charges
very little, and, as a result, the output voltage becomes almost negligible, as indicated in
Figure 6.
Figure 7 illustrates the effect of reducing the input pulse width for a fixed time constant
value. As the input pulse width is reduced, the output voltage decreases because the capac-
itor has less time to charge. However, it takes the capacitor approximately the same length
of time 
to discharge back to zero for each condition after the pulse is removed.

RESPONSE OF RC INTEGRATORS TO REPETITIVE PULSES
In electronic systems, you will encounter waveforms with repetitive pulses much more
often than single pulses. However, an understanding of the integrator’s response to sin-
gle pulses is necessary in order to understand how these circuits respond to repeated
pulses.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Analyze an RC integrator with repetitive input pulses
◆Determine the response when the capacitor does not fully charge or discharge
◆Define steady state
◆Describe the effect of an increase in time constant on circuit response
If the pulse width and the time between pulses are each equal to or greater than five time
constants, the capacitor will fully charge and fully discharge during each period (T) of the
input waveform. This case is shown in Figure 12.
When the pulse width and the time between pulses are shorter than five time constants,
as illustrated in Figure 13 for a square wave, the capacitor will not completely charge 
or discharge. We will now examine the effects of this situation on the output voltage of the
RC integrator.

The capacitor discharges, and the voltage decreases to
36.8% of the voltage at the beginning of this interval:

The capacitor voltage will increase an additional 63.2% of 7.67 V, which is 4.85 V. Thus,
at the end of the second pulse, the output voltage is

Therefore, the voltage at the end of the third pulse is 
Between third and fourth pulses
The voltage during this interval decreases due to ca-

final voltage in this interval is 0.368(7.29 V) = 2.68 V.

Steady-State Time Response
In the preceding discussion, the output voltage gradually built up and then began leveling
off. It takes approximately 
for the output voltage to build up to a constant average value.
This interval is the transient time of the circuit. Once the output voltage reaches the aver-
age value of the input voltage, a steady-state condition is reached that continues as long as
the periodic input continues. This condition is illustrated in Figure 16 based on the values
obtained in the preceding discussion.

The transient time for our example circuit is the time from the beginning of the first
pulse to the end of the third pulse. The reason for this interval is that the capacitor voltage
at the end of the third pulse is 7.29 V, which is about 99% of the final voltage.
The Effect of an Increase in Time Constant
What happens to the output voltage if the RC time constant of the integrator is increased
with a variable resistor, as indicated in Figure 17? As the time constant is increased, the
capacitor charges less during a pulse and discharges less between pulses. The result is a

Figure 18.
As the time constant becomes extremely long compared to the pulse width, the output
voltage approaches a constant dc voltage, as shown in Figure 18(c). This value is the
average value of the input. For a square wave, it is one-half the amplitude.

Obviously, the time constant is much longer than the input pulse width or the interval
between pulses (notice that the input is not a square wave). In this case, the exponen-
tial formulas must be applied, and the analysis is relatively difficult. Follow the solu-
tion carefully.

2. Calculation for interval between first and second pulse: Use the equation for a de-

Therefore,
This result is shown in Figure 20(b).
3. Calculation for second pulse: At the beginning of the second pulse, the output
voltage is 671 mV. During the second pulse, the capacitor will again charge. In this
case, it does not begin at zero volts. It already has 671 mV from the previous

RESPONSE OF AN RC DIFFERENTIATOR TO A SINGLE PULSE
In terms of time response, a series RC circuit in which the output voltage is taken across
the resistor is known as a differentiator. Recall that in terms of frequency response, it
is a high-pass filter. The term differentiator is derived from the mathematical process of
differentiation, which this type of circuit approximates under certain conditions.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Analyze an RC differentiator with a single input pulse
◆Describe the response at the rising edge of the input pulse
◆Determine the response during and at the end of a pulse for various pulse
width–time constant relationships
Figure 21 shows an RC differentiator with a pulse input. The same action occurs in 
a differentiator as in an integrator, except the output voltage is taken across the resistor
rather than across the capacitor. The capacitor charges exponentially at a rate depending on
the RC time constant. The shape of the differentiator’s resistor voltage is determined by the
charging and discharging action of the capacitor.
881

TIME RESPONSE OF REACTIVE CIRCUITS
Pulse Response
To understand how the output voltage is shaped by a differentiator, you must consider the
following:
1. The response to the rising pulse edge
2. The response between the rising and falling edges
3. The response to the falling pulse edge
Let’s assume that the capacitor is initially uncharged prior to the rising pulse edge. Prior
to the pulse, the input is zero volts. Thus, there are zero volts across the capacitor and also
zero volts across the resistor, as indicated in Figure 22(a).

Response to the Rising Edge of the Input Pulse
Let’s also assume that a 10 V pulse
is applied to the input. When the rising edge occurs, point A goes to

instantaneously as a short. Therefore, if point A goes instantly to 
then point B must
also go instantly to 
keeping the capacitor voltage zero for the instant of the rising
edge. The capacitor voltage is the voltage from point A to point B.
The voltage at point B with respect to ground is the voltage across the resistor (and the
output voltage). Thus, the output voltage suddenly goes to 
in response to the rising
pulse edge, as indicated in Figure 22(b).
Response During Pulse When tW
5
While the pulse is at its high level between the
rising edge and the falling edge, the capacitor is charging. When the pulse width is equal to
or greater than five time constants (
), the capacitor has time to fully charge.
As the voltage across the capacitor builds up exponentially, the voltage across the resis-
tor decreases exponentially until it reaches zero volts at the time the capacitor reaches full
charge (
in this case). This decrease in the resistor voltage occurs because the sum 
of the capacitor voltage and the resistor voltage at any instant must be equal to the applied
voltage, in compliance with Kirchhoff’s voltage law 
This part of the re-
sponse is illustrated in Figure 22(c).
Response to Falling Edge When tW
5
Let’s examine the case in which the capaci-
tor is fully charged at the end of the pulse 
Refer to Figure 22(d). On the 
falling edge, the input pulse suddenly goes from 
back to zero. An instant before the
falling edge, the capacitor is charged to 10 V, so point A is 
and point B is 0 V. The
voltage across a capacitor cannot change instantaneously, so when point A makes a transi-
tion from 
to zero on the falling edge, point B must also make a 10 V transition from
zero to 
This keeps the voltage across the capacitor at 10 V for the instant of the
falling edge.
The capacitor now begins to discharge exponentially. As a result, the resistor voltage
goes from 
to zero in an exponential curve, as indicated in red in Figure 22(d).
Response During Pulse When tW
5
When the pulse width is less than five time
constants (
), the capacitor does not have time to fully charge. Its partial charge de-
pends on the relation of the time constant and the pulse width.
Because the capacitor does not reach the full 
the resistor voltage will not reach
zero volts by the end of the pulse. For example, if the capacitor charges to 
during the
pulse interval, the resistor voltage will decrease to 
as illustrated in Figure 22(e).
Response to Falling Edge When tW
5
Now, let’s examine the case in which the ca-
pacitor is only partially charged at the end of the pulse 
For example, if the ca-
pacitor charges to 
the resistor voltage at the instant before the falling edge is also
because the capacitor voltage plus the resistor voltage must add up to 
as
illustrated in Figure 22(e).
When the falling edge occurs, point A goes from 
to zero. As a result, point B
goes from 
to 
as illustrated in Figure 22(f). This decrease occurs, of course,
because the capacitor voltage cannot change at the instant of the falling edge. Immediately
after the falling edge, the capacitor begins to discharge to zero. As a result, the resistor volt-
age goes from 
to zero, as shown.
Summary of RC Differentiator Response to a Single Pulse
A good way to summarize this section is to look at the general output waveforms of a dif-
ferentiator as the time constant is varied from one extreme, when 
is much less than the
pulse width, to the other extreme, when

RESPONSE OF RL INTEGRATORS TO PULSE INPUTS
A series RL circuit in which the output voltage is taken across the resistor is known as
an integrator in terms of time response. Although only the response to a single pulse is
discussed, it can be extended to repetitive pulses, as described for the RC integrator.
After completing this section, you should be able to
◆Analyze the operation of an RL integrator
◆Determine the response to a single input pulse
Figure 32 shows an RL integrator. The output waveform is taken across the resistor 
and, under equivalent conditions, is the same shape as that for the RC integrator. Recall that
in the RC case, the output was across the capacitor.
888

TIME RESPONSE OF REACTIVE CIRCUITS
As you know, each edge of an ideal pulse is considered to be instantaneous. Two basic
rules for inductor behavior will aid in analyzing RL circuit responses to pulse inputs:
1. The inductor appears as an open to an instantaneous change in current and as a
short (ideally) to dc.
2. The current in an inductor cannot change instantaneously—it can change only ex-
ponentially.
Response of the RL Integrator to a Single Pulse
When a pulse generator is connected to the input of the integrator and the voltage pulse
goes from its low level to its high level, the inductor prevents a sudden change in current.
As a result, the inductor acts as an open, and all of the input voltage is across it at the in-
stant of the rising pulse edge. This situation is indicated in Figure 33(a).

TIME RESPONSE OF REACTIVE CIRCUITS
After the rising edge, the current builds up, and the output voltage follows the current as
it increases exponentially, as shown in Figure 33(b). The current can reach a maximum 
of 
if the transient time is shorter than the pulse width (
in this example).
When the pulse goes from its high level to its low level, an induced voltage with re-
versed polarity is created across the coil in an effort to keep the current equal to 
The
output voltage begins to decrease exponentially, as shown in Figure 33(c).
The exact shape of the output depends on the 
time constant as summarized in Figure
34 for various relationships between the time constant and the pulse width. You should 
note that the response of this RL circuit in terms of the shape of the output is identical to
that of the RC integrator. The relationship of the 
time constant to the input pulse width
has the same effect as the RC time constant that was shown in Figure 4. For example,

Illustration of the response of an RL differentiator for both time constant conditions.
During the pulse, the current exponentially builds up. As a result, the inductor voltage
decreases, as shown in Figure 41(b). The rate of decrease, as you know, depends on the 
L/R time constant. When the falling edge of the input occurs, the inductor reacts to keep the
current as is, by creating an induced voltage in a direction as indicated in Figure 41(c). 
This reaction is seen as a sudden negative-going transition of the inductor voltage, as indi-
cated in Figure 41(c) and (d).
Two conditions are possible, as indicated in Figure 41(c) and (d). In part (c),
is
greater than the input pulse width, and the output voltage does not have time to decay to
zero. In part (d),
is less than or equal to the pulse width, and so the output decays to zero
before the end of the pulse. In this case a -10 V transition occurs at the trailing edge.
Keep in mind that as far as the input and output waveforms are concerned, the RL inte-
grator and differentiator perform the same as their RC counterparts.

RELATIONSHIP OF TIME RESPONSE TO FREQUENCY RESPONSE
A definite relationship exists between time (pulse) response and frequency response.
The fast rising and falling edges of a pulse waveform contain the higher frequency
components. The flatter portions of the pulse waveform, which are the tops and the
baseline of the pulses, represent slow changes or lower frequency components. The
average value of the pulse waveform is its dc component.
After completing this section, you should be able to

TIME RESPONSE OF REACTIVE CIRCUITS
The Integrator
RC Integrator
In terms of frequency response, the RC integrator acts as a low-pass fil-
ter. As you learned, the RC integrator tends to exponentially “round off” the edges of the
applied pulses. This rounding off occurs to varying degrees, depending on the relationship
of the time constant to the pulse width and period. The rounding off of the edges indicates
that the integrator tends to reduce the higher frequency components of the pulse waveform,
as illustrated in Figure 48.

RL Integrator
Like the RC integrator, the RL integrator also acts as a basic low-pass fil-

is small
for low frequencies and offers little opposition. It increases with frequency, so at higher fre-
quencies most of the total voltage is dropped across L and very little across R, the output.

The Differentiator
RC Differentiator
In terms of frequency response, the RC differentiator acts as a high-
pass filter. As you know, the differentiator tends to introduce tilt to the flat portion of a
pulse. That is, it tends to reduce the lower frequency components of a pulse waveform.
Also, it completely eliminates the dc component of the input and produces a zero average-
value output. This action is illustrated in Figure 50.
RL Differentiator
Again like the RC differentiator, the RL differentiator also acts as a
basic high-pass filter. Because L is connected across the output, less voltage is developed

dc (ignoring winding resistance). For high frequencies, most of the input voltage is dropped

Leaky Capacitor
If the capacitor in an RC integrator becomes leaky, three things happen: (a) the time con-
stant will be effectively reduced by the leakage resistance (when thevenized, looking from
C it appears in parallel with R); (b) the waveshape of the output voltage (across C) is
altered from normal by a shorter charging time; and (c) the amplitude of the output is
reduced because R and 
effectively act as a voltage divider. These effects are illus-
trated in Figure 53(a).

Application Activity
In this application activity, you are
asked to build and test a time-delay
circuit that will provide five switch-
selectable delay times. An RC integra-
tor is selected for this application. The input is a 5 V pulse of
long duration, and the output goes to a threshold trigger circuit
that is used to turn the power on to a portion of a system at any
of the five selected time intervals after the occurrence of the
original pulse.
A schematic of the selectable time-delay integrating circuit
is shown in Figure 56. The RC integrator is driven by a 
pulse input; and the output is an exponentially increasing volt-
age that is used to trigger a threshold circuit at the 3.5 V level,
which then turns power on to part of a system. The basic con-
cept is shown in Figure 57. In this application, the delay 
time of the integrator is specified to be the time from the ris-
ing edge of the input pulse to the point where the output volt-
age reaches 3.5 V. The specified delay times are as listed in
Table 1.

THREE-PHASE SYSTEMS IN POWER APPLICATIONS
The size of the copper wire required to carry current from a generator to a load can be
reduced when a three-phase rather than a single-phase generator is used.
Figure is a simplified representation of a single-phase generator connected to a resistive
load. The coil symbol represents the generator winding.
For example, a single-phase sinusoidal voltage is induced in the winding and applied to
a 
load, as indicated in Figure 2. The resulting load current is

The total current that must be delivered by the generator to the load is 
A. This
means that the two conductors carrying current to and from the load must each be capable
of handling 2 A; thus, the total copper cross section must handle 4 A. (The copper cross sec-
tion is a measure of the total amount of wire required based on its physical size as related
to its diameter.) The total load power is

This is the same total load power as delivered by the single-phase system previously
discussed.
Notice that four conductors, including the neutral, are required to carry the currents to
and from the loads. The current in each of the three conductors is 667 mA, as indicated in
Figure 4(a). The current in the neutral conductor is the phasor sum of the three load cur-
rents and is equal to zero, as shown in the following equation, with reference to the phasor
diagram in Figure 4(b).
This condition, where all load currents are equal and the neutral current is zero, is called a
balanced load condition.

This result shows that considerably less copper is required to deliver the same load power
with a three-phase system than is required for the single-phase system. The amount of

THREE-PHASE SYSTEMS IN POWER APPLICATIONS
A second advantage of three-phase systems over a single-phase system is that three-
phase systems produce a constant amount of power in the load. As shown in Figure 5, the
load power fluctuates as the square of the sinusoidal voltage divided by the resistance. It
changes from a maximum of 
to a minimum of zero at a frequency equal to
twice that of the voltage.

In many applications, ac generators are used to drive ac motors for conversion of elec-
trical energy to mechanical energy in the form of shaft rotation in the motor. The original
energy for operation of the generator can come from any of several sources, such as hy-
droelectric or steam. Figure 7 illustrates the basic concept.

Simple example of mechanical-

When a three-phase generator is connected to the motor windings, a magnetic field is
created within the motor that has a constant flux density and that rotates at the frequency of
the three-phase sine wave. The motor’s rotor is pulled around at a constant rotational ve-
locity by the rotating magnetic field, producing a constant shaft rotation, which is an ad-
vantage of three-phase systems.
A single-phase system is unsuitable for many applications because it produces a mag-
netic field that fluctuates in flux density and reverses direction during each cycle without
providing the advantage of constant rotation.

TYPES OF THREE-PHASE GENERATORS
In the previous sections, the Y-connection was used for illustration. In this section, the
Y-connection is examined further and a second type, the -connection, is introduced.
After completing this section, you should be able to

The Y-Connected Generator
A Y-connected system can be either a three-wire or, when the neutral is used, a four-wire
system, as shown in Figure 8, connected to a generalized load, which is indicated by the
green block. Recall that when the loads are perfectly balanced, the neutral current is zero;
therefore, the neutral conductor is unnecessary. However, in cases where the loads are not
equal (unbalanced), a neutral wire is essential to provide a return current path because the
neutral current has a nonzero value.
921

THREE-PHASE SYSTEMS IN POWER APPLICATIONS
The voltages across the generator windings are called phase voltages (Vu), and the cur-
rents through the windings are called phase currents (Iu). Also, the currents in the lines
connecting the generator windings to the load are called line currents (IL), and the volt-
ages across the lines are called the line voltages (VL). Note that the magnitude of each line
current is equal to the corresponding phase current in the Y-connected circuit.

THREE-PHASE SYSTEMS IN POWER APPLICATIONS
The -Connected Generator
In the Y-connected generator, two voltage magnitudes are available at the terminals in the
four-wire system: the phase voltage and the line voltage. Also, in the Y-connected genera-
tor, the line current is equal to the phase current. Keep these characteristics in mind as you
examine the -connected generator.
The windings of a three-phase generator can be rearranged to form a -connected gen-
erator, as shown in Figure 14. By examination of this diagram, you can see that the magni-
tudes of the line voltages and phase voltages are equal, but the line currents do not equal
the phase currents.

An important feature of a Y-connected source is that two different values of three-phase
voltage are available: the phase voltage and the line voltage. For example, in the standard
power distribution system, a three-phase transformer can be considered a source of three-phase
voltage supplying 120 V and 208 V. In order to utilize a phase voltage of 120 V, the loads are
connected in the Y configuration. A -connected load is used for the 208 V line voltages.
Notice in the Y-Y system in Figure 20 that the phase current, the line current, and the
load current are all equal in each phase. Also, each load voltage equals the corresponding
phase voltage. These relationships are expressed as follows and are true for either a bal-
anced or an unbalanced load.

Power Measurement
Power is measured in three-phase systems using wattmeters. The wattmeter uses a basic
electrodynamometer-type movement consisting of two coils. One coil is used to measure
the current, and the other is used to measure the voltage. Figure 29 shows a basic wattmeter
schematic and the connections for measuring power in a load. The resistor in series with the
voltage coil limits the current through the coil to a small amount proportional to the volt-
age across the coil.

If the load is balanced, the total power is simply three times the reading on any one wattmeter.
In many three-phase loads, particularly the 
configuration, it is difficult to connect a
wattmeter such that the voltage coil is across the load or such that the current coil is in
series with the load because of inaccessibility of points within the load.
Two-Wattmeter Method
Another method of three-phase power measurement uses only
two wattmeters. The connections for this two-wattmeter method are shown in Figure 31.
Notice that the voltage coil of each wattmeter is connected across a line voltage and that the
current coil has a line current through it. It can be shown that the algebraic sum of the two
wattmeter readings equals the total power in the Y- or -connected load.

RMS (Effective) Value of a Sine Wave
The abbreviation “rms” stands for the root mean square process by which this value is de-
rived. In the process, we first square the equation of a sine wave.
Next, we obtain the mean or average value of 
by dividing the area under a half-cycle
of the curve by 
(see Figure 1). The area is found by integration and trigonometric 
identities.

Average Value of a Half-Cycle Sine Wave
The average value of a sine wave is determined for a half-cycle because the average over a
full cycle is zero.
The equation for a sine wave is
The average value of the half-cycle is the area under the curve divided by the distance of
the curve along the horizontal axis (see Figure 2).

As electronic circuits and systems become more advanced, circuit designers rely on com-
puters in the design process. It is essential for engineers and technicians to systematically
design, simulate, prototype, and lay out the circuit. Students can also use the engineering
and design process to reinforce concepts and theory in the classroom. The three stages of
the student design process are illustrated in Figure 1.

NI MULTISIM FOR CIRCUIT SIMULATION
The National Instruments Electronics Education Platform is an end-to-end tool-chain
designed to meet student and educator needs. The platform consists of NI Multisim simu-
lation software, the NI Educational Laboratory Virtual Instrumentation Suite (NI ELVIS)
prototyping workstation, and the NI LabVIEW graphical programming environment. NI
Multisim provides intuitive schematic capture, SPICE simulation, and integration with the
NI ELVIS to help students explore circuit theory and design circuits to investigate behav-
ior. NI ELVIS is a prototyping platform that allows students to quickly and easily create
their circuits. With NI LabVIEW, students can measure real-world signals and compare
simulation results.
1. Investigate Theory
Learn the fundamental theory of circuit design through the
Principles of Electric Circuits textbook and course lectures. Reinforce important concepts
in the easy-to-use Multisim environment by downloading the Multisim circuit files for the
textbook. The Multisim circuit files help build the foundation for an in-depth understand-
ing of circuit behavior. Using the prebuilt circuit files, simulate and analyze the circuit be-
havior of examples and problems in each chapter.
2. Design and Simulate
Circuit simulation provides an interactive view into a circuit.
Build a circuit from scratch and learn about the design performance using built-in circuit
instruments and probes in an ideal pre-laboratory environment. With the 3D breadboard in
Multisim, take the leap from circuit diagram to real-world physical implementation.
3. Prototype, Measure, and Compare
Hands-on experience building physical circuitry
is essential. Move from the 3D breadboard in Multisim to a real-world breadboard on NI
ELVIS to seamlessly complete the entire design process by prototyping the circuit. Within
the LabVIEW environment, compare real-world measurements to the simulation values to
reinforce theory, fully understand circuit behavior, and build the foundations of profes-
sional engineering analysis.
NI Multisim
Multisim software integrates powerful SPICE simulation and schematic capture into a
highly intuitive electronics lab on the computer. Use the Multisim Student Edition to enhance
learning by:
Building circuits in a simple, easy-to-learn environment
Simulating and analyzing circuits for homework and prelab assignments
Breadboarding in 3D at home before lab sessions
Creating designs of up to 50 components using a library of nearly 4,000 devices
Integrating with the NI ELVIS prototyping workstation
While using industry-standard SPICE in the background, you can take advantage of the
Multisim drag-and-drop interface to make circuit drawing, wiring, and analysis simple and
easy to use. You can build circuits from scratch and learn about design performances using
built-in virtual instruments and probes in an ideal environment for experimentation. With
the 3D breadboard, you can easily take the leap from circuit diagram to real-world
implementation.
Using Multisim with Principles of Electric Circuits
Create an example from the text-
book to get familiar with the Multisim environment. First, launch Multisim and open a new
schematic window (File 
New 
Schematic Capture). Design circuits in the circuit
window by placing components from the component toolbar. Clicking on the component
toolbar opens the component browser. Choose the family of components and select an in-
dividual component to place on the circuit window by double-clicking on it. 
Once you have selected a component, it attaches itself and “ghosts” the mouse cursor.
Place the component by clicking again on the desired location in the schematic. If you are

NI MULTISIM FOR CIRCUIT SIMULATION
new to Multisim, you should use the BASIC_VIRTUAL family of components, which you
can assign any arbitrary value. As an example of a simple Multisim circuit, an RLC circuit
is shown in Figure 2. The circuit connects a 1 k resistor, a 47 mH inductor, and a 10 nF
capacitor. All these components are found in the Basic Group of the Component Database. 
The next step is to wire the components together. Simply left-click on the source termi-
nal and left-click on the destination terminal. Multisim automatically chooses the best path
for the virtual wire between the two terminals. Always be sure you have fully captured your
circuit; then you can simulate it. You can use your simulation results as a comparison with
the physical circuit.
To analyze the circuit, use a measurement probe to measure the voltages and other char-
acteristics from the circuit while the simulation is running. Use the virtual oscilloscope to
analyze the output signal from our sample RLC circuit.
NI ELVIS
NI ELVIS is a LabVIEW-based design and prototyping environment based on LabVIEW
for university science and engineering laboratories. NI ELVIS consists of virtual instru-
ments, or functions, based on LabVIEW; a multifunction data acquisition device; and a
custom-designed benchtop workstation and prototyping board. This combination provides
a ready-to-use suite of instruments for educational laboratories. The NI ELVIS workstation
is shown in Figure 3.
NI ELVIS is an ideal companion to any electronics lab that uses Multisim. It features
USB connectivity for easy setup, maintenance, and portability, as well as a portable bread-
board for real-world circuit prototyping.

 FIGURE 4
Prototyped circuit in multisim.
NI ELVIS features a breadboard prototyping environment with built-in instruments in-
cluding a function generator, digital multimeter (DMM), oscilloscope, and variable power
supplies. The breadboard is detachable, so you can work on your projects and labs inde-
pendently of the NI ELVIS unit. NI ELVIS provides software based on LabVIEW for in-
teracting with virtual instruments.
Using NI ELVIS with Principles of Electric Circuits
Returning to the RLC circuit in-
troduced with Multisim as an example, you can continue the prototyping step. With proto-
typing hardware, you can quickly construct a circuit on a standard protoboard and test it
with the laboratory instruments to complete the design. 
Alternatively, you can repeat the simulation step but this time as a prototype using the
Virtual 3D NI ELVIS from within Multisim. To construct a 3D NI ELVIS prototype, open
the 3D breadboard by clicking Tools 
Show Breadboard. Place components and wires
to build up your circuit. The corresponding connection points and symbols on the NI
ELVIS schematic turn green, indicating the 3D connections are correct. If you create a tra-
ditional schematic, you see a standard breadboard. Figure 4 shows the circuit on 3D Virtual

NI MULTISIM FOR CIRCUIT SIMULATION
NI ELVIS prototyped in Multisim and ready for construction. Once you have verified the
layout of your circuit using the 3D virtual environment, you can physically build it on NI
ELVIS.
After constructing the circuit, you can use the NI ELVIS instrument launcher to meas-
ure the output signal of this circuit. Figure 5 shows the simulated signal of the RLC circuit
on the Multisim oscilloscope. Figure 6 shows the measured signal using the ELVIS II Os-
cilloscope. The most important step in the process is to compare the measurement of the
prototyped circuit to the simulation. This helps you determine where potential errors exist
in the design. After comparing the measurement with the theoretical values, you can revisit
your design to improve it or prepare it for layout on a PCB board, using software such as
NI Ultiboard.
