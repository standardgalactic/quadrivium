With numerous applications 
spanning several ields and 
industries, Photoshop is without doubt 
a vast piece of software. Many have 
spent years learning it, and have still 
not come close to mastering every tool, 
command and technique. As such, it 
would be impossible to learn such a 
behemoth of a program in a single day. 
But what you can do, even as a 
beginner, is get started, explore a few 
fundamentals and get set up to go 
further. So over the following pages 
you’ll ind a series of lessons; none 
should take more than an hour.
If you’re completely new to 
Photoshop, or in need of a refresher, 
these lessons (and their accompanying 
videos) will guide you through those 
tricky irst stages of learning, laying a 
foundation for further exploration into 
the wonderful world of image editing...

https://goo.gl/CkfMgj
The Photoshop interface can seem a 
little daunting at irst glance. There 
are all manner of tools, panels and menus on 
show, and many more tucked away. So in our 
irst lesson, we’ll acquaint ourselves with the 
Photoshop workspace and explore a few 
basic fundamentals of image editing. We’ll 
explain exactly which parts of the interface 
are most useful to the beginner, then guide 
you through a few simple edits...
LESSON TIME:  
1 HOUR
SKILLS COVERED: 
NAVIGATION, CROPPING, 
SELECTIONS

For your irst task, get to know the Photoshop interface…
THE WORKSPACE
1 THE TOOLS PANEL
This houses all the 
Photoshop tools. There 
are more tools than initially 
apparent – click and hold over 
a tool to see the rest of the 
set. Hover over a tool to see 
useful keyboard shortcuts.
2 IMAGE WINDOW
To open images go to 
FIle > Open or simply drag 
the ile into the workspace. 
Hold Cmd/Ctrl+Space and 
drag left or right over it to 
zoom in or out. Hold Space 
and drag to scroll around

3 PANELS
Many key Photoshop 
tasks and functions come 
about through these panels. 
These can be dragged, 
docked and tabbed in any 
combination you like. Access 
the full list of panels through 
the Window menu. 
4 WORKSPACE
The dropdown list 
here contains several 
workspace presets, which 
are combinations of panels 
that are relevant to certain 
editing tasks. 
5 MENUS
The list of menus at 
the top give you access to all 
kinds of adjustments, efects 
and other settings, as well 
as all the save/open/export 
options you’d expect to ind.
6 TOOL OPTIONS
Select any tool and the 
options along the top of the 
screen will change to show 
the tool settings. With the 
Crop tool selected here, for 
example, you can set crop 
measurements, the ratio and 
the resolution.

Open any image then 
grab the Crop tool 
from the Tools panel. Go to 
the tool options at the top 
then select a ratio – we’ll use 
1:1 here to create a pleasing 
square crop.
Drag the crop box to 
change its size and move the 
image within to tweak the 
crop position. When you’re 
happy, double-click or press 
Return to apply.
CROP 
A PHOTO

Open enhance_sky.jpg. Grab the Quick Selection tool from the Tools panel. This 
tool helps you select shapes. Paint to select the sky, then go to the Layers panel 
(Window > Layers). Click the Create Adjustment Layer icon at the bottom and choose Hue/
Saturation. Increase the saturation to boost the sky.
SELECT AND EDIT

Open dodge_burn.jpg then go to the Layers panel (Window > Layers) and drag the 
layer to the New Layer icon at the bottom to make a copy. Grab the Dodge tool from 
the Tools panel. In the tool options, set Range to Highlights and Exposure to 15%, then paint 
to lighten areas. Switch to the Burn tool, set Range to Midtones, and paint to darken areas.
DODGE AND BURN

Enhance your photos with simple tonal edits  
and get to grips with Adjustment Layers
LESSON 2
TONE AND COLOR
One of the most important things you 
can do to a photo is enhance the 
tones. Straight out of camera, photos can 
often look ﬂat and dull, but a few tweaks 
can make a world of diference.
Adjustment Layers let you tone your 
image in diferent ways, such as a boost in 
contrast, a color tweak or a monochrome 
conversion. They work by occupying a 
separate layer in the Layers panel, and 
afect all the layers below them in the stack. 
This’ll be your irst encounter with layers. 
They form the foundation on which almost 
everything in Photoshop functions. If the 
concept seems diicult to grasp at irst, 
don’t worry: we’ll look at layers in more 
detail in the next lesson.
It is possible to apply these kinds of tonal 
edits directly to an image layer, but it makes 
more sense to keep them separate by using 
Adjustment Layers. They help you to form 
a non-destructive, layer-based workﬂow, 
so that any adjustments you make can be 
edited whenever you choose. It’s this ability 
Photoshop gives you to edit photos with the 
freedom to try diferent things and take your 
images in diferent directions that makes the 
non-destructive workﬂow so vital.
What’s more, keeping your adjustments 
on separate layers gives you plenty of other 
beneits. You can experiment with layer 
blend modes, use a mask to conine the 
adjustment to a particular area of the photo, 
or simply alter the layer opacity to control 
the strength of the efect.
In this project, we’ll explore the key 
beneits of using adjustment layers. First 
you’ll use Levels to add contrast, then you’ll 
convert to monochrome, and inally you’ll 
selectively change the color of the dress.
LESSON TIME:  
1 HOUR
SKILLS COVERED: TONAL 
ADJUSTMENTS, BLACK 
AND WHITE, BLEND MODES, 
LAYER MASKING
WATCH THE VIDEO
https://goo.gl/GMAFD8

01 MAKE AN 
ADJUSTMENT 
LAYER 
Open dress_before.
jpg into Photoshop. 
Bring up the Layers 
panel (Window > 
Layers) and then 
click the Create 
Adjustment Layer icon 
at the bottom. Choose 
Levels. The Properties 
panel will appear. 
It’ll show the Levels 
settings you need. 

02 ENHANCE 
THE TONES 
Drag in the black point 
slider while holding 
Alt. This’ll give you a 
view of ‘clipped’ pixels. 
The image should ﬂirt 
around the edges of 
clipping, for a full tonal 
range, so drag until 
just before the clipped 
pixels begin to appear. 
Do the same with the 
white point slider.
03 CONVERT 
TO MONO 
Click the Create 
Adjustment Layer icon 
and choose Black and 
White. Experiment with 
the color sliders – these 
control the brightness 
of colors during the 
mono conversion. You 
can also use the hand 
icon in Properties to 
drag over parts of the 
image to alter colors.
04 CHANGE THE 
BLENDING 
Next you’ll change the 
Blend mode of the layer 
for a high-contrast 
efect. Click the Blend 
Mode dropdown at 
the top of the Layers 
panel and change it to 
Overlay. The efect is 
slightly too strong, so 
drag to the left across 
the word ‘Opacity’ to 
knock it down slightly.

05 ADJUST THE HUE 
Click the Create Adjustment Layer icon 
again and choose Hue/Saturation. Drag the 
Hue slider to change the colors in the image 
– pay attention to how it afects the clothes 
and ignore everything else. Next, press Cmd/
Ctrl+I. Notice how the mask thumbnail on the 
layer turns black. This hides the efect behind 
a layer  mask.
06 PAINT A MASK 
Grab the Brush tool from the Tools 
panel. Press D to reset the color to black, then 
X to change it to white. Right-click and set 
hardness to 0, then start painting over the 
dress. Use ] and [ to change the brush size 
as you paint. Paint with white to reveal the 
change in color over the area – don’t worry 
about going over the edges for now.
07 FINISH THE MASK 
Press X to ﬂip your color to black, then 
zoom in closer (hold Cmd/Ctrl+Space and drag 
right to zoom in, left to zoom out). Make the 
brush size smaller and paint with black to hide 
parts of the adjustment where you went over 
the edges before. Keep going until the dress 
is precisely isolated by the mask.
08 TWEAK THE COLORS 
The great thing about using 
Adjustment Layers is that nothing is ever set 
in stone: you can alter any setting at any time. 
Go to the Layers panel and double-click the 
layer thumbnail on the Hue/Saturation Layer 
to bring up the settings again. Adjust the Hue 
to give the clothes a diferent color. 

One of the very best things about 
Photoshop is the opportunity it gives 
you to create unreal images and fantastical 
efects. Often this involves piecing together 
parts from two or more photos to come up 
with a seamless whole. In this lesson, we’ll 
explain how to make a fun composite. First 
we’ll look at the starting photos, then explain 
how to piece them together using layer and 
masking skills. It might look complicated, but 
it’s something even a complete beginner can 
do with a few simple pointers…

MAKE FUN COMPOSITES

Layers are the foundation on which so many Photoshop techniques rest. It can be 
helpful to think of layers as pieces of tracing paper, which can contain areas of 
transparency and solid detail. This is crucial when making composites as it means you can 
build the efect simply by hiding or revealing certain areas of each of your starting images.
Here’s how a composite comes together over several layers...

01 COPY A PIECE 
Open the headless 1, 2 and 3 
start images in Photoshop. Go to 
headless02. Grab the Lasso tool 
from the Tools panel. Drag over 
the area around the leg on the 
right to make a rough selection. 
Once that’s done, grab the Move 
tool from the Tools panel. Drag 
the area up to the tab of the 
headless01 image then down 
and in to copy it over.
02 POSITION THE LAYER 
Use the Move tool to 
position the piece in place. 
You might ind it helpful here 
to temporarily drop the layer 
opacity so that you can see how 
to line it up with the underlying 
background layer. Press Cmd/
Ctrl+T for Transform if you need 
to resize or rotate the piece into 
place, then press Return to apply 
the Transform.
03 ADD A MASK 
Click the Add Layer Mask 
icon at the bottom of the Layers 
panel then grab the Brush tool 
and press D to set its color to 
black. Zoom in close and paint 
in a mask to hide the edges of 
the layer, so that you end up 
with a seamless blend with the 
underlying base image. If you go 
wrong at all, press X and paint 
with white to reveal areas.

PIECE IT TOGETHER

04 WARP THE 
COLLAR 
Go to headless03. 
Roughly select the 
collar with the Lasso 
tool then drag it in to 
the main image with 
the Move tool. Lower 
the layer opacity, then 
press Cmd/Ctrl+T to 
transform. Right-click 
and choose Warp, 
then drag the grid to 
warp the shape to it.
05 BLEND THE 
COLLAR 
Drag the opacity of the 
layer back up to 100%. 
Add a Layer Mask and 
paint with black to hide 
parts of the collar layer 
until it blends with 
those below. Press 
Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Alt+E 
to merge a copy of all 
the layers into one. 
Grab the Spot Healing 
Brush tool.
06 TIDY UP 
Paint over the 
remaining part of the 
head to remove it. 
Switch to the Clone tool 
to tidy up any messy 
patches. (Hold Alt to 
sample a source to 
clone from.) Go to Filter 
> Camera Raw Filter 
and use the controls 
in the Basic panel to 
enhance the tones and 
increase contrast.

Blending modes are among the most 
useful of Photoshop features, and 
they’re also very easy to use. They let you 
blend the pixels on one layer with those 
below in a variety of ways. With our example 
shot on the next page, you can blend so that 
only the lighter pixels show through, which 
makes it easy to add ireworks to a night sky.
This is a fun technique to try if you’d like 
to create an atmosphere of celebration, or if 
you fancy bolstering a lackluster ireworks 
display with a few extra explosions, or if you 
simply want to learn fundamental Photoshop 
skills. You’ll drop the ireworks into an image, 
position them in the sky and blend with 
either the Screen or Lighten Blend Mode. 
Then you can use a Layer Mask to hide parts 
of the display where they would naturally fall 
behind objects in the foreground, cementing 
the illusion that they’re in the sky.

01 DROP IT IN 
Open ireworks_base 
and ireworks01 into 
Photoshop. Grab the Move 
tool from the Tools panel 
then drag the ireworks 
image up to the tab of the 
main image, then down 
inside the window to copy 
the layer over.

03 CONTROL THE 
BRIGHTNESS 
Go to Image >  
Adjustments > Levels  
or press Cmd/Ctrl+L. 
In the Levels box, drag 
the black point across 
until the green smoke 
disappears. Click OK 
to apply. Add more 
ireworks in the same 
way until you have as 
many as you like.
02 BLEND WITH 
LIGHTEN 
Go to the Layers panel 
(Window > Layers), 
click the Blend Mode 
dropdown at the top, 
and change it from 
Normal to Lighten. 
Press Cmd/Ctrl+T then 
use the bounding box 
to transform, resize 
and position the 
layer in the sky. Press 
Return to apply.
04 TUCK IT BEHIND 
Highlight the 
bottom layer and press 
Cmd/Ctrl+J to make a 
copy, then drag this to 
the top of the stack. 
Grab the Magic Wand 
tool. Set Tolerance to 
about 8 then hold Shift 
and click repeatedly 
over the sky to select it 
all. Hold Alt and click the 
Add Layer Mask icon in 
the Layers Panel.

This task is slightly diferent from the 
others: it’s more like an assignment. 
Grab your camera and take a couple of dozen 
photos of a person, or alternatively use an 
existing set of pictures. We’ll take you 
through a complete workﬂow, from sorting 
your set of photos and choosing your 
favorites using Bridge, to making a few key 
edits in Camera Raw before opening your 
favorites in Photoshop for retouching.

A COMPLETE WORKFLOW
WATCH THE VIDEO
https://goo.gl/D2g1et

Open Adobe Bridge and navigate to a 
set of photos. (You can drag one of 
the iles onto the Adobe Bridge icon to 
quickly open the set.) Adobe Bridge is 
Photoshop’s ile browser and image 
organizer. You can add a star rating or 
keyword your favorite images, then open 
them in Photoshop (or Camera Raw for raw 
iles). Tap the arrow keys to go through your 
photos. When you ind one you like, press 
Cmd/Ctrl and a number between 1 and 5 to 
give it a star rating. Once done, click the ilter 
icon at the top and choose to ilter the 
images to only show those that are rated.
SORT YOUR SET

Shift-click between the irst and last 
photo to select them, then right-click 
over them and choose Open In Camera Raw. 
This’ll open Photoshop’s Camera Raw plugin. 
It’s the ideal place to start editing raw iles, 
and it works with JPEGs too. Choose a photo 
on the left, then experiment with the tonal 
sliders on the right to adjust the image. 
Nothing is ever set in stone with Camera 
Raw, so you can experiment with diferent 
adjustments and reset them later if you need 
to. If you like, you can sync the adjustment to 
the other photos by clicking the ﬂyout menu 
at the top left.
CAMERA RAW ADJUSTMENTS

Choose your favorite photo from the 
ilmstrip, then click the Open Image 
button to bring it into Photoshop. You’ll 
retouch your portrait here. Go to the Layers 
panel and click the New Layer icon, then grab 
the Spot Healing Brush tool. Check Sample 
All Layers in the options, then paint to 
remove spots and blemishes. Next, click the 
Create Adjustment Layer icon and choose 
Levels. Squeeze in the black and white points 
as shown to boost contrast, then press Cmd/
Ctrl+I to invert the layer’s mask to black. Grab 
the Brush tool and paint white over areas to 
reveal the adjustment.
PHOTOSHOP RETOUCHING

Discover four simple retouching tricks for swift, efective tidying 
of any messy or stray hairs around your subject’s head
FIX THE FRIZZ
Frizzy hair can be a real challenge 
to retouch, especially if stray hairs 
sprout out from the edges of the 
head. The tips here will help to ix 
the frizz, but it’s best to get things 
looking as perfect as possible at the 
time of shooting. A quick spray with a 
de-frizzing hair product could save 20 
minutes of painstaking retouching.
Another factor is lighting. If the 
subject is backlit – either by the sun 
or artiicial lighting – then the light 
will pick up edge hairs that can cause 
problems later. Similarly, contrasting 
backdrops – for example dark hair 
against a lighter background like this – 
will also emphasise any frizz.
Be extra-vigilant about ixing 
the hair before you start shooting. 
However, you don’t need to worry 
about every single hair: you’ve got 
Photoshop for that...

01 HEAL THE HAIRS
The Spot Healing tool can work 
wonders over stray hairs. Grab the tool and 
set it to Sample All Layers, then make a new 
layer. If it’s a straight hair, save time by Shift-
clicking from one end to the other. The tool 
can go wrong at the root of the stray. If so, 
use the Clone tool (S) – also set to Sample All 
Layers – to ‘disconnect’ the base, then heal 
the rest with the Spot Healing tool (J).
03 NATURAL CURVES
Grab the Pen tool, then drag to add 
anchor points along the edges of the head. 
Add a couple more points to loop the end 
point back to the start, then right-click it, 
choose Make Selection and Feather by 0.5. 
Next, grab the Clone tool. Alt-click to sample 
the background and clone it to remove the 
stray hairs, leaving a perfect curved edge. 
In fact, it might be too perfect....
02 SQUEEZE IN THE HEAD
This technique is for a quick ix when 
there are bulges or a mess of tangled hairs 
along the head. First, merge a new layer (Ctrl/
Cmd+Shift+Alt+E) then go to Filter > Liquify. 
Grab the Forward Warp tool from top left, 
then use a large brush tip and push in the 
messy edges of the head. If necessary, paint 
over the face with the Freeze Mask tool (F) 
beforehand to protect the pixels there.
04 PAINT IN STRAYS
After using the Pen or Liquify tools to 
create a neat curve to the edge of the head, 
make it look more realistic by painting in a 
few loose strands. Make a new layer, then 
grab the Brush tool and Alt-click to sample a 
hair color. Using a very small brush size and 
50% brush opacity, paint in smooth strokes 
along the edge. (A pen and tablet help here – 
tick the Pressure For Size tool option.)

James Paterson transforms a daytime scene to night 
– complete with starry sky and glowing windows – 
with Photoshop toning and layer tricks
MAKE A NIGHT OF IT
 DOWNLOAD THE PROJECT FILES HERE https://goo.gl/WPmPQx ON YOUR PC OR MAC 
This efect will appeal if you’ve ever thought 
to yourself, “I wish this day would just end!” 
Using simple Photoshop skills, you can transform 
a sunny daytime scene to darkest night.
The purist would argue that this is a 
pointless exercise. Why not just go back 
after dark with a tripod and capture the 
scene? Of course, this would be the best 
thing to do. (Not only would it be more 
realistic, it would also probably take less 
time.) But there could be any number of 
reasons why this wouldn’t be possible. 
Perhaps you won’t be able to return at 
night, which was the case here: our visit 
to the Cuban town of Trinidad was just 
a quick half-day stop-of. 
Besides, there are plenty of 
transferable skills on demand 
here that will hold you in good 
stead for all kinds of Photoshop 
projects. If you’re new to 
Photoshop, these 
techniques will 
introduce many 
fundamental 
features, such 
as layer masks, 
adjustment layers 
and toning. You’ll 
use masks to drop 
in a star-studded 
sky, then adjust the 
tones for a night-time hue. Finally, 
you’ll give the windows an inviting glow.

Restoring an old photo 
is one of the most 
satisfying jobs you can do 
in Photoshop. It’s deeply 
rewarding to breathe new life 
into damaged ancient prints, 
so that they can be cherished 
for years to come. Whether 
you do it for your family or for 
a friend, it leaves you with a 
glow as warm as the sepia 
tones in the original photos.
The process begins with 
digitizing the print. A ﬂatbed 
scanner is ideal, but you can 
also take a photo of the print 
with your camera; just light it 
evenly, with two lamps at 45 
degrees to the print.
Once digitised, you can get 
to work in Photoshop. With 
a fragmented print like this, 
the irst task is to piece it back 
together like a jigsaw puzzle. 
Next comes the tidy-up job. 
We ix spots, marks and 
scratches, then tidy up and 
replace missing details.

Highlight the background 
layer in the Layers panel 
and repeat for each 
segment until each 
has its own layer.

05  TIDY THE EDGES
The Clone 
tool can also help to 
blend uneven tones, 
particularly in otherwise 
plain backdrops. This is 
best done at 50% brush 
opacity or less (press 
5 to switch to 50%, 4 
for 40%, etc.) Once the 
cloning and healing is 
complete, use the Crop 
tool to chop of any 
messy edges.

Adobe Brush enables 
you to make your 
own custom brushes 
from photos or sketches for 
use in Photoshop, Illustrator 
or the Sketch app. The most 
successful subjects are usually 
those that can be easily 
isolated, such as a splash 
against white, or a leaf against 
the sky. You can capture objects 
for your brush tips using your 
device’s camera, choose from 
your camera roll, or use your 
Creative Cloud library. Once 
captured, you can then ine-
tune the look of the tip and 
apply brush settings.

Mix enables you to merge two photos together 
to create a composite image. It ofers a simpliied 
compositing process that makes it easy for beginners 
to start combining an object from one image with a background 
from another. You can then send the composite to Photoshop 
for further edits. If you like, you can also use Mix to edit a single 
image. It ofers a few simple tonal adjustments and more 
complex edits such as Content-Aware Fill.
If you ever need help

As the name suggests, this app enables you to paint 
freehand using a selection of brushes, colors and other 
tools. However, Sketch is more than just a painting 
app. It also enables you to connect with like-minded creatives, 
so you can follow artists and see their work updating. Once 
you’re done sketching the image on your iPad, you can upload 
to the Sketch community or continue working on the image 
in Photoshop CC. You can also bring in brushes made with 
Adobe Brush, and for those who can’t paint, there’s an option 
to overlay images so you can trace over a photo. Sketch is 
compatible with Adobe’s pen and ruler hardware, Ink and Slide, 
but you can get great results with your inger.
Fix is a retouching app

The image-editing process begins as 
soon as you’ve transferred your photos 
from your memory card to your computer.
The irst stage is to begin sifting 
through your pictures to discover which are 
the keepers. The image organizer that comes 
with Photoshop is ideal for this task. Adobe 
Bridge has controls for keywording, rating and 
iltering your images, and there are handy tools 
for batch renaming iles, creating panoramic 
stitches, making contact sheets and more.
        Launch Adobe Bridge and navigate to a 
folder containing new images. Use the cursor 
keys to quickly ﬂick through the images and 
click below a thumbnail to add a star rating, or 
use the keyboard shortcut $NE$USM. You 
can then ilter your images by the star rating to 
group the ones you want to work on.
   
The next step is to open the images 
from Bridge into Adobe Camera Raw. ACR 
is the best place to make initial changes to 
your images to boost tones and correct any 
problems with exposure and so on. It doesn’t 
enable you to combine images – you’ll use 
Photoshop for that – but it does enable you to 
make the kind of edits photographers need.
      
In Photoshop, you can further reine 
the image with layers and adjustment layers, 
which ofer a much more ﬂexible way of 
working than ACR. Once you’ve inished, it’s 
time to share it with a wider audience. Go to 
File>Save, and your image will be saved as a 
Photoshop document (PSD). This keeps all the 
layers intact, which means you can go back and 
retweak the image at a later date. However, 
PSD iles are large and take up lots of hard drive 
space. If you want to share your images online 
or via email or social media, save them as JPEGs.

Discover how to process your raw iles to perfection
The latest version of the raw ile 
processor included with Photoshop is so 
powerful that most photos can be processed 
entirely in the raw processor, with no need for 
further editing in Photoshop. And by making 
your adjustments in Adobe Camera Raw 
rather than in Photoshop, you’ll ensure the 
best possible image quality, because raw iles 
contain more picture information than bitmap 
images such as un-layered PSDs and JPEGs. 
Here’s our reference to the features you’ll use 
the most in the Basic panel.

The six most frequently used Photoshop layers for image 
editing, and how to use them to improve almost any photo
Photoshop has many types of layers 
and adjustment layers available, but 
there are six that you’ll ind you need to use 
again and again. Learning how they should be 
used may seem a little daunting for beginners, 
but once you’ve got to grips with them, you’ll 
ind they play a part in the creative process of 
almost every image you make.
02 CURVES
Curves is one of the most powerful 
adjustment layers. An S-shaped curve 
brightens the highlights and darkens the 
shadows, resulting in extra contrast. Create 
a Curves Adjustment Layer and click the 
middle of the diagonal line to add a central 
control point. Drag down on the lower part 
of the line and drag up on the upper part of 
the line to improve image contrast.
01 LEVELS
This should be the irst layer you add 
to an image, because it fundamentally alters 
the tonal range of the entire image. Create 
a Levels Adjustment Layer, drag the Black 
Point slider inwards until it touches the left-
hand edge of the histogram, and drag the 
White Point slider inwards to the right-hand 
edge. This remaps the tones of the image to 
make more of the available tonal range.
03 HUE/SATURATION
This adjustment layer is best used 
for altering the intensity and brightness 
of individual color channels in an image – 
greens and blues in landscapes, for instance. 
Create a Hue/Saturation Adjustment Layer, 
click the Master menu and choose the color 
channel you’d like to adjust. Small changes 
are usually the most efective.

#&'03&
"'5&3
06 SELECTIVE SHARPENING
Once all other adjustments have 
been made, you need to sharpen the image 
for output. The traditional way is to create a 
merged layer at the top of the stack, apply 
Unsharp Mask, then paint on the mask to 
remove the sharpening from those parts 
of the image you want to remain soft. 
However, the Sharpen tool enables more 
control over the process by enabling you to 
build up the efect by brushing repeatedly 
with a low opacity brush. Create a new blank 
layer, select the Sharpen tool, tick Sample All 
Layers and set a Strength of 50% or lower.
05 DODGE AND BURN
One of the best ways to enhance a 
photo is by lightening or darkening selected 
areas of the image. This can be done with 
the Dodge and Burn tools, but rather than 
use them directly on the image, a separate 
grey layer gives you greater control. To 
create a Dodge and Burn layer, hold down 
Alt and click the Create a new layer icon in 
the Layers panel. Give the layer a name, 
then choose Mode: Overlay. Check Fill with 
Overlay-neutral color and click OK. Now use 
the Dodge and Burn tools (with Range set to 
Midtones) to work on the new layer.
04 HEALING LAYER
Most photos contain unwanted 
marks or blemishes. The Spot Healing Brush 
tool is efective at removing these. The best 
way to apply the healing is on a new blank 
layer, so that you can easily tone down or 
remove selected healing work later without 
having to start from scratch because you 
healed directly on the background layer. To 
do this, create a new blank layer, choose the 
Spot Healing Brush tool from the Tools panel 
and tick Sample All Layers on the Options 
Bar, then continue as normal.
